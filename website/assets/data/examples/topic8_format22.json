        "text":"How to Say Yes to the Dress\n\nBy March 31, 2020 Ruthe Tuesdays\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty safe to say that most of us have been dreaming of the moment that we get to say yes to that perfect wedding dress. Everyone says that when you find THE dress, you just know. But how do you get to that point? How do you go from looking at a thousand dresses on Pinterest to being confident in that one dress? While we don\u2019t have a full proof formula for finding the winner, we do have some tips to make a difference as you shop for that important gown.\n\n  \u2022 Do your Research\n\nBefore waltzing into a bridal boutique, make sure to do your research! Don\u2019t be a shopper without a vision. Take the time beforehand to make that wedding dress Pinterest board. Find out what you like and what you can\u2019t stand. Note the consistencies in the dresses that you are pinning. Do all of them have the same neckline or train? This can be a very helpful observation and something to definitely share with the sales representative of the bridal shop. It\u2019s always good to give them as much information about your style as possible. It\u2019ll make the appointment much easier for both of you!\n\n  \u2022 Form a Budget\n\nBefore making any appointments with a bridal boutique, please make sure to form a budget for yourself. Consider how much you want, or can afford, to spend on your dress, alterations and accessories. Be realistic. The worst thing you can do is try on a dress you know you can\u2019t afford, fall in love with it, cry tears of joy and have to leave without that dress. Don\u2019t put yourself through that torture!\n\n  \u2022 Find your Support System\n\nTypically, a bride will want to go dress shopping with a few of her loved ones. It\u2019s always great to have that support system and group of people to help you find your dream dress. Plus, it\u2019s so sweet to share that \u201csay yes to the dress\u201d moment with someone like your mom or best friend. Find out who that support system is for you and invite them to join you. But on the other hand, don\u2019t feel obligated to invite everyone. Don\u2019t overwhelm yourself and the bridal boutique with 10 or 15 extra people. Too many people might equal too many opinions as well.\n\n  \u2022 Give Yourself Time\n\nGetting the perfect dress takes time. If you know you\u2019re a picky or indecisive shopper, start the process well in advance. Consider the time it might take to find something that makes you happy. How many bridal boutiques will you make appointments with? You must also factor in the time it takes to get your dress altered. On average, it could take up to 6-8 months to get those alterations done. That means you might need to start that Pinterest board and shopping prep a year in advance of your wedding. It\u2019s always better to be safe rather than too late!\n\nFinding that perfect dress to say \u201cI Do\u201d in is one of the most special moments within your engagement season. Taking the time to do a little prep before you jump right in can ensure a smoother process and quicker success. I hope these little tips make the difference in your wedding dress experience!\n\n\nAuthor ruthejacksonce\n\nMore posts by ruthejacksonce",

        "text":"In today\u2019s age and era, grooming is something you should take to another level as a gentleman. You cannot underestimate the significance of looking and feeling good. Personal grooming boosts your confidence and it defines your personality. For men, one of the best and golden grooming tips is to keep everything neat and trimmed. It is vital to keep your chest hair, eyebrows, back, and pubic hair tamed.\n\nThe following simple guide will walk you through the fundamentals, which you may already know. All of the below practices can be accomplished on almost any budget so rest assured that it\u2019s all well within your means.\n\n\nHair care is vital in men\u2019s personal grooming. Invest in good hair products to keep your hair healthy and with good volume\/texture. Your regime should include a regular natural shampoo wash to get rid of dirt. Use a natural shampoo for men as it is gentle on hair, scalp and cannot strip away essential oils and nutrients. However, avoid using the wrong shampoo on your hair as it can cause hair growth issues. In addition to your haircare routine, use a national conditioning oil twice or thrice a week. A natural hair oil works best on different hair types. It ensures your hair gets essential nutrients for healthy growth.\n\n\nHair care menHAIR STYLING\n\nStyling your hair, however, is an entirely different matter. From gluey pastes to waxes to velvety creams (not to mention hairsprays and gels, which are undergoing a bit of a renaissance), there is an overwhelming array of styling products out there that you might be lost already.\n\nHair is a gift, so what you put in it should work with, not against. Embrace the texture of your hair. If you have curly hair, don\u2019t try to shellac it into a smooth and shiny pompadour. If you have fine hair, don\u2019t weigh it down with heavy product. While the longer, more natural look is becoming more popular, that doesn\u2019t mean you should stop using product. It\u2019s longer hair with a purpose. It\u2019s not just disheveled bed head. There\u2019s still a grooming element to it, a finish.\n\nThink about what you want as your desired result,\u201d Cutler says. \u201cIt\u2019s about distributing the product evenly through your hair.\u201d There\u2019s no one-fit solution\u2014the key is figuring out what complements your hair type and your particular hairstyle.\n\n\nHair paste men\n\n\nWhen it comes to men\u2019s grooming, shaving is the golden rule. You need to shave well. Avoid throwing on any old shaving cream and running a cheap razor through your face. This can cause serious irritation, bumps and leave you with hard to manage ingrown hairs. Use the right shaving products for smooth and glowing skin.\n\nIt is wise that you take a shower before shaving because it softens the skin and promotes a clean shave. Secondly, exfoliate the area to be shaved using a good face scrub as this softens the whiskers. What\u2019s more, it gets rid of oil and prevents a buildup of dead skin too. Another point to note is that; you should use natural products when shaving.\n\n\nHaving a facial care routine was often considered a women\u2019s thing. However, with changing trends, men of today need to have a daily facial care regimen. This helps to keep your face looking youthful, healthy, energised and vibrant. It is therefore essential that you wash your face in the morning and in the evening.\n\nTo get the best results, get a men\u2019s face wash that matches your skin type. It is imperative that you understand your skin to get a product that works best for you. For example, if you have a sensitive or dry skin, go for a product that will not worsen the situation. There are face products for sensitive, dry, and oily skin types. In the event where you are not sure, consider visiting a dermatologist for the best advice.",

While we all think we know how to straighten hair, we could all do with a refresher. And while this tool can be a lifesaver, by using it incorrectly you are causing more trouble in the long run. To avoid inadvertently damaging your hair, check out our three simple tips for using flat irons like a pro.\n\nProtect Your Hair\n\nAlways start by prepping hair with a heat protectant like Eleven Miracle Hair Treatment. This will make sure hair stays healthy and easy to style.maxresdefault.jpg\n\nUse Even Sections\n\nThe key for polished flat iron styles is even sectioning. When styling hair, keep sections the same size for a consistent and balanced hairstyle. Generally six even sections, illustrated in the image below, is sufficient. If you have very thick hair you may need to create more, smaller sections to keep things manageable.sections.png\n\nGet Your Temperature Right\n\nFinally, make sure you know what\u00a0flat iron temperatures suit your hair and style.

If you are working on the front lines or an essential employee, you likely have no time to read this. We appreciate you!\n\nIf you are working from home, perhaps the time saved commuting and now dressing more casually will help you carve out a little time for SELF-CARE! In fact the articles and statistics are showing a rise in self care! That is because it makes us feel good! I\u2019ve even told my skincare customers to treat their face during the day the same way they would at night. Why not? If you are not going anywhere let your skin absorb all the goodness during the day too\u2013 especially if you are going make up free.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved skincare, hair products and makeup. Bring it on\u2013the more the better. However, I\u2019ve realized in the last few years after delving into Clean Beauty, that just as our personal style is widely varied, so is our skincare and makeup routines. Many women are just like me, some prefer a very minimal routine, and then there are all sorts in between!\n\nWherever you are at, I hope you will take the downtime if you have it and do some self care.\n\nHere is a video I created to show some ways to give your hands and feet a little TLC.\n\nYour hands will feel fantastic after this treatment. It was such a game changer for me! Here I\u2019ve been slathering moisturizer all over my hands, but forgot how important it was to exfoliate first (just like your face) so the products are better absorbed.\n\nTo get started, you need some type of body or facial scrub, a facial cleanser and moisturizer. I even found the spa white gloves I mentioned.\n\nSince I\u2019m a firm believer in clean ingredients, here\u00a0are some of the products I used.\n\n\n\n\nOvernight Facial Oil\n\nI love this combo set which makes a great gift as well. Think Mother\u2019s Day, Teachers or Grads!\n\nIf you are interested in more \u201cAt-home\u201d spa ideas I invite you to join my Facebook Group\n\nIt is a closed, private group and I welcome you if you\u2019d like to know more about Clean Beauty.\n\nStay safe and well everyone.

        "text":"Home > Hair Curling > Caring for Permed Hair\n\nCaring for Permed Hair\n\nBy: Jennie Kermode - Updated: 20 Dec 2012 | comments*Discuss\nPerm Hair Permed Curl Conditioner\n\nGetting a perm can give you an exciting new look but can also put a strain on your hair. Proper care is essential to keeping it in good condition. For twenty four hours after getting your perm you should do as little to it as possible - don't wash or brush it, and consider keeping it under a cap to protect it from the elements. After that, you'll be ready to enjoy your curls to the full, but don't forget to care for them.\n\nShampoo and Conditioner\n\nThe first thing you need to be aware of with a perm is that it can really dry your hair out, even if you had oily hair to begin with. This means you will need to switch to different hair care products. Some shampoos are specially formulated for permed hair, but any gentle shampoo with moisturiser will do the job. If you have problems with your hair breaking, try shampoo designed for babies.\n\nThere is a myth that conditioner weighs down permed hair and shortens the lifetime of a perm. Don't believe this. It's important to condition your permed hair to keep it healthy, and doing so can actually make your perm last longer. In fact, one of the best things you can do for your perm is to give it a deep conditioning treatment every two weeks. This will keep it soft and bouncy.\n\nHair is always at its most fragile when wet and permed hair can be especially delicate, so be carefully not to tug at it too much as you massage in shampoo or conditioner. After washing, gently pad it dry with a towel. Don't rub. It's best to avoid blow-drying, but if you must do this, stop when it's still slightly damp.\n\nCombing Your Permed Hair\n\nIf you ever try using a brush on permed hair, you'll soon realise your mistake. This is a guaranteed way to turn it into a big ball of frizz. Not only is it unlikely to give you the look you're going for, it can lead to your hair getting more dried out and damaged. If you once frizz your permed hair badly it can be hard to get it back into orderly curls.\n\nFine-toothed combs can also create problems with frizz, so the best option is to use a wide-toothed comb. A wooden comb is ideal as it won't build up static electricity. Although your hair will be more prone to tangling than when it was straight, it's important not to comb too aggressively, or you will damage the shape of your curls. For bad tangles, use your fingers first and only then switch to the comb.\n\nCutting Permed Hair\n\nWhen you've finally got your hair looking just the way you want you may be loathe to cut it. Cutting is, however, essential to maintaining a healthy perm. This is because your hair will gradually break at the ends due to dryness. Try to get it trimmed at least once every two months to stop split ends from developing and working their way up the hair.\n\nRegular haircuts will also keep your hair from getting too heavy, helping you to maintain bouncy curls. Of course, every perm falls out eventually. This varies by hair type and can happen any time between two and six months. Ideally you should give your hair a rest and make sure it's healthy before perming again. This means you'll get better results and you can enjoy fantastic looking curls.\n\nYou might also like...\nShare Your Story, Join the Discussion or Seek Advice..\nWhy not be the first to leave a comment for discussion, ask for advice or share your story...\n\nIf you'd like to ask a question one of our experts (workload permitting) or a helpful reader hopefully can help you...

        "text":"Summer Wear\n\nUnderstanding Your Summer Wear Choices\n\nFiguring out what to wear to a job interview is hard enough, but when the temperatures rise into the 90's and your closet is full of casual summer wear, it\u2019s even more challenging. With the current trend towards \u201cbusiness casual\u201d dress, how do you know the difference between appropriate office wear and lightweight summer wear? Even with stifling heat and soul-crushing humidity, interviewers will still expect you to show up dressed to impress.\n\nLooking good, no matter how hot\n\nThere\u2019s a rule of thumb where interview clothes are concerned that says you shouldn\u2019t dress like the job you want \u2013 you should dress like the job above the one you want. Even if the company with which you\u2019re interviewing has a very casual dress code, dress in as professional manner as you can. You\u2019re not an employee yet \u2013 you can be casual once you get the job! No matter how hot it is, you have to look professional. Go ahead and take your suit jacket off for the drive to the interview, but make sure you\u2019re wearing it when you arrive \u2013 and keep it on.\n\nDress in comfortable summer wear, but stick to classic business styles. Unless the job you want is in a fashion-forward industry like entertainment, art or fashion, keeping your interview outift simple and tasteful. What you wear should be comfortable enough that you can relax and let your personality shine through, but it should still be tastefully appropriate to the office. And if you\u2019re wearing a new outfit for the first time, make sure you remove the tags \u2013 you\u2019d be surprised how many people show up to interviews with price tags poking out of their sleeves!\n\nChoose a dark or neutral color suit, preferably blue, black or brown, in a fabric that doesn\u2019t wrinkle. Despite its popularity as a summer wear fabric, avoid 100 percent linen \u2013 it wrinkles horribly, and tends to sag when the wearer gets sweaty and damp. Women should combine their suits with soft colored blouses, while men can wear light colored dress shirts and conservative ties with their suits. If you\u2019re just out of college and don\u2019t have a lot of money to spend on clothes, invest in one good, seasonless suit for interviews.\n\nDon\u2019t neglect hygiene\n\nYou don\u2019t want to show up sweaty for your interview, so try dressing down in the car on the way over and keep the car\u2019s air conditioning on high until you get there. But don\u2019t let your concerns about body odor inspire you to go overboard with the fragrance \u2013 nothing\u2019s worse than sitting in a small office with someone who reeks of perfume or aftershave.\n\nNo matter how hot it is, don\u2019t make the mistake of dressing down for your interview \u2013 golf shirts and strapless sundresses are fine summer wear, but they\u2019re not appropriate choices for a job interview. Dress for success despite the heat, and that job will be yours.\n\nBookmark Page (CTL + D)\n\u00a92017 FatNewt LLC, All Rights Reserved \u00a0 \u00a0 Contact Us \u00a0 \u00a0 User Agreement \u00a0 \u00a0 Privacy Policy \u00a0 \u00a0 Become a Writer \u00a0 \u00a0 Sitemap",
