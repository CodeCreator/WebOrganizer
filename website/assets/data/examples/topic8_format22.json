Tease and tweak with hairspray and voila!\n\nYet anyone with fine hair will know this tends to deflate before you\u2019ve even arrived at the dance floor. If your hair loses volume quickly, the easiest way to achieve thickness is with hair extensions.\n\nIt\u2019s the easiest way to create a glam look and, if you use Clip\u2019 N Go Hair Extensions, you can even style them before fitting them to your hair.\n\nBegin with a volumising shampoo and conditioner to create a lift at the roots.\n\nUse a round brush with soft bristles, designed to be used for hair extensions. Using a hair dryer, coil the hair around the brush, lifting the hair at the roots. As well as creating lift and volume, this will create a bouncy curl at the end.\n\nStyle each section individually, beginning at the nape of the neck and working your way up to the crown.\n\nHairspray will help keep ends in place and roots high.\n\nIf you\u2019re fitting extensions after styling them, remember to work in layers to help create a natural look.\n\nIf you\u2019re leaving your hair loose then you\u2019re ready to go. If you want to tie your hair back, to keep the volume in check work ends from the sides first, making sure you come into the contact with the roots as little as possible (natural oils on your skin will add weight to your hair, reducing the volume). Tie gently either in a ponytail at the back of the next creating a sixties beehive style. For a more contemporary look, fix hair in a swept side bun, with volume at the crown adding glamorous style.\n\nRemember to use products that are suitable for hair extensions. Dream Girl has a range of shampoo and conditioners designed to keep your locks in luscious shape.\n\n2 Responses to \u201cGive yourself a\u00a0lift\u201d\n\n  1.

        "text":"November 26, 2013\n\nBlushing Bride on a Budget: DIY Make Up Tips for Your Special Day\n\nIf you\u2019re handy with a blending brush and can apply mascara like a pro, you may have the steady and skilled hand to apply your own wedding makeup. On average, a bride can spend around $183 for hair and makeup. Budget-conscious brides can save money by practicing their makeup techniques at home for a stunning wedding makeup that looks professional. With your engagement ring sparkling on your finger, your hair entwined in a romantic up-do, and your face camera ready, you can say \u201cI do!\u201d with the utmost confidence.\n\nPerfect Your Palette\nCreate a solid foundation to ensure that your makeup will last throughout the day and night. Achieve a flawless complexion by first prepping the skin with an eye cream and face primer. Use an under eye concealer to cover up dark spots and a tinted moisturizer for a natural look. Check to see if your concealer matches your skin tone perfectly by applying it in natural lighting. Concealers with peach undertones are ideal for women with dark circles, while green undertones help banish blemishes and skin redness.\n\nMoisturize and Prime\nSkin on the face demands moisture just as much as the rest of the body. Create a dewy \u2013 not shiny \u2013 finish by applying an oil-free moisturizing lotion. Smooth away fine lines with a light application of eye gel. Opt for an all-in-one moisturizer and primer to avoid wearing too many layers of makeup. Primer helps to blur deep pores, allows makeup to go on more evenly and keeps makeup looking great, longer. Finish with a dusting of translucent powder on the T-zone to absorb excess oil and to achieve a fresh-faced glow.\n\nFocus on the Eyes\nThe eyes are the windows to your soul, and the main focal point in most pictures. Marie Claire Beauty Expert, Cassie Steer, suggests starting with an application of light eyeshadow all over the eyelid to open up the eyes and make them stand out in photographs. Maximize the eye shadow's staying power by applying it with a damp brush. Highlighter in the inner corners of the eyes can also help make the eyes appear bigger. Many brides opt for a pair of false lashes on their wedding day, along with a heavy coat of black eyeliner and mascara, to really make the eyes pop.\n\nCreate a Kissable Pout\nLipstick that stays while you eat, drink and kiss can be challenging. Achieve a flawless set of color-filled lips by using a liner after applying lipstick. This allows you to define your lips and make them appear bigger. Lip stain is the optimal choice for natural-looking, smudge-proof color. Simply finish with a coat of clear gloss for lips that shine. Remember that your lips may require a darker color to stand out in photographs. Carry a small tube of lipstick in a touch-up kit and reapply as needed throughout the celebration.\n\nBlush Up the Cheeks\nFlash photography and white dresses can wash out the skin, making you appear paler than you are. Add warm hints of rose hues to your cheeks for a radiant look that lasts. Gently sweep bronzer under the cheekbones, and apply a light dusting to the forehead, temples and bridge of the nose. Opt for a natural dusty rose tone or sheer pink cream blush applied to the apples of the cheeks. Blush will achieve that healthy flush and liven your skin.\n\nPat Freeman is a freelance travel writer from Hawaii.\n\n\nRelated Posts That You May Like:\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nComments posted on this blog are moderated and approved only if they are relevant, on-topic and not abusive.

        "text":"Affordable, All Natural Beauty Tips Bring Out The Best In You\n\nHere are a few tips to help you with your beauty regimen. With proper information, you can start looking just like professional beauticians. Keep reading for some useful ideas you can use to get a better appearance.\n\nFill an empty pot or a tiny jar with the moisturizer of your choice. This little container fits everywhere, like your work desk drawer, your handbag or an overnight bag. You can use a quick dab of it to counteract feelings of dryness as soon as they occur.\n\nRub your feet with Vaseline before going to bed. You can get the same smooth, soft results of a professional pedicure this way. Do this every night as part of your routine, and it will be easy to remember. To avoid staining your sheets, put socks on right after applying Vaseline.\n\nExfoliate to remove the dead skin cells from your face. Sensitive skin should be exfoliated about once or twice a week. If you skip this vital step you are passing on a very important step that can really help your complexion glow. This will give your face a fresh, radiant glow and will prevent your pores from becoming blocked by oils and dead skin cells.\n\nMake sure you have Vitamin E around. It can serve many different purposes. Vitamin E is great for keeping skin soft and supple. Vitamin E can also be used on your cuticles to keep them from splitting and feeling rough.\n\nMake sure to use heat-activated shampoo, conditioner and styling product when using heated tool, such as a curling or straight iron. Heated hair appliances used on a daily basis can damage your hair, if you don\u2019t take the proper precautions. Heat-activated products are properly formulated to help your hair stand up to heat treatments, and they improve the texture and shine of your hair, too.\n\nAlways curl your eyelashes using an eyelash curler prior to the application of mascara. This increases their perceived length and brightens your eyes. Place the eyelash curler pads near the base of the lashes and squeeze the pads together. Pause and hold for a few seconds, then release. Once you\u2019ve done that, move along your lashes and repeat the squeezing motion. This technique will give your lashes a soft curve instead of a sharp angle.\n\nOnly apply shimmer where light may enhance it. This will give you a subtle glow. Highlighter should be used on the upper planes of the face like cheekbones, brows and nose.\n\nIf your skin is not flawless, use matte blush. Shimmer blushes can highlight any imperfection. Matte blushes, on the other hand, can camouflage blemishes, helping to give you the look of radiant, flawless skin.\n\nThe accumulated foundation under the cap of your bottle makes a great concealer. When you are out of regular concealer, the collected foundation in the cap serves as a great replacement. It is the perfect concealer because it already matches your skin tone and is thick.\n\nAs you can see, learning about beauty products and techniques that work well for you isn\u2019t as difficult as it may appear. It\u2019s important to consistently put in the effort, though. When you use your knowledge, you\u2019ll be successful.",

        "text":"The CF Guide to Looking Chic at Theme Parks\n\nPublish date:\nSocial count:\nTheme Park at Night\n\nPhoto Credit\n\nAren't theme parks the best? I mean, they have everything: fun rides to go on, indulgent food to eat, and enough awesome activities to keep you occupied all day long.\n\nHowever, as amazing as theme parks are, they always cause a certain fashion conundrum to arise: how can you look stylish and stay comfortable throughout the day? If you've ever had that thought, you're in luck, because I've developed some tricks and tips to help you do both.\u00a0Interested in learning more? Read on for the\u00a0ultimate\u00a0guide to looking chic at theme parks:\n\nScenario #1: A Day at the Park\n\nYou're planning to spend the next 12 hours at a theme park, so you need an outfit that is super-comfortable, able to keep you cool in scorching temperatures and still \u00fcber-stylish. (Whew!)\n\nWhat You'll Need:\n\n  \u2022 A breezy top and a pair of laid-back shorts are pretty much the perfect items to wear at theme parks. Both items are casual, comfy and will keep you cool in hot weather.\n  \u2022 A pair of comfortable shoes is a must. Since you'll be on your feet all day, this isn't the time to break in a new pair of sandals or sneakers.\n  \u2022 As far as bags go, choose a hands-free style -- like a cross-body bag -- so you can enjoy your day without worrying about lugging around a heavy bag.\n\nOutfit for Inspiration\n\nTheme Park Outfit 1\n\nTop - H&M, Shorts - Nordstrom, Necklace - Miss Selfridge, Bag - Nine West, Belt - Topshop, Shoes - TOMS\n\nFor this look, I chose a pretty printed blouse and a pair of basic denim shorts for a perfect summer look. These classic sneakers are comfortable enough to wear all day, while a cross-body bag is large enough to hold all the items you'll need. Finally, accessorize with pieces like a colorful belt and matching necklace.\n\nScenario #2: Ready to Cool Off\n\nThis scenario has the same basic premise as Scenario #1, except this time, you're planning to go on all of the big water rides at the park, meaning you'll likely be drenched from head-to-toe... multiple times. You'll need an outfit that will keep you from looking like a soggy mess mid-way through the day.\n\nWhat You'll Need:\n\n  \u2022 Look for clothes made of quick-drying fabrics and avoid thick fabrics like denim, which take forever to dry.\n  \u2022 A comfortable\u00a0swimsuit to wear under your clothes, which will dry much faster than normal undies.\n  \u2022 Comfortable, waterproof shoes. Don't wear shoes made of materials like leather and suede, which can get ruined when wet. Also, damp shoes and socks= no bueno.\n  \u2022 A roomy bag that can hold an extra set of clothes if you need them. Another hands-free option to try is a lightweight backpack.\n\nOutfit for Inspiration\n\nTheme Park Outfit 2\n\nRomper - Forever 21, Bikini - H&M, Bag - O'Neill, Sandals - Forever 21, Ring - AmRag, Earrings - Topshop\n\nFor this look, I started with a lightweight navy blue romper made from a water-resistant fabric. Underneath the romper, wear a patterned bandeau bikini and add some comfy sandals and a stylish backpack. Finally, add some unique jewelry like this ring and these earrings, which pick up on the colors found on the bikini.\n\nScenario #3: Making a Splash\n\nYou're going to spend the afternoon at a water park catching some rays, going on awesome water slides and scoping out cute boys. You need getup that will look good and be practical for a day in the water.\n\nWhat You'll Need:\n\n  \u2022 A stylish one-piece swimsuit, since bikini tops and bottoms tend to come off after going on water slides. If you insist on wearing a bikini, make sure it fits\u00a0snugly!\n  \u2022 A chic cover-up that you can wear to and from the park. (For more, see our post on cute cover-ups!)\n  \u2022 A pair of flip flops are a\u00a0necessity\u00a0at water parks due to the fact that they're waterproof and easy to put on and off.\n  \u2022 Some sunglasses to protect your eyes. Bring an inexpensive pair in case they get lost during the day.\n  \u2022 An oversized beach bag to hold all the goodies you'll need, like a towel and change of clothes.\n\nOutfit for Inspiration\n\nTheme Park Outfit 3\n\nSwimsuit - Forever 21, Coverup - Roxy, Bag - H&M, Sunglasses - Forever 21, Sandals - Athleta\n\nFor foolproof water park look, wear a pretty swimsuit in a bright color, like this one from Forever 21, and a stylish patterned coverup. Add some sunglasses, flip flops, and a fun graphic beach bag, and you'll be ready for a day in the sun.\n\nBonus! Items You Shouldn't Forget to Bring:\n\n  \u2022 This should be a no-brainer, but remember to wear sunscreen to the park and bring a small bottle so you can reapply throughout the day.\n  \u2022 Carry some\u00a0extra hair ties because\u00a0inevitably, you or someone you're with will need one.\n  \u2022 A small bottle of Advil or a similar pain killer -- just in case!\n  \u2022 If you wear them, an extra pair of contacts and a small bottle of solution. I'm speaking from personal experience here: Nothing is worse than losing one of your contacts at a theme park!\n  \u2022 Remember to take some\u00a0cash with you, because some vendors might not take a debit card. Bringing a set amount of cash can also help you keep track of how much you spend at the park.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWill you be visiting a theme park this summer? What do you normally wear at theme parks? Any tips you'd like to share? Remember to let me know what you think by leaving a comment!",

        "text":"Publish date:\nUpdated on\n\nHow to Pick Best Hair Removal Method for Skin & Hair Types\n\nLearn the best hair removal method for your skin and hair from Completely Bare owner (and former Real Housewife) Cindy Barshop in this Howcast video.\n\n\nThere are definitely different types of hair removal methods depending on your skin type, hair type, and the coarseness of the follicle. I'd like to stay with the first thing. If you have very coarse hair, granted most of the times you have more melon in your skin, that means your skin is darker. So if we take the biggest thing that we're talking about is the permanent hair removal you should make sure that the machine is set or it's a YAG type of laser and that does a better job and is more effective with dark skin. If you have very light skin, fine hair then I always suggest an Alexandrite laser.\n\nNow let's take it a step back. If you're going to wax one of the important things if you have the very coarse dark hair, what you want to do is make the follicles a bit finer. So there's a couple of things we could do with that, utilizing a Capislow or Completely Bare Don't Grow There, makes the hair up to 50 percent finer. Therefore you don't have to wax as often and the hair is finer in between and less ingrown hairs. The other option is shaving. Shaving is great when you have fine hair, light skin and therefore when you shave it doesn't grow back as often. You don't have to worry about getting any of the stubble. So usually with the fine, light hair I always say shave. It's easier, it's simpler.\n\nPopular Categories",

The best way to cover up:\n\nUsing a sponge, dot flesh-tone concealer over the ink (makeup artist Pati Dubroff told Allure she likes one made by theatrical line Cinema Secrets). It usually takes three layers to cancel out every tone. When the tattoo isn't visible, set the concealer with translucent powder and either swipe highlighting powder over it or spritz it with Evian Facial Spray to prevent caking.

        "text":"Sewing: Leather and Knit Tuxedo Skirt Tutorial\n\n\nThis is the last of the pieces I made for Alt Summit. And sadly enough, I\u2019ve barely used my sewing machines for basic mending since mid January. It\u2019s time to get my rear in gear and sew some more! I\u2019ve got a few great ideas for clothes for Penelope and me. Penelope is\u00a0finally at a point where she\u2019s not destroying her clothes, so I\u2019m excited to start sewing for her again.\n\nHere was the basic vision that I had for the first day of Alt Summit. It was something simple with the letter lover sweatshirt and skinnies (blogged here), but then kicked up a notch for the evening with a blazer and leather skirt.\n\n\nThe outfit pictured below isn\u2019t what I actually wore the evening of the event, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing a lot lately: mixing neutrals. I\u2019ve been mixing browns and blacks a lot lately. I find that it\u00a0can be easily done, if browns and blacks are the only \u201ccolor\u201d introduced into the outfit. It\u2019s much harder to mix neutrals (for me at least) when other colors are introduced into the palette.\n\n\nInstead of going for a black leather like I had originally sketched out, I went for an oatmeal\/white leather. It breaks up the brick pattern nicely and it\u2019s a little more casual.\n\n\nConstructing this skirt after my last leather skirt was a BREEZE. I didn\u2019t insert any invisible zippers on leather. The fact that it\u2019s mostly ponte knit allows for more wiggle room when moving around.\n\n\nBetween the knit and the yoga waistband, I can wear the skirt lower or higher depending upon how I want the overall look to come across. It\u2019s nice to have flexible, comfortable pieces in the wardrobe.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been meaning to write up this post for some time, but the biggest hang-up has been the tutorial. It\u2019s so easy to make your own, I thought I would include a tutorial in the post. Click \u201cread more\u201d below to view the instructions.\n\n\nOutfit Details:\n\n  \u2022 earrings: c\/o Ardor\n  \u2022 necklace: Ann Taylor Loft\n  \u2022 watch: c\/o Feral\n  \u2022 bracelets: handmade, gift\n  \u2022 top: Forever 21\n  \u2022 skirt: handmade\n  \u2022 shoes: c\/o Sole Society\n\n\n\n\nLeather and Knit Tuxedo Skirt Tutorial\n\n\n\n  \u2022 1 yard ponte knit (heavy knit with 50-65% 4-way stretch, see here)\n  \u2022 garment weight leather (see measurements below for amount)\n  \u2022 bulldog clips, or paper clips\n  \u2022 large paper\n  \u2022 pencil\n  \u2022 ruler\n  \u2022 measuring tape\n  \u2022 regular sewing machine\n  \u2022 universal sewing needle\n\nTake your measurements. Measure the full circumference of your waist, hip and the desired length of your skirt. You\u2019ll also want to measure the height distance between your waist and hip. If you\u2019re curvy, you may want to take multiple hip measurements. I have basically no hips, so I just took one. Follow the guide above to draft up a basic block on a large piece of butcher paper.\n\n\n\nTrace the pattern piece again. Add about 1\/2 inch to the top of the waist for the back and substract a 1\/2 inch below the waist for the front. This will reduce any crack, but it\u2019s optional if you\u2019re making it high-waisted.\n\nCut 1 1\/2 inches from the flat fold side of the back pattern piece. Cut 2 1\/2 inches from the flat fold side of the front pattern piece. This will allow for the tuxedo strips.\n\nCut tuxedo strips and your waistband according to the measurement guidelines above.\n\n\nCut 1 front and back piece on a fold. Match up the grain so that the stretch happens horizontally.\n\nClip your leather strips to your front piece, right sides together and straight stitch with the longest stitch length (7.0 is what my machine does). Use a walking foot or a Teflon foot and face the leather down toward the feed dogs so the fabric is facing up.\n\nWith a press cloth on top of the right side of your fabric and NO STEAM on your iron, lightly press the seam allowance to the ponte knit side. Topstitch down the knit side.\n\n\nClip front of the skirt to the back of the skirt, right sides together. The front will pucker, so make sure that those pieces are firmly placed together. Sew with a straight stitch at the longest stitch length. Press with a press cloth (or any cotton fabric will do) and topstitch.\n\n\nFold waistband right sides together and straight stitch. You will use a shorter stitch length here. Fold wrong sides together and press with an iron.\n\n\nFlip waistband so the fold is facing down and pin the two pieces together (use clips for leather). Zig zag stitch or use an overlock stitch along the waist to allow the material to stretch without breaking threads. Turn right side out and press seam allowance down.\n\nFold the hem up to the desired length and stitch the fabric together. You can blind stitch by hand or by machine (hand is sometimes faster), then use heat \u2018n bond or a hem tape to hem the leather portions of the skirt.

Madeline says:\n\n      This turned out perfect.\n\n    2. carla says:\n\n      I\u2019m probably being daft but when you cut off the fold, wouldn\u2019t that make your stripes down the center of the skirt front and back, not the sides? Can you please elaborate on the geometry? Cutting the fold would give you 4 knit panels wouldn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t see a seam on yours. Thanks!\n\n      \u2022 Melissa says:\n\n        So you cut off excess paper from the side of the fold and that allows you to keep the curve on the side of the skirt but leave room for the panels to go on the sides. That graphic is for drafting up your pattern, not the actual cut fabric. Cutting off different amounts for the front vs back allows for the tuxedo stripe to land more on your side.\n\n        You cut one piece on the fold for the front and one on the fold for the back and that gives you two panels. Hope that helps.\n\n    3. Roberta Fahrni says:\n\n      Thank you for the tutorial! I am so excited to try \u2013 LOVE your version!\n\n    4. Melissa says:\n\n      This was such a great outfit \u2013 maybe my favorite of yours from Alt.\n\n    5. I adore the use of the leather with the ponte \u2013 gives it a chic and flattering look with the vertical lines. Great tutorial, and good advice about using H&B for the leather hem rather than stitching it!\n\n    6. christina says:\n\n      This is amazing. I am afraid to attempt leather because of my sewing maching. My MIL used my machine while visiting and told me in a very nice way that my machine sucks and I need a new one. So\u2026 can I ask you what sewing machine you use? Do you love it?\n\n    7. Julianne says:\n\n      Love this! Where do you find garment weight leather?

You\u2019re not alone! Almost all my clients seem to struggle with the same question: What should we wear for family photos?\n\nWell, let\u2019s start with what NOT to wear. Don\u2019t go matchy-matchy. Resist the urge to dress everyone in white T-shirts and jeans, or all black and white. You want everyone\u2019s personalities to show, get CREATIVE!\n\nMy rule of thumb? \u201cComplement and coordinate.\u201d Think about it in terms of dominant and accent colors. Each person can wear a different, complementary dominate color, and you coordinate with your accent colors! This will break up the color visually and highlight each personality.\n\nMom, start with your outfit. Choose something that makes you feel your best and feel comfortable. Why? As they say, if momma isn\u2019t happy, no one\u2019s happy. (Also, you\u2019re probably the one who\u2019s reading this and will do all the work setting up the photoshoot and making sure everyone has something to wear. Treat yourself! You deserve it.) The color palette\/style of mom\u2019s outfit should determine what everyone else will wear\n\nWant some more tips to make sure everyone looks great? Here are some things to keep in mind.\n\nPatterns are fine, but avoid tiny patterns and be sure to limit them to one or two people. If you want to mix, some mixing can be ok but be careful, too many patterns will make everything look busy.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to add layers for dimension \u2013 think jean jackets, cardigans, scarves or belts.\n\nRemember, accessories can make your outfits complete, plus you can easily pull off multiple looks in one shoot by switching up your jewelry. (Just keep accessories on babies and toddlers to a minimum because it can swallow them on camera.)\n\nThink beyond colors. Textures (a knitted scarf, corduroy pants, furry vest, etc.) can really make things pop.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble, lay out all your options and take photos so you can compare or get opinions from friends.\n\nPlan ahead! This should go without saying, but make sure everyone\u2019s clothes are clean and wrinkle free. (Don\u2019t wait until the last minute!) And, be sure to try everything on! Make sure you or your kids won\u2019t have to continually adjust or fidget with anything during the photo session. Also, check for visible tan lines.\n\nHair and makeup \u2013 Ladies, this is a great time to get pampered and schedule a professional session. This can be fun, plus it can help in post-editing. Just don\u2019t go overboard \u2013 keep your look close to what you would normally do.\n\nNeed a haircut? Ladies should schedule a trim two weeks before photos, and men should get their haircut a week or so before. Need your eyebrows waxed? Do that three to five days before your session.\n\nNow? Just relax and smile! If you\u2019ve done a little bit of planning, the actual photo session should be a breeze. Have a great time \u2013 you\u2019re all going to look great!\n\n\nStill not sure what to wear!?

It is the only oil which reduces protein loss and boosts the shaft. Apply it on the hair ends to repair them. Yet, make sure you trim them off every 6 weeks.\n\nPrevents Hair Loss\n\nHair loss might be a result of various inflammatory skin conditions, fungal infections, and nutritional deficiencies.\nOn the other hand, coconut oil is rich in healthy fats which are beneficial for the scalp and shaft, soothe inflammation, and treat skin infections.\n\nMix 2 tablespoons of sage oil and 3 tablespoons of coconut oil, and cook them over low heat to mix. Then, leave them to cool until warm and apply the mixture on the head at bedtime. Cover with a shower cap, and leave it thus until the next morning. Then, wash it off.\n\nGray Hair\n\nPigment cells are located at the base of the follicle of the hairs, and they give the hair color. Yet, they die over the time and become less efficient.\n\nMassage the hair with lemon and coconut oil for 15 minutes every day to nourish the scalp and protect the base of the hair follicles, and thus prevent gray hair.\n\nMakes Your Hair Smooth\n\nFrizzy hair is usually a result of excessive dryness of the cuticles and hair shaft. Yet, this oil repels water as it is hydrophobic, but at the same time, it retains the moisture within the hair shaft.\n\nApply coconut oil 10-15 minutes before washing the hair. This will make the hair smooth and silky. To brush through the hair easily, apply some coconut oil on the hair ends as well.\n\nCoconut oil can also be used for hair styling, as it tames flyaways and slicks down the hair.\n\nFights Dandruff\n\nDandruff is a common chronic scalp condition, caused by dry skin, fungus, or other factors, and its main symptom is flaking of the skin on the scalp. Coconut oil fights fungal infections and hydrates the skin, thus treating dandruff.\n\nMix castor oil and coconut oil in equal amounts, and massage the scalp with the mixture. Leave it to act for half an hour, and then wash it out. Repeat this every time you wash the hair in the case of severe dandruff.\n\nKills Lice\n\nLice are most common in young children, and products for their elimination are always rich in toxins and chemicals which burn the scalp and damage the hair.\n\nThis oil can be of great help as it hydrates the skin instead of irritating it and kills even the pesticide-resistant lice. It coats lice and gradually suffocates them.\n\nMoreover, it does not allow lice or their eggs to hang onto the hair shafts. You should apply it evenly to the hair, leave it to act for several days, and continue applying it as it gets absorbed. For even better effects, mix the coconut oil with a few drops of tea tree oil.\n\nTherefore, we strongly suggest using this remarkable oil for your hair. Also, note that you should always use organic coconut oil. Many organic or herbal shampoos contain coconut oil, but make sure you add it if they lack it to enjoy its potent properties.\n\n\nFREE subscription to Receive Quality Stories Straight in your Inbox by submitting your Email below\n\nEmail privacy 100% protected.

        "text":"Stay Chic In The Heat\n\nStyle Tips, Women, Seasonal, Clothing\n\nWhen the heat is on the last thing you want is to be feeling hot and bothered. Here are our tips to keep you cool and chic in the Summer sun this season\u2026.\n\nLighten Up\nDarker colours absorb heat so opt for the lighter shades in your palette wherever possible. If you fall into the Deep colour category this can be particularly tricky but you can try adding a little contrast in the form of a pattern or accessory to ensure the lighter shades you\u2019re wearing don\u2019t wash you out.\n\nSeek Shade\nA stylish hat is a surefire way to up the glam factor whilst also shielding you from harmful UV rays. Be sure to choose a style that flatters your face shape with a brim that covers your neck and ears, as well as your face. A breathable material like straw will ensure your head doesn\u2019t get too hot!\n\nSpecs Appeal\nSquinting is never a good look so invest in a good quality pair of sunglasses that flatter your face shape. Remember; opposites are attractive when it comes to face shapes so if you have a rounder face more angular styles will work best, whereas those of you with long or square face shapes are better suited to frames with softer edges.\n\nMaterial Matters\nLinen and cotton are natural, breathable fabrics and therefore great options for keeping cool in warm temperatures. For those of you who love denim, chambray is a great alternative as it looks similar but is much lighter in weight.\n\nLoosen Up\nWhilst it may not always be the most flattering option to wear loose fitting clothes, during the Summer sometimes it is a necessity. If more fluid clothing shapes aren\u2019t typically suited to your body shape then think of ways to customise them a little to show off your figure \u2013 a loosely tied belt around a tunic will nip in your waist for example. For those of you with Oval body shapes now is the time to embrace those gorgeous flowing fabrics (and maybe show a little leg too!)\n\n\nYou may also enjoy",

        "text":"How to cut your hair at home to save time and money\n\nEver tried cutting your own hair? It's easier than it sounds if you read our guide! Photo: Sevendeman, Bigstock\n\nWhen you hear that someone is cutting his\/her hair at home, you may think that the result will be disastrous. On the contrary, the outcomes can be amazing, and may be even better than a pro\u2026but how?\n\nYou go to your barber and ask for new styles of haircut that requires experience and full control on your hair. You cannot imagine doing the same work at home by any means since you still want to look and feel your best.\n\nAt first, visiting your barber for a short haircut will cost you at least 20 dollars or more, depending on your needs, the style you choose and experience of your barber and fame of their hair salon.\n\nFor short hair, you may need to refresh your haircut every month. As a result, if you do the same work at home, you could save more than 200 dollars per year.\n\nDo those saving sound good to you? If so, read on to see how to do a haircut at home with some basic tools to save money and time.\n\nChoosing the right tools for home use\n\nWhen it comes to haircutting, you will need some basic tools that will help to give you the comfort and ease you require. Your work will need a hair clipper, hair trimmer, scissors, comb, brush, blades, and a razor. However, your haircut requires a hair clipper, but if you plan to use scissors, it will be harder.\n\nChoosing the best hair clipper for home use will be your first goal. You need consider some basic features before choosing a good hair clipper.\n\nFirst, the motor of the clipper should be reliable to cut through all kinds and types of hair. You need a quiet motor that do all the required work with less vibration, which may make you unable to control the machine.\n\nIn addition, hair clippers come with two different power systems of corded or cordless tools. The corded clippers will give continuous power supply, but you should notice that it would make you restricted to the cord length. On the other hand, cordless hair clippers have built-in batteries that provide freedom of movement for cutting.\n\nWhen you choose a cordless clipper, be sure that the battery has quick charging and it provides enough run time for long sessions. For most cases, a good cordless hair clipper needs 2 hours for full recharging and it will give you 60-90 minutes of continuous haircutting.\n\nAdjustability of the hair clipper is a factor to consider when choosing a home use tool. Your hair clipper should have adjustable blades and guide combs to fit all hair length and cutting methods. Most hair clippers come with 6 adjustable hair length settings and some guide combs.\n\nThe blades of the tool determine the quality and durability of the hair clipper. You will find that these blades are made of stainless steel or titanium. Both materials perform well, but the most important aspect is the durability of the blades and their required maintenance.\n\nThe best hair clippers have blades that are self-sharpening to make the lifetime of the blades longer. You need to have a cleaning brush and machine oil inside the kit for maintenance.\n\nTo complete your tools for a home haircut, you need a comb or different sizes of comb, which you can get within a comb kit. Furthermore, it will be useful to get hair-thinning scissors, front and back mirrors and a small vacuum to clean all the cut hair.\n\nChoose your haircut before using the clipper\n\nAfter preparing all the required tools for your home hair salon, you will need to choose a haircut or style. You can surf the internet to pick your target haircut and print out the diagram of the style.\n\nStart with longer guide combs or long setting on your hair clipper to be on the safe side. Then, you can cut shorter until you reach the required length.\n\nA haircut to suit your face shape is an important point of consideration. For round faces, it will be better to shorten hair on the sides of your head and the hair near cheeks, which will give you a shape of longer chin. However, for heart-shaped faces and square shape try to choose a haircut that provides volume on the sides of the face.\n\nTips before cutting your own hair\n\nMake sure you do all of the necessary preparation before you start snipping away at your hair! Photo: Sandy-Che, Bigstock\n\nYou get all the tools and the print out of the style you will do for your hair. Now, start to know much about these tools; and how to use, because it is perhaps your first time to touch your hair with a clipper. Your orientation can help with how to change the guide combs, guards and switch the length settings.\n\nYou need to know everything before you start to avoid checking the user\u2019s guide of the tool while you do your haircut. Run your fingers over your head to find the direction of the hair. Then, cut your hair the opposite direction of the original hair growth.\n\nSides of your head\n\nYou are not a professional barber to start your work with one side of the head and then to go around the back to reach the other side. For home haircutting, you need to start with the right side if you use your left hand and with the left side if you use the right one.\n\nDo not go around to the back, but rather with the other side. This will give you the opportunity to compare both sides of the head and fix the differences.\n\nBack of your head\n\nWhen it comes to the back of the head, you will find that it is harder than with the sides. You should use two mirrors for this part to get full vision. For the first time, you can employ some help to get it well cut.\n\nMoreover, lay one of your hands horizontally as a guide on the back. Begin with longer guide comb and run it along with your guide hand, and try to fade hair from bottom to top.\n\nTop of Your head\n\nChoose a suitable guide comb for the top of your head, which has the longest hair. It will be better to grade the length from the sides to the top. The style you choose for your haircut will determine the length of the comb you should use.\n\nFor thick and long hair, use your scissors to manage long hair shafts before running the clipper on the top. Using scissors is an easy process for long and thick hair, but be careful when using them on the sides and back of your head.\n\nWill you try a DIY haircut?\n\nCutting your hair at home can seem like a daunting task and if you\u2019re not prepared it\u2019s probably better to go to one of the best hairdressers instead. Professional exist for a reason and if you\u2019re going to do a comparable job at home you\u2019ll need the right tools and practise.\n\nRegardless, cutting your hair at home is very much achievable and is a great way to save on time and money.\n\nJames Reed :As our Managing Content Editor, James works hard to ensure that our readership gets a variety of engaging and accurate content every day.

This means that you need to take certain protective measures if you want your artwork to last for many years with all its shining glory.\n\nTattoos can easily fade without the proper protection.

Do not go into hot tubs, swimming pools or lakes during healing process, as they can fade your tattoo and cause infection. New Tattoos peel, itch and can scab, but be careful not to pick or scratch them because you can transfer bacteria from under your fingernails to the tattoo and cause infection and light spots after healing ends. Following these instructions is so important to ensure that the healing process completes uneventfully and your tattoo can live on undamaged.\n\nTo maintain your tattoo color for as long as possible\n\nNew School design\n\nOriginal tattoo by Ben Parker\n\nUV rays (UVA and UVB) accelerate color loss, whether they come from the sun or from a tanning bed. Apply sunblock with at least SPF 30 every day on your tattoo, especially during summer or if it is on an area of your body normally exposed to the sun. If you are going for a tanning session, besides applying sunscreen on it, cover it to try to block as much UV as possible.\n\nMoisturize your skin every day \u2013men and women- especially if your skin feels dry and itchy or becomes flaky. This will prevent you to loose bits of skin that could slowly strip the ink out of your tattoo. And also avoid using skin exfoliators over your tattoo at all costs!\n\nIf there\u2019s no need to show your tattoo, try to keep it covered for the best color protection.

        "text":"There are so many parts of our wardrobe that we do not give a second thought. Sometimes things that fade into the background are the biggest opportunities to make a fashion statement. Forget about defining your glasses as an essential item that you need to use, and think of them as an chance to express yourself. When choosing your frames, think about being bold and selecting fashionable eyewear so you can be stylish from head to toe.\n\nThink About Shape\nWhen choosing an outfit, a person thinks about what would look good on them, what shapes are flattering, what colors they are fond of and so on. The same can be said about the types of glasses you should pick. Take your time exploring the shapes available. What looks good on your face? What fits the look you are going for? There are so many possibilities.\n\nHere are some of your physical features to consider:\n\n  \u2022 Shape of your face (oval, round, square)\n  \u2022 Skin tone\n  \u2022 Browline\n  \u2022 Eye color\n  \u2022 Unique facial features (large eyes, high cheekbones)\n  \u2022 Your Hair\/Hairstyle\n\nAll of these elements will help you determine what frames will fit your expectations.\n\nDoing some research online will make it easier to learn certain tips like how frames with wide bottoms are great choices for people with heart-shaped faces. Or that the popular tortoise shell look is perfect for those with cool skin tones. At the same time, don\u2019t be afraid to experiment and find out what suits you. Have some fun with it!\n\nThink about Your Daily Routine\nAs obvious or unexciting as it may sound, the one thing to be mindful of is the comings and goings of your daily life. Some of the bolder choices in eyewear may be cumbersome and get in the way of physical tasks. Imagine yourself going through a typical day and make sure it is the right fit before you commit. You wouldn\u2019t pick a heel too high or skinny to wear if your feet couldn\u2019t handle it, so don\u2019t skip practicality as a consideration for your eyewear.\n\nThink about Who YOU are\nFashion eyewear is rarely neutral and always makes a statement. Even though frame styles are conducive to faces and physical features, they can also match your fashion sense and personality. Do you have a specific look that you cultivate through your wardrobe and accessorizing? Maybe select frames that are just as specific and tailor-made to your style.\n\nAre you...\n\n  \u2022 Edgy and different? Maybe consider a pair of rule-breaking oversized frames.\n  \u2022 Classic? Wayfarer or round might suit you better.\n  \u2022 Trendy or modern? Thick framed glasses, also known as hipster or \u201cnerdy\u201d glasses, may do the trick.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Vintage? Try horn-rimmed, cat-eye or the aforementioned tortoise shell to bring another level to your style.\n\nMaybe you are more eclectic and your style changes day-to-day. There is nothing stopping you from finding a versatile pair of frames that goes with everything you own. Basic shapes like round and square can still bring a bit of flair if you get the right ones. And crazy colors don\u2019t have to blend in perfectly in order for you to wear them. It is actually a quite a chic choice! Speaking of chic...\n\nHow Daring do you Want to be?\nOnce you get used to the idea of eyewear as a piece of fashion, you can treat it like any other accessory. But what if instead of having them complement a look, what if they were the look?\n\nSometimes, it is fun to choose a bold statement piece that doesn\u2019t necessarily match outfits, but instead acts as the first thing people notice, an extension of your personality. They can be larger than life and as loud and as daring as you want to be.\n\nHere are some aesthetics to think about when choosing statement eyewear:\n\n  \u2022 Loud, bright, bold colors\n  \u2022 Exaggerated size\n  \u2022 Unique or unorthodox shapes\n  \u2022 Intricate, ornate decorations (metal designs, sparkly embellishments)\n  \u2022 One or more flashy patterns\n  \u2022 Accessories (glasses chains, cool cases)\n\nThink about it this way. When people dye their hair, specifically colors that one would find in a crayon box, they don\u2019t worry about whether it would clash their work clothes or party dresses. It is part of who they are, and you should treat your glasses in similar fashion. They can be your signature if you let them.\n\nOverall, the goal is to find fashion eyewear that fits your style, physical appearance and your lifestyle. It is hard for many people to identify something corrective and prescribed to you as a stylish accessory that can bring an extra level of joy or creativity, but they really can and should. Each person is different, and finding a balance what you are looking for in fashionable eyewear is all part of the process. Always remember that glasses do not have to be boring!",

        "text":"Skip to main content\n\nEyebrow Piercing Beaten to Death\n\nWhen I started piercing in 1994, the eyebrow was just coming into it's own as a popular piercing. In fact, up until a few years ago it was a great deal more popular than even the nostril piercing. There has a been a rather steep decline in it's popularity recently but it's at no way the fault of the piercing. On a piercee with the correct anatomy, the piercing can heal quickly with little problems and though it got a bad reputation for migration, it isn't anymore prone to migration than a majority of other piercings. When placed correctly it can almost blend into the facial structure and only enhance and draw attention to the eyes.\n\nHistory and Background:\n\nThe eyebrow piecing is a modern invention with no known ties to ancient\u00a0cultures. However it does have it's roots in the Punk Rock Subculture of the 1970s. Though the practice was often self done with whatever sharp object that could be crammed through the tissue and then closed. Often the extremely unsafe method of forcing a safety pin through the tissue and then wearing it until it became infected or began to reject.\u00a0\n\nThe more permanent modern version seems to have come about in during the late 1980s and then gained popularity through the \"Alternative\" Music of the early 1990s. I remember seeing it for the first time around 1987 or 1988 on a punk girl in Kansas City. She was wearing a ring in the piercing and it seemed healed but I'm unsure if it was done professionally. P.F.I.Q. #36 published in 1991 featured the article\u00a0'Pierce with a Pro' with Jim Ward doing an Eyebrow Piercing. When the piercing was first offered professionally is unknown.\n\nMigration, Anatomy and Location:\n\nEyebrow piercings have been give an unfounded reputation for migration and are often referred to as a \"Safer Surface to Surface Piercing\". The reality is that it all comes down to the structure of the brow, placement and the jewelry worn in the piercing. An ideal candidate for the piercing should have a brow that is made up of lose skin padded skin that is easily lifted from the skull. To test this pinch the brow with the index and thumb. The tissue should be thick and loose and easy to pull away from the body. If you can't pinch the area or it seems that the tissue is thin and tight, an eyebrow piercing may not be the best option. This is due to a lack of padding needed between the skull and the jewelry and the added pressure that the tight tissue. Both will increase the risk of migration and other problems.\n\nThe placement is usually at the edge of the eye and placed to intersect the curve of the brow. I will usually first feel the area to determine the structure\u00a0of the brow and then mark the bottom on the lower side of the brow in alignment with the corner of the eye. For the top I will align it above the hairline in a way that it will match the curve of the eyebrow. With those with thin eyebrow or those that pluck their brows I will mark an even distance from the brow on each side. When done there should be an average of 5\/16th to 3\/8th of an inch between the two dots. Depending on the person's facial structure I may have them smile and raise their eyebrows to get an idea of how the piercing will flow and fit into the face when expressions change. Placing the piercing straight up and down will not only make it seem odd or out of place but it will not lay flat to the face when it heals.\n\nAlternative Placements and Groupings:\n\nGroupings of a number of piercings can be done in the outer third of the brow if the piercee's anatomy allow for them. When you enter the area more closer to the center there is a few added risks including damaging a branch of Trigeminal Nerve, which I will go into more in the risk section and increased likelihood of migration.\n\nThere are also a number of alternative placements that are in fact experimental surface to surface piercings.\u00a0I do not offer these piercings to the general public and do not suggest getting them. If you are dead set on getting one, ask the piercer to show you photos of a number of HEALED examples of their work and drill them on their success rate with the piercings. This is your face and when piercings migrate, you maybe left with a large scar:\n\n  \u2022 The horizontal aka trans eyebrow piercing - located above or below the brow horizontally\n  \u2022 The\u00a0Bindi\u00a0Piercing -\u00a0A Curved Barbell placed vertically in the tissue in the center of the brow above the nose\u00a0\n  \u2022 Teardrop Piercing - A Curved Barbell placed below the eye at the top of the cheek.\n  \u2022 Url\u00a0Piercing which is through the bridge of the nose. This piercing is an invention of Hollywood and in the 15 or so years since I have only seen a handful that have lasted longer than a few months without migrating on one side or the other.\n\nAll of these piercing are rare and it isn't because people haven't tried them but because they are all prone to migration. If you are dead set on getting one of these piecing, do your research, ask for referrals, photos of healed examples and if you see someone with one, ask them about their experience with healing the piercing. Understand that just because the piercer has a number of photos of the piercing on their site or in their portfolios, it doesn't mean that these are example of healed and well seasoned piercings. Many take photos immediately after the piercing is done which may look great but you should be more interested in what they look like 6 months to 6 years after the piercing was done. If you look closely at the photo you may pick up on clues like redness, the residue of surgical scrub or even the marking.\n\nJewelry Types:\n\nWith eyebrow piercings ideally the jewelry should be thick enough to reduce the likelihood of migration or tear but be light enough to reduce stress during healing. After years of piercing eyebrows I've found through experience that 16g in most cases is the best option. Larger gauges can be used up to 12g but they tend to increase migration and scarring unless the piercee's anatomy can handle a larger gauge and a slightly deeper piercing. I have pierced at 18g\u00a0and had a high level of success but the jewelry selection especially with threaded jewelry is extremely limited at 18g and also 18g\u00a0would be more prone to tearing. The width of the jewelry should match the depth of the piercing but on average it is 3\/8th to 7\/16th of an inch wide.\n\nThere has been an on going debate for years about which type of jewelry is best for piercing an eyebrow. One camp has championed the straight Barbell while another has pushed the ring. My experience has taught me that the jewelry should be curved to fit more naturally through the tissue. Straight Barbells add outward force to the piercing causing the piercing tunnel to form outward or a loop of tissue instead of growing into the tissue. In my opinion the loop that forms with healing with a straight piece is less aesthetically\u00a0pleasing and gives the impression that the piercing is foreign and not a part of the body. Also many believe that the piercing will be done with a short barbell and that only the ends will be visible. However it must be longer than the piercing to allow for healing. Due to the angle and force that the jewelry must sit it can cause the balls to indent into the skin and will tend to caught on everything it comes in contact with.\n\n  \u2022 Captive Bead or Beaded Ring - A circular ring with a fixed bead or ball or a bead or ball that is held captive by the tension of the ring.\u00a0For piercing and healing, I have found that a ring is the best option. It is not only lighter than Threaded jewelry but it will not have to be longer than the piercing to allow for swelling. Once the piercing begins to heal the jewelry will tend to lay flat to the face.\n  \u2022 Straight Barbells - A straight post with threaded ends. I do not suggest healing with them or wearing them even after healing. In fact, I have seen a well seasoned piercing suddenly begin to migrate a few weeks after the jewelry was inserted. Curved and Circular Barbells are a much better option.\n  \u2022 Circular Barbells -\u00a0A circular shaped horseshoe with two threaded ends. Can be used during healing and after the piercing is healed with one main concern, weight. Since the ends add additional weight to the jewelry it can increase the risks of migration.\n  \u2022 Curved Barbells - A banana shaped 1\/4 turn post with two threaded ends. I don't suggest piercing with a curved barbell do to the added weigh and the fact that the width will be much larger than needed. However, it is the best option for a healed eyebrow piercing. Not only does it limit contact but it sits comfortably into the piercing.\n\n\nI always do the piercing with forceps. Do not be sold this idea that a freehand piercing is going to be less painful. The reality is that the forceps are needed to pull the tissue away from the body, support the tissue and insure the angle of the piercing is correct. In fact because the forceps flatten out the tissue giving the needle a shorter distance to travel, the piercing is faster and less painful. The forceps should be tight but not painfully tight and should be supported during the whole procedure.\n\nThe piercing should be done from the bottom up to avoid the sharp needle have contact with the piercee's eye. One of the most common mistakes that I see with inexperienced piercers is not lining up the needle at the correct angle. The forceps add greatly in this. If the angle is incorrect the piercing will comonly be deeper on the bottom than the top. I have found that having the client close their eyes makes the experience less stressful and reduces the reaction they may have from seeing my hand move. The piercing is usually not very painful and very quick. Once the needle is through, I \u00a0remove the forceps and guide the jewelry in at an angle to allow clearance of the tissue this may cause a slight tug or discomfort. If the tissue is too thick, I will cork screw the jewelry for insertion.\u00a0\n\nHas... (truncated)",

In terms of hue, so is the wearer\u2019s preference and activities.

You will only see black since both vertical and horizontal rays will be cut off.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\nThe choice of sunglasses is not only aesthetic. They must above all protect our eyes from the sun. The impact of UV on our eyes is multiple and cumulative, so we avoid exposing ourselves to the sun without protection. The advantage of polarized sunglasses is that they offer additional protection over conventional models.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"When Bad Spray Tans Happen to Good People: The 6-Minute Damage Control Guide\n\n\nPhotographed by Steven Klein, Vogue, May 2003\n\nThere is something slightly terrifying about waking up the morning after a professional spray tan session, the scent of DHA drifting through the air, and finding that instead of the soft-focus-Gisele bronze of your dreams, you have, in fact, developed an assortment of patchy sheet-induced streaks.\n\nOf course, even the most careful misting or fully mitted application can result in orange-tinged palms, knees, or feet, where fake color tends to build up on dry skin. I learned this lesson a few weeks ago when a string of (ahem, research-driven) spray tans went awry: After attempting to loofah off the evidence in the shower for what felt like dozens of minutes, clock ticking toward time-to-leave-for-the-office, I dipped into my emergency product arsenal and pulled out AmorePacific\u2019s Treatment Enzyme Peel\u2014a superfine powder that worked surprisingly well to polish away the stains on my skin.\n\nA quick product search soon revealed that self-tan pro James Read makes a similar cream version specifically for color maintenance and removal. And an impromptu survey around the Vogue offices revealed dozens of additional tricks. \u201cIn my experience, the best way of removing a tan entirely is happily also the most all-around therapeutic thing you can do for yourself\u2014especially if you\u2019re freaking out about a bad fake tan. Just steam for ten to fifteen minutes, or longer, if you need some decompression. Then exfoliate all over with a mitt, dry off, and moisturize,\u201d says Vogue.com Fashion News Editor Alessandra Codinha. \u201cYou\u2019ll be streak-free, soft all over, and ready to try again.\u201d\n\nVogue Associate Market Editor Alexandra Michler swears that, if you\u2019re already at the beach, a quick dip in the ocean does the trick (\u201cthe saltwater really helps\u201d). Should that fail, a session with a Bronze Buffer pad, followed by Sphatika\u2019s Bulgarian Rose Oil to rehydrate is Vogue Associate Accessories Editor Grace Fuller\u2019s secret weapon. And she may be on to something: According to Miami native and Vogue.com Beauty Assistant Jenna Rennert, \u201cself tanner and oil hate each other.\u201d She dabs Rodin\u2019s Olio Lusso on the spot, then uses a tough washcloth to lighten dark spots on elbows and wrists.\n\nBut for the definitive answer, I turned to a professional: St. Tropez in-house self-tanning whiz Sophie Evans, who, having perfected the golden limbs of Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham, has significant street cred. \u201cMix lemon juice with a little baking soda or baby oil. Saturate the skin with the mixture, then let it sit for about five minutes before removing with a cleansing wipe\u2014this will erase the tan entirely,\u201d she says. Her other favorite method: \u201cA hair removal cream like Veet. Just do a patch test first to see if your skin can handle it without sensitivity. You can leave it on for up to six minutes\u2014 that will remove the self-tan completely. To simply lighten the color, leave it on for\u00a0about three minutes.\u201d Rinse, dry\u2014and rejoice in the sight of your non-streaky self.\n\nAdd a Comment",
