        "text":"There were double celebrations at our Bethany home in Plymouth on Monday, 9 December as the Local Authority\u2019s Social Services, Bridget Buckley, presented it with two \u2018Excellence\u2019 awards.\n\nThe first was the \u2018Excellent in End of Life Care\u2019 award that Bethany has received for the first time. Each year since 2015 they have been successfully verified by St Luke\u2019s Hospice as 'End of Life Care Champions'. Manager, Emma Hughes, also qualified in Teaching End of Life Care and noted that the Home\u2019s awards are the result of deep commitment from each staff member, whatever their role.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thanks we get from relatives that say the most,\u201d she said, \u201ca daughter wrote, \u2018I\u2019m struggling to express my thanks\u2026 I marvel at the love and care that you gave to (name). Bethany was truly her home: somewhere she could be safe, comfortable and happy. We think Bethany is extraordinary and are glad for everyone\u2019s sake that it exists. Thank you is not a big enough word.\u201d\n\nListening quietly to the first Award speech was volunteer Mike Spry, who was astounded to find that the second Award was for him as \u2018Volunteer of the Year\u2019. \u00a0Mike came to Bethany in 2016 as a pastoral support volunteer through the \u2018Churches Together in Plymouth\u2019 programme. He focused on Bill, (name changed) a resident with no friends or family and who struggled to make connections with others. When introduced to Mike he said, \u201cI have no friends.\u201d Mike replied, \u201cif you would like me to, I would be your friend.\u201d Bill was thrilled about this and for days afterwards would say to staff, \u201cdid you know I have a friend \u2013 have you met my friend Mike?\u201d\n\nMike\u2019s weekly visits to Bill were not easy. Conversations could be heavy and challenging, and Bill could be contrary. Discovering that his hobby had been amateur radio DJ, Mike arranged for equipment so he could take it up again. Boxes arrived at the home and Mike was all ready to help Bill get it set up \u2013 then Bill changed his mind and asked for it all to be sent back so plans Mike and spent so long putting together had to be abandoned. Mike said he felt sad that Bill wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy his old hobby again.\n\nWhere Bill could easily misunderstand others and drive them away, Mike persisted. \u201cVulnerable people need love and persistence,\u201d he said, \u201cand to know that you are genuinely interested in them. They can tell if you\u2019re not.\u201d In December 2018, Bill\u2019s health began to fail. He told Mike that he wanted to know where he was going, and they began conversations that led Bill to Jesus Christ and spiritual peace. Staff in the home noticed how peaceful he was in the last days of his life.\n\nManager Emma noted that, \u201cthis was a special giving: not obvious and in the limelight. It was a willingness to be faithful in being alongside when seemingly little was given back in return. And the result? A man on the edge of society knew that he was valued, and now has eternal life.\u201d\n\nCould you support the work of Pilgrims' Friend Society in helping older people lived fulfilled later lives?

All of this was inspired by the early Christian community, one that was often under difficult circumstances but continued to support each other along the way:\u00a0\n\n\u201cDay by day, as they spent much time together in the temple,\u00a0\nthey broke bread at home and ate their food\u00a0\nwith glad and generous hearts, praising God and\u00a0\nhaving the goodwill of all the people.\u201d \u00a0(Acts 2:46-47a)\n\nWe create a \u201ctemple\u201d of worship in our hearts that connects us across boundaries, distance and time. But as we share this worship, we will stay connected. At the \u201cheart of the matter,\u201d we are connected through the Spirit that makes us one in love.\n\nPlan to join us on Facebook at 10am MT on Sundays for our Livestream worship service. Our scriptures this week are our Pentecost stories (John 7:37-39; Acts 2:1-21\u2014feel free to read ahead of time). We will have lots of music for our online, virtual worship\u2014four original songs by Stevie, plus Pastor Gaye on guitar, and Susan on the organ. Our Dance Party song is\u00a0The River is Here\u00a0which will certainly get you up and dancing. Our Postlude Jam is Rev. Glenn\u2019s favorite Billy Joel song,\u00a0We Didn\u2019t Start the Fire!\n\nWe are inviting everyone to wear something RED for our worship as red is the color for Pentecost! You will also want to have some bread\/cracker and a cup available for our time of Communion together. We will consecrate these elements together through the power of the internet (amazing how God can use anything in our world to bring us together as a community of faith)!\n\nIf you aren\u2019t able to join us live, remember our worship video will be available later on Sunday on our church\u2019s website for your review or to share with others. Look for our \u201cvideos\u201d tab at the top of the website.\n\nWith Health and Wholeness,\n\nPastor Gaye\n\nRev. Gaye Bosley-Mitchell\n\nP.S.

The oracle concerning Judah later comes to a glorious climax in Revelation 5:1-10 as an answer to Jacob's plea in the middle of the oracle as he cries out, \"I wait for your salvation, O LORD\".\u00a0\n\nWe are also waiting and hearing the LORD's word to us and reminded, in Hebrews 2, of our need to respond to that word: \"Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.\" (Hebrews 2:1-4)\n\nAfternoon Service\n\nIn the afternoon, our sermon will be on Colossians 3 which has been selected as this year's Family Visiting Theme. We will consider our calling as believers to live in light of God's wondrous kindness to us in the Son. What are the actions of Adoration that we are to be known for and demonstrate with regularity?",

God reminds us in Isaiah 54:10, \"'For even if the mountains walk away and the hills fall to pieces, My love won't walk away from you, my covenant commitment of peace won't fall apart.'\u00a0The God of compassion says so.\"\n\nThis Thursday, September 1st, First Broad Street United Methodist Church, will join nearly 900 churches within the Holston Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church, for a 24 hour prayer vigil day. Specifically, our Kingsport district churches have been asked to focus our prayers from 5am-6am and from 5pm-6pm.\n\nIf you are able, please consider joining us in the sanctuary on Thursday evening, September 1st at 5:00pm for a special time of prayer.\n\nWhether you are able to join us or not, we ask that you would specifically pray for the following:\n\n  \u2022 Peace to come through the power of the Holy Spirit\n\n  \u2022 The safety and future of the children of South Sudan\n\n  \u2022 The children of Grace and Greenland Homes (our partner children homes)\n\n  \u2022 Rev.

Our challenge from God is the same- that we wouldn't walk away, that we wouldn't simply say \"that's too bad\" and stop there, but that we would become the hands and feet of Jesus Christ and turn our sympathy into prayers and action.",

The weather system had been building and moving across south-east Africa for over a week, causing floods and destruction in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. At least 2.6 million people have been affected. According to the UN it could be the southern hemisphere\u2019s worst ever disaster.\n\nBarnabas Fund has sent\n\n\u00a353,400 ($70,000; \u20ac62,000) for medical aid\n\n\u00a326,700 ($35,000; \u20ac31,000) to feed 12,000 people for a month\n\n\u00a31,900 ($2,500; \u20ac2,200) for 500 body bags\n\nIn Mozambique, around 1.7 million people were in the path of the cyclone, and the president estimates a death toll of 1,000. Countless houses and churches have been damaged; those made of mud have simply disappeared. In the port town of Beira, 90% of the buildings are damaged or destroyed. An Anglican Mozambican bishop has appealed urgently for food, water and shelter as well as mosquito nets to protect the newly homeless from disease.\n\nClearing mud from the roads in Zimbabwe to make them passable for aid vehicles\nClearing mud from the roads in Zimbabwe to make them passable for aid vehicles\n\nIn Zimbabwe, crops were washed away \u2013 a catastrophe in a country that was already in food crisis and expecting a poor harvest in April-May.

It is book that we will read and use together as a church. It has 52 short chapters, one for each week for a year. Each chapter focuses on one foundation verse from the Bible. Going through the book together will give us a solid understanding of the Bible and its teachings.\n\nWe will use the book by setting aside 15 minus a day, five says a week, to read the book and suggested verses. Here is the pattern for the five days.\n\n  1. Day one. You read the key verse and a short devotion about it.\n  2. Day two. You memorize the key verse. You can do it. They are short and you are provided additional helps.\n  3. Day three. Read a story or other passage from the Bible that illustrates the verse of the week.\n  4. Day four. Read and reflect on three other passages related to the verse of the week.\n  5. Day five. Put the verse into practice by completing a simple action step.\n\n15 minutes a day \u2013 5 days a week \u2013 1 year. You will be Bible literate. You will get the Bible in you, it will fill you, and flow out you.\n\nWe are so excited about the book that we are giving it away free to the Community Christian Church family and friends, if you will commit to going through it together with us.\n\nGo to www.cccnyc.org\/core52.

It will take you to a form to fill out so we can get your name and the address where we should send your book.
