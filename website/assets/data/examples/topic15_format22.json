        "text":"When you organize an event or a promotion you always think about the gift with the brand logo for your customers. Choosing is not that easy: they must be useful, original but not too eccentric, linked to the event\u2019s topic or to the Company you are promoting. But today it\u2019s not enough. To convey an excellent opinion of your brand you must show sensitivity to the most discussed issues of the moment, first of all the protection of the environment that surrounds us. Plastic and disposable items, for example, could hurt the sensitivity of those who receive your gift.\n\nFor this reason, eco-friendly promotional items have the absolute priority of choice for the vast majority of Companies.\n\nThe world of ecological promotional items is huge but if you want to give a wide visibility to the logo and your goal is to ensure that the object can be used an infinite number of times, the choice is reduced to shoppers, pouches and backpacks.\n\nFrom here, the search for new fabrics, shapes and types of printing is essential to always propose something original and trendy. Here are some tips on how to orient yourself in choosing the most popular fabrics, among natural and recycled ones.\n\n\nThe demand for items made of biodegradable and recyclable natural fabrics is increasing. In addition to the ecological element, they have other advantages: they can be kept in their natural shade or can be colored, they are resistant and reusable for a long time. Then the ability to print with water-based inks, allows you to create an accessory that really loves the environment. Playing with the sizes and\/or weights of the fabric, also adding some accessories like studs or pom poms, you can get an original solution for any type of promotion.\n\nAccording to their peculiarities, you can choose between different natural fabrics, among the followings:\n\nCanvas: generally made up of cotton fiber, but also hemp or linen, is a strong and ductile material, maybe the most used for the realization of promotional shopping bags. Allows an all over print on the entire surface. It is very beautiful even if left unfinished, so as to bring out its natural color.\n\nJute: wide knitted fabric with rough, rigid and very resistant yarn. Allows logo printing with one or two colors, but not an all over print. There is the possibility to work on the thickness of the yarn, to obtain a very rigid or softer object, depending on the needs.\n\nJuco: textile fiber obtained from a mix of jute and cotton for greater resistance than cotton but with a less rough weft than jute. Smooth surface to the touch allows a more defined print, impossible to obtain with the jute.\n\nBamboo: natural fiber obtained from the bamboo plant, soft to the touch and resistant. As canvas material, it can be customized at will.\n\n\nThen there are items entirely made up of recycled plastic.\n\nThose that since some times ago were mineral water bottles can be transformed into something new that, in an infinite virtuous re-cycle, can become beautiful eco-friendly shopping bags. It is the recycled PET, commonly shortened as RPET.\n\nThe RPET shopping bags, for example, can be of different types and can be adapted to many requests, depends on the print you have to do and the structure you want, if you prefer a soft or rigid bag.\n\nYou can therefore choose between:\n\n  \u2022 RPET non-woven and non-laminated: allows a full color printing with a matt effect and it is soft to touch. The bag built with this type of RPET won\u2019t have a rigid structure.\u00a0\n  \u2022 RPET fabric with matt or glossy laminate: allows any type of high quality printing. The bag you get will have a rigid structure.\n  \u2022 RPET Polyester: it has the same consistency as normal PET polyester. The structure of the bag remains in this case inconsistent and lends itself to be folded becoming pocket.\n\nThe other material used for a long time but still very much in demand is the NON-WOVEN.\n\nNON-WOVEN is a recycled and recyclable material like RPET (both are obtained from polypropylene through a thermoplastic pressing process) and like this, it can be subjected to a process of \u201clamination\u201d glossy or matt, to obtain a more elegant product with brighter colors.\n\nBoth fabrics are washable, affordable and have a considerable resistance to weight, making it ideal for their use in the non-woven shopping bags production.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to you, make the best choice for your brand! The best web site to be visited for this kind of solutions is HiGift: it contains over 5.000 promotional items ready to be customized. And if you need instead a tailor-made product you can contact GadgetLab that is dedicated exclusively to big production and import of promotional items from South-East Asia. Just take a look!",

The followings are the tips for operating coal ash ultra fine grinding machine:\n\nNotes of daily maintenance about HGM series medium speed mill machine:\n1. Check the bags of bag filter frequently, so as to avoid block of bags, which will decrease air flowing volume of blower and affect the production.\n2. Check every fastener frequently to ensure they are firm and reliable all the time to avoid accident.\n3. Ensure all connections of air ducts are sealed tightly to avoid of leakage.\n4. Prior to installation of the equipment, the person who will be assigned to operate the equipment have to be technically trained to know how the principle and rules of operation. Someone should be specifically selected and put in charge of the operation.\n5. To ensure nor mal operation of the equipment, a manual of safe operation rules and procedures for equipment operation should be well prepared and followed. Maintenance tools, spare parts, lubricating oil and grease must be available for immediate use.\n6. After 800 hours\u2019 running in total, the equipment should be checked and repaired. Replace the worn-and torn parts such as rollers, rings to ensure smooth operation.\n7. It is benefit to lubricate each oil site according to the requirement of lubrication system.\n8. It is a normal phenomenon that cracks might appear in the ring after it is work off to a certain extent; you should replace it in time.\n9. Remove the ash on blower impeller periodically to ensure blower running smoothly.\n10. Remove the ash on muffler periodically to avoid high resistance on the air flow in the grinding plant.\n11. Check bag filter periodically, if there is broken bag, change it in time to avoid pollution.\n12. The discharging valve under the bottom of oil-water filter should discharge water 2-4 times every 8 hours.\n13. The drain valve on the air tank of air compressor should discharge oil-water once every day. If working environment is in high humidity, it should discharge oil-water once every 4 hours.\n14. The filter element on air cleaner is a wearing part; it needs to be changed every 150 days. If working environment is bad, the filter element changing time needs to be shortened.\n15. For air compressor, lubrication oil needs to be changed 100 hours after initial use, from then on once every 1000 hours. The interval of changing grease should be shortened if the operational environment is not good.\n16. Oil needs to be added to each-fill point as required. Lubricate the main unit and the bearing of the classifier once every 3 days. It is allowed without stopping the medium speed mill machine.\n\n\nShare this artical:",

        "text":"Farm scale production report \u2013 Waiuku\n\nBiochar from sawmill waste\n\nWe have a small woodlot of eucalyptus, black walnut and Australian Blackwood. The trees have not been pruned or thinned recently and there were five large (20m) pine trees overshadowing some areas. Storms and natural die off as well as the lack of thinning meant that there has and is plenty of timber to take out and find a use for.\n\nSick of cutting it all up for fire wood, we bought a small portable sawmill in late 2018. One unanticipated outcome of this was the large volume of \u2018waste\u2019 wood that milling creates. Some trees have such poor form that yield is only 20% of the log in milled timber. The rest is long thin strips, often too thin to bother cutting for firewood and too much work to run through a chipper for mulch.\n\nSo what to do with this timber? How about biochar?\nA flame cap pit burn has been the method of choice because it allows long lengths to be used and holes are cheap. We can also dig a shallow pit relatively easily with the blade on the tractor making it the length of the scrap timber so I don\u2019t have to cut anything to length.\n\nC&P from Cam Smith\u2019s FB post @ Biochar Opportunities in NZ\n\nWe find a spot close, but not too close, to the scrap timber pile. Ideally the timber has dried for a few months but only the early part of the burn needs to be really dry. You need to be away from hedges and other potential fire risks.\n\nWe do all of our burns in winter, which makes for much more pleasant working conditions and reduces the fire risk. The ideal day would have little or no wind and of there was wind it would be away from close neighbours and the road. Local roads have been closed several times in the last few years by smoke from bonfires close to the road (not by me, though!)\nMake sure you have a large volume of fire fighting water. We have a 40mm hose nearby that can put out just about anything. We have also used IBC containers of water to quench in the past if we are out of hose reach. It is too late to organise this at the end or if there are problems. Do it in the beginning.\n\nA small fire lit in the bottom of the pit with dry timber gets thing going. Then slowly add larger dry pieces. Once it is well alight you can add larger and wetter timber, but freshly cut timber, being soaking wet, will make for a smoky, difficult burn so is not suitable in any volume. Very large pieces will not always fully burn down to embers so may need to be taken out at the end and added to the next burn. Do not use timber with nails, paint or chemically treated. You will likely end up with contaminated biochar.\n\nEach time you see ash forming on the embers, add more parallel pieces of timber. The pit will soon be full of embers. When you run out of timber, time or enthusiasm, completely fill the pit with water. Any reasonable pile of embers not completely doused can have enough energy to dry the pile and restart the fire, so do a good job of this.\nThe next day you can shovel out the charcoal from the pit, unless you didn\u2019t put it out properly in which case you will just have ash! It may still be quite warm so another go with the hose won\u2019t hurt.\nDepending on the size of the pit, you may have a cubic meter of charcoal at this point.\n\nThanks Cam (Ed)\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Collapse of trenches can be very harmful, and has resulted in moderate to severe injuries.\n\nAny trench deeper than 1200mm (4 feet) MUST be properly shored up.\n\n\nDo NOT take risks!\n\n  \u2022 Do not to have trenches open for any longer than necessary.\n  \u2022 Use barrier fencing and\/or security barriers to keep children and members of the public out of excavations.\n  \u2022 Try not to have trenches open in inclement weather.\n  \u2022 Try not to have trenches open too far in advance of pipe-laying.\n  \u2022 Keep trench width to a minimum (generally pipe diameter plus 300mm).\n  \u2022 Always stand at least 600mm back from the edge of open trenches.\n  \u2022 Never work alone in a trench \u2013 always have a \u2018buddy\u2019 or preferably a banksman.\n\nDo NOT take risks\n\n\n\n\n\n1- Unloading Trucks: Pipes are to be checked on unloading. Possible damages must be reported immediately. Checking can be done by using white powder.\n\ncraneUse a Crane or Excavator: When removing, lifting belts must be placed outside around the pallets & outside of the base timber.\n\nCarefully, Steer the pallets manually to prevent them colliding with anything. Pallets should not be moved using any levers or crowbars while on the truck. Pipes should not be subjected to any hard impact.\n\n\nPackagingUse a Forklift: The pallets of pipes should be placed transversely on the forks & the forks should be positioned sufficiently widely apart.\n\nWhen placing the pallets on the forklift, a protective piece of timber should be between the parcel and the forks base for a smooth transition.\n\n\n2- Storage on Site: Pipes should not be placed on hard ground with force. There must be sufficient space between individual pallets. Sealing elements can be saved from damage by setting them down on a leveled surface and off the floor by using a piece of wood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3- Transportation to Pipe Trench: It is preferred to move the whole pallets to the point of destination where they will be laid before opening or dismantling the pallets.\nThe parcel of pipes must be carefully place on a flat surface so that the pipes don\u2019t slip or have a damaging impact when unloading.\n\nTransport individual pipes with belts (mark on crown \u2013 yellow or white spot = center of gravity\u2013 pipe hangs level).\n\n\n\n\nIndividual pipes must not be transported in excavator shovel; belts are a more secure method.\n\n\n\n\n\n4- Installation: Both ends of the pipe should be checked optically and internally with white talcum powder to find any cracks that might have occurred before they pipe are laid in the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npaint_markThe paint mark must always point upwards.\n\nThe pipe inverts will be at level (any steps that might arise between two pipes will be within the permissible tolerance)\n\n\nvarianceA possible small variance between two jointed pipes in the axial line will not lie in the flow zone (any small deviation of straightness will lay aside)\n\n\n\nlubricant_pipeThe shape of the seals enables pre-centering to be carried out. First lubricant should be applied to the spigot and to the socket seal.\n\n\n\nshort_pipeShort lengths of the pipes should be used at points where differences in settling are to be expected, e.g. in the region of the shafts or at the wall breakthroughs, to produce flexible connections.\n\n\n\nPushing the pipes together with the crane bucket and a belt (\u2265 DN 400mm).\n\nlay_correctCorrect way\n\nPushing the pipes together with a crowbar \u2013 always have a piece of timber between the pipe and the crowbar.\n\n\n\nlay_wrongWrong way\n\nIt\u2019s not recommended to push against the pipe with the excavator shovel to make any corrections in the axial line.\n\n\n\nIn a normal practice, the sockets will point in the upside direction and the pipes should be installed in the center-line of the trench.\n\n5- Excavation & Compaction:\n\nFor the minimum required width of the trench (on accordance with nominal size and depth of laying), refer to EN 1610 for the laying of sewer pipes.\n\nA trench that is too narrow makes it difficult to compact the bedding zone properly. A trench that is too wide increases the laying costs and both increase the loading on the pipe.\n\nMinimum trench width for security reasons are mentioned in the table below. To reach good compaction results the specifier might precise larger trench widths.\n\nMinimum trench width, in relation to DN and in relation to depth.\n\nSocket holes must be made so that the sockets do not lie on a compacted bottom; this would result in point loading. Support must be provided over the whole barrel length.\n\n\n\n\n\nbackfillingBetween the trench bottom and pipe a bedding angle of at least 90\u02da must be realized with materials that can be compacted well.\n\nThe backfilling directly above the pipe and to a width equal to the outside diameter of the pipe should be compacted by hand where need be.\n\nMechanical compaction of the main backfill directly above the pipe should not be commenced until there is a total depth of cover of at least 300 mm above the top of the pipe. This layer must consist of stone-free soil.\n\n\n90degree-2The selection of the compacting device, the number of passes and the thickness of the layer to be compacted should match the back material.\n\nIf the layer above the pipe is inadequately thick (less than 30 cm), do not move the compactor over the pipeline.\n\nWhen compacting at the sides of the trench, kindly ensure that the compactor does not contact the pipes. Similarly, do not run the compactor over the pipes.",

To ensure optimum performance in the long run, you need to be 100% confident that your staff can safely operate and properly maintain the equipment, and that any problems will be identified and resolved in a timely manner. In partnership with your original equipment manufacturer (OEM), you should focus on two key aspects: staff training and preventive maintenance, which includes spare parts management.\n\n\nIf you think that your operators and maintenance staff need only one week of training to handle a new machine, consider this: Our expert service technicians receive one full year of training. And if your current equipment is older, expect a sea change in safety requirements\u2014and a very steep learning curve.\n\nThe exact amount of initial training required depends on various factors. Here are some of the questions you should ask yourself:\n\n  \u2022 How comfortable\/experienced is our staff?\n  \u2022 Is our staff well aware of the latest safety features and procedures?\n  \u2022 Is this our first automated\/robotic machine?\n\nMost importantly, do not forget to invest in train-the-trainer programs. This is often overlooked, but you will need people on-site to teach new hires and provide ongoing refresher training.\n\n\nEvery plant should have an annual maintenance schedule. Why? Because it will keep your equipment in tip-top condition for optimum performance. Annual preventive maintenance also reduces downtime\u2014saving you a tremendous amount of time and money.\n\nMake sure to check the equipment several times a year, follow the maintenance checklists, keep the operation manual right next to the equipment for easy reference, and always have a spare-parts kit on hand. (Ideally, you should purchase a spare-parts kit prior to installation.)\n\n\nYour OEM can help you with your new equipment in several ways.\n\nService agreement: Follow-up visits can be scheduled, preferably before installation. For instance, your service agreement could include the following:\n\nHelp desk: Your OEM most likely provides technical assistance. The help desk staff is there for you. If you let them know about the problems you are experiencing, they can assist you and forward your feedback to the product improvement team. They may even be able to connect to your equipment remotely to solve problems.\n\nYour OEM\u2019s Client Services team is dedicated to client success. Its job is to make your life easier and to help you take ownership of your equipment. Sharing information with that team and committing to proper training and maintenance will be crucial as you familiarize yourself with your new equipment.\n\nB\u00e0i k\u1ebf ti\u1ebfp",

You will be asked some basic questions such as What are you planning to do? Where are you planning to do it?, advised of any requirements, and if necessary, referred to other departments for their approval. The code official will provide you with the resources and information needed for compliance with the applicable building codes. You will then receive an application for a building permit.\n\nSubmit Application\n\nAt this stage you will document the \u201cWho, What, When, Where, and How\u201d of the job, along with any sketches or plans of the proposed work.\n\nReview Process\n\nIn a brief amount of time, the code official will review your plans and determine if your project is in compliance with local requirements. If your plans meet these requirements, a permit is issued. If not, the code official may suggest solutions to help correct the problem.\n\nReceive Permit\n\nNow that you have been approved for a permit, you have legal permission to start construction. A fee, based on the size of the job, is collected to cover the cost of the application, the review, and the inspection process. An experienced code official is available to you should you have any questions concerning your project. You should consider your code official as an ally who will help you make your project a success. Separate permits are typically required for electrical, plumbing, and heating or air conditioning work.\n\nJob Site Visits\n\nOn-site inspections will be required to make certain the work conforms to the permit, local codes, and plans. Again, you will have access to the expertise of the code official to help you with questions or concerns regarding the project and to minimize potentially costly mistakes. The code official will let you know approximately how many inspections may be needed for your project. Usually, a one- or two-day notice is needed when requesting visits.\n\nFinal Approval\n\nThe code official will provide documentation when construction is complete and code compliance is determined. You will then have the personal satisfaction of a job done right. Enjoy your new surroundings with the peace of mind and the knowledge that they meet the safety standards in your community.\n\nIt takes everyone in a community to keep our homes, schools, offices, stores, and other buildings safe for public use. Your safe construction practices help protect you, your family, your friends, and your investment.

        "text":"How to Start A Small Scale Fish Farming Business\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure you would have seen quite a lot of information and tutorials about starting your own fish farm, but you rarely get all the facts from them. That\u2019s why we are here for you.\nFish farming is one of the most successful agribusiness in Nigeria. It used to be quite difficult back in the days,but thanks to modern technology, things have gotten a lot more easier.\nFish Farming is also another compatible farming with Poultry Farming (you can read up on how to start your own poultry farm here) .\n\nWhy fish farming? Here are a few reasons why:\na. Fish is extremely popular and high in protein\nb. Fish sells quick\nc. Fish mature quickly\nd. Fish Farming is profitable\ne. No environmental hazards\nThere are a few risks involved in fish farming. Some of them include:\na. It being sensitive to manage\nb. Capital Intensive\nc. No by products\n\nNow let\u2019s get in to it. Here are the things you need to start fish farming\n\n1. Get a land\nTo start a Fish Farm, first and foremost, you need to secure a land. The best part of fish farming is that you can get any kind of land, even in a residential area. Look for a piece of land that is cheap or you can also use your backyard.\n\n2. Construct a pond\nThere are two basic types of ponds: Earthen and Concrete. Concrete ponds are definitely more expensive. If you are going with a concrete pond, ensure the plumbing work is properly done. For an earthen pond, ensure there is a constant source of clean water that flows through the pond.\n\n3. Get a good source of water.\nIt\u2019s as simple as it sounds. You need to ensure that the water your fishes will be swimming in is neat and doesn\u2019t contain toxins. This can cause serious harm to your fishes.\n\n4. Get Your Fish\nWhen you want to get your fish, ensure you are getting a high yield specie of the fish and always ensure you are getting it from a healthy farm.\n\n5. Get Trained\nYou may have heard from several people how simple fish farming is, but don\u2019t take their word for it. Trial and error is not something you want to do in any business. So get attached to a fish farm for proper apprenticeship.\n\nFish farming is definitely amongst the most lucrative businesses, but ensure you get it right. You will need good management skills and follow the acceptable standard.\n\nAdd Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *\n\n\nHome grown, world known...",

        "text":"How To Master Hydraulic Troubleshooting\n\nhydraulic simulation softwareTroubleshooting is an inferential process. So to become an effective troubleshooter, you must have a solid PROCESS. But you also need relevant KNOWLEDGE. Consider the old Indian Monkey Trap, for example:\n\nThe trap consists of a hollowed-out coconut chained to a stake. The coconut contains rice which can be accessed through a hole in the coconut\u2019s shell. The hole is just big enough to allow the monkey to get its hand in, but too small for the monkey\u2019s clenched fist, full of rice, to come out.\n\nThe monkey reaches in, grabs a handful of rice and finds himself trapped. The villagers are coming to get him\u2026 They\u2019re getting closer every minute\u2026 The monkey panics and starts yanking on his arm. But it\u2019s no use.\n\nThe monkey\u2019s freedom is now totally dependent on his troubleshooting ability. And his troubleshooting ability depends on the process he uses \u2013 because the monkey doesn\u2019t understand how the trap works. He lacks essential knowledge. And without a reliable process he\u2019s got little chance of discovering this knowledge. So he may as well keep yanking on his arm.\n\n\nYou need \u2019em both to become a reliable and effective troubleshooter. And both have to be learnt. Which is why the man who can cast his eye over a hydraulic machine and quickly zero-in on the fault is \u2018Top-Gun\u2019 in the hydraulics world.\n\nHe\u2019s admired by most. Envied by many.\n\nThe good news is, it\u2019s never been easier to join the ranks of this elite and highly-paid group. Because just as hydraulic systems are becoming more sophisticated, so too are the tools available to analyze and troubleshoot them. These days in fact, with the right tools and tuition, you can slash the time is used to take to become a troubleshooting wizard. I demonstrate this here with an instructive video.\n\nWith limited knowledge AND no reliable process, the monkey\u2019s situation is hopeless. If only he knew how simple it was to secure his freedom. (Hint: all he has to do is employ the troubleshooting technique known as backing-out).\n\nUnfortunately, failing to follow proven principles when troubleshooting usually results in costly mistakes. And to discover six other costly mistakes you want to be sure to avoid with your hydraulic equipment, get \u201cSix Costly Mistakes Most Hydraulics Users Make\u2026 And How You Can Avoid Them!\u201d available for FREE download here.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Shut Down Pumps and Weight Up Mud in Driller\u2019s Method\n\nAfter kick has been circulated out of the well, the mud pumps can be shut down and the well must be secured. While shutting down the pumps, it is a good practice to gradually close the choke instead of suddenly shut in.\n\nYou must keep in mind that while shutting down pumps, you must keep casing pressure constant achieved by manipulating the choke. This procedure is to ensure that constant bottom hole pressure is maintained during the shutdown.\n\nThe shut-in casing pressure and the shut-in drill pipe pressure should be equal after complete the first circulation of the driller\u2019s method. After shutdown pumps, the Shut In Casing Pressure (SICP) and the Shut In Drill pipe Pressure (SIDP) should be equal to the initial shut-in drill pipe pressure observed at the first time. If SICP and SIDP are the same but they are more than the initial shut-in drill pipe pressure, there is possibly trapped pressure on top of SICP.\n\nIf you see that the casing pressure is still higher than the drillpipe pressure, this situation means there is still some kick in the annulus or another kick was possibly taken while circulating. If you see this situation, you must do an additional circulation to ensure that there is no influx left in the well before kill weight fluid is mixed and pumped.\n\nAfter you ensure that there is no influx in the well, you need to weight up the active pits to desired kill weight fluid.\n\nKill weight fluid is calculated by the following equation.\n\nKill mud weight = original mud weight + (Initial Shut In Drill Pipe Pressure \u00f7 (0.052 x TVD of the well)\n\nLearn about well control formulas here !!!\n\nThe ideal condition is to maintain a reasonably low active volume because when the mud is circulated out of the hole, you will have room to weight up without having to stop circulating. At least, you should have enough volume to displace entire volume with kill weight mud.\n\nReference book: Well Control Books\n\nTagged , .

The size, design and appearance of the booth must be perfect and meet the competition standards, so that the company can stand out in the exhibition hall. A successful booth construction is not so gorgeous, but how big its propaganda is, the corporate culture it expresses and the functionality and connotation of the exhibits.\n\nSo, what effect should the booth construction achieve? In short, it is to make the visitors look comfortable and sound, and fully mobilize the audience's emotions. Good booth design can help and strengthen the position of exhibiting companies and their products in the market, which requires two points in design:\n\nFirst, the designed booth mode and display content are recognized by the audience as soon as possible.\n\nSecond, we must let the booth highlight the corporate culture and corporate image.\n\nTo achieve these two goals, the booth must be creative, and this creativity is not only reflected in the design ideas, but also needs to be reflected through the display tools.\n\nIn recent years, people's awareness of environmental protection has become higher and higher, and it is also a good way to build booths with system components. System components are more malleable, do not require a lot of manpower, and can easily turn a very unique design into reality, which can win a lot of time and reduce costs. Its advantage is: because the pre-production does not require a lot of manpower, so the price is reasonable; easy to transport and store, the installation can be very fine, saving a lot of manpower and material costs.\n\nIn short, while ensuring the effectiveness, calculate the economic account and use new and reusable booth materials whenever possible.",

        "text":"Cutting concrete can be a labour intensive process, depending on the kind of tools that you use. If you are used to cutting cement using a chisel then working with any form of concrete will be a rude awakening, and cutting large amounts of concrete will definitely surprise you.\n\nCutting concrete by hand is very, very hard work. Most people prefer to use a power splitter or a power saw instead to save time and energy.\n\ngrinding machine with sparks\n\nUsing the Right Tool for the Job\n\nThere are a few different tools that you can use to cut concrete blocks, and the tool you choose will depend on the material you are working with.\n\nIf you are working with pressed concrete flags you will probably want to use a power saw for fast, neat cuts.\n\nIf you are using wet cast flags then you should definitely stay away from hand tools because the characteristics of the material mean that you will end up struggling to cut through it and may find that the finish is ugly. Again, power saws are a good choice but you might need to hand trim the finished cut for neatness.\n\nCutting massive concrete blocks is best done with a splitter. Big blocks will need a hydraulic splitter. Concrete tends to kick up a lot of dust when it is cut, so you should make an effort to suppress the dust, and to wear protective clothing as well.\n\nWorking with Power Saws\n\nThere are a few different kinds of power saw. The hand-held cut-off saw is good for working with concrete slabs. Thicker, heavier concrete is best cut using a diamond tipped blade. These blades are usually used as part of a wet cutting process, where the blade is cooled with a constant stream of water and the slurry of dust and water is then collected by a vacuum cleaner.\n\nThere are, however, some diamond blades that can be used as part of a dry cutting process. However, if you do use a dry cut blade make sure that you wear a respirator and goggles so that you don\u2019t get dust in your eyes, or inhale dust which could cause respiratory problems.\n\nBlocks and Splitters\n\nBlocks and splitters are the best thing to use to cut massive concrete blocks. They are relatively easy to use, and generate less dust than a power saw. In addition, they have very few moving parts so they are easy to maintain and less likely to cause injury to an inexperienced operator.\n\nSplitters come in a range of sizes, and can be used to cut concrete blocks from as small as 25mm all the way up to massive blocks that are far too large to use a power saw on.\n\nThere are three different kinds of splitters:\n\n  \u2022 Manually operated splitters,which are designed to be used to cut small paving slabs;\n  \u2022 More advanced manually operated splitters with individual toothed blades that are good for cutting slabs with irregular surfaces; and\n  \u2022 Hydraulic splitters,which are best for cutting massive concrete blocks\n\nAll of the varieties of splitters work by squeezing the block between two blades, putting pressure on the slabs until the slab snaps \u2013 hopefully cleanly, along the line of the blades.\n\nSometimes splitters can go wrong causing the block to shatter, but this usually only happens if you are working with low quality blocks or blocks that have a lot of air bubbles in them.\n\nThere are chain-saw style concrete cutting blades, and these can be used to cut into concrete to make square corners with no overcut. These are a good choice if you need to make a cut that is more precise than the kind that you can achieve with a block splitter.\n\nDepending on the work you are doing you will need a few different kinds of concrete cutting tools. In addition to the tools you will need to invest in high quality safety equipment.\n\nYou should try to cover as much of your skin as possible, because repeated exposure to dust can cause dermatitis. In addition, you should wear eye protection and a good mask. Do not skimp on protective gear, because it takes just one mistake to cause serious injury.",

Are you using the proper hoist ring for the application?\n\n2. Is the hoist ring free to swivel and pivot? Are there any movement restrictions?\n\n3. Are lifting hole(s) in the proper location\n\n4. Do you have the correct hole size for the hardware \u2013 safe lift capacity?\n\n5. Are the holes tapped deep enough to assure full thread engagement?\n-Recommended hole depth for steel: 1.5xbolt diameter\n-Recommended hole depth for aluminum: 2xbolt diameter\n\n\n\nApplied Load Changes with Sling Angle\nJergens hoist rings are designed and rated to be pulled at any angle at the rated load. However, the applied load on a multipoint lift will increase if the sling angle is less than 90 degrees. So be sure to consider the sling angle when selecting lifting equipment.

        "text":"\u2022 April 29, 2021\n\nWhat to Think About Before Starting a Construction Company\n\nThe construction industry is one that, when done in the right way with plenty of thought and planning, can be very profitable indeed, and this could be why a lot of people like the idea of opening up their own construction business. Yet there is a lot to think about before you do this; we did say that it could be profitable when done right, and ensuring you are doing it right is crucial.\n\nRather than simply taking your experience as a contractor working for someone else and incorporating that into your business \u2013 a practice that won\u2019t work because you\u2019ll be missing out on essential elements \u2013 you\u2019ll need to take your time and think carefully about exactly what you\u2019re going to need to know and do before you launch. In that way, you can be sure that you\u2019re making the right choice. Working in construction is one thing, but running a business in the construction industry is something else entirely. Read on to find out what you need to know and do before making any commitments.\n\nLicenses and Permits\n\nA contractor can\u2019t just start work on someone\u2019s property \u2013 they will need to have the correct licenses and permits in place to ensure they are skilled, trained, and experienced. Without these permits, you could find yourself in a lot of trouble. Not only that, but you may not get as much work as you need to survive; customers are sure to ask to see the licenses you have, and if you can\u2019t provide them, they will take their work elsewhere.\n\nThe requirements for licensing are many and varied, and it can even depend on what state you\u2019re in as to exactly what you need. Therefore, it will pay to do as much research as you can so that you know you\u2019re applying for the correct licenses and permits, and that you do it in the right way.\n\nOffice Location\n\nIn this modern era of home and remote working, you might not have considered that you\u2019ll need an office. However, although it would technically be possible to run a construction company from home, it is far better to have a dedicated office for it. This is because you will have various contractors working for you, and they will need a hub to plan their work together and meet up to get to their projects. Unless you have a separate office, they will be coming to your home, which might be inconvenient and will certainly feel chaotic. Plus, clients might need to come to you to discuss the work that needs to be done. Again, although home working is considered normal, it\u2019s not necessarily the way you want your clients to see you.\n\nOn top of that, you\u2019ll need to think of storage. As a construction business, you\u2019ll have many tools, equipment, and materials that will need to be kept somewhere. An office with a warehouse attached will work perfectly.\n\nHealth and Safety Requirements\n\nThe construction industry requires some of the strictest adherence to health and safety rules and laws out of everything. This is because the chances of an accident occurring are deemed to be much higher than in other industries. When you are starting your own construction company, you\u2019ll need to be completely aware of all the health and safety requirements that relate to what you\u2019re doing, whether that be linked to equipment, materials used, working practices, who you can hire, where you can work, or anything else.\n\nThere are many rules to consider, but each will need to be followed precisely to keep you, your employees, members of the public, and your business safe. Remember, you can be fined, your business closed, or you might even be imprisoned if something happens and you weren\u2019t following the rules, so learning them and putting plans in place to ensure you meet with them is crucial for everyone\u2019s peace of mind.\n\n\nAlthough as we\u2019ve said it\u2019s best to follow the rules and have processes in place to minimize the risk of an accident happening or mistake being made, sometimes they will happen anyway. As long as you were doing all you were meant to be doing, you probably don\u2019t have to worry about the legal side of things, but there will still be many costs associated with fixing these errors, which is why insurance is important. If you had to pay for repairs or medical bills or anything else yourself, your business might have to close.\n\nAs well as being there as an added level of protection for you, your insurance will show your clients that you are taking all the proper precautions and help them know that, should something go wrong, you can make it right again. With insurance, you\u2019ll get a lot more work because the public will be happy to use you, knowing they are protected.\n\nA pretty interesting post, huh?\n\nSubscribe now to be informed of any new posts like this one via email\n\nLatest from the Blog\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"6 September 2002\n\nHow to get the best from novel grassweed killers controller\n\nIn the first of a fresh\n\nseries of baseline articles,\n\nwe find out how to get\n\nthe best from Crystal\n\nor Ice (flufenacet +\n\npendimethalin) herbicide\n\nFOR good results on difficult blackgrass and ryegrass Crystal users must observe a few simple application rules, says manufacturer BASF.\n\nThe first point to remember is to use it at the pre-emergence timing, advises the firms technical business manager Rob Gladwin.\n\n\"That means within 10 days of drilling. If the crop is germinating, you can be sure that the blackgrass is too.\n\n\"As soon as you have drilled, the clock is ticking. That may mean prioritising fields, making sure that you drill difficult areas last and then fitting in spraying. At emergence, its not uncommon for blackgrass to beat wheat out of the ground.\"\n\nMr Gladwins also advises using 4 litres\/ha dose. \"Dont go down to 3 litres\/ha or you may well be disappointed with the results. The extra litre makes quite a difference.\"\n\nSeed-beds are important, as is depth of drilling, he adds. \"If the crop is shallow drilled and seed-bed conditions are bad, then theres always a chance that youll affect the crop.\"\n\nDrilling depth needs to be a minimum of 32mm and clod size must be less than 3cm. \"You need a good tilth and the seed must be covered up.\n\n\"Dry, cobbly power harrow beaten seed-beds arent going to give the best results or maintain crop safety, nor are compacted seed-beds.\"\n\nLast year, the first of commercial Crystal use, drilling depth proved more critical than the type of drill used, says Mr Gladwin. \"The issue is to make sure you drill to a reasonable depth.\"\n\nThe interval between pre-emergence application and the follow-up post-em spray must be tight. \"Go on again as soon as the blackgrass is through.\"\n\nWhere a Stomp\/Lexus (pendimethalin\/flupyrsulfuron-methyl) mix is intended as the follow-up, it should be applied no later than the weeds two true leaves stage. \"Once blackgrass gets to the three true leaves stage, it starts to tiller and control will be reduced. Dont wait for it to recover from the pre-em treatment. Hit it again while it is vulnerable.\"\n\nThis particular follow-up programme has given the best results in trials, he adds.\n\nFor ryegrass, the timing message is the same, but the products applied post-em will be different. \"Chlorotoluron used alone has done well, but the addition of Stomp will be needed with high or problem populations.\"\n\nUsing Crystal will cost about \u00a332\/ha (\u00a313\/acre) and should give 70% control of blackgrass, says Mr Gladwin. \"In combination with other control measures, it has a major role to play with difficult blackgrass and ryegrass.\n\n\"Many growers wont have the same experience of resistant ryegrass as they do with blackgrass, but the key points are the same.\"\n\n1 Timing Use pre-em, spray as soon as possible after drilling and ideally within 10 days.\n\n2 Rate BASF recommends 4 litres\/ha, but distributors believe 3 litres\/ha sufficient if timing is good.\n\n3 Seed-bed conditions Clods must be less than 3cm, a good tilth is required.\n\n4 Drilling depth Drill to a minimum depth of 32mm. Seed must be buried.\n\n5 Crop damage Occurred only with shallow drilling and poor seed-beds last year. Heavy rainfall after application can make it worse.\n\n6 Follow-up spray Keep interval tight for blackgrass. Spray again by two true leaves.\n\n7 Brome control Makes a good start to brome control programmes, especially sterile brome.\n\n8 Annual meadow grass Use 2 litres\/ha and mix with IPU, spray at 2-3 leaves.\n\n9 Ryegrass Excellent results on resistant ryegrass with 3 litres\/ha, follow-up with CTU or CTU\/IPU.\n\n10 Cost About \u00a332\/ha for 4 litres\/ha.\n\nCareful attention to seed-beds and drilling depth is important to allow flufenacet-based products to work well and avoid crop damage.\n\nIce advice from the distributor\n\nDrill and spray is the advice from Dalgetys technical manager Bob Bulmer, when it comes to using Ice \u2013 the trade name for Crystal marketed by Dalgety.\n\n\"Spray as soon as youve drilled,\" he says. \"It doesnt need much moisture to work and theres a steep decline in control as application is delayed.\"\n\nSeed-bed conditions are important and any resulting crop damage is made worse by heavy rainfall after application, says Dr Bulmer.\n\n\"Cloddy seed-beds are out and the seed must be well buried. A key decision with the use of this product is whether the seed-bed is suitable.\"\n\nIce is a good start for brome control programmes, especially sterile brome, as well as being the best choice for annual meadow-grass, he adds.\n\n\"And weve had fantastic results on resistant ryegrass. In one trial we had 100% control from a single application.\n\n\"But as ryegrass germinates over a longer period than the other grassweeds, its important to follow-up with chlorotoluron or a CTU\/IPU mix.\"\n\nFor blackgrass and brome, he recommends a rate of 3-4 litres\/ha. \"The 3 litres\/ha rate is adequate where your spray timing is good. And 3 litres is enough for ryegrass.\"\n\nFor annual meadow grass, the advice is different. \"Apply Ice at 2 litres\/ha post-emergence, at the two to three leaves stage, and include a low dose of IPU.\"\n\nDr Bulmer believes that Ice is better on blackgrass, ryegrass and annual meadow grass than the alternative pre-em herbicides. \"Only where there are mixed populations of wild oats and blackgrass would I advocate switching to Avadex.\" &#42",

Rewinder structure and working principle\nThe rewinder is a paper roll produced by a paper machine, which is slit, finished, and re-rolled into a roll paper or other type of paper with a certain width and length and tightness to meet the printing memory package. Industrial needs. The performance of the rewinding machine will affect the output of the entire paper machine production line.\nThe rewinding machine has many forms. According to the nature of the reel, the rewinding machine can be divided into a shaft rewinding machine and a shaftless rewinding machine: according to different rotation modes, it can be divided into single motor transmission and double motor rotation. In this paper, we are transforming a double-bottom roll-feeding rewinding machine, each of which has its own motor drive.\n\nOpp Tape\n\nBelt rewinding machine design and working principle ---\n\n1 belt roller device\nThe belt and stick set consists of two belt rollers with intermediate and end supports! A rubber support belt surrounds the belt roller. The inner surface of the support belt has a guiding profile that controls the operation of the belt. There is also a correspondingly concave surface on the belt roller. The belt roller has been joined together by a rocker and a hydraulic cylinder from below. The belt tension can be adjusted with a hydraulic cylinder during the winding process.\nThe motor drives the rear belt roller to run, and the other roller is carried by the belt. The belt roller is equipped with a hydraulic brake system. The belt roller bearing housing is lubricated with lubricating oil. The oil flow and temperature of the lubricating oil system are detected by the sensor. There is a directional blow tube between the two rolls to ensure that no space remains in the space between the two rolls. The lifting device has been installed under the belt. The lifting device is used for changing rolls. The lifting device comprises a hydraulic cylinder and a lifting plate interlocked with the rear bottom roller during the lifting process.\nBelt roller unit:\n1- bottom roller\n2- rear belt roller\n3- front belt roller\n4- belt\n5-belt telescopic hydraulic cylinder\n\nPrinciple of operation\nThe core is placed between the back bottom roll and the back belt roll. The paper core is supported at that position throughout the initial crimping process up to a diameter of approximately 500 mm (17.9 in). The over 500 mm (17.9 in) belt begins to support the increasing area of ??the paper roll, and the weight of the roll is reached when the paper roll is particularly large. Mainly supported by a belt.\n\n\nZhengzhou EAST IMPORT AND EXPORT co., ltd .
