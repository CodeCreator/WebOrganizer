For more information, see our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nGORE's sustainability approach\n\nBill & Vieve Gore\n\nSustainability is an integral part of our culture and business.\n\nFor us sustainability means being fair and responsible to people and the environment while offering products which provide best-in-class performance. We strive to continually improve the social and environmental impact of our products and processes without compromising their performance.\n\nThis is the legacy of our founders Bill and Vieve Gore and we are proud to continue this tradition.\n\nProduct Responsibility\n\nGORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae are committed to producing apparel that delivers what we promise and is of highest quality. We want our customers to value and love our GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae products, and enjoy their functionality for a long time, which is an effective way to reduce the environmental footprint of function apparel.\n\nWe carefully select the fabrics we use. The choice of fabrics, materials, methods of production, dyes and transport conditions are all taken into consideration prior to the manufacture of our products. To ensure optimal protection and performance our products are field or lab tested for their durability, appearance and quality after washes and impact (e.g. washing-, rubbing-, color fastness).\n\nProduct responsibility\n\nAll GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae products meet the criteria of the Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100. Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100 is an external, independent certification system for for textile raw materials, intermediate and finished products and is the most used product safety label worldwide.\n\nProduct responsibility\n\nAdditionally, Gore has been working with the bluesign\u00ae standard since 2010 to verify the safety of its products. The emphasis we place on quality extends to our suppliers and manufacturers. Accordingly, Gore carries out continuous external quality controls at production facilities and encourages its suppliers to obtain a bluesign\u00ae certification in order to reduce environmental impacts in our supply chain.\n\nAn increasing number of GORE-TEX\u00ae and WINDSTOPPER\u00ae fabrics are already certified. In our GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae collections we predominantly use certified fabrics.\n\nProduct responsibility\n\nSocial Responsibility\n\nSocial responsibility\n\nAt Gore we believe in conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards. We strive to provide our customers with high-value products that enhance the quality of life and to improve the communities in which we work and live. We expect our employees to work with our suppliers, customers and other stakeholders with integrity, fairness and respect.\n\nSocial responsibility\n\nAccordingly, we also expect our garment manufacturing suppliers to operate according to the same principle. That is why in June 2012, GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae joined the multi-stakeholder initiative Fair Labor Association (FLA) to promote and protect workers\u2019 rights and improve working conditions in our contracted factories.\n\nAs a FLA member we are committed to ensuring that our garment manufacturers adhere to FLA\u2019s Code of Conduct and independent auditors regularly verify their compliance. Additionally, the FLA conducts its own assessments to confirm the effectiveness of our auditing system.\n\nEnvironmental Responsibility\n\nGORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae products are environmentally sound choices. We are convinced that our sustainability approach will support our long-term business success and also push environmental progress.\n\nWe get closer to our target, which is making responsibility an essential part of our business processes. We are engaged in regular dialogue with our stakeholders, and we expect our business partners and suppliers to do business in a responsible way as well.\n\nEnvironmental responsibility\nEnvironmental responsibility\n\nAt Gore, respecting the environment is an inherent part of our corporate culture. We strive to act with integrity and responsibly. We will achieve or even exceed all applicable health, safety and environment regulations as well as additional introduced standards from our side. All of our manufacturing facilities for functional textiles globally have introduced an environmental management system according to ISO 14001 and implemented the bluesign\u00ae\n\nstandard, which demands challenging and comprehensive environmental and safety standards in the textile industry.\n\nWe feel obliged to continuously improve our environmental footprint by adopting an approach that rests on three pillars: sound science, life cycle assessment and the durability of our products.\n\nEnvironmental responsibility\n\n\nWe often get asked about our approach to sustainability. Below you will find a list of the most frequently asked questions along with their answers.\n\nHow do Gore Bike Wear\u00ae (GBW\u00ae) and Gore Running Wear\u00ae (GRW\u00ae) audit their factories?\n\nWe use professional and independent third-party auditors to conduct audits at all our garment manufacturers. The result is a detailed audit report describing factory compliance with the requirements of the Fair Labor Association\u2019s (FLA) Code of Conduct and local law. If any non-compliances are identified we support the factory to create a remediation plan with detailed corrective actions, responsibilities and time lines. We also control and track the plan\u2019s progress and completion.\n\nDoes Gore publish a social responsibility report?\n\nNot as yet but as a FLA member our efforts are independently verified and thus the standards we comply with are publicly available.\n\nIs W. L. Gore & Associates a responsible company?\n\nSustainability is an integral element of Gore\u2019s culture and business. For us sustainability means acting responsibly \u2013 fulfill and even surpass all applicable environmental regulations as well as social, health and safety standards.\n\nFor more information:\nGore as a Responsible Enterprise\n\nHow much does Gore pay workers manufacturing its garments?\n\nIt is part of our Social Responsibility Program to ensure that at least legal minimum wages are paid. Our target, however, is to provide compensation that is sufficient to fulfill basic needs and discretionary income. Making highly functional apparel requires skilled workers and our manufacturing partners have to compete for and retain talent.\n\nHow do you ensure that the work of the manufacturers supplying you with garments is socially and environmentally acceptable?\n\nWe carefully select our garment manufacturing partners and focus on long-term and trustful partnerships. Furthermore, we perform regular audits at our garment manufacturers to verify compliance with local law and FLA Code of Conduct. As multiple auditing does not provide any benefit, we strive to collaborate with other brands to share audit reports and cooperate on the remediation plans.\n\nDo GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae products contain harmful substances?\n\nNo. Our products are safe to wear and an environmentally sound choice. All GBW\u00ae & GRW\u00ae products meet the criteria of the product safety standard Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100. Furthermore, Gore Fabrics is a bluesign\u00ae partner, which verifies that the manufacturing processes are carefully managed and equipped with the best available environmental controls. Consequently, our customers can trust the quality and safety of our products.\n\nWhat does Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100 mean?\n\nIt is an independent third-party standard for textiles, intermediates and end products at all stages of production. The OEKO-TEX\u00ae system is well respected worldwide for its science-based approach to textile safety validation.\n\nIt limits for regulated substances, as well as unregulated substances known to be harmful to the health of the wearer.\n\nHow do we use the Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100 for Gore Bike Wear\u00ae & Gore Running Wear\u00ae products?\n\nProduct safety is an integral part of the quality assurance system of Gore Bike Wear\u00ae and Gore Running Wear\u00ae.\n\nWe have implemented the international accepted Oeko-Tex\u00ae standard class II for many years avoiding any critical ingredients in textiles and accessories. Against this background we only accept suppliers and garment manufacturers with quality management ensuring conformity with the Oeko-Tex\u00ae standard. Selecting fabrics and materials we use as far as possible only certified products. For all other materials we require test reports proving at least the same safety level than the Oeko-Tex\u00ae standard. In this way we accomplish the transparency of all applied materials and their ingredients in our production chain of our products.\n\nAll used fabrics, materials and ingredients up to the sewing thread are carefully selected and not approved for production before all required and current certificates & test reports are available.This kind of verification is implemented for each collection in both summer and winter.\n\nAdditionally we check ready made garments on a random basis at our distribution warehouse identifying and preventing any unwanted divergences from our product safety standard.\n\nWhere are GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae products manufactured?\n\nWe make products in factories in Italy, Latvia, Morocco, Romania, Turkey, China, Myanmar and Vietnam.\n\nWho is the Fair Labor Association?\n\nFLA is a collaborative effort of socially responsible companies, universities and civil society organizations to promote and protect workers\u2019 rights and to improve working conditions globally through adherence to international standards. FLA is an international organization headquartered in Washington, DC, with offices in China, Switzerland and Turkey. FLA creates lasting solutions to abusive labor practices by offering tools and resources to companies, delivering training to factory workers and management, conducting due diligence through independent assessments, and advocating for greater accountability and transparency from companies, fact...

The policy requires title holders to commit to developing the State's resources\u00a0or risk losing their prospecting title. If a serious commitment cannot be demonstrated at application, transfer, upon renewal or during the term of a prospecting title, companies may face refusal or cancellation of their titles.\n\nAs part of the Division of Resources and Energy's (DRE) compliance processes, where there is evidence of non-performance or non-compliance with Minimum Standards without satisfactory justification, these will be considerations to determine if a prospecting title should be cancelled or not renewed. These matters, in addition to an applicant's corporate, compliance and environmental performance history will also be considered when assessing applications for the grant, renewal and transfer of titles.\n\nA title holder must take all lawful actions to remedy any force majeure (unforeseeable circumstance or similar) event or effect that may hinder the ability of a title holder to comply with the requirements of, and standards set out in, this policy. The onus is on a title holder to demonstrate any and all actions taken in this respect.\n\nConsistent with the DRE Compliance and Enforcement policy, any actions to refuse or cancel a prospecting title will be proportionate to the non-compliance identified and the seriousness of any non-compliance.\n\nNew prospecting title applications that include National Parks, Nature Reserves and other areas excluded by legislation will not be accepted and will be returned to the applicant.",
