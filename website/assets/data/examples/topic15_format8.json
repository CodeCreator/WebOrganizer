Please read the following disclaimer and click on the \u201caccept\u201d button to get more detailed information.\n\nNotice and Acknowledgement\n\nSaluda Hydro\u2019s (Saluda\u2019s) Planned Operations are projections reflecting future electrical, mechanical, meteorological (weather), and power demand conditions expected at the time of the posting. These conditions are subject to immediate, unpredictable, unannounced, and uncontrollable change. Because of these conditions, lower Saluda river flows may change at any time and without prior warning. Flows near the dam are reflected on the Current Conditions page, though there may be a slight delay before flow changes appear on the page. As a consequence of the changing nature of operations and the unpredictability of the timing and degree of change, the information on this site must not be relied upon exclusively in planning for recreational outings on the lower Saluda River.\n\nPlease note the date and time of the posting of the Planned Operations information. The longer the time since a posting on the Planned Operations page, the greater the potential that conditions have changed and that the Planned Operations information no longer is accurate. Likewise, the longer the time since the posting of the Current Conditions information, the greater the potential that it does not reflect actual river flows. Changes may be immediate and dramatic.\n\nBe especially cautious near the Saluda Dam. The time for users to respond to increases in flows diminishes as one gets closer to the Dam. The rises and falls in river flows and river level are more immediate and dramatic closer to the Dam. Consequently there may be very little time to adjust to those changes.\n\nWhere they exist, pay attention to lights and sirens. They signal an expected relatively sudden rise in river flow and level, which will follow within a matter of minutes after light and siren activation. When sirens or lights are activated, leave the river immediately or make sure you are prepared to deal safely with much higher and more forceful flows. Pay attention to river level markings on bridge abutments and poles where they exist. They go from blue (lower flows) to red (higher flows).\n\nSCE&G urges that all who recreate on the lower Saluda River wear approved personal flotation equipment at all times while on the river. Not to do so is very risky. The lower Saluda can move from relatively calm to treacherous quickly. Stepping stones and paths disappear under higher flows. Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs judgment. Unimpaired judgment is important for those who recreate upon the lower Saluda River.\n\n\nBy clicking below, the reader acknowledges that he\/she has read and understands the Notice above, understands that the operations and flow information presented herein is subject to immediate, dramatic, and unannounced change, and accepts that it is his\/her personal responsibility to evaluate the conditions on the river and pay close attention to changes in river conditions should he\/she engage in recreation on or in the river or recommend it to others.\n\n\nCurrent Conditions On\nThe Lower Saluda River\n\nSCE&G\u2019s operation of the Saluda Hydro plant changes the water flow on the lower Saluda River. Stay informed of planned operations and sign up for automated phone alerts when river conditions change.\n\nCurrent & Planned Operations\n\nToday's Operations\n\nSCEG has generation scheduled at this time.\u00a0The river flows\u00a0are expected to be in the\u00a0YELLOW range.\n\nPlanned Operations\n\nPlans are\u00a0that flows will remain in the\u00a0YELLOW range over the next several days.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Lower Saluda River levels can rise or fall well after the operation of Saluda Hydro commences or terminates. If operational times are posted, they are approximate and are related to the operation at Saluda Hydro.\n\nOperations can and do happen at any time. The flow and temperament of the lower Saluda River could change anytime without notice.",

No. 1-2016]\nIt is the declared policy of the Town of Warwick to conserve, protect and encourage the use of its agricultural land for the production of food and other agricultural products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural areas, agricultural operations often become the subject of nuisance suits. It is the purpose of this policy to reduce the loss to the Town of its agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance. It is expressly found that whatever nuisance may be caused to others by such uses and activities so conducted with sound agricultural practices is more than offset by the benefits from farming to the Town economy by the production of local food and products, and to neighborhood and community and to society, in general, by the preservation of open space by maintaining the inherent beauty of the countryside and by the preservation and continuance of farming operations in the Town of Warwick.\nAs used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:\nThose activities involved in the production of crops, livestock, and livestock products by farm operations, all as defined in \u00a7\u00a0301 of Article 25-AA of the New York Agriculture and Markets Law of New York, including but not limited to the following:\nField crops including corn, wheat, oats, rye, barley, hay, potatoes, dry beans and sod;\nVegetables including tomatoes, snap beans, cabbage, carrots, beets, onions and corn;\nFruits including apples, berries, cherries, peaches and pumpkins;\nHorticultural ornamental specialties including nursery stock, shrubs, ornamental trees, flowers and vegetables;\nLivestock and livestock products, including cattle, sheep, hogs, goats, horses, poultry, ratites such as ostriches, emus, rheas, kiwis, farmed deer, farmed buffalo, fur-bearing animals, wool-bearing animals, such as alpacas and llamas, milk, eggs and furs;\nChristmas trees derived from a managed Christmas tree operation whether dug for transplanting or cut from the stump;\nAquaculture products, including fish, fish products, water plants and shellfish;\nForestry products such as short rotation woody crops used for bio-energy and maple syrup products.\nFurther, agricultural activities shall include an activity engaged in, by, or on behalf of a farmer in connection with any furtherance of the business of agriculture or farming and shall include, without limitation, the collection, transportation, distribution, composting, cooling, drying and storage of animal and poultry waste; storage, transportation and use of equipment for tillage, planting, harvesting and marketing; transportation, storage and use of legally permitted fertilizers and limes, insecticides, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides; construction of farm structures and facilities, including farm wineries and other on-farm food processing, as permitted by local and state building code regulation, in order to enhance the marketing of farm products; construction and maintenance of fences and other enclosures; and the use and\/or maintenance of related pastures, idle or fallow land, woodland, wetland, farm ponds, farm roads and certain farm buildings and other structures related to agricultural practices.\nThe Dispute Resolution Center presently located at 210 East Main Street, Middletown, New York, serving Orange, Putnam, Sullivan and Ulster Counties.\nLand within an agricultural district created pursuant to \u00a7\u00a0303 or land used in agricultural production subject to an agricultural assessment pursuant to \u00a7\u00a0306 of Article 25-AA of the New York Agriculture and Markets Law, used primarily for bona fide agricultural production, for commercial purposes, of all those items and products defined in the New York Agriculture and Markets Law, \u00a7\u00a0301.\nThe right to farm shall apply to farmers as well as those employed or otherwise authorized to act on behalf of farmers and shall also include, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a080-3 of this article, the use of large irrigation pumps and equipment, aerial and ground seeding and spraying, cooling and drying, transporting large, slow-moving equipment over roads within the Town, and the employment of farm laborers, all for the purpose of producing from the land agricultural products such as vegetables, grains, hay, fruits, fibers, wood, trees, plants, shrubs, flowers and seeds.\nThis \"right to farm\" shall also include, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a080-3 of this article, the right to use land for grazing by animals, subject to the restrictions for intensive fowl or livestock farms. The foregoing uses and activities included in the right to farm, when reasonable and necessary for the particular farming, livestock or fowl production and when conducted in accordance with sound agricultural practices, as determined in accordance with \u00a7\u00a080-3 of this article, may occur on holidays, Sundays and weekdays, any time of night or day, and the noise, odors, dust and fumes that are caused by them are also specifically incorporated in the right to farm. In addition to the factors set forth in \u00a7\u00a080-3 of this article for determining whether an agricultural practice is sound, and in determining the reasonableness of the time, place and methodology of such operation, due weight and consideration shall be given to traditional customs and procedures in the agricultural industry, advances resulting from increased knowledge or improved technologies and whether or not the practice is legal and not causing off-site property damage or bodily harm.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this article, agricultural activities conducted on farmland, if consistent with sound agricultural practices as may be determined by the New York State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets and with federal, state, and local laws, regulations or ordinances, are deemed to be reasonable and shall not constitute a nuisance.\nFor the purpose of giving due notice of agricultural activities to proposed new residential areas adjacent to unimproved land being farmed or suitable, this article authorizes the Town Planning Board requirement that any applicant for an adjacent major or minor subdivision, as a condition of approval of such application, include a provision in each and every deed conveying all or any portion of the lands thereby subdivided, as well as on filed final subdivision maps, the following record notice to and waiver by grantees of such present or future proximate farming uses, which provision shall be made to run with the land:\nAgricultural Notes: Being that this project is located within 2,000 feet of an agriculturally zoned district or within the AP-O District, it may have active farming operations in the vicinity. Be advised of the following:\nFarming is encouraged in the Town; it does not only occur between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and is dependent on Mother Nature. Residents should be aware of noise from agricultural machinery being operated in nearby fields in both early morning and evening hours and noise from crop drying fans, which run 24 hours a day during harvest season.\nThe roads leading to and from the subdivision are frequently traveled by farmers and their slow-moving vehicles and equipment.\nFarmer neighbors very often spray their crops with pesticides in accordance with accepted practices of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (6 NYCRR Part 325).\nExisting agricultural operations may create both unavoidable odors and unsightliness commonly associated with farming operations in the area.\nThere are dangers in letting children and pets roam into any adjacent agricultural fields, which is private property.\nResidences for seasonal farm laborers are an accessory use to farming activities in the agricultural zone.\nBe advised of the nuisance of blowing black dirt caused by wind storms in the area.\nIn accordance with \u00a7\u00a0164-46J(23) of the Town Code, no Building Department permit for a new residence shall be issued and no lot shall be sold or conveyed in the Agricultural Industry and Agricultural Protection Overlay Districts unless the applicant\/purchaser of such residence\/lot files a statement with the Town Clerk that he or she understands that the lot lies within the Agricultural Zoning District within which the primary activity is farming.\nA declaration referencing the Agricultural Notes has been recorded in the Orange County Clerk's Office at Liber _______ and Page ______ on _______________.\nIn accordance with New York State Real Property Law \u00a7\u00a0333-c and Real Property Tax Law \u00a7\u00a0574 and Agriculture and Markets Law \u00a7\u00a0310, prior to the sale, purchase, or exchange of any real property located partially or wholly within an Orange County Agricultural District established pursuant to the provisions of New York State Agriculture and Markets Law Article 25-AA, the prospective grantor shall deliver to the prospective grantee a notice which states the following:\n\"It is the policy of New York State and the Town of Warwick to conserve, protect and encourage the development and improvement of agricultural land for the production of food and other products, and also for its natural and ecological value.

Furthermore, as the global economy grows, there are increasing concerns regarding the availability and access to the raw materials that will be necessary to sustain U.S. economic growth and advance other national policies. As the criticality of materials shifts over time, studying the early warning signs and the underlying forces of potential material supply disruption can inform proactive policy development for emerging critical materials. One of the roles of the Critical and Strategic Minerals Supply Chain Subcommittee (CSMSC Subcommittee) of the National Science and Technology Council's Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Sustainability is to develop a methodology for identifying critical materials and monitoring changes in criticality on an ongoing basis, providing \u201cearly warning\u201d to policymakers and other stakeholders. The views of U.S. industry and other stakeholders are important to inform both an understanding of current conditions and the characterization of anticipated future demand for critical materials.\n\n\nResponses must be received by August 31, 2014, to be considered.\n\n\nYou may submit comments by any of the following methods:\n\n  \u2022 Email: Include [Critical and Strategic Materials Supply Chains] in the subject line of the message.\n  \u2022 Fax: (202) 456-6071, Attn: Cyrus Wadia.\n  \u2022 Mail: Attn: Cyrus Wadia, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Eisenhower Executive Office Building, 1650 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20504.\n\nInstructions: Electronic responses must be provided as attachments to an email.

The agencies are to consider alternative actions, as appropriate, that could lessen such adverse effects, and assure that such Federal programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible with State, unit of local government and private programs and policies to protect farmland. The following are guidelines to assist the agencies in these tasks:\n\n(a) An agency may determine whether or not a site is farmland as defined in \u00a7658.2(a) or the agency may request that NRCS make such a determination. If an agency elects not to make its own determination, it should make a request to NRCS on Form AD-1006, the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, available at NRCS offices, for determination of whether the site is farmland subject to the Act. If neither the entire site nor any part of it are subject to the Act, then the Act will not apply and NRCS will so notify the agency. If the site is determined by NRCS to be subject to the Act, then NRCS will measure the relative value of the site as farmland on a scale of 0 to 100 according to the information sources listed in \u00a7658.5(a). NRCS will respond to these requests within 10 working days of their receipt except that in cases where a site visit or land evaluation system design is needed, NRCS will respond in 30 working days. In the event that NRCS fails to complete its response within the required period, if further delay would interfere with construction activities, the agency should proceed as though the site were not farmland.\n\n(b) The Form AD 1006, returned to the agency by NRCS will also include the following incidental information: The total amount of farmable land (the land in the unit of local government's jurisdiction that is capable of producing the commonly grown crop); the percentage of the jurisdiction that is farmland covered by the Act; the percentage of farmland in the jurisdiction that the project would convert; and the percentage of farmland in the local government's jurisdiction with the same or higher relative value than the land that the project would convert. These statistics will not be part of the criteria scoring process, but are intended simply to furnish additional background information to Federal agencies to aid them in considering the effects of their projects on farmland.\n\n(c) After the agency receives from NRCS the score of a site's relative value as described in \u00a7658.4(a) and then applies the site assessment criteria which are set forth in \u00a7658.5 (b) and (c), the agency will assign to the site a combined score of up to 260 points, composed of up to 100 points for relative value and up to 160 points for the site assessment. With this score the agency will be able to identify the effect of its programs on farmland, and make a determination as to the suitability of the site for protection as farmland. Once this score is computed, USDA recommends:\n\n(1) Sites with the highest combined scores be regarded as most suitable for protection under these criteria and sites with the lowest scores, as least suitable.\n\n(2) Sites receiving a total score of less than 160 need not be given further consideration for protection and no additional sites need to be evaluated.\n\n(3) Sites receiving scores totaling 160 or more be given increasingly higher levels of consideration for protection.\n\n(4) When making decisions on proposed actions for sites receiving scores totaling 160 or more, agency personnel consider:\n\n(i) Use of land that is not farmland or use of existing structures;\n\n(ii) Alternative sites, locations and designs that would serve the proposed purpose but convert either fewer acres of farmland or other farmland that has a lower relative value;\n\n(iii) Special siting requirements of the proposed project and the extent to which an alternative site fails to satisfy the special siting requirements as well as the originally selected site.\n\n(d) Federal agencies may elect to assign the site assessment criteria relative weightings other than those shown in \u00a7658.5 (b) and (c). If an agency elects to do so, USDA recommends that the agency adopt its alternative weighting system (1) through rulemaking in consultation with USDA, and (2) as a system to be used uniformly throughout the agency. USDA recommends that the weightings stated in \u00a7658.5 (b) and (c) be used until an agency issues a final rule to change the weightings.\n\n(e) It is advisable that evaluations and analyses of prospective farmland conversion impacts be made early in the planning process before a site or design is selected, and that, where possible, agencies make the FPPA evaluations part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Under the agency's own NEPA regulations, some categories of projects may be excluded from NEPA which may still be covered under the FPPA. Section 1540(c)(4) of the Act exempts projects that were beyond the planning stage and were in either the active design or construction state on the effective date of the Act. Section 1547(b) exempts acquisition or use of farmland for national defense purposes. There are no other exemptions of projects by category in the Act.\n\n(f) Numerous States and units of local government are developing and adopting Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) systems to evaluate the productivity of agricultural land and its suitability for conversion to nonagricultural use. Therefore, States and units of local government may have already performed an evaluation using criteria similar to those contained in this rule applicable to Federal agencies. USDA recommends that where sites are to be evaluated within a jurisdiction having a State or local LESA system that has been approved by the governing body of such jurisdiction and has been placed on the NRCS State conservationist's list as one which meets the purpose of the FPPA in balance with other public policy objectives, Federal agencies use that system to make the evaluation.\n\n(g) To meet reporting requirements of section 1546 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4207, and for data collection purposes, after the agency has made a final decision on a project in which one or more of the alternative sites contain farmland subject to the FPPA, the agency is requested to return a copy of the Form AD-1006, which indicates the final decision of the agency, to the NRCS field office.\n\n(h) Once a Federal agency has performed an analysis under the FPPA for the conversion of a site, that agency's, or a second Federal agency's determination with regard to additional assistance or actions on the same site do not require additional redundant FPPA analysis.\n\n[49 FR 27724, July 5, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 31118, June 17, 1994]\n\nFor questions or comments regarding e-CFR editorial content, features, or design, email ecfr@nara.gov.\nFor questions concerning e-CFR programming and delivery issues, email webteam@gpo.gov.",

Use the PDF linked in the document sidebar for the official electronic format.\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior (Interior) has retained an independent facilitator, the Consensus Building Institute (CBI), to conduct a stakeholder assessment as part of the U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (USEITI) implementation process. On May 18, 2012, Interior will receive and publish CBI's findings regarding options for forming a U.S. multi-stakeholder group that will be responsible for determining how USEITI will be implemented. By this notice, Interior is providing the public advance notice of the opportunity to comment between May 18 and June 29, 2012 on CBI's assessment and findings. Comments may be provided in writing or in person at public listening sessions and a public workshop. Details will be provided by Federal Register Notice at a later date.\n\n\nThe public listening sessions, webinar and workshop dates are:\n\nSession 1\u2014Anchorage, Alaska Public Listening Session, May 30, 2012.\n\nSession 2\u2014Public Webinar, June 1, 2012.\n\nSession 3\u2014Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Public Listening Session, June 11, 2012.\n\nSession 4\u2014New Orleans, Louisiana Public Listening Session, June 12, 2012.\n\nSession 5\u2014Washington, DC Public Workshop, June 22, 2012.\n\n\nBen Nussdorf, telephone (202) 254-5573, fax number (202) 254-5589, email\n\n\nOn February 24th, 2012, Interior published a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comment on the formation of a multi-stakeholder group to implement USEITI (74 FR 11151). In that notice, Interior stated that it would hold a series of public listening sessions to provide additional opportunities for public comment. In March, Interior held those listening sessions in St. Louis, Missouri; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; and Washington, DC. CBI analyzed the input from these four public listening sessions, interviews with potential stakeholders, and written comments that were submitted to Interior. This input will form the basis of CBI's independent stakeholder assessment and findings regarding options for establishing the U.S. multi-stakeholder group, which will be responsible for implementing USEITI.\n\nIn response to feedback received during the first public comment period, once Interior receives the assessment from CBI on May 18, 2012, it will be published and made available online at Alternatively, you may request a copy of the assessment from Ben Nussdorf, whose contact information is listed previously in this notice. We encourage stakeholders and members of the public to participate in the additional public comment period held from May 18-June 29, 2012, to gather feedback on the stakeholder assessment and recommended options for establishing the U.S. multi-stakeholder group. During the May 18-June 29 public comment period, three public listening sessions, a public webinar, and a public workshop will be held as listed previously in this notice. Further details regarding specific times and locations will be provided in advance via Federal Register Notice and online at\n\nBackground: In September 2011, President Barack Obama announced the United States' commitment to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. EITI is a signature initiative of the U.S. National Action Plan for the international Open Government Partnership and offers a voluntary framework for governments and companies to publicly disclose in parallel the revenues paid and received for extraction of oil, gas and minerals owned by the state. The design of each framework is country-specific, and is developed through a multi-year, consensus based process by a multi-stakeholder group comprised of government, industry and civil society representatives. On October 25, President Obama named Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar as the U.S. Senior Official responsible for implementing USEITI. In response, Secretary Salazar posted a White House blog the same day, committing to work with industry and civil society to implement USEITI. For further information on EITI, please visit the USEITI Web page at\n\nDated: April 27, 2012.\n\nAmy Holley,\n\nActing Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management and Budget.\n\n[FR Doc. 2012-10663 Filed 5-2-12; 8:45 am]",

This ordinance complies with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and applicable state law. Cumulative substantial improvement over a five year period is contained in the ordinance. Work that exceeds 50% of the value of the structure in five years triggers additional requirements.\n\nThe NFIP requires that if the cost of reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvements to a building equals or exceeds 50% of the building\u2019s market value, then the building must meet the same construction requirements as a new building. Substantially damaged buildings must be brought up to the same standards (e.g., a residence damaged so that the cost of repairs equals or exceeds 50% of the buildings value before it was damaged must be elevated above the base flood elevation).\n\nSpecial Hazards\n\nSince the Town lies completely in a special flood hazard area surrounded by Biscayne Bay, all development and improvements require permitting from the Town of Bay Harbor Islands Building Department. This is to insure that proposed development and improvements meet all existing codes for the work contemplated.

If a serious commitment cannot be demonstrated at application, transfer, upon renewal or during the term of a prospecting title, companies may face refusal or cancellation of their titles.\n\nAs part of the Division of Resources and Energy's (DRE) compliance processes, where there is evidence of non-performance or non-compliance with Minimum Standards without satisfactory justification, these will be considerations to determine if a prospecting title should be cancelled or not renewed. These matters, in addition to an applicant's corporate, compliance and environmental performance history will also be considered when assessing applications for the grant, renewal and transfer of titles.\n\nA title holder must take all lawful actions to remedy any force majeure (unforeseeable circumstance or similar) event or effect that may hinder the ability of a title holder to comply with the requirements of, and standards set out in, this policy. The onus is on a title holder to demonstrate any and all actions taken in this respect.\n\nConsistent with the DRE Compliance and Enforcement policy, any actions to refuse or cancel a prospecting title will be proportionate to the non-compliance identified and the seriousness of any non-compliance.\n\nNew prospecting title applications that include National Parks, Nature Reserves and other areas excluded by legislation will not be accepted and will be returned to the applicant.",

For more information, see our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nGORE's sustainability approach\n\nBill & Vieve Gore\n\nSustainability is an integral part of our culture and business.\n\nFor us sustainability means being fair and responsible to people and the environment while offering products which provide best-in-class performance. We strive to continually improve the social and environmental impact of our products and processes without compromising their performance.\n\nThis is the legacy of our founders Bill and Vieve Gore and we are proud to continue this tradition.\n\nProduct Responsibility\n\nGORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae are committed to producing apparel that delivers what we promise and is of highest quality. We want our customers to value and love our GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae products, and enjoy their functionality for a long time, which is an effective way to reduce the environmental footprint of function apparel.\n\nWe carefully select the fabrics we use. The choice of fabrics, materials, methods of production, dyes and transport conditions are all taken into consideration prior to the manufacture of our products. To ensure optimal protection and performance our products are field or lab tested for their durability, appearance and quality after washes and impact (e.g. washing-, rubbing-, color fastness).\n\nProduct responsibility\n\nAll GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae products meet the criteria of the Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100. Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100 is an external, independent certification system for for textile raw materials, intermediate and finished products and is the most used product safety label worldwide.\n\nProduct responsibility\n\nAdditionally, Gore has been working with the bluesign\u00ae standard since 2010 to verify the safety of its products. The emphasis we place on quality extends to our suppliers and manufacturers. Accordingly, Gore carries out continuous external quality controls at production facilities and encourages its suppliers to obtain a bluesign\u00ae certification in order to reduce environmental impacts in our supply chain.\n\nAn increasing number of GORE-TEX\u00ae and WINDSTOPPER\u00ae fabrics are already certified. In our GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae collections we predominantly use certified fabrics.\n\nProduct responsibility\n\nSocial Responsibility\n\nSocial responsibility\n\nAt Gore we believe in conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards. We strive to provide our customers with high-value products that enhance the quality of life and to improve the communities in which we work and live. We expect our employees to work with our suppliers, customers and other stakeholders with integrity, fairness and respect.\n\nSocial responsibility\n\nAccordingly, we also expect our garment manufacturing suppliers to operate according to the same principle. That is why in June 2012, GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae joined the multi-stakeholder initiative Fair Labor Association (FLA) to promote and protect workers\u2019 rights and improve working conditions in our contracted factories.\n\nAs a FLA member we are committed to ensuring that our garment manufacturers adhere to FLA\u2019s Code of Conduct and independent auditors regularly verify their compliance. Additionally, the FLA conducts its own assessments to confirm the effectiveness of our auditing system.\n\nEnvironmental Responsibility\n\nGORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae and GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae products are environmentally sound choices. We are convinced that our sustainability approach will support our long-term business success and also push environmental progress.\n\nWe get closer to our target, which is making responsibility an essential part of our business processes. We are engaged in regular dialogue with our stakeholders, and we expect our business partners and suppliers to do business in a responsible way as well.\n\nEnvironmental responsibility\nEnvironmental responsibility\n\nAt Gore, respecting the environment is an inherent part of our corporate culture. We strive to act with integrity and responsibly. We will achieve or even exceed all applicable health, safety and environment regulations as well as additional introduced standards from our side. All of our manufacturing facilities for functional textiles globally have introduced an environmental management system according to ISO 14001 and implemented the bluesign\u00ae\n\nstandard, which demands challenging and comprehensive environmental and safety standards in the textile industry.\n\nWe feel obliged to continuously improve our environmental footprint by adopting an approach that rests on three pillars: sound science, life cycle assessment and the durability of our products.\n\nEnvironmental responsibility\n\n\nWe often get asked about our approach to sustainability. Below you will find a list of the most frequently asked questions along with their answers.\n\nHow do Gore Bike Wear\u00ae (GBW\u00ae) and Gore Running Wear\u00ae (GRW\u00ae) audit their factories?\n\nWe use professional and independent third-party auditors to conduct audits at all our garment manufacturers. The result is a detailed audit report describing factory compliance with the requirements of the Fair Labor Association\u2019s (FLA) Code of Conduct and local law. If any non-compliances are identified we support the factory to create a remediation plan with detailed corrective actions, responsibilities and time lines. We also control and track the plan\u2019s progress and completion.\n\nDoes Gore publish a social responsibility report?\n\nNot as yet but as a FLA member our efforts are independently verified and thus the standards we comply with are publicly available.\n\nIs W. L. Gore & Associates a responsible company?\n\nSustainability is an integral element of Gore\u2019s culture and business. For us sustainability means acting responsibly \u2013 fulfill and even surpass all applicable environmental regulations as well as social, health and safety standards.\n\nFor more information:\nGore as a Responsible Enterprise\n\nHow much does Gore pay workers manufacturing its garments?\n\nIt is part of our Social Responsibility Program to ensure that at least legal minimum wages are paid. Our target, however, is to provide compensation that is sufficient to fulfill basic needs and discretionary income. Making highly functional apparel requires skilled workers and our manufacturing partners have to compete for and retain talent.\n\nHow do you ensure that the work of the manufacturers supplying you with garments is socially and environmentally acceptable?\n\nWe carefully select our garment manufacturing partners and focus on long-term and trustful partnerships. Furthermore, we perform regular audits at our garment manufacturers to verify compliance with local law and FLA Code of Conduct. As multiple auditing does not provide any benefit, we strive to collaborate with other brands to share audit reports and cooperate on the remediation plans.\n\nDo GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae products contain harmful substances?\n\nNo. Our products are safe to wear and an environmentally sound choice. All GBW\u00ae & GRW\u00ae products meet the criteria of the product safety standard Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100. Furthermore, Gore Fabrics is a bluesign\u00ae partner, which verifies that the manufacturing processes are carefully managed and equipped with the best available environmental controls. Consequently, our customers can trust the quality and safety of our products.\n\nWhat does Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100 mean?\n\nIt is an independent third-party standard for textiles, intermediates and end products at all stages of production. The OEKO-TEX\u00ae system is well respected worldwide for its science-based approach to textile safety validation.\n\nIt limits for regulated substances, as well as unregulated substances known to be harmful to the health of the wearer.\n\nHow do we use the Oeko-Tex\u00ae Standard 100 for Gore Bike Wear\u00ae & Gore Running Wear\u00ae products?\n\nProduct safety is an integral part of the quality assurance system of Gore Bike Wear\u00ae and Gore Running Wear\u00ae.\n\nWe have implemented the international accepted Oeko-Tex\u00ae standard class II for many years avoiding any critical ingredients in textiles and accessories. Against this background we only accept suppliers and garment manufacturers with quality management ensuring conformity with the Oeko-Tex\u00ae standard. Selecting fabrics and materials we use as far as possible only certified products. For all other materials we require test reports proving at least the same safety level than the Oeko-Tex\u00ae standard. In this way we accomplish the transparency of all applied materials and their ingredients in our production chain of our products.\n\nAll used fabrics, materials and ingredients up to the sewing thread are carefully selected and not approved for production before all required and current certificates & test reports are available.This kind of verification is implemented for each collection in both summer and winter.\n\nAdditionally we check ready made garments on a random basis at our distribution warehouse identifying and preventing any unwanted divergences from our product safety standard.\n\nWhere are GORE BIKE WEAR\u00ae and GORE RUNNING WEAR\u00ae products manufactured?\n\nWe make products in factories in Italy, Latvia, Morocco, Romania, Turkey, China, Myanmar and Vietnam.\n\nWho is the Fair Labor Association?\n\nFLA is a collaborative effort of socially responsible companies, universities and civil society organizations to promote and protect workers\u2019 rights and to improve working conditions globally through adherence to international standards. FLA is an international organization headquartered in Washington, DC, with offices in China, Switzerland and Turkey. FLA creates lasting solutions to abusive labor practices by offering tools and resources to companies, delivering training to factory workers and management, conducting due diligence through independent assessments, and advocating for greater accountability and transparency from companies, fact...
