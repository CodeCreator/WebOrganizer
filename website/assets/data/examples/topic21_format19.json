Uses his length well to finish at the rim ... Plays the game very efficiently ... Makes a high number of midrange jumpers ... His shooting ability is his standout talent ... Range extends to the NBA three point line ... Uses size and length to easily shoot over smaller defenders ... Good with head fakes to get his defender in the air on the perimeter ... Effective at attacking the basket in a straight line ... Length and long strides make him a hassle to keep out of the paint ... Doesn't need more than one or two dribbles to attack the basket ... Despite lacking strength, he can get to the free throw line at a high rate ... Comfortable with the ball in his hands and playing off the ball ... Due to his size and length he's able to see over the defense to distribute the ball ... Delivers the ball on target to open teammates ... Has a high basketball IQ, good attention to detail ...\n\nWeaknesses: Extremely frail, weighed 196 lbs at the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit ... Needs to develop his body and strength in order to handle the physical play at higher levels ... Not a strong defender yet ... Doesn't possess great lateral quickness ... Often out of place on the defensive end ... His footwork when defending on the ball is subpar ... Needs to become better at using his left hand, both when dribbling or finishing around the basket ... Not an overly explosive athlete ... While he plays smoothly, can seem to be playing too slow at times or even come across as lazy ... Can develop into a better playmaker ... A shy, low key kid, should look to develop into more of a vocal leader ...\n\nNotes: Kinston, NC native (home of former UNC Tar Heels' Jerry Stackhouse and Reggie Bullock) bucked popular thought by choosing Duke ... Selected to the 2015 McDonald's All-American, Jordan Brand Classic and NIKE Hoop Summit games ...\n\nOverall: Ingram is a player that possesses intriguing upside as he combines superb shooting and a knack for scoring with length ... On the surface he has the physical tools to become Kevin Durant 2.0, however Ingram has a long ways to go in his development if he wants to ever reach such a lofty goal. Ingram is going to be the guy for the Duke Blue Devils next season, that should give us our best chance to see just what type of player he can be in the NBA.\n\nBrandon Jefferson 11\/10\/15\n\nApril 29, 2015\n\nApril 3, 2015\n\nFebruary 4, 2015\n\nJanuary 5, 2015\n\nDecember 26, 2014\n\nOctober 13, 2014\n\nSeptember 8, 2014\n\nJune 29, 2014\n\nMay 30, 2014\n\nMay 21, 2014\n\nMay 1, 2014\n\nJune 19, 2013\n\nMay 18, 2013\n\nMay 17, 2013\n\nJanuary 8, 2013\n\nApril 16, 2012\n\nRelated Content\n\nRSS: Syndicate content",

For instance, if you are ranked higher than 70% of all players, then you would be in the 70th percentile.\n\nWhy do you chart the percentile instead of the rank?\n\nThe number of ranked players in the TennisRecruiting.net lists changes from week to week, and the differences can be dramatic over long periods of time. For example, there may be only 500 players ranked before the busy summer season\u00a0-\u00a0and 1000 players ranked at the end. With these changes, your ranking may change significantly over long periods of time\u00a0-\u00a0and these changes are not necessarily correlated with your performance.\n\nWe have found that percentile does not fluctuate as widely as the raw rankings and better correlates with performance. Using percentiles makes the historical ranking charts more meaningful.\n\nWhy does the chart start at the 50th percentile?\n\nThe pool of players considered is much bigger than the players that we rank. Just meeting the eligibility requirements of our lists in terms of wins is an accomplishment. Since more than 50% of the players are ineligible across all classes, we decided to show from 50 to 100.\n\nClick on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to view and buy his equipment, apparel, and footwear.\n8\/27 Thibault Cancel chooses Alabama\n8\/27 Alexey Nesterov chooses Alabama\n8\/27 Maja Ornberg chooses Florida Gulf Coast\n8\/26 Haley Morgan chooses Central Oklahoma\n8\/26 Parker Banning chooses Dayton\n8\/26 Charlie Sharton chooses Georgetown\n8\/26 Brooke Bogdanovich chooses Navy\n8\/25 Tina Li chooses Navy\n8\/25 Amanda Cyr chooses Navy\n8\/25 Elisa Kendall chooses East Texas Baptist\n\nFull Listings: Boys' Commits & Girls' Commits\n\n8\/24 ???? ?????? ????????

        "text":"List of climbing knots\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThere are many knots used in climbing, rappelling and mountaineering. Popular climbing knots are briefly described and depicted in this article.\n\nBeer knot.JPG\nBeer knot: The Beer knot is often used in tubular webbing, usually for making slings.\nDouble fisherman's knot WPK.jpg\nDouble fisherman knot (aka Grapevine):The Grapevine knot is useful to tie together two ends of ropes. Ropes can be of unequal sizes. It is often used to tie both ends of the same rope together to form a circle.\nTriple fisherman's knot\nOverhand bend WPK.jpg\nOverhand bend (aka European death knot, Euro death knot, EDK):The Overhand bend is a simple and fast way to join two ropes, notably for rappelling. Can be very useful in situations where speed is critical to safety. It is similar to a water knot, but both bitter ends come out the same side of the knot.\nWater knot WPK.jpg\nWater knot (aka Tape Knot, Double Overhand Bend, Ring Bend):The Water knot is useful to tie together two ends of ropes. Often used with webbing.\nStrangle knot WPK.jpg\nStrangle knot: The Strangle knot is a simple binding knot. It forms both sides of a Double fisherman's knot, and is also used to back up loop knots and both ends of bends.\nBachmann knot WPK.jpg\nBachmann knot:The Bachmann knot is useful when the friction hitch needs to be reset quickly\/often or made to be self-tending as in crevasse and self-rescue.\nClove hitch WPK.jpg\nClove hitch:The Clove hitch is used in belay systems among other things.\nItalian hitch WPK.jpg\nItalian hitch (aka Munter hitch, HMS):The Italian hitch is a simple knot, used by climbers and cavers as part of a life-lining or belay system. Its main use is as a friction device for controlling the rate of descent in belay systems.\nKlemheist knot WPK.jpg\nKlemheist knot:The Klemheist knot is an alternative to the Prusik knot, useful when the climber is short of cord but has plenty of webbing.\nPrusik WPK.jpg\nPrusik:The Prusik is a knot used mainly for emergency use. Some carry between one to three cords specifically for prusiks. One can be used to quickly secure a person's position to correct problems with equipment; two can be used as a method of ascending a rope.\nBlakes hitch knot retouched.png\nBlake's hitch:Blake's hitch is widely used in tree climbing applications. The knot can be slid up and down a line manually, but when loaded, it sticks securely.\nT\u00eate d'alouette.jpg\nGirth hitch: This hitch is commonly used to attach loops of runner to harnesses, bags, other kinds of equipment, and to natural features like rock knobs or brush\/tree trunks for protection.\nLoop Knots\nAlpine butterfly knot WPK.jpg\nAlpine butterfly knot:The Alpine Butterfly is a strong and secure loop knot. Allows load distribution in multiple directions. It can also be used to isolate a worn section of rope.\nFigure-of-eight loop 2 WPK.jpg\nFigure-of-eight loop:The Figure-of-eight loop is considered strong and secure. Can be tied by taking a bight of rope and tying a figure-of-eight knot or can be tied directly around\/through objects before weaving back through the first figure eight knot (Figure-of-eight follow through).\nInline figure-of-eight loop 2 WPK.jpg\nDirectional Figure-of-eight Loop: The Inline figure-of-eight loop is similar to a figure-of-eight loop but used to form a loop that will be loaded longitudinally in a line under tension. Particularly useful in rope tightening systems where the loop is established as a means to secure a pulley or carabiner onto the main line to reduce the amount of work needed to tighten the entire system. Similar to a trucker's hitch.\nDouble bowline: The double bowline is commonly used by sport climbers who take multiple lead falls and then have trouble untying their figure eights.\nDouble Figure-Eight Loop.jpg\nDouble Figure Eight Loop (aka Bunny Ears): Used for equalising two anchors using the rope.\nYosemite bowline: Also called a bowline with a Yosemite finish, this is another way of tying the rope to the harness.\nDoppelter Palstek.jpg\nBowline on a bight: Used for equalizing anchors.\nStopper Knots\nStevedore knot WPK.jpg\nStevedore knot (aka Double figure eight):The Stevedore knot is tied at the end of a rope to prevent the end from unraveling, slipping through another knot, or passing back through a hole, block, or belay\/rappel device. It is more bulky and less prone to jamming than the closely related figure-of-eight knot.\nOverhand knot WPK.jpg\nOverhand knot:The Overhand knot is a component of many knots used in climbing.\nMonkey's fist WPK.jpg\nMonkey's fist:The Monkey's Fist is used to tie the end of a climbing rope into a tight ball so the rope can be thrown farther\/easier.\n\nExternal links[edit]",

Voto\n\nSurf Report Feed\n\nAlnes Lighthouse Swell Statistics, Novembre: Surf with Light or Offshore Winds\n\nThis image shows only the swells directed at Alnes Lighthouse that coincided with light winds or offshore conditions through a typical November. It is based on 2867 predictions, one every 3 hours. The direction of the spokes show where quality surf generating swell comes from. Five colours represent increasing wave sizes. Very small swells of less than 0.5m (1.5 feet) high are shown in blue. Green and yellow represent increasing swell sizes and red illustrates highest swells greater than >3m (>10ft). In both graphs, the area of any colour is proportional to how often that size swell was forecast.\n\nThe diagram indicates that the most common swell direction, shown by the longest spokes, was WNW, whereas the the dominant wind blows from the S. The chart at the bottom shows the same thing but without direction information. For example, swells larger than 1.5 feet (0.5m) coincided with good wind conditions 22% of the time, equivalent to 7 days. Open sea swells exceeding >3m (>10ft) are unlikely to occur in a normal November but 8% of the time we expect swell in the range 2-3m (6.5-10ft) 8%, equivalent to (2 days). Taking into account the fraction of these swells that coincided with predicted offshore winds, and given the fact that Alnes Lighthouse is slightly protected from open water swells, we estimate that clean surf can be found at Alnes Lighthouse about 22% of the time and that surf is messed up by onshore wind 43% of the time. This is means that we expect 20 days with waves in a typical November, of which 7 days should be clean enough to surf.\n\nIMPORTANT: Beta version feature! Swell heights are open water values from NWW3. There is no attempt to model near-shore effects. Coastal wave heights will generally be less, especially if the break does not have unobstructed exposure to the open ocean.",
