It contained tempura, tuna mayo salad, miso soup, and rice. I always like Japanese tempura and this tempura batter was really crispy. The tuna mayo salad was also delicious. With 1,046 yen price, of course this menu was much better than my previous tempura udon at Kamakura.",

        "text":"Great Sunday Brunch at Parma Ridge Winery and\u00a0Bistro\n\nIt was a beautiful drive from Boise with the fog forming along the river and in the valleys. Surrealistic. The food was good and the service was super. I\u2019m glad we had reservations as the Bistro was getting full with at least 1 large party. I highly suggest you call for reservations \u2013 (208) 946-5187 or text them.\nMy only suggestion, and I mentioned this to Chef Megan, is to watch the salt content in the Poutine Bowl. I know it was well above the 1\u00bc teaspoon of daily allowance. It was excessive. But the plus side is the flavors were all there from the chardonnay saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, cheese and bacon. Look at what we had. Yummy! Add to this a wonderful glass (or two) of the Parma Ridge 2016 Merlot, and you are bound for a super experience. Here is their Menu. If you want a fun and delicious visit to a winery bistro and you are in the Boise area, you must go here. Definitely a 5-Star bistro.\n\nREGULAR HOURS: 12-9 pm Friday\n12-5 pm Saturday and\n11 am \u2013 5 pm Sunday and serve cuisine all weekend.\nHappy Hour on Friday from 4-7 p.m. and a Special Menu all day Sunday!\n\n\u201cFog in the Valley\u201d\n\n\nTasting Room and Bistro\nChef Megan is such a delight.

And it looks like everyone found the winery ok with the new sign \u201cpointing the way\u201d on hiway 95 \u2013 pictured to the left. Look for it! And then being able to use the new barrel room to accommodate all of the people. Such a treat! Artist Stephanie Hodge was the perfect hostess. And Chef Storm Hodge produced some awesome treats to go with the wines being poured. Both Stephanie and Storm are doing a great job with the winery. Look at the following photos to see what Chef Storm made and we consumed. Left Click any of the photos to see them enlarged.

Interesting.\nIt may be based on the Roman pagan festival of Lupercalis which was a fertility celebration on February 15th. In 496 Pope Gelasius changed the celebration to St Valentine\u2019s Day. According to the Catholic encyclopedia, there were at least three early Christian saints by the name of Valentine. One was a priest in Rome, one a bishop in Terni and nothing is known about the third St Valentine except that he met his end in Africa. Surprisingly, all three of them are said to have been martyred on the 14th of February.\nPope Gelasius intended to honor the first of these three men: This St Valentine was a priest who lived around 270 AD in Rome and attracted the disfavor of Roman Emperor Claudius II who ruled during this time. St Valentine held secret marriage ceremonies of soldiers in opposition to Claudius II who had prohibited marriage of young men. Claudius II believed that if men were married they were more loyal to their families than the state. Therefore, not good soldiers. St Valentine was against this and would marry young couples secretly. Claudius II found out and had him imprisoned.\n\nIt was during the 14th century that St Valentine\u2019s Day became securely associated to love. Chaucer had a lot to do with this day. In France and England it was believe that birds mated on February 14th. Chaucer used this image of birds as a symbol of lovers. \u201cFor this was on St Valentine\u2019s Day. When every fowl cometh there to choose a mate.\u201d\n\nBrunch at Parma Ridge\u00a0Bistro!\n\n26oct2016_1_parma-ridge_dusk-viewIt w... (truncated)",

        "text":"\n\nI just want to focus more on the foods eaten by different Nigerian tribes, I have seen countless numbers of email from white ladies that are married to Nigerian men, questions about what to make for dinner if you are married to a Nigerian man, \u201cI am married to Igbo man, what do I make for breakfast?\u201d stuff like that.\n\nI listed the most popular and generally accepted Nigerian foods at the very top of our home page and here I just want to focus on what Igbo people (men, women and children) like to eat. In case you are dating or married to a Nigerian man or you are friends with people from Igbo, here are some of their favorite recipes\n\nOf course they would accept almost any deliciously made Nigerian foods but a surprise treat would indeed surprise them.\n\nI would go along to list them and then drop a link to the individual pages where you can learn more about what to serve an Igbo man. I have written a page about all kinds of soups eaten in Nigeria but I am going to separate them right here, I want to start with different kind of Igbo soups then I will talk about other Igbo recipes at the bottom of the page.\n\nHere is my list of Igbo foods\n\nThe first on my list of Igbo foods is a combination of fufu and uha soup. Oh, how I love this Igbo delicacy! As a matter of fact there were days I eat fufu like five times in a week, it is a very heavy food and very scarce in this part of the world where I now live.\n\nLike I said, it is a very heavy food and the best time to enjoy this would be in the afternoon or four hours before you go to bed, although we never cared about all this while in the village, then we were young and we eat whatever we feel like eating but now the case is slightly different.\n\nClick on the Image above to learn more about Uha Soup and Fufu.\n\nFufu can also go with Nigerian bitter leaf soup, this soup can be made into different recipes, the Igbo like to make this soup with cocoyam (ofe ede), it is one of the popular Igbo soups \u2013 Ofe Onugbu, we have a detailed instruction on making Igbo Bitter Leaf Soup, you will also find a video on the page.\n\nAnother popular Igbo food (soup) is Okra soup. This is actually one of the easiest and cheapest Nigerian soup, I remember we used to make a very small pot of okra soup with just about two hundred and fifty Naira (250), more like a one dollar soup. I like to make this soup with fresh fish, it is very delicious. Learn more here about Making Okra Soup\n\nIgbo Popular Desserts\n\nHere are my two most popular Igbo deserts, of course you will also find them on the page About All Desserts Eaten in Nigeria, this two in particular is very special to the people of Igbo, they are African salad and nkwobi, I like them too.\n\nOver the past few months I have gotten lots of questions about how to make Nkwobi, a favorite dessert of the people of Igbo, here you will find a very comprehensive guide. We made Nkwobi chicken as almost any kind of meat now could be used in making this Igbo delicacy. Learn How We Made Nkwobi In The Nigerian Kitchen\n\nThe second is an African salad (Abacha, Ugba, jakwu), we call it different names. I never liked this desserts neither have I considered it one of Igbo foods until my mum made a very delicious recipe, On this page I did it the exact way as my mum, we the Igbo girls learn how to cook foods from our mothers. Here is a great tip on Making African Salad(Jakwu, Abacha), I even included a video, Enjoy!\n\nOther Igbo Foods\n\nThere are several other Igbo recipes, I will include them on this page as I remember them or as they are discovered. The last food I would be talking about here would be African breadfruit (ukwa), most people keep asking the question \u201cwhat is African breadfruit?\u201d I tried to answer that question comprehensively on this page that is dedicated to it, I made a video too for this Igbo recipe.\n\nOther Nigerian Delicious Foods\n\nSubscribe To Improve Your Cooking!\n\nFrom Igbo Recipes \u2013 Other Nigerian foods\nIf you have a question or comment use the box below, thanks\n\n\n  1. petti \u00a0June 25, 2013\n\n    I am married to an igbo man and would really love to learn about all the igbo recipes, I made jollof rice a couple of days back and it was very tasty, he loved it!

I want to learn how to create meals he will be familiar with but everything sounds so exotic. I am a very good cook in America. I can cook American, Italian, Chinese, and some Irish meals but I want his family not to be disappointed in me. We have enough strikes against us as it is. I\u2019m older and white. He is younger and black. We don\u2019t care but not to be able to cook even a simple Igbo meal might be a reason for them not to attend our wedding. I wish your videos told how to pronounce the different meals and the different items that go in them. Any help would be appreciated. I will be buying your cookbook at the end of the month.\n\n  16.

Anna's boyfriend Josh is also planning a visit this month. \u00a0It's been too long since we have seen Josh and we miss him so much.\n\n\u00a0There is a chance I will be meeting a internet friend too, Jenny. \u00a0Jenny will be on vacation and house-hunting they will be very busy and if I don't get to meet up with her in June when she does move she will be in living in the state right next to me so we will have some fun visits.\n\nThe Forestry and BLM should be back up here clearing more trees for the fire break unless they are called away for fires. \u00a0We had a very mild winter so fire danger is high this year. \u00a0There have already been a few fires in Southern Utah from people burning and it getting out of control. \u00a0The biggest threat is lightening strikes and fireworks.\n\nJune is also the start of working around the house. \u00a0We have wood trim we need to restain and seal. \u00a0We are going to work on a fenced area for Olive so she can go out and sun. \u00a0I am waiting one more year on my garden. \u00a0I have decided I want to do raised beds, I have to research the best way to get water down to the garden and Bill needs to fix the garden gate (yesterdays wind broke the gate). \u00a0Bill has already been working around the property trimming trees, cutting weeds and those dreaded scrub oaks are already out of hand again. \u00a0Bill already has a lot of firewood cut for the winter but we will need more. \u00a0We have enough on our to-do list to keep us busy all summer long we will also through in some day trips to explore the area around us.\n\nI look forward to sharing family, home and food with you during the summer months. \u00a0I hope you will stop by and say Hi.\n\nUntil Next Time,\n\nFriday, May 25, 2012\n\nPhoto Friday\n\nI am sharing photos of my English Bull Terrier Olive. \u00a0Olive is almost one year old. \u00a0It is hard to find a toy that a Bully can not destroy in a week. \u00a0One of my friends on Instagram got his two Bullies a Jolley Egg. \u00a0It is a hard plastic and since it is shaped like an egg they can not grab ahold of it and tear it apart.\n\nWhen the egg first arrived we put it on the wood floor and Olive was scared to death of the egg it was just too loud for her. \u00a0When we went down to the local high school track she went crazy over the egg. \u00a0Olive played with the egg until she wore herself out.\n\nHere are a few of the photos I took of her with her new toy.\n\nJust a note on Sunday's post Sundays with Joy. \u00a0I will no longer be participating in the group. \u00a0Life got a little busy and my new business I am working on comes first.\u00a0\n\nUntil Next Time,\n\nMonday, May 21, 2012\n\nSpicy Italian Rustica Pasta\n\nA few months ago I entered 2 recipes in a contest hosted by Johnsonville sausage. \u00a0Grand prize was a culinary trip to Italy and the 5 finalist received a large gift basket chock-full of culinary goodies.\n\nSadly I didn't win anything. \u00a0However, I do have a couple recipes to share with you. \u00a0Here is the first recipe the second I will share at a later date.\n\nJohnsonville \u00a0Spicy Rustica Italian Pasta\n\n1 box Penne Pasta, cooked according to box directions under cook by 3 minutes\n1 orange bell pepper - chopped\n1 yellow bell pepper - chopped\n1 onion - chopped\n8 medium crimini mushrooms - sliced thick\n3 cloves garlic - chopped\n2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil - divided\n1 package Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage - sliced into bite size pieces\n2 heaping Tbsp all purpose flour\n1\/4 cup white wine\n2 cups chicken broth\n1\/2 tsp salt\n1\/4 tsp fresh cracked pepper\n1 1\/2 tsp cajun seasoning\n1\/2 tsp red pepper flakes\n1 cup parmesan cheese - divided\n1\/2 cup whipping cream\n3\/4 cup Italian Style bread crumbs\n2 Tbsp butter - cut into small pieces\n\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees.

        "text":"Cabbage on steroids\n\n\nI\u2019m not really a big cabbage fan, but in honor of my retro Sunday brunch today I made a cabbage casserole recipe which was so delicious I could have served it up with chips and called it a dip.\n\n\nIt was loosely based on a recipe supplied by my old friend Tom White of Madison. He made it on New Year\u2019s Day every year and called it his \u201cLucky New Year\u2019s Casserole.\u201d\n\nThis a.m., I tweaked it a bit and think it is even better. Here you go:\n\nLucky Cabbage Casserole\n\n*1 head cabbage (I used half for B and me)\n\n*Cream Sauce made from 1\/2 stick butter, 1 heaping tsp flour and 1 cup milk. \u2013 my version used a little less butter, 1 tsp. flour and a mixture of about 1\/4 cup sour cream and water to make almost a cup. (I don\u2019t buy milk anymore since my children and husband grew up and left home.)\n\n*Tom\u2019s version called for 1 cup mozzarella cheese\u00a0 added to the cream sauce\u2013 my version used about a cup of grated Swiss cheese.\u00a0 (I don\u2019t measure anything.)\n\nMix the cheese sauce with the cabbage, bake it up at 400 degrees until bubbly.\u00a0 Go slap yo\u2019 self in the face.\u00a0 It\u2019s that good.\u00a0 Cabbage may replace chocolate as my new favorite food group.\n\nOne thought on \u201cCabbage on steroids\n\n  1. It interested me that this is served on New Year\u2019s day after an eve of reveling. In Hungary they serve a soup they call \u201cDrunkard\u2019s soup\u201d which has cabbage as its base. Apparently cabbage is good for a hangover. I, too, like cabbage in many forms, particularly Hungarian stuffed cabbage. Your recipe is a keeper.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"Procrastination Cooking: Handmade Gnocchi\n\nEarlier this year I had the amazing opportunity to spend my Spring semester studying in Florence, Italy. After spending my Sundays as a child visiting my Italian great grandparents and four+ years of studying the language, I anxiously waited for the day when I could visit the nation of my ancestors and put all my years of study to practice on the streets. Even more, I looked forward to the chance to live in the country whose cuisine I worshipped.\n\nI knew before I even left the United States that concerns about the scale would be left at home. Only four months in a country with such delicacies as tiramisu, bolognese, pizza and gelato meant that there was absolutely no room for guilt. Food was a constant fixture on my mind, in part because of my foodie tendencies, but also because I was enrolled in a Molecular Gastronomy course focusing on food chemistry. Some of the greatest benefits of the course were the various fields trips to extend our lessons beyond the classroom. A visit to a Chianti vineyard, a goat farm and a chocolate factory were all wonderful, but my favorite was a trip to the small town of Montespertoli for a cooking class.\n\nGrowing up, I loved watching my family members cook in the kitchen, so this cooking class enabled me to learn some of the tricks of the Italian trade. On the class menu: assorted bruschetta, handmade spinach ravioli with sage butter sauce, handmade gnocchi, roasted pork with milk, and tiramisu. Amongst everything on the menu, the gnocchi were the most time-consuming, but the results were incredible. Perfect gnocchi are like pillows, soft and delicate. There are so many aspects in the preparation process that can quickly turn a batch of fresh of gnocchi from exemplary to inferior, so preparing the light pillows requires plenty of patience and practice. However, for those days when deadlines and reading assignments pile up and you just can\u2019t face them, rolling gnocchi is an ideal way to procrastinate.\n\nBethany Imondi, a junior studying Government and English at Georgetown University, lives for the thrill of decoding Italian recipes and experimenting with them until they taste just like grandma\u2019s version. Read more\u2026\n\n\nHandmade Gnocchi\nServes 4\n\nThis recipe is adapted from the Salati Bene cooking class I took while in Florence. The original measurements were in metric, so I have converted them here. Typical of Italian cooking, the original \u201crecipe\u201d was less than a recipe and more like a brief outline of instructions. Since a cup of flour can have different meanings depending on who you ask, I have updated the recipe based on personal experience with further details about what to do with each step.\n\n1 lb of starchy potatoes, like russet\n1 cup of flour, plus more for kneading\n1\/4 cup Parmigiano Reggiano cheese\nFresh grated nutmeg\n\nFill a large pot with water and bring to a boil on the stove. Once boiling, salt the water and add the potatoes to the pot. Bring the pot back to a boil and cook until fork tender (the time will depend on the size of the potatoes, but begin checking close to 40 minutes).\n\nOnce cooked, remove the potatoes from the water with a slotted spoon. While still warm, carefully skin the potatoes. It is important that the potatoes stay hot so that they can be easily mashed. Once peeled, use a ricer or a food mill to mush the potatoes. If you lack these tools, simply mash them with a fork in a bowl. Be careful not to over mash the potatoes; just ensure that there are no noticeable lumps.\n\nWhen the potatoes are ready, place the potato pulp in a bowl and add the flour and cheese. Grate in some fresh nutmeg to taste, then season with salt and pepper. Without overworking, carefully combine the mixture to form a dough.\n\nGently beginning kneading the dough as one would with bread. Press down and away with the heel of the hand, fold the dough over, make a quarter turn, and repeat the process. Add additional flour, if needed, to keep the dough from sticking. Be careful not to add too much flour at the risk of making the gnocchi too dry. Knead into a ball until the dough is moist but not longer sticky.\n\nOnce the dough is ready, divide it into five or six smaller balls. Roll each ball into snake-like ropes of dough, about finger thick. Proceed to cut the rope into one-inch pieces of gnocchi.\n\nFrom here, the gnocchi can be boiled, or shaped to resemble the traditional Italian version by using the tines of a fork to add ridges. Place the gnocchi at the top of the fork against the tines, and gently press it against the length of the fork. Do not press too hard, or the gnocchi will collapse. Shaping the potatoes will require practice, but the more one does it, the easier it becomes. As each pillow is done, place in an even layer on a lightly floured baking sheet.\n\nTo cook the gnocchi, place in a pot of salted boiling water. The gnocchi are finished when they rise to the surface of the water. This should only take a few minutes, but time will vary according to size, therefore it is best to watch them. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon.\n\nServe with your favorite tomato or pesto sauce, or try substituting them for the pasta in your \u00a0favorite Italian dishes.\n\nRecipe Index Keywords:\n\nCategories: Blog, Campus Cooking, Eating, and Recipes.\nCooking Method: On the Stove.\nMealtime: Dinner.\nI Don't Have Any: Money.\nI'm Cooking For...: Dates, Dinner Party, and Valentine's Day.\nType of Food: Pasta, Vegetarian, and Vegetarian Main.\nI Don't Eat: Meat.\n\nOriginally posted on Thursday, September 15th, 2011\n\n3 Responses to \u201cProcrastination Cooking: Handmade Gnocchi\u201d\n\n  1.

        "text":"Saturday, December 26, 2009\n\nFish Bones @ Chelmsford, MA\n\n\u00a0FishBonesWhen our friends, Siaw Lay and Alan was in town, we brought them to our favorite seafood restaurant in Chelmsford. Fish Bones offer a selection of fresh and yummy seafood dishes as well as a selection of fresh & raw seafood. Yes, it\u2019s got a little fish market inside! It probably felt weird to some, eating at the fish market\u2026.but hey just imagine that\u2019s a whole display of desserts! Haha!\n\nThe first time we were there, the place was small, tables were limited and it was quite a wait during dinner time. They have expanded since and offer more seating within the premises. We brought our guests there during lunch on a week day. There weren\u2019t much patrons, hence we were seated immediately. The interior was quite tastefully decorated and the new wing even had a gorgeous (faux?) fireplace.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what we ordered that day:\n\n1) Seafood Chowder (Bottom Left) @ $3.99\/per cup. I ordered this yummy creamy cup of satisfaction which was the soup of the day! I believe the soup was a cream base, filled with chunks of scallops, clams?, fish and shrimp. I would definitely order this the next time I\u2019m there!\n\n2) Clam Chowder (Bottom Right) @ $3.99\/per cup. Hubby and Alan ordered this. It was filled with clams and potatoes. I did not like this very much as I think they added a lil\u2019 too much dill (I assume)in the soup. The dill was a bit overpowering.\n\n\n3) Calamari Basket (Bottom Left) @ $8.99. Point Judith Calamari, deep fried to golden brown served with a side of their spicy Chipotle sauce. This was very good! The calamari were very fresh and lightly coated in the batter, which was fried to a golden perfection. I forgot how the Citpotle sauce tasted, though. Not sure if I even had it. I might have eaten the fried calamari plain.\n\n4) Lobster Roll (Bottom Right) @ $14.99. A toasted roll filled with lobster salad, served with fries and coleslaw. The price was quite decent for a lobster roll plus 2 sides. I\u2019ve seen lobster rolls (no sides, nothing) being priced at $14.99. Alan ordered this dish and commented that it was decent and the lobster meat was chopped a bit too finely. I think he said that wasn\u2019t the best lobster roll he had.\n\n\n5) Maryland Crab Cake Sandwich (Bottom Left) @ $11.99. Two homemade Maryland style crab cakes served on a freshly made Brioche burger roll with lettuce, tomato, pickles, fries and homemade coleslaw. Siaw Lay ordered this and I forgot what was her comment on it. They surely looked delicious! It was however, one of my first? time seeing a deep fried crab cake. I\u2019ve usually eaten crab cakes, pan fried style only.\n\n6) Luncheon Grill Mix (Bottom Right) @ $10.99. Grilled swordfish tips, tuna tips and two large shrimp served over a bed of rice pilaf with grilled assorted vegetables. Hubby ordere this and he loved it! He cleaned the plate so fast!!!\n\n\u00a0FishBones8 FishBones9\n\n7) Sesame Steak Tuna Sandwich (Bottom) @ $9.99. Grilled Sushi Grade #1 yellow fin tuna, marinated in sesame oil and coated in sesame seeds and grilled to temperature, served on a freshly baked brioche burger roll with seaweed salad, lettuce, tomato, pickles, homemade coleslaw and fries. This was mine, mine, MINE!! I ordered the tuna cooked rare, but it came to me almost like medium rare. I was surely disappointed as I prefer my tuna just lightly seared on the outside and very very rare in the inside. The tuna however was surprisingly still very moist and flavorful in the inside\u00a0 and I still enjoyed it despite the tuna being \u201covercooked\u201d to me. When the waitress came around and asked how was everyone\u2019s food, I told her about mine. She was nice to apologize and mentioned she could bring us a dessert on the house (which was a nice gesture). She also said to order the tuna steak sandwich, sushi style so that it will be cooked rare to my preference. Tips, noted!\n\n\nWe unfortunately did not have any room left in our tummy\u2026\u2026.So, we actually had to pass on the free dessert!! Haha! Service and food were all good!!! And that was why it\u2019s one of our favorite seafood places!\n\nIf you\u2019re in town, or if you\u2019re willing to drive to Chelmsford\u2026.give Fish Bones a try! Lunch would probably be less busy and you most likely need not wait. There are plenty of parking behind the premises\u2026you would have to drive slower as you approach the address as you might miss the entrance into the parking lots. During the summer, Fish Bones also offer some outdoor seating for those who want to get a bit of sunshine. And if you want to see the chefs busy in action, there are also some bar seats overlooking the kitchen!\n\nCheck out Fish Bone\u2019s restaurant HERE and their Fish Market HERE.\n\nNo comments:\n\nRelated Posts with Thumbnails",

        "text":"Eat and Go\n\nLast Saturday, Ian and I decided to have window shopping and food trip at the same time. I met Ian at Megamall around 11:15am after his Annual Physical Examination at Health Way. Our first activity for the day was to buy gifts for Jap and Beth's Wedding this coming Saturday, March 27. So we off to Department Store and bought our special gifts for them and have it wrapped for free. Then, the next thing we do is to have our lunch since it's already 12noon. Ian already done canvassing where to have our luscious lunch, he suggest to try the Eat and Go Restaurant located at the Atrium.\n\nAt first, we greeted by a courteous waitress and accompanied us at the couch. Since it was our first time to try this restaurant, we consume more than 5 minutes to finalized our orders. Finally, we settled to have our appetizer first, no other than our favorite Caesar Salad. There is no special thing in the salad; it's the usual Lettuce, crunchy croutons, bacon bits, and Caesar dressings, but we really enjoyed eating salad which makes my mind to order it once more when we visit this restaurant someday.\n\nCaesar Salad Php 145.00\nIan choose to have Chicken Saltimbocca with roasted pepper rice and pasta in red sauce. The Chicken Saltimbocca is an oven baked chicken filet stuffed with ham and cheese and of course, the Saltimbocca sauce.\nChicken Saltimbocca Php 165.00\n\nI ordered Pork Tenderloin with pepper rice and Carbonara. It is a pan-seared pork tenderloin slices with brown gravy as a sauce.\nPork Tenderloin Php 165.00\nOf course, I cannot eat without my favorite hot sauce. So I requested Ian to find one for us.\nFor drinks, Ian prefers to try Kiwi Lime Grande. Remember, this is also one of his favorite fruits which he ordered as one of the side toppings during our food trip in Red Mango.\nKiwi Lime (Grande) Php 90.00\nI'm not a fan of Strawberry; in fact I often eat strawberry fruits. Ian influences me to try the Berry Strawberry. At first, I refuse to try it but I'm just curious what does it taste. So definitely, I ordered Berry Strawberry.\nBerry Strawberry Php 70.00\nAs usual, our date will not be complete without picture taking... ^_^\n\nus :)\n\nEat and Go\nLevel 3 Mega Atrium\nSM Megamall",

Then you have most certainly come to the right place.

One doozy of a way to elevate this already bangin\u2019 sauce and to finally use up those going stale dinner rolls is to make a dark chocolate and cranberry sauced bread pudding.

        "text":"\n\nLife as a Mom, A Homesteader, A Blogger and A Wife.\n\nGluten Free For a Day\n\nWhen we agreed to welcome a young friend to visit for the day we realized we had a little work to do, as our pal cannot eat gluten. We have become accustomed to our milk\/egg\/tree nut\/agave free kitchen but gluten can be tricky! I turned to the internet and planned a gluten free AND kid-friendly menu. Here is what we came up with:\n\nAnnie's Gluten Free Mac and Cheese\n\nI found this at the local Whole Foods and paid about $3 for a box. I generally pay around $1 for a traditional boxed Mac And Cheese but for gluten free this seemed reasonable.\n\nOur Thoughts: We were surprised at how yummy this was. Abby couldn't have it because of the cheese but everyone else (especially our visitor) loved it. It was kid friendly and had great texture. I found it a nice option for gluten free but not what I would expect for Mac and Cheese.\n\nWe paired our lunch with some nice watermelon and carrots as both are blissfully celiac approved!\n\nAfter lunch I made sure to have something sweet on hand. It turns out one of our Abby-friendly vegan desserts is also sans gluten. We ALWAYS keep some Zen Brand Vegan Pudding on hand. Fortunately, it is also a safe option for our visitor.\n\nOur Thoughts: This was clearly a win! We always have a least one 4-pack in our fridge at all times. I pay between $2.50 and $3.50 for a four pack. It is Abby's absolute favorite and the chocolate would please even a picky non-vegan gluten eater.\n\nOur play date went perfectly and the food seemed like any other day with a house full of kids. We are learning more and more about this gluten free lifestyle and thankfully there are more and more wonderful recipes and options for the gluten free family!\n\n\n\n\nAbout this blog\n\nOver 8 years we have struggled through 3 IUI's, 6 rounds of IVF, several RE's, hundreds of appointments and the loss of three little angels. Now we find ourselves the proud parents of two perfect little girls and a wonderful little boy!!\n\nBoth of our girls struggle with some disabilities but that won't keep us down. Each day has it's own brand of insanity but we love it. Most days I am more monkey wrangler than mother but I do the best I can. Todays goal - getting to tomorrow.\n\nSearch This Blog\n\nFollow us through pictures!\n\nFollow us through pictures!\n\nGFAF Blogger\n\nGFAF Blogger\n\n\nBlog Archive\n\nThere was an error in this gadget\n\u00a9 2006\u20132015.

Je souhaite montrer dans ce blog les liens entre les deux \u00e2ges du caviar fran\u00e7ais: celui qui s'\u00e9tend des ann\u00e9es vingt aux ann\u00e9es soixante et celui qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 il y a vingt ans. L'aventure \u00e9conomique actuelle est \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en rapport avec les efforts de conservation ou plut\u00f4t de r\u00e9introduction de l'esp\u00e8ce locale, le sturio.\n\ncontact: monbeaucaviar@rphg.eu\n\ndimanche 8 mai 2011\n\nThe meat of the sturgeon\n\nIs the price of caviar a curse that prevent sturgeon meat to be cooked as it deserves to be ?\n\nThirty years ago, the European Sturgeon was already on the brink of being extinct, even in the Gironde estuary, the last area where it was still rather abundant in the early twentieth century. A\u00a0 French research center decided to raise the endangered species. However, since they needed first to train the breeding methods on a easier fish, Siberian sturgeons were imported from USSR. Since fish farms were involved in the project, it was planned\u00a0 to make sturgeon raising profitable by selling the fish as a high-quality product, for instance to local famous restaurants; recipes were ordered from Michelin starred chefs.\nSome attempts were even made to promote the cooking of sturgeon meat at home:\n\nretrouver ce m\u00e9dia sur www.ina.fr\n\nThis video comes from one of the most famous cooking TV programs in the 1990s: la Cuisine des Mousquetaires (Musketeers' Cooking) co-anchored by Ma\u00eft\u00e9 (Ordonez)and Micheline (Banzet). When this episode was recorded, in may 1993, the caviar production had just started the same year in a first fish farm, le Moulin de la Cassadote. The sturgeon beheaded and sliced ferociously by Ma\u00eft\u00e9 came from another fish farm from the same area south of Bordeaux (this partly explains why the fish is cooked with Saint Emillion \"\u00e0 la bordelaise\"). The main aim of this episode was to explain how simple sturgeon cooking was: no bones, a firm flesh (texture and taste close to those of veal) and adaptable to many different recipes. This good side of the sturgeon was more recently explained by Cal Elliot, executive chef from Rye's restaurant (NYC) in a video from one of my favourite food blogs: Food. Curated.\n\nBut in France, fish farms soon gave up the idea to raise the sturgeon mostly for its meat: prices on the fish market were not as high as expected, and in the late 1990s, when caviar production was eventually mastered, the value of the black pearl made the meat a mere by-product. But it's an emabarassing one: to produce a kilogram of caviar, you need to kill a female sturgeon weighing almost ten times more. Moreover, males are killed when they are three or four years old: fish farms have to get rid of a huge quantity of fish. Filets have been exported to Russia by Sturgeon, the leader producer in France, but a good share of the fish slaughtered are used to... feed other fishes.\nThis is considered by some as a shame in the country whose cuisine made recently the World Heritage list. I's even more outrageous considering the long history of sturgeon recipes, dating back to the late middle ages, when the great fish was a meal for princes and kings. One of the first testimonies was published when modern cooking emerged from the medieval one thanks to the Italian influence.In its \"Ouverture de cuisine\", lancelot de Casteau, cook of the bishops-princes of Liege, listed a number of possibilities to trasform the flesh of the sturgeon as a meat, most of the time like veal.\n\nto be continued......\n\nAucun commentaire:\n\nEnregistrer un commentaire",

        "text":"Wine Tasting\n\nWine Tasting\n\n[ Mar.2018 ] Our full city tour in Buenos Aires in Argentina finished in front of a restaurant called Freud & Fahler, which was near our hotel in Palermo.\n\nWe said goodbye to Elisabet, our guide, who had looked after us for three days, and went into the closed restaurant.\n\nElisabet had arranged a wine tasting for us here.\n\nThe person who welcomed us was Diego, a young and serious sommelier.\n\nHe does this wine tasting service after the restaurant closes.\n\nThe wine map was hung in a part of the empty restaurant and we sat at the table in front of it.\n\nThe main wine-producing areas in Argentina are the Mendoza province in the West and the Salta province in the North.\n\nSome people of Italian origin started making wine there.\n\nThe main grape they produce is Malbec.\n\nMalbec is originally from France and it is said that it was brought to Argentina in the mid-19th century through Chile.\n\nAccording to Diego, Malbec means \u201cbad flavour\u201d in French because they did not think it was a good variety for wine. However, when they started growing it in Argentina, it became a very good grape.\n\nEven now, if you compare the one grown in France and the one grown in Argentina, they are so different that people cannot believe they are the same variety.\n\nWe tasted one white wine, one ros\u00e9 and three kinds of red wine.\n\nI did not know that they made any white or ros\u00e9 wines in Argentina.\n\nThis ros\u00e9 had a unique flavour and I liked it.\n\nDiego told us that an Italian person from Tuscany recently started producing this ros\u00e9 wine and, because the production is small, they only make half bottles.\n\nWhat made the strongest impact on me was the last red wine produced in the Salta province.\n\nIt is too difficult to describe the taste, but it was very strong, heavy and thick, so at first I thought it was too strong for me, but after the second or third mouthful, I started liking it.\n\nIts name is RD and there is a story behind it:\n\nOne American wine critic and one French wine producer, both of whom are acknowledged as experts in the industry, heard rumour of this wine and went all the way to the winery, which is deep in the Salta province.\n\nThe stubborn owner tried to turn them away, saying \u201cI do not want my wine evaluated and listed in any charts and I do not want my wine to be sold in any chain stores\u201d.\n\nThe two held out, insisting \u201cAt least let us taste your wine\u201d and, in the end, this incident led him to start selling his wine to a small number of restaurants and shops.\n\nNow, you can visit this winery but if you are welcomed in or not is dependent on his mood, apparently.\n\nThe alcohol content of this wine was 15%.\n\nGenerally, the wine from the Salta province has a high sugar content and the alcohol content is at least 14%.\n\nDiego said he has come across one with 16.9%.\n\nDuring our tasting, they served us bite-size foods for each wine.\n\nOne was a local ham served with the fourth wine and I was impressed by this ham more than by the wine.\n\nIt tasted somewhere between Italian cured ham and a Spanish one and it was very good.\u00a0\n\nThe dish they served with the last wine, RD, was a piece of cheese with some sweet fruits.\n\nA little could be drunk with dessert.\n\nIt was a very nice experience feeling Diego\u2019s enthusiasm for wine, but unfortunately we were already full because of our big lunch, which was a shame.\n\nThis experience made us want to visit Mendoza and Salta.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Not only is it enjoyable to measure, combine, and make a multitude, permitting kids to cook dinner offers them so many different lifelong benefits.\n\nRemove the plate from the oven with oven gloves and sit it on a wooden chopping board. Take away the sausages and black pudding from the frying pan with the cooking tongs and sit them on the plate. Nonetheless sporting the oven gloves, place the sheet of tinfoil (shiny side down) over the plate and tuck it in around the edges to type a seal. That may hold the objects warm whereas the remainder of the breakfast is cooked.\n\nSince I didn't lose any weight yesterday, I was eager to see what I weighed this morning. SURE! I lost another2 pounds. I am really not fearful if there are days that I do not lose, or even if there are days that I am going up. Changes within the climate, in salt consumption, in ANYTHING can really throw a wrench into things. You need to have a look at it as a whole, actually, and never every day. However, for the sake of this Slim Fast Review and to determine if Slim Quick actually works, I'll continue with my day by day weigh-ins.\n\nObserve: I completely had an vitality crash at about 3:00 p.m. at this time! I wasn't positive if it was the Slim Fast that did it, but after thinking about it, I've had a really onerous time sleeping this weekend and my schedule has totally been thrown off. I did perk up some after dinner, however quickly went back to feeling sluggish; we'll see tomorrow if that feeling passes.\n\nI noticed I was feeling thinner however the scale wasn't budging. Did some analysis and it seems it is doable to burn fats and never drop a few pounds on the dimensions. So I started measuring myself across the waist and I can see progress this fashion for sure. I find it irresistible and I'm sticking with it regardless that the size is not budging as a result of my pants fit better and my measurements are enhancing!",

As with a sushi counter, you will enjoy the experience with all five senses.\u201d\n\nWe thought we\u2019d step it up from the dull Margherita (which, as reported yesterday, was just an unseasoned tomato squished onto some chewy dough), to something \u201csexier,\u201d like the \u201cMarinara \u30de\u30ea\u30ca\u30fc\u30e9\u201d \u2014 tomato sauce, garlic, oregano, basil \u30c8\u30de\u30c8\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cb\u30f3\u30cb\u30af\u30fb\u30aa\u30ec\u30ac\u30ce\u30fb\u30d0\u30b8\u30eb \u2014(1550 yen; $14.50 approx).\n\nIt was like \u201cdeja vu all over again.\u201d The crust was thin and chewy, and while the garlic and oregano spiced things up a bit, there was something wrong with the olive oil. It tasted \u201coff.\u201d (Might as well have been motor oil, as far as I was concerned.)\n\nUltimately, this disappointing rendition of yet another classic pie barely missed an \u201cF,\u201d and squeezed by with a near-failing \u201cC-.\u201d\n\n\nFollow Lucas on Instagram: @lucasaferrara",
