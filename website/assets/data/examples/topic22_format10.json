        "text":"Mecum credits this movie car with starting the restomod craze.\n\nThis year's Mecum Kissimmee auction event turned out to be an impressive one for movie-star Mustangs. Following Friday's record-setting sale of the Bullitt Mustang, the action continued Saturday with the Gone In 60 Seconds hero car \u2013 aka, Eleanor \u2013 selling for $852,500! It's been 20 years since this movie remake made its box office premier, and in that time, this gray and black 1967 Shelby GT500 has become one of the most recognizable movie cars of all time.\n\nIn an interesting side note, the unique molds used to originally create the Eleanor\u00a0Mustangs sold as a separate lot for $20,000.\n\n1967 Ford Mustang Hero Car From 'Gone In 60 Seconds' Up For Grabs\n\nAnyone can go out and get an officially licensed Eleanor Mustang for under $200,000, but an actual hero car from the movie is definitely what brought in the big bids. This car was one of 11 Shelby GT500 clones built for the movie by Cinema Vehicle Services wearing identical Pepper Gray paint jobs with Black racing stripes, but don't worry, this one wasn't used for any of the intense jump scenes. Instead, this particular stunt car was used as the \"Dream Car\" being filmed in chase scenes in the ship yard, L.A. River and throughout the city.\n\nAs if its life wasn't pampered enough already, this Eleanor Mustang fastback is fresh off a rotisserie restoration, which was also completed by Cinema Vehicle Services. Under the hood, this Eleanor is rocking a blueprinted 351 CID V8 that has been beefed up with aluminum heads, Edelbrock intake, roller camshaft, MSD ignition and headers with side-exit exhaust. No word on power output, but the nitrous system brings an extra 100-125 horsepower to the party. The Tremec TKO five-speed manual and positraction rear end with 3.70 gears help lay down all that power, while the Wilwood disc brakes makes sure this car can still stop on a dime.\u00a0\n\nGallery: 1967 Ford Mustang Hero Car From 'Gone In 60 Seconds' Up For Grabs\n\nThis movie-used Eleanor has just 90 miles on the odometer since it was fully restored, and most of these miles were apparently spent doing burnouts for a publicity video, which you can see below.",

        "text":"OOIDA board meets\n\nBy Sandi Soendker, editor-in-chief\n\nMembers of the OOIDA Board of Directors, executive officers, D.C. office and others assembled Oct. 21-25 at OOIDA headquarters in Grain Valley, Mo., and spent four days conducting Association business and producing a substantial work agenda for 2016.\n\nThe full board of 22 directors from all over the U.S. and Canada approved the Association's strategies for legislative issues, legal actions and significant regulatory participation.\n\nBoard members approved minutes from the previous meeting and heard the finance and business report from OOIDA President and CEO Jim Johnston and Chief Operating Officer Rod Nofziger.\n\nGovernment affairs. The overview on federal matters was presented by Executive Vice President Todd Spencer and Director of Government Affairs Laura O'Neill-Kaumo with assistance from Ben Siegrist of the Association's government affairs staff. They updated the board on regulatory affairs and legislative matters.\n\nThe six-year House highway bill was a big topic. OOIDA's D.C. office has worked furiously on Capitol Hill for the bill to include critical requirements members support and to keep language out that would open the door to rulemakings the Association opposes. O'Neill-Kaumo provided a rundown of what was in and what was out of the fast-moving bill. Managing Editor Jami Jones has an update on this legislation at press time, Page 24.\n\nRegulatory affairs. Director of Regulatory Affairs Scott Grenerth updated board members on the regulatory plan developed by the Association in an effort to promote a true safety-minded agenda in D.C. while countering overbearing regs that do little to improve highway safety and that simply drive up the cost of business. The big-ticket issues were EPA-NHTSA's greenhouse gas phase 2; electronic logging devices, insurance minimums; and entry-level driver training.\n\nEarlier this year, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration launched a negotiated rulemaking. As part of that process the Entry-Level Driver Training Committee, composed of dozens of industry stakeholders, was tasked with hammering out the framework for a driver training regulation. Grenerth was in D.C. as part of the committee, along with Board Member Bryan Spoon of Grandy, N.C., representing Spoon Trucking. Grenerth called the work of the Entry-Level Driver Training Committee \"a huge effort.\" The proposed rulemaking is projected to publish in December 2015.\n\nSpoon said he thought the positive results that were reached at the meetings provided the foundation for a minimum standard.\n\n\"Is it 2,000 hours? No. But at least we got enough to effectively shut down CDL mills. I'd say overall it was successful.\"\n\nSpoon said he'd like to see more negotiated rulemakings.\n\n\"Frankly, it worked,\" said Grenerth.\n\nLawsuit update. OOIDA's Litigation Counsel Paul Cullen Sr. and Paul Cullen Jr. reported on the Association's litigation activities, including details on the successful conclusions of OOIDA's lawsuits against Comerica Bank, C.R. England and Swift Transportation. The attorneys detailed a status report on several other active cases, including the proceedings in OOIDA's court battle with the California Air Resources Board over the Truck and Bus rule. LL",

        "text":"Tesla Electric Semi Coming After Model 3 Sedan\n\nFeb 27, 2017 07:10 AM EST | BC Tabotabo\n\n\nThe Tesla Electric Semi truck is still in development. Currently, it is taking the backseat because\u00a0the Model 3 is the company's top priority for their development team.\n\nAccording to The Daily Dot, Elon Musk, the CEO of the Silicon Valley electric vehicle manufacturer, confirmed the news on the Semi truck via Twitter. Musk stated that the company's Jerome Guillen still continues to apply his electric truck know-how to their Semi project.\n\nOriginally posted last summer, there has been widespread interest in the company's electric commercial truck. Back then, Musk claimed that the early versions of the Semi-electric truck and possibly buses could be released this year.\n\nGuillen initially worked for Daimler in a leading role in its venture with Freightliner. This was done through the US Department of Energy's SuperTruck initiative. They heavy duty test truck first rolled out in 2010 and was able to get 12.2 miles per gallon fuel economy rating. This was double the DOE's initial goal for the SuperTruck program.\n\nIn 2012, Guillen transferred to Tesla. According to Hybrid Cars, the Silicon Valley company also hired other key Daimler engineers who also worked on the same program such as Evan Chenoweth. Chenoweth was formerly the lead designer of Freightliner's SuperTruck hybrid engine. He is now a senior mechanical design engineer for Musk's company.\n\nClean Semi trucks and urban medium-duty trucks are getting more and more support and credibility. This is because the US government keeps on issuing more stringent fuel economy and emissions rules. Last year, Mercedes-Benz even introduced its Urban eTruck, which can allegedly go up to 124 miles on a single charge. This is ideal for urban delivery as well as short hauls most especially because it can meet clean air rules.\n\nNikola Motor Co. and Toyota are also gaining attention for their efforts with green vehicles. Nikola One is a zero-emission heavy-duty truck that runs on a lithium-ion battery pack as well as hydrogen fuel cells. Toyota's Mirai fuel cell is also expanding into new markets. Honda has also developed a Clarity fuel cell of their own.\n\nThe Tesla Semi truck may still come later this year. Do you think it will be as important or even more important than the Tesla Model 3?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nBy Bottom Line\n\nThe Jetsons would feel right at home in Nevada -- which this month became the first state in the nation to formally approve legislation authorizing the use of autonomous vehicles on its roadways.\n\nThe once far-fetched idea is becoming more and more grounded every day as manufacturers work to develop technology that could permit a motorist to plug in a destination and let the vehicle drive there automatically. Indeed, Google has become a leader in autonomous technology, with several prototypes already logging over 160,000 miles in test runs.\n\nWhile most experts contend the technology is still years away from widespread application, Nevada lawmakers apparently couldn\u2019t wait.\u00a0 Last summer, lawmakers there ordered state regulators to establish rules covering the use of autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe regulations have now been finalized -- and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles will now have to formalize licensing procedures for companies that want to test their vehicles in the state.\n\n\u201cNevada is the first state to embrace what is surely the future of automobiles,\u201d said Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Director Bruce Breslow in a press release. \u201cThese regulations establish requirements companies must meet to test their vehicles on Nevada\u2019s public roadways as well as requirements for residents to legally operate them in the future.\u201d\n\nThe decision to act was apparently driven, at least in part, by Google, which has wanted to ensure that its autonomous vehicle test program wasn\u2019t operating in a legal limbo.\u00a0 Google formally launched its research and development program in 2010 and has so far recorded not a single collision.\n\nWhile such vehicles will effectively handle the serious driving chores they will also require someone to be in the position of \u201coperator,\u201d ready to take over just in case of a technical glitch.\u00a0 That\u2019s likely one reason why Nevada maintained one key restriction in the new rules.\n\n\u201cThere is no exemption for drinking and driving,\u201d cautioned Breslow, meaning the bartender or bouncer won\u2019t be able to toss you in the back seat, hit the Start button and send you speeding home.\n\nOn the other hand, regulators did give the operator permission to text and use a handheld cellphone.\n\nThe operator, at least for now, will need to have a special license.\u00a0 And the vehicles will be required to use an airline-style \u201cblack box\u201d to track its operation, with data to be turned over to the state.\n\nManufacturers will be required to post bonds of between $1 million and $3 million, meanwhile, and they will have to advise the state as to when and where they\u2019ll be testing their vehicles.\n\nGoogle is just one of the players in the rapidly expanding field.\u00a0 General Motors has run several tests, including one that required the installation of special sensors in a stretch of Interstate highway north of San Diego.\u00a0 It has also been working with Pittsburgh\u2019s Carnegie-Mellon University on a self-driving Chevrolet Tahoe SUV, dubbed The Boss.\n\nBMW, meanwhile, has a number of test vehicles in operation, including one that it recently took to the treacherous Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca near Monterey, California.\n\nAnd Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval was given a personal demonstration of what the new law might cover when he was chauffeured in an autonomous Toyota Prius that used radar and other sensors to help guide it to its destination.",

If a councillor or the mayor says they want to build a subway, this is a test of whether they are serious or not about doing it.\"\n\nMayor Rob Ford has said repeatedly that he will not support toll roads.

        "text":"Arizona bill to split car and truck speeds dies\n\n| Wednesday, April 09, 2008\n\nA bill that has died in the Arizona House sought to require large trucks traveling along certain stretches of interstates to slow down by 5 mph. It missed a deadline to advance from committee, effectively killing it for the year.\n\nState law now allows all traffic to drive 65 mph on interstate highways outside urban areas with populations of at least 50,000. The Arizona Department of Transportation also can set speeds on rural portions of interstates at 75 mph.\n\nKyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, introduced a bill that would have slowed large trucks by 5 mph along interstates posted with 65 mph speed limits. The measure \u2013 HB2314 \u2013 required vehicles in excess of 26,000 pounds declared gross weight to drive 60 mph.\n\nAll other vehicles would have been allowed to continue to travel at the current 65 mph speed limit.\n\nSupporters said requiring trucks to drive at speeds slower than over vehicles would make for safer travel.\n\nOpponents said slowing trucks down to speeds slower than other vehicles does not promote safety on the highways. In fact, they said it does exactly the opposite by requiring that vehicles are constantly in conflict with each other.\n\nWord of the bill\u2019s demise was well received by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association.\n\nOOIDA Executive Vice President Todd Spencer pointed out that 40 states now have uniform speed limits for all vehicles using their highways. \u201cThe only speed limit policy that makes any sense is the kind that has all vehicles traveling at the same speed,\u201d he told Land Line.\n\nThe effort to reduce truck speed limits can be brought back for consideration during the 2009 session.\n\nTo view other legislative activities of interest for Arizona, click here.\n\n\u2013 By Keith Goble, state legislative editor",

        "text":"Other Battery Makers Filled With Uncertainty After Tesla Battery Day\n\nThe EV battery makers were probably not too happy to see what Tesla is going to do.\n\nAfter yesterday\u2019s Tesla Battery Day, third-party lithium-ion battery manufacturer might be quite surprised and uncertain about the future.\n\nTesla\u00a0clearly continues on its path of vertical integration, hinting at significant improvements on the technological level and advancing also on the in-house battery production front.\n\nThe pilot plant for 4680 cells is expected to reach a production output of 10 GWh annually at some point in 2021, which alone is a huge level. The target of 100 GWh in 2022 is also very ambitious.\n\nTesla\u2019s Elon Musk said that the automaker will continue to purchase cells from existing (and maybe new) suppliers, because it will not be able to produce enough of its own batteries anyway, but still the share price of the biggest EV battery manufacturers declined.\n\nAccording to Automotive News, LG Chem went down by 5.5%, CATL by 4.7%, while Panasonic by 4.3%.\n\nInvestors are clearly aware that Tesla is pushing hard to reduce costs and increase energy density. It\u2019s a challenging race, which requires tons of R&D investments to keep up with the leaders.\n\nWill the ordinary battery makers from electronics and chemical industries be able to offer a competitive solution for a company like Tesla, which has an advantage of vertical integration? They would have to closely partner with other carmakers to jointly develop battery systems deeply integrated with the vehicles.\n\nSource: Read Full Article",

That was the case for Ventura Resident Jen Mowad.\n\nLike many others Mowad couldn't find sandbags this morning telling FOX 11 News the city of Ventura ran out Sunday night.\n\nA firefighter at a local station told us the same thing just moments after a big truck dumped 1000 pre-filled bags that locals immediately started to grab. Ventura County has a sandbagging machine where they can pre-fill. But, for some locations that got sand by midday, like Poinsettia Pavilion, it came in deliveries that looked like small mountains.\n\nThe run on sandbags was an example of just how concerned some in this coastal city feel as a big storms moves their way.\n\nAuthorities say stay alert!\n\nCopyright 2018 FOX 11 Los Angeles : Download our mobile app for breaking news alerts or to watch FOX 11 News | Follow us on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and YouTube .",
