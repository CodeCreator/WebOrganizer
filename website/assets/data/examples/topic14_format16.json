It is ideal for cantilever and swim-out installations. If this product is installed on a wall, the wall will be saturated by water giving it a refreshing look. The other option is to have it extend out from the wall, giving it a free-fall style.\n\nSheer curtain waterfalls make for a remarkable addition to any new, remodeled, or existing pool or spa. This will create a relaxed and elegant feel to any pool area, which will allow the swimmers to enjoy an enticing feature. This attraction is appealing to the eye and raises the standard for in-ground pools.\n\n  \u2022 6\" Extended Lip Waterfall\n  \u2022 3 Feet in Length\n  \u2022 Creates a clear sheet of water that descends gracefully to the pool surface.\n  \u2022 Clear Lip\n  \u2022 X-Baffle Construction\n  \u2022 PVC Construction\n  \u2022 Water feeds from the back of the waterfall.\n\nWaterfalls naturally narrow as they fall. Waterfalls should not be installed more than 3 1\/2 feet above the water surface or the sheet will start to break up.\n\nOne of the advantages of the Sheer Curtain Waterfall is the ability to provide a continuous sheet of water with a minimum of water flow. As a general rule, the Sheer Curtain Waterfall requires approximately 12 gallons per minute per foot. For a more dramatic effect, more water gallonage can be applied to project the waterfall further away from the wall.\n\nJandy 1203CSC",

Unleash the holiday hygge, the outdoor range cooker is here!\n\nI know, I know it\u2019s nearly summer and I\u2019m talking about wood-burners but bear with; you are definitely going to want to hear this! In twenty years of writing about gardening I\u2019ve never come across anything like it: an outdoor wood-burner you can cook on, because wood-burners aren\u2019t just for Christmas!\n\nYou use it to heat and eat \u2013 think outdoor range cooker but with added summer-holiday hygge. Chill and grill by day, and come the evening, sit out under the stars and party like it\u2019s\u00a0the Caribbean not chilly Crediton.\n\nThe Heat & Grill is made by Chesneys, as loved by cheferati James Martin and interior designer Kelly Hoppen; they\u2019re best known for their ultra-efficient, environmentally-friendly wood stoves. Part of the new HEAT range, the less fancy version is called the Clean Burn, which is just an outdoor wood-burner and there\u2019s an upscaled version if you\u2019ve got a big family or are a natural party animal.\u00a0\n\nJust like your indoor wood-burner it has a flue but because it\u2019s built for outdoors, there\u2019s no installation cost and it has two wheels on the back, so it\u2019s a moveable feast (though yes, it\u2019s heavy and don\u2019t move when it\u2019s lit obvs!).\u00a0\n\nFill up the wood-burner with wood and kindling, light in the normal way and once the gauge on the top is up to temperature simply flip the lid, and cook a pizza, spatchcock a chicken, barbee some burgers \u2013 you can even bake focaccia or a cake, if you fancy.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also a baffle to flip down in front of the fire so you don\u2019t cook your legs, or hubby\u2019s, as let\u2019s face it, even men who don\u2019t know the oven from their elbow, love a beer and bit of burger flipping on a sunny summer afternoon.\u00a0\n\nWant to know the best bit? There\u2019s very little smoke (so no spluttering over the sausages) and the high heat makes it self-cleaning (yay!). Of course, the outside gets very hot, like any wood-burner, worth bearing in mind if you\u2019ve got littlies.\n\nFancy having a nosey? Get yourself over to The Fire Engine just outside Bideford next Tues 9 and Weds 10 April, when you can see them in action and have a play (it would make a fabulous wedding pressie\u2026). Owners Will and Annette are on fire when it comes to knowing about wood stoves and burners, with a carefully curated range and can tell you about all the latest rules and regs about particle emissions if you\u2019re worried you need an upgrade.\n\nPrices start at \u00a31249 inc VAT for the Clean Burn and come with oven gloves, a metal ash scoop and if you buy before Friday 12 April, The Fire Engine will deliver and set it up for you for free.\n\nFind more ideas here\n\nGardeningGotta Have It\n\nTell us what you think\n\nYour email address will not be published.\n\n* Required\n* Required\n\nLittle Black Book\n\nThe Little Black Book\n\nOur A-Z of the grooviest local businesses to help make your life easier\n\nView the businesses\nHome icon Back Home\n\nThe Urban Guide to the Countryside - Devon",
