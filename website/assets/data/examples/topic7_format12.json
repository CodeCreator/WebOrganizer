Since 2009,\u00a0AmeriCorps St. Louis has partnered with The Winter Outreach Group to open our doors as an emergency winter warming shelter when the temperature falls below 20 degrees. The shelter is facilitated by AmeriCorps St. Louis Members; however, we can\u2019t run it without help from our volunteers!\n\nEvery winter, our shelter is able to provide two hot meals (dinner and breakfast) and a safe place to sleep to approximately 60 homeless men, women and children. Absolutely none of this would be possible without generous donations from the community and the help of our Members and volunteers.\n\n\n\nOur shelter is funded solely through charitable donations.\n\nPlease consider\u00a0making a monetary\u00a0donation\u00a0to be used towards heating and water bills, new sleeping cots, etc.\n\nFor in-kind donations, we are always in need of\u2026\n\nFor guests:\n\n  \u2022 Underwear (women\u2019s and men\u2019s)\n  \u2022 Boxer shorts (all sizes)\n  \u2022 Sports bras (sizes: M, L, XL)\n  \u2022 Towels and washcloths (new or gently used)\n  \u2022 Hygiene products, particularly razors, shaving cream, toothbrushes, toothpaste\n  \u2022 Over the counter medications, such as ibuprofen, Tylenol, cold medicine, multi-vitamins\n  \u2022 Baby diapers, baby wipes, adult diapers\n  \u2022 Feminine products\n  \u2022 Winter jackets\/coats (new or gently used)\n  \u2022 Heavy boots\/ warm shoes\u00a0(new or gently used)\n  \u2022 Warm socks\n  \u2022 HEAVY gloves and mittens\n  \u2022 Backpacks\u00a0(new or gently used)\nFor our facility:\n  \u2022 Coffee (regular and decaf)\n  \u2022 Dish soap\n  \u2022 Dish gloves\n  \u2022 Sponges\n  \u2022 Large, heavy-duty trash bags\nPlease bring donations to 1315 Ann Ave, 63104, or call us to set up a drop off time at 314-772-9002 M-F 9:00am-5:00pm\n\n\n\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!!!\u00a0Our shelter is staffed entirely by volunteers.

Residents are encouraged to become involved in the committee structure of the community. The various committees offer an opportunity to meet other residents, work on projects that are pertinent to a cohesive community, and share one\u2019s unique perspectives. Committee members gather to study issues related to maintaining Willowbend\u2019s lovely grounds and lakes, architectural requests, use and upkeep of the recreational facility, disaster and emergency preparedness, resident understanding and compliance with community rules and regulations, and other ad hoc needs as they arise. If you have ideas about additional committees that would add value to the community, please share your thoughts with the Board of Directors.

Members work with ArtisTree and Sentry Management to assure that private and common areas in Willowbend are consistently well maintained, attractive, and environmentally sensitive. In addition the committee manages the eight lakes on the Willowbend property. The goal is to encourage a proliferation of wild birds, fish and Florida plant life for the pleasure of residents, while adhering to the Sarasota County regulations related to preservation of wild life, lakes, and irrigation resources.\n\nThe second objective of the GL& ARC Committee is to safeguard the discrete and distinctive structural features of the Willowbend community.

When repairs or replacements are needed, the committee researches product quality and price to make an informed recommendation to the Board. They also assure that contracted pool technicians are keeping the swimming pool in pristine condition. A Willowbend resident may reserve the pool and cooking area.

They wanted healthy\u00a0food that respected alternative diets. And they wanted a place flexible enough in price so that a variety of people could afford to come.\n\nThey visited many family camps, improved on the best ideas, and invited people who would be fun to spend a week with and who also happened to be great teachers. Everyone said yes. They contacted all their friends in Brooklyn and Vermont; some came, and some brought friends. Other people heard about the camp through brochures at food co-ops, Waldorf schools, childcare centers, or through Co-op America, homeschooling circles, and local parenting newsletters. The first summer of Camp Common Ground happened miraculously! It was great fun, and we all decided to keep it going\u2026\n\nSince our start in 1994, we\u2019ve grown as an organization, with a volunteer Board of Directors and now a year-round facility in Starksboro, Vermont that is home to Common Ground Center\u2019s many varied programs and events.\n\nCamp Common Ground, our signature family camp program, has remained at the core of what we do here at Common Ground Center, filling a unique niche and serving hundreds of families from over 29 states and 11 countries.\u00a0We have grown into an extended family with some wonderful, devoted campers, a talented and diverse staff, and a dedicated year-round team who works hard to put it all together.\n\nWe loved how we could tailor and decorate each space to create a unique celebration. My grandparents stayed in the Eco-Lodge, my little nieces and nephews loved the cabins, and the whole group enjoyed swimming in the pond.

There will be a bowl passed around at every meeting to collect your check or cash if you ate.\n\nWe meet on the first and third Wednesdays of each month at noon at the Longbranch Best Western on Twixt Town Road. We go through the buffet, eat, and socialize for the first 20 minutes of the hour. After that, the president calls the meeting to order, we say the pledge of allegiance, listen to an invocation, and then get down to business. The meetings end at 1:00 P.M.\n\n\n\nCaution: Sometimes the calendar forces us to move a meeting to avoid\na holiday or something. Refer to the calendar on this site to verify meeting dates\n\n\nThe first Wednesday is generally a business meeting. We plan our projects and talk about upcoming events. The third Wednesday we usually will have a speaker lined up to entertain and inform us. Business discussions at this meeting are usually kept short and sweet to allow the speaker ample time.\n\nAlthough we have awards for perfect attendance, your attendance at the meetings is not required. Makeup opportunities exist for those that want to keep their perfect attendance record intact. If you can't stay for the entire meeting we just ask that you leave quietly when necessary.\n\nThe Larger Organization:\nThe Kiwanis Family has over 600,000 members.

Division 9 consists of Marion Sunrisers Kiwanis, Cedar Rapids Kiwanis, Hi-CREW (Hiawatha Cedar Rapids Edgewood), North Liberty Kiwanis, Marengo Kiwanis, Williamsburg Kiwanis, Vinton Kiwanis, Linn-Mar Key Club, Xavier Key Club, Kennedy Key Club, Prairie Key Club, Mount Mercy Circle K, and Marion Metro Kiwanis.\nThe divisions are joined together to form districts. The Nebraska-Iowa District has 24 divisions that include most of the territory of both states. Each district has a Governor who is responsible for all the divisions. The Lt. Governors lead and assist the clubs in each division.\u00a0 There is a board of regional trustees that preside over the administration of the district. Check out the link for more information on the NE-IA District.\n\nEach year the NE-IA District has two meetings. The first is called the mid-year conference. It offers workshops to the members and holds an awards luncheon. It is usually held on a Saturday in February. The second is called the district convention. It also offers workshops for the members. In addition we hold elections for the district officers. It is usually held on a weekend in August.\n\nThe districts around the world are joined together to form Kiwanis International. Kiwanis International is run by a President and elected trustees from literally around the world. Check out the link for more information on Kiwanis International.\n\nEach year Kiwanis International holds an International Convention somewhere in the world. Workshops are provided for the members and we elect the International Trustees and President. It is usually held around the end of June or the beginning of July and lasts 3-4 days over a long weekend.\nAttendance at these district and international meetings is voluntary. They are fun and informative. You should try to attend at least one.",
