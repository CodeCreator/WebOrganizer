Griffin\u2019s QMS is comprised of a number of inter-related processes that help to institute and control our Quality Policy. These processes are also instrumental in achieving our Quality objectives. Through these processes and our Quality Policy, Griffin has achieved a strong level of consistency which ultimately results in high levels of customer satisfaction and compliance to the International Standard.\n\n\nDuring coating the following methods, forms and tools are used to determine critical dimensions, thickness\u2019, adhesion, curing and batch consistencies.\n\n  1. Griffin form QC001.rev.1.1 to be obtained and filled out with client name, purchase order or packing slip number. Powder manufacturer, paint code and batch number are to be recorded.\n  2. Metal chip to be obtained and run with job in question. This enables us to retain a representation of the coating to be run and obtained for future reference and current testing in event a destructive test is required. If further testing is required a sample of product will be required from the client.\n  3. At intervals during the job the foreman is to physically and non-destructively check film thickness on parts using Defelsko Positector conforming with ASTM \u2013 B499 and record findings on form QC001.rev.1.1. An average film thickness will be recorded along with the high and low finding.\n  4. Technical data sheets and sample chips will be maintained by the Q.C. attendant and referenced for relevant information, i.e. film thickness. Our shop standard is 1.5 to 4 mil film thickness, ranging because of the job shop nature of our business and wide range of powders being used.\n  5. If a curing issue is reported or inconsistency recorded in powder texture a check of temperature visually via digital gauge and then by BYK laser temperature gauge to determine rate of cure versus temperature and line speed cross referenced with technical data sheet. This procedure will foreman and production manager.\n  6. Should an adhesion issue be reported, the Q.C.001.rev 1.1 form will be retrieved from the file with the chip. The data will be analyzed for any possible anomaly and destructively tested via ASTM D3359 conforming cross hatching tool supplied by BYK Gardner Instruments.\n  7. Gloss differences are to be checked visually and reported should the variance be outside a 5\u00b0 difference.",

        "text":"Technical Information\n\nFoundations & Connections\n\nThe design and construction of the tank supports and foundations are critical and should only be undertaken and supervised by competent professionals.\n\nGround level Tanks \u2013 In pressed steel tanks with internal bracing the side wall pressure applied by the water is converted to downward forces in the tank side walls. Maximum loads which can be considerable occur around the perimeter of the tank. Ground level tanks are commonly supported on reinforced concrete dwarf walls fitted with steel capping strips. The purpose of the capping strip is to spread the load over the full width of the support wall and to provide a level platform on which to erect the tank.\n\nFor practical reasons concrete cannot be cast with sufficient accuracy of level. The capping strips should be grouted in place before installation of the tank starts. Recommended tolerance level is +-2mm. Care should be taken to ensure that foundation walls are parallel and square to each other. They must protrude beyond the edge of the tank by a recommended distance of 150mm. The tapered top section of the wall assists in providing access for tools to fasten the tank panel flange bolts.\n\nElevated Tanks \u2013 are commonly founded on reinforced concrete bases with stub columns cast into excavations which are back filled after construction. The determining loads in elevated tank foundation design are dependent on the height of the tower. The determining load for low level tanks is the downward thrust and thus foundation size is governed by the soil bearing pressure. The determining load for high level tanks will be the uplift and thus the anchor effect of foundation and back fill mass will determine foundation size. Maximum up lift occurs when the tank is empty. ABECO supplies full foundation information for each elevated tank purchased to its design.\n\nLoad Terminology\nDead Load: The load created by the mass of the steel tower and an empty tank\nLive Load: The load created by the mass of the water stored\nWind Load: The vertical loads (uplift and down thrust) created by the over tuning effect of wind pressure on the tank and support tower\nSurge Load: The vertical loads similar to wind load created by water surging as the tower sways under wind load\n\nCircular Tanks \u2013 It is important to note that our circular tanks do not require concrete foundations and can be installed on a flat, level and stable site covered by a bed of sand. If a concrete base is required \u2013 a standard mesh reinforcing will suffice. Slender tanks may require fastening down due to wind forces\n\nPipe Connection Points \u2013 are positioned as points selected by the purchaser. Manufacture does not start until this information is supplied. Designers should take care in selecting the pipe connection points to ensure that the piping will not foul tank supports or internal members.\n\nStandard fittings:\nBSP sockets\nFlanges to BS4504 10 bar or SABS 1123 1000kPa welded to stub pipes\nInlet connection flanged inside and outside, otherwise flanged outside only\n\n\nRequest a Quote",

        "text":"Dimensional, form and running accuracy of bearing seats and abutments\n\nThe accuracy of cylindrical bearing seats on shafts and in housing bores, of seats for thrust bearing washers and of the support surfaces (abutments for bearings provided by shaft and housing shoulders etc.) should correspond to the accuracy of the bearings used. In the following, guideline values for the dimensional, form and running accuracy are provided. These should be followed when machining the seats and abutments.\n\nDimensional tolerances\n\nFor bearings made to Normal tolerances, the dimensional accuracy of cylindrical seats on the shaft should be at least to grade 6 and in the housing at least to grade 7. Where adapter or withdrawal sleeves are used, wider diameter tolerances (grades 9 or 10) can be permitted than for bearing seats, see table. The numerical values of standard tolerance grades IT to ISO 286-1:1988 can be found in table. For bearings with higher accuracy, correspondingly better grades should be used.\n\nTolerances for cylindrical form\n\nThe cylindricity tolerances as defined in ISO\u00a01101:2004 should be 1 to 2 IT grades better than the prescribed dimensional tolerance, depending on requirements. For example, if a bearing shaft seat has been machined to tolerance m6, then the accuracy of form should be to IT5 or IT4. The tolerance value t1 for cylindricity is obtained for an assumed shaft diameter of 150\u00a0mm from t1\u00a0=\u00a0IT5\/2\u00a0=\u00a018\/2\u00a0=\u00a09\u00a0\u00b5m. However, the tolerance t1 is for a radius, hence 2t1 applies for the shaft diameter. table provides guideline values for the cylindrical form tolerance and the total runout tolerance for the different bearing tolerance classes.\nWhen bearings are to be mounted on adapter or withdrawal sleeves, the cylindricity of the sleeve seat should be IT5\/2 (for h9) or IT7\/2 (for h10), see table.\n\nTolerances for perpendicularity\n\nAbutments for bearing rings should have a rectangularity tolerance as defined in ISO\u00a01101:2004, which is better by at least one IT grade than the diameter tolerance of the associated cylindrical seat. For thrust bearing washer seats, the tolerance for perpendicularity should not exceed the values of IT5. Guideline values for the tolerance for rectangularity and for the total axial runout can be found in table.\n\nTolerances for tapered journal seats\n\nWhen a bearing is mounted directly onto a tapered shaft seat, the seat diameter tolerance can be wider than in the case of cylindrical seats. Fig 1 shows a grade 9 diameter tolerance, while the form tolerance stipulations are the same as for a cylindrical shaft seat. SKF recommendations for tapered shaft seats for rolling bearings are as follows.\nThe permissible deviation of the taper incline is a \u00b1 tolerance in accordance with IT7\/2 based on the bearing width B (fig 2). The value can be determined by \u0394k = IT7\/2B\n\nThe permissible range of dispersion (variation of the taper incline) thus becomes\n\nVk = 1\/k \u00b1 IT7\/2B\n\n\nVk=the permissible range of dispersion of the taper incline\n\u0394k=the permissible deviation of the taper incline\nk=factor for the taper\n12 for taper 1:12\n30 for taper 1:30\nB=bearing width, mm\nIT7=the value of the tolerance grade, based on the bearing width, mm\n  \u2022 The straightness tolerance is IT5\/2, based on the diameter d and is defined as: \"In each axial plane through the tapered surface of the shaft, the tolerance zone is limited by two parallel lines a distance \"t\" apart.\"\n  \u2022 The radial deviation from circularity is IT5\/2, based on the diameter d and is defined as: \"In each radial plane along the tapered surface of the shaft, the tolerance zone is limited by two concentric circles a distance \"t\" apart.\" When particularly stringent running accuracy requirements are stipulated, IT4\/2 is to apply instead.\nThe best way to check that the taper is within the recommended tolerances is to measure with special tapered gauges, based on two saddles. More practical methods, but less accurate, are to use ring gauges, tapered gauges or sine bars.\nSKF logo",

        "text":"Clear Water Repellent Treatments\n\n(Excerpted from Clear Water Repellent Treatments for Concrete Masonry, published by CMACN and MIA)\n\nRecommendations and Guidelines\n\nIn 1992 the Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada (CMACN) and the Masonry Institute of America (MIA) held several meetings with masonry contractors, concrete block producers, water repellent treatment manufacturers, applicators, architects, and developers to discuss the proper design and construction methods to make concrete masonry buildings water resistant. Numerous recommendations and guidelines were developed including the following:\n\n  1. Pay particular attention to the design phase of the project. Limit horizontal projections, sills, and tops of walls and waterproof those required by the project design with elastomeric coatings. Give special attention to the design of parapets.\n  2. Cross reference the appropriate specifications sections in Division 4 on masonry construction (typically Section 04 22 00 Concrete Unit Masonry) with those in Division 7 on water repellent treatments (typically Section 07 19 00 Clear Water Repellents).\n  3. Specify pre-installation meetings to familiarize all parties with the intended methods for prevention of water penetration. The masonry materials, construction, water repellent treatments, and treatment at joints should be discussed along with the expected results and testing procedures.\n  1. Encourage the use of samples and mockups of masonry construction with the proposed water repellent treatments. Test the mock-ups for water repellency. Mock-up panels should be a minimum 5 ft. by 5 ft. panel and testing should be for at least two hours. Control joints and joint sealants should be included in the mock-up. Tests should be based on the Navy Hose Stream test or a similar field hose stream test.\n  2. Ensure the use of full shoved head and bed joints (mortar for at least the thickness of the face shell of the masonry unit), if necessary through the use of third party inspections.\n  3. Specify double struck joints for exterior masonry construction. Require beeholes visible from 5 to 10 feet to be filled by a qualified mason prior to application of the water repellent treatment.\n  4. Fill cracks that exceed 0.02\" in width or 5% of the joint length with mortar by a qualified mason or with joint sealer by a qualified applicator.\n  5. Apply water repellent treatments in strict accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions and recommendations, by a trained experienced applicator.\n  6. Field test the concrete masonry walls after the water repellent treatment has cured to assure water repellency.\n  7. Require a ten year material and labor warranty from the manufacturer and the applicator through the general contractor.\n\n\nSelecting concrete masonry as an integral part of the building's appearance provides numerous benefits for the designer and the owner. Where the gray color of standard cementitious products might provide a cold appearance, use of integral colors gives concrete masonry a warm appearance. The multitude of concrete masonry textures available provides an almost infinite variety of possibilities for building design. And, cost is typically competitive with other types of construction for many buildings.\n\nApplying a clear water repellent treatment to concrete masonry can maintain the appearance of the concrete masonry while providing protection from water intrusion. Additionally, most clear water repellent treatments will keep the concrete masonry looking cleaner longer since a lower permeability prevents dirt from being drawn into the concrete masonry with the water.\n\n\nProjections and Sills. The cells in concrete masonry construction, and the need to maintain alignment of the cells for reinforcing, limit the tendency of designers to create additional patterns by extending some units beyond the face of the wall. Although this process is possible with concrete masonry, the problems of increased water absorption and penetration through the exposed horizontal surfaces should be considered.\n\nMost clear water repellent treatments are not designed to resist water penetration on horizontal masonry surfaces. Accordingly, ledges formed by projecting units out beyond the face of the wall should be either flashed with sheet metal or patched with an elastomeric coating (see Figure 1).\n\nDense, precast concrete sills, properly sloped and with drip edges, can provide an acceptable sill condition (see Figure 2). Masonry unit sills should also be coated with an elastomeric coating. Avoid mortar sills since they are porous and crack. If used, they should be covered with flashing or coated with an elastomeric coating to prevent water.\n\nFigure 1: Ledge Detail\n\nFigure 2: Sill Details\n\nRead More\n\nAngelus Block Co., Inc. supplies this information as an educational aid in understanding the benefits of concrete masonry construction and our products.

Serial No. 391,879. (No model.) o\n\nTo all whom t may concern:\n\nBe it known that I, ALPHONSE THoUEor, a citizen of the United States, residing at Union township, in the county of Hudson and State of New Jersey, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Vaste and Overflow Connections for Stationary lVash -Tubs, of which the following is a description sufficientto enable others skilled in the art to which the invention appertains to make and use the same.\n\nMy improvements relate more especially to stationary wash-tubs made of cement or concrete with partition-walls. In this class of tubs the metal waste and overflow connections embedded in the cement frequently occasion the rupture of the tubs, owing to the strain to which they subject certain parts of the structure, which frequently has to sustain the Weight of the whole waste-pipe system.\n\nThe object of the first feature of Iny invention is to so combine and form the waste and overflow connections that they .together constitute a metallicbrace or tie which re-enforces and protects the tubs against rupture or injury. Thus instead of being a source of weakness and danger to the tubs, as in the past, I render the overflow and waste connections instrumental in the production of a much stronger and superior article of manufacture as a whole than has heretofore been attained, the connections being actually incorporated with the structure of the tubs and constituting the backbone thereof.\n\nThe first feature of my invention consists in forming the overflow and waste connections into a rigid exterior brace, they ends of which are embedded in the bottom and rear walls of the cement tubs, substantially as hereinafter set forth.\n\nI am aware that overflow-pipes and wastepipes have heretofore been embedded independently in wash-tubs formed of cement, as in Patent No. 384,814, dated June 19,1888, to IVesely, and I do not seek to cover the idea broadly. In fact myimproved construction is designed to overcome and remedy the practical defects attendant upon the actual use of the construction and arrangement shown in the said patent, resulting, for instance,in the frequent cracking and breaking of the concrete walls, owing to excessive strain or inequality of strain upon the waste-head, which, it will be seen, is embedded bodily within the floor at the junction thereof with the par-tition-wall, thus weakening and subjecting` to undue strain the very part of all others of cement tubs that ought to be strengthened and protected. This weakening of the tub referred to, which is the only one of the kind, so far as I know, in which theliquid-discharge passages are embedded directly in the cement, is still further contributed to by the formation of the overflow-passage directly within the partition. The operation of forming the overflow-passage within the partition-wall is also difficult, expensive, and unreliable, since the passage is liable to be contracted orclogged with concrete, the inner surface of which, not being finished like the exterior, readily absorbs moisture and iilth, rendering the contrivance unsafe and unhealthy.v\n\n. Another serious practical objection to the construction shown in the Wesel'y patent, as I have frequently found from actual experience with such tubs under various conditions in dwellings, duc., is that if there is anyconsiderable difference in level between the liquid in two adjoining tubs, or if one be empty and the waste-plug in the tub in which there is a preponderance of pressure is withdrawn, the escaping liquid will drive up the waste-plug in the other tub and enter the latter, owing to the-fact that the waste-head is simply a chamber into which theliquid is discharged on the same level, so that the shape of the waste-head or the resistance in the waste-pipe itself shunts the liquid from one tub to the other. I overcome this diiculty in my construction by, and one feature of my invent-ion consists in, forming a distinct conduit for each waste-sink, the conduits intersecting each other so far below the wasteopenings and at such an angle with relation to each other and to the waste-pipeitself that all possibility of backiiow or the washing out of plugs and comming-ling of contents is positively prevented.\n\n\\Vhile the leading features of my improvements are not necessarily related to concrete tubs re-enforced by metallic frame-work, as set forth in Patent N o.413,861,dated October 29, 1889, there are certain special advantages in using this construction of tub in connec- IOO tion therewith, and my invention includes the combination and arrangement, with the metallic frame-work embedded inthe cement, 0f the waste-pipes connected with the metal frame in such manner that the weight and strain of the pipes are imparted to and distributed by the metallic framework over the structure, thus relieving the cement from undue or dangerous strain and greatly angmenting the strength and stability of the structure as a whole. I also thus practically obviate all trouble or danger from the pulling out or loosening 0f the ends of the pipes embedded in the cement-a difficulty heretofore frequently encountered.\n\nIt. will be seen that by my construction and arrangement of the overflow I am enabled to carry the metallic frame through the body of the partition and to fasten the overflow-head thereto, thereby re-enforcing the part of the structure which is subjected to the greatest strain, a construction that would be impossible in the IVesely device referred to, in which the overflow is a hollow extending the greater portion of the height of the partition.\n\nIn the accompanying drawings, Figure l is a vertical longitudinal section through two tubs constructed according to my invention; Fig. 2, a transverse vertical section upon plane of line x .1', Fig. l, showing the overflow and waste connections in elevation and a portion of the partition broken away to expose the metallic frame, (fue. Fig. 3 is a vertical section, upon a larger scale,of the waste-head, the overflow being shown in elevation. Fig. i is a central vertical section at right angles to Fig. Fig. 5 is a longitudinal section of the strainer-bolt, strainers, the.; Fig. G, an end View of structure shown in Fig.\n\nThe duplex tub A A is formed of concrete or plastic material, as hydraulic cement mixed with freshly-crushed granite or any other suitable material or combination thereof in substantially the same manner heretofore practiced in the manufacture of earthenware tubs, a wire frame-work F being preferably incorporated in the structure, after the mannerprovided for in Letters Patent No. 13,861, hereinbefore referred to.\n\nPrior to the building up of the tubs the Y waste-head D, T-headed overllow C, and connecting exterior overtiow-pipe E are assembled together by suitable means to form a single rigid structure. Thus formed into a single integral piece, the waste and -overflow connections as a whole are placed in position upon and within and are preferably positively attached to the metallic frame F before the cement, the., is applied to the frame. The said connections and the frame F having thus been properly adjusted with relation to each other, the walls of cement N are built up around the T-head C and the upper ends of the branches di d3 of the Y-head D, thus combining and sealing the whole into one inseparable rigid structure of greater strength and durability than -has heretofore been attained in the art- It will be seen that the overfiow C, pipe E, and Y-head D constitute a rigid brace and support for the center and rear of the duplex tub, virtually binding the top and bottom together. Anylstrain caused by the waste-pipe connection with the head D is thus distributed to the tub in such manner as to prevent all possibility of the pulling out of the waste-arms d2 d, since the pipe E and embedded T-head C act as a substan tial anchorage and support for the wastehcad D. This is especially so when the over dow C and the ends of the arms'd2 (Z3 of the waste-head D are connected directly with the metallic frame F, in which case the strain 1s virtually distributed throughout the whole of the structure, practically relieving the cement from all possibility of fracture or distortion. The upper ends d'1 di of the bifurcated arms (Z2 di of the head D are preferably verticalfor a distance equal to the thickness of the bottom of the tubs in which they are embedded, from which points the arms d2 d converge together at such an angle that vtheir point of juncture is some distance below the bottom of the tubs. As a consequence the waste water is conducted directly and positively into the main waste-pipe without any possible contact or interference with the waste plug or opening in the other tub, and all commingling or transfer of liquid from one tub to the other is avoided. The lateral arm e of the exterior overflow E also enters the head D at thejunction c, thus practically constituting a fourway joint at this point and insuring the entrance of the... (truncated)",

Scope\n\n    1.1 This specification covers the requirements for electrodeposited cadmium coatings on products of iron, steel, and other metals.\n\n    Note 1-Cadmium is deposited as a coating principally on iron and steel products. It can also be electrodeposited on aluminum, brass, beryllium copper, copper, nickel, and powder metallurgy parts.\n\n    1.2 The coating is provided in various thicknesses up to and including 25 [mu]m either as electrodeposited or with supplementary finishes.\n\n    1.3 Cadmium coatings are used for corrosion resistance and for corrosion prevention of the basis metal part. The as-deposited coating (Type I) is useful for the lowest cost protection in a mild or noncorrosive environment where early formation of white corrosion products is not detrimental or harmful to the function of a component. The prime purpose of the supplementary chromate finishes (Types II and III) on the electroplated cadmium is to increase corrosion resistance. Chromating will retard or prevent the formation of white corrosion products on surfaces exposed to various environmental conditions as well as delay the appearance of corrosion from the basis metal.\n\n    1.4 Cadmium plating is used to minimize bi-metallic corrosion between high-strength steel fasteners and aluminum in the aerospace industry. Undercutting of threads on fastener parts is not necessary as the cadmium coating has a low coefficient of friction that reduces the tightening torque required and allows repetitive dismantling.\n\n    1.5 Cadmium-coated parts can easily be soldered without the use of corrosive fluxes. Cadmium-coated steel parts have a lower electrical contact resistance than zinc-coated steel. The lubricity of cadmium plating is used on springs for doors and latches and for weaving machinery operating in high humidity. Corrosion products formed on cadmium are tightly adherent. Unlike zinc, cadmium does not build up voluminous corrosion products on the surface. This allows for proper functioning during corrosive exposure of moving parts, threaded assemblies, valves, and delicate mechanisms without jamming with debris.\n\n    2.

It specifies a method for determining the pigment content of paints in which the product under test is ashed. The method is not applicable to coating materials containing aluminium, organic pigments and\/or dyestuffs, or inorganic pigments treated with organic compounds. Such constituents, which could make up about 10 % of the pigment, will be lost during ashing. As the state of many pigments and extenders changes under the specified test conditions, it will depend on the composition and the chosen ashing temperature whether the actual pigment content of the product under test can be deduced from the apparent pigment content found by this method. The method is generally not suitable for UV paints and varnishes or those containing reactive diluents requiring special heating conditions. The pigment content of coating materials can also be determined by a centrifuge method (see ISO 14680-1) or by a filtration method (see ISO 14680-3).\n\n\nICS-code 87.060.10\nDutch title Verven en vernissen - Bepaling van het pigmentgehalte - Deel 2: Asmethode\nEnglish title Paints and varnishes - Determination of pigment content - Part 2: Ashing method\n\nShopping Basket\n\n\nGo to shopping basket",

        "text":"Major Advances Weld Purging\n\n\nMajor Advances in Weld Purge Technology\n\nThe last few months have seen the launch of several innovative improvements to the range of internationally approved weld purge systems manufactured by Huntingdon Fusion Techniques HFT\u00ae.\n\nExploiting current engineering developments in materials, electronics and specialist products such as gas valves, HFT\u00ae's designers, encouraged by customer feedback, have been able to make significant improvements to its range of purge equipment and instrumentation.\n\nThree principle products form the thrust of HFT's Argweld\u00ae Family Range of Pipe Purging Products; QuickPurge\u00ae, PurgElite\u00ae and PurgEye\u00ae.\n\nquickpurge welding equipments\n\nFig 1. \u00a0Effective gas seals need to be provided on either side of the joint and these need to be far enough away to be\nunaffected by the temperature rise during welding. This schematic section illustrates how QuickPurge equipment works.\n\n\n\nFig 2.\u00a0 Engineers prepare to fabricate large diameter pipework on the Isle of Grain Natural Gas installation using QuickPurge\u00aeII.\n\n\nThe Argweld\u00ae Product Range\u00a0was developed to help speed up the welding process for engineers involved in the fabrication of pipes and tubes. This was realised by using a design, which allows for easy and positive insertion into position and by limiting the purge volume. The product range has been used extensively and internationally during the welding of stainless steel gas and oil transmission pipework.\n\nThe\u00a0QuickPurg\u00aeII\u00a0body employs synthetic fabrics throughout and incorporates an integral protective lining below the weld zone to resist thermal damage. Hoses used to transmit inert gas to and from the purge cavity and to provide inflation pressure are made from engineering grade nylon. Brass gas fittings are located well outside the weld zone so that post weld radiography and ultrasonic inspection can take place with the purge system left in place.\n\nIt is impractical to be specific across the entire spectrum of diameters and welding procedures other than to say that savings are significant. As an example, users report that a 900 mm diameter pipe can be fully purged to less than 0.1% oxygen in under 10 minutes. There are reported savings in excess of 80% on purge time compared with alterative purging systems so that gas usage can be reduced dramatically as a result.\n\nPurgElite\u00ae systems\u00a0have been developed to help speed up the welding process for engineers involved in the fabrication of pipes and tube lines and assemblies up to 300 mm diameter.\n\nThe revolutionary product range replaces an earlier one that has been manufactured and marketed successfully by HFT world-wide for many years and is widely recognised as a robust, easy to use, welding ancillary that offers considerable savings in time and inert gas.\n\npurgelite purging system weld\n\nFig 3. \u00a0PurgElite\u00ae inflatable purge system designed to accommodate tube and pipe sizes between 25 and 300 mm diameter.\nThe 25 mm version is the worlds' smallest fully integrated purge system.\n\nweld purge monitor equipment product\n\n\nFig 4. \u00a0PurgEye\u00ae monitors have been specifically designed for indicating oxygen levels in inert gas during weld purging. These rugged instruments have a measuring range down to 1 part per million on an alpha-numeric display.\u00a0\n\nThe 'Elite' development incorporates many advances in engineering technology and extends the size range to include purge systems as small as 25 mm (1 inch) diameter.\n\nThe inflatable components employ low vapour pressure synthetic fabrics with low outgassing rates throughout and incorporate a connecting hose with a protection sleeve to resist thermal damage. Hoses used to transmit inert gas to and from the purge cavity and to provide inflation pressure are made from engineering grade nylon.\n\nPurgEye\u00ae Weld Purge Monitors\u00ae were developed by HFT\u00ae specifically for the weld purge industry to provide sensitive oxygen measuring instrumentation. Most fabricators, but stainless steel fabricators in particular, need to ensure that the weld root is protected against oxidation. If the root becomes oxidised, the affected metal may need to be cleaned and this can be an expensive operation. Protection is best effected by providing inert gas purging. Of course the purge gas itself needs to be free of oxygen and a measure of the oxygen content of the purged volume is thus a crucial need for the welder.\n\nFor routine welding of the majority of stainless steels there is a requirement for the purge gas to contain less than 0.1% oxygen or 1000 parts per million (ppm). For these applications the HFT\u00ae PurgeEye\u00ae monitors are more than adequate. More sensitive materials such as titanium alloys and some special stainless steels may require oxygen levels to be below 0.01% or 100 ppm.\n\nCase Histories\n\nA major US Nuclear Site employs QuickPurge\u00ae and Argweld\u00ae Weld Purge Monitors\u00ae to fabricate stainless steel duct work ranging in size from 150 to 600 mm.Before using QuickPurge\u00ae the practice was to purge a complete pipe system.\n\nOther types of stand-alone dams were unsuitable because of the risk of dams being accidentally left in place leading to costly obstruction issues. Water soluble dams were not allowed because post-weld flushing with water was unacceptable.\n\nA number of observations have been made;\n\n\u2022 Argon usage has been reduced by up to 90%.\n\n\u2022 Productivity has increased dramatically and overheads reduced due to the elimination of wasted down-time with welders spending hours waiting for purges.\n\n\u2022 A significant benefit has been the elimination of a major jobsite safety issue. Before using QuickPurge\u00ae, they would end up with hundreds of feet of ducting that were filled with argon. When the argon was to be expelled from the lines it produced a serious safety issue requiring the evacuation of areas due to dangerously lowered oxygen levels caused by the exhausted argon.\n\nPennecon Energy in Newfoundland selected Argweld\u00ae purge systems for a large piping project.\n\nPennecon was awarded a contract that required hundreds of welds on titanium and stainless steel piping with sizes up to 1500 mm diameter and they were in the process of gearing up a brand new welding facility with multiple welding stations to handle the job.\n\nThe company evaluated several alternatives for effective and efficient methods of weld purging in order to achieve a purge below 50 parts per million of oxygen. Following testing and evaluation and after studying the return on investment that the Argweld\u00ae products offered with reduced operating costs, a decision was made to move forward with the procurement of QuickPurge\u00aeII systems and PurgEye\u00ae Weld Purge Monitors\u00ae.\n\nThey are now using the equipment extensively on 250, 450 and 500 mm pipe joints and plan to continue to use other Argweld\u00ae equipment as they move into other pipe sizes.\n\nLatest Innovations\n\nPurgeGate\u00ae\u00a0has been added to all QuickPurge\u00ae systems. This patented device prevents inflatable systems from being over-pressurised even when operators try to increase pressure to increase the flow of weld purge gas.\n\nRootGlo\u00ae\u00a0illuminating tape is now sewn on the centreline of the QuickPurge\u00ae system. Inside the dark pipe, the centering band glows brightly to give welders the opportunity to see all aspects of the purge device alignment and the quality of the weld root as it is being welded.\n\nIntaCal\u00ae\u00a0is a calibrated gas release system to purge the interspace between the dams. IntaCal\u00ae removes the need for expensive and complicated valve systems that need presetting before each weld. This time-consuming process is now eliminated, as is the previous problem of incorrectly setting valves which frequently led to bursting dams.\n\nWeld Purge Monitors\u00ae The exhaust gases are fed directly to the weld purge monitor and can be set to alert the user automatically when the required oxygen level has been reached.\n\nTo read the published article in World Pipelines by Energy Global, click on this image:\n\n\nYou are not allowed to use or copy any of this material or content without the written permission of Huntingdon Fusion Techniques HFT\u00ae, copyright protected.

        "text":"United States Patent 3638858\n\nA temporary heating system for buildings under construction requiring hot air for drying plaster, paint, mortar and the like. A portable high-capacity burner is placed in a doorway leading to the outside of the building on the lowest floor to be heated. The burner is baffled to have the burner intake outside the building and the hot products of combustion and air blown inside into an elevator shaft which then conducts the hot air to the upper levels. The elevator doors and the windows of the building are used as flow regulators for their respective floors.\n\nApplication Number:\nPublication Date:\nFiling Date:\nPrimary Class:\nOther Classes:\nInternational Classes:\nF24H3\/04; (IPC1-7): F24D5\/02\nField of Search:\n263\/19 237\nView Patent Images:\nUS Patent References:\n3050111Crop dryer1962-08-21Hubbard et al.\n2579158Heating system1951-12-18Scheu\n1706199Method of drying moist rooms, buildings, and the like1929-03-19Wagner\n\nPrimary Examiner:\nFavors, Edward G.\nI claim\n\n1. In combination a multilevel building and a temporary heating system therefor, said system comprising a tubular burner for generating a continuous stream of hot gases, said burner being disposed in a substantially horizontal position on a lower level within the building and having inlet and outlet openings, said building having an opening to the outside thereof at said lower level, a baffle for the opening in the building and extending around the burner to expose the air inlet of the burner to the outside of the building and to shield the hot gases from the outside at said building opening, a vertical shaft in the building for access to upper levels therein, said shaft having door openings at a plurality of building levels, the outlet opening for the burner directing the stream of hot gases from the burner toward said shaft to direct hot gases thereinto, said door openings in the shaft being selectively manipulatable for regulating the amount of hot gases entering each of the building levels.\n\n2. A temporary heating system as described in claim 1, a duct interposed between the outlet of the burner and the shaft for conducting a major portion of the hot gases from the burner to the shaft, said duct being spaced from the burner to permit the remainder of the hot gases to pass around the duct into said lower level.\n\nThis invention relates to temporary heating systems for buildings under construction, or whose heating plant is not functioning.\n\nIn multilevel buildings under construction or undergoing extensive remodeling, certain construction materials such as plaster, dry wall, mortar, cement, paint, wallpaper, etc., must be dried as evenly and as rapidly as possible to prepare the building for early occupancy. This means that uniformly hot dry air in adequate quantities must be circulated throughout the building during the drying period and for such time as the external air temperature may be at a damaging level. At these times the heating plant for the building, particularly in new construction, may not be operational so that it becomes necessary to provide a temporary source of hot air for the building until its own heating plant can be put in operation.\n\nHeretofore, temporary heating units for buildings under construction have taken the form of small individual burners, usually oil fired, and of a capacity sufficient to supply, at best, one floor of the building with hot dry air. No provision was made in the burners for automatically limiting the maximum temperature of the hot air emanating therefrom so that they could not be left unattended for fear that they would overheat.\n\nThe principal object of this invention is to provide a temporary heating system for large buildings under construction the capacity of which is large enough to supply the entire building, including all floors thereof, with adequate quantities of hot, dry air to promote drying of construction materials used therein.\n\nAs a more specific object, this invention has within its purview the provision of a temporary heating system for a multilevel building having a vertical shaft such as an elevator shaft or a stair well, the shaft having doors opening on each level, wherein use is made of the shaft and doors in connection with a compact, high-capacity portable heating unit to distribute hot air from the heating unit to all levels of the building.\n\nThese and other objects of this invention, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken together with the accompanying drawings, in which:\n\nFIG. 1 is a fragmentary plan view of a single level in a multilevel building showing the temporary heating system of this invention as used therein;\n\nFIG. 2 is an enlarged elevational view of the building and heating system of FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 3 is a still further enlarged side elevational view in section of the heating unit taken along line 3--3 of FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 4 is an elevational view in perspective of the heating unit of FIG. 3; and\n\nFIG. 5 is an enlarged end elevational view of the heating unit of FIG. 1 as installed.\n\nIn its preferred form, this invention is comprised of a high-capacity burner and blower in the form of a cylinder, mounted on a wheeled frame to provide portability for the unit. Any suitable fuel supply may be used, but it may take the form of gas piped to the unit from a city natural gas main, or from a tank of propane gas. The size of the unit may be selected to adapt it for a relatively wide range of building sizes to be heated, and the output of the unit may thus be adjusted to furnish from 500,000 B.t.u.'s per hour to 2,000,000 B.t.u.'s per hour. A blower on the unit mixes the outside air with the products of combustion. The unit is installed in a doorway or window on the lowermost level of the building to be heated, with the intake end extending out of the doorway. The output end is directed toward an open elevator shaft and the elevator doors on upper levels opening on the shaft serve as valves to admit desired amounts of heated air to the level associated with the door.\n\nReferring now to the drawings for a detailed description of the invention, and particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2, the invention is shown applied to a multilevel building 10 having a ground floor 11 and upper floors 12, 13 and 14. For purposes of illustration the building is shown as having a roof 15, but said roof may in fact be the next higher floor which, although formed, may not be ready for heating, i.e., the materials requiring heating for their drying and setting have not yet been applied to that floor. Each of the floors 11 to 14 are shown completed to the extent that windows 16, 17 and 18 have been installed so that such heated air as may be supplied to floors 11-14 can be retained in these levels, or allowed to leave at a controlled rate through windows 16, 17 and 18 as it becomes saturated with moisture, to be replaced by hot dry air.\n\nBuilding 10 will have an elevator shaft 19 extending vertically from the ground level 11 through each of the levels above, said shaft in the illustrative example having continuous rear and side walls 20, 21 and 22, and a front wall in which may be provided elevator doors 23, 24, 25 and 26, should the construction of the building be advanced to the point where such doors have been installed. Said doors 23-16, if installed, may be used to control the entrance of air from elevator shaft 19 to the levels associated with said doors.\n\nHot dry air is supplied to building 10 by a high-capactiy portable heater 27 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. In the example illustrated, the heater is in the form of a cylindrical sheet metal tube 28 having an inlet end 29 and an outlet end 30. Tube 28 is mounted on a frame 31 which is, in turn, mounted on a pair of spaced wheels 32 on which heater 27 may be wheeled from place to place. A tongue 33 is provided by which heater 27 may be pushed or pulled, either manually, or by appropriate automotive power.\n\nWithin tube 28 is disposed a burner 34 which is preferably of the gas type because of the cleanliness of its products of combustion. Said burner may be supplied with gas from a source 35 which may be a portable container of propane gas or a city main containing natural gas supplied by a public utility. Air for combustion and for mixing with the products of combustion is provided by a motor-driven fan 36, the inlet to which is protected by a screen 37.\n\nHeater 27 is placed in a doorway or low window 38 (FIG. 5) on the lowest floor to be heated. In the building illustrated herein, this is the ground floor 11, but in a building of many floors the heater may be moved up to higher levels as the lower levels are completed. The doorway is closed by a temporary covering or baffle 29 of plywood, steel, or heavy cloth, and an opening is made in covering 39 through which inlet end 29 and tongue 13 extend to the exterior of the building.\n\nIt may be noted that tube 28 is relatively short and although the gases issuing therefrom are directional so that they will travel in the direction in which the outlet end 30 is pointed, tube 28 may of necessity be located some distance from door 23 so that the hot gases may be dissipated throughout ground floor 11 and the pressure thereof diminished at door 23 to the point where not enough gases enter elevator shaft 19 to heat the upper levels adequately, while the ground floor receives too much of these gases. To alleviate this condition a temporary cylindrical duct 40 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is used. This duct may be made of sheet metal or alternatively, of canvas or sheet plastic and made sufficiently rigid by any appropriate supporting means (not shown) to retain its intended cross-sectional shape. Although a cylindrical shape conforms most closely to the cross section of tube 28, other shapes, such as square or rectangular will also be effective. Duct 40 is supported on spaced frames 41 so that it is coaxially disposed with reference to tube 28, and it is of a length to extend approxim... (truncated)",
