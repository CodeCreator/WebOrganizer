        "text":"Soul Ship\n\nSoul Ship\n\nPain erupted as the ibulex burned through my veins. Accelerating when it reached my heart, the drug fired into my arteries like a sling shot; an inferno deep inside my chest. When the agony subsided I saw from the deep impressions left by the restraints that my body had fought on even when my mind was helpless.\n\nNow I sagged, drained. The fire still burned, banked coals throughout my body which could be blown to life at the slightest touch. Even in the warm release-chamber sweat cooled on my skin, leaving a trail of goosebumps behind. Breathing gradually became easier, each breath reassuring me that the worst was over, at least for now.\n\nVoices in the background, a drone which slowly resolved itself into the magistrate reading out the conditions of my release. My exhausted mind wondered if it had been worth it.\n\nI was given civilian clothing, the sort a tramp from the \u2018forties might have owned. It had been worn before and came with its own ecosystem of lice and fleas, its own atmosphere of stale body odour. I told myself it was better than being naked and my flight suit had been damaged beyond repair during my capture.\n\nThe walk from the detention block to the main gate was an exercise in endurance; cat calls from every shielded window as the entire prison population poured their hatred out at me. I was being released while they still served life sentences, but it wasn\u2019t jealousy that drove them: I had been the most hated prisoner in the facility, in solitary confinement for the last seven years just to keep me alive. Even then there had been attempts on my life. I smiled.\n\nThe guards in formation around me were mechanicals because the governor knew human guards might decide to take matters into their own hands and kill me \u2013 mechanicals just carried out their programmed duties. I just hoped no one had reprogrammed them: they\u2019d make efficient assassins.\n\nWe reached the guardhouse without mishap but the grating of the security door set my raw nerves on edge. Yawning darkness lay beyond. One of the mechanicals pushed me and I was part way into a defensive crouch before I realised it was just encouraging me forwards. I stepped inside and the door slammed behind me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be dead before the sun sets, woman,\u201d a voice from the darkness taunted.\n\n\u201cAnd if you survive until night, you\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t\u2026\u201d a second voice added. I didn\u2019t flinch. Both voices had the slight tinniness of speakers and the dead air space told me I was alone.\n\n\u201cIf you break the conditions of your release,\u201d added a third voice, cool and dispassionate, \u201cthe ibulex will activate in your bloodstream, terminating your existence. The pain you experienced during administration will be a flea bite compared to the pain of your death.\u201d I nodded, knowing I was being watched even though I could see no one.\n\n\u201cOn the bench to your left you will find your belongings,\u201d the voice continued dispassionately, \u201cexcept for the weapons.\u201d I reached out with my left hand, finding the bench and feeling around until my hand met the small pile of stuff they\u2019d found on me. I concentrated on keeping my breathing even as I identified each object by touch. I couldn\u2019t risk them knowing how important one particular item was to me.\n\nMy wristwatch, an antique from the twenty-first, a locket, my belt, purse with photos still inside and smokes, useless now after all these years. I quietly pocketed everything then waited.\n\n\u201cThe door release is at waist height in front of you.\u201d The cold metal was closer to my face than I had realised. I ran my hand down it carefully, wary of traps even now, until I found the contour of a button. As I pressed it a sliver of light began at floor level, lighting up my feet, widening to a bar which showed my legs, thin and dirty under the grey skirt. The harsh glare of sunlight made my eyes sting with unshed tears, but I was already diving into a forward roll before the door was halfway up and then I was away, dodging from side to side, a target in a shooting game. I felt more than heard the bullets ripping through the air all around me. The street was empty apart from me \u2013 word had got out and decent citizens were in their own homes behind locked doors, waiting for someone else to finish me off.\n\nI didn\u2019t get away unscathed, because I\u2019m not a super-hero, but the adrenaline in my system had me so wired that I was barely aware of the wounds as bullets tore into my flesh. Seven years in solitary isn\u2019t the best training for a run like the onethat day but desperation is a great incentive. When I found myself in populated streets I stopped running immediately and adopted the slouch of a vagrant trying to avoid a kick.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t keep me safe for long, because they could track me by the ibulex in my blood, but I didn\u2019t need much time. Behind me commotion erupted as shooters broke cover. Their next step would be to fire in the airso everyone dropped to the ground, then I\u2019d have two choices: run and be shot in the back, or drop with everyone else and wait for them to put a bullet in my head.\n\nI did neither. Instead I swiped my thumb over the genetically coded transporter set in the lid of the packet of smokes.\n\n\nI was surrounded by the blessed cool of my own ship, but instantly the ibulex blazed fire through my bloodstream.\n\n\u201cInitiate emergency transfusion!\u201d I screamed, body writhing even before I hit the white deck. The ship was built from my cloned cells: she was a part of me, the other half of my soul, speaking with my voice. She would be feeling my pain.\n\n\u201cEmergency transfusion denied,\u201d a dispassionate male voice replied, a voice I had heard not half an hour before. As the blackness of oblivion pulled me down the full horror began to dawn on me: they had never planned to let me escape alive. They had murdered my beautiful ship and now it was my turn.\n\n\u00a9 Kerry Buchanan\n\nBookmark the permalink.\n\nComments are closed",

I get it.\" Rory shook his head. \"It's sad, man. You used to be so much fun before you got mixed up with Paige. Do you know I never once saw her smile? I don't think she knows how. And then you went and fell for her and now you're just like her.\"\n\n\"You know what else is sad?\" JJ retorted, crossing his arms. \"Me thinking you'd do anything for me like in the old days.\"\n\n\"You mean like the way you took that Jill chick out from under my nose.\"\n\nJJ jumped up. \"You're gonna have to get over that, cause I'm not explaining it to you anymore.\" He moved closer to Rory, not enough to really be threatening, but Rory jumped back anyway. \"You wanna know what happened that night, dude? You really wanna know?\" JJ advanced on Rory, not caring they could both be kicked out of the library. \"I had your back, that's what. Dude, you were so totally wasted that anything could have gone down and you wouldn't have known the difference, so I got you out of there.\"\n\nRory shifted his weight. \"I have your back too.\"\n\n\"Do you?\"\n\n\"If you really had mine, you'd help me steal this test.\" JJ glared at Rory and Rory said, \"Come on, man. You're gonna pass with flying colors no matter what, so why can't you just help me have a chance?\"\n\n\"Dude, you have a chance. Ever heard of opening a book?\"\n\n\"Easy for you to say.\" Rory laughed bitterly. \"You grew up going to fancy schools and your mommy hanging your report cards on the fridge, and now that you're not smoking weed you're back to being her golden boy who does everything right. Plus even if you do something she's not cool with, all you gotta do is pick up the phone and there's Dr. Dan making time for you.\"\n\n\"So, what, you're jealous now?\"\n\n\"No, man. I just wish you knew how lucky you are. You got a cool family and all sorts of smarts. Dude, my mom beat me every time I got a bad grade til she got sick of me. If it weren't for my brother I'd still be living in the park. I'm not as smart as you. I can't pass without a little extra help.\"\n\n\"And if we get caught - \"\n\n\"We won't.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we will. It always catches up with you sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Are you gonna help me or not?\"\n\nJJ was quiet for a minute, trying to get his words together. Finally he said, \"Any time you wanna study, I'm there, dude.\"\n\n\"Forget it, man.\" Rory swung his backpack over his shoulder. \"I got plenty of real friends who'll help. If you're not one of them, don't bother calling me anymore.\" He stomped off towards the elevator.\n\nJJ threw himself into his chair and slumped down. Sorry, Rory, he thought. I'm not giving up on you that easily.\n\nHope sat at her desk, flipping through files while she talked to Jennifer on the phone. \"Of course. When I get done at the station, we'll do coffee and get caught up. And Jennifer, just breathe, okay? JJ's come a long way. He'll get through this too. See you soon, cuz. Bye.\"\n\nRafe knocked on Hope's open office door as she hung up the phone, then stuck his head in. \"You got a minute to ride out with me to Salem U?\"\n\n\"Of course. What's up?\"\n\n\"Campus Security just called something in that I think you should be in on.\"\n\n\"Let's go then.\" Hope threw her jacket on and followed Rafe out of the station.\n\nWhen Jennifer got Hope's text that it might be a while, she decided to go to Brady's Pub by herself. She wanted to get out of the house. The picture of her late husband, Jack, on the mantel just seemed to be staring at her, telling her that she had to do something for their son. If he was here she would yell at him that she didn't know what to do, but since he wasn't, it was better just to get out.\n\nShe got herself a cinnamon latte, her favorite, which she hadn't had in a long time, and sipped it slowly, trying not to think of anything. Wasn't that what Julie had told her? Meditate and don't think of anything. If only she knew how that worked.\n\n\"I thought that was you, Jennifer.\" Maggie Horton looked as smart as ever in her pale pink suit, pearl earrings and necklace to match.\n\n\"Hi Aunt Maggie.\" Jennifer tried to smile. \"Where are you off to all dressed up?\"\n\n\"Oh, nowhere special. Just off to lead a meeting, that's all. But I'm glad I caught you.\" Maggie sat down across from Jen and patted her hand. \"Tell me, how is that wonderful son of yours doing ever since he broke ties with Eve Donovan's daughter?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew.\" Jennifer pushed her coffee away, shaking her head. \"He's hurting, Aunt Maggie, I know he's hurting, and I don't know how to reach him.\"\n\n\"Well, what does he say when you talk to him?\"\n\n\"Nothing. He'll tell me, 'Oh Mom, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.' But he leaves the house early in the morning and doesn't come back until almost 11 o'clock at night. He says he's studying all the time, and I hope that's true, but that's not JJ.\" Jen took another sip of her coffee and said, slowly, \"You're probably going to think I'm being paranoid, but you know the signs better than I do\u2026 do you think this means he's doing something he shouldn't be?\"\n\n\"You mean drugs?\"\n\nJen blinked back the tears as she nodded.\n\n\"Oh, Jennifer Rose\u2026\" Maggie took Jen's hand in hers. \"If he changed once, he can do it again. How about I talk to him and if he has relapsed, I'll help him get right back to what he's supposed to be doing.\"\n\n\"Are you sure? I know you have a lot going on with Brady and - \"\n\n\"Stop it. We are family. No matter what happens, I'm always here for my favorite niece. Now, you said he leaves early in the morning? How early?\"\n\n\"Most days, I don't even know he's gone.\"\n\n\"Then I'll just have to stay over so that I can catch him before he leaves. I'll just tell Victor that he'll have to live without me for one night.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Aunt Maggie, I couldn't ask you to - \"\n\n\"Not another word.\" Maggie took out her phone and began texting. \"One thing we have in common is that once our minds are made up, nothing can change them. And mine is made up that I am helping you.\"\n\nThere was an older man standing outside the dorm room as Rafe and Hope came around the corner. He was wearing a jacket with a Salem U insignia, and the lanyard tucked halfway into his shirt was probably his name badge.\n\n\"Jake Peterson?\" Rafe asked him.\n\nPeterson held out his hand. \"Call me Pete. Everyone does.\"\n\nRafe displayed his badge as they shook hands. \"This is, uh, the scene?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. \"\n\nThe two cops slipped on gloves before opening the door all the way so that they wouldn't damage any evidence. Rafe couldn't help whistling under his breath as they walked in.\n\nThe room had totally been torn apart. The pieces of a broken lamp were still on the floor, forcing the detectives to watch their step, papers and books were strewn everywhere, the desk had been overturned\u2026 The only thing that was intact was the bed. A girl sat on it, hugging herself and staring at the floor. She was clearly old enough to be a student here, but the way she was hunched over made her look no older than Hope's daughter Ciara, who was in the fourth grade.\n\n\"Marissa?\" Hope said gently. The girl nodded. \"Um, what happened here?\" Hope asked.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\nHope and Rafe exchanged glances. Hope said, \"How about Detective Hernandez interviews Mr. Peterson about what he saw when he found you while you and I talk?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" Marissa mumbled. Hope mouthed her thanks to Rafe as he left the room.\n\n\"Can I sit down with you?\" Hope asked Marissa. Marissa nodded and Hope sat down carefully on the bed. \"You must have been so scared. Look at the way this guy tore this room apart. Were you in here then?\"\n\n\"I was here.\" Marissa hugged herself tighter. Hope waited a minute before saying, \"Tell me what happened.\"\n\n\"I don't remember all of it.\" Marissa blinked hard. \"He\u2026 he had a knife and he\u2026 he made me\u2026\" She put her head in her hands, then looked up again. \"He wanted money and jewelry and whatever else was valuable, so he\u2026 he tied me to the bed and...and he\u2026\" she began to cry.\n\n\"He hurt you,\" Hope said.\n\nMarissa nodded. She rolled up her skirt and showed Hope a mark around her ankle. \"He taped my legs,\" she said, dropping it. She rolled up her sleeve next and showed Hope another mark. It looked like a rope had been pressed into her skin. \"He tied my wrists.\" She pulled at her ripped dress. \"He ripped the sash off my dress and shoved it in my mouth to shut me up.\"\n\nHope sighed.

        "text":"Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zme\u0161kal\n\nTomas Zmeskal\n\n\n\u2014 Translated from the Czech by Nathan Fields\n\nRight at this moment Doctor Lukavsky didn\u2019t have time for a patient; he filled out the form and took him to the ward, and that was all for the moment. The patient the police had brought in, the confectioner Marek Svoboda, who called everyone, not only the doctor, but also the others, the patients as well as the caregivers, \u201cbrother\u201d or \u201csister\u201d, seemed calm and behaved in a balanced way. It was not yet necessary to make a certain diagnosis; the doctor had time for that. The person introducing himself as Jesus Socrates Amenhotep Hitler, and given the name Marek Svoboda by his parents, was at the right address here, the doctor judged. In the afternoon he had Mr. Svoboda called and he asked him if he would explain his name. The confectioner Svoboda looked attentively at the doctor and said:\n\n\u201cI am not sure, brother doctor, if you would understand my explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d the doctor interrupted, \u201cI would like to ask that you address me completely normally and plainly as Doctor Lukavsky.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut brother doctor, does it not please you that we, here, under the sun, are all equal?\u201d the confectioner asked.\n\n\u201cPlease, Mr. Svoboda, I ask you,\u201d the doctor said. Mr. Svoboda was silent and the doctor tried once again. \u201cCould you please tell me why you changed your name, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, brother doctor, I could,\u201d the confectioner said, \u201cbut first I ask you to please open the window and give a brother a bit of air; it would be brotherly love from you.\u201d The doctor made a note, unconnected to Svoboda, in his open file, set his pen on the table, stood, and cracked the window. The sound of wind in the spread branches of the deciduous trees which surrounded the main paths of the hospital areal began to enter the room. The confectioner stood, walked over to the partially-opened window and looked outside through the bars.\n\n\u201cHow far is it from here to the capital, brother doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean to Prague?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cYes, brother, that\u2019s exactly what I mean,\u201d said the confectioner.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout two and a half hours by car,\u201d answered Doctor Lukavsky.\n\n\u201cYou see, brother, two and a half hours by car, that is a great distance, and we people are even more distant from each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean that, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d The doctor asked.\n\n\u201cDear brother, I knew that you were not going to understand me,\u201d said the confectioner.\n\n\u201cBy that do you mean the distance within human relationships?\u201d\n\n\u201cI stuck it in and now I\u2019m hauling it back out,\u201d the confectioner answered.\n\n\u201cMr. Svoboda, what is going on with your wife?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cDear brother doctor, my sister wife left me, leaving only a goodbye letter behind.\u201d\n\nWhy did she leave you, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe found a noble lover, brother doctor,\u201d answered the confectioner.\n\n\u201cDo you have the letter, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cDear brother doctor, I ate it,\u201d the confectioner answered.\n\n\u201cOh, like that,\u201d said the doctor.\n\n\u201cOh, like that,\u201d the confectioner repeated after him, \u201cshe\u2019s already got herself free of the line and is sailing away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the doctor asked, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I understand you?\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cBut brother doctor, brother doctor, I must chasten you, for I hear a fraction of impatience in your voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right, Mr. Svoboda, I am impatient, I have a long shift ahead of me and I would like to find out something from you.\u201d The confectioner remained standing at the barred window and ran the palms of his hands over his face, as if he were washing it of dust, and he returned to the table, where he sat himself once again in the chair across from the doctor.\n\n\u201cWhy are you called Jesus Socrates, Amenhotep Hitler, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had visions, brother\u2026, I had visions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, brother, visions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf which kind?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf the pleading kind, brother, pleading\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure that I understand, Mr. Svoboda. Please, could you help me a little?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am doing what I can, brother doctor, as much as my strength, as much as my strength\u2026allows.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did this vision concern, brother\u2026, that is, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel free to call me brother, dear brother doctor\u2026,\u201d the confectioner said with pleasure. \u201cAfter all, you know that under the sun, the moon and all the various comets all of us are equal\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we are all equal,\u201d the doctor said and smiled, \u201cit\u2019s even in the constitution.\u201d He added after a moment.\n\n\u201cAnd how inappropriate, brother doctor, how inappropriate,\u201d the confectioner said.\n\n\u201cWhat is inappropriate, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d the doctor asked.\n\n\u201cInappropriate is inappropriate, that is inappropriate. Being ironic, sarcastic, and quoting a scrap of paper instead of looking into the human soul, brother.\u201d\n\u201cOh, like that,\u201d the doctor said, \u201clike that,\u201d he repeated, \u201cI am sorry if I offended you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Doctor, there is a long road awaiting you, a long road\u2026we can only offend ourselves after all, not a second person, a third, nor a fifth, nor seventh, not eleventh, nor a thirteenth, or a seventeenth\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Svoboda, how were these visions of yours? The doctor asked, now rather more emphatic. The confectioner clasped his hands in front of his face, as if he were about to pray, and said:\n\n\u201cEvery name that I have was revealed to me in one vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if you told me something about your last name, about the name Hitler, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Doctor, that was a harsh vision, harsh and long\u2026 and mainly, mainly harsh\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have time, Mr. Svoboda, we have time, today I have even the nightshift\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the nightshift, brother, and meanwhile you are neither under the stars nor even under the sky, how sad, brother, how sad. How decrepit and sad your life is\u2026, do you realize it at all, brother?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d the doctor said and coughed, \u201csure, but so what about telling me something of this vision of yours, Mr. Svoboda? Do you think that you could?\u201d The confectioner was clearly thinking; he straightened out his fingers several times and said:\n\n\u201cEven wild animals are kinder to each other than people, remember that, and I unfortunately am no different, and so I at least try to be kind to myself.\u201d He was silent for a moment and then he added: \u201cI will tell you my vision, but only on one condition, brother doctor, only on one condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t promise you anything,\u201d the doctor said carefully and unsurely. \u201cWhat kind of condition is it, Mr. Svoboda?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe condition is absolutely, well, well\u2026, actually absolute,\u201d the confectioner said. \u201cEither you fulfill it, or you find out nothing, brother doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know, Mr. Svoboda, I think that you are not able to set conditions; after all, I am not giving you any conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre bars conditions, dear brother?\u201d the confectioner asked.\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Svoboda\u2026you must know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a condition\u2026absolute and not up for discussion,\u201d the confectioner interrupted him. \u201cIf you want to hear the vision, that is, the picture of my truth, the universe be damned, which is the same as praise, you cannot interrupt me, otherwise you will simply not find out. Which will neither benefit, nor harm the universe. But do not try to bargain with me! I hope I deserve that much meager respect, even from your white coat, which needs washing. I wouldn\u2019t even dare to roll dough in such, ew, ew, ew!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have no intention of interrupting you, Mr. Svoboda,\u201d the doctor said a little surprised and realized that he was making an effort not to look at his coat. \u201cYou should have told me that right away,\u201d he added, touched.\n\n\u201cThis is only for listening, doctor, this is only for listening, brother,\u201d the confectioner said severely.\n\n\u201cGo ahead, Mr. Svoboda; begin, surely I will not interrupt you, why would I interrupt you when it interests me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise?\u201d asked the confectioner.\n\n\u201cBut of course,\u201d the doctor answered.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t interrupt me even once?\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cWell then, listen, brother doctor,\u201d the confectioner said, folding his hands in front of his face, like he wanted to pray.\n\n\u201cI was sleeping. I was sleeping completely calmly and comfortably, my wife had just had her birthday. We celebrated it as she wanted, only with a few friends. Afterwards, in the evening, we made love and fell asleep in each other\u2019s embrace. When I woke up, my head hurt, I thought that I would be sick. I rose from the bed, but just then another onslaught of the pain struck me again. It was most probably what they call a migraine. I completely collapsed as the pain passed through my head, and I slammed the shin of my right leg against the nightstand which stood next to the bed. I heard my wife\u2019s sleepy voice say: \u201cSweetie, again?\u201d I couldn\u2019t even see for the pain in my head. Before my eyes I had constellations and galaxies full of painful and cutting reflections. Someone was gently grasping my hand and speaking to me. It was the same voice which had addressed me before, but now the voice was whispering. Then two arms embraced me around the waist and gently set me back on the bed which I had just left. Someone put a glass in my hand. I understood that I was supposed to drink, and so I drank it. It tasted like mango juice. I drank it up and felt a bit strange that it tasted like mango, which I like, but which I had never yet tasted before. The hands which had set me on the bed lifted my leg, the one I had bumped, laid it on the bed and began washing the wound. After a moment I felt those hands tightening a bandage around my shin. \u201cStretch out, my love,\u201d the voice said to me again, \u201cit will pass in a moment.\u201d\n\nI got up, however, and said that I couldn\u2019t, that I had to go to the toilet, that I had to urinate. Those two arms raised me up a bit once again, and I already understood that I was supposed to stand, and blindly, because I still could not open my eyes, I followed them. I entered the room; I felt my way around it and sat myself on the toilet bowl from memory. I urinated and remained sitting on the toilet. I realized that the pain had begun to recede. I sat and eventually a... (truncated)",

And if\nthey're black, they have flawless skin and brown weave, also wearing white bikinis.\n  She's different. Her face is smooth and brown, high-cheekbones, a serious, bad,\ndon't-mess-with-me look, wide, brown, doe eyes. Her body is shaped like\ntheirs--skinny and curved. But they lack what she has--tattoos up and down her back.\nHe can see one trailing down into the bottom of her bikini. On her ass? He'd like to\nsee that one. Her bikini isn't a plain color--it's black with bright yellow and hot\npink and orange peace signs. She wears it with a sort of grim pride. She looks\n  Only the music is audible. The clinking glasses, girls shrieking, guys laughing and\nwhistling and hollering, all of has stopped. An eery silence starts as she walks\nthrough the gate. And she knows it's because of her, Damon can tell. She walks with a\nsort of exaggerated hip-swaying walk. But it looks natural. Her hair swings over her\nshoulder, seemingly falling into the act. \n  She takes a seat at the back in a lawn chair, surveying. Her brown eyes have a sort\nof edge to them--like she's angry, determined, or trying to look tough. Whatever it\nis, it's working.\n  The whispers and talks start. Everybody, whispering about her. This girl. Who is\nshe? Who does she belong to? Who invited her? And why?\n  \"Hey, chick, what the hell are you doing here?\" asks the girl closest to Damon. A\nwhite girl named Cherry with a rocking, bangable body. Damon doesn't normally notice,\nbut he's a little tipsy and not his usual, gentlemanly self. \n  The girl rolls her eyes. \"Does it matter? I'm here. Plus, I wasn't aware it was a\nprivate, rich-bitch party. I wouldn't have came,\" she answers. Her voice is light,\nbut with underlying tension. Her shoulders stiffen.\n  \"Well, why are you here?\" Cherry asks.\n  \"Bitch, I'm here 'cuz I was invited here. Plus, just like you, I want to party,\nflirt, get drunk off my ass, sleep with some hot guy who'll dump me later and tell\nall his friends how good I was in bed, and then get passed to all fo them while still\n'dating' the boy and become a cheap slut. And then, I'll probably become pregnant or\ncontract some diasese like AIDs or HIV. Then, I'll get angry and sleep with all the\nguys I can to spread my diasese around in revenge,\" she says. \"Ooo, is that a\nmargarita? Thank you.\" She pulls the pink straw to her mouth and takes a sip of the\nbright red liquid.\n  Damon chuckles. He, for some reason, can't picture her flirting. Or getting drunk\noff her ass. But he does like her attitude. \n  The back door to the mansion opens. Kenny, the host of the party, comes out. The\ngirl gets up and runs, flinging herself into his arms with a smile. \"Dallas!\" he says\nwith a big grin, hugging her back. \"I didn't think you'd make it! How was California?\nAnd how was--\"\n  \"Later, Ken!\" Dallas chirps, giving him another hug. \"Yeah, after you invited me, I\ndecided to come. I didn't know you'd have slutty hoes here. I seriously thought you\nhas more class than that, br--\" she stops abruptly, looking at him with a soft,\nscared eyes.\n  He smiles at her. \"Glad your back, sis. So glad.\" He pats her back and sticks his\nhand out. \"You're sixteen. No drinking.\"\n  She sighs heavily and hands him the drink. \"Awww, grow up. Might not make you\nhappy, but I'm here to stay.\"\n  \"Cool.\" His eyes tighten, though. He looks concerned, but determined not to show\nit. \"Are you sure?\"\n  \"Very,\" she says. She turns to Cherry suddenly. \"So, bitch, this is my brother. My\nparen't house. If anybody shouldn;t be here, it should be--\"\n  \"You,\" Kenny says, voice hard.\n  She looks at him, hurt in her eyes and face. Then, that face of hard determination\nsettles over her. \"Fine,\" she says with a very sarcastic smile. \"I'll go. Whatever.\"\nHer voice has lost its politeness, formalness. It's a bit....southern. She throws her\nbag over her shoulder. \"See ya later, Kenny. Oh, wait, I won't. I forgot, I don't\nbelong here.\"\n  Her voice is joking, but Damon can sense the hurt.  He gets out of the pool,\nditching Cherry and the other girls. He grabs his cowboy hat from a near-by table and\nputs it on. It'll help for some reason. He's not sure why he's going help her. It\njust feels right. So right. He sighs and steps into her path of walking. \"Hello. I'm\n  \"Dallas,\" she snarls. \"Move. I hafta goo,\" she says. She pauses to look at his hat,\n  \"Why don't you --\"\n  \"Stay? Haha, Damon, very funny. I don't go where I'm nto wanted. Nobody here wants\nme, I'm not wanted in California, and I'm definitely not wanted anywhere else. The\nonly place they want is where I don't want to go--Louisiana.\"\n  \"What's there?\" he inquires, grabbing her wrist unintentionally.\n  \"What I want. Now move,\" she growls, trying to push him.\n  \"No. Stay. I want you to stay. I want you here.\"\n  \"Sure ya do. Iz cuz I'm half-way necked and I have big boobs. What boy doesn't me\nhere for that reason?\" She throws her bag down and pushes him against the wall. \"I\nnever leave without leaving my mark. You're just the poor, helpless mouse that's\ngonna get caught in it this time.\"\n  She grins wildly, eyes unhuman and savage. She presses closely to him. She seems to\nfix exactly into the curve of his body--his hard, musucular, football-player type\nbody. She stops with her lips just seconds away from a kiss from his. Damon stays\nstill, his eyes hard and blank. His face impassive. It's no fun for her if he's not\nscared. Or horny.\n  She brushes her lips lightly across his.\n  Sensuous feelings arouse within him. He grabs her waist, pulling her closer,\nkissing her harder. He crushes her lips to him. He pulls away first. She steps back,\ndizzy. He grins. \"And who's the cat and mouse now?\" he asks, teasingly.\n  She shakes her head. \"I'm still the alley cat. But you're the tom cat, Daddy Cat\nwarned me not to mess with me, Cowboy.\" She winks, takes his cowboy hat, and places\nit on her head. \"Me-ow.\"\n  He trails his fingers on one of her tattoos. A cat-like mark. Underneath it, it\nsays, Alley Cat. He runs his fingers to the start of the tattoo that goes down to her\nass. He stops at the hem of the bikini bottom. She sighs, shaking. \"Stop. Please,\"\nshe whispers, sounding younger and softer. \"Please.\"\n  He keeps it up, using his other hand to pull her closer. What's with him? He wants\nto stop, but he can't. She fights against him, struggling. She looks ready to cry,\nbut Damon can't see her face. He can't really see anything but her back. Anything but\nher tattoos. The one leading down to her ass. And he wants to rip off the bottoms and\nkiss her till they're both naked, rolling on the ground, screwing each other.\n  \"STOP! Please!\" she shrieks, moving away from him. \"Stop, Damon.\" She's actually\ncrying. He can hear it in her voice.\n  Oh, God. What's wrong with me? Damon thinks. \n  He feels sick to his stomach. He removes his hand from her back. She turns around,\nexpression hot and angry, but eyes still wet. \"What the fuck's wrong wit you?\" she\ndemands. She raises her hand back and slaps him. \"You fuckin' perv! Don't touch me\n  She starts sobbing, shuddering. Damon barely feels the hit. He is a vampire after\n\nDallas fights through the crowd, tears welling up in her eyes. How could he do that?\nWhy would he do that? Does he know? Did Kenny tell everybody? Please. What he hell is\nshe going to do? Her plan was to stay here for the night until she found some other\narrangement. But now, she can't stay anywhere. She's not welcomed.\n  She slams the gate into place. Her mind races, filled with thoughts of Damon. How\nshe actually enjoyed his touch for that minute or so, but then it reminded her of a\nfew years ago.....She's aware of what Kenny would've told everyone. \"My sister's a\nslut, a hoe. That's why she went away. They had to control her. Had to. She was wild.\nA regular alley cat.\"\n  But it's not true! Not at all! I know the truth.\n   She takes off for the street. The talking--gossping really--starts again. She can\nhear it in her ears. As sure as she can here her own thoughts. As sure as she can\nfeel her pounding heart. A sickness starts inside of her, so deep, so painful. So\nsad. So many remembers. Released. What is she going to do?\n  A car pulls over. A black Mercedes. Daddy's car.\n  Her eyes widen. \"Oh shit,\" she whispers. \"Not after four years of ignoring you.\" \n  A man gets out. He's tall, blond, with blue eyes. Her father. She gulps, thinking\nabout running. She doesn't like to run. She perfers to take her problems and kill\nthem head-on. But she doesn't know if she's still on restraint from him.\n  So she runs.\n  Runs like someone has a white-hot torch to her butt. She drops her bag. She runs so\nfast, her feet barely touch the ground. She can hear the car behind her. Hear it like\nit's right there. Hear it like her heart. She kicks up speed. She has to be going\nfast. She's so tired. Her side is cramping, sharp, angry pains to her side. Her heart\nis burning, her throat is on fire. Her mouth is dry. She screams. \"Kenny!\" Her voice\nis loud and piercing. Please, hear.\n  She's not very hopeful.\n  The Mercedes pulls over and the door opens. \n  Tears flood down her cheeks, salty and wet. They keep a steady stream, hitting the\npavement. She starts to slow. But she can feel the people behind her. Can feel them\nlike someone feels the sharp slap in the face. \n  Something grabs her waist. She shrieks as she's pulled behind her. She struggles,\nthrashing and kicking. She prays like she has never prayed for. Praying for an\n  \"Dallas, it's me. Damon. Shhh, be still.

        "text":"Fiction by Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman\n\nThe clothes-line was wound securely around the trunks of four gnarled, crooked old apple-trees, which stood promiscuously about the yard back of the cottage. It was tree-blossoming time, but these were too aged and sapless to blossom freely, and there was only a white bough here and there shaking itself triumphantly from among the rest, which had only their new green leaves. There was a branch occasionally which had not even these, but pierced the tender green and the flossy white in hard, gray nakedness. All over the yard, the grass was young and green and short, and had not yet gotten any feathery heads. Once in a while there was a dandelion set closely down among it.\n\nThe cottage was low, of a dark-red color, with white facings around the windows, which had no blinds, only green paper curtains.\n\nThe back door was in the centre of the house, and opened directly into the green yard, with hardly a pretence of a step, only a flat, oval stone before it.\n\nThrough this door, stepping cautiously on the stone, came presently two tall, lank women in chocolate-colored calico gowns, with a basket of clothes between them. They set the basket underneath the line on the grass, with a little clothespin bag beside it, and then proceeded methodically to hang out the clothes. Everything of a kind went together, and the best things on the outside line, which could be seen from the street in front of the cottage.\n\nThe two women were curiously alike. They were about the same height, and moved in the same way. Even their faces were so similar in feature and expression that it might have been a difficult matter to distinguish between them. All the difference, and that would have been scarcely apparent to an ordinary observer, was a difference of degree, if it might be so expressed. In one face the features were both bolder and sharper in outline, the eyes were a trifle larger and brighter, and the whole expression more animated and decided than in the other.\n\nOne woman\u2019s scanty drab hair was a shade darker than the other\u2019s, and the negative fairness of complexion, which generally accompanies drab hair, was in one relieved by a slight tinge of warm red on the cheeks.\n\nThis slightly intensified woman had been commonly considered the more attractive of the two, although in reality there was very little to choose between the personal appearance of these twin sisters, Priscilla and Mary Brown. They moved about the clothesline, pinning the sweet white linen on securely, their thick, white-stockinged ankles showing beneath their limp calicoes as they stepped, and their large feet in cloth slippers flattening down the short, green grass. Their sleeves were rolled up, displaying their long, thin, muscular arms, which were sharply pointed at the elbows.\n\nThey were homely women; they were fifty and over now, but they never could have been pretty in their teens, their features were too irredeemably irregular for that. No youthful freshness of complexion or expression could have possibly done away with the impression that they gave. Their plainness had probably only been enhanced by the contrast, and these women, to people generally, seemed better-looking than when they were young. There was an honesty and patience in both faces that showed all the plainer for their homeliness.\n\nOne, the sister with the darker hair, moved a little quicker than the other, and lifted the wet clothes from the basket to the line more frequently. She was the first to speak, too, after they had been hanging out the clothes for some little time in silence. She stopped as she did so, with a wet pillow-case in her band, and looked up reflectively at the flowering apple-boughs overhead, and the blue sky showing, between, while the sweet spring wind ruffled her scanty hair a little.\n\n\u201cI wonder, Mary,\u201d said she, \u201d if it would seem so very queer to die a mornin\u2019 like this, say. Don\u2019t you believe there\u2019s apple branches a-hangin\u2019 over them walls made out of precious stones, like these, only there ain\u2019t any dead limbs among \u2019em, an\u2019 they\u2019re all covered thick with flowers? An\u2019 I wonder if it would seem such an awful change to go from this air into the air of the New Jerusalem.\u201d Just then a robin hidden somewhere in the trees began to sing. \u201cI s\u2019pose,\u201d she went on, \u201cthat there\u2019s angels instead of robins, though, and they don\u2019t roost up in trees to sing, but stand on the ground, with lilies growin\u2019 round their feet, maybe, up to their knees, or on the gold stones in the street, an\u2019 play on their harps to go with the singin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe other sister gave a scared, awed look at her. \u201cLor, don\u2019t talk that way, sister,\u201d said she. \u201cWhat has got into you lately? You make me crawl all over, talkin\u2019 so much about dyin\u2019. You feel well, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLor, yes,\u201d replied the other, laughing, and picking up a clothespin for her pillow-case; \u201cI feel well enough, an\u2019 I don\u2019t know what has got me to talkin\u2019 so much about dyin\u2019 lately, or thinkin\u2019 about it. I guess it\u2019s the spring weather. P\u2019r\u2019aps flowers growin\u2019 make anybody think of wings sproutin\u2019 kinder naterally. I won\u2019t talk so much about it if it bothers you, an\u2019 I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s sorter nateral it should. Did you get the potatoes before we came out, sister?\u201d\u2013with an awkward and kindly effort to change the subject.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the other, stooping over the clothes-basket. There was such a film of tears in her dull blue eyes that she could not distinguish one article from another.\n\nWell, I guess you had better go in an\u2019 get \u2019em, then they ain\u2019t worth anything, this time of year, unless they soak a while, an I\u2019ll finish hangin\u2019 out the clothes while you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, p\u2019r\u2019aps I\u2019d better,\u201d the other woman replied, straightening herself up from the clothes-basket. Then she went into the house without another word; but down in the damp cellar, a minute later, she sobbed over the potato barrel as if her heart would break. Her sister\u2019s remarks had filled her with a vague apprehension and grief which she could not throw off. And there was something little singular about it. Both these women had always been of a deeply religious cast of mind. They had studied the Bible faithfully, if not understandingly, and their religion had strongly tinctured their daily life. They knew almost as much about the Old Testament prophets as they did about their neighbors; and that was saying a good deal of two single women in a New England country town. Still this religious element in their natures could hardly have been termed spirituality. It deviated from that as much as anything of religion\u2013which is in one way spirituality itself\u2013could.\n\nBoth sisters were eminently practical in all affairs of life, down to their very dreams, and Priscilla especially so. She had dealt in religion with the bare facts of sin and repentance, future punishment and reward. She fad dwelt very little, probably, upon the poetic splendors of the Eternal City, and talked about them still less. Indeed, she had always been reticent about her religious convictions, and had said very little about them even to her sister.\n\nThe two women, with God in their thoughts every moment, seldom had spoken his name to each other. For Priscilla to talk in the strain that she had to-day, and for a week or two previous, off and on, was, from its extreme deviation from her usual custom, certainly startling.\n\nPoor Mary, sobbing over the potato barrel, thought it was a sign of approaching death. She had a few superstitious-like grafts upon her practical, commonplace character.\n\nShe wiped her eyes finally, and went up-stairs with her tin basin of potatoes, which were carefully washed and put to soak by the time her sister came in with the empty basket.\n\nAt twelve exactly the two sat down to dinner in the clean kitchen, which was one of the two rooms the cottage boasted. The narrow entry ran from the front door to the back. On one side was the kitchen and living-room; on the other, the room where the sisters slept. There were two small unfinished lofts overhead, reached by a step-ladder through a little scuttle in the entry ceiling: and that was all. The sisters had earned the cottage and paid for it years before, by working as tailoresses. They had, besides, quite a snug little sum in the bank, which they had saved out of their hard earnings. There was no need for Priscilla and Mary to work so hard, people said; but work hard they did, and work hard they would as long as they lived. The mere habit of work had become as necessary to them as breathing.\n\nJust as soon as they had finished their meal and cleared away the dishes, they put on some clean starched purple prints, which were their afternoon dresses, and seated themselves with their work at the two front windows; the house faced southwest, so the sunlight streamed through both. It was a very warm day for the season, and the windows were open. Close to them in the yard outside stood great clumps of lilac bushes. They grew on the other side of the front door too; a little later the low cottage would look half-buried in them. The shadows of their leaves made a dancing net-work over the freshly washed yellow floor.\n\nThe two sisters sat there and sewed on some coarse vests all the afternoon. Neither made a remark often. The room, with its glossy little cooking-stove, its eight-day clock on the mantel, its chintz-cushioned rocking-chairs, and the dancing shadows of the lilac leaves on its yellow floor, looked pleasant and peaceful.\n\nJust before six o\u2019clock a neighbor dropped in with her cream pitcher to borrow some milk for tea, and she sat down for a minute\u2019s chat after she had got it filled. They had been talking a few moments on neighborhood topics, when all of a sudden Priscilla let her work fall and raised her hand. \u201cHush!\u201d whispered she.\n\nThe other two stopped talking, and listened, staring at her wonderingly, but they could hear nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Miss Priscilla?\u201d asked the neighbor, with round blue eyes.

Lallo Characters: 5759\n\nUpdated: 2018-01-19 12:03\n\nThe seat she chose was at the counter where the drinks were served. The odd plate and knife scattered about the bar assured her that she would be allowed to take her meal there as well. It was not the most luxurious of chairs, but with a handful of empty seats between herself and the nearest denizen of the bar to ease her nerves in such a rowdy place, it would do well enough. She sat and awaited the tavern keeper's service.\n\nSeveral minutes passed, punctuated by stomach rumblings reminding her of the fact she had yet to be served. A glance down the bar revealed the keeper to be in a very spirited conversation with a gruff customer he shared more than a casual resemblance to. She decided that they must be brothers, and chose not to interrupt their conversation. Surely he would take her order soon. As this thought passed through her mind, a particularly thick cloud of pipe smoke wafted past her face. It was all she could do to keep from gagging. She turned a watering eye to the source of the offending fumes.\n\nBehind her, an old man with a patch over his right eye let out a long, raking sound somewhere between a cough and a laugh. The outburst lasted for a disturbingly long time, shaking his body as it progressed. The long, thin pipe he gnawed on was lodged securely between two of the only teeth left in his mouth. The half-rotten things had been used to clutch the stalk of the pipe so often they had parted to make room for it. She winced as a second, far more powerful outburst spread his lips far enough to confirm the solitary standing of the pipe-holding teeth. Another man sat at the table with him, staring intently at her. He looked as though he had not slept in days. On his shoulder was a scragg\n\nher nose up at it. For the sake of harmony, she took another swallow. At any rate, it was a darn sight better than the leathery rain water she had been living off of from her flask day in and day out, and she did not look forward to the flavor of the contents of the soldier's flask either.\n\nThe plate of food was set before her: a slice of rather overcooked goat meat accompanied by a mound of boiled cabbage. A knife clattered to rest beside her plate. She carved a piece of the charred meat, speared it with the knife tip, and tasted it. The morsel required more than its share of chewing to render it fit to swallow. She followed the meat with a mouthful of the typically bland cabbage. Cabbage seemed to be the only vegetable that existed these days, and the flavor was always the same. Absent.\n\nMyranda's jaw ached by the time she had done away with the shoe leather of a main course. It was barely the equal of the disturbingly old provisions that were even now growing older in her pack, but it was thankfully enough to satisfy her appetite. When she pushed the pitted metal plate aside, she was greeted quite swiftly by the innkeeper.\n\nFree to Download MoboReader\n(\u2190 Keyboard shortcut) Previous Contents (Keyboard shortcut \u2192)\n Novels To Read Online Free\n\nScan the QR code to download MoboReader app.\n\nBack to Top",

        "text":"\u201cOne Summer Night\u201d \u2013 1\n\nI\u2019m heading home to see Granny Grace on my way through Ohio. In the past after another year of teaching, I would\u2019ve stayed in New York and complained all summer that there was nothing to do and no one to see. But I\u2019m trying to change my crappy attitude and live life again.\n\nJust thinking of spending all my childhood summers at granny\u2019s flooded my mind with tons of memories. Catching lightening bugs at night and watching the glow in your hand were priceless times as a youth.\n\nDrinking pitchers of Kool-Aid in the hot summer days, did it really matter if it was orange or grape sugar water? O course it mattered. My cousin Eddie and I would argue every time over the \u201cflavor.\u201d Chasing bubbles in the air from granny and swimming in the plastic Snoopy pool seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\nThen there was sleeping in the backyard tent. We always helped Granny Grace put the tent up but we were probably more in the way than any real help. When Eddie would stay over, nine times out of ten we\u2019d be sleeping outside in the tent. It was an adventure only kids truly loved.\n\nAs Eddie and I got older, we would still sleep outside. Only the ghost stories and jokes were traded in for Indians baseball games and rock and roll music from my transistor radio. Until that little battery gave out!\n\nRunning around the yard all sweaty and sitting on the porch with granny there was always cold lemonade and melt-in-your-mouth chocolate chip cookies.\n\nPlaying catch with Granny Grace in the yard it got so dark we couldn\u2019t see the ball. We\u2019d laugh all the time. I think granny enjoyed it as much as I did. Hot dogs for dinner with big bowls of ice cream, \u201cDon\u2019t tell your mother,\u201d she would say.\n\nOf course there were rainy days too. Playing Candyland and Chutes and Ladders, I realized years later that she would let me win every time! Staying up late and watching old black and white scary movies with Lon Chaney Jr., Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, only bowls of popcorn and cups of Kool-Aid could keep the monsters away.\n\nWhen the fourth of July would arrive, granny had sparklers for us. Then we\u2019d watch her neighbors set off fireworks all day and all night. Even when I tried to sleep, I didn\u2019t mind the colorful explosions through the curtains in my room.\n\nThen Labor Day was coming again and it was time to move back to my real home with mom and dad. School was waiting too. But the memories would stay with me until it snowed and Christmas was almost here. At least Granny Grace visited us through the holidays.\n\nI saw the sign for Wilshire and couldn\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve been in Ohio for two hours. Have you ever noticed that every small town has a Main Street and a Front Street? Usually there are streets named after trees (Maple, Cedar, Oak) or after presidents (Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson).\n\nAs I pulled into Granny Grace\u2019s driveway (1213 Beech Street), I reflected on all those summer days and nights. Why does it seem like it\u2019s so much more fun being a child than an adult? Granny came out to meet me with, what else, a plate of chocolate chip cookies!\n\nMichael Woll\n\nPosted in \"One Summer Night\" | Leave a comment\n\n\u201cOne Summer Night\u201d \u2013 2\n\nGranny Grace looked the same as I always remembered. A crazy blue print skirt to her ankles mixed with a mustard colored top with her usual plastic necklaces and bracelets of gold and blue. It was her big head of overflowing white hair that had changed from brown to grey to white. And her sparkling green eyes completed the picture.\n\n\u201cHi Joey, welcome home,\u201d she gave me a big hug without spilling the cookies off the plate. She touched my face,\u201dGetting a little grey in the temples.\u201d She laughed, an infectious laugh that pulled you in until you were laughing just as hard as she did.\n\nWe sat on lawn chairs enjoying again her screened-in porch. I sipped my ice-cold lemonade. \u201cI\u2019m sure mom told you about my second marriage to Brittany ended.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re two for two. Some people aren\u2019t supposed to be married. It\u2019s okay Joey. Put it out of your mind. I have a surprise for you.\u201d She walked back into the house and returned carrying a shoe box.\n\n\u201cMy baseball cards,\u201d I blurted out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you still have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always been in my attic.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank Robinson, Rick Manning, they\u2019re all here and in mint condition. Thanks granny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry to hear about Eddie dying in that car accident last month. Mom called me but I couldn\u2019t get back for the funeral.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d She waved her hand in the air to make it disappear. \u201cLet\u2019s remember the good times. We had a lot of good times didn\u2019t we Joey?\u201d\n\nPutting down the shoe box, I stared out into the yard,\u201dWonderful times, the best of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting dinner now, all your favorites. Why don\u2019t you go outside and look in the garage. I\u2019ve cleaned up your bike and Eddie\u2019s.\u201d She left for the kitchen and I walked into the backyard.\n\nSo many memories were everywhere I looked. The big apple tree in the corner of the yard where \u00a0I kissed a girl, Lucy, for the first time. She ran home crying and I thought I did something wrong. The tall row of sunflowers in the back were, are still standing?\n\nI saw the broken window on the garage from my famous home run swing. It\u2019s still not fixed? But I remember going to that hardware store with granny and buying the new window. I even helped her install it. I entered the garage and there was my bike just like it came out of the Sears window where we bought it decades ago. How could granny have cleaned away dirt and years?\n\n\u201cJoey, Joey, dinner time,\u201d Granny Grace yelled from the porch. I caught myself running to the house. Running? What was going on here?\n\nThe small table featured a platter of fried chicken, a plate of biscuits, and corn on the cob. My smile matched granny\u2019s as we both ate enjoying the early evening breeze. In between bites, I said,\u201dYou outdid yourself granny.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks Joey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to ask you something. I don\u2019t know how to say it but everything seems like old times.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s magical!\u201d Granny had a big smile.\n\n\u201cWait! Did I really see that? Is Eddie riding his bike in the driveway?\u201d\n\nMichael Woll\n\nPosted in \"One Summer Night\" | Leave a comment\n\n\u201cOne Summer Night\u201d \u2013 3\n\nGranny Grace laughed hard until I was laughing too. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a combination of the summer heat and your long drive. Eddie riding his bike? Do you know how silly that sounds?\u201d\n\nI felt foolish and reached for another biscuit. A special summer night with granny was rare these days. \u201cI\u2019m sorry granny. I must be seeing things.\u201d\n\nShe reached behind her and a plate of brownies appeared. \u201cGot room for dessert Joey, your favorite?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could never say no to your brownies granny.\u201d I selected the biggest one just like I used to do in my youth. Were those lightning bugs outside in the night air? \u201cAbout those sunflowers in the back of your yard, I remember planting the seeds and watering them every day. We used to measure me against the height of the sunflowers until they towered high above me. I was surprised to see them still here.\u201d\n\nGranny smiled,\u201dGot good soil I guess. They grow back every year and that tall too. Like when you were a little boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoey, Joey come out and play.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho said that?\u201d I leaped to the screen and stared into the dark night.\n\n\u201cWho said what Joey? Finish your brownie. I\u2019ll do the dishes.\u201d Granny grabbed the plates and silverware disappearing into the kitchen.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see who can catch the most lightning bugs Joey.\u201d\n\nAgain a voice outside, a familiar voice, calling to me. I sat down but my curiosity got the better of me. I ran outside. \u201cEddie, is that you?\u201d\n\nEddie was on his bike. \u201cLet\u2019s race up and down the driveway on our bikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said,\u201dlet\u2019s catch bugs.\u201d We chased the lightning bugs around the yard. \u201cGranny, granny I got four bugs. Come and see them glow!\u201d\n\nGranny, with her big head of brown hair, joined us. \u201cYou boys want to sleep in the tent tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes granny,\u201d Eddie answered.\n\n\u201cYou bet granny.\u201d I said with renewed excitement. \u201cThis is the bestest summer ever!\u201d\n\nMichael Woll\n\nPosted in \"One Summer Night\" | 1 Comment\n\n\u201cDeadly Desire\u201d\n\nI woke up face down on a dirt covered road. My entire body ached and bled. I tried to raise my left arm but it only moved inches. Something burned on my forearm like I was branded with a hot iron. No street lights, no lights of any kind. I\u2019m surrounded by the night. Can\u2019t even move my body off the road. Maybe the pain will go away if I die here in the dark.\n\nBright lights, headlights, moved quickly towards my mangled body. This is how it ends run over by a car in the middle of nowhere. The lights stopped in front of me. Suddenly a female in white illuminated by the headlights (an angel?) walked towards me. \u201cOh my god!\u201d I heard her say then I passed out again.\n\nI remember being lifted onto a stretcher and the loud, blaring sound of the ambulance. Incoherent voices talked to me. Nothing made sense. Everything was blurry. I fought hard to stay awake. People kept talking around me. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky to be alive . . . lost a lot of blood.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve done all I can for him.\u201d \u2018The police want to talk to him when he regains consciousness.\u201d\n\nMy mind saw Isabella\u2019s cover girl face, the source of my greatest joy and my greatest pain. Her long black hair cascaded over the white pillow case. A pear shaped diamond necklace drew my eyes to her sensuous ebony body. Laughing, happy, she enjoyed the moment with me. Isabella\u2019s soft brown eyes invited me to a world of pleasure.\n\nIsabella screamed! Then the pain began.\n\nI recall being thrown from the bed against the far wall. Gilley stood over me. His menacing six foot frame had a muscular build from his obsession with the weight room. \u201cYOU BASTARD!\u201d He kicked me in the stomach. I gasped for breath. \u201cAnd robbing me too!\u201d He emptied the briefcase covering me in a sea of fifty and hundred dollar bills.\n\nIsabella ran from the bedroom wrapped in a sheet crying loudly. Taz, Gilley\u2019s henchman a mountain of muscles and tattoos, rushed in. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cM... (truncated)",

wind confused her hair and stung her eyes,\nbut she refused to leave the bench.\nA bus stop- lonely, isolated and unique.\nShe balanced her petite figure on the seat\nnot for the first time, nor for the tenth.\nThere were no shoes on her feet, but a daisy in her hand\nno jewels on her neck, but a twinkle in her eye.\nThis place was not unfamiliar, but a limbo in her head.\nThe bus stop was forlorn and she always arrived alone.\nEscaping is her passion, they are her muse;\nfriends and rivals, they all looked the same.\nFamiliar faces come and go, to and from the stop.\nThe woman never considered boarding the bus,\nfor this very bench, this was her calming get away;\neverything she thought she wanted, nothing she needed.\nWhere strength is rare and failure recurrent.\nHer efforts are seldom and sporadic\nas they are frequently inspired by false hope alone.\nBut amongst it all, this very spot was her only comfort;\nan ideal medium where whispering was just enough.\n\n1st Place, Grades 7-9\n\nHopelessness by Summer, Grade 7, Fredericksburg\n\nWe were just\nburnt memories\nof ourselves\nwith a thousand years\nof hopelessness\nbehind each crooked smile.\n\nThe roots are abysmal -\ndeeper than the pits\nin my stomach\nand swollen\nlike my dead bones.\n\nI told her\nthat this was no time\nto measure depression\nor to define melancholy\nwhen there was no meaning\nfor sadness\nbut she was already buried\nbeneath herself.\n\nThey do not understand\nthe metaphors;\nthat I was just an empty womb\naccommodated for death\nwhen the graves were all\ncleared out,\nand exhausted\nlike an overused god.\n\nThe outline of her lips\nare still frayed\nand so the emotions\ntangle the words\nand all I\u2019m left with\nis an apology\ntoo hollow\nfor hope.\n\nWe are outdated -\nfaded into sepia portraits\nand rusted statues\nlike renovated reflections:\n\nJust made for show\n\n2nd Place, Grades 7-9\n\nThe Window Beyond Mine by Racheal, Grade 9, Spotsylvania\n\nI live in a very large house,\nwith a chimney and a pool,\nYes i'm rich but not a fool.\n\nWhen i looked out my window\nAbout a mile away,\nIt was kind of strange in that sort of way,\n\nIt was small shack,\nPointing my way,\nThis of course lacked,\nA door and a frame.\n\nBut it did have a large window,\nWhich was half slanted,\nin some crazy way,\n\nI saw a girl looking my way,\nShe was wearing red plaid,\nand a hat that sagged.\n\nShe started waving,\nAnd i waved back,\nShe sat up\nand i turned around.\n\nNo one ever saw her,\nand i would never tell.\n\n3rd Place, Grades 7-9\n\nUs by Melissa, Grade 8, Stafford\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel deprived\nof happiness and bliss,\nbecause every time\nI think of our first kiss, now\n\ninstead of dreams,\nthere are only nightmares.\n\nYou took my innocence,\nyou tore and tear,\nyou obviously don\u2019t care\nas much as I do\n\nBecause the words you said\nwere only a few,\nthe things you did\nI could never do,\n\nYou made me hate you,\nbut that\u2019s your flaw.\n\nYou know what you did.\nYou did it.\nYou saw.\n\nHonorable Mentions, Grades 7-9\n\nJust Press Delete by Melissa, Grade 8, Stafford\n\nWith the click of a mouse\nyou can have friends,\nbut still the sadness never ends.\n\nTag a memory,\nbut you still feel empty.\n\nJust because you add a friend,\ndoesn\u2019t mean you have any.\n\nYou can delete yourself\nfrom the world,\nbut you\u2019re still stuck in it.\n\nYou should probably\ntake a second look\nat Facebook.\n\nThe Silence by Raven, Grade 9, Westmoreland\n\nIt's a silence that runs through our veins\nSlowly swallowing every source of heat\nTelling us everything we once knew\nWas gone and lost forever\nIt's the same silence\nThat makes every part of us turn numb\nIts like we're laying in the snow\nWith no clothing to protect us\nThey tell us to cry\nTo show all the emotions\nThat we are feeling\nWhen in truth\nWe are only feeling one thing\nThe silence.....\n\nSpanish siesta, by Megan, Grade 9, Spotsylvania\n\nQueso Manchego and bread. An afternoon lunch.\nI, sprouting limbs from tennis shoes and stringy spaghetti as hair.\nThe air, still heavy and humid, washed over the town. Cebreros.\nA panting dog, only to break the unexpurgated silence.\n\nThe smoke of my Grandpa's tobacco mingled with the warm air.\nIf a pin dropped, it could be heard a hundred miles away.\nElena's house on a hill near the centro de la cuidad.\nTapas with beef wafted from my Grandma's stove.\n\nHer wrinkles, carved by eighty years of labor and love.\nEveryone in the world, town at least, was dreaming.\nThe sun beat down on my head\nand the chalky ground danced with the olive trees.\n\n\"Go to sleep now,\" she whispered.\nA hammock I chose and drifted off,\nsweetly humming Spanish lullabies.",

        "text":"Jack Higgins \u2013 The Savage Day\n\n\u2018What they used to call Lags\u2019 Luck when I was in prison,\u2019 he said as he switched off the engine.\n\n\u2018Never mind that,\u2019 I said. \u2018Let\u2019s have that wheel off and the spare on and out of here double quick. I\u2019ve somehow got a feeling that it\u2019s healthier to stay on the move.\u2019\n\nBinnie handled the jack while I got the spare out of the boot. As I wheeled it round to him, a Land-Rover passed\n\nus going towards Plumbridge. It vanished into the mist, but a moment kter reappeared, reversing towards us.\n\nThe driver got out and came round to join us. He was no more than eighteen or nineteen. A lance-corporal in the Royal Corps of Transport.\n\nHe saluted smartly. \u2018Anything I can do, sir?\u2019\n\nHis attitude was natural enough at the sight of a Major getting his hands dirty. I made the first mistake by trying to get rid of him. \u2018No, everything\u2019s under control, Corporal, off you go.\u2019\n\nThere was a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He hesitated, then leaned down to Binnie who reacted violently. \u2018You heard what he said, didn\u2019t you ? Clear off.\u2019\n\nIt was an understandable reaction to stress, but delivered as it was in that fine Kerry accent of his, it compounded my original error.\n\nThe corporal hesitated, seemed about to speak, then thought better of it. He saluted punctiliously, then moved back to the Land-Rover. He started to get inside, or so it seemed, then turned and I saw that he was holding a Sterling.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d like to see your identity card if you don\u2019t mind, sir,\u2019 he said firmly.\n\n\u2018Now look here\/ I said.\n\nBinnie straightened slowly and the lad, who knew his business, I\u2019ll say that for him, said, \u2018Hands on top of the car.\u2019\n\nCork walked straight towards him, a puzzled smile on his face. Tor heaven\u2019s sake, young man\/ he said, \u2018control yourself. You\u2019re making a terrible mistake.\u2019\n\n\u2018Stand back,\u2019 the young corporal said. \u2018I warn you.\u2019\n\nBut he had hesitated for that one fatal second that seemed to give Cork his opportunity. He flung himself forward, clutching at the Sterling. There was the briefest of struggles. I had already taken a couple of strides to join\n\nhim when there was a single shot. Cork staggered back with a terrible cry and fell on his back.\n\nI put a fist into the corporal\u2019s stomach and a knee in his face as he doubled over that laid him unconscious at the side of the Land-Rover and was better than a bullet in the head from Binnie.\n\nHe was already on his knees beside Cork, who was obviously in great pain and barely conscious, blood on his lips. I ripped open the front of his cassock and looked inside. It was enough.\n\n\u2018Is it bad ?\u2019 Binnie demanded.\n\n\u2018Not good. From the looks of it, I\u2019d say he\u2019s been shot through the lungs. He needs a doctor badly. Where\u2019s the nearest hospital ? Stramore ?\u2019\n\n\u2018And life imprisonment if he pulls through ?\u2019 Binnie said.\n\n\u2018Have you got a better idea ?\u2019\n\n\u2018We could try to get him over the border into the Republic.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Even if we could pull it off, it\u2019s too far. There isn\u2019t time. He needs skilled treatment as soon as possible.\u2019\n\n\u2018Twelve miles,\u2019 he said, clutching my flak jacket. \u2018That\u2019s all, and I know a farm track south of Clady that runs clear into the Republic. There\u2019s a hospital no more than three miles on the other side run by the Little Sisters of Pity. They\u2019ll take him in.\u2019\n\nOne thing was certain. Another vehicle might appear from the mist at any moment so whatever we were going to do had to be done fast \u2018Right, get him into the Land-Rover,\u2019 I said.\n\nWe lifted him in between us, putting him out of sight behind the rear seat, then I got out again, knelt beside the unconscious corporal and tied his hands behind his back with his belt.\n\nBinnie joined me as I finished. \u2018What are we going to do with him?\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll have to take him with us. Can\u2019t afford to have anybody find him too soon.\u2019\n\nBinnie\u2019s anger boiled over suddenly and he kicked the unconscious man in the side. \u2018If he got his deserts, I\u2019d put a bullet in him.\u2019\n\nPage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81\n\nCategories: Higgins, Jack",

        "text":"Get Your Premium Membership\n\nIn Builda Land\n\nOnce upon a time, in a Kansas City Public School, There was a teacher named Builda. We are all given the same rules. Every year, the principal says, \"The first two weeks of school are not for teaching any academics. The first two weeks are for teaching character traits, building trust, and bonding with your class, and letting them bond with each other. Oh, yes, and for giving them your rules.\" Builda LOVES the first two weeks. Because she does not hear any of the speech of the principal except the part she wants to hear, which is \"give them the rules.\" Builda is one hundred percent happy about this as she has rules for getting a drink of water at the fountain, rules for which side of the lettering of your pencil should be face up, which foot to step first with while walking in line. You can hear Builda barking her rules those first two weeks of school with absolutism, and pride. In case you missed this, the weeks that are for bonding, are not used for bonding or community building, because Builda cannot have any of that because that might mean the children would be allowed a voice. Children are not to talk in Buildaland. What could they possibly have to say? They haven't been to college, right? One day I was counseling one of Builda's students, when Builda peeked through the 2 inch window in my door, which is 9 foot up, promptly ran in screaming, grabbed the child by the neck and trotted him back to class because we were just \"playing\" and that made her extremely angry, never being a child who got to play. Builda's mother had died when she was 3, and since that time, Builda had been extremely encouraged to be a foot soldier or prison guard. I am sure she would have been great at both, and wished she would have taken this advice rather than be a teacher. Why do I think there was little bonding? Because in May, after three years in Builda's class, as it was a Montessori classroom, so children are held hostage by the same directress for three whole miserable years, two of Builda's third year students asked me if Builda was married. \"Why don't you ask her?\" I suggested. They shrieked with the silliness of that. Oh, boy. Here is my dilema, do I dare tell them that Mrs. Key is married? I dared not tell them which is exactly what I did actually. They were shocked that someone with that can-do-and-better-do-exactly-what-I-want-you-to-do-now had actually caught a man. The news went through the building like wildfire. I was expecting to have a shout-at-you with Builda, but it never came. Perhaps she was loosening up a bit? I learned the ordinary way that Builda was a little competitive. When she discovered that all of the children in every class wanted to eat lunch with me every day even the Monday holidays when we were not at school, Builda decided to have little competitiive \"lunch with the teacher\" luncheons on Friday. The first Friday was a huge success for her as she had 5 children signed up. I did not tell her there were 22 eating with me, because I understood her ways, and did not think it wise. Especially since ten of them were from her classroom. Her luncheons went from bad to worse: 5 children, 2 children, 1 child in three weeks. She asked me for pointers. I said, \"Can I come to lunch with you, so I can see how things are?\" Yes, she said. \"That will be great.\" I walked in and said, \"Hi, everybody! I'm here for lunch with you today! \"That is one demerit for Mrs. K,\" Builda said. It seems I was \"off topic,\" and Mrs. Key's luncheons are all about staying on topic, which was multiplication today. I swiftly began rattling off all of the multiplication facts I know, which pretty much is the multiplication table.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 | Year Posted 2018\n\nPost Comments\n\nPoetrysoup is an environment of encouragement and growth so only provide specific positive comments that indicate what you appreciate about the poem.\n\nPlease Login to post a comment\n\nA comment has not been posted for this poem.
