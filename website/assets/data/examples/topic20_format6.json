        "text":"Secure Surfing to Go: VPN Made Easy\n\nBy | March 6, 2006\n\nA VPN basically creates a secure channel, or tunnel, between two endpoints\u2014in this case, between my laptop and the secure network at the office\u2014to safely connect two trusted parties through an unsecured public network (the Internet). VPNs can also be used to link PCs to VPN routers or create protected peer-to-peer connections among two or more PCs.\n\nPackets traveling over the VPN tunnel are encapsulated and encrypted, divulging no useful information about their contents to eavesdropping packet sniffers. Luckily, you don\u00b4t need a business IT budget or infrastructure to set up and use your own VPN. There are a number of free and low-cost options out there, varying in complexity and performance. In addition to safe surfing, you\u00b4ll also get secure, remote access to other local resources like network drives, printers, and shared files from other networked PCs.Read Full Story\n\nLeave a Reply",

Learn more.\n\nMobility, cloud and big data all promise to help enterprises increase efficiency and productivity, improve decision-making and lower costs. The laudable goal is to make your business more competitive, but for your IT, legal and compliance teams, these new technologies often lead to increased complexity, loss of control and even increased costs as massive amounts of data now move to an ever-increasing number of endpoints, including mobile devices and third-party hosting services. These challenges can be overcome with a new approach to standardizing information metadata.\n\nIf IT doesn\u2019t fully understand what data exists and where various types of information are located, then it can\u2019t ensure that the right people have the right access at the right time, and it certainly can\u2019t adequately secure the data against breaches and theft, or delete private information as required by new privacy laws. E-discovery costs can skyrocket as the amount of data that needs to be collected increases. Even business users can suffer as the information they need for daily activities and the data they want to use for big data analytics become harder to find and control, leading to lower productivity and redundant effort, while undercutting the hoped-for improvements in decision-making.\n\nTo maintain control over their burgeoning data stores, organizations need to develop insight across all data, no matter who creates it, where it lives, and with whom it\u2019s shared. Unfortunately, most companies see this as a hugely expensive and disruptive challenge. However, there is actually a very simple and cost-effective way of doing this, as long as you\u2019re willing to do it over time \u2014 which is still far better than not doing it at all.\n\nTo continue reading this article register now",
