(Bob) Larammee (Computer Science) and Steve Williams (ISS).\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nSelect\u00a0current projects in Heritage & History, Literature, Linguistics, Political & Social Sciences, Media & Communication, Future Media \/ Human-Computer Interaction:\n\nHeritage & History\n\n  \u2022 Welsh Copper\u00a0\u2013 Alex Langlands, Stuart Griffin, and other members of the Heritage team have on-going interests in new\u00a0modes of heritage site visitor interaction at the Hafod Morfa Coppeworks site, and more generally as part of the industrial heritage of the Lower Swansea Valley\n  \u2022 History of Computing Collection: John tucker (Computer Science) and Steve Williams (Library) have set up this collection to chart the development of\u00a0computing and its impact, and to support studies of digital collection and\u00a0preservation. It has extensive material on\u00a0computing before computers, software\u00a0development, computer\u00a0education,\u00a0and\u00a0local\u00a0histories of ICT.\n  \u2022 Extracting information from series of historical maps \u2013 Dan Power, Matthew Stevens, and Richard Turner (History & Classics) have worked with Dan Archambault, Jason Xie, and others (Computer Science) on techniques for \u2018lifting\u2019 data from old maps into GIS systems. They are\u00a0visualizing the year-by-year evolution of the medieval Welsh Marcher Lordships, but the work has many more\u00a0applications.\n  \u2022 Adam Mosley (History and MEMO: Centre for Medieval and Early Modern Research): \u2018The Correspondence of Tycho Brahe\u2019 and \u2018The Correspondence of Giovanni Antonio Magini\u2019, in Early Modern Letters Online\n\n\n  \u2022 Amy Dillwyn (1845-1935) was a pioneering lesbian industrialist, campaigner for women\u2019s and workers\u2019 rights, novelist and diarist.\u00a0Kirsti Bohata is working on a digital edition of her diaries.\n  \u2022 Elizabeth Montagu\u00a0(1718-1800) \u2013 Caroline Franklin is an editor of the digital edition of her letters.\u00a0 Elizabeth Montagu (1718-1800) was a pioneering Shakespeare critic and\u00a0a vital figure in the history of women\u2019s contribution to the Enlightenment. The extant correspondence of \u00a0c.8000 letters to and from notable figures of the day such as Edmund Burke, David Garrick, Elizabeth Carter and Hannah More\u00a0constitutes an extremely important archive for eighteenth-century studies into literature, linguistics, theatre, politics, architecture, economics and women\u2019s history. Previously, scholars had to travel to California to study the correspondence. This COAH\/ISS project, in collaboration with Oxford Brookes University and the Huntington Library, CA, is creating an open access scholarly edition of the Montagu letters, on a purpose-built platform. It is funded by AHRC, the Foyle Foundation and MHRA as well as through a philanthropic donor. The digital edition will provide\u00a0zoomable images of the manuscripts alongside transcriptions, annotation, maps and illustrations.\u00a0They will be presented as a series of epistolary friendships, each introduced by an expert. However the letters are also available\u00a0 chronologically and are entirely searchable.\n  \u2022 TransVis\/VVV \u2013 Tom Cheesman and Bob Laramee lead a team working on visualizations of analyses of multiple alternative translations.\n  \u2022 European Travellers to Wales\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Kathryn Jones is\u00a0part of the team using digital tools to investigate and visualise the history of European travellers\u2019 writings about Wales.\n\nPolitical and Social Sciences\n\n  \u2022 What are the Odds?\u201d \u2013 Matt Wall and Rory Costello (Political and Cultural Studies) and Stephen Lindsay (Computer Science) are extracting and analysing data from political gambling sites\n  \u2022 \u2013 David Bewley-Taylor (Political and Cultural Studies) leads the Global Drugs Policy Observatory,\u00a0working inter alia on the \u2018dark web\u2019.\n\nMedia & Communication\n\n  \u2022 Digital Media: Rhys Jones, William Merrin, and Yan Wu (all in:\u00a0Media and Communication) are working on aspects of global and local digital media including: \u00a0 \u00a0digital divides, \u00a0 data journalism,\u00a0 \u00a0Welsh (minority language) social media uses, \u00a0 citizen journalism, \u00a0 digital media literacy and pedagogy\n  \u2022 Virtual Reality: Leighton Evans is interested in the depth of immersion in consumer VR and the social, political and economic implications of this new medium. Through phenomenological and post-phenomenological theoretical positions, Leighton\u2019s current work is concerned with how immersion is experienced by users with the current generation of VR technology and what the implications of this are for current and future usage.\n\nFuture Media \/ Human-Computer Interaction\n\n  \u2022 \u2013 Matt Jones leads the Future Interaction Technology lab, awarded an EPSRC Digital Economy Centre grant 2015-2020: CHERISH-DE\n\nPast Projects\n\n  \u2022 Nuria Lorenzo-Dus (Linguistics) and Robert Laramee (Computer Science) worked on techniques for visualising the dynamics of social media, in terms of linguistics-based analyses of users\u2019 influence on others.\n  \u2022 Tycho Brahe\u2019s Letters \u2013 Adam Mosley (History & Classics) was part of Oxford University\u2019s Early Modern Letters Online (Cultures of Knowledge) project, creating a digital gateway to Tycho Brahe\u2019s correspondence.\n  \u2022 Ancient Egyptian\u00a0Demon Things\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Kasia\u00a0Szpakowska (Classics, Ancient History and Egyptology) and two now-completed PhD students created a Leverhulme Trust funded pilot interactive database of ancient Egyptian supernatural attested found on selected types of objects\u00a0\u2013 a globally extensible data collection. Two versions of the database are\u00a0publicly\u00a0available, one of which is a sampler created by a computer science student supervised by Rita Borgo (Computer Science).",
