        "text":"History of IZA\n\nDedicated to the future of labor\n\nSince its founding in 1998, IZA has become a leading center in national and international labor market research and policy advice. The current profile of the institute is rooted in a history characterized by diverse research initiatives and a unique global network.\n\nPioneering work in science, service and policy advice\n\nIZA was initiated by the Deutsche Post Foundation and its President, Klaus Zumwinkel, who also serves as President of IZA. Established for the purpose to foster research, science and education, the Deutsche Post Foundation has been providing IZA with substantial funding for more than 20 years now, thereby ensuring its financial and intellectual independence. As required by law, the Deutsche Post Foundation itself acts independently from its founder, Deutsche Post DHL.\n\nDuring the crisis of the German labor market at the end of the 1990s, the vision of IZA\u2019s founders was to establish a new, independent research institute that would be able to concentrate entirely on labor market research and evidence-based policy advice. Free from the constraints of commissioned research and other dependencies, IZA was charged with developing sustainable concepts for the future of work. This initiative of the Deutsche Post Foundation is still unparalleled in the German research landscape. It has not only created ideal working conditions for IZA as a non-profit research institution, but it has also pushed German labor market research in general towards greater independence and international competitiveness.\n\nLocal and global\n\nIZA has always aimed at reconciling scientific excellence with impartial policy advice. Under the leadership of its founding director, Klaus F. Zimmermann, the institute rose within a few years to the top of international labor economics and found its role as a place of professional communication between science, politics and society. IZA maintains its headquarters in Bonn, the former German capital, which has seen many political and often visionary debates in the past \u2013 a tradition that has also inspired IZA.\n\nThe international team at our headquarters, and our fellows and affiliates worldwide, are the key assets of IZA. Our success would not have been possible without the global network activities coordinated from Bonn. The combination of a local research center and global network has enabled IZA to swiftly bring together expert groups to work on specific projects dealing with current challenges of labor market policy. Hardly any other research institute has this sort of infrastructure, which has proven its worth over the past 20 years.\n\nThe constant exchange within the network ensures that IZA always remains up-to-date and incorporates the latest empirical findings and research methods into its work. This is what drives our impact and credibility.\n\n\nIn numerous independent research reports for German, European and international institutions, as well as in various scientific publications, IZA has always critically but constructively assessed labor market policies and developments. IZA has been advising, among others, the European Commission, the European Parliament, national ministries, foundations and global institutions such as the World Bank or the OECD.\n\nThese are some examples of notable achievements in IZA\u2019s history of research and policy advice:\n\n- supporting the German government\u2019s Independent Commission on Immigration with analyses of the short- and long-term demand for immigration to fill labor shortages;\n\n- accompanying the Hartz reforms in Germany with comprehensive evaluation studies;\n\n- constructing the IZA\/IAB Administrative Evaluation Dataset (AED) and the IZA\/IAB Linked Evaluation Dataset 1993-2010 (LED), which link administrative data with survey data, thus enabling new approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of active labor market policies;\n\n- developing the IZA Policy Simulation Model (IZA\u03a8MOD), a behavioral microsimulation model regularly used to assess the labor market and distributional impact of social policy reform proposals;\n\n- evaluating pilot projects for the use of anonymous job applications at the federal and state level in order to assess the potential of this approach to combat discrimination in the hiring process and to promote diversity;\n\n- analyzing demographic change to estimate future shortages of skilled labor in the German and European labor markets;\n\n- coordinating the GLM|LIC initiative on behalf of the UK Department of International Development (DFID), which supports a large number of research projects aimed at improving living conditions in low-income countries;\n\n- reaching framework agreements with the European Parliament and federal ministries to provide decision-makers with timely expertise on specific labor market topics;\n\n- directing the conception and implementation of a large-scale project for the German government to evaluate federal policies to promote the social and labor market integration of refugees.\n\nAll these activities share IZA\u2019s main objectives to facilitate communication between science and practice, to make labor market research more visible, and to encourage labor economists to provide evidence-based policy advice.\n\nPromoting research \u2013 through cooperation and competition\n\nWe are proud that our approach has proven successful and has led other institutions to adopt our understanding of labor market research as a constructively critical partner in policymaking. IZA has partnered with many of these institutions over the years, but also engages in fair and mutually respectful scientific competition that serves to advance our discipline.\n\nWe believe that our work has contributed to improving the process of policy design and evaluation, which today relies much more strongly on scientific expertise than in the past.\n\nRooted in our tradition as an impartial source of research and policy advice, IZA will further sharpen its thematic focus on the future of work, while continuing to exercise its role as a global cluster of excellence in labor market research.",

Today, CEPR\u2019s network of Research Fellows and Affiliates includes over 1,000 of the top economists conducting research on issues affecting the European economy. Researchers are based in their home institutions (universities, research institutes, central bank research departments, and international organisations), and collaborate through the Centre in the pursuit of policy-relevant economic research and dissemination activities.\u00a0\n\nCEPR organises approximately 80 meetings a year, and produces over 700 discussion papers, reports and books. The headquarters of CEPR are based in London and until now London was also the main place to organise the meetings.

Combined, these aspirations created the first brand new higher educational institution in living memory \u2013 a development that some government bureaucrats did their best to hinder.\u00a0\n\n1996 - LIPA was officially opened by Her Majesty The Queen on 7th June.\n\n2003 \u2013 Mark\u2019s keenness to spread the LIPA philosophy saw the establishment of the first LIPA 4-19 academy in Liverpool, which opened with 200 students.\n\nToday, LIPA is an acknowledged part of the UK\u2019s higher education provision for the performing arts, providing degree-level learning for both performers and those who make performance possible.\u00a0 By uniquely blending specialist and generic skills, LIPA\u2019s unique curriculum enables students to collaborate as much as possible - after all, every performance event requires team work.\n\nLIPA offers degree courses in Acting, Community Drama, Dance, Music Theatre and Entertainment Management, Music, Sound Technology, Theatre and Performance Design and Theatre and Performance Technology.\u00a0 It also runs full-time one year Foundation Certificates in Acting and Musical Theatre, Commercial Dance and Popular Music and Sound, and also combines performance, technical innovation and business awareness.\n\nLIPA has an enviable record of its graduates gaining sustained work in the performing arts. Every year it conducts a survey of its graduates, three years after they have graduated. For the past four years, it has traced on average 85% of each year group and, of these, on average 93% are in work and 82% are working in the performing arts.\n\nCurrently, LIPA has 787 students who are either studying on one of its eight degree programmes or on one of its three Foundation Certificate programmes. Some 231 of those students are from 36 international countries. As well as helping students develop themselves for their future professions, LIPA's impressive mix of nationalities also helps its students build strong international links.\n\nSimilarly, LIPA 4-19 has continued to grow since its inception, and now has over 600 students attending on Saturdays or Sundays, with a sister branch in Maghull. There are also LIPA 4-19 Associate Academies across the country too.\u200b",

        "text":"The only School to have an Honours Board for the Head of the Charity Committee, but not for the Head Boy?\n\nAt CLS, we are proud to run what is consistently the most successful annual school charity appeal in the country, raising sums which are regularly in excess of \u00a350,000 and with a record of \u00a3120,000.\n\nThese numbers speak for themselves and our appeal is unique in several other ways.\n\nFirstly, the appeal is run by the boys themselves. Each year, a Committee of around 35 boys in Junior Sixth is appointed to organise events and keep account of the money raised. Fundraising, however, is undertaken by all boys and trophies for the most successful form and individual fundraisers are offered as incentives. Our appeal gives excellent organisational experience for those on the Committee, and imbues all our boys with a sense of social responsibility.\n\nSecondly, the charities to which the money is donated are chosen entirely democratically. One charity is proposed in each category of humanitarian aid, international development, local, and health-related charities. After a week of intense campaigning, all boys and teachers each receive one vote and a new group of charities is chosen. This process encourages the boys to think about the issues that they are most passionate about and to engage in careful consideration regarding a wide range of causes.\n\nWe ensure that the chosen charity\u2019s message is shared strongly with the boys at all events and we invite representatives from the charity to deliver assemblies in order that everyone has a clear idea of the importance of the issues being addressed and of the ways in which the money we raise is being used. Where possible, we have also had boys visiting projects of the charities we support, reporting back about their experiences to the rest of the school to further impart this message.\n\nTypes of fundraising events the School hosts:\n\n  \u2022 Sponsored Walk\n    All boys participate in this 11-mile walk along the Thames in the Summer Term.\n  \u2022 Winter\/Summer Fayre\n    Each form sets up a stand to raise money and the whole School attends.\n  \u2022 \u00a310 Challenge\n    Boys in OG and First Form have a month in which they are to make as much as they can from \u00a310 which they are given.\n  \u2022 UniverCity Challenge\n    Teachers go head-to-head representing their universities in front of an audience of expectant boys, with all ticket proceeds going towards the appeal. Other ticketed events have included \u2018City\u2019s Got Talent\u2019, \u2018Teacher Sumo Wrestling\u2019 and \u2018The CLX Factor\u2019.\n  \u2022 Sponsored Row\n    Boys in the Upper School row on rowing machines in shifts non-stop for 48 hours during the last week of the Summer term, sleeping in School and collecting thousands from passers-by on the neighbouring Millennium Bridge approach.\n  \u2022 Form Events\n    Individual forms organise regular events, such as cake sales, sponsored events, and raffles.\n  \u2022 Quiz\n    Parents and teachers are invited to the annual quiz, at which there is a raffle in aid of the Charity Appeal.\n  \u2022 Wine-tasting\n    The Committee organises an annual wine-tasting fundraiser for parents and teachers.\n  \u2022 Jazz Evening\n    An auction and raffle are held at the annual Jazz Evening, at which various bands and ensembles play, organised by the Committee and the Music Department.\n  \u2022 Ceilidh\n    Parents and teachers are invited to this highly entertaining evening of traditional Scottish music and dancing, in aid of the Charity Appeal.\n  \u2022 Busking\n    Individual boys and ensembles take turns to busk outside the School and in nearby tube stations, collecting money from commuters.\n  \u2022 Individually Organised Events\n    Every year a number of boys decide to organise their own event for the School\u2019s appeal, previously including marathons and skydives.\nOurs is a School founded on a donation and with charity and generosity woven into its very fabric.\n\nThe Levene Learning Centre\n\nOur new Learning Centre\nlearn more\n\nPhilosophy for Teaching and Learning\n\nWhat makes CLS unique?\nlearn more\n\nPupil Welfare\n\nHow we safeguard our boys' welfare\nlearn more\n\n\nDelivering more than just enviable results\nlearn more\n\n\nAn ambitious programme meets inspirational talent\nlearn more\n\nArt & Design\n\nThe creative heart of the School\nlearn more\n\n\nOutstanding performances delivered time and again\nlearn more\n\n\nEnrichment for the pupils and for the School\nlearn more\n\nPartnership & Outreach\n\nWorking closely with others\nlearn more\n\n\nWe raised over \u00a358k for Farm Africa last year - this year it's Centrepoint\nlearn more\n\nSchool Video\n\nWritten, filmed and produced by the pupils\nlearn more",
