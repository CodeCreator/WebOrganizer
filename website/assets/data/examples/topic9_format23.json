        "text":"CloudChoice helped turn our firm's clunky help-desk into a fine-tuned ticketing system in only a matter of hours. They began by providing a quote that was firm-specific and based on the changes we were looking for, offering a very competitive price. Not only were they able to assist in providing and implementing best-practices for our FreshDesk, but they were able to complete actual coding on the back-end in order to make customizations specific to our firm. Their team is very responsive with fast turnaround times. In an instance where we required an urgent update, the CloudChoice team was able to get on a call and resolve the issue within a couple of hours. I highly recommend the CloudChoice team to anyone looking to ramp-up their ticketing system for maximum efficiency.\nCarrie Frye\nGreat local business providing IT consulting services.

        "text":"Matthew Lesko\n\nDo you want to know what you REALLY get with Matthew Lesko.\n\nLike many others, I wanted to know! His book so he says, lists government giveaways for just about every conceivable reason.\n\nThe government has many programs designed to help people in different situations. I wanted to see what my friends in Washington were holding for me.\n\nWhat I received was a HUGE encyclopedia of the Government beaurocracy and SIX HOURS of Matthew Lesko on tape. No one needs that much of him!\n\nThe Book really did have worlds of information, and it covered a large variety of topics. Too Many!\n\nIt was not very clear about the details of the programs and in calling a lot of the phone numbers I found that many were disconnected. Some did have addresses, but the few I mailed to never responsed. So I don't know if they were valid, I suspect they were old or had changed.\n\nThe Manual also says NOTHING about what to say or how to properly request these Grants and Giveaways. I subsequently learned that the manner in which you request these monies is VITALLY important, So this is definitely not a \"How To\" book!\n\nMr. Lesko's website seems to be an exaggerated version of the book. There is a little info on the best ways to apply for the Grants and Giveaways, but not much. I don't think this site clarifies that process much at all.\n\nEven if you have an unlimited amount of time, a great deal of patience, and an excitement level equal to Mr. Lesko(which seems impossible to me)that there might be some validity to this offer, but even then you may be wasting your time.\n\nEach year in the summer months the Federal Government prints a list of all the Grant and Loan programs. Matthew Lesko seems to be a little behind, you would think, at least he would be up to date.\n\nI have tried and tested thousands of opportunities and ONLY ONE still provides a ROCK SOLID income.

Armed with a steady stream of data in an easy to understand format, we held customer turnover to less than 10% of the industry norms.\n\nIn one of our secondary markets in which we witnessed market share erosion, Research Inc. gave us market intelligence that allowed us to initiate strategies and tactical actions that stopped the bleeding and helped us regain market share.\n\nHaving Research Inc. as a strategic partner is a \u2018no-brainer.\u2019\n\n- Nat Padget, Former President - Flag Bank (purchased by RBC Centura)\nI\u2019ve worked with plenty of other research firms and I can tell you exactly why I keep coming back to Research Inc. A lot of people can do the study, but Debbie McNamara takes the data to the next step. She not only gives you a good report, she tells you the marketing implications of what you\u2019ve found out. Then, she can easily present it to leadership of my organization. She\u2019s a fabulous presenter. She uses lots of colorful graphics, and relates the findings in a way anyone can understand.\n\nDebbie is the consummate professional. She always presents her method, what you can expect, and the deliverables. She\u2019s wonderful to work with. Her true differentiator, though, is her analysis and presentation of the research.\n\n- Janet Moore, Director of Marketing - Mission Hospitals\n\nEveryone starts out with hypotheses and expectations, and it\u2019s tempting to organize the questions to confirm what you already believe. One thing Research Inc. is very good at is keeping us from falling in love with our own PR. Debbie McNamara made sure the focus groups were structured so that we got the answers we needed, not just the ones we wanted to hear.\n\nPositioning a publication like ours is a balancing act. Recruitment of participants was critical, and Research Inc. did a great job of assuring a representative sample. Debbie McNamara was great to work with, very professional. The information provided by Research Inc. was essential to the early success of the magazine.\u201d\n\n- Richard Caron, Director of New Business Development - Coats & Clark\n\nResearch Inc. has run focus groups, done quantitative studies and surveys, anything we need in consumer research. Debbie always provides a report, analyzing the data and pointing out evidence of our successes or opportunities for improvement. If we need to look at the feedback from different angles, she accommodates that, too. I\u2019ve been very satisfied with her work.\u201d\n\n- Doug Udall, Market Insights Manager - Arch Chemicals\n\nOur partnership with Research, Inc. has allowed up to create concise, actionable plans to communicate the right message at the right time to the right people.\u00a0 Debbie and her team are extremely responsive, and take great pride in understanding our business needs.\u00a0 They work with us - not for us - to identify the best research solutions to meet our needs.\u00a0 We consider them part of our extended family.\n\n- Beth Jaskiewicz, SVP, Marketing - South Carolina Federal Credit Union\n\nWe are always happy when we have the opportunity to take a project to Greenville and are able to work with Patricia Winn and Research Inc.\u00a0 Having worked with them for quite a few years on many projects, we know that any project will be handled in the utmost professional manner and with complete reliability.\u00a0 We can count on prompt reporting, high show rates and great recruits in their spacious facility.\u00a0 Quantitative as well as qualitative projects are handled in the same professional manner.\n\nTheir research team headed by Debbie McNamara is highly regarded by us and everyon we know who has had the pleasure and opportunity to work with them.\n\n- Judy DuBose, Managing Partner - Midlands Market Research and Coastal Focus LLC",

Customer Service is second to none\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat service & easy to use!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just works \u2013 what more could you ask for.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick and easy setup, great looking system packed with features and excellent support via chat and email\u201d\n\nLG logo\n\nEverything is good, SMS service is working well and everything is brilliant. My Korean bosses are so chuffed with the service they have decided to roll the service out worldwide, if it\u2019s ok by you I will forward everyone your details and get you a load more work.\n\n\u2014\u00a0LG Electronics\nKingston University logo\nI have had a great experience with FastSMS. Aimee Ward has been a fabulous contact, she promptly replies to all my Emails and the service always runs smoothly and efficiently. They are polite and really helpful. I would highly recommend this service to anyone who needs a fast reliable SMS service! Big thanks to FastSMS and especially Aimee Ward for her help and great customer service!\n\u2014\u00a0Kingston University London\nMoto logo\nMoto has been using fastsms for over a year & our business relies on it to keep our national network of motorway service areas securely updated with urgent messages & updates. It\u2019s enabled us to send the same message to hundreds of people around the UK at the same time; something that was impossible before. FastSMS has totally changed the way we communicate and the feedback from our employees has been excellent.\n\u2014\u00a0Moto Motorway Services\nTalkTalk logo\nFastSMS offer great value for money and the service is incredibly robust (100% availability thus far) and ultra resilient. Customer service is excellent and the members of staff that I interact with on a regular basis in order to replenish credits are always polite, courteous and willing to go that extra mile for you. A truly superb service and one that I would thoroughly recommend to other businesses who do not want to absorb the cost of running and maintaining their own SMS gateway.\n\u2014\u00a0TalkTalk Group\nLightwater cleaning\nI would like to take this opportunity and thank you for your support and help. FastSMS has been a blessing and helped our company in so many ways. As you are aware we are a growing cleaning business. We have jobs coming in all the time and we need to allocate these jobs to our cleaners. In the past we were manually calling each cleaner, seeing if they were available for the job. This wasn\u2019t working for the company and highlighted issues with time management on more pressing issues. Now, with the help and support of FastSMS, we are able to send out group messages to our cleaners advising them of new jobs. This then, in turn, saves us more time to focus on other things so we can maintain a high standard of customer service and deal with the more pressing issues.We, as a company would highly recommend you and your services to others.\n\u2014\u00a0Lightwater Cleaning\nThe Pulse\n\nI just wanted to drop you a quick note to thank you for your help in setting up the text messaging service, your personal support and advice made it really easy.\n\nThe system is fantastic, not only have we used the Responder service to promote The Pulse we have also used it to supply e tickets to the young people for our gig. It is the perfect media for us, our project is aimed at young people aged between 12 and 18 years, most of whom have a mobile phone, therefore it is the ideal way to communicate the range of activities available to them. The system itself is incredibly easy to manage, even for a non techie, like me! We continually add new activities to our programme and can update the Responder service within a few seconds. It has definitely had a positive impact on The Pulse, even at this early stage, and I would highly recommend your service to other organisations.\n\n\u2014\u00a0The Pulse\nSt Johns Ambulance\nWe used FastSMS for the first time at the 2003 Notting Hill Carnival. It was vital to be able to co-ordinate all of our volunteers on the day in the midst of over 500,000 revellers. FastSMS provided & continues to provide everything that we require.\n\u2014\u00a0St Johns Ambulance\nEngland & Wales mountain rescue\n\nFastSMS allows us to inform our volunteers much more quickly & co-ordinate rescues easily. We undertake various rescues from helping young people that are lost or those that have been caught in adverse weather conditions, through to climbers that have broken bones. We are extremely pleased that fastsms makes our job even more successful.\n\n\u2014\u00a0England & Wales Mountain Rescue\nLike any company we don\u2019t like to spend money. However investing in fastsms has been the most successful marketing campaign in the last three years. It creates the word of mouth buzz that is vital. We would thoroughly recommend fastsms on their superb customer service and technical proficiency.\n\u2014\u00a0Urban Strides\nInternational Fire Chiefs Association logo\nThere are 58 Fire Brigades in the UK & we have 188 principal management officers who need to quickly receive information & news regarding important issues. FastSMS does this & it has been really well received by our members.\n\u2014\u00a0International Fire Chiefs Association\nCatalyst Housing Group\n\nFastSMS has proved to be an extremely effective way for us to market our properties to key workers and has assisted greatly in maximising our sales.\n\n\u2014\u00a0Catalyst Housing Group",

Melrose Title provides all of its clients with high-quality solutions and excellent customer service. Here is what a few of our clients have to say about their experiences working with Melrose Title Company:\n\nchastin stinnett\u201cThere\u2019s so much that goes into buying and selling a home!\n\nSo when it comes to bringing it all together, I trust Melrose Title.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Chastin Stinnett, Real Estate Professional\n\ne9cb78b9-0ed3-4f2f-857a-84978586b8ca\u201cWhen things are easy, any title company can do. BUT\u2026.when things are in the mud, buyers are closing in two days, and sellers are moving, I stick with Melrose Title. They iron out the rough spots. I hope your closings are always smooth, but when the going gets tough, the tough get going.\n\np.s. Melrose Title Company can do easy ones too!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jim Ford, Real Estate Professional with the West Office of Coldwell Banker Wallace & Wallace, Realtors\n\nsahel\u201cMelrose Title has been a closing title of choice for many of my clients. The team at Melrose Title provides the level of customer service and expertise that I look for in a title company in order to ensure a successful closing. I rely on them for added information in my day to day job and I\u2019m happy to know they are always there for me and my clients. Thank you Melrose Title for many happy closings lately!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sahel Naimy, Real Estate Professional with the Farragut Office of Coldwell Banker Wallace & Wallace, Realtors\n\nTerry Ford new\u201cMy closings always go smooth when my buyers take my suggestion and use Melrose Title. The Melrose Title team always goes over and beyond what is expected. They\u2019re always just a call away to answer questions and obtain restrictions whether it pertains to a closing or not. Unlike some closing agents, the closers at Melrose take the time to explain the documents to my clients and welcome questions which is so important when working with first time home buyers. Their communication is great, keeping me informed during the process and they have also been very accommodating. I can also expect a friendly smile and a few laughs when I visit these ladies. Melrose Title Company gives exceptional service or they wouldn\u2019t be doing my next five scheduled closings.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Terry Ford, Real Estate Professional with the North Office of Coldwell Banker Wallace & Wallace, Realtors\n\n\u201cI highly recommend Melrose Title, the staff is top notch and they work incredibly hard to make sure every closing is a smooth process. My clients love them! \u201c\n\n\u2014 Nelson \u201cJoe\u201d Consumo, Real Estate Professional\n\nRegina Santore\n\n\u201cThe team at Melrose Title Company is the best! The thing that impresses me most is how quickly they start the title process for your transaction. Many companies will wait until the last minute, which can lead to a delayed closing if any issue arises. At Melrose Title you will know right away if there\u2019s something that needs correcting, so there\u2019s plenty of time for them to get it done so the closing happens when it should. And you always get service with a smile! It\u2019s clear they care about everyone having a great experience on the big day. \u201c\n\n\u2014 Regina Santore, Real Estate Professional with the Bearden Office of Coldwell Banker Wallace & Wallace, Realtors\n\nScott Felske\n\n\u201cThe folks at Melrose Title closed many transactions for my clients last year and I am very comfortable recommending them.\n\nMelrose Title offers a truly positive experience for my clients. Closing day is always a pleasure, and customers walk away feeling important and confident. The staff at Melrose Title are true professionals that care about their customers and the agents that represent them!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Scott Felske, Real Estate Professional with Realty Executives",

We publish Illinois Country Living magazine, a monthly magazine with a circulation of 176,000. Les has been a very dependable correspondent for us in southern Illinois.\n\nHis writing skill was evident with the first article he submitted. But what really impressed us was his overall professionalism. He is thorough in his research, very responsive to deadlines, persistent without being pushy, and responds well to any suggestions or requests. The first draft he submits is always very clean. As an editor I really appreciate that attention to detail. Les is dependable as well as a gifted writer.\u201d\n\nJohn Lowrey, Editor\nIllinois Country Living\n\n\u201cLes is the consummate professional. I can depend on Les to be responsive, prepared and on time with deadlines; all the while understanding and capturing the nuances of writing clear, compelling copy.

One Platform. Connecting app developers & media companies with all advertising demand.\n\n  1. 1.0 Offers: 1Payout: 1Support: 1\n    Payed for an offer which my reward never came through, spent 2 weeks sending over 20 screenshots before they accepted my proof and then told me to wait two weeks, has been over a month now and keep getting the same response telling me to keep waiting and have patience, have contacted the company of who I made the purchase with and they told me they confirmed the offer over 3 weeks ago of which Fyber will not make a response.\n    1.3 Offers: 2Payout: 1Support: 1\n    I completed some Fyber offers, they never paid our or even bothered to reply to my tickets besides the initial auto-response. SCAM\n    1.0 Offers: 1Payout: 1Support: 1\n    Twice I've completed big offers in a game called Racing Rivals.\n\n    Both offers came to a total of 20k gems which is around \u00a3180-\u00a3190 pounds worth. I've been back and forth through emails and sent every piece of evidence they've asked for to complete the offer. After about a week of bs emails and sending them everything they asked for, they finally told me that they wouldn't pay up and that they contacted iqoption saying the offer wasn't completed. Lying straight away because I contacted iqoption and they confirmed that I completed the offer.. So here I am leaving a bad review of the company where we I can.\n\n    I also luckily managed to get refunded by my bank.\n    Fyber Payment Proof Review\n    1.3 Offers: 2Payout: 1Support: 1\n    I am rarely rewarded diamonds after fulfilling offer requirements. Maybe 2 out of 10 offers. If you file a report you get a tag saying an email has been sent to your address. I have NEVER received an email in my inbox or my spam folder. So I have no way of communicating with them about the lack of diamonds received. Absolutely horrible service! Hoping the game I play will switch to a different service soon. One that will actually deliver what it promises.\n    1.3 Offers: 2Payout: 1Support: 1\n    Only had bad experiences with Fyber. 90% of their offers do not pay out. Reporting diamonds not rewarded and actually receiving them is an utterly frustrating process. Fyber demands proof, very often proof that does not exist (such as confirmation emails) and will make you jump through hoops and then tell you the 20 screenshots you provided are still not enough proof. Thus not paying out. Sometimes they sent an email saying diamonds will be rewarded within a couple of hours, yet they aren\u2019t. Absolutely horrified by the way this company treats people. Needs to be shut down ASAP. Criminals they are.\n    4.3 Offers: 5Payout: 4Support: 4\n    Video ads are the best feature of Fyber. They understand that our mobile app users don't want to sit forever waiting for a video ad to load. They just load faster with Fyber.\n\nWrite a Review for Fyber\n\n\nFind Network\n\nFollow Us\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n5.0Affcredit - Arvind Bhagat\n\naffcredit is a pretty good network, the platform is completely different from the others .payments are always on time.
