Shehu, MI Garba, DD Sayi, SU Umar, Yekeen Salami, and Sunday Maku.\n\nWhile the names of the newly promoted CCs include: O Kalu, JI Dagwa, MA Jatau, EA Asaniyan, RN Monyei, TD Sifawa, SO Adepoju, U Wihioka, P Olaye, KM Kabo, R Ogom, and S Akinyemi.\n\nAccording to Kazeem, the Chairman of the FRSC board, Barrister Bukhari Bello, expressed his satisfaction at the transparency of the exercise and urged the newly promoted staff to put in more efforts in ensuring that the highways are safe for all categories of road users.\n\nKazeem added that the Corps Marshal, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, equally congratulated the newly promoted Officers for their performances. He stated that Oyeyemi encouraged them to continually put in their best in the course of their duties.\n\nThe Corps Marshal promised to continue to improve the welfare of the Corps\u2019 personnel in general to the satisfaction of all. He advised those who did not get promoted to keep faith and hope for the best in the next exercise.\n\nSouthern city\n\nFRSC, Guinness advise truck owners on safety\n\nAS part of efforts to address road crashes, the Federal Road Safety Corps has called on truck owners and fleet operators to carry out adequate routine checks on their drivers and vehicles before deployment.\n\n\u00a0The Edo State Sector Commander, Mr Anthony Oko, stated this at a training organised for 600 truck drivers by Guinness Nigeria Plc, during its transport and safety week.\n\n\u00a0Oko, who was represented by the sector\u2019s Head of Operations, Emea Orji, noted that the attitude of some truck drivers to safety on the highways had continued to be a major challenge for the agency.\n\nHe also urged drivers to create time to assess their state of health, including eye tests to prevent accidents.\n\nThe sector commander said, \u201cWe had an incident this morning (Wednesday) around First East Circular junction, Benin. A truck, as it was turning, landed on a jeep. It (truck) was just on top of the jeep; in fact, it was God that saved the driver.\n\n\u00a0\u201cSo, we preach safety for the vehicles and also for the drivers. The drivers should be exposed to how they can adequately manage their health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0The Supply Chain Director of the company, Hanna Colman, said the Safety Week was designed to ensure that the company\u2019s transport operations were executed with smart, alert, focused and educated drivers, through its third-party contractors.\n\nColman, who was represented by the Site Director of the Benin brewery, Adebayo Alli, added, \u201cWe have taken safety in our operational environment very far. We have moved from a baseline to almost mastery, when it comes to safety in the operational world.\n\n\u00a0Also speaking, the Manager, Logistics and Customer Safety, Adebayo Oluwafemi, stated that the company had zero tolerance for poor road safety standards by its contractors and would not hesitate to sanction offenders.\n\n\u00a0Oluwafemi said, \u201cWe have had transporters that have been suspended from our fleet because of the importance we place on human life.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He was flagged down for not wearing his seat belt and in an attempt to escape, he collided with our operational vehicle.\n\n\u201cImmediately it happened, the reckless driver went to the nearby Akim Police Station to ensure that his vehicle was not towed to our yard. We had already booked him for seat belt use violation, dangerous driving and assaulting regular marshals.\n\n\u201cBut before we knew what was happening, the matter was immediately transferred from Akim Police Station to the Zone Six Command. In less than 24 hours, my men were invited to the command where they were detained for over 10 hours for no just cause.\n\n\u201cOur lawyers went there, but they insisted that we should come and sign a bail bond. These men were detained with their uniforms and this is disturbing.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in charge of Zone Six Command, Mr Abeng Oyom, said the driver of the BMW had come to lodge a complaint that his car was damaged by FRSC operational vehicle driven by an official.\n\nHe, however, denied the claims that the FRSC officials were detained.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe complainant had come to lodge a complaint that his vehicle was damaged by FRSC operational vehicle.\n\n\u201cHe complained to the state traffic unit, but was not pleased with the way the matter was being handled. That was why we took it over. The FRSC officials were not detained.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\nAll rights reserved.
