        "text":"What is reasonable care in the context of IR35 & Off-Payroll?\n\n\nThe Off-Payroll legislation places particular emphasis on \u2018reasonable care\u2019, which will then determine whether the client or agency is liable for any unpaid taxes in situations where HMRC succeed in challenging an \u201coutside IR35\u201d determination at a tax tribunal.\n\nThe fact that reasonable care has been taken needs to be demonstrated through the provision of a valid Status Determination Statement (\u201cSDS\u201d), which must also contain reasons for the determination, as per section 61NA(1)(a) of the legislation.\n\nThe requirement for a valid SDS is not met if the hiring firm fails to take \u2018reasonable care\u2019 in reaching its conclusion, in which case they assume the role of \u2018fee-payer\u2019, section 61NA(2), meaning if HMRC later investigates then the client will be liable for any unpaid taxes.\n\nHow likely is the risk for clients and agencies?\n\nAgencies only become exposed to future tax risk if:\n\n  1. The client has taken reasonable care and passed them a valid Status Determination Statement (see section 61N(5)) stating \u201coutside IR35\u201d\n  2. HMRC opens an enquiry, concludes reasonable care was taken, but disagrees with the status outcome\n  3. A tax tribunal agrees with HMRC, against the backdrop of all other parties and witnesses to the case providing evidence to the contrary.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s worth noting that legally there is no obligation for the client to pass an outside SDS to the agency, and if the client doesn\u2019t do so, it retains the tax risk.\n\nSecondly, if the client has used a reputable compliance-led provider to assess and manage ongoing status then it\u2019s highly unlikely the determination is wrong. HMRC\u2019s motivation to try and overturn the status will be small \u2013 especially as there may be much easier pickings elsewhere in the market.\n\nThirdly, HMRC have lost the majority of IR35 cases in the last 20 years in a period when the supply chain has taken a lackadaisical approach to IR35. Given all parties in the supply chain are now tightening up contractual paperwork and practices, this makes HMRC\u2019s challenge even harder.\n\nTaking account of the above, HMRC\u2019s chances of ascending this mount improbable are miniscule, and agencies should be careful not to succumb to firms selling wares based on unsubstantiated fear.\n\nWhat is \u2018reasonable care\u2019?\n\nAlthough there isn\u2019t a legal definition of reasonable care within tax legislation, it is a well-established principle in case law, and an examination of past tribunal cases provide some clarity.\n\nAn example is found in the First-tier Tribunal in Anderson (deceased) (TC206), where the Judge argued: \u201cThe test to be applied, in my view, is to consider what a reasonable taxpayer, exercising reasonable diligence in the completion and submission of the return, would have done.\u201d\n\nReasonable care is based on the law of tort, and essentially means not being negligent when giving advice or choosing whom to take it from. Suffice to say, a knowledgeable person taking advice from a fool won\u2019t have demonstrated reasonable care, and ignorance is not a reliable defence in tax tribunals. Taking advice from a firm with a proven reputation will satisfy reasonable care and also provides you with a legal backstop if they give poor advice.\n\nHMRC has also published some useful guidance to help firms understand what is expected of them, which includes:\n\n  \u2022 Taking care to seek \u2018appropriate advice\u2019 to ensure correct tax treatment\n  \u2022 Conducting thorough status assessments and preserving detailed records\n  \u2022 Continuing to monitor the status of contractors throughout each engagement\n\nThis imposes a responsibility upon hiring firms to make informed decisions regarding compliance, which requires an understanding of the legislation. Our book, IR35 & Off-Payroll \u2013 explained details everything stakeholders need to know, with chapters dedicated to assisting hirers and agencies in overcoming their compliance challenges.\n\nThe HMRC guidance also outlines the characteristics that firms should look for in their chosen compliance service. In addition to facilitating detailed record keeping and ongoing monitoring, firms will need to demonstrate that they have taken appropriate and prudent advice. Consequently, firms that enlist pop-up IR35 experts with no prior demonstrable experience are more likely to fall short of satisfying the reasonable care requirement.\n\nExample of reasonable care\n\nLet\u2019s suppose you are an aspiring James Bond, 007 secret agent, and are about to be sent on a secret mission, working with a team of international agents to infiltrate a secret lair and bring to justice Baron Samedi (he\u2019s the baddie in \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d).\n\nTiming is going to be essential, but Government cutbacks mean \u201cQ\u2019s\u201d department (he\u2019s the one who makes all the gadgets) is no longer available. And, we are in Covid-19 lockdown so all shops are shut, so instead you decide to go online to buy yourself a reliable timepiece, with an inbuilt circular saw (you need to see the movie to get this).\n\nYou ask two friends for advice on where to shop. Zaman says to use ProperWatches.co.uk and Horatius recommends CheapFakeWatches.com.\n\nThe mission is in full swing, but you get caught, and find yourself tied up hanging over a tank full of sharks. Time to active the watch saw. It fails (we go off-script), and whilst you escape the shark tank you sustain terrible injuries from shark bites and return home. You then decide to litigate for negligence due to the failing watch.\n\nTo establish where the negligence may sit, we need to know how much you, Zaman, Horatius and the websites know about watches.\n\nSuffice to say, had you done your due diligence you would have spoken to Zaman, gone to ProperWatches.co.uk, and the circular saw would have worked and the script would not have been departed from and therefore no reason to litigate.\n\nBut, had you been lazy, not done your due diligence, and taken the advice from Horatius then it\u2019s more likely you would have got bitten. Beware of the sharks.\n\nPrevention is better than cure\n\nAdopting a compliance-led approach is the only way to meet the reasonable care requirement and offer the best protection in the event of an HMRC enquiry.\n\nThe best way clients and agencies can protect themselves from the administrative cost and reputational damage from being involved in incorrect determinations and subsequent litigation by HMRC is to play their part in the IR35 compliance process.\n\nYou certainly don\u2019t want your firms reputation being dragged through a tax tribunal, even if you win.\n\nAs the saying goes, \u201cprevention is better than cure.\u201d\n\nIR35 Shield\n\nIR35 Shield is the cloud-driven industry leading IR35 compliance standard for business and individual contractors.",

        "text":"Understanding Inbound VS Outbound Marketing\n\nHave you ever been tasked with producing or updating your company\u2019s marketing strategy? It\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with information and advice \u2014 should you focus on making splashy signage, talking to potential leads at an industry event, or developing an exclusively digital strategy?\n\nFortunately there are two universal marketing concepts that can help you limit your scope: inbound and outbound marketing. These are two of the most common overarching marketing strategies, and they each have distinct applications, benefits and challenges. In this article, we\u2019ll explore an overview of inbound and outbound marketing, give examples of how to apply each strategy, and provide the pros and cons of each method.\n\n\nInbound vs Outbound Marketing\n\nThere are several main differences between inbound and outbound marketing. Outbound marketing involves proactively reaching out to consumers to get them interested in a product. By contrast, inbound marketing centers on creating and distributing content that draws people into your website.\n\nOutbound marketing typically has a more aggressive, wide-sweeping approach, with the expectation that at least some people will convert. Inbound marketing is usually more subtle and focuses on convincing a particular group of individuals to make a purchase over time. Here are a few other differences at a glance:\n\n\nInbound Marketing\n\nOutbound Marketing\n\n  \u2022 Informative digital content targeted at specific audiences, written to help solve consumers\u2019 problems\n\n  \u2022 Content comes in interactive forms, such as social media posts, blogs, reports, webinars, etc.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Messaging is tailored to specific consumers\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 All-encompassing strategy across multiple channels\n\n  \u2022 Measurable through digital marketing software\n\n  \u2022 Non-digital content designed to capture any consumer\u2019s attention and written to sell products\n\n  \u2022 Content is displayed in direct mail, magazine ads, billboards, on TV, etc. and is meant to be passive\n\n  \u2022 Messaging must stand out among millions of other ads consumers see each day\n\n  \u2022 Linear strategy with limited channels\n\n  \u2022 Difficult to measure attribution from physical advertising\n\n\nInbound Marketing\n\nInbound marketing is focused on attracting customers to your products and services. Your best prospects are searching for products online \u2014 up to 63% of consumers begin their shopping journey online. They begin by searching for products, services, or content to fulfill a need or solve a problem. As such, your content should explain how your products or services will resolve their issues, answer key questions in their niche industry, or satisfy their needs.\n\nThere are many ways to do this, including blogs, video content, guidebooks, and more. Each of these content pieces can also serve as a way to differentiate your product from the competition. Embed product comparisons, amazing testimonials, competitive pricing, and outstanding reviews into your podcast, social media posts, or reports. Keep in mind that prospective customers should receive thoughtful content at various points throughout their buying journey that is varied in material but consistent in messaging.\n\nLet\u2019s say a customer is looking for a new marketing software. First, they may type \u201cbest marketing tool\u201d into a search engine to explore the landscape. The first organic result will be a blog outlining the top 10 marketing platforms in a clear, unbiased way. After reading the blog post, they might want to learn more about digital marketing.\n\nConveniently, the end of the blog has a link to encourage them to sign up for an upcoming webinar to learn more about a new digital marketing strategy. They click the link, then enter their name and email address to access the content. The site stores their contact information and tracks whether or not they attend the webinar.\n\nOnce they attend the webinar, they might wonder if any companies successfully implemented the strategy that was discussed. Right on cue, the vendor will send them a follow-up email containing case studies that show how one of their competitors effectively used digital marketing to achieve a huge ROI. This prompts them to request a demo with a sales representative. They go into the sales call already interested in (and educated on) what the software does, providing you with an easier sell.\n\nThe Benefits of Inbound Marketing\n\nThere are several benefits to inbound marketing that can help you determine if it\u2019s the right strategy for your company:\n\n  \u2022 Inbound marketing is non-invasive \u2014 prospects can read your blog posts or attend a webinar on their own time.\n  \u2022 Inbound marketing content is educational \u2014 it\u2019s specifically designed for each stage in the sales funnel.\n  \u2022 Inbound marketing is quantifiable \u4e00 you can tie each part of your strategy to a metric that gets monitored over time.\n  \u2022 Your website and content are continuously being updated, so Inbound marketing continues drawing in qualified leads over time.\n\nThe Challenges of Inbound Marketing\n\nOf course, inbound marketing isn\u2019t for every company. There are some drawbacks to focusing on digital content:\n\n  \u2022 Inbound marketing requires continuous maintenance, to ensure that content always speaks to consumers\u2019 evolving wants and needs.\n  \u2022 Inbound marketers spend a great deal of time and effort developing and testing out different content that will entice customers to convert.\n  \u2022 Inbound marketing demands a holistic strategy, meaning you\u2019ll need to buy tools to help you implement integrated, cross-channel campaigns.\n\n\nOutbound Marketing\n\nOutbound marketing sends a message to a massive amount of people in the hopes of making a sale. This strategy is rooted in the thought that the larger the group you message to, the larger the return. Outbound marketing is often associated with traditional marketing, like direct mail, events, billboards, cold calling, newspapers, and radio. However, outbound marketing can also be applied to more modern technology, like pay-per-click advertising and spam emails.\n\nFrequently, consumers are not even aware of or looking for the product that\u2019s being advertised. Prospects could be watching TV or perusing a website and be interrupted by an ad illustrating why they should buy a certain product.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s say a customer is driving on the highway and sees a billboard for a furniture store in the area. They might briefly think that they really should invest in a new couch, but they keep that in the back of their mind. A few weeks later, as they watch the local news, they see a commercial for the same furniture store. Again, they think about buying a sofa, but forget after the news comes back on.\n\nThree months later, they check their mailbox and find a discount coupon for the furniture store. As it happens, they just received a bonus at work. Finally, they decide to go ahead and buy that new couch. None of the ads referred to a sofa, and they weren\u2019t necessarily looking to buy a sofa right away. Nevertheless, ads kept popping up in their everyday life, so they ended up shifting their attention to a need that wasn\u2019t top of mind.\n\nThe Benefits of Outbound Marketing\n\nOutbound marketing has a few perks that should not be overlooked:\n\n  \u2022 Outbound marketing promotes brand awareness, helping you reach people who haven\u2019t heard of your products or services before.\n  \u2022 Outbound marketing can yield immediate results \u4e00 people interested in your products and services are likely to take action on your ads and make a purchase.\n  \u2022 Consumers are accustomed to outbound marketing \u4e00 they know that there will be ads in the Sunday paper or on TV and may trust those ads more than the ones presented to them on newer technology\u00a0\n\nThe Challenges of Outbound Marketing\n\nOutbound marketing can be difficult to get right. Here are some disadvantages to going the outbound marketing route:\n\n  \u2022 It\u2019s difficult to make outbound marketing appealing and relevant to everyone, so outbound marketing is more generalized.\n  \u2022 It\u2019s easy for consumers to tune out outbound marketing \u4e00 many people mute the TV during commercials or immediately throw out or recycle their junk mail.\n  \u2022 It\u2019s challenging to measure the effectiveness of some outbound marketing strategies like billboards.\n  \u2022 Outbound marketing is costly, traveling to trade shows, paying for banner ads, and purchasing billboard spaces add up.\n\nOverall, outbound marketing is all about sending a message at scale, while inbound marketing has a very targeted approach. The likelihood that at least some people will convert from your outbound marketing efforts is high, but it is often associated with a high acquisition cost. Rather than shouting your product\u2019s name from the rooftops and hoping that a few people respond, inbound marketing content can be finely tuned to appeal to your best-fit prospects.\n\n\nGet started on your inbound or outbound marketing strategy\n\nNo matter your marketing strategy, you need a way to keep up with the constantly changing marketing landscape.

        "text":"Lease Tax\n\nThe term, lease tax, in car leasing usually refers to sales tax and how the tax is applied to a lease.\n\nThe way that sales tax is applied to car leases varies by state. The most common way, and the way it\u2019s done in most states, is that sales tax is applied to the monthly payment, not the entire value of the vehicle. This is one of the benefits of leasing.\n\nUsing this method, as an example, if your lease payment was $300 a month and your local sales tax rate was 6.0%, your total monthly payment would be $300 + $18 = $318 a month.\n\nIf your make a down payment (cap cost reduction) at the beginning of your lease, you pay sales tax on that down payment amount, at your local rate.\n\nSome states do it differently. For example, in New York, you pay the sales tax up front in cash (or roll it into your lease) based on the sum of your lease payments. In some other states, the tax is due up front but is based on the price of the car, just as if you had purchased the car. If you are not sure how it\u2019s done in your state, consult your state web site, or ask a local car dealer.\n\nFor more details, see Car Lease Taxes and Fees.\n\n\nadminLease Tax",

        "text":"Open main menu\n\nA chief technology officer (CTO), sometimes known as a chief technical officer or chief technologist, is an executive-level position in a company or other entity whose occupation is focused on scientific and technological issues within an organization.[1]\n\n\n\nAfter World War II, large corporations established research laboratories at locations separate from their headquarters. Their goal was to hire scientists and offer them facilities to research on behalf of the company without the burdens of day-to-day office work.\n\nAt that time, the director of the laboratory was a corporate vice president who did not participate in the company\u2019s corporate decisions. Instead, this technical director was responsible for attracting new scientists, do research, and develop products.[2]\n\nIn the 1980s, the role of these research directors changed substantially. Since technology was becoming a substantial part of most products and services, companies needed an operational executive who could understand the product\u2019s technical side and provide advice on ways to improve and develop it.[3]\n\n\nA CTO \"examines the short and long term needs of an organization, and utilizes capital to make investments designed to help the organization reach its objectives... [the CTO] is the highest technology executive position within a company and leads the technology or engineering department\".[4] The role became prominent with the ascent of the information technology (IT) industry, but has since become prevalent in technology-based industries of all types\u2014including computer based technologies (such as game developer, e-commerce, and social networking service) and other\/non-computer-focused technology (such as biotech\/pharma, defense, and automotive). In non-technical organizations as a corporate officer position, the CTO typically reports directly to the chief information officer (CIO) and is primarily concerned with long-term and \"big picture\" issues (while still having deep technical knowledge of the relevant field). In technology-focused organizations, the CIO and CTO positions can be at the same level, with the CIO focused on the information technology and the CTO focused on the core company and other supporting technologies.\n\nDepending on company structure and hierarchy, there may also be positions such as R&D manager, director of R&D and vice president of engineering whom the CTO interacts with or oversees. The CTO also needs a working familiarity with regulatory (e.g. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Consumer Product Safety Commission, as applicable) and intellectual property (IP) issues (e.g. patents, trade secrets, license contracts), and an ability to interface with legal counsel to incorporate those considerations into strategic planning and inter-company negotiations.\n\nIn many older industries (whose existence may predate IT automation) such as manufacturing, shipping or banking, an executive role of the CTO would often arise out of the process of automating existing activities; in these cases, any CTO-like role would only emerge if and when efforts would be made to develop truly novel technologies (either for facilitating internal operations or for enhancing products\/services being provided), perhaps through \"intrapreneuring\".\n\nSee alsoEdit\n\n\n  1. ^ Smith, Roger D.

        "text":"Gross National Income (GNI)\n\n\nDEFINITION of 'Gross National Income (GNI)'\n\nThe sum of a nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) plus net income received from overseas. Gross national income (GNI) is defined as the sum of value added by all producers who are residents in a nation, plus any product taxes (minus subsidies) not included in output, plus income received from abroad such as employee compensation and property income. GNI measures income received by a country both domestically and from overseas. In this respect, GNI is quite similar to Gross National Product (GNP), which measures output from the citizens and companies of a particular nation, regardless of whether they are located within its boundaries or overseas.\n\n\nFor most nations there is little difference between GDP and GNI, since the difference between income received by the country versus payments made to the rest of the world is not significant, as the income flows tend to balance each other out. For instance, GNI for the U.S. in 2011 was only about 1.5% higher than GDP.\n\nBut GNI can be well below GDP in the case of a nation such as Ireland, since large-scale repatriation of profits from foreign companies located there far exceeds income flows from overseas. Ireland\u2019s GNI was 20% below its GDP in 2011, which means that although Ireland attracts substantial foreign investment that contributes to its economic growth, a big chunk of the profits arising from such foreign investment does not remain in the nation. In this case, GNI may be a better indicator of Ireland\u2019s economic performance than GDP, since the latter overstates the strength of the Irish economy.\n\nTo convert a nation\u2019s GDP to GNI, three terms need to be added to the former: 1)\u00a0net compensation receipts, 2) net property income receivable and 3) net taxes (minus subsidies) receivable on production and imports. Let\u2019s use Canada\u2019s 2010 GDP and GNI numbers to understand the reconciliation between these two measures of economic output.\n\n  \u2022 Canada\u2019s GDP in 2010 = $1,624.6 million (~ $1.62 billion)\n  \u2022 Net compensation receipts = 0\n  \u2022 Net property income receivable = -$28.2 million (note the negative sign)\n  \u2022 Net taxes = 0\n  \u2022 Canada\u2019s 2010 GNI = $1,624.6 + (-28.2) = $1,596.4 million (~$1.60 billion)\n  1.
