        "text":"Sunday, April 6, 2014\n\nRevisiting Texas's Electrical Power Predicament\u2014Part 3\n\nI hadn't intended there to be a part 3\u2014but I would like to share three interesting pieces of news that nicely fit in with some themes of this series, and, I have a bit of free time on my hands this weekend to write about it.\n\nThe Bankruptcy and Restructuring\/Breakup of Energy Future Holdings\n\nEnergy Future Holdings, Texas's largest power provider, came into existence in 2007 with a $45-48 billion leveraged buyout of TXU Corporation, as brokered by the likes of KKR, TPG and Goldman Sacks.\u00a0 Overvaluation of TXU's assets, especially in the face of the subsequent economic depression of 2008 and continued low energy prices (thanks to the fracking boom), has made it impossible for EFH to repay the increasing debt burden associated with the LBO, and now, bankruptcy looks inevitable (see, Greed doomed the TXU buyout).\u00a0 The recent departure of KKR CEO, Marc Lipschultz, for the Board of Directors of EFH probably signals a likely Chapter 11 restructuring of EFH's assets.\n\nEFH is the parent of three subsidiaries: Oncor, which handles electricity transmission to 3 million customers, TXU energy, the states' largest electricity retailer, and Luminant, which generates about 18 percent of Texas' electricity, at least in the summer months.\u00a0 Both Oncor and TXU energy look economically viable, and therefore, are attractive subsidiaries to buy.\u00a0\n\nAs I wrote in Part 2, Luminant owns five of those old coal-fired electricity generating plants, some of which have been getting mothballed during the winter month, and, which are too unprofitable,\u00a0at least a today's energy prices,\u00a0\u00a0to retrofit to comply with the Clean Air Act requirements.\u00a0 Those five plants have a name-plate capacity of about 8000 MW which correspond to about 11-12 percent of Texas power generation capacity at any given time during the summer months.\n\nThere is speculation (In Energy Future Holdings shakeup, size matters) that a restructuring would go easier if the coal-fired plants were to be split off from Luminant's nuclear and natural gas, and, further speculation, that as part of a restructuring, those coal fired plants will not just get mothballed, but torn down.\u00a0 I wonder who would want to buy Luminant if the maintenance or retrofitting these five plants was part of the deal (even a tear down of these plants would be very expensive, I think).\n\nIf the closure of these five plants were to happen, however, then ERCOT's summer power reserve margins would get blown away.\u00a0 For instance, a loss of 8000 MW of power generating capacity would drop ERCOT's previously expected reserve margin from 13.6%, for the summer of 2014, to only 1-2%.\u00a0 Under this scenario, I would expect that that there would be multiple rolling blackouts, and a spike in electricity prices, this summer.\n\nDoes the fate of Texas' coal plants and potential permanent loss of 8000MW of power have ERCOT worried or sounding the alarm?\u00a0\u00a0 Why no, quite the opposite.\n\nERCOT'S Revised Load and Reserve Margin Forecast\nIn a dramatic turn-around from its previous forecast of May 2013,\u00a0Capacity-Demand-Reverse Report for 2013, in January 2014, ERCOT announced peak demand margins going forwards that implies that the possibility of rolling blackouts is remote.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0There is no electrical power predicament after all.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat happened?\n\nInstead of an annual growth rate in peak electricity of 2-3 percent\/year, as predicted by ERCOT last May 2013, ERCOT's new forecast predicts 1.3\u00b10.1 percent\/year demand growth for the next decade.\u00a0 This results in a dramatic increase Texas's expected reserve margin for the next several years.\u00a0\n\nWhat is the reason for this abrupt about-face?\u00a0 ERCOT explains:\n\nIn the past, ERCOT has used weather and economic indicators, such as non-farm employment, to forecast future electric demand. However, the relationship between economic growth and electric demand has changed in recent years. While peak demand growth has slowed to about 1 percent annually, the economic forecasts and non-farm employment statistics used in recent load forecasts have resulted in growth forecast estimates of 2 to 3 percent in the two- to three-year outlook.\n\nThis recent trend implies a less direct correlation between these economic indicators and electric demand than in the past. To address this decoupling, ERCOT staff has developed a new load forecasting model that uses forecasted growth rates in customer accounts, or premises, to project future growth trends in each region served by the ERCOT grid.\n\nIn short, ERCOT's new model assumes a decoupling between electricity demand growth and economic indicators, such as employment, and instead now looks at growth rates in customer accounts or premises to predict future electricity demand.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn a another publication describing this new method of future load forecasting (based on a neural network model) ERCOT presented a figure which I think sums up their reason for adopting a new model (Figure 5):\n\nAs you can see, starting from the mid 1990s, there has been an increased decoupling between electricity demand and GDP.\u00a0 ERCOT attributed this to things like increasing efficiency of electrical devices (think light bulbs), declining energy use per customer and improvement in electricity distribution. \u00a0But maybe there are other reasons as well.\n\nBased on this new model, at the end of February 2014, ERCOT came out with its latest Capacity Demand and Reserves Report (CDR)\u2014the report being released four months earlier than previous in years.\u00a0 In particular, a new Summer Summary prediction for demand, capacity and margins, reproduced in Figure 6 below, reflects the new margin and peak demand estimates.\n\nThe result of the new model is a prediction of much higher reserve margins than previously forecast.\u00a0 For instance, the reserve margin (red) is predicted to actually go up to 15.4% in 2015, and, it doesn't drop below 13% until after 2018.\u00a0 In contrast, the May 2013 CDR (Figure 4) had predicted the 2018 margin to be 9.4%.\u00a0 Notable, 13.75% has long been considered an acceptable target reserve margin by ERCOT.\n\nWith peak demand growth assumed to be 1.3 percent\/year, the Feb 2014 CDR predict a peak power demand (blue) of 71806 MW by 2018, which is ~4400 MW lower than the peak power demand of 76186 MW by 2018, predicted in the May 2013 CDR. \u00a0\n\nMoreover, this increased margin is in spite of the 2018 total power resources being lowered from 80760 MW, as predicted in the May 2013 CDR, to a predicted 79575 MW in the Feb 2014 CDR.\n\nBrattle Group Report (BGR)\nCommissioned by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), this report published at the end of January 2014 attempts to estimate the \"economically optimal reserve margin for ERCOT\u2019s wholesale electric market.\"\n\nThe bottom line of the BGR is that, from an economic perspective, a reserve margin of 13.75% is \"inefficient\" because it is designed to meet a one-day-in-10-year load loss event (0.1 LOLE)\u2014a standard to ensure loss of power, on average, only 1 day in ten years.\u00a0 Instead, the BGR recommends a new reliability standard that would be more \"economically optimal.\"\u00a0 This new standard, termed, \"expected unserved energy\" (EUE) standard, weighs the \"total system\" cost of building more power generation plants to keep the reserve margin high, versus the costs related to a \"scarcity-event.\"\u00a0 The BGR finds that only a 9-11% reserve margin is economically optimal.\u00a0 The report estimates that a 11.5% reserve margin, would be insufficient to meet peak loads only once every three years.\u00a0 On average, a 1600 MW short fall would only need to be curtailed for 2.6 hours on average during such \"load shedding\" event.\n\nInterestingly, this report was shortly followed by a memorandum to ERCOT from PUCT commissioner Anderson questioning the need for PUCT or ERCOT to take any quick action based on this report:\n\nIf the Commission were to adopt a mandatory reserve margin, what Brattle refers to as a \u201creliability based standard,\u201d they recommend the adoption of the \u201cnormalized expected unserved energy\u201d (EUE)6 standard because it considers the magnitude and duration of events among its factors.7 Adopting a EUE approach would constitute a total redesign of ERCOT\u2019s reliability standard, which should not be done without careful evaluation by the Commission and the ERCOT stakeholders. Analyzing the EUE recommendation should be conducted as part of a truly broad and intensive study of the appropriateness of ERCOT\u2019s reliability standard and resulting reserve margin.\n\nThe BGR's assertion that a 10 reserve margin is contrary to the North American Reliability Corporation\u2019s estimate of an acceptable reserve margin of 15 percent\u2014a margin that ERCOT has not been able to attain in the past several years.\n\nSummary and Thoughts\n\nI don't think that it a coincidence that the early publication of ERCOT's Capacity Demand and Reserves Report, and, the publication of Brattle Group Report are being released just as Texas's largest electricity provider, Energy Future Holdings, heads into bankruptcy.\u00a0\n\nThe new Capacity Demand and Reserves Report suggests much a lower rate of demand growth increase, and therefore Texas, can have \"acceptable\" reserve margins of 13.75%\u00a0 for the next several years.\u00a0 Brattle Group Report goes one further in suggesting that this 13.75% margin is way too high and could instead be 10-11% for \"economic optimization.\"\u00a0\n\nLet's just set aside the apparent paradox of ERCOT adopting a new method of predicting demand growth that specifically does not directly consider economic indicators, and, the BGR that specifically recommends lower reserve margins based on \"economic optimization.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTo me these two reports may be setting the stage for a restructuring of Energy Future Holdings where those five coal-fired plants are rapidly phased out of ERCOT's power grid.\u00a0 The ability to eliminate these uneconomical \u00a0coal-fired plants would make the purchase Luminant more attractive.\u00a0\n\nStill, the loss of 8000 MW ...

        "text":"Saturday, December 3, 2016\n\nIt's the calcium stupid!\n\nEarlier this week I attended the Annual Meeting of the Connecticut Pomological Society in Glastonbury, CT. One main reason for going was to hear Jeff Alicandro of agri.assistance, a crop consulting service out of western New York, USA. Jeff by himself is entertaining, but the information he typically espouses is unique to most everything else I see that comes out of traditional channels, i.e. University research, Extension, industry, other consultants, etc. Trust me, at the very least it is very interesting. And often controversial. Did I say entertaining?\n\nAlicandro's talk focused on Honeycrisp, specifically \"Experiences & tips for growing Honeycrisp in the northeast US.\" I particularly liked one of his slides, the \"Honeycrisp 3-Step Executive Summary.\" I suppose you want to know what they are?\n  1. the 3rd most important step for improving Honeycrisp fruit quality is improving calcium nutrition\n  2. the 2nd most important step for improving Honeycrisp production & fruit quality is fine-tuning crop load management\u00a0- including thinning programs, but just as importantly return bloom programs\n  3. and the most important step for improving Honeycrisp production & fruit quality is achieving well-balanced tree vigor - with VERY MODERATE levels of vegetative re-growth in your bearing Honeycrisp orchards\nA few specifics I gleaned, and maybe already knew :-)\n  \u2022 gypsum applied to the ground will improve calcium nutrition, plus it has added benefits; see this handout\n  \u2022 if you are not applying calcium sprays 8-10 times beginning at petal fall, you are not applying enough foliar calcium\n  \u2022 NAA (Fruitone, Pomaxa) and ethephon (Ethrel) sprays during the summer are essential to annual, moderate cropping on Honeycrisp trees; there is some evidence ethephon applied just post-harvest is a big plus\n  \u2022 shoot growth on Honeycrisp should only be 8-10 inches; watch nitrogen application (nitrogen is your enemy and calcium is your friend when it comes to fighting bitter pit); shoots are a big calcium sink, and they will always beat fruit in the battle for calcium uptake\n  \u2022 avoid over-pruning, don't plant Honeycrisp too close together such that they need to be pruned excessively to keep them in place\n  \u2022 Apogee\/Kudos is advised on over-vigorous Honeycrisp trees, and may just in general be advised for reducing shoot growth (hence calcium sink) and fighting fire blight (although Honeycrisp is considered moderately resistant to fire blight)\nWhat's all the fuss about calcium? Well, preventing bitter pit of course. (Among other things, including generally enhancing storage life.) 2016 was a particularly onerous year, with lots of bitter pit showing up on Honeycrisp. Partly, it was the dry weather and light crop loads, but bitter pit minimization is a constant issue with Honeycrisp. So, here is another of Alicandro's handouts for your perusal. Let's all become better managers of Honeycrisp nutrition, crop load management, and tree vigor\/balance to produce better Honeycrisp fruit! (And make more money!)\n\nSunday, June 5, 2016\n\nPrecision chemical apple thinning in MA 2016\n\nWell here we are, post petal-fall\/fruit set\/approaching 3\/4 inch diameter apples, and indeed there has been lots of cold damage to tree fruit here in Massachusetts. No peaches (Happy Valentine's Day) and apples were looking pretty bad (early April freeze) until we finally got out of bloom and saw some fruit setting and sizing. It's not all pretty though, apple orchards in eastern MA generally have fared better than those in the Connecticut\/Pioneer Valley. Fruit set has depended a lot on variety (Macoun looks good, McIntosh intermediate, Cortland not so good, Honeycrisp, well, it depends) and site (obviously). Return bloom was probably not going to be great either given the heavy apple crop last year. When all is said and done, I predict some orchards will have less than 25% of an average crop, some will have greater than 75%, some will be in the middle at 50%. There will be apples, the price will be good, so it will be a good year to have apples (if you have them). Sometimes years with short crops turn out to be more profitable for some. The cup is half full at least.\n\nSo, despite my usual reluctance to measure fruit as they grow per the Precision chemical Thinning Protocol\/predicting fruit set (PTP), and with a little prompting from Poliana Francescatto at Cornell, I went whole hog and set up 7 demonstrations across 3 different orchards (TFF, CSO, and SHO) and 3 different varieties (McIntosh, Gala, and Honeycrisp). But, I cheated a bit, by reducing the number of flower\/fruit spurs used to 10 per tree (vs. 15 per the PTP) in 2 orchards (TFF and CSO), and just 5 spurs per tree in one orchard (SHO). All my results are published here.\n\nSome comments on the process and results:\n\n  \u2022 These were generally nice tall-spindle trees, therefore I felt that using 10 (or as few as 5?) spurs per tree was representative. Wonder if using 10 trees by 5 spurs per tree would be easier and quicker to find numbered spurs within tree? They can be hard to find when foliage fills in.\n  \u2022 Those little string tags blow around and get tangled in other spurs, sometimes making it difficult to figure out which spur was being used. I have used flagging tape in the past, would\n    probably go back to that. (Or something even better? Suggestions?)\n  \u2022 I did not number the individual fruits. After all measurements were taken, the fruits were sorted largest to smallest within each spur, the assumption being the largest fruits remained the largest upon subsequent measurements (ditto for the smallest). Data would have to be sorted in the XLS spreadsheet, there is a little trick to it. (Thanks Poli!) Seems to work OK, but going to add to potential error.\n  \u2022 It may be easy to overestimate the potential crop based on counting flower clusters. I suspect there are many flowers on 1-year-old wood which are not likely to set, yet it can be difficult to discount those.\n  \u2022 Wish there were an easier way to measure fruitlets: do we need to measure to nearest 0.1 mm? Can a template be used to quickly size the fruitlets to the nearest 1 mm (vs. using calipers)?\n  \u2022 It appeared initially, despite expected spur leaf and bud damage from the April freeze, that trees were going to overset actually. Hence, chemical thinner applications commenced, up to 3 applications, and appear to have worked quite well. We will count the fruit on each tree upon final set to see if the PTP worked or not?\n\nI will try to update once final set is counted...",

He noted that, the Sub County in the finacial year 2000\/2009 started a banana plantation as a demonstration site at the sub county premises. The species of banana grown were kitika, gonja,and mpologoma among others.\nIn 2009, the sub county started harvesting bananas from the garden and would sell them at prices ranging from 5000 to 8000shillings a bunch. The money collected was usaully deposited on the Sub County NAADs account and later used to settle other finacial demands in the sector.\nUnfortunately, these good yields have since 2010 been frustrated by banana wilt disease that has since seen all the plants rotting away. Despite the farmers\u2019 efforts to cut down the affected plants, the disease has contiued spreading further and eaten up the whole one hectare banana plantation.\nAccording to Mr. Tibamwenda over 150000 shillings had so far been realized from the sales.\n\nIts worth noting that following the various changes in the implementation of the NAADs project; NAADs phaseI and NAADs phaseII, a number of achievements have been registered ranging from transperancy in the procurement process, and in the selection of benefeciaries as well as enterprises to increased coverage in the number of benefeciaries.\n\nHowever, there is need for the NAADs project to beef up her interventions in addressing crop diseases least the whole project is frustrated by the same.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

The worst of Australias country stealing culture destroyers are high on the hog over in China,but its not all good news.\n    In fact it is becoming a bit tricky for the Chinese leadership because everytime they shift their production focus it ends in over production in that area.\n    So over capacity = over supply.\n    Sooner or later this cold hard fact will have to be realised and China will have to scale back to match true demand.\n    This will be painful for Australia and China.\n    With all the terrible pollution this \"wealth\" has created it is now obvious the dream is broken.\n    Wrong way - go back.\n\n\n    Optimism over iron ore fading fast amid predictions of a surplus\n\n    JUST as market watchers are beginning to fear over-production of iron ore in Australia and Brazil, now we've got others jumping on the bandwagon and threatening to make matters worse still.\n\n    No wonder Morgan Stanley is predicting seaborne iron ore volumes to increase by 9.1 per cent in 2013 and overwhelming what demand is out there. And Bloomberg's survey of iron ore analysts indicates a surplus starting in 2014 and widening each year through to 2018, with prices forecast to drop to $US90 a tonne.\n\n    And, of course, everyone will be looking -- as usual -- to China to do the heavy lifting on the consumption side. Whether that can be achieved is far from certain.\n\n    We already know about the planned expansions by the majors in the Pilbara and by Vale in Brazil. On Friday, Atlas Iron (AGO), Brockman Mining (BCK) and Aurizon Holdings (AJZ) reported they had completed the first stage of their study to build a new rail system in the East Pilbara and port operations at Port Hedland.\n\n    In just the past few days, there have been signals of even more iron ore coming on the market. In the southern Indian state of Karnataka, 19 iron ore mines are due to reopen soon. They were closed by the courts until they improved operating standards, and will return 30 million tonnes a year to Indian supply.\n\n    Peru at present exports about 10 million tonnes of iron ore a year from one mine owned by China's Shougang; that company has announced it will lift output by 460 per cent by 2016. China's Ninjinzhan Group is developing a second Peruvian mine to produce 15 million tonnes a year from 2015.\n\n    And we have Strike Resources (SRK) with its Apurimac iron ore project in Peru aiming to prove up a 500 million tonne resource by the end of the year and then seek development partners.\n\n    Also on Friday, Centaurus Metals (CTM) said it had received a key licence for its Jambreiro iron ore project in southeast Brazil, clearing the way for construction to begin. Meanwhile, investors are losing enthusiasm for the sector. Share prices at Rio Tinto (RIO), BHP Billiton (BHP) , Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) and Atlas have all taken substantial hits.\n\n    Canaccord Genuity's Warwick Grigor says iron ore optimism is fading fast, citing the analyst predictions of a looming surplus.\n\n    Bearish sentiment has grown.\n\n    But there is one iron ore stock bucking the trend. Mamba Minerals in Canada's Labrador Trough which extends from Labrador into northeastern Quebec.\n\n    Back in January, Pure Speculation drew attention to the region which then had already reached 78 billion tonnes of defined resources, has rail lines, cheap hydro power and big money, with players including Wuhan Iron & Steel, Mitsubishi, South Korea's Posco, India's Tata Steel, China Steel and Hebei Iron & Steel partnering projects.\n\n    Last week Hebei, China's largest steelmaker, signed on the dotted line for a 25 per cent stake in the Kami iron ore project in the trough. Mamba's price rose on the news that the first diamond drill hole to test one of its four potential direct shipping ore targets hit 275m of hematite beginning just 15m below surface. DSO indicates high-grade hematite ore that needs only a relatively simple crushing and screening process before it can be exported.\n\n    Mamba's mine is close to an area served by a 565km railway to a port on the St Lawrence Seaway.\n\n    1. Oh dear,Colons dreams will all be in pieces too - this could get sooo messy.\n\n    2. Iron ore prices tumble again\n\n      From: The Australian\n      April 08, 2013 12:00AM\n\n      THE price of iron ore slipped sharply again over the weekend as concern mounted about demand from Asian steel mills.\n\n      Prices fell to $US128 a tonne from $US135.90 at the previous close, according to data compiled by the Steel Index.\n\n    3. Another disaster waiting to happen - Japans debt crisis.\n\n\n      Last week, new BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank would inject about $1.4 trillion into the economy in less than two years..\n\n      The Aussie was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 102.12 yen after rallying to 102.32 yen, its highest since July 2008.\n\n\n      How long can QE and ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) continue while budget deficits add over $1 trillion to the national debt annually?\n\n      Fed policy can't stop now. Eventually, what can't go on forever, won't.\n\n      Global economies everywhere will be impacted. They may be like never before. Recovery will be slow and painful. People who know best say so.\n\n\n      QE doesn't work. It could if properly used. It hasn't been. It's improperly used now. Boosting aggregate demand is needed. Doing so requires putting money in consumers' pockets.\n\n      Fed-style money printing madness doesn't stimulate growth and create jobs. It flows to bank balance sheets. It's used for speculation, high salaries, big bonus, buying competitors, and consolidating to greater size.\n\n      Helicopter Ben dropped lots of money on Wall Street. Doing so sent financial asset prices soaring. None went to Main Street where it belongs.\n\n      Pedal-to-the-metal easing will adversely affect Japan's neighbours.\n\n\n      Economist David Rosenberg calls excessive monetary easing \"no panacea.\" It's \"self-defeating.\" America's seeing diminishing returns.\n\n      What's needed is \"a coherent fiscal policy and the reality that a record 90 million Americans left the labor market entirely, and that 40% of the unemployed ranks have been out of work for over six months.\"\n\n      It's more than double the historic norm.\n\n      Tripling the Fed's balance sheet to $3.2 trillion did little to stimulate growth and create jobs.\n\n\n      Principalis Asset Management's Pippa Malmgren said \"(w)e've never seen such unconventional methods used to create as much inflation as possible.\"\n\n      Monetary and economics Professor Lex Hoogduin called the effects Kuroda's easing \"very difficult to control. At the same time, it will be politically very difficult to put a brake on this process. The policy can derail and can lead to distortions in the Japanese economy.\"\n\n\n      Financial Times columnist Gavyn Davies highlighted the scale of the operation.\n\n      \u201cIn effect,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe new governor \u2026 has imported into Japan the whole of the Federal Reserve\u2019s post-Lehman balance sheet strategy, and he will implement it in under two years, instead of the five or more years taken by the Fed. The doubling in the Japanese monetary base over a period of 21 months is in itself remarkable..\n\n      The decision will have significant international consequences. It effectively blows out of the water the decisions taken at the February meeting of the G7 nations that countries should not undertake currency devaluations in order to improve their position in export markets.\n\n\n      Since last June, the yen has already fallen by 22 percent and 24 percent against the US and Australian dollars respectively. One of the countries being significantly impacted is South Korea..\n\n      Over and above the effect of the decision on the currency wars, the new BoJ policy points to the mounting instability of the international monetary system and the deepening crisis of global capitalism.\n\n      Decisions are now being undertaken which only a few years ago would have been ruled out as creating the conditions for a future financial catastrophe. Such is the state of the global economy that central bankers, once the bastions of financial conservatism, are operating according to the maxim: apr\u00e8s moi le d\u00e9luge.\n\n      (After me the Deluge)\n\n\n      \"This was the whole thing in the 1930s.

        "text":"Bunnings finally takes a\u00a0stand\n\n\nI wrote back in May about Bunnings, their fantastic timber policies, and how it was time for Bunnings to live up to those policies when it comes to their support for public native forestry in Australia:\n\n\nWell it seems the time has come:\n\n\nFederal and State Governments refuse to resolve the disaster that is public native forestry in Australia so its time (finally) for the market to take responsibility.\n\nHooray for that!!\n\nHardware chain Bunnings has put VicForests on notice that it must reduce its impact on Victoria\u2019s native forests or risk losing its custom, after the state-owned forestry company failed in its [third] bid to achieve green [FSC] certification.\n\nBunnings needs to also issue this warning to Tasmania\u2019s State-owned forest agency Sustainable Timbers Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\nBunnings is Australia\u2019s largest hardware chain with annual turnover of $11 billion and over 31,000 employees. It is Australia\u2019s largest timber retailer.\n\nBunnings could be about to change the face of the forest industry in Australia and bring the industry into the 21st century.\n\nSo what else could Bunnings do to support a real forest industry in Australia?\n\nThe future of the forest industry in Australia is with profitable private tree growers.\n\nBunnings needs to start talking with farmer groups. There is a long road ahead and many years of neglect to make up, but forestry is about the long term.\n\nSince Bunnings is also in New Zealand they should form a partnership with the New Zealand Farm Forestry Association (NZFFA), and support Kiwi tree growers.\n\nHooray for Bunnings!!!\n\n\nUpon further reflection one has to wonder exactly what is Bunnings hoping to achieve from its warning to Vicforests?\n\nVicforests has now failed to achieve FSC Certification three times!!\n\nWhat possible assurances or changes in behaviour can Vicforests provide that will satisfy Bunnings but failed the Forest Stewardship Council test?\n\nSurely a \u201cthree strikes\u201d result from the FSC should be enough for Bunnings to stop supporting Vicforests.\n\nPublic native forestry in Australia is fundamentally compromised. It cannot achieve suitable environmental, community, political and commercial outcomes all at the same time. That is mission impossible!!\n\nBunnings and the rest of the timber market need to wake up to this fact.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

To do this I set the saw\u00a0twice and cut in two stages.\n\nHorizontal cuts, waste material clearly marked\n\nHorizontal cuts, waste material clearly marked\n\nAfter this\u00a0horizontal cut was made I had to\u00a0make some vertical cuts. Using the\u00a0Re-Saw with a particularly sharp blade and set to the exact right distance the cuts were made. All\u00a0pieces would now fit together with out any further problems.\n\nvirtical cuts for lap joint\n\nvirtical cuts for lap joint\n\nNow that most problems have been resolved\u00a0I have to sit back and work out the order in which all segments go together in regards to construction\u2026\n\nCNC routing Problems\u2026\nJune 9, 2010, 4:49 am\nFiled under: CNC Routing, Materials, Process | Tags: , , , ,\n\nAfter I recieved all of the cut ply, then had them re-cut\u2026 I found further problems.\n\nIt turns out that\u00a0cutting all of the Laminex coated ply was damaging to the bits and as such whent through a handfull of the Companies cutting bits. When each bit became blunt it obviously failed to cut as well\u2026 meaning many\u00a0edges of the laminex were chipped and damaged. This actually wasn\u2019t a huge problem as I had to put a rounded edge on all the pieces anyway due to them being sharp.\n\nI soon realised however, that the small holes at the coners and ends of each piece were alsocut incorrectly\u2026 although I had the drawings and computer design files all correct\u2026 having the holes small (by only 0.1-0.3 of a mm) ment that none of the rod that I had bought would actually fit through them\u2026 a problem as the stainless steel rod only come in certain sizes\u2026,\u00a0I had two options, one of which was to make the steel smaller, through machining and sanding,\u00a0the other,\u00a0to make the holes slightly\u00a0bigger, or in fact the right size\u2026 Another problem was that when the Stainless steel rod was inserted into the routed holes, there was the danger of them chipping the Laminex. To solve this problem I countersunk all of the holes so that the Laminex would stay in\u00a0one piece.\n\nI decided to go with making the holes bigger. To do this i needed a particular drill bit: 8.1 mm in size. I managed to source such a drill bit through an engineering supply shop in Canberra.\n\ncountersinking holes\n\ncountersinking holes\n\nholes re-drilled to correct size\n\nholes re-drilled to correct size\n\n$7.85 and 4 hours later and all holes are drilled back to their actual size\u2026\n\nNext stage is working out how to actually put it all together!\n\nThe CNC cut Materials have arrived\u2026\u00a0however\u2026\nJune 7, 2010, 2:24 pm\nFiled under: CNC Routing, Materials, Process | Tags: , , , ,\n\nAnd so I receive\u00a0a phone call to say that the first half of the\u00a0CNC cut materials are ready to be picked up. However there were some problems with a handful of pieces.\n\nTwo of the large circular pieces were cut incorrectly, damaged and\u00a0needed to be re cut\u2026. meaning that I would need to purchase more material\u2026 at a hefty cost of $274 for the sheet (He offered to cut them for free)\u00a0The two pieces\u00a0that were damaged happened to be two of the face boards for the cabinets\u2026 Seeing as i\u00a0was unable to get the same Laminex\u00a0coated marine ply (as I got it for cheap of our masters student) I had to buy ordinary hoop marine ply, i decided to get the\u00a0three front panels all recut so that they would all match when constructed.\n\nThe reason they were cut incorrectly\u00a0was because I tried to\u00a0cut\u00a0too many\u00a0pieces out of the limited material\u00a0I had (obviously to keep it as cheap as possible) when the pieces were cut though, the ply sheet they were being cut out of lost its\u00a0rigidity and the cutting bit began to wander\u2026 as shown in the pictures.\n\nThe top is not straight!\n\nThey cut this one a little wrong...\n\nAlthough It\u2019s unfortunate\u00a0that there were two pieces cut incorrectly, the problem was solved within 24 hours\u00a0with all pieces collected and ready to be worked on in preparation for construction.\n\nComponents CNC cut and ready for further work...\n\nAlthough, it turns out the CNC cut holes are too small\n\nproblems continue\u2026\n\nMachining process of timber for the six\u00a0draws\u2026\nMay 31, 2010, 3:13 am\nFiled under: Materials, Process | Tags:\n\nNow that I have my CNC routing underway, it is time to move on to more pressing matters\u2026 The material for the draws. I was a bit cloudy when it came to what material I would use to make the draws. I had a limited amount of time, was already looking like the project was going to cost a fortune and I had almost run out of the recycled\/reclaimed old growth Oregon\u2026 After speaking to Rodney for a few short minutes it would be decided tha I would try to use Oregon for everything when it came to the draws\u2026 front, back and sides (although the running edge of the draw would be a harder material such as a high quality pine or Victorian Ash off cuts)\n\nI got into contact with the Timber merchant again and headed out there to find some more Oregan, which I did. The beam that Gordon found for me was one of four and came out of an old RAAF base, (used to hold the roller doors apparently). The beam was covered in lead based paint and sitting in a puddle.\n\nMachining up Orgon\n\nMachining up Orgon on table saw\n\nAfter we cut it in half and machined it up to a respectable state we realised that it was really good timber as it had really tight grain.

I glued them all up in two sets of clamps using tight bond as the glue of choice as it will not expand in to all of the bolt or nails holes like polyurethane glue does.\n\nglue up of Oregan using Tightbond glue\n\nGlue up of Oregan using Tightbond glue\n\nAll of the timber has been machined to within mm of the final dimensions and is being left to sit in the workshop untill I am ready to use it.\n\nOther process continue\u2026\n\nMay 31, 2010, 2:33 am\nFiled under: Images | Tags: ,\n\nI was asked, after several of my friends had viewed my work, what I was actually making\u2026 so I hope these help to clarify\u2026 there will also a perspective drawing added soon\u2026\n\nDrawing of cabinet from side\n\nDrawing of Cabinet set from side, showing detail of slats and screws.\n\nfront view joined\n\ndrawing of front view of cabinets\n\nTop ciew joined\n\nTop view drawing of cabinets\n\nCNC Routing finally\u00a0underway\u2026\nMay 31, 2010, 1:18 am\nFiled under: CNC Routing, Images, Materials, Process | Tags: ,\n\nLaminex sheet 1, file ready for cut\n\nAfter many hours of looking into a computer screen and several days of delays the completed illustrator files were handed over to the CNC routers so that they could start their job. Once the files had been delivered I purchased two sheets of 19 mm Marine ply and arranged them to be delivered directly to the CNC routers the following day at no extra charge. Previously in the week one of the masters students in the workshop came to see me regarding some left over materials he had from a previous project, (2 sheets of 3040\/1220\/20 mm white gloss laminated marine ply) and asked if I would be able to use them. Seeing as I was looking at laminating some segments anyway I decided to take him up on his offer as it would save me many hours of glueing time, and offer him $300\/sheet (they were custom-made at a price near $400 so I saved a worthwhile amount of money)\n\nThe CNC router cutting time is charged at approx $100\/hour, all pieces are cut three times (two major cuts and 1 minor \u2018clean up\u2019 cut). Expected total cost was said not to exceed $600\u2026 I will try to hold them to that if it goes over price, as im sure it will.\u00a0 They should be ready for collection in the next 3 days.\n\nThe total cost of Marine ply and cutting stages of this project will end up being approximately $1800 which sounds like a lot of money\u2026 because it is\u2026 however, it must be kept in mind that I am realistically making 3 cabinets and when looking at it after dividing costs into thirds, $600 for the Marine ply and cutting process per cabinet is actually pretty good.\n\nThe next process will be milling and machining the last off the stainless steel.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to starting construction on the cabinets though, but think im going to have to clear some space\u2026\n\nThe machining process continues\u2026\n\nCNC Routing Process\u2026\nMay 23, 2010, 1:23 pm\nFiled under: CNC Routing, Materials, Process | Tags: , ,\n\nFor the last week or so I have been working on getting the computer designs\u00a0of all the individual pieces that\u00a0I\u00a0need to get CNC routed. This also has come with problems, after I completed the 1st lot of designs and worked all of the multiples of them into the Marine ply sheet size\u2026 the total number of sheets came out to 6 sheets, resulting in about $1600 worth of materials\u2026 I decided to then re-work the design once more to try to\u00a0minimise the amount of material needed\u2026 At the same\u00a0time, another\u00a0masters student in the workshop let me know that he had\u00a02 sheets of 20mm\u00a0white Laminex\u00a0coated marine ply that he had left from a previous project and that I should offer him a price for them.\u00a0His sheets were in fact almost a quarter bigger than ...

        "text":"Monday, March 31, 2008\n\nThanks Nancy and Sabrina!\n\nYour Birthdate: December 5\n\nYou have many talents, and you are great at sharing those talents with others.\n\nMost people would be jealous of your clever intellect, but you're just too likeable to elicit jealousy.\n\nProgressive and original, you're usually thinking up cutting edge ideas.\n\nQuick witted and fast thinking, you have difficulty finding new challenges.\n\nYour strength: Your superhuman brainpower\n\nYour weakness: Your susceptibility to boredom\n\nYour power color: Tangerine\n\nYour power symbol: Ace\n\nYour power month: May\n\nJustalit'l Shasta gives me girls!\n\nThe black smirslet ewe lamb\nAbove and below are the Ag krunet ewe lamb. Thoughts on this one?\n\nShasta gave me two six pound ewe lambs this morning. a black smirslet ewe lamb and an Ag krunet ewe lamb. Her markings are interesting huh? Next up I would have to say would be Cori, but then again I was proven wrong yesterday :)\n\nTotal so far 5 ewe lambs, 1 ram lamb, all sets of twins from mature ewes!\n\nSunday, March 30, 2008\n\nI spoke too soon\n\nWell no matter how i think the lambing order will be, they always mix it up. I brought the girls in early today for their grain mix as I didn't want any lambs outside. I've been watching diligently all day and all night both from in the barn and in the pasture to watch the girls. I jugged Cori and Shasta just in case they'd lamb as their udders are tight and their back ends are swollen with tails sticking out.\n\nAs I was feeding the mixture in the tubs, Maya starts doing that labor thing like Lavender faked last week. I thought to myself \"gee look, now its Maya giving me more halucinating images\". I went to go in the house to tell Rayna that I think Maya is in labor and I go back out and there is a smirslet grey katmoget ewe lamb standing in the center of the pen with Maya cleaning her off!!! I quickly jug her and the babe and she lays down and I went to call Rayna to tell her about the ewe lamb and I walk back to the jug to see her literally cannonball this cute little black krunet ram lamb out! They seem to be much smaller than Chloe's twins but time will tell. I think Jazz is BB BB but it'd be a nice surprise if he was carrying moorit!\n\nPhotos perhaps tomorrow when they are dried off a bit! Lambing has come full force today! WOHOO!!\n\nChristmas II has arrived at White Pine Shetlands!\n\nChloe was one of the first three ewes I thought would lamb. Shasta and Cori are the other ones....\nChloe and her twin EWE lambs out of Jazz, the 87% UK ram out of Jericho. These girls are 59% UK bloodlines.\n\nLight Grey Katmoget ewe lamb. She has tight crimpy fleece!\n\nDark Grey katmoget ewe lamb. Possibly emsket? More wavy fleece but I've seen these fleeces crimp up as they mature.\n\nWell................Now we wait for the next girl to go!! What a way to start off the season! Last year I had twin ewe lambs for my first lambing also! Is this a sign of tradition?! :)\n\nTuesday, March 25, 2008\n\nBOYS will be BOYS\n\nPayDay the scurred boy. He's black....I'm guessing 'warm black\" as his skin fleece is black.\nRolo with PayDay. Rolo keeps getting lighter. He was fawn for sure and is registered as such but perhaps he's going to be a mioget like his daddy Bourbon.\nHeath the moorit. Boy the flash sure wrecks his color. He is the deepest colored moorit I've had to date (which is obviously not long, but most of my moorit girls are more red, versus mahogany)\nHere is Barish the F1 Timothy. He has been rooing for weeks now and he looks ridiculous :) His horns are either super slow to grow or are Tea Cupped or scurred. Juliann, care to gander a guess yet?\n\nWell i've found out I can no longer sit in the pen with the boys. I can only admire them over or through the fence. The \"Napoleon complex\" that all horned male shetlands have has started to get the better of them.\n\nPayDay, Rolo and Jazz are all very friendly. Not obnoxious like the ewes are, but they are polite enough to come to the fence for scratching. Barish and Heath come up to eat out of my hand, but I don't normally have anything so they quickly back up. Hansel refuses to get close at all. That's ok! Different personalities.\n\nI don't like to pet the boys too much, but I've learned if you only have two hands, only have two rams :) The one that gets left out bashes the five gallon pail you are sitting on, or worse, your leg. Even a friendly alpha drop to the floor by yours truly doesn't phase them, so I just dont' make it a habit to go into the pen anymore. At least not to sit down. They'll only get worse as they age. And these boys are only just going to be yearlings. Last year I sold Bourbon to Gail V. at about a yearling so I don't know how they'll mature past this time of year. Should be fun to see. Bourbon sure looked good!\n\nLife and Death\n\nThere were three things I wanted to name this blog:\n1. I'm done\n2. Just my luck\n3. What else\n\nBut I decided on this title after all my chores were done.\n\nAfter my last post, I went outside to do evening chores. With my dad going from work right to bowling, I was in charge of all evening chores. What started out as routine ended in death.\n\nForty five minutes after I had last checked the goats in the barn I went in to give them their daily 'ration' of their feed\/mineral. I noticed Krista had a head of a baby goat dangling from her behind. Upon further examination it had expired and was unable to get out due to both front feet being back, making natural kidding a big problem. Now Krista is an experience mom. She'd kidded 4 other years before kidding here. She's an old pro. Why this? Why now?\n\nI called vet #1. Remember he's the one that doesn't return my calls. Figures he didn't answer, his wife did. I told her who i was and the situation ( i couldn't get my hands in to grab the leg) and her reply was ' well he's on another emergency call actually'. THAT WAS IT. I asked her 'well where? and how long will it be? who else can I call?\" She didn't have answers. I nearly called her a name I only use in dog showing.\n\nI called vet #2. He'd be right out (thank God!) What seemed like 72 hours later he appears, positions her back end up in the air, reaches in, grabs the legs and pulls the buckling out. He's not oversized, just a poor presentation. Another caramel, but a medium color, and another boy. I'm 0-2 on boys this year. I told him he had the hands of God. I sure couldn't get mine in there and he's about the same size as me!\n\nAfter a long discussion with the vet over all my trials and tribulations with the goats, I thanked him and he thanked me (he should have for the 65 dollar emergency call plus 35 farm visit plus whatever it costs to pull the goat out in 7 seconds).\n\nNow with a steaming head and mind, I walk out to feed the pregnant cows. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY out in the calving pasture is our eldest cow and matriarch of the herd (she's only eight) with a solid red heifer calf. Our first for the year!! And its my DAD's....guess I'll keep waiting.\n\nSpring is coming and i'm still not ready!\n\nOliver and Mac\n\nZoe and Sadie\n\nSo many things flying through my fingers won't keep up with it :)\n\nSo the National Cardigan Welsh Corgi Specialty is coming up the middle of April. This will be Zoe's first show since the St Paul show in January. Her time has come to WIN. She and I spoke and discussed the 12 Reserve Winner's Bitch ribbons that hang on the wall. We need some Winner's Bitch ribbons now!! Ell will have her first show with her litter mate, Flash, at the National. I'm very excited to show with all the reputable, renowned, long time breeders in the club. I've been very blessed in the past year to have met many CWC breeders via email and our ShowCardi-L list. I've contacted most of them and hope that I\"ll be able to find them in the crowd to introduce myself personally.\n\nI'm pretty lucky!! This year I am road tripping most of the way with a friend from Iowa (share the gas expense), then staying with new friends (for free) in the trailer parking ON GROUNDS, and setting up for grooming with Ell's well known and well respected breeders at Pluperfect-Merrymoon-Puddleduck. I already have most of my nights booked with breeder's education, Annual Banquet, 'social hour', as well as getting to meet many of my dog's relatives and get to see the stud dog, Fudge, in person, as well as many other GREAT dogs. All the top dogs in the breed will be there, as well as first time puppies (My Ell included). I'm pretty pumped about being there to share in all the fun!! AND FOR SO LITTLE MONEY!\n\nOn our way home we are stopping at Gail Former's farm to see her sheep and set up, as well as the new lambs. It will be good to see Gail again. I always enjoy our time together. I learn so much!\n\nI've started hallucinating.\n\nOr my ewes are great actresses!!!\n\nLavender last night starting laying down, getting up and sniffing the ground, kicking her tummy, peeing a lot, tail out, and bleating ever so softly. I panicked, and was up every hour on the hour to check her. Yup, I definitely need a baby monitor. I was so confused as she didn't have an udder but thought maybe she was one of those ewes that didn't bag until she HAD the lambs. At any rate she still doesn't have any babies and I'm quite ticked off. I'm sure she is smug thinking ' YES! Chalk one more up for the girls!' The score must be Garrett 0, ewes 15. I'll never learn. I think I saw her high-five a couple of the girls on their way out to the pasture this I held the door open with one hand and a large mountain dew in the other hand.\n\nTechnically they are due at any time. I've been watching bellies and udders and back ends. Cori and Chloe are still the closest if I go only by udder size. MOST of the girls vulva's are getting quite fleshy but still the udders are not that big. At least a few weeks or more for them. Some of the yearling girls are so round that its difficult for them to lay down and rest comfortably. For both of our sakes I hope they all lamb soon. Then I can get back to full sleep. I walk ...

Improvise, adapt & overcome!\n\nAutomation and\/or new technology always seems to be putting someone out of a job \u2013 at least that has been a common complaint since the Luddites of England smashed the infernal machines which threatened their livelihoods.

More goods and services made with fewer hands is the key to wealth creation. Those who strive to turn back the clock would only impoverish us.\n\nThe advent of machine-controlled grading has a few surveyors worried.

Oh, the irony.\n\nSmart surveyors will embrace new technology and use it to their advantage. New = opportunity.

        "text":"Sunday, May 28, 2006\n\nPrices rise as demand for food for fuel grows\n\nEarlier this week I gave evidence to an informal session of the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. One issue that was raised was likely future trends in food prices, particularly after a further reform of the CAP.\n\nHowever, long before that happens, mounting competition between fuel and food could drive up the cost of food. It would be a nasty shock for western consumers who have been used to falling real food prices for a long time, but the real hit would be on poorer people living in developing countries.\n\nThe US, the world's largest exporter of corn (maize) will convert as much or more of the grain into ethanol next year than it will sell abroad according to the United States Department of Agriculture. As petrol (gas) prices climb, farmers are diverting more of their harvest towards producing fuel rather than food or feedstock for animals.\n\nPrices of corn have risen by close to 20 per cent as world grain stocks have fallen to their lowest level since the early 1970s. There has also been a substantial impact on world sugar prices which have doubled over the past year to a 25-year high. About 10 per cent of world sugar output is now used to produce ethanol. The figure is just 3 per cent for corn but it is rising fast.\n\nGood world harvests over the past few years have concealed the impact of rising demand for ethanol. US energy legislation requires ethanol production to increase to 7.5bn gallons by 2012, requiring about 68 million tonnes of grain, more than the total grain harvest of Canada. Keith Colins, chief economist at USDA, noted, 'We are embarking on a profound change in our agricultural economy.'\n\nThursday, May 25, 2006\n\nMilk quota rules may face court challenge\n\nGiven that there's an internal market, it's always been a mystery why milk quota can't be traded across national borders (although some member states restrict trading within their own borders). Some farmers don't have enough quota, others have quota they would like to sell at a decent price and use the capital for other activities. Above all, trading quota would prevent the structure of the dairy industry in the EU ossifying in a way that made it even less internationally competitive than it is already.\n\nNow the milk quota rules may be subject to a case in the European Court of Justice based on the principle of the free movement and trade of people, goods and services across EU borders. In February British milk quota trader Ian Potter managed to transfer several million litres of quota from Britain to Italy. Italy is only 56 per cent self-sufficient in milk production and the high price of quota is forcing dairy farmers out of business. The British farmers got more than they would have done in the depressed British market.\n\nPotter was encouraged in this course of action by the sale of 200,000 litres of quota from Hungary to Italy last year. Following the signing of the quota transfer contracts in the Potter deal, forms were lodged with the Italian authorities and the English Rural Payments Agency. The RPA duly rejected the transfers, but the Italian authorities were less definite, saying that they did not believe that the transfer requests that were being used quite conformed to the current EU law.\n\nWhile the self-styled Italian Milk Warriors wait for their day in court, the Italian authorities appear to be prepared to recognise the transfers for the time being and will not seek to collect superlevy from the fifteen Italian farms involved.\n\nSunday, May 21, 2006\n\nEU may give ground on tariffs in Doha Round\n\nThe EU has indicated that it may give further ground on the crucial issue of tariffs in the Doha Round of trade negotiations which are at increasing risk of collapsing altogether. However, by doing so, they have encountered resistance from some member states, while American sources think that the likely offer is insufficient. Hence the EU finds itself caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\nThe EU's current offer is to cut farm tariffs by an average of 39 per cent, an offer substantially diluted by its insistence that 8 per cent of tariff lines should be designated as sensitive and hence exempted from the cuts. The G20 group of emerging countries led by Brazil has asked for a 54 per cent overall cut, while the US is holding out for 66 per cent.\n\nPress reports in Brussels suggest that the EU might increase its average cut to around 50 per cent. A spokesman for EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said that a 54 per cent cut was out of the question, but did not deny the possibility of an offer in the region of 50 per cent. There has, however, been no indication of a reduction in the percentage of tariff lines to be designated as sensitive.\n\nThe EU is also insisting on a quid pro quo, in particular a much lower ceiling for industrial good tariffs than the 30 per cent proposed by India and Brazil. The EU and US have previously asked for 15 per cent, but may be prepared to raise that figure by a few percentage points.\n\nHowever, France has made it clear that it does not want further reductions in farm tariffs or subsidies without substantial concessions elsewhere. Moreover, a spokesman for the Austrian agriculture ministry (Austria is the current president) declared that 'Member states would be very surprised should there be a new EU offer on the table. A majority of member states have grave concerns.'\n\nThe office of the USTR confirmed that the EU proposal would fall well short of American demands. The US view that the EU should agree cuts of between 54 and 66 per cent and designate just 1 per cent of tariff lines as sensitive. It is this latter issue that is the difficult one as the EU could make quite substantial cuts in high tariffs and still maintain effective protection. Charles Grassley, the Iowa senator who chairs the finance committee which has lead responsibility for trade policy in the Senate, has stated, 'If Plan B is a minimalist approach, then don't bring Plan B to me.'\n\nThere's a long way to go and time is slipping away.\n\nSaturday, May 06, 2006\n\nGrain mountain problem grows\n\nThe arable sector was the first commodity regime within the CAP to be reformed and it is often assumed that all the major problems are behind us, particularly with the abolition of rye intervention in the Fischler reforms, a product often grown just to sell into intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, not all the problems have been solved. Support prices have been cut by around 45 per cent, but intervention stocks at the end of the last buying season were at their highest level for twelve years, 15,482 million tonnes and they look likely to rise again this year.\n\nMuch of current grain production in Eastern Europe is being grown with intervention in mind and doing anything about it is seen as a political hot potato as there is a reluctance to cause trouble with the new member states who are already feeling sore about other issues. Hungary has invested considerable sums of money in increasing grain storage capacity in anticipation of the increase in intervention stocks.\n\nFranz Fischler was the first major figure to question whether one can really have a common policy in such a diverse agricultural region as Europe. A recent study for the Commission by consultants LMC argues that a single intervention price is a barrier to the flow of cereal from surplus regions, particularly landlocked regions like East-Central Europe, to the main grain deficit area, the Iberian peninsula.\n\nThe report also criticises set aside (the rate is 10 per cent in western Europe) as a blunt policy instrument which mainly benefits the United States. Set aside land is generally 30 per cent less productive than land not set aside (our local farmer has chosen his worst drained and smallest field) and producers in East-Central Europe are exempt until at least 2009. The US goverment gains because set aside pushes up world prices and hence cuts their outlays on deficiency payments.\n\nThe report has some sensible but radical solutions such as having only one intervention price based on common wheat, getting rid of set aside, limiting support payments to the grain barons and purchasing only breadmaking wheat and then just in Spain and Portugal.\n\nUnfortunately these ideas would upset the powerful big grain producers in the EU and are hence unlikely to be adopted, so the grain mountain will just keep on growing.\n\nEU isolated on sensitive products\n\nThe EU is looking increasingly isolated over the question of 'sensitive' products in the stuttering Doha Round, even though it may be prepared to give ground on its insistence that eight per cent of product lines should be deemed 'sensitive' and given special levels of protection. However, it is now the only major player insisting that tariff quota increases for such products be calculated as a percentage of imports rather than a percentage of domestic consumption.\n\nThe World Bank has pointed out that the designation of only 2 per cent of products in developed countries and 4 per cent in developing countries as sensitive would 'virtually eliminate the poverty impacts of a Doha agreement.'\n\nOf course, what 'sensitive' means is 'politically sensitive in the EU and in particular in key member states'. Sugar is a very likely candidate for this treatment. However, the EU confectionery industry is arguing against further protection, pointing out that it is being undermined by imports of cheap confectionery from Asia. They argue that if sugar became a sensitive product it could cost them \u20ac1.2bn a year which would go into the pockets of the sugar industry.\n\nAs it so happens, the world price sugar is increasing anyway because of rising oil prices and the consequent diversion of greater quantities of sugar, in particular in major producer Brazil, for ethanol production.",

        "text":"Partners of the Americas Farmer to Farmer Blog Features Our Project\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say (and if you\u2019d like to visit their actual\u00a0blog page, click here):\n\nCultivating Change: Farmer to Farmer Blog\n\n\u00a0Top-Bar Beekeeping 101: Sustainable Beekeeping in St. Mary, Jamaica\nExample of a top-bar hive.\n\nToday marks the beginning of Tom Hebert\u2019s month-long volunteer assignment in St. Mary, Jamaica, a parish located in\u00a0the northeast section of the country. Mr. Hebert, Owner and Manager of his own beekeeping enterprise in Intibuc\u00e1, Honduras and Moderator for a top-bar hive forum on, will be providing instruction to both novice and more experienced beekeepers on the ins and outs of top-bar beekeeping.\n\nWhy top-bar?Mr. Hebert\u2019s host and Yerba Buena Farm Owner, Agape Adams, explains the difficulty of obtaining foundation for traditional Langstroth hives in Jamaica.\n\n\u201cIn America, any beekeeper can purchase as many sheets of foundation as they need to increase the number of hives they have in their apiary. In Jamaica, it is not so easy. In order to get foundation, beekeepers must bring in wax to exchange for an equal weight of foundation. In order to grow, farmers raid wild hives and use the wax they remove to exchange for extra foundation. It\u2019s not an easy or sustainable situation.\u201d\n\nTom Hebert and his homemade smoker.\n\nTop-bar hive construction removes the need for foundation, as frames are not used. As Agape explained, there are just the top bars of frames from which the bees build their own comb or, at most, just a small waxed guide as a starting point for the bees in the center of the bar.\n\nThrough Mr. Hebert\u2019s trainings, Agape, her husband Kwao, and other interested local beekeepers hope to learn a more natural, affordable method of beekeeping. In addition to lower material costs, they look forward to not having to raid wild hives for wax to exchange for foundation. As expressed by Agape, \u201cthe list of advantages is long\u201d.\nTo prepare for Mr. Hebert\u2019s arrival, his hosts have set up 8, hand-made trap hives using wood from their bamboo trees and purchased a Langstroth\u00a0hive for demonstrations on converting Langstroth\u00a0hives to top-bar. Mr. Hebert plans on leading two workshops each weekend \u2013 one for novices and one for advanced beekeepers. He hopes to also bring in Field Officers from the Apiculture Unit as well as members of the All-Island Bee Farmer\u2019s Association for these trainings.\n\u00a0Workshop topics include: bee\u00a0development and bee biology; colony organization; best places to locate\u00a0hives; what hives need; hive construction; swarm removal; apiary management; integrated pest management; and harvesting. For those not completely ready to transition to top-bar hives, he\u2019ll provide\u00a0instruction on simplified Langstroth management and transferring comb from top-bar to frame hives.\nMr. Hebert will use his time during the week to make sample gloves and veils, produce a sample foundation mold and other visuals for his training on equipment construction, and pay visits to individual apiaries for 1-on-1 consultations.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Sunday, June 27, 2010\n\nTraditions in shagreen leather dyeing: black, green and blue\n\nShagreen leather (not to be confused with the shark or ray skin variety) was mainly made from horse or onager skin. Only a small part of the animals' backs is truly suitable.\nAfter an initial treatment the grain side is showered with Chenopodium album (named alabuta) seeds, and covered with one or two layers of felt. This must be put under great pressure, so that the seeds leave their typical pattern in the still moist skin.\n\nAs several 19th century manuals (Hebert, 1838\/Aikin, 1808) state: 'The beautiful green dye is given by soaking the inner or flesh side of the skin with a saturated solution of sal ammoniac, strewing it over with copper fillings, rolling it up with the flesh side inwards, and pressing each skin with considerable weight, for about 24 hours, in which time the sal-ammoniac dissolves enough of the copper to penetrate the skin with an agreeable see-green colour: this is repeated a second time, to give the colour more body. Blue shagreen is dyed with indigo, dissolved in an impure soda, by means of lime and honey. Black shagreen is dyed with galls and vitriol.'\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Thursday, December 10, 2009\n\nWe've been so busy coping with the problems of putting malkha production in place that we haven't been paying attention to the quantity of fabric now being produced.. and suddenly realized that it's gone up to more than double! Very exciting and gratifying, but of course it also means more marketing.. At the exhibitions and Bazars customers ask us where it is available, but we don't have retail outlets, and in any case would not be able to afford the costs of urban retail at our present margins. It would be against the principles of malkha to have high mark-ups, so what do we do? Invent low-cost delivery channels. We already supply a few customers by mail - we put photographs on the web, they choose & pay through electronic transfer, and we deliver by post or transport.\n\nWe also need to scale up our indigo dyeing since there is a waiting list for deep indigo malkha. Its not the dyeing that holds things up but the transport to and from the vat. The indigo dyers are the only remaining family of traditional indigo dyers in Andhra, and they have put up vats for Dastkar Andhra and for Charkha in Karnataka. This picture, one of several documenting the installation of the Charkha vat taken by Pankaj Sekhsaria, shows an indigo pot with fermented indigo dyebath in its newly plastered bed.\n\nSaturday, December 5, 2009\n\nThe people of rural India are skilled, intelligent and capable of producing excellent products for all aspects of a good life. Today, their access to the natural materials around them is more and more restricted. It began in colonial times with the appropriation by the State of forests, and continues today through appropriation of land and water and poisoning of the air by corporate interests supported by the State. Corporate interests see rural people as buyers of their toothpaste, biscuits, shampoos, soap and cloth... and of course now also of electrical appliances and petrol-driven vehicles. But surely toothpaste and soap does not need to be made in huge factories? Soapnut trees produce shampoo and piloo and neem trees produce toothbrushes which don't need toothpaste. Biscuits which kill childrens' appetites have replaced the nutritious snacks Indian children used to eat of puffed rice jaggery and chana.\n\n'Development' should take as its premise the valuable repository of skills, capabilities and resources of the Indian countryside and the particular character of our varied and diverse society. Its foolish to discard ecological production practices in which we lead the world, in favour of so-called 'modern' production that is energy-intensive and polluting. That has been the guiding principle of the malkha process.\n\nWednesday, December 2, 2009\n\nTribal Health Initiative, which provides health services for adivasis around Sittilingi in Tamil Nadu has encouraged them to grow organic cotton. Weavers' Wheel buys the ginned cotton from them and delivers it to the Kranti Chellapa Nulu Sangam, an independent malkha centre. They turn it into cloth, which is then stitched into garments designed by Altra Qualita of Italy, for the Italian market, at Gandhi Rural Research Centre also in Tamil Nadu. This is happening for the second year, and we hope that eventually both Sittilingi and GRRC will set up their own malkha units to cut out all the intermediate transport.\n\nThe clothes can be seen in the Altra Qualita catalogue, and the new range is in production.\n\nWednesday, November 25, 2009\n\nPosting Sunny Meeta's comment, in case people miss it:\n\n'You guys have created the freedom fabric of the post-industrial age. Its equivalent to khadi for the freedom movement but more sustainable. Its low carbon footprint, decentralised production, and appropriate technology process is actually creating a new synthesis of the dialectic of nature and technology. A synthesis that comes from the colonised south not from the all knowing western university or corporate system. Great going.'\n\nHope that the malkha 'synthesis of the dialectic of nature and technology', of traditional expertise with IIT trained engineering, will encourage other such efforts. Rural industries owned by rural people, using the whole gamut of natural resources which at present are sold off cheaply to corporate industry within or outside the country... traditional and new skills.. green energy..what a vista..\n\nThursday, November 19, 2009\n\nnature bazar, Delhi\n\nDastkar's annual Nature Bazar has become a hugely popular event in Delhi's annual calendar. Folk performances and and childrens' workshops, besides the 160 or so craft stalls, on the lawns of the IGNCA, a lively mela atmosphere. Its a pity that there is little public transport, but the metro will make a huge difference next year.\nFor malkha it was encouraging to have repeat customers who have enjoyed wearing what they bought last year. This year most of our sales were in retail, directly to users, though some of them lamented the difficulty of finding tailors. As usual the deep indigo was a sellout. So were Sutanu's prints of swans and butterflies and the alizarin red. Our stripes do better in Delhi than they did in Bangalore, and of course this time for the first time we had different weights from the different weaving centres. Also for the first time we tried the bleached plain, which we are a little hesitant about because it's not natural bleaching [we hope to get to that in time].\n\nOne of our European customers is from Friends of SEWA and buys indigo malkha for the SEWA Lucknow women to use for chikan embroidery, sounds wonderful, hope we get to see the end product. Another great fan is Aarti, wife of Tushar of Living Blue. She wore a malkha kurta almost every one of the 10 days of the Bazar, and bought lots more. Thanks to retail, this was our best ever sale so far and we feel quite elated by peoples' admiring comments: we were asked is it was silk, or linen... just shows how wonderful cotton can be if its treated with respect. Now the question is how to make it more easily available.. we're encouraging people to order even small quantities through e-mail which we can send by post.\n\nMonday, November 2, 2009\n\nA frequently asked question is why our cloth is called malkha.\nIn the days of Indian cotton textiles' glory, there were many different varieties of cotton fabrics, and the names too were many and varied, and part of the common vocabulary: bafta, nainsukh, dosuti, moree, jamdani, mulmul, chint [morphed into chintz by the Firangs], mashru, himru, and many more. We made up the name malkha by combining the first syllables of mulmul and khadi. We hope as malkha production gets going in different places that each will develop its own variant, for example the malkha made at Magan Sangrahalaya, Wardha, wants to call itself magan malkha.\n\nAt present all the malkha produced in Andhra just goes by one name, though it is now coming from 3 different centres, with the fourth installed and soon to start production.\n\nSunday, October 25, 2009\n\nWow, malkha is picking up fans in Europe. Here is a note from a French buyer, a 'partner with Hermes International':\n\nAs a designer, I have been very attracted by the texture and aspect of the malka textiles, as well as the natural colors that you managed to blend in a very smart way, the subtil chin\u00e9 effects.\n\nSome of us, designers, are concern by the tendancy, nowdays, to work with products which are more man-friendly and less eco-friendly. The fact that in Malka, the cotton does not travel extensively, creating more pollution in India, but is treated locally, adds to the value of the product, its exclusiveness.\n\nA greater number of the foreign customers are more and more concerned about environment and human issues, and Malka can meet the requirements of this market. That is why i was keen, since the beginning on using malka cottons for european market.\n\nSamples of the garments sent to Paris last month fair met a good response, so i will develop more of these products, as top-of\u2013the-range creations are our niche.\n\nCongratulation to the Malka cotton developers for having created a line of products that meets our requirements, as far as quality, esthetic and ethics are concerned.\n\n... and so to the ring-frames, where the sliver is spun into yarn. We prefer to have it handspun on 12-spindle motorized domestic charkhas, in the regions where women are looking for additional sources of income which they can manage at home...see the picture of our women spinners in the blog of Sept 19. If not, then we spin it on mechanized ring frames with 180-240 spindles.\n\nThe yarn is then wound into hanks, and sent off to the dye-house or, if it is to be made into undyed cloth, boiled for strength before going into the pre-loom processes.\n\nAbout the weaving you'll hear from me later.\n\nWe're back into pre-exhibition mode, this time in preparations for Nature Bazar in Delhi at the Indira Gandhi Centre for the Arts [IGNCA], Janpath, from November 5 to 14. And I hope we'll see all our old customers there who so enthusiastically bought malkha last year and wrote appreciative messages in our visitors' book, and new customers too.\n\nThursday, October 15, 2009\n\nContinuing the cotton-to-cloth story from the last blog:\n\nInstead of going through the baling, unbaling and blowroom processes, the cotton that comes to malkha units comes in lint form straight from the ginning mill. [In two of the three units that are presently working in Andhra, the cotton is organically grown]. The lint is fed into our revolutionary carding machine [pictured here], where it is treated gently. Trash is easily dislodged, since it has not been pressed into the lint. The lighter-than-air fibres are hardly touched by the metal, guided rather than forced, into alignment and first form a lap, and then blanket, and then carded sliver, or loose rope form.\n\nFrom here the carded sliver is fed into the second machine, the draw-frame, where 6 individual slivers are drawn into one, in the process equalizing all ...

        "text":"Monday, 10 January 2011\n\n\nI have been using PET tape on my heated bed for a long time now. It works very well as long as I clean it with acetone about every 100 hours. It does need a high temperature (145\u00b0C) for the first layer with some types of ABS though .\n\nIt seems to last forever, the only failure mode is that large thick objects with sharp corners can defeat the adhesive and raise blisters at the corners near the edge of the bed. I solve that by building little heat shields to keep the corners warm. I am always on the lookout for something better though. It would be nice to get rid of the lines where the tape butts against itself.\n\nA friend gave me a sheet of 1mm thick PETG to try. I clipped it onto my heated bed, and thinking it would behave like PET tape, I ran a build using the same temperatures.\n\nBig mistake, PET has a glass transition at 75\u00b0C so it went soft and floppy. The object stuck to it very well and was hard to remove, but after getting a knife under one corner, it peeled cleanly. However it left an impression in the PETG.\n\nThe base of the object is flat but the filaments are more ridged because they sank into the sheet rather than being squashed.\n\nWhen the sheet cooled down it warped badly, so that was the end of that experiment. I did have a small offcut though so I tried again at 70\u00b0C.\n\nThis time the object warped badly. It stayed stuck to the PETG but it warped the sheet. The adhesion was less and the object was easily peel-able. The PETG warped where the object was but the rest of it stayed flat. The heat of the object must have been enough to tip it over its glass transition locally. It left an impression, but not as deep as the first time.\n\nThe filaments on the bottom were squashed tighter, not as smooth as when using tape.\n\nSo a failed experiment. It is a shame because at high temperatures it bonds very well but, unlike PC, it still peels, but it is no good if it doesn't remain rigid. Wikipedia does say that PETG has a lower melting point than PET. It doesn't mention how it affects Tg, but it gives the Tg of PET as 75\u00b0C. Odd then that PET tape doesn't go soft at 75\u00b0C. My next trial will be Mylar, which is another form of PET (BoPET).\n\n\n  1. Hi\n    If you have time can you please help me build\/print a contact printing frame? I apologize for contacting you here but i couldn't find an email address.\n\n  2. The reason the PET tape works is that it has been biaxially stretched during production of the film, thus raising its temperature resistance well above 120C (if fact to completely melt the film you would have to go over 200). But the base polymer (in simple extruded form) indeed will have a Tg of about 75C. With Melinex you will find the same behaviour as your socalled PET tape (which is probably Melinex of another producer).\n\n  3. Thanks, that is something I had begun to suspect, i.e. PET tape is actually BoPET.",

And, our government said, that we would do our best to resume the imports within the period,\u201d the ministry statement said.\nSouth Korea will put the import health requirements to public consultations, the Canadian government said.Canada will also request a suspension of the World Trade Organization proceedings it began against Korea in 2009.\nChina also agreed to resume imports of Canadian beef last year, but hasn\u2019t started accepting shipments yet.\nwith files from Reuters\n\n\nPublicar un comentario\n\nCon la tecnolog\u00eda de Blogger.",

        "text":"Friday, 21 September 2007\n\nNonwovens: What Happens Next?\n\nThe fabulous growth of the nonwoven industry in general and the disposable diaper in particular has been fuelled by the availability of low-cost synthetic polymers, by-products of low-cost energy production from fossil reserves priced close to extraction \u2013as opposed to replacement- cost.\nFibre forming, web forming and web bonding technologies have evolved to use these synthetics ever more efficiently. Sustainability, biodegradability, carbon-footprint, intergenerational equity, and depletion of fossil reserves have been concerns which remained in the background throughout, until now.\nWill the growth continue? The big changes which are increasingly familiar to all consumers may soon affect their purchasing decisions and it may no longer be safe simply to extrapolate past nonwoven industry trends.\nWe review the past 40 years and think about the future over the next few postings.\n\nComing Next: Diaper Trends\n\nNo comments:",
