These are interactive hands on debugging, non-interactive batch debugging and post-mortem debugging using the GPU corefile functionality introduced in CUDA 7.0. Each of these techniques is a useful tool with benefits and limitations. This talk will introduce these three debugging techniques and provide some suggestions on selecting the optimal approach for a variety of debugging scenarios such as hangs, numerical errors, and crashes. Specific examples will be given using the TotalView debugger but the concepts covered may apply to other debugging tools such as GDB and the NVIDIA NSIGHT debugger.\u201d\n\nDownload the Slides (PDF) * Sign up for our insideHPC Newsletter\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n\nResource Links:",

        "text":"Multithreaded Test Synthesis\n\nSubtle concurrency errors in multithreaded libraries that arise because of incorrect or inadequate synchronization are often difficult to pinpoint precisely using only static techniques. On the other hand, the effectiveness of dynamic detectors is critically dependent on multithreaded test suites whose execution can be used to identify and trigger concurrency bugs including data races, deadlocks and atomicity violations. Usually, such multithreaded tests need to invoke a specific combination of methods with objects involved in the invocations being shared appropriately to expose a bug. Without a priori knowledge of the bug, construction of such tests can be challenging.\n\nThis talk presents a lightweight and scalable technique for synthesizing tests for detecting thread-safety violations. Given a multi-threaded library and a sequential test suite, I will describe a fully automated analysis that examines sequential execution traces, and produces as its output a concurrent client program that drives shared objects via library method calls to states conducive for triggering a concurrency bug. Experimental results on a variety of well-tested Java libraries demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in revealing many complex bugs.\n\nVideo producer:\n\nRelated Videos:\n\n  \u2022 No Related Videos",
