        "text":"Hacking the Tivo Series 2\n\nI bought a Tivo Series 2 a while ago in the hopes of hacking it. I didn't find much information on it so I set it aside. After getting my usb-to-uart bridge and some jumpers I soldered pins to it's uart pin holes and got nothing, but now I'm reading about it and it seems I can hack the OS on the hard drive itself. I may just end up replacing the entire OS. My goal is to use the system as a dumb terminal or possibly as a HTPC front end, given its nice composite output, but the fact that any network connections will have to be over USB may be too great of bottleneck.\n\n\nI threw out my Tivo Series 2. Either something was wrong with the hard drive or I'm just retarded. I could not mount the hard drive and after much fussing and poking and prodding, I gave up on the beast and threw it out. If I come across another series 2 for $10 or less I'll pick it up (most I've seen are $20 or $25).",

        "text":"Creating a 555 Timer Based Variable Tone Generator\n\nI\u2019ve finally started settling into my new job a bit more, and the huge waves of feeling overwhelmed have turned into small ripples, so time to step up the blogging again!\n\nOne love I\u2019ve cultivated a lot over the past few years is that of EE. Designing circuits and building them is just a lot of fun. It\u2019s almost like getting to program with physical objects and connections instead of code. At least that\u2019s how I view it, though I\u2019m sure the electrical engineers out there are rolling their eyes.\n\nI like designing and working on complex digital circuits, but it\u2019s also fun just to make quick, neat little projects. Often times they have more uses than you\u2019d even think of.\n\nAnnoy Your Friends!\n\nOne I made a few years ago for a yankee swap gift (I made two, kept one for myself), was what I called the \u201cSuper Noise Maker 5000\u2033. In truth, it was just a variable tone generator. I put a nice loud microspeaker and a pot on it so you could basically drive people nuts with a nice loud noise that you could twist from low to high pitch over and over again. I even put a 1\/8\u2033 mono jack so you could pump the volume up through an external amp. ;)\n\n\nAside from annoying people, tone generators are pretty neat and have a lot of uses. Tracing lines, telcom uses, music generation, etc, they\u2019re just a lot of fun. While the specific application you\u2019re designing it for dictates what kind of control you have over which frequency is produced, for our purposes, we want a fun toy, so the Super Noise Maker 5000 does the following:\n\n1. Uses a 9 volt for power (this lasts a long time, this circuit doesn\u2019t use much juice)\n2. Has a push button to activate the sound (press the button, hear the tone!)\n3. Has a potentiometer to control frequency (turn knob right, lower frequency, turn right, higher frequency)\n4. Has a second push button to change octaves (well, not an exact octave, but if the button isn\u2019t pushed, its lower frequencies \u2013 push the button, it jumps to higher frequencies \u2013 you can get some awesome effects tapping this button while adjusting the frequency)\n5. Has a 1\/8\u2033 mono jack for piping the sound out to a receiver\/amp\/recording device\/whatever.\n6. Onboard speaker hits high frequencies VERY well and it hurttttsss. I don\u2019t do this too often for both my and my cats\u2019 sake.\n\nSuper Noise Maker 5000\n\nHow Sound and Speakers Work\n\nThe theory behind this is pretty easy and is a good starter project. First off, remember that sound is a pressure wave \u2013 it is the movement of air at a frequency \u2013 these pressure waves hit your eardrum, and you hear sound. Higher frequency, or more waves per second, is a higher note \u2013 lower is lower. So speakers operate by vibrating, which produce these pressure waves at different frequencies. The speaker vibrates by the magic of magnets. Since magnets can either attract or repel each other depending on the polar orientation, speakers use this by having one permanent magnet that is always aligned with a specific polarity and an electromagnet that gets its current polarity from running current in a specific direction over it.\n\nSo if we run current back and forth over the electromagnet in the speaker at 1000 times a second, we get a 1000 hz, or 1khz tone out of the speaker. If we make the electromagnet switch poles 5000 times a second, we get a 5khz tone. Etc!\n\nNow, the problem arises that we need to turn the steady voltage from our battery into an oscillating amount. If we just ran steady DC power over a speaker, it wouldn\u2019t do anything except damage the speaker \u2013 the electromagnet would just stay at the same polarity, hence no sound. We need to take that steady stream of electricity and turn it into a wave, so it moves the magnet back and forth. There are a lot of ways of getting oscillated power, some are geared toward fixed amounts, but we want a variable amount (we want to control the frequency of oscillation). An awesome little chip to do this is the 555 Timer, one of the most multipurpose chips EVER, it\u2019s great.\n\nThe 555 Timer\n\n555 Timer The 555 timer family (when in astable mode, the 555 timer has multiple uses) takes steady voltage, say from our 9 volt battery, and pumps out a square wave, or in other words, oscillates back and forth between 0 volts and 9 volts. The frequency is driven by the use of resistors and a capacitor across its control pins \u2013 which we can control. We can either use specific resistors for a fixed frequency, or we can use a potentiometer and have a user controlled resistance, and hence frequency. There are lots of 555 timer calculators online too for figuring out what values to use for the desired frequency.\n\n\nWe still have a small problem though. Our 555 is putting out an oscillation between 0 and 9 volts. This isn\u2019t quite what the speaker wants \u2013 instead of driving the electromagnet back and forth, we\u2019re driving it in one direction and then turning it off over and over again. While this does make a sound, it\u2019s not a clear sound or at the right frequency (and I\u2019m sure not so great for the speaker). We need to turn this oscillation in DC current into AC current, i.e. instead of 0 to 9, we want -9 to 9. We want the current to go back and forth equally in both directions, not just in one direction and then not at all.\n\nWe can do this with a capacitor. Remember, a capacitor acts kind of like a little battery that can charge and discharge quickly \u2013 we can charge its terminal, and when current is removed, the capacitor discharges. This means that it will either draw or discharge current depending on if you are charging the other terminal. Hence if we put the capacitor between our 555 and the speaker, when the 555 pushes out 9 volts, the capacitor will charge and pull the current in one direction, and when the 555 goes to 0, the capacitor discharges and pushes the current the other direction. This causes AC power, since it oscillates between positive and negative, which is exactly what our speaker needs. And since it\u2019s driven by the 555 timer, we get the correct frequency!\n\nThe Schematics\n\nHere is a (somewhat messy, I\u2019ve gotten better at circuit diagrams over time) schematic of the device. You can see I\u2019ve used an LM555 timer, a speaker, stereo jack, a couple resistors, a couple buttons, a potentiometer and a couple capacitors. While this is a fun, neat little circuit to build, feel free to expand on your own and make your own ways of controlling the frequency, or combining tone generators together for multi-tone fun!\n\nSNM5K Schematics\n\n8 Responses to Creating a 555 Timer Based Variable Tone Generator\n\n  1.

        "text":"Raspberry Pi does Audio at the Wigwam HiFi Show 2016\n\nThe Wigwam Hifi Show is an unusual event, in that most of the exhibitors are not vendors with their latest and shiniest, but enthusiasts showing off their own systems. It is a lot of fun, with plenty of exotic and\/or old equipment that you will not see or hear elsewhere.\n\n\nI have exhibited at the show in the past, and try to do something a little different each time. This year I thought it would be interesting to contrast the many multi-box and expensive systems with something at the other end of the scale. I was impressed when I reviewed the IQAudio Pi-DigiAMP+ for issue 36 of the MagPi magazine, so I took it along.\n\nThis unit is a board that plugs in on top of the main Raspberry Pi board.\n\n\nIt is very simple, the only external connectors being power in, and left and right speaker terminals. It includes a DAC and a class D amplifier, based on the Texas Instruments (TI) TAS5756m chipset. The DAC is based on a Burr-Brown design.\n\nI assembled my unit using a Raspberry Pi 2, the above board, and the matching case and power supply from IQ Audio. The power supply is the XP Power VEF50US15 which means I get up to 2x20w; if you use a VEF65US19 you can get 2x35w (both available from the IQAudio site).\n\nHere it is in the room at Scalford Hall, home of the Wigwam event.\n\n\nThe speakers shown are the Cambridge Audio Aero 6, though we also had a pair of Quad 11L and tried them both.\n\nThe way things work at this event is that you sleep in your room the night before, and the next morning the bed is removed and it becomes your exhibition room. Having tried the system with the bed in place, I was distressed to find it sounding markedly worse (bloated bass) once the bed was removed. With no time for proper experimentation we dragged the mattress back out of the cupboard and leant it against the wall, which improved matters; we also used foam bungs in the speaker ports to tame the bass. Not ideal, but shows the difficulty of getting good sound at short notice in small hotel rooms.\n\nThe Cambridge Audio Aero 6 speakers I would describe as a good budget choice; they sell for around \u00a3350. Philosophically (as with the Quads) they are designed to be clean, detailed and uncoloured. The choice of floorstanders rather than small standmounts was deliberate, as I wanted to demonstrate that using a tiny amplifier does not necessarily mean a small sound.\n\nHaving said that, we also put the Quads on from time to time, which are small standmounts. The sound was not radically different, though bass extension is less and to my ears the 11Ls are a little less precise than the Aeros, with a warmer sound. I preferred the Aeros but as ever with loudspeakers, tastes vary.\n\nThe complete parts list as shown:\n\n  \u2022 Raspberry Pi 2 \u00a326.00\n  \u2022 IQAudio Pi-DigiAMP+ \u00a357.99\n  \u2022 IQAudio Pi-CASE+ \u00a315.60\n  \u2022 15v Power Brick XP Power VEF50US15 \u00a325.50\n\nIf I were buying today, I would recommend the new Raspberry Pi 3 and the more powerful 19v power supply which increases the cost by about \u00a310.00.\n\nSo that is between \u00a3125 and \u00a3135 for the complete device, and then whatever you choose for the speakers.\n\nFor the demonstration I brought along a router with wi-fi, to which I attached a hard drive with lots of FLAC files ripped from CD, along with a few high-res files. The router lets you attach a USB drive and share it over the network, so I configured Volumio on the Pi to use that as its source. In a typical home setup, you would probably store your music on a NAS device and use your existing home network.\n\nWhere\u2019s the amplifier?\n\nThere was a steady stream of visitors from around 10.00am to the close of the show at around 17.00. The goal was not to be the best sound at the show, but rather to be the smallest and still deliver decent sound quality, and for many visitors I think we succeeded. We stuck the equipment list on the wall and lots of people photographed it with the intention of looking into it further.\n\nA demo under way: spot the mattress leaning against the wall and the smaller Quad speakers alongside the Cambridge Audios.\n\nA number of visitors knew of, or were even using, a Pi for streaming, but the idea of having the amplifier included on a small board was less familiar; it was fun when people asked where the amplifier was, or whether the speakers were active (they are not). Some were really astonished that you can get respectable sound quality from such a small box.\n\nVolume was more than sufficient for a room this size and frankly plenty for most home situations though of course not for huge rooms or loud parties.\n\nNote that despite playing loud throughout the day the amp board did not get warm at all; this is because a Class D design delivers almost all the power supplied as output to the loudspeakers.\n\nA few early comments from the forums:\n\n\u201cThe super small Raspberry Pi based system by onlyconnect was a brilliant demo of what can be achieved by something tiny and low cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible if I hadn\u2019t have heard it\u2026 To boot, completely taking price out of the equation, it was one of the better sounding systems at the show to my ears, I enjoyed that more than some far, far more expensive rigs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHighlights. Onlyconnect\u2019s raspi based system, honestly why pay more for music around the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnlyconnect\u2019s Raspberry system was impressive and wins the GVFM award.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnlyconnect\u2019s mini\/budget system \u2013 just amazing how good a \u00a3125 raspberry pi setup containing streamer, dac, preamp and 35w per channel amp could sound. I can\u2019t forget how flabbergasted another listener was to discover the total system cost\u00a0 -\u201d I\u2019ve obviously doing it all wrong all these years\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent a while looking for the amplifier, following the cables etc like everybody else. I was impressed by the sound coming out of the Cambridge Audio speakers, I would certainly put this in the top 40% of rooms based on the sound quality, maybe higher.\u201d\n\nDatAshur encrypted drives: protect your data but be sure to back it up too\n\nThe iStorage DataAshur USB flash drive is a neat way to encrypt your data. Lost USB storage devices are a common cause of data theft anxiety: in most cases the finder won\u2019t care about your data but you can never be certain.\n\n\nThe DatAshur is simple to operate but highly secure, presuming it meets the advertised specification. All data written to the drive is automatically encrypted with 256-bit AES CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard with Cipher Block Chaining) and meets the US FIPS 140-2 standard. The encryption is transparent to the operating system, since decryption is built into the device and enabled by entering a PIN of 7 to 15 digits.\n\nNote that a snag with this arrangement is that if your PC is compromised a hacker might be able to read the data while the drive is connected. If you are really anxious you could get round this by working offline, or perhaps using Microsoft\u2019s clever Windows to Go (WTG) technology where you boot from a USB device and work in isolation from the host operating system. Unfortunately DatAshur does not support WTG (as far as I know) but there are alternatives which do, or you could boot into WTG and then insert your DatAshur device.\n\nNormally you enter the PIN to unlock the drive before connecting it to a PC or Mac. This does mean that the DatAshur requires a battery, and a rechargeable battery is built in. However if the battery is exhausted you can still get your data back by recharging the device (it charges whenever it is plugged into a USB port).\n\nOK, so what happens if a bad guy gets your device and enters PINs repeatedly until the right one is found? This will not work (unless you chose 1234567 or something like that) since after 10 failed tries the device resets, deleting all your data.\n\nYou should avoid, then, the following scenario. You give your DatAshur drive to your friend to show it off. \u201cI\u2019ve just updated all my expenses on this and there is no way you\u2019ll be able to get at the data\u201d. Friend fiddles for a bit. \u201cIndeed,and neither can you\u201d.\n\nHere then is the security dilemma: the better the security, the more you risk losing access to your own data.\n\nThe DatAshur does have an additional feature which mitigates the risk of forgetting the PIN. You can actually set two PINs, a user PIN and an admin PIN. The admin PIN could be retained by a security department at work, or kept in some other safe place. This still will not rescue you though if more than 10 attempts are made.\n\nWhat this means is that data you cannot afford to lose must be backed up as well as encrypted, with all the complexity that backup involves (must be off-site and secure).\n\nStill, if you understand the implications this is a neat solution, provided you do not need to use those pesky mobile devices that lack USB ports.\n\nThe product tested has a capacity from 4GB to 32GB and has a smart, strong metal case. The plastic personal edition runs from 8GB to 32GB and is less robust. An SSD model offers from 30GB to 240GB, and larger desktop units support SSD or hard drive storage from 64GB to 6TB, with USB 3.0 for fast data transfer.\n\nPrices range from around \u00a330 inc VAT for an 8GB Personal USB stick, to \u00a339.50 for the 4GB professional device reviewed here, up to \u00a3470 for the monster 6TB drive or \u00a3691 for a USB 3.0 external SSD (prices taken from a popular online retailer). The cost strikes me as reasonable for well-made secure storage.\n\nMore information on DatAshur is here.\n\nMicrosoft Band: do you want to track your health? and with a Microsoft device?\n\nData on human health has immense value. At an individual level, use of that data has the potential to enhance well-being and productivity, to extend life, and in some cases to avert disaster \u2013 such as prompting early investigation into a heart condition. In aggregate, more data on human health enables deeper medical research, especially when combined with other data about lifestyle, profession, location, diet and so on. Medicine is big business, so this... (truncated)",

And if current trends remain unchanged, the PC gets killed off by the tablet in Q4 2014.\n\n\u201cThe chart shows the trends over the past two years, with traditional PCs, primarily running Windows, still shipping far more units than tablets,\u201d Mr. Bishop writes. \u201cHowever, the PC shipment trends are flat overall, in contrast with the steady growth in shipments of iPads and other tablets.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the chart he supplies:\n\nBut what happens if sales of PCs, iPads, Android tablets, and Macs continue along the exact same growth trajectories?

        "text":"The PLDT TelPad S7-Slim Review\n\n2 years ago, the country\u2019s biggest telecommunications provider announced the launching of its hybrid landline unit called Telpad. I admit I was not that impressed. I obviously did not jump into the bandwagon for a number of reasons. But recently, a close encounter with a live Telpad made me reconsider my stand, which, by the way, explains why I am writing this review. I am writing this entry because, as most tech geek does, I want to do my own \u201cunveiling\u201d of the PLDT Telpad. (Never mind that it is a year late. As they always say \u201cit\u2019s better late than never\u201d.)\n\nBefore I go down to the good stuff, allow me to explain why I initially gave my \u201cpass\u201d card on the Telpad. First, it seems impractical and pretentious. Well, everyone knows that I love gadgets. I love them sleek and sophisticated but I also love them simple and functional. The Telpad performs, well, just like any other landline unit. The clincher here is that it comes with a tablet, which brings me to my \u201cimpractical\u201d argument: I already own a tablet.\n\nSo, aside from a phone and a tablet bundled together, there is nothing really groundbreaking after all\u2026 the technology itself is not so innovative. Second, there seems to be a lot of negativity around the promotional packaging of the Telpad. There are people who think that there might be a misrepresentation of figures on the fees. But of course, there is always another side of the story. And the last reason why I did not join the Telpad community was because I just don\u2019t need it and I already have a landline unit.\n\nSo why the sudden 360 degrees turn\u2014you might ask\u2014? Let\u2019s just say, certain situations require certain needs. A few weeks ago, I was lucky to be chosen to try out the PLDT Telpad S7-Slim with free 3-month subscription. I got so excited. I placed it in my living room immediately and used it as my main landline unit.\n\nPLDT Telpad S7 Slim Box\n\nWhile playing around with it, I reminisced the time when I first used a telephone. I have to turn the rotary dialer around and wait until the circle swung back to the starting position to dial next number. Time really runs fast. A few years back, I can only see thesekind of devices in futuristic movies that I was able to watch in Betamax and VHS. Now, it\u2019s a real thing and I\u2019m actually holding it.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about the Telpad is the ease of using a landline phone. Anything that you can do with your smartphones can be done with your landline. You can easily view your call logs, save your contacts, writes notes while taking calls, and do everything in the landline without moving around. You don\u2019t need to get a pen if somebody asked you if you have a pen to jot down what the caller is saying. You can easily browse Google maps if somebody asked you how to get here or there. You can do a lot of things, because you\u2019re landline is not just a landline. It\u2019s a smartlandline (just like smartphones, hehe).\n\nYou can\u2019t use the Android tablet for calls if you remove it from the Telpad dock. Anyway, you can use the built-in loud speakers of the landline unit if you want to walk around and talk out loud. This is really not a major drawback, just a slight disappointment for users who are fond of using wireless landline units. You can just do everything, except bringing the phone a few meters away from the dock. But hey, you can bring the tablet far away from the dock and use it as your very own Android tablet outside home.\n\nUnboxing the Telpad S7-Slim from PLDT\n\nPLDT Telpad S7-Slim on hand\n\nBack of PLDT Telpad S7-Slim\n\nPLDT Telpad S7-Slim Dock Contact Terminal\n\nThe PLDT Telpad S7-Slim Dock\n\nPLDT Telpad Dock Dial Buttons\n\nPLDT Telpad S7-Slim Dock Telephone Line Input and Power Input\n\nPLDT Telpad S7-Slim Dialer\n\nThe PLDT Telpad S7-Slim\n\nOverall Experience:\nThe price of convenience is not that expensive after all. I can say that owning a PLDT Telpad is really worth it and you\u2019ll surely not bother to look for another landline unit again. I\u2019m satisfied and really happy to have tried this awesome Telpad. And if you want to upgrade to a better landline unit, I highly recommend the PLDTTelpad S7 Slim or the Wave 2.3, whichever you like.\n\nSome facts about the PLDT Telpad:\nThe Telpad comes as a device that has aphone and a built-in tablet dock where the tablet can be mounted (the tablet of course is detachable). The Telpad, derive partly from telephone, sports a multifunctional phone (duh!? But hey, most reviews forget this part). It has a nationwide coverage and provides unlimited local calls. It also has a direct dialing access for NDD & IDD. The phone also boasts the following ability: Contact list, Call history, Call hold\/ pause, Speaker phone, Speed dialing through favorites tab,Caller ID, Call waiting, Call forwarding, 3-way conference (last four is via subscription).\n\nMore good stuff:\nThe PLDT Telpad tablet also comes in two variants: The PLDT Telpad S7 Slim, which runs on an Android 2.2 Froyo platform, and the PLDT TelpadWave 2.3 (AD-1000A), which is powered Android 2.3 Gingerbread.\n\nThe PLDT Telpad S7 Slim sports a 0.3MP front and 3.2 MP rear camera. It can last for about 180 hours of standby time and boasts a 3-axis Accelerometer, gravity, and ambient light sensors. It measures about 7.87x 4.3x 0.49 inches and has an 8 GB built-in memory.\n\nIts brother the TelpadWave 2.3, on the other hand, carries a singular front facing camera but is loaded with its 2MP SVGA 800\u00d7600 pixel. It is also bulkier than the S7 Slim with its 8.24x 5x 0.58 inches measurement. It is also tender with its battery\u2014last for about 70 hours of standby time\u2014and 2GB built in memory. It has a 3-Axis Accelerometer for UI auto-rotate.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to elaborate on its web browsing and multimedia functions anymore since I think tablet knowledge is no longer a thing of the past, even 3-year-old kids own a tablet nowadays. What I want to share is something exclusive to PLDT Telpad subscribers. If you own a PLDT Telpad, you get exclusive access to PLDT HOME\u2014a virtual hub where you can get updates and offers from partner establishments\u2014and askPLDT\u2014a one-touch guide to the latest news and information.\n\nPLDT is rewarding Telpad subscribers with another good stuff. They are offering the Telpad + WiFi Zone package. The WiFiZone is a new service that provides faster internet connection via dedicated WiFi line in select establishments throughout the Philippines. Telpad subscribers can enjoy faster internet connection outside home all day for just an additional 150 per month. That is, if you\u2019re within a PLDT WiFi hotspot.\n\nPLDT Telpad S7-Slim and its box\n\nAn existing PLDT plan subscriber may avail the Telpad for an additional fee (depends on your current plan).\n\nAnd oh, PLDT is offering a promo for their TelPad. Get a free myPhone or a Samsung phone upon subscription to a Telpad plan. This is a must-try and I assure you that you\u2019ll never regret in owning a PLDT Telpad.\n\nYou may visit to know more about the PLDT Telpadfor the detailed specs of each Telpad unit.\n\nMore from my site\n\n  \u2022 Huawei Mediapad Review: The Cheap but powerful Android tablet As we all know, the year of the Water Dragon is finally here!

        "text":"Clicky Keyboard\n\nAbout 3 years ago I once again found my self needing a new keyboard because my old one had some keys that stopped working. That\u2019s how they always seemed to fail on me other than the one brand new one I dumped orange juice on. Zero out of 5 stars, not recommended.\n\nWhen we were near a few local electronics stores I tried out the ones they had but hey all had the smaller keys like laptop with no movement and no \u201cfeel\u201d. I learned to type on a typewriter when I was a kid and my muscle memory learned that you have to push the keys until you feel it click.\n\nWhile cleaning out the attic I came across an old ibm type keyboard but it didn\u2019t work. It was the kind that you\u2019d wake the neighbor up when typing! That\u2019s when my search began..\n\nI discovered that you can still buy mechanical keyboards! There were lots of choices some of which are very expensive. They were even available with LED keys! I don\u2019t look at the keyboard at all when I\u2019m typing (again I learned to type in elementary school) unless I am looking for a specific symbol that I rarely use. I ended up settling on a Deck Hassium Pro White LED Mechanical Keyboard which has been the best one I\u2019ve used for typing in decades. It just works. No missing key strokes or random letters added like I\u2019ve always had in the past. My fingers are fat and tend to bump the keys to the side sometimes. It\u2019s much more comfortable to type on and my accuracy has greatly improved but it didn\u2019t help my spelling. It has a legit USB cord that seems like it would be impossible to break but I do wish you could disconnect it and use your own. I also get the feeling the keyboard itself is sturdy enough to last as long as I want to use it.\n\nI definitely feel like keyboards like many other things have devolved to be more about form over function. Thanks Apple!",

        "text":"I drive a 2006 Hyundai Tiburon with the J290 stereo and six CD changer. If you have this stereo or a similar such stereo you know how it \u201cremembers\u201d what track was playing and exactly where it was playing when you turn it off and back on or switch to the radio. Anyway, this morning, in haste before starting the car or even turning the key to the accessories position, I wanted to swap out the six CDs in the stereo and thus I ejected all of them by simply pressing the eject button. The battery can handle powering the eject mechanism, right?\n\nSure enough, the CDs ejected fine, but after I started the car and headed out of my neighborhood I noticed something funny. The stereo displayed that it still had all six CDs loaded and that it had cued up a particular disc, a particular track, at an exact time. \u201cHey, it remembered where I left off at least!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s just a glitch,\u201d I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll simply press the load button and put a new CD in there to clear it up.\u201d Nope. The stereo would have none of that. In fact, the stereo\u2019s CD menus were completely frozen; it would not allow me to do anything with the CD changer, but the radio worked just fine. \u201cOkay, when I get to my destination I\u2019ll pull the fuse to the stereo, which will reset the stereo, and then I\u2019ll have my beloved bass-thumping stereo back.\u201d Nope. That didn\u2019t work either.\n\nOnce I finally got home at the end of the day I detached the battery. That did the trick. Everything appears to be functioning normally, though I need to reset the clock and my radio presets.\n\nThis reminds me of a few PCs and laptops I\u2019ve used over the years that wouldn\u2019t shutdown, even after depressing the power button, and would only turn off after disconnecting the power cable or yanking the battery from the laptop.\u00a0 Conjure up in your imagination any of several images from the Terminator or Matrix movies to see the future of where we\u2019re going with technology that won\u2019t behave!\u00a0 Or maybe we humans will wind up being the oppressors of non-compliant technology as in the flesh fair scene in A.I.",

        "text":"Wednesday, August 18, 2010\n\nAA Battery..You Don't Know What It Is??\n\nWoo..just watched the Semi Final Badminton Men's Singles between Malaysian Loh and a Thailand player. Loh played really well in the second set, before he got his right leg injured but he didn't give up that set. He forfeited the match during the interval of the rubber set trailing 3-10. He did good and needless to say I'm proud as a Malaysian. I hope he will make his own mark in the world stage in the future.\n\nOkay, that's not what I wanna blog about tonight. But about AA batteries. You do know what are AA batteries, don't you? Come on! I know nowadays people don't walk around listening to walkmans which in the past when I was in secondary school, still cool and uses AA batteries, most of them. And I know, cameras now come with rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Well most of them I guess. Because mine which I bought in 2007 at Morwell's DickSmith uses AA batteries!\n\nYou know a digicam uses AA batteries if it has that 'big belly' coming out.\n\nWhen I cleaned up my room I found this ancient relic...\n\nGrandcell Rechargeable Batteries and the Charger!!\n\nI don't remember how many rechargeable batteries and normal batteries we have here in this house. Or how many did we buy just to replace the used, and the missing batteries. I remember the first time I had rechargeable batteries, those were for my mini racing cars. You do know or remember if you're born in the '80s... Tamiya? Auldey? Dash Yonkuro? LOL okay. Anyway, the batteries I used, were the Panasonic Rechargeable and if you ask me, I think they are the best looking batteries of all time. Got this dark blue, purple colours covering the battery. (Now just wait...was it Panasonic or Philips??) Used to have the charger but have no idea where has it gone to now..Those stuffs were expensive! Still are I reckon.\nThe new looks. [Panasonic Malaysia] and [Philips]\n\nNow, where were we...Ahah! Yes, and then got Grandcell, which was a hit last time. Everywhere got advertisements - on TV, billboards. But they didn't last as long as Panasonic (or Philips). And after awhile, my mini racing cars were collecting dust..and eventually went missing..don't know how..maybe got abducted by the aliens. =__= I was so sad actually..those cars cost a lot of money and time too. *sigh* =P\n\nBut when my dad bought a digicam which was at the time freaking expensive, for a 4MP camera, he bought this -\n\nIt was great. At least for a couple of years when one day, we found out the batteries melted and somehow corroded the metal part of the battery compartment and since then the camera doesn't function normally. Oh, it was a Kodak digicam in case you were wondering.\n\nRechargeable batteries seem troublesome I guess, when nowadays you can just charge your iPod on your computer. Well, I believe you still plug digicam battery at power points. But I came across this USBCell. Rechargeable batteries that can be charged on your computer!\n\nCool, no? So, open the cap, and plug the battery in your USB port, be it on the computer, laptop, game station like Xbox 360 and PS3, and can also be used with other rechargeable battery stations. But need to check at the website if it's compatible or not.\n\nNow that everyone is trying to live green, USBCell will surely get to attract a lot of buyers. Plus with these cute singing bunnies in this ad, parents will have hard times dealing with their children asking them to buy the batteries.\n\nIt's one funny and creative ad. And bunnies with rabies - not cool and I'm kinda scared of them.. =P\nFrom what I read on the website the batteries can be delivered to Malaysia. Check out the site for more details if you're interested. I certainly am going to grab one of these - when I get a job. Wish me luck!\n\n\nNo comments:\n\n\nRelated Posts with Thumbnails",

        "text":"A weekend of #WP7 use \u2013 first impressions, comparison to\u00a0#iPhone\n\nI wrote on Friday about my switch from iPhone to Windows Phone 7. I am now a proud (really proud) owner of a Samsung Focus Windows Phone from AT&T. (side note: see how easy it is to refer to Windows Phone? No need to say Windows 7 Phone, Windows Phone 7 Phone, Windows Mobile 7, Windows 7 Mobile, etc. Just go with Windows Phone. That easy)\n\nI had talked about what I use on the iPhone\u00a0and here is my list of things I have done on my Windows Phone:\n\n  1. First and foremost, I cleaned up my hotmail contacts and also hooked up facebook, flickr, linkedin, yelp, wordpress, and more. (This was done earlier, in anticipation of my move to Windows Phone.)\n  2. I signed in with my Live ID and set up my personal account (google apps) for email, hotmail for contacts and email, facebook for contacts, photos and feeds, other gmail for email and calendar. All went well and in a few moments my phone was being \u201clit up\u201d with information from various places that I did not even have to care about.\n  3. I downloaded the common, popular apps like:\n    1. YouTube\n    2. Facebook\n    3. Twitter\n    4. Seesmic\n    5. Adobe Reader\n    6. Breaking News\n    7. DirecTV\n    8. Fandango\n    9. Flixster\n    10. Foursquare\n    11. Last.fm\n    12. IMDb\n    13. iheartradio\n    14. Netflix\n    15. Shazam\n    16. Slacker Radio\n    17. TED\n    18. UStream Viewer\n    19. Weatherbug\n  4. Then I went and downloaded a bunch of games from the Marketplace \u2013 happens to be that most of the games (perhaps all) are XBOX Live enabled. I am not an XBOX user yet so I was aslo able to set up my own XBOX Live Avatar.\n  5. Most of the games I downloaded, had a trial mode and I did go with the trial mode for those games. I have converted to paid on a few games already. Trial mode is simply fantastic, especially for games and especially for kids games where I can see if it is going to fly with the kids or not and then decide to put the $ down.\n\nAs you can see most of the big, common apps are already there and I am really not missing a beat.\n\nI can say my needs are completely met (and exceeded in a lot of cases) except the following apps\/scenarios:\n\n  1. Corporate email. Of course, my iPhone was a huge factor in my corporate email\/calendar management. I am going to miss this feature the most. However there are multiple things to consider here \u2013 I have an iPad which is provisioned for corporate email and calendar, so I can use that when I am not at work. Also, it is only a matter of time before Windows Phone gets the at-rest encryption which will then make it feasible to get corporate email on it. Not a huge concern, in general.\n  2. Notifications. Even though Windows Phone provides multiple types of notifications (toaster alert like the SMS app does, Live Tiles like the Weatherbug app does and push notifications), common apps like facebook and twtter\/seesmic have not implemented any notification method yet. This is an app maker\u2019s problem so I am positive the next iterations of these apps will take care of this issue. However I like the simplicity and features of Boxcar and I hope they get their app over to Windows Phone.\n  3. ESPN. I did not realize how much I used the ESPN ScoreCenter app on the iPhone. This weekend I wanted to keep track of multiple close Pac-10 football games and the website was simply not as efficient as the app is. I wish this app comes really fast and given how cutting edge ESPN has been until now, I don\u2019t doubt at all that a sexy-looking app is coming soon.\n  4. HippoRemote. For now I am not concerned much because the iPad takes care of it.\n  5. Amazon. Again, like ESPN I feel the app is much more efficient to use than the website and again, I am pretty sure these guys will release the app soon.\n  6. In-browser videos\/flash-HTML5. This is quite an annoyance because even browsing to the ESPN website for example, from the iPad, plays videos in the page because they have made those videos HTML5-compliant. But the mobile IE browser does not support HTML5 and Windows Phone does not support flash or silverlight in the browser. So this is truly something I have to wait for Microsoft to deliver, hopefully in their next update.\n  7. Another big problem in the OS is that it cannot connect to wireless networks that are hidden. I do not broadcast my SSID and now I have to, hopefully again, only up to the upcoming update.\n\nOn the other hand, there are plenty of small things on the phone that made my smile. Simple stuff like the back button \u2013 I opened twitter, clicked on a tweet which had a link, clicked on the link and opened the browser. After I was done reading, I closed the browser and clicked the back button and I came back to the opened tweet in twitter. Small thing, but so cool.\n\nAnother thing \u2013 the voice command and voice search is FANTASTIC. I have not had a single incorrect interpretation of my voice command. Love it.\n\nI could go on and on about how awesome the phone is, but this post is not about that. As you can see, the switch from the iPhone is going to be a good one and hopefully in the upcoming WP7 update as well as some of the app updates (or releases) most of my pending concerns would be addressed.\n\n\n\n7 thoughts on \u201cA weekend of #WP7 use \u2013 first impressions, comparison to\u00a0#iPhone\n\n  1. Anjin L. says:\n\n    Im looking towards getting the Samsung focus, for now i have the Htc surround and the battery life is my main reason for considering leaving it. I\u2019ve done all the email sync\u2019ing changes and such to increase it which it did but after 8 hours it requires a charge and im not happy about that. I\u2019m hoping the Focus can at-least make it till bedtime.\n\n  2. Anjin L. says:\n\n    Romit what is normal usage for you? I\u2019ve actually gotten attached to this htc phone and i might just wait it out till a extended battery is available.\n\n  3. Romit Mehta says:\n\n    Anjin: Normal usage is about 5-10 phone calls per day of less than 5 minutes. Data usage limited to emails and twitter. Twitter usage very high. I am in good at&t coverage at home, at work and everywhere in between so signal strength is not an issue. Hope this helps.\n\n  4. Anjin L. says:\n\n    Thank you. Well after a few weeks now and some more research, appearently the htc surround battery life improves with use and time to which i can vouch for. I pretty much a full days worth og phone. Thank you for your input and this phone is great!!!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Taken on the 5 mega pixel option with 50% zoom and iso200. Scope used was the Celestron 4 Se with 26mm EP and 2xBarlow. Not bad, do like the way the colours came out in the images taken and all i had to do was fiddle a little in Gimp2 to bring them out more. Found my U600 was easier to use but might get some better results when i get more time to fiddle around with the settings. Unlike the U600 i had to use the Moon filter in some as it was just too bright, could just be a setting i haven't found yet.\nGetting hooked on this mobile phone experminenting. Now what phone could i try next\n\n\nRainer said...\n\nHi Karah,\n\nI really like these moon shots. Well done :).\n\n\nkarah said...\n\nThanks Rainer,\n\nAs i said, getting hooked on this mobile phone imaging.....",

        "text":"Amazon\u2019s Latest Line of Kindle Fire Tablets on Sale Again\n\n\nEither hardware sales are slow at Amazon or they\u2019ve got an excess of stock because the entire line of Kindle Fire tablets is on sale once again.\n\nSales have become so frequent over the past few months there really is no reason to pay full price. Ever. Just wait for the next sale to come along.\n\nAmazon is also offering a Kindle payment plan to some customers where they only charge 20% of the device up front, and then you pay the remaining balance in four monthly installments. There is no interest or extra fees with this option.\n\nAs for the Kindle Fire sale, here\u2019s the rundown on the numbers:\n\n7\u2033 Kindle Fire HD \u2013 Sale price: $119 ($20 off regular price)\n\n7\u2033 Kindle Fire HDX \u2013 Sale price: $199 ($30 off regular price)\n\n8.9\u2033 Kindle Fire HDX \u2013 Sale price: $339 ($40 off regular price)\n\nThis is a limited-time offer that could expire at anytime (I don\u2019t see a date anywhere).\n\nAdditionally, Best Buy has the Kindle Paperwhite on sale this week for $99 ($20 off retail) and the basic Kindle for $49 (also $20 off), along with the Kindle Fire tablets. Staples has the entire line of Kindle devices on sale too.\n\nComments are closed.",

        "text":"News Archives\n\niPad: Getting Beyond The Simplistic Consumption vs Creation Dialectic\n\nBlogger Fraser Spiers says when the iPad first launched, many people opted for a quick analysis that it was a device \u201conly for content consumption,\u201dobserving that despite time and experience having proven those people quite obviously wrong, debate seems to persist as to what the iPad is, precisely, for.\n\nSpiers thinks the iPad can now serve satisfactorily for about 80% of all tasks you can conceivably do on a computer. Your editor would peg it more at 50%-50% based on empirical real-world experience, but its a moving target and your mileage may vary of course.\n\nSpiers is probably correct, however, that the consumption\/creation split is far too simplistic a curve to grade these devices on, that there\u2019s far more subtlety that we can reach for, and that we have to move beyond simplistic arguments about consumption and creation, proposing that we can instead look at the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 for each type of device along two axes: task complexity and task duration.\n\nTask duration is the more obvious of the two: how long of a continuous period will you be using your device for the task.\n\nTask complexity requires a little more unpacking\u2026..\n\nYou can check it out at:\n\nCheck our price trackers for the most recent prices.

        "text":"Tag Archives: iPaf 4th gen\n\nDo You Want a 128GB iPad?\n\n128GB iPad\n\nWould you be interested in an iPad with 128GB of storage?\u00a0 It looks like we may soon be seeing one if 9to5Mac and their un-named sources are correct. They say Apple is preparing to release a single additional iPad model, as an additional model in the iPad 4th gen lineup.\n\nHere\u2019s their sum-up on what\u2019s know about this new model:\n\n    \u2022 It is a fourth-generation iPad, not a new design.\n    \u2022 It comes in both the current black and white color options.\n    \u2022 It comes in both WiFi-only and WiFi + Cellular versions.\n    \u2022 It is a more premium SKU that will join the current line of 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB fourth-generation iPads.\n    \u2022 10-pack deals (in both colors) for educational institutions will be offered.\n\nIn an update on their original post, 9to5Mac have said prices will be $799 for a WiFi only model and $929 for WiFi + Cellular. There is also some speculation that this new model might be for specific markets \u2013 like education or government for example.\n\nIf Apple does release a 128GB iPad 4 over the next few months, would you be rushing to grab one? I think if there is no other upgrade to the iPad then I would still stick with my iPad 3 \u2013 and await a hopefully lighter, slimmer, more iPad mini like model later in the year.\n\nShare This:",

        "text":"Dell Shows off Keyboardless, Monitorless\u00a0PC\n\n\nDell has shown off a concept PC that it calls the \u201cDell Froot,\u201d boasting no keyboard and no monitor, working from projection instead.\n\nUberGizmo is carrying word of the device, which won Pauline Carlos first place in Dells\u2019 sustainable design competition. As you should be able to see from the above image, it\u2019s a relatively simple design, boasting large projector towards the back and a smaller in front. The former throws an image against a wall in a similar fashion to a standard display, while the latter throws a keyboard down onto the desk, allowing users to type directly onto the surface of their table.\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely concept, and one we\u2019re curious to see more of. Perhaps most interesting about it all though isn\u2019t anything to do with the usability, but the construction. The Froot would be built using a \u201cbiodegradable starch-based polymer,\u201d which very well fits the theme of Dell\u2019s sustainable design competition.\n\nOf course, the biggest issue with the Froot is that it\u2019s quite close to Pranav Mistry\u2019s Sixth Sense arrangement, though less portable. The major difference being that Sixth Sense is wearable and boasts a similar projection arrangement, but allows users to interact directly with various objects through the device, rather than using it as a standard PC.\n\nAdmittedly, it seems relatively unlikely that Sixth Sense will be anywhere near as environmentally friendly as Dell\u2019s Froot, but for anyone who hasn\u2019t already seen the 13ish minute presentation on it, it\u2019s well worth a look. It\u2019s among the most jaw dropping pieces of video we\u2019ve yet seen, and frankly it manages to cast a shadow across Dell\u2019s concept PC.\n\n\nTags: , , , , , , , , , ,\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
