        "text":"Go to content\n\nMain menu:\n\n\nDo you supply all your own equipment?\n\nYes, Musik Masters - Lorain Counties best dj service, supplies all the sound equipment and cables needed. Also our sound systems take up very little room. We can usually set up in an area no bigger that 15' X 6'.\n\nHow do you handle yourself on the mic?\n\nWe try not to overdue it. We feel your guests are not interested in hearing our disc jockeys ham it up over the microphone. While we make all the announcements with our microphone, it is not uncommon to see us out among your guests encouraging requests\n\nWhat kind of equipment do you use?\n\nWe use only professional \"state of the art\" disc jockey equipment. We bring back ups for the entire system. \u00a0In the unlikely event of a major failure we have a complete back up system ready to go within minutes.\n\nDo you offer lighting effects?\n\nSure, depending on the package, our lighting effects feature lasers and lights. Please check our packages page for more details!\n\nCan we meet with you?\n\nYes, if you would like. Actually we'd prefer to meet in person. Contact us and we will schedule a meeting that is convenient for you.\n\nHow much do you help coordinate events?\n\nThis has to be our strongest quality. We have found that over the years that many events need a little guidance. We help to \"host\" the event by working with your caterer, photographer, or other professionals to keep all your guests entertained and involved. From pouring champagne to arranging special dances we contribute quite a bit to how smoothly things flow.\n\nHow far in advance do we need to book?\n\nOur dates start booking out up to a year in advance. However, on many occasions we book dates as late as a couple weeks ahead of time.\n\nDo you play requests?\n\nYes. Many of our clients provide a list before the event and make special notations for \"must play\" or \"do not play\" types of songs. We also play requests your guest give us that day.\n\nWe want to book you. What do we do next?\n\nWe have a service agreement that needs to be filled out. We also require a deposit. Give us a call or email us for more information, and to hold your date.\n\nWhat if you don't have a song we want?\n\nWe'll try to get it! We take great pride in our music selection and try to have all the popular dance music. If you like you can also supply anything you wish on a thumb or flash drive.\n\nBack to content | Back to main menu",

        "text":"Help and FAQ\n\nI have not received or I accidentaly deleted the confirmation email with e-Tickets. What should I do?\nNo problem. Please contact us at and we will re-send you the e-Tickets.\n\nMy event was cancelled. Will I get my money back?\nIf the promoter cancels the event, we will send you the full amount paid for the ticket back to the account you used for payment. We understand this must be inconvenient to you and we will send the payment back to your account as soon as possible (within 30 days).\n\nMy event was moved to another day or hour. What should I do?\nIf you are comfortable with\u00a0the new time of the concert you don\u2019t need to do anything. Your ticket is valid for the new time of the concert. If the new time is inconvenient to you please contact us and we will refund the amount you paid for the ticket back to your account.\n\nI bought a ticket but cannot go to the concert. Will I get my money back?Unfortunately, in such case, the refund is not possible. The refund is possible only in the case when the event is cancelled by the promoter.\n\nI want to go to the concert with my child. Do I need to buy a ticket for him\/her?\nSome events are free of charge for small children. In such\u00a0case, this information is always written in the text of the concert, and you do not buy any ticket - the child will be allowed to the venue without the ticket. Please note, that in some cases, very small child may not have its own seat and will be seated on parent\u2019s lap.\n\nI lost\/destroyed\/damaged my ticket. What should I do?\nNo problem! Go back to your confirmation e-mail. Here, you can either print your e-Ticket attached to the email, or click on \"here\" link that will take you to Customer Summary page where you will find the \"Print e-Ticket\" icon. By clicking on the icon you will have the e-Ticket ready for printing.\u00a0Or simply come and collect your e -ticket at our shop in Prague! We need you to bring us your order number attached to your confirmation email.\n\nI booked a ticket but I could not buy it due to order security time limit expiration. What is that?\nAfter making a reservation you need to purchase the ticket within 20 minutes, otherwise your reservation expires. Simply go back to the concert, order tickets again \u00a0and complete the ordering process within 20 minutes. Please have your credit card and personal information ready to facilitate the order process and avoid order time expiration.\n\nI do not manage to print the e-Tickets. What should I do?\nPlease make sure you have the Acrobat Reader or some other printing program installed on your computer.\u00a0If not here it is one for free download. You can also collect your tickets directly at\u00a0our shop\u00a0in Prague:\n\nPrague Ticket Office - Via Musica\nStarom\u011bstsk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed 14 \/ 604\nPraha 1, 110 00\nCzech Republic\nTel.: +420 224 826 440\n\nPlease mind the opening hours:\n\nWe are open daily:\nApril - October: 10.00 - 20.00\nNovember - March: 10.00 - 18.00\n\nBring your order number attached to your confirmation email.\n\nCan I receive my e-Tickets via post?\nUnfortunately this option is not possible.\n\nI have a free seating ticket. What does it\u00a0mean?\nIn a nutshell, free seating works on first come, first served basis. We recommend\u00a0to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the event.\u00a0That way you have a better chance to get a seat you want.\u00a0\n\nWhere is the best place to sit?\nIn case of the classical concerts, we recommend\u00a0to get seats in the center of the concert hall or the church offering the best acoustic experience. Sitting in the first row need not always be the best option. This is also true for blacklight theatre performances where a greater distance offers better experience and overview. On the other hand, at chamber and jazz concerts small distance and seats in the front rows promise more intensive experience.\n\nWhen should I arrive to the event?\nWith free seating tickets we recommend to arrive 30 minutes in advance. However, please note that it does not make sense to arrive an hour in advance. Most concert halls do not open until 30 minutes before the concert beginning. For events with seating reservations 15\u00a0minutes are sufficient, however if you are visiting a large concert hall, please come also 30 minutes before.\n\nI have never been to Prague. I am afraid I won\u2019t be able to find the concert hall. What should I do?\nPlease check our list of venues.\u00a0Select the venue you are searching for and you will find the address, the map and public transport info. If you are still uncertain about the location, call our hotline. We will be happy to help.\u00a0\n\nSenior citizen and student discounts. Am I eligible to a discounted ticket?\nFor some events, a senior\u00a0discount is offered to persons over age 65. Student discount is often provided as well. In case such a discount is offered, it is given with the tickets price (if the discount is\u00a0not mentioned, it is not provided and only the full price is valid). The promoter reserves the right to request a valid ID at the entrance to the concert hall, i.e. passport showing client\u2019s right to the discount, or student ID in case of student discount.\n\nWill I pay any additional fees when entering the concert hall?\nNo, the price you pay on Prague Ticket Office - Via Musica website is a final price.\n\nIs it possible to attend the concert with an e-Ticket displayed on\u00a0my mobile phone, iphone, tablet, etc.?\nWe highly recommend to have the printed e-Ticket with you - some of the promoters do accept the tickets on the display and some of them do not.\n\nIn case you purchased vouchers, it is necessary to have the printed voucher with you and follow the instructions given on the voucher and either change the voucher for a valid ticket at the box office of the event promoter, or at the door of the event venue.\n\nDo you still need some help?\u00a0\n\nIf you have any further questions please contact us at and we will promptly respond to your request.

We take a small deposit to book the date.\n\nWe usually get booked for weddings around a year in advance but 2 years ahead has been known many times.\n\nDo we need to feed & supply drinks to the DJ?\n\nThis isn't vital but it's always very much appreciated, as an example, our DJ at a wedding will usually start setting up equipment around midday then are on their feet supplying music without a break for around 12 hours + until the party has long finished.\n\nA soft drink is always appreciated, usually the bar is 3 or 4 deep with people waiting so we are unable to queue at the bar to be served before the song that is playing has finished.\n\nCan I submit my own playlist to you?\n\nYes, We advise that you keep your playlist to around 15 \/ 20 songs maximum as we like to ensure a fair balance of music and respond to requests made at your function - Longer playlists prevent the DJ from using his skills & experience to get the most out of your party.\n\nDo you charge extra for the Disco & Karaoke at the same time?\n\nYes we do make a slight additional charge, this is only due to the extra equipment required on the evening and the longer set up times involved.\n\nAre you insured?\n\nYes, SouthSound Disco are registered \/ insured within the UK.\n\nA link is provided in the header for your convenience. If required, we will visit and show PLI & PAT Test certificates before the day of your function.\n\nHow much are you? Are there any hidden extras?\n\nSouthSound have a set fee for parties starting at 7pm until midnight. We prefer that you contact us with the details of your function first so we can give you an accurate quotation.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the only times we charge extra are:-\n\n1) If the playing time is extended from what was agreed on the original contract then an extra hourly fee will be charged.\n\n2) If the venue is located outside of the area we usually cover.\n\n3) You have also requested extra services that we supply.\n\nContact us for price information via the contact page.\n\nI'd like you to play a bit longer than we booked you for, is this a problem?\n\nThis is not a problem, although we do have to ensure the staff at the venue are happy for us to play on, they usually have strict licensing times to follow. If playing time is extended then an extra hourly fee will be payable.\n\nHow long do you require to set up?\n\nUnder normal circumstances we require about 60 minutes to set up our equipment, this may alter depending on the type of venue and access available to us.\n\nHow do I book you for my party?\n\nContact us either using the contact form on the 'Contact Us' page, a link can be found in the top right of your screen, or call us (phone numbers are provided on the contact page), let us know all the details of your party as explained on the contact form and we will reply as fast as we can with a quotation.\n\nA booking form will be sent to you and the agreed date will be provisionally booked for 14 days.\n\nReturn the booking form back to us with a deposit within the 14 days and we will send you a confirmation \/ receipt.\n\nIf you wish to arrange a meeting to discuss your party then this is always easy to arrange and welcomed.\n\nWhat music do you play?\n\nWe understand people have different tastes in music, every function is different, a wide selection of music is played during the evening to please everyone and we encourage requests.\n\nYou are welcome to submit a small playlist to us with songs \/ artists \/ music type you wish to include.\n\nA large part of a DJ's job is to read the dance floor throughout the evening and change music as it's required to maintain the energy on the dance floor.\n\nDo you take requests?\n\nRequests are always encouraged and we aim to play as many of them as possible throughout the evening.\n\nWe know our customers will understand that some music is inappropriate for some functions, we occasionally get requests we have to refuse, for example songs that may cause offence.\n\nHow do I pay?\n\nWe accept cash, cheque & BACS for the deposit but cash only on the night. Full instructions will be on the booking form that will be sent to you.\nThe remaining balance is to be paid at the beginning of the performance, if you wish to settle the balance before the evening you are welcome to do so.\n\u00a9 2021\u00a0SouthSound : All Rights Reserved",

        "text":"Audio Mastering Frequently Asked Questions\n\nExplore The SoundLAB\n\nWhy is CD mastering necessary?\n\nIn the recording studio, you record one song at a time, and the focus of the recording or mixing engineer is to make each song great. The result, however, is generally a collection of songs that all peak at different levels and may have different EQs. In the post-production phase (called Audio Mastering), a professional engineer unifies the CD by using EQ, compression, and other dynamics processing to give it a consistent sound from track to track.\n\nWhat does audio mastering do for my album\u2019s sonic quality?\n\nMastering can raise your album's overall level through the careful use of compression, so your album can compete with any major label release. The mastering engineer also ensures that your music will sound great - whether it's being played through a car stereo, a portable CD player, or a top-of-the-line stereo system. In mastering, the sound of your CD will be optimized, making it sound punchy, warm, and full, while raising the overall level (volume) and highlighting details that aren't already apparent. Mastering is also helpful for addressing issues such as \"pops,\" out-of-phase tracks, and overall noise reduction. Hear what audio mastering could do for your music.\n\nHow does having the SoundLAB review my master help me?\n\nA fresh pair of ears can be the difference between a good-sounding CD and a great one. A real advantage of mastering is that an unbiased sound professional has the opportunity to evaluate your master and determine how to get the most out of your production. After you've spent weeks or even months in a recording studio listening to your CD over and over again, a fresh pair of ears can put the project into perspective for you and let you know whether or not your CD will benefit from post production. After all, you only have one chance to make your music sound its best. Get a FREE audio mastering review.\n\nWhat formats of audio master do you accept?\n\nWe can accept your master on one of the following formats:\n\n  \u2022 Audio CD\n  \u2022 Data files (wav, aiff, FLAC, etc.) on CD-R, DVD-R, flash drive, or via upload.\n  \u2022 Digital Audio Tape (DAT)\n  \u2022 DDP file set (on CD-R, DVD-R, flash drive, or via upload)\n  \u2022 1\/2\" or 1\/4\" Analog Tape\nHandle all masters carefully, both before and after recording. Touch CDs only by the edges and keep them free of fingerprints and scratches that can cause data errors. Make sure your master is clearly with your contact information. Learn more about preparing a physical master for replication.\n\nDoesn\u2019t CD mastering cost a lot?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to. Disc Makers' SoundLAB is the best value in the workflow of making a CD. The mastering that costs you $45 per track at the SoundLAB can cost you anywhere from $800 to $2,500 at other post production studios. For a fraction of the cost of other major mastering studios, the SoundLAB gives you access to equipment that will help make your music sound like the pros - our engineering staff has the gear and the talent to rival the best studios in the country. We'll make your music ready for commercial release and your project will receive the individual care and attention it deserves. See all of our pricing.\n\nDo I get to listen to my CD after the mastering is done?\n\nAbsolutely. We\u2019ll send you an audio reference CD or electronic proof online for you to listen to and review. It\u2019s the perfect time to compare how much mastering can do for your album. Listen to your original CD master after listening to your audio reference and you\u2019ll hear the difference. Crisper highs, thundering lows and punchy mids bring your vision to life.\n\nCan I master my own CD?\n\nYes, but unless you\u2019re a mastering engineer it\u2019s not recommended. It takes a highly trained ear and years of technical expertise to properly master an album. But you\u2019re in luck. Our mastering engineers are some of the finest in the industry. With extensive knowledge in both the newest gear and numerous styles of music, you\u2019re in good hands. Meet our audio mastering engineers.\n\nShould I keep a copy of my original audio master?\n\nYes. It is always recommended that you keep a copy of your original master; this is called a safety copy. A safety copy can be crucial if you master is damaged during shipping to us. Plus, it\u2019s great to compare against your new master after the mastering process.\n\nWill you preview my master for Free?\n\nAbsolutely. We're so confident that our Mastering can make a huge difference in the majority of recordings, that we are offering a FREE Master review - upon request - when you place a new CD replication order. As part of our mission to make your CD project a success, a SoundLAB engineer will preview your Audio Master to determine whether or not your CD would benefit from post production. Call us and we'll give you our honest opinion, with no sales pitch. Get your FREE audio mastering review.\n\nWhat else do you need besides my audio master?\n\nYou must complete a SoundLAB Questionnaire and Track Listing Form with your audio master. Required information on the Track Listing Form includes a complete and accurate running time log listing all events (tones, silences, songs, outtakes, noises, etc.) as they occur. The SoundLAB questionnaire gives you the opportunity to provide us some important information that we can reference when mastering your project. Things such as overall volume, EQ, editing, and spacing preferences, or other artists or recordings you like the sound of, should be provided here for the engineer working on your project. For CDs, the maximum length is 79:45 minutes. For programs over the industry recommended 78:00 total time, you must submit a signed disclaimer form with your order. Click here to download the Track Listing Form.\n\nWhy should I choose the SoundLAB over another mastering studio?\n\nThere are a number of reasons to choose the SoundLAB for your mastering. With years of experience on the highest-quality industry gear, we\u2019ve mastered both the techniques and equipment in order to provide you with a superior service. Plus, you\u2019ll pay a fraction of what you would at another mastering studio all while receiving exceptional service and attention to detail.\n\nWill mastering help me get an advantage in the marketplace?\n\nYou bet. A properly mastered CD gives you radio-ready sound that is sonically equivalent to any major label release. By having mastering done to your album you provide a higher quality product with consistent tonal quality across the board, something radio DJs expect and discerning fans appreciate.\n\nWhat if I\u2019m not happy with the audio mastering after it\u2019s done?\n\nNo problem. We are so confident that you\u2019ll love your mastering that if you\u2019re not satisfied you pay nothing. We\u2019ll just do a straight transfer of your original master.\n\nWhat type of gear do you work on?\n\nThe SoundLAB at Disc Makers has consistently remained at the forefront of technology so your album will sound its best. Our industry-leading mastering studios offers you access to some of the most advanced mastering gear ever produced, at a fraction of the price of the world's other leading Mastering houses.

However, Disc Makers does offer the highest quality products and the best guarantee in the business for all of your post-mastering needs. See our disc packages.\n\nIs mastering relevant if I'm distributing my album digitally?\n\nWithout a doubt, yes. Mastering is always an important part of the creative process, and when your music is downloaded by a listener and loaded onto their MP3 player your songs will often be added to playlists with recordings from many other artists. Any deficiency in the Mastering on your songs will be readily apparent. Things like lack of level, EQ issues, noise, etc. can be quite noticeable when your songs are played alongside releases from major label artists.

        "text":"What is Social TV?\n\n\u2026And where have YOU been?\n\n\nThe idea of socializing around a source of light and recreation has been around since the discovery of fire. After fire, there was the radio and \u2013 after that \u2013 we would gather around the television. It\u2019s not an alien concept, but it is one we have seen greatly diminish over time.\n\nPeople still want to watch their shows, but they want to do it on their own time and their own terms. Viewership for live broadcasts has been declining over the years as major carriers lose their ratings to streaming services like Hulu. Social TV is a way for carriers to revive the social aspect of good old-fashioned sit-and-watch\u2026on a technological slant.\n\nCyber Socializing in Front of the TV\n\nLots of shows use various forms of Social TV to enhance viewing and increase viewership. Among the most interactive TV shows are:\n\n  \u2022 BBC\u2019s Free Speech \u2013 where viewers can tweet in real-time their approval or disapproval of various panelists.\n  \u2022 American Idol \u2013 currently fielding a program that lets Facebook users vote for their favorite contestants for free.\n  \u2022 Person of Interest \u2013 often displays the title of the episode or show with a hashtag to encourage mass proliferation across social media networks (more on that).\n  \u2022 The Walking Dead \u2013 uses a service called Story Sync to provide supplemental materials relevant to an episode\u2019s premier (more on that, as well).\n\nAll of these things \u2013 remarking on the validity of a panelist, voicing who you think is a better singer, telling your friends about a show \u2013 these were things people did in front of the television before social media and the internet were a reality. Social TV seeks a return to these but through leveraging sprawling social media networks and technology.\n\n\nBack in the day, before crazy sci-fi stuff like Twitter and Facebook, you used to have to hear about a show from literal word-of-mouth. You would come into work and a colleague would tell you about how Wesley Crusher was the best thing to ever happen to Star Trek. Either you would be very interested depending on their pitch or you wouldn\u2019t.\n\nYour ears would certainly perk up the next time the name was mentioned and you might even pause your discman whenever a commercial came on. You might even take them up on their offer to watch an episode at their place. That was how things usually spread.\n\nThe hashtag \u2013 this thing (#) \u2013 is something that has been heavily employed by shows like Bones, Breaking Bad and Fringe, and it operates on the same principal. Major social media outlets like Twitter catalogue and organize posts with hashtags in common so instead of you telling a dozen friends about a show, literally millions of people could be talking about the same thing. Not only could you socialize with a bigger community about television, it also served as a form of free advertising.\n\nSupplemental Viewing\n\nShows like Falling Skies and the aforementioned The Walking Dead all make use of supplemental viewing or \u201csecond screen\u201d experiences. These second screen experiences sync up to a live broadcast of an episode and provide viewers with additional content including trivia, background information and other things viewers can\u2019t get from Hulu.\n\nThey serve as the proverbial carrot on the stick and, as recent years have shown, many viewers have risen to the bait. The second screen experience transforms viewing experience from just sitting around to actively participating in one form or another. It draws you in.\n\nSocial TV on the Rise\n\nLots of newer televisions on the market ship with apps to social media outlets like Facebook and the like. As the years roll on, more carriers adopt forms of integration and interaction. Some people may still wish to watch TV on their own terms and, for that, there will always be a market for Hulu and Netflix. However, the temptation to sit-and-watch has never been greater.\n\nAbout the author",

You listen to it through headphones while moving around a city.\n\n  \u2022 Can I listen to it at home, in the car or on the bus\/train\/ferry?\n\nTechnically, yes. But ideally you should listen to it outside in an urban environment.\n\n  \u2022 So not in a rural or suburban area?\n\nMembers of the creative team have experienced the show while walking in quiet streets and it still works, but somewhere busier is better. We made the show in collaboration with a researcher who looks at how global and local things come together specifically in cities, so it\u2019s designed to be experienced in a city.\n\n  \u2022 Any particular city you had in mind?\n\nNot at all. You can experience the show anywhere in the world. And we\u2019d love to know where The Other City has been listened to, so please get in touch afterwards and tell us where you are using #TheOtherCity on social media.\n\n  \u2022 Where do I have to go?\n\nThe show can be started absolutely anywhere you like. During the podcast itself, where you go is totally up to you.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What sort of experience is The Other City?\n\nThe show is quite relaxed and asks you to think and reflect. You won\u2019t need to run anywhere! Some people have said they found it mindful.\n\n  \u2022 How long will it take me?\n\nFrom start to finish it should take you between 45 and 60 minutes.\n\n  \u2022 Do I have to do it by myself?\n\nAgain, that\u2019s up to you but we\u2019d recommend it as in individual experience. That said, we have held events where groups of people start in the same place and then come back together again at the end to share their experience, which worked very well.\n\n  \u2022 Where can I download \u2018The Other City\u2019?\n\n\u2018The Other City\u2019 is available through all major podcast providers. See for details.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What are the events in Newcastle & Sheffield?\n\nIn April we are holding special meet the team events at Alphabetti Theatre in Newcastle (6th April) and at Theatre Deli in Sheffield (13th April). Here you can come and do the show from 2-3pm then return to the theatre and meet members of the creative team plus other people who have just done the show. We\u2019d love to meet you there.\n\nComments are closed.",

        "text":"General Questions\n\nWhat is RouteNote?\nRouteNote is a solution, powering music distribution to a global market. Through RouteNote all music rights holders (large, medium, and small) can register their content and manage its distribution all in one place.\n\nWhy RouteNote?\nOur mission is to provide a simple solution for both ends of the music tree, so that more music can be provided to more people through more outlets. RouteNote allows artists\/labels to be in control of their own destiny.\n\nIs my relationship with RouteNote exclusive?\n\nNo. Registering your songs with RouteNote does not inhibit your ability to get signed to a label. RouteNote will never prevent you from doing anything you want with your music.\n\nFor YOUR sake, please note: If you sign two digital distribution deals with two companies that will both be sending the same album to iTunes, Rhapsody, eMusic, Limewire, etc. - this will hurt you, because the retailer will usually remove the album completely until you decide which distributor has the exclusive right to be selling that album through them.\n\nHow much does RouteNote Cost?\nRouteNote has 2 options for artists:\n1. Free - Artists keeps 85% of the revenues.\u00a0\n2. Premium - $10 single, $20 EP, $30 album and $45 extended album. Then $9.99 annually. Artist keeps 100% of the revenues.\n\nCan I Get Signed By A Record Label After I Have Signed Up To RouteNote?\nYes. RouteNote doesnt tie up any of your rights. Thus, allowing you to sign with a record label after signing up to RouteNote.\n\nWhat Percentage Of Sales Do We Receive?\n\nRouteNote currently offers artists 85% of all net revenues from the sales of their recordings from our retail partners. RouteNote is currently one of the world leaders in providing the highest possible revenues to artists.\n\nWill RouteNote sign more retail partners in the future?\nYes. RouteNote is here to help artists spread the word of their music to all four corners of the globe. Our forward looking partnership team are always on the look out for promising deals that will enhance our artists potential.\n\nArtist \/ Label Questions\n\nWhat Percentage Of Sales Do We Receive?\nIf artists choose to use our Free option then the artist receives 85% of all net revenues from the sales of their recordings from our retail partners.\nIf artists choose to use our Premium option then the artist receives 100% of all net revenues from the sales of their recordings from our retail partners.\nRouteNote are currently one of the world leaders in providing the highest possible revenues to artists.\n\nWhen do I receive payment?\n\nOnce the balance on your Earnings page has reached the minimum threshold amount (USD$50), then you will receive the amount owed 45 days after the end of the month that the amount was earned in. For Example if you are owed $100 earned from November then the amount will be received by you before the 15th of January.\n\nIs there a minimum payout amount?\nYes. Currently there is a minimum payout amount for artists of $50 US Dollars. Once this threshold is met then you are eligable for payment.\n\nHow can I receive payment?\nCurrently RouteNote only has one option for artists to accept payments, Paypal. To edit this information you need to visit your payment profile in your Account Details section of your account.\n\nHow long does it take before my music will be visible on our retail partners sites?\nThis option varies depending on which retail partner you have accepted. However, most retail partners normally work on a 1 - 2 week moderation process. RouteNote works on between 1 and 2 days moderation\/admin process, therefore making the final distribution lengths between 3 and 4 weeks.\n(These time scales are very loose, we have be known to have releases up as little as two weeks after upload. The fewer problems at upload, the quicker the distribution.) \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy am I not seeing my stats updated daily\nStatistics on RouteNote aren't updated daily or in real time, this is because our retail partners only send us their statistics on either a monthly or quarterly basis. Please remain patient and your stats are updated as soon as we receive them.\n\nWhat currency do I get paid in?\nUS Dollars. Currently all payments from RouteNote are paid in US Dollars. However, since we are paying artists via Paypal, it makes it very easy for artists to transfer that money into any currency.\n\nHow many tracks can I upload?\nUnlimited. Currently RouteNote doesn't have a limit for how many tracks you are able to upload. However, with relation to tracks artists upload they must have full authority or ownership to designate copyright.\n\nWhat is an ISRC and how do they work?\nAn ISRC is a code that gets embeded as data into your song, it works as virtual identification and is a bit like a bar code. Without an ISRC your song could be played for free in areas which would otherwise entitle you to royalties.\n\nWhat is a UPC and how does it work?\nA UPC is very similar to an ISRC. Whereas an ISRC is a virtually embeded code, a UPC is a physical bar code used for the whole album\/collection of songs. UPCs are found on anything for sale, in shops, supermarkets etc.\n\nHow do I get my ISRCs and UPCs?\n\nWe are pleased to announce that as of 01 August 2009 RouteNote.com will be able to provide all clients from all territories ISRCs and UPCs, saving up to $75 for some users!\n\nJust follow upload instructions for code issuing!\u00a0\n\nWhy can't I see my sales in \"My Stats\"\nPartners (such as iTunes) normally release their official sales 45 days after the close of every month. Once we receive these reports RouteNote then adds the sales statistics to your account. For example, if you sell a track in May then iTunes won't release their report until 15th July at the earliest. RouteNote input stats immediately once recevied.\n\nWhat file formats should I prepare for uploading?\n\nAudio: RouteNote can only accept MP3 files with a sample rate of 44.1khz. The bitrate of the MP3 can be anything above 192kbps, however, we recommend users to use 320kbps for the highest quality.\nCover Art: Album artwork files must be 1425x1425 pixels square and must be in .jpeg\/.jpg format.\u00a0\n\nBusiness Development\n\nIf I would like to partner with RouteNote either to license the RouteNote catalogue or to apply to get my music licensed.\nThank you for your RouteNote business inquiry.

When they sign-up using your referral information you automatically qualify for 2% of their earnings from all releases under our Free Model. But don't worry!

We also do book other freelance DJs, but they have all been screened in advance and meet the same high quality of Accent Music Makers.\n\nQuestion? Why is Jackie Navin Entertainment a better choice than a band?\nFirst of all, DJ entertainers have always been known to provide a wider variety of music than a band.\u00a0Accent Music Maker's \u00a0DJs can play anything from Tommy Dorsey to Do-Wop, Dirty Dancing to Disco, or even today's top dance hits all by the original artists.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Accent Music Maker's\u00a0DJs play continuous music throughout the entire event without taking breaks.\n\nQuestion?

        "text":"Right, listen up!\n\nWe get asked the same questions quite a lot. It's easier if we just write down the answers here, that way we don't have to add you to \"the list\".\n\n\nTrouble Listening?\n\nI can't find JACK Radio\u00a0on my radio. What's going on?\n\nHave you retuned your DAB radio? We're new in town, so you may need to hit the refresh button so your radio can find us.\n\n\nYep, I've retuned. Any other tips?\n\nCheck to make sure it's a DAB+ radio. We're only available on DAB+ - anything more is just being a show off. If your radio is more than four years old, chances are it might not support DAB+. Search your radio model online to be sure (or check the manual if you're feeling retro).\n\n\n\nI've retuned and it's a DAB+ radio. Still nothing. What now?\n\nIf you live in a rural area, under a rock or in a hermit's cave, you may not be able to get us. We tried our hardest, but not all of the UK can pick us up on DAB+. To check your area, click here and enter your postcode - a list of all the stations you can get on DAB will show up.\n\n\n\nWhat is JACK Radio?\n\nJACK Radio is a new\u00a0national radio station with a twist \u2013 playing 100% female artists.\n\n\n\nWhy launch a radio station playing only female artists?\n\nFor decades, music lovers have enjoyed albums with titles such as Women of Rock, Women of Pop, Women of the 80s, Women of Soul, Women of Country. We believe it\u2019s time these women had their own radio station.\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it a bit sexist?\n\nAbsolutely not. JACK Radio is simply showcasing great female talent and offering a listening experience that\u2019s delightfully different \u2013 and one that\u2019s open to everybody.\n\n\n\nWhat are the \u2018Cover Girls\u2019 songs?\n\nJACK Radio\u2019s \u2018Cover Girls\u2019 songs are well-known tracks covered by female artists; and not all of them are famous singers. JACK Radio is constantly on the lookout for new talent, giving women of all ages and genres an incredible opportunity to have their voices heard across the UK.\n\n\n\nWhy have women covering male songs? \u00a0\n\nThe \u2018Cover Girls\u2019 songs cover all types of songs, not only male songs, but songs from other female artists and groups as well. They\u2019re familiar, but new \u2013 and we think that\u2019s a great combination! Some covers might even be better than the originals!\n\n\n\nIs music all you play?\nNot at all.\u00a0Since we began broadcasting, JACK Radio continues to add new elements to the mix. These include: The Tracey Cox Show (sex & relationships), The Offside Rule (football), The Wellness Hour (health & fitness), Universally Speaking (clairvoyants), Funny Girls\/The Girls of JACK (comedy), Spotlight (entertainment), and there\u2019s still more to come!\n\n\n\nAnd what about the name \u2013 isn\u2019t \u201cJACK Radio\u201d masculine for a station playing all-female artists?\n\nJACK is our name, and we love it. Besides, it\u2019s not the station name that\u2019s important; it\u2019s the brilliant songs we play that really matter.\n\n\n\nTurns out my question\u00a0isn't frequently asked. How do I get in touch with JACK Radio\u00a0directly?\n\nYou click here and fill in the form, or give us a call.\u00a0Lovely!\n\nYour favourite female artists.\n\nHow Long Will I Love You by Ellie Goulding\n\nPlaying the best of British.\n\nFools Gold by Stone Roses",

        "text":"Q. What does \"aedificatores\" mean?\nA. In Latin, it means \"builders\" or \"those who build up\". Wishing that we would create and build new repertoires of choral music with composers.\n\nQ. Is there age limit to join?\nA. There is no age limit.\n\nQ. May I join, although I have no previous experience to sing in a choir?\nA. We do not have any restrictions nor have auditions, those who can regularly participate in rehearsals and can prepare to sing in advance.\n\nQ. Can high school students join?\nA. We do not deny it, but night rehearsals might have negative impact on the school studies. If so, we hope to join after finishing high school.\n\nQ. If multiple of conductors have lessons, would the music consistency be lost?\nA. Some may feel so, but considering that there is no single answer to music, having multiple viewpoints should contribute musicality. Final decision is on directors (conducting) hands.\n\nQ. How much does it cost monthly and for concerts?\nA. It depends on the number of members, slightly cheaper than the average choir fees (student concession available) plus concert installment fees per month. As for scores and voice training are separate, however, full cooperation with the publisher, reasonable prices for some scores. Voice training fee may vary depending on the number of participants, but much economical than personal voice training.\nWe assume that we cover the cost of commission and other expenses by ticket sales of concerts, if a member can sell the allocated tickets, there would be no extra charges for participation. For more details, please refer to \"To Join ...\" page for the choir of your district.\n\nQ. What are the stage costumes?\nA. Based on black shirts and trousers and skirts, men wear stand collar shirts. Often we wear accessories with purple accented color of ours.\n\nQ. When I go and visit the rehearsal, should I join?\nA. No need to. Making just a visit is also welcome.\n\nNext Post",

        "text":"The location: \"Chino\" in Inglewood.\n\nQ. What is it supposed to be on the show?\n\n    A. An urban street corner outside a bar, a residential street, and a residential home.\n\nQ. Where is it supposed to be on the show?\n\n    A. In Chino, California.\n\nQ. When did we see it on the show?\n\n    A. In Episode 23 (of the second season)\u00a0\"The\u00a0O'Sea\", when Ryan goes to Chino, looking for his brother, Trey, after Trey has tried to rape Marissa on the\u00a0beach.\n\n    Ryan finds Trey in a bar, and Trey claims that Marissa came onto him, when she was drunk. Ryan doesn't know what to think.\n\n    Back outside on the street, Ryan stops at a corner to make a phone call. \u00a0He phones Marissa, and leaves a message saying he won't be going to her prom.\n\n    While he's standing at the corner, outside the bar, Ryan bumps into his old Chino girlfriend, Theresa.\n\n    As they walk down the street, towards her house, he asks her why she's in town, and she says she's visiting her mom.\n\n    They discuss their breakup, then Ryan tells her about Trey &\u00a0Marissa, and says he doesn't know who to believe.\n\n    Theresa assures Ryan that he should believe Marissa, not Trey. Ryan asks why, and Theresa says that Marissa cared enough about him to step aside when she thought he wanted Theresa.\n\n    They come to Theresa's old house, and she tells him to call Marissa, and says goodbye.\n\n    When she enters the house, out of Ryan's sight, we learn that she has a baby, who (according to her mother) \"looks more like his father every day\".\n\nQ. What is it actually in real life?\n\n    A. A street corner, a residential street, and a house.\n\nQ. Where can I find it in real life?\n\n    A. Once again, we venture into Ryan's old neighborhood of Chino, but once again the producers have yet chosen another SoCal community to stand in for the real Chino.\n\n    At other times, they have used Sun Valley, East L.A., Lawndale, and even Venice, in the place of Chino.\n\n    This time, they opted for the southwest edge Inglewood, California (just north of the city of Hawthorne).\n\n    These locations are just southwest of the interchange of the San Diego (405)\u00a0Freeway & the Century (105)\u00a0Freeway.\n\n      \u2022 The \"Chino\" corner where Ryan meets Theresa (outside the bar) is actually the southeast corner of Imperial\u00a0Highway & Grevillea Avenue, in InglewoodCA. (The camera is looking east.)\n\n(The building on that corner, at 4460 W. Imperial Highway, houses a garden equipment service.)\n\n    I shot the photos below in 2010\n\n      \u2022 When Ryan and Theresa walk down the street towards her house in \"Chino\", they are actually walking\u00a0south\u00a0down (the\u00a0east\u00a0side of)\u00a0Grevillea Avenue, in Inglewood.\n\n(In my photo below, the camera is looking north\/northeast up Grevillea, towards Imperial Highway.)\n\n      \u2022 When they reach Theresa's home, that house is actually at the northeast corner of Grevillea Avenue & 116th\u00a0Street. Although the front door faces Grevillea Ave, the address is 4485\u00a0116th Street, in\u00a0Inglewood.\n\n    (As you can see in my photos below, the house still sports the distinctive white door seen on the show.)\n\n[ Warning: This is a private home.\u00a0\u00a0Do not trespass on their property, knock on their door,\nor do anything else that might disturb the residents!\n\n    The OC producers returned to film in this same area in the show's third season.\n\n    Ryan's corner is only a few blocks east of the liquor store where Kirstin bought a bottle of booze, and just east of the cheap\u00a0motel where Kirstin goes after buying the booze (in Episode\u00a03, of season 3).\n\n    It's also just two blocks east of the Strip Club where Matt takes Ryan (in Episode\u00a09, of season 3), and is only a few blocks northeast of the Mini-Mart that Johnny tries to rob (in Episode 10, season 3).\n\n[ Be warned that this may not be the safest part of the world.\nIf you choose to venture there, exercise reasonable caution. ]\n\nQ. How the heck did you figure out where it was?\n\n    A. I\u00a0didn't. The bar sign was fake, and since it was night, there weren't many other clues to the location of that brief corner scene. And Google StreetView doesn't work on Grevillea Avenue, so I\u00a0was unable to use it to pinpoint the house.\n\n    Finally, in 2010, I got a tip from a fan, Geoff, who had tracked down the locations.

After over 80 years operating the circus, the Ringling family sold the show to the Feld family who had been involved in the business for some time.\n\nWhy did Ringling Brothers Circus close?\n\nAfter 146 years, Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey is closing for good, responding to a prolonged slump in ticket sales that has rendered the business unsustainable, according to its operator, Feld Entertainment.\n\nWhat happened to the Benzini Brothers Circus?\n\nMarlena is revealed to have died a few years before Jacob was put into the nursing home. The Great \u201cWallace Brothers \u201d Circus Train Disaster In 1903, two separate Wallace Brothers Circus trains crashed into each other. As a result of this incident, the Benzini Brothers circus is shut down.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 Question: What Are Circus Peanuts?\n\nDo any circuses still exist?\n\nThere are still circuses in the US that operate today. Some of these circuses include Loomis Bros Circus, Jordan World, Carden International, Royal Hanneford, and Carson & Barnes.\n\nWhat happened to the Ringling Brothers animals?\n\nIn 2016, pressured by animal rights activists and changing public opinion, Feld retired the last of its performing elephants. All of them\u201440 at the time\u2014were moved to a 200-acre plot of land called Ringling\u2019s Center for Elephant Conservation (CEC). One year later, the company shut down the circus for good.\n\nWhen did circus stop using animals?\n\nContemporary circus has been credited with a revival of the circus tradition since the late 1970s, when a number of groups began to experiment with new circus formats and aesthetics, typically avoiding the use of animals to focus exclusively on human artistry.\n\nAre circus animals banned in the US?\n\nIn 2018, Hawaii and New Jersey banned the use of most wild animals in both circuses and traveling acts.

It\u2019s usually a term for throwing someone (like a stowaway or an unwanted employee) off the moving circus train. It can also refer to when the circus train leaves without you (in other words, you\u2019ve been unceremoniously fired).\n\nDoes Rosie die in Water for Elephants?\n\nHe and Marlena took several horses and Rosie, and got jobs with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
