It helps listeners visualize what your intentions are. If you have lyrics in the song, put them there.\n2\/ The description can help listeners understand some of the choices you made\n3\/ You don't talk about FightClub\n4\/ The description is a great way for you to put keywords on your song ! The Electrobel Search Engine uses those ! Also google and other search engines will be able to show your page when people search for those keywords.\n\nSo where do people see my description ?\n\n1\/ On the song's page\n2\/ In the Electrobel player\n3\/ On Facebook when your song is validated (And if you allowed Ebel to post your songs on your wall)\n4\/ On Facebook when people used the SHARE link, or just copy\/pasted your song\n5\/ On the Electrobel embedded flash player for myspace or other html site\n6\/ On Google or other search Engine's results page.\n\nAs you can see filling your description is really in your best interest.\nBut all arguments aside, filling in a good description is a way of showing your involvement in the song you made. That it wasn't some auto-generated piece of garbage, but something you put your soul and thoughts into .",

Like, say, an Endorian Holocaust? Illustration courtesy of Justine Shaw, \u00a91999.\n\nHow can I contribute to this project?\n\nPlease share your ideas with us at the Star Wars Origins Message Board!\n\nAs for me personally, I spent two solid years and over a thousand hours sifting through Star Wars and related stuff, from roughly October 1999 to October 2001. Now I need to never think about it again or my brain will explode. If you'd like to contact me personally concerning something that doesn't belong in the forum, please send me an email.\n\nWhen was this website last updated?\n\nThe last tweak was on September 4, 2006. Hopefully this is the final version. For breaking news and original observations by readers, please visit the Star Wars Origins Message Board.\n\nAre you accusing George Lucas of plagiarism, or saying that Star Wars is unoriginal?\n\nExactly the opposite! The surface elements of a story are the most visible, but when you start explore how story works you quickly realize that surface elements are really the least-significant parts of a story. For instance, Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings borrows the idea of \"orcs\" from the orcneas of Beowulf. Tolkien noted in his private papers that orcs are the same creatures he called \"goblins\" in The Hobbit. He probably became unhappy with the word \"goblin\" because it derives from the French (gobelin), and he wanted to create a myth that was English. Does that mean that Tolkien ripped off Beowulf? On the other hand, if Tolkien had called his orcs \"goblins,\" would that have changed his story in any really important way? The power of a story lies mostly in how the underlying archetypes relate, not what form those archetypes take. The surface elements just need to be appealing, easy to understand, and fit together with some kind of logic.\n\nSo why borrow from inspirations at all? Star Wars is a compressed form of the epic myth, which is kind of a \"summing up\" of all the best stories and perspectives of a culture into a single story. Lucas tied together ideas from world cinema, science fiction, comic books, fantasy, westerns, fairy tales and myth. If this sounds easy, check out any of the films and television programs that tried to repeat the \"Star Wars success formula.\" Why are they so awful? Because they imitate only the surface, and the surface is almost irrelevant. The film which best repeats the inner lessons of Star Wars is The Matrix, which is carefully structured to avoid a superficial resemblance.\n\nA myth-maker's originality lies in the way they combine mostly pre-existing ideas as seamlessly and appealingly as possible. As Joseph Campbell has often said, myth is an essential tool for living. George Lucas has modernized the Universal Myth in a way people all over the world can easily connect with. That's not just hype, it's a real contribution to the world. That's why Star Wars is such a big deal.\n\nHaven't some film critics accused Lucas of being derivative?\n\nSure, but this says more about the illiteracy of film critics than about Lucas. The well-educated critics of the previous century would read The Odyssey, for instance, and think \"Ah, here's an idea from Gilgamesh, another from Egyptian mythology, and this character is from a folk tale the Semites popularized in Greece for hundreds of years before Homer was born.\" They wouldn't therefore dismiss Homer as \"derivative,\" but judge him by the craft he displayed in weaving these basic, timeless story ideas together. The modern critic rarely recognizes the literary sources behind most great movies because they're typically not well-read. But they have seen lots of movies, so they're quick to spot the riffs Lucas borrows from classic films and, misunderstanding the creative process, accuse him of being \"derivative.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, if a story feels like a blatant rip-off to you, trust your instinct to avoid investing in it emotionally. But if you're hesitant about a story you love because a naysayer points out the story's sources, relax: even the Bible, Shakespeare and the Greek tragedies were strongly grounded in earlier stories, along with all the great epics, folktales and religious scriptures from all over the world. Even our oldest written stories, dating back from the time writing was first invented around 3,500 BCE, were based on oral stories composed probably tens of thousands of years before. All great stories have deep roots. Don't let the insecure project their fear of appearing uncool onto you, bamboozling you away from what rings true in your heart. To learn best from stories you've got to trust your gut to decide which stories nourish you most, no matter how goofy they seem to anyone else. Tinky-Winky Uber Alles.\n\nThe next time a critic makes dismissive comments about a story you love, remember this: For nearly the entire history of literary criticism, from Aristotle's Poetics (340 BCE) through Horace's Ars Poetica (13 BCE) through Torquato Tasso's Discorsi dell' Arte Poetica (1587 CE), the merit of a critic's opinion was measured by the number of years they had worked successfully as an artist.\n\nHow popular is this website?\n\nAs of September 2006, this site has logged more than 800,000 unique visitors. Extreme tracking is kind enough to offer a free online report of how many people visit this website. The counter wasn't up for the first year and then I had some problems with my server, so I estimate about 20,000 more unique visitors than the reports reflect. This website is required or suggested reading for at least 35 college and high school courses that I know of. Kodansha television in Japan called it \"better than Bill Moyers\" for understanding the relationship between Star Wars and myth - high praise indeed! Origins regularly receives favorable mention from the mainstream media and was even included in Homiletic magazine, which provides 13,000 pastors with information they might include in their sermons.\n\nIf you use this website to teach a class, even if you've already contacted me, please drop a note to let me know what you're teaching and how these materials help. I'm going to start looking for a publisher for the expanded book form of this website in a few months, and I'd appreciate being able to mention your class in the proposal.\n\nCan I reprint information from this website?\n\nYes, you may reprint information (not my exact wording) from this website provided that you cite this website as a source and include a hyperlink back to this site if you print on the web. Unless a source is footnoted, this information comes from firsthand research. We're talking over a thousand hours of work here, a significant portion of which consisted of reading and watching ancient, knuckle-whiteningly terrible \"scientifiction.\" Believe, I've paid my dues. Please don't steal my work without at least crediting me. Or I'll put a pox on you. I mean, the pox may involve lawyers and cease-and-desist orders and like that, but essentially it'll be a pox.\n\nIf more than 50% of the information in your website, magazine article, book or news story is taken from this site, please either pay me, interview me or hire me to write it myself. I know it's tempting to cheat a little, but imagine the look on your bosses\/editor\/publisher's face when he receives the first of thousands of emails pointing out that one of the \"facts\" in your allegedly-cross-researched book or article was completely fabricated as an extremely-difficult-to-legally-contest trap for the unscrupulous, thus leaving your publication wide open for a copyright violation lawsuit. That would conflict with your career goals. Who knows how many of these fabrications this site is booby trapped with? You will, because you're diligent enough to check your sources.\n\nWhy did you create this website?\n\nAfter survival and relationships, what matters most to me is to write beautiful, exciting, nourishing stories. By the time I was thirty I had earnestly stumbled my way through writing a few novels, including After Kelly, Josie Has a Secret and Clown Story. I was happy with the work I'd done, but under no illusion that my books were anywhere near as potent as the stories which quickened my heart and opened my mind while I was growing up. I started to think seriously about what it would take for me to someday write a story I liked just as much. With the help of libraries and especially librarians I found three primary starting points:\n\nFirst, I faced the obstacle of lack of access to education. A bit of research quickly revealed that the most influential storytellers from throughout history usually had access to the best educations available in their time. This frustrated me because I was among the 65% of Americans who aren't fortunate enough to have the resources for even a basic college education. Luckily I came across the story of Drona and Ekalavya from the Mahabharata: A young boy named Ekalavya begs to be accepted as a student by Drona, the best archery teacher in the world. But Ekalavya is from a low caste (he's broke), so Drona refuses. Rather than becoming discouraged, Ekalavya goes off into the forest and builds a clay statue of Drona. Ekalavya trains under his Drona-statue just as if he were the real Drona. Whenever he has a question about archery he asks himself \"What would the real Drona tell me?,\" figures out the most likely answer, then follows each instruction as though Drona himself had delivered it. By training this way Ekalavya eventually becomes the equal of Arjuna, Drona's official student and the best archer in the world... (truncated)",

        "text":"Audio Mastering Frequently Asked Questions\n\nExplore The SoundLAB\n\nWhy is CD mastering necessary?\n\nIn the recording studio, you record one song at a time, and the focus of the recording or mixing engineer is to make each song great. The result, however, is generally a collection of songs that all peak at different levels and may have different EQs. In the post-production phase (called Audio Mastering), a professional engineer unifies the CD by using EQ, compression, and other dynamics processing to give it a consistent sound from track to track.\n\nWhat does audio mastering do for my album\u2019s sonic quality?\n\nMastering can raise your album's overall level through the careful use of compression, so your album can compete with any major label release. The mastering engineer also ensures that your music will sound great - whether it's being played through a car stereo, a portable CD player, or a top-of-the-line stereo system. In mastering, the sound of your CD will be optimized, making it sound punchy, warm, and full, while raising the overall level (volume) and highlighting details that aren't already apparent. Mastering is also helpful for addressing issues such as \"pops,\" out-of-phase tracks, and overall noise reduction. Hear what audio mastering could do for your music.\n\nHow does having the SoundLAB review my master help me?\n\nA fresh pair of ears can be the difference between a good-sounding CD and a great one. A real advantage of mastering is that an unbiased sound professional has the opportunity to evaluate your master and determine how to get the most out of your production. After you've spent weeks or even months in a recording studio listening to your CD over and over again, a fresh pair of ears can put the project into perspective for you and let you know whether or not your CD will benefit from post production. After all, you only have one chance to make your music sound its best. Get a FREE audio mastering review.\n\nWhat formats of audio master do you accept?\n\nWe can accept your master on one of the following formats:\n\n  \u2022 Audio CD\n  \u2022 Data files (wav, aiff, FLAC, etc.) on CD-R, DVD-R, flash drive, or via upload.\n  \u2022 Digital Audio Tape (DAT)\n  \u2022 DDP file set (on CD-R, DVD-R, flash drive, or via upload)\n  \u2022 1\/2\" or 1\/4\" Analog Tape\nHandle all masters carefully, both before and after recording. Touch CDs only by the edges and keep them free of fingerprints and scratches that can cause data errors. Make sure your master is clearly with your contact information. Learn more about preparing a physical master for replication.\n\nDoesn\u2019t CD mastering cost a lot?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to. Disc Makers' SoundLAB is the best value in the workflow of making a CD.

Listen to your original CD master after listening to your audio reference and you\u2019ll hear the difference. Crisper highs, thundering lows and punchy mids bring your vision to life.\n\nCan I master my own CD?\n\nYes, but unless you\u2019re a mastering engineer it\u2019s not recommended. It takes a highly trained ear and years of technical expertise to properly master an album. But you\u2019re in luck. Our mastering engineers are some of the finest in the industry. With extensive knowledge in both the newest gear and numerous styles of music, you\u2019re in good hands. Meet our audio mastering engineers.\n\nShould I keep a copy of my original audio master?\n\nYes. It is always recommended that you keep a copy of your original master; this is called a safety copy. A safety copy can be crucial if you master is damaged during shipping to us. Plus, it\u2019s great to compare against your new master after the mastering process.\n\nWill you preview my master for Free?\n\nAbsolutely. We're so confident that our Mastering can make a huge difference in the majority of recordings, that we are offering a FREE Master review - upon request - when you place a new CD replication order. As part of our mission to make your CD project a success, a SoundLAB engineer will preview your Audio Master to determine whether or not your CD would benefit from post production. Call us and we'll give you our honest opinion, with no sales pitch. Get your FREE audio mastering review.\n\nWhat else do you need besides my audio master?\n\nYou must complete a SoundLAB Questionnaire and Track Listing Form with your audio master. Required information on the Track Listing Form includes a complete and accurate running time log listing all events (tones, silences, songs, outtakes, noises, etc.) as they occur. The SoundLAB questionnaire gives you the opportunity to provide us some important information that we can reference when mastering your project. Things such as overall volume, EQ, editing, and spacing preferences, or other artists or recordings you like the sound of, should be provided here for the engineer working on your project. For CDs, the maximum length is 79:45 minutes. For programs over the industry recommended 78:00 total time, you must submit a signed disclaimer form with your order. Click here to download the Track Listing Form.\n\nWhy should I choose the SoundLAB over another mastering studio?\n\nThere are a number of reasons to choose the SoundLAB for your mastering.

Learn more about mastering for iTunes.\n\nCan I supply a new version of a song if I change the mix after The SoundLAB has already mastered my project?\n\nYes, you can upload the re-mixed song and we will master the new version. There is a $25 charge to master a re-mixed song. This covers the time for the engineer to recall the session, set up the analog gear we use, evaluate the new version, make any adjustments necessary to EQ, compression, etc. and create a new master and proof. Please contact the Customer Care department to have the Project Center unlocked so you may upload your new file.",
