I had dated like a banshee, and was losing hope of ever finding my true sweetheart. Michael had been divorced for several years after a long marriage. I almost cancelled our 1st date, I had been working alot and was exhausted. I am so glad I didn't. We met for drinks at Matador in W.Seattle, we were really hitting it off, especially when he mentioned that he was excited about some buffalo mozzerella he found earlier at Costco. I'm a foodie. He's a foodie. It was kismet and 3 hours later; a great 1st date! He whispered in my ear at the end of the date that \"he couldn't wait to see me again\", and we said good-bye. He texted me the next morning to thank me for a lovely night, I was giddy! I didn't hear anything after that from him for another day, but knew we had really hit it off, so I didn't think too much of it. He called me 2 days later, and I was so excited to talk with him! He told me that he'd been texting me for the last 2 days, but that I wasn't returning the texts-my phone, my darn phone was on the fritz! Needless to say, he didn't over-analyze my non texting for anything, and we've been together ever since. We got engaged in March of this year, and are getting married on July 20, 2013.",

I can not say enough how amazing our wedding was.\n\nJessica D.\n\nLike Family\n\nMy husband and I are Huntington locals and knew Harbor Club was an absolute must for our wedding day. The food is not your typical venue entree. You are eating at a five star restaurant on your wedding day. They make you feel like a celebrity but family at the same time. I wouldn\u2019t have imagined our day anywhere else!\n\nJaclyn P.\n\n20 Stars\n\nHarbor Club was the first venue we saw once engaged and honestly how do you even compare? We were instantly sold on the experience and quality we would get, we knew the most important day in our lives was in good hands. Fast forward to wedding day and it was nothing short of amazing. Our family was treated with care as we took the most gorgeous pictures ever. Our family and friends had nothing but amazing reviews about cocktail hour, the views, the staff, and the amazing food. If you want a different venue, not cookie cutter, you want classy, elegant, and worth every penny\u2026 Harbor Club will deliver. I wish I could give 20 stars if I could!\n\nAmanda M.\n\nAbsolutely Spectacular\n\nMy daughter\u2019s wedding was recently held at Harbor Club at Prime and everything from beginning to end was absolutely spectacular. Guests enjoyed a lavish cocktail hour both inside and outside on the beautiful deck overlooking the water. Sushi bar, raw seafood bar, taco bar . . . and so much more. My guests are still talking about how delicious everything was.\n\nDebbie L.\n\nExtremely Courteous\n\nWe recently held our charitable foundation fundraiser at the Harbor Club at Prime and have only glowing praise for all aspects of the event. Everyone at the Harbor Club was a pleasure to deal with. More than adequately staffed, extremely courteous, professional and friendly \u2013 we have never had so many people complement the service at an event ever. Lastly, \u201ctone at the top\u201d is crucial, and the Bohlsens obviously do a fantastic job, as they run a first class organization!\n\nMarc M.\n\nDream Come True\n\nMy wedding was a dream come true. Keith was meticulous and helped me plan and organize our special day. If I could rate him and the venue as perfection I would. Every single thing went perfect at our wedding. All if our guests said the food was the best they ever had at any wedding. The attention to detail was amazing! I will remember this day forever and it was a fairy tale come true.\n\nErica G.\n\nBeyond Spectacular\n\nThe feeling we got when we stepped into the Harbor Club was instant and incredible! We knew from that moment on that we would be having our wedding there because of the views, cleanliness, and resources we would receive. In addition, they only host one wedding at a time which was a complete selling point for us since all the focus would be on providing excellent service to us and all our guests. We highly recommend having any kind of celebratory function with Harbor Club at Prime. If we could, we would do it all over again without any changes! Thank you so much to the Harbor Club at Prime and all of its wonderful staff for making our special day beyond spectacular.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Teddy A.\n\nThe Food is Unreal\n\nHarbor Club was absolutely phenomenal\u2026 from the entire planning process to the day of they constantly went above and beyond.

        "text":"What\u2019s in a Name? | Namey App Review\n\n\u201cWhats in a name?\u00a0That which\u00a0we call a rose. By any other\u00a0name\u00a0would smell as sweet. \u2013 William Shakespeare.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s funny how the above quote really doesn\u2019t apply to the name of your children isn\u2019t it? We know full well that names bear a big part of us, our personality and how we are presented. It\u2019s always blown my mind that we are given the responsibility to name small humans for the rest of their lives\u2026 I mean, I still have to Google how long to boil an egg sometimes.\n\nNaming babies is something I have found hard. There is a lot of pressure. A lot of opinions and also two people that have to agree. Surprisingly I found it harder second time around, Rory was named quite early on and I adored his name. With Baby Girls, you can be more adventurous\u00a0which adds pressure, Rich has been more opinionated and it has to \u2018go\u2019 with Rory\u2019s name too. It took us 7 months to choose a name for Baby Girl and the middle name is still undecided.\n\nAfter watching \u201cBaby Names I Love\u201d YouTube videos, creating Pinterest boards and scouring the end titles of all TV programmes (I can officially reel off the cast of Peppa Pig) I still didn\u2019t have one. Rich decided she didn\u2019t need a middle name, which she absolutely doesn\u2019t, but I wanted her to have one, and one with meaning. I then came across the app \u2018Namey\u2018 and struck baby names gold!\n\nThe app is super easy to use and has a lovely interface. It very quickly provides a list of names as well as their meaning and origin. What sets this app apart though are these key features:\n\nAffordable & Accessible\n\nThe premium version of the app is just 99p, which is so much more affordable than most baby name books. Baby name books are also a nice idea, but I have always found chances are you pick them up once and then they collect dust. Having baby names on an app on your phone means that you can tap into them whenever you have some downtime and is a great alternative to scrolling social media.\n\nGreat Social Features\n\nThis is by far my favourite thing about the app, two of my close friends are also pregnant, so we are always suggesting new baby names. If you\u2019re quite open about your baby name choices then the app features are amazing for getting friends and family involved. I LOVE that you can create polls for different names and everyone can vote on it. This has been so much fun to do with friends and it\u2019s interesting to see how popularity varies. It\u2019s also been great for us to get our families involved in a lighthearted way.\n\nSearch by Meaning\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and you like for baby names to resonate with you, this app is absolutely perfect. You can search for names by meaning and then filter by gender, origin and first letter if you wish too! I have loved this, especially for choosing the middle name as it allows us to add a little more thought and feeling to it.\n\nThey\u2019ve got Names!\n\nThere are over 25,000 names from 11 different origins, so there is a huge amount of choice! I really like this as it offers so many new names I had never heard of or thought about as they\u2019re not in general baby name books.\n\nIt\u2019s so user-friendly\n\nYou can filter your choices by gender, name origin, name characteristics, first name letter and name meaning. As well as this you can provide other family member names and Namey will make suggestions based on them using super-smart artificial intelligence and algorithms. This is also a great feature for finding the perfect middle name. I love that by simply scrolling through the list it quickly provides all of the info you need on each name, it has\u00a0become so addictive.\n\nNamey is available to download from the Apple App Store for iPhone and the Google Play Store for Android.\n\n\n*This is a collaborative post\n\n  \u2022 Kerryy\n\n    This sounds like a fab app will have to take a look!",

What wonderful products \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Andra\n\nHow truly inspired! I came across the sample packs at Michael\u2019s and thought it would spice up my traditional hand written notes. I hope the charity that benefits from the proceeds appreciates it as much as me. Jeanne\n\nMy wife and children love the cards. She found volumes 1-4 at Michael\u2019s in Melbourne, Florida. Apparently she puts them in the lunchboxes for the kids and their classmates gather round to see what they have each day. Your site and concept are great.

I have worked on 5 wishes and participated in several fund-raising events. I truly believe in the power of a wish and have personally witnessed the joy it can bring to a child who is enduring challenging times. I believe getting a child excited about a wish can distract from unpleasant treatments, bring a child and his or her family joy during a difficult time and even help a child to recover with new hope and inspiration for the future. The staff is very warm and helpful and I hope to continue volunteering for Make-A-Wish for years to come.\n\nWould you volunteer for this group again?\n\n\nFor the time you spent, how much of an impact did you feel your work or activity had?\n\n\nDid the organization use your time wisely?\n\nVery Well\n\nWould you recommend this group to a friend?\n\n\nWhen was your last experience with this nonprofit?\n\n\nRole:\u00a0 Volunteer",

        "text":"Review:\u201dWhere Narcissists find their home\u201d Review:\u201dWhere Narcissists find their home\u201d\n\nABOUT \u2013 is an entertaining and modern online dating site, in which they claim that they belong to the\u00a0top dating sites today. The site plea that they engage in \u201cThe Science and Art of Love\u201d upon searching for meaningful relationships. Based on their facial features, you can match the members using a \u201cSophisticated Facial recognition software\u201d and a proprietary algorithm to identify partners more likely to ignite real passion and compatibility\u201d since, apparently, according to them, \u201cScientists offer compelling data on romantic chemistry and findings prove that passion is subconsciously ignited when we spot someone whose facial features are similar to our own\u201d. This is the concept used by the site to identify your partner and to spot people whose facial features are identical and they believe this will make them a top dating site. However, the main concept seems a bit weird. This opens the site to ridicule since there are plenty of jokes to be made about the incest or the idea of literally wanting to have intercourse with yourself. There are a few indicators that the site is probably not at all cracked up to. Once you upgrade the compatibility matching system, you will be recognized as a featured member and will work harder to find out the perfect match.\u201d\n\nFind Your FaceMate Homepage 1\n\n\nI am not contented in terms of viewing our potential matches. They allowed the user to glimpse 25 searches per day, wow, what kind of site is this! Giving limits when what they should do is to give more features to the services for the customers and meet their expectations. Instead, they limit what the customers can do. They claimed that they are one of the top dating sites, in which I am not convinced at all with their website. The Search feature only has two search term fields, the Age Range, and Proximity. Still not enough. On the site, you will also see a \u201cBlog Page\u201d with lots of great entries with advices and insights in the world of online dating.\n\nIn terms of communicating our match, we can send emails to other members in order for us to communicate with our match on the site which is insane. Is not there any other feature more interactive than sending emails? There are of course. But the site that claims they are one of the\u00a0top dating sites seems to have overlooked this thing. How unfortunate! And one thing about this site is that, it takes the phenomenon to a whole new level by deliberately matching singles with people who look like each other, \u201cWhat are they, narcissist?\u201d If you look at most couples, you see that these facial features are not true. I really doubt that getting this theory out there will be of use to people. Not ever! FindYourfaceMate is absolutely not an engine to use in terms of dating online. It is not a site you can include in the list of top dating sites.\n\nFind Your FaceMate Homepage 2\n\nSome other features of the site include the following:\n\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 View their gallery of couples with similar facial features from site members to famous celebrity couples\n\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 Links to multiple news and magazine articles as well as mentions of the site on different television news shows\n\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 See your \u201cFacemate Compatibly\u201d with another member, although the only indicator I saw was \u201cFabulous\u201d\n\n\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 View your most recent \u201cFace Mate\u201d or check out your \u201cExpanded Matches\u201d if you want a few more options quite far from where you live\n\nDrawback and Caveats\n\nThe site may capitalize on the concept of using facial recognition technology in order for them to be the Top dating site. However, using this technology is also prone for dating the same \u2018type\u2019 (with the magic of Photoshop). I do not know if this is a trick of the site, in order for you to keep coming back to the site every day or it is just an experiment. The whole idea of the site seems a bit hollow to me since the only criteria they are using to find other matches is \u201dFace Compatibility\u201d which ultimately seems to ascribe that personality has nothing to do with compatibility. So they use a facial recognition software that uses 67 points on the face to recognize your similarities and matches you with other members based on your appearance.\n\nIt comes off gimmicky since there is no real entity on the site. User profiles are very basic and the site\u2019s features definitely leave a lot to be desired since emailing is the only real way to communicate with other members. As for me, I would choose a more interactive way of communicating like chatting or anything else and not just email. Email alone as the only means of communication is never enough. It will be very difficult to become one of the\u00a0top dating sites if this is the only way to communicate with people.\n\n\nThis website only focused or based their platform from people\u2019s faces, which is not supposed to be my standards in finding my match or my future partner. Personality is a very important criterion, but the website seems to care less about beauty that can only be seen beyond the naked eye or beyond the software the site has created. With the modernization of the world today, millions or even billions are using the internet for one thing or even for online dating, so why go on wasting my time on this website if I am not satisfied? The Features are few and the concept is less than what you will be expecting of a website that belongs to the top dating sites. It is better to find another website that is exactly one of the top dating sites. is totally no charge at all, but browsing this website is a waste of time as being mentioned above in this review. I would rather see my date head on but not on this crap!\n\n\u00a0Next Review: Review:\u201dWorry is interest paid on trouble before it comes due\u201d\n\nUser Submitted Comments",

Exploder that Blames Others\n  2. Exploder that Shames Herself\n  3. Stuffer that Build Barriers\n  4. Stuffer that Collects Retaliation Rocks\n\nLysa describes each of these types in detail, helping the reader to understand how each is defined. \u00a0She also admits that a person can be more than one of these, sharing that she happens to react all four ways depending on the situation!\n\nAs I read the book, I began to recognize in my life which way I tend to react. \u00a0I am mostly the \u201cStuffer that Builds Barriers\u201d however towards my husband I am often an \u201cExploder that Blames Others\u201d (him) and a \u201cStuffer that Collects Retaliation Rocks.\u201d\n\nAlso as I read the book, there were moments throughout the day that I became unglued, and when it happened, I immediately reflected back to Lysa\u2019s words. \u00a0I was now aware of my raw emotions and my reactions\u2026 more than ever before!\n\nFor example, my husband and I were in the far left lane of traffic when our car began to overheat. \u00a0I felt a rush of frustration and disdain towards our car as we merged over into the shoulder. \u00a0I knew in that moment I could have reacted out of my raw emotions, taking it out on my husband, but instead Lysa\u2019s words resounded in my head..\n\n\u201cIf this is the worst thing that happens today, it\u2019s still a pretty good day.\u201d\n\nThose words have already been memorized! \u00a0Written on my heart, waiting to encourage me for when those certain days try to steal the best of me.\n\nLysa has so many other great quotes of encouragement throughout Unglued, including:\n\n\u201cFeelings should be indicators, not dictators.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo not check in with the screaming demands of the world before you exchange whispers with God.\u201d\n\n\nThe great thing about this book is that it is an easy read. \u00a0It only took me a few days to finish!\u00a0I know that many women have a full schedule and cannot always commit to reading- however, this book is a fabulous resource and I truly believe it is a necessity.\n\nLysa not only addresses how we become unglued and how we respond, but she also gives guidance in how to have more control in those unglued moments of life.\n\nI highly recommend this book!\n\nUnveiled Wife\n\nPosts Website Twitter Facebook Google+\n\nMy name is Jennifer and I began this BLOG to share my journey as a wife, unveiled, uncovered and wide open, to purge my heart of the pain I have encountered AND to encourage other women in the world who are, have been, or will soon be wives...

So far this makes four families and eight children! We all enjoy comparing notes on the kids. Some of our children know about their conception; some are too young to understand. However, we all so far feel the desire to get to know each other, meet at some time, and continue to be involved in each other's lives somehow. Personally, I feel this is one way I can help my children know the man that helped in their conception, even if they never get the opportunity to actually meet him.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without Wendy and her family's work on creating this website! It is amazing the difference one person can make! Thank you so much Wendy and thank you, donor #272!",
