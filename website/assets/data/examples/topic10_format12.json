During an enology class visit to the Dry Creek Valley, Susan tasted an older bottle of Zinfandel made from the very vineyard in which she had just been sampling grapes. Susan quickly honed her expertise at some of Sonoma's top wineries, including Hacienda Winery, Kendall-Jackson, and Dry Creek Vineyard, before joining the SIMI Winery team in 2000.\n\nDecades after making dandelion wine on the family farm as a child, today she creates wines with harmony and a true sense of place. She still marvels at just how long quality wines can live beyond harvest, and takes any opportunity to taste old vintages of SIMI.\n\nLisa Evich | Winemaker\nWhen crafting exceptional wines, the key is to keep the big picture and the details in focus all at once.\n\nThe one word that Lisa Evich would use to describe SIMI wines is \"timeless.\" Through meticulous care and attention in both the vineyards and the winery, she works to maintain the timelessness of both SIMI and Sonoma County.\n\nHailing from Santa Rosa, Lisa fell in love with food and wine at an early age. While at Sonoma State University, her focus was on Environmental Studies and Planning. But there was something about the vineyards that called to her. It wasn't just the science of winemaking, but the art as well, the craft that could translate a place into a bottle.\n\nLisa began her career at SIMI, spending nine years with the winery before diversifying her experience with positions at Pine Ridge and Arrowood. SIMI welcomed her home as winemaker, where she collaborates with director of winemaking, Susan Lueker, creating world-class wines. And while Lisa would never require her friends and family to exclusively drink SIMI, there's no greater compliment than for someone to tell her that SIMI is their house wine.\n\n\nGreat wine begins in the vineyard, which is why SIMI made its home in the heart of the spectacular Sonoma County over 140 years ago. Our specialized and diverse Alexander Valley and Russian River Valley vineyards allow us to craft a remarkable range of wines, from powerful, nuanced Cabernet Sauvignons to cool, elegant Chardonnays.\n\nAlexander Valley\n\nJust north of Healdsburg lies one of Sonoma County\u2019s finest winegrowing regions: the Alexander Valley. Known for its diverse soils and complex geology, the warm Alexander Valley is well suited to red Bordeaux varieties, particularly Cabernet Sauvignon. The area\u2019s special pockets of gravelly soil bear remarkable similarity to those of Bordeaux, creating elegant wines with concentration and longevity.\n\nLandslide Vineyard:\n172 Acres\n\nLearn More\n\nRed Fan Vineyard:\n72 Acres\n\nLearn More\n\nLos Amigos Vineyard:\n96 Acres\n\nLearn More\n\nDel Rio Vineyard:\n44 Acres\n\nLearn More\n\nRussian River Valley\n\nMany natural forces occurred over hundreds of thousands of years to make the Russian River Valley the heralded wine region that it is today. Geologic plates have collided, rivers have shifted, and volcanoes have erupted, creating a unique and complex area that is one of the most complex in all of California. The Pacific Ocean\u2019s cooling fog drifts into the vineyards, preserving lifted acidity while fully developing ripe fruit flavors in renowned varieties like our prized Chardonnay.\n\nGoldfields Vineyard\n105 Acres\n\nLearn More\nGreat wine\nbegins in the vineyard.\nAlexander Valley\n\nLandslide Vineyard: 172 Acres\n\nOne of the most complex vineyards in Alexander Valley, Landslide is comprised of five distinct soil types that were created by a volcanic landslide from Mount St. Helena. The vineyard also has three different distinguishable sections and several microclimates. The highest part of the vineyard produces dense wines; the middle, powerful wines; and the lower, elegant wines. This leads to more complex blends. Fruit from this vineyard is used to make Landslide Cabernet Sauvignon and our Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, our Sonoma County Cabernet and our Sonoma County Merlot.\n\nRed Fan Vineyard: 72 Acres\n\nRed Fan Vineyard is named for the clay loam soils at the vineyard base that rapidly fan out to become shallow, red volcanic gravel on the upper bench. This grade of changing soils produces different flavor profiles within the vineyard and produces wine that express the best characteristics of Alexander Valley\u2019s eastern benchlands\u2014velvety texture and bright, luscious flavors. This vineyard contributes fruit to our Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nLos Amigos Vineyard: 96 Acres\n\nHome to Cabernet Sauvignon production for more than 30 years, Los Amigos vineyard produces wines that resonate with the classic characteristics of the Alexander Valley floor. The sandy loam soils are ideal for low-vigor vines. Our Cabernet vines share the vineyard with Merlot, another varietal ideal for the site.\n\nDel Rio Vineyard: 44 Acres\n\nSoils here are sandy loam, deep and fertile. Similar to Los Amigos, low vigor rootstocks and minimal irrigation keep yields low and concentrate flavors.\n\nRussian River Valley\n\nGoldfields Vineyard: 105 Acres\n\nThis meant-to-be Chardonnay vineyard makes up the heart of our Reserve Chardonnay and also contributes to our Sonoma County Chardonnay. We\u2019ve planted it to a variety of Chardonnay root stocks, field selections and clones taken from some of the best and oldest vineyards in California. The vineyard\u2019s Goldridge and Huichica series soils provide superb drainage. Goldfields\u2019 location in a warmer region of the Russian River Valley allows grapes to ripen fully each vintage.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiuseppe Simi leaves the Tuscan hills to find his fortune in the gold fields of California.\n\n\nGiuseppe and brother Pietro produce their first wines under the Simi name.\n\n\nThe first harvest in Simi's stone cellars at the present day winery on Healdsburg Avenue.\n\n\nSIMI's stone cellars are expanded. Tragically, later that year both Simi brothers die suddenly. Giuseppe's daughter Isabelle takes over management at the age of 18.\n\n\n\nProhibition begins. Isabelle sells all vineyard holdings to keep possession of cellared, anticipating a quick repeal of the Volstead Act.\n\n\nProhibition is repealed in December. SIMI is immediately prepared to sell 500,000 cases of perfectly cellared wines to the thirsty public.\n\n\nIsabelle establishes SIMI's first retail outlet, a tasting room fashioned from a 25,000 gallon cask installed in front of the winery's stone cellars.\n\n\nIsabelle Simi retires, selling the winery to Alexander Valley grape grower, Russell Green.\n\n\nSIMI uses the Alexander Valley appellation on its labels for the first time.\n\n\nZelma Long joins SIMI prepared to direct major renovation of the winery's fermentation and barrel rooms.\n\n\nSIMI acquires Landslide Vineyard in southern Alexander Valley to enhance and expand their Cabernet Sauvignon program.\n\n\nSIMI purchases 100 acres in the Russian River Valley and begins the development of Goldfields Vineyard, planting Chardonnay field selections and clones.\n\n\nSIMI celebrates 100 years of wine making in the stone cellars. A new hospitality center replaces Isabelle's cask tasting room.\n\n\nSIMI becomes green certified.\n\n\nSIMI builds an outdoor pizza oven for events and snacks for the tasting room.\n\n\nSIMI celebrates 140 years by bringing back Sparkling Wines to the tasting room.\n\nYou must be of legal drinking age in your country to enter this site.

        "text":"Organic Manufacturers since 1979\n\nA Bavarian girl and a young Englishman on a quest for happiness founded Barnhouse in 1979 during the natural foods movement. However, they were not able to put the idea of importing Crunchy (crunchy cereal) in addition to other organic foods from England into practice. The manufacturers over in England did not believe that they would be successful.\n\nKrunchy with a \"K\"\n\n\"All the more reason!\" Neil Reen said at the time and starting mixing his own crunchy cereal. Baking the product with organic ingredients was a completely new idea. At that time, Crunchy was only sold in England - and nowhere in the world was there a crunchy cereal made from organic ingredients. To differentiate their product, the pair named it Krunchy with a \"K\" and baked at home in a 30 year old oven for the first five organic shops in Munich.\n\n1998: A momentous Year\n\nBarnhouse grew slowly, almost organically. With a great deal of care, the two young entrepreneurs developed their business. A cellar bakery followed the apartment. They then produced their product on the first floor over a carpenter's shop. Not until 1998 did they make a huge step forward: they moved into their first own building, planned by themselves and fully meeting the requirements of the modern Krunchy baking company. These days, almost 20 varieties of crunchy cereals are baked in a three-shift operation in the idyllic town of M\u00fchldorf am Inn in Upper Bavaria.\n\nWhat's special at Barnhouse\n\n100 % \"organic\" All Krunchys & cereals are made from 100% organic ingredients\n\nNo artifical additives\n\nAll their products are produced without artifical flavours, fragrances or enhancers. Without exception everything you taste in Barnhouse products is unadulterated and genuine. Focus on Krunchy: everyday we work on refining and fine tuning our product - Europe's first organic Krunchy - and we have been doing so now for 35 years. Our almost 65 employees are committed to and trained specifically for this product.\n\nPedigree Organic Company\n\nBarnhouse develops and bakes Organic breakfast cereals, both for its own brand and private label brands. Throughout the entire Barnhouse business, only organic products are produced. In a place where there is nothing but organic to be found, then nothing can get mixed up either!\n\nBarnhouse in Figures:\u00a0\n\n\nSina Nagl and Neil Reen founded Barnhouse in their home kitchen. Krunchy Honey was the first organic granola ever baked! The output was about 4 kg per hour. Delivered by bike to the then 5 Munich Health Food Shops.\n\n1983 In order to operate on an exclusively organic basis, the team working around Sina Nagl and Neil Reen develops and produces a host of organic foods. Many of these products are pioneers in the organic market: Krunchy bars without sugar, \"babys\" - the first Demeter baby food manufactured in Germany, chocolate bars, Easter bunnies and Santa Clauses, yeast-free soups, burgers and convenience food mixes.\n1998 Focus on the original product, \"Krunchy\". With Barnhouse\u00b4s own plant in M\u00fchldorf am Inn (Bavaria), the world\u00b4s first \"organic Krunchy factory\" is born! The oven is now 20 m long. Eight employees.\n2003 Expansion and lengthening of the baking line. Capacity is doubled.\n2005 The new warehouse is commissioned. Now there are a total of 2,100 storage positions. Nagl and Reen invest a million Euros in the warehouse and various optimizations of the Krunchy baking factory.\n2006 The Barnhouse Krunchy bakers are baking round the clock, five days a week. For his crunchy cereal \"Krunchy Pure Oats\", Mr. Reen receives the industry award for \"Fast Seller of the Year\" at the BioFach trade exhibition. This makes Krunchy Pure Oats the most successful new product of 2006.\n2008 The New \"Krunchy World\" is christened.\u00a0Krunchy's neighbour, Byodo Naturkost, moves so Barnhouse can combine the building with the existing production facility and use it for packing and storage. The Krunchy area has therefore doubled once again and there is now more space for ingredients and finished products\n2011 Our business with organic Krunchy-Muesli is booming. More buildings and technology have been added. Over 20 sorts of organic crunchy muesli are baked on two 40 m long baking lines, around the clock, five days a week. The number of employees has grown to 50. But one thing never changed: Sina and Neil\u00b4s love for good, wholesome and natural products. Therefore Barnhouse is still only producing organic food.\u00a0100% organic!\n2012 Barnhouse presents the Krunchy Bar! There is now also \"Krunchy to go\". At it's launch there are two varieties: Chocolate, and Cranberry and Strawberry.\n2013 Barnhouse once again demonstrates innovation, launching the new series \"Amaranth Krunchy\" onto the organic market. Amaranth Krunchy is the first organic muesli, which is only sweetened with fruit and baked with sunflower oil. In this way Barnhouse is fulfilling the wishes of many customers who would like these alternative ingredients. For its launch this new series is available in two varieties.\nIn addition Barnhouse is expanding its selection of bars with three further varieties. There's never before been so many new products at once.\nThe number of employees has risen to 62.\n2014 Barnhouse is celebrating its 35 year anniversary - and is thanking its customers with a large Loyalty Campaign\u00a0, with great gifts such as the new Krunchy bowl. At the BioFach Fair Barnhouse will be presenting \"Krunchy 'n' Flakes\" a new range of products, which will be available in stores from March.",
