        "text":"Archive for August 11th, 2016\n\nby Tom Nelson\n\nEver since the introduction of the Mac in 1984, Apple has included built-in networking support. Nowadays, an\u00a0Ethernet port\u00a0or built-in\u00a0Wi-Fi\u00a0is not only expected, but quite mundane as well. But in 1984, having a computer with built-in networking was a bit revolutionary.\n\n\nApple originally made use of a networking system it called AppleTalk, which allowed those early Macs to not only communicate with each other, but more importantly, to share what was, back then, very expensive laser printer systems. These printers became part of the\u00a0desktop publishing revolution that the early Macs tapped into.\n\nTo understand the importance of AppleTalk, and later, EtherTalk, systems that Apple used, you have to go back and see what type of networks were available in 1984.\n\nRead more on About: Macs.\n\n\nRead Full Post \u00bb",

Attach the cartridge directly to your PCs USB port.\n\nIf you must use a USB hub please review the known problems and troubleshooting section of the documentation before proceeding.\n\nWithin a few seconds the 'CARTRIDGE DISCONNECTED' message seen in the status display should change to 'CARTRIDGE CONNECTED' and your cartridge serial number should be displayed in the Event Log window.\n\nIf this does not happen please see the Troubleshooting and\/or Driver Installation sections of the documentation.\n\nYour cartridge is now attached and recognized by the Multi-Cart Studio software.\n\nSynchronizing your Cartridge\n\nIf you have not already loaded or created a Workbook, please do so now as the state of this Workbook will be used to program your cartridge.\n\nTo begin Synchronization, press the 'Synchronize' button on the main Multi-Cart Studio application.\n\nSynchronization is normally a fully automatic process and should require no intervention on your part.\n\nPlease watch the messages in the Event Log window to see the progress and remaining time required to program your cartridge.\n\nIf any errors occur during synchronization they will be displayed in this window, please include these messages with your bug report.\n\nProgramming your blank cartridge from a completely full workbook (127 New ROM Images) will take the maximum amount of time, typically 3-4 minutes, depending on your particular PC.\n\nProgramming incremental changes such as changing the name of a menu entry or adding 1-2 ROM Images typically takes 4-8 seconds, again, depending on your particular PC.\n\nDuring Synchronization the 'Synchronize' button on the main application window will be disabled. Once this button is re-enabled and you see the 'programming complete' message in the Event Log window, it is safe to unplug your cartridge from the USB port and place it back in your ColecoVision for testing.\n\nThere is an 'Abort' button provided but you should never use this feature unless you plan on completely re-programming your cartridge. For example it may save you a lot of time by pressing 'Abort' if you were re-programming the entire cart, but realized you made a mistake just after programming started.\n\nInterrupting programming while in progress by pressing Abort or by 'surprise removal' of the cartridge from the USB bus may result in your cartridge being left in an intermediate state where some games may not work, may be the wrong games, or the on-screen menu may not appear.\n\nIf you do interrupt programming and your cartridge is left in a less than 100% stable state, please follow the instructions on erasing and reprogramming your cartridge in the Troubleshooting section of the documentation.\n\nEven though you may leave the cartridge in a half-programmed state, you cannot permanently damage the cartridge in any way.\n\nThese errors can always be corrected by erasing the cartridge completely and re-programming it from your current Workbook.\n\n\n<-- Chapter 3\nBack to Documentation Index\nChapter 5 -->",
