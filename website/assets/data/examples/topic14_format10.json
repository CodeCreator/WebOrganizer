        "text":"Indian Property Show at Dubai, inaugurated by Arbaaz Khan\n\nToday, on December 1st 2015, Indian Property Show, the popular exhibition of Indian properties, opened its doors to hundreds of buyers today. \u00a0Arbaaz Khan, the Bollywood actor and brand ambassador of the show inaugurated the event, in the presence of Indian developers and hundreds of visitors. The exhibition \u00a0is being held at Dubai World Trade Centre from December to 1st to 3rd between\u00a011am to 8pm. During the three days, the expo will be hosting over 170 developers \u2013 including the cream of the Indian real estate, construction companies and banks exhibiting over 600 projects. Entry is free with provision for free parking.\n\nThe event is an ideal opportunity for expat Indians in the UAE to explore a variety of property exhibits from India and have one-on-one contact with developers. Moreover, visitors can attend educative seminars, survey finance sources, and avail attractive promotions, pre-launch offers, exclusive deals and lucrative discounts. Children, too, will find representation at a special art contest where they can win gold bars worth AED 44,000.\n\nReal estate is the safest investment instrument.Currently, non-resident Indians (NRIs) are extremely active in investing into Indian real estate. In fact, NRIs are among the top five investor communities in the country\u2019s property sector. Apart from their natural affinity to India and the fact that NRIs see a higher intrinsic value on Indian real estate over property owned elsewhere, purchase decisions are also being spurred by the Indian rupee\u2019s ongoing weakness against the US dollar.\n\n\n\nOver 170 exhibitors, including developers, construction companies and banks; more than 600 projects on display.\n\n\u00b7 Fabulous bargains, deals, discounts and free air tickets for visitors; kids competition with winnings worth AED 44,000; Win An Apartment worth Rs 25 lacs.\n\n\n\n\nSunil Jaiswal, President of event organisers Sumansa Exhibitions said:\n\u201cWith rupee depreciation by 20 percent around US dollar \u2013 which translated into bigger remittance \u2013 this is a very good time specifically for NRIs to invest in Indian property. The other driving force is that real-estate is one of the fastest-growing sectors in India with positive prospects and with higher returns on property. Already, projects like 100 smart cities planned across India have captured NRIs\u2019 eye and with the government easing FDI flow in such projects, the investment is expected to boost further.\u201d\n\nIMG_8940\u201cMeasures such as easy payment plans offered by builders, more affordable, smaller units and more realty development in Tier II and III cities have been significant in improving the property market outlook. While the top tier cities continue to remain popular, NRIs are also showing increasing interest in cities like Pune, Chennai and Hyderabad, where they find higher chance of capital appreciation. Experts also predict that cities like Indore, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Kochi and Coimbatore will also be in focus next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are various forms of investment such as gold, fixed deposits, the equity market and bonds available, but real estate is the safest bet in the long run \u2013 and the most reliable investment instrument. Most of the properties built a few decades ago have easily yielded a return of 200-300%. No other investment tool can give comparable results\u201d, said Ashwinder Raj Singh, CEO \u2013 Residential Services, JLL India.\n\nA plethora of choice:\n\nIMG_8935With over 170 exhibitors and more than 600 projects, visitors will have an ample opportunity to browse through the exhibits and to find property to suit their budget and preference. The property show is playing host to the best of Indian developers including Indiabulls, Bhartiya City, Lodha Group, Kanakia, Kalpataru, L&T, Ozone Group, Mantri Developers, Sobha Developers, Rachana Lifestyle, Godrej, Unique Group, JP Infra, Sheth Creators, Akar Realty, Sunteck India, Suvilas, Rajesh LifeSpaces, Saarthi Group, Jaypee Greens, ATS, Satya, Unnati fortune, Supertech, Risara and Antriksh besides other key exhibitors. They will be coming from popular destinations such as Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Kolkata, Goa, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mangalore and Kochi among many others.\nIMG_8941Learn more from informative seminars and sessions: Visitors at the show will be able to attend free and interactive seminars on all three days. This year\u2019s highlight is the sessions on Property Taxation that will initiate attendees on the issues regarding property tax and the best ways to deal with them. Besides taxation, visitors can also attend sessions on topics such as Know Your City, NRI Guide to Property Investment in India, Vaastu, Taking Care of the Legal Angles and South India\u2019s Residential Real Estate Hot Spots, among others. Experts belonging to legal, realty and financial background will help investors take informed decisions on the various aspects of property purchase. To help NRIs sell their existing property in India, the show is bringing in property brokers from across India who can work on getting a good deal for the sellers.\nDrawing contest for children: For the first time, children have become an integral part of the property show with an exclusive drawing contest. Children aged between 5-8 years, and 9-12 years can now participate in \u201cDraw Your Dream Home\u201d competition on all three days of the show from 12 noon to 3pm and 4pm to 7pm. Winners in each group will be awarded 100gms, 50gms, 20gms gold bars for the winner and the two runners up respectively.\n\nPromotional offers, deals and discounts: From Property Dhamaka offers including unbelievably low-interest loans and fabulous discounts to return tickets to India by Jet Airways, visitors at the realty expo will be experiencing far more than just a shopping trip. The event also offers visitors a fantastic chance to Win An Apartment worth Rs 25 lacs.\n\nIndiabulls and Bhartiya City are the Platinum Sponsors of the property show, while Jet Airways serves as the Official Airline Partner. Sony, Times Now and AajTak are the Official Television Partners with 89.1 Radio 4 as the Official Radio Partner and Etisalat as the Official Telecom Partner.

        "text":"Runaway cats won't go far but may be hard to find\n\nRunaway cats won't go far but may be hard to find\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 If a scared dog bolts from home, it's likely to run as fast and far as it can. But if a house cat panics, it's more likely to slink away and stop at the first good hiding place it finds.\n\nBecause the getaway is so different, the search has to be, too, said Nancy Peterson, cat programs manager for the Humane Society of the United States and a registered veterinarian technician.\n\nDon't run to a shelter or post signs right away, she said. Immediately after you notice your pet is missing, search your yard, contact neighbors and show a photo to mail carriers, delivery drivers and paperboys.\n\n\"Most cats that escape or leave home won't go more than five houses away, so you should go to neighbor homes and ask if you can check their backyards,\" she said. \"If the cat does get further, it's because a dog or another cat chased it. Unfortunately, the farther away it gets, the harder it is for it to get home.\"\n\nThe search for your feline friend tends to be tougher going than if you had lost a dog, experts say. Good Samaritans often come to the rescue of dog owners, picking up pooches and making a call to the owner or taking them to a shelter. But there is no cavalry for cats, and domestic ones are not easily caught \u2014 you can't just open a car door and coax it to hop in. But you can protect against the loss of your cat by microchipping it and strapping on an ID collar.\n\nEven long-lost cats can be found, a joy that Mickey and June Wilson experienced. When an 8,700-acre wildfire came close to their Santa Barbara, Calif., home in May 2009, the couple grabbed their cat Morris and evacuated.\n\nFor one night, they stayed in a motel in Buellton, about 45 miles northwest of Santa Barbara.\n\nWhen Mickey Wilson went to get luggage from the car, Morris, rambling freely in the second-story room, escaped. Wilson searched everywhere, following several tips, but came up empty-handed.\n\nHeartbroken, Wilson and his wife returned home the next day without Morris. Relatives went up a few times after that to look but could not find the cat.\n\nFour months later, Wilson got a call from a woman who found Morris behind a restaurant at a feral cat feeding station. The station is run by Catalyst for Cats, Inc., a group of volunteers trying to control the feral cat population in Santa Barbara County by trapping, sterilizing and returning and then feeding wild cats in the area.\n\n\"Owned, lost cats show up at feeding stations more often than one would imagine,\" said Marci Kladnik, a Catalyst for Cats volunteer and columnist for the Cat Writers' Association.\n\nMorris was in good shape except for the tip of his tail, which was broken.\n\n\"If he hadn't had a name tag on his collar, we would never have seen him again,\" said Wilson, a retired aircraft engineer.\n\nWilson had to put Morris down about six months ago because of bladder problems. \"He was a special cat,\" Wilson said. \"And we enjoyed him up to the very end.\"\n\nMorris' discovery shows even a long search isn't hopeless.\n\n\"Don't give up! Cats can return home months after being lost,\" Orange County Animal Control spokesman Ryan Drabek said. But he says that most of the cats the facility takes in each year are feral. Only a third of them are domesticated, he said.\n\nBut there's always hope if a cat has ID, said Dr. Karen \"Doc\" Halligan, author and chief veterinary officer of the Lucy Pet Foundation.\n\n\"Both my cats have breakaway collars, tags and microchips. That is something all cat owners need to do for their cats,\" she said.\n\nIf a lost cat doesn't find its own way home the first night, broaden the search. Start checking shelters, post fliers and sign up on all the lost-pet apps available online.\n\n\"Don't wait too long,\" said Peterson of the Humane Society. \"Cats are creatures of habit. If they disappear one night and don't reappear by the next, something is probably wrong.\"\n\nIf you find your cat, it will probably be skittish.\n\n\"For a cat, danger comes from above so don't stand over a cat. ... Talk to it gently. Pet it, pet it, pet it, pet it,\" said Kladnik, the author.\n\nAt home, \"the cat will be glad to get there. It might be a little needy and will purr and purr. Go back to your normal routine. That's what the cat wants,\" she said.",

Credit: Douglas Elliman Real Estate\n\nAn 1860 house in Centerport said by its owner to have once been owned by a sea captain is on the market\u00a0for $899,000.\n\nThe original front of the house, which faces Centerport Harbor, became the back of the house when the road was moved to the opposite side of the home at the turn of the 20th century, says homeowner William Perks.\n\nThe Perks family, in addition to building an extension that added an attached garage and bedroom, enclosed the porch off what is now the rear of the home to create a 28-by-10.5-foot three-seasons room with water views. Below that is an open porch from which Perks says the family enjoys Fourth of July fireworks shows put on by the Crescent Beach Club in Bayville.\n\nThe two-bedroom, 2-1\/2-bathroom Colonial, represented by Tim Cavanagh of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, is on a .18-acre lot and includes 58 feet of waterfront.\u00a0Along the bulkhead is a rock wall that\u00a0Perks says his father, Oran, created from rocks he collected while traveling. \u00a0 \u00a0`\n\n\u201cHe took rocks from all over,\u201d Perks says\u00a0of his father, saying the roughly 25-foot-long wall includes finds from Arizona, Nova Scotia, his dad\u2019s hometown in\u00a0Illinois and many other locations.\n\nPerks\u2019 parents, who he says purchased the house in the 1940s, converted the home\u2019s original kitchen, now at the front of the house, into a parlor with a bow window.\u00a0A bedroom off the formal dining room became the current kitchen, which includes stainless steel appliances.\u00a0The main level also includes the living room, an office and a full bathroom.\n\nThe finished walkout basement, with exposed brick and wood, features a speakeasy-style bar, wood stove and full bathroom.\u00a0The room, Perks says, was his father\u2019s man cave.\n\nIn a story about the house in 1982, Newsday reported that Oran and Bernice \u2014 a descendant of the Townsend family, one of the founding families of Oyster Bay \u2014 paid $6,800 for the house and preserved the traditions of the Victorian home.\u00a0\u201cScores of visitors inspected the Perks home on a recent tour of notable, vintage houses conducted by the Greenlawn-Centerport Historical Society,\u201d the story said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe're revamping our Comments section.

        "text":"Not long after Sarah McNally opened McNally Jackson Books in the Nolita neighborhood of New York City in 2004, she began actively looking for a second location on the Upper West Side. But she soon became concerned that a second store across the city would take away too much time from her son, now age four, and her bookstore. Fast forward to 2012, and it was a vacant space around the corner from the bookstore found her. Now she is preparing to open McNally Jackson Store: Goods for the Study in mid-April on Mulberry Street just steps away from the bookstore entrance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be small. I thought I might do custom stationery,\u201d says McNally, adding \u201cwe don\u2019t do giftware. New Yorkers don\u2019t want giftware.\u201d Instead she is planning to expand on the mission of the bookstore \u201cto do things about the life of the mind\u201d by turning the 400 sq. ft. space into a place with beautiful vintage and new objects from around the world: desks, lamps, prints, and even rare books. Prices will range from $3 for a pencil to $3,000 for an imported desk.\n\n\u201cThere are so many beautiful things in the world,\u201d says Jackson, who is importing desks from Scandinavia and chairs from Austria. She shopped for the store in Paris as well as in Mexico, when she attended the Guadalajara International Book Fair last fall. She\u2019s also buying up prints, and doing it all in conjunction with the bookstore\u2019s art and design buyer Sandeep Bhuller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be beautiful,\u201d says Jackson, who describes it as \u201cromantic in the same way as the bookstore. The aim of the bookstore has always been to make reading more alluring.\u201d Unlike the bookstore, she sees Goods for the Study as having the potential for strong sales online. Goods for the Study will have its own Web site with a shopping cart, but McNally anticipates that its tumblr site will be ready sooner.\n\nIn order to make sure that everything in the new store is just right before it opens, Jackson has decided to forego a soft opening. She pushed the original opening date back two weeks from April 1 to give the Jielde lamps more time to arrive from France. As for the name, she credits her son with calling it the McNally Jackson Store.",

        "text":"Busting the myths about bushfire-safe homes\n\nBushfire safe homes do not have to be hugely expensive or resemble concrete bunkers to survive. Source: AAP\n\nBushfire safe housing isn't all about concrete bunker homes and huge bills. Integrating bushfire proof materials into the design of a home can save money and protect the building.\n\nLiving in Australia\u2019s beautiful, rugged bushland can be a doubled-edged sword.\n\nSo far this year more than 200 homes have been lost to bushfires, but there is a push towards making bushfire safe building practices more common, which could save homes in the future.\n\nArchitect and Queensland University of Technology consulting research architect Ian Weir told SBS there is a common misconception bushfire safe homes are very expensive to build.\n\nHe said many people also believe bushfire safe houses, which can be built to withstand six different bushfire attack levels, had to look like \u201cconcrete bunkers\u201d.\n\nDr Weir said the first five levels of potential bushfire attack saw homes threatened by \u201cprimarily ember attack and in the mid-range at [both] radiant heat and ember attack\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe sixth level has flame contact, ember attack and radiant heat, so you\u2019re dealing with all three,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the first five levels you\u2019re still looking at a relatively conventional house,\u201d Dr Weir said.\n\nOnly a house built to withstand the worst possible bushfire conditions might be comparable to a concrete bunker, Dr Weir said.\n\nThese six levels of potential bushfire threat to a home take into account the surrounding vegetation and landscape and how a fire may affect a property.\n\nThey are ranked on bushfire attack level (BAL) starting at level 1, low, and ranging through the next five levels of 12.5, 19, 29 and 40 to level six FZ (flame zone).\n\nDr Weir said ember attack was the main cause of home destruction during bushfires, with embers able to travel far ahead of the fire front.\n\n\u201cIn Yarloop most of the houses were lost through ember attacks and once one house caught fire the next caught fire and then you\u2019ve got a town site fire,\u201d he said.\n\nBushfires do not get hot enough to completely destroy a property, Dr Weir said, but structural fires do.\n\nEmbers work their way into cracks or gaps in a property or get under the eaves, starting a structural fire that can be very difficult to put out, he said.\n\nCSIRO bushfire urban design research leader Justin Leonard told SBS the best way to protect homes against embers was simple \u2013 use materials that don\u2019t burn.\n\nHe said using a steel frame for the house was a good place to start, along with building materials like brick or rammed earth.\n\nDr Weir said it was often complying with energy regulations that cost home owners a lot of money, and many of the measures taken to keep a house energy efficient, like using rammed earth, would also keep it safe in a bushfire.\n\nHe said bushfire-proofing elements such as toughened glass, window mesh and window shutters could also fulfill everyday roles such as fly screens or shades.\n\n\u201cBushfire prone areas are often really hot in summer but quite cold in winter\u2026and a lot of the things you need to make a house thermally comfortable are also bushfire proof,\u201d Dr Weir said.\n\nBoth Mr Leonard and Dr Weir agreed retrofitting a conventional home to survive a bushfire could become expensive, however integrating protections into a home design could be relatively cost-effective.\n\nDr Weir said bushfire safe materials and measures would often cost no more than about 5 percent of the value of a house.\n\nOne of Dr Weir\u2019s designs, known as the Kari Fire House, in Western Australia cost $500,000 to build and the fire safe measures, which included special glass, ember screens and a non-combustible verandah, cost just 2.6 per cent of the total cost, or about $13,000.\n\nBushfire Building Council of Australia chief executive Kate Cotter told SBS governments needed to be more proactive in encouraging and providing incentives for the construction of bushfire safe homes.\n\nShe said study needed to be done in places like Wye River in Victoria, where nearly 98 homes were lost last December, to see what conditions and construction allowed a house to survive a bushfire without the owner present.\n\n\u201cThere were new homes building to bushfire standards at Wye River that were destroyed,\u201d Ms Cotter said.\n\n\u201cWe want to see what works when there\u2019s no human interaction.\u201d\n\nShe said there were cases of older, weatherboard homes that had been able to survive bushfires after they had been retrofitted with bushfire measures like sprinkler systems, while new homes next door had burned to the ground.\n\n\u201cWe need a whole new way of thinking [in relation to bushfire-safe construction],\u201d Ms Cotter said.\n\nBut a big part of being bushfire ready came down to homeowners maintaining their homes and keeping them up to standard, Mr Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThe homeowner has to understand what a bushfire is and they have to understand how to maintain their house,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou need to close your windows [in a bushfire] and you should not park your caravan hard up against the side of your house.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to the responsibility of that owner.\n\n\u201cIf you do it in the right way it is relatively cheap to build something [bushfire safe].\u201d\n\nStay up to date with SBS NEWS\n\n  \u2022 App\n  \u2022

An adventurous dog wandered out onto the ice of a frozen pond and fell into the icy water, unable to get out.\n\nThere were some people on the shore who wisely chose not to attempt a rescue but called 911 for help. The emergency response came quickly from South Metro Fire Rescue. A firefighter, tethered safely to someone on shore, was able to maneuver across the ice and into the icy water\u00a0and then help the dog get back on to the ice and back to safety.\n\nThe rescued dog was cold and tired, but otherwise seemed fine thanks to the efforts of those on the shore who called for help, and for the efforts of firefighters responding to the call. We are so glad this story has a happy ending.\n\n\nColorado Dog Hikes His Second 14er + The Pictures Are Amazing",

It was\u00a0originally a pub called the Fox Inn, run by Punch Taverns.\n\nIt then became a number of different restaurants, all of which were unsuccessful. Before becoming the Nakhon Thai, it was known as the Palm Tree, which served Indian food.\n\nThe 0.46 hectare site had been offered for sale at \u00a3750,000.\n\nSimon Kitson, planning officer at South Oxfordshire District Council, said: \u201cDue to the scale of the site and the small size of Cane End, a successful business would arguably be heavily reliant on passing trade\/customers from outside the settlement and its intrinsic local value is questionable as there are no other mutually dependent businesses in the vicinity.\n\n\u201cGiven the generally broad support for redevelopment as expressed by the parish council and the local community, officers are satisfied that the existing business is unlikely to be fundamental to the quality and convenience of day-to-day life in the settlement.\u201d\n\nMore News:\n\nCouncil trio\n\nTHREE new people have been elected to Goring ...

Luke\u2019s vast experience in the antique business includes public television\u2019s \u201cAntiques Roadshow\u201d and serving as the director of the Collectibles Department for Christie\u2019s Auction House in New York City, N.Y.\nLuke writes for several publications and has also written and edited more than a few books. He has appeared on \u201cThe Today Show,\u201d \u201cThe View,\u201d \u201cOprah,\u201d \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d CNN, Lifetime Television, and the Discovery Channel. Luke resides in Florida, where he co-owns an auction and appraisal business, TreasureQuest Appraisal Group Inc.\n\nGerry Reilly, Tim Luke and Greg Strahm\n\nPhoto provided\n\nFrom left, Lanier Mansion curator\nGerry Reilly poses with Tim Luke\nand Greg Strahm, both of TreasureQuest Appraisal Group Inc. of Hobe Sound, Fla.,\npose at the 2007 Black and White Party.\n\nLuke will be at the wine-and-cheese reception in the Old Masonic Building on Friday, Sept. 5. The reception begins at 6:30 p.m. Following the wine-and-cheese event will be a presentation, \u201cTurning Trash into Cash.\u201d Luke will give advice on recognizing valuable items in our own attics, which is also great advice for garage sales and estate sales.\nAn example of the information given is advice on commemorative pieces. Luke advises to steer clear of most commemorative pieces.\n\u201cThey have no value because they can be reproduced and are not limited,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWhat makes pieces valuable are items such as a brick from the Berlin Wall because it is an original piece; it is real. All others are manufactured. Never collect for investment purchases.\u201d\nHe also said that included in the presentation will be what people go through behind the scenes of his television shows.\nIncluded in the Friday night activities is an auction, hosted by Luke, of donated items from area businesses. The highlight of the auction is the opportunity to bid on a private in-home appraisal with Luke following Sunday. Tickets are $10 for the presentation and are on sale at the Lanier-Madison Visitors Center Gift Shop or at the door.\nThe appraisal day lasts from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 6, at the Visitors Center, 601 W. First St. The appraisal fee is $10 per item or three items for $25 (excluding guns, knives, coins, stamps and fine jewelry), with a limit of four items per person. If the item is too large to haul in, a picture with the exact dimensions can be used. Waiting attendees will be able to watch videos of \u201cCash in the Attic.\u201d\nLuke narrated stories of unusual items that the owners did not think were worth much.\n\u201cWhat people think are not valuable are in fact valuable,\u201d Luke said.\nWhile working on an estate action, he found a painting that was not even on the inventory. The owner had the bought the painting when the artist was little known, and the owner did not think much about the painting. He was just storing it in an upstairs closet. When the artist died, the price of the painting went up to $100,000.\nA set of six hard plastic Madison dolls that a woman was given by her father fetched $75,000. These dolls were called mystery portrait dolls and were the only known set of all six in one collection.\nA group of pottery jugs that Luke said \u201clooked like a craft project gone wrong\u201d\nbrought more than $10,000. The only reason the owner thought it might be worth something was because it was signed \u201cTurner.\u201d\nA steiff German Teddy Bear, which had belonged to the person\u2019s mother, was in excellent condition from 1910-1915 and sold for $7,500.\nLast year in Madison after Luke had said that family Bibles are not worth much, a rare German church Bible was appraised at $7,000.\nNot only does Luke appraise the items, he also gives advice on where to sell them and offers places to get the best possible price. He can also put you in touch with a buyer.\nLuke warns that some treasure may have \u201cmuch sentimental value more than monetary value.\u201d However, if your item has value, Luke will disperse the \u201cinformation to take it from the attic to the bank.\u201d\nLater that Saturday, Luke will be a guest of the \u201cBlack and White Gala,\u201d a fundraiser that will be held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the north lawn of the Lanier Mansion grounds. Fun, formal or crazy dress is the proper attire for the gala.\n\u201cWe want people to have fun so they are encouraged to wear any combination of black and white clothing,\u201d said Gerry Reilly event organizer. \u201cSome people tell me they will wear tuxes; others say they will wear T-shirts and jeans; and still others say they will create their own imaginative outfit.\u201d\nA prize will be given for the most creative black and white outfit.\nThe admission of $30 per person includes substantial hors d\u2019oeuvres and two complimentary drink tickets. A cash bar for beer and wine will also be available.\nEntertainment will be provided by the Jamey Aebersold Jazz Quartet from New Albany, Ind. They will play popular jazz favorites from the 20th century. Aebersold is an internationally known saxophonist and authority on jazz education and improvisation. Aebersold also plays the piano, bass and banjo.\n\n\u2022 Proceeds from the event benefit the Lanier Mansion Foundation.

        "text":"Sale fails are up all over the country, San Francisco included\n\n  \u2022 82c14 g1 Sale fails are up all over the country, San Francisco included\n\n\n\nOn\u00a0Jan 11,\u00a0a new Trulia study examined the shadowy aspect of real estate sometimes called a \u201csale-fail,\u201d when for-sale homes that fail to sell initially are placed placed back on the market later. Trulia\u2019s main focus: those listings that return again to market\u00a0after being listed as \u201cpending\u201d or \u201cactive contingent.\u201d The study pulls national data from the 100 largest metro areas and shows this trend up everywhere, even right here at home.\n\nWhy sales fail\n\nGenerally, sales fail for these common reasons\n\n  \u2022 Buyer fails to obtain financing after entering contract\n  \u2022 Something comes up in the home inspection \u00a0that causes buyer or seller to balk over who will pay for\/how serious the a repair the issue in question (in SF, that could be foundation problems, roof leaks, termite infestations, or any number of issues)\n  \u2022 Sellers decides they can line up a better offer and tank the deal\n  \u2022 Bank appraisal comes in significantly below asking price; and either seller not willing to lower price or buyer not able to cover the gap out-of-pocket\n  \u2022 Seller simply decides not to sell, or buyer simply decides not to buy\n\nInteresting national results\n\nAccording to Trulia\u2019s study, data show that deals to sell homes in the US are falling through at a faster rate than they were a year ago. Most at risk of all: agreements for starter homes. \u201cThe \u2018sale fail\u2019 phenomenon applies most commonly to starter homebuyers nationally, at a rate of\u00a07.1percent\u00a0of all listings in Q4 2016, up from\u00a02.4 percent\u00a0in Q4 2014,\u201d says Trulia.\n\nWhen asked what might be causing this particular trend, Felipe Chac\u00f3n, Housing Data Analyst at Trulia, told On the Block that \u201cfail rates have been increasing nationally, as first time home buyers are increasingly getting back into the market and inventories continue to be squeezed.\u201d\n\nTight inventories create a more pressured buying atmosphere that can lead to missteps on either the seller or buyers\u2019 part during the process. Additionally, first time home buyers face an added level of lending scrutiny and come to the table with smaller down payments and less equity.\n\nInteresting local results\n\nSpecifically, in the\u00a0San Francisco metro\u00a0area, Trulia found that\n\n  \u2022 San Francisco\u00a0has experienced an unusually high jump in sale fails, jumping from\u00a03.8\u00a0percent\u00a0of all listings to 5.0 percent\u00a0within the past year.\n  \u2022 On a quarterly\u00a0basis, the San Francisco market\u00a0\u201ca failed sale\u201d rate in 5.3\u00a0percent\u00a0of all unique listings in the most recent quarter of 2016.\n\nThe gallery above shows three local homes as examples of initial sale fails that came back on market to finally sell or are still now active (one, in fact, failed to sell three separate times over the course of three months). \u00a0That such a phenomenon exists, and that it\u2019s actually increasing in frequency, might surprise some readers who know SF\u2019s real estate reputation.\n\nAnna\u00a0Marie Erwert writes from both the renter and new buyer perspective, having (finally) achieved both statuses. She focuses on national real estate trends, specializing in the\u00a0San Francisco Bay Area and\u00a0Pacific Northwest.\u00a0Follow\u00a0Anna\u00a0on\u00a0Twitter: @AnnaMarieErwert\n\n\nLet me know if this is so\n\nArticle source:\n\nThis entry was posted in SF Bay Area News and tagged .

        "text":"Nearly a year has passed since Tropical Storm Allison.\n\nSome residents have completely refurbished their flood-damaged 1950s ranch-style homes. Others have opted to tear down and rebuild grand custom homes with high elevations on their lots.\n\nStill others have moved out, unable or unwilling to take on debt to restore their homes. Particularly hard-hit were some of the older residents with paid-for homes that did not require flood insurance by a lender.\n\nAs Bill Blackwood puts it, the normal generational cycle of the neighborhood has been accelerated.\n\n\"What we would have seen over the next 10 years has been reduced to two,\" says Blackwood, president of the Braeswood Place Homeowners Association, of which Braes Oaks is a part. \"Sadly, we've seen people who were kind of the pillars of our community who have had to make the decision to leave for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nBraes Oaks is being revitalized as the trend to tear down and rebuild has been hastened by nature. With large lots and shady trees, minutes from the Texas Medical Center and Rice Village, the location is prime. Plans have been approved for over 20 new homes since the flood.\n\nNew houses are typically two-stories constructed with pier-and-beam foundations and containing 3,800 to 4,000 square feet, says Steve Anton of Hallmark Properties. They average around $630,000. Lot values, which dipped after the flood but are reviving, range from $195,00 to $215,000, Anton says.\n\nHome prices have been flat this spring, with the Sept. 11 attacks and downfall of Enron as contributing factors, Anton says. He expects a strong rebound in the next few years with all the improvements going on in the neighborhood.\n\nBraes Oaks, along with Braes Heights, Ayrshire and several other small subdivisions, make up Braeswood Place. More than 500 of the community's 2,200 homes took in water during Allison.\n\nSince the flood, the homeowners association has approved plans for 85 new homes and 14 additions. During the previous year, plans were approved for 39 new homes and 14 additions. The association reviews plans to make sure they comply with setback lines set forth in deed restrictions.\n\nSource: Crawford Realty Advisors prepared this analysis based on information compiled by the Houston Association of Realtors -",

        "text":"Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy have changed.\n\nBy continuing to use this site, you are agreeing to the new Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\nHome clearance sale coming from 'desperate' sellers\n\nJune 1, 2011: 8:31 AM ET\n\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Home prices are already a third off their highs, but this summer could bring the real discounts.\n\nBuyers are still cautious, and anxious sellers will have to price aggressively to get them off the fence.\n\nThat could result in a \"summer clearance sale,\" predicts Pete Flint, CEO of Trulia, the real estate web site.\n\n\"We don't imagine a stampede of buyers, like outside of Macy's on Black Friday,\" he said. \"We see this more akin to January sales where retailers are trying to get rid of stock before it gets stale.\"\n\nSeveral factors, he said, will lead to blow-out prices:\n\nAccelerating price drops: Home prices have already reached their lowest level since the housing bubble burst, and are now at 2002 levels. Sellers will feel the pressure to make deals before their homes lose even more value.\n\nBloated inventory:\nThere are boatloads of homes on the market, more than eight months worth at the current rate of sales. Many are distressed properties -- short sales and bank repossessions. Such homes are selling at discounts up to 50%.\n\nTight credit:\nSome homebuyers still can't obtain mortgages, limiting demand.\n\nWhile the job picture has brightened, unemployment is still around 9%. People without jobs don't buy homes, obviously, but high unemployment also rattles working people. Lacking the confidence that their jobs are secure, they may not look to buy.\n\nThese forces could all come to a head this summer, according to Flint, because of the cyclical nature of homebuying. Buying takes off in spring as many young families hope to make their moves before the new school year.\n\n\"By the end of the homebuying season, sellers will become increasingly desperate,\" said Flint.\n\n10 Cities where houses are already dirt cheap\n\nAdding to already swollen inventories will be a flood of new distressed properties poised to hit the market.\n\n\"By the summer, most of the 'robo-signing' delays will be over and more distressed properties will be on the market,\" said Celia Chen of Moody's analytics.\n\nMany banks had slowed foreclosure proceedings until they made sure that paperwork was in order. That put hundreds of thousands of homes into foreclosure limbo: Borrowers were no longer making payments in many cases, but were allowed to remain living in the homes.\n\nThere's little urgency for buyers to act in this stagnant market because no one expects prices to turnaround, according to Ken Johnson, a real estate professor at Florida International University and co-author of a new study on whether it's better to buy or rent.

        "text":"US housing recovery gains momentum in August\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A jump in sales of previously occupied homes and further gains in home construction suggest the U.S. housing recovery is gaining momentum.\n\nThe pair of reports Wednesday follows other signs of steady progress in the housing market after years of stagnation. New-home sales are up, builder confidence has reached its highest level in more than six years and increases in home prices appear to be sustainable.\n\nSales and construction rates are still below healthy levels, economists caution. But the improvement has been steady.\n\nAnd the broader economy is likely to benefit. When home prices rise, Americans typically feel wealthier and spend more -- a point Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made last week after the Fed unveiled a plan to lower mortgage rates. Consumer spending drives 70 percent of the economic growth.\n\n\"We have a real housing recovery taking root, and that has positive implications for the broader economy,\" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. \"If home prices continue to rise, so, too, will household wealth and consumer confidence.\"\n\nSales of previously occupied homes rose 7.8 percent in August from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. That's the highest level since May 2010, when sales were aided by a federal home-buying tax credit.\n\nU.S. builders broke ground on 2.3 percent more homes and apartments in August than July. The Commerce Department said the annual rate of construction rose to a seasonally adjusted 750,000. The increase was driven the best rate of single-family home construction since April 2010.\n\nEven with the gains, the market has a long way back to full health. Sales of previously occupied homes remain below the more than 5.5 million that's consistent with a thriving market. In better economies, homebuilders start twice as many homes.\n\nStrict credit standards and bigger down payment requirements have made it harder for many first-time buyers -- who are critical to a housing rebound -- to qualify for mortgages. The number of first-time homebuyers made up just 31 percent of the market in August. In healthier markets, the percentage is more than 40 percent.\n\nFor those who can qualify, the market is tempting. Mortgage rates are just above record lows. Prices, on average, are much lower than they were six years ago.\n\nThe Fed plans to spend $40 billion a month to buy mortgage bonds for as long as it thinks necessary to make home buying more affordable. Bernanke said the Fed will keep buying the bonds until the job market improves \"substantially.\"\n\nMany buyers today are investors who see a great opportunity in the improving sales trends and rising prices.\n\nCount Chad Shade as one of them.\n\nShade, 27, a homeowner in Brea, Calif., wants to buy a condo for around $150,000 that he can turn into a rental property. He's made offers on as many as six homes in the last three months. But he lost out every time to a rival paying cash.\n\n\"They seem to be selling like hotcakes,\" he said. \"I just don't see prices going much lower. It seems the housing market is starting to trend upward, and I don't want to miss that train.\"\n\nOne challenge for buyers now is the limited number of homes on the market. There were 2.47 million homes available for sale in August, or 18 percent fewer than the same month in 2011.\n\nHomes are selling more quickly than a year ago. The median amount of time that a home spent on the market was 70 days in August, the Realtors' group said. A year ago, the median timeframe was 92 days a year ago.\n\nAnd the limited supply has helped lift home prices. The median home price in August was $187,400, according to the Realtors' group said. That's slightly lower than July but 9.5 percent higher than August 2011 -- the largest year-over-year price increase since January 2006.\n\nOther surveys have also shown sustainable gains in prices, albeit much smaller. Core Logic, a private real estate data provider, said home prices rose 3.8 percent in the 12 months ending in July. The Standard & Poor's\/Case-Shiller index said last month that home prices rose in June on a year-over-year basis, the first time in nearly two years.\n\nOne reason prices are rising is there have been fewer foreclosures and short sales. A short sale is when the seller owes more on the mortgage than the home is worth. Distressed properties made up just 22 percent of sales in August, down from 31 percent a year ago. Those sales occur at steep discounts, which drag down overall home prices.\n\nChris Jones, an economist with TD Economics, said more foreclosures and short sales are likely. But rising prices should make homeowners with stable properties more willing to put their houses on the market. That will likely offset the drag on prices.\n\n\"The market is picking up. There are a lot of non-distressed homes that are coming on the market,\" Jones said.\n\nIn the meantime, the lower supply of homes has boosted demand for new homes. That has made builders more confident in future sales.\n\nApplications for building permits, a good sign of future construction, dipped in August to an annual rate of 803,000. Still, that's down only slight from July when permits reached a four-year high of 811,000.\n\n\"Since builders are not taking out permits because it is fun to visit their local government office and pay fees, we can conclude that there should be a solid rise in construction in the months to come,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist for Naroff Economics Advisors.\n\n\nAP Real Estate Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles to this report.\n\nWant to leave your comments?\n\nSign in or Register to comment.",

        "text":"Couple buy house but 'can't get out of car' on narrow driveway\n\nBy Andrew Turton | Great Barr | News | Published:\n\nPaul and Zena Jones only discovered the parking problem when they went to move in.\n\nUsually drivers are adept at maneuvering into spaces which can be a tight squeeze - but this is one even Lewis Hamilton might struggle with.\n\nCouple Paul and Zena Jones say they have been stuck trying to park in the driveway next to their new home in Great Barr since they moved in.\n\nThey branded the situation 'frustrating' after claiming their driveway only measures 89 inches - or 7ft 4ins - wide.\n\nThey struggle to open the doors of their Ford Fiesta and claim to be unable to get out of the car.\n\nPaul, aged 34, has since set up his own Twitter page \u2013 @DeerParkNoDrive \u2013 in a bid to highlight concerns.\n\nThey also tweeted out pictures showing their friend's car to illustrate the issue.\n\nHaving seen the designs, the couple bought the house from developer Taylor Wimpey before it was built, in a shared ownership agreement for \u00a390,000 with housing association Walsall Housing Group (whg).\n\n\nThey moved into their home, in Deer Park Drive, in February this year.\n\nBut when they first arrived on the day they received their keys they were stunned to find the narrow driveway.\n\n\"We pulled the car on and couldn't believe it. We couldn't get the door open,\" said Zena, aged 54.\n\nThe couple claim the width of the driveway is 89 inches, narrowing to 86 inches where an electric box is positioned on a outer wall.\n\n\nAfter reporting the issue to Taylor Wimpey they feel they have yet to hear a resolution to the issue.\n\n\"It is really frustrating. We have exhausted all ways of trying to get them to listen,\" said Mrs Jones.\n\nMrs Jones said: \"We've had people look at it three times yet we're getting nowhere.\n\n\"All we want is a bit of communication. We keep being passed from pillar to post.\"\n\nHer daughter Sam, 26, had also tried to pull her Fiat 500 car on the drive but claims not to be able to open the door to get out.\n\nA Taylor Wimpey spokesman said: \u201cWe are in regular contact with the customer and are working collaboratively to resolve any issues.\n\n\"We apologise for any inconvenience which may have been caused, and hope to come to a mutually-agreeable conclusion at the soonest possibility.\u201d\n\nMark Tranter, whg\u2019s Director of Development, said: \u201cWe have been liaising with both Taylor Wimpey and the customer to ensure this matter is resolved.\u201d\n\nAndrew Turton\n\nBy Andrew Turton\nDigital Journalist\n\nDigital journalist based at the Express & Star's head office in Wolverhampton.
