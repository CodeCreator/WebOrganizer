        "text":"My Paypal Already Received My First 25.39$ Earnings From\n\nHappy indeed that on March 8, 2013, I just completed my first 25$ earnings at after at least the fourteen days working with the site that started on February 23, 2013 to March 8, 2013. Bubblews e-check was already sent off to my PayPal account. For 14 days, I had published 68 posts on These 68 posts received a total of 208 likes. They garnered at least 2,129 views, 49 comments and the total earnings have reached so far to 25.39$. Because this is my first time to hit the threshold - immediately I decided to redeem them\n\nthrough my PayPal account.\n\nAfter the said transaction, I noticed that my bank records were all gone. All the recorded data were erased - what I saw were all zeros from posts, likes, views and the earnings accumulated during the period of 14 days. But they are still available on my Bubblews profile page except the amount I requested for payment. Now I understand that every time a user requests payment from Bubblews site - his bank records accumulated til the time he requested payment will be back to zero. And if he wanted it again to see earnings - he would have to work again by publishing new stuff and doing other activities available on the site - if he wanted to earn more.\n\nThe e-check payment dated March 9, 2013 from Bubblews is a living proof that Bubblews is really a legit site that pays its users and not a scam site according to some complains, other write-ups and feedback I read from the Internet regarding the site. On the e-check there was charges amounting to 1.29$ and the 24.10$ is the net amount deposited to my PayPal\n\n\nOn Bubblews - if the user is hard working, he could publish the maximum posts per day which are ten posts at 400 characters or more for each post. Every post a user posted could earn between 12$ and 15$ cents. So if he has posted 10 items for the day and multiplied them by 12$ or 15$ cents - he earns either 1.20$ or 1.50$. These amounts are earnings accumulated from posting ten items and there are additional earnings to be added if those items have already garnered views - plus additional earnings if those items have also received likes from other bubblews members and visitors.\n\nWhat if Bubblews has ignored my requested payment? What evidence I should use as proof that I requested the payment - as they were already erased from my Bubblews bank records? Of course, I should keep a proof - here I kept a copy of the recorded amount and other info found on my Bubblews bank record and other transaction at the time I made the request. I printed them using the print screen of my computer keyboard - and saved it as jpg (photos). I also wrote a short article regarding my request Just Sent Off My Request to Redeem My First Bubblews Earnings and published it on their site and on my blog site. They are all proof to use if Bubblews denied it.\n\nThe photos for this column are available at 25$ for 14 Days on Bubblews is a Success\n\nFor those who are not yet writing for Expertscolumn - you can use my referral link to join the site.\n\nArticle Written By pruelpo\n\nMy favorite Saying: \u201cDream Big and don\u2019t stop without giving it a chance to come true.\u201d I am a father of 3 for 27 years, OFW for 17 years , a Blogger, sometimes a Poet, Self-motivated and Professional by experience.

        "text":"Change Leaders Will be the GCs of the Future\n\nGilbert E. Forest\n\nGilbert E. Forest Egon Zehnder, Boston\n\nWhat distinguishes an excellent general counsel from a good or merely acceptable one?\n\nTo answer that question we recently mined information about more than 300 senior legal executives from among the thousands of management appraisals that we have conducted over the past several years. These evaluations are designed to help companies take stock of their available talent, improve development programs, conduct succession planning and understand their human capital following mergers or acquisitions.\n\nEvaluations are typically based on nine scaled leadership competencies: (1) Results Orientation, (2) Strategic Orientation, (3) Market Knowledge, (4) Collaboration and Influencing, (5) Developing Organizational Capability, (6) Team Leadership, (7) Change Leadership, (8) Customer Impact and (9) Functional Competency.\n\nLeadership Competencies Defined\n\n  \u2022 Results Orientation: Focusing on delivering and improving measurable business results. High performers improve the way things are done based on a thoughtful, calculated approach to risk.\n  \u2022 Strategic Orientation: Thinking long-term and outside one\u2019s own area. Requires business awareness, critical analysis and conceptualization of information in a way that defines the next steps. High performers challenge the current direction and propose new longterm direction.\n  \u2022 Market Knowledge: Understanding the market in which the business operates, including the competition, suppliers, customer base and regulatory environment. High performers segment the market and anticipate where it will go, based on understanding the drivers and the competition.\n  \u2022 Collaboration & Influencing: Working with and influencing those outside one\u2019s functional area to create a positive impact on business performance. High performers facilitate collaboration and partnerships.\n  \u2022 Developing Organizational Capability: Developing the long-term capabilities of others and the organization as a whole. High performers provide constructive behavioral feedback in a long-term career context.\n  \u2022 Team Leadership: Building effective teams in one\u2019s immediate organization. This applies to virtual or cross-functional teams, whether or not there is a formal leader. High performers build empowered teams that can develop and deliver on goals.\n  \u2022 Change Leadership: Transforming, aligning and energizing an organization. High performers create change leaders to propagate a new message.\n  \u2022 Customer Impact: Serving and building value-added relationships. High performers cultivate relationships and anticipate the customers\u2019 needs from their own perspective.\n  \u2022 Functional Competency: Mastering one\u2019s area of expertise, staying up to date, and sharing and disseminating that knowledge to drive business purposes. High performers act as business partners who can bring specialized expertise to the table when necessary.\n\nTogether, these competencies provide a predictive model of leadership for top executives of all kinds.\n\nThe results of our analysis carry interesting implications for boards and CEOs that are thinking about how best to develop top GC succession talent, and for individual legal executives who want to improve their performance. We compared the legal executives ranked as \u201coutstanding\u201d based on their competencies compared to those ranked \u201cgood,\u201d and \u201cacceptable.\u201d\n\nAmong the most striking findings was that, while functional competency (legal and regulatory knowledge in the company\u2019s areas of focus) was what distinguished the outstanding general counsel 15 years ago, today the bottom quartile in our sample have functional competency scores similar to outstanding GCs. Our data showed the functional competency level of all GCs to be generally high.\n\nAlthough CEOs have for some time been seeking more business-savvy GCs, the difference in market knowledge between outstanding and ordinary GCs is marginal. We would have expected outstanding GCs to be ahead of their peers in this competency.\n\nChange Leaders Will Be the GCs of the Future - Image\nFigure 1: Outstanding GCs and average CEOs\n\nWe found that outstanding GCs are significantly more skilled than their peers across the remaining leadership competencies. In addition, we found a meaningful negative correlation between time in one\u2019s role and competency level. Legal executives who rank highest have been in their current role for the shortest time. This suggests that many chief legal officers are simply not able to maintain as competitive a skill set over time.\n\nTheir replacements are being promoted with competency levels higher than those of their predecessors. This might suggest that once in the top roles, legal executives are not able to keep up with rapidly-changing demand for leadership competencies, so companies benefit from replacing them. It also suggests that legal executives need to find ways to benchmark and develop their skills to keep pace with the best in class. We advocate that legal executives understand and benchmark these competencies early in their careers.\n\nTrying to understand the gulf in skills between excellent GCs and their peers, we compared outstanding GCs to CEOs. The outstanding GCs have evolved leadership skills to the level of the average CEOs on almost every competency. They surpass the CEOs in collaboration.\n\nThe three gaps are in strategic orientation, change leadership and market knowledge. We believe outstanding GCs are outstanding because they emulate CEOs in order to be the business partners they seek.\n\nThese competencies are put into action in concrete ways by outstanding GCs. The GC of a $20B energy company has the lead attorneys sit down with their respective business executives annually and review the business plan, to determine where the legal department brings support and value. The lead attorney and the business leader agree on turnaround times, priorities and a cost\/benefit analysis of the services provided, and they agree in writing.\n\nTwo or more of these competencies often dovetail. For example, a GC in an innovation-driven Fortune 100 company asks his attorneys to spend two days per week working on-site in research and development to discuss innovation, and determine how to support it. The organization\u2019s team rating of the legal group and the legal team\u2019s satisfaction have never been higher\u2014 results that affirm the GC\u2019s skill at combining customer impact with team leadership.\n\nA comparison of outstanding GCs to outstanding CEOs provides a glimpse of the outstanding GCs of the future. Outstanding CEOs are seeking GCs whose competencies match theirs. Outstanding GCs already match top CEOs in collaborating and influencing, and are not far behind in developing organizational leadership.\n\nCompanies need to offer their legal executives development opportunities and establish development and leadership programs that will groom high potential internal legal talent for GC roles. Failing this, legal executives will continue to seek development opportunities by leaving their organizations.\n\nInvestment in top legal talent brings returns. Internal candidates with developed competencies clearly have the advantage in understanding the business. With an aging population and a complex legal and regulatory environment, companies not developing their internal legal talent will face an increasingly competitive environment for external recruits. Boards, CEOs and GCs must become aware of these competencies and establish plans that give their legal executives the opportunity to develop.\n\nAs the bar rises, today\u2019s outstanding GCs will likely strengthen their skills in the two areas where they lag outstanding CEOs: market knowledge, and change leadership. The outstanding GC of the future will be expected to perform on a par with outstanding CEOs in leadership competencies. As their work evolves, they are also likely to see new competencies emphasized.\n\nOver the next decade, the \u201csoft skills\u201d \u2013 those that address issues of people and the organization \u2013 will constitute a much higher percentage of the GC role than they have in the past. As companies become increasingly diverse, international, and collaborative, the emphasis on engaging thoughtfully with a wide variety of people, in contrast to using simple commandand- control levers, will grow. With demographic changes decreasing the pool of currently outstanding candidates, the emphasis on \u201cgrowing your own talent\u201d will also continue.\n\nWe also believe that as outstanding GCs continue to develop their skills, they not only will come to resemble outstanding CEOs in their level of competency, but will increasingly often become CEOs themselves.\n\nCo-authored by Stephen P.

        "text":"Greek contagion\n\nSince yesterday, news reports are full of comments like this:\nMany economists fear that if Greece exits the euro, it could lead to financial contagion, as investors and ordinary bank depositors in other eurozone countries may fear that their own government will follow suit.\n\nWhat does this mean? Are the Spanish looking to the Greeks as a model? That would be really weird.\u00a0Esos griegos ten\u00edan un gran \u00e9xito con su incumplimiento de las deudasHag\u00e1mos lo mismo.\u00a0Or is it a matter of queueing up? Greece has first dibs on default, and Spain just has to wait its turn. Or is this setting up a resonance in a\u00a0Sheldrakian\u00a0morphic field of default patterns? Perhaps we are witnessing the final consummation of the marriage of 21st century mathematics and 20th century pseudoscience that finance has been tending toward for the past three decades (at least).\n\nSurely the impact on investors will depend in part on the effects seen from a Greek euro withdrawal. At the very least If we think back to recent history, presumably any reasonable person would have thought, after the Lehman Brothers shit-storm, that the US financial authorities would be less likely to allow another similar bankruptcy to proceed. So, if Greece leaves the euro in a ball of flames, Spain will be unlikely to see it as a model. And if Greece\u2019s exit from the euro isn\u2019t so terrible then\u2026 maybe it\u2019s just not so terrible.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"IBM announced plans to launch its own crypto currency on the Stellar blockchain platform\n\n\nGlobal computing titan IBM has announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency on the Stellar blockchain, raising the stakes on high-tech adoption of virtual currency.\n\nCarbon Credit Cryptocurrency\n\nIBM has partnered with Veridium Labs, an environmental fin-tech startup, to develop a new cryptocurrency that will tokenize carbon credits. The credits will be used by businesses to offset environmental degradation caused by their operations.\n\nVeridium has been exploring new ways to implement carbon offset credits in an open market but has struggled to do so given the value constraints of the underlying credits. In other words, no generally agreed upon formula exists for determining individual value, which makes the buying and selling of credits difficult to implement.\n\nNow, Veridium believes it has found the solution through crypto tokens and the blockhain. The new token will be developed using Stellar\u2019s digital ledger. Veridium will be developing the value formula while IBM manages the technical specifications for buying, selling and managing the tokens.\n\nVeridium CEO Todd Lemons issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cFor years, we\u2019ve been trying to mitigate environmental impacts at every point in the value chain, however previous solutions still presented significant complexities and costs. Our digital environmental assets are designed to help companies and institutional investors purchase and use carbon credits to mitigate their environmental impacts today, and even hedge their potential carbon liabilities risks in the future.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the new project has already moved beyond the concept phase, which means the credits will be available across the Stellar network.\n\n\u201cBy using a public, permissioned blockchain network, we can help Veridium create a new sustainable marketplace that is good for business and good for the world,\u201d said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of IBM\u2019s industry platforms and blockchain division.\n\nStellar Network\n\nIBM and Stellar have been working together to develop a global payment network powered by blockchain technology. The technology giant announced last year it was using the Stellar blockchain to launch a network of 12 currency corridors that encompasses Australia, New Zealand smaller island nations in the South Pacific.\n\nThrough Stellar, IBM and a network of banks are using cryptocurrency the blockchain to move money across borders in near real-time. The service is available both to merchants and consumers that seek to accelerate the payment process.\n\nThe significance of the news, which IBM announced on Monday, is that merchants and consumers will be able to send money to another country in near real-time, accelerating a payments process that typically takes days. The network is said to process up to 60% of all cross-border payments in the South Pacific\u2019s retail foreign exchange corridors.\n\nStellar is the world\u2019s eighth largest cryptocurrency by market cap with a total value of roughly $6.7 billion. The protocol has generated significant attention due to its powerful team, growing business appeal and status as an emerging ICO platform.\n\n\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0435? \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u00a0Telegram \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044b!\n\nLeave a Reply",

To maximize potential profits, make sure that you have an interesting and unique product which will catch the attention of your target audience. It is also best to go for a product which is generally popular, or is promising enough to be popular to your target market.\n\nOnce you have decided on a certain product or products to sell, your next step is to create a site where you will sell your product on. Your site will be very important in your Internet home based business. It will be best if you can register a domain name that fits your product the most.

Your payment processor should be set in place. It might be best to go for payment channels such as PayPal as it is free and easy to set-up. In the same way, your Internet home based business site should also feature a product delivery that is automatic and instant. Not only will this be best for your customers, but this can also save you time as you will not need to email the product or send a download link after payment has been made.\n\nThe content of your site will have a big contribution to the success of your Internet home based business.
