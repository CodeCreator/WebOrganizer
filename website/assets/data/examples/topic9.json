        "text":"\nApple Whenever we're talking market share and Macs, it'll inevitably get late. There are different means of measuring market share, and different ways to interpret the resulting data, usually leading to heated debates about who is right and who isn't. Ars decided to take a look at the different methods of measurement and see what they mean.\nPermalink for comment 350567\nTo read all comments associated with this story, please click here.\nLies, damned lies, and statistics\nby elsewhere on Wed 25th Feb 2009 05:56 UTC\nMember since:\n\nBrowser statistics are interesting, but irrelevant, unless they're coming from a company like Google, which is one of the only web entities I would consider to be large enough in global userbase to overcome cultural, lingual, market and regional biases in terms of relevancy. Not perfect, but much better. But since Google et al. don't release browser stats, which is actually a shame, everything else represents a biased-sample.\n\nMarket share is an ambiguous concept. Most references to market share refer to % of dollars sold. 90% of the global organizations could be running Debian on all of their servers, but Microsoft would still dominate market share because that remaining 10% is paying for their Windows licenses.\n\nMore relevantly, Apple's average retail price is more than double their closest competitors, so Apple can sell half as many systems as anyone else, while still maintaining market share.\n\nUnit share is more interesting, because it covers the number of units that a manufacturer actually sold, rather than the cumulative value of the units they sold.\n\nThis is where the numbers game comes into play.\n\nIn Jan 08, Apple laptops represented 15% of all laptops sold in the US, but that dropped to slightly over 13% for Jan 09. Yet, Apple sold more laptops in Jan 09 than Jan 08. More interesting, their market share in terms of retail dollars spent is almost exactly flat between Jan 08 and Jan 09.\n\nWhich metric do you want to go by? You can argue Apple's unit share is dropping, you can argue that Apple is increasing their unit shipments, or you can argue that their market share is flat. This is the game that marketing people like to play.\n\nI'm not an Apple fanboi by any means, but I have to say, in business terms, Apple is doing phenomenally well in the retail space. They're effectively maintaining their market position despite being more expensive than the competition (when looking at the average price of the overall units sold).\n\nThere's a couple of interesting factors that will come into play. First of all, netbook sales are becoming fairly significant in terms of units shipped, although they're a relative drop in the bucket in terms of dollars spent. Netbooks weren't even on the map for most of 2008, but starting around September, they made a noticeable impact in unit sales.\n\nThe increase in netbook sales, considering Apple doesn't sell one, does somewhat dilute the stats for the other top tier companies and that will impact the average sell price those manufacturers are seeing for their products. Does this impact Apple? Not directly, but in a stressed economic time, it does raise the question of whether existing customers will be spending money to purchase new Apple systems versus the convenience of a much cheaper netbook for portability.\n\nThen there is the fanboi factor. One thing Apple has done a remarkable job of is building a fanatically loyal userbase. On this aspect I don't have hard numbers to go by, but I'd suspect that Apple probably tops the other manufactuers in terms of customer willingness to remain with the brand. The fanboi factor comes into play with that segment of customers that will never choose an alternative platform. But the fanbois only represent a segment of the existing market, the question is how large? There are a number of \"casual\" customers that chose Apple over the last couple of years, versus the long-term Apple users, but again, the question is, how many?\n\nApple, regardless of how people try to do the mathematics comparing their products against competitors, is a premium brand. It commands a premium price, and Apple earns a premium margin. Good for them, they've clearly been doing something right.\n\nStill, given the current economic condition, there's a very valid question of how long Apple will be able to maintain their market with that premium pricing. As I pointed out above, Apple's average sell retail price for each laptop is more than double that of their closest competitors. Apple may be dropping slightly in terms of unit share, but they are still second in terms of dollar share. Will Apple be able to rely on existing customers being able to upgrade to newer systems? Will Apple be able to rely on agnostic customers they may have gained over the last few years being willing to pay a premium to upgrade? Will Apple lose out in the consumer choice between a newer Apple or a much cheaper but practical netbook?\n\nI'm not bothering to look at desktop sales, because that's a whole separate set of numbers that I'm too lazy to analyze, since they're pretty much plummeting overall for every manufacturer, including Apple.\n\nApple has been doing something remarkably right with their product marketing, and it has been working for them. Though I don't use a Mac, and can't envision myself doing so any time in the near future, my hat is still off to them for that. I do think that the next year will be a remarkable test of how loyal a customer base they have, and their true ability to recruit new customers. That's where the numbers will become interesting, and the spinning of them, even more so. I'm not willing to place bets one way or the other, at this point.\n\nJust my rambling 2c...\n\nReply Score: 2",

        "text":"Kodak Partners With Blockchain Platform to Raise $50 Million in Token Offering\n\n\nKodak has partnered with a blockchain project seeking to raise $50 million in a combined public and private token offering.\u00a0The idea was put forth by\u00a0Wenn Digital, the developer of an image protection blockchain platform licensed by Eastman Kodak Co.\n\nKodak\u2019s Blockchain Platform to Raise Up to $50 Million in Token Offering\n\nKODAKOne is a blockchain-based system created by Wenn Digital, designed to protect the copyright of images or photographs registered on the platform. Kodak holds\u00a0a minority stake in Wenn Digital and has benefited from that position, reports Reuters. The performance of its stock has improved significantly as investors predict the development of the blockchain platform will turn into a lucrative venture once it is set and running.\n\nShares of the company have jumped from its early 2018 lows around $3 to as high as $11.55 when Kodak announced the deal with Wenn Digital. It quickly lost two-thirds of its market value on news that the token offering, which was scheduled for January, would be delayed. Finally, the initial coin offering (ICO) of KODAKCoin is due to take place on May 21.\u00a0The January misstep was caused by regulatory issues that have since been taken care of.\n\nCam Chell, co-founder and chair of KODAKOne told Reuters in an interview that the token offering will comply with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). KODAKOne will use Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT),\u00a0an investment contract offered by cryptocurrency developers to accredited investors. Being a security, SAFT must comply with securities regulations, which requires the token to be issued when the blockchain platform is launched.\n\nThe SEC supports the practice because it sees these SAFTs as being traded like securities without conforming to any of the strict rules that already exist for that market. Token sales become viable under the SEC regulation with the SAFT structure because participation is limited to accredited investors.\n\n\u201cWe really took a step back and decided that we would ensure that all Ts were crossed and Is dotted before we embark on a public sale. We wanted to make sure that we got it right\u201d.\n\nKODAKOne is expected to be launched later this year, according to Cam Chell. A pre-sale of its SAFT to accredited investors conducted by Wenn Digital raised approximately $10 million. The company needs $20 million to be able to successfully develop and launch the blockchain platform, but Chell says \u2018$50 million is our sweet spot\u2019 as the company aims higher.",

Survival measure, which was first introduced by Schonbucher [12] in the framework of defaultable LMM, has the advantage of eliminating default indicator variable directly from the expectation by absorbing it into Randon-Nikodym density process. Survival measure approach was further extended by Collin-Duresne[4] to avoid calculating a troublesome jump in IBPR reduced-form model. This paper considers survival measure in \"HBPR\" model, i.e. default time is characterized by Cox construction, and studies the relevant drift changes and martingale representations. This paper also takes advantage of survival measure to solve the looping default problem in interacting intensity model with stochastic intensities. Guaranteed debt is priced under this model, as an application of survival measure and interacting intensity model. Detailed numerical analysis is performed in this paper to study influence of stochastic pre-default intensities and contagion on value of a two firms' bilateral guaranteed debt portfolio.\n\n    Download Info\n\n    If you experience problems downloading a file, check if you have the proper application to view it first.

You may be wearing a number of different hats, playing the role of marketing strategist, website development lead, campaign manager, content writer, social media guru, and brand police, just to name a few. How do you get it all done? It may sometimes feel impossible, especially if you have hundreds of franchise locations to oversee.\n\nEver wish you could just clone yourself?\n\nFortunately, there are ways to streamline your digital franchise marketing efforts so you don\u2019t have to feel like you\u2019re constantly being pulled in a million different directions. With the right strategies, tools, and support, you can turn chaos into a well-oiled machine that allows you achieve your marketing goals on time and within budget. What better way to show your bosses that you\u2019re truly an expert at your job?\n\nBelow are a few tips for mastering franchise marketing without having to clone yourself:\n\nHire a Marketing Team & Delegate: As the marketing mastermind at your franchise, your skills are best used guiding your franchise network\u2019s overall marketing strategy, monitoring its overall success, and maintaining strong communication with your franchisees\u2014rather than handling all the miniscule details of coding a website or managing numerous pay-per-click advertising campaigns.\n\nThis is where it\u2019s helpful to hire an Internet marketing partner that can handle all of the day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on the big picture (and get everything done). It helps to work with a single, full-service digital marketing company rather than several vendors for each different area of your marketing. Why deal with the struggle of getting all your different vendors on the same page and working together when you could have one partner that seamlessly integrates your website design, search engine optimization (SEO), online advertising, social media, and more?\n\nSimplify the Process of Tracking Your Data: Why dig for data (which can take up hours of your time) when you could have it automatically generated and clearly laid out for you? Here at Scorpion, we offer our franchise clients an online marketing platform that makes it easy for them to track website traffic, organic rankings, PPC campaign performance, leads, and more. All you have to do is login and you have a wealth of data that shows you exactly how your various digital marketing efforts are performing, which is great for tracking your return on investment (ROI).\n\nAccording to HubSpot\u2019s 2015 State of Inbound report, proving return on investment (ROI) of marketing activities was the number one challenge of both B2B and B2C marketers. And 32% of digital marketers and enterprise companies said making analytics actionable was one of their top three challenges, according to a 2016 study by Experian.\n\nTo take you analytics a step further, we make it possible for you to integrate our platform with your customer relationship management (CRM) system so you have a more complete picture of how your marketing campaign and leads are tied to your customer acquisition and revenue. Read more about our award-winning marketing platform.\n\nPre-Schedule Your Content: Consistency is key when blogging and engaging followers on social media. If you are only posting your content sporadically when you have pockets of time, you risk slipping out of the spotlight and losing the interest of your followers. With a good content management system (CMS) and social media management platform, you can pre-schedule your posts so they\u2019re ready to go at the right time.
