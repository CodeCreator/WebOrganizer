SBA acted under its own authority, as provided by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act that was recently signed by the President, to declare a disaster following a request received from Gov.\u00a0JB Pritzker on March 17, 2020.\nThe disaster declaration makes SBA assistance available in the entire state of Illinois; and the contiguous counties of Clinton, Des Moines, Dubuque, Jackson, Lee, Louisa, Muscatine and Scott in Iowa; Benton, Gibson, Knox, Lake, Newton, Posey, Sullivan, Vermillion, Vigo and Warren in Indiana; Ballard, Crittenden, Livingston, McCracken and Union in Kentucky; Cape Girardeau, Clark, Jefferson, Lewis, Lincoln, Marion, Mississippi, Perry, Pike, Ralls, Saint Charles, Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Sainte Genevieve and Scott in Missouri; and Grant, Green, Kenosha, Lafayette, Rock and Walworth in Wisconsin.\n\u201cSBA is strongly committed to providing the most effective and customer-focused response possible to assist Illinois small businesses with federal disaster loans. We will be swift in our efforts to help these small businesses recover from the financial impacts of the Coronavirus (COVID-19),\u201d said Administrator Carranza.\nSBA Customer Service Representatives will be available to answer questions about SBA\u2019s Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and explain the application process.\n\u201cSmall businesses, private non-profit organizations of any size, small agricultural cooperatives and small aquaculture enterprises that have been financially impacted as a direct result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) since Jan. 31, 2020, may qualify for Economic Injury Disaster Loans of up to $2\u00a0million to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses which could have been met had the disaster not occurred,\u201d said Carranza.\n\u201cThese loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that can\u2019t be paid because of the disaster\u2019s impact. Disaster loans can provide vital economic assistance to small businesses to help overcome the temporary loss of revenue they are experiencing,\u201d Carranza added.\nEligibility for Economic Injury Disaster Loans is based on the financial impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The interest rate is 3.75 percent for small businesses. The interest rate for private non-profit organizations is 2.75 percent.

        "text":"Take Your Mixes To The Next Level\n\nWednesday, March 4, 2015\n\nThe 5 Ways To Charge For Your Musical Services\n\nCharging For Services image\nIt's always tough to figure out how much to charge an artist or band that's not on a label for your services. Here's an excerpt from my Music Producer's Handbook that looks at the 5 different ways to charge a client for your production, engineering or musical services, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\n\"What if a local band asks you to produce or record them? What do you charge if they\u2019re not attached to a label? There are a number of approaches that you can take, although none will have you retiring to the Bahamas anytime soon. You can:\n  \u2022 Charge a flat project fee. How much should that be? So much depends upon the type of project, how many overdubs you\u2019ll need, the artist\u2019s or band\u2019s competency, the artist\u2019s or band\u2019s income level, and the number of songs. A jazz or blues band with 20 songs will usually take a lot less time than a pop band with 8 because of the type of music and the layering normally required with pop music. And if the band has a marginal player or two, that can almost double the time spent just trying to get the parts to match the other players in skill level (unless you can persuade them to use a session player.)\nUsually, a flat fee is the least desirable way to get paid since projects have a tendency to go a lot longer than anticipated and will tend to drag on and on when the artist realizes that you get paid the same regardless of the time spent. If the flat fee is the easiest way or only way to get the gig, then that\u2019s what you have to do, but otherwise, avoid it if you can unless you\u2019ll very well compensated.\n  \u2022 Charge a per-song fee. This is better than the flat project fee but not by much. All the same problem areas are still there with the exception that it can sometimes cause the artist to scale back from recording 15 songs to 10 (even though it\u2019s a hit in your pocketbook). You won\u2019t have to worry about the artist wanting to record an extra song at the last minute or suddenly wanting to complete a track originally deemed too weak after basic tracking. With a per-song rate, any additional songs and you have to get paid.\n  \u2022 Get paid on spec. This is the way that most fledgling producers start their careers. The deal would be that if the artist or band \u201cmakes it\u201d (meaning they get signed by a major label and get an advance), then you\u2019ll get paid either your project fee, points, or both. The chances of that happening are always long no matter how much you believe in the act, so be prepared to spend your time working for free. The one good thing here is that you\u2019ll be gaining experience.\nIf you\u2019re going to work on contingency, you\u2019ll need to get two things from the artist or band. The first thing is a larger deal than your normal rate to make it worth your while, since you\u2019re specing your time. That could be anywhere from 20 to 50, even 100% more - whatever you can negotiate. You can justify it by saying, \u201cI\u2019m providing a lot of valuable time and expertise that you\u2019re not paying me for right now. Maybe it\u2019ll take a long time to see this money or maybe I\u2019ll never see it. That\u2019s worth an extra premium.\u201d\n\nThe second thing is an agreement stating the terms of how much and under what circumstances you\u2019ll get paid. While you should go to an attorney to get this drawn up, this can cost you money that you don\u2019t have or don\u2019t want to spend on a project that may never pay off. Even if it\u2019s only a single page long, just be sure to get it in writing because people have a tendency to forget or remember differently over time and it pays to have something on paper. At the very least, put down what songs you\u2019ve worked on (or going to work on), the amounts agreed upon, and a time frame that you\u2019ll get paid (example - 30 days after signing a major or indie label agreement), and how you\u2019ll get paid (\u201cin full by cashiers check\u201d) just so no one forgets. This may not be legally binding or may have plenty of holes that a high-priced lawyer can drive a truck through, but if the people you\u2019re dealing are on the up and up, you\u2019ll at least have a piece of paper to remind everyone of your contribution to their success and how you all agreed you\u2019d be compensated.\n  \u2022 Charge an hourly rate. The safest way to go as long as you can get paid, an hourly rate means that when you inevitably spend that extra week on overdubs or mixing, you\u2019ll get paid for the time you\u2019re putting in. The hourly rate keeps people focused and stops them from adding those extra 5 overdubs \u201cjust to see what they sound like,\u201d or from trying 10 more takes when you all agreed that number 3 was great.\n  \u2022 A combination of the above. Many times payment consists of a little bit of money or a little bit of spec, some items at a flat rate and some at hourly, or some combination. Try not to get too complicated. A simple deal works best for everyone, especially when it comes to getting paid. Just realize that there are a lot of options available.\nThere are a lot of good books on the subject of how to structure a deal for yourself that are much more comprehensive then what was just laid out above. Even if you decide not to read them, get an attorney if it means any money more than what the attorney will cost. At the very least, always get it in writing.\"\n\nDon't forget to check out my Music 3.0 blog\u00a0for tips and tricks on navigating social media and the new music business.\n\nNo comments:\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"How to Buy U.S. Stock Shares\n\nAfter the miserable years the U.S. stock market had between 2000 and 2010, many investors think it might be time for a turnaround. Although experts contend that you never know the perfect time to buy, purchasing shares of U.S. stocks isn\u2019t as easy as it may seem. There is much to learn, as you'll have to decide which brokerage account to open, which stocks to buy and then complete the trade to purchase your shares. Luckily, all these tasks fall into a few basic areas you\u2019ll need to study before pressing the \u201cbuy\u201d button or calling your broker to purchase U.S. company shares.\n\nWrite your goals in actionable, concrete terms. The National Endowment for Financial Education recommends that you start any investment plan by making a list of goals that have a set time table to reach and are reasonable to obtain. By completing this exercise, you\u2019ll narrow the list of thousands of U.S. companies in which you can invest down to a more manageable number that may suit your financial goals.\n\nPlace enough money in a brokerage account to purchase U.S. stocks and cover your trading costs. People who don\u2019t want to trade alone or are uncomfortable making stock-picking decisions without professional help may be well served using a full-service brokerage company. You\u2019ll have access to investment professionals who are licensed to help you buy suitable U.S. stocks for your goals. Ask your friends for recommendations of good brokers they may know. Check the track record and background of any prospective financial advisor by using the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) BrokerCheck website (see Resources).\n\nPlace money instead in an online or discount brokerage account if you\u2019re comfortable completing research, making trades and tracking your U.S. stock portfolio alone. By choosing a discount broker, you won\u2019t receive the help of a professional, but you\u2019ll save some money on trading costs. Find and compare a few different online or discount broker fees, trading tools, and services before deciding to open an account.\n\nList U.S. companies you enjoy or admire, or whose products you use, to begin your research tasks. Long-time investment pro Peter Lynch recommends buying shares in companies you know because you\u2019re more likely to understand why they\u2019re profitable and the possible stumbling blocks that may stand in their way in the future. Use research tools online through websites such as Etrade Clearstation, Yahoo! Finance and MarketWatch Bigcharts to scan company revenue and profits, find news about management changes and product offerings, and track charts displaying historical share price trends.\n\nPurchase U.S. companies by executing buy trade orders. You\u2019ll want to decide between market and limit orders to buy your shares. Market orders trade immediately at the best available price. You\u2019ll want a limit order when you\u2019re worried you may overpay for a stock. Limit orders are placed at a price below the market, in the hopes that the price will descend, triggering your trade.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAs a former financial advisor to companies and individuals for 16 years, Joe Andrews knows financial planning and marketing from start-ups to personal budgets.

        "text":"Rapyd raises $300M on a $2.5B valuation to boost its fintech-as-a-service API\n\nIngrid Lunden\n\u00b76 min read\nMulti Colored Bling Bling Dollar Sign Shape Bokeh Backdrop on Dark Background, Finance Concept.\n\nA wave of organizations -- propelled by global COVID-19 pandemic circumstances -- are moving their commercial and financial interactions online, and today one of the big players helping to enable that shift is announcing a significant round of growth funding to expand the tools and services that it provides to them.\n\nRapyd, which provides an API-based \"fintech-as-a-service\" platform covering payments, banking services, fraud protection and more, has raised $300 million, funding that CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman said in an interview will be used to expand its team, build out more technology (next up: expanded fraud ID services and a wider marketplace) and make selected acquisitions.\n\nRapyd's customer base now numbers about 5,000 businesses, which includes marketplaces (labor marketplaces and marketplaces for goods), e-commerce businesses, other kinds of lenders and any business that might want to incorporate transactions or new financial services into their wider offerings. Shtilman said that at the moment, Rapyd is seeing its strongest growth yet, onboarding about 500 new customers each week.\n\nThe funding is coming at a $2.5 billion post-money valuation, Shtilman confirmed. (For some context on that, Rapyd was last valued at $1.2 billion in December 2019.)\n\nThe round is a Series D and is being led by prolific growth-round VC Coatue, with Spark Capital, Avid Ventures, FJ Labs and Latitude (all new backers), as well as General Catalyst, Oak HC\/FT, Tiger Global, Target Global, Durable Capital, Tal Capital and Entr\u00e9e Capital (all previous backers) also participating. Other past investors, notably, include another major player in the world of API-based financial services, Stripe.\n\nAs with other companies in categories that have seen a huge surge of demand in the last year, financial services -- and in particular those providing services to be able to carry out transactions online via the internet or phone -- have proven to be some of the most mandatory and most used. (And no wonder, since bills still need paying, food and other items still need to be purchased, loans very much still need to be made and so on.)\n\nThis was what many would call an \"opportunistic\" raise, made not to keep the lights on or to extend runway, but because the money was being offered to Rapyd at good terms, and there were smart places where it could be put to use to grow the business.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t plan to raise money when we raised this round, but when the pandemic came in our business started to boom,\" Shtilman said. \"We were approached by existing investors to scale beyond our original business plans after we completed our 2021 growth plans in three months in 2020. So we thought the timing was probably right for world domination.\"\n\nShtilman was partly (only partly) joking -- he has a sort of deadpan delivery that I can't quite capture here -- but it's a far cry from the startup's early days, when \"no one wanted to invest because everyone thought it would be too hard to execute. Even our early investors advised us to focus on a smaller concept. But we thought building globally doesn\u2019t work. To start small is against the idea. Over the last several years, the need to explain what we do [has] almost vanished.\"\n\nThe challenge (and opportunity) that Rapyd identified back in 2017 when it first opened for business (having been hatched in Israel originally) is that the global commerce and financial markets are very highly fragmented. Consumers and businesses in individual markets have their own preferred payment methods and demands, regulations differ and the key companies involved vary from country to country.\n\nMeanwhile, APIs have long been a great instrument for integration and connection: Using a few lines of code -- and presuming your own services are built on code too -- you can knit together services, and bring in commoditized functionality that would take ages to build from the ground up, cutting down the effort and work needed, to focus on making your core business more unique.\n\nWhile companies like Stripe, Twilio and many others had identified the opportunity of leveraging APIs to scale out a world of functionality to a wider set of would-be customers, what Rapyd really identified and built out was the idea of loading not just one, two or three services, but hundreds (even thousands) of features into that proposition. In fintech, where those services are complex, there is a big array of them from which to choose what to build, and also a big pool of would-be customers to use them, if you are aiming wide.\n\nThe idea is smart and, as Shtilman noted, very much in keeping with the economies of scale that exist in e-commerce and fintech: Individual transactions are at the end of the day very incremental, so services that bring many together can finally start to conceive of interesting returns.\n\nThat, of course, is not just something Rapyd has identified and run with. That is to say, the company has a number of competitors now in the market.\n\nJust last week, Germany-based Mambu, which also provides an API-based suite of services (7,000 at last count) under the idea of \"banking as a service,\" raised $135 million at a valuation of over $2 billion. Stripe, a backer of Rapyd, also has continued to expand and add a number of services well beyond payments. Thought Machine also raised a big round last year; Temenos\u00a0and Italy\u2019s\u00a0Edera are also strong players here.\n\nAnd the field has so much opportunity that it's even attracting a lot of newer entrants: witness Unit, another interesting player that came out of stealth in the U.S. in December with an interesting list of backers of its own.\n\n\"To build financial infrastructure, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are a small mom and pop or something bigger, you need many things, and if you want to sell in more than one jurisdiction you need a lot of those services,\" Shtilman noted about the need for scale and breadth in a fintech platform proposition.\u00a0He's also very sanguine about competition.\n\n\"They have emerged like mushrooms after the rain,\" he said. \"But if you don\u2019t have competition it means you don\u2019t have a business, so this is good. It means there is a lot of demand. But for now we are the market leader. We think we will become the AWS of this space.\"\n\nThat's where investors like Coatue are also landing for now.\n\n\u201cThe payment landscape varies dramatically across countries. A company doing business globally might need to accept hundreds of local payment methods. Rapyd\u2019s API, which abstracts away this complexity, is currently powering what we think are many of the world\u2019s most exciting companies,\u201d said Kris Fredrickson, managing partner at Coatue, in a statement. \u201cWe are honored to partner with Arik and team for the next phase of the Rapyd journey.\u201d",

Rytk\u00f6nen, 2021\nPublish Date: 2021-02-19\nThesis type: Master's thesis\nTutor: Oikarinen, Elias\nReviewer: Simonen, Jaakko\nOikarinen, Elias\n\n\nOn 23rd of June 2016 the United Kingdom (UK) held The United Kingdom European Union membership referendum on the question whether the country should remain in the European Union (EU). The result was that the UK decided to exit from the European Union. This event was coined as Brexit.\n\nThe primary objective of this Thesis is to estimate the impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom\u2019s import demand for bovine meat. In order to estimate the impact an econometric time series model is used to capture the unit price and income elasticities of import demand. The specific model used is Autoregressive Distibuted Lag Error Correction Model (ARDL-ECM). The results of the model are used to analyse possible impacts of different Brexit scenarios. The time series is based on annual data from 1993 until 2018. The data was collected from EUROSTAT, UN COMTRADE and UK government sources.\n\nThe results of the model were used to analyse possible impacts of Brexit. The results show that bovine meat imports from the EU are quite inelastic. The results from the thesis can be used to indicate possible magnitude of the changes due to Brexit. In order to capture better estimates for the impact of Brexit the elasticities gained from the Thesis could be utilized in a general- or partial equilibrium models.\n\nsee all\n\nCopyright information: \u00a9 Jere Rytk\u00f6nen, 2021.

        "text":"Seeking Alpha\nProfile| Send Message|\n( followers)\n\nBy Dave Goodboy\n\nGold has exploded higher during the past several years. The bullishness has been ignited by massive global fiscal stimulus programs, slowing production growth and aggressive purchasing of the yellow metal by several central banks. It's no wonder gold prices are up nearly 100% during the past five years.\n\nTake a look at the weekly chart:\n\n(click images to enlarge)\n\nAlthough the yellow metal is off its all-time 2011 highs of more than $1,900 per ounce, there is solid technical support in the $1,550 area, as you can see in the chart below. Gold has since bounced from this support, hitting $1,800 per ounce in October prior to falling back and finding support at the 50-week simple moving average at $1,665.\n\nDespite gold's solid performance over the years, gold-mining stocks have lagged. This is unusual, since gold-mining companies make their profit on the spread between what it costs to extract gold and the price of the commodity. Historically, there is a positive correlation between the price of gold and the performance of gold-mining stocks.\n\nBut starting in 2008, there has been a disconnect. Rising production costs, political risks in some of the regions where miners operate and simple economic worries have superseded the common-sense correlation. This has resulted in gold-mining stocks underperforming the commodity itself, which in turn has resulted in much of the negative investor sentiment around gold-mining stocks.\n\nAnd it is within this negativity that I see a great profit opportunity. The key strategy is simple: Buy undervalued gold-mining stocks poised for a reversal of fortune.\n\nIn this case, I think one particular gold miner is a diamond in the rough.\n\nBarrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:ABX) is one of the world's largest gold miners, with 27 operating mines in North America, South America, Australia and Africa. The stock has been smacked down from its recent high of $43 a share in mid-September to $34 in November, which is just above its 52-week low. Barrick Gold boasts the lowest price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of its peers at 10.2, and its 29% earnings growth rate is the highest among the competition.\n\nHedge Fund Ownership\nThe fact that hedge fund wizard David Einhorn doubled his position in the stock during the third quarter and held it steadily this quarter despite the price drop, gives me even more confidence in Barrick Gold. The gold miner makes up about 1.3% of Einhorn's U.S. long portfolio (1.9 million shares), indicating a strong bullish bias for the company.\n\nThe Future\nBarrick Gold has ambitious plans to reduce costs while ramping up copper production in the coming years.\n\nNew CEO Jamie Sokalsky is pushing for Barrick's mining costs to drop from $575 per ounce to between $500 and $525 per ounce during the next several years. The cost reduction will come from two mines in the Dominican Republic and on the Chile\/Argentina border, which have relatively lower operating costs.\n\nAlthough Barrick has narrowed its gold production forecast to between 7.3 and 7.5 million ounces from earlier projections of 7.8 million, Sokalsky is confident of a production increase during the next several years. If gold and copper prices stay steady, then the lower production costs will result in increased operating cash flow. Interestingly, despite all these tailwinds, the stock has dropped nearly 30% this year.\n\nAt the end of October, Barrick's price plunged through the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages, finally finding support at $33 a share. Most recently, shares have bounced above $34. The weekly chart indicates support at $32.\n\nThe company plans to release its full-year earnings report on February 15, 2013. Savvy investors will likely be waiting attentively.\n\nRisks to Consider: Commodity-based stocks are inherently risky. The risk comes from several sides, namely the volatile nature of commodity prices. If gold prices unexpectedly plunge, then so will mining stocks. In addition, political and economic risks also loom largely due to the fact that many gold mines are located in politically and economically unstable regions. Always be certain to use stops and position size properly when investing.\n\nConsidering the stock's current value and the company's future plans, Barrick Gold is a great buy now. Any price between $32 and $35 would make an ideal entry. If gold prices remain relatively steady and the company meets its cost-reduction goals, then shares could easily rise to $50 within 24 months. My trading strategy with this company would be to enter a position within the $32 to $35 channel with stops at $32.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
