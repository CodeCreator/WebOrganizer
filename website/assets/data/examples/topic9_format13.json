SBA acted under its own authority, as provided by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act that was recently signed by the President, to declare a disaster following a request received from Gov.\u00a0JB Pritzker on March 17, 2020.\nThe disaster declaration makes SBA assistance available in the entire state of Illinois; and the contiguous counties of Clinton, Des Moines, Dubuque, Jackson, Lee, Louisa, Muscatine and Scott in Iowa; Benton, Gibson, Knox, Lake, Newton, Posey, Sullivan, Vermillion, Vigo and Warren in Indiana; Ballard, Crittenden, Livingston, McCracken and Union in Kentucky; Cape Girardeau, Clark, Jefferson, Lewis, Lincoln, Marion, Mississippi, Perry, Pike, Ralls, Saint Charles, Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Sainte Genevieve and Scott in Missouri; and Grant, Green, Kenosha, Lafayette, Rock and Walworth in Wisconsin.\n\u201cSBA is strongly committed to providing the most effective and customer-focused response possible to assist Illinois small businesses with federal disaster loans. We will be swift in our efforts to help these small businesses recover from the financial impacts of the Coronavirus (COVID-19),\u201d said Administrator Carranza.\nSBA Customer Service Representatives will be available to answer questions about SBA\u2019s Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and explain the application process.\n\u201cSmall businesses, private non-profit organizations of any size, small agricultural cooperatives and small aquaculture enterprises that have been financially impacted as a direct result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) since Jan. 31, 2020, may qualify for Economic Injury Disaster Loans of up to $2\u00a0million to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses which could have been met had the disaster not occurred,\u201d said Carranza.\n\u201cThese loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that can\u2019t be paid because of the disaster\u2019s impact. Disaster loans can provide vital economic assistance to small businesses to help overcome the temporary loss of revenue they are experiencing,\u201d Carranza added.\nEligibility for Economic Injury Disaster Loans is based on the financial impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The interest rate is 3.75 percent for small businesses. The interest rate for private non-profit organizations is 2.75 percent.

A methodical approach is recommended: develop a holistic strategy rather than jumping on the bandwagon.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDownload the full report here.\n\n\nBack to Top",

When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest.

Funds investing in a single industry (or group of industries), country or in a limited geographic region generally are more volatile than more diversified funds. Investments in lower\u2010quality (\"junk bonds\") and non-rated securities present greater risk of loss than investments in higher-quality securities. Performance of the Fund may diverge from that of the Underlying Index due to operating expenses, transaction costs, cash flows, use of sampling strategies or operational inefficiencies An investment in this fund should be considered only as a supplement to a complete investment program for those investors willing to accept the risks associated with that fund.

The Company also believes certain social media accounts of some Company board members may have been impersonated or disabled for short periods of time. The Company believes these attacks were purposefully designed to manipulate the price of the Company\u2019s shares, with the aim of causing a stock price decline in order to economically benefit the short sellers, to the detriment of the Company\u2019s public shareholders.\n\nSOS stands behind the integrity of the Company and remains committed to maintaining transparency and the highest ethical principles. SOS reserves all rights that it may have against these short sellers and will defend itself vigorously against those behind these attacks and misleading allegations.

SOS looks forward to vigorously defending itself, addressing these matters and providing more information in the coming days.\n\nThe Company also plans to enhance its investor relations capabilities in the future.

        "text":"Parseq, the international business process outsourcing firm, has announced the sale of its contact centre division to Scotland-based customer services outsourcer, Kura Group.\n\nThe terms of the sale, which follows a successful turnaround of the business led by its Executive Chairman and CEO Rami Cassis, are undisclosed, but the deal creates significant value for shareholders.\n\nParseq\u2019s Finance and Administration division, which is Parseq\u2019s historic core business, will continue to operate from its existing site at Hellaby, Yorkshire.\n\nParseq was originally founded by Mr Cassis as Documetric in 2007, following the buyout of Atos Origin\u2019s payment processing division where he was Managing Director. In 2010, following a string of acquisitions, it acquired AIM-listed business software group Intelligent Environments Group in a reverse takeover. Mr, Cassis subsequently took the business private in 2012 as a significant shareholder by setting up his own Private Equity fund ( Having overseen significant growth Mr Cassis then stepped back from the day-to-day operation of the business and appointed a sub advisory team from another PE firm to manage business operations.\n\nAfter a period of poor trading, he terminated the sub-advisory team and the Parseq board and returned to an executive role as Chairman and CEO in October 2016. He has since led a successful turnaround of the company from loss-making to \u00a33m profit, with a growing order book of blue-chip clients and an international footprint with partnerships in six continents. Sales have grown consistently over the last two years to \u00a344m in its latest financial year, whilst headcount has grown to around 1,700.\n\nThe sale will allow Parseq to focus on the continued growth of its Finance & Administration division, which will continue to offer a range of solutions to manage and streamline back office processes. Every year, it digitises 25 million customer correspondence documents and processes \u00a315 billion of electronic payments, driving efficiencies and significant cost savings for a range of clients including FTSE 100 financial services companies, local authorities and energy and utility providers.\n\nCommenting on the sale, Rami Cassis, Executive Chairman and CEO of Parseq and Managing Partner of Parabellum Capital, said: \u201cThe turnaround and sale of Parseq\u2019s contact centre division demonstrates the value of investors who can deliver operational knowledge as well as capital. Too many private equity firms lack meaningful management experience, and as a result are failing to maximise the potential of the businesses in which they invest.\n\n\u201cThe last 5 years have helped to shape and focus my strategy on current investments and future acquisitions. \u00a0Deep domain expertise remains crucial but so does the company you keep in these ventures. My focus remains the acquisition of mid-market firms & corporate disposals in fintech, business services, oilfield services & defence.\n\n\u201cI now look forward to supporting the leadership team to continue Parseq\u2019s stellar growth through its Finance and Administration division, which has secured nine new client wins this year and has a strong sales pipeline up to 2021, whilst remaining focused on developing Parabellum Capital\u2019s investment portfolio.\u201d\n\nRami is the founder and Managing Partner of Parabellum, the General Partner (GP) & fund which controls Parseq (, ieDigital (, a leading provider of digital banking software; and Razor Risk (, a provider of risk management technology and consulting solutions to global financial institutions.\n\n\n\nFor more information please contact:\n\nRory Fletcher\n\nT: +44 (0)131 516 5654\u00a0\u00a0M: +44 (0)7976 351552",

Canadians Take Responsibility When It Comes to Retirement Planning: RBC\n\nWho's Contributing to Your Nest Egg? Canadians Take Responsibility When It Comes to Retirement Planning: RBC\n\nFewer than one-third of North Americans confident they will have enough money for a secure retirement\n\nTORONTO, May 9, 2012 - When it comes to ensuring their financial security in retirement, Canadians overall believe that they are primarily responsible (59 per cent), with the rest of this duty falling to the government (19 per cent), their employer (10 per cent), another family member (eight per cent) and their financial advisor (five per cent), according to the latest RBC Canadian Consumer Outlook (RBC CCO).\n\n\"It's encouraging to see Canadians playing their part in planning for their retirement,\" said Amalia Costa, head, Retirement Strategies, RBC. \"This is a financial responsibility that you don't have to undertake alone. A financial advisor can assist you in getting started, understanding your options, incomes sources and determining what the best approach is for you.\"\n\nWhen it comes to looking at their prospects for retirement, consumers on both sides of the border share similar beliefs. Canadians (61 per cent) are more confident of their understanding of the retirement savings options available to them with almost half (45 per cent) of Americans saying the same. However, only 29 per cent of Americans and 36 per cent of Canadians are confident that they will have enough money to have a secure retirement.\n\nWhat is troubling, particularly given the aging populations, is that four-in-10 (42 per cent) of Americans and 37 per cent of Canadians are worried they won't have enough money saved to be financially secure. Consequently, more than one-in-four North Americans believe they will have to work past retirement age to make enough money to live, with slightly more Americans (29 per cent) than Canadians (26 per cent) believing this to be true. To address their concern about financial security in retirement, 34 per cent of Canadians and 36 per cent of Americans say they save a regular amount of money from each paycheque.\n\nIn Canada, more than half (54 per cent) said they didn't have enough money to take advantage of all the savings options available to them, and 15 per cent claim there are too many options available to make clear decisions on how to properly invest their money.\n\n\"With the volumes of financial and investment information available, awareness of the need to save is greater than ever before, and even for those who have retirement savings plans, meeting retirement goals can become a challenge,\" added Costa. \"If you are able to, there are catch-up strategies you could use to reach your retirement goals.\"\n\nTo catch up on retirement savings, Costa advises doing the following:\n\n  \u2022 Make regular contributions to your RRSP: Sometimes, people who are behind in their saving are reluctant to even explore strategies that could help them get back on track. Why? Because they think they can't afford it. One approach is to start slowly, setting aside small amounts. Consider an automatic RRSP contribution program to make these small steps a priority in your financial life.\n  \u2022 Invest your tax refund: If you receive a tax refund, take advantage of this new found money by investing it in your TFSA or RRSP. You will not only be growing your investment savings, you'll also be ahead in your contributions for that current tax year.\n  \u2022 Take out an RRSP loan: In certain situations, it makes sense to take out a loan to top up your RRSP. For example, if you have unused RRSP contribution room, you can borrow money to catch-up, and then use the tax savings to help repay the loan.\n  \u2022 Consider adjusting your current lifestyle: Making some lifestyle sacrifices now can help you retire with a higher standard of living.\n\nAbout RBC's savings and other financial advice and interactive tools\nCanadians can freely access savings advice and resources at In addition, all personal RBC online banking clients can use myFinanceTracker, a no-cost interactive financial management tool, to create a budget and track their spending habits. Whether Canadians want to get more from their day to day banking, protect what's important, save and invest, borrow with confidence or take care of their businesses, the RBC Advice Centre can help answer their questions. Interactive tools and calculators provide customized information covering many facets of personal finance.

Weighting was then employed to balance demographics and ensure that the sample's composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. Data collection was April 2 to 9, 2012. A survey with an unweighted probability sample of this size and a 100 per cent response rate would have an estimated margin of error of \u00b11.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, of what the results would have been had the entire population of adults in Canada been polled.\n\nAbout the RBC U.S. Consumer Outlook Index\nThe RBC U.S. Consumer Outlook Index provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive outlook of U.S. consumers based on data collected from interviews with a nationally representative sample of more than 1,000 U.S. adults conducted over a multi-day polling period each month by Ipsos, the world's second-largest market and opinion research firm. The results in this news release reflect some of the findings of the Ipsos poll of 1,005 U.S. adults conducted on March 29- April 1, 2012. The RBC Consumer Outlook Index is released within 36 hours after the U.S. online panel members are interviewed. Weighting is employed to balance demographics and ensure that the survey sample's composition reflects that of the U.S. adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. Statistical margins of error are not applicable to online polls because they are based on samples drawn from opt-in online panels, not on random samples that mirror the population within a statistical probability ratio. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error.\n\n- 30 -\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nSuzanne Willers, RBC Corporate Communications,\n416 974-2727,\n\nCraig Christie, RBC Corporate Communications,\n416 974-8820,\n\n\nRelated Media\n\nProvincial Releases",

        "text":"New Survey Reveals Burden of Student Debt on Young Employees\n\nAmerican Student Assistance Survey Examines Impact of Student Debt on Young Workers and Explores Potential Employer-Driven Benefits; 90 Percent Would Commit for Five Years in Exchange for Help\n\nBOSTON--()--More than half of all young workers worry about repaying their student debt either all the time or often according to a new survey by American Student Assistance\u00ae, a private nonprofit dedicated to eliminating finance as a barrier to education and the dreams education enables. Nearly ninety percent of these young employees say they would commit to a job for five years in return for help with their student loans.\n\nThe Young Workers and Student Debt survey polled 502 young workers between the ages of 22 and 33 as well as 451 human resource managers at companies with at least 100 employees. The results highlight the many challenges faced by young workers with student debt and the strong demand for benefits such as financial literacy, one-on-one counseling, sign-on bonuses and student loan repayment.\n\n\u201cYoung workers feel highly stressed out as a result of the burden of student debt and that debt clearly impacts their health and productivity in the workplace,\u201d said Kevin Fudge, director of consumer advocacy and ombudsman at ASA. \u201cEmployers should realize that in order to retain the brightest young talent and demonstrate their commitment to employee well-being, they need to provide concrete and straightforward solutions to help alleviate this burden.\u201d\n\nYoung Workers and Student Debt highlights how rising student loan debt is negatively affecting young workers\u2019 focus, well-being and retirement planning as well as delaying their pursuit of further higher education. More than 3 out of out 5 young workers say their priority is paying off student loans and not contributing to a 401K or other retirement plan. The research also reveals a gap between human resource managers and their young workforce as to the perceived impact of student loans and the solutions that young workers are seeking in exchange for their loyalty.\n\nKey findings from Young Workers and Student Debt include:\n\n1) Student Loans Have Various Detrimental Impacts on Young Workers\n\na. 56% worry about repaying their loan either all the time (26%) or often (30%).\nb. 40% report that worrying about their student loans has impacted their health.\nc. 55% would like to go to grad school but couldn\u2019t take on any additional student loans.\nd. 61% have considered getting a second job to help pay off their student loans.\n\n2) A Lack of Resources and the Burden of Loans Are Hindering Retirement Planning\n\na. 63% of young workers report that they don\u2019t have anyone to turn to for help with regard to paying off their student loans.\nb. 75% of HR professionals report that their company does not offer any guidance or assistance regarding student loans.\nc. 54% of young workers report that right now, paying off student loans comes first, and they will put off saving for retirement until later.\n\n3) Young Workers Would Respond Positively to Employers Who Offer Student Loan Benefits\n\na. 86% say they would commit to an employer for 5 years if the company helped pay back their student loans.\nb. 93% of young workers would take advantage of a sign-on bonus targeted at paying back student loans; 92% would take advantage of a match for student loan repayments similar to a 401k match.\nc. 89% would take advantage of overall long-term financial planning.\nd. 79% would take advantage of free access to a student debt loan counselor.\n\nThe survey was conducted online in January 2017 by Regina Corso Consulting.
