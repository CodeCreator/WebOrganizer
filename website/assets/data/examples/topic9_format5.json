        "text":"Common Insurance Questions, Honest Answers\n\n\nHave a burning insurance question? If so, chances are the customer advocates in ERIE\u2019s Customer Service department have answered it many times before. Here\u2019s a list of the most common\u00a0ones they receive via ERIE\u2019s toll-free number and Facebook\u00ae page.\n\nI\u2019m buying a car. Do I have coverage?\n\nYou\u2019ll have automatic coverage for a newly acquired car if you already have a similar vehicle (in this case, a car) on your policy, ERIE insures all your other cars and the new car you buy is titled to the named insured on your existing policy. This applies whether the car you buy replaces an old car or is an additional vehicle.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re adding something different (for instance, a motorcycle when you only insure a car), that might not apply. The takeaway? Always ask your ERIE Insurance Agent about coverage before you make a purchase.\n\nMy son lives with me and has a driver\u2019s license, but he never drives my car. Do I have to add him to my auto insurance policy?\n\nTechnically, yes. Emergencies happen, and it\u2019s hard to guarantee that he\u2019ll never need to drive the car. To keep you and your family protected, all licensed drivers in your household should have their own policy or be added to yours. If you swear that Junior will never drive your car, your Agent or an underwriter may require you to specifically exclude your child from your auto policy. Always check with your ERIE Insurance Agent as not all states offer driver exclusion options.\n\nMy claim wasn\u2019t covered when my roof sprang a leak. Why?\n\nSince policies differ too much to give a blanket answer, your ERIE Insurance Agent should always be the first person you call about these kinds of matters. One thing that\u2019s not covered: routine wear-and-tear. For example, if your roof springs a leak simply because it\u2019s old, you can\u2019t expect your policy to kick in like it would for damage caused by a peril like lightning.\n\nIf you do file a valid claim, you\u2019ll be glad to have Guaranteed Replacement Cost. This coverage guarantees that you\u2019ll be able to rebuild your home after a major loss without worrying about depreciation, policy limits or insurance construction costs. ERIE automatically includes it as a part of many of its homeowners policies*\u2014and you can purchase an affordable endorsement for the policies that don\u2019t include it.\n\nDoes ERIE offer a good student driver discount?\n\nWe don\u2019t have a discount by that name, but we do offer the Youthful Driver Discount that can save eligible licensed drivers ages 20 and under up to 20 percent on their car insurance. Plus, drivers under age 21 who complete an accredited driver\u2019s education course may also be eligible for discounts. Check with your Agent to see if your young driver qualifies.\n\nFor extra savings, consider ERIE Rate Lock\u00ae**. This policy endorsement freezes your auto premium year after year even if you file a claim. Your rate only changes when you add or remove a vehicle or a driver from your policy or change the location where your car is garaged.\n\nDoes ERIE have a diminishing deductible?\n\nYes, through the ERIE Auto Enhancement Endorsement. For each consecutive policy year in which you don\u2019t file a claim, your deductible will be reduced by $100, up to a maximum amount of $500. Eligibility varies by state, so check with your Agent to see if you qualify.\n\nCan you send me a new insurance card?\n\nWe can\u2014but it\u2019s also good to know that you can print out a card simply by logging onto your account at\n\nI turned 24 shortly after my policy went into effect. Can you give me the adult rate?\n\nERIE offers drivers the lower adult rate at age 24\u2014a nice benefit since many carriers don\u2019t offer it until you turn 29. Unfortunately, your policy is based on your age at the time the policy was written or renewed, so we can\u2019t prorate it during the policy period. But know you\u2019ll get the adult rate at your next renewal!\n\nLike us on Facebook\u00ae\n\nYou like your favorite sports team. You like your alma mater. Heck, you might even like your favorite brand of soap. So why not like your insurance company, too? By clicking the \u201clike\u201d button at, you\u2019ll gain access to information about staying safe, being covered and more. There are sweepstakes and giveaways, too!\n\nJust remember that safety and security reasons prevent ERIE from answering any specific policy questions or comments on a public forum like Facebook\u00ae. For those type of things, call or email your Agent or an ERIE customer advocate.\n\n*Guaranteed Replacement Cost requires home improvements over $5,000 to be reported within\n90 days. Coverage of costs to comply with laws or ordinances is subject to limits. Depreciation may be deducted until repair or replacement is made. Go to contact your Agent for more information.\n\n**Not available in North Carolina, Maryland and New York. Limited to three years in Virginia. ERIE Rate Lock\u00ae does not guarantee continued insurance coverage. Insured must meet applicable underwriting guidelines. Premium may change if you make a policy change.

What happens if I don't make an enrollment change during the Open Season because I want to be covered by my spouse's private health insurance plan?\n\nBy regulation, an employee who does not change the enrollment during the Open Season is considered to have canceled the plan in which enrolled. The cancellation is effective the day before the first day of the first full pay period in January. The plan is responsible for providing coverage only through midnight of that date. If you're not sure of the date, you should contact your Human Resources Office and not the plan for the effective date.\n\nYou should be aware that you are not entitled to a 31-day extension of coverage because the action is considered a cancellation and not a termination. You cannot reenroll in the FEHB Program until the next open season. Also, this is considered a break in coverage. The 5-year requirement to continue your enrollment into retirement will begin when you reenroll in the FEHB Program. If you are within five years of retirement, you will have to work additional time to be eligible to continue your enrollment into retirement.\n\nIf you are an annuitant, you are deemed to have enrolled in the standard option of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Service Benefit Plan. OPM deems annuitants into the standard option of BCBS by default (and by law) if they do not make a plan selection. If annuitants cancel their FEHB enrollment, they can never reenroll.\n\nControl Panel\n\nUnexpected Error\n\nThere was an unexpected error when performing your action.\n\nYour error has been logged and the appropriate people notified.

Do you think I will qualify?\nAnswered on Tuesday, May 23rd, 2017 by\nAmy Miller\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had a chance to establish your credit, a secured credit card is a good option to do so. And Skypass secured card is not an exception. Like any other secured credit card, this card is designed for someone with no credit or bad credit history. The card requires a security deposit, and the minimum deposit is pretty high \u2013 $300. It is possible to find secured credit cards with a lower minimum deposit.\n\nThe Skypass secured card will allow you to earn miles on eligible purchases. If you manage your card responsibly for a year, you may be able to move to an unsecured credit account. The Skypass secured card is not the only secured credit card that offer rewards. There are other secured cards that allow to earn rewards on all credit card purchases. Upgrades are also available, and with some issuers you don\u2019t have to wait a year to upgrade to an unsecured account.\n\nOther Popular Secured Credit Card FAQs\n\nIn order to get your deposit back you need to close your credit card account and pay your card balance in full. After you paid your card off, contact the credit card issuer to request a refund of your security deposit.\n\nContinue \u00bb\n\nA secured card may be a great option though for getting a credit card and rebuilding your credit as secured cards are usually reported to the credit bureaus \u2013 Experian, TransUnion or Equifax.

The bill clarifies that many activities conducted by nonprofits, such as educational conferences, trainings, recreational sports, and most fundraising events would no longer be subject to the tax.

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nYou\u2019ve got frequent questions. We\u2019ve got frequent answers.\n\nWhy does Good Four exist?\u00a0\n\nResearch shows that employees who volunteer through the workplace are less stressed, have stronger bonds with their colleagues, and are 2x more likely to be happy with the progression of their careers. Volunteerism in the workplace is good for employees, good for communities, and it\u2019s redefining what it means to do good business.\n\nWe want brands and organizations to see that making time for good doesn\u2019t have to be costly or complicated to have a powerfully positive impact on their companies and communities. In doing so, our goal is to continue growing a movement of brands and organizations that offer their employees paid volunteer hours each month.\n\nUm, are there seven fingers in the Good Four logo?\n\nYep, and there are seven books in the Harry Potter series. That\u2019s reason enough for it being a perfect number. If that\u2019s still not enough for you, there is also this \u2014 Good Four is your chance to expand your reach to increase your impact. Our four-finger peace sign is a visual way to show that it will take more than just ourselves to create change and influence others. We also wanted the logo to stand out a bit, because we want you to stand out on 4\/4 with your four hours.\n\nWho can participate in Good Four?\u00a0\n\nYou. It really is that simple. You. Your friends. Your co-workers. Everyone. Good Four is a chance for all of us to come together and do a little good. Our goal is to increase the impact factor beyond 4\/4 by inspiring companies to make paid volunteer time a part of the benefits package -- and something they offer employees every month of the year. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be a company (or an employee of a company) to participate. Everyone is welcome to join in on Good Four!\n\nHow does Good Four work?\n\nStep 1:\u00a0\nSign up here to count your team in for Good Four.\n\nStep 2:\u00a0\nSet aside four hours on 4\/4 for your team to volunteer their time or talent to a nonprofit or cause of their choosing.\n\nStep 3:\u00a0\nBlock that time on the calendar + let everyone know what\u2019s happening.\n\nStep 4:\nDecide whether you will volunteer as individuals for organizations focused on personal passions or collectively as a team.\n\nStep 5:\nReach out to those organization(s) to get things in place for 4\/4.\n\nStep 6:\nWhen you do your Good Four time on 4\/4, be sure to use the hashtag #GoodFour to share your Good Four story on Instagram.\n\nWho's in charge of this shindig?\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019d be us. (Hey there!) We\u2019re Brains on Fire, a creative company that believes in the power of human connection. We partner with bold brands and organizations that want to do more good in the world. (We also drink a lot of sparkling water and never met a donut we didn\u2019t like.) You\u2019ll find our offices in Greenville, SC and Los Angeles, CA. You can also find us at\n\nWhat's in it for us?\u00a0\n\nGood karma. Warm fuzzies. That loving feeling. Humblebragging rights.

While we wait for 4\/4 what can we do?\nHow can we help?\u00a0\n\nStart sharing Good Four on social media. Drink some wine and launch a message in a bottle. Send out a flock of carrier pigeons. But seriously, tell all your brand friends. Challenge fellow companies to a Good Four showdown to see who can volunteer the most Good Four house. Send them to this website. The more, the merrier.\n\nWhat if I can\u2019t volunteer on 4\/4? Can I still participate in Good Four?\n\nYes! While we encourage everyone to volunteer as part of the national effort on 4\/4, you can still totally be a part of Good Four even if you can\u2019t do your volunteer hours on that day. Just sign up to participate, pledge your hours, and we\u2019ll let you take things from there. (On the honor system.) Be sure to use the hashtag #GoodFour to share how you\u2019re giving back and paying it forward.",

        "text":"EMV Security for Debit Cards\n\nEMV for Debit Cards\n\nShop Securely with EMV\n\nCCU continues to be committed to our Members' security. That's why we're bringing our Members an additional level of protection by making EMV (also known as chip-enabled cards) available to all of our Members.\n\nEMV uses micro-chip technology to increase VISA Debit Card security when shopping in-store. Your card will also include the magnetic stripe that it currently has, giving you the ability to use EMV at merchants who support it and the magnetic stripe at all other locations. So you can shop anywhere and everywhere -- with added peace of mind!\n\nEnhanced Security:\n\n  \u2022 The security EMV technology provides has been used globally for the last decade and is proven to reduce counterfeit fraud.\n  \u2022 EMV cards provide better fraud protection than traditional cards when used at a chip enabled terminal. They have an embedded microchip that turns cardholder's information into a unique code, making it difficult to duplicate.\n\nEasy and Convenient\n\nEMV technology is available in the U.S. and easy to use! Simply swipe your card and follow the terminal prompts to complete a transaction at a chip terminal.\n\nPlease note, not all merchants are currently accepting EMV Debit Cards, it is important you follow the terminal prompts for accurate directions.\n\nHaven't received your EMV chip credit card? One will be arriving soon!\n\n\nQ. Now that I have an EMV VISA Debit Card, do I need to notify CCU before I travel internationally?\n\nA. We recommend that you set a travel notice on any card(s) you plan to use while traveling, so your card access isn't interrupted. To set a travel note, call Consumers Credit Union at (877) 275-2228!\n\nQ. Can I still use my EMV card at an ATM?\n\nA. Yes. You can continue to use your EMV VISA Debit Card at the ATM as you do today. The card will be left in the ATM until your transaction is complete.\n\nQ. Is an EMV card the same as contactless payment?\n\nA. No. Forms of contactless payment employ near-field communication technology (NFC) and work by waving or tapping your card in front of the merchant terminal.\n\nQ. What about recurring payments on my old card?\n\nA. Any reoccurring payments that use your old debit card will need your updated information. Give them your new card number, expiration date, and 3-digit security code.\n\nQ. How does an EMV card work for Internet and telephone transactions?\n\nA. Your Internet and telephone transactions will work just as they do today.\n\nQ. How do I pay at a chip card reader?\n\nA. You will still swipe your card as normal. If the merchant is accepting EMV VISA Debit Cards, the card reader will ask that you insert the EMV chip into the terminal. The card will be left in the terminal until your purchase is complete. Follow any additional terminal prompts.\n\nSome merchants may require the PIN to be used for transaction processing.\n\nQ. Do I still need to sign the back of my card?\n\nA. Yes, you need to sign the back of your card for security purposes.\n\nQ. Will I need to select a new Personal Identification Number (PIN)?\n\nA. Yes. When activating your EMV VISA Debit Card, please follow the prompts and select a new PIN.\n\nQ. Can I still use my old VISA Debit Card?\n\nA. No, your new EMV card replaces your old VISA Debit Card. Please shred or cut up your old card for security.\n\nQ. Where can I use my EMV VISA Debit Card in the U.S.?\n\nA. You are able to use your card anywhere that accepts VISA Debit Cards. More and more merchants and ATMs will be accepting chip-enabled cards.\n\nQ. Why does my CCU VISA Debit Card now have a chip?\n\nA. Financial Institutions around the world are including chips in cards and merchants are moving to EMV terminals to increase security and reduce fraud resulting from counterfeit, lost, and stolen cards.",
