        "text":"Publication Details\n\nPhiladelphia Tax Alert\n\nTo Our Clients and Friends:\n\n\u00a0Fineman Krekstein and Harris, P.C. is the premier law firm helping Philadelphia real estate owners avoid onerous and inaccurate City of Philadelphia taxes.\u00a0 We are proud of our recognized record of achievement.\n\n\u00a0Over the last year, there has been uncertainty regarding Philadelphia real estate taxes for tax-year 2013.\u00a0 Recently enacted state legislation along with unsettled and shifting budget discussions at Philadelphia City Council have added to the confusion. Accordingly, we have summarized below some frequently asked questions, along with some recommended actions:\n\n1.\u00a0What should I do to protect my real estate interests?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0As a result of the recession, the City\u2019s assessment of your property\/properties may be overvalued.\u00a0 You should carefully review the market value of any property subject to Philadelphia taxes.\u00a0 To determine the City\u2019s current assessed value of any property, go to the Office of Property Assessment (\u201cOPA\u201d) website (, or the information may be found on your tax bill.\u00a0 If you believe the City\u2019s assessment overvalued your property, assemble documentation of income and expenses along with any recent appraisals and contact David Fineman (215-893-8701) or Gary Krimstock (215-893-8722) at our office.\u00a0 They can review and evaluate your case for a potential tax appeal before the October 1, 2012 filing deadline.\n\n\u00a02.\u00a0What is the current status of the Philadelphia real estate tax system?\nPrior to 2012, the state-established ratio of tax assessment to market value had been set at 32%.\u00a0 The State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) lowered the Common Level Ratio for Philadelphia for tax-year 2012 to 25.2%.\u00a0 For the 2012 tax-year, only those properties for which an appeal had already been filed were eligible to seek the 25.2% ratio. The City is contesting all of those appeals in Court.\u00a0 As a result of recently enacted state legislation, the ratio will return to 32% beginning for the 2013 tax-year, the same ratio that was applied to all properties in Philadelphia for the 2011 tax-year.\u00a0\n\n\u00a03.\u00a0Will I see an increase in my assessed value?\n\u00a0The City is committed to implementing the Actual Value Initiative (AVI). AVI is a uniform property tax method that assesses properties at actual fair market value.\u00a0 Obviously, depending on the tax rate that the City applies, those properties that have historically been significantly undervalued may suffer a dramatic tax increase in tax-year 2014.\u00a0 Most commercial properties in Philadelphia, and residential properties in the greater Center City area, as well as certain other neighborhoods, are undervalued for tax assessment purposes.\u00a0 We do not expect these changes to occur for the 2013 tax-year, the AVI is likely to be implemented for tax year 2014.\n\n\u00a04.\u00a0How do these changes affect my primary residence?\n\u00a0As a result of recently enacted state legislation, the Homestead Exemption will not be phased in until the actual value initiative is established in the 2014 tax-year.\u00a0 There has been notice from many sources, encouraging property owners to file for the Homestead Exemption for principal residences in Philadelphia.\u00a0 Filing details and requirements will be announced when they have been finalized, and including the amount of the Exemption.",

We are committed to protecting your medical records, and have strict rules to make sure our staff and anyone who needs to see your records keep all your member information confidential. Your medical records or claims details may have to be reviewed. If so, precautions are taken to keep your information safe. In many cases your identity, such as name and address, will not be included in the information given during the review.\n\nBack to top\n\nHas my coverage started? Can I use my health plan?\n\nYour first premium payment activates your coverage, so you can start using your health plan within 1\u20132 days of making your payment, depending on how you pay.\n\nAfter you've made your first payment and your coverage is activated, you can have health care expenses during that coverage gap applied to your deductible, or even get paid back for some services. In this case, the coverage gap would be the time between your requested effective date and the date you make your first payment.\n\nBack to top\n\nI need to get a prescription filled but don't have my ID card yet. What can I do?\n\nEven if you haven't received your ID card, you should have received a new member welcome letter within days of your enrollment being completed. Your member identification and group number listed on your welcome letter can be used by the pharmacy to verify your benefits. You will need to pay your first premium payment before you can use your prescription benefits.\n\nBack to top\n\nI applied on the Health Insurance Exchange, but haven't heard if my application has been received and accepted. Did my coverage start on the effective date I requested?\n\nWe receive new applications from the Exchange every day. If you applied through the Exchange, it will take a few days for processing through the Exchange before they are sent to us. It then takes us about 5\u201310 business days to process your enrollment in the BCBSNM system.\n\nIf you just applied recently, we encourage you to wait to see if you receive your membership information soon. If you applied weeks ago and have not received anything from us, it is possible your application has been held up for some reason.\n\nIf you applied on the Health Insurance Exchange or with BCBSNM online and you have not received information from us, call our Customer Service Center at 866-236-1702 and we will look up the status of your application. Our call volumes are still very high, so you may have to hold for a long period before getting through. We will help you as quickly as possible.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhen will I get my member ID cards, and how many will I get?\n\nYou should get your member ID cards in the mail soon after your application is approved. Individual and family PPO members will receive no more than 2 membership ID cards. Please note that all member ID cards will have only the subscriber name on it, but can be used by all of the dependents enrolled under the policy. HMO Individual and family plans will get a card for each member enrolled.\n\nYou can print a temporary ID card and request additional cards through your Blue Access for Members account. You will need your member identification number and group number to log in to Blue Access for Members. These numbers can be found on the new member welcome letter you will receive within days of enrolling.\n\nBack to top\n\nI received my ID cards in the mail but they only have my name on them and not my spouse's. Can I get another ID card with their name on it?\n\nYour member ID cards will only have the primary subscriber's name on them, but they can be used by all of the dependents (in this case your spouse) enrolled under your policy.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhen will I get benefit coverage information and the contract on the plan I selected?\n\nWithin days of your application being accepted, you will receive a welcome letter from BCBSNM that includes your member identification number and group number. This information can be used by providers and pharmacies to verify your coverage until you get your member ID card. Your ID card will be sent separately soon after.\n\nYour policy information is available through your Blue Access for Members account once your plan is in effect.\n\nBack to top\n\nI've gotten a call from someone asking me questions about my new coverage. Is this person with BCBSNM, and why are they asking these questions?\n\nSince you have new coverage with us, we want to make sure you understand your benefits and that we have the information we need to help you with your health care needs. We are calling to:\n\n  \u2022 Explain how your plan works\n  \u2022 Answer questions you may have, and\n  \u2022 Tell you about some of the services we offer to help manage your care and your coverage.\n\nWe also check to make sure the information we have is correct, such as the names of everyone on your plan, your address and other details.\n\nThe call often only takes about 15 to 20 minutes. If you have any concern that the person calling you is not with BCBSNM, ask the caller for a number you can use to call us back.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhen I try to register for Blue Access for Members, I get a message telling me it's not available. When will it be available for me to register?\n\nYou may have received this error message during your registration for a number of reasons. Many times, the information you entered may not have matched the data in our system. Please remember to have your group and member ID numbers handy when you register. Both of these numbers can be found on your welcome letter and your member ID card.

Can I still buy health insurance?\n\nIn most cases, you can only sign up for a health insurance plan during the open enrollment period. If you missed open enrollment, you may be able to enroll during the special enrollment period. To be eligible, you must have had a qualifying \"life event\" within the past 60 days or experienced other complications that did not allow you to complete your enrollment . Learn more about special enrollment.\n\nBack to top\n\nI received a letter from Equian (formerly Trover Solutions) saying they have partnered with BCBSNM to investigate my medical claim. Should I respond to the letter?\n\nBCBSNM and Equian have partnered to review the medical claim listed on your letter to determine if another person or insurance company should be responsible for the claim. The claim we are investigating may be for treatment you received from an injury experienced at work or from an auto accident.\n\nThe information we are requesting is important. It could help to get back money that should be paid by someone else, like another insurance carrier. This process is one of several tools used by BCBSNM to help control rising costs of health care. Call the number, 800-696-4573, on the letter to answer the claim question.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat are my options to pay my premium?\n\nHere are convenient ways you can pay your bill.\n\nBack to top\n\nBCBSNM drafted my bank account twice. When will I get my money back?\n\nWe sincerely apologize for our error in drafting your bank account twice for your premium payment. We had two active policies for you in our system, which pulled your records twice when the automated drafts were processed. We have corrected the error in our system, so this should not happen again. We will mail a refund check for the overpayment amount within 5 days of the error. If you don't see it soon, please give us a call. In addition, if you had overdraft fees as a result of the double billing, please contact us so we can refund these charges as well. You can reach us at 800-792-8595.\n\nBack to top\n\nI applied for a plan on the Health Insurance Exchange and also applied for a plan directly with BCBSNM, so now I'm getting a bill for both. How do I cancel one?\n\nWe cannot process a cancellation request for a Exchange plan. If you want to cancel your Exchange plan, you can call the Exchange at 800-318-2596. If you want to cancel our off-Exchange plan, we can process that cancellation for you. Call Customer Service at 800-538-8833.
