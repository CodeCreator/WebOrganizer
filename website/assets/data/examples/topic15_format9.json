        "text":"For a business owner, installing a new roof is one of the most expensive investments that they can undertake. Even just one square foot of a new roof can cost almost several hundred dollars, and picking a random contractor can affect the whole project. It is vital to choose a professional and reputable roofing contractor to ensure a successful project. Once you already have a potential contractor, there are several questions you should ask before deciding to perform such a critical service.\u00a0\n\nTypically, commercial roofing contractors have to follow a specific set of standards when working on a building\u2019s roof. While roofing companies are set apart by a few qualifications, there are common questions that will give you the same peace of mind at the onset of the project. This checklist of items that you can ask your potential roofing companies will help get the answers that you think will arrive at the best solution. Read on to find out more about them.\n\nWhat You Should Ask Potential Roofing Contractors\u00a0\n\n1) Do you have the required proof of insurance and licensing?\u00a0\n\nThis question is quite obvious, and maybe a little bit trivial, but asking this question will help save you from encountering substantial liability issues. To work in a state, all roofing companies and contractors should have the needed insurance and license. One guarantee that a roofing company must have is a Commercial Liability Insurance, which covers their work, employees, and negligence in case of a safety hazard or damages. It means that your business won\u2019t have to pay for costs or face safety issues instead of holding the roofing company or the contractors responsible. A roofing company with these credentials and financial coverage means that they are trustworthy and value building codes.\u00a0\n\n2) Are there subcontractors included in the roofing project?\u00a0\n\nAside from a roofing company, some subcontractors work when a company needs extra hands on deck or assistance with specialty services like dealing with ventilation or electrical units. When doing a roofing project, you must know everyone working on it because subcontractors should also have a license and insurance. It all boils down to the most important thing\u2013 your business should not be responsible for liability for hazards and damages during or after the roofing project. It should be the ones working on the project or the materials manufacturing company.\u00a0\n\n3) Do you have previous experience working on a commercial roofing project?\n\nUnfortunately, you may find a company claiming to be a \u201ccommercial roofing company\u201d but has no commercial roofing experience. It could be that it is their first commercial roofing project if you hire them. If you don\u2019t want to take a risk, you should inquire about its previous retail work experience. The more a company has a positive experience with commercial roofing projects, the bigger chance you should hire them. Furthermore, you might want to look for a roofing contractor who knows how to handle the installation of domed roof hatches or any other roof access doors and panels that you might want.\u00a0\n\n4) Do you have a compilation of references and completed commercial roofing projects?\u00a0\n\nProving the worth and credibility of a roofing company\u2019s experience includes asking them for references for their other finished projects. Ask them for relevant references, which means commercial roofing references. A company\u2019s plethora of roofing references doesn\u2019t mean they are the most valuable. It would entail asking around to figure out if their previous customers are happy with similar work.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n5) What are your distinguishing features from your competitors?\u00a0\n\nThe most common but important question that you should ask is, of course, why should you hire the company? It would be best to ask them what makes them so unique compared to their competitors who also do the same job. When you ask the roofing company this question, they will have the reason to show you their scalability. There may be many reasons such as lower pricing than the industry standard or the charge of their competitors, or maybe they\u2019re using environmentally-friendly materials. Whatever the reason, there should be a distinguishing feature that will help you in choosing them.\u00a0\n\n6) Do you have fire safety measures for my roof?\u00a0\n\nAll business owners worry about their roof catching on fire. A fire-resistant roof is essential, especially in case of an accident that causes an explosion. In case sparks from an electrical unit or a lightning bolt hit the roof, it should be able to protect the entire building from catching fire. Keep in mind to ask the roofing company if there are safety measures from them in case of emergency fire situations.\u00a0\n\n7) Is it time for me to repair or replace my commercial building\u2019s roof?\u00a0\n\nThere are instances when you would think that your building\u2019s roof only needs minor repairs, but what if roof repairs aren\u2019t enough anymore? An inspection from the roofing contractor company for the entire roof should be a part of your checklist. They would know whether the roof can endure another repair or require a replacement.\n\n8) Can you give an estimated time for finishing the project?\u00a0\n\nIf you have a timeline for when you want the roof repairs or installation, setting a start date is a must. The confirmation of the start date with your roofing contractor will allow them to review the logistics and purchase the necessary materials. Once there is already a start date, you should ask the roofing contractor how much time they will need to complete the project. Having an estimated time from start to finish will help you and the contractor better understand the project.\u00a0\n\n\nThe roof of any building matters because it protects all occupants inside the building against outside elements. It holds especially for commercial businesses. Just imagine having a damaged roof\u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want that from disrupting your business operations. Avoid having such problems hiring the best commercial roofing contractor who can complete the project with the right suppliers and the right network.\u00a0\n\nFor a reliable supplier that you can partner with, visit us at today!\n\nLeave a comment",

        "text":"4 Shopping Guidelines for Fall Arrest Anchors\n\n\nWorkers who need to work on heights should always receive maximum protection. Everything should be planned adequately before they execute their jobs well. One of the things you should consider is providing an appropriate fall anchor for them.\n\nIt is not just merely connecting their anchors in a place where you think is safe enough, but the proper selection of material matters too. In many cases, injury or death happens not just because of the improper use of the equipment, but also from the lack of knowledge of the correct anchor to use. To prevent an accident from occurring, let\u2019s look closer the critical key takeaways you should put into action before your workforce starts a building project.\n\n1. The QA Certificate\n\nAlways find the quality assurance certificate when you select a fall arrest anchor. You can also check the label to see the inspections conducted before it was sold to the market. It will give you an idea that the equipment has undergone the quality inspections to ensure it reaches the standards required for ultimate safety and protection. It is more important to look for this label than focusing mainly on the price of the product.\n\n2. Comfort & Adjustability\n\nIt is essential to select the right anchor based on its specific application. The market offers a wide variety of equipment with different designs. Each of them is engineered based on its components and specific function. Make sure its parts such as for the shoulders, legs and waist fit well and is adjustable. It is essential to select an anchor that you can adjust to ensure you can wear it comfortably.\n\n3. Anchor Point\n\nAside from choosing the right fall anchor, it is also equally important to inspect the anchor point. It should be durable enough to support a 5000 pound force per person. Furthermore, it should also reach the minimum free fall clearances as regulated. As an example, a fall arrestor should be 3.5m while the lanyard is 5.7m. Attach the anchorage directly overhead as possible because of the pendulum effect that may unexpectedly happen. A fall arrest system should be durable. That said, a correct connection will also ensure you are protected from injury. It helps reduce the force whenever it is used in conjunction with a well-fitted and appropriate anchorage and a full body harness. Connectors vary from fall arrests to lanyards, so it is essential to identify the one that is suitable for your needs.\n\n4. Fire Retardant Anchor\n\nIt is also sometimes unavoidable to have the workers perform their duties around sharp edges. To prevent an accident, they need to use a fall anchor with maximum strength and flexibility. If the worker needs to do the grinding and welding, he should also wear a fall arrest anchor that is fire retardant.\n\nAlways remember the safety and protection of each worker is worth investing in. Wearing a correct fall arrest anchor should not be overlooked in every workplace that risks the lives of many laborers. It is best to ensure that you have the right equipment no matter how pricey it is because it will cost you more money if an accident occurs. Following all these recommendations will give you protection while you value your life.",

        "text":"5 things to know about fuel-fired heater\n\nFueled fired heaters\n\nFuel-fired heaters offer many solutions in regards to what you may be looking for. These types of units are commonly found in many types of atmospheres and industries including operational machinery, buses, trucks, industrial processes, and plants.\n\nHere are 5 things to know about fuel-fired heaters\u2026.\n\n1. What are fuel fire heaters most commonly used for?\n\n  \u2022 There are many kinds of uses for fuel fire heaters as they are an extremely versatile type of heater that can adapt to many different needs.\n  \u2022 Fuel-fired heaters can be found in many industrial plants as tested and trusted and efficient ways of heating a facility. Many plants have products and goods that need to remain at a certain temperature to ensure the integrity of the perishable products, not to mention, keeping employees working in a comfortable atmosphere.\n\n2. How do different industrial processes benefit from fuel fire heaters?\n\nThere are many industrial processes that these heaters are used for. Many machines that have gears, pulleys, and cylinders are often kept inside in the winter to ensure they keep working in top shape. In some places, like Canada, it can get pretty hard on these machines to be woken up from a -40 sit overnight.\n\n3. How do engines benefit from fuel fire heaters?\n\n  \u2022 Have you ever seen someone turn the key of a truck and wait for a light to turn on before they turned the key to start the vehicle or large machinery? That is because that vehicle or equipment is diesel operated.\n  \u2022 Many diesel-operated vehicles and operational equipment contain fuel-fired heaters to keep engines preheated, such as farm equipment, and machinery, diesel buses, trucks, and large industrial machines. These types of engines use less fuel and have better omissions.\n\n4. How can fuel-fired furnaces work in your facility?\n\nIf your fuel-fired furnace is gas-based, gas-based furnaces are commonly found in factories, plants, and other large industrial facilities. Something about gas furnaces to keep in mind is that gas furnaces burn either propane or natural gas, so they are generally designed to burn only that specific gas.\n\n5. Can you save money by using a fuel-fired furnace?\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want to save a few bucks? Natural gas furnaces are more efficient than fuel oil furnaces, so it\u2019s possible to save on your energy bills and significantly decrease your overhead after you convert to a fuel-fired furnace.\n\nThere are a few types of fuel-fired heaters to choose from\u2026\n\nAir Heaters use air and not liquid to heat the area while hydronic\/liquid coolant heaters are used for keeping perishables at a certain temp and are commonly used to keep cabs warm. There are two types of heaters that rely on fuel to operate: diesel fuel and gas-fueled heaters. Both diesel fuel and gas-fueled heater energy sources are pulled from the equipment they are installed to.\n\nThings to keep in consideration when choosing a heater\u2026..\n\nWhen you are choosing a fire-fueled heater, be sure to consult an expert to match the best type of heater for your needs and ensure your heater is professionally installed by a reputable fire-based heater supplier.\n\nShare this post",

        "text":"Benefits Of Logging\n\n, , Comments Off on Benefits Of Logging\n\nBenefits of Logging\n\nLogging refers to the business or work of cutting trees for timber. The profession of logging has many benefits to the people who work in the logging industry and also the environment. The following are some of the key advantages of logging.\n\n1. Provides essential materials\nLogging is a very important practice since it is the main source of timber that is used for many human needs such as providing construction materials, fuel for industries and homes as well as clearing land for development. Timber is also used as a raw material in certain industries and thus logging is required in order to acquire this raw material.\n\n2. Reduces risk of forest fires\nAnother benefit of logging is the fact that it helps in reducing the occurrence of forest fires. Since logging involves cutting trees, then it is highly likely that any fire started by a natural cause such as lightning will not spread quickly. This action could possibly save many lives in the process. As a result of logging, it will be easier to undertake various forest management functions like the removal of litter. This is highly beneficial since it decreases the intensity of any future fires through reducing the fuel load.\n\n3. Encourages new plant growth\nThe activity of logging opens up the forest and encourages the growth and development of new plants and trees. In fact, logging only favors succession of plants and trees that are adapted to the ecosystem, usually doing away with non-native species that could possibly take over a certain habitat. Logging also clears old growth and trees giving other plants a good opportunity to mature.\nIf it is not well managed, logging can have detrimental impacts on the environment. It basically removes habitats used by different wild animals like birds that make use of trees for cover and food.\n\nPlease help us improve. Please rate this article:",

Commuters often take for granted\nwhat a valuable resource asphalt is for our roadways, economy and environment. In fact, asphalt is one of the most crucial materials available in our country with more than 93% of highways and roads being paved. Another positive aspect of asphalt is that it is highly recyclable and poses little to no negative effect on our air quality and surroundings. Here are 10 more cool facts you may not know about asphalt:\n\n  1. For every $1 billion of federal spending invested in highway construction nationwide, nearly 28,000 jobs are supported.\n  2. More than 90 percent of parking areas in the U.S. are surfaced with asphalt pavement, the material of choice for most commercial and residential development owners.\n  3. \u00a0Porous asphalt pavements are increasingly used as a low-impact development storm water management tool to handle runoff more cost-effectively than traditional storm water infrastructure.\n  4. Recycling asphalt roads saves American taxpayers more than $300 million each year.\n  5. 80 percent of old asphalt pavement removed each year is re-used.\n  6. Asphalt occurs naturally in both asphalt lakes and in rock asphalt (a mixture of sand, limestone, and asphalt). The first recorded use of asphalt as a road building material was in Babylon around 625 B.C.\n  7. \u00a0A study by the Federal Highway Administration found that smoother pavements can reduce fuel consumption by trucks by up to 4.5 percent.\u00a0\n  8. During ancient Egyptian times, asphalt from the Dead Sea was an important item of trade with the most widespread use in the mummification process.\n  9. Asphalt paving construction can be completed quickly, reducing traffic delays for both commuters and long-haul truckers.\n  10. Research shows that asphalt reduces highway noise by 3 to 5 dB(A) and more.\n\nAsphalt has made a prominent societal, economical and environmental impact on both ancient and modern civilization. It\u2019s cost efficiency, reduction in noise pollution, improved safety and comfort, durability and recyclability make it a key factor in continued socio-economic growth. New technologies and applications make this material not only one of the past, but a vital element of our future.\n\n\nNew Call-to-action\n\nTopics: Asphalt Industry, Asphalt Pavement, Asphalt Solutions",

But what if ever-stressed Marc Smith, 31, construction manager, notices his team is running out of the right size of screws? Sure enough, the workers could take a spontaneous break, but this very moment, Marc is faced with another delay in the site's progress.\n\nThis is exactly where a modern manufacturer could step in with new digital solutions, no longer only offering c-parts on the shelves of his shops, unavailable for online search.\n\nHere are three ideas to innovate stock keeping:\n\n  1. Click and Collect\n\nAs soon as he notices the issue, Marc could browse his favorite tools shop online, choose and order the desired screws, all on the go, already heading to the nearest (partner) store of the manufacturer, where the digital order has been submitted to. By this, the construction site is back to business quickly.\n\n  1. Smart Shelf\n\nThe issue could have been prevented, if the manufacturer or wholesaler of screws (and building materials) had already installed a smart shelf in Marc\u2019s warehouse. Combined with a personal subscription, all sides benefit from lean processes. The smart storage solution ensures that the supplier automatically receives an order from the customer when the stock of screws reaches the minimum quantity. He then delivers the necessary c-parts automatically, taking into account the consumption of the past few weeks. By this, never too much capital is bound, while at the same time the risk of falling short is reduced.\n\n\n  1. Automatic reminder\n\nA third preventive action and a solid foundation for a loyal customer\/supplier relationship could be initiated by the manufacturer via e-mail:\n\n\u201cDear Mr Smith, based on the usual weekly consumption of ASSY plus FBS steel galvanised AW, your usual stock may fall below 1,000 pieces next week. Please find attached a quick order template for your convenience.\u201d\n\nWith intelligent commerce platforms, personalized services can be offered that guarantee customer loyalty and ensure sustainable customer relations. Augmented reality, sensor technology, mobile access, artificial intelligence - or just good ideas \u2013 begin to contribute to this.\n\nIntershop is your partner in B2B, no matter what your idea may be.",

The speed with which a material travels from one area to another, and the ability to precisely control both the \u2018start and stop\u2019 of the flow, relies solely on technology employed in the flow meter used.\n\nThe devices have many business applications. For instance, flow meters are responsible for significantly complex control and measurement of medication or blood, in medical care environments. They are also in control of rerouting and stemming the flow of oil, when there has been a leak or disruption to fossil fuel distribution. You can also find fewer complexes, but nonetheless essential flow meter technology, at your favorite local bar or restaurant.\n\nWe will discuss four common industrial applications for flow meters, how they work, and share how the technology helps improve human, process and environmental safety.\n\n1. Hospital and Emergency Healthcare Uses\n\nFlow meters in healthcare environments, are some of the most compact and technologically advanced designs, which are almost always provided with shock protection mechanisms, to avoid health complications or disruption of pace makers, or other medical devices.\n\nGiven the reduced amount of room around a patient\u2019s bed, flow meters in medical practice are usually quite small. This allows them to be both portable, and enable doctors and the care team from being disrupted by large pieces of equipment around the patient. Medical teams to determine peak respiratory flow rates to monitor respiration for asthma and, emphysema patients, during critical care procedures, also use them.\n\nEmergency and healthcare environments will have flow meters for the following patient care functions:\n\n  \u2022 Administration of oxygen\n  \u2022 Dosage of prescribed medications\n  \u2022 To regulate the flow of transfusions\n  \u2022 Blood pressure or hypertension testing\n  \u2022 Intravenous medication, hydration or nutritional administration of the patient\n\nOne of the most important aspects of flow meters in medical applications is the reduction of oxygen pockets (or bubbles) in the apparatus, while delivering lifesaving fluids. For instance, the introduction of even a single air bubble into the blood stream can cause a condition called an arterial air embolism. The air can travel to the heart, lungs or brain, causing respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or stroke.\n\nFlow meters ensure the precise volume measurement of any medication, fluid or anesthetic gas is maintained without dilution, to help prevent under or over dosage, and some devices are programmed to delivery accurate amounts at timed intervals, for therapeutic care. From surgical to pediatric care, dental and emergency response, flow meters are used to deliver accurately measured and controlled services.\n\n2. Natural Gas and Fossil Fuel Industry\n\nHave you ever wondered what happens in an oil or natural gas leak, and how safety and compliance experts are able to \u2018shut off\u2019 the flow of fuel or other potentially hazardous industrial chemicals? At the simplest level, consider how a flow meter regulates the gasoline dispensed for your car or truck, to prevent spills, and to accurately deliver the correct amount of fuel that was paid for by the customer, without costly wastage for the retailer.\n\nHave you ever noticed the disclaimer sign on the automotive gas pump, which indicates that the dispensation of fuel can be impacted in terms of accuracy, according to the external temperature around the gas pump? That is also another aspect of gas station flow meters, which are more accurate in measuring dense fluid volumes, than gas.\n\nThe price per liter or gallon of your fuel is adjusted because gasoline expands during high temperatures. As the energy content of gasoline is directly related to weight versus volume, the energy value for gasoline does not increase when temperatures are hot, and gasoline expands, at an average rate of 0.069% per degree increase, in Fahrenheit.\n\nOn a larger scale, the pipelines that supply crude oil across the country are highly regulated by flow meters with built in safety sensors. When pressure increases (also impacted by temperature) the volume rate can be adjusted remotely, to reduce pressure on the pipe infrastructure, and help reduce instances of pipeline explosions or leaks. When a leak does occur, the same sensors are able to report a drop-in volume displacement, and alert authorities to address the problem promptly, while diverting crude oil (and natural gas) away from damaged pipe networks.\n\n3. Uses in Food and Beverage Service\n\nLook underneath the counter of your favorite bar or eatery, and you will see numerous food and beverage flow meters in service. Electromagnetic flow meters are also commonly used in breweries.\nIn the production or dispensing of beverages, starch solutions and liquefied CO2 are measured to precise amounts, to ensure the consistency of flavor. With a few exceptions, you may notice that popular brands of beverages have the same taste, no matter where you drink them in the world. The level of accuracy is used in manufacturing beverages, to ensure precise measurements for quality control globally, for large brands like Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and leading internationally distilleries and breweries.\n\n4. Pharmaceutical Production and Manufacturing\n\nConsistency and quality control is not only important in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and prescription medications. In general, there are three manufacturing processes within the pharmaceutical industry, that utilize flow meters:\n\n  \u2022 Chemical synthesis production\n  \u2022 The reduction of raw material handling.\n  \u2022 The extraction of API\u2019s (active pharmaceutical ingredients), or the purification or fermentation of compound medicinal materials.\n\nMost medications sold in the United States, are compounded or processed domestically. However, the raw ingredients are typically purchased in bulk from manufacturing countries like India and China. India is the current leading supplier of API\u2019s to American big pharmaceuticals, with 75 FDA approved manufacturing centers that provide API synthesis services.\n\nWherever a consumer can see an array of modern pipes, including fresh water delivery, sewage or rainwater management, digital water flow meters\u00a0are essential to providing accurate, measured and controlled delivery. New technology and research is working on the combination of predictive analytics with flow meters. Imagine a washing machine that can detect a malfunction, and shut the supply of water, right before there is a problem? A simple case scenario, but one that is not unreasonable in terms of advanced flow meter technology soon.\n\nWrite a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

These smallholders\u00a0usually have limited farming skills. They are rarely aware of modern\u00a0farming techniques and do not know much about how value chains work.\n\nTo ensure sufficient quality and quantity of the\u00a0expected produce, the agribusiness operating as a lead firm is often\u00a0forced to employ large numbers of extension workers to train and\u00a0coach smallholder farmers throughout the year. This causes high\u00a0transaction costs for such contract farming models, impeding their competitiveness.\n\nModern information and communication technology reduce such transaction costs, making contract\u00a0farming more competitive. The technology brings higher profitability for both\u00a0the smallholders and the lead firm and it facilitates the inclusion of\u00a0more farmers into such schemes. While the advantages are obvious\u00a0and information and communication technology is booming in agriculture, best practices for ICT in the\u00a0field of contract farming have yet to be established.\n\n\nFrench edition\n\n\nThe GIZ program Improving the Framework Conditions in the\u00a0Private and Financial Sector (ProEcon) aims to promote sustainable\u00a0economic development in Mozambique. One of its projects supports local economic cycles in rural areas.\n\nWith contract\u00a0farming as a powerful instrument, ProEcon assists with including smallholder farmers in commercial supply chains, thus increasing\u00a0their income opportunities.\n\nThe author, Ralph Els\u00e4\u00dfer, is specializing in introducing and improving modern and locally adapted information\u00a0and communication solutions in the area of agriculture, supply chain management and integrated water\u00a0management.\n\n2018-04-11T13:43:29+00:00 April 11th, 2018|Categories: CF, Updates|",

        "text":"Benefits of Metal Hoses Fabrication Companies\n\nIndustries need hoses in their day to day operations and they therefore have to look for a good manufacturer. The hoses that are required need to be of high quality and since they are made of metal they need to be stainless so that they can be more durable so that they will not interfere with the normal functioning of the hoses. There are different firms that sell hoses but overall there are firms that are the best when you want quality hoses. These are the firms that manufacture the metal hoses and they have so many advantages. The following are the advantages of the hose manufacturing firms.\n\nThe first advantage of the metal hose manufacturing and selling firms is that they are able to manufacture metal hoses based on the client\u2019s specifications. The hoses are used by different companies and people for different reasons and this means that they require metal hoses that meet their specifications. This fabrication companies can fabricate the metal hose you want based on certain features such as size, length, temperature range, material, vibration absorber, chemical resistant and many more features. They also have metal hoses for ideal requirements such as mining, military applications and even chemical metal hoses.\nThe second advantage is that these metal hose fabricating companies have durable and efficient hoses, their metal hoses are durable because they are able to last for a very long time without any complications or getting damaged. This is an advantage for industries and people because they are able to avoid replacing the metal hoses from time to time. This reduces complications in the near future. The reason why the metal hoses are durable is because the fabricating companies have made sure that they use high quality materials in manufacturing the metal hoses. The metal hoses do not disappoint the user.\n\nThe third advantage is that they sell their items online. The sells department have ensured that they have incorporated modern technology in their selling. Clients can order the metal hoses that their want by keying the specifications of the hose they want and ordering it online. This process makes it very easy one, because less time is used in the ordering of the materials and second the process does not require a person to travel to the firm\u2019s stores. These orders are received immediately and the packaging starts as soon as possible. Payments are also done fast in this case and you can order the metal hoses any time you desire.\n\nThe last advantage is that they offer delivery of the metal hoses bought. Since you purchase the metal hoses online, the company will definitely have to deliver the items to you. The delivery is done as soon as they receive your order which assures you of getting the metal hoses you had ordered faster. They have a good shipping department that personally handle the shipment process ensuring that there are no delays or complications in the whole process. The delivery will save you money because you will not have to deal with the movement of the items from the company\u2019s store to your place.\n\nGetting Creative With Advice\n\n: 10 Mistakes that Most People Make\n\nSimilar Posts",

        "text":"Home \/ Crops \/ Corn High Yield Team \/ 4 steps for better corn-on-corn\n\n4 steps for better corn-on-corn\n\nGil Gullickson 01\/03\/2013 @ 12:58pm Crops Technology Editor for Successful Farming magazine\/Agriculture.com\n\nRobert Jones and his family have significant hurdles to face in growing continuous corn near Palmyra, Indiana.\n\nPrior to their farming them, some of the Joneses\u2019 fields were continuously cropped to soybeans since farm foreclosures in the 1930s. They are still dealing with the erosion fallout.\n\n\u201cOn some of those farms, we\u2019re dealing with subsoil, not topsoil,\u201d says Robert.\n\nSoil organic matter levels in their fields are on the low side, ranging from 1.9% and 2.9%. Soils with low soil organic matter levels tend to dry out quicker and don\u2019t contain as many natural nutrients as those on the higher end.\n\nStill, they\u2019ve adapted to these challenges through a sound strategy we\u2019ll outline in our February issue. Until then, here are some other steps they follow in growing corn-on-corn.\n\n1. Early-Season Fungicides\n\nHybrid selection is one of the ways they manage disease. Early-season fungicides applied at the V5 stage (five fully exposed leaf collars) are another method. They can also combine fungicide applications with postemergence liquid herbicide and fertilizer applications. Overall, Jones credits the early-season fungicide application with boosting yields an average 7 bushels per acre.\n\nThey do not apply fungicides at tasseling due to the geography of their fields. \u201cIt is difficult to get an airplane to apply fungicide accurately enough on small fields,\u201d he says.\n\n2. Early-Season Pest Control\n\nThe Joneses key emergence and early-season stands by a seed treatment that fends off nematodes and early-season insects and fungal diseases. Jones says one reason populations of corn nematodes-- native to North America -- have grown is due to corn rootworm-resistant traits. That caused Jones to discontinue using Counter, a soil-applied insecticide that controlled both corn rootworm and nematodes.\n\n\u201cWe found some spots that just didn\u2019t grow (corn),\u201d he says. \u201cOur agronomist advised sending soil samples to an independent lab. We finally narrowed it down to corn nematode. We found the nematodes we had to be Lance, one of the most prolific ones.\u201d\n\nThe nematicide-treated seed nixes nematodes. Capture, an in-furrow insecticide also reinforces insecticide-treated seed in combating grubs and black cutworm.\n\n3. Harvest and Storage Adjustments\n\nThe Joneses used to rotate soybeans with corn. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t break the 60-bushel (per acre) yield barrier for soybeans consistently,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s why they shifted to corn-on-corn. The switch came with a perk.\n\n\u201cContinuous corn is easier to manage logistically,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt was hard to manage two combines and two combine crews. \u201cWe\u2019d always wonder, 'Should we switch to corn today?\u2019\u201d Jones says. \u201cThen the soybean crew would be short of help.\u201d\n\nNo longer. The Joneses downsized from two combines to a larger one. They run a class 9 16-row combine equipped with a Drago head.\n\nCancelPost Comment\n\nNeonicotinoid Insecticide Seed Treatments\u2026 By: 10\/22\/2014 @ 8:43am I always enjoy listening to Mike Gray, University of Illinois Extension entomologist.

        "text":"Safety and Training Myths Debunked\n\nWhen it comes to safety, myths and rumors often cloud what are acceptable practices in the lifting equipment industry. Jeff Stachowiak, national safety training director for Sunbelt Rentals, Fort Mills, S.C., developed the following list of items in order to set the record straight on many common myths.\n\n\nAre there other Safety Myths you\u2019d like debunked? Contact Jeff at or toll free at 866-455-4106 with any further questions.\n\n\nMyth: Training wallet cards are required by OSHA.\n\n\nWallet cards or personal training identification is NOT an OSHA requirement. OSHA will always look to the employer to prove the employer has trained its employees. Wallet cards are a convenient way to determine if someone has attended training without having to ask the employer for written records or proof of training. Many larger general contractors may require wallet card identification for operator training, but that is a jobsite requirement\u2014not an OSHA requirement. Remember though, you can have a wallet full of training cards, but if OSHA determines upon observation that you are doing something wrong, those wallet cards will not do you any good.\n\n\nMyth: Stay 6 feet from the roof\u2019s edge, and you do not need to be fall protected.\n\n\nEven many OSHA people believe this one. Although I\u2019m not sure where this idea came from, I think people confuse the 6-foot vertical fall distance with this myth. OSHA only has seven options for fall protection, and they are guardrails (which may include a parapet wall high enough to satisfy OSHA guardrail height and strength requirements), safety nets, personal fall arrest systems, positioning device systems, warning line systems, controlled access zones, and safety monitoring systems. The last three requires a physical barrier between the worker and the fall hazard. If you are on a roof, you need one of these options to protect you from a fall no matter how far you are from the roof\u2019s edge or fall hazard.\n\n\nMyth: A harness and lanyard are fall protection.\n\nGuardrails are your best fall protection.\n\nTying off or using a harness\/lanyard is \u201chitting the ground protection,\u201d not fall protection. In order for a harness\/lanyard to work, you have to fall. Therefore the harness\/lanyard does not prevent a fall; guardrails prevent falls.\n\n\nMyth: Harness\/lanyards are required on scissor lifts.\n\nPartially true.\n\nWhile OSHA and ANSI A92.6 currently do not require occupants in a scissor lift to wear personal fall protection, some manufacturers of scissor lifts may recommend or require their use (see the scissor lift operating manual). If the manufacturer recommends or requires a harness and lanyard in a scissor lift, then OSHA can enforce its use. If OSHA determines that a harness\/lanyard might have lessened or prevented someone from getting hurt or killed in a scissor lift accident, it also may issue a citation based on the use.\n\n\nMyth: Equipment training (boom and scissor lifts, skid steer loaders, backhoes, excavators, etc.) is not an OSHA requirement.\n\n\nOSHA requires that employees know the hazards that they might be exposed to at work.\n\n\u2022 OSHA Construction Standard \u201c1926.21(b) (2) The employer shall instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.\u201d\n\n\u2022 OSHA Industry Standard \u201c1910.9(b) Training. Standards in this part requiring training on hazards and related matters, such as standards requiring that employees receive training or that the employer train employees, provide training to employees, or institute or implement a training program, impose a separate compliance duty with respect to each employee covered by the requirement. The employer must train each affected employee in the manner required by the standard, and each failure to train an employee may be considered a separate violation.\u201d\n\n\nMyth: Lock Out-Tag Out (LOTO) does not apply to construction equipment.\n\n\nThis one is complicated. While OSHA does not have a LOTO standard in construction (1926), only in the industry (1910) standard, there are references to locking out hydraulic arms\/buckets on construction equipment, and you must follow the manufacturers\u2019 operator and maintenance manuals with regard to all repairs wherever that equipment might be. OSHA can cite based on the General Duty clause, referencing the Operator or Maintenance manual\u2019s instructions.\n\n\nMyth: A 5,000-pound warehouse forklift can pick up 5,000 pounds.\n\nMaybe, but typically not.\n\nAlthough the ID plates states the forklift\u2019s lifting capacity, the stated capacity is often not the same as the ID plate. Both three-section masts and side-shifting take away capacity from the original rating. OSHA and ASME\/ANSI require manufacturers to test and state on the ID plate the maximum capacity at maximum \u00a0or full height. Therefore, the taller the lift height and the more mast sections there are, the less capacity the forklift will lift. The stated capacity on the ID plate is the maximum capacity. PERIOD.\n\n\nMyth: This _______is OSHA-approved or OSHA-certified.\n\n\nOSHA does not approve or certify any product, service, or training. You can attend OSHA Outreach classes that will make you an OSHA Outreach instructor\/trainer. That is as close as OSHA gets to certifying training. Products or training may \u201cmeet\u201d or \u201cexceed\u201d OSHA regulations or requirements, but OSHA does not endorse, test, review, approve, or certify any products. The same goes for ANSI\u2014it does not approve products.\n\n\nMyth: Training employees will make them work safe.\n\n\nTraining is, no doubt, an important part in preventing accidents but only a small part. There are many other elements to a successful safety program that need to happen simultaneously to help reduce accidents. Other important aspects of a successful safety program include leadership supervision to correct unsafe behavior, encouragement of safe behavior, and effective accident and near-miss investigation. Also share results with all employees involved in safety and obtain their input to help develop processes, correct unsafe conditions, and measure your progress.\n\n\nMyth: OSHA recordable rates are the score to measure safety success.\n\n\nOSHA TIR or TTIR can be a measure to use, but it is not the only measure. Lost time rates, lost days, claims management, safety attitudes or culture, audits, observations, and training all play important roles in measuring safety success. Using the OSHA TIR as your only score to measure success or failure is like looking at the final score of a baseball game and saying we won or lost without analyzing any other aspects of the game. You can be \u201clucky\u201d and not have accidents with little or no safety effort.\n\nAbout the Author:\u00a0\njeff stachowiak\n\nJeff Stachowiak\n\nContact Jeff Stachowiak, national safety training director Sunbelt Rentals, at or toll free at 866-455-4106 with any further questions.",

        "text":"Concrete : Features and interesting facts\n\nThe beginnings of such material as concrete mortar, as we know it today, were still around 6000 BC.\u00a0According to various sources and conclusions of scientists, concrete appeared on the banks of the Danube, in the area of \u200b\u200bthe territory of modern Serbia.\u00a0It is there that concrete takes its original development path.\n\nInteresting facts about concrete\n\nMany people underestimate this building material, however, one cannot say that it does not belong to our common history.\u00a0Thanks to this particular material, as well as the long path of its formation and development, today we can use the composition in the construction industry, thanks to which we can significantly save not only money but also time.\n\nWhat is concrete?\n\nThis is a type of building material that is obtained in the process of hardening a concrete mixture.\u00a0The composition of this material includes elements such as water, sand, crushed stone, cement.\u00a0One of the most important indicators of concrete quality is its flexural and compressive strength.\u00a0It is by these indicators that you can determine whether concrete is of high quality or not.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Cement vs Concrete\n\nContemporary concrete\n\nIf you plunge into history, then after the Western Roman Empire fell, all the recipes for this building mixture\u00a0were lost.\u00a0Speaking about more modern types of concrete,\u00a0one cannot fail to mention the recipe, which was discovered in 1844.\u00a0It is he who is the progenitor of our modern material.\n\nThanks to the active development of technologies in the field of construction, today this composition is used very widely.\u00a0For example, not only houses and industrial complexes are erected from it, but also roads, bridges, decorative elements for country houses, and much more.\u00a0All this allows us to significantly save time for the construction of an object, as well as money that may be needed for this.\n\nIf you are thinking of what to build a house from - from a bar or from concrete, then it is worth considering the purpose and option of using this building.\u00a0Construction technology, time, money, method - all this will be different for wood and concreteHowever, do not ignore the fact that the concrete structure will last much longer..\n\nInteresting facts about concrete\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 1\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ancient concrete was different in composition from modern concrete.\u00a0The main difference was that there was no cement in it.\u00a0The role of the binder was replaced by clay, gypsum, or lime.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fact number 2\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The earliest find made of concrete is a hut found on the banks of the Danube, built from a mixture of sand, gravel, water, and cement.\u00a0It was supposedly built in 5600 BC.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 3\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the III-II centuries BC.\u00a0the ancient Romans knew how to make hydro-concrete that solidifies in water.\u00a0It was made from lime and volcanic ash.\u00a0A more outstanding and simple invention before Christ's time, perhaps, was not known.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 4\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the fact that concrete began to be used in ancient Egypt, housing from it was not built for a very long time.\u00a0The first to try out a concrete dwelling was none other than the great inventor Thomas Edison.\u00a0Only after this began the widespread use of this technology in the construction real estate market.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 5\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is a well-known fact that the roads made America.\u00a0But few people know that the famous American highways are mostly covered with concrete!\u00a0Their total length is about 90,000 km.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAlso Read:\u00a0Thumb Rules for Civil Engineers\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 6\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Concrete roads last more than 2 times longer than asphalt roads!\u00a020-30 years versus 8-12 years of paved roads.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 7\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It may sound incredible, but some types of concrete float well in water.\u00a0They are mainly used to create floating docks on the water.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fact number 8\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Concrete is the most demanded building material on Earth.\u00a0About 6 billion cubic meters of concrete are produced annually, which means that for every inhabitant of the planet there is 1 cubic meter of concrete per year.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 9\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Due to its color, concrete reflects 50% more sunlight than asphalt.\u00a0It is surprising, but in cities built up with concrete houses, the air temperature is up to 70% lower than in areas with asphalt pavement.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fact number 10\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A concrete capable of transmitting light was invented!\u00a0While maintaining all their qualities, houses made of such material look lighter and seem to float in the air.\u00a0This concrete is expected to enter the market soon.\n\nConcrete piles\n\nAdvantages of Concrete:\n\n  1. Concrete ingredients are readily available in most locations.\u00a0Indeed, cement, sand, crushed stone, water, and plasticizers are the main materials for the preparation of a concrete mixture, which solidifies, turns into solid stone.\u00a0These are simple and well-known materials that are available in any region.\n  2. The cost of concrete maintenance is practically negligible.\n  3. \u00a0The strength of the concrete is very high.\u00a0The strength of concrete is the most important characteristic that determines the properties and performance of concrete structures and elements of building structures.\u00a0The grade of concrete indicates its compressive strength and is expressed in kg \/ cm2 (kilogram-force per cm2).\u00a0It is designated by the letter M, and the number after the letter indicates the average, approximate value of strength.\u00a0In construction, concretes of the following brands are most often used: M100, M150, M200, M250, M300, M350, M400, M450, M500.\n  4. High level of frost resistance.\n  5. \u00a0Concrete makes a building fire safe due to its non-combustible nature.\u00a0It is one of the fire-resistant materials.\u00a0Due to the relatively low thermal conductivity of concrete, short-term exposure to high temperatures does not have time to cause significant heating of the concrete.\u00a0Aerated concrete can be used for thermal insulation at a temperature of the insulated surface up to +400 C.\n  6. The deterioration of concrete is not noticeable with age.\n  7. Possibility of manufacturing large-sized industrial productsMany materials, due to the peculiarities of their physical structure and properties, do not allow the manufacture of building products of a large size.\n  8. Concrete can be used to manufacture load-bearing, enclosing, and heat-insulating products and structures.\n\nRead:\u00a0What is Cement Mortar?\n\nDisadvantages of Concrete:\n\nLike any material, concrete has several disadvantages.\n\n  \u2022 Concrete is less flexible than other\u00a0materials.\n  \u2022 Concrete may contain soluble salts.\u00a0Soluble salts cause discoloration.\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Jim Kuhn Leadership Award\nDr. Dan Putnam, right, University of California agronomist, received the 2017 Jim Kuhn Leadership Award Nov. 29 from the California Alfalfa & Forage Association during the Western Alfalfa and Forage Symposium. Presenting the award was last year\u2019s recipient Tom Ellis.\n\n10 \u2018soundbites\u2019 from Western Alfalfa & Forage Symposium\n\n\u201cThere will be fewer alfalfa acres in Kings, Tulare, and Fresno counties (in Central California) in 2018,\" predicts hay market analyst Seth Hoyt.\n\nAbout 430 members of the western alfalfa and forage industries gathered Nov. 28- 30 in Reno, Nev. to learn improved ways to grow, bale, test, and sell quality hays.\n\nThe crowd at the 2017 Western Alfalfa & Forage Symposium heard the latest research findings, news, technological developments, and solutions to push their alfalfa and forage farms and related businesses to the next level.\n\nBelow are 10 of the noted \u2018soundbites\u2019 from event speakers, courtesy of Western Farm Press. \u00a0\n\nNo. 1 \u2013 High quality alfalfa is essential. \u201cAlfalfa must be nutritious and palatable. The animal must be willing to eat it or it doesn\u2019t do any good,\u201d said Shannon Mueller, University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE) director at Fresno County.\n\nNo. 2 \u2013 Seth Hoyt, market analyst and author of The Hoyt Report weekly newsletter, offered these noted \u2018bites\u2019:\n\nA \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t predict alfalfa prices (for 2018) due to so many variables.\u201d Hoyt has made the same comment for the last several years at the same symposium due to fast changing market forces.\u00a0\n\nB - \u201cThere will be fewer alfalfa acres in Kings, Tulare, and Fresno counties (in Central California) in 2018. More hay will be brought in from other states,\u201d said Hoyt, suggesting that fewer acres could be tied to increased tree nut plantings.\n\nC \u2013 \u201cAlfalfa hay exports to Japan are up 7 percent to about 33,000 metric tons,\u201d said Hoyt who expects western hay export numbers to be mostly strong\u00a0in 2018.\n\nNo. 3 - On dairy, Tiffany LaMendola of Blimling Associates noted these points \u2013 1- \u201cWe expect more negative (milk) prices in 2018.\u201d 2 \u2013 \u201cDomestic demand for U.S. dairy products remain flat with a 1 percent increase in cheese (sales).\u201d 3 \u2013 \u201cWe are entering a new year with a lot of dairy products with plenty of butter on hand. We have way too much powder.\u201d\n\nNo. 4 \u2013 \u201cThe two (main) purposes of hay testing is to formulate rations and determine economic worth,\u201d said Dan Putnam, UCCE forage specialist.\n\nNo. 5 \u2013 What is the most powerful mechanism growers can use to influence forage quality? It\u2019s the cutting schedule, said 85 percent of the 200 folks who attended a question and answer session using clicker technology to select from multiple choice answers, during the symposium\u2019s Alfalfa Hay Quality Workshops.\n\nNo. 6 \u2013 What type of hay rake is more likely to have leaf shatter? A mechanical rake (hydraulic or PTO), said 53 percent of the workshop attendees via clickers during the Hay Quality Workshop.\n\nNo. 7 \u2013 \u201cThe \u20185 Rs\u2019 of feeding cows include the right feed, right cows, right time, right amounts, and right physical form,\u201d said Rick Norell of the University of Idaho. He added, \u201cForages set the pace for the entire ration.\u201d\n\nNo. 8 \u2013 \u201cWhen taking a bale sample go into the middle of the bale. Don\u2019t use the plunger at an angle. Go into the center of the bale \u2013 straight into the bale\u201d \u2013 Jody Gale, Utah State University.\n\nNo. 9 \u2013 On the U.S. farm bill, \u201cThere is no evidence that commodity subsidies have helped industries prosper. Evidence exists that they (subsidies) have stifled innovation in products and markets,\u201d said Dan Sumner of the University of California Agricultural Issues Center.\n\nNo. 10 \u2013 Tim DelCurto of Montana State University, said: \u201cThe U.S. is the world\u2019s largest beef producer with nearly 27 billion pounds (produced) in 2017.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s symposium featured a trade show with 76 exhibitors.\n\n\nHide comments\n\n\n  \u2022 Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p>\n\nPlain text\n\n  \u2022 No HTML tags allowed.\n  \u2022 Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.\n  \u2022 Lines and paragraphs break automatically.",
