He went on to play 26 games for Lausanne-Sport.\n\nFC Basel[edit]\n\nIn summer 2007, he left Lausanne for FC Basel on a free transfer, signing a three-year deal. He made his debut for Basel in the 5\u20131 away defeat on 5 August 2007 against BSC Young Boys.[3] However, he played just a handful of games during his first season at Basel and therefore for the 2008\u201309 season he was loaned out to Sevilla FC's B Team, Sevilla Atl\u00e9tico, where he made 22 appearances, scoring one goal.\n\nWhen he returned to Basel Manager Christian Gross had been sacked and Thorsten Fink was in charge. Cabral had become a much improved player following his season in Spain and thus during the 2009\u201310 season he broke into the first team squad. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20132 home win over AC Bellinzona on 6 December 2009.[4] At the end of that season Cabral was part of the Double winning squad and he had played 21 league games during the campaign.\n\nHis best goal was in the 2010\/2011 UEFA Champions League against A.S. Roma when he dribbled around the defence and then lobbed the ball over Bogdan Lobon\u0163 to the final score of 3:1. At the end of the Basel's 2010\u201311 season Cabral won his third Championship Medal and the following season saw him win his third Double (the fourth League Championship title[5] and the third Swiss Cup Medal).[6]\n\nAfter his team mate Benjamin Huggel retired from professional football in May 2012, Cabral took his place in central midfield and advanced to becoming team leader. At the end of the Swiss Super League season 2012\u201313 Cabral won the Championship title[7] and was Swiss Cup runner up with Basel.[8] In the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League Basel advanced as far as the semi-finals, there being matched against the reigning UEFA Champions League holders Chelsea, but they were knocked out, losing both home and away tie, beaten 2\u20135 on aggregate.[9]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2013, Sunderland announced the signing of Cabral on a free transfer.[10] He scored his first goal for the club against Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final of the 2013 Premier League Asia Trophy. Sunderland would eventually win that game 3\u20131. He made his competitive debut for the club on the opening day of the season in a 1\u20130 home defeat against Fulham on 17 August 2013.[11] However, he failed to make another league appearance all season, even after Paolo di Canio was sacked as manager and replaced with Gus Poyet.\n\nOn 9 January 2014, having played no further part for the Black Cats, he was loaned to Genoa until the end of the season.[12]\n\nOn 2 February 2015, Sunderland confirmed that Cabral had left the club by mutual consent.[13]\n\nFC Z\u00fcrich[edit]\n\nOn 30 May 2015 he signed a four-year deal with FC Z\u00fcrich.[14] On 1 December 2016 the contract was terminated by mutual consent.[15] Cabral made only 15 league appearances for FC Z\u00fcrich.\n\nInternational career[edit]\n\nCabral represented Switzerland at Under-18, Under-19, Under-20 and Under-21 levels.\n\nIn November 2012, Cabral switched his sporting nationality to his birth country of Cape Verde, being called up for the friendly match between the Cape Verde national senior team against Ghana.[16] In that match, which Cape Verde lost 0\u20131, he was on the bench but did not play.[17]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nCabral is a cousin of Manuel Fernandes a midfielder for FC Lokomotiv Moscow and Gelson Fernandes, a midfielder for Stade Rennais of the Ligue 1 and the Swiss national team.[18]\n\nIn 2016, Cabral was found not guilty at Hull Crown Court after a woman had accused him of rape from his time at Sunderland. The woman had consensual sex with several footballers and the judge called her claim a \"weak case\". Cabral stated \"I was really angry for my family, for my friends, for this because everybody think 'You rape girls', 'You are a rapist'. Now the real story goes out. I am not guilty.\"[19]\n\n\nFC Z\u00fcrich\n\n\n  1. ^ \"Barclays Premier League Squad Numbers 2013\/14\". Premier League. 16 August 2013.

        "text":"Sports entertainment\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nSports entertainment is a type of spectacle which presents an ostensibly competitive event using a high level of theatrical flourish and extravagant presentation, with the purpose of entertaining an audience. Unlike typical athletics and games, which are conducted for competition, sportsmanship, exercise or personal recreation, the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience's benefit, thus they are never practiced privately. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an open secret, it is not considered to be match fixing.\n\n\nThe World Wrestling Federation coined the term \"sports entertainment\" during the 1980s as a description for professional wrestling, although precursors date back to February 1935, when Toronto Star sports editor Lou Marsh described professional wrestling as \"sportive entertainment\". In 1989 WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as \"sports entertainment\" and thus not subject to regulation like a directly competitive sport.\n\nSome sports entertainment events represent variants of actual sports, such as exhibition basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters association, or American football with the Legends Football League. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional wrestling), and more recently many of the various mascot races held at numerous Major League Baseball games in-between innings.[1]\n\nSome forms of sports entertainment involve taking competitive games usually considered minor, such as dodgeball, poker, or rock-paper-scissors, and televising them with trumped-up theatrics, involving (for example) celebrity competitors or elaborate audiovisual packages.\n\n\nSports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment,[2] and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning: the film Idiocracy portrays a future where sports entertainment permeates the global culture: the president is an active champion professional wrestler and capital punishment consists of a combination demolition derby, monster truck event and gladiator duel, and is a highly popular television broadcast. Fiction with a dystopian future setting often portrays deadly futuristic games as popular sports entertainment, including the novel The Hunger Games, the movie The Running Man, video games such as Smash TV and the Twisted Metal series, and the role-playing game Shadowrun, which features Urban Brawl and Combat Biking.\n\nMany notable names in the United States openly admit enjoying certain forms of sports entertainment while many others have taken part in it or made paid contributions. Professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal has a reputation as a long time pro wrestling fan and attends WWE events several times per year, and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. expressed interest in fulfilling a WWE career after he retires from professional boxing. Former American football player Brian Urlacher, who admits to being a pro wrestling fan, made an attempt to leave football to wrestle for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling full-time until his team at the time, the Chicago Bears, forced him to stop.\n\nThe widespread popularity in the United States for the main form of sports entertainment, professional wrestling, has caused politicians to use it to reach voters, particularly young males. President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain recorded video messages for broadcast for the WWE to encourage the audience of WWE Raw to vote, and George W. Bush did a prerecorded video for the WWE's annual Tribute to the Troops show.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n  1. ^ \"Out at the plate: Pirates dump outspoken pierogi - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\". 2012-07-03.

        "text":"2018 San Francisco Giants\n\nFrom BR Bullpen\n\nSanFranciscoGiants 100.png\n\n2018 San Francisco Giants \/ Franchise: San Francisco Giants \/ BR Team Page[edit]\n\nRecord: 73-89, Finished 4th in NL Western Division (2018 NL)\n\nManaged by Bruce Bochy\n\nCoaches: Jose Alguacil, Chad Chop, Matt Herges, Hensley Meulens, Alonzo Powell, Rick Schu, Ron Wotus and Curt Young\n\nBallpark: AT&T Park\n\nSeason Highlights[edit]\n\nThe 2018 San Francisco Giants were coming off having the worst record in the National League in 2017. While most teams would have taken this as a cue to start tearing up the team in order to rebuild, most observers seemed to agree that the team was not really that bad, but instead was a victim of everything that could possibly have gone wrong doing so, saddling them with an awful record. So, instead of seeing what package of prospects they could extract by trading away their star players, the Giants decided to double down and add a few veterans to plug obvious holes in order to extend their cycle of competitiveness by one or two more years. After all this was a team that had made the postseason as recently as 2016, and had won three World Series title since the start of the decade.\n\nThe Giants made two big deals during the winter, the first one to acquire 3B Evan Longoria from the Tampa Bay Rays and the second to snag OF Andrew McCutchen from the Pittsburgh Pirates. In both cases, the trades had only cost them some young players who were not expected to contribute much in 2018 - although in the longer term, their absence could prove costly. Both Longoria and McCutchen had been among the top players in the league only a few years ago and while still productive in 2017, were on the wrong side of 30, making them liable to experience a steep decline at any moment. The Giants were betting that this would not come for at least a couple of seasons. Other additions included P Tony Watson and OF Austin Jackson, the latter essentially taking the spot of Denard Span, who had gone to the Rays in the Longoria deal. They joined a solid core that included C Buster Posey, 1B Brandon Belt, 2B Joe Panik, SS Brandon Crawford and OF Hunter Pence, all of them former contributors to World Series titles. On the mound, the top three of Madison Bumgarner, Jeff Samardzija and Johnny Cueto was as good on paper as any other team's - if they remained healthy. Sam with the bullpen tandem of Mark Melancon and Sam Dyson: potentially devastating, but both coming off recent stretches of awfulness. Everyone was expecting a bounce-back from the Giants; the question was whether it would be big enough to take them back into postseason contention.\n\nFor all the efforts put towards improving the offense in the off-season, the Giants started the year in a huge batting slump, scoring just two runs over their first four games. They still managed to exit that opening series with a .500 record, as they won 1-0 against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Opening Day, March 29th, thanks to a solo homer by Panik off Clayton Kershaw. They won again by the same score the next day, again thanks to a solo homer by Panik as Cueto gave up just one hit in seven innings. But they lost the final two games of the series by a combined score of 14-0. They were the first team since the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who lost their first 21 games, to score so few runs in their first four games.\n\nAwards and Honors[edit]\n\nFurther Reading[edit]\n\n  \u2022 Associated Press: \"Madison Bumgarner, Giants ready to rebound from last place\", USA Today Sports, March 22, 2018.

Cord blood, just like bone marrow, contains an abundant amount of stem cells which can be used to treat many types of diseases.\n\nCord blood banking is the storage and preservation of cord blood at a facility for future use. There are two types of cord blood facilities: private and public cord blood banks. Private banks are facilities which store and preserve your baby's cord blood for a fee, usually costing between $1500-$2400 initially and between $100-$150 annually for storage. Public banks, on the other hand, are facilities which you can donate your baby's cord blood free of charge.\n\nThe donated cord blood is then available for use by anyone in need of a stem cell transplant. If choosing to store or donate your baby's cord blood, notify the cord blood bank of your choice (private or public) as soon as possible, ideally before the 34th week of your pregnancy.\n\nThe cord blood collection procedure is both safe and painless for you and your baby. The blood is collected immediately after the birth of your baby and before the delivery of the placenta. Once your baby is delivered, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut and the blood is collected from the umbilical vein. The procedure only takes a few minutes. The cord blood must be collected within 15 minutes after your baby is born. The blood can be collected using either a syringe to remove the blood (syringe method) from the vein or by allowing the blood to drain by gravity into a collection bag (bag method).\n\nOnce the blood is collected, a medical courier takes the specimen to your desired facility\u2019s laboratory to process, test and freeze (cryopreserve) the blood. Your baby's cord blood will be analyzed to ensure a large enough sample of stem cells have been obtained and tested for the presence of any infectious disease. Testing will also include HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigens) typing which is used to find a donor and recipient match when the cord blood is needed. When the cord blood is needed, the facility thaws and prepares the cord blood for transplantation.\n\nCord blood was once thought of as medical waste, but with the advances in technology, it can now be used to save lives.

        "text":"HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer\n\nPhoto of a woman being vaccinated (PantherMedia \/ Adam Gregor) Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections play a critical role in the development of cervical cancer. There is a vaccine against these sexually transmitted viruses. It targets the most common of the cancer-causing viruses, but does not provide complete protection against cervical cancer.\n\nCervical cancer is nearly always caused by infections with specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infections only occur in humans, affecting skin and mucous membrane cells. They can be spread through direct contact with infected skin or mucous membranes. HPV infections usually go unnoticed, don't cause any symptoms, and clear up on their own. In rare cases, though, they gradually lead to the development of cervical cancer over many years or decades.\n\nThere are currently more than 200 known strains of HPV. Some cause warts on the skin (also called papillomas). About 40 different types of HPV can infect skin and mucous membranes in the genital area. These viruses are transmitted sexually, but they are spread through contact with skin and membranes, and not through body fluids.\n\nBecause they are very common, it is estimated that as many as 90% of all sexually active women and girls are infected.\n\nAs well as having the vaccine, regularly going for screening can help prevent cervical cancer. Abnormal cells (dysplasia) can usually be discovered in this way and removed if necessary.\n\nWhat do HPV vaccines protect against?\n\nHPV vaccines offer protection against the types of HPV that are most likely to cause cervical cancer. Infections with these viruses can cause cells to change and possibly develop into cancer. One of the available vaccines can prevent genital warts (condylomas) too. Although these warts are often unpleasant, they aren't dangerous.\n\nthe\u00a0vaccines can reduce the number of women with abnormal cervical cells that have changed so much that they are likely to develop into cancer (also known as high-grade dysplasia, or CIN 3). This suggests that the vaccines also provide protection against cervical cancer in the long term.\n\nSince August 2017, the only vaccines available in Germany are Cervarix and Gardasil 9. Cervarix provides protection against HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for about 60 to 70% of all cases of cervical cancer. It doesn't offer any protection against genital warts. Gardasil 9 provides protection against a total of 9 HPV types which are responsible for about 75 to 90% of all cases of cervical cancer. It also offers protection against genital warts.\n\nHPV vaccines don't have any effect on pre-existing HPV infections or genital warts.\n\nWho is the vaccine intended for?\n\nIn Germany, HPV vaccines are offered to girls between the ages of 9 and 14. The costs are covered by statutory health insurers. Girls over 14 who haven't had the vaccine should be vaccinated by the age of 17 at the latest. Some statutory health insurers cover the costs for women above this age too. The question of whether boys should also be offered the vaccine is still being considered. In order to prevent young women from becoming infected with HPV, it is recommended that they be vaccinated before they become sexually active, if possible.\n\nWhat does the vaccination involve?\n\nThe vaccine is injected into the muscles of the upper arm. It doesn't contain viruses that are able to reproduce inside the body. Instead, it contains proteins that are like the outer coat of HPV viruses. Although the vaccine can't cause an infection, it still triggers a response from the body's immune system. Protective antibodies are made.\n\nHPV vaccines usually involve\u00a0two injections that are given five months apart. If the second injection is given before the five months are up, a third injection has to be given a few months later. Three injections are also needed if the girl is older than 14 when she has the first injection.\n\nHow well do HPV vaccines work?\n\nResearch has shown that HPV vaccines are very good at preventing HPV infections caused by the viruses that they target. They reduce the likelihood of cervical cells changing and becoming abnormal, and also lower the risk of cervical cancer.\n\nIf the protection lasts a long time, the following could be expected:\n\n  \u2022 Without an HPV vaccine: About 30 out of 1,000 women would develop cervical cancer at some point in their lives \u2013 if they don't go for cervical screening.\n  \u2022 With an HPV vaccine: About 10 out of 1,000 women would develop cervical cancer at some point in their lives \u2013 if they don't go for cervical screening.\n\nIn other words, HPV vaccines could prevent cervical cancer in about 20 out of 1,000 women.\n\nThey would also prevent the need for surgery to remove pre-cancerous abnormal tissue. This is because women with high-grade dysplasia (abnormal cervical tissue with cells that have changed a lot) have such a high risk of cervical cancer that they are advised to have the abnormal tissue removed.\n\nOne of the vaccines, Gardasil 9, also greatly reduces the risk of genital warts.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccine will depend on whether a girl already has an HPV infection when she is vaccinated. It is less effective in girls who have already been sexually active.\n\nHow long does the protective effect last?\n\nIt is currently not clear whether the vaccine offers long-term protection or whether it will have to be given again (booster shot) at some point. The studies in this area have lasted six years at the most. The vaccine continued to offer protection during that time. This suggests that the vaccine is effective in the long term too. But because cervical cancer usually develops over several years or several decades, more time is needed to be sure.\n\nWhat are the side effects of the vaccine?\n\nHPV vaccines weren't found to cause any serious side effects in the studies. They may lead to various temporary skin reactions where the shot was given, including pain (in 90 out of 100 vaccinations), skin redness (in 30 out of 100 vaccinations), and swelling (in 40 out of 100 vaccinations). Problems such as indigestion, headaches, tiredness or muscle pain may also occur, but are less common.\n\nSome girls may faint after having an injection. Because of this, it is important to stay at the doctor's for about 15 minutes afterwards.\n\nThe vaccination shouldn't be given to girls who have a fever. If the first vaccination causes an allergic reaction, a second dose shouldn't be given.\n\nAuthorities worldwide have been monitoring reports of possible side effects of HPV vaccines since their use was approved. Due to the sheer number of girls who are vaccinated, the coincidental occurrence of new illnesses in some girls following HPV vaccination is to be expected. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), there is no indication that the illnesses that developed after receiving the HPV vaccine were actually caused by the vaccine.",

Also, metal lyrics about any of these themes are not necessarily Mad Lib Metal Lyrics - this trope is about ''generic'' and ''meaningless'' metal lyrics.\n\nThe popularity of different themes varies across metal subgenres: the \"traditional\" metal of the [[TheSeventies late seventies]] and [[TheEighties early eighties]] mostly uses HeavyMeta. ThrashMetal loves modern warfare [[note]]no, not [[VideoGame\/ModernWarfare the game trilogy]][[\/note]], as well as Satanism (but not as much as BlackMetal) and {{Gorn}} (but not as much as DeathMetal). Ancient warfare and HeavyMithril mostly show up in PowerMetal and FolkMetal.\n\nThis trope is about lyrics, but the same pattern often shows up in band, album and song names.\n\n'''[[TropesAreTools This is not necessarily a bad thing.]]''' Many {{Metal Head}}s will freely admit that their favourite bands' lyrics aren't very original or thought-provoking, but still enjoy the music a lot; as stated before, many just don't think lyrics are very important.\n\nOf course, while the fans generally don't pay much attention to Mad Lib Metal Lyrics, MoralGuardians often do - and then have a heart attack.\n\nCompare WordSaladLyrics, which mean even less, but pretend to mean more.\n\nThis trope's examples are far too numerous to list; a few examples for explanatory purposes will do.\n\n\n* Too many songs by Music\/{{Venom}} to list.\n* A lot of Music\/{{Slayer}} songs, including \"The Antichrist\".\n* BlackMetal\n\n[[AC:Religious Imagery]]\n* \"Creeping Death\" by Music\/{{Metallica}}\n* \"Black Sabbath\" and \"After Forever\" by Music\/BlackSabbath\n\n* \"Ripping Corpse\" by Kreator.\n* \"Necrophobic\" by Music\/{{Slayer}}.\n* Anything by CannibalCorpse.\n* A lot of early Music\/{{Dismember}}, particularly \"Skin Her Alive\".\n\n* Music\/{{Metallica}} usually averts Mad Lib Metal Lyrics, but \"Metal Militia\" is a fine example of this trope.\n* A lot of Saxon songs, most notably \"Heavy Metal Thunder\".\n* \"Black Metal\" (the [[BlackMetal genre's]] TropeNamer) by Music\/{{Venom}}.\n* Music\/NanowarOfSteel sometimes parodied this with weakly linked, but [[LargeHam strongly screamed]] lines, using either Metal or HeavyMithril themes -- up to a ListSong of metals and alloys.\n* Metallica's ''No Life 'til Leather'', presumably a snowclone of Motorhead's ''No Sleep 'til Hammersmith''.\n* Most of the songs from {{Sabaton}}'s [[EarlyInstallmentWeirdness first album]].\n\n* \"Criminally Insane\" and \"Dead Skin Mask\" by Music\/{{Slayer}}.\n* \"Schizoid\" by Music\/{{Venom}}.\n* \"Sweating Bullets\" by Music\/{{Megadeth}}.\n* Music\/{{Metallica}} has many, be a SanitySlippageSong (\"Harvester of Sorrow\") or songs that also fit the Angst field above (most of ''Death Magnetic'').\n\n[[AC:Modern warfare]]\n* \"Fire In The Sky\" by Saxon.\n* \"Chemical Warfare\" by Music\/{{Slayer}}.\n* \"Disposable Heroes\" and \"No Remorse\" by Music\/{{Metallica}}\n* Most of {{Sabaton}}'s catalog.\n\n[[AC:Ancient warfare]]\n* Most songs by Music\/DragonForce; it would be shorter to list the songs that aren't.\n* \"Blood Is The Price Of Glory\" and \"Victory Song\" by Music\/{{Ensiferum}}.\n* Almost all of Music\/AmonAmarth's songs are about Vikings.

Some individuals seem to be very sensitive to cold which results in poor blood circulation in the extremities. This is not a serious condition and resolves rapidly with aid of symptomatic measures.\n\nChilblains: Incidence, age and sex\n\nChilblains can affect an individual of any age group. However it is more frequently seen in older adults. The incidence of chilblains is seen mainly in cold and humid weather conditions.\n\nSigns and symptoms of chilblains: Diagnosis\n\nThe clinical features of chilblains generally occurs a few hours after exposure to cold temperatures and affect chiefly the skin of fingers, toes, face and earlobes. The inflammation of blood vessels of the skin may present with redness and swelling of the affected areas. Individuals may also complain of intense itching over skin lesion. Occasionally, an individual may only present with redness of the nose. The inflammation of the blood vessels may cause progressive swelling of the vessel lining wall which in turn results in reduced circulation of blood. This may bring about numbness and bluish discolouration of the affected skin signifying impaired blood flow.\n\nCauses and prevention of chilblains\n\nChilblains occur due to increased sensitivity of some individuals towards cold which results in sluggish circulation of blood, especially affecting the extremities. Various factors like anaemia, nutritional deficiencies or hormonal imbalance may result in this condition. Positive family history has also been known to play a role in causation of chilblains. Chilblains are seen mainly in places where weather is cold and humid. Physical exercise and wearing appropriately warm clothing in cold temperatures may help in preventing this condition.\n\nChilblains: Complications\n\nGenerally this condition is mild and do not result in any severe health concerns. However, the skin lesions may get secondarily infected by bacteria in extremely rare instances. Some individuals have also experienced ulceration of skin lesions, typically called \u2018acral ulcers\u2019. But in maximum individuals, chilblains resolve within a few hours without any residual health problem.\n\nChilblains: Treatment\n\nChilblain is a mild condition which can be easily prevented or can even be managed effectively later. It is important to provide warmth to the affected area if it has become red and swollen. Rub the area vigorously to increase blood circulation. Application of calamine lotions may also help in soothing the itchy skin. Alternatively steroid creams may be prescribed to reduce itching and soreness of skin. It is advisable not to scratch the skin lesion in order to prevent it from being secondarily infected.\n\nMedication namely nifedepine may be considered in some individuals in whom recurrences of chilblains is often seen. This drug is responsible for widening the affected blood vessels and thereby minimising the impairment of blood flow. Antibiotic medications need to be taken if the skin lesion has become infected.",
