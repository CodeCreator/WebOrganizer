In 1671 Quesnel had published a book entitled \"Abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de la morale de l'Evangile\". It contained the Four Gospels in French, with short notes explanatory of the text, at the same time serving as aids for meditation. The work was approved by Bishop Vialart of Ch\u00e2lons. An enlarged edition, containing an annotated French text of the New Testament, appeared in three small volumes in 1678, and a later edition in four volumes appeared under the title \"Le nouveau testament en francais avec dees reflexions morales sur chaque verse, pour en rendre la lecture plus utile et la m\u00e9ditation plus ais\u00e9e\" (Paris, 1693-94). This last edition was highly recommended by Noailes, who had succeeded Vialart as Bishop of Ch\u00e2lons. While the first edition of the work contained only a few Jansenistic errors, its Jansenistic tendency became more apparent in the second edition, and in its complete form, as it appeared in 1693, it was pervaded with practically all the errors of Jansenism. Several bishops forbade its reading in their dioceses, and Clement XI condemned it in his Brief, \"Universi Dominici Gregis\", dated 13 July, 1708. The papal Brief was, however, not accepted in France because its wording and its manner of publication were not in harmony with the \"Gallican Liberties\". Noailles, who had become Archbishop of Paris and cardinal, was too proud to withdraw the approbation which he had inadvertently given to the book while Bishop of Ch\u00e2lons, and Jansenism again raised its head. To put an end to this situation several bishops, and especially Louis XIV, asked the pope to issue a Bull in place of the Brief which the French Government did not accept. The Bull was to avoid every expression contrary to the \"Gallican Liberties\" and to be submitted to the French Government before publication. To avoid further scandal, the pope yielded to these humiliating conditions, and in Feb., 1712, appointed a special congregation of cardinals and theologians to cull from the work of Quesnel such propositions as were deserving of ecclesiastical censure . The most influential member of this congregation was Cardinal Fabroni.\n\nIt took the congregation eighteen months to perform its task, the result of which was the publication of the famous Bull \"Unigenitus Dei Filius\" at Rome, 8 Sept., 1713. The Bull begins with the warning of Christ against false prophets, especially such as \"secretly spread evil doctrines under the guise of piety and introduce ruinous sects under the image of sanctity \"; then it proceeds to the condemnation of 101 propositions which are taken verbatim from the last edition of Quesnel's work. The propositions are condemned respectively as \"False, captious, ill-sounding, offensive to pious ears, scandalous, pernicious, rash, injurious to the Church and its practices, contumelious to Church and State , seditious, impious, blasphemous, suspected and savouring of heresy, favouring heretics, heresy, and schism, erroneous, bordering on heresy, often condemned, heretical, and reviving various heresies, especially those contained in the famous propositions of Jansenius \". The first forty-three propositions repeat the errors of Baius and Jansenius on grace and predestination, such as: grace works with omnipotence and is irrestible; without grace man can only commit sin ; Christ died for the elect only. The succeeding twenty-eight propositions (44-71) concern faith, hope, and charity: every love that is not supernatural is evil ; without supernatural love there can be no hope in God, no obedience to His law, no good work, no prayer, no merit, no religion; the prayer of the sinner and his other good acts performed out of fear of punishment are only new sins. The last thirty propositions (72-101) deal with the Church, its discipline, and the sacraments : the Church comprises only the just and the elect ; the reading of the Bible is binding on all; sacramental absolution should be postponed till after satisfaction; the chief pastors can exercise the Church's power of excommunication only with the consent, at least presumed, of the whole body of the Church ; unjust excommunication does not exclude the excommunicated from union with the Church. Besides condemning these 101 propositions, the Bull states that it finds fault with many other statements in the book of Quesnel, without, however, specifying them, and, in particular, with the translation of the New Testament, which, as the Bull reads, has been censurably altered ( damnabiliter vitiatum ) and is in many ways similar to the previously condemned French version of Mons.\n\nLouis XIV received the Bull at Fontainebleau on 24 Sept., 1713, and sent a copy to Cardinal Noalles, who, probably before receiving it, had revoked, on 28 Sept., his approbation of the \"Moral Reflections\" given in 1695. The king also ordered the assembly of the French clergy to convene at Paris on 16 Oct., and designated the acceptation of the Bull as the purpose of the meeting. At the first session, on 16 Oct., Noailles appointed a committee presided over by Cardinal Rohan of Strasburg to decide upon the most suitable manner of accepting the Bull. Noalles, who took part in a few sessions of the committee, attempted to prevent an unconditional acceptation of the Bull by the committee, and when his efforts proved fruitless he would have withdrawn from the assembly if the king had not ordered him to remain. The report of the committee was for an unqualified acceptance of the Bull, and at the session of the assembly on 22 Jan., 1714, the report was accepted by a vote of forty against nine. By order of the king, the bull was registered by the Parliament on 15 Feb. and by the Sorbonne on 5 March. A pastoral instruction of Noailles, forbidding his priests under pain of suspension to accept the Bull without his authorization, was condemned by Rome. Of the bishops not present at the assembly, seven joined the opposition, while the remaining seventy-two accepted the Bull unconditionally. The opposition, with the exception of Bishop de la Brou of Mirepoix, also condemned the book of Quesnel. As a pretext of their non-acceptance of the Bull, they gave out that it was obscure. Ostensibly they postponed their acceptance only until the pope would explain its obscurity by special declarations. It is manifest that the pope could not yield to these demands without imperilling the authority of the Apostolic See.\n\nIt was the intention of Clement XI to summon Noailles before the Curia and, if needs be, despoil him of the purple. But the king and his councillors, seeing in this mode of procedure a trespass upon the \"Gallican Liberties\", proposed the convocation of a national council which should judge and pass sentence upon Noailles and his faction. The pope did not relish the idea of convoking a national council which might unnecessarily protract the quarrel and endanger the papal authority. He, however, drew up two Briefs, the one demanding the unconditional acceptance of the Bull by Noailles within fifteen days, on pain of losing the purple and incurring canonical punishment, the other paternally pointing out the gravity of the cardinal's offence and exhorting him to go hand in hand with the Apostolic See in opposing the enemies of the Church. Both Briefs were put in the hand of the king, with the request to deliver the less severe in case there was well-founded hope of the cardinal's speedy submission, but the more severe if he continued in his obstinacy. On the one hand, Noailles gave no hope of submission, while, on the other, the more severe of the Briefs was rejected by the king as subversive of the \"Gallican Liberties\". Louis XIV, therefore, again pressed the convocation of a national council but died (1 Sept., 1715) before it could be convened. He was succeeded as regent by Duke Philip of Orl\u00e9ans, who favoured the opponents of the Bull. The Sorbonne passed a resolution, 4 Jan., 1716, annulling its previous registration of the Bull, and twenty-two Sorbonnists who protested were removed from the faculty on 5 Feb. The Universities of Nantes and Reims now also rejected the Bull, the former on 2 Jan., the latter on 26 June. In consequence Clement XI withdrew from the Sorbonne all the papal privileges which it possessed and deprived it of the power of conferring academic degrees on 18 Nov. He had sent two Briefs to France on 1 May. One, addressed to the regent, severely reproved him for favouring the opponents of the Bull ; the other, addressed to the opposition, threatened to deprive Noailles of the purple, and to proceed canonically against all that would not accept the Bull within two months. These Briefs were not accepted by the regent because their text had not been previously submitted to his ministers. But he sent to Rome, Chevalier, the Jansenist Vicar-General of Meaux whom the pope did not, however, admit to his presence, when it became known that his sole purpose was to wrest the admission from Clement XI that the Bull was obscure and required an explanation. In a consistory held on 27 June, 1716, the pope delivered a passionate allocution, lasting three hours, in which he informed the cardinals of the treatment which the Bull had received in France, and expressed his purpose of divesting Noailles of the cardinalate. The following November he sent two new Briefs to France, one to the regent, whose co-operation he asked in suppressing the opposition to the Bull ; the other to the acceptants, whom he warned against the intrigues of the recalcitrants, and requested to exhort their erring brethren to give up their resistance.\n\nOn 1 March, 1717, four bishops (Soanen of Senez, Colbert of Montpellier , Delangle of Boulogne, and de La Broue of Mirepoix) drew up an appeal from the Bull to a general council, thus founding the party hereafter known as the \"appellants\". They were joined by the faculties of the ... (truncated)",

A supporting character in the The Fast and the Furious series, Bilkins was involved in the undercover operation to expose a series of thefts in Los Angeles connected to illegal street racer Dominic Toretto and later, the capture and arrest of Miami drug lord, Carter Verone.\n\n\nThe Fast and the Furious\n\nBilkins was assigned to oversee the LAPD-FBI task force in charge of apprehending Dominic Toretto and his crew, local street racers they suspected were behind multiple semi-truck hijackings in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAgent Bilkins supervised Brian O'Conner's activity during his undercover operation regarding Dominic Toretto. Despite Sergeant Tanner's confidence in Brian's ability to maintain his cover and focus on his objective, Bilkins was up front about expressing his doubts about Brian's ability to complete the operation.\n\nBrian's repeated stalls during the operation frustrated Bilkins, who was ready to take Dominic down. Despite the reveal of Dominic's violent past, Brian failed to produce the evidence Bilkins and Tanner needed. Though Brian manages to arrange an arrest for Johnny Tran, Tran is found not guilty of any crimes.\n\n2 Fast 2 Furious\n\nAgent Bilkins reappears once more, now overseeing a U.S Customs-FBI operation attempting to take down Argentine drug lord Carter Verone. Using an undercover Customs agent, Monica Fuentes, Bilkins is able to locate Brian in Miami, who is now participating in illegal street races for a living. Following Brian's arrest, Bilkins and Markham try to convince Brian to help them expose and take down Verone. Bilkins used the multiple felonies Brian committed in Los Angeles to bring him onto the case, but with the request that he got to choose the partner who'll go undercover with him.\n\nBilkins agreed to Brian's terms and accompanied him to Barstow, California to recruit Roman Pearce, his childhood friend. Bilkins willingly sat and watched Brian and Roman's fight until Roman was convinced that helping them would be worth his time. When Roman asked, Bilkins confirmed that his helping the FBI catch Verone would end with his and Brian's criminal records being erased. Bilkins monitored Brian and Roman's progress in the company of Verone and Fuentes, and was informed of the situation whenever the two checked in to report their progress.\n\nWhen the time came to arrest Verone, Bilkins monitored Markham's sting at the airport and Roman and Brian's situation from Customs HQ. Roman and Brian's chase leads the police to a warehouse. During the racers scramble, Bilkins assumes that Brian and Roman are still driving the Spyder and Evo. However, when the cars are cornered, Tej Parker and Suki are found instead.\n\n\n\nBilkins is a veteran agent in the FBI with the rank of Special Agent. During the events of The Fast and the Furious, Bilkins is openly mistrustful of Brian's loyalty to the LAPD and his undercover mission, despite Tanner's faith in the cop. Bilkins is willing to get the job done through whatever means he possibly can, and spares little sympathy. He is seemingly proven right when Brian lets Dominic Toretto go free and abandons the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nIn 2 Fast 2 Furious, Bilkins's opinion of Brian appears to have shifted. Bilkins is more than willing to go along with Brian's way of handling his assignment with Verone, placing more trust in his abilities despite Agent Markham's severe doubts in his Brian's loyalty.\n\n\nTransparent Gallery Button\nThe The Fast and the Furious Wiki has a collection of images and media related to Bilkins.\n\n\nAd blocker interference detected!\n\nWikia is a free-to-use site that makes money from advertising.

        "text":"\n\nThe recovery operation, which successfully concluded on August 7, marks 13 years since the bell of the Hood was discovered. The salvage effort was spearheaded by the Paul G Allen Family Foundation using a ROV built by Blue Water Recoveries, which made the initial discovery. Allen led a previous attempt to retrieve the bell in 2009, which was abandoned due to poor weather.\n\nAs a warship, the Hood remains the property of the Crown and is officially designated a war grave. Salvage is therefore prohibited and Allen was given extraordinary permission by the British government to recover the bell.\n\nHMS Hood was commissioned in 1920 and, as the flagship of the British Battlecruiser Squadron, it was one of the most advanced (and generally regarded as the most beautiful) of the Royal Navy's interwar capital ships. She was sunk on May 24, 1941 while engaging the pocket battleship Bismarck, which was attempting to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to prey on Allied shipping.\n\nUltimately, the Bismark was cornered and sunk, but not before landing a shell on the under-armored deck of the Hood. The shell pierced the deck and detonated the cruiser's magazine. The resulting explosion killed 1,415 officers and men with only three survivors. The Hood was the largest Royal Navy ship ever sunk and the greatest single loss of life.\n\nThe inscribed bell is made of brass and is 18 in (46 cm) high. It was cast for the previous HMS Hood, which was a Victorian battleship that served until 1914. The recovery effort was aided by the fact that when the later ship broke apart in 1941, the bell landed well away from the main wreckage.\n\nThe ROV used to recover the bell of HMS Hood(Credit: Paul G Allen)\n\nAccording to the Royal Navy, the bell will undergo a year of restoration and will then go on display at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth.\n\nThe video below shows the recovery of HMS Hood's bell.\n\n\nView gallery - 12 images",

        "text":"When it comes to heating your home and running appliances, it can be difficult to know whether gas or electricity is the best option.\u00a0Both fuels offer a number of pros, but equally can have a number of cons. The best one for you will depend upon a whole range of factors including your property, lifestyle, and requirements.\u00a0\n\nAverage Costs\n\nOn average, based on standard rates, electricity is approximately three times more expensive than gas per kWh. This means that, when used in conjunction with an efficient modern condensing boiler, gas is the cheapest fuel to heat the home.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember, however, that there are additional costs involved if you choose to switch to gas but do not already have a gas supply to your home. For example, there will be a cost to bring the gas supply in and, in some circumstances it is not possible at all. You will also need to cover the cost of a boiler and room radiators, which can run into several thousands of pounds, and regular checks are recommended to ensure that the system is performing well.\n\n\nThe efficiency of a gas boiler is never as high as its electrical equivalent, even when the boiler is brand new. An electric radiator, for example, turns 1 kWh of electricity into 1 unit of heat (meaning they are 100% efficient), whilst a brand new boiler is approximately 90% efficient.\n\n\nWhilst the majority of homes in the UK have access to electricity, a substantial number of properties don\u2019t have access to gas. That\u2019s not to say, however, that these people can not run their home on gas, but rather than mains gas, they will have to use LPG (Liquid Petroliam Gas), which is typically more expensive.\n\n\nWhen it comes to cooking, electricity and gas both offer a number of pros and cons.\n\nA gas hob provides an instant, constant flame that you can adjust within seconds. The flame also spreads evenly along the bottom and sides of the pan, meaning that food cooks more quickly and evenly. As discussed above, if you already have a gas supply within your home, the energy and operating costs of using a gas stove are lower than electricity.\n\nOn the other hand, gas stoves tend to be more expensive to purchase and connect.\n\nElectric stoves are less expensive to purchase initially and easier to install than gas stoves (they also tend to look sleek and stylish too!). They are, however, considerably more expensive to run.\n\nWhen cooking, they do, however, tend to cook food more slowly and, if there are frequent power failures in you area, you will not be able to use your stove whilst the power is down.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s up to you to decide what is best for you, your family and your home. It\u2019s often worth consulting a professional, so be sure to look on\u00a0Which? Trusted Traders for\u00a0endorsed\u00a0electricians\u00a0and\u00a0gas installers.\n\nMore on this...",

Mark Carvell, UK Government, Department for Culture, Media and Sport\n\nSession description\n\nCoE side event on the occasion of EuroDIG 2016 (Brussels, 10 June 2016)\n\nOn 30 March 2016, the Council of Europe adopted a new Internet governance strategy 2016-2019 which focuses inter alia on the setting-up of a platform between governments and major Internet companies and representative associations on their respect for human rights and the rule of law online, including on measures (such as model contractual arrangements for the terms of service of Internet platforms, and principles of accountability and transparency to the multi-stakeholder community regarding the collection, storage and analysis of personal data) to protect, respect and remedy challenges and violations to them.\n\nIn a press release issued on 4 April 2016, the Commisioner for Human Rights underlined that the effects of business practices on human rights have become a central issue for human rights protection. He continued by saying that the right to privacy and freedom of expression have become major themes with reference to private companies which control and operate on the Internet and the wider digital environment (see note 3). He also referred to a recent survey carried out by The Economist (see note 4) which highlighted that many businesses have started to view themselves as important actors in respecting human rights.\n\nWhile it is the task of governments to secure for everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, there is now wide recognition that businesses should respect human rights. This is confirmed by the Committee of Ministers in a Declaration in 2014 (see note 5) and a Recommendation in 2016 (see note 6).\n\nThe Internet enables the exercise of these rights and freedoms. At the same time, the fast pace of technological change coupled with the cross-border delivery of Internet service makes it a challenge to protect and enforce these rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, the Internet has also become an instrument of choice for terrorists spreading propaganda, the recruitment of terrorists and the development of terrorist operations. Cybercrime is rapidly increasing. There can be confusion regarding the choice of law and jurisdiction to apply when securing evidence in the cloud. More broadly, the protection of personal data and the right to privacy online are at odds with the very nature of the Internet which is to facilitate the free flow of data in an open environment. There are many other concerns, such as hate speech, abusive forms of expression online, and the blocking, filtering and takedown of Internet content a comparative law study on which has been commissioned by the Secretary General.\n\nConsidering these challenges, there is an important need for governments and Internet companies to meet and discuss these challenges and to see together what they should do to address them. The Council of Europe seeks to offer a unique setting to foster co-operation between governments and business in order to protect Internet users and promote the Internet as one trusted space for all.\n\n\n  1. For example no hate speech online, privacy, child safety, mass surveillance, trans-border data flows, cybersecurity, \u2018Internet of Things\u2019, law enforcement access to data across borders, human rights for Internet users.\n  2. The Terms of Service and Human Rights Project by the Center for Technology and Society at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas Law School in Rio de Janeiro developed a methodology to analyse the degree of protection of privacy, freedom of expression and due process offered by the Terms of Service (ToS) of a variety of online platforms. The standards identified as a basis for the methodology derive from existing international human rights documents, notably including the Council of Europe's Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users. The Project has analysed the policies of a corpus of 50 platforms in a pilot experience aimed at enhancing the methodology and identifying the main practices adopted by platform providers. Some of the main goals of the project are to: (i) trigger international debate on the role of online platforms\u2019 providers as cyber-regulators and fulfil their responsibility to respect human rights; (ii) produce evidence on the impact of ToS on individuals\u2019 human rights; and (iii) put forward concrete policy recommendations to enhance the respect of users\u2019 rights.\n  3.

        "text":"Horse Joint Supplements Guide\n\nConfused by all the formulas out there? Here are the most common ingredients in joint nutraceuticals, what they do and the recommended levels\nImage placeholder title\n\nAdapted from an article that appeared on EquiSearch\n\nHorse joint supplements work! We finally have some formal studies that back this claim up. However, \"nutraceuticals,\" as these compounds are called, are not tightly regulated by the FDA, so \"consumer beware\" applies. Indeed, it's easy to get lost among all the products and their ingredients.\n\nThe best approach with equine joint supplements is to read the labels to make sure the product contains appropriate ingredients in effective amounts. NOTE: These are the recommended levels if each ingredient is being used alone. When combined, many ingredients are effective at lower levels because they then work synergistically with the other ingredients.\n\nGlucosamine is the best-studied ingredient in joint supplements. The basic building block of all connective tissues, including cartilage, it comes as either glucosamine sulfate or glucosamine hydrochloride, both of which are effective. It's best to stick with either the manufactured pure glucosamine or shellfish sources.\n\nGlucosamine relieves pain, sometimes in as short a time as 10 to 14 days. Studies have shown that it can slow cartilage breakdown and may encourage healing. An effective dose is 6,000 to 10,000 mg\/day. The 10,000 mg dose is usually needed for horses that are being worked. This higher level is also recommended during the first week or two of any horse's treatment, known as the \"loading\" period, which helps speed up results.\n\nChondroitin sulfate is a major structural component of cartilage, bone, and tough connective tissues such as the whites of the eyes. The pain-relieving effects of chondroitin are not as obvious as with glucosamine, although some observers report that horses on chondroitin only seem to move more \"fluidly\" overall. Formal studies on chondroitin give mixed results, with its greatest benefit appearing to be prevention of further cartilage breakdown. An effective dose is between 1,250 and 5,000 mg\/day.\n\nGlucosamine + Chondroitin\nRecent research shows that best results are obtained when using combinations of glucosamine and chondroitin, rather than using either substance alone. Many equine joint supplements now combine these two ingredients (among other things). What you will often find, though, is that a product may contain both ingredients, but the dosage of one, or both, is low compared to the individual dosages listed above. Your best bet is to use a combination product that supplies a full dose of glucosamine (for pain control) and as close to a correct dose of chondroitin as you can find.\n\nKeep in mind that glucosamine and chondroitin are the cornerstones of any joint supplement program. Unless new research eventually shows something else works better, you should focus on those two.\n\nHyaluronic Acid(HA)\nAn important component of both the cartilage itself and the joint fluid, Hyaluronic Acid has been available as an oral supplement. It is particularly good for controlling pain, heat and swelling. The gel formulations cost more, but seem to give the most rapid and reliable results. Dosage is 100 mg\/day.\n\nHA is also found in a variety of powdered supplements. Addition of as little as 20 mg to a glucosamine and chondroitin combination product may make a difference for some horses. In other cases, you will have to use the full 100 mg dose or even more. If your horse has not responded as well to glucosamine and chondroitin as you had hoped, this is a reasonable next step. You can get an idea of how your horse may respond by first trying a gel in addition to your regular supplement for a few days.\n\nAvocado and Soy Unsaponifiables (ASU)\nAvocado and soy unsaponifiables are plant fats that are normally protected from digestion and absorption in the intestinal tract but are extracted and purified by a special procedure. In an equine study where arthritis was induced by a surgical procedure, these substances showed a protective effect against cartilage breakdown in a group of supplemented horses compared to those not supplemented. However, they did not appear to have an effect on pain. Yet studies in other species have shown that the release of inflammatory substances is inhibited, while growth factors needed for repair and maintenance increase.\n\nASU is classified as a \"chondroprotective\" (chondro = cartilage). It is a slow-acting substance. You won't see results overnight. Effective equine dose is at least 1,200 mg\/day.\n\nMethylsulfonylmethane (MSM)\nAlthough it is still not clear how methylsulfonylmethane works, or what the long-term side effects might be, it is an effective anti-inflammatory. One equine study in horses with hock arthritis showed it takes a dose of at least 20,000 mg\/day to be effective. MSM is added to many joint supplements but rarely in doses that high. To assess your horse's response to MSM, buy a pure MSM product and add that at varying doses.\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen\nCollagen is a protein that forms the structural framework for all connective tissues in the body, including bone and cartilage. Hydrolyzed collagen is collagen that has been purified and also broken down into smaller protein units for easier digestion and absorption. It has naturally occurring amounts of glucosamine, chondroitin and hyaluronic acid, but the benefit is believed to come from the connective tissue-specific protein and amino acids.\n\nCollagen hydrolysates have been used to promote wound and ulcer healing, and most recently, as a treatment for arthritis. However, the dosages required to get this effect in people have been quite high, and a horse may need as much as 40,000 mg a day.\n\nCetylated Fatty Acids (cetyl myristoleate, or CMO)\nCMO (sometimes marketed under the name Celadrin) has received mixed reviews. It may help with pain and protect cartilage in some cases. It works better when combined with therapeutic dosages of other joint support nutrients, but no studies have been done to compare the combination of CMO with glucosamine\/chondroitin versus just the glucosamine and chondroitin alone. Minimum equine dose is likely to be at least 1,400 mg.\n\nVitamin C\nVitamin C is essential for the health of cartilage and other connective tissues, but this is definitely an area where more is NOT better. Excessive amounts may even damage cartilage. No equine studies are available. The equine equivalent of a human dose found to have a mild effect would be 4,000 mg\/day, but a horse's body is capable of manufacturing its own vitamin C, and this could be too high. A horse on fresh pasture is taking in about 1,000 to 2,000 mg\/day of vitamin C from grass.\n\nA variety of anti-inflammatory herbs are often added to equine joint supplements, but there's no guarantee the amount being added is enough to have any effect. These herbs are most useful for horses that continue to have pain despite adequate doses of other joint nutraceuticals. The list of herbs is a long one, but here are two of the most commonly used and their likely effective dosages:\n\n\u2022 Yucca\u20143,000 mg\/day of 10% saponin powder to 15,000 mg\/day of 2% saponin powder\n\u2022 Boswellia\u2014500 mg\/day of extract\n\nManganese is a trace mineral that plays a critical role in cartilage metabolism. It is required for the production of chondroitin sulfate in the body. However, if your horse's hay, pasture and grain are average quality, he is not only meeting his minimum requirements but probably getting a lot more manganese than he needs. With minerals, more is definitely not better. Avoid manganese entirely or find the lowest dose you can (25 mg or less) while still getting the other ingredients you're after.\n\nCopper and Zinc\nThese minerals aren't included as commonly, but many equine diets are both high in manganese and low to downright deficient in copper and zinc. Copper plays a key role in connective tissue formation, and both copper and zinc are involved in one of the body's important antioxidant enzyme systems. If they are in the supplement, 50 mg of copper and 150 mg of zinc are reasonable and safe potshot levels.\n\nSumming Up\n\u2022 Don't wait until your horse is severely lame to start a joint supplement. Some changes may be irreversible.\n\u2022 Start with a supplement that provides 6,000 to 10,000 milligrams (mg) glucosamine and 1,250 to 5,000 mg chondroitin.\n\u2022 Hyaluronic Acid is most useful for acute flare-ups or for horses with persistent heat and swelling, which indicates ongoing inflammation.\n\u2022 Avocado and soy unsaponifiables and cetylated fatty acids are both slow-acting ingredients that may protect against further cartilage breakdown.\n\nTIP: Look for the NASC seal for assured quality and safety\u2014and stick with research-based products! For example, Absorbine was one of the first companies in the industry to perform a clinical field study on joint supplements. Today, the company's Flex+Max Optimized Pellets contain guaranteed levels of glucosamine (10,000 mg) and chondroitin sulfate (1,200 mg in a special low molecular weight to enhance its bioavailability), as well as 5,000 mg methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), 150 mg of Hyaluronic Acid and 5.6 g. rice bran. Also included: 11g of flaxseed, 130 mg of Boswellia Serrata and fenugreek for increased palatability.\n\nRelated Articles",

It is suggested[] that the Kumeyaay name for the area was transcribed by the Spanish settlers as La Jolla. An alternative, pseudo-etymological suggestion for the origin of the name is that it is an alternate spelling of the Spanish word la joya, which means \"the jewel\". Despite being disputed by scholars, this derivation of the name has been widely cited in popular culture.[11] That supposed origin gave rise to the nickname \"Jewel City\".[12]\n\nEarly history\n\n\"Red Roost\" and \"Red Rest\", two bungalow cottages built in 1894 on the road above La Jolla Cove. In recent years the cottages have been covered in tarpaulins.\nThe side view of \"Red Roost\", a bungalow cottage built in 1894, one of two that still exist on the road above La Jolla Cove.\n\nDuring the Mexican period of San Diego's history, La Jolla was mapped as pueblo land and contained about 60 lots. When California became a state in 1850, the La Jolla area was incorporated as part of the chartered City of San Diego. In 1870 Charles Dean acquired several of the pueblo lots and subdivided them into an area that became known as La Jolla Park. Dean was unable to develop the land and left San Diego in 1881. A real estate boom in the 1880s led speculators Frank T. Botsford and George W. Heald to further develop the sparsely settled area.\n\nIn the 1890s the San Diego, Pacific Beach, and La Jolla Railway was built, connecting La Jolla to the rest of San Diego. La Jolla became known as a resort area. To attract visitors to the beach, the railway built facilities such as a bath house and a dance pavilion. Visitors were housed in small cottages and bungalows above La Jolla Cove, as well as a temporary tent city, erected every summer. Two of the cottages that were built in 1894 still exist: the \"Red Roost\" and the \"Red Rest\", also known as the \"Neptune and Cove Tea Room\"; the two cottages have been vacant since the 1980s, and are covered in tarpaulins. The La Jolla Park Hotel opened in 1893. The Hotel Cabrillo was built in 1908 by \"Squire\" James A. Wilson and was later incorporated into the La Valencia Hotel.[13]\n\nBy 1900, La Jolla comprised 100 buildings and 350 residents. The first reading room (library) was built in 1898.[13] A volunteer fire brigade was organized in 1907; the city of San Diego established a regular fire house in 1914. Livery stable owner Nathan Rannells served successively as La Jolla's volunteer fire captain, first police officer (the only San Diego police officer north of Mission Valley), and first postmaster.[14]\n\nLa Jolla Elementary School began educating local children in 1896.[15]The Bishop's School opened in 1909. La Jolla High School was established in 1922. Between 1951 and 1963, other elementary schools (Bird Rock, Decatur, Scripps, and Torrey Pines) were established in the area to ease overcrowding.[15] The La Jolla Beach and Yacht Club (later the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club) was built in 1927.[13]\n\nEllen Browning Scripps\n\nLa Jolla Recreational Center\n\nIn 1896 journalist and publisher Ellen Browning Scripps settled in La Jolla, where she lived for the last 35 years of her life. She was wealthy in her own right from her investments and writing, and she inherited a large sum from her brother George H. Scripps in 1900. Unmarried and childless, she devoted herself to philanthropic endeavors, particularly those benefiting her adopted home of La Jolla. She commissioned many of La Jolla's most notable buildings, usually designed by Irving Gill or his nephew and partner Louis John Gill. Many of these buildings are now on the National Register of Historic Places or are listed as historic by the city of San Diego; these include the La Jolla Woman's Club (1914), the La Jolla Recreational Center (1915), the earliest buildings of The Bishop's School, and the Old Scripps Building at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as her own residence, built in 1915 and now housing the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. Her donations also launched the Scripps Memorial Hospital in 1924 (originally located on Prospect Street in La Jolla until it moved to its present site in 1964), the Scripps Metabolic Clinic (now the Scripps Research Institute), and the Children's Pool. Ellen Browning Scripps also founded Scripps College, a women's college, in 1926.[16] Scripps College is located in Claremont in Los Angeles County (not to be confused with Clairemont, a community of San Diego).\n\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\n\nScripps Institution of Oceanography pier\n\nThe Scripps Institution of Oceanography, one of the nation's oldest oceanographic institutes, was founded in 1903 by William Emerson Ritter, chair of the zoology department at the University of California, Berkeley, with financial support from Scripps and her brother E. W. Scripps. At first the institution operated out of a boathouse in Coronado. In 1905 they purchased a 170-acre (69\u00a0ha) site in La Jolla where the Institution still stands today. The first laboratory buildings there opened in 1907. The institution became part of the University of California in 1912. Ultimately it became the nucleus for the establishment of the University of California San Diego.\n\nCamp Matthews\n\nFrom 1917 through 1964 the United States Marine Corps maintained a military base in La Jolla. The base was used for marksmanship training and was known as Camp Calvin B. Matthews. During and after World War II the population of La Jolla grew, causing residential development to draw close to the base, so that it became less and less suitable as a firing range because of risk to the adjacent civilian population.[17] Meanwhile, the site was being eyed as a location for a proposed new campus of the University of California. In 1962 Camp Matthews was declared surplus by the Marine Corps. The base formally closed in 1964, and that same year the first class of undergraduates enrolled in the University of California San Diego.\n\nUniversity of California\n\nLocal civic leaders had long toyed with the idea of a San Diego campus of the University of California, and the quest became more definite following World War II. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, under its director Roger Revelle, had become an important defense contractor, and local aerospace companies like Convair were pressing for local training for their scientists and engineers. The state legislature proposed the idea in 1955, and the Regents of the University formally approved it in 1960.[18] The campus was originally named \"University of California, La Jolla\", but the name was changed to \"University of California, San Diego\" in 1960.[19] The founding chancellor was Herbert York, named in 1961, and the second chancellor was John Semple Galbraith, named in 1964. The university was designed to have a \"college\" system; there are now six colleges. The first college was established in 1965 and was named Revelle College after Roger Revelle, who is regarded as the \"father\" of the university.[19] A medical school was established in 1968. The landmark Geisel Library with its Brutalist architecture opened in 1970.\n\n\nThe Camp Matthews site for the University was selected with some hesitation; one of the concerns was \"whether La Jollans in particular would lay aside old prejudices in order to welcome a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse professoriate into their midst\".[18] La Jolla had a history of restrictive housing policies, often specified in deeds and ownership documents. In La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Hermosa, only people with pure European ancestry could own property; this excluded Jews, who were not considered white. Such \"restrictive covenants\" were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer ruled them to be unenforceable, and Congress outlawed them twenty years later via the Fair Housing Act (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968).[20] However, realtors and property o...

        "text":"The Taqwacores\n\n\nThe Taqwacores is the debut novel by Michael Muhammad Knight, depicting a fictitious Islamic punk rock scene. The title is a portmanteau of taqwa, an Islamic concept of love and fear for Allah, and Hardcore, the punk rock subgenre. Some of the most popular taqwacore bands are: The Kominas, Al-Thawra, Secret Trial Five, Fedayeen, and the Sagg Taqwacore Syndicate. The novel has also been credited by Asra Nomani as first presenting her the idea for woman-led prayer, leading to a historic woman-led congregation on March 18, 2005 with Amina Wadud acting as imam.\n\nKnight originally self-published The Taqwacores in DIY zine format, giving copies away for free until finding distribution with Alternative Tentacles, the punk record label founded by Jello Biafra. After receiving an endorsement from Peter Lamborn Wilson (aka Hakim Bey), the novel was published by radical press Autonomedia. A UK version is published by Telegram Books. In its Italian translation, the novel is retitled Islampunk.\n\nThe narrator of The Taqwacores, Yusuf Ali, is a Pakistani American engineering student from Syracuse, New York, who lives off campus with a diverse group of Muslims in their house in Buffalo. Besides being their home, the house serves as a place to have punk parties and a place for Muslims not comfortable with the Muslim Student Association or local mosques to have Friday prayer.\n\nThe book also inspired a documentary entitled Taqwacore: The Birth of Punk Islam, directed by Omar Majeed, which follows author Michael Muhammad Knight and several Taqwacore bands across the United States. It was released in Montreal, Canada, at the Cin\u00e9ma du Parc on October 19, 2009.\n\nSoft Skull Press is publishing the revised edition, which became available in December 2008.\n\nThis content is from Wikipedia.

        "text":"1. A nucleic acid, found mostly in the cytoplasm of cells, that is important in the synthesis of proteins. The amount of RNA varies from cell to cell. RNA, like the structurally similar DNA, is a chain made up of subunits called nucleotides. In protein synthesis, messenger RNA (mRNA) replicates the DNA code for a protein and moves to sites in the cell called ribosomes. There, transfer RNA (tRNA) assembles amino acids to form the protein specified by the messenger RNA. Most forms of RNA (including messenger and transfer RNA) consist of a single nucleotide strand, but a few forms of viral RNA that function as carriers of genetic information (instead of DNA) are double-stranded. 2. A nucleic acid associated with the control of chemical activities inside a cell. One type of RNA transfers information from the cell's DNA to the protein-forming system of a cell outside the nucleus. Some viruses (e.g., HIV) carry RNA instead of the more usual genetic material DNA.

        "text":"In pre\u2010Christian and extra\u2010Christian usage the Greek word rendered \u201cbishop,\u201d episkopos, and its cognates, refers primarily to caring for something or someone. This can involve a person's oversight of a task or a group of people, such as priests in a temple, or God's own oversight of a person or an event.\n\nThe word occurs rarely in the New Testament and only in later documents with the exception of Philippians 1.1; the other passages are Acts 1.20; 20.28; 1 Peter 2.25; 1 Timothy 3.1\u20132; Titus 1.7. Acts 1.20 is a citation from Psalm 109.8 used to legitimate the selection of a replacement for Judas among the disciples. Acts 20.28 is from a speech by Paul encouraging his audience to \u201ckeep watch \u2026 over all the flock, of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God.\u201d The three citations from the Pastoral Letters have to do with requirements for the position or role of episkopos within the church.\n\nMuch of the debate about the usage of the term in the New Testament and early Christianity has been concerned with the evolution of an office called \u201cbishop.\u201d Is it an authoritative role within the church that existed from apostolic times? Or should it be understood as a general term giving some measure of honor and perhaps authority to any believer? Naturally, different Christian traditions have various stakes in how these questions are answered.\n\nWith the exception of Philippians 1.1, all of the texts cited above probably come from the very end of the first or the beginning of the second century CE. Acts 20.28 and the citations from the Pastoral Letters seem to have in mind a specific group of leaders who look out for the well\u2010being of the larger church. Philippians 1.1 seems to have a similar sense; the overseers are mentioned together with deacons, but there is no further indication of how they might have functioned. The Pastorals associate certain responsibilities with the office. The episkopos is a teacher, a good host, possesses only one wife, is above reproach, and perhaps is good in a debate (Titus 1.7); there is no evidence that this overseer had responsibility outside the local church.\n\nThe letters of Clement of Rome (ca. 95 CE) and Ignatius of Antioch (ca. 115 CE) demonstrate the development of a hierarchical office that eventually became dominant. The office of bishop is thus an indicator of the evolution of Christianity from a popular Palestinian movement to a sophisticated institution with offices, authorities, and hierarchy.\n\nJ.

Street demonstrations quickly grew into a national revolutionary movement that in 18 days removed Mubarak and his National Democratic Party (NDP) from power. In the beginning of the uprising, mass demonstrations in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, and the occupation of Cairo's central Tahrir (Liberation) Square were met with repression and violence by police and supporters of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). But Egyptians broke through the wall of fear and fought back in street battles. On Jan. 27 the government shut down the Internet and mobile service providers complied with government requests to suspend service. Still the uprising continued, and the army made the decision ultimately not to act against the protesters. Mubarak's weak concessions --appointing intelligence Omar Suleiman as vice president on Jan. 29; installing a new cabinet on Jan. 31; conceding that he wouldn't run again for president nor would his son Gamal after he finished his term in Sept. 2011 -- failed to appease the Egyptian people\u2019s demands. On Feb. 11, a day of massive \u201cFriday of Departure\u201d demonstrations, Mubarak was finally forced to resign. The Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) headed by Tantawi took over control of Egypt and later dissolved the legislature and suspended the constitution.\n\nBackground, Timeline, Maps - Jan. 25 - Feb. 11, 2011\n\nWeb Archives\n\nSocial Media & Networks\n\nE-Publications and Documentaries\n\n\nSubject Headings (Search Terms in the Library Catalog)\n\nSearch the\u00a0Library Catalog\u00a0to find books, journals (in print and digital), databases, DVDs, CDs and more in all campus libraries and beyond.

His presentation of the early country blues styles in a contemporary band setting is unique in Michigan. Although he has taken his blues singing, guitar playing, and harmonica playing to Washington, D.C. and on European tours, Eddie is the only pure blues musician to live and perform continuously in Michigan.\n\nEddie grew up in the small Mississippi Delta towns of Wells and Dublin, where he heard country blues recordings in his grandfather's juke joint and listened to his father play blues on harmonica, guitar, and piano. His greatest influences from country blues recordings came from Tommy McClennan, Memphis Minnie, and Big Bill Broonzy on guitar and from John Lee \"Sonny Boy\" Williamson on harmonica. The harmonica was Eddie's first instrument as a boy. Playing \"one string guitar\" on the side of the house led Eddie to playing the six-string guitar.\n\nAfter teaming up with blues guitarist John T. Smith in Davenport, Iowa, Eddie moved with John to Detroit in 1948. They played blues at house parties and eventually began to back up John Lee Hooker in performances and on recordings. When Hooker began touring nationally, he groomed Eddie to fill in for him at clubs and in recording sessions. Eddie moved toward the modern blues guitar style of T-Bone Walker by the early 1950s, and he adapted to the R&B sounds coming out of Motown and Staz labels. As blues gained a worldwide revival in the late 1960s, Eddie began touring European countries, playing blues throughout the 1970s.\n\nEddie's album Detroit on the U.S. label Blue Suit shows his deep roots and originality. The recording features country blues standards like \"Bottle Up and Go\" and \"Blue Jay (Fly Down South For Me)\" performed with fresh band arrangements. Eddie acknowledges the shared repertoire that is the mark of country blues: \"There ain't no notes that never been played before, you just rearrange them, in your own way.\" (1)\n\nHis maintenance of blues tradition while contributing new compositions and effects on the guitar and harmonica makes Eddie Burns a key bearer of the living blues tradition.\n\n(1) Burns, Eddie.
