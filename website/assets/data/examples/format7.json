Parents encourage their sons to play with toy guns and rejoice when boys can stand up for themselves. Every Russian man internalizes such principles as not letting others to hurt himself or his family, being able to physically challenge an attacker, protecting the weak, and always resisting an urge to cry.\n\nBehind the brick wall\n\nAlthough not every Russian man manages to correspond to the values imposed by the society, most Russian males strongly believe that their calling in life is to protect and provide for their family, support their parents, children and wife. Russians even have a saying to describe men - \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439 which means \"as if behind the stone wall\". The saying is used in the sense that a man is strong and reliable like a solid wall behind which a woman can hide and forget all her fears and worries.\n\nGentle and romantic\n\nDespite everything, Russian men are very romantic at heart. They are capable of experiencing deep feelings and know how to be loyal and faithful. When a woman awards her beloved one with affection the man becomes caring and gentle, gives flowers and presents to his darling. Russian men feel shy about their weaknesses and rarely open their heart before strangers. However they stay open to their wives and are able to address any concern.\n\nCareer and success\n\nIn Russia, it is traditionally believed that a man must be more successful at work as compared to a woman. Building a career is easier for males and they usually earn higher salaries as compared to females. Still there is no absolute guarantee against economic difficulties. If a man fails to succeed in life he can experience difficult times, which in turn causes increased alcohol consumption to relieve the effects of stress. During such difficult times, it is important for Russian men to find support from the loved ones who can understand and support the man.\n\nMale friendships and entertainment for men\n\nRussian men place great importance on friendships. In Russia, men tend to build their friendships for years and male friends often become as close as relatives. The companies of male friends often entertain themselves with such traditional activities for men as fishing and hunting. Fishing and hunting are the hobbies of practically all men in Russia. Russian women do not normally participate in these traditionally masculine activities, preferring to stay at home and wait patiently for their husbands to come back.\n\nGot questions?\n\nAsk them in the Russian Questions and Answers \u2014 a place for students, teachers and native Russian speakers to discuss Russian grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and other aspects of the Russian language.\n\nCopyright 2001-2022 MasterRussian.com | Privacy Policy | Contact Us\n\n--> \ufeff Search MasterRussian\n\nCustom Search\n\nEnglish\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0Russian\u00a0dictionary\n\nLike MasterRussian on Facebook\n\n\u00a0RSS | iGoogle | My Yahoo!\n\n\ufeffWord: \u0440\u0430\u0437\nMeaning: time, one, once\nPronunciation: [rahs]\nLearn Russian words more... \u00bb\n\n\n\n\nRussian: \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f\nEnglish: Watch for cars\n\n\nMasterRussian on Twitter",

        "text":"What are Padrinos?\n\nEveryone has heard the term, but what are padrinos exactly? Well, in english, it directly translates to two things, either \u201cgodparents\u201d or \u201csponsors\u201d, and both definitions play an important role in the latino community. \u00a0Padrinos and madrinas are ultimately the fairy godparents that are there for you throughout your life and especially during your big life events. Traditionally, during big events like quinceaneras, weddings, and baptisms, padrinos are chosen to accompany the person (or persons) being celebrated during the church ceremony and throughout the reception. Traditionally, they also help pay for the religious items used in the ceremony, like the bible, cross, rings, etc.\n\nNowadays, padrinos contribute in many more ways too. Some offer monetary gifts to help the person(s) being celebrated and their family pay for the party. Others choose to help by donating their time and effort to help make things like food or decorations, or who help with the tiny-but-important details, like buying the party favors and drinks.\n\nMaria with her Padrino\n\nHere is a quick break down of all the potential padrinos and madrinas that you could have at your quinceanera or wedding:\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos and Madrinas\n\nPadrinos and Madrinas are there to help you with whatever you may need, but they aren\u2019t only there to help you financially. They are also there to be your mentors, someone to go to when help is needed. They can help guide the quincea\u00f1era through their next steps in life. This wedding and quinceanera tradition is still widely used, especially within the Mexican community. Your padrinos can be any of the following:\n\n  \u2022 Friends\n  \u2022 Family\n  \u2022 Neighbors\n\nIt can be anyone close to the quinceanera\/novios or someone who just wants to help!\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos de Honor\n\nThe Padrinos de honor are the main padrinos of your quinceanera or wedding. This is not to say that the others are not as important, but these, in particular, will accompany you throughout your whole event. In most cases, the Padrinos de Honor are typically the same ones from your baptism.\n\nThey will play a huge part in the ceremony, especially for a quinceanera. They will sit or stand near the quincea\u00f1era at certain times and present her with some of the important ceremonial items (see below). They are also traditionally supposed to help pay for most of the party, but, in today\u2019s day, you can have as many people help out as you want!\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos (Godparents)\n\nSome quincea\u00f1eras and couples also have actual padrinos (godparents) from baptism, communion, or confirmation. They are typically involved throughout your entire life, \u00a0including presenting you to one of the Catholic sacraments. They often help out with big life events in one way or another, since they have already been around for so many of them in the past.\n\n\nPadrinos can be chosen by the person and family holding the event, but many padrinos usually offer themselves to be a padrino. Padrinos are some of the most important people that will participate in your event. If you have padrinos already in place or have yet to choose them, accept every bit of help \u2014 it goes a long way in planning your party! When accepting, always keep in mind that their help comes from a place of love and excitement for the person(s) being celebrated.\n\nIf you are celebrating a quinceanera, make sure to check out our planning guide on quinceanera traditions here.\n\nDiscussion2 comments\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

As part of this project Leitrim County Council provided approximately 9km of cycle lanes around and in the environs of Carrick on Shannon and an additional 4km of mixed use cycle areas in the town centre. In addition to this the walking route, Sli Slainte, has been upgraded.\u00a0\n\nCycle Lanes Carrick On Shannon\n\nThere are four different cycle lane design options used throughout the cycle network. They include:\u00a0\n\n  1. Mixed Street \/ Shared Road Use. This is where the cyclists share the roadway with the traffic. A reduced speed limit of 30 km\/hr was introduced in these areas, in order to facilitate the Shared Road Use. This system is in place in the town centre.\u00a0\n\n  1. Single Driving Lane with Advisory Cycle Lanes. This involves removing the centre lines and providing a wide two-way traffic lane with advisory cycle lanes on either side. Examples of these cycle lanes are can be found in Sunmmerhill, and MBNA \/ Community School road. Motorists are required to give way to cyclists, but motorists are allowed to drive in cycle lanes if it is safe to do so. These advisory cycle lanes are marked by a dashed white line.\u00a0\n\n  1. Dedicated On Road Cycle Lanes. These are provided, where the current width of roadway allowed, such as the on the N4 Dublin approach. Motorists are not allowed to drive in these lanes, and these lanes are marked by a solid white line.\u00a0\n\n  1. Off Road Cycling. Off road cycling is provided in single lane cycling alongside the N4 between the roundabouts, and a two way off road cycle lane is provided along the Castlecara road. \u00a0\n\nA number of bicycle parking shelters are also erected at strategic locations along the network, e.g. Tourist office, Fire station and in all the schools.\u00a0\n\nThe Map above shows details of the cycling network including locations of the cycle shelters.

        "text":"Seymour Narrows\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nSeymour Narrows is a 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) section of the Discovery Passage in British Columbia known for strong tidal currents.[1] Discovery Passage lies between Vancouver Island at Menzies Bay, British Columbia and Quadra Island except at its northern end where the eastern shoreline is Sonora Island. The section known as Seymour Narrows begins about 18\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) from the south end of Discovery Passage where it enters the Georgia Strait near Campbell River. For most of the length of the narrows, the channel is about 750 m wide. Through this narrow channel, currents can reach 15 kn.\n\nSeymour Narrows was described by Captain George Vancouver as \"one of the vilest stretches of water in the world.\"[2] Even after Ripple Rock was removed, it remains a challenging route. In March 1981, the Star Philippine, a freighter, ran aground in the narrows.\n\nSeymour Narrows is notable also because the flowing current can be sufficiently turbulent to realize a Reynolds number of about 10^9, i.e. one billion, which is possibly the largest Reynolds number regularly attained in natural water channels on Earth (the current speed is about 8 m\/s, the nominal depth about 100 m). Turbulence develops usually around a Reynolds number of 2000, depending on the geometric structure of the channel.\n\nRipple Rock[edit]\n\nMain article: Ripple Rock\n\nRipple Rock was a submerged twin-peak mountain that lay just nine feet beneath the surface of Seymour Narrows. It was a serious hazard to shipping, sinking 119 vessels and taking 114 lives. The gunboat USS Saranac was one of the rock's first recorded victims. On April 5, 1958, after twenty-seven months of tunnelling and engineering work, Ripple Rock was blown up with 1,375 tons of Nitramex 2H explosive making it the largest commercial, non-nuclear blast in North America. The Halifax Explosion in 1917 was larger but it was not a deliberate act.\n\nThe event was broadcast live on Canadian Television. The footage is also regularly screened at the Campbell River Museum.\n\nVancouver band The Evaporators wrote a song about the event and released it on their 2004 album Ripple Rock.\n\n\nCanadian Tide and Current Tables, Vol. 6, 2003\n\nExternal links[edit]\n\nCoordinates: 50\u00b008.2\u2032N 125\u00b021.2\u2032W\ufeff \/ \ufeff50.1367\u00b0N 125.3533\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 50.1367; -125.3533",
