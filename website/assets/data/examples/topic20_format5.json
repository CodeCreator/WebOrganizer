        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\n  1. How Secure is the information?\n\n  2. Is my data backed up?\n\n  3. Is there a commitment period for using Flockwatch?\n\n  4. What if our church has a need that Flockwatch doesn't provide?\n\n  5. How is training provided?\n\n  6. Can I migrate my existing information into flockwatch?\n\n  7.

What printers can I use with Flockwatch?\n\n  14. How do we make payments and when are they due?\n\n  15. Can I trial the system?\n\n  16. I still have more questions - how can I get in touch?\n\nHow Secure is the information?\n\nWe take security of your information very seriously. All your data is stored on a server with a reputable Internet Service Provider and incorporates features that ensure high availablility and automatic failover to redundant hardware if required.\n\nAll data transferred from and to the Flockwatch database is encrypted using SSL certification. The SSL certificates are sourced from Thawte, who provide the highest level of encryption available for internet users. For more information on SSL click here.\n\nWhen you set up Flockwatch you have a large range of security options for who has access to your data and to what level. It is the responsibility of the people given access to keep their passwords private and to maintain the confidentiality of the data they have access to.\n\nThe team at Flockwatch have access to your data but our agreement with you is to only access this data on your request when providing help desk support and this information is treated in the strictest of confidence.\n\nThe final level of assurance is in the nature of the actual data included. No credit card or financial details are stored. Date of birth is permitted but not required, and may be entered as an estimate only. Pastoral notes have additional levels of privacy that can be customised for each note.\n\nIs my data backed up?\n\nYes, the data is backed up nightly. Backups are immediately available for the previous two evenings, as well as each Sunday night for the last 8 weeks. If for some reason you require a portion of your data restored, there may be a charge to provide this service depending on the complexity of the task.\n\nIs there a commitment period for using Flockwatch?\n\nNo - you can cease using Flockwatch at any time by notifying us. We will then simply cease monthly billing and disable your access. We aim to always exceed your expectations, and believe that once you start using Flockwatch, you will want to stay with us.\n\nWhat if our church has a need that Flockwatch doesn't provide?\n\nWe are always looking for ways to improve Flockwatch in a way that benefits other churches. If you have an idea for an enhancement or new feature then we are happy to hear it - simply add it as a help desk request. If we consider that this idea is achievable and will benefit other churches then we will generally include it at no charge. If your request is very specific to your own situation then we may quote this as a site specific modification. In the vast majority of cases the suggestions provided to us are added to the enhancement list and prioritised for implementation as soon as possible at no additional cost to the church making the suggestion.\n\nHow is training provided?\n\nFlockwatch has online training tutorials which enables users to learn about the system in their own time and at their own pace. We also find that in the early implementation stages system administrators often benefit from speaking with our help desk. We have therefore allowed some training time for assistance via Skype. We find that Skype is a very useful tool as it enables us to talk over the internet while sharing screens, allowing us to easily demonstrate set up alternatives.\n\nCan I migrate my existing information into flockwatch?\n\nIf you can load your existing information into a spreadsheet format, we can import it into Flockwatch for you. We have a number of import formats available, covering Person Demographics, Group Memberships, Training Courses Completed, and Actions Undertaken. If you have additional data that also requires importing, we are happy to discuss this with you and will investigate how we can accommodate your need.\n\nHow are families grouped together during data migration?\n\nWhen migrating the data, Flockwatch will group people into the same family if they have the same address and home phone number. Once people are grouped into families, it is a simple process to move people between families if this is required.\n\nIs there a charge for using the Help Desk?\n\nHelp Desk support is included in the monthly fee. The Help desk is available for nominated System Administrators - generally one or two people are permitted depending on your level of monthly support. System Administrators can lodge a request through the help desk and our aim is to respond within one working day. In most cases it will be much quicker. System Administrators can also book a Skype session to speak directly with the help desk.\n\nThere is a cap on the number of hours available per month for support depending on the level of monthly support you are paying. In most cases you are unlikely to exceed this but if your demand is high for some reason then we will notify you and discuss whether an additional fee will need to be charged. The training tutorials have been developed to cover most of your questions and we have found that once churches are past the initial set up the demand for the help desk is generally quite low, but we are always here to help.\n\nIs Flockwatch easy to set up and use?\n\nWe continually receive feedback on how easy Flockwatch is to use. It has been designed to enable staff and volunteers to easily do the tasks they need to do.\n\nSetting up Flockwatch can be more complex depending on the level of customization you require. Many churches have particular ways they prefer to work and don't want to conform to a one size fits all approach. To allow for this we have a large of range of options to customize Flockwatch for your church. But don't worry, we have video tutorials to explain the process and we are happy to speak with you regarding your needs and guide you through the set up process. It is helpful to find someone in your church who is aware of your systems and also good with computers to assist with the initial set up.\n\nIs there an ideal church size for using Flockwatch?\n\nCurrently we have churches with over 5,000 attenders. There is no upper limit on the size of a church as Flockwatch has been designed to meet the demands of very large churches Smaller churches who are focused on growth find that Flockwatch sets them up well for the future. We have offered a pricing structure which makes it more affordable for small churches. By the time your numbers reach about 150 you will start to receive the full benefits of using Flockwatch.\n\nIs there a limit on the number of users?\n\nThere is no limit on the number of users on Flockwatch. The pricing structure is based on the number of regular attenders not on the users or even the number of campuses.\n\nDoes Flockwatch Cater for Multiple Campuses?\n\nYou can include multiple campuses on the one system if you work as a single church that meets in different locations. If you have related churches where each church is mostly autonomous then we would encourage you to set up each church with their own database.\n\nWhat printers can I use with Flockwatch?\n\nFor printing reports within Flockwatch, any printer is fine. For printing labels and pickup cards for Children's Church Sign In, we only provide an interface to the Zebra GK420d, and some other superceded Zebra models. We have found the cost of the labels for the Zebra printers is far less than with other brands, and it is our desire to ensure that the ongoing cost to churches is kept to a minimum. The Zebra labels come out at about 1.5 cents each, while we have found that the equivalent Brother labels are around 7.5 cents each.\n\nHow do we make payments and when are they due?\n\nWhen you sign up, we will send you an Authority Form for Automatic Payments. This allows you to specify the credit card or Australian Bank Account that you wish us to debit for the payments relating to Flockwatch usage. We will issue you with an initial invoice for the set up fee. Then at the beginning of each month you will receive an automated monthly invoice for that months usage. Payment in Australian dollars will be automatically deducted within 3 working days from the account or card that you specify.\n\nIn order to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, your financial details are not keyed into Flockwatch. Instead, they are entered into a bank's payment processing system. This is an additional safeguard to the already significant security built into the application. Inet Solutions do not retain your financial details in an online environment.\n\nCan I trial the system?\n\nAbsolutely. Simply click on the Info Pack link below and follow the instructions.\n\nI still have more questions - how can I get in touch?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Home\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About Us\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 View Demo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Testimonials\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pricing \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FAQ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact Us \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Info Pack \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sign Up \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTerms and Conditions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Privacy Policy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Service Level Agreement",

Your email address will stay the same.\n\nI already have a gmail address, will it be affected?\n\nWhile gmail and UW Oshkosh both use the same email software, the accounts are completely separate to any personal address you may have.\n\nGmail has ads. Are there going to be advertisements in my email?\n\nNo, your account will not have advertisements of any kind.\n\nI used my address to sign up for a Google service such as Docs or Blogger. What happens to that account?\n\nIn this case, you have what Google call's a conflicting account. You will need to create a personal Gmail ( account to associate your personal data with. If you have a conflicting account, you will be presented with two options upon your first login to Google with your account after June 4.\n\nFollow Google's Conflicting Account and Data Migration Getting Started Guide to fix the conflicting account.\n\nSee this video on Google's site for a description of conflicting accounts and what you will need to do to resolve the conflict. In short, you will need to create a account to house the data previously associated with the conflicting account.\n\nWhat happens to my existing mail, calendar, and address book data?\n\nAll your mail and address books contacts will be copied to your new Titan Apps account for you, by UW Oshkosh IT staff. Because moving of your calendar data from the Sun TitanMail system to Titan Apps system cannot be automated, you will need to export your calendar(s) in TitanMail and import them into Titan Apps mail by using the Calendar Migration tool and instructions located at\n\nWhat won't be transferred automatically?\n\n  \u2022 Calendars, and their events (data)\n  \u2022 Calendar subscriptions\n  \u2022 Calendar sharing permissions\n  \u2022 Signatures\n  \u2022 Forwarding addresses\n  \u2022 Mail filters\n  \u2022 Vacation messages\n  \u2022 The contents of the following mail folders: Spam, Trash, Junk, Deleted Messages\n  \u2022 Any empty mail folders\n\nI manage a list serve (\u00a0 Do I need to have this transferred?\n\nWe will still be using mailman for all list serves.\u00a0 Any distribution list (that ends in will continue to work as is.\u00a0 This may eventually be replaced with Google Groups.\n\nHow is Titan Apps related to NetID?\n\nCurrently services such as D2L and TitanFiles use your email username and password to log in. Since email and the email password will be only be stored by Google, the email password can no longer be used for these on-campus services.

        "text":"From Oracle FAQ\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nOracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM) FAQ\n\nWhy should we use separate ASM home?[edit]\n\nASM should be installed separately from the database software in its own ORACLE_HOME directory. This will allow you the flexibility to patch and upgrade ASM and the database software independently.\n\nHow many ASM instances should one have?[edit]\n\nSeveral databases can share a single ASM instance. So, although one can create multiple ASM instances on a single system, normal configurations should have one and only one ASM instance per system.\n\nFor clustered systems, create one ASM instance per node (called +ASM1, +ASM2, etc).\n\nHow many diskgroups should one have?[edit]\n\nGenerally speaking one should have only one disk group for all database files - and, optionally a second for recovery files (see FRA).\n\nData with different storage characteristics should be stored in different disk groups. Each disk group can have different redundancy (mirroring) settings (high, normal and external), different fail-groups, etc. However, it is generally not necessary to create many disk groups with the same storage characteristics (i.e. +DATA1, +DATA2, etc. all on the same type of disks).\n\nTo get started, create 2 disk groups - one for data and one for recovery files. Here is an example:\n\nCREATE DISKGROUP data    EXTERNAL REDUNDANCY DISK '\/dev\/d1', '\/dev\/d2', '\/dev\/d3', ....;\nCREATE DISKGROUP recover EXTERNAL REDUNDANCY DISK '\/dev\/d10', '\/dev\/d11', '\/dev\/d12', ....;\n\nHere is an example how you can enable automatic file management with such a setup:\n\nALTER SYSTEM SET db_create_file_dest   = '+DATA' SCOPE=SPFILE;\nALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest = '+RECOVER' SCOPE=SPFILE;\n\nYou may also decide to introduce additional disk groups - for example, if you decide to put historic data on low cost disks, or if you want ASM to mirror critical data across 2 storage cabinets.\n\nIn 11gR2, an ASM Instance can have up to 63 disk groups, 10,000 disks and 1 million files for each disk group. In 12c, an ASM instance can have up to 511 disk groups, the other limits are not changed.\n\nShould I create table and index tablespaces in separate diskgroups?[edit]\n\nNo, tables and indexes can be stored within a single disk group. Do not create different disk groups for tables and indexes.\n\nHow to check how much disk space is allocated\/ in-use by an ASM instance?[edit]\n\nLogin to your +ASM instance (SYS AS SYSDBA) and execute the following query:\n\nSQL> SELECT name, free_mb, total_mb, free_mb\/total_mb*100 \"%\" FROM v$asm_diskgroup;\nNAME                              FREE_MB   TOTAL_MB    \u00a0%\n------------------------------ ---------- ---------- -----\nDATA                               917104    1482145  61.9\nRECOVER                             17387      17437  99.7\n\nFrom Oracle 10g Release 2, one can also use the asmcmd command line utility:\n\nUsed_MB      Mirror_used_MB\n   1523                1523\nASMCMD> lsdg\nState    Type    Rebal  Unbal  Sector  Block       AU  Total_MB  Free_MB  Req_mir_free_MB  Usable_file_MB  Offline_disks  Name\nMOUNTED  EXTERN  N      N         512   4096  1048576     11264     9885                0            9885              0  DISKGROUP1\/\nMOUNTED  EXTERN  N      N         512   4096  1048576     10240     9906                0            9906              0  FLASH\/\n\nHow big should I make my datafiles within ASM?[edit]\n\nUse uniform sized files (say 2 or 4 GB each). Reason being that the a 2TB datafile will unnecessarily extend backup and recovery times.\n\nASMCMD is very slow. How can I speed it up?[edit]\n\nThe asmcmd utility appears to be very slow. This slowness is a result of queries against the v$asm_diskgroup view. To solve this problem edit the $ORACLE_HOME\/bin\/asmcmdcore script and change all v$asm_diskgroup references to v$asm_diskgroup_stat.\n\nV$asm_diskgroup and v$asm_diskgroup_stat provides exactly the same information, but the\u00a0%_stat view operates from cache, while v$asm_diskgroup rescans all disk headers. This method is also used by Oracle in their Enterprise Manager product.\n\nASM disk header\/superblock backups?[edit]\n\nASM disk headers (superblocks) cannot be backed up and restored in Oracle 10g. By implication, if you use EXTERNAL REDUNDANCY and a single disk's header is accidentally overwritten, the entire disk group will have to be restored. To solve this problem, Oracle introduced the md_backup and md_restore asmcmd commands in Oracle 11g. In Oracle 10g, the only viable method to prevent logical corruption of ASM header block is to add failgroup, storage vendor has no responsibility to verify\/checksum ASM disk header blocks (EXTERNAL REDUNDANCY is not going to help). There is a kfed utility to backup ASM disk headers and restore them for LIMITED scenario. It is best to be executed under guidance of a few elite support engineers. Oracle did not advertise the utility due to the potential damage it could cause. For those unrecoverable (tedious manual fixes) cases, restoring disk group is the last resort.\n\nHow does one create a database directly on ASM?[edit]\n\nThe trick is to create an SPFILE and restart the instance before issuing the CREATE DATABASE statement:\n\nCREATE SPFILE FROM pfile='initorcl_0.ora';\n\nPoint all OMF files into ASM:\n\nALTER SYSTEM SET db_create_file_dest = '+DATA';\nALTER SYSTEM SET db_recovery_file_dest = '+RECOVER';\n\nIssue the create database command:\n\n   character set \"WE8ISO8859P1\"\n   national character set \"AL16UTF16\";",

        "text":"Absolute Computrace: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIn response to numerous requests for comments and clarifications after our presentation at theKaspersky Security Analyst Summit 2014, we have created this FAQ with some answers to the most commonly asked questions.\n\n1. Why did you decide to expand this research after the presentation about Absolute Computrace in 2009?\n\nKaspersky Lab decided to undertake full research on this topic after discovering several privately owned laptops of Kaspersky Lab security researchers had the Computrace agent running without prior authorization. Such unauthorized activations quickly became alarming when our reverse engineering revealed serious vulnerabilities in the Computrace agent protocol design.\n\nAbsolute Software\u2019s\u00a0press release from 2009\u00a0claims that \u201cThe Computrace BIOS module is activated by the installation of Absolute Software by our customers, and is never forced upon any user. Computrace is designed to be activated, deactivated, controlled and managed by the customer using encrypted channels.\u201d\n\nHowever, we found signs of unauthorized activations on our hardware. Our research paper shows that actual versions of Computrace agent still use unencrypted channels. Due to this fact, we were able to conduct a live demo of a hijack of the Computrace agent at the SAS 2014 conference.\n\n2. Did you contact Absolute Computrace before making your research public?\n\nWe notified Absolute Software via email and attached the full research paper draft. Here is a screenshot of the email message sent to Absolute Software on February 3, 2014:\n\n\nLater that day we have received an automatic email from the Absolute Software mail server: \u201cDelivery has failed to these recipients or distribution lists: security@absolute.com\u201d\n\nThere were no other error messages which means that the email should have reached Absolute Software on other addresses in the list, however we have never received a formal response.\n\n3. How recent was the Computrace agent variant you analyzed?\n\nWe analyzed several executables and laptops during the course of this research. The analyzed laptops were brand-new, purchased in 2012 with the top configurations available on the market according to the laptop owners.\n\nThe variant of the Computrace agent we used in our live demo was compiled in 2012:\n\n\n4. How can I detect Computrace on a system?\n\nThe Simplest and most efficient way is to search for rpcnet.exe process in Task Manager or a file with the same name in your C:WindowsSystem32 directory. If found \u2013 you have Computrace activated. For an extended list of Computrace agent activity please see\u00a0Appendix A\u00a0of our research paper.\n\n5. Should non-Windows users worry about unauthorized activations of Computrace?\n\nAs of now, we are not aware of EFI Firmware or BIOS Optional ROMS that have executables for non-Windows platforms, which means that the agent code will not be installed on non-Windows partitions. For details on how the agent is installed from BIOS please see our full\u00a0research paper\n\n6. Does Computrace security issues affect non-Windows platforms?\n\nOur research shows a security flaw in the Computrace agent protocol design which means that theoretically all agents for any platform may be affected. However, we have only confirmed the vulnerability in the Windows agent.\n\nWe are aware of Computrace products for Mac OS X and Android tablets. However, we have not analyzed the protocols they use.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nThere is 1 comment\n  1. davie curry\n\n    Is there a way of removing this or if I force stop on my galaxy s5 will that stop it until I force restart can I ask Samsung to send a new hand set out ?\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Streaming Analytics FAQ: What You Need to Know\n\nImagine two manufacturers\u2014Manufacturer A and Manufacturer B\u2014each competing for its share of the widget market.\n\nEach relies on customer satisfaction and repeat business to succeed. Each has stringent quality control measures in place. But only Manufacturer A captures and analyzes streaming data to help assure quality. Only Manufacturer A has sensors that monitor everything from factory machine health to order fulfillment. Only Manufacturer A has sensor data pass through in-memory analytics queries on the fly, which helps the company find and fix defects before those defects find their way to customers.\n\nWhich of these two manufacturers is likely to have a competitive advantage?\n\nThese benefits of streaming analytics could help your business remain competitive, cut costs, and increase efficiency.\n\nQ: What is streaming analytics?\nStreaming analytics, also called event stream processing, is the analysis of large, in-motion data called event streams. These streams comprise events that occur as the result of an action or set of actions, such as a financial transaction, equipment failure, or some other trigger. These triggers can be very granular, such as something that happens within a system at a point in time\u2014a click, a sensor reading, a tweet or some other measurable activity. The growing number of connected devices\u2014the Internet of Things\u2014will exponentially increase the volume of events that surround business activity. The more data your business generates, the greater your potential benefits from streaming analytics.\n\nSAS Event Stream Processing derives actionable information from these event streams in real time through data manipulation, normalization, cleansing, advanced analytics and pattern-of-interest detection.\n\nQ: Why \"streaming analytics?\" Isn't traditional analytics enough?\nIt doesn't have to be one or the other. Streaming analytics complements traditional analytics by adding real-time insight to your decision-making toolbox. In some circumstances, streaming analytics enables better business decisions by focusing on live, streaming data.\n\nTraditional approaches rely on batch processing, where data is scored based on a schedule and may only process new data hourly, overnight or even weekly. These approaches are inherently reactive because they focus on aging information, which means businesses can only react to past events or conditions. Traditional architectures are limited because they have difficulty efficiently managing and tracking the consumption of event streams.\n\nBy contrast, SAS Event Stream Processing architecture can capture events, assess them, make decisions and share the outputs\u2014all within specific time windows. It enables you to proactively respond to changing conditions, to improve operations, and to enhance customer interactions\u2014all driven by real-time insights.\n\n\nQ: Is streaming analytics right for my business?\nNot all organizations will benefit equally from streaming analytics. To decide whether you need the technology, consider the following:\n\n  1. What data streams do you currently have? Identify applications and devices that generate data in your organization and rank those streams according to importance. For example, think of two data streams at an oil refinery. One is generated by an employee HR portal and one comes from sensors installed on equipment. Because it could affect the refinery's mission as well as human health and safety, the sensor data cries out for real-time analysis while HR data may be a lower priority.\n\n  2. What will real-time analysis on those event streams do for the business? Data streams that are critical to your organization's business are probably good candidates for real-time analysis. Many enterprises find that real-time analysis on business-critical streams enhances their ability to respond to customers, identify market conditions, minimize safety risk and enhance security.\n\nQ: What about open source streaming analytics platforms?\nAs you evaluate open source streaming analytics options, make sure you consider the time to value. Do you have the in-house skill sets needed to get the most from the platform\u2014or do you have the resources to hire workers with those skill sets? Open source analytics solutions often require a great deal of coding to deploy predictive models and to customize them for your environment. Many do not have a visual model building interface, which slows down the time to value, and they all vary on their interpretation of analytics in streams. These limitations can mean that it takes weeks or months for your organization to realize value from an open source platform.\n\nSAS Event Stream Processing is a complete and integrated solution that enables rapid time to value. It provides an interactive GUI for visual model building, while also allowing programmers to write XML or interface through APIs. This capability creates a flexible model-building environment for users, and the SAS publisher\/subscriber interface supports integration of this technology into your business.\n\nQ: What are the next steps?\nYou can get started today by assessing your environment to determine which of your company's data streams contain the most valuable information. Then, click here to learn more about SAS Event Stream Processing and to see it in action.",

        "text":"6. WP version 9\n\n6.1. Isn't WP 9 For Linux (in the WP Office 2000suite) better than WP 8.1?\n\nFew would agree. Its admirers seem to be, well, MS-Windows users, since WP 9 is pretty much the Win32 version recompiled in a Winelib environment, with RAM bloat, stability problems, and other glitches (including DOS drive letters in file dialogues!) that are routine on MS-Windows but not Linux.\n\nVery likely, WP 9 introduced some feature-set attractions, but needing to run emulation code with performance and stability problems seems a poor trade-off. I consider 8.1 vastly preferable.\n\n6.2. Why didn't Corel do WP 9 as a native Linux port?\n\nMy best guess: Doing a Winelib version allowed Corel to leverage its existing Win32 codebase, write a minimum amount of new code, shorten development time, reduce costs, and keep the effort in-house rather than having to hire SD Corp. again.\n\n6.3. Is there anything I can do to maintain or improve WP9 for Linux?\n\nYou can substitute an improved version of Corel's fork of the WINE emulation code (\"Corelwine\"), which was for a while maintained by Michael Torrie, at http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20040213000457\/students.cs.byu.edu\/~torriem\/corelwine\/, with other possibly useful pages at http:\/\/panopticon.csustan.edu\/thood\/corel-wp9.txt and http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20040225112645\/http:\/\/members.chello.at\/hrdisk\/corelwine.html.\n\nI can't guarantee the truth of this account, but I've heard claims that Corel deferred submission of its patches to the WINE Project development team so long that they could no longer be merged when they arrived, leading to inadvertent creation of a separate development fork, dubbed \"Corelwine\". This seems to be the codebase that Torrie maintained, separately from the WINE Project's flagship codebase.\n\nMoreover, Corelwine was built to be dependent on Bitstream, Inc.'s proprietary Fontastic font server, a feature unlikely to be included in the WINE Project code of the day, and now precluded by WINE licensing. (Reportedly -- see post by \"gavriels\" -- Corel decided to use Fontastic to skirt likely font-patent problems, which indeed have subsequently plagued authors of open-source font software.)\n\nThere are also some remaining updates to WP9 \/ WP Office 2000 inside ftp:\/\/ftp.corel.com\/pub\/linux\/Office2000\/updates\/ and ftp:\/\/ftp.corel.com\/pub\/linux\/Graphics9\/updates\/. Among those updates, the revised WP Office 2000 installer available there is essential for most modern Linux distributions to make the Fontastic font server install correctly. Note that you need at least one printer configured before installation. Note that versions of Corelwine available through September 2004 (and thus also WP9) break completely on system with glibc 2.3.2 or above, i.e., essentially all current Linux distributions. Efforts to fix Corelwine are underway. See FAQ section \"WP9 stopped working \/ won't install...\" for details.\n\nBecause online resources for WP9 for Linux (also PhotoPaint9 and the other WP Office 2000 components) have been disappearing, I've been gathering and archiving them inside http:\/\/linuxmafia.com\/pub\/linux\/apps\/. You may find what you need there.\n\n6.4. Where can I find a copy of WP9 \/ WP Office 2000 for Linux?\n\nIt's sometimes available for US $49 from Surplus Computers of Santa Clara, California at http:\/\/www.surpluscomputers.com\/. EMS Professional Software and Consulting, http:\/\/www.emsps.com\/oldtools\/wp.htm, sometimes has the Deluxe Edition. (Inquire for pricing.) Both editions (Standard and Deluxe) of WP Office 2000 for Linux are frequently offered on eBay.",

        "text":"Is VisualARQ a McNeel Product?\nVisualARQ has been developed by Asuni CAD, a company specialized in software development and distribution for architectural design, engineering, landscaping and industrial design. Based in Barcelona, Asuni CAD and McNeel Europe belong to the same company group, working in close collaboration with this and other projects.\nWhat kind of program is VisualARQ?\nVisualARQ is a plug-in designed for a sector of the architectural market. It allows you to work within Rhino\u2019s interface, providing specific tools to create\/edit architectural plans, and to work with parametric 3D Objects -such as walls, doors, windows, columns, slabs, roofs, stairs and railings- making the architectural design process and its documentation much easier to handle.\nWhat are the main values VisualARQ provides to its users?\n  \u2022 Complex architectural projects\u00a0modeling in 3D and 2D in an easy and fast way.\n  \u2022 A full library of 3D paremetric architectural objects, customizable and editable anytime.\n  \u2022 Easy editing\u00a0and automatic update of\u00a0all the 2D document drawings, which are attached to the 3D model.\n  \u2022 Import and export of IFC 2\u00d73 files, in order to exchange 3D models between Rhino and other BIM plaftorms such as Revit, ArchiCAD, Solibri or Tekla Bimsight.\n  \u2022 The dynamic section tool, which allows to work with\u00a0real-time section views.\n  \u2022 An affordable price. VisualARQ\u00a0plus Rhino makes a very affordable and competitive 2D\/3D architectural package solution compared to\u00a0related products in the market.\n  \u2022 Free technical support and constant development based on the users\u2019 needs and requests.\nWho is VisualARQ aimed at?\n\nVisualARQ is aimed at architects, interior designers, engineers, constructors, urban planners, renderers, and architecture professionals. It is even useful for product designers in the marine design industry.\nIn general, it can be a very useful tool for any Rhino user interested in architectural modeling or wishing to obtain technical drawings from their designs in a fast way.\n\nUseful features regarding professional profiles.\n\nIs VisualARQ based on BIM (Building Information Modeler)?\nYes. VisualARQ has a set of parametric architectural objects and tools, that make design and documentation processes easier and faster. All project documentation (plans, sections, elevations, schedule tables for room areas, openings quantifications, etc) is attached to the 3D model and is updated automatically at any change on the 3D model. In addition, VisualARQ provides the option to import & Export IFC files, which is the the standard file format of exchanging objects in the building industry.\n\n\nIs VisualARQ available in other languages?\nVisualARQ is available in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Czech, Korean and Chinese simplified. The Help is also available in Japanese.\nDoes VisualARQ support Windows 8?\nYes, VisualARQ supports Windows 8 and later upgrades. If you experience any problem after upgrading Windows, uninstall VisualARQ and reinstall it.\nWhen will be VisualARQ compatible with Rhino for MAC?\nWe certainly are very interested in developing a VisualARQ version for Rhino for Mac, but we won\u2019t be able to work on it until Rhino for Mac supports third party plug-ins written in C++, as VisualARQ was developed using that language. Once Rhino for Mac supports those kind of third party plug-ins, our development team will be able to determine how much work\/time we need for adapting VisualARQ to Rhino for Mac. More information about Rhino for MAC:\n\n\nHow can I upgrade from VisualARQ 1 to VisualARQ 2?\nIf you own a VisualARQ 1 license, you can upgrade to VisualARQ 2 for free. Download the last VisualARQ 2 update from the website ( and use your VisualARQ 1 license to fill the download form. You will receive by e-mail the download links and your VisualARQ 2 license key (starting with VA20-\u2026). After installing VisualARQ 2, run the vaLicense command, select the Standalone option, and validate VisualARQ with your VisualARQ 2 license key.\nWhich are the VisualARQ license modes?\nIs the evaluation version fully functional?\nYes, it is. After the 30-day trial you can still use VisualARQ, but some features are disabled:\n\n  \u2022 VisualARQ objects and styles are no longer saved.\n  \u2022 Copy, paste and explode commands for VisualARQ objects are disabled.\n  \u2022 Style import\/export commands are disabled.\n  \u2022 IFC import and export are disabled.\nDoes VisualARQ support floating licenses?\nYes, it does. VisualARQ supports floating licenses using Cloud Zoo, or the Rhino Zoo, both free services of McNeel. Learn more about License modes here.\nCan I use a single VisualARQ license in different machines?\nYou can install VisualARQ in different machines. But a single VisualARQ license can only run in one machine simultaneously.\n\n\nIs it possible to import and export VisualARQ documents from and into AutoCAD?\n  \u2022 Import from AutoCAD: Yes. Since Rhino can read .dwg files, VisualARQ can work with them as well.\u00a0It is therefore\u00a0possible to start modeling a project in 3D using the 2D drawings imported from AutoCAD. VisualARQ can convert 2D lines into 3D walls, railings, beams, slabs\u2026.\n  \u2022 Export into AutoCAD: Yes. Once the 2D documentation drawings of a 3D model are generated in VisualARQ, it is possible to export them into AutoCAD. You just need to save the document as a .dwg file, and keep on working with the file in AutoCAD. This tip gives more information about how to do it.\nIs it possible to dimension from the plug-in?\nYes, there is a command to create automatic walls and openings dimensions from the 3D model. In addition, Rhino provides a set of drafting tools for the rest of the 3D model dimensioning and documentation.\nIs it possible to render from the plug-in?\nVisualARQ provides a material manager which supports materials of all render engines that are supported by Rhino (Rhino render, V-Ray, Flamingo nXt, Maxwell, etc\u2026). This tip gives more information of how to assign materials to VisualARQ objects.\nHow does VisualARQ help to exchange Rhino models with Revit?\n\nVisualARQ includes a built-in IFC import and export plug-in, which makes it possible to exchange IFC 2\u00d73 files between Rhino and Revit (as well as with other AEC software packages).\n\nVisualARQ adds the ifc Tag feature that lets you assign any IFC category to any Rhino object (ifcWall, ifcBeam, etc\u2026), that will be recognized as generic objects in Revit with data.\n(Check it out how it works in this video).\n\nAfter exporting a Rhino model through IFC, all VisualARQ objects are recognized in Revit as native architectural objects or generic objects, depending on the object type and how they have been created in Rhino.\nCheck this guide to learn how each object is recognized in Revit through IFC.\n\nIn addition to the ifc Tag, VisualARQ adds the option to create new custom parameters, and feed the geometry with information. This data can be assigned to geometry through the VisualARQ Grasshopper components. These new parameters are exported to IFC as ifc Properties, that Revit can read.\n\nHow does VisualARQ integrate with Grasshopper? Is it easy to learn?\nVisualARQ integrates with Grasshopper in two different ways:\n\n  \u2022 VisualARQ Grasshopper Components: they are the VisualARQ objects and commands available from Grasshopper. They let you automate workflows in Grasshopper using VisualARQ objects and commands. You can also add data and obtain data to geometry and connect VisualARQ with other add-ons for Grasshopper, for multiple purposes within the Grassshopper environment.\n  \u2022 Grasshopper styles: they are VisualARQ objects created from Grasshopper definitions. You define the custom parametric object in Grasshopper and turn it into a VisualARQ object style. Once the new object style is created you can work with it and change its parameters in Rhino as any other VisualARQ object. At this point no Grasshopper knowledge is required, although Grasshopper is running in the background. You can find and download some examples in food4Rhino.\n\nIs it easy to learn?\nIf you are familiar with Grasshopper, you will find it very easy to work with the VisualARQ Grasshopper components or create new custom objects from Grasshopper definitions. If you are not, there are useful material to learn from scratch how to use VisualARQ with Grasshopper:",

It usually happens after a part where the music is building-up to this moment by adding complexity.\n\nThe Beat Drop is the part where the crowd goes crazy, letting go of the energy that accumulated inside them during the build-up part.\n\nA VJ needs to visualize this change and should never miss a Beat Drop. (unless intentionally)\n\nA video codec is software that compresses or decompresses digital video. \u201cCodec\u201d is a concatenation of \u201cencoder\u201d and \u201cdecoder\u201d\n\nThe DXV Video Codec is a hardware (GPU) accelerated codec. The decompression of the video frames is done directly on the video card. This enables much\u00a0higher resolutions and frame-rates with much lower CPU and RAM usage.\n\nThe DXV codec can also store an Alpha Channel. This is essential for preserving transparency in complex video compositions, freeing you from the need of using Blending Modes in order to compose clips on top of other clips thus making your output look cleaner & sharper.\u00a0\n\nSupported Software: Resolume & Grand VJ\n\nVisualizing Music and Amazing the Crowds, of course!\n\nYour question is not answered?\n\nDo you have a question that you think should be here but is missing?
