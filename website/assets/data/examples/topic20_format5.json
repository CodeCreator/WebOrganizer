Group administrators can choose to show or hide resources, wiki pages, and discussion topics at any time.\n\nPrivate groups are not listed anywhere on the site. You can join them only by invitation.\n\nHow do I make a public group private? And vice-versa?\n\nIf you are an administrator, go to your Groups page and select the group. Select \"Edit\" on the lower right. Go to Privacy toward the bottom. Click \"private\" and save.\n\nInstructions are the same for making a private group public except click \"public\" under the privacy section.\n\nHow are groups managed?\n\nWhen you create a group, you are automatically made its first manager. As manager, you can also promote members to help you run the group.\n\nA group manager can:\n\n  1. Create group participation rules\n  2. Promote\/demote members and approve\/deny membership requests.\n  3. Modify information about the group\n    \u2022 Create or change the group name\n    \u2022 Create or change the group description\n    \u2022 Associate the group with an external URL\n    \u2022 Determine whether or not your group wiki pages, resources, and discussion topics can be viewed by non-members.\n    \u2022 Moderate group discussions\n\nThere's no upper limit on the number of managers a group can have, but a group must have at least one manager at all times.\n\nYou can read about keeping your group happy on the Tips for Running Your Group page.\n\nWho can see resources\/wiki pages\/discussions in a group?\n\nAdding a photo to a group pool allows any group member to view your photo and add notes, tags, and comments, regardless of the photo's privacy setting.\n\nYour photo retains the privacy settings you set for anyone who isn't a group member. It also stays in your photostream, available to everyone who can view it. You (or a group administrator) can remove your photo from the pool at any time.\n\nHow do I leave a group?\n\nGo to your Groups tab on your members page and select the group you'd like to leave. On the right-hand side, there's a link labelled 'cancel'. Click this and you'll be taken to a page where you can leave the group.\n\nGo to the Groups page and search or browse for the group you'd like to leave. On the right-hand side, there's a link labelled 'cancel'. Click this and you'll be taken to a page where you can leave the group.\n\nHow do I delete a group?\n\nThe only way to delete a group is to leave the group as the last remaining member. But you can quit the group (described above).\n\nA group can't be deleted if it has more than one member.\n\nReturn to the main groups page.\n\n0 Dislike\n\nLast updated\n\nComments on this entry\n\nThere are no comments on this entry.\n\nPost a comment\n\nPost a comment\n\nComments are closed on this entry.\n\nPlease keep comments relevant to this entry.

Each log viewer in a diagram file triggers the creation of a \"Log Plotter\" page, and the pointers of all the created pages are stored in a global array which has a limit of 60. When opening a diagram that includes more than 60 data log viewers, the limit of this array is reached and the error dialog is displayed.\n\nThe workaround is to reduce the number of Data Log viewers contained in a single diagram.\n\nThis is problem in all ION Enterprise releases up to and including ION Enterprise 6.0 Service Pack 1.\n\nThere is a hot fix available for this problem for ION Enterprise 6.0 SP1 only. Contact Technical Support if it is required.\n\nLast Updated: May 20, 2011\nAll content \u00a9 1992-2011 Schneider Electric\n\nLegacy KB System (APS) Data: RESL200456 V2.0, Originally authored by DaMi on 11\/10\/2009, Last Edited by JaMc on 05\/21\/2011\nRelated ranges: ION Enterprise V6.0, ION Enterprise V5.6, ION Enterprise V5.5, ION Enterprise V5.0, ION Enterprise V4.5, ION Enterprise V4.0\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nWhat can we do to improve the information ?\n\nCan't find what you are looking for?\n\nReach out to our customer care team to receive information on technical support, assistance for complaints and more.",
