        "text":"How do I know whether Taken In Hand is right for me?\n\nHow do I know whether Taken In Hand is right for me?\n\nA Taken In Hand relationship is a fully-committed wholehearted sexually exclusive marriage in which, to the delight of both spouses, the man actively controls the woman. The degree of control and the way the husband retains control vary from Taken In Hand couple to Taken In Hand couple, but in all cases both husband and wife actively want the husband to have the upper hand. No matter how strong, tough and forceful a Taken In Hand wife may be, and no matter how hard she might try to take control in their marriage, she would be aghast if her husband were to let her get the upper hand. Likewise, no matter how loving, kind and considerate the husband may be, he prefers to keep his wife firmly in hand.\n\nThe husband in the relationship has a lot of power over his wife by virtue of his position at the one who is in charge. Being a good person, he wants to do no harm, so he takes care to put his wife and the relationship first.\n\nDo you really want this kind of relationship? If you don't, it is not right for you.\n\nDoes your spouse want this kind of relationship? If not, then unless he or she changes his or her mind (and that often does happen) it is not right for you.\n\nDoes it sound like a burden or a duty to you or to your spouse? Then it is not right for you.\n\nAre you a person who takes responsibility for your own actions, or are you a person who blames others for your problems? If you are hypercritical, angry, hyperemotional, spiteful, grudge-bearing, vengeful, defensive or tend to place blame or feel victimised, Taken In Hand is not right for you. It requires a certain maturity, kindheartedness, and the ability to forgive and let past problems go. Whether you are a man or a woman, you need to be actively aware that you are a fallible human being, and that all human beings are fallible including your spouse. It is essential that you understand that there will be mistakes, and that that does not mean that your spouse is a bad person. If either you do not or your spouse does not meet these criteria, Taken In Hand is not right for you.\n\nDo you and your spouse each have the ability to trust the other and be vulnerable with each other, or is one or other of you a bit paranoid or distrustful? If you are the man, do you feel absolutely sure that your wife would never under any circumstances violate your trust in her by, for example, accusing you of abuse? If you are the woman, do you feel safe with your husband? Are you absolutely sure that he would never intentionally injure you or abuse you in any way? Do you each feel sure of the good character of the other? This is really very important.\n\nHow do you and your spouse each and jointly handle change? Change is stressful, even good changes. Changing your relationship in this way is a big change in most cases, and there can be all sorts of unintended consequences and unexpected events and emotions. If one or both of you is not good at handling change, Taken In Hand may not be right for you.\n\nHow have the two of you handled disagreements or incompatibilities in the past? Have you more often than not managed to handle difficulties well? Have you generally turned towards each other or have you been unable to adapt to each other? In moving your relationship in a Taken In Hand direction, you are likely to find that you will each have a different idea of what you want, and the two of you need to be able to create a path that you both like, rather than sticking rigidly to your first idea of how to proceed, otherwise Taken In Hand is not for you.\n\nWhether you are the man or the woman in a potential Taken In Hand relationship, if to you Taken In Hand feels like a burden, it is not for you. It needs to be something you positively want, something that you think will give you pleasure and joy and passion and peace. There must be something in it for you as well as for your spouse.\n\nSee also:\nAn overview of Taken In Hand\nCould this kind of relationship be for you?\nDo you have a commanding presence?\nCan you be in charge without turning into her mother?\nConsent makes all the difference in the world\nThe importance of conquest\nA woman must know that her man cares\nConsent, control, connection\nBarbie is the doll, Ken is just an accessory.\nThe resistant woman\nEquality isn't all it's cracked up to be\n\nprevious | FAQ index | next\n\nTaken In Hand Tour start | next\n\n[This is an answer to a frequently-asked question: this page is part of the FAQ. Please try to ensure that your post is answering the question or discussing the above post. The question is: How do I know whether Taken In Hand is right for me?]\n\n\nIs Taken in Hand Right for You?\n\nMy answer to this question would be, if you are in frequent power struggles, spend hours out of weekends in a silent treatment with the man you absolutely adore, find yourself swearing at your man, and wishing you could just get along, Taken in Hand may be what you are looking for.\n\nIf you wonder why there is a constant feeling that something is wrong or once again you have made another mistake, maybe it is your relationship roles. Perhaps having your man in charge and making the calls in your home life would make you feel cared for and secure. Especially if you admire strong men who can take charge.\n\nMaybe you would like to feel more feminine and appreciate his masculinity more. Maybe you don't care about his feminine side and whether or not it surfaces.\n\nMaybe you are a competent capable intelligent woman but you want to be Taken in Hand and you want a dominant man in your life.\n\nAsk yourself some of these questions without worrying if it is politically correct. Give yourself an honest answer about what would really make you happy and if Taken In Hand would make you happy this may be the relationship style for you.",

        "text":"\ufeff FAQ's - Driven Woman\n\nDriven Woman FAQ\n\nStill not sure? Maybe we can answer your questions below:\n\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s right for me\nIf you like the idea but are not quite sure, then we suggest you sign up for 6 months and give it a try. There\u2019s no risk. If you feel it\u2019s not for you after couple of sessions (up to three), we will refund you the remaining membership fee.\n\nSounds great, but I don\u2019t have enough time\nMost members say doing this process actually creates more time for you. This happens because you are forced to monthly evaluate your priorities and focus on things that will have a bigger impact on your success, finances and\/or happiness. We regularly do time management related exercises in the groups and getting more out of your day is a constant topic we discuss and practice.\n\nIdeally we all dream about and work towards working less and earning more! Filling up your day with things to do is not difficult, what requires focus is to do things that actually matter\n\nI'm looking for a group to help me progress in my business and don't want to be distracted from my important entrepreneurial goals\nDrivenWoman member meetings help you work on your life so that you make your life work for you. Success in business is very often linked to our mindset. And many of our members can contest that when they start focusing regularly on their mindset and are challenged by the other members in the monthly group meetings, they start to experience positive shifts in their business goals.\n\nHere are a few examples of members who\u2019ve experienced positive change in their business goals as Driven Women members\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of money to spend on myself, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it\nOur members sometimes compare it to their monthly gym membership in terms of cost. But more importantly, have you made the change you want to see in your life already?\n\nIf not, then maybe the DrivenWoman network and structured approach will work for you. We know that when you pay, you pay attention and take action. Free groups are great for motivation and inspiration but do little to move you towards your goals consistently. Networking is wonderful for meeting like-minded women and building relationships and friendships, but often these become a business card swopathon.\n\nWhen you join Driven Woman you will start taking active steps and moving forwards to achieve what you want. It\u2019s about being ready to accept that we have to step outside of our comfort zone and that can be painful. Together we can help each other to overcome it. Instead of feeling isolated and frustrated we keep moving forward, encouraging each other, and slowly, step-by-step, our life starts to turn around.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I can make it every month \u2013 can I still join when possible?\nThe meetings act as a commitment point for you to become more efficient and make progress. You have an appointment with yourself and you won\u2019t be skipping it! People tell us they are not simply executing their to-do list anymore. But it only works if everyone in the group is committed (We do understand there may be occasions when something urgent\/important comes up).\n\nYour membership is for the time duration you selected rather than the number of sessions and if you do miss a session, you are not entitled to a refund or able to attend another session. However there is no risk, if you feel it\u2019s not for you after a couple of sessions (up to three), we will refund you the remaining membership fee.\n\nHow many people in each group?\nThere are a maximum of 15 people (including the group leaders) in each group. We split up into 2 or 3 smaller groups for the exercises so that everyone has plenty of time to participate comfortably.\n\nHow much is it to join?\nYou can\u00a0join for a minimum of 6 months and pay in 6 or 12 month instalments. Prices vary per country and you can see the price here. The fee covers the attendance to the Monthly Members\u2019 Meetings and 25% discount on other DrivenWoman events. Click here to find the price of your local group.\n\nWhen and where are the meetings?\nYou can find all the group details here.\n\nHow long is each session?\nMeetings last 2 hours each. We ask that you arrive 15 minutes before the official kick off time so you can informally network and settle for a prompt start.\n\nYes, I\u2019m ready to join, what do I do next?\nClick here to find your nearest group and sign up!",

Your case manager will also be available to help you with your adoption plan. It\u2019s important that you feel well and strong, so you\u2019ll take care of yourself by seeing your doctor regularly.

Your adoptive family will come to the hospital to meet you. If you need a ride to the hospital, we can make prior arrangements for you. After the baby is born, you will most likely remain in the hospital for 12-24 hours. The hospital social worker will meet with you to sign the birth certificate and any hospital forms. If you don\u2019t have a ride home, we\u2019ll arrange it. The baby will go home with the adopting parents right from the hospital.\n\nOther questions?\n\nPlease call us now at 207-467-8110, or send us a message.",
