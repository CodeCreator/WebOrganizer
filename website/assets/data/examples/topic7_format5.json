        "text":"WooPlus Blog\n\nWooPlus is still new to the dating app scene, and you may have questions about things you have seen on the website on in the app, so we have done our best to answer them all for you below! Hopefully, this makes your WooPlus experience even better.\n\nWhat\u2019s a BBW\/SSBBW?\n\nBBW is a shorthand term for women that are big and beautiful. It is used to identify any women who are bigger. BBW range from being just a little curvy to chubby to obese. SSBBW is essentially the same thing, with the added \u201csuper-sized.\u201d In this case, the women are significantly more obese. While some of these BBW and SSBBW maybe be what are known as feedees, others are bigger due to health conditions, genetics, or a similar problem. Usually, BBW\/SSBBW struggle when it comes to dating because they are subjected to a lot of ridicule. But, we will not stand for that here. These women are all beautiful and deserve the same dating experience as anyone else.\n\nWhat\u2019s a BHM\/SSBHM?\n\nYou cannot have BBW\/SSBBW and leave out the men! BHM is the shorthand term that refers to straight or bisexual men who are, of course, big and handsome. Like with women, they can range from just a little chubby to obese in size. There are also the Super-Sized Big Handsome Men (SSBHM), which refers to men who are significantly obese. Like with the women, a man may be bigger due to being a feedee, or due to any other number of problems that may be out of their control. Like with BBW\/SSBBW, many BHM\/SSBHM struggle when it comes to dating, because they encounter women who are not interested in dating a bigger man. But, that ends now, with WooPlus!\n\nWhat is a fat admirer? What is a feeder? What are the differences between them?\n\nThere is a lot of confusion about fat admirers and feeders. Fat admirers, or FAs, are people that are attracted to BBW\/SSBBW or BHM\/SSBHM. Admirers are interested in either dating and having a relationship with BBW and BHM, and find them to be beautiful and handsome just as they are. For them, the fact that the person is chubby, curvy, or even thick does not take away from how beautiful they are at all- but they also do not necessarily want to see them continue to grow like a feeder would.\n\nFeeders, on the other hand, are people that enjoy helping another get bigger. They will be interesting in cooking for feedees, encouraging them to continue eating, and sometimes- consensually- forcing them to eat more. This kind of relation can be sexual, romantic and lead to dating, or a mix.\n\nWhat's a feedee and what are the differences between a feedee and a BBW\/BHM?\n\nA feedee is a term used to refer to men and women who like the feel of their bodies growing and getting bigger. They have a choice when it comes to their size, and can stop or reverse the gaining whenever they want. Meaning, if they want to stop once they have gotten to the point of being chubby, they can. Feedees wholly believe that being big is something incredibly sexy and positive. Feedees are also part of the feederism kink, which is largely based on playing out one\u2019s sexual fantasies.\n\nOn the other hand, BBW and BHM being fat or thick is not necessarily the point of their sexual desire. In many cases, their size is out of their control; be it due to health problems or genetics. Usually, they do not actually find their size to be \u201csexy,\u201d but they also do not completely dismiss it. While they do not always choose it, BBW and BHM can still own up to their bodies and embrace them to find happiness in life and dating.\n\nWhat is a fat fetish? What is feederism? What are WooPlus\u2019 attitudes toward them?\n\nUnlike fat admirers, people with a fat fetish tend to sexualize plus-size partners rather than actually treating them like a person. It is more than just a kink, and it can make men and women feel extremely uncomfortable and undervalued, which is what makes dating so hard for thick, chubby, or other sized BBW and BHM.\n\nFeederism is a kink that falls on the fat admirers spectrum and, therefore, features more of a sexual nature. But, unlike a fat fetish, feeders find their feedees to be beautiful no matter what. Feederism can be very sexual in nature, but it can also be romantic and pull two people interested in feederism into the dating scene.\n\nWooPlus has a strict anti-fetish policy. Anyone seen violating this policy will have their accounts permanently removed. Their goal is to offer a safe, comfortable dating environment for big, beautiful women and big handsome men and their admirers.\n\nHow can I know more about the advantages of dating a curvy woman or a big guy?\n\nWhile we could answer this for you, what we find to be advantages may be different from what you could consider advantageous. So, why not find out yourself? WooPlus has a constantly growing dating community of every body type, including chubby, curvy, and those thick BBW and BHM. Join WooPlus\u2019s dating community, and find out how amazing these BBW and BHM can be.",

        "text":"How can I contact a counselor?\n\nYou can email us\u00a0pregnant@awaa.org, call our main office at 800-429-3369, or call or text us anytime on our 24 hour help line in Virginia or Maryland at 703-346-4921.\n\nI want to come for counseling but I have no transportation to get to your office. Can you still help me?\n\nYes, a counselor can meet you at your home, restaurant, or another location close to you where you can talk privately. We can also help you with transportation if you would rather come to our offices. We serve the states of Virginia and Maryland and can meet with you near your home.\n\nDoes it cost me anything to talk with a counselor or to make an adoption plan?\n\nNo, there is no charge to you for counseling or other services.\n\nDo I have to choose the adoptive parents or meet them?\n\nNo. Your America World counselor can talk with you about what qualities you would like in the adoptive family and can select the parents for you. You do not have to meet the family, but you can change your mind about that later.\n\nPeople ask me how I can carry a child for nine months and then go through with adoption. They make me feel like I am a bad mother\n\nAs you know, there is so much more to being a parent than giving birth to a child. A good mother wants to take care of her child in the best way that she can. For some women, that may be adoption. Adoption does not mean that you are no longer your child\u2019s mother. You will always be your child\u2019s mother but in a different way. You will be your child\u2019s birthmother.\n\n\"Do not merely look out for your own interests, but also the interests of others.\" Philippians 2:4\n\nI am worried that it will be too hard for me to say good bye to my baby at the hospital. Will I feel too sad to go through with my plan of adoption?\n\nIt is normal to feel sad after the baby is born. Feeling sad does not mean that you have made the wrong decision. Important decisions are often hard decisions. When you look at what is best for your child first then look at what is best for you, it can help you feel less confused. Adoption means that you have put what is best for your child before your own feelings.\n\nMy family and friends are pressuring me to parent my child.\n\nYour family and friends are important in your life. You are your child\u2019s parent and it is your responsibility to provide for your child or make sure that your child is provided for the best way that you can. Only you can decide what is best for yourself and your child. If family and friends are offering to provide help to you, it is important to ask yourself if they can be counted on to be there to help you in the long run. Sometimes people mean well in their offer to help but have their own life struggles that keep them from being able to help you as they promised.\n\nIs it ever too late to decide on adoption?\n\nNo, it is never too late. Some women feel comforted in careful planning throughout their pregnancies, but others may put off facing a difficult decision. We can meet with you to help you in your decision whether you are one month into your pregnancy, currently in the hospital following the birth of your child, had your baby six months ago and feel overwhelmed, or any time you feel you want to talk about an adoption plan for your child.\n\nWhat about the father of my baby? I feel that I want to consider adoption but the father of my baby says no. What can I do?\n\nOur counselor can help you talk with the father of your baby about plans for the baby\u2019s future. He may not be ready to be a father or be able to provide for his child, but it is hard for him to talk about it. There is a lot of information out there about adoption that isn\u2019t true or accurate. It may help for him to have a chance to have his questions answered.",

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nRetrouvaille is faithful to the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s teaching that marriage is a covenant that exists between one man and one woman. Any reference to marriage or couple made by Retrouvaille is in this context.\n\nIt is for couples in troubled marriages including separated or divorced couples who want their marriages to work. \u00a0Many couples have experienced challenging issues such as infidelity, addiction recovery, long-term illness, blended family\/parenting challenges, long distance relationships, in-law\/family issues, financial hardship, or may have grown apart from each other. Many couples are facing the challenges of being newly married, while others may have been married for many years. \u00a0A willingness to work on your marriage is the primary requirement. Both husband and wife are required to attend the program.\n\nThe Retrouvaille program is a three-phase program.\u00a0\n\nThe first phase is a Weekend Program held in a retreat center or hotel where presenting couples share the breakdown of their own marriages and the tools they have learned to improve communication and restore intimacy.\u00a0\n\nThe second phase consists of a series of 2-hour post-session presentations spread out over 6 to 12 meetings, depending on the community. These post-sessions are critical in assisting struggling couples in healing and rebuilding a new foundation based on love, respect and communication.\n\nThe third phase consists of on-going monthly small group support meetings, called CORE (Continuing Our Retrouvaille Experience), to keep your marriage on track.\u00a0\n\nRetrouvaille is a non-profit ministry and there are no paid positions to organize the program. The costs involved to put on the program include: the rental of a retreat center or hotel rooms, meals, workbooks and materials, rental fees for meeting space, insurance, advertising, telephone expense and the typical administrative costs any ministry would incur. There is no pre-set fee, as costs are site specific and determined by the number of couples attending each program.\n\nTo help cover these costs, each community asks for a small non-refundable registration fee up front to reserve your spot and a voluntary donation on the weekend. You may contact a community nearby to determine their registration fee and projected weekend donation amount.\n\nDuring the weekend, couples are apprised of the full cost of the weekend, and are asked to make a\u00a0voluntary donation that covers the cost of their portion of weekend accommodations, meals, and materials for the weekend and post sessions. A good estimate of this cost can be provided by the community\u2019s registration team at registration. A receipt is provided, as a portion of the donation may be tax deductible, under the extent of the law.\n\nPrivacy is paramount for us. Our attending couple\u2019s names are not shared with any other organizations, parties, or individuals outside the Retrouvaille Community for any reason whatsoever. In fact, only your first name will be used throughout the weekend. Sharing anything more than this will be completely up to you.\n\nNo, personal sharing is not required. The program is not a retreat or counseling environment. There are no group dynamics or group discussions on the weekend. The entire experience is between you and your spouse. The focus is not on the details of your marriage, but rather to get you and your spouse communicating again in a meaningful way to help you heal and rediscover the love you once shared in a way that can be sustained.\n\nMost people who divorce their spouse would say \u201cI just don\u2019t love him or her anymore.\u201d They think this means that love has ended. What it really means is that the romantic version of love that attracted the two of you to each other in the beginning has ended.\n\nThe romance stage of almost every marriage relationships will end at some point as the relationship grows and transitions. If they are being honest, people in wonderful marriages will admit that they just don\u2019t live in romantic bliss forever, but rather go through hot and cold periods during the course of the relationship.\n\nIn strong marriages, the romance stage of the marriage transitions to a more mature, deeper type of love. Some couples are able to do this naturally, but most struggle with disillusionment and misery for far too long before seeking help.\n\nCouples come to the Retrouvaille program specifically because they have been unable to transition to this mature, deeper type of love. A very specific form of communication is taught in the program that will help you make that transition, even if things seem desperate.\n\nThis is extremely common for one spouse to be more disillusioned with the marriage than the other. You may be confident that issue will be thoroughly addressed during the weekend.\n\nPlease do your best to convince your spouse to understand the value in attending. You have already invested a great deal of time and energy in your marriage, so giving a weekend of your time is a small investment. Try to assure them that there is nothing to lose by attending, only positive results for your marriage. If possible, print out some information from this website, or get them to read it online. You may also want to contact the local registration couple for your community nearby for ideas. The program is designed for both husband and wife to attend. More info on this topic can be found by clicking here.\n\nOnly the two of you can save your marriage. Retrouvaille will teach you a set of skills that, if used properly, will help you get on the right track. We ask that you show up with the mindset that you want to work on your relationship. You will need to put forth the effort, and leave the past in the past as you focus on the future.\n\nWhat we do know is that attending the Retrouvaille is very effective for improving marriages. More than three out of four couples attending the program are still married at the five-year mark and are enjoying a more fulfilling and loving relationship. This includes couples that were divorced, separated, and had extremely challenging circumstances.\n\nIt is recommended, but not necessary. Often, couples will travel to attend the soonest available weekend, regardless of where it is located .\n\nIf you attend a weekend that is located far from your home and do not have a local community nearby to support you for your Post Sessions, please make an effort on your weekend to get information regarding online Post Sessions.\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to provide childcare services for the weekends. However,\u00a0some\u00a0communities do offer childcare for the Post Sessions and\/or CORE (Continuing Our Retrouvaille Experience) monthly small group meetings.\n\nThe weekend is a time that requires deep focus between you and your spouse. Much of this time will be in the privacy of your room. Any distractions would completely change the nature of the program for you, so we ask that you do all you can to find someone to watch your children and allow you to completely focus on your relationship during the weekend.\n\nChildren can be deeply affected by parents in a struggling marriage and will appreciate the growth and positive changes to your marriage and family life that they will be able to see from your attendance.\n\nNo. We do not provide professional counselors in the Retrouvaille Program. If you believe you need to consult a professional for your issues, most communities have a referral list of local counselors. Many marriage counselors suggest Retrouvaille as part of the counseling process.\n\nIt is saddening to know that many couples don't know about Retrouvaille. We often say it is the best kept secret for marriage and there may be several reasons for it.\n\n  \u2022 Retrouvaille is a grass-roots, non-profit program. As a non-profit orgabnization, we simply do not have large advertising budgets the way for-profit companies do. Most people that attend Retrouvaille have heard about it from a referral or online search.\n  \u2022 Many people do not seek out Retrouvaille until their marriage is in serious trouble. So when they initially have problems, many seek out traditional marriage counselors, or they try to work out their own problems before they seek out the Retrouvaille Program.\n  \u2022 People tend to talk about their successes, not their failures. Most of us do not like to discuss marital problems. Some people perceive marriage-help programs as a sign of failure. Therefore, no matter what program they participate in, it\u2019s not something they want to talk about. In fact, it is very common that couples that attend Retrouvaille end up learning of other friends and family that have done the same, but never said anything.\n\nPlease dress comfortably and casually. We want you to feel comfortable so you can focus on saving your marriage. However, keep in mind that some venues may get chilly when the air conditioning is on, so you may want to bring a sweater, pullover, or light jacket. That said, we do ask that couples refrain from wearing any clothing that may be a distraction to other couples. This includes provocative clothing, or any clothing that promotes specific causes or political beliefs.\n\nFirst, you will need to Register for a weekend program. Once you complete the registration process, you will be contacted by the Registration Couple from the community where you will be attending the weekend. They will give you a short briefing about the expectations, and answer any questions you may have about the program.\n\nEach community has a dedicated Registration Couple that handles all questions related the Retrouvaille Program in their community. You simply select your most nearby community or the community that has the soonest upcoming weekend near you. You will see a contact phone number for the community there. They will be able to assist you with all of the details about the program, registration information, directions, and any special dietary needs you may have.\n\nIf you can read an English newspaper or watch a n...

As your delivery date approaches, you\u2019ll meet with an attorney or social worker to go over the paperwork you will sign when the baby is born.\n\nWhat happens at the hospital?\n\nWhen you go into labor, you will call your case manager and your adoptive family. Your adoptive family will come to the hospital to meet you. If you need a ride to the hospital, we can make prior arrangements for you. After the baby is born, you will most likely remain in the hospital for 12-24 hours. The hospital social worker will meet with you to sign the birth certificate and any hospital forms. If you don\u2019t have a ride home, we\u2019ll arrange it. The baby will go home with the adopting parents right from the hospital.\n\nOther questions?\n\nPlease call us now at 207-467-8110, or send us a message.",

        "text":"How do I know whether Taken In Hand is right for me?\n\nHow do I know whether Taken In Hand is right for me?\n\nA Taken In Hand relationship is a fully-committed wholehearted sexually exclusive marriage in which, to the delight of both spouses, the man actively controls the woman. The degree of control and the way the husband retains control vary from Taken In Hand couple to Taken In Hand couple, but in all cases both husband and wife actively want the husband to have the upper hand. No matter how strong, tough and forceful a Taken In Hand wife may be, and no matter how hard she might try to take control in their marriage, she would be aghast if her husband were to let her get the upper hand. Likewise, no matter how loving, kind and considerate the husband may be, he prefers to keep his wife firmly in hand.\n\nThe husband in the relationship has a lot of power over his wife by virtue of his position at the one who is in charge. Being a good person, he wants to do no harm, so he takes care to put his wife and the relationship first.\n\nDo you really want this kind of relationship? If you don't, it is not right for you.\n\nDoes your spouse want this kind of relationship? If not, then unless he or she changes his or her mind (and that often does happen) it is not right for you.\n\nDoes it sound like a burden or a duty to you or to your spouse? Then it is not right for you.\n\nAre you a person who takes responsibility for your own actions, or are you a person who blames others for your problems? If you are hypercritical, angry, hyperemotional, spiteful, grudge-bearing, vengeful, defensive or tend to place blame or feel victimised, Taken In Hand is not right for you. It requires a certain maturity, kindheartedness, and the ability to forgive and let past problems go. Whether you are a man or a woman, you need to be actively aware that you are a fallible human being, and that all human beings are fallible including your spouse. It is essential that you understand that there will be mistakes, and that that does not mean that your spouse is a bad person. If either you do not or your spouse does not meet these criteria, Taken In Hand is not right for you.\n\nDo you and your spouse each have the ability to trust the other and be vulnerable with each other, or is one or other of you a bit paranoid or distrustful? If you are the man, do you feel absolutely sure that your wife would never under any circumstances violate your trust in her by, for example, accusing you of abuse? If you are the woman, do you feel safe with your husband? Are you absolutely sure that he would never intentionally injure you or abuse you in any way? Do you each feel sure of the good character of the other? This is really very important.\n\nHow do you and your spouse each and jointly handle change? Change is stressful, even good changes. Changing your relationship in this way is a big change in most cases, and there can be all sorts of unintended consequences and unexpected events and emotions. If one or both of you is not good at handling change, Taken In Hand may not be right for you.\n\nHow have the two of you handled disagreements or incompatibilities in the past? Have you more often than not managed to handle difficulties well? Have you generally turned towards each other or have you been unable to adapt to each other? In moving your relationship in a Taken In Hand direction, you are likely to find that you will each have a different idea of what you want, and the two of you need to be able to create a path that you both like, rather than sticking rigidly to your first idea of how to proceed, otherwise Taken In Hand is not for you.\n\nWhether you are the man or the woman in a potential Taken In Hand relationship, if to you Taken In Hand feels like a burden, it is not for you. It needs to be something you positively want, something that you think will give you pleasure and joy and passion and peace. There must be something in it for you as well as for your spouse.\n\nSee also:\nAn overview of Taken In Hand\nCould this kind of relationship be for you?\nDo you have a commanding presence?\nCan you be in charge without turning into her mother?\nConsent makes all the difference in the world\nThe importance of conquest\nA woman must know that her man cares\nConsent, control, connection\nBarbie is the doll, Ken is just an accessory.\nThe resistant woman\nEquality isn't all it's cracked up to be\n\nprevious | FAQ index | next\n\nTaken In Hand Tour start | next\n\n[This is an answer to a frequently-asked question: this page is part of the FAQ. Please try to ensure that your post is answering the question or discussing the above post. The question is: How do I know whether Taken In Hand is right for me?]\n\n\nIs Taken in Hand Right for You?\n\nMy answer to this question would be, if you are in frequent power struggles, spend hours out of weekends in a silent treatment with the man you absolutely adore, find yourself swearing at your man, and wishing you could just get along, Taken in Hand may be what you are looking for.\n\nIf you wonder why there is a constant feeling that something is wrong or once again you have made another mistake, maybe it is your relationship roles. Perhaps having your man in charge and making the calls in your home life would make you feel cared for and secure. Especially if you admire strong men who can take charge.\n\nMaybe you would like to feel more feminine and appreciate his masculinity more. Maybe you don't care about his feminine side and whether or not it surfaces.\n\nMaybe you are a competent capable intelligent woman but you want to be Taken in Hand and you want a dominant man in your life.\n\nAsk yourself some of these questions without worrying if it is politically correct. Give yourself an honest answer about what would really make you happy and if Taken In Hand would make you happy this may be the relationship style for you.",

        "text":"\n\n2010 Blogher Conference FAQ: NYC edition\n\n\nin Uncategorized\n\nWell, it\u2019s that time again: The annual pre-Blogher freakout.\n\nOnly this year it\u2019s amplified because it\u2019s now closer to 1500 people freaking out instead of 400 and because it\u2019s in New York ohmigod NEW YORK and what will I wear and what if a homeless guy pees on me and OHMIGOD NEW YORK and hey, is that Kathie Lee?\n\nThis is now my fifth Blogher conference (I expect my commemorative watch, Lisa) so coupled with the fact that I\u2019m one of those rare 8.3 million New Yorkers, I believe I have the basic qualifications to answer a few questions about the weekend.\n\nWait, you live in New York City? I thought you live in Brooklyn.\nBoth are true.\n\nIs it true that New Yorkers all wear black?\nWearing pastels in New York is like taping a sign to your back that says mug me, please. Wearing white is simply a gift to the dry cleaners of the world.\n\nFantasy New York\nReal New York\n\nShould I wear my comfortable shoes?\nWe don\u2019t do comfortable because we spend all our time getting in and out of our cars and not actually walking anywhere.\n\nOh no, wait\u2026sorry, that\u2019s LA. So then, yes, by all means wear your comfortable shoes.\n\nHow do people dress for the cocktail parties?\nThe PC answer is wear whatever you want. You will see that answer all over the place.\n\nThe real answer, that everyone is afraid to tell you, is MAKE AN EFFORT, PEOPLE.\n\nIf you\u2019re dressed in New York, you\u2019ll always be ready for anything\u2013or anyone\u2013you encounter. There are 362 other days a year that you can sit home braless and unshaven in your khaki shorts and stretched-out tank top.\n\n\u00a0Random Blogher celebrity encounter with Rocco DiSpirito.\nHe wore blue. I wore purple. And probably breast milk.\n\nDo people really get mugged? Will I get mugged on the subway?\nDefinitely. 4.8 million people a day ride the subway because they get mugged. Here\u2019s a picture of my daughter on the subway only seconds before a guy in a Yoda suit and a ski mask swiped her lollipop.\n\nShe looks TERRIFIED!\n\nWhat do I do if forget to pack something?\nWe now have stores in NYC! It\u2019s one of Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s greatest legacies. What do you need? Mascara? Flat iron? Doughnut maker? Spy equipment? Edible pasties? We\u2019ve got it.\n\nAlso, there are people at Blogher who allow you to borrow things. I\u2019ve borrowed deodorant. It\u2019s true.\n\nWill I see a celebrity?\u00a0\nNot at the Hilton.\n\nLet me rephrase that \u2013 where can I see a celebrity?\nRee Drummond\u2018s room.\n\nI\u2019m shy \u2013 what can I say to my absolute most favorite ever blogger when I meet her?\nGOOD: I\u2019m so happy to meet you \u2013 I really like your writing.\nBAD: I am your stalker. Come to my room later and I\u2019ll show you the shrine made out of Jell-o and barbed wire.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t that big blogger talk to me?\nThere are a few possibilities:\n-You smell.\n-You introduced yourself as her stalker and talked about your shrine.\n-You\u2019re giving out \u201cI hate the world and have a huge chip on my shoulder\u201d vibes.\n-She\u2019s overwhelmed at this particular moment because she\u2019s human too; try her again later.\n\nWhatever the reason, if someone doesn\u2019t talk to you it is probably not because she is \u201cpopular\u201d and you are \u201cnot popular.\u201d For further elaboration, please refer to my 2009 Bloggers v Popular People Field Guide.\n\nWhat if a popular blogger really doesn\u2019t talk to me?\nEvery year there is that one blogger who writes a big angst-filled post-Blogher tell-all piece of link-baiting garbage on who didn\u2019t talk to her at Blogher. Don\u2019t be that person. Focus on the people you like, who like you back, and go have fun. I\u2019d hate to think you left your family and friends for three days and risked being mugged on the scary subway just to dwell on one person who you didn\u2019t connect with.\n\nDo I need business cards?\nIt depends whether you want to give your contact info to people you meet or not. Maybe you have one of those secret password protected blogs and a pseudonym from the Witness Protection Plan. In that case, business cards are not for you.\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t like one of the sponsors?\nIgnore their booth and don\u2019t take any of their freebies. Not everyone\u2019s politics are your politics and it\u2019s bad form to stage a sit-in on the conference floor.\n\nWhat if I really really don\u2019t like one of the sponsors?\nWrite about it thoughtfully on your blog.\n\nNo you don\u2019t understand, I have inside information about one of the sponsors that involves embezzling, illegal off-shore funds, an arms for hostages deal and a dog-fighting ring.\nGet a book deal.\n\n\nWhat is the real scoop on the behavior around conference swag?\nYou know those old ladies who take all the dinner rolls from the restaurant and put them into their handbags and then ask for more? Some of them will be there this weekend, only they\u2019re disguised as 28 year-olds. And really, they\u2019re only asking for more so they can host a dinner roll giveaway for their readers to drive more quality traffic to their blogs.\n\nLike them on Facebook to earn an extra entry towards a bonus loaf of pumpernickel. Then give them a big hug.\n\nWhat do I do if there\u2019s a party I\u2019m not invited to?\nMay a free night in Manhattan be the biggest problem of your weekend. Grab a friend and go explore!\n\nSuzanne Reisman has a smart post on NYC attractions off the beaten path. And Genie of The Inadvertent Gardener suggests some great dinner splurges in New York with fantastic suggestions in comments too. I can personally vouch for that $26 Minetta Tavern Black Label Burger; Nate used to make them for a living.\n\n\u00a0Photo courtesy Serious Eats; price courtesy an improving economy\n\nOh my gosh, are burgers really $26 there?\nNo, some are as low as $22 if you know where to look. In fact former New Yorker Julie Marsh suggests you hightail it out of Times Square and walk two blocks west to 9th Avenue for some affordable, fun dining options with more local character. You didn\u2019t come all the way here to eat at the Olive Garden, right?\n\nI still don\u2019t know where to eat or what to do in my free time.\nYou can always ask some of the locals and former locals who will be at Blogher. New Yorkers loooove giving advice.\n\nLook for Anna of Mommy Poppins, Isabel of Alpha Mom, Kim of Mom in the City, Doug of Laid-off Dad, Beth of Role Mommy, Vera of I\u2019m Not Obsessed, Elina of Mamaista, Carol of NY City Mama,\u00a0 Kelcey of Mama Bird Diaries, Torrie, Metalia, Melissa Chapman, Marinka, and plenty of others.\n\nThey\u2019ll be the ones wearing black who talk really fast.\n\nWhat is your least favorite part about Blogher?\nWhen I get home to a post from someone saying, \u201cI saw Mom-101 and wanted to say hi but didn\u2019t have the nerve.\u201d Please say hi? I won\u2019t bite. I might even hug you.\n\nWhat is your real very best single most important tip ever about Blogher?\nThis one also from Julie: Be sure your Spanx don\u2019t show above your waistband when you lean over. Someone will take a picture. We\u2019ve seen it happen.\n\n119 shards of brilliance\u2026 read them below or add one\n\njodifur July 20, 2010 at 12:12 pm\n\nHysterical! Thanks for this! great advice.\n\n\nBecky July 20, 2010 at 12:13 pm\n\nHAHA! On the second to last question, I seriously thought you wrote, \u201cI may even MUG you.\u201d\n\nNow THAT would have been an even better ending to an already great post. :)\n\n\nveep veep July 20, 2010 at 12:17 pm\n\nso excited everyone will be in our city this time for bloghlate can't wait to read about all the late night stops to ATMs to bail roomies out :)\n\n\nmotherbumper July 20, 2010 at 12:20 pm\n\nSpanxs check before leaving room \u2014 got it. Best advice I've read in ages.\n\n\nMotherhood Uncensored July 20, 2010 at 12:21 pm\n\nShrine of Jello and Barbed Wire\u2026\n\nHmmmm. I think you're onto something.\n\n\nsam {temptingmama} July 20, 2010 at 12:24 pm\n\nROFL! OMG Liz, I can't wait to see you again! This is BY FAR the best BlogHer post.\n\n*unpacks jello and barbed wire*\n\n\nAlso? Spanx? They WILL come off on the dance floor of one of the parties. Guaranteed.\n\n\nAmelia Sprout July 20, 2010 at 12:34 pm\n\nThat whole chart thing never fails to crack me up.\nI am a former New Yorker and I cannot wait to be \u201chome\u201d. I'll be the one avoiding conference food to go get things I miss eating. Also, people here still think I talk to fast and it has been 9 years. I am looking forward to fitting in again.\n\n\nCarol @NYCityMama July 20, 2010 at 12:42 pm\n\nDang\u2026you called me out on the wearing black and talking fast\u2026.and mugging for lollipops on subways.\n\n\nAdventures In Babywearing July 20, 2010 at 12:43 pm\n\nDon't take your baby to a bar.\n\nThis is my favorite getting ready for blogher post (and maybe the only one I've allowed myself to comment on since I'm not going this year, but you certainly made me smile.)\n\nhave a blast!\n\n\n\nCagey (Kelli Oliver George) July 20, 2010 at 12:48 pm\n\nSo, it seems I should leave the Jello and barbed wire at home. Damn you, Liz.\n\nAhem. This is my 5th BlogHer, too and yes, folks \u2013 RELAX. You will have a much more enjoyable time without The Freaking.\n\nIt makes me incredibly sad that every year folks come back from BlogHer and write angst-ridden posts, when in reality, the conference is not really that dramatic.\n\nAlso? It is is a conference, right? Let's act like it!\n\nVery excited to roam NYC again \u2013 it's been years for me!\n\n\nMusings of a Housewife July 20, 2010 at 12:52 pm\n\nThis. Is. Awesome. :-)\n\n\nTorrie July 20, 2010 at 12:53 pm\n\nBeing that I'm vegan now, I made my shrine to you out of barbed wire and pudding instead of Jello. I hope that's ok. Is that OK? PLEASE LOVE ME.\n\n\nEllen July 20, 2010 at 12:58 pm\n\nAs a long-time New Yorker I'd like to add that if you end up roaming around NY and get lost, talkreallyreallyfast when you approach someone on the street for directions or they will think you are asking for money. Also, and I've seen it happen, don't pass off swag to homeless people. They need food, not plush toys. Also, if you start collecting business cards, careful not to mix them up with your own. At Blissdom I accidentally handed out Megan Jordan's to someone and she gasped \u201cYOU'RE Velveteen Mind?\u201d So I said no. And told her I was The Bloggess.\n... (truncated)",

        "text":"Support TTN\n\nFAQ\u2019s about TTN\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I already have a lot of friends and belong to several organizations? Why should I join TTN? \u00a0TTN is specifically organized to meet the needs of professional women 50+. You\u2019ll find new friends here who share many of your concerns and interests.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What kind of women can I expect to meet in TTN? Most TTN members are 60 or older (83%) and a big majority are retired or semi-retired, typically from professional\/managerial positions. All have college or advanced degrees. About one-third of our members are still working full or part time or are self-employed. Over 60% live alone, with one-third married or living with a partner.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm somewhat shy. If I go to a TTN event, will it feel like I\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t know anyone?\nWe make a huge effort to welcome new members and help them feel comfortable. \u00a0When you arrive, please introduce yourself to the event organizer or one of the Committee members (usually wearing identifying nametags). They will introduce you to other members.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once I join TTN, what can I expect as the first steps? New members are all invited to a special New Member Reception. Go! You\u2019ll meet Steering Committee members and other newbies and learn a lot about how TTN operates and all that we offer. The best way to get to know other Members is to participate in some of our events. So, get acquainted with the TTN-NYC section of the website and especially our Events Calendar. Depending on your interests, join a Peer Group or a Committee.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What do TTN members say are the biggest benefits of being part of TTN?\u00a0 TTN delivers on the key benefits of providing opportunities to engage in interesting social activities and to meet new people that share your interests. Transition Peer Groups (TPGs) and topic-oriented Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are often cited as the core of TTN membership. The Caring Collaborative, which focuses on health and wellness, is a major reason why some members join and is considered one of TTN\u2019s unique benefits.\u00a0 Members see CC as providing an innovative, much-needed reciprocal service in NYC.\u00a0\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What are the main activities of TTN? See information about the two kinds of TTN Peer Groups (#s 7 & 8), our Caring Collaborative (#13) , Special Events, and Explore NYC (#12).\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is a Transition Peer Group?\u00a0 Transition Peer Groups\u00a0(TPGs) provide\u00a0a supportive environment for TTN members to have candid and confidential discussions on managing the myriad transitions we experience at this stage in our lives.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0What is a Special Interest Peer Group?\u00a0 Special Interest Groups\u00a0(SIGs) generally start with a TTN member who has a passion and is looking for other TTNers to share it. There are currently over 40 SIGs \u2013 focusing on everything from beading and bridge through politics, opera and zoology.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0How do I join a Peer Group and find one that is right for me? Go to the Peer Group web pages to see the lists of groups that are open to new members. Then send an email to the listed contact person indicating your interest in the group.\n10.\u00a0 \u00a0What if the group that I am most interested in gets filled up before I get to join it? Write to the peer group coordinator to get on a waiting list. New groups are organized by the Peer Group Committee when a sufficient number of TTN members\u00a0(usually 10-12) are available at a mutually convenient time.\n11.\u00a0 \u00a0What if I have an interest, but there\u2019s no Peer Group or SIG for it?\u00a0 Keep checking our website to see what groups ARE open or new. If\u00a0you don't see one that fits, you may be inspired to start your own. The SIG coordinator can help you get\u00a0a new one started and guide you through the first few meetings.\n12.\u00a0 What are the 3rd Thursday, Special Events, and Explore NYC meetings about?\nTHIRD THURDAYS: \u00a0The Program Committee presents a meeting on the third Thursday of each month that provides our members\u00a0a chance to socialize and take part in programs designed to\u00a0appeal to the multiple interests of our members. Topics have included retirement, health and wellness, finances, technology, Encore careers, arts and culture, politics, fashion, and so much more.\nSPECIAL EVENTS: The Special Events Committee\u00a0presents a series of diverse programs\u00a0and small gatherings on an ad hoc basis around topics\u00a0of specific interests. These have included topic-focused potluck dinners, special workshops, theatre events, and wine tastings.\nEXPLORE NYC: Explore NYC finds special excursions that help members enjoy the company of equally interested and interesting women while discovering the diversity of NYC's museums, galleries and cultural institutions.\u00a0\n13.\u00a0 \u00a0What is the Caring Collaborative? The Caring Collaborative (CC) enables TTN members to build a network committed to empowering and supporting each other in remaining healthy and energetic. CC members help one another when medical issues arise, and provide assistance in periods of temporary disability. They offer personal support with health practitioner visits, and an extra set of hands for errands when a member is confined to home.\n14.\u00a0 \u00a0How does the Caring Collaborative work? To join CC, you will be asked to participate in a short but important orientation to learn about our:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Assistance Network\u00a0- Assurance of companionship and non-medical assistance in time of need\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Member Information Exchange (MIX) \u2013Timely, valuable information from fellow CC members\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neighborhood Groups\u00a0\u2013Location-based groups that build friendships and provide mutual assistance in times of need.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CC Presentations - Programs on health and wellness issues, presented by expert practitioners.\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Health and Wellness Directories\u00a0\u2013Resources for information on health-related topics and for obtaining additional services such as food delivery, home care, transportation, etc.\n\n15.\u00a0\u00a0If I currently have support in my life, would I benefit from joining CC? Yes! Over 300 CC members are ready to help you if your support is not available. It\u2019s an easy way to make new friends. There is so much to be learned through our MIX program, our Neighborhood Groups, and our CC Presentations.\n\n16.\u00a0 \u00a0I have been retired for a while and have made that transition. Why should I join TTN? Retirement is not the only transition that we make at this time in our lives. We face health and aging issues. Many of us deal with aging parents and\/or adult children facing their own difficult times. There are pesky changes in our financial and insurance needs as well as in our living conditions. The list goes on\u2026it\u2019s good to have TTN friends to share with.\n17.\u00a0 \u00a0Can TTN help me find worthwhile volunteer work?\u00a0 TTN NYC members can take advantage of several ways to volunteer in their community:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ongoing volunteer activities with organizations that are making a demonstrated difference in their fields -- e.g. The Fortune Society and Reading Partners. These organizations have a TTN member \"champion\" to help you get started and make the most of your volunteer experience.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One-time volunteer events that are meaningful and fun, such as flower arranging with nursing home residents, a holiday gift wrapping party for families in need, etc.\u00a0\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lively Volunteer Committee that explores potential volunteer opportunities and plans activities for our members.

Many Peer Groups meet during the day. We are also testing weekend programs.

        "text":"Questions about elopements and popup weddings? Hopefully you\u2019ll find the answers here! If not, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us, we love to chat weddings!\n\nWill our photos be posted online?\n\nWe\u00a0share photos from\u00a0every wedding that we are a part of, and our weddings are frequently featured in publications like Capitol Romance, Washingtonian, and others. We always share wedding photos\u00a0because we love them so much!\n\nHow many guests can we have attend our elopement wedding?\n\nFor on-location popup weddings: You are welcome to have up to 10 guests at your ceremony\u2014please let us know if you plan to have guests. However, the portrait session will only include the two of you!\n\nPlease do keep in mind that many of the locations we have chosen may not know what to think about weddings happening on their property. If it\u2019s just four people, it\u2019s usually not a problem (a lot of what places object to is the guests, aisle runners, noise, etc.). However, if more guests are in attendance, we are more likely to get asked to leave.\n\nHave a few more guests?\u00a0For groups of up to 30, we can chat about a larger wedding package at one of our favorite low-cost wedding venues here in DC. Contact us to chat further!\n\nHow much does a Pop! Wedding cost?\n\nWeekday Pop! Weddings cost $3,200 (popups for under 15 guests) or $4,500 (weddings at our venue partners\u2019 locations with up to 35 guests). Detailed pricing information can be found over here.\n\nOur wedding package is now the same cost no matter which day of the week you choose!\n\nWhat kind of wedding officiant is Steven?\n\nSteven is recognized by the\u00a0Humanist Society\u00a0as a wedding officiant\/civil celebrant. He\u2019s a non-religious\u00a0wedding officiant who can legally perform weddings in Washington, DC and Virginia.\n\nCan we submit our wedding photos to publications?\n\nAbsolutely! Let us know where you\u2019re submitting\u00a0and how we can help!\n\nCan we get married in Virginia?\n\nSteven is a registered wedding officiant in Virginia, so we are able to marry couples in Virginia \u2014 we just can\u2019t get your marriage license due to the local laws.\n\nVirginia\u2019s laws require that both parties (you and your partner) go in person to the courthouse to apply for your license. In DC, though, there\u2019s no in-person courthouse trip required for you, Steven can get all your paperwork!\n\nCan we get married on another date that is not listed on your site?\n\nYes! With the weekday wedding option you can pretty much choose your own date (as long as\u00a0our team is\u00a0available), and you\u2019re also welcome to suggest a weekend date if you have one in mind \u2014 weekends are less flexible but we\u2019ll always try our best!\n\nDo we need a permit\/will we get kicked out?\n\nIt depends on the location. The easy answer is, if you\u2019re nervous about getting asked to leave, working with us to book one of our recommended venues will ensure you aren\u2019t bothered by security.\n\nAt some of the locations, getting kicked out is a possibility.\u00a0We\u2019ve found security to be tight around the Mall and Smithsonian buildings, so we avoid those areas.\n\nWith such a small group, we have the advantage of being able to perform ceremonies at all sorts of awesome locations! We will not have weddings at places that specifically prohibit them, however at some locations we just can\u2019t be sure. We love offering crazy fun spots to be married in, and we have backup locations at the ready\u2014all are awesome. If you have questions about a specific location, drop us a line and we\u2019ll chat!",
