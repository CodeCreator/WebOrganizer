[Photo\/Agencies]\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday he expects progress to be made this year in the debate over revisions to the Constitution.\n\nSpeaking at his first news conference of 2018, held in Ise, Mie prefecture, Abe said he wants to present to the public what shape the Constitution should take.\n\nHe added that Japan is facing the most severe security environment after World War II, and he is committed to strengthening the nation\"s defense capabilities - not just extending existing practices - to protect Japanese people.\n\nAbe aims to see a revised Constitution come into force in 2020, when Tokyo is to host the Summer Olympics, and has called for a clear definition of the existence of the Self-Defense Forces in the Constitution as a key topic of discussion.\n\nThe ruling Liberal Democratic Party is mulling adding to the Constitution a clause specifying that the SDF is \"a minimum necessary level organization with force\", according to the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.\n\nLyu Yaodong, a researcher of Japanese studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, described Abe\"s claim that the SDF \"is not part of combat power\" as word games aimed at covering up his military ambitions.\n\nOnce the prime minister succeeds in the amendment, it will affect the security of Northeast Asia and the related region, Lyu said.\n\n\"Therefore, it is particularly crucial whether Japan\"s opposition party can form a sound and comprehensive draft of the amendment,\" he said.\n\n\"From Japan\"s recent announcement to upgrade Izumo into an aircraft carrier and the import of the US-built Joint Strike Fighter F35-B to Abe\"s constitution amendment proposal, it reveals Tokyo\"s ambitions to strengthen its military capabilities step by step.\"\n\nMichio Hamaji, a Japanese businessman and political campaigner, said Japan\"s Constitution should be the role model for the rest of the world for outlawing war as a means to settle international disputes involving the state.\n\nThe ruling coalition of LDP and Komeito has captured two-thirds of the seats in two chambers of the parliament, known as Diet, the amount required to proceed with a constitutional revision. Any revision should also be subject to approval by a referendum.\n\nThe prospect of a constitutional amendment winning a majority of votes in a referendum are still nowhere in sight.\n\nAn opinion poll by Japan\"s Jiji Press on Dec 15 showed 68 percent of respondents were opposed to the Diet making any constitutional amendment proposal during its ordinary session, which will start on Jan 22.\n\nThe survey also found 51 percent were against amending the supreme law in haste, while 17 percent opposed revisions in principle.\n\nEven among supporters of the LDP, 50 percent of respondents rejected the proposal to revise the Constitution this year.\n\nContact the writers at [email\u00a0protected]\n\nhow to remove festival wristband\n24 hour wristbands\nsilicon or silicone\nwedding wristbands",
