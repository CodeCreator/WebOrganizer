        "text":"Android for Programmers\n\nandroid-book-deitelBefore I became a front end developer, I wanted to develop apps but the technology for mobile phones kinda sucked in the 90s.\u00a0 I knew cell phones were going to get better and better though.\u00a0 I was the odd ball, all my friends were fascinated by the iPhone in 2007 while I thought that it was more important the following year to have the Sony c905 8-megapixel camera phone\u00a0 with a removable\/upgradeable memory card, and xenon flash than an overpriced touch screen device. OK so the touch screen is important now but the removable memory card and xenon flash.\u00a0 Hell yeah, that shit still better than new 2014 iPhone\u2019s internal memory and you have to remember that c905 came out in 2008. What happens if the phone breaks and all the photos\/music is stored on the phone? get it fixed or pull the memory card and get a new phone. BURN.\n\nOne down side about every phone besides the iphone was the operating system.\u00a0 Let\u2019s face it, apple fan boys did have a point. The music, integration, apps, operating system were far more superior in the late 2000s than the rest (windows\/symbian\/android\/etc). Of course it\u2019s 2014 getting close to 2015. Android has more users than Apple and reports of faster speeds and productivity. It\u2019s getting really competitive so what the fuck does this have to do with anything about the book?\n\nThis book: Android for Programmers: An App-Driven Approach (Deitel Developer Series)\nis great but you can learn a lot of the basic steps to develop an app from bucky on youtube or Travis from mybringback. Matter of fact, I think those dudes teach development way fucking better than those snobby professors at the local college and universities.\u00a0 Another burn!\u00a0 At any rate, it\u2019s a good book that will teach you how to use the fundamentals of Java\u2019s object oriented programming\u00a0 into the SDK of the android world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve noticed the prices are getting lower on it, and the SDK version is outdated but that\u2019s the world of deprecation.\n\nAnyways I would rate this book 3.5 out of 5. Deitel has better Java books on their website but a lot of the techniques found in this android book can found online.\u00a0 They are definitely hard-core programmers but when it comes to their web design\u2026eh\u2026ok.\u00a0 There is definitely some science behind the left and right brain.\u00a0 I will give them the left side.\u00a0 Try following other developers on stack overflow, youtube, and other social media sites before purchasing this android book that gives you some cool techniques but nothing you can really useful in real life (they have an example on weather apps, calculator) , cool but you can probably download that shit for free from someone else for free and learn that on stackoverflow\u2026and its kinda like learning the hello world of web dev. Books are important for programmers but any written instructions for new technology in Android is quickly outdated and loses its value within months. It reminds of people who buy a new car, the moment they buy it and drive it off the dealers lot, it loses its value by a third. I feel that way about books in android programming. Although I didn\u2019t read the entire Hello Android book and only skimmed through it, it was a lot easier to read but its too late know since I know how to build basic android apps.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

        "text":"Rapid Android Development\nRapid Android Development\n\nAuthor: Daniel Sauter\nPublisher: Pragmatic Bookshelf\nPages: 392\nISBN: 978-1937785062\nAudience: Programmers \u00a0\u00a0\nRating: 3.5\nReviewer: Mike James\n\nWhat could \"rapid\" Android development be all about?\n\n\nThe answer is partly given by the subtitle \"Build Rich, Sensor-Based Applications with Processing\".\n\nWhat Rich, Sensor-Based Applications \u00a0are might be a mystery but as long as you have heard of the Processing language at least part of what this book is about will be clear.\u00a0\n\nProcessing is a Java-like language that is very popular with artists and creative types. The main reason for this is that a lot of the documentation and publicity is aimed at them. Overall Processing is a perfectly normal and usable object-oriented language with really good graphics and media processing facilities. It runs on the JVM and its free and open source and even if you are decidedly unartistic and definitely non-creative in the same sense it is a language worth knowing about.\u00a0\n\nOne of its most recent features is that it has acquired an Android mode. You might think that this is surprising, but Android is a Java platform - the main difference is that Dalvik is used in place of the JVM. However, the conversion from JVM byte code to Dalvik byte code is fairly straightforward.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThis book is basically an introduction to using Processing in its Android mode. It starts off by explaining how to install the Android SDK and Processing. From here we move on to the first \"sketch\", Processing programs are known as sketches. You can run the program on the Android emulator or a real device.\u00a0\n\nChapter 2 moves on to consider the problems and advantages of using touch. At this point the Ketai library - a standard Processing library for mobile phone use - is introduced and from this point on the book is mostly about using it.\n\nChapter 3 shows how to work with the motion and position sensors. The book tends to be very wordy with long explanations of the ideas behind the scenes of the history. This makes the book easier to read but it takes more time to get to the technical detail.\n\n\n\n\nPart II of the book focuses (pun intended) on using the camera and location devices. It starts off in Chapter 4 with a look at location and how to do things like work out the distance between two locations and so on. Chapter 5 is about the camera and again is mostly about using the Ketai library.\n\nPart II consists of three chapters on networking. Chapter 6 on WiFi, Chapter 7 on Bluetooth and WiFi direct and Chapter 8 on NFC.\u00a0\n\nPart IV is about data. Chapter 9 working with the file system and Chapter 10 is on using SQLite.\u00a0\n\nThe final part is about 3D graphics. This is about Processing's OpenGL wrapper classes. It goes from simple primitives and lights to textures and using SVG. There are some nice examples such as controlling a mobius band via the gyro orientation sensor.\u00a0\n\nThe final chapter is a collection of topics dealing with publishing your apps and running it within a browser via another of Processing's modes.\u00a0\n\nProcessing is a very easy language to use to create what look like impressive programs - you can achieve a lot with very little code. Most of the examples in this book are very short but they also lack the sort of facilities that any sort of real Android app would need. This is not really the fault of the book as Processing itself doesn't really do buttons and input boxes in Android mode. Yes you might be able to create a clever 3D graphics display and handle some fancy touch input but a conventional user interface to control the app is more difficult. Put another way you can't mix a Processing app with Android Java. As the Android mode of Processing develops this might be possible but at the moment integrating with a conventional Android app isn't possible.\u00a0\n\nIt is important to realize this because you might get carried away with how easy Processing is to use without noticing its key limitation for many apps.\u00a0\n\nThe second problem with the book is that it doesn't really go off the beaten track. Processing is easy to use and so is the Ketai library - it works exactly how you would expect it to. If you are already a programmer then you might find that the book doesn't do much more than point out what the possibilities are and provide a few nice easy examples. If this is what you are looking for then it achieved this goal very well.\u00a0\n\nIf you don't already program then this book isn't for you. Processing is easy to use and the book is an easy read but it makes no attempt to introduce the key programming concepts. However this said if you only program a little what you can achieve with remarkably little work should inspire you to learn more and become a better programmer.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to get started with Processing on Android and want a book on the topic, this is your only choice and for an introduction it is quite good.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAccess 2016 Programming By Example With VBA, XML And ASP\n\nAuthor: Julitta Korol\nPublisher: Mercury Learning and Information\nISBN: 978-1942270843\nPrint: 1942270844\nKindle:\u00a0B01I5RJW6M\nAudience: Access programmers\nRating: 4\nReviewer: Kay Ewbank\n\nThis brick of a book is an updated edition of a popular title with versions going back to Access 2003.\n\nThe CS Detective\n\nAuthor:\u00a0Jeremy Kubica\nPublisher: No Starch Press\nPages: 256\nISBN:\u00a0978-1593277499\nPrint:\u00a01593277490\nKindle:\u00a0B01J92NR0Y\nAudience: Computer Science newbies\nRating: 4\nReviewer: Sue Gee\n\nThe idea of teaching computer science via a detective story sounds as if it could be fun and appeal to a \u00a0[\u00a0...\u00a0]\n\nMore Reviews\n\nLast Updated ( Wednesday, 05 March 2014 )\n\nRSS feed of book reviews only\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nRSS feed of all content\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 i-programmer.info.

        "text":"Programming Flex 3\nProgramming Flex 3\n\nAuthor: Chafic Kazoun & Joey Lott\nPublisher: Adobe Dev Library, 2008\nPages: 657\nISBN: 978-0596516215\nAimed at: Developers already familiar with OOP\nRating: 4\nPros: Very useful reference\nCons: Lacks illustrative examples\nReviewed by: David Conrad\n\nIf you want to get use Flex then this book, subtitled \"The Comprehensive Guide to Creating Rich Internet Applications with Adobe Flex\", is a good place to start and an even better place to continue. It starts from the very basics but it isn't quite simple enough for the complete beginner - you need to be able to program to follow much of the discussion. In particular you do need to understand the basics of objects, classes variables and so ideally you should have mastered a language such as Java. C# or any object-oriented language.\n\nIf you are familiar with a similar system such as .NET Silverlight or any GUI framework such as the Java or WPF then you might find that the author doesn't tell you what is going on in terms that are direct enough, e.g. MXML is like XAML and so on. If you can stay the course however and read the full description you will understand what is going on.\n\nThe book also has a tendency to go over the more advanced aspects of things before doing the commonplace things that anyone new to Flex would need to know. There are also many omissions - coverage of the remote object, for example, and not much about of using Flex Builder IDE. It also tends to cover slightly esoteric topics such as late binding via introspection well before the reader has met the user interface controls. This isn't a big problem as long as you are reading the book according to the sections that interest you rather than reading through from page one to the end.\n\nThere are also very few useful illustrations in the book showing what the programs presented are trying to do. This can leave you no choice but to go and try them out.\n\nThe book also tends to present programming approaches to creating objects rather then the alternative declarative MXML approach. This is a matter of taste and for me its perfectly acceptable.\n\nThe final verdict has to be that this is a useful addition to a Flex 3 library but it isn't an essential book that you need to read cover to cover. It is a useful reference source however that explains things rather better than a cookbook approach would. I keep a copy near to hand while programming.\n\nLast Updated ( Thursday, 01 October 2009 )\n\nRSS feed of book reviews only\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nRSS feed of all content\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 All Rights Reserved.\nJoomla! is Free Software released under the GNU\/GPL License.",

        "text":"Game Physics Engine Development\n\nIn this review, I will discuss my experience with\u00a0Game Physics Engine Development: How to Build a Robust Commercial-Grade Physics Engine for your Game by Ian Millington. This is actually the first book I\u2019ve ever read solely on game physics and I think I made the right choice here. Although I have developed several physics engines previously, they were only in 2D and the extra dimension complicates matters significantly. Game Physics Engine Development is a book specifically about 3D game physics, though the author does make a short reference to 2D physics at the end. I felt like the book had just enough math to explain the concepts, without getting bogged down in technical minutia. I also enjoyed the friendly writing style, the approachable implementations, and a rational coding standard.\n\nIan Millington\u2019s book covers a lot of ground, and each chapter builds up a single aspect of the engine. Many chapters could stand alone in one aspect or another, though they do come together at the end. Some of the topics covered include: basic 3D math (vectors, matrices, quaternions), laws of motion, particles, rigid bodies, mass aggregate physics, springs, collision, contact resolution, velocity and acceleration, torque, friction, broad-phase collision detection, bounding volumes, and more. While the book is \u201conly\u201d 552 pages, there are a ton of things packed into those pages. I found the coverage to be fairly in-depth, without getting lost of mathematical proofs or anything like that. The book is very practical in that way, and a lot of the code samples could easily be the basis of a real implementation.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the book at lot, and breezed through it within a week, eagerly anticipating each new chapter. Being the only physics book I\u2019ve read so far, I don\u2019t feel 100% confidant creating a physics engine myself just yet. However, I do feel it has explained a lot of key concepts necessary in physics development. The book was everything I was hoping for, and gets my recommendation.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",
