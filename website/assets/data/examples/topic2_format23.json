        "text":"Programming Flex 3\nProgramming Flex 3\n\nAuthor: Chafic Kazoun & Joey Lott\nPublisher: Adobe Dev Library, 2008\nPages: 657\nISBN: 978-0596516215\nAimed at: Developers already familiar with OOP\nRating: 4\nPros: Very useful reference\nCons: Lacks illustrative examples\nReviewed by: David Conrad\n\nIf you want to get use Flex then this book, subtitled \"The Comprehensive Guide to Creating Rich Internet Applications with Adobe Flex\", is a good place to start and an even better place to continue. It starts from the very basics but it isn't quite simple enough for the complete beginner - you need to be able to program to follow much of the discussion. In particular you do need to understand the basics of objects, classes variables and so ideally you should have mastered a language such as Java. C# or any object-oriented language.\n\nIf you are familiar with a similar system such as .NET Silverlight or any GUI framework such as the Java or WPF then you might find that the author doesn't tell you what is going on in terms that are direct enough, e.g. MXML is like XAML and so on. If you can stay the course however and read the full description you will understand what is going on.\n\nThe book also has a tendency to go over the more advanced aspects of things before doing the commonplace things that anyone new to Flex would need to know. There are also many omissions - coverage of the remote object, for example, and not much about of using Flex Builder IDE. It also tends to cover slightly esoteric topics such as late binding via introspection well before the reader has met the user interface controls. This isn't a big problem as long as you are reading the book according to the sections that interest you rather than reading through from page one to the end.\n\nThere are also very few useful illustrations in the book showing what the programs presented are trying to do. This can leave you no choice but to go and try them out.\n\nThe book also tends to present programming approaches to creating objects rather then the alternative declarative MXML approach. This is a matter of taste and for me its perfectly acceptable.\n\nThe final verdict has to be that this is a useful addition to a Flex 3 library but it isn't an essential book that you need to read cover to cover. It is a useful reference source however that explains things rather better than a cookbook approach would. I keep a copy near to hand while programming.\n\nLast Updated ( Thursday, 01 October 2009 )\n\nRSS feed of book reviews only\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nRSS feed of all content\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 All Rights Reserved.\nJoomla! is Free Software released under the GNU\/GPL License.",

        "text":"Dancer reviews\n\n\nRSS | Module Info | Add a review of Dancer\n\nDancer (1.3118) *****\n\nI'm a minimalist and Dancer is just what I want. I've begun to switch my existing applications to Dancer. I have cobbled together an application structure that works similarly, but Dancer is much, much nicer. They thought of things I hadn't. I've been able to move a lot of my existing model files with very little change or no changes.\n\nI'll be using Dancer for any new web applications.\n\n\nDancer (1.3112) *****\n\nI had been a bit sceptical about MVC frameworks, until trying Dancer.\n\nThe bigest plus aside from its ease of use is its very small module dep list.\n\nI love the perl community, but when it comes to deploying perl application module deps can be a problem on servers you don't control.\nDancer is just so simple and easy to use. I highly recommend it.\n\nIf you are looking for a light weight simple easy to use MVC framework, give Dancer a try.\n\nDancer (1.9999_02) ****\n\nThe new moo-ish Dancer 2 is about ready to come to CPAN (from github). There is already a developer version (1.99xx). I looked a bit into it, suggested some documentation patches, but can't say exactly how much of an improvement it will be over Dancer 1. Seems that it will be much easier to deploy multiple Dancer 2 applications.\n\nDancer community is still great, although development is slower these days than it used to be.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about Dancer is that a) the Community is friendly, welcoming and big enough to respond quickly and b) that the Dancer folks produce clean, readable, undogmatically modern (in one word: excellent) perl code. (Dancer2 still has a little to go in this respect, but it's getting there.)\n\nI follow Dancer 2 development mainly to learn more about perl and the Dancer people continually come up with new stuff that I did not yet know about.\n\nDancer2 continues to make small to medium-size webapps a breeze.\n\nDancer (1.3093) *****\n\nWeb development is fun again thanks to Dancer. I spend less time breaking things and more time solving problems. More time getting to the fun part of coding.\n\nIn the past year, I've worked on three major projects using Dancer.\n\nThings I love about working with Dancer: flexible route declarations, fast unit testing, deployment environments (development\/test\/production), and a healthy and growing collection of useful Dancer Plugins as well as all of the Plack\/PSGI plugins.\n\nThere are other frameworks out there: Mojolicious, Catalyst, and all the rest. A different framework may work better for you. Personally, I found that Dancer fit my brain and code the best. Do your own research and use what's best for you and your projects.\n\nDancer (1.3071) *****\n\nTo preface the opinion I'm about to express, you should know that although I have experience doing web development using the frameworks CGI::Application, HTML::Mason and Catalyst - I haven't done any \"day jobs\" using Dancer.\n\nHowever, I've started playing with Dancer for my hobby projects. Other than some little quirks with settings and templates (1.3051), the words that come to mind are \"quick\", \"small\", \"simple\" and \"clean\". There's a close alignment of the packages and methods with the concepts one has in mind when doing web development.\n\nFormerly a Perl teacher, I never taught web development to the first-year students because the learning curve would have been too steep. I think Dancer has changed the game and beginners *can* learn Perl web development using Dancer. (We'll find out at the beginner's class I'm giving at YAPC in Riga:)\n\nDancer (1.3070) *****\n\nDancer is incredibly easy to learn, yet very powerful. Dancer is THE fastest way to develop web applications, hands down.\n\nKeep up the good work. I'm building my next large scale REST backend with Dancer!\n\nDancer (1.3070) ****\n\nI've used Dancer to build simple web apps and I found it to be light, simple, flexible, and easy to deploy.\n\nThe docs are pretty good and the community is welcoming and very helpful.\n\nI did hit a bug or two, but once reported these were fixed very quickly.\n\nDancer (1.3070) *\n\nThis smells like a big publicity stunt, those blog posts are just too much.\n\nAnyway, i've only tried Dancer once, and it was a lot less powerful than Catalyst.\nCan't recommend it for serious projects.\n\nDancer (1.3070) *\n\nI don't like all this attention seeking behavior.\nYou should really spend more time improving your software than to rant on a blog.\n\nDancer (1.3070) *\n\nDon't know what all the fuzz is about, nothing special about this at all.\nEspecially the documentation is pretty horrible.\n\nDancer (1.3070) *****\n\nPlease stops bashing Dancer if you didn't event use it !!!\n\nDancer is not Moose, because Dancer wants less dependencies as possible.\nThe Dancer core team use Moose, members even wrote a book with Moose apology chapter.\n\nIf you don't love Dancer for GOOD reasons, please tell them here otherwise please stops pollute CPAN Ratings, this is not a good place for anti marketing, for team developer politics and other bullshits !\n\nI didn't code with Perl 2 last years, I discovered Dancer this month et woahhh.\nIt reconciled me with the web, really.\nFast, simple, powerful, stable, well documented.\n\nGreat works guys !\n\nDancer (1.3070) *\n\nNot \"Modern Perl\", author ignores all the best practices that have been established in recent years.\nDoesn't even use Moose... hello... the 90s called, they want their Perl back!\n\nDancer (1.3070) *****\n\nExcellent bit of work by the Dancer team. Top class documentation, excellent support via irc\/mailing lists and a very easy to use module.\n\nDancer (1.3070) *\n\nDoes almost nothing, you could just as well use Plack on its own.\name for most plugins, they tend to just add more bloat to the DSL and no real value.\n\nDancer (1.3070) *****\n\nObviously faked.\n\nSuShee isn't Su-Shee and I have absolutely nothing against Dancer.\n\nDancer (1.3070) *****\n\nThe negative comments below are fake, see for more information.\n\nDancer (1.3060) *****\n\nYAWF (Yet Another Web Framework), but looks promising so far.\n\nI like Catalyst, but also find it rather bloated and overkill for small web apps, and to some degree feel like it forces me to code \"the Catalyst way\".\n\nDancer, on the other hand, strikes me as a smaller, easier framework, to which I can hand over drudgery, but maintain control and write my own code, my way.\n\nFriendly, responsive and approachable developers also instils confidence in this project.\n\nI think Dancer will be my future first choice for smaller webapp projects.\n\n[EDIT: For disclosure, I'm now part of the Dancer core dev team; at the time of writing this review I was not, I was just an interested user; since then, I started contributing, and became a member of the team. I decided I should leave the comment as it stands, but add this disclosure to explain.]\n[EDIT 2: editing the review has changed the datestamp to today's date. For reference, the original review was posted 2010-02-10 07:35:39]\n\nDancer (1.3011) ****\n\nDANCER is a great DSL Framework, I love it (TM), easy to use, clear from the structure, I'll say it again \"I love it (TM)\".I hope it keeps developing, and its philosophy remains true.\n\nDancer (1.1904) *****\n\nIt's fast! It's simple! It's minimalistic! I realy like it! Thanks.\n\nDancer (1.1811) *****\n\nGot my webservice up and running in 1 day with no knowledge about Dancer whatsover. Documentation contains very minor mistakes, but that's all.\n\nDancer is excellent for middle size websites or web services. It doesn't get in your way, and supports a hell lot of backend for deploying and running your application.\n\nThe transition from developping a prototype to having a production ready app is very smooth.\n\nDancer (1.1805) *****\n\nI like how dancer doesn't force you to code in any specific way, it provides the right amount of syntactic sugar to get your app up and running in double quick time - but doesn't get in the way when you want to do something else.\n\nIt's nice and light, and can be deployed in many environments. Thumbs up from me!\n\nDancer (1.171) *****\n\nDancer is a breath of fresh air in the convoluted world of Perl web frameworks. I have a lot vested in CGI::Application, another fine framework, but Dancer has really caught my fancy for future web apps.\n6 hidden unhelpful reviews",

For example if I block reddit.com\/r\/videos I start typing in address bar \"reddit\" and the videos sub will appear as a suggestion from history. Then I press enter and it isn't blocked, because the pattern matching seems to take place before the \"omnibar\" search is replaced with the complete url appearing in the dropdown.\n  \u2022 (2017-06-29) Walid Aqleh: just what I needed to test payment gateway if the thankyou page was not accessible.\n  \u2022 (2017-06-28) G L: Hello, thanks for your work but this extension does not block ALL http\/https requests according to the users' correct expression given\/saved. It only blocks requests from the addr bar\/field. If a page is making http requests for example to display an image, those requests are NOT blocked. Example: I tried to block the youtube logo, it gets blocked if I enter the logo's full url in the addr bar, but the logo shows up on the youtube home page (after doing everything CORRECTLY, i.e. clearing the browser cache, restarting, etc.)\n  \u2022 (2016-09-01) gal773: It works but you need to be very careful with what you enter. The program does not have any feedback on what you enter. If your URL expression is not correct it just stops blocking all URLs. When it works - it works!\n  \u2022 (2016-01-28) Nuno Faria: Worked on 1st try. Good!\n  \u2022 (2015-10-28) Davel Liu: Love this.

        "text":"GitLab Review\n\nProvides or mandates quantitative code into the Master\n\nWhat is our primary use case?\n\nWe have a normal use case to build source code and our agenda and then try to deploy it. The deployment is not specifically automated, it is semi-automated. So it is normal. We create an artifact, try to build it, and then deploy it onto the application server. It's\u00a0not fully automated.\u00a0\n\nWhat is most valuable?\n\nAt this point, I think the features are declining.\u00a0\n\nWe like that we can create branches and then the branches can be reviewed and you can\u00a0mesh those branches back. You can independently work with your own branch, you don't need to really control the core of other people.\u00a0\n\nThere could be more features in GitLab, but we are as of now not using the full-fledged feature set.\u00a0\n\nAnother good\u00a0feature is the\u00a0code review, which also helps us with peer review. It helps in giving part of the code and giving back whatever the branch that the developer is working on. It can then be merged once it is thoroughly reviewed. Those are certain things that I think are\u00a0helpful from a developer's point of view. It\u00a0provides or mandates quantitative code into the master.\n\nWhat needs improvement?\n\nWe do reviews as I also work with some of the leadership teams. Leadership teams generally focus on statistics, metrics, or some sort of dashboard. They would like to have the ability to categorize these things. They would like to have a very high-level view.\u00a0That would help. Someone who is not really a developer, but a leadership team. They are always interested in statistics or metrics features. That is something I would see imbedded into GitLab. That would help someone who is from the outside take a view and understand how qualitative the code is, because they cannot definitely dive in and look at the code, and they will not be able to understand all the details. At a high level, if they want to see and understand, at least they will have some confidence about how the projects are going on.\n\nFor how long have I used the solution?\n\nI have been using GitLab for two years.\u00a0\n\nWhat do I think about the stability of the solution?\n\nThe stability is good. I never had any issues. Stability-wise, I'm comfortable with it.\u00a0\n\nWhat do I think about the scalability of the solution?\n\nScalability-wise it is very scalable as well. Based on the code volume,\u00a0there is a scope for improvement. I never had issues with scalability.\n\nHow are customer service and technical support?\n\nTechnical support depends on licensing. We haven't reached out that frequently because it is stable and we don't see any issues. I don't recall anything that we had any particular challenge that we had to reach out immediately to GitLab and then get the answer quicker at any point in time.\n\nHow was the initial setup?\n\nI wasn't here for the deployment but the deployment takes around 10 minutes.\u00a0\n\nOnly a few aspects\u00a0will take close to five minutes.\u00a0\n\nWhat other advice do I have?\n\nI would rate GitLab an eight out of ten.\u00a0\n\nGitLab provides some sort of static analysis part. That is what I understand, but I never tried it. I would like to see\u00a0static analysis also embedded in GitLab. That would also help us. If there's something that it does internally by GitLab and then that is already tied up with your pipeline and then it can tell you that you're coding is good or your code is not great. Based on that, it would pass or fail. That should be\u00a0streamlined. I would think that would help to a greater extent, in terms of having one solution rather than depending on multiple vendors.\n\n**Disclosure: I am a real user, and this review is based on my own experience and opinions.\nMore GitLab reviews from users\n...who compared it with Jenkins\nAdd a Comment",

The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language \u201cfits together\u201d to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones. This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it. The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module. The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C. As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing. The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C. The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined. Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean....\n\n\n\nDec 2, 2016\n\nI'm just a beginner for CS or SE classes, and find this course really concise and challenging. It opens a door for me to get deeper into programming language. No wonder it got so high average score.\n\n\nMar 4, 2018\n\nVery interesting course! Superb teaching and homework assignments.

They solve problem domains not directly addressed by the language itself ie., repeatable solutions to family of application development issues -- be it architecture, deployment or testing. For a complex platform like J2EE, use of best practices can make or break a project.\nJust what the doctor ordered - Java Enterprise Best Practices is a collection nuggets of wisdoms. It is a compendium of idioms classified based on various enterprise Java areas written the most acclaimed authors in the field (Jason Hunter, Bret McLaughlin, Hans Bergsten et al). Ranging from most widely used EJBs to the latest additions such as JMX and JSTL, each chapter presents the reader with most widely accepted norms of using technologies such as - EJB, Servlets, JDBC, XML, RMI, JMX, Internationalization, JSP, JavaMail. Chapters on XML and RMI are the best of the lot.\nI was surprised to note the omission of JMS, given that its popularity when compared with other things such as JMX or JSTL. The last chapter on performance tuning lacks depth and reads more like hastily scribbled notes.\nCan best practices be argued? Absolutely! The first chapter of the book says just that. It is important to bear that in mind while you read through the chapters.\nWhile a seasoned J2EE developer idioms may find a few things trivial, it is quite a good reference to keep handy if you are developing real-life applications.\n\nMore info at\nMore info at\n  \u2022 Post Reply\n  \u2022 Bookmark Topic Watch Topic\n  \u2022 New Topic",

Having a copy of this myself, I felt it was my duty to add a review. I was browsing in a second hand book store about a month ago and I happened on this book. Let me just say that I have always been a fan of the O'Reilly books (and the nutshell series), so I quickly found the style easy to deal with. I got the book myself at about half the market value, but even if I paid the full price I would've been happy with the purchase. It covers a wide range of topics (as listed above), and I find it most useful as a quick desktop reference (which is how it describes itself). If you're new to Perl, don't buy this, get the Camel book instead (or the Llama book if your new to programming). But if you're beyond the stage of being a complete newbie, then this could be a worthwhile purchase.\n\n\n    Log In?\n\n    What's my password?\n    Create A New User\n    Node Status?\n    node history\n    Node Type: bookreview [id:\/\/268788]\n    and the web crawler heard nothing...\n\n    How do I use this? | Other CB clients\n    Other Users?\n    Others scrutinizing the Monastery: (5)\n    As of 2018-08-15 14:31 GMT\n    Find Nodes?\n      Voting Booth?\n      Asked to put a square peg in a round hole, I would:\n\n      Results (161 votes).

The best part of the course is the programming exercise. As the exercises are developed in such a way that you understand it well where and how to apply the concepts learnt here in our practical life.\n\n\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440: Christopher R\n\nMar 07, 2017\n\nVery thorough introduction to java programming. The exercises take a few hours each week, along with the lecture videos, but this felt very similar to sitting in a college classroom and then spending time studying every night.\n\n\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440: Adil A\n\nOct 09, 2016\n\nIt's a very nice course.

I just think the learning curve is kind of steep in the first week. The following weeks get easier as long as you grasp the new concepts and templates in OOP.\n\n\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440: Abhishek J\n\nApr 25, 2017\n\nThe course is really well structured.

Since one of the most pleasurable things a man and woman can do together is have sex, slaves are used often for sexual purposes. On Gor, a woman subjected to sexual use as a slave is not permitted to hold back or inhibit herself in any way. Surprisingly to the Terran, but not to the Gorean, the slave female finds that she cannot help but respond deeply and powerfully to the use of a master: her biological tendency to submission, when allowed to manifest itself, rewards her with extraordinary pleasure in sexual use and sexual drives far beyond what the free woman can experience. Gorean slave girls have been known to break their own bones on the bars of their cages trying to touch a man when they have been secured for a long time.\nThis book is not like that at all. It is very light and fluffy, lacking substance. All that is covered in this book is covered in the first twenty pages of the \"Visual Basic 6.0 Programmers Guide\" also published by micro$oft press.\n\nProduct: Book - Hardcover\nTitle: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture\nPublisher: Addison-Wesley Professional\nAuthors: Martin Fowler\nRating: 3\/5\nCustomer opinion - 3 stars out of 5\nImplementation Techniques\n\nWell, I finally got through this one, so it's time to write the review...\n\nI have to say I was disappointed by this book. Even though it's presented a MF's Signature book, in hardcover no less, the author tells us he just expects it to be \"useful\". Yes Martin, it is, but I expected it to be excellent, not just useful.\n\nAnother, bigger problem is that the title is very misleading: those like me looking to find something on the level of the Gamma and Alur books beware, the are very few design patterns here, as this deals mostly with implementations techniques. A title like \"Strategies for Enterprise Applications\" would be more accurate so you know upfront what to expect.\n\nIt has also been noted that it fails short on the Enterprise tag, discussing neither security, nor messaging or deployment, and I agree. Finally, I feel it also fails in providing \"a pattern language\" since there are just too many of them presented, with too many words on them.\n\nBut even as flawed as it is, I find it a good book, that will teach you some tricks you may have missed, and is also an invaluable introduction and teaching tool (just not for those of us already deep into design and architecture).\n\nA very positive feature of the book is that it denies neither J2EE nor .NET, playing to the advantages of both depending on the subject at hand. However, for true design patterns in those technologies get the excellent \"Core J2EE Patterns\" and \"Enterprise Solution Patterns using .NET\" respectively instead.\n\nProduct: Book - Hardcover\nTitle: Revised Core Rulebook (Star Wars Roleplaying Game)\nPublisher: Wizards of the Coast\nAuthors: Bill Slavicsek, Andy Collins, J.D. Wiker, Steve Sansweet\nRating: 5\/5\nCustomer opinion - 5 stars out of 5\nbetter than the original?\n\nTo be honest, I was exceptional sceptic about this... Oh goody, an other d20 product. My dislike for the d20 is grounded on the fact, that you need something like a nuclear fission bomb to kill a 20 lvl fighter, among other things and the old West End Games) Star Wars was really deadly. Well, no doubt about it... this one has the same appeal. Suddenly, the guy with a holdout blaster can get you into real trouble and that makes gaming so much more interesting. As the Star Wars Universe expanded after Episode VI was done and gone, so did the Star Wars RPG after WotC baught the rights and relaunched it. The modular system allows for a story-driven appoach to character development without complication and balancing the game is not hard since Jedis are only Twi`Leks, too (or Whookies, Trandoshans, Humans, whatever) and not some overpowered fighting machines. The layout is great, full colour through and through, which is a rare thing in RPG books, and the rules are easy comprehendable. Furthermore, this is the book you need. That`s it. Oh, sure there are other great books about the Star Wars RPG out there, but to PLAY you only need this. Therefore, a great buy for a Star Was Fan and people who like to become one.\n\nProduct: Book - Paperback\nTitle: Oracle SQL by Example, Third Edition\nPublisher: Prentice Hall PTR\nAuthors: Alice Rischert\nRating: 5\/5\nCustomer opinion - 5 stars out of 5\nThis book is Awesome!!\n\nThis book by Alice Rischert is one of the greatest Oracle SQL books ever written. I purchased the 1st edition of this book back in the day and it helped me pass the Oracle 8i OCP SQL exam. After reading the 1st edition, I was very much compelled to purchase the 3rd edition. The 3rd edition of the book is much better with all the errors from the previous versions corrected. This is the book they use for the students at Columbia University in New York. After you read this book and do all the exercises and test your thinking projects, you become a master of the subject. If you want to learn Oracle SQL, there is no greater learning tool than this book. Indeed, there is much time, effort, and loads of quality and research put into this book. The format of the book is reading and then hands-on labs which reinforce the topics you just read. After you read this book you should purchase the Oracle PL\/SQL by Example third edition. It goes hand-in-hand with this book. AFterward, you'll know enough to go take the Oracle SQL and PL\/SQL exam.",

Though the eventual \"change over\" is still a long ways away, web developers and programmers are slowly beginning to implement HTML5, the latest version of HTML (or Hyper Text Markup Language, the backbone for almost every website on the Internet), into their sites. In fact, you've probably already used a couple of HMTL5 elements and not even realized it. Most major browsers already support a few HTML5 elements, and sites like Gmail, Google, The New York Times and CBS (as well as a version of YouTube) are already use the protocol.\n\nSo, you may be asking \"What's the big deal with HTML5?\" For one, the language aims to expand the language's scope, and what developers can do, without introducing numerous plug-ins like Flash, Silverlight and Java. This means you won't have to install (and update) numerous plug-ins. Additionally, many mobile devices feature support, allowing faster web browsing on HTML5-supported sites.\n\nThe new standard means current developers will need to get up-to-date on the new features quickly, but also opens to the doors for budding web developers and designers to jump onboard and get a head start in learning the new technology. O'Reilly Media has both sides covered with Head First HTML5 .\n\nI've been a fan of concept behind O'Reilly's Head First series for a while now, though previous attempts to use the books have usually turned out unsuccessful, leading me to believe the concept was neat, but didn't work. HTML5 Programming changed that perception entirely; leading me to think previous attempts were due to my brain not being wired to handle other subject matter (C#, mainly) as efficiently.\n\nRather than tossing out a numerous step-by-step examples and hoping you understand the subject by the end of the book, the Head First series focuses on making sure you \"get it\" and making sure you understand what's happening. Each chapter includes a short task built around one or two concepts meant to show a certain aspect, like the Canvas or Video tag, or Web Storage API's. Each is introduced with some background information as well as in-book exercises meant to get you writing and coding quickly. In order to keep your interest, the book also includes lots of offbeat pictures and notes scatted throughout the chapter. Though goofy, the extras are meant to keep your brain engaged, allowing your brain to latch on to information quicker and, even more important, retain it better.\n\nBefore diving in to HTML5, you'll need some understanding of HTML and CSS. The book assumes you know something about web development, so while it isn't a great jumping off point for newbie developers who haven't coded before, it is fantastic for novice and advanced developers. A bit of Javascript knowledge is also helpful, though the first few chapters do a more than adequate job at getting you as up to speed as you need to be.\n\nI'm still very much a novice when it comes to web developer, but was able to make it through the first few chapters without much trouble. Once I got deeper into the book, however, I decided to switch over to O'Reilly's Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML for a refresher course. With that knowledge firmly in my head, I was able to get through the rest of the book without much outside research. By the time I got to the new tags, I started figuring out steps well before they were introduced in the book. I don't recommend jumping ahead in any chapters - even if you already know it - but it is the best testament possible for the book's methods. They work.\n\nIf you're looking for a desktop reference guide to HTML5, Head First HTML5 isn't for you. Although the book does a fantastic job of introducing some of the new elements, it doesn't drill down into any with extensive details. The focus is on getting you to understand what's happening and how to do the basics; you'll need to seek out broader details on your own. The book also stays away from a couple of the more transitory elements. HTML5 is far from locked-in, so some elements are still changing.\n\nMy experiences with other Head First books wasn't great, but I absolutely loved HTML5 Programming (and, HTML with CSS & XHTML). Each chapter was filled with little victories and I was surprised by how well I was able to retain the information after stepping away from the books. This is a great book and I can't recommend it enough.\n\n-Starscream, GameVortex Communications\nAKA Ricky Tucker\n\nRelated Links:\n\nSound Something Startling Happens Sound The Cult of LEGO\n\nGame Vortex :: PSIllustrated",

This trend is driven by the adoption of Scala as the main programming language for many applications. Scala fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with both Java and Javascript. Scala is the implementation language of many important frameworks, including Apache Spark, Kafka, and Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, Netflix, Zalando, and also Coursera. In this course, you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks, such as modeling business domains or implementing business logic. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. The course is hands-on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of programming projects as homework assignments. Recommended background: You should have at least one year of programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C\/C++, Python, Javascript, or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line....\n\n\n\nSep 23, 2019\n\nAs expected Martin is awesome in explaining principle of functional programming. I have started reading the book as well to make sure I keep up with the knowledge which I have gained from this course.\n\n\nSep 13, 2018\n\nIt took me much longer than expected to finish the course and sometimes it made me feel stupid and helpless.

        "text":"Posts Tagged Managing Windows Servers with Chef\n\nManaging Windows Servers with Chef, Book\u00a0Review\n\nHarness the power of Chef to automate management of Windows-based systems using hands-on examples.\n\nManaging Windows Servers with Chef\n\nRecently, I had the opportunity to read, \u2018Managing Windows Servers with Chef\u2019, authored John Ewart, and published in May, 2014 by Packt Publishing. At a svelte 110 pages in paperback form, \u2018Managing Windows Servers with Chef\u2019, is a quick read, packed with concise information, relevant examples, and excellent code samples. Available on Packt Publishing\u2019s website for a mere $11.90 for the ebook, it a worthwhile investment for anyone considering Chef Software\u2019s Chef product for automating their Windows-based infrastructure.\n\nAs an IT professional, I use Chef for both Windows and Linux-based IT automation, on a regular basis. In my experience, there is a plethora of information on the Internet about properly implementing and scaling Chef. There is seldom a topic I can\u2019t find the answers to, online. However, it has also been my experience, information is often Linux-centric. That is one reason I really appreciated Ewart\u2019s book, concentrating almost exclusively on Windows-based implementations of Chef.\n\nIT professionals, just getting starting with Chef, or migrating from Puppet, will find the \u2018Managing Windows Servers with Chef\u2019 invaluable. Ewart does a good job building the user\u2019s understanding of the Chef ecosystem, before beginning to explain its application to a Windows-based environment. If you are considering Chef versus Puppet Lab\u2019s Puppet for Windows-based IT automation, reading this book will give you a solid overview of Chef.\n\nSeasoned users of Chef will also find the \u2018Managing Windows Servers with Chef\u2019 useful. Professionals quickly master the Chef principles, and develop the means to automate their specific tasks with Chef. But inevitably, there comes the day when they must automate something new with Chef. That is where the book can serve as a handy reference.\n\nOf all the books topics, I especially found value in Chapter 5 (Managing Cloud Services with Chef) and Chapter 6 (Going Beyond the Basics \u2013 Testing Recipes). Even large enterprise-scale corporations are moving infrastructure to cloud providers. Ewart demonstrates Chef\u2019s Windows-based integration with Microsoft\u2019s Azure, Amazon\u2019s EC2, and Rackspace\u2019s Cloud offerings. Also, Ewart\u2019s section on testing is a reminder to all of us, of the importance of unit testing. I admit I more often practice TAD (\u2018Testing After Development\u2019) than TDD (Test Driven Development), LOL. Ewart introduces both RSpec and ChefSpec for testing Chef recipes.\n\nI recommend \u2018Managing Windows Servers with Chef\u2019 for anyone considering Chef, or who is seeking a good introductory guide to getting started with Chef for Windows-based systems.\n\n\n, , , , , ,\n\nLeave a comment",

        "text":"Rapid Android Development\nRapid Android Development\n\nAuthor: Daniel Sauter\nPublisher: Pragmatic Bookshelf\nPages: 392\nISBN: 978-1937785062\nAudience: Programmers \u00a0\u00a0\nRating: 3.5\nReviewer: Mike James\n\nWhat could \"rapid\" Android development be all about?\n\n\nThe answer is partly given by the subtitle \"Build Rich, Sensor-Based Applications with Processing\".\n\nWhat Rich, Sensor-Based Applications \u00a0are might be a mystery but as long as you have heard of the Processing language at least part of what this book is about will be clear.\u00a0\n\nProcessing is a Java-like language that is very popular with artists and creative types. The main reason for this is that a lot of the documentation and publicity is aimed at them. Overall Processing is a perfectly normal and usable object-oriented language with really good graphics and media processing facilities. It runs on the JVM and its free and open source and even if you are decidedly unartistic and definitely non-creative in the same sense it is a language worth knowing about.\u00a0\n\nOne of its most recent features is that it has acquired an Android mode. You might think that this is surprising, but Android is a Java platform - the main difference is that Dalvik is used in place of the JVM. However, the conversion from JVM byte code to Dalvik byte code is fairly straightforward.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThis book is basically an introduction to using Processing in its Android mode. It starts off by explaining how to install the Android SDK and Processing. From here we move on to the first \"sketch\", Processing programs are known as sketches. You can run the program on the Android emulator or a real device.\u00a0\n\nChapter 2 moves on to consider the problems and advantages of using touch. At this point the Ketai library - a standard Processing library for mobile phone use - is introduced and from this point on the book is mostly about using it.\n\nChapter 3 shows how to work with the motion and position sensors. The book tends to be very wordy with long explanations of the ideas behind the scenes of the history. This makes the book easier to read but it takes more time to get to the technical detail.\n\n\n\n\nPart II of the book focuses (pun intended) on using the camera and location devices. It starts off in Chapter 4 with a look at location and how to do things like work out the distance between two locations and so on. Chapter 5 is about the camera and again is mostly about using the Ketai library.\n\nPart II consists of three chapters on networking. Chapter 6 on WiFi, Chapter 7 on Bluetooth and WiFi direct and Chapter 8 on NFC.\u00a0\n\nPart IV is about data. Chapter 9 working with the file system and Chapter 10 is on using SQLite.\u00a0\n\nThe final part is about 3D graphics. This is about Processing's OpenGL wrapper classes. It goes from simple primitives and lights to textures and using SVG. There are some nice examples such as controlling a mobius band via the gyro orientation sensor.\u00a0\n\nThe final chapter is a collection of topics dealing with publishing your apps and running it within a browser via another of Processing's modes.\u00a0\n\nProcessing is a very easy language to use to create what look like impressive programs - you can achieve a lot with very little code. Most of the examples in this book are very short but they also lack the sort of facilities that any sort of real Android app would need. This is not really the fault of the book as Processing itself doesn't really do buttons and input boxes in Android mode. Yes you might be able to create a clever 3D graphics display and handle some fancy touch input but a conventional user interface to control the app is more difficult. Put another way you can't mix a Processing app with Android Java. As the Android mode of Processing develops this might be possible but at the moment integrating with a conventional Android app isn't possible.\u00a0\n\nIt is important to realize this because you might get carried away with how easy Processing is to use without noticing its key limitation for many apps.\u00a0\n\nThe second problem with the book is that it doesn't really go off the beaten track. Processing is easy to use and so is the Ketai library - it works exactly how you would expect it to. If you are already a programmer then you might find that the book doesn't do much more than point out what the possibilities are and provide a few nice easy examples. If this is what you are looking for then it achieved this goal very well.\u00a0\n\nIf you don't already program then this book isn't for you. Processing is easy to use and the book is an easy read but it makes no attempt to introduce the key programming concepts. However this said if you only program a little what you can achieve with remarkably little work should inspire you to learn more and become a better programmer.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to get started with Processing on Android and want a book on the topic, this is your only choice and for an introduction it is quite good.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAccess 2016 Programming By Example With VBA, XML And ASP\n\nAuthor: Julitta Korol\nPublisher: Mercury Learning and Information\nISBN: 978-1942270843\nPrint: 1942270844\nKindle:\u00a0B01I5RJW6M\nAudience: Access programmers\nRating: 4\nReviewer: Kay Ewbank\n\nThis brick of a book is an updated edition of a popular title with versions going back to Access 2003.\n\nThe CS Detective\n\nAuthor:\u00a0Jeremy Kubica\nPublisher: No Starch Press\nPages: 256\nISBN:\u00a0978-1593277499\nPrint:\u00a01593277490\nKindle:\u00a0B01J92NR0Y\nAudience: Computer Science newbies\nRating: 4\nReviewer: Sue Gee\n\nThe idea of teaching computer science via a detective story sounds as if it could be fun and appeal to a \u00a0[\u00a0...\u00a0]\n\nMore Reviews\n\nLast Updated ( Wednesday, 05 March 2014 )\n\nRSS feed of book reviews only\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nRSS feed of all content\nI Programmer Book Reviews\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 i-programmer.info.
