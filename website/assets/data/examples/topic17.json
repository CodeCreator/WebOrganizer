The city-state this month celebrated the 50th anniversary of its independence.\n\nRead MoreSingapore at 50: From early-adopter to global leader\n\nThe People's Action Party (PAP) has ruled the wealthy Southeast Asian city-state since independence in 1965 and its ability to shift the economy away from export manufacturing to a high-value services and investment-driven growth model has been crucial to Singapore's success at transforming into one of the region's few first-world nations.\n\nThe country's one-party system may be unusual to other developed economies but it is one that benefits all of Singapore's residents, said Lee, who is the son of Lee Kuan Yew, at a conference earlier this month.\n\nDespite this, the opposition, which is made up of nine active parties, will contest all 89 seats \u2013 the first time that this has happened since 1963, according to local media outlet Channel NewsAsia.",

Send in Your SNAP Letter to the Editor TODAY (April Action)\n\nAs Congress heads back to DC this week to finalize the 2016 budget, send them a strong message that any budget that puts SNAP cuts on the \u201cfast track\u201d is unacceptable. RESULTS volunteers have been doing an excellent job at using the media to push members of Congress to protect SNAP. In the last week, you\u2019ve had 14 media pieces about SNAP published! That kind of coverage makes a difference. Keep it up and do all you can to protect hungry families!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Take two minutes to send a letter to the editor telling your members of Congress by name to protect SNAP in the 2016 budget. Use our SNAP LTE alert to send your letter today. If you want to write your own letter, and use the April Action for talking points and background information. If you are looking to make a bigger impact, use our SNAP media brief to urge your local paper to write an editorial about protecting SNAP. Find media outlets to send your letter using our Media Guide. If you have questions or need help with letters, op-eds, or editorials, please contact Jos Linn ([email\u00a0protected]) for assistance.\n\nWe also encourage you to listen to the recording and review the slides from last Saturday\u2019s April U.S. Poverty National Meeting; guest speaker Rebecca Lenn provided some invaluable insights on how to respond to myths about SNAP in the media.\n\nGot Ten Minutes? Invite Young People to Apply for REAL Change\n\nWhile the immediate focus at RESULTS is on protecting nutrition programs and expanding economic mobility in America, we are also looking ahead at engaging the next generation of RESULTS activists. We have a fantastic network of volunteers, some of whom have been with RESULTS for decades. But we know that in order to survive and thrive, RESULTS always needs to be looking for new people, especially young people. Young people bring their unique strength, passion, and intelligence to any endeavor. Imagine what world we could create if the next generation of leaders started out as RESULTS advocates. We have a tool to make that happen.\n\nThe RESULTS REAL Change Fellowship is a year-long volunteer program working to train the next generation of anti-poverty advocates. It is a way for 18-28 year olds to get unique experience in lobbying, media advocacy, and organizing. It starts with a trip to the RESULTS International Conference and continues throughout the year, where Fellows put their ongoing training into practice in their community. It can be a wonderful experience for those who participate, just like PaHoua Vang from Minnesota. PaHoua recently wrote on the RESULTS Blog about how RESULTS and the REAL Change Fellowship has taught her the courage to advocate for the things she cares about. We want more people like PaHoua, and Sarah Miller, and Reba Carethers, and David Costello, and other Fellows who have completed the program. We are now accepting applications for the 2015-26 class and we need your help. If you know someone 18-28 years old who would make a great advocate, urge them to apply today. The deadline to apply is April 25.\n\nTAKE ACTION: Think you might know someone who wants to be a part of our REAL Change Fellowship? Take ten minutes and tell them to apply fast! We have already accepted over 50 REAL changers and applications are pouring in. REAL Changers work with RESULTS an average of six hours per week and attend webinar trainings every two weeks. They spend the year learning how to lobby, organize and work with local media. The application deadline is April 25, so please share with your local group and local contacts now. To learn more check out www.results.org\/realchange.\n\nGot Twenty Minutes?

Rebecca Lenn, Director of Outreach for Media Matters, did a fabulous presentation on how to combat myths about SNAP in the media. For example, she taught us to \u201cminimize the myth, familiarize the fact.\u201d Too often, when we hear something negative about SNAP, our response is to repeat it and then try to negate it (\u201cSNAP does not have a high fraud rate!\u201d). While admirable, Rebecca explained that this simply reinforces the myth in the mind of the reader or listener. Instead, you want to retell it. Here\u2019s an alternative frame Rebecca provided:\n\nMyth: SNAP has a high rate of fraud and abuse.\n\nRetold Fact: SNAP is doing exactly what it is supposed do and what a democracy would ask of it. It is helping people who need help in hard times. Pundits and politicians who make this claim are turning a blind eye to not just the numbers that show that fraud and abuse are rare, but the seniors, children, and working families for whom SNAP is helping.\n\nAdvice like this is invaluable and only helps us to better educate lawmakers and the public about the truth. This is only one of the many tips Rebecca provided us during the meeting. The call also included shares from volunteers in Iowa, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Washington State about media successes and face-to-face meetings this month. If you were not on the call or want to review it again, please listen to the recording of the call and download the slides and summary of the call from our National Conference Calls page.\n\nRESULTS greatly appreciates Rebecca and Media Matters for appearing on our call. We look forward to working with them again in the future.\n\nQuick News: Invite Staffers to Witnesses Event; Learn Where Your Taxes Go\n\nInvite Congressional Staffers to Witnesses to Hunger Event.

        "text":"\n\nDemocrats, led by Feinstein, are engaged in a war of words with the CIA.\n\nDems have votes to open CIA report\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is poised to send a long-awaited report on the CIA\u2019s interrogation practices to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk for his approval \u2014 or redaction.\n\nChairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has the votes on the narrowly divided panel to publicly reveal the executive summary and key conclusions of a 6,300-page report on Bush-era interrogation tactics, a move sure to fuel the Senate\u2019s intense dispute with the CIA over how the panel pieced together the study. That vote is likely to happen sometime this week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut rather than a strong bipartisan signal from Congress, a vote to unveil the study appears set to divide along party lines because of that dispute.\n\nAll of the committee\u2019s Democrats, except Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, said in interviews or through aides that they will bless the public release of the document. Warner has not publicly indicated how he will vote, but he supported approving the final classified report on the same subject in December 2012. The committee has been bickering with the CIA ever since over the report\u2019s accuracy, as well as Feinstein\u2019s insistence that the study\u2019s key findings be released publicly.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Another Obama reset: Europe)\n\nThe panel\u2019s swing vote could be freshman Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, who has taken a measured approach to revelations over NSA data-mining and the flare-up with the CIA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inclined to vote to support [release]. But I still want to think about it,\u201d said King, who caucuses with the Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m going to review the CIA\u2019s response once more. I want to be sure the report is accurate.\u201d\n\nA vote to release the report is not the end of the committee\u2019s work, according to sources familiar with the process and committee rules. The full Senate doesn\u2019t have to approve the report before it hits Obama\u2019s desk for him to review the conclusions. But it\u2019s Obama who will ultimately decide whether the document needs to be further redacted, as the CIA will likely recommend.\n\nObama says he is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to releasing the Senate report and has urged the committee to proceed \u2014 and Senate Democrats aren\u2019t letting up until details of the CIA\u2019s use of secret prisons and interrogation techniques are in the hands of the public.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Feinstein-CIA feud in uncharted territory)\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve a proper and and accurate accounting of the history, management, operation, and effectiveness of this program,\u201d Intelligence Committee member Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) wrote in a letter to Obama on Thursday. \u201cWe can finally correct the record, move past this dark chapter in our history and become a stronger nation for confronting our mistakes.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, led by Feinstein, are engaged in a war of words with the CIA over their five-year effort to assemble a comprehensive look at the interrogation of terrorist suspects. Feinstein has leveled explosive charges that the CIA interfered in the panel\u2019s investigation by removing access to an internal review of CIA interrogation techniques, which is believed to contain myriad criticisms of CIA procedure.\n\nThe CIA asserts that committee staffers committed wrongdoing by removing that internal review from a CIA facility and storing it on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has instructed the Senate sergeant-at-arms to unilaterally investigate and strongly backed Feinstein last week, telling CIA Director John Brennan in a letter it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to conclude that Senate staffers could hack into a classified network to acquire the internal document.",

        "text":"Skip to content\n\nThe Natural Governing, Triangulation and Safety\u00a0Party\n\nOctober 14, 2009\n\nJust like the majority of Canadians, I consider my political views to be centre to centre-left on the \u2018political spectrum\u2019.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I was excited that the Liberals decisively picked a decisive leader after Stephane Dion imploded last fall. That\u2019s why I was glad a few weeks ago when that same leader finally stood up and started acting like an opposition party, opposing a government that a majority of Canadians did not vote for.\u00a0 That is why this week I am slightly depressed that the promise the Liberals had over the last, has be squandered again and again. There\u2019s a good article up on rabble about the Liberal and their current slide to catch you up to speed on this week\u2019s disappointments if you\u2019ve missed it.\n\nThey are saying just what I and others have been saying for a while, that Mr. Ignatieff and his Natural Governing Party(TM) needs to grow a spine and stand for something.\u00a0 They need to stand for the 60% of Canadians who opposed the Conservative party in the last election.\u00a0 This is the job of all opposition parties but the leader of the opposition should well, you know, lead that opposition. Flowery words and fancy speeches are nice but frankly Mr. Ignatief\u2019s speeches aren\u2019t even all that flowerly and inspiring, just long winded.\u00a0 People criticized President Barack Obama this week for accepting the Nobel Peace prize even though he\u2019s provided more inspiring speeches about peace than actual peace itself.\u00a0 But\u00a0 if Mr. Ignatieff were that inspiring he might be forgiven.\u00a0 He\u2019s not.\u00a0 So he needs to reach an even higher standard of action than Mr. Obama.\n\nThe Liberal party seems to have convinced itself in the past decade or two that it does not stand for any particular causes per se but rather for a state of mind.\u00a0 To be Liberal is to eternally sit on a fence talking about balance and holding Canada together and bla bla \u201c>bla bla.\u00a0 What do you stand for Mr. Ignatieff?\u00a0 Do you want to militarize the North?\u00a0\u00a0 Are you angry we don\u2019t have national childcare yet? Are you disgusted by our lack of progress on global warming? Do you dream of a future Canada with high speed rails linking our major metropolises, of being a voice for peace, of leading green technology or bioscience or robotics or nanotechnology?\u00a0 Do you want Canadians to believe in their democracy again, to make sure every vote cast in Canada counts the same whether its in Nunavut or Charlottetown or Toronto or Prince Rupert?\n\nDo you believe in anything? We know you do, you\u2019d been a writer and academic for three decades.\u00a0 You must have an opinion on everything?\n\nSo tell us.\u00a0 And stand for it.\u00a0 Or die trying.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only message people will respect at this point.\n\nIf you read this blog you know what issue I think the Liberals should focus on, if you agree electoral reform should be one of these issues sign this twitter petition to demand Ignatieff declare his party will fix our democracy by committing to to real electoral reform : pass the link on\n\nNo comments yet\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

Pot-hole counting is fast becoming my commute time-pass.\n\nSunday, August 15, 2010\n\nMy country, this calm morning\n\nIt is Independence day. I wish freedom and peace upon everyone.\n\nIt also happens to be the month of Ramzan, which is a month of self-restraint, self-reflection and charity. It would serve both occasions well if we could just retreat into ourselves for a minute or two everyday this month and think about what we want, what we say and do, and what we wish we could do - for our own lives and for our country.\n\nSome people clearly have been doing all of the above and the result is Project S.T.R.I.P. It is one of the few productions I've watched recently that is totally plugged into our times and the souls of the principal actors in situations of conflict in modern India. Often, we read about or watch events unfolding that leave us feeling stunned, or helpless, or both. And when this happens too often, it seems as if there is no longer any language or creative tools left to use against ourselves. But this project does precisely that - looks around itself with empathy, honesty and humour and then just tells an engaging story.\n\nI wish it were on somewhere on Independence Day, but I think it will be staged again next weekend. Do watch it if you get a chance.\n\nOn another note, I got the following message on email. I trust you all will do what you can:\n\n\"I was barely nine when my dear father committed suicide. My mother has worked really hard to send my brother, sister & me to school. She is still working hard to make our two ends meet... all she wants is ONE OLD MAGAZINE from you all, so she can make paper envelopes to earn & save environment... dear uncles & aunties, please-please do send us one old magazine every month to support us, so that we can go to better schools and live our lives with dignity and less suffering. My mother and other widow mothers like her will not hesitate to work hard to earn for us while saving the environment for the nation... I will be waiting with great expectations dear uncles & aunties for ONE OLD MAGAZINE from each one of you every month... If each one of you send one, it will become so many for my mother and other widow mothers to work hard to earn some amount every month... A very BIG THANK YOU from my brother, sister, my mother and me...\"\nour address:\nSupport 4 suicide farmers families\nHouse No: 200\nOpp: Dr. Harne's Hospital\nDhantoli Chowk\nWardha: 442001\n\nFriday, August 13, 2010\n\nZoro.n ka jhatka\n\nDear Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation\n\nYou must be reading a lot about malaria, pot-holes in Mumbai these days. We (you and I) are not quite Mumbai, which means that we don't get to read about our own malaria or pot-holes. I don't know if you've been counting. Your big sister across the naka claims to have only 593 potholes.\n\nThis is obviously a subject of much concern. Traffic was bad enough but these blighted holes slows traffic down to the point that people are willing to thrash other motorists and commuters lives become hellish because taxis and cabs refuse to go to high-traffic arterial roads. People with back and neck injuries can look forward to a worsening of their condition. The rest of us can look forward to developing spinal problems. This is nothing new of course. I remember a time, perhaps this was 2002, when I was reporting for Mid-day, when I rode pillion behind a photographer to go pot-hole hunting. Discomfort notwithstanding, it seemed exciting to zip around the city looking for mini-cirques along the way. If I tried to do it today, the bike probably wouldn't move from one mohalla, morning to night.\n\nSo I have been wondering just how many pot-holes we can boast of. I mean, we're growing faster than anyone can say 2BHK. We're not a village any more. We have malls, multiplexes, cars, arguments over parking space, famous burger places, three kinds of malaria... What more does a far-flung suburb want?\n\nOur autos, of course, are not quite urban. Even if I boycott them, I cannot claim to be doing 'meter jam'. No meter, what would I jam? (But I will write to you in more detail at another time.) For now, I want to tell you about this auto-fellow who refused to take me home. I wouldn't take 'no' for an answer. The man began to bitterly complain. He said he wouldn't go from the station to my home because the road was too bad.\n\nI flipped, asked him what he expected: Was I responsible, should I get down and begin patting down the road smooth for his majesty, why didn't his auto union do something about the bad road etc etc?\n\nAfter I had finished yelling at him, I began to count the number of jerks I felt which signified the number of pot-holes there were on that particular stretch, which includes Mira Road's MTNL road.\n\nI counted 63. On one stretch in one relatively new suburb, a ride that should taken five minutes actually takes nearly fifteen minutes, and 63 jolts to the spine.\n\nMind you, I am not actually counting every single pot-hole on that stretch. I just counted the number of times the auto had to lower a wheel into one of them.\n\nTwo days later, I counted again. This auto-wala was clearly not quite as skilled at skipping the craters. I counted 79, not including a small stretch at one end where I chose to walk.\n\n79, eh? We're not doing badly. And I must tell you, I was counting small conglomerations of pot-holes that have effectively led to the disappearance of tiny bits of tarmac in-between as one single hole, because the 'jhatka' I felt was too diffused and drawn-out to be counted and attributed to separate holes.\n\nSo based on the experiences of this monsoon, I have a few suggestions.\n\nOne, let us hold MUSSJAR contests for autos. MUSSJAR = Mumbai and Surrounding Suburbs Jhatka Avoiding Race. This will raise the morale of the drivers and teach commuters how much skill is involved. You can safely sponsor the prizes. I am sure our local boys will win.\n\nTwo, let us have a Pot-hole Princess contest. Some people have already given the title to Mumbai. But I think it should be a fair contest between suburbs. Pot-holes are a game of chance but we stand a good chance of winning. You could institute a special prize for maximum number of pot-holes on a one kilometer stretch. MTNL road is a strong contender. This would draw welcome media attention to your commissioners and other senior officials. If you do this, I promise I be there with a bouquet for you - a hundred and one roses.\n\nThree, after this monsoon, why don't you hire a specialist contractual firm and have all the roads dug up. Evenly, neatly, undeniably dug up. In effect, I am proposing that we have kuchcha roads instead of pucca ones.\n\nThe thing is, as I mentioned, in places where there are so many holes that the road itself disappears, one does not feel too much of a jhatka. The auto (or car) starts to feel like a cookie sliding across a bed of custard-jelly. It is slower but actually safer than a series of spine-threatening holes.\n\nBesides, if no road remains, then no pot-holes will remain and that takes care of mosquitoes breeding in stagnant little pools all over the place. There might be some criticism of such a measure, particularly from car-owners, but do not be afraid. There is nothing more important than health. You can ask them to choose between smooth rides and cerebral malaria. That ought to shut them up.\n\nThe auto-walas, I'm sure, will not mind. You can tell them that Mira-Bhayandar has decided to rethink its urbanization strategy, since they refuse to adapt to metropolitan, professional norms of public transport, which include functional meters, and where drivers aren't twelve-year olds, nor carry more than three passengers. If they protest, perhaps we can come to some sort of compromise. We give you pucca roads; you give us metered rides. You get my drift?\n\nMy fourth suggestion regards traffic policemen. Now, I've been living with you for a decade almost and have never, ever, spotted a traffic cop working outdoors. There is supposed to be a lady constable posted on duty near the auto-stand at Mira Road station and she is much-needed there. (More about that in another letter.) But except for that, no traffic cops in sight. Do we have any? Where are they? Mumbai traffic constables have set a good example by taking on pot-holes themselves. Your big sister wasn't much shamed by their intervention, it seems. You might as well go a step further and requisition of our local traffic cops to map, control or neutralize pot-holes, or supervise the effective elimination of tar roads.\n\nIn the event that you choose to ignore my suggestions and instead go on patching the broken roads, season to wet season, please learn from your big sister's mistakes. She spent Rs 100 crore last season when it didn't rain that much. Rs 100 crore is a lot of money. Where did it wash up? Nobody can tell thus far, but poor Jayant Patil tried. He took some officials out on a spin to remind us all that wherever Rs 100 crore disappeared, it certainly wasn't slicked firm and fast over the city's motorable surfaces. Not even on the airport runways.\n\nThis year, BMC spent another Rs 20 crore. It might go up to Rs 40 crore. She still gets 60 complaints a day. 60 new pot-hole complaints every day! We cannot match that level of complaint, of course, because in Mira-Bhayandar, people are used to keeping their heads down and are far too busy trying to get into trains to be able to complain about anything.\n\nBut please treat this as one. A major complaint.\n\nMy final suggestion: It would be great if you could get a list of contractors along with the specific roads they worked on. If their work did not last even three monsoons, I suggest they be black-listed from all future projects, particularly those involving public infrastructure and public funds. Because that's our money. Ours, which basically means mine and a million people like me. Actually, it's ... (truncated)",
