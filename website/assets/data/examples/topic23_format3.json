It is also recommended that any individuals feeling sick or who have come in contact with anyone who tested positive for COVID-19 stay away from parks and playground equipment.

Each person in J-2 status must have his or her own DS-2019. If you have dependents and would like them to join you at some point during your stay at NYU, notify your department of this when you are asked for information for your visa application.\n\nOnce in the U.S., individuals in J-2 status are permitted to apply for work authorization from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nIf your dependent has no plans to work and no intention of staying longer than three months, the B-2 (tourist) visa or the Visa Waiver Program is a fine option for visiting you in the U.S.\n\nJ-1\/J-2 Health Insurance Requirement\n\nAll Exchange Visitors (J-1) and their J-2 dependents are required to maintain health and accident insurance coverage during the entire time they participate in an Exchange Visitor program. See the Health Insurance Requirement section for more information.\n\nB-2 Classification for Cohabitating Partners\n\nThe B-2 status is appropriate for a cohabitating partner or significant other who is not eligible for dependent status under the principal scholar\u2019s nonimmigrant visa classification. This is true for both opposite and same-sex partners. B-2 classification may also be used by a spouse or child who qualifies for a dependent status but for whom it may be inconvenient or impossible to apply for the proper H-4, J-2, or other derivative visa.\u00a0\n\nIf such individuals plan to stay in the United States for more than six months, they should ask the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for a one-year stay at the time they apply for admission into the U.S.. If needed, they may thereafter apply for extensions of stay using Form I-539, in increments of up to six months, for the duration of the principal alien's nonimmigrant status in the United States.\n\n\nOGS sponsors two programs especially for spouses of international students and exchange visitors.

        "text":"Obtaining Your Passport\n\nIn general, your passport should be valid for at least six months after the date you will be returning from your expedition. If you do not have a passport, or need it renewed, please begin procedures to obtain one immediately as the process takes time.\n\nPassport agencies of the U.S. Department of State are located in Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Stamford, Connecticut. In other cities, you can apply to the clerk of a federal, state, or probate court or at selected post offices. If you are unsure where to apply, inquire at the office of your town clerk or county clerk, or at the main post office.\n\nBe sure to specify your departure date on your application in order to get expedited treatment. This is very important \u2014 passports are processed in the order of departure date. Application forms that arrive by overnight services do not receive expedited treatment.\n\nLoss or theft of a valid passport is a serious matter and should be reported in writing immediately to Passport Services, Department of State, Washington, D.C., or to the nearest passport agency. If you are abroad, it should be reported to the nearest U.S. consulate or embassy. We suggest you make a photocopy of your passport and carry the photocopy with you. In case of loss, this will help expedite the paperwork for obtaining a new one.\n\nFor more information on obtaining or renewing your passport, along with a current list of associated fees, please visit the U.S. Department of State:\u00a0\n\nTraveling with Children\n\nMany of IE\u2019s nature travel expeditions are great for families and children. If you are traveling with children, there are certain legal departure and arrival requirements. Minors under 18 years of age traveling out of the United States with someone who is not their parent (a grandparent, for example), or with only one parent, must carry a notarized permission letter signed by both parents or by the parent not traveling with the minor child. In case of divorce, the permission letter must be signed by the parent with legal custody, and the passenger must carry proof of this fact (such as a divorce decree). In the case of a minor with a different last name than the accompanying parent(s), the child\u2019s birth certificate must be carried by the parent(s).\n\n\n\nVarious vaccinations are required for travel. Please reference the Travel FAQ section for your selected journey for complete details. Be sure to consult your personal physician and visit the Center for Disease Control for vaccination suggestions. Visit\u00a0www.cdc.gov\u00a0for more information.",
