I really ought to post something.\n\nOver the past week I seem to be getting more than the usual number of \"My, you're big! How far along?\" comments. I didn't think there'd been a super drastic change, but of course when one is oneself all the time, slow changes can go unnoticed. I'm due in August, so I'm officially in the third trimester by now; it only gets more waddly and awkward from here.\n\nDeuce (as I shall call her here unless\/until thinking of a better pseudonym) has also begun squirming in more uncomfortable ways. She hasn't picked a favorite rib yet, like Una enjoyed pushing against for the last month or two, but I think it's only a matter of time for her to grow up enough to reach that far. Last night she just felt like pushing straight out a bit starboard of my belly button, as hard as she could. Which is getting to be pretty dang hard. also, ow.\n\nI am happy to be pregnant. I wish to be pregnant for exactly as long as I ought to be. But I will be really really happy to be done with it.\n\nPS: yes, apparently another girl. Sisters!

        "text":"Alexander Technique in London Blog\n\nAlexander technique - A five Minute Guide\n\nby Professor Paul Little\n15th October 2008\n\nProfessor Paul Little gives GPs a quick briefing on the technique and how his study found it helpful for chronic or recurrent low back pain.\n\nThe basics\nIt\u2019s an individualised approach that helps people develop the skills to recognise, understand and avoid poor habits of body use that affect their postural tone and neuromuscular co-ordination. We don\u2019t fully understand the mechanism but you\u2019d expect it to help by limiting muscle spasm, strengthening postural muscles, improving co-ordination and flexibility, and decompressing the spine.\n\nThe history\nIt was initially developed in the late 1800s by F Matthias Alexander, an actor who found that the way he was using his body had a dramatic effect on his ability to perform. It\u2019s widely used in drama and music schools and is increasingly finding a place in the health arena.\n\nIn August (2008) our group in Southampton published a paper in the BMJ suggesting the Alexander technique provides significant benefit over usual care for patients with chronic low back pain.\n\nWhat it involves\nThe teacher first demonstrates to people what they are doing wrong, using hand contact to observe and interpret subtle changes in muscle tone and co-ordination and to convey non-verbal information. This is integrated with oral and written advice to help the patient practise and maintain better body use.\n\nThe technique is an active self-help process, not a magic bullet. To make use of it, patients have to practise between lessons and also apply it in everyday activities.\n\nWho it helps\nOur study group was those with chronic or recurrent back pain. Although it might well help those with acute pain, our evidence only supports its use in chronic or recurrent pain.\n\nThe evidence\nBefore our trial there had been suggestive evidence from a small trial that the Alexander technique could help back pain in the short term, but there was no evidence of long-term benefit. But our trial provides robust evidence.\n\nIt involved more than 100 teachers working with patients from 64 practices, which suggests that the benefit is likely to be generalisable \u2013 not just the effect of a particularly enthusiastic teacher.\n\nOur study followed up patients over a year. We saw lasting benefits, with similar benefit being maintained at three months and a year for 24 lessons. There was a 45% reduction in the Roland disability score compared with the control group and a reduction from 21 days in pain per month in the control group to just three days. There were also benefits for a wide range of secondary outcomes.\n\nThe trial also supported the additional effect of a GP prescription for aerobic walking exercise (a 17% reduction in Roland disability score) so that six lessons and a walking prescription resulted in 72% of the effect of 24 lessons.\n\nAs far as I am aware, the Alexander technique is not available on the NHS \u2013 which until now was appropriate as there was not good evidence for its effectiveness.\n\nThe best way for patients to find a bona fide practitioner is to use the Society of Teachers of The Alexander Technique Patients should be advised to find a teacher that is both good with their hands \u2013 in showing them what they\u2019re doing wrong \u2013 and can also provide clear verbal explanation and instruction.\n\nIt\u2019s probably unrealistic to expect any of the principles to be usefully employed in a 10-minute GP consultation.\n\nExperienced teachers need to assess patients\u2019 problems individually, since the pattern of misuse will vary from individual to individual. Only a fully trained teacher will have the subtle assessment skills required and be able to provide nuanced, individual advice.\n\nOur trial discovered some useful books \u2013 Illustrated Elements of Alexander Technique by Glynn Macdonald and Body Learning by Michael Gelb. These can support lessons but current evidence suggests the patient needs to have lessons to be helped.\n\nGenerally there are no contraindications \u2013 but it\u2019s important any serious underlying pathology is assessed and treated. If the problem is chronic or recurrent functional low back pain with no red flags, then the Alexander technique is suitable. This is not to say that the technique could not help cope with and manage pain from no matter what source \u2013 it is just that we excluded cases where there was a serious underlying pathology.\n\nProfessor Paul Little is a GP in Romsey and professor of primary care research at the University of Southampton. His wife became an Alexander technique teacher after finding it helpful for chronic back pain, leading to his interest in formally studying the technique\n\nMy story: The story of my lower, middle and upper back pain. Part 1.\nI started visiting my excellent teacher Briar Maxwell once a week for lessons. With hindsight I now realise that if I had visited her 3 times a week to begin with I would have made speedier progress, but once a week it was.\nIn my first lesson I remember the most extraordinary expansion and release in my back. It happened whilst I was on the table and it felt as if the central section of my back moved and spread out to the sides of the table, which undoubtedly it did. A sensation never felt before accompanied by a deep sense of relaxation and a pain-free back. I also remember Briar asking me to look out of the window and listen to the sounds - of builders and birds, cars and buses. I thought this was a strange thing to be asked to do, but slowly I came to realise its importance as part of an active non-doing process, getting me away from my end-gaining habits and allowing my system to operate freely.\nIncidentally and importantly I discovered some time later that my first lesson with Briar was also the first lesson she had ever given after graduating as a teacher. The amazing effect it had on me was a result of her excellent training by Jean Clarke, I believe, among others, and the powerful fundamental qualities of the Alexander Technique.\nAt some time in my early lessons she lent me a book by FM Alexander, his third to be published and the most approachable, called The Use of the Self. I was captivated by his account of the experiment he performed on himself over many years. Here at last was a pure scientific experiment, with no known or pre-conceived outcome, being described and the subject was his whole being, his whole self. The absurdity of my metaphysical grounding struck me, and I was hooked\u2026\n\nMy story: The story of my lower, middle and upper back pain. Part 1.\n\nI have always been passionate about wood.\n\nSo much so that in 1984 I set up as a furniture maker and in 1990 I had the good fortune to find a wonderful workshop in Kennington- an old stable yard- and thought that my future was mapped out, and the only twists and turns would be in the grain of the wood I worked.\n\nHowever during my early 20\u2019s I had a series of crises with my back (which were straightened out by an osteopath) . This lead to a search for a cure and a way to keep my back strong and able to carry out my physically demanding job.\n\nI attended years of yoga classes, then later many tears of Tai Chi. I swam, had massages, cranial osteopathy, acupuncture and continued to suffer back pain..\n\nI enjoyed the classes and the treatments very much, but I always remember, as I was walking home, thinking: \u201cBut what do I do now?\u201d I experienced a hollow sense of not knowing something important, but I had no idea what it was.\n\nThen one day I was talking to my neighbour from my balcony. After a while she said her neck hurt and could I come downstairs to continue the conversation. Then she told me of a profound experience she had had with an Alexander Technique teacher friend who had simply moved her head and arms and legs very gently, as if doing nothing very much, and she had felt the most enormous relief from her pains.\n\nSo I had a lesson and experienced my own immense relief from pain. As I walked home after the lesson I suddenly realised that the pain was completely gone and I knew, at last, what to do: Go back for another lesson and discover what this Alexander Technique was all about\u2026",

        "text":"Tell me a story: A metaphor for understanding\u00a0analogies\n\nStart here, with this TEDtalk-\n\nI like to use a story or analogy to explain things to patients. \u00a0It helps me come into their world and attempt to contact them on their own turf.\n\nIt\u2019s not that patient\u2019s are dumb, and can\u2019t understand concepts or facts and figures. Stories are just a great way of conveying information. Adriaan Louw points out that when we are little children we have stories read to us (Aesop\u2019s Fables and the like) that illustrate points, morals and teach concepts. You listened to\u00a0the story and you got the point to that story, so it starts very young.\n\nWhen you are on a cruise or on a bus or meeting people for the first time at a restaurant, why do you tell stories?\n\nYou don\u2019t just list off characteristics\u00a0about yourself, no no no. \u00a0You tell a story, you don\u2019t break down a bullet point list of things, likes\/dislikes\u2026 you tell a story and other people grab inferences and understanding about you from the tales.\u00a0Telling it in a story is how humans want to hear things. \u00a0It\u2019s how we digest it, take abstract thoughts and put them in places of understanding.\n\nThis is similar to wanting to experience something vs. just hear about it. \u00a0Implicit vs explicit memory, if you will.\u00a0That experience is better than reading something in a book, because experience is living a story. \u00a0You learn in a different way\u00a0and it\u2019s more impactful and longer lasting. And that\u2019s the same with patients.\n\nNow I hear clinicians talk about \u201cReleasing this\u201d and \u201cActivating that\u201d and, boy those things are just fallacies\u2026 unless they are simply metaphors or analogies to help with understanding. \u00a0(it is likely that neither the patient nor clinician knows what is actually happening, so everyone could use a little metaphor!)\n\nThere are certainly other ways to help convey ideas during interaction and patient education (such as the Rhyme as Reason effect), but stories are often all you need to make a connection.\n\nSome good resources are below:\n\nDr. Robert Sapolsky \u2013 This is your brain on metaphors\n\nMichael Chorost \u2013 Your brain on metaphors\n\nMike Stewart (on PhysioMatters Podcast) \u2013 Metaphoric Expression\n\nDr. Lorimer Moseley \u2013 Painful Yarns and Explain Pain\n\nPTBT posts Hey, where is that pain from?, \u00a0\u00a0Your Hyper-Vigilant SWAT team, \u00a0\u00a0Understanding parts of the whole, \u00a0\u00a0The central sensitization wind-up, \u00a0\u00a0Active vs Passive treatment, \u00a0\u00a0The goose vs the gander \u2013 case report vs systematic review,\n\nThis stuff works. \u00a0It is born out in research that explaining pain helps reduce the pain, if it can be understood. Heck, Mirror Therapy is the ultimate analogy to the brain when treating a person with CVA!\n\nSo try to make it make sense to your audience, tell them in a context\u00a0they are familiar with. \u00a0The ideas will have a better chance of sticking and we will all\u00a0learn something.\n\nMatt D\n\n(Yes there is a difference between metaphor, analogy and simile! I know I mix them around- please understand the point of my post)\n\n4 thoughts on \u201cTell me a story: A metaphor for understanding\u00a0analogies\n\n  1.

What if you were perfect just as you are and there was nothing to change? How would things be different?\n\nMindfulness is being able to identify your own baggage on the carousel, claiming it, and knowing what is inside the suitcases. When do you open those suitcases and take out your clothes of anger, depression or anxiety and put them on? It is not asking other people to carry your bags for you. It is learning to observe yourself, having a sense of humor about yourself and learning that you are not your thoughts. Once you get to the place where you are no longer reacting in an unconscious way, you can start leaving those empty bags behind, knowing that you will have whatever you need wherever you go.\n\nCrazy people can only drive you crazy if you give them the keys...I have no idea who said this, but I try to remember it each and every day...whether it is the person that cut me off in traffic, the unhelpful person at the other end of the phone or a friend or family member who is not acting in a way I would like. You are the only one you have any control over...don't hand those keys to anyone else!!\n\nMeditation, even the idea of it, was something I used to loathe. When I first started going to yoga classes, I would dread the end of class when we were supposed to meditate or do a collective \"om\" chant. I felt inadequate and stupid because I could not keep shopping lists, kid problems,my to do list or any number of things from crowding into my head. I have now learned to still my mind and focus. I am not perfect at it by any means, some days are better than others and some days it seems useless to even try. But when I do get it there is nothing else like it and it is a worthy goal, this ability to be still and \"just be\". A lot of people don't like the idea of sitting still...I say fine! Take a meditative walk...there is no reason you cannot practice the stillness in your mind while your body is moving. At the very least it is a great way to start the process. First, you have to unplug...take your walk without your phone or music, your dog is fine! Then try being exactly where you are on the walk. Use all your you smell anything? How do your feet feel hitting the ground as you stride along? How does your body feel as you move? Is there a breeze? Is it cloudy? Is the sun shining? What noises do you hear? Are you warm, cold, sweating? Simply pay attention to everything around you and your reaction to all the stimuli you encounter. This is a form of you find your focus wavering from the here and now, gently bring yourself back to moment, to where you are right now. It is a great way to start what can be a daunting exercise AND you get the benefits of a walk too!\n\nMy fabulous girlfriend Tanya told me recently that fear and excitement are the same emotion. Your body reacts in the same way...your blood pressure rises, your breathing quickens, your eyes dilate, adrenaline rushes in. Fear has often threatened to keep me from doing things I want to do, even things I am passionate about (like starting a counselling business!). The idea of choosing to be excited about something instead of fearing it changes the game entirely. I always have a choice about how I feel regarding when I am scared of doing something, I am going to try to remember to choose excitement instead of fear!\n\n\"What is essential is invisible to the eye, it is only with the heart that one can see clearly . . .\" - Antoine de St. Exupery, \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfection is defined by others.

        "text":"\n\n*disclaimer* This might be \u201cranty.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a vegan. I\u2019m a vegan with an eating disorder. There! I said it.\n\nWell, okay. I\u2019m 100% vegetarian, and a \u201crelaxed\u201d vegan. I eat vegan the vast majority of the time, but I will make occasional exceptions (like, for example, the fun size reese\u2019s pieces that I\u2019m having right now).\n\nI went vegetarian at 16, when my eating disorder was active. I will be honest and say, yes, of course my e.d. influenced that decision. My e.d. influences many, many decisions. It influences, for example, what I put on in the morning. Does that mean I shouldn\u2019t wear pants? Of course not! B\/c even though my e.d. might influence what pants I put on, I also recognize the fact that there are many more important, practical, clear, logical reasons to cover up my bottom half today \u2013 the weather, public indecency laws, comfort, boundaries, etc. Plus, I just want to wear pants. Probably my cords. Ed might try to influence the decision, but ultimately I am going to wear my cords (whether Ed likes it or not) for reasons far beyond my e.d.\n\nAs probably many eating disordered people can tell you, when you have an eating disorder, it influences a HUGE number of decisions \u2013 big and small \u2013 that you make throughout the day. It\u2019s the all-encompassing nature of the disease. Does that mean my decision to wear my cords today is ALL ABOUT, or even primarily about, my eating disorder? Of course not. That would just be silly!\n\nAnd I know that food choices are different than pants choices. Food seems more central to an e.d. because that is the symptamotology. Though, I would argue that clothing\/size\/body image is also very much impacted by an e.d. But, yes, I understand that they are not the same.\n\nWhat is the same is the fact that, though my choice to go vegetarian may have been influenced by my eating disorder \u2013 as so many decisions are \u2013 it was not the primary reason I went vegetarian, nor is it now. I went vegetarian initially because I love animals. I love them. I knew that I personally would never be able to slaughter an animal, to take its life, to eat it. When I really thought about this, it seemed unethical to me for me to allow someone else to do that in my name. As I learned more about the meat industry in the US, my ethical decision to be vegetarian was reinforced. Then, as I became Quaker and pledged to live in accordance to non-violence, I saw vegetarianism as in line with that too. So, the reasons are actually logical, rational, and very clearly line up with what I believe. It seems that I have an eating disorder AND *gasp* reasonable, clear, healthy, competent reasons for being a vegetarian.\n\nAnd, yet, over time, I had it drilled into my head (by books, by doctors, by family members, by some e.d. professionals and activists) that an eating disordered person who is vegetarian *must* be using it to restrict. So, during one of my early periods of recovery, I gave it up. I stopped being vegetarian. I thought I needed to give it up in order to recover. Though I recognize that this may be the case for some people, personally, I regret this choice. My weight skyrocketed above my set point. I felt sluggish. I wasn\u2019t digesting well. And, mostly, I felt like I was living a lifestyle that went against many of my core values. After about eight months, I switched back to being vegetarian. I missed it too much. I missed the lifestyle. And after switching back, I felt so much better emotionally, mentally, and physically. AND I had the medical tests to support it \u2013 my weight gradually went back to my set point, my iron levels actually went UP, my vitamin &\u00a0 minerals were coming from my plant-based diet rather than a tablet, my protein was in a realistic range that my body could use, rather than sky-high like many people\u2019s. My energy came back. I slept better. For my personal body, it seems, vegetarianism is the way to go.\n\nAnd yet, I still get flack for it a lot of the time. I get things like, \u201cYou lost weight because you\u2019re vegan.\u201d No. Dead wrong. I lost weight because *I have an eating disorder.* Let\u2019s not confuse the two. They\u2019re not necessarily synonyms. I also read things with alarming frequency that are skeptical at best and downright disapproving at worst in their assessments of vegetarianism in people with eating disorders. I keep thinking that people will realize that assuming vegetarianism is about restricting is unfair. And yet, it keeps coming up time and time again.\n\nThe book \u201cGaining\u201d is the most recent thing that I read, which is what inspired this post. I had heard so many good things about \u201cGaining\u201d \u2013 that it is progressive, that it is insightful \u2013 and, in many ways, it is. Until the lauded example of the e.d. dietitian who, when confronted w\/ a vegetarian client, would \u201ctest\u201d them by asking what animal rights organizations they were part of.\n\nREALLY?!!!! This is where I almost hurled (involuntarily) all over the book\u00a0 in Border\u2019s. First of all, people choose vegetarianism for all sorts of non-eating disordered reasons that may or may not have to do with animal rights. Second, REALLY?!! Are we going to tell a a client that she\u2019s not Christian if she\u2019s not actively going to church?? Are we going to tell a client that he\u2019s not against racism if he\u2019s not a member of the ACLU?? Are we going to tell a client we don\u2019t believe she\u2019s a feminist if she\u2019s not a member of NOW?? Are we going to tell a homosexual client he doesn\u2019t support gay rights if he\u2019s not a member of the HRC?? We don\u2019t all join groups to support our core beliefs. And yet, vegetarians somehow have to \u201cprove\u201d their vegetarianism is for the \u201cright\u201d reasons with this litmus test.\n\nI\u2019d like to suggest another approach. What if, instead of immediately creating an environment of skepticism and mistrust by interrogating a client\u2019s vegetarianism, e.d. treatment providers create a space of non-judgmental curiosity and trust that would encourage a client to open up about their reasons for vegetarianism? That way, a client who had chosen vegetarianism as a way to restrict (and, yes, of course I acknowledge that this happens) could ask for help from their RD and treatment team without fear of being told \u201cI told you so\u201d or being judged. Also, that way a client who was an ethical vegetarian could actually have support in having BOTH their ethics AND their recovery.\n\nYou know what the skepticism about vegetarianism in the e.d. community does accomplish? It\u2019s incredibly effective at keeping a lot of us out of treatment. I know a number of eating disordered vegetarians who won\u2019t see e.d. dietitians because they fear they will be questioned at best and condemned at worst. Last I checked, there were no IP programs that would support veganism. Some will support vegetarianism, though many won\u2019t. Most residential programs will not support veganism, and often those few that do merely \u201ctolerate\u201d it \u2013 be prepared to eat A LOT of peanut butter & jelly (not sure how this helps break repetitive eating). I know a number of people who have gone to residential programs (that shall remain nameless) and were told before admission that they could remain vegetarian, but upon arrival the rules changed (NOT helpful in any psychiatric treatment) and they were told that their vegetarianism was a means of supporting their eating disorder, and the RDs wouldn\u2019t work with them as vegetarians. I have seen them after discharge at my treatment center, wanting to switch back to being vegetarian, but they have had their own sense of self-trust undermined. Those who do switch back for healthy reasons, then have to restructure what they eat yet again under the guidance of the RD at my treatment center. Big dietary changes like this can be difficult for anyone, but especially for people in recovery, vegetarianism or not.\n\nPersonally speaking, I put off seeing an RD for quite some time last year because I did not want to have to battle over my ethics. Then, I found my current RD\u2019s description on my treatment center\u2019s website, and her bio said very clearly that she specialized in eating disorders AND was interested in vegetarian diets. I immediately made the phone call. If she hadn\u2019t had that statement on the website, I may never have found my way to my incredible treatment center. I have switched to being vegan while working with her, and it has actually been incredibly beneficial to my recovery. When I decided to switch to being vegan, my RD did ask me about it. Like I said, I do realize that there are people who use vegetarianism\/veganism as a way to restrict. So, yes, I think it\u2019s very important for treatment providers to have open and honest discussions with clients about their food choices, perhaps even at multiple points in treatment. And that\u2019s what my RD\u00a0 (who\u2019s not a vegetarian, for the record) did with me. When I told her I was thinking of switching to veganism, she asked me, with curiosity and compassion rather than judgement, about my reasoning. She asked me if and how I thought it would impact my recovery. I told her my reasons, explained my ethical views, my understanding of veganism and my recovery, etc. And she trusted that I was making reasonable, healthy, competent decisions based on my food politics and ethics. Because of that trust, I have had the benefit of an RD\u2019s guidance as I transitioned to veganism. And it has been so beneficial to my recovery. Often in the support group that I attend at my center, there are other vegetarians and vegans who inevitably at some point mention that they are so grateful to have found a treatment center and an e.d. dietitian who will support vegetarianism\/veganism. It has made treatment possible for many of use who had been met with with (and still often are met with) skepticism and mistrust when we have simply been trying to live a life in accordance with our reasonable, rational, mature, competent ethics and beliefs.\n\nDo any of you have experiences with this? What are your thoughts on the matter? How do we balance food politics and eatin... (truncated)",

My name is Zoe and I live in Hastings, East Sussex, with my son Harvey and dog, Milton. I have been fighting the fat for years but this time I am serious. I want to lose weight and gain health. This blog is about how I am changing my lifestyle so I can lose weight but not by just \"being on a diet\" but by making small changes to our lives so that as I lose weight, I gain health. I want my family to be healthy too and never have to struggle with their weight like I have. In common with many large people, I have gained and lost weight many times over the years. This time, I want to lose it and maintain a healthy low weight. I am interested in eating food that is nutrient dense and delicious and that appeals to children and adults. I do not eat animal products so follow a vegan diet. I try to use locally produced food supplemented with what I can grow myself. I support and try to use local farmers markets and farm shops. Another objective is to add more exercise to our days. It sounds so simple when I write it down :-)\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

Ah, the sleeping late, the pina colada by the pool, that great novel you\u2019ve been dying to read. \u00a0It\u2019s going to be great!\u00a0 We are feeling good because we are anticipating being happy in the future.\n\nDepending on our expectations, we can feel completely different about the same event.\u00a0 For example, how would you feel about that same vacation if you were anticipating getting food poisoning, sunburn or seasick?\u00a0 Chances are you would be filled with dread instead of excitement.\u00a0 You would practically have to hold a gun to your head to get yourself out of the house on the departure date. Same vacation, two completely different feelings.\u00a0 So our feelings about an event are determined by our expectations and our beliefs about whether we would be happy or unhappy.\n\nFor many of us, our happiness and our unhappiness are tied to events and our expectations about how we will feel about them. Our current state of mind is based then upon how we think we will feel in the future.\u00a0 When we anticipate being happy, we are happy already.\u00a0 But, the reverse is also true.\u00a0 When we anticipate being unhappy, we are unhappy already. So what do you imagine comes next?\u00a0 We try our best to create and control events so that we can have control over our lives, and how we feel.\u00a0 Our present is composed of imagining future scenarios.\u00a0 Even when we are enjoying ourselves, we are very close to the tipping point that can occur when things start to go downhill.\u00a0 The beautiful vacation is \u201cruined\u201d by bad weather, delayed flights, lost passports.\n\nWhen we link our happiness and our unhappiness to events, we\u2019re like helpless organisms rising and falling on the ebb and flow of life\u2019s circumstances.\u00a0 We end up spending\u00a0 our lives struggling to orchestrate the good things and avoid the bad things.\u00a0 Even when things turn out great and we get what we want, there\u2019s bound to be a tinge of discomfort around the edges.\u00a0 It\u2019s all so precarious.\u00a0 What if, we might ask ourselves.\u00a0 What if this goes wrong and that?\u00a0 How will I feel than?\u00a0 If the answer is \u201cunhappy\u201d in some way, our wants have turned into needs, and we have become addicted to success on some level. \u00a0Our happiness is contingent upon things happening just so.\u00a0 What if it didn\u2019t have to be that way?\n\nTo see how your happiness in connected to what happens to you, try this simple exercise.\u00a0 Imagine you just got fired. Imagine how you would feel about getting fired if you were planning on quitting and were anxious about what your boss would say.\u00a0 Alternatively, imagine how you might feel if you have three children to put through college and you are the only breadwinner?\u00a0 The same you, the same situation but two different sets of thoughts running through your head and most likely, two completely different reactions.\n\nClearly, there is no cause and effect operating between the event and your feelings. \u00a0It depends on what you bring to the event and especially, what you believe you will feel.\n\nYour beliefs about how the event will \u201cmake\u201d you feel is the sole determinant of your feelings.\u00a0 No event has the power to make anyone feel anything unless they believe it can.\n\nWe all have our reasons for believing we have to be unhappy, but if we are willing to discard the notion that unhappiness is necessary, we open the door to deep understanding of the true causes of unhappiness.\u00a0 When we are willing to question unhappiness instead of accepting its inevitability, we infuse simple questions like, What are I unhappy about \u2013 with life-changing power.\u00a0\u00a0 Have you ever really questioned your unhappiness in a non-judgemental, loving way?\u00a0 Imagine what that would be like to ask the question, Why am I unhappy without blaming circumstances or events.\u00a0 When we blame circumstances or events, this question is a dead end question.\u00a0 \u201cBecause I lost my job\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBecause I got poison ivy\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBecause I am alone on a Saturday night!\u201d\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t you be unhappy?\u00a0 But when we don\u2019t blame circumstances or events, the question becomes open-ended and our answers are deeply personal and meaningful.\u00a0 \u201cBecause I won\u2019t be able to pay my bills\u201d\u00a0 And what is there about that,that you\u2019re unhappy about?\u00a0 Because if I can\u2019t pay my bills, I will lose my house, my car, etc.\u201d\u00a0 And what is there about losing your house, you car, etc. that you would be unhappy about?\u00a0 And so on and so until we can go further and have identified the real connection between the event and my unhappiness.\u00a0 Which may be something like,\u00a0 I will have proven that I am bad for myself (to have allowed such a thing to happen.\n\nThat is why it is possible to get very good at drilling down through the feelings to find out what we are really believing about the situation.\u00a0 Beliefs about unhappiness tend to operate behind the scenes until we bring them into the light and question their validity.\u00a0 Sometimes these beliefs have been operating since we were young children.\u00a0 We adopted them from our parents or other role models and simply never questioned them.\u00a0 Beliefs that are not questioned are held as truths, but once exposed, we have the ability to ask ourselves, Why do I believe that?\n\nTo your happiness,\u00a0 Wendy Dolber\n\nTake advantage of low early bird rates for our upcoming Supercharge Your Coaching Practice: Transform Emotional Roadblocks into Happy Productivity.\n\nHappiness is the feeling of freedom to the nth degree.\n\n[ Bruce Di Marsico ]",

        "text":"Helaina Jackson's blog, India April 2019\n\nBy Helaina Jackson, Specialist Dietitian\nI have been working at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge for over 3.5 years, initially as a newly-qualified dietitian before deciding to specialist in head and neck cancer.\nPre-qualification, I completed a degree in Food and Nutrition while working in a nursing home in my home town Bangor, Northern Ireland. Here I had the privilege of looking after many residents with different illnesses ranging from Huntington\u2019s disease to epilepsy and learning difficulties. These experiences cemented my desire to work with people and feel like I am making a difference.\nEvery person can make an impact and create positive change. In truth, my main driver in life is helping people, whether that is through my career or in my personal life; I enjoy \u201cgiving back\u201d. Both the Rama Foundation and my employer, Cambridge University Hospital Trust has given me a wonderful opportunity to visit India and use my skills in educating and supporting both schooling and hospice communities.\nA lot of work has taken place in the background together with lovely colleagues in preparing for our volunteer trip. This includes collecting unused supplements from patients who no longer need them, planning itineraries, getting visas, travel injections, fundraising, developing talks and evaluations. I have learnt so much even at this planning stage. I have also watched Indian travel documentaries to give me an idea of what I can expect but I have a feeling that there are some things that I may not be able to prepare for!\nMy job teaches me something new every day and through my career and previous experiences, I have always thought that I have seen a lot in life. However, this experience will challenge me in a completely different way as there will be a lack of resources available. I hope this will allow me to reflect on what we do well at Addenbrookes and also help me to adapt to unexpected situations and understand barriers to change. This will help my future response to challenging situations.\nNotably I have already felt that I am actively developing my skills in project planning and management in view of the preparation work already completed for this project. What I am most looking forward to is meeting new people, sharing and learning from them. The one thing I know I will find difficult to the level of poverty I know I will be exposed to.\nFollow Helaina's personal reflections from her trip to India on @Jacksonhel1.",

        "text":"Thursday, September 7, 2006\n\nWussup, doc?\n\nBusiness Times p.B2\nThursday, September 7, 2006\n\nBy Moje Ramos-Aquino, FPM\nWussup, doc?\n\nLet me talk about a different level of trust.\n\nI just received a distress call from Dr. Joey Lape\u00f1a of UP-PGH. He said that they have 25 residency positions in their department every year. This is a four-year program. In previous years they were swamped with applicants for residency slots at the UP-PGH Department of Otorhinolaryngology, as many as 40 applicants for seven positions. They used to have the leisure of choosing the best and the brightest.And this is happening all throughout the UP-PGH system.\n\nThey never thought they would suffer from this. After all UP-PGH gives the highest pay among government training programs and, generally, more than what private programs give. Not bad in terms of remuneration that they would get for the amount of and quality of training they could derive from the residency programs at UP-PGH, where they get the greatest number of patients and a variety of cases.\n\nDr. Joey said, \u201cThis year, in fact, we had 12 applicants and six of them UP graduates. They were supposed to report for the pre-residency evaluation where they actually go on duty.\n\n\u201cWhen the actual day arrived for them to begin, only six showed up. This early, one quit. Only five decided to push through with their application. Where have all the other doctors gone? As we all know, some have decided to take up nursing and we know why.\n\nWhat worries me about all these is that UP-PGH is the hospital of \u201clast resort\u201d\u2014so-called, in the sense that people who can no longer be treated elsewhere end up at UP-PGH. Of course, some who could afford seek medical care abroad. Those who come to us do so mostly because of financial considerations and partly because of the available expertise. Given that scenario of what is happening to us in terms of the number of applicants it seems UP-PGH might not be immune from the mass immigration\/doctor drain infecting our healthcare system. Unfortunately, other smaller hospitals especially in the provinces have closed down or are in the process of doing so because of lack of doctors and nurses.\n\n\u201cSome fields are equally important, like anesthesiology. When the anesthesiologist leaves, what happens to the surgeons, obstetricians and other surgical fields? They can\u2019t do anything.\n\n\u201cWhat is alarming is that otorhinolaryngology is a high-profile field, a very desirable profession, almost an elite subspecialty; but there are now very few of us here in the Philippines, only 400 board-certified. Yet, there are not enough doctors and the remaining are not interested in our field. In the USA, it\u2019s very difficult to get into otorhinolaryngology.\n\n\u201cAmong the top 10 diseases in any age group are a few that require ENT specialists. The World Health Organization lists ear infections among the top five childhood diseases. The other four are diarrhea, fever, respiratory infections and convulsions. Respiratory infections also involve ENT doctors.\n\nThe very young and the very old are especially vulnerable and could suffer when we lose our otorhinolaryngologists. They treat everything that could go wrong with the ear, nose, oral cavity, throat, head and neck.\n\nWussup, doc? Dr. Joey Lape\u00f1a and UP-PGH trust that you would heed their call. I trust that you will honor your Hippocratic Oath and serve us, your fellow Filipinos, here.\n\nNo comments:",

        "text":"Living With Pain And Hope\n\nLiving With Pain And Hope\n\n\nHow do we find our way back into the world after an awful and painful life situation?\n\nAfter a divorce we wonder if we\u2019ll ever love again.\u00a0 After the death of a loved one, we grief so deeply and wonder if the blackening sadness and excruciating pain will ever go away? \u00a0Dealing with an illness, we question if we will be able to overcome our health challenge.\n\nWe come head-on into lousy circumstances, And we can choose our response.\u00a0 We receive something bad And we can determine what we make of it.\u00a0 We can\u2019t necessarily pick what we get but we can choose how we deal with it.\n\nResponsible \u2013 response +able = we are able in our responses.\u00a0 We may have little to no control over certain external happenings but we have control and \u2018ableness\u2018 over our responses to our happenings.\n\nThis awareness of our ability to do something with an adversity that\u2019s smacked us in the face can be the difference between succumbing or rising.\n\nAs Viktor Frankl (Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor; founder of logotherapy- therapy of meaning, and author of world renowned book, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning) famously stated, \u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u2014to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhen we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cBetween stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\u201d\n\n\nThis is where hope lies: in facing reality with all its misery and awfulness And in beginning to see a hint of a better future.\u00a0 This AND concept is mighty powerful.\u00a0 We embrace both.\u00a0 \u00a0This AND opens the door to possibility and responsiveness.\n\nWhen we live with the AND\u00a0we are more resilient. \u00a0\u00a0When no longer know our world, as tragedy has covered it over with the blackness of terror, \u00a0we can bring in some hints of the familiar to sustain ourselves until we see our way back out into some light.\n\n\nMy daughter\u2019s year-long hospitalization was the scariest and most difficult period in my life.\u00a0 I knew I had to be there for her for every step of the way \u2013 \u00a0through the darkest period of not knowing whether she would live or die, to the first signs of possible survival, and then through a long and wrenching rehabilitation period.\u00a0 I was very aware that I had to keep myself intact, both psychologically and physically. And so I chose to embrace practices such as daily walking that I hoped would keep me strong and healthy.\u00a0 \u00a0I needed to maintain my proactive position as constant watchdog, cheerleader and advocate during this long haul of her medical crisis.\n\nI felt broken And I knew I needed to be strong for her.\u00a0 One did not preclude the other.\u00a0 They were both true.\u00a0 \u00a0I cried and I walked.\u00a0 I cried and I fell into a deep healing sleep.\u00a0 I was terrified of her dying and I walked putting together eulogies in my head.\n\n\nWe must hold the pain, feel the pain, be realistic with it all and when we can, choose our responses.\u00a0 In this way, we are not simply a receiver of circumstance but a creator of something more. \u00a0With choice and responsiveness, with the smallest of steps and goals, we carve out a path, even one towards closure before dying; and we begin to enter the light of hope \u2013 finding our way back to the world in its newly configured way.\n\n\nWhere are you on your path from darkness to light? \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Sunday, October 2, 2011\n\n\n\"He who takes medicine and neglects to care for his diet wastes the skill of his doctors.\"\n~ Chinese Proverb\n\nI recently read an interesting article on the topic of childhood obesity. \u00a0To be honest, it proved way more disturbing than inspiring. \u00a0I'm a foodie, for sure. \u00a0I love a good meal and I get excited about eating specific foods. \u00a0And, sometimes, if I am being completely honest with myself, the promise of a delicious treat is all that gets me through a miserable situation or the drudgery of a long day.\n\nBut, back to the article. \u00a0Did you know that we live in the (supposedly) wealthiest nation, yet we have the highest rates of obesity (both childhood and adult)? \u00a0Interesting, huh?\n\nAlso, this is the first generation of children with a lower life expectancy than that of their parents. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Disturbing, right?\n\nHow did this happen? \u00a0When did our society begin eating, as I call them, \"fake foods\"? \u00a0You know them, the artificial sweeteners (aka chemicals) rather than real sugar. \u00a0What?? \u00a0Are you kidding me?? \u00a0Is it really worth the 15 calories to cut the natural stuff and supplement with the cancer causing, molecular genetic altering agents? \u00a0Apparently so. \u00a0\n\nSomehow it also became completely legit to fill our foods with preservatives, as to ensure they last for years and years. \u00a0Take Lunchables, for instance. \u00a0Does it seem reasonable to give a developing child a chemically laced meat product, packed with calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and an \"artificially sweetened\" juice pouch? \u00a0Again, the answer is yes. \u00a0For $3.49 one's child can indulge in an edible chemistry set. \u00a0Woo-hoo! \u00a0May I suggest some whole-grain crackers or bread, a few pieces of roasted chicken or turkey, a cube or two of real cheese, and a cup of water? \u00a0Cheaper and real- but pish-posh. \u00a0It's all about convenience, right? \u00a0\n\nProtein bars. \u00a0Vitamin Water. \u00a0Fiber enriched fruit snacks. \u00a0Yea, real natural- note the sarcasm. \u00a0\n\nI don't want to give you the wrong idea. \u00a0I'm certainly not the perfect person, and my diet is far from organic. \u00a0But I do try. \u00a0I make a sincere and honest effort to eat natural, chemical-free, and real foods. \u00a0\n\nI just finished making Tabouli- my lunch for the week. \u00a0It's not fat-free, but it is free of chemicals and preservatives. \u00a0It's not packed with flavor enhancers or artificial sweeteners. \u00a0But it is full of flavor, lemon juice,\u00a0Bulgar\u00a0wheat, olive oil, cucumbers, tomatoes, and parsley. \u00a0And, I love it.\n\n\nGreta said...\n\nThis makes me sad because I'm almost positive I'm killing my kids with food. I am not in the worst category but I claim ignorance because I am exhausted and definitely choose what is easier than what is healthier sometimes. And my kids aren't picky.\n\nPlease send menu for the week. I can then attempt to try if I don't have to figure out the planning and research. :)xo\n\nMaria said...\n\nI have to say....I cook healthy for my kids. They make good food!?!??! I let stress get to me and I eat healthy, then garbage....ugh. At least I can say, I pack my kids a healthy lunch each day and I have not had a school lunch since before Thanksgiving!!!\nThanks for the inspiration!\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"Protein & Carbs \u2013 How Much Should I Be\u00a0Eating?\n\nThere is a lot of confusion about how much protein and carbohydrates to eat.\n\nAccording to the Harvard School of Public Health adults should get a minimum of .8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day. That\u2019s about 64 grams for a 160 pound adult.\n\nIn the U.S. adults get an average of 15 percent of their calories from protein. Replacing the sugar in our diets that we get from refined carbohydrates such as white bread or drinks filled with sugar by increasing our protein intake to 20 to 25 percent could actually reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nAnd if your taking that amount of sugar out of your diet. Can you imagine what it will do for your waistline?\n\nGood sources of protein include chicken, fish, eggs and lean meat.\n\nCarbohydrates. Wow! What a bad rap this food group has gotten.\n\nMan cannot not live a healthy lifestyle without carbs! So how much?\n\nThe AMDR (Acceptable Micronutrient Distribution Range- amount that the FDA considers healthful) is 45 to 65 percent of total calories.\n\nBefore you get all excited about this know that we are not talking about foods that have added sugars.\n\nThe carbohydrates you should be eating are fiber-rich fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n\nFor more Health and Fitness information please visit our ongoing blog at\n\n\n\nTags: , ,\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"To the Man Who Doesn't Believe I Need a Service Dog\n\nTwo years ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, agoraphobia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. This year I have been diagnosed with POTS, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. My family and I decided that one of the best options for my treatment was a service dog to help me with my panic attacks, my night terrors, and to give me emotional comfort when out in society. Being 14 about to turn 15, I was not in favor of having a Labrador retriever or something similar in size because I didn\u2019t want that kind of attention. So we agreed a Chihuahua would work best for me.\n\nWe trained her for a year and a half, and she has since been simply perfect at her job. We have started training once again so she can learn to work with a wheelchair, as I now need one because of my POTS. I understand that because she is so tiny, at first it might be hard to believe she is in fact a service dog. But if you casually watch us going about our daily lives, you can see and judge by her behavior and not her size.\n\nI am assuming (but I\u2019m not sure) that you, sir, did not watch us for even a second before you so rudely told me I looked healthy and there is no reason for me to be dragging along my \u201cservice puppy\u201d \u2014 your words, not mine. I told you that she was not bothering anyone, and she has every right to be by my side in the store. Before you could say anything else, I turned and walked away. You, sir, have absolutely no right to make that assumption about me.\n\nYou have not seen me at my worst, when I wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air because just a second ago I was convinced I was being attacked all over again. You did not see me when I stood up from the bathroom floor, only to fall unconscious again and have no way to call for help because I couldn\u2019t get up and risk fainting again. You are not there for me on the days I can\u2019t even lift my head from my pillow because it would cause me immense nausea \u2014 but she is. She brings me a bottle of water to swallow my anti-nausea pills when I can\u2019t get out of bed. She comforts me in the middle of the night when I can\u2019t breathe from the terror of the nightmares. She fetches my cell phone for me so I can call for help without risking my life.\n\nPlease, I ask you to keep your thoughts to yourself about all of these \u201cunnecessary service puppies.\u201d These dogs are in fact very helpful to a lot of us with chronic illness or disabilities. You do not see my struggles. Just because you can\u2019t see my disabilities when I\u2019m at the store, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there.\n\nWe want to hear your story.

        "text":"BS2018 \u2013 RD6 Monday\n\nCategory: Injuries\n\nPain 2\nMobility 5\n\nI managed my first outing yesterday by car, Nicole drove me to the gym so I could spend a few minutes with my girls and all in all it went pretty well. I am stable on my feet mostly due to the fact that my leg was already improving before I went under the knife. That said, my stamina is in the toilet and I am not sure I could spend more than an hour on my feet at this point. Other things to note, the pain is very localized to the incision but can still hit the pain meter at a respectable 5 or 6 when I move awkwardly. However, when I am standing still like I do to write these posts there is barely a perception of pain other than a dull ache across my low back and my leg. I still don\u2019t have any feeling in the medial side of my leg from mid thigh down to the ankle. The strength is coming back very slowly but it\u2019s hard to push it at all when I have to be so cautious. These are the dangerous days though, the times when every day brings big improvements and my confidence in my ability starts to build again. These are the days for supreme caution.\n\nOn the technical side of things these posts aren\u2019t making it to facebook and I am not sure why. Twitter is getting them no problem but for some reason the connection to facebook isn\u2019t working. I managed to fix the issues with the gym facebook link, maybe I just need to update the plugin here too\u2026 After some digging around I find that Facebook has disabled direct posting from wordpress. Thanks jerks.\n\nIt\u2019s still early, 1045am and I am thinking of trying to reach Tim\u2019s today. It is about 2.2km away and after yesterday doing almost 1.5K I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the realm of possibility. It is day 6 and after surgery 2 I made that trip (albeit in the sunshine and warmth) on day 5 while still dealing with the remnants of drop foot which is probably the most scary thing I have ever encountered from these issues. Not being able to control my foot was terrifying to be honest and something I would never wish on anyone.\n\nIt is now 220pm, I went for a walk in the +4 balmy afternoon sun and although the terrain was a little iffy at times I managed a healthy 1.8km. I opted not to go to Tims although I walked very close by so I am firm in my conviction now that getting there tomorrow should be a piece of cake. The snow is melting which makes for a treacherous outing in places but once I can get out to Walmart to buy a new pair of winter boots then I will be all set. I know I should have probably done that before the surgery but it was the one thing left on my list. I will be visiting the gym again tonight, something that as a habit I need to reinforce even if I can\u2019t actually work yet. There is nothing worse then allowing yourself to plateau or become complacent in your recovery and although I don\u2019t mean to overdo things I also want to keep my foot planted gently on the gas pedal and ensure that my recovery and my stamina are increasing on the daily. My walk today was as fast as usual which is to say requires a calendar more than a stopwatch however I was not as fatigued. In the evening I decided to venture out to the gym to see my girls and see how my body would stand up to, well, standing up. I spent a couple of hours on my feet ambling around the gym talking and observing and at the time it felt OK. It was tiring I must say that, but it wasn\u2019t too painful and moving around even across the uneven surfaces was just fine. My leg although weak in comparison to my other is still just fine for walking on and with the exception of sharp hip flexor pain occasionally when I stand, it seems to be working. Tomorrow morning will be the judge of whether or not this was a good idea. I am going on what happened last time and if I am right then tomorrow morning I should feel a little sore but just fine. Time will tell.\n\nContinue reading \u00bb No comments\n\nBS2018 \u2013 RD5 Sunday \u2013 The Rollercoaster\n\nCategory: Injuries\n\nYou can live with dignity you can\u2019t die with it.\n\n-House, M.D.\n\nA side note first. I am glad I worked in a hospital for 21 years. It has given me an insider appreciation for what the medical staff go through on a daily basis. Having major surgeries gave me an appreciation for the end product but having worked inside those walls gave me the knowledge that every person who comes into your room be they custodial staff or department heads is there for one reason only and that is to support you in your journey to wellness So many patients don\u2019t fully appreciate the commitment that all the staff have you as a patient and the weight that they carry in the awareness of that commitment.\n\nYesterdays yellow alert had a very familiar feel to it, I knew I had seen and felt these symptoms before and after some diligent searching through my personal documents I found that indeed this had happened at almost exactly the same point after surgery 2. I had determined at that time that it was due not to the medication directly but to the fact that the medication had stopped up my system causing constipation and an inability of my liver to process enough waste. I am not sure that it\u2019s the truth, but there must be a combination of issues when you have to lay practically motionless for a few days, not eating or drinking much and taking high levels of medication. The fact is that just as quickly as it was here it is now gone, I am a perfectly normal colour again today, not even a shadow of yellowing in my hands and I am equally happy to report that the bathroom is no longer an issue with things progressing fairly normally.\n\nIt is currently 139pm and zero degrees with clouds, so I went for my walk hoping that snow would stay away and I would be able to make my goal for the day of 1.2km. I am not really bothered about my speed at this point, my walk is more for the development of my nerve pathways and the strength in my leg than doing anything reckless. However I am acutely aware that the human body is designed for movement, from the most delicate hands of a concert violinist to the gross motor developments of the powerlifter the essence of the human experience is movement. There have been very few mistakes in my life that I truly regret, however one of those was the underestimation of my ability after my first surgery. In some respects I feel as if I may never have had to experience 2 and 3 had I not screwed up my recovery after number one. That said, I do have degenerative disc disease so maybe that\u2019s an overstatement. But.. if there was one thing I could go back and fix in my past my recovery from surgery 1 would be high on the top 5 lists of things to do over.\n\nMy walk today was 1.33km surpassing my goal of 1.2 and at a blistering pace of 15 minutes per kilometre. My leg feels fine today although after the walk I can sense the lack of muscular development and the weakness sensation in my knee is something that will probably take a while to come back. However I am firmly in my seat on the rollercoaster now and the ups and downs are as close to any thrill ride you will find. I posted in my previous recovery (which, I am sure I have linked before but can be found HERE) \u00a0that day by day I felt like a new person. 2 days ago I couldn\u2019t face getting out of bed to use the bathroom and yet today I was gleefully able to sit in my recliner and watch TV while able now to walk up and down stairs like a normal person using both legs. The rate of recovery is staggering but it\u2019s also a double edged sword. In both my previous recoveries I have had relapses. One was painfully to admit my own fault and the other was an accident where I fell down and through the basement stairs tearing my leg up in the process. I am glad to say that I am firmly resolved not to have such episodes this time and I have resolved to maintain the mentality of a recovering surgery patient for the full 6 weeks until I see the surgeon again rather than behaving like someone who had a hangnail removed and can\u2019t wait to get back to the gym.\n\nI do have to say one thing here. This is my third surgery and for those of you who are concerned over my ambition to get better or my need to increase my activity I will say just this. Have spent my whole life being hyper aware of my body, be that due to being a fat kid or an elite athlete it doesn\u2019t matter what does matter is that I know myself all too well. Yes mistakes happen and judgements are sometimes off course but believe me when I say I am more than familiar with what it takes to get through recovery successfully. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate the concern because I do, but trust in me when I say that there is nothing more valuable to me than my health and the thought of one day being able to walk down the aisle with my beautiful daughter rather than have her push me there in a wheelchair. Of course I will be careful, of course I will take it slowly but I will also give my body what it requires as far as motion and nutrition in order to get me through this.\n\nWith that said it is time for a rest and some food so the dog and I will be on the couch with steak if you need us.\n\nContinue reading \u00bb No comments\n\nBS2018 \u2013 RD3\/4 Friday and Saturday\n\nCategory: Injuries\n\nPain 8, Mobility 2\nI woke up early, pain about the same and have already been ambling around the house trying to get some energy into my legs. It\u2019s really hard when every move you make causes intense pain and yet your desire to get back to normal requires that you do so. I haven\u2019t been doing much to be honest, I walked another 650m today but have yet to break 1km which I should already have done. Sadly I think I would have if it were summer and Tim Horton\u2019s was my intended destination. That said, I am trying to keep going and plan on hitting that 1k before Sunday night. Friday was uneventful but I have scaled back on the pain killers since my biggest fear is a repeat of the addiction I suffered after my first surgery when I was given enough percocets to fill a Christmas Smarties container (yes the ...

        "text":"Sunday, July 29, 2007\n\nSix Killers - A Series From The New York Times\n\nSix Killers\n\nThey are the leading causes of illness and death in the United States today: heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, in that order. And they have a lot in common.\n\nThey are expensive - together, they account for 25 percent of the nation's annual health care expenditures, said Jonathan Skinner, a health economist at Dartmouth College.\n\nThey come in clusters - accumulations of plaque in arteries lead to heart attacks but also can lead to strokes and predispose to Alzheimer's disease. Diabetes can lead to heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Smoking can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as cancer and heart disease, which in turn predisposes to Alzheimer's.\n\nAnd the outlook for them is improving - people are getting the diseases later in life, and death rates are falling.\n\nYet, in many instances, patients are undertreated or treated inappropriately. In some cases, science has not offered answers, but in others, the medical system has been unable to turn proven remedies into everyday care.\n\nFriday, July 27, 2007\n\nPain centralization: Does pain really burn itself into the brain ?\n\nMarshall Devor, Ph.D.\n\ne-News for Somatosensory Rehabilitation 2007, Tome 4 (Volume 1)\n\nIt is widely held that chronic pain is like a cerebral mountain gorge, carved into the landscape by torrents of pain flowing through it. This idea probably originated in the rich and colorful literature on amputation phantoms. Pain of peripheral tissue origin experienced in the limb prior to amputation is said to become \u201ccentralized\u201d, or \u201cburned into the brain\u201d, where it be-comes therapeutically inaccessible. The typical story is of a persistent painful lesion or a cramp in the leg. The amputee swears that the same pain can still be felt in the phantom limb after amputation. This is called phantom \u201cpain memory\u201d (Katz and Melzack 1990). But be-lief in pain centralization is by no means limited to phantom limb sensation in amputees. The concept has been applied to virtually all persistent pains that have the impertinence of refusing to go away (e.g. Kalso, 1997).\n\nA natural corollary of the idea of pain centralization is the belief that one should be able to prevent the transition of pain from acute (and treatable) to chronic (and intractable) by apply-ing analgesic modalities early and aggressively (Wall 1988). That is, if the pain of a periph-eral injury is stopped using nerve blocks or other analgesic strategies, the transition to a per-manent intractable form will be preempted. \u201cIf you wait, it will be too late !\u201d Unaccounta-bly, this dictum has attached itself with particular strength to certain specific chronic pain con-ditions, notably phantom limb pain and chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS, previously termed RSD, reflex sympathetic dystrophy), and much less so to other painful conditions such as headache or arthritis. Early, and not too well controlled attempts to capitalize therapeuti-cally on the idea of centralization raised hopes. Bach et al. (1988), for example, reported that dense presurgical spinal block would prevent the later appearance of phantom limb pain. Un-fortunately, larger and better designed studies failed to obtain this result (Nikolajsen et al. 1998; Nikolajsen and Jensen, 2001). In general, despite some reports of success, preemptive analgesia has not proved itself (Niv and Devor 1998; Moiniche et al. 2002).\n\n\nLike most other treatments ideas, the reality of pain centralization can only be documented in prospective, placebo controlled clinical trials, difficult as such trials might be from a practical and ethical point of view. Until such trials are carried out, we have essentially no compelling evidence that pain ever causes pain mechanisms to migrate from the periphery to the CNS. Indeed, there is a good deal of evidence that pain centralization does not occur. This comes from observations on chronic pain syndromes in which, unlike CRPS and phantom limbs, there are clear peripheral causes of pain and definitive treatments. For example, large numbers of patients suffer for years from painful osteoarthritis. But when hip replacement surgery is car-ried out, the hip pain is nearly always eliminated without leaving a centralized trace. Like-wise, the pain of childbirth does not persist for long after delivery, and the pain of a kidney stone typically ceases rapidly once the stone has passed. If pain centralization were in fact a robust and common phenomenon, every pain we ever felt would still be felt. In contrast to cen-tralization, pain of peripheral origin often does initiate a spinal amplification state that has been called \"central sensitization\". This is a transient phenomenon, however, and it fades away within minutes or hours after removal of the precipitating noxious event (Torebjork et al., 1992; Gracely et al., 1992). Although the terms sound the same, \"centralization\" and \"central sensitization\" are very different concepts. - Galerie - Schmerz-Ausstellung (Photographs from the Pain Exhibit, Berlin)\n\n\"Just because you are suffering doesn't make you Jesus\" by Nathalie Djurberg, 2005;kap_id=894&img_id=5472&sound=&slideshow=0\n\nExhibition: A painful pleasure : Article : Nature\n\nExhibition:\u00a0A painful pleasure\n\nStefan Klein\n\nArtistic and medical views of pain go on show in Berlin\n\nThree bodies writhe in agony. Their limbs are distorted, their features unrecognizable, their entrails burst out. The Crucifixion triptych by Francis Bacon (the central panel of which is shown here) had no religious meaning for the painter, for whom the work was simply about the expression of extreme sensation. In Tiepolo's painting of the martyrdom of Saint Agatha, the young woman's ecstatic gaze is thrown heavenwards as she awaits the blow of her tormenter's sword. These two paintings are the artistic highlights of the exhibition Schmerz (Pain), which runs until 5 August at the Medical History Museum of Humboldt University and the neighbouring Hamburger Bahnhof Museum in Berlin.\n\nThe exhibition brings together artistic and medical views of pain. Opposite Bacon's Crucifixion is a glass cabinet containing pathological preparations of organs. Under the title 'The pleasure of pain', Tiepolo's Agatha is displayed along with forensic photographs showing fatal accidents that occurred during masochistic sex. The borders between art and documentation begin to blur, which makes the exhibits all the more disturbing. Video interviews with people who self-mutilate, by German film director Valenska Griesebach, could easily be from the files of a psychiatrist. And what differentiates a display in a vitrine from a pathology lab or an art installation?\n\nThe exhibition aims to show pain in all its forms, rather than to understand it, and plays with superficial similarities between different depictions. A video by Bruce Naumanns in which a violin string is repeatedly plucked appears next to chattering patch-clamp recordings in the only exhibit that gives a nod to neurophysiological research on pain. That's not enough to justify the exhibition's claim to build a bridge between science and art. Rather, wandering through this labyrinth of abominations, the question that comes most immediately to mind is why Christianity really needed to glorify this most ugly of all human sensations into the pinnacle of mystical experience.\n\nNature 447, 262 (17 May 2007) | doi:10.1038\/447262b; Published online 16 May 2007\n\nThursday, July 26, 2007\n\nScratch No More: Gene For Itch Sensation Discovered\n\nScratch No More: Gene For Itch Sensation Discovered\n\nScience Daily Itching for a better anti-itch remedy? Your wish may soon be granted now that scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified the first gene for the itch sensation in the central nervous system. The discovery could rapidly lead to new treatments directly targeting itchiness and providing relief for chronic and severe itching.\n\nThe \"itch gene\" is GRPR (gastrin-releasing peptide receptor), which codes for a receptor found in a very small population of spinal cord nerve cells where pain and itch signals are transmitted from the skin to the brain. The researchers, led by Zhou-Feng Chen, Ph.D., found that laboratory mice that lacked this gene scratched much less than their normal cage-mates when given itchy stimuli.\n\nThe laboratory experiments confirmed the connection between GRPR and itching, offering the first evidence of a receptor specific for the itch sensation in the central nervous system. The findings are reported in Nature.\n\nChronic Headaches: Biology, Psychology, and Behavioral Treatment\n\nBy Jonathan M Borkum\n\n  \u2022 List Price: $64.95\n  \u2022 ISBN: 978-0-8058-6199-0\n  \u2022 Published by: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates\n  \u2022 Publication Date: 02\/13\/2007\n  \u2022 Pages: 584\nThis is the first new book in many years to provide a comprehensive review of the latest theory, research, and treatment of chronic headaches from a biopsychological perspective.

        "text":"With These Tips, Healthy Nutrition Doesn't Need To Be Uninteresting\n\nIt is not always easy to eat right. In fact, it is much easier to eat badly. The cheapest and easiest foods to make are usually the worst for you. However, if you have the time and the motivation, eating nutritiously should not be much of a challenge. This article will offer some advice to help beat that challenge.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids should be consumed for a healthy heart. These poly unsaturated fatty acids work to lower the triglycerides and increase HDL, the good cholesterol, in your body. Omega 3 fatty acids can also prevent blood from clotting inside your body. Studies also show that consuming Omega 3 fats can help to lower blood pressure.\n\nRiboflavin is necessary for a healthy diet. It is required by our body to help release energy from protein, carbohydrates and fats in our diet. Riboflavin boosts metabolism and processes iron. Whole grain products and dairy products have a high Riboflavin content.\n\nA great nutrition tip when you are trying to gain muscle is to make sure you're eating enough calories. You need to determine how many calories it requires to maintain your weight and then you must eat a bit more than that, in order to gain muscle.\n\nIf you are having trouble about what you should and shouldn't eat, consult with a doctor or friends. Sometimes it can be hectic to eat nutritious when there is so much information out there for you to read. Asking around can help you understand what it is you should be putting into your body to keep it running healthy.\n\nTo ensure that one has the best nutrition, careful thought must be given to one's diet. By eating more healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, and fish, one will have more positive nutrients in their diet. The proper diet is not beyond the reach of anyone if they have put the thought into it.\n\nTo improve the function of your liver, include plenty of tryptophan in your diet. Tryptophan is an amino acid that helps your body synthesize various proteins. It is essential to the production of niacin, which boosts liver health. Foods rich in tryptophan include salmon, turkey, and watercress. Tryptophan can also reduce anxiety levels.\n\nBeans are great nutrition source across the board. They offer a high source of protein, low fat content, and little to no sugar. This makes them quite versatile for dieters. There several types of meals you can make with beans in it that can offer a high quality of nutrition.\n\nPutting together a delicious smoothie can be enjoyable and fulfilling. The following tip will help you make an even more nutritious smoothie. Adding extras such as cocoa, which is rich in antioxidants, or flax seed oil, which is jam-packed with Omega-3s, will make it even more nutritious. Adding these two items can make smoothies tastier and give them extra nutrients for better immunity.\n\nUnless you are diabetic, avoid eating two to three hours before you go to bed. Do something to take your mind off food like putting away leftovers, washing the dishes, or cleaning your teeth. Finish your evening with a nice cup of herbal tea. This will help you to relax and get to sleep.\n\nIncrease your use of herbs and spices. Part of the reason \"eating healthy\" seems so unattractive is the perceived blandness of the food. The truth is, fat and salt are natural flavoring agents, so if you remove them you've got to start experimenting with herbs and spices until you've got healthy food that is full of flavor.\n\nTake the time to learn about sugars in your foods. It is important to know the differences in the various sugars you eat consistently. Sugars in fruits are better for you than sugars in sweets, yet can still be detrimental if you eat too much. Learn what is in your food so you can make the right decisions about the levels you take in.\n\nDiscover More Here\u00a0will want to watch out for any foods that are labeled \"fat-free\" or \"zero trans fat.\" Even though a food claims it is low in fat it could have tons of sugar. You must check the nutritional facts on the back of all packages to check for undesirable ingredients.\n\nIt's easy to assume that what you eat is healthy when it actually is not. Bread that is advertised to be seven-grain may not actually contain whole grain at all. Rely on the hard facts on the nutrition label rather than believing a food is healthy just because it says it's fat free.\n\nTo improve your health, limit your intake of unnatural foods. Cut back on processed foods and foods fried in oil. When you do consume processed foods choose ones made from whole grains. Whole grains are more nutrient dense than the alternatives and since it takes the body longer to break whole grains down, you stay full longer.\n\nTo keep your body feeling good and healthy, be sure to intake a balanced nutritional diet every day. Monitor what you are eating and consider whether you are in balance. A healthy daily diet should consist of fifty to fifty-five percent carbohydrates, fifteen to twenty percent protein and thirty percent fats.\n\nOne step to a more nutritious lifestyle is to cut out all refined flour from your diet.\u00a0collagen stretch marks itch\u00a0includes changing to whole-wheat pastas and breads.

        "text":"What would you give for a better body?\n\nFlickr: Tucia\n\nNow this is just silly. According to the BBC\u2019s website today, many men are unhappy with their gut. That\u2019s not the silly bit, I fully accept it and am not desperately proud of my own. Body image, the piece goes on to say, is no longer (if it ever was) an exclusively female thing.\n\nI\u2019m OK so far on that. I set up this blog with the idea of writing about and for men who were a bit concerned about their appearance but who feel that from early middle age we\u2019re a bit abandoned by the style mags and media in general. I have no problem at all with someone wanting to demolish the myth that fat is an exclusively feminine issue, that we don\u2019t care how we look, that we\u2019re as attached to the idea of being better as anyone else of either sex, regardless of orientation (I don\u2019t buy into the idea that self-image and dress sense are exclusively gay things, either).\n\nNo, the silly bit is where the BBC has fallen for a bit of spurious research. I hate spurious research and as a jobbing journalist I get plenty, believe me. I dislike it strongly when it actually gets coverage. This one is from the University of the West of England\u2019s Centre for Appearance Research (I didn\u2019t make that up) and it says \u2013 wait for it \u2013 35% of men say they\u2019d give up a year of their lives to have a better body \u2013 flat gut, more muscles in the upper body, you know the sort of thing.\n\nOh, really? They\u2019d give up a year of their lives? What does that actually mean, though? They\u2019d allow someone to come and shoot them a year before their allotted time, if that could be calculated with any certainty? They really wouldn\u2019t mind telling their family that healthy though they felt, they\u2019d made this agreement for a decent set of abs so it was now time to go off to Switzerland and face the end a bit earlier than absolutely necessary?\n\nIt\u2019s a ridiculous statement to make and frankly a stupid question to have asked.\n\nI have a much better one. If you or I were seriously that unhappy with our bodies that we felt we\u2019d shorten our lives to improve them, how come we\u2019re not shortening our days by half an hour or so to go for a quick run? Pair of trainers, shorts, t-shirt, 20 minutes or so a day before the usual shower, you think we won\u2019t see a difference if we combine it with less fat and sugar?\n\nOf course there are time constraints. There are families to look after, kids to prepare for school. There\u2019s always going to be something stopping a lot of us. Nonetheless, the idea that a third of men with an average age of 40 are so concerned that they\u2019d shorten their lives to get fitter (which incidentally is more likely to lengthen life) when in reality they can\u2019t find half an hour four times a week to do something about it is more than a little preposterous.\n\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cWhat would you give for a better body?\n\n  1. Thanks Bryan, I'm pleased to amend the name obviously. As to the second point, whether they'd sacrifice a year of their life and give it up to exercise doesn't seem to have been the question asked. If it was then the followup question \u201cOK, why haven't you?\u201d is an obvious next step.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"Wednesday, August 26, 2009\n\nIt's my BLOGY and I'll bitch if I want to!\n\nAnd the MRI shows once again....IT'S PROGRESSING!! I now have 12 lesions on my spinal cord ranging in size from 9mm to 74.7 mm. The doctor is worried because it is progressing so fast and I am terrified of life right now. I really don't know what is worse, the idea that this disease is trying to kill me or the idea that it may not succeed and this is the quality of life I have to look forward to.\n\nEvery time I am alone, I find myself having crying fits, which is highly out of character for me. I am not a crying kind of girl. But I can't seem to shake this sinking feeling. Each day this disease seems to get worse and worse. I never even thought MS was even possible until I was diagnosed last October. Then I was told it is relapsing remitting and it will go away and come back. Then I was told it's looking like secondary progressive and now I am being told it is progressing faster than should be possible. Neuro started me on Avonex, but already believes it is not going to work and has already planned to switch me to Tysabri in 6 months.\n\nAnd I am still not working, and I am at home feeling completely useless. I have no energy to do anything. I am now on Tramadol and Neurontin and Avonex and Ambien. I don't know if it is just the frustration of this stupid disease or the increasing symptoms or self pity or maybe even a side effect of the meds but I can't stop crying. I don't cry when my daughter is here and I don't cry in front of my fiance or my friends and family. And I am alone a lot lately now that my daughter is in school. Which leaves me time to think, and then I can't help thinking how the hell my life has turned into this and I lose it all over again.\n\nWhat sucks is \"You look so good!\" yet I feel like I am trapped inside of a torture chamber and I have no way to escape. You can't tell by looking at me that my legs are on fire you can't tell that it feels like my skin is trying to crawl away. You can't tell that I cannot see clearly out of my eye or that it feels like I have three knives sticking straight into my spine. You can't see the torture that my mind goes through when I forget a word, or I forget where I am going or why I walked into this room. You can't seem to comprehend my new phobia of stairs, or daylight, or driving long distances. The dread that washes over me when it's time for bed because I don't know how bad it is going to hurt to try to lay down and I have no idea what new torture my body will invent the next day. You don't get to feel what it's like to hook an IV into your arm and pump yourself full of toxins that make you pray for the mercy of death as you watch your body respond and you gain 9 pounds in 5 days. You don't get to experience the panic that takes over when you get so much as a sinus infection because you know your eyes are going to take the hit. But I LOOK great...when I'm not bursting into tears that is.\n\nThe depression is a real bitch. That is one of those side effects they warn you about but you just don't know quite how to prepare for it. And yes, I do realize how much worse it could be. And I am grateful that I can still use my legs, and I can still swallow and I can still get from point A to point B on my own. I do know that it could be so much worse, but that doesn't make it suck any less. That doesn't make the hopelessness fade any faster or the fear subside.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I am just going insane! That is what happens when you obsess over things. I don't think I have spoken to one person with this disease who doesn't obsess over it. It's not something I do on purpose but when you have something attacking your body and you feel the effects of it 24 hours a day you tend to think about it 24 hours a day.\n\nI just felt like venting!",

Licensed Diabetes Drug Could Dramatically Increase Human Life Span and China Unveils New Laser Weapon On State Television.\n\nBoth are actually kinda cool. The drug is one that\u2019s actually already on the market, albeit only for treating diabetes. But this means that they\u2019re already doing human trials. Who knows, in ten years, maybe this drug will be on the open market for the general public. The drug is supposed to combat degeneration in the body from natural age as well as some diseases. And that\u2019s awesome.\n\nTests on animals have also pointed out that the drug extends their lifespan and keeps the whole body healthier.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the lasers. Are we happy that China has them? Debatable. But don\u2019t worry, the US has them too. It doesn\u2019t look just like Star Wars, but it\u2019s all still pretty cool.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of a laser weapons system working:\n\nLong story short, we\u2019re edging towards the day when you\u2019ll live forever if you\u2019re not killed (by lasers).\n\nBut who am I to talk?
