        "text":"Are you thinking of becoming an online publisher to earn money through Google Adsense? Or you are already using Adsense on your website or YouTube? If your answer is yes, then you must read the below-mentioned top reasons why Adsense accounts are suspended. Prevention is better than cure, we all have heard this. But remember, in most of the cases when the Adsense account is suspended, there is no cure for it. So it is highly recommended that you make sure to follow the Google policy about Google ads when you are using Adsense to earn money through your site\/YouTube videos.\n\nClicking the Ads\n\nIf you, a bot, or anyone clicks on the ads that are running on their website, YouTube videos or app will be detected by Google and will result in account suspension.\u00a0\n\nSometimes, you want to click the ad to find out more about the product\/service being advertised. You should still not click on the ad. If you really want to see the ad, use --Google Publisher Toolbar--, which allows you to click ad on your own site to see the result, and without having the click counted towards spam\/invalid click activity.\n\nGenerating Artificial Impressions\n\nGenerating impressions both manually or through a bot will also get detected by Google and can result in account suspension.\n\nFooling a Web Surfer\n\nAlthough not a big crime but if you intentionally use wrong keywords on your page, which do not reflect the content of the page, this may also be detected by Google and result in account suspension.\n\nAsking Visitors to Click\n\nYou should not place text beside the ads like 'Please click here', 'support this site by clicking on the ad', etc. Encouraging the visitor of your site to click on the site is prohibited.\n\nGenerating Clicks by Accidental\/Forceful Clicks\n\nYou should not place Google Ads at a place on your site where the site visitor would accidentally or mistakenly click. For example deceiving visitors into thinking that clicking the ad will open the content, site menu or any other thing.\n\nFurthermore, ads must not be placed in such a way that would hide the content, and the visitor would have to click the ad before he could see the content.\n\nProhibited Content\u00a0\n\nGoogle does not allow placement of ads near content of the following type. Display of such content may lead to account suspension.\n\n  \u2022 Mature\/adult content. Find out what type of mature\/adult content is not allowed.\n  \u2022 Content on hacking\n  \u2022 Violent content.\n  \u2022 Content on weapons\n  \u2022 Content about alcohol or tobacco\n  \u2022 Content on drugs\n  \u2022 Content that talks against about a specific group, individual or organization.\n  \u2022 Content that sell prescribed medicine or that sell unapproved dietary supplements or pharmaceuticals.\n  \u2022 Content that asks the site visitor to click on the ads\n  \u2022 Content that promotes illegal activity\n  \u2022 Copyright content of any other website\u00a0\n\nEmbedding Ads in Software Applications\n\nGoogle ads should not be embedded in any software application. A Google ad placed anywhere on the application such as toolbar, application front end, etc. is prohibited.\n\nThese are the main and top common reasons why Adsense account is closed by Google. If you are already running Google ads on your website or on You Tube videos, or you are planning to apply for Adsense, make sure that you are not doing anything as mentioned above, to avoid account suspension.\n\nAlso Read:",

Get connected\nDon\u2019t feel like you have to be alone. Running your own business can be lonely and having other entrepreneurs and thought laders around you can really help to develop ideas and provide key support as well as a great sounding board for queries.\nThe FSB (Federation of Small Businesses) is a great organisation so check out @fsb_voice for more help and advice for Small Business.\n2. Get social!\nToday it is easier than ever to connect with peers online and join support groups and business development pages on social media. Be brave, sign up and get asking (and supporting) other small businesses. There may be someone out there that needs your expertise too!\nEnterprise Nation has great meet-ups and networking opportunities, search @e_nation on twitter.\n3. Money matters\nMake sure that you get good financial advice when setting up or running your business. Good financial planning, clear strategies\/forecasting and a good accountant can save a lot of sleepless nights and heartache.\nIf you want to find someone local to you with specific expertise, check out @ACCA_UK for your local member.\n4. It\u2019s all about me\nWhether you are a sole trader or have a small team, you need to look after you. It\u2019s tempting to take on all the roles and run yourself into the ground in order to move your business forward but as the saying goes, \u2018you can\u2019t pour from an empty cup\u2019. You are the most important asset for your business, you must look after your needs in order to run a business to the best of your ability.\nMarketing and social media\n5. Make a plan\nPlanning is key for a marketing strategy. Don\u2019t create an unrealistic plan as this can be demoralising and leave you feeling defeated. Set yourself small simple goals and these can be increased as you see success. It may be a target number of followers on Facebook, a specific number of sign-ups for a newsletter or exhibiting goals.\nIf you need help with a marketing plan, check out Marketing by Minal\u00a0 @Minal2804\n6. Be where your customers are\nIt may sound obvious but with so many social media platforms it can sometimes feel very overwhelming and like you have to be everywhere at once! Find the social media platform that most speaks to your customers, most people are on Facebook so that is an obvious start but you may consider other platforms like Instagram if your business is creative or particularly visual. Do some research and see where your customers are visiting.\n7.Aim for relationships not just sales\nBuilding strong relationships with your customers will mean that they are more likely to be a repeat customer and share their good experiences with others. Micro businesses are all about the people at the very heart of them. Be brave and put yourself, your passion for your product\/service and your business into all your interactions to make sure you stick in their minds for exceptional customer service.\n8. Keep in touch\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask someone for their contact details. Mailing lists have a bad reputation but used carefully and compassionately they can be a great tool to inform your customers, advise them of great offers and let that personality shine through. Similarly, every day we come across opportunities to network (especially if you produce a wearable product), always make sure you have a supply of business cards and details you can pass on.\nIf you need more help with your marketing, one of our fab small business community Karen Campbell could help you. Check out @k_c_marketing for some great blogs, advice and tips.\n9. Have a good name and logo.\n\u00a0A strong brand is easily recognizable. Recognition starts with the name of your business. The name will appear on your business cards, letterhead, website, social networks, promotional materials, products, and pretty much everywhere in print and online to identify your company or your company\u2019s products and\/or services. People commonly associate brands with the brand\u2019s logo. As you think about your logo, keep your audience and products\/services in mind because you want your logo to reflect your company. A good logo builds trust and a strong logo will help to pull your brand together.\n10. Find your brand voice.\nWhat you say is important, but don\u2019t overlook how you say it. Your company\u2019s \u201cvoice\u201d is the language and personality you and your employees will use to deliver your branding message and reach your customers. Successful brands speak with a unique voice. Think about the brands you admire \u2013 what makes them unique? How do they communicate with you and other customers? What do you like about their voice?\n11. Deliver value for your customers.\nValue doesn\u2019t mean lowest price. You can focus on product, great customer service , delivery of service, or a combination of those things. When thinking about the value your company delivers ask what sets your product or service apart from others with similar products\/services. A personable company with an excellent product are strong emotional drivers for a customer to purchase.\n12. Create a personality.\nWhen you are deciding on how to brand your company and \u2018voice\u2019 it sometimes helps to think of it as a person. Analysing that character\u2019s beliefs, likes and dislikes, where they live and what their lifestyle is like. This will help you find your target customer and solidify your brand.\nOne of our favourite personalities is Alison Edgar from The Entrepreneurs Godmother, go to @aliedgar13 to check her out!\nSmall Business Saturday provides help and support for all Small Businesses throughout the year by providing workshops, webinars and informative content.\nSmall Business Saturday UK also highlights small business success and encourages consumers to \u2018shop local\u2019 and support small businesses in their communities.\n\nInterested in writing a Blog Post for Small Business Saturday?

        "text":"\n\n4 different types of company culture explained\n\n5 min read | 7 February, 2019 By Sarah Benstead\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to drive your business forward, building a strong company culture is a necessity \u2013 and getting it wrong can be a very expensive mistake. And many businesses have come to realise this after being faced with serious issues with employee retention, productivity and engagement (to name a few).\n\nSo, focusing on your people might be a high priority on your list, but how can you even begin to think about developing your culture if you haven\u2019t the faintest about where your business stands right now?\n\nThe Competing Values Framework, a cultural assessment tool coined in the 1980s established four types of company culture. In this blog post I will be exploring each of these and looking at key characteristics along with the benefits and fall-backs that each of them carry.\n\nWhich one\u00a0sounds most like your business?\n\nFour common types of company culture\n\nClan culture\n\nOtherwise known as \"family culture\u2019\" a clan culture is friendly, upbeat and is made up of employees who have a lot in common with each other. The task of building and maintaining a strong company culture consistently stands as a top priority along with focusing on employee wellbeing.\n\nLeaders of clan cultures are hugely respected and are often perceived as mentors or father figures. These leaders drive team building, employee involvement and empowerment. Business goals and company values are commonly shared by employees across the organisation, resulting in one streamlined universal vision and employees who are invested in the company\u2019s mission.\n\nBy coming into a business that boldly demonstrates a clan culture, employees enjoy a harmonious and tranquil working environment and are given the trust and freedom they need to thrive in their roles. This type of culture is typically more common among start-ups as it helps to establish a collaborative mindset where all ideas are welcome.\n\nBut, adopting a clan culture has its risks. By encouraging a social and fun environment you\u2019ll be running the risk of losing the work\/fun balance and the office lacking authority. Additionally you could be handing your staff an open opportunity to slack and become disengaged in their roles if you provide them with too much freedom. Monitoring is key in order to fully reap the benefits of a clan culture.\n\nBreathe Culture Pledge Badge-02-minSerious about your company culture? Join the Breathe Culture Pledge today and commit to putting your people first.\n\n\nAdhocracy culture\n\nDerived from the latin word ad hoc, meaning \u201cfor this\u201d, adhocracy culture revolves around innovation, success and flexibility. This type of culture is often found within modern industries such as aerospace and technology. Businesses with adhocracy cultures are constantly thinking ahead and developing new products as they live by the assumption that all of their products only have a limited shelf-life.\n\nThe office environment is very creative, energetic and fast-paced. Leaders of an adhocracy culture are true entrepreneurs; they consistently encourage risks to be taken and push employees to experiment with new ideas. Adapting quickly to changing conditions is the norm in an adhocracy culture so that latest trends are reacted to and concentrated on.\n\nBut, working in an intense and fast paced environment can take its toll. Employees may find the atmosphere in the office chaotic and disorganised and they may struggle to clearly understand their responsibilities. And, with innovation and risk-taking coming first, the health of the business can face a direct financial impact too if brave experimentations don\u2019t quite go to plan.\n\nFor a good example of adhocracy culture in action, you only need to look as far as Facebook, where according to Mark Zuckerberg, you should \u201cMove fast and break things\u201d. He says that \u201cunless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough\u201d.\n\nMarket culture\u00a0\n\nAnd then there\u2019s market culture. First becoming popular in the 1960s, market culture is ruthless, strongly results driven and performance orientated. Employees are encouraged to set difficult goals for themselves and work hard to achieve them and leaders are tough and demanding. Market share and profit at the forefront of the business focus at all times.\n\nAdopting a market culture is rarely accidental, in fact it is something that is often deliberately integrated within the company in order to ensure that business objectives are a number one priority. It\u2019s all about the company\u2019s bottom line and financial growth with less of a focus on teamwork and community.\n\nWhilst building a market culture most certainly brings benefits for business health, including optimised return rates, overtaking competitors and high employee motivation and engagement, it has its downfalls. And they can be pretty big.\n\nWith employees being pushed on a daily basis to maximise their performance and hit difficult targets, the competitiveness can often be taken too far and lead to dishonesty and conflict in the office, which you as an employer will need to step in and deal with. This friction may even result in team members who are disconnected from their work, a slump in productivity levels, and in serious cases a financial hit to the business.\u00a0\n\n1 in 5 UK workers quit their jobs due to poor company culture. Explore how company culture affects productivity, performance and wellbeing in The Culture Economy Report 2020.\n\nHierarchy culture\n\nThe most traditional type of culture, hierarchy culture revolves around structure, control and \u201cdoing things right\u201d. The working environment will be extremely organised with well-polished policies and procedures. Keeping the business running smoothly is key.\n\nUnlike in a clan culture, there are strict rules, and leaders are likely to be keeping a close eye on what employees are doing. There are several layers of management between leadership and employees, many more than that in other cultures, and leaders are highly respected by their teams.\n\nThis type of culture is the most historical and goes back as far as the mid 1900s. Imagine your typical large bureaucratic company, such as McDonalds \u2013 they're more than likely to be accurately demonstrating a hierarchy culture.\n\nThe benefits speak for themselves with hierarchy culture; there are little or no issues with authority and boundaries are clear. Responsibilities are allocated by job level and lines of communication are seamless.\u00a0\n\nHowever, with a strict, \u201cby the book\u201d culture comes its drawbacks. With power sitting at the top level of the business, a business leader may find that they are too absorbed in everyday decision-making to invest any time in their people. Employee one-to-ones may not happen as frequently (or at all) and appraisals are dropped down on the priority scale.\n\nThe structure of a hierarchy in itself can cause issues, too. With the sole decision-makers further up the business ladder, communications become slow and time-consuming, which can prove problematic in fast-moving, dynamic working environments.\n\nYour company culture matters\n\nWhichever type of culture your small business falls under, it\u2019s important you get it right. Our research found that poor workplace culture is costing the UK economy a staggering \u00a323.6 billion a year due to low productivity and poor employee retention.\n\nAnd, because every culture works differently, assessing and identifying your business' culture is a great place to start.\n\ncompany culture - try it for free\n\nPosted on 7 February, 2019\n\nBy Sarah Benstead\n\nin Company Culture\n\nTag Company Culture\n\nSign up to get the latest HR and people management insights straight to your inbox",

        "text":"5 Useful Advantage of Human Resource Management\u00a0(HRM)\n\nWhat Is HRM?\n\nHRM is the organizational function that deals with issues related to people such as compensation, talent acquisition, talent assistance, talent development, performance management, organization development, safety, wellness, benefits, employee motivation, communication, administration, and training. So, the focus of HRM is to deal with the manpower and all the decisions related to it that can have an impact on the productivity.\n\nAdvantages of HRM\n\nAn organization cannot build a good team of working professionals without it. Let\u2019s have a look, how HRM is contributing in the current scenario:-\n\n1. Helps Evaluate HR Policies : \u2013 HR policies help keep employees on the same page and streamline the day-to-day operation of the business. Without these policies, employees might get confused about the company\u2019s culture and expectations, resulting in a chaotic work environment.\n2. Helps in building culture and values in the organization : \u2013 A safe and clean work culture helps in bringing the best of an employee and creates a higher job satisfaction.\n3. Helps in Recruitment & Training : -This is one of the major responsibilities of the HR team. The HR team comes up with plans and strategies for hiring the right kind of people. They design the criteria which is suited for a specific job description. When needed, they also provide training to the employees according to the requirements of the organization.\n4. Performance Appraisals : \u2013 HRM encourages the people working in an organization, to work according to their potential and gives them suggestions that can help them to bring about improvement in it.\n5. Developing Public Relations : \u2013 The responsibility of establishing good public relations lies with the HRM. They organize business meetings, seminars and various official gatherings on behalf of the company in order to build up relationships with other business sectors.\nDisadvantages of HRMThis makes your HR functions quick, but it doesn\u2019t always make them better. In fact, your company can run into serious problems if you forget that employees are more than numbers and symbols on a screen.\n\n1.\u00a0Employee Privacy : \u2013 Your employees entrust you with personal information. Everything from Social Security numbers to private health information and marital status gets stored in your HR management system\n\n2. Cost : \u2013 One of the disadvantages of these systems is their cost, for different users it will cost different. Installation, setup and consulting can cost more.\n\n3. Difficulty of Analysis : -Your system can contain so much data that you may find it difficult to analyze. You may need a separate analysis system just to sort the data into meaningful chunks.",

        "text":"AT&T T-Mobile merger\n\nIt's starting to look like the AT&T\/T-Mobile merger may not go through, which is a great boon for American consumers. But that doesn't mean T-Mobile will just go on like before. If the merger fails, the carrier's parent, Deutsche Telekom, will probably go shopping for other buyers that won't incense the Department of Justice quite so much.\n\nThere aren't that many companies in the market for a $39 billion wireless carrier, but they're out there. Here are some of my assessments of the top competitors; feel free to disagree in the comments below.\n\nThey Won't Buy It, But You Had To Ask\n\nSprint. Let's just take this off the table. Sprint doesn't have enough money to buy T-Mobile, and anyway, if Sprint is spending a lot of money on anything, it will be sorting out its complex relationship with Clearwire. Sprint has also been burned before when trying to integrate a technologically dissimilar network (Nextel's), and the government is pretty clear that it doesn't want to see a reduction in national competition from any T-Mobile sale. All signs point to no.\n\nApple. Ever since before the first iPhone came out, people have been speculating about whether Apple would finally give iPhone owners a true end-to-end Apple experience. AT&T's service has always been the least-liked thing about the iPhone in the U.S., and actually running a telecom network could let Apple show the world how cell phones are supposed to work. This is unlikely to happen, though. Apple doesn't tend to make big acquisitions, and the company has historically stayed away from providing \"pipes\" on its own.\n\nGoogle. Unlike Apple, Google is toying with being an ISP in Kansas City, KS. And its purchase of Motorola has shown some desire to emulate Apple's end-to-end model. But I don't see this happening either. Google's successful Android business relies on it not competing with its customers, and becoming a wireless carrier would make conversations with AT&T and Verizon just too uncomfortable.\n\nWho Might Really Buy T-Mobile\n\nComcast, Time Warner and Cox. Cable companies have toyed with becoming wireless networks for years now, with most of their efforts ending up in semi-failed partnerships with Sprint and Clearwire. But now Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-Verse are moving in on their core turf, which means the cable guys really need to fight back. None of the cable companies may have the money to buy T-Mobile on their own, but they've shown a willingness to band together in the past. A bonus: They already own some wireless spectrum.\n\nAmerica Movil. Why should the New York Times be the only American icon rescued by Carlos Slim? Owned by the richest man in the world, America Movil is the world's fourth-largest mobile operator and already has a foothold in the U.S. through its ownership of Tracfone\/Net10\/Straight Talk. If T-Mobile is indeed America's value player, it could have some synergies with America Movil's existing offerings. Also, Slim loves telecom.\n\nWind Telecom. This Russian-owned mega-carrier recently invested in a new Canadian carrier called WIND Mobile that runs on the same spectrum and technology as T-Mobile USA. A purchase of T-Mobile would increase its economy of scale and vault it into becoming a true global force across several continents. Wind also owns major carriers in Russia, Egypt and Italy, among other places. Watch for the Congressional hearings that would result when a \"valuable national security network\" is bought by a bunch of Russians who also happen to operate a cell-phone network in North Korea.\n\n\"Investors.\" Their names don't matter, and they usually don't mind if they stay out of the news, anyway. The deep-pocketed VC crowd will take a gamble on anything they think can make money. T-Mobile USA's profit has been declining, but it's still a profitable business, and maybe there's someone out there\u2014say, an ex-carrier executive\u2014who thinks he can run it better than DT has done.\n\nFor more, see the slideshow above.\n\nFor the top stories in tech, follow us on Twitter at @PCMag.",

It is the glue that holds together the functioning of teams, partnerships and managing relationships. (Up and down, peer-to-peer, internally and externally). Respecting the right to differ is a concept like apple pie and motherhood. We all agree with it \u00a0but can we truly foster it?\n\n\nThe first step is to identify the specific areas of difference. Many people see things in terms of rights and wrongs. \"My way\" is right and therefore \"other ways\" are wrong. When a situation is viewed through this lens, a power struggle ensues. When, however, a situation can be seen through the lens of difference, and a position is simply a matter of opinion not fact, then cooperation and compromise is possible. Identifying and understanding differences allows people to shift their position to one of compromise and negotiation. \u00a0The following steps are the roadmap to success:\n\n\n\nOnce you understand the above you can use the following list to avoid power struggles, which drain energy from your effectiveness. \u00a0Here is our top 10 list for type of differences to look for.\n\n\n1. Communication Styles. All people do not communicate in the same fashion. There are many inventories available to identify differing styles. Once you understand a person's style, this knowledge can lead to respect not conflict.\n\n\n2. Non-Verbal Communication. All forms of communication must be considered. This form of communication is more covert, but not any less important. Non-verbal communication includes; body language, and tone. \u00a0Non-verbal communication may differ from the verbal. \u00a0With this additional understanding of what is really being communicated more effective collaboration is possible.\n\n\n3. Learning Styles. People learn in different ways. When this concept is in the forefront of understanding then communications can be geared to various styles and will meet with greater success.\n\n\n4. Differing Values. This concept can be a little tricky. While values need to be identified and respected, there are times when conflicting values can be so different that they cannot coexist on the same team. When mutually exclusive values are encountered, collaboration is not recommended.\n\n\n5. Boundaries. We all have different space needs and boundary needs. (Boundaries are the limits you place on the behavior of others around you.) \u00a0The first step is to be aware of peoples' boundaries and then to use this understanding to approach them respectfully. This new behavior often avoids conflict and strengthens relationships.\n\n\n6. The Self. Self-respect is a vital and primary building block that supports the formation of relationships. By being aware of your own needs and styles you create a healthy foundation and the ensuing relationships are more solid.\n\n\nThe remaining categories are variations on the theme of Cultural Differences. The need to understand, respect, and integrate diversity is a must in today's market.\n\n\n7. Company Culture. Seasoned employees have come from different companies and each company has a culture. This must be identified and respected in order to insure successful integration into the current company. This concept is especially pertinent to mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n8. Culture of the Country. With the global nature of our business, employees often come from different countries, each with a different culture. In order to successfully integrate multicultural differences, these differences must be understood, articulated, and respected.\n\n\n9. \u00a0Family Cultures. The influence of our backgrounds is great. Often we ignore these differences because they \"do not belong in the workplace\". \u00a0However the reality is that people cannot keep who they are out of the work environment. \u00a0The key here is to recognize when the source of the conflict is based on someone's family\/personal issues. This allows you to choose not to engage in a battle that is based on their family history. \u00a0\n\n\n10. Individual vs Team. Balancing the individuals needs with team needs is always an interesting dilemma. However, if this healthy balance is not reached, problems are certain to follow. \u00a0Taking the time to identify and then address both individual and team dynamics are at the core of this balancing act. \u00a0Business success is directly related to getting this right.\n\n\nConflict Management\n\n\nGetting Groups to Agree\n\nOther Tips & Tools\n\nSupporting articles\n\nFREE Exploratory Coaching Sessions\n\nLearn more",

        "text":"Take Your Mixes To The Next Level\n\nWednesday, March 4, 2015\n\nThe 5 Ways To Charge For Your Musical Services\n\nCharging For Services image\nIt's always tough to figure out how much to charge an artist or band that's not on a label for your services. Here's an excerpt from my Music Producer's Handbook that looks at the 5 different ways to charge a client for your production, engineering or musical services, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\n\"What if a local band asks you to produce or record them? What do you charge if they\u2019re not attached to a label? There are a number of approaches that you can take, although none will have you retiring to the Bahamas anytime soon. You can:\n  \u2022 Charge a flat project fee. How much should that be? So much depends upon the type of project, how many overdubs you\u2019ll need, the artist\u2019s or band\u2019s competency, the artist\u2019s or band\u2019s income level, and the number of songs. A jazz or blues band with 20 songs will usually take a lot less time than a pop band with 8 because of the type of music and the layering normally required with pop music. And if the band has a marginal player or two, that can almost double the time spent just trying to get the parts to match the other players in skill level (unless you can persuade them to use a session player.)\nUsually, a flat fee is the least desirable way to get paid since projects have a tendency to go a lot longer than anticipated and will tend to drag on and on when the artist realizes that you get paid the same regardless of the time spent. If the flat fee is the easiest way or only way to get the gig, then that\u2019s what you have to do, but otherwise, avoid it if you can unless you\u2019ll very well compensated.\n  \u2022 Charge a per-song fee. This is better than the flat project fee but not by much. All the same problem areas are still there with the exception that it can sometimes cause the artist to scale back from recording 15 songs to 10 (even though it\u2019s a hit in your pocketbook). You won\u2019t have to worry about the artist wanting to record an extra song at the last minute or suddenly wanting to complete a track originally deemed too weak after basic tracking. With a per-song rate, any additional songs and you have to get paid.\n  \u2022 Get paid on spec. This is the way that most fledgling producers start their careers. The deal would be that if the artist or band \u201cmakes it\u201d (meaning they get signed by a major label and get an advance), then you\u2019ll get paid either your project fee, points, or both. The chances of that happening are always long no matter how much you believe in the act, so be prepared to spend your time working for free. The one good thing here is that you\u2019ll be gaining experience.\nIf you\u2019re going to work on contingency, you\u2019ll need to get two things from the artist or band. The first thing is a larger deal than your normal rate to make it worth your while, since you\u2019re specing your time. That could be anywhere from 20 to 50, even 100% more - whatever you can negotiate. You can justify it by saying, \u201cI\u2019m providing a lot of valuable time and expertise that you\u2019re not paying me for right now. Maybe it\u2019ll take a long time to see this money or maybe I\u2019ll never see it. That\u2019s worth an extra premium.\u201d\n\nThe second thing is an agreement stating the terms of how much and under what circumstances you\u2019ll get paid. While you should go to an attorney to get this drawn up, this can cost you money that you don\u2019t have or don\u2019t want to spend on a project that may never pay off. Even if it\u2019s only a single page long, just be sure to get it in writing because people have a tendency to forget or remember differently over time and it pays to have something on paper. At the very least, put down what songs you\u2019ve worked on (or going to work on), the amounts agreed upon, and a time frame that you\u2019ll get paid (example - 30 days after signing a major or indie label agreement), and how you\u2019ll get paid (\u201cin full by cashiers check\u201d) just so no one forgets. This may not be legally binding or may have plenty of holes that a high-priced lawyer can drive a truck through, but if the people you\u2019re dealing are on the up and up, you\u2019ll at least have a piece of paper to remind everyone of your contribution to their success and how you all agreed you\u2019d be compensated.\n  \u2022 Charge an hourly rate. The safest way to go as long as you can get paid, an hourly rate means that when you inevitably spend that extra week on overdubs or mixing, you\u2019ll get paid for the time you\u2019re putting in. The hourly rate keeps people focused and stops them from adding those extra 5 overdubs \u201cjust to see what they sound like,\u201d or from trying 10 more takes when you all agreed that number 3 was great.\n  \u2022 A combination of the above. Many times payment consists of a little bit of money or a little bit of spec, some items at a flat rate and some at hourly, or some combination. Try not to get too complicated. A simple deal works best for everyone, especially when it comes to getting paid. Just realize that there are a lot of options available.\nThere are a lot of good books on the subject of how to structure a deal for yourself that are much more comprehensive then what was just laid out above. Even if you decide not to read them, get an attorney if it means any money more than what the attorney will cost. At the very least, always get it in writing.\"\n\nDon't forget to check out my Music 3.0 blog\u00a0for tips and tricks on navigating social media and the new music business.\n\nNo comments:\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"6 Steps to Move From College Debt to Financial Success\n\nBuilding Black Wealth: Following these principles will help college grads build a firm fiscal foundation.\n\nGeneric image\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is part 2 in a five-part series on growing and maintaining wealth. Read part 1.\n\nI grew up thinking that a college degree would be my ticket to wealth or at least entree into the upper echelons of the middle class. After spending most of my 20s digging my way out of $65,000 worth of student-loan and credit card debt amassed after completing a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and master\u2019s degrees in both bilingual education and organizational leadership, I realized that the correlation between a college education and wealth-building was a pretty weak one.\n\nWhile my credentials positioned me to earn more\u2014my income nearly tripled from my first degree to the third\u2014my degrees did not position me to save more, invest more or improve my credit; only strong money-management skills positioned me to do that. And those skills were acquired over the course of my 14-year journey toward financial freedom.\n\nHere are six wealth-building strategies and principles that I applied to build my financial foundation. Use them to build yours.\n\n1. Get organized and knowledgeable about your student loans.\u00a0Part of being a college graduate is being responsible and informed about your student loans. Take several weekends to educate yourself on the ins and outs of your student loans. Create virtual and\/or real folders to organize the following information.\n\n  \u2022 The type and number of loans that you have. Do you have subsidized and\/or unsubsidized loans? Do you have federal loans, private loans or both? Keep the name and number of your lender or lenders in your phone, on an Excel file on your computer, and as a hard copy for easy access.\n  \u2022 The exact cost of your loan(s). You need to know how much money you owe and the amount that is accrued monthly to the penny so that your efforts to eliminate debt are grounded in accurate numbers instead of approximations.\n  \u2022 Your options for loan repayment. Have you educated yourself on the various federal loan-forgiveness programs, the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, or the discounts applied to student-loan payment agreements that elect automatic withdrawals from your checking or savings accounts? Researching these options can save you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on your student-loan payments.\n  \u2022 The life of the loan in years. How long will it take to repay your loan if you only make the minimum payment? How long do you want to carry this debt? There are opportunity costs for prolonging the repayment process; extending the life of your loan or loans can delay the purchase of your first home, starting a family or new business, paying for a wedding, or quitting a job.\n\n2. Live at home for as long as you can. Without the burden of high rent prices, you can start to build a six-month emergency fund, save to buy your own home, make a big dent in your college loans and allow for more risk taking. With this safety net, you can say yes to low-paying, high-passion opportunities, entrepreneurial ideas, internships and travel opportunities, thus preparing you for bigger, greater and more meaningful long-term gains.\n\nOn the other hand, if living at home is not an option, scout out neighborhoods and cities that will eat up less than 30 percent of your total take-home pay. This may mean having to share your space with roommates to keep your costs low and shop sparingly for home furnishings.\n\n3. Understand that everything has diminishing returns, including education. This may be a hard pill to swallow, especially, since we, as African Americans, have been historically and systematically locked out of access to higher educational opportunities, but pursuing graduate studies for the sake of pursuing graduate studies or \u201cenriching\u201d your life is a waste of money if you are not clear about the financial returns on that investment and if you are already knee-deep in debt.\n\nIf you are committed to lifelong learning, consider a certificate course, self-study or one of the many low-cost or free online opportunities that some of the most prestigious colleges and universities offer, until you are 100 percent certain that you need that second or third degree.",

        "text":"These Are The Features You Need In Your Recognition Tool\n\nby Sabrina Son on Jan 29, 2015 8:00:00 AM\n\nemployees recognizing each otherThere's a good chance you\u2019ve had an employee quit because they said no one noticed their hard work. Are they being selfish? No. Employee recognition can make or break an employee\u2019s decision to stay.\n\nBut let\u2019s face reality. Managers aren\u2019t always around, and employees have a better understanding of their peers\u2019 work. So why not give employees the power to recognize?\n\n  \u2022 44% of employees would use peer-to-peer recognition tools if made available (source)\n\n  \u2022 76% of employees found peer recognition very or extremely motivating (source)\n\nBefore you jump the gun and take the first recognition tool you see, keep in mind that not all tools are created equal.\n\nPeers want to recognize. And they like it when their peers recognize them. But before you jump the gun and nab the first form of recognition you see, keep in mind that not all tools are created equally. These are the key features you should look for in a recognition tool:\n\n  \u2022 Spread the power: As we mentioned earlier, managers aren\u2019t always around to see all the details that go into a project. They miss out on most of the good stuff. So look for an easy-to-access tool that every employee can use.\n\n  \u2022 Digital access: Papers get lost and cards are costly. So go digital. Whether it\u2019s a desktop platform or mobile app, make sure employees (and managers too) can access the tool digitally at any time. This way, people don\u2019t have to wait to get back to their desk or find sticky notes to give a shout-out.\n\n  \u2022 Open 24\/7: There\u2019s no telling when something good happens. And people shouldn\u2019t be limited in when they can perform a good deed. On weekdays, weekends, morning, or midnight, keep your tool available at all hours. You never know when something awesome will happen and you need to give someone a virtual pat on the back.\n\nIf the tool you\u2019ve picked out has all of the above features, then you\u2019ve struck gold. Now that you\u2019ve got your tool, don\u2019t forget to share the recognition with everyone to keep employees engaged and reinforce good behavior.\n\n\n\nThe Effects of Employee Recognition & Appreciation Report by TINYpulse\nLike what you see?

        "text":"7 Common Money Myths\n\n7 Common Money Myths\n\nWhy do we buy cars we cannot afford? Why do we keep abusing credit cards? Why do we spend rather than save for retirement? Why do we keep making the same money mistakes?\n\nThe answer to these questions is most likely because our belief systems and attitudes towards money are deeply flawed. Here are seven common money myths that could be hampering your journey to financial independence and success.\n\nMoney myth #1: Credit cards are a tool\n\nCredit cards can be used as a tool to build a credit score, without which you\u2019d find it exceptionally hard to borrow money from the bank to buy a house or apply for a business loan. But if you\u2019re spending the bank\u2019s money on things you don\u2019t need, like expensive clothing, eating out, costly holidays, etc., credit cards can be extremely damaging. Credit card debt is excessively costly and a gratuitous waste of money if you don\u2019t stay on top of payments.\n\nThe solution is to load money onto your credit card before using it, so that you stay out of debt while still establishing a credit rating. If you don\u2019t have money to load onto your credit card, then you shouldn\u2019t be spending any.\n\nMoney myth #2: If you love someone, you\u2019ll lend them money\n\nThe fact is that anyone who asks a friend or family member for money just isn\u2019t managing his or her finances correctly. Instead of taking responsibility for this by applying for a cash loan or sitting down with a bank or financial manager, they\u2019re taking the easy way out by coming to you with hat in hands.\n\nRed flag.\n\nLending money to someone you love is almost always a terrible idea because (1) it rarely gets paid back and (2) it creates terrible tension in the relationship. Rather refer them to someone who will be able to help them budget and save the necessary money. You\u2019ll be doing them a favour in the long run and you\u2019ll avoid hurting your own finances and personal relationship in the process.\n\nRemember, money isn\u2019t proof of love, no matter how someone might try and convince you to the contrary. If you do have money to spare and are willing to give it to a loved one in need, make it a gift or do it in exchange for a favour.\n\nMoney myth #3: Car payments are inevitable\n\nContrary to popular opinion, the best car isn\u2019t the fastest and flashiest with the most modern features\u2026 it\u2019s the car that\u2019s fully paid for. Car payments are not a way of life; they are not inevitable and inescapable. Sure, if you need a car, you\u2019ll need to pay for it but that doesn\u2019t mean you should saddle yourself with crippling monthly payments.\n\nThe car you choose should be well within your means, which, in most cases, means buying second hand and keeping your choice modest. Cars decrease in value and car loans come with substantial interest rates, so the longer you\u2019re paying it off, the more money you are literally pouring down the drain.\n\nMoney myth #4: You can\u2019t go to college without taking out a student loan\n\nYes, you can! While it won\u2019t be easy, the hard work will totally be worth it. Here are some alternatives you should explore (possibly a combination of them will get you through your tuition without having to pay back costly student loans):\n\n  \u2022 Scholarships, grants, and bursaries \u2013 do your research and work hard to earn yourself some kind of grant, whether it\u2019s government, college, or corporate provided.\n  \u2022 Pay out of pocket \u2013 the earlier you start saving for college, the better. If you work part-time or in the evenings, you\u2019ll be in a better position to keep up with payments.\n  \u2022 Investigate on-campus job opportunities \u2013 if you show your mettle as a student, your college shouldn\u2019t hesitate to hire you for part-time work as a tutor, lecturer, etc.\n  \u2022 Get creative \u2013 how about using your skills to set up your own independent business, such as private tutoring, pet sitting, or freelance writing, etc.? There are several ways you can generate an income while studying.\n\nMoney myth #5: I\u2019ll save for retirement when I earn more money\n\nIf you don\u2019t have enough money left over at the end of the month to set aside for retirement right now, you\u2019re not planning your finances well enough. Your retirement fund shouldn\u2019t suffer, your lifestyle should. Cut back on any or all unnecessary expenses or try and figure out a way to bring in more money each month. Don\u2019t wait for some future time when you\u2019re earning more money to start making provision for your well-being decades from now. The more you save now, the less you\u2019ll worry later, and the earlier you start, the better.\n\nMoney myth #6: Renting is a waste of money\n\nFor the longest time, owning a home was considered the hallmark of success and financial independence. That\u2019s not necessarily true. Buying a home comes with a suite of expenses (taxes, maintenance and association fees) and if you don\u2019t make a decent enough down-payment (at least 20%), your finances could take a huge hit from the higher interest rates and additional fees for private bond insurance. If you cannot afford to buy a home, it\u2019s far smarter to rent.\n\nMoney myth #7: I don\u2019t have enough money to invest\n\nSetting aside money that will do more than just sit in a bank account earning little to no interest is a fundamental part of creating and growing wealth. It\u2019s a gross misconception that you need to have a lot of money to make a start. There are several investment options and products that don\u2019t require a substantial principle to get started. Analyse your monthly expenses and spending habits for ways in which you might be bleeding money unnecessarily and set up a monthly savings goal specifically for investing.\n\nMore from our blog:",

        "text":"11 Lessons for Local Business Content Marketing\n\nIn Small Business by Chris Risse1 Comment\n\nLocal business content marketing can be defined as the process of identifying what your local audience needs to know, informing them, and converting on their reaction. But to put it plainly, content is created to be consumed. The content with the consumer in mind is more easily fed. Consumers love to feed.\n\n1. For content to be consumed, it needs to be created.\n\nContent will not miraculously appear out of thin air. Someone needs to produce it, but the effort for finding content to produce is not as difficult as it may seem. Each day, as a local business, you are made aware of occurrences that require you to educate your customer. This may be local to your business, or an issue felt by your entire industry. These topics are ideal for discussion and education for your target audience.\n\nOnce an idea for the content has been formed, this most difficult step in the entire process is writing it down.\n\n2. The local business is the publisher.\n\nThis may feel like a big concept to understand, but in reality it is very simple. Your business creates content, your business publishes content. From start to end, the content belongs to your business. The method, time, and context of delivery is completely your choice.\n\nWith this power comes great responsibility, so begin to simplify the delivery process and automate the rest. Start with one media, one source, and one method of distribution. \u00a0Once this process is solid, you can begin to look at ways of broadening the process into new media, courses, and distribution methods.\n\n3. Neither time nor money should prevent content creation.\n\nRemember, the most difficult part of content marketing for local business is simply writing down the idea. However, turning that idea into published material is often seen as a hurdle itself. The excuse most often heard is \u201cnot enough time or money\u201d, which simply means \u201cI\u2019m not organized.\u201d Time and money may be short, but that is the perfect opportunity to be creative.\n\nThe goal of content marketing is to be seen as a leader in your industry in your area, which would be very difficult to achieve without creativity. When time and money becomes available, investing in digital media or content creators should be looked at as a way to enhance what you are already doing.\n\n4. Focus on a content topic, be industry specific.\n\nIt is imperative that the content you are producing be industry specific. That should honestly go unsaid, but I had to say it. The focus of the content your local business is creating should have a main focus, the relationship your consumers have with your industry. That is why you are in the business, right? You are the face of the industry to your consumers, much like a mother to a child. Educate your audience with what they should know. Don\u2019t make any assumptions that they are the expert you are.\n\n5. Find what makes your business unique.\n\nEach business has a story and it should play into your local business content marketing. What makes your business unique from your competition are the people that make up your business, their relationships to each other, and their relationships to the consumer. Do you have characters working for you? Of course! Unless you are working with robots, those warm blooded employees and staff members have personalities that give the business a unique life of its own.\n\n6. Start a discussion, get some feedback.\n\nBe ready to communicate with your consumers. Great content will always start a discussion. The discussion is completely in the control of the content creator, by way of context. Rate the discussion energy as the effectiveness of the content.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of the discussion. This is as much of an opportunity to teach as it is to learn. The consumer will appreciate your efforts, which can lead to a positive customer service experience.\n\n7. Be consistent and constant with content delivery.\n\nOnce you start producing and publishing content, don\u2019t stop. Consumers come to expect new content from your business. When you fail to deliver, your business will stop short of fulfilling the expectations of the consumer. Keep content production moderate, and well within the means of what you can produce. This will take a lot of the pressure off of you to keep consistently publishing valuable content.\n\n8. Use multiple media strategies.\n\nContent creation comes in many forms. The form of choice is what works best with your creation process. Start with one method and process, expand when you are comfortable.\n\nLocal Business Content Marketing Media Options:\n\n  \u2022 Blogging\n  \u2022 Videos\n  \u2022 Podcasts (Audio)\n  \u2022 Newsletters\n  \u2022 eBooks\n  \u2022 Websites\n[divider height=\u201d20\u2033 line=\u201d0\u2033]\n\n9. Distribute and syndicate your content.\n\nMuch like the process of creating your content, connecting your content with your consumer should always start with one approach before expanding into multiple methods. For social networks, choose the network that your business uses the most and has the easiest time engaging the audience.\n\nConsumers who have found your content to be of value will also find ways to share the content. Make sure this is as easy as possible for the consumer.\n\n10. Convert content consumers into customers.\n\nDon\u2019t waste your time producing content that wastes the time of your audience. Give the consumer a reason to act. Call their attention to what you are asking of them through the content. A conversion is far more likely to occur when you make it obvious to the consumer of how to act upon the message.\n\n11. Consume to be consumed.\n\nIn order to keep up with content demand, you need to listen to your content consumer. If you haven\u2019t figured it out by now, the consumer is your potential customer. Marketing to your potential customer is an ongoing effort, that requires the business to be engaged.\n\nThe content you are producing strengthens your business integrity in the mind of your clients and the audience you are trying to persuade. But, instead of mindlessly regurgitating content for the sake of publishing content, stop and listen to your industry\u2019s voices and the collective voice of your target market. Producing smart and valuable content will more than pay for itself.\n\n[divider height=\u201d30\u2033 line=\u201d1\u2033]\n\nNow it is time to make a plan. Look at what strengths your business has and how can that include content creation.

        "text":"10 Things I do Every January\n\nThe beginning of every new year calls for action to straighten out things. A new year calls for new beginnings. In your personal life, in business and in almost all things, people often take stock and see where they can make amends or start out afresh once again. I know this is true for me and I suspect for many people as well. Perhaps that\u2019s why making new year resolutions is quite popular, even if many people do not follow up with keeping those resolutions. Personally I set goals for the year, instead of resolutions and as the months roll by, I track these goals to attempt to meet them.\n\nTo help me create order and a unique system, I try to do these 10 things every New Year.\u00a0I try to do some of the on New Year\u2019s Day and the rest in the first week of the\u00a0New Year.\u00a0Not all of them are financial, but this system helps to a large extent set the tone for the year.\n\n1. Create Goals For The Year\n\nI try to create concise and measurable goals for the year. I love simplicity, so I don\u2019t try to put everything on my goals list. To a reasonable extent, I try to create goals in these areas of my life: Spiritual, Family, Career, Financial, Physical, Social and Intellectual. I track these goals throughout the year, especially at the beginning of every month. Sometimes, I don\u2019t meet all the goals on my list but monthly or quarterly\u00a0reviews help to re-focus my attention on the things I need to do to reach my goals in these areas. It\u2019s like a self-check system. This is why writing down your goals can be a powerful strategy. For example, one of my Intellectual goals in 2019 is to read 6 non-fiction and non-financial books (of course I will also read at least about 6 financial books; aim is to read a book a month).\n\n2. Calculate Net Worth\n\nThe real measure of growth in your finances is your net worth. It simply is calculated by subtracting all your liabilities (debts, loans, mortgages etc) from all your assets (retirement accounts, investments, cash, life insurance, real estate etc). The goal is to try as much as possible to have your net worth be going up every year. You can calculate this every month (like most personal finance bloggers do), every quarter or every year. I track ours every quarter and the first of January every year presents the first time to calculate our net worth for the year. There are many net worth calculators online. Better still you can just use a financial aggregation sites like Mint or Personal Capital and let them do it for you after you input all your figures. You can try this calculator here\n\n3. Check Credit Report\n\nYou can check your credit report from the 3 credit bureaus (Experian, Transunion and Equifax) for free once year. I usually check ours every January 1st. Even though I have creditkarma which helps me track our credit report daily and sends me monthly details, I still do this traditional practice of checking the reports myself to make sure everything is fine (I check the reports for unusual activity or any account I\u2019m not aware of). In this our current world of credit breaches, this is the least you should do. You can check your credit report at annualcreditreport.com\n\n4. Detailed Review of Household Trends\n\nI\u2019m very old school and despite all the fancy budgeting apps present these days, I still do our family budget in pen and paper. At the end of the year, I have a page where I detail all the trends for the year. These typically include total spending on different categories like how much we spent on utilities for the year, how much we spent on gas or car maintenance, our charitable giving, total savings, grocery spending etc. Every January 1st, I review these trends and compare it with the previous year. It helps provide some vital household financial statistics and helps keep some things in perspective for me\n\n5. Rebalancing\n\nI\u2019m a lazy investor: I only invest in total market Index funds. I love keeping it simple. Tons of studies have shown that being a lazy investor is much more superior to being an active and sophisticated investor. So we only have a few index funds in our retirement accounts. For example, both of our Roth IRAs only have one single investment inside of it: Vanguard Small Cap Value Index Fund, VSIAX. Our workplace retirement accounts have a few total market funds and some bonds. Rebalancing, which is the art of rearranging your asset allocation of stocks and bonds back to the set allocation, is predictably very easy for me. Often times, I rarely have to do anything. If the market had shifted considerably in the past year, then I may have to do a little rearrangement here and there. I think rebalancing is overrated but some smart financial professionals have argued that it can add about 1% to your total returns over your investing lifetime. So I do it when it is necessary, on every New Year\u2019s Day. If there\u2019s not much changes in our set asset allocation, I just leave everything alone\n\n6. Review Insurances\n\nOnce you buy your insurance, the natural thing is for most people to lock it in and forget about it for a long time. Bad idea. Sometimes, shopping for your insurance across different companies can show you some huge savings. Every January 1st, I try to review our insurances: Auto, Homeowner\u2019s, Umbrella, and even our Term Life Insurances. When I compare rates and find significant savings between our current company and another, I make the change. This is why using a captive agent of one single company as your insurance broker is not a good idea. It\u2019s best to shop across several companies and find the best deal and savings for you.\n\n7. Contribute to Roth IRAs\n\nI love the Roth IRA. It\u2019s not a secret, it\u2019s my favorite retirement account. I think it\u2019s the best retirement plan in the country. In 2011, I asked a financial adviser if I could open one and he told me I could not because I was still on H-1 visa and that I could only open one when I got my permanent residence. Knowing virtually nothing about personal finance and investment at that time, I believed him. About a year later, when I was beginning to acquire some knowledge myself, I researched and saw that I could actually open it even with my H-1 visa status. It just took a few minutes online on E-Trade and I opened a Roth IRA (I have since transferred the account to Vanguard). I\u2019ve never looked back since then.\n\nSince the past 2 years, I\u2019ve decided to fund our Roth IRAs every January 1st (technically by January 2nd since the 1st is a holiday and businesses are closed that day). I save all through the year to get the maximum amount and then dump it in one fell swoop in January. This way, it gets exposed to the market all year through. Investing early is one of the best ways to invest.\n\n8. Review Estate Plan\n\nTechnically, I\u2019ve not done this before but I intend to add it to my to do list every January. Estate planning always takes the back burner but I\u2019m determined to shake off that inertia and do something about this going forward. A simple Will can be obtained online, but because this is one area of personal finance that is least exciting to me, I may eventually have to get an Estate attorney to help me do this, then every January, I will look at any changes that may be necessary depending on our family situation\n\n9. Document Assets Inside the Home\n\nIn 2018, thousands of home were completely destroyed by fire in California. Many of the homeowners did not have the time to remove valuable things from the home. There are also stories of homes being destroyed by hurricanes or other types of storms. These events, while rare, can be devastating. One of the headaches associated with losing a home is fighting with the Homeowner insurance company in rebuilding your home. Assets inside the home are supposed to be covered too. However when you don\u2019t have a record of all the assets inside your home, how do you argue with the insurance company to reimburse appropriately? This is where documenting the assets on video comes in. I stole this idea from Clark Howard. So, every January 1, I try to make a video of the major assets inside the house. You can use your camera to do this short video. Ideally, you can store it electronically or online where fire or water will not destroy it.\n\n10. Call Loved Ones\n\nThis includes family and friends. The frenetic pace of life guarantees that you tend to forget to keep in touch with some beloved family members and friends throughout the year. Often times, I find that I have not talked to some close friends or family members in over 6 months! It is not by design. Life happens. New Year\u2019s Day affords me an opportunity to start on a clean slate again. Social interactions is one of the reasons why we can live longer. No man is an island. If you stay alone and keep to yourself all year long, you can get bogged down with depression. Social interactions are vital for happiness. So every 1st week of January, I make an attempt and scroll down my phone list to see those I have not talked to in a long while and try to catch up. After all, like Suze Orman says, \u201cIt\u2019s people first. Then money. Then things\u201d. Hopefully, this sets a position motion to periodically reach out through the year to those I have not spoken with in a long while.\n\nSo do you have a system that you use every new year? Do you do any of the above on New Year\u2019s Day? Comment below\n\n8 thoughts on \u201c10 Things I do Every January\n\n  1. This is such an insightful article. Thanks for writing this. I will certainly be adopting these goals for 2019.\n    Happy new year!\n\n  2. I\u2019ve done 1-5, however, the rest are a work in progress. I\u2019m planning on getting #6 done before the end of this week and I\u2019m confident that I will be able to find better rates! I just may be able to use that savings to fund our #7 \ud83e\udd14\n\n  3. Phenomenal list. Thanks for sharing. You gave me a couple of important reminders.\n    I started checking my credit report every 4 months or so. Since there are three agencies with free reports you can rotate through... (truncated)",

        "text":"Listing Of Business Ideas For 2019\n\nLet\u2019s speak enterprise ideas. If in case you have a knack for tidying up and organising your area, then now could possibly be a great time to capitalise on this interest by beginning a house business decluttering individuals\u2019s dwelling areas. Starting a business is hard work, and you\u2019re committing to this idea for years (possibly even decades) to come.\n\nIf that isn\u2019t sufficient, you may broaden your companies to incorporate pet grooming as an extra side business concept. Webinars present online marketers with a platform to work together and have interaction with an audience that is more than keen to purchase whatever it\u2019s they are promoting.\n\nSimply you should definitely always order a sample for your self to make sure that your supplier is reliable and that the standard of the merchandise is fit for selling to your prospects. Revealed yearly, our What companies to start characteristic is an intensive report compiling business insight and analysis from the likes of Yell Business, the Office of Nationwide Statistics (ONS), and current begin-ups.\n\nWhat I actually like about this enterprise thought is that you would be able to get began TODAY. Learn the way other folks came up with their business concepts after which bought started. Not solely is the actual property sector regaining its footing, the number of type-aware prospects is also on the rise, creating plenty of room for development into these kinds of handy enterprise concepts.\n\nIf you already have the cash and you marvel what you may do with it, it is potential to depend on a couple of business ideas. I\u2019ve already given you examples of how easy it might be to find potential shoppers, and even given you examples of best clients(obviously do not bother them unless\u00a0you can supply them value).\n\nA number of the ecommerce business ideas on this record have been standard for a very long time making it extra aggressive but less risky. For those looking for a more fingers-on method, starting a cleaning business could see you clear up very quickly without any enormous preliminary funding sucking up your income.\n\nMainly, think of the best model of your product and repair that possesses its core options and begin getting real suggestions from potential clients. This is especially necessary in the event you\u2019re a solopreneur and trying to just create a aspect hustle (or entertain online business ideas from dwelling), or you do not have a ton of sources to leverage for the time being.\n\nThere are a ton\u00a0of conventional holidays that depend as stable causes to explore the facet business idea of\u00a0crafting and promoting seasonal decorations. It is necessary that you just always validate what you are promoting ideas first, so you don\u2019t waste your time and money on something that ultimately nobody desires.\n\nOver the weekend, a friend of mine asked for some advice about starting a business, so I believed that may be a very good matter.

        "text":"Out of nearly 30 million small businesses in the United States, only half of them will make it past five years. To ensure your small business is successful, explore the various ways LinkedIn, the world\u2019s largest professional network, can help.\n\nHere are 6 ways to spark growth by generating leads, producing sales, and hiring top professionals on LinkedIn:\n\n1. Make a Company Page\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have one, create a LinkedIn Company Page. LinkedIn members are 50% more likely to buy once they\u2019ve engaged with your business online. Personal profiles don\u2019t have the same marketing, advertising, and recruiting features as Company Pages, and make them less effective at promoting your business. Do not miss out on a free opportunity to generate leads, talent, and, ultimately, revenue.\u00a0\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on how to create an above and beyond Company Page, view the LinkedIn Company Page Best Practices.\n\n2. Promote, Promote, Promote!\n\nOnce you have a Company Page,\u00a0promote your page on other platforms or via email to grow your audience. Here are some simple ways to get the word out:\n\n  \u2022 Announce the launch of the Company Page on your personal LinkedIn profile\n  \u2022 Encourage your employees to follow the Company Page\u2014Social Media Today reports that content shared by employees receives eight times the engagement as brand shared content\n  \u2022 Link to your Company Page in your marketing emails or newsletters\n  \u2022 Embed a Company Follow button onto your website so visitors can easily follow your business.\n\n3. Post Content Consistently\n\nThe more you post, the more people you can potentially reach and convert.\u00a0To get started, try posting at least once per week. Posting consistently shows Company Page visitors that you are active on LinkedIn. Use LinkedIn\u2019s Company Page analytics to see your top performing updates, your best times to post, and which members of your audience are the most engaged. With this information, it\u2019s easy to make data-driven decisions to optimize your Company Page content.\u00a0\n\nn addition to posting often, here are a few more stats to help you boost engagement:\n\n  \u2022 Posts with links receive up to 45% more engagement\n  \u2022 Images see an incredible 98% increase in engagement\n  \u2022 Posts that have relevant \u201cbest-of\u201d lists get almost 40% more amplification\u00a0\n\nWhen a post gets good engagement, consider promoting it to a wider audience with LinkedIn Sponsored Content. Take the Sponsored Content Tour and discover how Sponsored Content amplifies your best content.\u00a0\n\n4. Provide a Unique Perspective\u00a0\n\nSeventy nine percent of buyers say thought leadership is critical for determining which companies they want to learn more about. To get started with thought leadership content, try to provide a unique perspective on your industry, product, or organization.\u00a0\n\nFor more ideas and advice on expanding your brand\u2019s authority, download the Sophisticated Marketer\u2019s Guide to Thought Leadership to learn more.\u00a0\n\n5. Find Your Audience\u00a0\n\nLinkedIn also provides you with tools to identify and target your ideal audience, among over 500 million users.\u00a0\n\nLinkedIn members are more likely than other social media users to keep their profiles up-to-date, making it easier for you to find the right people. Use LinkedIn profile data to search for LinkedIn members based on geographic location, education, experience, and even connections.\n\n6. Assemble an Amazing Team\u00a0\n\nResearch shows that 66% of candidates want to see company culture over everything else. To take advantage of this job search preference, consider enhancing your Company Page with a LinkedIn Career Page. This will allow you to target and attract job seekers with a personalized look at your company, culture, and jobs.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to creating Career Pages, encourage employees to share job postings and \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d content as well. This adds to your authenticity by giving visitors a genuine idea of what it\u2019s like to work for you. If you have a few employees who share content frequently, consider linking them to your Company Page\u2019s Life Tab. Their updates will automatically populate, providing visitors with up-to-date information.",
