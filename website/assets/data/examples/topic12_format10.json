        "text":"By\u00a0Fathin Ungku\u00a0and\u00a0Aradhana Aravindan\n\nMany of Singapore's five million people are covering up and staying indoors to avoid mosquito bites as health experts warned that the outbreak of the Zika virus in the tropical city-state would be difficult to contain.\n\nOne of the world's leading financial hubs, Singapore is the only Asian country with active transmission of the mosquito-borne virus, which generally causes mild symptoms but can lead to serious birth defects in pregnant women.\n\nAuthorities say they have found over 150 cases since the first locally contracted infection was reported a week ago, and with the virus spreading beyond the cluster where it was initially detected, more people are taking precautions.\n\n\"I'm not going to let her go outside much until Zika dies down,\" said Nat Bumatay, a self-employed mother, of her six-year-old daughter Sunshine. \"Usually during short holidays, we go outside to the parks, go cycling, but now I will refrain.\"\n\nA warm, tropical climate, forested areas and a network of public parks make outdoor activities popular across Singapore, especially during school holidays like the ten-day break that began on Friday.\n\nAuthorities have stepped up spraying insecticide and clearing stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding, but many people said they were also avoiding the city's popular outdoor food centers and dousing themselves in repellent to avoid getting bitten.\n\n\"Prevention is better than cure,\" said Tomas Quong, a Filipino who has been working in Singapore for five years. \"That's why I am wearing long sleeves.\"\n\nSome fans of Nintendo's Pokemon Go mobile game are also becoming more cautious and crowds at outdoor Pokemon hotspots around the city are likely to be thinner. \"I am still okay with outdoors, just not damp and dirty parks,\" said Nelson Ho, a 19-year-old gamer.\n\nPharmacies and supermarkets have reported a surge in mosquito repellent's over the past week, with some running out of stock. Online retailers Lazada and have set up a Zika shop, while other enterprising Singaporeans trying to cash in are advertising mosquito net tents and \"anti-bite\" jewelry.\n\n\nThe outbreak coincides with a slowdown in trade-dependent Singapore. Worries about Zika could further crimp overall retail sales, United Overseas Bank economist Francis Tan said. \"If it continues, people will generally not want to go out, so all the retail sectors will be slowing down,\" Tan said.\n\nZika could also increase concerns about tourism, a mainstay of the economy, especially with the city-state's key annual attraction - the floodlit Formula One Grand Prix race - due to start in two weeks. Several countries, including the United States and Australia, have advised pregnant women or those trying to conceive not to visit.\n\n\"It will certainly create a bit of caution in the minds of tourists and they may think about it twice,\" said Jonathan Galaviz, partner at consultants Global Market Advisors. \"But I don't see Zika standing in the way of a successful F1 event or tourism flows in the short term.\"\n\nTourism arrivals topped 8 million in the first half of this year, around 1 million more than a year ago.\n\nThe Tourism Board has said it is premature to consider any impact on the industry, with at least two international chain hotels contacted by Reuters reporting business as usual. The promoters of the Grand Prix have also said planning for the event is going ahead \"as per normal\".\n\nSeveral of those initially infected by the virus were foreigners, many believed to be among the thousands of migrant workers in Singapore's construction industry.\n\nThe latest tally includes two pregnant women, and officials and experts say the number of cases is likely to increase as the virus is likely to spread.\n\n\"The virus is extending beyond the square that was drawn out,\" said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena hospital in Singapore. \"We have re-draw the battle lines. We have to first admit defeat to Zika and accept that the whole country is at risk.\"",

He says all patient confidentiality would be respected and his office would work closely with the B.C. information and privacy commissioner.\n\n\u201cThe recent surge in overdoses is a huge concern for us,\u201d Health Minister Terry Lake says. \u201cWe have to do what is needed to prevent overdoses and deaths and what\u2019s needed is real-time information.\"\n\nThe Interior Health Authority has been particularly hard hit, reporting 60 overdose deaths last year, a record in itself, but new numbers released today by the BC Coroner Service already show 39 deaths to the end of March, just three months into the year.\n\nKendall says the soaring numbers, which go beyond Metro Vancouver and into the Interior and Island health authorities, is part of the reason for declaring a provincial emergency.\n\nFind past stories on drug overdoses here.\n\nFind past stories on fentanyl here.\n\nTo contact a reporter for this story, email John McDonald\u00a0or call 250-808-0143 or email the editor.

Photo: Khalis Surry \/ Anadolu Agency\n\nJAKARTA \u2013 \u201cMy fellow Indonesians, at 9:42 this morning I took the major step as an Indonesian of receiving the coronavirus vaccine and freeing myself from the\u00a0pandemic,\u201d President Joko Widodo wrote on his Facebook page on December 13 as the Christmas-New Year Covid-19 infection rate set new records across the country.\n\nWith a reassuring \u201cSafe and Halal\u201d sign as a backdrop, the 59-year-old president launched the first round of inoculations of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine, whose efficacy rate is 65.3%, according to third phase trials conducted in Bandung, south of Jakarta.\n\nBut none of the volunteers were over 59, the most vulnerable age group, and there is concern about a similar trial conducted by Brazil\u2019s Butantan Institute which recorded an efficacy rate of only 50.4%, barely above the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) threshold to establish and maintain herd immunity.\n\nAlthough Sinovac recently received emergency approval from the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) and the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the Widodo government will clearly have to do more to earn public trust as it prepares for one of the world\u2019s biggest inoculation programs.\n\nAll vaccines must receive halal certification from the MUI to ensure they are permissible under Islamic law, an important step in the Muslim-majority nation, where it could become a serious impediment if not addressed.\n\nTwo years ago the council refused to sign off on a measles vaccine, declaring it to be haram because it was suspected of containing a pork-derived gelatin\u00a0stabilizer used in some cases to prevent degradation during storage and transport.\n\nAn Indonesian medical worker shows China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech Covid-19 vaccine at the public health center in Jakarta, on January 15, 2021. Photo: Aditya Irawan\/NurPhoto via AFP\n\nA Saiful Mujani Research & Consulting survey last month found that only 37% of respondents were willing to take what might be the life-saving jab, with 40% uncertain and 17% saying they would refuse it, mostly because of concerns over safety and effectiveness.\n\nHealth experts say even with a smooth rollout through hospitals and 10,000 first-level health clinics, it will be at least 15 months before the program reaches the percentage required for herd immunity among Indonesia\u2019s 270 million-strong population.\n\nThe government estimates it will need 427 million doses, factoring in a wastage of 15%, to vaccinate a targeted 181.5 million citizens, with\u00a0Widodo saying he wants that done by mid-2022.\n\nSome experts fear it may take three to four years, but with newly-appointed Health Minister Budi Sadikian, a proven manager, now at the helm there is optimism that the government now has the life-saving task in hand.\n\nAlthough only a drop in the bucket, the three million doses of Sinovac already available will initially go to healthcare workers, business people, community leaders, civil servants and members of the police and armed forces.\u00a0\n\nThe government has signed deals for a further 125 million doses of Sinovac, which is expected to be available to inoculate another 65 million Indonesians, and 50 million vials each of the AstraZeneca (Britain) and Novavax (US) vaccines.\n\nBut negotiations with Pfizer have reached a stalemate over the US drug company\u2019s insistence on a government-to-business contract for 50 million doses, along with the specialized cold storage facilities to store the vaccine at the required -70 degrees Celsius.\n\nHonesti Basyir, president director of state-owned Bio Farma, Indonesia\u2019s only vaccine manufacturer, says Pfizer wants to be immune of lawsuits resulting from\u00a0any short or long-term side effects that may emerge during the rollout of the vaccine.\n\nHonesti Basyir takes questions from the press. Image: Facebook\n\nIndonesia has still to complete a \u201ccold chain\u201d across the archipelago to handle the distribution of the vaccine, with Covid-19 Task Force spokesman Wiku Adisasmito indicating that it will be confined mainly to large urban\u00a0centers.\n\nJakarta is also seeking 108 million free doses from GAVI, an alliance led by the WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, UNICEF and the World Bank which was created two decades ago to improve vaccination access for the world\u2019s children.\n\nAlready considered to be unstated, Indonesia\u2019s daily infection rate has doubled\u00a0from 8,000 to as much as 14,000-plus in the past two weeks, a direct result of intra-provincial travel during the Christmas-New Year holiday break.\n\nThat has boosted total infections over the 900,000 mark, with the death toll verging on 26,000, or 250-300 a day.\n\nOfficials say isolation and intensive care units are at 80% capacity as the government implements a stricter set of health protocols in Java and on the tourist island of Bali to contain the latest surge, the worst since the crisis began.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEast Java leads with 6,779 deaths, followed by Central Java with 4,375, Jakarta\u00a0on 3,673 and West Java with 1,294 \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s four most populous provinces that contribute to about 60% of the national total.\n\nThe lowest number of deaths have been recorded in West Kalimantan (28) and in West Sulawesi (57), the scene of last week\u2019s 6.2 earthquake which killed more than 50 people and collapsed hundreds of buildings.\n\nThis picture shows tombstones at a burial site for victims of the Covid-19 coronavirus in Jakarta on September 11, 2020. Photo: AFP\/Bay Ismoyo\n\nIn Asia, a region that appears to have escaped the full brunt of the pandemic, Indonesia has the highest number of deaths per million at 5.52%, according to Statista. But its data shows that is still far less than countries in Europe and most other parts of the world.\n\nForeign nationals have been banned from entering Indonesia until January 28 to prevent the entry of the more infectious Covid-19 strains discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil. Domestic tourists can only travel internally after undergoing a swab anti-gen test and obtaining a digital health card.\n\n\u201cThe greatest challenge (to the vaccination program) is our geographic landscape,\u201d says Wiku, a health policy and infectious disease expert. \u201cTo address that we are working closely with the military and the police to ensure there is smooth distribution.\u201d\n\nBut he also warned that much also depends on the availability of supply, an issue amplified by Health Minister Sadikan this week when he said the government may allow for private vaccination schemes after the completion of the first phase of the program to help fill any gap. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOfficials say they will not force the vaccine on people, but will wait before imposing sanctions, which include a 100 million rupiah fines for those who don\u2019t comply with quarantine restrictions or hinder the implementation of a vaccination program.\n\n\u201cThe people are not ready because they don\u2019t understand,\u201d\u00a0Wiku told foreign correspondents. \u201cWe need more consistent public education. It\u2019s very difficult to explain to people in rural areas, but with the right cultural approach we can convince them.\u201d",

The loss of life toll within the province rose to 1,310, together with 242 new deaths.\n\nThe sharp rise in reported instances illustrates how onerous it has been for scientists to know the extent and severity of the coronavirus outbreak in China, significantly contained in the epicenter, the place 1000\u2019s of sick folks stay untested for the sickness.\n\nConfronted by so many individuals with signs and no straightforward solution to check them, authorities seem to have modified the best way the sickness is recognized.\n\nHospitals in Wuhan, China \u2014 the biggest metropolis in Hubei Province and the middle of the epidemic \u2014 have struggled to diagnose infections with scarce and sophisticated assessments that detect the virus\u2019s genetic signature straight. Different nations, too, have had such points.\n\nAs an alternative, officers in Hubei now appear to be together with infections identified by utilizing lung scans of symptomatic sufferers. This shortcut will assist get extra sufferers into wanted care, provincial officers stated. Including them to the rely might make it simpler for the authorities to determine find out how to allocate assets and assess remedy choices.\n\nHowever the change additionally exhibits the large variety of folks in Hubei who\u2019re sick and haven\u2019t been counted within the outbreak\u2019s official tally. It additionally raises the query whether or not the province, already struggling, is supplied to take care of the brand new sufferers.\n\nThe few consultants to be taught of the brand new numbers on Wednesday night time had been startled. Lung scans are an imperfect means to diagnose sufferers. Even sufferers with unusual seasonal flu might develop pneumonia seen on a lung scan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in unknown territory,\u201d stated Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious illness specialist at Vanderbilt College in Nashville.\n\n  \u2022 Up to date Feb. 10, 2020\n\n    \u2022 What\u2019s a Coronavirus?\n      It\u2019s a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its floor. The coronavirus can infect each animals and folks, and may trigger a spread of respiratory diseases from the widespread chilly to extra harmful circumstances like Extreme Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.\n    \u2022 How contagious is the virus?\n      In keeping with preliminary analysis, it appears reasonably infectious, much like SARS, and is probably transmitted by the air. Scientists have estimated that every contaminated individual might unfold it to someplace between 1.5 and three.5 folks with out efficient containment measures.\n    \u2022 How apprehensive ought to I be?\n      Whereas the virus is a critical public well being concern, the danger to most individuals outdoors China stays very low, and seasonal flu is a extra speedy risk.\n    \u2022 Who\u2019s working to include the virus?\n      World Well being Group officers have praised China\u2019s aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, faculties and markets. This week, a group of consultants from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to supply help.\n    \u2022 What if I\u2019m touring?\n      The USA and Australia are quickly denying entry to noncitizens who just lately traveled to China and several other airways have canceled flights.\n    \u2022 How do I hold myself and others protected?\n      Washing your arms steadily is an important factor you are able to do, together with staying at dwelling while you\u2019re sick.\n\nIn China, well being officers have been below distinctive pressure. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and large new shelters are being erected to warehouse sufferers. Medical assets are in brief provide. It\u2019s by no means been clear who\u2019s being examined.\n\nWell being staff have gone door to door in Wuhan to verify folks for signs. The prospect of compelled isolation could also be deterring some folks with respiratory diseases from presenting themselves at well being services to hunt well being care, some consultants say, making the size of the epidemic even much less clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be sick, the authorities want to seek out you, otherwise you discover them, and they should check you,\u201d stated Dr. Arthur Reingold, an epidemiologist on the College of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe push to prioritize lung scans appears to have begun with a social media marketing campaign by a doctor in Wuhan, who final week referred to as for utilizing the scans to simplify the screening of sufferers and to speed up their hospitalization and remedy.\n\nLung scans produce speedy outcomes, she stated, and Wuhan was operating wanting testing kits.\n\nEven earlier than as we speak\u2019s information, consultants complained that epidemiological data from China has been incomplete, threatening containment efforts.\n\nThe brand new coronavirus is very transmissible and might be troublesome to squelch. A single contaminated \u201csuper-spreader\u201d can infect dozens of others. Outbreaks can appear to recede, solely to rebound in brief order, because the climate or circumstances change.\n\nLatest clusters of coronavirus instances recommend the brand new coronavirus not solely spreads rapidly, but in addition in methods that aren\u2019t completely understood.\n\n[Just like the Science Instances web page on Fb. | Join the Science Instances e-newsletter.]\n\nIn Hong Kong, folks dwelling 10 flooring aside had been contaminated, and an unsealed pipe was blamed. A British citizen apparently contaminated 10 folks, together with some at a ski chalet, earlier than he even knew he was sick.\n\nIn Tianjin, China, a minimum of 33 of 102 confirmed sufferers had a connection of some type with a big division retailer.\n\n\u201cThis outbreak might nonetheless go in any path,\u201d Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director normal of the World Well being Group, stated on Wednesday.\n\nA change in analysis might make it nonetheless tougher to trace the virus, stated Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the College of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and World Well being Safety.\n\n\u201cIt makes it actually complicated proper now in the event that they\u2019re altering the entire means they display and detect,\u201d he stated. Now estimating the size of the epidemic \u201cis a transferring goal.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t unusual for scientists to refine diagnostic standards as their understanding of a brand new illness adjustments. However when the standards are modified, consultants stated, it makes little sense to proceed to make week-over-week comparisons.\n\n\u201cIt sounds simplistic, but it surely\u2019s so essential \u2014 what numbers are you counting?\u201d stated Dr. Schaffner, the infectious illness specialist.\n\nScientists have been cautious of the notion that the epidemic has peaked for different causes, as effectively.\n\nIn contrast to MERS and SARS, each illnesses brought on by coronaviruses, the virus spreading from China seems to be extremely contagious, although it\u2019s most likely much less usually deadly.\n\nIt\u2019s tougher for public well being officers to trace a quickly transferring epidemic. Scientists usually describe these epidemics as a type of iceberg \u2014 their girth and true form hidden under the floor.\n\nChaos makes it nonetheless tougher to discern these dimensions.

Do not put the blame on your pregnancy, but on your lifestyle choices post-delivery, researchers say.\n\nRepresentational picture\n\nThe findings showed that mothers keep the weight on by eating food off their child's plate or sitting down for longer periods of time. Further, sleep deprivation - often found in new mothers - increases food cravings and appetite even if they want a healthy diet, leading to weight gain.\n\n\"Mothers tend to put the needs of their children first, so they might not be exercising or taking care of themselves,\" lead author Olga Yakusheva, associate professor at the University of Michigan in the US, was quoted as saying to dailymail.co.uk.\n\n\"It might also be little things like finishing the food on their child's plate or spending more time sitting with their kids reading or watching a movie,\" Yakusheva added. In addition, many women really crank up their diet and exercise for a short time to get back to their pre-pregnancy weight and often get discouraged by the results, leaving exercise all together.\n\nHowever, if women want to lose the weight, they should cut the calories and work out more as well as take a holistic approach focused on a long-term healthy lifestyle, the researchers suggested. For the study, the team looked at data for 30,000 women who had given birth between one and four times.\n\nAlthough all the women gain weight due to their age, there was a sharp difference between those who gave birth and those who did not. By the time their children were toddler age, mothers who had given birth had put on at least one pound more each year than those who were childless.\n\n\n\nTo read stories offline: Download Eenaduindia app.",

The B cell\u2013depleting anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab failed to improve lupus in two clinical trials, but these patients may have had incomplete or transient B cell depletion. To improve B cell depletion, Kansal\u00a0et al. engineered CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) CD8+\u00a0T cells and used them to treat lupus-prone mice. A single dose of CAR T cells depleted CD19+\u00a0B cells for up to a year, abolished the production of autoantigens, reversed tissue injury, and extended lifespan in two different strains of lupus-prone mice. CAR T cells were long-lived in the circulation and appeared to adopt a central memory T cell phenotype. T cells from the spleens of CAR-treated mice were able to transfer B cell depletion and disease remission to na\u00efve autoimmune mice, confirming that T cells were responsible for disease control. Circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibody levels remained normal in CAR T treated MRLfas\/fas\u00a0(MRL-lpr) lupus-prone mice, likely because long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow and some splenic B cells were spared. CAR T cells directly kill B cells, whereas monoclonal antibodies rely on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity for B cell depletion, an immune mechanism that is blunted in patients with SLE.\n\nThese studies highlight a novel method of inducing sustained B cell depletion that overcomes current limitations in monoclonal antibody therapy and may hold promise for the treatment of patients with severe SLE.\n\nLead Research\/Investigator\n\nRachael A.

        "text":"Here's another reason to lift weights\n\nBy Jamie Ducharme\nMay 10, 2018\n\nStrength training is good for your body and your mind, according to a new review of more than 30 previously published studies.\n\nThe paper, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, found that resistance exercise training (RET), such as weightlifting and strength training, is associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. It also, of course, comes with physical benefits, like making bones stronger and preventing chronic conditions.\n\nBrett Gordon, the paper\u2019s first author and a postgraduate researcher in the department of physical education and sports sciences at Ireland\u2019s University of Limerick, stops short of calling resistance training a cure for depression, but he says the findings are compelling, especially since it\u2019s accessible, affordable and possible to do at home.\n\nAnd it seems to work as well as the frontline treatments for depression\u2014antidepressants and behavioral therapies\u2014Gordon says in an email to TIME. Because the study was based on past research, however, it wasn\u2019t possible to tell from this paper exactly why that might be the case, or to prove a definitive cause-and-effect relationship. But other research suggests that by increasing blood flow to the brain, exercise can change the structure and function of the brain, create new brain cells and trigger the release of mood-enhancing chemicals like endorphins.\n\nGordon and his colleagues analyzed 33 clinical trials\u2014including nearly 2,000 people in totalthat examined the effects of resistance exercise training on symptoms of depression. Across the board, they found that strength training was associated with improvements in depressive symptoms such as low mood, a loss of interest in activities and feelings of worthlessness, regardless of a person\u2019s age, sex, health status, specific exercise routine or improvements in physical strength.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, larger improvements were found among adults with depressive symptoms indicative of mild-to-moderate depression compared to adults without such scores, suggesting RET may be particularly effective for those with greater depressive symptoms,\u201d Gordon says.\n\nSince the researchers saw improvements associated with a wide range of strength-training programs, Gordon says he can\u2019t name a single best exercise regimen for your mental health. (There was, however, some evidence to support the effects of supervised routines shorter than 45 minutes.) He recommends following the guidelines provided by the American College of Sports Medicine: doing strength training at least two days per week by performing eight to 12 repetitions of eight to 10 different strength-building exercises each time.\n\nWhile the current review specifically examined resistance training, plenty of evidence suggests that other forms of physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, cardio and yoga, may also improve depressive symptoms. A secondary analysis included in the JAMA paper also found no significant difference in the effects of RET versus aerobic exercise for alleviating depressive symptoms, Gordon says.\n\nOf course, the factors that dictate mental health are complicated. Lifting weights may not be enough to wipe out depressive symptoms entirely, and it can be difficult to find the energy or motivation to start a new exercise regimen if you\u2019re already struggling with depression. Nonetheless, Gordan says the new review adds weight to the argument that resistance training can be a powerful tool for improving mental health.\n\nThis Story Originally Appeared On Time",

The rate that the cases are coming in has been stable and manageable.\u201d\n\nThe health agency is recommending that people who have not gotten their vaccinations and\/or booster, do so. People should also consider wearing face masks in some scenarios.\n\n\u201cThe outbreaks we have been seeing lately have to do with large gatherings that have been in closed spaces,\u201d Kaur said. \u201cWe recommend that people wear masks in high congregation areas, especially if the ventilation is poor. People should also test themselves before going to any large gathering.\n\n\u201cProtection is a package deal and people should access their risk and how much it might impact them if they get sick,\u201d Kaur said.\n\nThe omicron variant and the subvariants of BA.4, BA.5 and now BA.2.75 have been shown to be more transmissible than other variants, which is what is driving up the case count across the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, there are more options available for treatments.\n\n\u201cWhile all layers of protection can prevent severe infection, we now have so many tools to prevent hospitalization and death, including monoclonal antibodies, antiviral treatments, etc., \u201cKaur said. \u201cHopefully, everyone utilizes what works best for them to stay protected.\u201d\n\nThat particularly applies to individuals who are immunocompromised and want to stay protected, but haven\u2019t received a vaccine. It\u2019s suggested they contact their primary care physician to determine what is the best option.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 57 percent of the population in Stanislaus County is fully vaccinated. There are 88 people currently hospitalized and there have been four recent deaths. The testing positivity rate for the seven-day average was 19.74%.\n\nStarting Aug. 1, the health agency will be returning to a pre-pandemic model for vaccinations, in that people with private insurance will need to seek vaccinations and boosters from their healthcare provider.\n\nTo book a vaccination or booster, visit",

Since people typically visit the dentist twice a year, shouldn't a horse's teeth be examined by a veterinarian just as often?\n\nAccording to Dr. Scott Austin, an equine veterinarian at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Urbana, horses between 2 and 5 years of age should have two dental exams each year. This allows the veterinarian to address problems related to the eruption of permanent teeth.\n\nIf things are proceeding normally, teeth should be checked once a year after that. Horses after age 15 might have issues that need to be addressed more frequently, and therefore their teeth should be examined twice a year.\n\n\"Although you can get an impression that the upper teeth are sharp by observing a reaction when the horse's cheek is pressed against the edge of the upper teeth, sedation is recommended to perform a complete examination of the horse's teeth,\" Austin said. \"You need to look into the back of the mouth and palpate all the teeth to fully evaluate the oral cavity.\"\n\nAll teeth should be examined to make sure they are not loose, as this is a common problem in older horses. A veterinarian will \"float\" the teeth, a process that involves filing any sharp points and adjusting teeth with abnormal wear.\n\nThis is important because horses' teeth grow continuously throughout their life, a condition called \"hypsodont,\" and the teeth need to be kept even to ensure precise chewing.\n\n\"Horses that live indoors typically require more dentistry,\" Austin said, \"because they spend less time chewing compared with horses that are on pasture and spend more time grazing. Less time chewing often means more sharp teeth, which can irritate and cause a horse pain if not routinely checked.\"\n\nCommon dental problems and diseases among horses include sharp enamel points, mal-eruptions (retained baby teeth), pulling wolf teeth, broken teeth, periodontal diseases and tooth loss. Very old horses can run out of teeth as their cheek teeth are ground down throughout their life.\n\nSigns that a horse might need to have its teeth examined include avoiding grain, dropping feed while chewing, feed retention, foul smell in the oral cavity, feed refusal, nasal discharge and rotating the head while chewing to get food to the \"good side\" of the mouth. Performance-related issues that might indicate dental problems in horses with a bit in their mouth include refusal to work and head tossing.\n\nAustin recommends feeding horses less concentrates and more roughage, which will allow the teeth to wear correctly. He also advises having horses' teeth examined by a veterinarian regularly to avoid problems.\n\nAn archive of pet columns from the UI College of Veterinary Medicine is available at Requests for reprints of this article may be directed to Chris Beuoy,\n\nSections (1):Living\n\nComments embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

        "text":"Cell Transplant Repairs Diseased Nervous System In Dogs\n\nDecember 31, 1996\n\nApplication Seen For Multiple Sclerosis In Humans\n\nMADISON -- In a hopeful new development for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), researchers have shown in studies with dogs that they can repair diseased areas of the spinal cord by transplanting nervous system cells into the animals.\n\nScientists at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine and collaborators report the finding in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.\n\n\"We are cautiously optimistic that the success we have achieved in dogs may become the best hope available for repair of lesions in people with chronic MS and related disorders,\" said Dr. Ian Duncan, professor of Veterinary Medicine, who directed the research. \"But several scientific questions must be answered before testing in humans can begin. We hope to have these answers within the next two years.\"\n\nDuncan stressed that transplant therapy for MS would need to be combined with drugs that lessen or prevent on-going disease. While MS is usually widespread throughout the central nervous system, in many patients it causes chronic lesions of the spinal cord, and such patients might be appropriate first candidates for the therapy, he said.\n\nMS is a complex, chronic disease affecting myelin, the sheaths that surround nerve cells. Patches of demyelination, or lesions, along nerve cells can result in weakness, incoordination, and speech and vision disturbances. As many as 300,000 people in the United States have MS, which usually strikes young adults.\n\nSome MS researchers have been encouraged by the recent success of fetal tissue transplantation into patients with Parkinson1s disease, noted Duncan.\n\n\"This has been an important precedent,\" he said. \"These advances have shown us that nerve cells can be transplanted safely and effectively, and can survive long-term in the human brain without significant complications in the majority of patients.\"\n\nBuoyed by the Parkinson1s transplant experiences and progress resulting from his own years of research and that of others on myelinating disorders in rodents, Duncan recently turned his attention to a family of dogs born with a genetic mutation affecting central nervous system myelin. Although not identical to MS, the dog model offers many similarities.\n\nResearchers transplanted glial cells, the supporting structure of nervous system tissue, from healthy newborn pups or fetuses into six of the abnormal dogs ranging in age from two to 32 weeks. All of the dogs exhibited myelin growth at the site of the transplant and in adjacent areas, including one dog in which growth was noted for 27 weeks.\n\n\"A dramatic result of these experiments was the degree of myelination - seen as thick and well-compacted sheathing - achieved by the transplanted cells,\" said Duncan. \"However, the extent of myelination in dogs that received the fetal glial cells was even more remarkable.\"\n\nThe fetal cell transplants yielded growth well beyond the graft site, said Duncan, noting that migration of the cells and subsequent myelination was far greater than he and others had observed in earlier experiments with rodents. The experiments in dogs were the most relevant to humans undertaken to date, he added.\n\nThe UW scientist was especially encouraged to observe that nerve cells in the mature dog could also be myelinated by the transplanted glial cells. \"This is encouraging with regard to human transplantation, since most myelin disorders in humans occur in early adulthood,\" he said.\n\nMS and spinal cord injuries can also produce gliosis, a reaction that results in excess tissue around demyelinated nerve cells that may serve as a barrier to remyelination. Gliosis also occurs naturally with age in the dogs Duncan studied.\n\n\"We showed we could transplant cells into a mature animal with gliosis and still achieve significant myelination,\" he said. \"This has started us thinking that gliosis in MS may not be an absolute barrier to repair, as previously believed.\"\n\nDuncan said his group has targeted MS with this research, but several other disorders characterized by demyelination may benefit from the transplant technique.\n\nThe Wisconsin work is supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Myelin Project, an international task force of scientists working on myelin and remyelination founded by Augusto and Michaela Odone of Lorenzo's Oil fame.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nRelated Multiple Sclerosis Articles from Brightsurf:\n\nNew therapy improves treatment for multiple sclerosis\nA new therapy that binds a cytokine to a blood protein shows potential in treating multiple sclerosis, and may even prevent it.\n\n'Reelin' in a new treatment for multiple sclerosis\nIn an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), decreasing the amount of a protein made in the liver significantly protected against development of the disease's characteristic symptoms and promoted recovery in symptomatic animals, UTSW scientists report.\n\nNot all multiple sclerosis-like diseases are alike\nScientists say some myelin-damaging disorders have a distinctive pathology that groups them into a unique disease entity.\n\nNew therapeutic options for multiple sclerosis in sight\nStrategies for treating multiple sclerosis have so far focused primarily on T and B cells.\n\nDiet has an impact on the multiple sclerosis disease course\nThe short-chain fatty acid propionic acid influences the intestine-mediated immune regulation in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nThe gut may be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis\nIt is incompletely understood which factors in patients with multiple sclerosis act as a trigger for the immune system to attack the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSlowing the progression of multiple sclerosis\nOver 77,000 Canadians are living with multiple sclerosis, a disease whose causes still remain unknown.\n\n7T MRI offers new insights into multiple sclerosis\nInvestigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital have completed a new study using 7 Tesla (7T) MRI -- a far more powerful imaging technology -- to further examine LME in MS patients\n\nHow to improve multiple sclerosis therapy\nMedications currently used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) can merely reduce relapses during the initial relapsing-remitting phase.\n\nVaccinations not a risk factor for multiple sclerosis\nData from over 12,000 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients formed the basis of a study by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) which investigated the population's vaccination behavior in relation to MS.\n\nRead More: Multiple Sclerosis News and Multiple Sclerosis Current Events\nBrightsurf.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.",

REUTERS\/George Frey\/File Photo ORG XMIT: FW1George Frey \/ REUTERS\n\nA group of conservative U.S. doctors has sued the Food and Drug Administration for limiting use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, arguing that the therapy should be made widely available to fight the pandemic.\n\nThe lawsuit represents the latest front in a highly politicized U.S. debate over access to hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been championed by President Donald Trump as a potential \u201cgame-changer\u201d against the coronavirus, but its value has yet to be established. A clinical trial released on Wednesday found it to be ineffective in preventing infection.\n\nThe FDA, which regulates medicines in the United States, has restricted use of the drug from the national stockpile to COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized and cannot enroll in a clinical trial. States can set their own rules for prescription, with many influenced by the FDA\u2019s warning that the drug has a risk of a side-effect of dangerous heart arrhythmias.\n\nThat harms the rights of its member doctors to prescribe as they see fit, causing \u201ceconomic injury,\u201d the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) argues in its suit, filed in a Michigan federal district court on Tuesday.\n\nAn FDA agency spokesperson said it does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation.\n\nIn a statement published online last week, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency does not prohibit physicians from prescribing medications. \u201cIt is important that patients and health care providers understand the known side effects of these drugs, including serious and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm problems,\u201d he said.\n\nThe AAPS, a non-profit organization based in Tucson, Arizona, has a \u201cfew thousand\u201d members, according to executive director Jane Orient. It opposes mandatory vaccination, previously waged a campaign against healthcare reforms introduced by former President Barack Obama, and has been pushing back against state restrictions on use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive therapy for the coronavirus.\n\nAAPS has accused state and federal agencies of \u201choarding\u201d hydroxychloroquine while patients die in an outbreak that has killed over 107,000 and infected 1.86 million in the United States to date.\n\nThe group is running a series of online seminars for doctors on the coronavirus. General counsel Andrew Schlafly discussed legal issues related to prescribing hydroxychloroquine on one in April.\n\n\u201cThey could pump out 100 million doses of these things within a week. Everybody in our country could be given them, and that would stop this crisis overnight, most likely,\u201d said Schlafly, who is not a doctor.\n\nRichard Chaisson, a Johns Hopkins researcher, is running a trial of the drug to determine whether it is effective in treating patients with moderate to severe versions of the disease.\n\n\u201cRight now, the data for hydroxychloroquine is not compelling for any group,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cUntil it\u2019s been studied, I really think it\u2019s irresponsible to recommend it routinely outside of a clinical trial.\u201d\n\nSchlafly said in response: \u201cI disagree completely\u2026 the data is that the medication is very safe.\u201d\n\nMore than 35 states have restricted prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine, and at least five of those have rules specifically prohibiting prescribing the drug as a preventive measure.\n\nThis Week's Flyers\n\n\nWe encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

The vaccine was grown by supervision scientists during a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), partial of a National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIAID is heading a trial, that aims to enroll during slightest 2,490 healthy participants in areas of reliable or intensity active mosquito-transmitted Zika infection, including a continental United States and Puerto Rico, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, Panama and Mexico. The two-part trial, called VRC 705, serve evaluates a vaccine\u2019s reserve and ability to kindle an defence response in participants, and assesses a optimal sip for administration. It also will try to establish if a vaccine can effectively forestall illness caused by Zika infection.\n\nA vial of a NIAID Zika Virus Investigational DNA Vaccine. Image credit: NIAID\n\nMost people with Zika infection have possibly no or usually amiable symptoms, such as fever, rash, corner pain and conjunctivitis (red eyes). However, when Zika infection occurs during pregnancy, a profound lady can pass a pathogen to her fetus, that can outcome in a operation of fetal defects famous collectively as inborn Zika syndrome. Currently there is no protected vaccine to forestall illness caused by Zika infection, that is especially transmitted around a punch of putrescent Aedes aegypti mosquitoes though also can be transmitted sexually.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified to have modernized fast one of NIAID\u2019s initial Zika vaccines into this subsequent theatre of contrast in volunteers. We design this investigate will produce profitable discernment into a vaccine\u2019s reserve and ability to forestall illness caused by Zika infection,\u201d pronounced NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cA protected and effective Zika vaccine is urgently indispensable to forestall a often-devastating birth defects that can outcome from Zika pathogen infection during pregnancy. Evidence also is accumulating that Zika can means a accumulation of health problems in adults as well. This hearing outlines a poignant miracle in a efforts to rise countermeasures for a pestilence in progress.\u201d\n\nScientists during NIAID\u2019s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) grown a NIAID Zika pathogen investigational DNA vaccine. It entered early-stage tellurian contrast in 2016 following endless contrast in animal models. Initial commentary prove a vaccine is protected and means to satisfy a neutralizing antibody response opposite Zika virus. The Phase 2\/2b hearing aims to benefit some-more reserve and defence response information and establish if this defence response protects opposite illness caused by healthy Zika infection.\n\nThe Zika vaccine height is formed on a plan VRC scientists used formerly to rise a West Nile pathogen vaccine candidate. The Zika vaccine claimant being tested in this investigate contains a tiny round square of DNA called a plasmid into that scientists have extrinsic genes that encode dual proteins found on a aspect of a Zika virus. Once injected into muscle, a encoded proteins arrange into particles that impersonate Zika pathogen and trigger a body\u2019s defence complement to respond. The vaccine does not enclose spreading material, so it can't means Zika infection.\n\nThe hearing is being led by custom co-chairs Julie E. Ledgerwood, D.O., arch of VRC\u2019s Clinical Trials Program, and Grace L. Chen, M.D., emissary arch of a same program.\n\nThe hearing consists of dual studies: partial A and partial B. Part A will build on ongoing Phase 1 trials to serve weigh a vaccine\u2019s reserve and ability to kindle an defence response, privately in populations where Zika could be endemic. It will also assistance establish a optimal sip and injection sites for administration. Part A will enroll 90 healthy organisation and non-pregnant women ages 18-35 years during 3 sites in Houston, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. All participants will accept a investigational vaccine intramuscularly during 3 detached hospital visits any 4 weeks apart. Participants will be incidentally reserved to accept possibly a customary sip or a high sip of a investigational vaccine during all 3 visits, and will be followed for about 32 weeks total.\n\nPart B of a hearing will enroll during slightest 2,400 healthy organisation and non-pregnant women ages 15-35 years. This partial of a hearing aims to establish if a vaccine can effectively strengthen opposite Zika-related illness when someone is naturally unprotected to a virus. Sites will embody a 3 locations from partial A (Houston, Miami and San Juan) as good as dual additional sites in San Juan, dual sites in Costa Rica, and one site any in Peru, Brazil, Panama and Mexico. Additional sites competence be combined in a future. Participants will be incidentally reserved to accept possibly a investigational vaccine or a remedy during 3 detached hospital visits any 4 weeks apart. The hearing is double-blind, definition conjunction a investigate investigators nor a participants will know who receives a investigational vaccine.\n\nPart B participants will be followed for scarcely dual years, during that time they will bear assessments for inauspicious events and symptoms of Zika infection. Trial participants in both tools will be counseled on how to strengthen opposite Zika infection. Investigators will examination a rates of reliable cases of Zika in a remedy organisation and a vaccinated organisation to establish if a investigational vaccine protects opposite illness caused by Zika infection.\n\nEach site will have a principal questioner obliged for ensuring daily examination of reserve information as they turn available. A custom reserve examination group that includes a custom chairs and other medical officers during NIAID will examination reserve information reports weekly. The NIAID Intramural Data and Safety Monitoring Board will also examination accumulative investigate information during slightest twice per year. The investigate is now approaching to be finished by 2019.\n\nSource: NIH\n\nComment this news or article",

        "text":"Livestock Pose Giant Threat to British Vets\n\nMany large animal veterinarians are injured on the job, a BVA survey finds.\n\nThe United Kingdom had nearly 10 million head of cattle in 2013, according to government figures.\n\nBritish Veterinary Association\n\nSuggested Veterinary Products\n\nDon\u2019t be careless around bulls and other large animals.\n\nThat\u2019s the advice of the British Veterinary Association, which found that more than half of veterinarians working with production animals on farms had been injured over the previous 12 months.\n\nEven interacting with smaller livestock can be dangerous. \u201cKicked in the side of the head while castrating a calf\u201d was among the responses to BVA\u2019s Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey.\n\nAmong wounded practitioners, nearly 1-in-5 classified their injuries as \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cquite\u201d severe.\n\n\u201cBy far the most common injury was bruising caused by kicks, with almost 85 percent of production animal vets who had been injured reporting this,\u201d BVA stated in July as part of Farm Safety Week. \u201cOther injuries reported included lacerations, crush injuries, head injuries caused by kicks and fractures caused by kicks.\u201d\n\nOne large animal veterinarian recalled being targeted by a pair of bulls.\n\n\u201cBruised and shocked,\u201d the practitioner stated. \u201cBoth attacks [while] doing whole herd testing on separate bulls, one stock and one beef bull. Both attacked from behind on a farm with poor facilities.\u201d\n\nAnother complained of \u201ccattle crushes and squashed body parts.\u201d\n\nVeterinarians and farm owners must be safety conscious, said BVA President John Blackwell, BVSc, MRCVS.\n\n\u201cThese figures show the risk of injury that production animal vets run in the course of their work,\u201d Dr. Blackwell said.\n\n\u201cFarmers and vets up and down the country have seen colleagues injured on farms and consequently unable to work,\u201d he added. \u201cMany injuries are avoidable if veterinary practices, their employees and farmers all take action to minimize the risks.\u201d\n\nBVA publishes advice for both trades.

        "text":"YOU ARE HERE: LAT HomeCollections\n\nBay Area Physician Overload: Shape of Future?\n\nAugust 30, 1987|ALLAN PARACHINI | Times Staff Writer\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Dr. Lorne Rosenfield and his wife, Gina, are just settling into their apartment in the affluent Marina district here. There isn't even a couch in the living room yet. For the moment, a pile of pillows suffices.\n\nEven inside the apartment, Rosenfield keeps a beeper on his belt and a telephone close at hand. Packed and available to be picked up and tossed into the car on a moment's notice is a case of medical equipment essential to his specialty--plastic surgery.\n\nSitting in the dining room, which contains only a newly purchased table and chairs, Rosenfield ponders these preparations for potential operations and quips, \"It's: 'Have plastics, will travel.' \" In his first six weeks, the beeper went off only four times.\n\nRosenfield is engaged in an exercise even he calls \"Darwinian.\" Other observers of the health care scene here are not that optimistic. Joan Trauner, a health economist and historian, sums up the chances for success of any young physician trying to establish a new solo practice in San Francisco--as Rosenfield is--in one word: \"zilch.\"\n\nThe word describes a brutal reality: There is one doctor in San Francisco for every 159 residents, the highest ratio in California and the fourth highest in the country. Neighboring Marin County has one doctor for every 239 residents.\n\nThese figures make San Francisco one of the world's most over-doctored cities--a place where even top graduates of residency training programs are starting to find up to 12 qualified applicants for every job, even those at prepaid health programs like the Kaiser Plan.\n\nA Specialist Problem\n\nA year ago, Trauner and Harold Luft, another UC health policy analyst, published what is thought to be the first detailed analysis of what is happening here, concluding that economic pressures will inevitably force doctors to accept affiliation with large clinics and other alternatives to the traditional solo-practice. Specialists face the worst problem. Hospitals are likely to tighten requirements for membership on their medical staffs, the UC study concluded.\n\nThe glut here illustrates one of several compelling reasons why, in the view of a growing number of health economists, the American health care delivery system may well have to consider the concept of a system of national health insurance. With too many physicians available, they say, too many hospital stays occur, too many tests are performed and too much medicine is practiced as doctors struggle to survive economically.\n\nSan Francisco has 734,600 residents and 4,609 doctors, 3,853 of whom are involved in patient care.\n\nLosing Money\n\nDr. Russ Granich, an internal medicine specialist, is trying to be one of them. He bought out a retiring doctor's office on Van Ness Avenue for $45,000 14 months ago, but with monthly overhead expenses of between $5,000 and $6,000 and a workload that averages only about 30 patient visits a week, he is losing money. He had hoped at least reach the break-even point after a year in business, even allowing for taking no salary himself.\n\n\"I've been a little depressed about it,\" he said.\n\nTo make ends meet, Granich drives an hour and 20 minutes south to Santa Cruz two days a week to work in a community hospital emergency room. He goes that far, he said, so no physician here will suspect him of scheming to steal scarce patients.\n\nGranich says he may have to quit medicine within five years if things don't improve. But he will leave medicine, he says, before he leaves San Francisco. \"I'm not going to leave town,\" he said, but \"I question my decision of trying to make it as a physician.\"\n\nSo intense is the attraction of San Francisco that young doctors continue to move here--or attempt to stay after they finish Bay Area residencies--and the advice of Trauner and virtually every health policy observer in the city often goes unheeded.\n\nThe doctor-population ratio in San Francisco is beaten by Manhattan (where there is one doctor for every 107 people) and Boston (one doctor per 121). By contrast, nationwide, there is one physician for every 455 people, one for every 418 statewide and one for every 373 in Los Angeles County.\n\nDr. R. Eugene Tolls, president of the San Francisco Medical Society, said many economically strapped hospitals face failure within the next half-decade no matter what they do and such hospital closures will inevitably spur large numbers of local doctors to search for more patients.\n\nBucking the Odds\n\nRosenfield chose to disregard these odds because he had done his general surgery training here, was familiar with the Bay Area and had contacts among established doctors he thought would refer him patients. He moved here, he said, primarily due to the same appeal San Francisco has for many.\n\n\"I like the Bay Area,\" he said. \"The key is you should go where you want to live. If not, you wake up five years later and, even though you may be more financially successful, you're unhappy.\"\n\nLos Angeles Times Articles",
