However this is not recommended and we cannot guarantee to fix any SURFCAM or Part Modeler issues specifically related to these operating systems.\n  \u2022 The Sentinel RMS license server runs as a system service on Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003 (32-bit and 64-bit), Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit), Server 2008 R2 (64-bit), Server 2012 (64-bit) and Windows 7. Sentinel RMS network licenses can be installed on virtual servers provided that they are locked to a Safenet Computer ID USB key. Standalone (single seat) Sentinel RMS licenses cannot be locked against the new keys for use on a virtual server.\n  \u2022 It is not recommended to have multiple SURFCAM versions installed on the same computer when the user has limited rights or UAC is ON as this may potentially cause problems with Simulator. ClosedMore info...\n  \u2022 Domain Controllers are not supported for ToolStore Server and SURFCAM due to SQL limitations.\n  \u2022 Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Vista are no longer supported by SURFCAM.\n  \u2022 Windows 8 RT is not supported by SURFCAM.\n  \u2022 SQL Express 2014 has a memory limit of 1 GB and a Database size limit of 10 GB. Performance issues may arise if the database is near this limit. To avoid these issues, if several job images are required, we recommend that they are not stored in the database. Job images can be extracted from the database using a command line option (tsadmin \/ExtractJim) which will extract the job images to the ToolStore support folder, JobImages. Please ensure that the server has enough memory to handle the database, if it is not an Express version.\n\nMinimum Specifications\n\n  \u2022 64-bit Intel Pentium 4 processor (2 GHz or faster), Intel Xeon, Intel Core, AMD Athlon 64, AMD Opteron, AMD Phenom or later, in single, dual or quad core versions\n  \u2022 4 GB of RAM\n  \u2022 10 GB free disk space for the SURFCAM installation\n  \u2022 17\" Colour monitor (1280 x 1024 screen resolution)\n  \u2022 Mouse including wheel (Intellimouse)\n  \u2022 SpaceMouse\/SpaceBall (optional)\n  \u2022 Network card\n  \u2022 Internet Explorer 8 or above\n  \u2022 Internet connection for license activation\/updates\n  \u2022 USB port for the SURFCAM security key (unless using keyless licensing)\n\nTo make the most of background processing and multi-threading, we recommend a 64-bit operating system and 2GB RAM for each processor as a minimum.\n\nGraphics cards\n\n  \u2022 NVIDIA Quadro range\n  \u2022 AMD Fire Pro range\n  \u2022 AMD Fire GL range\n  \u2022 Intel HD range \u2013 5000, 4400, 4200\n\nNote: Some older cards in the ranges above may no longer be supported. Please check the relevant supplier to see if an up to date driver is available for your operating system:\n\nThe ToolStore Server installer will install the following items if they are not already present on your system:\n  \u2022 .NET Framework version 3.5 SP1 (includes .NET Framework version 2.0)\n  \u2022 .NET Framework version 4\n  \u2022 Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Setup\n  \u2022 Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Setup\n  \u2022 Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Setup\n\nThe Live Job Reports Server does not support Windows XP or Windows Server 2003; only Vista \/ 7 \/ 8 and Server 2008 up to 2012 R2 are supported. The Live Job Reports client requires one of the following web browsers:\n\n  \u2022 Internet Explorer 10,\n  \u2022 Google Chrome 28,\n  \u2022 Firefox 22 or above.",

Information gathered through this channel can help Intuit create patch updates that will improve the program.\n\n\nSolution 1: Identify how many users are affected\n\nQuick tip If you don't use a username to open your company file or there are no other users that can access your company file, skip to Solution 2.\n\nIdentify how many users are affected by using a different login credential to open the same company file. If the error only happens in one specific user, that user credential might be damaged. If so, recreate the damaged user.\n\nA regular user is damaged\n\n  1. From the Company menu, select Set Up Users and Passwords and click Set Up Users.\n\n  2. Enterprise users: Company > Users > Set Up Users and Roles.\n\n  3.

User-added image\n\nSolution 3: Open a sample company file\n\nOpening a sample company file helps you identify if the problem lies with your company file or QuickBooks Application. If the sample file opens, possibly your QuickBooks file is damaged or the folder where the company file is saved is damaged. Try copying the file to a different location and if the error persists, use a recent backup or ADR to restore your file. Perform basic data damage troubleshooting if your backup or ADR is not enough to get you back on track however, if the sample file produces the same error message, proceed to solution 3.\n\nTo open a sample file:\n\n  1. From the QuickBooks No Company Open window, click Open a sample file.\n\n  2. Select any sample file on the list.\n\n\nTo copy the company file on a different location\n\nCopying and opening the company file from a different location can identify if the folder where the company file is saved is damaged or \"too deep\", it exceeded the file system path limitation. If you receive the same error after moving the company file in a different location, the company file or your QuickBooks installation is probably damaged.\n\n  1. Right-click your Desktop, select New and click Folder. Name the folder QBTEST\n\n  2. Open the folder where the company file is saved.\n\n  3. Right-click the file and select Copy.\n\n  4.

Open the company file from the QBTEST folder.\n\nSolution 4: Run reboot.bat\n\nRunning reboot.bat re-registers QuickBooks related .DLL and .OCX files that can help address unrecoverable errors.\n\nSolution 5: Troubleshoot the QuickBooks Desktop Application\n\n  1. Repair the QuickBooks installation\n\n  2. Download and run the QuickBooks Install Diagnostic tool.\n\n  3. Perform a reinstall using clean install.\n\n  4. Manually repair Microsoft components.

        "text":"Keep track of your customers\u2019 problems\n\nYour customer support team might deal with a range of customer queries - from feature requests to bugs, complaints or product feedback. You can keep track of the different kinds of requests and messages by labelling conversations. Over time, you will be able to identify a pattern of what your customers are actually trying to tell you. Based on this information, you can work on making your product\/service better.\n\nYour engineers will be interested in knowing the impact of their bugs and your design team will want to know if your customers are able to interact with the product smoothly. By labelling conversations and sharing your findings, you can make sure the right feedback is delivered to the right people in your company.\n\nNoteConversation Labels are available from Sprout plan. But \u00a0Label Reports are only available on Blossom and above plans.\n\nHow to create Conversation labels\n\nGo to Settings > Conversation Labels > Add Conversation Labels\n\nYou can create a Conversation label and also add multiple sub-categories under this Conversation label.\u00a0\n\nYou can only edit\/disable conversation labels and sub categories. You cannot delete it once created. To edit a converation label, click on the drop-down against the conversation label.\n\n\nOnly Freshchat agents with their role as Account Owner\/Admin will be able to create Conversation labels.\n\nHow to label a conversation\n\nWhen you resolve(close) a conversation you will be able to add a converation label to the conversation.\n\nSome examples\n\nFeature Request\n\nCustomers will almost always want more than what your product currently offers. But they\u2019re also telling you exactly what they want. Take advantage of this. By labeling conversations, you can understand what feature is requested more, and maybe even build your product roadmap around these most requested features. This will also help you understand how your product evolves.\n\nBug Report\n\nBugs are inevitable, even the best teams ship bugs. When a customer reports a bug to you, you need to let the relevant people know. You can label the conversation as a \u2018Bug report\u2019, assign it to the engineer who can fix it, and even add a private note if necessary. Don\u2019t forget to thank the customer for taking the time to report a bug, and if you want to create a wow moment, follow up and let them know once the bug is fixed.\u00a0\n\nChurn Feedback\n\nYou can label conversations of customers who are churning and overtime gather valuable feedback which will help you understand why they\u2019re leaving. You can prevent it from happening later in the future by taking necessary actions.\n\nHappy Customer\n\nWhen you get positive feedback on your product\/service you can tag those conversations with \u2018happy customer\u2019 label. It\u2019ll be easier to convey the positive comments to relevant teams or agents. For example, it\u2019s useful for a designer to know that the feature they designed is doing well and that customers are getting value from it. You can also create a repository of positive customer quotes that can be used in marketing materials. Most importantly, remember to thank the customer for taking the time to share their comments.\n\nIdentify trends in your customers\u2019 queries\u00a0\n\nWhen you and your team consistently keep tagging conversations, overtime you\u2019ll be able to gather valuable data on your how your product performs.\n\nYou can track conversation labels and over a period of time using Label reports in Freshchat.\u00a0\n\nClick on the Reports icon in the left menu bar and click on Conversation Labels.\n\nLabeling conversations with generic labels such as \u2018Bug\u2019 or \u2018Feature request\u2019 is good. But if you go one step further and add more specific labels related to a bug or feature you can track better. You can do this by adding sub-categories within a conversation label. Over time you can see which bugs impact your customers more or which feature requests are more common. This can help your team prioritize bug fixes and decide what features to build next.\u00a0\n\nYou can even download a report of these conversation labels and share it with relevant agents.",

If it does, check that the SQL Server Service and SQL Browser Service are running.\n\nIf the above does not resolve the problem:\n\n1)\u00a0Check if the client can ping the server.\n\n2) If you use a Firewall on your server, create 2 inbound exception rules for 4Matrix.

It should be submitted to a vendor, or Certificate Authority, which reviews the provided data and based on it, issues the SSL certificate.

An Internet site that has an SSL installed can be accessed with https:\/\/ instead of the usual http:\/\/ and the information submitted for the CSR will be viewed in standard text format through a web browser.\nSSL Certificate Generator in Website Hosting\nGiven that SSL certificates are among the services which we provide along with our website hosting packages, you will be able to obtain an SSL for any site hosted in an account here with just a couple of clicks. What is more, we have an auto-installer instrument, so once you approve the order via e-mail, our system will set everything up on your behalf and it'll install the certificate, the CSR as well as the 2 private keys.

In case you've chosen some other SSL service provider, you can only generate a Certificate Signing Request within your account on our end together with the unique private key, then save the CSR code and submit it to the other service provider.",
