And year after year, we give our everything, to get nothing in return. The time has come for things to change. We don't need your adoration, but we demand your respect. I will not allow anyone the opportunity to deny half a decade of labor. The places we've been, the faces we've seen, the months spent far from home. This is what moves us. This is what we've grown accustom to. What we will leave behind can not be measured in a dollar figure; there\u2019s a much deeper meaning than that. I can't wait until the day when we've surpassed everything that gave you a false sense of importance. I want you to question yourself, I want you to watch you slip away; I want you to realize that your existence has meant nothing. I hate you more than you could ever know, and I hate you for making me feel like this. I know deep down that I'm a good person. The best retaliation I can think of, would be to let you know that for once in my life, I'm truly happy. I'm more than content with who and where I am. Your oppression has had no effect. I don't need to justify my opinion after everything we've been through. And year after year, we give our everything and what we receive in return, I can't explain with words. I'm so fucking thankful that I made it to where I am today. (I watched the world upon your shoulders, and from these heights it's so far down.)\n\nCounterparts Merchandise",

Once the hot number among the not ready for real journalism tabloidistas, Bruni looked pretty pretty pale compared to the rich dark chocolate' of the American first lady.\n\nSources swear that no sooner had Michelle captured the paparazzi and their wordsmith jackals and Bruni was left a neglected wallflower, then Sarkozy was cozying up to the buff black lady. One techspert found no less than twelve sextmessages from Sar-cozy.cum to Michelle's email purported to be: blackobamamba.sick.\n\nGeeks, TEchslleks and flitterbegibbets frantically sought to break the encoded messages from Michelle's Blackblackberry with little success. There were some whispering silly nothings to BBallbama.afreakin. One moleskink swears that he has discovered a faintmail from her phone to a French internet service that has the partial cryptic message: Meat me in St Louis, Louie.

        "text":"Street Wars Hits London\n\nBy London_Sian Last edited 126 months ago\nStreet Wars Hits London\n\nRemember Derek? Our very own secret agent? Well he's still roaming the capital with his water pistol. He's not too happy with the pseudonym but appears to have forgiven us. And what a busy week he's had.\n\nFirst, there was a stakeout at an embassy. Sorry, even we don't know which one. Then he kills people and then has to do it again. Now before we go any further, let us stress to the said victim that this is a game. Games are much better for everyone when people play fair and don't be sore losers. Otherwise no one will want to play with you anymore and you'll have to go home to your mum. Derek certainly didn't want to be his friend now. He later sprayed him right in the face to prove that point. Go Derek! Go Derek! Londonist fears a team of cheerleaders might ruin his cover (even ones in camouflage) but you get the picture.\n\nNow, don't forget, while Derek is running around the streets of London trying to hunt people, he is also being tracked as well. Or is he? To be honest, Derek doesn't really seem to know of anyone hunting him most of the time. A few strange events, but nothing concrete has led us to question where Derek's assassin is and whether or not the pressure got too much and he went on holiday. Either that, or our Derek is far too sneaky and keeps out witting them at every turn. This is probably more likely. But Derek doesn't seem to be bothered. In fact we discovered, instead of playing shooting games in the rain, Derek decided to take it easy and play shooting games on his Playstation. Until Londonist had a word with him.\n\nA few stern words from Londonist later (we regret to inform you that 'Big girls' were mentioned) and Derek was back out in the field. Not long after, he reports to us that he's got the target in the bag! We are very happy, but all too aware that Miss Moneypenny never had to take such drastic measures. Hopefully Derek has now got a reboosted confidence and will get back out there to keep us all amused.\n\nThere's only one week left of Street Wars. This means one week of mayhem before 'sudden death' - a mass water squirting free for all which looks like so much fun we might even join in. But we'd just resort to squirting each other and our friends, which isn't really the point. Instead we'll leave it to the pros and keep you updated about what Derek is up to. Hopefully this will be shooting and killing and winning. Because it's not the taking part that counts. And you can tell our mums we said that.\n\nJust a game? No, it's much more than that. It's war.\n\nLast Updated 27 August 2007",

        "text":"More rpg\n\nFeb. 11th, 2007 02:51 pm\nenvy: (Default)\n[personal profile] envy\nSame rpg as the others.\n\nHogsmeade trip\nCharacters: Draco and Harry. (Harry is played by Lita; my favourite Harry on the entire internet! She plays him brilliantly and should play him more \/hint)\nRated: PG13\nAN \u2013 During a round of truth-or-dare in the dungeons one night, Daphne wrote a little note on Draco\u2019s behind. Waking up, none of the students could remember what had happened the night before and Draco was frankly horrified at the writing on his bum. In an effort to set his mind at rest, he decides to corner Potter and demand the truth about the writing on his arse.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Ron had had a run-in with a defective Pensive and lost about two weeks worth of memories.\n\nHarry had been on his way to the Three Broomsticks when a sign further down the road caught his eye. 'Weasley...no way!' he thought to himself. He quickened his pace, making his way past the windows of the tavern.\n\nJust as Draco picked up one of the butterbeers, he spotted the tell-tell sight of The Boy Wonder walking past the window, heading away from The Three Broomsticks.\n\n\"I..errhhh, I forgot, I have to go pick something up.\"\n\nDraco got up so fast the chair got knocked over, and raced out of the inn with a quick, \"Don't leave without me, I'll be back,\" and hurried down the busy street to catch up with the Gryffindor.\n\n\nHarry froze at the sound of his own name coming from a very familiar voice, practically unforgettable voice really. He turned slowly, squinting at the other boy, \"Malfoy. What do you want?\" he asked, crossing his arms over his chest defiantly.\n\nUnnerved and more then a little uncomfortable, Draco shifted his weight from one foot to the other, \"Potter, I...\" Draco cleared his throat and cursed his distinct lack of courage,\n\n\"Do you have any recollection of signing your name on something you shouldn't have?\"\n\nHe found this came out friendlier then intended and added a \"Potty\" for good measure.\n\nHarry stared at the Slytherin as if he'd gone mad.\n\n\"Have you gone mad? Why would I sign anything...hang on, why would you be asking me about it anyway? What's it got to do with you?\" he asked, still staring hard at the other boy.\n\nFrowning harder then ever, Draco hissed, \"Just tell me, did you write your name on anything... odd, lately?\"\n\nA faint flush spread across his cheekbones, no matter how hard he tried to will it away. \"And no, my mental health has never been better, Potter. Thank you for your concern.\"\n\n\"Malfoy, unless you're being delusional on purpose, I have not, nor ever will, sign anything...odd.\"\n\nHe then noticed the other boy's rather red face. \"What're you all worked up about then?\"\n\n\" You prat!\" Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and looked back up at the annoying Seeker.\n\n\"Did you, or did you not\u2026sign your name on my\u2026\" a small strangled whimper made it's way out of Draco's mouth from the sheer embarrassment, \"...on my... lower back side.\"\n\nHarry gawked at the blonde.\n\n\"Lower...backside? Are you talking about your arse? My name...on your arse?!\"\n\nHarry howled with laughter. \"Malfoy you must be insane! Why would I ever want my name on any part of your...person?!\"\n\n\"I don't know! If I knew I wouldn't be here, talking to you, now would I, Potter?\"\n\nDraco took a deep breath and sweet relief washed over him, \"So, you're positive you couldn't have ... signed your name? Of course, you couldn't have, you would have remembered.\"\n\nDraco was more then pleased about how this day was turning out. \"Good, that was all, Potter. Run along.\"\n\nHarry, still laughing, tried to get his words out as best he could, \"Malfoy...if...I...name...wrote...your backside...two weeks...memory gone!...doesn't say poof does it?!?!\" he breathed out before erupting into another laughter attack. He turned to walk away, his guffaws getting louder as he thought on it.\n\n\"M-memory charm?! Potter, wait!\"\n\nDraco grabbed the boy hard and turned him around forcefully, \"Now, when you say 'memory-charm', you were just joking, right?\"\n\nIt was getting harder and harder to breathe and Draco thought that maybe suffering from a full-blown panic-attack was just the thing at the moment.\n\n\"You're kidding?!?\"\n\nRon had emerged from the joke shop to se what all the noise on the street was about. He saw a group of ravenclaws and Slytherins a few shops over, one of the Slytherins was on the ground clucking and CHo Chang looked mad as a hornet, her wand drawn at her side while yet another Ravenclaw was picking leaves and twigs off his robes. 'Wonder what happened there.'\n\nHis attention was drawn further down the road by a familiar laugh and he grinned, having spotted Harry at last. He quickly made h is way over to his friend, intent on dragging him back to the joke shop. He noticed who was standing with him and quickened his pace, coming up on the two just in time to hear the tail end of their conversation.\n\n\"Malfoy's arse? What about Malfoy's arse? Harry, what's going on?\"\n\nHarry wrenched himself out of Draco's grasp and grinned up at his friend, the laughter still erupting from his mouth. He pointed at the Slytherin,\n\n\"Malfoy...my name...arse!\" he managed to wheeze out before starting into his laughing fit again. Any bystander might've thought he'd been hit with a tickling charm the way he was laughing.\n\n\"It's not FUNNY, POTTER! I HAVE TO WALK AROUND WITH IT, YOU IDIOTIC TWIT! AND IF IT'S YOUR FAULT, SO HELP ME MERLIN I WILL KILL YOU!\" Draco yelled, towering over Harry, completely ignoring the other Gryffindor at the scene.\n\nRon stared wide eyed at Harry. \"Your name on Draco's arse?\" Ron screwed up his face. \"That's disgusting...\"\n\nHis grimace quickly turned into a glare, however, as Draco began yelling at Harry in earnest. Ron stepped up when Draco actually threatened him.\n\n\"What did you say, Malfoy?\"\n\nRon put his hand on Draco's shoulder, squeezing painfully tight and pushing him away from Harry.\n\n\"You've only just got your prefect badge back... you'd better watch that mouth of yours. I'm pretty sure threatening another student's life is worth quite a bit more than a simple detention.\"\n\nHarry managed to lighten his laughter. He reached up a hand to Ron's arm and pulled him away from the other boy. \"Ron,\" he said with a grin, \"He's not worth it. And if he's...got my name on his...arse...then I'm sure he's punished enough.\" He turned to the Slytherin, his expression now serious, \"And yes Malfoy, I was serious about that memory charm. My memories of a chunk of two weeks are gone. So you'll just have to deal with it won't you?\" he asked, crossing his arms across his chest once more.\n\n\"Deal? Deal! I WILL NOT DEAL! AND YOU..\" he turned to the redhead hovering around Harry, \"What are you doing here anyways, Weasel? Not like your sort have money to spend, is it?\" Draco pulled his wand out and waved it threateningly in Harry's direction, \"If you did write it, you're dead, Potter. Remember that.\"\n\nStill not at all convinced that Potter did not write his name and that outrageous claim on his arse, Draco turned to go back to his fellow Slytherins in the Three Broomsticks.\n\nRon raised an eyebrow at Draco. \"I came down with the rest of the school, Malfoy. Or are you so stupid that you can't even remember things that happened just a few hours ago? And 'my sort'? Just exactly what would 'my sort' be?\"\n\nBy this time Harry had pulled out his own wand and pointed it directly between Draco's eyes. \"Malfoy, the next time you threaten me or my friends, remember that I'm not afraid to duel you. Your threats are nothing but that, threats. Words. Like the ones on your arse. So why don't you go back to your House Mates and leave \"our sort\" alone now won't you?\" He glared at the other boy through his glasses, his stare not wavering.\n\nHe smirked,\" You want to get your arse kicked again, do you Potter? Surely what ever is wrong with your head, didn't remove the defeat you suffered last time you were foolish enough challenge me.\" His wand trained on Harry's chest unwavering. \"And Weasel, you must know just what 'your sort' is, or are you even dumber then you look?\"\n\nRon shook his head and clicked his tongue. \"You heard Harry, shoo. Go on, beat it, you spoiled little brat. Go play big bad Mr. Malfoy with your own house, cause we're done wasting our time with you. Go on, little princess, get out of here.\"\n\nHis wand still pointed at the space between Draco's eyes, the space which he always presumed to be empty, Harry spoke again, \"Malfoy, give it a rest. Your bum probably needs one too from all the attention you're getting it. And really, I doubt it's even there because that's a rather pitiful excuse for trying to threaten me. So just run along, all right?\" Harry rolled his eyes, about to give up.\n\n\"I did not use my arse as an excuse, and do shut up, Weasel. No one wants to know what goes on in that empty little head of yours, and do leave me out of your sordid little fantasies.\"\n\nRon would have laughed at the absurdity of Draco's comment but he wasn't suite sure if the boy was kidding or not. 'That's disgusting.'\n\n\"Come on, Harry. Let's just go. He's obviously cracked... thinking anyone would be having fantasies about him. Nightmares more like.\" He tugged on Harry's sleeve, pointing him in the direction of the new WWW shop. \"Fred and George are here. New shop, come see it.\"\n\nHarry nodded, and idea brewing in his head. He smiled at the mention of the shop though, \"Right, I was on my way over there when, Malfoy, stopped me,\" he said, turning to make his way to the newest addition to Hogsmeade.\n\n\"That's more like it, Potter. Run along, and don't forget to drag Weasel here with you. Wouldn't want anyone seeing I was talking to you.\"\n\nHe turned and made his way past the two Gryffindors, towards the waiting butterbeer and Slytherins.\n\nRon raised an eyebrow at Harry as he walked with him toward the twins' shop. \"Doesn't want anyone to see he was talking to us? You two were kicking up enough racket to wake the dead. I reckon the ... (truncated)",
