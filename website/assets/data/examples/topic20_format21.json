        "text":"Minimalist apps are all the rage right now. The idea of cutting out all but the simplest of interface elements and focusing on letting the user complete a single task really well has inspired the likes of iA Writer, Clear and Byword. While some of The Next Web team adore this approach, I\u2019m sometimes left wondering whether these apps are really all they\u2019re cracked up to be.\n\nThis was particularly highlighted when I was recently pitched Pop, a notepad app for iOS that takes simplicity to its extreme by having no features at all. You get a white screen (with a tiny page curl in the corner for effect) and you type away. That\u2019s it. When you\u2019re done, you can copy and paste the text to wherever you want to use it.\n\nI\u2019ll admit \u2013 while I appreciate the hidden controls and subtle use of sound of the likes of OmmWriter Dana, Pop seemed to be taking things a step too far \u2013 to the point where it was simply laughing at those who bought it \u2013 \u201cHa, you paid 99 cents for a blank screen.\u201d\n\nHowever, Pop was released to a positive buzz, with favorable reviews, and it hit the top 25 rankings in the App Store\u2019s Productivity section within two days \u2013 so there\u2019s clearly a demand for it. To try to understand how the app came about and who it\u2019s designed for, I spoke to its UK-based designer, Colin McFarland.\n\nTNW: So, minimalist apps are the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes, right? I look at an app that\u2019s just a white screen and the ability to type text and I just think \u201cSurely that\u2019s just a \u2018My first text entry\u2019 app from a \u2018learn to code for iOS\u2019 course?\u201d Why wouldn\u2019t I just use the iOS Notes app?\n\nCM: Pop was designed for the single purpose of writing something down and worrying about what do with it later, hopefully Pop is invisible and you don\u2019t notice it at all, you came here to write something.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll use both \u2014 just like you have a few notebooks, post-its, or pieces of paper. Maybe Pop is all you need, or maybe it won\u2019t be useful for you. It\u2019s for you to decide its purpose.\u00a0If you just want to write something down, do you need more than \u2018a white screen and the ability to type text\u2019?\n\n\nTNW: But where does it end? Once you\u2019ve had an app that does nothing but let you type, is it possible to get any more minimal?\n\nCM: Pop wasn\u2019t designed to be the most minimal app, it was designed to only have the features that are necessary for quickly writing something down. Features exist where they are useful, like Copy All so you can get out quicker \u2014 with a word count as an after thought. Pop tries to make features invisible, so they don\u2019t get in the way.\n\nTNW: Okay, you\u2019re starting to sway me a little. Is there a temptation to add more features? How do you do that without losing that minimal feel?\n\nCM: The design was driven by a core philosophy: Feature number one should always be as few features as needed to perform the primary purpose. There are other things that could help serve the purpose, like synching between devices since Pop is a universal app. Again though, I\u2019m not interested in features getting in the way, any new features would need to remain invisible.\n\nTNW: Aside from Pop, what other minimalist apps would you recommend for people interested in the genre, and why?\n\nCM: I appreciate the simplicity of these apps, all-purpose built to do one thing well.\n\nInstapaper by Marco Arment (save pages to read them later),\u00a0Clear by Realmac Software: (to-do list with a completely gestural interface, not a button in sight),\u00a0Dot series by UsTwo (Minimal games created in 48 hours, start with the original DOT), The Accidental News Explorer by Brendan Dawes (A simple news app that lets you find something, then find something else).\n\nQ: So, what\u2019s next for you?\n\nCM: Maybe more from Pop, definitely more apps following the same philosophy.\n\n\u27a4\u00a0Pop for iOS",

Mentors are given wide leeway in determining if applicants are to be approved. 15:32:43 \" 15:32:47 a process hmmm lol 15:33:35 #link https:\/\/fedoraproject.org\/wiki\/Ambassadors_Join_choose_a_mentor 15:33:39 what an interesting page lol 15:33:56 :) 15:33:57 we have found some these we will need to update 15:34:30 #link https:\/\/fedoraproject.org\/wiki\/Ambassador_Candidate_Ticket_Management 15:35:05 Yes, that is very old. 15:35:12 #link https:\/\/fedoraproject.org\/wiki\/Ambassadors\/MembershipService 15:35:20 well mostly 3 years 15:35:45 I don't think the old structure is bad 15:35:54 I think it just needs a bit of updating 15:36:11 and to get to docs 15:36:21 and we need to mark these as out of date 15:36:30 thoughts? 15:37:11 bugsmith, would you like to share? 15:37:15 valid idea to garden the wiki... transfer them to docs 15:37:20 nb and sankarshan are probably good contacts, re: Ambassador mentorship 15:37:23 stories\/links welcome :) 15:37:42 hi 15:37:52 hi nb++ 15:38:06 nb, can you give us perspective on the ambassador mentorship part of the program 15:38:12 what worked well or didnt 15:38:30 Basically the process now is someone looks a t the https:\/\/fedoraproject.org\/wiki\/Ambassadors_Join_choose_a_mentor and makes contact with someone, and then when the mentor thinks they are ready, they sponsor them int othe ambassadors group 15:38:48 originally, they filed a ticket, and then approved it, and then FAmA sponsored them 15:38:55 Sure 15:38:57 but then it was decided by FAmSCo to make the mentors sponsors 15:39:20 A lot of it depends on the individual mentor and the candidate how long the process takes 15:39:44 I have heard the complaint \"I don't hear back from the mentor I emailed\" 15:40:07 So, I kinda think a ticket is better. It keeps the mentors accountable 15:40:25 I had went through a couple years ago and emailed the mentors and asked \"are you still avialable\" and updated the list 15:40:32 I think that should be done every so often 15:40:40 or at least, we can help find someone different for them to connect with 15:40:50 yeah, that might be good 15:40:51 yeah, nb we are putting that on the to do for the TTF to do now 15:41:15 I like the tickets based approach 15:41:43 I guess that would go to the ambassador repo 15:41:53 Yeah, that might be good. There's already a fama repo IIRC 15:41:59 which I think is what was used i nthe past 15:42:41 do you have a link nb 15:42:44 I found this 15:42:51 #link https:\/\/pagure.io\/ambassadors\/fedora-handbook 15:42:53 https:\/\/pagure.io\/fama 15:43:13 #link https:\/\/pagure.io\/fama\/issues 15:43:40 so same with this, it needs updating 15:44:38 I added the task here: https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/sgVnz6qm\/33-update-and-finalize-commops-team-structure 15:45:33 so I have a question, it may sound stupid, the idea was to have a process if I read the doc correctly, but doing differently with each mentor (\"wide leeway\") seems to not go in that direction, was there some baseline on how to decide who is approved or not ? 15:46:09 misc, here: https:\/\/fedoraproject.org\/wiki\/Ambassadors\/MembershipService 15:46:56 Should there be a membership agreement for ambassadors? 15:47:05 \" Change your first name and last name to Latin letters in the FAS if you filled your name in Cyrillic, Chinese, or other than Latin.\" mhh :\/ 15:47:18 Surrey if this is already answered. I'm just curious. 15:47:47 misc, all of those pages are way out of date 15:48:02 bugsmith, I don't know. 15:48:13 It is a good question to consider 15:48:21 It may feel like a higher... (truncated)",

        "text":"Posted on\n\nHey y\u2019all, Dux with AvePoint for another episode of Dux Quax. This time around I\u2019m became a member of by my pal Praveen Maloo, Product Evangelist for Microsoft once we discuss everything Microsoft Teams. Where we\u2019re where we\u2019re headed, make sure to look into the video below!\n\nDux: Hi, everybody! Welcome to Microsoft Tech Summit Sydney. Praveen, it\u2019s this type of phenomenal day, is it not?\n\nPraveen: It\u2019s. I had been here last year\u2019s Tech Summit, and we\u2019ve grown in dimensions a lot since this past year. This can be a brand-new space.\n\nDux: We\u2019ve, what, like, 3-4,000 consumers?\n\nPraveen: Yeah, between 3-4, yep.\n\nDux: Why do you not introduce yourself, Praveen?\n\nPraveen: Hi, everybody! I\u2019m Praveen. I\u2019m an item evangelist for Microsoft Teams. Things I do is, basically, discuss how Office 365 and Microsoft Teams can definitely allow you to develop a modern workplace. We\u2019re undergoing this type of huge change in the manner people work, the culture of labor, which just new method of working. Microsoft Teams can certainly help for the reason that journey. That\u2019s things i discuss.\n\nDux: Look, Praveen. I know you\u2019re so excited and ecstatic, because Microsoft Teams is really a new awesome kid, right? Within the last couple occasions, out of all keynotes, it\u2019s usually about Microsoft Teams. Why all of this excitement around Teams? Why are lots of customers benefiting from it?\n\nPraveen: Microsoft Teams really enables\u2026 It\u2019s not only a tool. It enables a different way of working. It\u2019s a cultural change, too. Such things as having the ability to operate in only one central hub, getting not to cope with ten different apps. It\u2019s really critical, right? Enable that seamless method of working, finding yourself in one central hub, and all sorts of your apps, and files, and content, people, and conversations, whatever you need, in a single central hub. Cognitive overload goes really lower. Your emails go lower. Productivity rises.\n\nDux: Guess what happens? For all of us, we like Microsoft Teams. Generate income take a look at Teams, it\u2019s my new Outlook. Sorry to individuals in Outlook, but, Microsoft Teams is my one-stop shop now, where I recieve the majority of my work done, frankly. With this week or this 2 days at Sydney, do you know the sessions that you\u2019re associated with, and just what are the things you\u2019re considering, and telling people about?\n\nPraveen: There exists a huge presence this season. This past year, at Sydney, we was without a Microsoft Teams session. We simply, within the preview mode, however this year, we\u2019re really big. We simply did a session today where they spoken about how exactly they\u2019ve grown out, really big, with Teams users, about 3,000 users on Teams.\n\nReally taking it one stage further with collaboration. The floor staff, and also the desktop workers, too, information workers. For the reason that session today, later within the mid-day there\u2019s an architecture session, goes much deeper into how Teams is made. Using the very best of SharePoint, and OneDrive, and all sorts of these Office applications.\n\nThen, tomorrow, we\u2019ve sessions on building apps for Microsoft Teams. We\u2019ve greater than 150 partners building apps. You are able to build one, too. If you are thinking about building enterprise dev apps, there is a session tomorrow, after which we\u2019re carrying out a workshop at a lot of our customers too, just walking them through using Teams, telling how they may benefit, just really rapidly, by enabling a few teams to begin using Teams.\n\nDux: Phenomenal. Introduced, now, at Tech Summit Sydney, the good thing is each one of these sessions are recorded. You should check it on Microsoft Tech Community, watching individuals wonderful Teams sessions. Praveen, I must inquire. You travel the planet, you speak with customers. Any tales that stick out for you personally, on the need for Microsoft Teams, with customers you speak with?\n\nPraveen: Certainly. Probably the most consistent tales that I have seen is the amount of teams using Teams to simply obtain work done, on the day-to-day basis. Artists are using lots of different applications, point-to-point solutions. They\u2019re one vendor for, your house, project management software tools. Another vendor to many other tool. With Microsoft Teams, it truly lessens the ramp-up time for you to bring somebody new to begin using Microsoft Teams for product management, for instance.\n\nDux: Having a planner integration.\n\nPraveen: Planner integration,\u00a0PowerBI\u00a0just searching at the dashboards every day, just keeping on the top of products, because make certain such fast-paced atmosphere, you\u2019d should be really quick when it comes to ramping up. Developing, norming, from the team, is actually quick.\n\nDux: Developing, norming performing, right?\n\nPraveen: That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been hearing consistently with many different customers at Ignite. We heard a great deal at Tech Summit. Today, I heard a great deal from your customers. Yeah.\n\nDux: We shouldn\u2019t find yourself in trouble at storming. You want to reach performing.\n\nPraveen: Performing.\n\nDux: Seems like lots of goodness is originating out, with Microsoft teams. Would you choose to share what\u2019s coming, and also the recent announcement especially around Skype? I understand there\u2019s many people are curious about that.\n\nPraveen: Jeeze! Yeah! Where will i start? Skype for Business and Teams integration is most likely the right place to begin. At Ignite, we announced that. \u201cHey, we\u2019re searching to getting communications abilities into Microsoft Teams.\n\nWhich means you\u2019re already residing in Teams, doing collaboration work, and it is natural that you simply communicate for the reason that one hub. Getting such things as calling, and program, web conference, and conferences, a variety of it has already been there in Microsoft Teams today. We\u2019re getting some advanced abilities during a period of time. Microsoft Teams become one central hub, one client for communications and collaboration needs.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just getting everything we have today in Skype for Business. It\u2019s infusing each one of these encounters with AI for instance. Searching at meeting existence cycle, transcription within the cloud, real-time translation. Really cutting-edge technology, and taking the very best of what we should been on Skype for Business, all of this great back-finish infrastructure, learning of worker, of 2 decades, and getting all of the goodness into Microsoft Teams.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the greatest bit of news, and I\u2019ve been speaking to numerous customers here. Apart from that, at Future Decoded, handful of days back, we announced Go Local Strategies. We\u2019ve began to create Teams data obtainable in local data centers, beginning with United kingdom and there exists a couple of new data centers coming within the next couple of several weeks, too.\n\nDux: And, within Australia, right? They their very own data centers, too.\n\nPraveen: Totally.\n\nDux: How about each one of these other bulletins, round the connectors and PowerShell abilities?\n\nPraveen: We\u2019ve been doing lots of deal with helping you to, being an IT admin, seize control of steps you can take, manage in a scale.\n\nIndividuals individuals acquainted with what that\u2019s, you can handle using partial scripts, quantity of teams you are able to, which are spinning in the business, quantity of channels, quantity of messages being sent, and permissioning, and all sorts of that stuff.\n\nThat\u2019s being released. In education, we\u2019re doing lots of great work, so integrating with notebook experience, for instance. Assignment notifications is which makes it the hub for the classroom work. Anything you need to have completed in greater education, or K through 12, lots of bulletins there.\n\nWe have launched a brand new application experience. I had been speaking about 150 partner integrations we have, from Hootsuite, Trello, and all sorts of these awesome, popular apps. We\u2019re creating a new experience, where one can just ask these apps really rapidly, take it to make use of inside your day-to-day project management software, and day-to-day collaboration.\n\nDux: Awesome. For individuals that haven\u2019t attempted Teams, or they\u2019re searching to Teams, just how can they best get began? Exactly what do you recommend? Where whenever they go, and just how whenever they start?\n\nPraveen: If you are a workplace 365 user, everyone has Teams. You\u2019d get access to Teams. In case your IT organization has allowed Microsoft Teams for the tenant, you could sign in to Teams at\n\nThis is where you\u2019re going to get began. I\u2019ve found, in many organizations really, beginning there, just dealing with, getting in their\u2026 We team together, so, locating a team champion, really, and beginning to make use of Teams for chat activities. Doing backwards and forwards, and file discussing for instance, in Teams. That\u2019s an excellent place to begin, after which it builds organically after that, where you\u2019re getting in most other applications that you\u2019re employed in your peripheral applications that you\u2019ll require.\n\nDux: Awesome. Praveen, of course, it\u2019s great to talk along with you.\n\nPraveen: Best to talk to you, too, Dux.\n\nDux: Make certain everyone take a look at, and look for all of the sessions around teams at Microsoft Tech Summit.

        "text":"One VC Wrote An OS for Her Life\n\nMaria Salamanca shares how she uses Airtable, Notion, and Bear to create a complete system to run her life\n\nImage result for maria salamanca\n\nMaria Salamanca wrote her own operating system.\u00a0\n\nBut it\u2019s not just composed of bits and bytes. It\u2019s a complete system that she\u2019s built to run her life: everything from making sure she\u2019s spending enough quality time with her friends, to making conscious choices about the work projects she spends time on, to doing deep dives into topics that interest her.\n\nShe calls it MariaOS, and it\u2019s built with Airtable, Notion, Bear, and a huge dose of her own intelligence and self-discipline.\n\nShe\u2019s a VC at Unshackled Ventures where she invests in immigrant-founded startups \u2014\u00a0backing over 40 pre-seed companies spanning a variety of verticals.\u00a0\n\nIn the past, she\u2019s worked on political causes including founding Swing Left \u2014\u00a0a progressive political organization that makes it easier for citizens to volunteer for political campaigns in their local districts.\u00a0\n\nIn this interview we cover:\n\n  \u2022 How she keeps a Values Manifesto to help guide her decisions\n\n  \u2022 How she uses Bear to record quick thoughts and pieces of inspiration, and then do deep dives on topics that come up often\n\n  \u2022 How she automatically prioritizes her todos in Airtable\n\n  \u2022 How she uses Airtable as a personal CRM to keep track of all of the people in her life\n\nLet\u2019s get to the interview!\n\nMaria introduces herself\n\nI\u2019m an immigrant. I was born in Colombia, and I came to the US when I had just turned seven. I grew up in Orlando, Florida, which is a large, super suburban place. It was kind of a weird place to grow up.\n\nI went to college at Berkeley, and I was actually going to be a pre-law. My major was political science and public policy. But I quickly realized that I didn't like the arbitrary systematic barriers that came with working in politics and how slow and inefficient it was. My personality is the opposite \u2014\u00a0I consider myself to be efficient, a sort of optimizer. So working in systems that don't operate that way is incredibly frustrating for me.\u00a0\n\nWorking in VC is a great format for this style. I work in a small team, it allows me to have control over how I optimize my workflow, how I gather information, and how I organize things.\n\nShe gives an overview of MariaOS\n\nI run my life with MariaOS, and it\u2019s made of a few different software tools that I use together.\n\nIn my Notion I keep a table of contents for all of my tools. It really helps me keep myself on track with how I work and organize the system.\n\nSo I list out each component of the system like my To-Do List, or my Research and Curiosity List, or my Personal CRM and then I map out which tools I use to facilitate each component.\n\nI try to use the minimum amount of tools possible, and I try to make sure that each tool has a specific purpose or reason for being the tool of choice.\n\nShe keeps a Values Manifesto to help guide her decisions\n\nOne main thing I use Notion for is to keep track of my Values Manifesto.\u00a0\n\nThe Values Manifesto helps me be conscious about what I want different aspects of my life to be like.\n\nWhat I do is I break my life out into different categories, and then come up with a list of words that I want to associate with each category.\n\nDoing this helps to create a long-term vision for what I want out of each of these categories in my life. So that means I can go back and check these things later and make sure where I am in my life aligns with these words. Or re-consider if the concept has evolved, which it does.\n\nSo for example, one category is Physical Space and Health. This is a list of words that I want to associate with my physical space and my health \u2014 words like Balance, Calm, Optimism, Energy, Vitality.\n\nSo if I\u2019m going to go at some point to purchase a home, or I\u2019m thinking about the design of my office I can go back to this list and reflect on it to help me make sure I\u2019m aligned with my values in those moments.\n\nDoing this for the first time was really important to me because I\u2019ve never really had control over my physical space before. It was always determined for me. So this exercise helped me realize this, and helped me be deliberate about what I want out of my physical spaces in the future, so that I can work to create that for myself.\u00a0\n\nI tend to reflect on this a few times a year when I have downtime. Recently after a very busy year our office took about a week and a half off \u2014\u00a0we just shut down the office. We had done like eight deals in two months and we were super tired. And I used that time to come back to this. I also tend to do this around the holidays \u2014 any time I\u2019m around family it really grounds me, and gives me a chance to get more in touch with my long-term goals.\u00a0\n\nI think these categories and these words will change for different people \u2014\u00a0I\u2019m not saying I have the right ones, but as an exercise it\u2019s useful.\n\nShe jots down quick thoughts in her Thought Central in Bear\n\nI keep all of my short form writing in what I call my Thought Central in Bear. My Thought Central contains anything that\u2019s incomplete, or super short. I\u2019ll just throw any thought in there and then go back to it later to process it.\n\nSo for example, last night I was reading something and it mentioned KPIs or key performance indicators. And I had this thought that was like, \u201cHow many of my founders could actually define what a KPI is?\u201d So I put it in there.\n\nAnd so my Thought Central becomes this running long list of everything that\u2019s going through my head. Then, usually what I do is every two weekends, I go through all of the things in my Thought Central, and if anything remains interesting enough to dig further into or reflect on, I will do that and then move it to its own dedicated note.\n\nShe keeps a Research and Curiosity List\n\nI also use Bear to keep a running list of things that spark my interest. I call it my Research and Curiosity Central. It\u2019s just short snippets of anything that I want to learn a little bit more about. Often times, it\u2019s just copy and pasted sentences from books or the internet.\n\nSo for example, I read something that said that the technology industry is siphoning astrophysicists away from academia; they\u2019re turning space scholars into machine learning experts.\n\nThis was really interesting to me, because it made me think: where are other untapped sources of talent? If an astrophysicist can help a self-driving car company, who else might be out there that can be helpful?\n\nSo I wrote it down in my Research and Curiosity Central so I won\u2019t forget it.\u00a0\n\nAnd then every two weeks I\u2019ll go through this list and look for patterns. Any topics that I start to see come up several times are clearly areas that are interesting enough to think more deeply about. I\u2019ll move those to their own notes to do a deep dive on them.\n\nShe uses the same structure to keep track of her work and progress in therapy\n\nI do the same kind of thing for the emotional work I do. So I go to therapy, and I follow the same pattern.\n\nI have a note in Bear where I\u2019ll track thoughts and realizations from every therapy session that I do. It\u2019s just super raw, and quick.\u00a0\n\nThen about once a year, I\u2019ll look through them and figure out what the patterns are. I\u2019ll find the key turning points, what I\u2019ve made progress on, and what I haven\u2019t made much progress on.\u00a0\n\nFor me, it's super important for this not feel like it\u2019s a heavy process. I just want all of the thoughts out of my mind as quickly as possible. And that way I can put it on future me to go through the list a few weeks from now, and figure out what\u2019s important and what I want to hold on to.\n\nShe uses Airtable to automatically prioritize her todos\n\nI use Airtable to track my todos. It\u2019s all my everyday stuff.\n\nEvery todo has a status: whether it\u2019s to do, started, cancelled, or complete.\n\nAnd I have two ways to rank every todo: how much time it will take and how big of a priority it\u00a0 is.\n\nI\u2019ll mark how much time it takes on a scale from one to three. And then I\u2019ll mark its priority along the same scale.\u00a0\n\nThen I multiply the two numbers together, and sort by the smallest first. That way my todo list ranks itself: I don\u2019t choose what\u2019s next unless any two items are tied in terms of priority.\n\n[*Superorganizers Note: Want an Airtable template of Maria's todo list? Click here.*]\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice that I bucket my todos in different ways.\n\nFor example, I have a column called Personality and Values for each todo. And that helps me mark which one of my values each particular todo maps to.\u00a0\n\nI also have a column called Projects that maps which projects each todo relates to.\n\nAnd this helps me make sure that what I\u2019m doing every day maps back to the things that are important to me, and the projects that I need to get done.\n\nIt also helps me see which projects or values aren\u2019t getting enough attention. It\u2019s really easy to see, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not spending enough time on my health.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe keeps a bucket list\n\nOne of the most important things I\u2019ve done, I think, is I\u2019ve created a bucket list called my Top 100. And it\u2019s a list of the top things that I want to do in my life. This can be anything big or small, and I revisit often and delete things that turned out to be brief whims.\n\nAnd so I use this as a way to track my progress on completing each thing.\u00a0\n\nFor each item on the list, I\u2019ll keep a status to tell me if it\u2019s done or not.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll also keep track of its category: is it something that I can do immediately? Do I need time to do it? Do I need skills to do it?\u00a0\n\nSo that helps me figure out what are the things that are accessible to me immediately, and what can be done in the future.\u00a0\n\nThen for each one I\u2019ll mark which skills I need to build in order to do it. And that helps me plan out what I\u2019m going to need to learn.\u00a0\n\nShe keeps a list of all of her books and articles in Airtable as well\n\nI keep track of everything I read or want to read in my Content tab in Airtable.\n\nBasically I have a zap that sends an...

I wanted your opinion on a few things.\nPrinter: *whir*\n\nSL: Excellent, I\u2019m glad to hear your enthusiasm. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about how the web hosting industry seems to be weathering the storm of the global economic downturn quite well. It seems regardless of the bank bailouts, failed mortgages, and credit crises, there is still a high demand for social networking applications, online shopping and exchange of information via the many forums available. Furthermore, with the reliability of our redundant links, businesses are finding it more affordable to outsource their IT assets, and host with us.\n\nSL: I Get it. By hosting here, you can also begin the transition to a paperless business. Something to the effect of a tech taking an X-Ray, uploading it to an SL server through the private uplink, and instantly having it available to a doctor thousands of miles away. And that\u2019s just one possibility out of the endless uses for a server here. We have a ton of space available, and by design, we use approximately a square foot per server in our Datacenter\u2026 How\u2019s that for space efficiency?\n\nSL: Yea, it gets pretty toasty in there, but luckily we have environmental controls in place to mitigate the heat put out by the thousands of servers in the pods. We also have monitoring in place to notify us of any possible situations. As uptime is vital in the web hosting industry, we have a number of features available both internally and externally. We have 24\/7\/365 monitoring, automatic reboots, and a highly intuitive customer portal. Not to mention the best technicians in the industry\nPrinter: *beep*\n\nSL: Now that\u2019s just rude. We have staff from every facet of IT working in our NOC every day of the year. With the highly skilled staff holding years upon years of experience, there are few issues that can\u2019t be solved quickly and efficiently.\nPrinter: PAPER_JAM\n\nSL: Doubtful. We continue to innovate in efficiency and features. Now you\u2019re acting just like the elevator.\n\nSL: Ugh, you\u2019re just as bad as the Elevator. What does that mean, anyway?\n\nSubscribe to printer",

        "text":"Mike Giuttari, MG Commercial\n\nAn Interview With ClientLook User, Mike Giuttari\n\n  \u2022 Mr. Giuttari, SIOR is the President and Founder of MG Commercial Real Estate Services. Prior to forming MG Commercial in 1998, he was President and Principal Broker of another regional commercial real estate firm he founded 10 years prior.\n\n    Mike has been in the commercial real estate business for over 30 years and is a valued ClientLook user. Learn how his company utilizes our\u00a0our\u00a0commercial real estate CRM software\u00a0in their busy brokerage office:\n\n  \u2022 Mike Giuttari, MG Commercial Real Estate\n\n    Mike Giuttari, MG Commercial Real Estate\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about your business? What do you specialize in?\n\nMike: We are a full-service commercial real estate brokerage company located in Providence, Rhode Island. Our company does it all; retail, office, industrial, and land deals representing sellers, buyers, landlords, and tenants. I am the President and Owner of the company, and I also\u00a0complete\u200b deals with some of my long-time clients. Our office specializes in Landlord representation and about two-thirds of our deals are leases and one-third of our deals are sales. However, the dollar amount of\u00a0the\u200b\u00a0transactions\u00a0works out to approximately a\u00a050\/50 split.\u200b\n\nHow has your experience been with ClientLook?\n\nMike: It\u2019s been great! I\u2019ve known Michael Griffin and Chuck Cutler for a long time, actually since the days of ARES, \u200bso I knew that the software would be top-notch. ClientLook does exactly what we need it to do and it works perfectly. Whenever\u00a0we\u200b\u00a0have a question, the answer is right there \u2013 in the product already. Greg Hoard is also very helpful and quickly answers any questions that\u00a0we\u200b\u00a0may have, and always adds some training to go with the answer\u200b.\u00a0We have a shared database for the entire company; everyone in the office utilizes ClientLook in a completely open way so we can all share\u00a0the same \u200binformation with each other. It\u2019s been a wonderful experience for our entire team.\n\nWhat CRM solution were you using previously?\n\nMike: Prior to ClientLook, we were using Act!, and in the beginning we were using ARES for Act! \u200bHowever,\u00a0Act!\u200b\u00a0was just a database of names and we wanted a CRM that was specific for our commercial real estate business. It was important for us to have contacts, deals, properties, and activities all in one place, and linked, so reporting to landlords was a simple process\u200b. When you open ClientLook,\u200b\u00a0it\u2019s intuitive and it syncs perfectly to what we do on a day to day basis.\n\nHow easy was it to get your data converted into ClientLook?\n\nMike: The process was seamless. We worked with Chuck,\u200b\u00a0and the support team handled the data conversion for us. We had over 35,000 contacts that needed to be imported into ClientLook and we were extremely happy with the smooth process. Chuck and his team even created a work-around (that actually worked) for some less than standard\u00a0information \u200bwe had in Act! that needed to be converted\u200b.\u200b\n\nWhy did you choose ClientLook?\n\nMike: After using an Act! based product for the past\u00a020\u200b\u00a0years or so, we really needed to upgrade to a current technology. We started researching other CRM\u2019s and narrowed it down to three choices \u2013 Apto, RealNex, and ClientLook. Once we tested the products it was clear that ClientLook was the best, and a product that my team would actually use\u200b. It was the easiest to use, and the most intuitive. Out of the\u00a0\u201c\u200bbox\u201d we were up and running! I like that we can track all of our listings, property showing, contacts, and deals all in one place, and they all link to each other, including the marketing done for each property\u200b. If I want to see when a call was made, or when an e-mail blast was sent and where it went, or when the property signs went up, or any other detail about any of our listings, it is all in one place.\u200b\n\nWhat features do you like the most about ClientLook?\n\nMike: The ease of use is a top feature, because it got the entire company using the product immediately\u200b! Everyone in the company was able to jump right in. The Virtual Assistant is also an incredible feature. I frequently take a picture of a business card after a meeting, send it to the VA, and the contact information is entered into ClientLook before I even get back to my office. It\u2019s incredible and saves so much time. I no longer have a stack of business cards sitting on my desk that need to be inputted\u00a0(and never get done) \u200bbecause the Virtual Assistant handled all of them.\u00a0I also use the new iPhone app multiple times per day. It\u2019s so convenient to have my entire database (contacts, notes, companies, tasks and more)\u200b\u00a0on my phone that I can instantly access and update,\u200b\u00a0anytime, anywhere.\n\nHow would you describe your overall experience with the ClientLook team?\n\nMike: Fantastic! I love them! When I learned that Michael was the founder of ClientLook, I knew that it was going to be a great product. The team responds quickly and is always happy to answer any questions we have, and the answer is always \u201cYou just do this or that\u201d, not \u201cIt can\u2019t do that\u201d.\u200b",
