This\u00a0adorable DIY\u00a0gnome ornament was inspired by my great auntie Jean \u2014 my crafting hero\u00a0\u2014 who always made the most charming\u00a0ornaments out of simple materials like walnuts and other natural elements.\u00a0I think Jean would definitely approve of\u00a0this little guy.\n\nYou will need:\n\nA walnut\nBlack fine-tip Sharpie\nCrafting felt, any color\nCrafting fur, white\nA tiny wood bead or button\nHot-glue gun\nEmbroidery thread\n\n\nStep 1:\u00a0Cut a roughly 2\u201d x 5\u201d rectangle from the\u00a0crafting fur to make the gnome\u2019s beard; the precise size you need may\u00a0vary with\u00a0the size of your walnut.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Fold the fur in half lengthwise and cut a small semicircle from the top of the folded edge near the fold; this creates the\u00a0shape for the top of the beard.\n\n\nStep 3: Apply glue to the back\u00a0side\u00a0of the fur near\u00a0the cut edge. Turn the fur\u00a0over and center it on\u00a0the walnut, pressing to attach. With a\u00a0Sharpie, draw eyes on the walnut above the beard. I drew two simple dots, but\u00a0you can also draw two half-moons for a sleepy look.\n\n\nStep 4: To make the gnome\u2019s\u00a0hat, cut a small felt triangle that\u2019s approximately 4.5\u00a0inches wide at the base and 3 inches tall on\u00a0the sides. Next,\u00a0apply a line of hot glue to one of the 3-inch\u00a0edges of the hat and attach it to the opposite 3-inch edge, creating a cone shape. Trim any excess from the base of the hat if needed.\n\nStep 5: Apply hot glue to the bottom inside edge of the hat, then affix the hat to the walnut\u00a0just above the\u00a0eyes. (Make sure to\u00a0position the hat\u2019s\u00a0seam on the back side.)\n\nStep 6:\u00a0Dot hot glue onto the wood bead and position it above the\u00a0fur beard\u00a0to create\u00a0the gnome\u2019s nose.\n\nStep 7: Once all the glue has dried, cut a 6-inch piece of embroidery thread\u00a0and use a needle to loop it through the top of the gnome\u2019s hat. Tie the ends of the thread in a knot and you\u2019ve finished your\u00a0ornament.\n\n\nYour gnome is now ready to spread holiday cheer, so hang him on the\u00a0tree and display with pride.\n\nExplore\u00a0DIY\u00a0Holiday Decor\n\n\nSign in to add your own",

        "text":"How to Get Your Whole House Clean in Two Hours or Less\n\nMeghan Young KroghLadyguides19 Comments\n\n\nI know I\u2019m not the only one who does this: life gets busy and the house gets correspondingly dirtier and dirtier. You don\u2019t want to give up your entire day off to cleaning it, so it gets worse. Pretty soon you\u2019re out of clean dishes, clean underwear, and room in the garbage can. Here\u2019s my surefire multitasking method of getting the whole house back into functional shape again in only two hours, so you can spend the rest of your day off watching The Cosby Show\u00a0on Netflix Instant.\n\n  1. Turn on music. Not mopey hipster music. Not emotionally charged sad bastard music. Music with good pace. For me, the only things that work are showtunes and exercise-paced pop, like Ke$ha. The goal here is to keep a driving beat behind your effort; it will remind you to keep your pace up. Preferably choose a Pandora station or a couple of albums that fit the bill.\n  2. Gather all dirty laundry from all rooms (including dirty kitchen towels, bath towels, bedding, etc.) in your laundry basket and start your laundry cycle. (Community washing machines: start all of your loads. One machine in home: do one load at a time. Laundry off-site: get it piled up and set it by the door. It won\u2019t fit into your two hour time limit, since all cleaning needs to be done on site, but it will help get it out of the way.) Set a timer for the duration of the wash cycle and get on to the next task. Make sure that bedding is in this first round of laundry.\u00a0\n  3. Gather all dirty dishes and wash them immediately. (If you have a dishwasher\u2013rinse, load, and start the machine. If you hand-wash\u2013that\u2019s okay, just get scrubbing!)\n  4. Once your dishes are washed, either leave them to dry or let the machine do its thing. Wipe down all counter tops and the top of the stove with a wet rag, sponge, or Clorox wipes (my favorite). Put away any food sitting out, toss any obviously spoiled food you see in the \u2018fridge.\n  5. By now your laundry timer should have gone off (you\u2019re probably about 1\/2 an hour into your cleaning and your laundry is clean and your kitchen is almost done). Switch clothes into the dryer, start the second washer load if you have more to go, set your timer for the longer cycle (my dryer takes longer than the washer).\n  6. Spray down all hard surfaces in your bathroom with surface cleaner. That\u2019s bathtub, shower stall, sink, toilet. Put toilet cleaner in the bowl, scrub down with a toilet brush, and wipe everything else off. Flush the toilet, rinse the shower\/tub, and empty the bathroom trash into your larger kitchen can. Re-line the bathroom trash can.\n  7. Shelve all books, stack all mail, and wipe down any remaining tables (coffee table, dining room, bedside, etc.) with a Clorox wipe or wet paper towel.\n  8. If there are remaining loads of laundry to do, your timer should be going off right about now. Switch them over. This is about 1-1.25 hours into the two hours. By now your bedding should be dry.\n  9. Sweep all hard floor surfaces, then vacuum all carpets.\n  10. Make your bed.\n  11. If you have pets, clean the gerbil cage, empty the litter box, and wash the food bowls now.\n  12. Do one final trash sweep through unusual places. My prime suspects are chocolate wrappers in the bedroom and old envelopes from mail in the living room. Re-line all of your garbage cans and take out the garbage and recycling.\n  13. Put any remaining variables away at this point. This can include power cords, knick knacks, magazines lying around, exercise equipment, stuffed animals, whatever. If you have children, this last burst of time is a great opportunity to get them putting away their toys and various clutter.\n  14. Gather your last load of dry laundry and fold all of your laundry and put it away. You should be right at about the 2 hour mark, and at this point your house should be functionally clean. Maybe not sparkling, but it should no longer be making your skin crawl.

Profile photo of bricorama\n\n    This is great! If I\u2019m cleaning bathroom\/kitchen, I usually get a Swiffer wet wipe and hit the bathroom first (I live with 3 other girls, so it\u2019s hair galore. I usually clean the major\u00c2\u00a0clumps\u00c2\u00a0of hair off the pad and throw it away) and then I hit up the kitchen. If there\u2019s a lot of lose debris I get out the broom. Or I just swiffer it into the corner and pretend its not there.\n\n    Also I listen to a lot of The Specials when I clean.\n\n  2. Profile photo of Jane Dizzle\n    Jane Dizzle\n\n    Awesome possom!\n\n    I like to start with laundry too \u2014 bed linens first, like you said; a nice added benefit of having the bed made right away is that you can use it as a surface for folding your other clean laundry or you can use it as a stacking and organizing surface that won\u2019t interfere with sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping. Plus, making the bed is really satisfying, you get a visible result so you feel like you accomplished something right away.\n\n    I feel naughty for talking about housework on a women\u2019s blog, so to counteract the excitement I just expressed over doing laundry, I\u2019m going to sing \u201cI Am Woman\u201d to myself for the next twenty minutes :)\n\n    Thanks for the helpful checklist \u2014 I\u2019m going to try it this weekend.\n\n  3. Profile photo of mxandb\n\n    I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it before: START LAUNDRY WITH THE BEDDING!\n    My mind is already blown by #2.\n\n    Also, fun step:\u00c2\u00a0 put the toilet bowl cleaner in the toilet the night before \u2013 just spray it all up in there before going to bed.\u00c2\u00a0 When you wake in the morning, it will have \u201csoaked\u201d and scrubbing is either not necessary or super easy.\u00c2\u00a0 And you\u2019ll have a \u2018fresh\u2019 bowl before 7am (assuming one gets up before 7am)\u00c2\u00a0 I use Clorox and don\u2019t have to actually scrub, it just dissolves away. :D\n\n    (system note: I think with my office\u2019s last round of updates, PM is coming in more easily \u2013 yah!)\n\n    1. Profile photo of Meghan Young Krogh\n      Meghan Young Krogh\n\n      Yes, basically anything you can do in advance to decrease your actual cleaning time is ++++. For those with small children or pets, it might not be super feasible to leave cleaning chemicals on surfaces overnight, but it\u2019s a great idea otherwise. :)\n\n      And: I know for a fact that the Editors Who Reign Over All have been tinkering with a crap ton of features that affect the site\u2019s loading time, just to make it faster. Sounds like the combination of your office upgrade and our tinkering has created a superfast powerful Persephone engine! Pomegranates optional.\n\n  4. Profile photo of Dormouse\n\n    One of my past roommates inspired me with the \u201cpower hour\u201d (or power half hour, if you\u2019re short on time). The basic idea is to clean\/organize\/pick up as quickly as you can, with no breaks, and to power through an hour or half hour of work. It is amazing what you can accomplish in that amount of time if you just stick to it.\n\n    But, I\u2019m a big fan of multitasking and getting some things started\u2013like laundry or dishes\u2013first so that those tasks will be done by the time I finish other ones. :)\n\n    1. Profile photo of Meghan Young Krogh\n      Meghan Young Krogh\n\n      When I do daily cleaning, I do it by room so it doesn\u2019t get overwhelming, but if the whole house is filthy, I find doing it by task helps me to focus, and helps no one room to be too overwhelming.\n\n      1. Profile photo of CherriSpryte\n\n        Sometimes I find doing things by task counterproductive, as I frequently get all \u201chey, the kitchen is sparkling! i have accomplished something! i can always close my bedroom door when i have guests!\u201d and then i quit halfway through.\n\n        Also, related, I am going to try this tomorrow, after work, except I\u2019m giving myself 4 hours. We shall see how this goes!\n\n        1. Profile photo of Michelle Miller\n          Michelle Miller\n\n          Oh my goodness, I am the same way. I\u2019m always looking to reward myself and stop the good work I\u2019m doing.\n\n          That\u2019s why this method seems appealing to me. Might help to keep the ball rolling on the chores.\n\nLeave a Reply",

It is your responsibility to have control over your dog and to correct bad behavior. Your pet should never be left unattended in any area that is dangerous or an area that you do not want destroyed. Obedience training ca be an important factor in this process. Knowing a simple command, such as to \"drop it\" or \"leave it\", could save your pet\u2019s life. Corrections should begin at the moment when your dog or puppy starts the inappropriate chewing. Remember, your puppy or dog is like a small child, they have no way to know that the item they just destroyed was your expensive couch or chair, unless you instruct them to avoid those items when they have a need to chew. He might misbehave due to curiosity or boredom, not because he knows what he\u2019s doing is unacceptable. Remember, with chewing as with any unacceptable canine behavior, prevention is easier than treatment.\n\nTo correct common behavior problems like chewing, follow these basic steps:\n\nChewing is a normal, natural canine behavior. Puppies usually begin chewing due to teething, boredom or stress. Chewing on anything but designated chew toys should be discouraged immediately, or it can develop into a habit that will carry over into their adult lives. You must catch the dog in the act to prevent this problem. If you catch your puppy or dog chewing on something that is off limits, verbally say \u201cNo!\u201d and redirect his attention to one of his toys. When he chews on his toy, praise him verbally and pet him. If you are unable to supervise your pet, put him in a crate, on a tie-down or in an area where he cannot get into mischief. Never give your puppy or dog any objects you don\u2019t want them to chew on. For example, don\u2019t give your dog a shoe, sock or household item as a toy because the dog will think of all of these items as toys. The dog will not be able to differentiate between your discarded items and the good stuff.\n\nUnderstand Chewing\n\nChewing is a normal, natural canine behavior. Dogs learn through their mouths and use their mouths as tools to receive a lot of information. Chewing on hard objects provides an appropriate outlet for your dog's desire to chew. It is an enjoyable pastime for many dogs. Dogs chew because they are bored, they have lots of energy or they're curious. One benefit to chewing is that it is good for keeping tartar from building up on the teeth, which helps prevent bad breath.\n\nPuppies use their mouths to explore their new worlds. As with babies, teething is painful to puppies. Chewing helps relieve the pain and helps them develop strong jaws. That doesn't mean, however, that you should let your new puppy chew his or her way through the house. Chewing can be a very expensive problem, especially when the inappropriate chewing in on your rug, furniture, shoes or other household items. As with any unacceptable canine behavior, prevention is easier than treatment.\n\nDogs go through two chewing phases. The first is between 4-6 months when the puppies begin to loose their puppy teeth. Puppies like to chew on soft items, like carpet, rugs, rags or soft toys, squeaky toys and rope toys. Then they may stop for a while until the second phase, which occurs between 10-12 months when the adult teeth settle into the growing skull of the dog. During this phase, dogs like to chew on more dense objects, like wood, furniture, plastic, rawhide, hard rubber toys, and Nylabones.\n\nWhy Chewing Occurs\n\nTeething - Between the ages of five weeks and six months, puppies will teethe. They will chew on anything they can find to relieve their discomfort. Make sure you have a supply of chewable toys on hand. To make these toys even more appealing to your puppy, place it in the freezer for a few hours. The cold toy will be very soothing to your puppy's sore mouth.\n\nImproper confinement - Dogs are very social animals and do not do well emotionally when isolated from the \"pack\" or family. Confine your dog behind a see-through puppy gate or in a crate so the dog can see what is going on in surrounding areas. Never restrain a dog behind a closed door in a small room. An improperly confined dog may attempt to chew his way out of seclusion.\n\nImproper chew toys - Never give your puppy or dog any objects you don't want them to chew on. For example, don't give your dog a shoe, sock or household item as a toy because the dog will think of all of these items as toys. The dog will not be able to differentiate between your discarded items and the good stuff.\n\nBoredom or Stress - Dogs may chew when they are bored, stressed or anxious. If chewing helps relieve the boredom or stress, it will most likely be repeated again and again because it is self-reinforcing. Now you have a bad habit that is hard to break.\n\nProblem Solving Techniques\n\nAs when training any behavior, be persistent and consistent to let your dog know what is acceptable and what is not. With maturity and proper reinforcement training from you, soon your dog will have freedom around your home without you having to worry about what the dog is getting into.\n\nChew Toys - What's appropriate for your dog\n\nWhen dogs feel confined, bored, isolated or stressed, they often relieve that stress by redirecting it into destructive behaviors. Toys help dogs reduce that stress and can help reduce the likelihood of behaviors such as digging and chewing. If toys are not provided, some dogs will resort to chewing what is available, which might include shoes, books, rugs and furniture.\n\nSelecting the right toy for your dog\nHelp your dog use up some of his energy by giving him toys that are appropriate for the size and age he is now. Toys that might have been the right size when he was a puppy might be too small now and should be discarded. Balls and other toys that are too small can be swallowed or become lodged in the dog's throat or mouth. Discard toys that break into pieces or that have pieces torn off.\n\nProvide a variety of toys. Make four or five toys available at a time and rotate different toys on a weekly basis. This keeps your dog interested in his toys. However, if he is strongly attached to a particular toy, don't take it away.\n\nWhat are your dog's chewing habits\n\nAggressive chewers will tear toys apart, and if the toy comes apart, he could swallow the pieces or choke on them. Give aggressive chewers durable, hard rubber or nylon toys. Semi-aggressive chews don't usually tear toys apart, but will chew enough to cause wear on a toy. Provide semi-aggressive chews with canvas, plush, fleece, or rope toys. These toys are softer, but will not come apart easily. Non-aggressive or light chewers that are less destructive can have vinyl or latex toys.\n\nWhen giving your dog a new toy, observe how he plays with the toy. If he is destroying it, take it away. Instead, purchase a toy that is harder and more durable. Toys can be made out of a variety of materials, some more durable than others. Once you understand your dog's chewing habits, you can decide what type of toys are best for your dog.\n\nVinyl and Latex Toys\nThese toys are good for non-aggressive or light chewers. They come in many shapes and colors. Many of these toys have a squeaker, which adds interest to the toy.\n\nRubber and Nylon Toys\nThese are good for more aggressive chewers. They are durable and some come with a hole in them, which adds interest for the dog when a treat is inserted in the hole.\n\nRope Toys\nToys made with either a nylon or cotton rope material are a good choice for semi-aggressive chewers. These are good for dogs that like to play tug-of-war. They also have the added benefit of providing a flossing action that helps clean the teeth.\n\nPlush, Fleece or Canvas Toys\nThese soft toys are good for dogs that like to carry a toy around with them. Because of the stuffing inside the toy, they should not be given to aggressive chewers. They often contain a squeaker. If there are any tears in the toy, sew the tear or discard the toy and replace it with a new one. Canvas toys are washable and quite durable even for semi-aggressive chewers.",

        "text":"How To Make Flower Beds\n\nFlower beds can give an organized beautiful look to your garden, but while the result is amazing and soothing, making the flower bed yourself isn\u2019t as hard or complicated as you would think \u2013 you just need to do a bit of planning before you start, as in any gardening project.\n\nAfter you decide just how much time you plan on investing in gardening (not only the initial landscaping, but caring for the plants as well) you will know how many flower beds you should make and the shape and measurements it should have.\n\nSelect an area with good light conditions and well-drained soil then draw a plan, noting down the measurements and incorporating the flower beds into the landscape.\n\nIf you don\u2019t plan to use a border, you can make a natural one out of buses or shrubs, or even small flowering plants. Start with smaller ones to the taller inwards. When you choose the plants, look into their requirements so that you can plan accordingly \u2013 type of soil, amount of sunlight and pruning; if for instance, one or some of the plants you choose need frequent pruning, they should be place somewhere with easy access. Make sure you don\u2019t group too many light coloured plants together; they are most remarkable when in contrast, or you could make use of different foliage colours.\n\nA popular flower bed choice is varied roses, whether you choose to vary the type or the colours; you can add shrubs or small flowering plants. Or you could try a raised flower bed, with Viola and yellow and orange Sweet Williams.\n\nWhen done planning, mark the soon-to-be flower bed using nylon rope and digging the intended area, making it at least 10-15 inches deep. If you want a leveled flower bed, you should take adequate measures so that the soil doesn\u2019t give way when you water the plants. Mix the soil with compost and pesticide to prevent any unwanted guests.\n\ndifferent foliage, flower beds, flowering plants, gardening project, initial landscaping, leveled flower bed, light conditions, varied roses",

        "text":"Usually the pocket square needs very little attending to. But just like everything else, your Creative Corgis pocket square might need some tender love and care from time to time.\n\nFor a quick and effective refreshing, steam it and let it cool on a flat surface. You can also iron it with the lowest temperature on the iron and a thin towel between for extra security. Try to avoid ironing on the edges. Since they have hand-rolled hems and stitched by hand they might crease and fold when ironed directly on top with a lot of pressure. Again, once ironed, leave it to cool down for a few minutes. All fabrics are more prone to creases when warm and humid.\n\nTo get a stain on a favourite piece of clothing is always a bummer, but the key to successful removal is time! Tend to your stain as soon as possible since the longer it sits, the harder it will be to remove.\n\nWhen looking dapper, one often adds a little perfume. A good tip is to put on your perfume before putting on your clothes and placing your square since the scent might stain on sensitive fabrics such as silk.\u00a0\n\nWine stains are sometimes inevitable, but not hopeless to remove! First action is to dab a little carbonated water on the stain. Make sure not to be too rough, so hydrate on a towel and gently pat your stained square with it.\n\nAfter a long week at the office or a late night of dancing, the best spa for both you and your pocket square is airing outdoors for a while.\n\nTry to avoid handling your square with greasy fingers. If due to a few cocktails and a late night greasy snack, this is unmanageable and you end up with stains, do not fret! Baby wipes or makeup remover wipes can get you a long way in dissolving the grease.\n\nGot chewing gum on your pocket square? Simply put your pocket square in the freezer and gently break off the chewing gum once it has stiffened. But please, if this happens to you, send us an e-mail and tell us your back story. It surely most be tremendous!\n\nIf you end up with stains you have no idea where they came from, put on a brave face and go to your trusted dry cleaner. It does not hurt if you flip a coin in a fountain on your way there. And if not even they can remove it, embrace it and consider it a part of life and a sign of good times. Fun and exciting days are sometimes a bit messy.\n\nFollow us for news!",
