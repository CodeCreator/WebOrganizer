        "text":"What Kind of Lighting Should You Install\n\n\nWhen improving your home, there are always a thousand choices to make. You\u2019re constantly looking at different kinds of paints, appliances, cabinets, flooring, and other important features. Well, you can\u2019t forget about the lighting. Whether you\u2019re building a new house and you need to pick out some lighting or you\u2019ve had the same lighting for years and you figure that it\u2019s time for an upgrade, you need to know about your options when it comes to lighting and how to install your new lighting.\n\nWhat Is LED Lighting?\n\nLED stands for light-emitting diode. But what does that mean, exactly? LEDs were first introduced a few decades ago and were primarily designed for the sole use of low-power red lights. These lights were often used for stoplights because they were not blindingly bright and they were energy efficient. LEDs have come a long way since the 1960s and they\u2019re now considered one of the most efficient light sources on the market today.\n\nIncandescent lighting is not so efficient. You see, incandescent lighting creates a lot of heat. Heat wastes power and it does not create any light at all. LEDs don\u2019t really get hot because the diodes are so small so installing LEDs is more practical for power consumption.\n\nLED lighting is also becoming more affordable as manufacturers begin to streamline their design processes. Because it\u2019s affordable and much more efficient, you should definitely consider installing LED lighting in your home.\n\nSmart Lighting\n\nIn today\u2019s age of home automation, people with budgets can implement an easier way to control things such as appliances, heating systems, and lighting. If you\u2019re interested in making your lighting controls easier, you should consider installing smart lighting. Linked to a tablet or mobile phone, smart lighting controls allow you to set your lights to turn on automatically as the sun goes down and control the intensity of your lighting during the daytime.\n\nHow to Install Lighting\n\nWorking with bulbs and sockets isn\u2019t as easy as you think. There are a lot of risks associated with working with lighting. For example, by mishandling the sockets or by leaving the power on while installing your lighting, you could accidentally electrocute yourself. There are also a lot of fragile components to handle and it\u2019s very easy to accidentally drop something and break it.\n\nYou should consider hiring some local electrical contractors in Scotland to help you design your lighting and install it for you. Contractors are experts when it comes to designing lights and are usually certified to handle fragile components.\n\nTo get started, reach out to your local contractor and ask them to visit your home. You can discuss your ideas with them and ask them about their energy efficient lighting options or whether they can install a smart lighting system if you have the budget.\n\nYou might be unsure about how much lighting you should install in your house. A contractor can help you design the lighting schematics so that every part of your home can have the appropriate amount of lighting.\n\n\nYou might also like More from author",

        "text":"Feeding a Puppy\n\nIf you want a healthy, happy puppy then you should learn about feeding a puppy properly. Puppies need food that is specially formulated with nutrients their growing bodies need. It is best to establish a feeding schedule with your puppy for a number of reasons. Above all else, it is important to remember that water is essential to growing puppies.\n\nHow you feed your puppy is not nearly as important as what you feed your puppy. Once a new puppy is weaned from his mother, you are responsible for giving your puppy food that will help him grow and stay healthy. It is recommended that you start off using the same brand your puppy was fed before you brought him home. If you choose to change brands, you should introduce the new brand slowly, over the course of 7-10 days. While there are three types of dog food available, dry kibble, semi-moist, and moist, most experts believe you should only feed your puppy dry kibble. More expensive foods generally contain higher-quality ingredients while cheaper foods contain poor-quality ingredients. Some brands also offer puppy chow that is formulated specifically for large-breed puppies.\n\nYour puppy will benefit most by feeding a puppy on a schedule. Puppies who are allowed to eat as much as they want by having food available all the time are less likely to maintain their optimal weight as adult dogs. Puppies should be fed three times a day, but as adults, they should be fed twice a day. It will be easier to housebreak your puppy by knowing exactly when he eats. To know how much you should feed your puppy, consult the chart on the back of the bag. Your puppy may eat more or less, so use the chart only as a guide.\n\n\u00a0Puppies need water and lots of it. Because water is so important to the health, growth, and development of a puppy, ensuring that your puppy has clean, fresh water is the most important part of feeding a puppy. Growing puppies need more water, pound for pound, than adult dogs because of their rapid growth and development.\n\nProperly feeding your new puppy is the best way to give him a healthy, happy start. You should feed your puppy a high-quality food that is specially designed for growing puppies. Establishing a feeding schedule and being consistent with that schedule will help with housebreaking. It will also help develop healthy eating habits as an adult dog. While food quality is important, the most crucial aspect of your puppy\u2019s health and development is ensuring your puppy receives adequate water.\n\nNiche Affiliate Marketing site design by Niche Chick",

Then after deciding the placement (one of the roll I had was thicker and hence heavier), I measured the beading strip and cut it into required length.\n\nTaking the centre of the roll as the centre of fixing on beading, holes were drilled into place.\n\nStep 2: Jazz it up...\n\nPicture of Jazz it up...\n\nAll rolls and the beading were given a base coat and left to dry. After sufficient drying period, I decided to put random patterns for each one of them.

Bells, trinkets were tied to the colorful thread one end of which was tied to the centre of toothpick. Take care as to show the loose end to come out of the roll. Then another thread was tied at the ends of toothpick coming out of the roll. I decided to keep random lengths of these threads in each of the rolls.\n\nNow when each of the roll was hanging on its own thread they were passed through the holes in beading at their pre decided arrangements forming an eye on top of the beading. Lastly, another thread for the final hanging was passed through each of the eyes of the rolls.\u00a0\n\nTip: Since, the end holes had become little big in my case, the upper thread was not lying flat. So, I decided to the tie the thread on the underside of the beading with another bells. This made it fix in place and more decorative.\nHope you enjoy doing it as much as you did.\nEricB122 months ago\n\nThose look like very authentic wind chimes, had I not seen you making them, I would have thought they where real Bamboo.

If you're worried about damaging the chrome pipe you can wrap some Teflon tape around the jaws of the pliers before you begin. With a rag remove any old Teflon tape or plumbers putty from the shower head threads. If the tape or putty becomes difficult to remove you can apply a bit of paint thinner to the threads beforehand.\n\nNow that you've removed the old shower head you will want to wrap the threads of the shower head pipe using Teflon tape to seal the connection between the pipe and shower head fixture. Wrap the Teflon tape clockwise once and then wrap it twice more, this time stretching it as you go. Wrapping the tape clockwise prevents your new shower head from leaking since wrapping it in the opposite direction can damage the tape and cause leaks.\n\nOnce you've applied the Teflon tape you can attach the new shower head by screwing it onto the threaded shower head pipe and tightening it by hand. You can tighten the head with a wrench about a half turn, but be careful in doing so as you don't want to damage your new shower head fixture by over-tightening it. You may also want to wrap the shower head in cloth before you attempt to tighten it with a wrench to prevent damage to your new fixture and shower head pipe.\n\nYou can then run water through your new shower head fixture to test for any leaks and remove any metal debris that may have gotten caught during the project.\n\nNow that you have installed the new shower head fixture and all of your hard work has paid off you can enjoy that new shower head without worry for a long time to come.\n\n\u00a9 High Speed Ventures 2011",

Keep the gate closed for short periods of time, and work your way up to longer times. If your pet seems upset or agitated, you may need to slow down.\n\nWhen corrected your dog verbally, make sure to use sharp, concise wording. Don\u2019t scream and yell and throw a fit. Be firm and get them to do your bidding. Also make sure that the volume of your voice commands their attention and lets them know that you mean business.\n\nDon\u2019t approach a strange dog too quickly. Hold our your hand and slowly move closer. This lets them warm up to the scent and they\u2019ll most likely trust you.

        "text":"\u2022 Craft Cotton Co\n\nPatchwork Stocking\n\nNothing looks better at Christmas than a row of stockings lined up along a fireplace, eagerly waiting to be filled with goodies, and it's even better when you get to discover what\u2019s been hidden in them on Christmas Day. I ran out of time for this make last year so I\u2019m making sure I get it made with plenty of time to spare, as my current stockings are starting to look a little bit threadbare!\n\nI was very lucky to receive some of The Craft Cotton Co. fabric for this make - the Stripes and Stars Fat Quarters. I love the colours of this Fat Quarter set; the greens and reds are just perfect for Christmas. I opted to do a striped patchwork effect for the stocking, with quilted detailing on the patchwork joins. I also opted to do a roll over top for the stocking as I like the effect it creates and I think it\u2019s nice to see a little of the lining, especially when the fabric looks so nice!\n\nYou will need:\n\n  \u2022 Pencil\n\n  \u2022 Paper\n\n  \u2022 Pins\n\n  \u2022 Ruler\n\n  \u2022 Needle and thread\n\n  \u2022 Sewing machine\n\n  \u2022 The Craft Cotton Company's Stars and Stripes fat quarter set, green plain\n\n-dyed polycotton and Heritage wadding\n\nFirst, make the stocking template:\n\nMake a stocking template the size you would like \u2013 the bigger you make it the more presents you can squeeze into it! Cut two templates of this stocking - keep one template whole to do the lining, wadding, and wadding lining fabric, and with the other template, cut it into strips, mine were 4cm wide. Make sure that you number these pieces; otherwise it can get a bit confusing putting them all back together!\n\nNow cut out the fabrics:\n\nCut out the lining fabric, wadding, and wadding lining fabric using the whole stocking template.\n\nNow using the same whole stocking template, cut out the main stocking fabric (make sure you leave a 5mm seam allowance when cutting out). The layout of fabrics I chose for the strips is shown below:\n\nNow to sew the strips together. Do this by placing two pieces right sides together and sewing down the seam. Once you have sewn them all together you should have one striped piece for the front and another for the back.\n\nAdding the quilting detail:\n\nLayer one piece of wadding, one piece of the lining fabric, and on piece of the striped outer stocking fabric pieces as shown:\n\nSew the detail you would like (as shown in the picture below). I chose to sew along the stripe joins for this and alternated between a straight stitch and a pre-set stitch on my machine that looked like a line of snowflakes.\n\nNow to make the hanger:\n\nPick one of the fabrics to make the hanger and cut a strip of 24cm x 6cm - I chose to use the green snowflake.\n\nNext, fold the strip in half length-ways with right sides facing and sew along the bottom and up the side leaving the top unsewn. Now just turn it the right way out and you have your hanging strip. Before sewing the front and back together, fold the strip in half to make the loop and pin to the back piece with the ends of the loop hanging 1cm over the edge of the back piece. I chose to place this 10cm down from the top edge to give enough space when the top edge is turned back over.\n\nNow sew the front and back together:\n\nPin the front and back pieces together with right sides together - the loop will be on the inside. Now sew the whole way around but leaving the top edge unsewn. Turn the right way round.\n\nFinally, making the lining:\n\nTake the front and back lining pieces and place them right sides together - sew around this leaving the top edge unsewn. Leave the two pieces right sides facing together.\n\nThis lining can now be inserted into the stocking.\n\nTo attach to the stocking, fold the top of the stocking inward by 1cm and fold 1cm of the stocking lining outwards and slip stitch the two edges together.\n\nRoll the top back over and you now have your stocking!\n\n\u00a9 By Lesley Foster at Hook, Stitch, Sew for The Craft Cotton Company 2015\n\n#freesewingtutorials #craftcottonco #patchwork #christmas\n\n  \u2022 Facebook - White Circle\n  \u2022 Twitter - White Circle\n  \u2022 Pinterest - White Circle\n  \u2022 Instagram - White Circle\n\n\u00a9 2016 created by Raeven Branch",

        "text":"How to prepare and stage your home for a quicker and efficient sale\n\nCategory Seller Tips\n\nMost home sellers want their home to sell fast and for top rand! There are proven ways in order to make your home stand out from the crowd, and to literally sell faster and for a better value. We have asked Antonie Goosen, the principal of Meridian Realty with offices in Stellenbosch and Betty\u2019s Bay, to share some of his thoughts in this regard. The following are some suggestions he has given. Disassociate yourself from your home It is natural to harbour emotions with regards to your own home. Home ownership is normally a very personal matter. The first step therefore is to make the mental adjustment that your home is only a product, competing with similar products, like in an appliance store. Try to remove yourself emotionally from your home, and start to see it in the light of it being a product that you are effectively putting on the market. De-personalise your home Hand in hand with the above mentioned, start to de-personalise your home. Pack up those personal photographs and family heirlooms. Buyers often struggle to see past personal artefacts, and you don't want them to be distracted. You want buyers to imagine their own photos on the walls, and it can often be difficult to do that if yours are there! You don't want to make any buyer ask, \"I wonder what kind of people live in this home?\" You want buyers to say, \"I can see myself living here.\" De-clutter!!! We tend to collect an amazing quantity of junk. Consider this: if you haven't used it in over a year, you probably don't need it. \u2022 If you don't need it, why not donate it or throw it away? \u2022 Clean off everything on kitchen counters and coffee tables; \u2022 Put essential items used daily in a small box that can be stored in a closet when not in use; Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will eventually need to do anyway. Rearrange Bedroom Closets, Kitchen Cabinets and Study areas Buyers love to snoop and will open closet and cabinet doors. Think of the message it sends if items fall out! Now imagine what a buyer believes about you if they see everything is organized. It says you probably take good care of the rest of the house as well. This means: \u2022 Neatly stack dishes. \u2022 Turn coffee cup handles facing the same way. \u2022 Hang shirts together, buttoned and facing the same direction. \u2022 Line up shoes. \u2022 Have your office and paper admin areas neatly organised; Rent a Storage Unit Almost every home shows better with less furniture. \u2022 Remove pieces of furniture that block or hamper paths and walkways and put them in storage. \u2022 Remove extra leaves from your dining room table to make the room appear larger. \u2022 Leave just enough furniture in each room to showcase the room's purpose and plenty of room to move around. You don't want buyers scratching their heads and saying, \"What is this room used for?\" Remove\/Replace Favourite Items If you want to take window coverings, built-in appliances or fixtures with you, remove them now. If the chandelier in the dining room once belonged to your great grandmother, take it down. If a buyer never sees it, they won't want it. Once you tell a buyer they can't have an item, they might covet it, and it could complicate your deal. Pack those items and replace them, if necessary. Make Minor Repairs \u2022 Replace cracked floor or counter tiles. \u2022 Patch holes in walls. \u2022 Fix leaky faucets. \u2022 Fix doors that don't close properly and kitchen drawers that jam. \u2022 Consider painting your walls neutral colours, especially if you have grown accustomed to purple or pink walls. (Don't give buyers any reason to remember your home as \"the house with the orange bathroom.\") \u2022 Replace burned-out light bulbs. \u2022 If you've considered replacing a worn bedspread, do so now! Make the House Sparkle! \u2022 Wash windows inside and out. \u2022 Rent a pressure washer and spray down sidewalks and exterior. \u2022 Clean out cobwebs. \u2022 Re-caulk tubs, showers and sinks. \u2022 Polish chrome faucets and mirrors. \u2022 Clean out the refrigerator. \u2022 Vacuum daily. \u2022 Wax floors. \u2022 Dust furniture, ceiling fan blades and light fixtures. \u2022 Bleach dingy grout. \u2022 Replace worn rugs. \u2022 Hang up fresh towels. \u2022 Bathroom towels look great fastened with ribbon and bows. \u2022 Clean and air out any musty smelling areas. Odours are a no-no. Scrutinize \u2022 Go outside and open your front door. Stand there. Do you want to go inside? Does the house welcome you? \u2022 Linger in the doorway of every single room and imagine how your house will look to a buyer. \u2022 Examine carefully how furniture is arranged and move pieces around until it makes sense. \u2022 Make sure window coverings hang level. \u2022 Tune in to the room's statement and its emotional pull. Does it have impact and pizzazz? \u2022 Does it look like nobody lives in this house? You're almost finished. Check Curb Appeal If a buyer won't get out of her agent's car because she doesn't like the exterior of your home, you'll never get her inside. \u2022 Keep the sidewalks cleared. \u2022 Mow the lawn. \u2022 Paint faded window trim. \u2022 Plant yellow flowers or group flower pots together. Yellow evokes a buying emotion. Marigolds are inexpensive. \u2022 Trim your bushes. \u2022 Make sure visitors can clearly read your house number. Now you are set Get yourself an exceptional agent with specialised knowledge and experience in your area, and let the viewings begin.

        "text":"Tips for Teaching Kids How to Act Around Unfamiliar Dogs\n\nMay 27, 2014\n\nBy Laurie Darroch\n\nChildren are curious and fascinated with everything. Unless they have a fear of dogs, naturally they are curious about them as well. They are likely to simply walk up to a dog that is wandering around or being walked by a human companion, without understanding that there are etiquette and safety issues involved when approaching an unknown dog. It\u2019s important to teach children the ins and outs of their own behavior around unknown dogs, as well as how to interact with both the dogs and dog owners.\n\nApproach or Not Approach?\n\nUnless an adult is accompanying a young child, it is a good idea to teach kids not to approach a dog out for a walk with its human without knowing if they should or not. So they won\u2019t be tempted if they come across a dog when you are not around, make sure your child understands not to approach a dog that is running around loose unless they know the dog and the dog knows them. They won\u2019t be bringing home any stray dogs that way either. Sure, the pull is powerful when a child sees a cute dog that they want to meet or play with, but for safety\u2019s sake it is best to teach them not to approach strange dogs on their own, or as an alternative to find an adult they know who will help them.\n\nPeople out walking their dogs or playing with them in a public place do not necessarily want kids running up to their dog. Even a trained and calm dog may feel unsure with an unknown child and react in a nervous or unfriendly manner. Some dogs just do not do well with strangers, or may feel protective of their human. The dog may be in training and has not learned how to behave correctly around unknown people. The last thing you want is a child or dog with an injury that could have been avoided.\n\nAsk Permission\n\nThis is an important rule. Even adults forget to ask permission to approach an unknown dog sometimes when the owner is out with their pet. Some owners would prefer their dog not be bothered. Others may need to help the dog get used to the idea, or prefer to do the leading. Some dogs are not used to children or are not child friendly.\n\nA child needs to learn to ask for permission from the owner if they meet the two of them while they are out and about. They can ask \u201cIs it alright to pet your dog?\u201d or \u201cMay I pet your dog?\u201d It is simple courtesy and respect for both the owner and the dog. Whatever the answer is, the child needs to understand that it is a firm answer.\n\nThere are also particular dogs such as Seeing Eye dogs that should not be approached. They are well trained and well behaved, but they are working when they are out walking with a visually impaired companion. If that person gives permission after they are asked then it\u2019s fine, but no one should assume it is without asking.\n\nYou may find that meeting a person with a seeing eye dog who is willing to communicate with your child will also provide the added bonus of providing a learning experience in understanding and empathy, and might help the child become interested in service type dogs.\n\nThe Dog\u2019s Body Language\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the human that has a say in the interaction. The dog has some say too. Teach your child to understand the body language the dog exhibits. Their tail may be wagging in happy anticipation, or down in nervous fear.\n\nThe dog\u2019s body position is an indicator as well. Is the dog straining to come meet the child or pulling back in fear? Obviously aggressive barking, growling or showing teeth in anger is a definite warning indicator to not approach the dog.\n\nPatience is a Virtue\n\nOnce a child gets permission to pet an unknown dog, they need to know the right way to have contact with the dog. Many children are likely to jump forward excitedly. Depending on the dog, this may make them fearful or uncomfortable, or even be seen as a form of aggressive behavior from the child toward the dog. Trust has to be established between dog and child. Dogs interpret human body language as well as voice.\n\nTeach your child to bend down close to the level of the dog. Slowly reach a hand out with the palm down offering the back of the hand, and allow the dog to approach the child at its own pace and comfort level to sniff the offered hand. Show the child how to talk in a calm soothing voice to the dog and to wait patiently. Some dogs may still not want to approach, so don\u2019t push it.\n\nMeeting a dog should be a positive experience, but a child needs to know the right and wrong ways to do it, or whether to do it at all. It is simple enough to teach a child and for them to learn.\n\nTop photo by Janet Hudson\nMiddle photo by MsSaraKelly\nBottom photo by Tony Alter\n\nRead more articles by Laurie Darroch\n\nShare this:\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\n  \u2022 WordPress\n  \u2022 Facebook\n  \u2022 Google Plus\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

When you start your search, you'll want to form a check list of features you need to have, get a plan of what neighborhoods and school districts you'd like to live in, and begin working on your budget. A good principle to follow is that your mortgage payment should be a third of your monthly income.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Get in touch with the best real estate team\u00a0\nThat's where we come in. We can arrange a time to meet so we can talk about your real estate needs and get an idea of your upcoming plans. We'll talk about the mortgage industry, other economic factors that could affect your buying decision today or in the future, as well as neighborhoods and schools in the Central Florida area.\n\nIn addition, we'll help you start the loan process. \u00a0The Sally and David Team of Premier Sotheby's International Realty works with some of the finest mortgage professionals in Central Florida, so you'll be in great hands. They'll assist you in choosing which type of loan is best for you and help you get qualified.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Start house-hunting\nAfter our initial meeting, we'll start searching for homes on the market that suit your exact needs. We'll get a sneak peek of the best homes available and remove the duds, share via email an initial group of available homes for you to preview, and then by working with you, we'll schedule appointments to view the homes at a time that's convenient. \u00a0You will also receive real-time alerts to any new listings that come available as well as market alerts for listings going under contract or recently sold, only within the areas or communities you care about, so that you are always kept in the loop as to new opportunities and market activities.\n\nWhen we tour the homes you've selected, we'll point out positive features, as well as negative ones. \u00a0We'll even ask you to tell us about things you like and don't like so that we can refine your search preferences. It's pretty common for buyers to amend their wish list as we tour homes and some things become far more essential than others. If that's the situation, we'll search the listings once again and trim it down to the home you've been wishing for.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Get a feel for the market\nYour agent's awareness of the Central Florida home market is an essential element in your house search. And we assure you we're well acquainted with all the schools and neighborhoods, and we will communicate which districts are \"hot\" and warrant immediate action and the rest that are \"cool\" and allow for thoughtful examination.\n\nAs we tour homes, we'll be sure to tell you if the list price has room for negotiation or if we believe the home is \"priced to sell.\" When working with an agent, trust your instincts and be sure to ask plenty of questions, as every real estate agent will claim to truly know the market. If it doesn't seem like they know everything, call us at 407-928-3760 \/ 407-687-7295 or e-mail us at \/, and we'd be glad to answer any questions you have. Our understanding of the market will keep you a step above the rest through the entire deal.\n\nStep 5 \u2013 Find the house of your dreams\nWe know we'll find the home of your dreams. When we do, we'll thoroughly develop your real estate purchase offer. The offer will be custom tailored to suit your needs, specific to your goals and most importantly, minimizing your risk and exposure. A few examples are acquiring financing, completing the inspection period, and ensuring clean title and title insurance.\n\nLet Premier Sotheby's International Realty guide you through finding your dream home in Lake Mary When submitting your offer, you'll likely want to present \"earnest money.\" This is a cash deposit made to secure the offer to purchase the property and shall be credited to you at time of closing. If the offer is accepted, we will manage the process for you, allowing plenty of time for your mortgage financing, home inspections and any final details important to you.\n\nStep 6 \u2013 Negotiate\nMost contracts don't close on the beginning offer, and it's widely common to receive a counter offer. Don't let it intimidate you. We'll discuss whether or not to agree to the counter offer, submit our own counter offer, or decline the seller's offer and move on.\n\nHow aggressively we negotiate the deal depends on market circumstances. We'll also work within your financing constraints. And when it's all said and done, we'll create a contract that's best for you.\n\nStep 7 \u2013 Obtain your loan\nOnce the deal is signed, you'll start working with your lender to close the loan. If you've been pre-qualified, this shouldn't take much time at all, but you'll need to keep in close contact with your mortgage lender. And we'll manage all the property information your mortgage lender will need to close the loan.\n\nStep 8 \u2013 Close the deal\nYour lender will give you a Loan Estimate (LE) detailing your closing costs within three days of taking your application. This estimate rests on the loan amount, and RESPA requirements order that it has to include all closing costs and fall within a tight range of accuracy. we'll study the estimate and let you know if everything looks permissible.\n\nThen we'll close on your home. This will probably take place at a title company or escrow office and we will ensure that it will be a smooth and comfortable event.\n\nStep 9 \u2013 Move in\nSuccess! Now you can move into your new house. Enjoy it. And if you need anything or have any questions, just contact us at 407-928-3760 \/ 407-687-7295 or send us an e-mail.\n\nLooking to Buy?\n\nAre you looking to buy a house? Let us help you.

        "text":"Edit Article\n\nTwo Methods:Removing the Old HandleInstalling the New Handle\n\nThe handle on a toilet is an important component to any bathroom design. Not only is it integral to the function of the toilet, but the style and finish of the handle should also coordinate with the rest of the bathroom faucets and fixtures. If your toilet handle is corroded or out of date, replace it with a new one to keep your bathroom functioning in style.\n\n\nMethod 1 of 2: Removing the Old Handle\n\nBefore the new handle can be installed, the old handle needs to be removed from the tank properly.\n\n  1. 1\n    Shut off the water valve to the toilet and flush the toilet to drain any water from the tank.\n  2. 2\n    Remove the lid from the toilet tank.\n  3. 3\n    Unscrew the wing nut that holds the tank lever to the back of the handle. Set it aside to be reinstalled with the new handle.\n  4. 4\n    Unscrew the nut from the back of the handle. Toilet nuts thread in reverse; turn the nut clockwise to remove it.\n    \u2022 If the nut is plastic, use your fingers to loosen it.\n    \u2022 If the nut is metal, use a wrench to help loosen it.\n  5. 5\n    Pull the handle through to the front of the tank and remove the nut and washer from the back of the toilet tank. Discard these parts.\n\nMethod 2 of 2: Installing the New Handle\n\nToilet handles install similarly to the way the old ones are removed.\n\n  1. 1\n    Unscrew the washer and nut from the back of the new handle. The washer is a rubber gasket that helps prevent leaks. It sits up against the nut and slides right off once the nut is removed.\n  2. 2\n    Push the new handle's stem through the hole on the side of the toilet tank.\n  3. 3\n    Slide the washer over the handle's stem and screw the nut back into place. Remember that it threads in reverse; screw it on counterclockwise to tighten it.\n  4. 4\n    Lift up the toilet lever and push its end down through the hole at the end of the handle's stem.\n  5. 5\n    Screw on the wing nut to the end of the toilet lever to hold it in place.\n  6. 6\n    Turn on the water valve to refill the toilet tank.\n  7. 7\n    Flush the toilet to make sure the new handle works.\n  8. 8\n    Replace the tank lid.\n\n\n  \u2022 Toilet handles come in left and right hand versions, as well as front and side tank versions. If in doubt, take your old handle with you to the store to purchase a new one to ensure the new handle fits the tank properly.\n\n\n  \u2022 Do not over tighten the nut against the toilet tank. This may result in the porcelain of the tank cracking under pressure. Only tighten the nut enough to hold the handle securely in place without the handle jiggling when the toilet is flushed.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\n  \u2022 Wrench\n\nSources and Citations\n\nArticle Info\n\nCategories: Toilet Maintenance\n\nIn other languages:\n\nEspa\u00f1ol:\u00a0reemplazar la manija del inodoro,\u00a0Italiano:\u00a0Sostituire la Maniglia dello Sciacquone del Water,\u00a0\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439:\u00a0\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0435,\u00a0Portugu\u00eas:\u00a0Substituir a Descarga de um Vaso Sanit\u00e1rio,\u00a0Deutsch:\u00a0Einen Toilettenhebel austauschen\n\nThanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 56,179 times.\n\nDid this article help you?\nYes No\n\nan Author!\n\nWrite an Article",

        "text":"How to Arrange Different Colors of Knock Out Roses in a Garden\n\nIn 2000, Bill Radler introduced the original Knock Out rose (Rosa '\"Radrazz\"). Since then, several new varieties of Knock Out roses have emerged on the market. Knock Outs are hardy, easy to care for and an ideal complement to any landscape. Medium-sized shrub roses, the Knock Out family typically grows to 3- to 5-feet tall, and sometimes taller when left unpruned and natural. Incorporating several varieties of Knock Outs into your flower beds offers a rainbow of color that can accentuate your home and blend in with the rest of your landscape.\n\n\nChoose the varieties of Knock Out roses you want in your landscape. While there are seven different varieties, the colors are only pink, dark reddish-pink (red) and sunny yellow. There is not a true red Knock Out, and the Rainbow, Blushing, original and Pink are all various shades of pink. The Blushing variety is a light pink, while the Rainbow is a light pink with a yellow eye. The Sunny Knock Out has a delicate yellow bloom that fades to cream. The Pink Knock Out and Double Pink Knock Out are a baby pink. Most varieties are single blooms, while the Pink and original Knock Outs come in a double-bloom variety as well.\n\n\nSketch out your flower beds where the roses will go on a piece of graph paper. Use colored pencils to indicate the colors of plants you already have in your garden.\n\n\nDraw your Knock Out roses into the sketch where you want their colors to complement one another or other plants you already have. All of the pink varieties blend attractively with each other, while incorporating the Sunny Knock Out into places full of darker colors works nicely. On the same note, incorporating the darker, original Knock Out rose complements areas of your garden where the flowers tend to be lighter. For a rose garden, mix and match all of the varieties to make for a consistent splash of color throughout. Alternating between the dark original, a lighter pink variety and then the Sunny can create an exciting look without being too overwhelming.\n\n\nPlant your Knock Outs according to your sketch, keeping the minimum distance between them approximately 3 feet on center.\n\nThings You Will Need\n\n  \u2022 Graph paper\n  \u2022 Colored pencils\n\n\n  \u2022 The arrangements really come down to your personal taste. If you want all of the colors, alternating them is a good choice that keeps you from getting stuck with spots overloaded with too much pink.\n  \u2022 Keep in mind the foliage color. The Blushing variety has blue-green and dark-green foliage, while the single and double varieties of the original have dark-green and purple foliage. The other varieties have dark green foliage.\n  \u2022 The Rainbow is more compact than the other varieties, while the Sunny is slightly more compact than the others and more upright.\nSuggest a Correction",

        "text":"A wood stove can be one of the smartest purchases you ever make for your home.\n\nA wood stove can be one of the smartest purchases you ever make for your home. Not only can a wood stove provide a warm and cozy ambiance, it can also be a simple and efficient way to heat your space and reduce your overall energy costs.\n\nSelecting the right wood stove doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or confusing. To begin, it\u2019s helpful to think about how you want the stove to work for you. Do you want it to provide supplemental heat, back-up heat, ambiance or an occasional fire on cool nights? Knowing how you will be using your stove will guide each decision about heating needs, construction type and combustion system.\n\nJust follow this quick buying guide to determine the best choice for your location, heating needs and lifestyle. And if you\u2019d like to learn more, your local Quadra-Fire dealer will be happy to help you weigh the options to find the right stove for you. To find one in your area, head over to our Dealer Locator.\n\nStove Size\nWhile you certainly don\u2019t want to buy a stove that\u2019s too small to do the job, buying a too-large stove can also create problems such as chronic underfueling that can contribute to creosote creation. Your Quadra-Fire dealer will help you to find the \u201cjust right\u201d size for your needs.\n\nSize of area to be heatedWill the stove be heating a room or a larger space?\n\nStoves come in small, medium and large sizes, and determining the right size depends on both the square footage of the space as well as what other heating system (if any) is at work.\n\nSince there are many variables, your best bet for determining the right size wood stove for your space and heating needs is to consult with a local stove expert.\nHeat lossDoes home design contribute to heat loss?\n\nIn addition to the size of the heating area, you\u2019ll need to think about how much heat could be lost from older or insufficient insulation or through the number of and size of windows, especially those with only single-pane glass. Higher ceilings can also contribute to heat loss.\n\nConsider the layout of your home when determining the size of wood burning stove you plan to purchase. A smaller stove might be able to handle heating a one-story space, or one with an open floor plan. A larger unit might be required for an area with multiple levels, hallways and bedrooms.\nGeographyWhat\u2019s your climate like?\n\nIf you live in an area with severe and prolonged winters, you might require a larger stove than those living in milder climates.\n\n\nCast iron or steelDo you have a preference about your stove\u2019s material?\n\nCast iron stoves are often more ornate in their design and can retain heat longer after the fire goes out. They are usually higher in cost than steel stoves. Some cast iron stoves are available in colors that complement the d\u00e9cor of your home. For example, Quadra-Fire iron stoves are available in Classic Black, Porcelain Mahogany, Porcelain Frost, Porcelain Dark Blue and Porcelain Black.\n\nSteel stoves are more streamlined in their appearance, usually heat up more quickly and are typically less expensive than cast iron stoves. They are typically only available in black.\n\nCombustion System\n\nNon-catalytic or catalyticHow does the stove reduce emissions?\n\nAll Quadra-Fire stoves are non-catalytic. They create a good environment for combustion right in the firebox, and they\u2019re appreciated for their beautiful rolling fires. They require much less owner attention and hands-on monitoring than catalytic stoves.\n\nCatalytic stoves must be burning hot enough before the catalyst is engaged. They also require regular cleaning. Their operation is somewhat more complicated and hands on than that of non-catalytic stoves.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nBurn time How long will a stove burn a load of wood?\n\nStoves can have burns times of anywhere from eight to 40 hours. Those times can vary model by model, and can also vary by type and species of wood being burned, wood moisture content and size of wood load.\n\nMost Quadra-Fire models feature Automatic Combustion Control (ACC) Technology, a burn-rate control system that feeds air to the fire when needed, based on the amount of heat desired.\nAutomationWhat features can make my stove easier to operate?\n\nQuadra-Fire Adventure Series models are fully automatic, with no manual air controls to manage. Their programmable thermostat works like the programmable thermostat for a furnace, and allows you to specify lower temperatures when you\u2019re away or higher ones for when you return home. Theirs is also an \u201calert\u201d feature when it\u2019s time to add wood to the fire.\nLoadingIs wood loaded on top or in the front?\n\nWood stoves can be loaded from the top or the front.\nCertificationIs the stove EPA certified?\n\nEPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification requires compliance with strict emissions and efficiency regulations designed to reduce pollution and control energy costs. All wood stoves on the market must be EPA certified.\n\nAll Quadra-Fire wood stoves are outfitted with a patented Four-Point Burn Systems, which are four distinct combustion cycles to maximize fuel-to-heat conversion. They fully burn every log, while re-burning gases and smoke up to four times. That means you have fewer trees to cut or cords to buy, less particulate emissions and far less ash to clean up.\n\nReady to take the next step?
