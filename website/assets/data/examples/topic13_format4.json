Some books are touchstones.\n\nSo all this makes me curious: \u00a0do you have an absolute favorite cemetery book? \u00a0Is there one you turn to again and again, either because it\u2019s so fascinating that you always learn something new or because the photos are so lovely that you find looking at it so inspiring or restful?\n\nWhat is your favorite cemetery book?\n\nAbout Loren Rhoads\n\nI'm co-author of a series about a succubus and her angel. Angelus Rose, the final book, came out in February 2020. I am the editor of Tales for the Camp Fire: An Anthology Benefiting Wildfire Relief. I'm also author of 199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die and Wish You Were Here: Adventures in Cemetery Travel--and a space opera trilogy.\nThis entry was posted in Cemetery poll, Photo Challenges and tagged , , , .

Jo says:\n\n    This is an impressive amount of books! I don\u2019t have too many, but I really relied on Maine\u2019s Coastal Cemeteries by Karen Batigani when I was in Maine both times \u2014- I\u2019ve got penciled-in notes in my copy (actually, two copies \u2013 on the second trip, we forgot our copy and had to purchase another one once we got to Maine).\n\n\n    \u2022 Loren Rhoads says:\n\n      That sounds like me an Permanent Californians. I keep buying copies every time I find one used and giving it away to whoever\u2019s visiting at the time.\n\n\n      \u2022 Jayson Jordan says:\n\n        I cannot say I was aware of this \u2018Saving Graces\u2019 title, but it does sound worth the extra effort to get ahold of a copy. Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n        You are very welcome, and quite deserving of the praise. I\u2019m trying to curtail purchases at the moment, but shall certainly keep them in mind, thank you kindly!\n\n\n  3. Jayson Jordan says:\n\n    When it comes to cemetery books, I was going to mention \u2018Beautiful Death: The Art of the Cemetery\u2019, but I see you already mentioned it. However, the photos are quite divine in this book, so it was worth mentioning it again. Another book that I find extremely fascinating when it comes to historical depth is \u2018The Victorian Celebration of Death\u2019 by James Stevens Curl. Granted it is perhaps not a straight-forward \u2018cemetery book\u2019, but certainly in relation to the subject.\n\n    By the by, I really enjoyed that wondrous magazine \u2018Morbid Curiosity\u2019, but unfortunately I only came upon it by its last issue.\n\n\n  4. Albin says:\n\n    Unfortunately, all of the cemetery books I love most are all in Turkish and difficult to find in the US. But as far as content, arrangement and wealth of photographic\/illustrative materials goes; a slim volume by Nidayi Sevim titled \u201cMedeniyetimizin Sessiz Tan\u0131klar\u0131: Ey\u00fcp Sultan\u2019da Osmanl\u0131 Mezar Ta\u015flar\u0131 ve Mezar K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fcm\u00fcz\u201d [roughly: \u201cOur Civilization\u2019s Silent Witnesses: Ottoman Gravestones in the Ey\u00fcp Sultan Cemetery and our Burial Culture\u201d] Istanbul: Abidiye Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 2007. A neat little book on the Ottoman burial practices one finds at the age-old burial ground near the end of the Golden Horn in Istanbul.\n\n\n    \u2022 Loren Rhoads says:\n\n      Thanks for all of that information! I don\u2019t know as much as I should about grave monuments beyond American and Western European cultural traditions. Hopefully I can track something down in English about Turkey. I am planning to go to Istanbul for my birthday next year. I want to explore Istanbul\u2019s grave traditions, but I\u2019m not sure where to start. Can you advise me?\n\n\n      \u2022 transennae says:\n\n        Sure\u2026 I can provide you with some of the maps\/materials I generated for the little talk I did on Istanbul Cemeteries at the AGS Conference late-night session this past June. Unfortunately, as far a books on the subject go, there isn\u2019t a lot in print on cemeteries [mezal\u0131klar] in general \u2014 either in English or Turkish. As one might expect, a major portion of what IS out there deals specifically with archaeological aspects of Ottoman-period burial sites (\u201cantiquities\u201d being such an important topic for municipal and national authorities). One really great book \u2014 as a general reference \u2014 which is in English is Edhem Eldem\u2019s _Death in Istanbul: Death and Rituals in Ottoman-Islamic Culture_ (Istanbul: Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Center, 2005).\n\n\n      \u2022 Loren Rhoads says:\n\n        That sounds like a great place to start. I\u2019ll track the book down.

        "text":"Monday, September 20, 2010\n\nThe bonfire of the vanities\n\nIn 1490 a Dominican priest Girolamo Savonarola entered Florence on a mission from the church. He had spent years alone in his cell in a monastery studying the scriptures and was appalled at the evils and excesses of the renaissance society. With the fabulous wealth of the Di Medici bankrolling the explosion of art, fashion and luxury in Florence standing in contrast to the poverty of the common man, Florence was a place of shocking contrasts. There was a plague called the French Pox (syphilis) and a growing resentment of the ruling classes by the ordinary citizens. The coming millennium (1500) was fueling a movement that speculated that the end of times was at hand. Savonarola was a gifted and fiery speaker though possessed of a small voice and unimposing figure. He preached the coming of the last days and claimed communication with God and the saints.\n\nSavonarola denounced the sinfulness of the Florentines, he proclaimed the faults in the church itself and denounced the ruler of Florence, Lorenzo Di Medici. His sermons were wildly popular among the rich and the poor alike and he drew crowds of thousands. Lorenzo gave fortunes to the poor and attempted to win over Savonarola. Unable to convince the fiery priest to desist in his criticism of the Di Medici rule, Lorenzo ordered him to stop or he would be expelled from the city. Savonarola\"s reply was that Di Medici must repent and stated that he, although not a citizen would remain in Florence and Lorenzo would be forced to quit the city. Lorenzo sickened and from his death bed called Savonarola to come so he might be absolved of his sins. The priest made three requests of Lorenzo. The ruler was to confess and believe that God would forgive his sins. The second was to return to the people wealth that Savonarola felt Lorenzo had come by immorally and the third was that Lorenzo must return to Florence the rights that they had possessed before the rise of the DiMedici. The last, Lorenzo refused, rolled over to face the wall and died.\n\nSavonarola continued to preach and prophesied the destruction of the Florentine state by a force that would come over the Alps. Charles the VIII of France arrived at the head of an army and fulfilled Savonarola's predictions. The French expelled the Medici and set up a republic with the consent of the Florentines. Savonarola was charged with administering that. Florence became a theocracy and named Christ as their king. The city was swept up in a fervor of repentance. Woman discarded their fabulous gowns and began dressing simply in drab colors. The taverns and gambling houses emptied and were closed.\n\nThis new Puritanism encouraged, even required the citizens to bring the trappings of \"earthly vanity\" to the Piazza Della Signoria to be burned. They brought playing cards and books that were deemed secular, fashionable gowns, cosmetics, wigs and mirrors and musical instruments, then ancient sculpture and finally fine paintings. Into the enormous bonfire on February 7, 1497 went the works of Fra Bartolemo, and Lorenzo Di Credi and probably Sandro Bottecelli, possibly by the artists own hand. Florence burned great art and private libraries. Plenty of the citizens of Florence were fed into bonfires for good measure.\n\nAs Florence's economic conditions worsened though, the people began to realize that Savonarola's anti business policies of opposition to free trading and profit were partly if not mostly to blame. There were riots and the taverns reopened to a thirsty city, too sober on repentance.\n\nThe Pope excommunicated Savonarola who had become a nuisance to him and ordered the priest arrested. After a bloody riot that resulted in the death of Savonarola's guards he surrendered and was charged with heresy, false prophesy and other charges. He and two of his closest aides were tortured. Broken on the rack Savonarola confessed and was condemned to death. The three were hung from a large wooden cross by chains over a bonfire on the same site as the burnings of the \"vanities\". The charred remains of the three were broken up and reburned until nothing was left and thrown in the Arno, beside the Ponte Vecchio to deprive his followers of relics.\n\nSavonarola and the Bonfire of the vanities are remembered as an example of fanaticism. Their destruction of art and books remains a cautionary tale of the excesses of a theocracy turning on beauty and worldly pleasures. Artists, writers and lovers of aesthetics should remember this cautionary story and be aware there are forces in the world that are no friends to beauty and intellect. The soldiers of repression and narrow asceticism may seem powerless, but then suddenly gain strength and destructive force. The freedoms to make and enjoy art, to enjoy the beauty of fashion and poetry, music and the gaiety of wine and celebration are not perpetual and assured. They flourish in freedom and are a decoration to liberty.\n\nAbove is the music of Mansour, banned from his native Iran and living in California, part of the diaspora of Iranian artists. This is a great tune. I am fond of Iranian pop music.\n\n\nMCG said...\n\n...same as it ever was. Worst of all within visual art itself, on BOTH sides of the fence.\n\nTacook516 said...\n\nHi Stape,\nFreedom is very fragile, it depends on the 'golden rule' for it's survival. The day I was born the Holocaust was occuring to the east and the bombing of Heroshima in the west and my dear father was trying to survive as an officer in a German POW camp near Auschwitz. During that terrible year the Germans kept pulling back toward the 'homeland' (now that's a word that makes us old folks cringe!) they marched the prisoners several hundred miles in mid winter, many of them walked barefoot to save their boots for an escape. They ended up in Stalag 1, and on my first birthday, the Russians, after taking all their officers across the road and executing them ( Stalin didn't want anyone who had contact with the west returning to the 'motherland') turned the survivors over to the Americans, their allies in the war. My father weighed 68 lbs, he survived because in chewing the wood in the barracks to stave off hunger pain, he discovered a nest of termites. He always said to us, \"Beware the big lie\" when something is said by public figures and printed in the press over and over people begin to believe it. Good people will do things they would never think they could do. When hate is the solution, someone is benefiting by gaining power and money.\nPeople forget history so soon, when my great grandparents opened their hotel in San Francisco in the mid 1800's, to serve the gold rush the state of California was 99% Spanish or indians. Now we have hate mail going to Hispanic families who's ancestors were here before the 'white' man!\nA group at the Palm Springs Art Museum wanted to have a life drawing session, you wouldn't believe the hate mail, using their 'religious' belief to rationalize hate!\nI grew up in the middle east, there are people in our country who would outdo any Mullah if they could get into power. Books, paintings, people up in smoke.\nOh dear Stape I'm afraid you touched a nerve in me, my father and his compatriots sacrificed so much so that all of us could be free to disagree, and still be respected, Terry\n\nKarla said...\n\n$13,479,406,575,118.15 said...\n\nA tyrant is a tyrant is a tyrant. We want to protect \"our rights\" but not \" their rights\". Selective freedom is worse of all. And freedom at the expense of repressed others is no freedom at all: it's the tyranny of fear.\n\nIt's a very worthwhile post. This scenario has taken place many times and with many fires within our our beloved country. Banned in Boston bonfires: It's funny now but it was not very funny then. This righteous Boston, primarily Protestant movement was aimed at the Irish and Italian Catholic immigrants. Its effects lasting well into the 50's. My father, an American citizen, was arrested at the age of 12 for selling newspapers at the docks in East Boston because he was of Italian descent and Italy was allied with Hitler.\n\nSimone said...\n\n\"...Savonarola's anti-business policies.\" Was he into liberation theology? (lol)\n\nIn the interest of clarity Savonarola's fanatical tyranny was in no way reflective of the Church's social positions at the time. The Church had done a lot to preserve and sustain arts, the sciences, books and intellectual pursuits throughout the middle ages. Untold volumes were preserved for antiquity by the Church. Were it not for the Church the fine arts of painting, sculpture and architecture would not have flourished so.\n\nAlthough a tyrant himself, Lorenzo Di Medici was not oppressive and militant as was Savonarola. He used his diplomatic skills in an effort to unify the five Italian states especially against the possible invasion by the French.\nHis influence throughout Italy made him a the natural target of the French who in turn found a willing ally in Savonarola. If I had my guess I would say that the French used Savonarola to disrupt Florence. Most historians discount the story of Lorenzo being refused absolution on his death bed and speculate that he died a Catholic in good standing. In fact one of his son's eventually became pope as did one of his nephews. He was a splendid patron of the arts and of scholars.\nThat may be why the tyrannical Savonarola targeted the arts and books.\n\nIf stories of Florentine citizens being cast into the bonfires are true that was the doing of a maniacal tyrant who was excommunicated on moral grounds rather than doctrinal grounds. Technically, not a heretic but his violent threats against the Pope and the Roman Curia sealed his fate. The Pope and members of the Curia were present for his trial which was apparently conducted by civil authorities with his sentencing carried out by civil authorities. It was ultimately an uprising of the citizenry that drove the French out of Florence. That didn't settle it though.... (truncated)",

        "text":"Saigon Kids Emporium\nOctober 2017\n\u00ab Sep \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\nOld Saigon The Way It Was In 1955\n\nI thought everyone might enjoy seeing Saigon the way it looked in 1955. This collection of films was taken in November 1955.\n\nThose of us Saigon Kids who were in Saigon prior to 1961, this is pretty much the way Saigon was when we were there. The rapid changes, in Saigon, seemed to have come after 1961 for the most part.\n\nWhen I arrived in Saigon in April 1959 it still looked about the same as in this film and remained that way until my departure in early 1961. Saigon was really very mellow back then compared to the hustle and bustle that came with the war build-up starting in late 1961 to early 1962.\n\nIn many ways I\u2019m glad I left before the build-up for the war and the war years, as Saigon was such a beautiful peaceful place while I was there. As you can see in this film the traffic was not all that bad, like it became in later years (and is today).\n\nI hope you enjoy seeing what *Old Saigon* the former capital of French Indo-China was like. Some of the scenes in this film are the Municipal Theatre (Opera House), the fountain, Saigon City Hall with a large photo of Premier Diem (before he was President) over the entrance. Street scenes in a residential section of the city. A side walk vendor display of toy sampans near the edge of a park. The Catholic Cathedral. The river with vessels in the harbor and at the pier. Nearly deserted streets at noon to 3 pm (nap time) with most of the shops closed; and, a street vendor sleeping with his feet under his stand and hat over his face. Women street vendors with their baskets. Cars moving through the streets during heavy rains. Some great shots of the old original Continental Hotel and Tu Do Street, along with Le Loi Street, Flower Street and the Tax Building \u2026 on and on with old familiar places.\n\nJust for fun see how many places you can remember and name \u2013 LOL \u2013 \ud83d\ude42\n\n[Note: The last scene in the film is somewhat underexposed.]\n\nThere is NO SOUND to this film (your speakers are not broken) \u2013 LOL.\n\nAs always, you are welcome to leave your Comments below.\n\nEnjoy a journey back in time to the sweet sweet memories of *Old Saigon* \u2026 \ud83d\ude42\n\n\n20 comments to Old Saigon The Way It Was In 1955\n\n  \u2022 Bruce Thomas\n\n    Thanks for making that film available, Bob. It brings back fond memories of idyllic times along Rue Catinat, back 50 (count \u2019em!)years ago when my family arrived in July 1960.\n\n  \u2022 Leri\n\n    Thanks for the memories. I see you managed to capture La Pagode \u2013 the tea room anyway, and the old Continental Hotel across the street from Passage Eden. It really was a beautiful city\n\n  \u2022 Leri\n\n    I\u2019m wondering who Wilson, on the clip card, was. Mrs Wilson was a teacher and her son Ashley was a phenomenal painter. They were from Oklahoma.\n\n    \u2022 Leri \u2013 I was wondering the same thing *who is Wilson*. At the time these clips were taken (1955) I doubt there were more then 50 or so Americans in Saigon \u2013 mostly CIA and Military Intelligence personnel working covertly through the U.S. Embassy. When I arrived in 1959 there were only a total of about 450 Americans in all of Viet-nam.\n\n      I\u2019m assuming these clips were taken by an Army photographer as they were obtained (and copied to DVD) from the Department of Defense, Department of the Army, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, U.S. Army Audiovisual Center. They were originally *Classified* then years later *De-Classified* \u2013 why I do not know. Perhaps they were originally some type of surveillance footage.\n\n  \u2022 Suellen Oliver Campbell\n\n    The \u201cParis of the East\u201d was a beautiful city. The lovely people and the shady streets are as pretty as I remember.\n    C\u2019mon Bob and Ken\u2026can\u2019t you identify, \u201cWilson?\u201d\n    With all your locating skills I bet you can \u201cname that man\u201d in less than a week!\n    Thank you for sharing these pictues of Old Saigon. Sure brings back good memories from our tour there from 1958-60.\n\n    \u2022 Suellen \u2013 Actually, it took me *4.3 seconds* to locate *Wilson* \u2013 LOL \u2013 amazing how fast Google can find things \u2026 ha ha ha \u2013 \ud83d\ude42\n\n      Here\u2019s the scoop:\n\n\n      Gwendolyn Mary Wilson was born to Fannie Robinson Wilson and Dr. Cornelius Wilson in Dardaneele, Arkansas on December 8, 1907. Dr. Wilson moved the family to Des Moines, Iowa in August 1913 where he set up an office and continued with his medical practice. Dr. Wilson died in 1916. Fannie Wilson married Olin Cooper in 1937.\n\n      Gwendolyn Wilson attended Bryant Elementary School and West High School in Des Moines. Determined that her daughter get the best education possible, Fannie Wilson made arrangements for Gwendolyn to attend a special preparatory high school located on the campus of Rust College, in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Wilson graduated with honors in 1926 before returning to Iowa, where she was accepted to the College of Pharmacy at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City. After attending the University of Iowa for a year, Wilson transferred to the Des Moines College of Pharmacy, which later became the Drake College of Pharmacy. When Wilson graduated with a pharmaceutical\/chemist degree (Ph.C.) in 1930, she became the first black woman to obtain a pharmaceutical degree and to be officially registered as a pharmacist in the state of Iowa.\n\n      Although Wilson was highly qualified and certified by the state to practice pharmacy, she was unable to find work as a pharmacist. Wilson would later blame this on the economy during the Depression, labor legislation that restricted the number of hours women could work, and racism. Unable to find work in Iowa, Wilson returned to Holly Springs, Mississippi and taught seventh grade for a year before returning to Des Moines again. Wilson got a job waiting tables before being hired by Winnie (Mrs. N.E.) Coffin as a maid. In 1936, Wilson accompanied Coffin on a world tour to purchase artwork for the Des Moines Art Museum then under construction. The two women traveled extensively in China, Japan, Sumatra, Bali, Java, Singapore, and Australia. Their tour ended abruptly in August 1937 when Coffin died in Japan. Following Mrs. Coffin\u2019s death, Wilson returned to Des Moines where she married Lafe H. Fowler on January 19, 1938. They were divorced in 1946.\n\n      Gwendolyn Wilson Fowler finally obtained employment in her field in 1944 when she was hired by the State of Iowa Department of Health as a pharmacist\u2019s clerk. In 1950, Fowler took a position as a chemist in the Iowa State Department of Agriculture laboratory. As a temporary consultant on a special project, Fowler caught the attention of President Eisenhower\u2019s administration. Fowler became one of only nine women (and the only woman of color) to be selected for Foreign Service positions higher than secretary. In 1955, Fowler was assigned as a program analyst in Saigon, Vietnam where she was stationed for four years. After completing her Foreign Service assignment, Fowler returned to Des Moines and the Iowa State Department of Agriculture laboratory. In 1962, Fowler was hired by the Broadlawns Polk County Hospital as a staff pharmacist, a position she held until her retirement in 1974.\n\n      During her retirement, Fowler was active in volunteer organizations, including Wilkie House, the Red Cross, and the United Way. Fowler also served on the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association (YWCA) board of directors, the State Drug Abuse Council and the Des Moines Civic Music Board. Governor Robert Ray appointed Fowler to the Iowa Statewide Health Coordinating Council. Fowler was a lifetime member of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the African Methodist Episcopal Church. She was also a member of the Des Moines Sister City Commission, the Des Moines Women\u2019s Club, and the Drake University Alumni Association. In 1987, Fowler was inducted into the Iowa Women\u2019s Hall of Fame.\n\n      Fowler died in November 1997.\n\n      Click Here to read more about her. Well worth the additional reading, as you\u2019ll know a lot of the families mentioned in her papers who were in Saigon during 1955 \u2013 1959 time frame. I\u2019d love to get copies of her photo\/slide\/film collections of Saigon and Viet-nam. Hmmm? maybe I need to plan a trip in the near future \u2013 LOL \u2013 \ud83d\ude42\n\n  \u2022 Elizabeth Respess\n\n    Thanks, Bob. Even without the sound, the live action gives you the sense of pace that still photos can\u2019t.\n\n  \u2022 Susie Stann\n\n    Thanks, for the film, Bob. It sure does bring bakc memories.\n\n    PS Suellen! This is Susie Stann. Veny & I wondered whatever happened to you. We\u2019ve seen each other in San Francisco, Bali, & Vietnam. Want to email & catch up? I give Bob permission to give you my email.\n\n  \u2022 Kenneth R. Yeager\n\n    Ahhh Saigon\u2026what 17 year old kid wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed his or her time in Saigon? This film was a real trip down memory lane. Some of the cars were ones I didn\u2019t recognize and some of the streets, but the theme was perfect. During my time (1961-1964 with breaks) taxis (except to drop off), cyclos and bicycles were not allowed on Tu Do (Rue Catinat) Street. Bird watching was a favorite pastime (having a drink at an outdoor cafe or bar and watching the pretty girls go by). Oh what to live those days again. SIGH!!!!!\n\n  \u2022 Richard (Rique) turner\n\n\n    This is remarkable footage, especially the shots taken during a rainstorm. How did you happen to get ahold of it? Is there ever going to be a screening of The Poetic Geography of Saigon at the Kinh Do? I\u2019ve just completed the video for my current project, SEE ANGKOR AND DIE. It has a 4 minute segment that is the video version of my James Dean story.\n\n\n\n    \u2022 Hi Rique \u2013 Yes, I agree with you given the time this footage was taken it is very remarkable. It is even more remarkable that it is still in fairly good condition. Top secret *Clod* sources provided it \u2013 LOL \u2013 \ud83d\ude42\n\n      Poetic Geography of Saigon will not be screening at The Kinh Do, as *Passage Eden* seems a better fit \u2013 lol \u2013 since it was the Clod\u2019s favorite theater \u2013 \ud83d\ude42\n\n  ...

Rob Lawes\n\n    Rob Lawes Member\n\n    The thread title is something I've been pondering on for a while now.\n\n    We know what the outcomes of the initial inquiries were and the responses by White Star and the wider industry. Looking at the impact of these going forward, I think it's easy to argue that very few of the recommendations have had a significant impact on maritime safety.\n\n    The most obvious one that did was 24 hour radio coverage by all ships at sea. At least distress calls wouldn't be missed. With the advent of modern telecommunications this system has become even more reliable.\n\n    On the other hand, if we look at the lifeboats and space for all onboard, how many subsequent sinkings have had the time or list free ability to launch all of the available boats? None spring to mind. Various examples where this was impossible are available. The Estonia and Herald of Free Enterprise rolled over in minutes. The Andrea Dora, Costa Concordia and Oceanos listed so badly that only half their boats could be launched. Yarmouth Castle remained on an even keel but fire prevented passengers from accessing many of the boats.\n\n    In terms of practices and procedures at sea, a lot of these were already in place although there use was being implemented sluggishly. I suppose the Titanic sinking hastened the abandonment of the old style rudder orders and the standardisation of communication and distress signalling but again, this had already been agreed by international conferences before the disaster.\n\n    Finally, in terms of ship construction, ships would for many years after still become death traps in a fire or have fewer compartments open to the sea than Titanic and still sink. The fact remains, if enough water gets into a ship, no matter how high the bulkheads or the thickness of the double hill, she'll still end up on the bottom.\n\n    Overall, I think it's easy to argue that apart from the huge outrage at the time and the \"seen to do something\" response, the impact on maritime safety made by the Titanic disaster was arguably negligible.\n\n    Thoughts ??\n  2. Doug Criner\n\n    Doug Criner Member\n\n    There is an interesting incident where a subsequent marine disaster was worsened because of safety requirements adopted in the wake of the loss of Titanic.\n\n    In 1915, SS Eastland was loading passengers in the Chicago River, and capsized, killing more passengers than died aboard Titanic. After Titanic, Eastland had been required to add many more lifeboats, which caused the ship to become more unstable due to the reduction in metacentric height (and Eastland was rather tender, even before adding additional lifeboats). For more information, Google \"SS Eastland disaster\",\n    Rob Lawes likes this.\n  3. Aaron_2016\n\n    Aaron_2016 Member\n\n    I believe there were a number of positive changes that were made as a result of the disaster which may or may not have been a mandatory change, but were obeyed for the sake of safety. I believe shipping routes may have been moved further south by orders, or by the captain of each ships own discretion, and more rigorous ice patrols were created as a result of the Titanic disaster. Ships fitted with wireless would also operate longer hours and possibly the confusion of distress rockets and signal rockets were made more clearer. I wonder how often the Titanic was mentioned to all of the new recruits.\n\n    I agree the addition of lifeboats was more of a cautionary measure, and sadly there were no guarantees that more lives could be saved with more lifeboats. e.g. Here are a number of wartime disasters from 1915 - 1916. More lifeboats had little or no effect in the loss of life.\n\n\n    I wonder if the Titanic had more lifeboats, would the added weight cause her to roll over to port and sink more rapidly. Lightoller believed the movement of the passengers created a \"righting movement\" and the crew heard Captain Smith order the passengers to the starboard side \"to straighten her up\" and keep her balanced in the water. The additional weight of extra lifeboats on the port side might have rolled her over completely. Keeping the ship upright long enough to lower all available lifeboats was a difficult task. It was incredible how steady the Titanic settled down.\n\n    Last edited: Jan 3, 2019",

By the first week of March, this was reported in the Time magazine.\n\nLast week, as the Wehrmacht reeled farther & farther back into the Ukraine, the Germans were fast losing this vast (172,000 sq. mi.), heavily populated (31,000,000) territory, and the Russians were regaining one of their greatest centers of wealth.\n\n\u2026 One of the first tasks of German engineers was to repair and restore highways and bridges, to convert railways as far as the Dnieper to the narrower European gauge. Restoration of reconquered railways is bound to be a major problem for the Russians.\n\n(as they retreated)The Russians had destroyed 67,000 tractors, 18,500 heavy trucks, and 22,000 combines before they gave up the Ukraine. One result was that Ukrainian farmlands produced very little for the Germans. They were able to bring in about 5,000 tractors, and a few thousand plows. By forcing prisoners and peasants to work the fields 17 hours a day, the Germans were able to plant and harvest about 300,000 tons of grain, all types in 1942 (in 1937, the Ukraine produced 10,000,000 tons of wheat alone).\n\n\nWorld Battlefronts: BATTLE OF RUSSIA: What Hitler is Losing - TIME\n\nSo much for \"Russian soil for the Teutonic plow\".

The viable reasons for a German attack seem to get slimmer and slimmer.\nWars are rarely fought in black and white, but in infinite shades of grey\n\n(Poppy is occasionaly correct, or so I hear)\n\n0 user(s) are reading this topic\n\n0 members, 0 guests, 0 anonymous users",

A large amount of ballast (gravel) was hauled out of Lyndhurst Station back up to Forfar Station, the connection between the Brockville & Westport and the Canadian Northern. The ballast would then be hauled East and West of Forfar to fill up the roadbed to grade. A visit to Lyndhurst Station will reveal that, on both sides of the highway, especially the north side, a large amount of gravel was removed. There are other photos of a railway steam shovel loading those flatcars. The flatcars are from the Quebec & Lake St John Railway (Lac St Jean). The Q&LST was owned by the Canadian Northern.\n\nAdd your own comment.\nIs it OK to make your name public?\nIs it OK to make your comment public?\nPowered by \/ Aliment\u00e9 par VITA Toolkit\n\nMy favourites lets you save items you like, tag them and group them into collections for your own personal use.
