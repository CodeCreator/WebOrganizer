Hope u liked it! | if not then oh well :D\n\nFC: Cellerific Fairy Tales by: Jordyn Taylor and Amiri Fowler\n\n1: Goldilocks and the Three Cell Theories- pgs 1-2 | Snow White and the 10 Organelles- pgs 3-4 | The Gingerbread Man- pgs 5-6 | The Three Little Pigs- pgs 7-8 | Table Of Contents\n\n2: Goldilocks and the Three Cell Theories | Once upon a time there lived the three cell theories in a little house in the woods. They decided to go out to do some field research one day. While they were gone, Goldilocks was walking in the woods and came upon their house and went in because she was exhausted. She walked in and noticed three tables, so she went to each of them. At the first table she noticed a piece of paper that said the first principle of the cell theory. She continued reading it. It stated that all living things are made of cells. Theodor Schwann helped form this principle by concluding that all animals are made of cells in 1839. \\ | She thought this was really boring, so she went on to the next table hoping it would be something different. | When she got over there, she saw another paper reading: the second principle of the cell theory. This one stated that cells are the basic units of structure and function in an organism. Matthais Schleiden helped form this principle by concluding that all plants are made of cells in 1838. | 1\n\n3: After she was done reading, she figured she would go to the last table to see what it was about. The papers on that table said the third principle of the cell theory. As she read she learned that new cells are produced from existing cells. Rudolf Virchow concluded this in 1855. | All this learning about cells made her even more sleepy and she saw a comfy looking bed across the room. She fell asleep immediately. When the cell theories came back from their research, they noticed that someone had moved their papers and some were on the floor. They were very suspicious, so they looked around their house. When they went into to room where Goldilocks was sleeping, all of them screamed, which woke her up. She saw them and ran out the door as fast as she possibly could. That was the last time the cell theories ever saw Goldilocks. | 2\n\n4: Snow White and the 10 organelles | Once upon a time there was a princess named Snow White. She was very beautiful which her step-mother, the evil queen Clarissa, could not stand. One day the queen sent for a huntsman to kill Snow White so that the queen could be the most beautifulest in the land but the huntsman couldn't kill the princess so he told her to run deep into the forest and never come back. While going through the scary forest Snow White came across a tiny cottage. In the cottage there were 10 little beds in which Snow white combined in order to make a bed big enough for herself, and took a nap. When she woke up there was quite a surprise for her. 10 different organelles were standing over the bed watching her sleep. Once they all got over their initial shock, the 10 organelles introduced themselves. The leader of the group was Nucleus. Nucleus was the organelle that contained all the DNA in the group and helped make his friend ribosomes. Next were Smooth and Rough ER. They were joined at the hip but some what different. Smooth Er made lipids and Rough ER helped to transport the proteins that their next friend, Ribosomes, makes. Ribosomes was the smallest friend and he makes all the proteins for the group. Cilia was a girl with a lot of attachments that help the entire cell move. She was closely related to Flagella. Flagella was more like a whip shape and helped in even MORE movement than Cilia did. | 3\n\n5: Next was Cell Wall which was the HUGE body guard of the group. He provided that extra bit to help protect all of the organelles from evil things. Cell Wall was the accomplice to Cell Membrane. Cell membrane helped all the animal AND plants keep protected from all outside things. Cell Wall is only in plants for extra structure. Lysosomes was the organelle that digested everything in the group, especially bacterias. The last 2 organelles were Chloroplasts and Vacuole. Vacuole helped store different materials that the group needed temporarily. Chloroplasts helped only in the plants, and would convert the sunlight into food and energy for everyone. Snow White started to live with the 10 organelles and were living happily until one day an evil virus came and put Snow White into a deep sleep. She stayed in her sleep for 10 years until along came a handsome prince who kissed her awake. The two of them lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER! (just kidding they ended up getting divorced!) | Nucleus | Flagella | Cilia | Smooth and rough ER | Vacuole | Chloroplasts | 4\n\n6: Once upon a time there was an old lady and an old man who decided to make gingerbread. She gave him blueberries for eyes and cherries for buttons. She put him in the oven to bake. 30 minutes later the old man and lady wanted to eat the gingerbread man so the went to open the oven and the gingerbread jumped up and out of the open window. The old lady and old man kept screaming \"STOP STOP WE WANT TO EAT YOU!\" but the gingerbread man just kept on running and yelled back \"Run, run as fast as you can, you cant catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!\" | As the gingerbread man moved on he came across a field of moving, talking flowers with their cells enlarged. The cells on these flowers were very rectangular and blocky, with chloroplasts and a HUGE vacuole in the middle. These cells also had a cell wall just in case they needed the extra protection. Even though the flower and its cell did not need the gingerbread man to eat since they used carbon dioxide to make their food, they wanted to keep him as their play thing. STOP STOP they yelled at him, but on the gingerbread man ran and yelled behind him \"Run, run as fast as you can,you can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man. | Next the gingerbread man ran into a pack of lions with their cells showing around their mane. These cells had more of a round and irregular shape than the plants cell, and had a smaller vacuole and no cell wall because they were tough. They also had centrioles to help when the cells divide.!The lions wanted to eat the gingerbread man because they need sugar to convert into carbon dioxide in order to get energy. STOP STOP WE WANT TO EAT YOU! they yelled at the gingerbread man and they ran after him, but the gingerbread man was too nimble for them and easily ran on by. As he was running he yelled \"Run, run as fast as you can, for you can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man. | The Gingerbread Man | 5\n\n7: Next the gingerbread saw some Prokaryotic cells, or bacteria. There was barely anything to these cells. All they had were a cell wall for their shape and some cytoplasm on the inside\/ There were no organelles that the gingerbread man could see, especially a nucleus. They wanted the gingerbread man so that they could decompose him. STOP STOP! they yelled at him, but he was much too fast for them. He easily dodged them and ran way saying \"Run, run as fast as you can for you can't me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!\" | Right after the Prokaryotic cells he ran into some hybrid sakes (sunflower\/snake), or Eukaryotic Cells. These cells were much more complex than the prokaryotic cells. There were many different organelles that could be seen in the cell and were much larger with a nucleus. The sakes wanted the gingerbread man to be their friend. STOP STOP! they yelled at the gingerbread man but it was no use chasing after him for the gingerbread man was much faster than they were. The gingerbread man ran on with ease and yelled back \"Run, run as fast as you can for you can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!\" | The next thing the Gingerbread man happened to come by was a rabid unicorn! The unicorn went wild and started to chase the gingerbread man. \"Run, run as fast as you can for you can't_\" but it was too late for the rabid unicorn, Alfifa, had caught up with the Gingerbread Man and chewed him down in one piece. \"Ahhh yum yum yummy in my tummy! Your like a party in my stomach Gingerbread Man!\" Alfifa said in his crazy rabid voice! And so all the others caught up with the rabid unicorn, got angry that HE ate the Gingerbread Man and ended up killing him too for they were so mad at Alfifa,s o they both died in the end. | 6\n\n8: The Three Little Pigs- Homeostasis and Cell Membrane | Once upon a time there lived the three little pigs. One day they decided to each build there own house. The first little pig built his house out of straw, the second one built his out of sticks, and the last one built his out of bricks. Then along came the big bad wolf. He and huffed, and puffed and blew down the first pigs house, and ate him. Then he moved on the the second pig's house. He huffed and puffed and blew the house down and ate the second pig. When he got to the last little pigs house, he huffed and puffed, but couldn't blow the house down because it was brick. That little pig was smarter than the wolf, so when the wolf climbed the roof, the little pig put a fire in the fireplace. The little pig was safe inside his house now. That was the end of the big bad wolf. | 7\n\n9: This story represents how our body uses homeostasis. Homeostasis is the ability to maintain balance or equilibrium in your body. When the big bad wolf blew down the first two houses, it destroyed the balance of its environment. Our body has to keep balance even when there are outside forces effecting it. For example if you get sick, which is caused from outside germs, your body has to fight off the virus to keep your body balanced by making a hot environment. If it gets too high though, it can start to kill off cells. Your body has to also maintain a regular pH level for the cells to function properly. If this doesn't happen you coul... (truncated)",

        "text":"Tuscumbia Aliens \u2013 Claude Edwards Story\n\n\nClaude Edwards of Tuscumbia, Missouri, was a hard-working 64-year-old farmer and he didn\u2019t believe in flying saucers or little green men. That was until the early morning of February 14, 1967. Edwards began the day as always, with his morning walk from his home to the barn. As he came over a small hill and was able to see his fields he knew this day was going to be very different.\n\n\u00d7Like us on Facebook\n\nfollow us on Twitter\n\nThe first thing that Edwards noticed was that all of his cattle were at one end of the field, all of them looking in the same direction. Edwards looked to see what had captured the attention of his herd and gazed upon an amazing sight.\n\nClaude Edwards\nClaude Edwards\n\nIt was one of those flying saucers, sitting in his field, surrounded by a group of little green men. The aliens were about three feet tall and moving about very quickly. The farmer said the little green men had big black eyes or perhaps were wearing goggles. Where the nose and mouth should have been was a protrusion that Edwards believed may have been some type of breathing device.\n\nInteresting?

He said it was like walking into a wall and he was not able to get any closer. At some point the little green men got back into the saucer and it began to move.\n\nThe saucer slowly lifted from the ground and headed off, gaining speed as it went until out of sight. Edwards never reported seeing the strange visitors again and there were no other witnesses, except a herd of cattle who remained silent.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\n\nChapter XXXVI\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nFor a long and weary hour we tramped over this great bed of bones. We advanced regardless of everything, drawn on by ardent curiosity. What other marvels did this great cavern contain\u2014what other wondrous treasures for the scientific man? My eyes were quite prepared for any number of surprises, my imagination lived in expectation of something new and wonderful.\n\nThe borders of the great Central Ocean had for some time disappeared behind the hills that were scattered over the ground occupied by the plain of bones. The imprudent and enthusiastic Professor, who did not care whether he lost himself or not, hurried me forward. We advanced silently, bathed in waves of electric fluid.\n\nBy reason of a phenomenon which I cannot explain, and thanks to its extreme diffusion, now complete, the light illumined equally the sides of every hill and rock. Its seat appeared to be nowhere, in no determined force, and produced no shade whatever.\n\nThe appearance presented was that of a tropical country at midday in summer\u2014in the midst of the equatorial regions and under the vertical rays of the sun.\n\nAll signs of vapor had disappeared. The rocks, the distant mountains, some confused masses of far-off forests, assumed a weird and mysterious aspect under this equal distribution of the luminous fluid!\n\nWe resembled, to a certain extent, the mysterious personage in one of Hoffmann's fantastic tales-the man who lost his shadow.\n\nAfter we had walked about a mile farther, we came to the edge of a vast forest not, however, one of the vast mushroom forests we had discovered near Port Gretchen.\n\nIt was the glorious and wild vegetation of the Tertiary period, in all its superb magnificence. Huge palms, of a species now unknown, superb palmacites\u2014a genus of fossil palms from the coal formation\u2014pines, yews, cypress, and conifers or cone-bearing trees, the whole bound together by an inextricable and complicated mass of creeping plants.\n\nA beautiful carpet of mosses and ferns grew beneath the trees. Pleasant brooks murmured beneath umbrageous boughs, little worthy of this name, for no shade did they give. Upon their borders grew small treelike shrubs, such as are seen in the hot countries on our own inhabited globe.\n\nThe one thing wanting in these plants, these shrubs, these trees\u2014was color! Forever deprived of the vivifying warmth of the sun, they were vapid and colorless. All shade was lost in one uniform tint, of a brown and faded character. The leaves were wholly devoid of verdure, and the flowers, so numerous during the Tertiary period which gave them birth, were without color and without perfume, something like paper discolored by long exposure to the atmosphere.\n\nMy uncle ventured beneath the gigantic groves. I followed him, though not without a certain amount of apprehension. Since nature had shown herself capable of producing such stupendous vegetable supplies, why might we not meet with mammals just as large, and therefore dangerous?\n\nI particularly remarked, in the clearings left by trees that had fallen and been partially consumed by time, many leguminous (beanlike) shrubs, such as the maple and other eatable trees, dear to ruminating animals. Then there appeared confounded together and intermixed, the trees of such varied lands, specimens of the vegetation of every part of the globe; there was the oak near the palm tree, the Australian eucalyptus, an interesting class of the order Myrtace\u00e6\u2014leaning against the tall Norwegian pine, the poplar of the north, mixing its branches with those of the New Zealand kauris. It was enough to drive the most ingenious classifier of the upper regions out of his mind, and to upset all his received ideas about botany.\n\nSuddenly I stopped short and restrained my uncle.\n\nThe extreme diffuseness of the light enabled me to see the smallest objects in the distant copses. I thought I saw\u2014no, I really did see with my own eyes\u2014immense, gigantic animals moving about under the mighty trees. Yes, they were truly gigantic animals, a whole herd of mastodons, not fossils, but living, and exactly like those discovered in 1801, on the marshy banks of the great Ohio, in North America.\n\nYes, I could see these enormous elephants, whose trunks were tearing down large boughs, and working in and out the trees like a legion of serpents. I could hear the sounds of the mighty tusks uprooting huge trees!\n\nThe boughs crackled, and the whole masses of leaves and green branches went down the capacious throats of these terrible monsters!\n\nThat wondrous dream, when I saw the antehistorical times revivified, when the Tertiary and Quaternary periods passed before me, was now realized!\n\nAnd there we were alone, far down in the bowels of the earth, at the mercy of its ferocious inhabitants!\n\nMy uncle paused, full of wonder and astonishment.\n\n\u201cCome!\u201d he said at last, when his first surprise was over, \u201cCome along, my boy, and let us see them nearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied I, restraining his efforts to drag me forward, \u201cwe are wholly without arms. What should we do in the midst of that flock of gigantic quadrupeds? Come away, Uncle, I implore you. No human creature can with impunity brave the ferocious anger of these monsters.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo human creature,\u201d said my uncle, suddenly lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper, \u201cyou are mistaken, my dear Henry. Look! look yonder! It seems to me that I behold a human being\u2014a being like ourselves\u2014a man!\u201d\n\nI looked, shrugging my shoulders, decided to push incredulity to its very last limits. But whatever might have been my wish, I was compelled to yield to the weight of ocular demonstration.\n\nYes\u2014not more than a quarter of a mile off, leaning against the trunk of an enormous tree, was a human being\u2014a Proteus of these subterranean regions, a new son of Neptune keeping this innumerable herd of mastodons.\n\nImmanis pecoris custos, immanior ipse!1\n\nYes\u2014it was no longer a fossil whose corpse we had raised from the ground in the great cemetery, but a giant capable of guiding and driving these prodigious monsters. His height was above twelve feet. His head, as big as the head of a buffalo, was lost in a mane of matted hair. It was indeed a huge mane, like those which belonged to the elephants of the earlier ages of the world.\n\nIn his hand was a branch of a tree, which served as a crook for this antediluvian shepherd.\n\nWe remained profoundly still, speechless with surprise.\n\nBut we might at any moment be seen by him. Nothing remained for us but instant flight.\n\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d I cried, dragging my uncle along; and, for the first time, he made no resistance to my wishes.\n\nA quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster!\n\nNow that I think of the matter calmly, and that I reflect upon it dispassionately; now that months, years, have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell us\u2014what am I to think, what am I to believe?\n\nNo, it is utterly impossible! Our ears must have deceived us, and our eyes have cheated us! we have not seen what we believed we had seen. No human being could by any possibility have existed in that subterranean world! No generation of men could inhabit the lower caverns of the globe without taking note of those who peopled the surface, without communication with them. It was folly, folly, folly! nothing else!\n\nI am rather inclined to admit the existence of some animal resembling in structure the human race\u2014of some monkey of the first geological epochs, like that discovered by M. Lartet in the ossiferous deposit of Sansan.\n\nBut this animal, or being, whichsoever it was, surpassed in height all things known to modern science. Never mind. However unlikely it may be, it might have been a monkey\u2014but a man, a living man, and with him a whole generation of gigantic animals, buried in the entrails of the earth\u2014it was too monstrous to be believed!\n\n  1. The keeper of gigantic cattle, himself still more gigantic!\n\n[prev] [up] [next]\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Zvi Har'El\n$Date: 2007\/12\/27 12:58:30 $",

        "text":"A Mathematical Adventure, or, How I Spent an Afternoon Proving Nothing.\n\nOver the course of a few boring classes last year, I discovered that the product of two numbers plus the square of their difference divided by four is equal to the square of their average:\n\n(a * b) + (a - b) ** 2 \/ 4 = ((a + b)\/2) ** 2\n\nAt the time, I thought that it was a pretty neat equation. I couldn't find a use for it, but still was happy about it. I showed my math teacher. She thought it was ... interesting ..., but couldn't say that it had a purpose.\n\nSo, today, I was thinking up fun things to do, and I realised that it had been a long time since I played with numbers. I was thinking back to my previous discovery. I thought, \"Self, what would I have to add to the product of _three_ numbers to get the square of their average? Wait, make that their cube!\"\n\n(a * b * c) + B = ((a + b + c) \/ 3) ** 3\n\nSo, I played around a bit, found out how much of my basic algebra skills had disappeared. It was fun; the feel of the fountain pen in my hand as it left a delicate trail of green ink on beautiful white paper was exhilerating, refreshing. After a while, I found that the bridging factor was the cube of their sum over twenty-seven, less their product:\n\nB = ((a + b + c) ** 3) \/ 27 - (a * b * c)\n\nI didn't think real hard about that. I went on to four digits, and eventually found that for n digits, the bridging factor was:\n\nB = sum ** n \/ n ** n - product\n\nPlugging that back into the equation, I found:\n\nproduct + sum ** n \/ n ** n - product = (sum \/ n) ** n\n(Remember, average is (sum \/ n)\n\nI realised that I had goofed; that I had an equality that was basically \"x + y - x = y\". I felt pretty dumb. I decided to conduct an investigation. I looked back at the equation for two numbers:\n\n(a * b) + (a - b) ** 2 \/ 4 = ((a + b)\/2) ** 2\n\nThe bridging factor there concealed the fact that I was simply subtracting the sum; if I had bothered to expand it, I would have noticed:\n\n(a - b) ** 2 \/ 4 = (a + b) ** 2 \/ 4 - (a * b)\n\nSilly me! It was good entertainment and stretched my brain, even if the only tangible evidence of my endeavour is a large pile of scrap paper on the edge of my desk.\n\nLog in or register to write something here or to contact authors.",

In what can only be called a gigantic leap in evolution, certain cows have started to develop the skill of blending into certain environments, not unlike the chameleon. Scientists are currently exploring the fact that many of the seemingly abandoned fields across the west country of the UK could actually be home to hundreds of cows which have, over the years, been reported missing.\n\n\"I gots to tell you, I ain't seen nothing like it before,\" Farmer John, owner of several cows which he thought had disappeared, told UnNews \"But to be honest I don't know whether I'm relieved or not, I milked one of them cows this morning and I got to tell you it was hard enough finding the bloody thing let alone trying to work out where to hold the pail for the milk.\" A few of the owners of the livestock are worried that many of their cows will not be returned to them, not because they won't be found, but simply because they will have no way to work out the letters which would have been branded onto the animals for this exact reason. More worrying is the fact that this new development may make it harder for farmers to control the outbreak of such bovine illness as Mad Cow Disease. Although the effected cattle have been cleared of these conditions, it is feared that cattle from out of the county may make their way down to Devon and possibly pass on the infection by mating which would be impossible to keep track of.\n\n\"At this time we don't want to be thinking of such bad things like Mad Cow, you know\" Farmer John continued, \"right now we just want to make sure that all of the cows are safe and are adjusting to this new way of life. Our next step is to place purple splodges of paint on each cow so that we can at least contain them in the field. Tracking devices will also be installed shortly.\" Although many of the farmers are concerned for the well being of their cattle, vets who have performed check ups on all of the located cows have found most of them to be in extremely good health leading scientists to explore another theory. Phillip Iaining, a Scientist specialising in genetics and the evolution of animals has spoken of research into the condition, \"We were most intrigued when we heard of this new development in cows and immediately set out to look into it.\" He said, talking from outside a farm in North Devon where a further outbreak has appeared, \"As we have already heard from the many veterinarians who have checked out the cows, they seem to be in good health and we can only suggest that this invisibility is some sort of defense mechanism. The cows, if you like, have apparently evolved overnight.\"\n\nMany have questioned the validity of the research into this idea, calling it silly and other cruel terms however it's the only one which seems to be backed up. Statistics show that the consumption of meat is steadily rising each year and that farmers are having to breed and kill more cattle so that they may fill the ever growing order. \"They must have caught on, that's all. I mean, it's got to look strange really hasn't it?\" Farmer John persisted in talking to us, \"Friends and family being led out of the field by farmers, shortly followed by a shotgun blast, never to return again. You know, something must of just clicked and they came to their senses.\" For years now farmers have been campaigning for cloning to begin on the cattle so that families of cattle don't have to be immediately separated and therefore live longer, grow maturer and taste nicer.\n\nAll around the country farmers have begun to cull any invisible livestock that they happen upon in an attempt to discourage similar behaviour patterns in the remaining cows. It is yet to be revealed if any action is to be taken against animals, such as sheep a creature which has always been thought of as mentally inferior.\n\n\nPersonal tools",

It often causes SEHS.\n\nThere are two variations of the Number sense contest. The first, and most common, allows participants to write down answers without using any scratch work or calculators of any kind. The second, however, does not allow to participant to use a pencil, instead further enhancing mental abilities by forcing participants to telepathically transmit their answers to their paper.\n\nedit Competition Details\n\n\nGuess what the kid in the middle tried to do? That's right, he tried to look at the test prematurely. Good job, Franko.\n\nStudents are trapped in a room, most commonly a high school room (though sometimes college), with a proctor. The tests are handed out to the students, face down. Any student that looks at the test before hand will be disqualified (or in rare occasions, murdered). When the proctor says \"Go\" or \"Start the fucking test,\" the students are allowed to look at the tests and begin working all the problems. They are to be timed for 10 minutes and no scratch work, marking over wrong answers, or erasing wrong answers is not allowed. For every problem answered correctly, you are awarded five points; for every problem skipped or answered incorrectly, four points are deducted from your score. It is impossible to score a perfect score unless you are God. In fact, anything over 300 at least warrants Deity status.\n\nedit Problems Typically Seen on a Test\n\nThe difficulty of the problems vary from test to test, ranging from stupid easy to impossible. Examples are:\n\n  \u2022 2+2=\n  \u2022 2*3=\n  \u2022 The f(x) is defined as ln(x*52\/17)+C where C is some arbitrary constant. If the f(6)=7.1538, then the f(e)(rounded to 4 decimal places) is _______\n\nAs you can see, for the most part the problems are quite difficult (especially the first two examples). However, there are short cuts typically found for each problems.\n\nedit Example 1\n\n  \u2022 2+2\n\nBy using the Identity Property of Addition we are able to separate the problem:\n\n  \u2022 1+1+1+1\n\nFrom here, we can take advantage of the Distribution Property and manipulate it further to get:\n\n  \u2022 1*(1+1+1+1)\n\nWe can then simplify the inside of the brackets:\n\n  \u2022 1*(4)\n\nWe can then recognize that 4= 2^2 and substitute:\n\n  \u2022 1*(2^2)\n\nSpreading out all the factors and taking away the brackets leaves us:\n\n  \u2022 1*2*2\n\nYou can then derive the answer using simple multiplication and fill it in the answer blank, which looks like this:\n\n  \u2022 2+2=73\n\nedit Example 2\n\n  \u2022 2*3\n\nThis is commonly referred to as the Three's Trick. To first tackle this problem, one must first realize that 3=6\/2. We can then substitute it into the equation, like so:\n\n  \u2022 2*6\/2\n\nYou then can notice the 2s cancel out, leaving you with:\n\n  \u2022 2*3=6\n\nedit Example 3\n\nExample 3 is usually considered one of the easier problems on the test (and they show up frequently). Simple math is all that is required to derive that: f(e)= 6.3620\n\nedit Practicing\n\nThough in most cases you will be unable to score higher than a 8, if you are determined enough you can break double digits. The most common study habits are to take 5 number sense practice tests every 7 minutes. This is obtained by concentrating so hard, you actually create a time warp causing yourself to relive the same 7 minutes numerous times. The only people to have ever been noted to use this study method are God and Oscar Wilde. Even though there have been other study patterns developed over the years, they've all been discovered to be completely worthless.\n\nPersonal tools",

        "text":"Boundary Condition: Chapter 5\n\nA Fire in Heaven\n\nThe proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.\n\u2014 Sun Tzu, circa 300\u00a0B.C., \"Five Ways of Attacking with Fire.\"\n\nMission Control was unaccountably understaffed; three of nine people had failed to show up for work, and their backups took forty minutes to plug in and come up to speed on the mission details.\n\"Is there a plague?\" Robert wanted to know, grumping into his headset microphone.\n\"Just a gorgeous July morning,\" the capcom officer on the ground had answered. He sounded like a kid, and nobody on the station seemed to know who he was in more than a recognize-the-name kind of way.\nAnyway, this put departure ops nearly an hour behind schedule, which necessitated all sorts of rushing around. There wasn't much time for sappy handover sentiment, or for proper procedural training. In six months the station crew had settled into a very efficient routine, which they'd had little chance to run through with the new crew. Galley power off before you switch the water heaters on, etc., etc. But if they missed their landing window it would be another full day before they could get out of here, and nobody seemed willing to consider it.\n\"Take care of her,\" was pretty much Robert's sole instruction to the new commander.\nJim, for his part, told Kennet to call his cell phone if she needed anything. The phone didn't work up here, of course, but once he was on the ground \u2014 or even near it \u2014 he'd be back in that part of the world again. The Noosphere, Tielhard had called it. The buzzing atmosphere of information that surrounded the planet, thicker and thicker every year.\nAmusingly, Pope Dave had a heavy-looking satellite phone that did work up here. He spent several hours yakking into it in Italian while the crew rushed and fussed around him. \"I'm told this thing would work on the moon,\" he remarked to Jim at one point, covering the mouthpiece with his hand. \"It's secure, too; heavy encryption. Pretty cool.\"\nHmm. Perks of the job. \"The chicks must love you,\" Jim answered, then caught himself. He'd just zinged the Pope. A regular-guy kind of Pope, to be sure. Easy to talk to, all that. But a billion people did look to him as their spiritual leader. Would Jim talk to the President that way? To a movie star? Probably, yeah, but he ought to watch it just the same. The Swiss Guard didn't like him already, and made no particular secret about it.\nFinally it was time to seal the hatch, to isolate the atmospheres, electrical systems and computer networks of the shuttle and station. Jim and Chip walked through the steps together, each making sure the other hadn't left anything out.\n\"Some Russians died that way,\" Chip noted. \"Left a valve open and suffocated.\"\n\"Pretty crappy valve design,\" was Jim's answer to that. General Spaceplane did a much better job of idiot-proofing. Still, since idiocy was one of the universe's truly limitless resources, he trusted nothing and triple-checked everything.\n\"No, no, vi ho detto,\" the Pope was telling his guards when Jim and Chip worked their way back to the mid-deck airlock. \"I'm not riding in that thing. I want to see.\"\n\"See what?\" Chip asked.\n\"Reentry.\" Dave jerked a thumb at the pair of jacks behind him. \"These guys expect me to sit in the escape pod the whole time. There isn't even a monitor screen. I spent the whole launch sequence in there, and never saw a thing until we were already in orbit.\"\nHmm. Jim had seen that escape pod \u2014 was in fact about to check its circuit breakers and air vents \u2014 and he wouldn't want to ride in it, either. It was a two-seater only slightly bigger than a Mercury capsule, or a really compact sportscar. Still\u2026\n\"Reentry's the most dangerous part of our flight profile, Dave, and this is clearly the safest spot on the ship. It would look pretty bad for the 'Service if anything happened.\"\nThe Pope considered that unhappily. Here was his one and probably only trip into space, and he couldn't look out the window? \"I'm here as your guest,\" he allowed. \"Naturally I'll follow whatever course you recommend.\"\nHmm. Yeah. \"We can tie the door open with a bungie cord,\" Jim suggested. \"From here if you\u2026 if you lean forward and crane your neck you should be able to see the mid-deck monitors. That's all we have to look at, me and Tomo and Chip. This isn't a tourist ship. Your guards can ride up in the cockpit, where the actual windows are.\"\n\"Nein,\" said one of the jacks in a thick European accent. \"One in the cockpit. One in the pod with His Holiness. I insist on it.\"\nThat was no skin off Jim's nose either way, so he ran the arrangement by Robert and Lisa, who approved it without complaint. So, five minutes later when the systems were duly isolated and cross-checked, he strapped himself into the seat immediately forward of the pod, with Chip on his right and Tomohiro on his left. \"Ready?\" he called back to Dave and the guard.\n\"Whenever you are,\" the Pope confirmed. Boy, he did look cramped back there.\n\"Mid-deck ready,\" he said into his headset, pressing the push-to-talk.\n\"Aaah, roger that,\" answered Lisa, then rattled off a string of numbers for the benefit of Robert or Mission Control or somebody.\nAnd then, with surprisingly little fanfare, they detached from the station, drifted away for a minute and a half, then fired a series of bursts on the attitude control motors, to turn the shuttle ass-backward in its orbit. They were behind schedule, so a whole series of checks and rechecks were skipped, while the pilots went straight into the deorbit routine.\n\"Point-three gee burn, eleven minutes nine seconds duration,\" Lisa said, presumably reading the figures off one of her displays up there. \"Ignition in three minutes forty-one seconds.\"\n\"These are going to be a long three minutes,\" Dave noted, not over the headset but just calling forward.\nBut they weren't, really. Much longer was the deorbit burn itself, with the unfamiliar tug of gravity \u2014 or acceleration, anyway \u2014 on their bodies, on their chests and faces. They were all on the best gravity drugs and had kept to the exercise regimen so their bones and muscles didn't wither. Even so, after six long months of zero-gee, the pull of anything on your body felt more than a wee bit suffocating. Jim felt it most in his throat \u2014 a squeezing sensation, a feeling that his windpipe was no longer round, but some sort of oval. At point-three gee! They'd be pulling five times that much in a few minutes, when the shuttle turned around to face, nose first, a wall of gluey atmosphere at bone-searing temperature and speed.\nThe burn wasn't loud \u2014 just a hum and roar, like the sound inside a moving car \u2014 but nobody much tried to talk over it. When it was finally over, though, Jim turned and looked back into the pod.\n\"You okay back there?\"\n\"Perfectly, thanks.\"\nAnd as it happened, these were the last clear words ever spoken aboard that ship.\n\n\nDeath comes upon us in strange ways, shockingly sudden and disarmingly weird. Even months in a sickbed can't really prepare us for what's to come; the event arrives on its own time and terms, and everyone is caught off guard. Living one moment, struggling the next, and finally just gone.\nThere was no contrail. There was no explosion. Initially at least, there was no debris. Whatever you might have heard, it wasn't a missile. But there was a sudden streak of ionized air molecules, here in the wispy tendrils of the upper upper atmosphere. As near as Space Command was able to figure it, the shuttle Oberon was struck by an antisatellite energy weapon \u2014 most likely a hydrogen-fluoride laser based somewhere in central Asia. The Free Will Index was very high in that region; the choice to fire was made deliberately.\nShall we imagine human malice reaching out through a window of favorable weather? Shall we speculate on an agenda furthered, a To Do box checked off, a connection to the disappearances of NWS staffers in Omaha? Perhaps God or some other force could have intervened, or (troublingly) perhaps it did, in planting the seeds of these events. But the telemetry is clear enough: the beam passed completely through the fuselage in a tenth of a microsecond, unimpeded, leaving two fist-sized holes.\nJim's own perception was more muddled; one moment everything was fine, and in the next there came an orange flash and a loud noise, like the popping of air-filled bags. Bang! Bang! And there was a fierce wind, and sharp bits of something flying all over the place, and everyone was screaming.\nThe strangest property of accidents is the way we perceive them: not as movies but as comic books. \"It happened so fast. It happened so slow.\" People say both of these things, and mean them, because the event breaks up into a series of discrete, vivid snapshots.\nFlash: Jim was somehow out of his seat, and looking aft at the escape pod, and the Swiss Guard was there with a panicky look on his face, trying to pull the hatch closed and punch the fuck out of there. But the hatch was bungied open.\nFlash: Something lurched, hard, and suddenly Jim was back there on the pod, falling against the door in some kind of weak gravity. He was trying to draw a breath from the roaring air; he was hot and cold and hotter still. Flash: the guard, in his space-jack flightsuit, was rolling up out of his chair and grabbing at the bungie cord, realizing the hatch wouldn't close until he somehow untied the thing.\n\"You're panicking,\" Jim wanted to tell him. \"Just slow down and watch what you're doing.\"\nBut the words wouldn't come, and the part of Jim's brain that composed them was at the back of his skull, somehow \u2014 a passenger watching quietly while Jim himself panicked and thrashed. He wanted to help with the bungie cord, but that desire didn't seem to connect in any way with the actio... (truncated)",

        "text":"A Tall Tail\n\nThis year for Tor.com\u2019s birthday, we\u2019re initiating a tradition of Rocket Stories! For this inaugural year, enjoy an exclusive read of \u201cA Tall Tail\u201d by Charles Stross a week before it appears on the site! (One of the perks of being a registered user on the site.)\n\n\u201cA Tall Tail\u201d is by Charles Stross, a British SF author who now lives in Scotland. He is the author of the Laundry series and the Hugo-winning novella \u201cThe Concrete Jungle.\u201d\n\nThis story was acquired and edited for Tor.com by Tor Books editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden.\n\n\nThis is true, I swear:\n\nI was in Orlando in October, staying in one of those big, bland conference hotels. DARPA, the Pentagon department tasked with nurturing Mad Science in all its most speculative forms, had decided to throw a brainstorming conference on the 100 Year Starship\u2014a mind-meld to try and figure out what research they\u2019d have to conduct in order to have a hope of beginning to build a starship some time in the twenty-second century. And for no reason I clearly understood, they decided to fly in a bunch of SF authors from all over the world. I\u2019m not sure why the Pentagon might want a starship, but I was glad someone was paying for me to go to Orlando and kibitz on their conference, and I was happy to bloviate about such things from a hard SF point of view.\n\nThe 100YSS conference exceeded all my expectations\u2014and everyone else\u2019s. But the sheer amount of information on tap made the experience feel a bit like trying to drink from a fire hose. It turns out there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about how to build a starship, but also a lot that we do know, and this was the mother of all networking opportunities for folks with an interest in the field.\n\nLike all networking sessions, a lot of the interesting stuff happens among small groups by the poolside bar, or over a dinner table in a nearby restaurant. You get talking to some interesting-sounding folks who ply you with beer, and the next thing you know you discover you\u2019ve been drafted into some kind of DARPA-funded think tank, or wake up with a hangover in a North Korean labour camp, doomed to spend the next two years coaching the Great Leader\u2019s son through writing the Nobel Prize\u2013winning SF novel that daddy expects him to produce.\n\nLuckily that\u2019s never happened to me, but I have had an eye-opening experience or two. Like the chat I had on Sunday evening by the swimming pool.\n\nThe Orlando conference center where they held the 100 Year Starship event had a resort-grade outdoor water attraction. Not only were there hot tubs and a regular swimming pool and a water slide, this hotel had an artificial river about a quarter of a mile long, down which you could drift along on a truck tire, propelled by aquajets and drenched by fountains. On a muggy October evening, after a long day of listening to talks about liquid indium ion drives and aneutronic boron fusion reactors, this was exactly the right place to hang out if you wanted to bump into inebriated floating rocket scientists. Like Greg Benford\u2019s twin brother, Jim.\n\nYou probably know Greg Benford best as a physicist and hard SF writer, one of the \u201cKiller B\u2019s\u201d who dominated the field in the 1980s and who is still actively writing novels and research papers. But you might not be aware that Greg has an identical twin, or that his sibling Jim is a card-carrying rocket scientist. Back in 2011, Jim was doing impressive things with microwave sails, and Greg was talking up the applications of a lot of recently declassified Russian research into nuclear thermal rockets: \u201cThey built this underground test complex near Semipalatinsk, so that they could capture the exhaust. And then they ran their motor for nearly five hundred hours. That\u2019s about a thousand times longer than Project NERVA managed, in total\u2014in one burn! It\u2019s safe, and it\u2019s reliable, and it\u2019s the best way of getting to the outer planets.\u201d His tire spun slowly round as he drifted under one of the fountains, and because we were orbiting near opposite sides of the artificial river, our paths diverged. Intrigued, I paddled to catch up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think launching a nuclear reactor might be a bit problematic?\u201d I asked, as I closed to within hailing distance. \u201cI mean, the antinuclear protests when Cassini launched . . .\u201d\n\nJim waved dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s safe as houses,\u201d he assured me. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for safety, right? Nuclear thermal, you launch the reactor fuel piecemeal in Soyuz or Dragon capsules with a man-rated launch escape system, then fuel the reactor once it\u2019s in orbit. No, nuclear-thermal is fine. Not very efficient, but it\u2019s not going to kill anyone. If you want efficient propulsion technology, you\u2019ve got to look elsewhere. But unfortunately the best rocket tech we know of is far too dangerous to use.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dangerous?\u201d\n\nJim winked at me. \u201cLet me introduce you to Leonard,\u201d he said as we drifted toward the poolside cocktail bar. \u201cHe\u2019ll fill you in on it . . .\u201d\n\n\nLeonard Hansen\u2014not his real name\u2014is a tanned seventy-something rocket scientist who spent the 1950s in California and New Mexico, as a graduate student researching rocket fuels under John D. Clark and then as a fuels scientist working on various missile programs. Today he lives in semiretirement in Florida, but he retains a keen interest in the field of rocket fuel design.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to understand is that in order to go faster, you need to increase the exhaust velocity,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can do this by making it much hotter, or by using lighter exhaust particles. If you want to make it hotter, however, you need to pump more energy into it. So if you\u2019re using chemical rockets, you need to use very energetic reagents\u2014fuel and oxidizer.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a mouthful of lime margarita. \u201cTake the space shuttle,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cWith just two tweaks, we could have put a hundred tons into its payload bay!\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo tweaks?\u201d I asked doubtfully. A hundred-ton payload (in a vehicle already massing close to a hundred tons) would have put the shuttle in the same bracket as the Saturn V.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled sourly. \u201cThey could have stretched it, given it a bigger thermal protection system as well\u2014the Columbia disaster wouldn\u2019t have happened. But they rejected my proposal. The first part, to upgrade the SRBs, would have been trivially easy! Although the alternate oxidizer for the space shuttle main engines would have presented certain handling difficulties, that much is true . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him about the SRBs first,\u201d Jim suggested. He leaned forward expectantly; at a guess, he\u2019d heard this before.\n\n\u201cAll right. First, the solid rocket boosters. Regular SRBs run on a mixture of ammonium perchlorate\u2014the oxidizer\u2014and finely powdered aluminum, suspended in a rubbery polymer that holds everything together and provides additional reaction mass. When they ignite you get aluminum oxide and ammonium chloride and lots of energy. But it\u2019s not really enough! We could make them about twenty percent more efficient if we just replaced the aluminum with powdered beryllium. It\u2019s a lighter atom and the redox reaction is more energetic\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on!\u201d I stared at him. \u201cBeryllium is really poisonous. Wouldn\u2019t that\u2014\u201d\n\nLeonard shook his head. \u201cNonsense.\u201d A small smile. \u201cYou see, then there was my second proposal. If you replace the oxidizer in the space shuttle main engines with liquid fluorine, you could also get an extra twenty percent out of them. And I know what you\u2019re going to say next: wouldn\u2019t that give rise to an exhaust plume of extremely hot hydrofluoric acid? You\u2019re absolutely right: it would! But hydrofluoric acid reacts with beryllium oxide to give you beryllium fluoride\u2014which is almost inert in comparison\u2014and hydrochloric acid, which is neither here nor there.\u201d A shadow crossed his face. \u201cIt\u2019s totally safe, compared to some of the other projects I\u2019ve worked on. But NASA took one look at the environmental impact statement and, and . . .\u201d His shoulders began to shake; whether with laughter or tears, I couldn\u2019t tell.\n\nNow, I have a background in chemistry. And I think I should explain at this point that liquid fluorine is not your friend. Fluorine is the most active elemental oxidizing agent in the periodic table, and liquid fluorine makes liquid oxygen look inert and unreactive. It likes to oxidize things we don\u2019t usually think of as oxidizable, like water\u2014which it reacts with to product hydrofluoric acid, which is in turn nasty enough that sane people avoid working with it because if you forget for one second what you\u2019re dealing with it\u2019s liable to dissolve your bones.\n\nBack in the nineteenth century, chemists used to joke that you could tell who had just discovered elemental fluorine by reading the obituary columns. But liquid fluorine and hydrofluoric acid are themselves not the worst oxidizing agents out there. Elemental fluorine may be the thuggish hit-man of the halide world, but if you torment it with chloride ions you can turn it into the chemical equivalent of Hannibal Lecter: chlorine trifluoride, an oxidizing agent so malignant that it will set fire to water and burn explosively on contact with sand, asbestos, or rocket scientists.\n\nJim Benford smiled. \u201cNow why don\u2019t you tell him about the proposal for NAIL SPIKE?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Leonard looked confused for a moment. \u201cI thought he\u2019d be more interested in D-SLAM\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that Project PLUTO?\u201d I asked. I\u2019m enough of a crazy cold war projects geek to have heard of the atomic powered cruise missile\u2014a device that only Dr. Strangelove could have loved\u2014from the 1960s.\n\n\u201cYes, D-SLAM was PLUTO,\u201d said Jim. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that interesting, unless you want a power source for a drone that can explore the atmosphere of Jupiter for years at a time. NAIL SPIKE, on the other hand\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNAIL SPIKE was a CIA project.\u201d Leonard polished off his cocktail and put the glass down on the bar, just loudly enough to get my attention. He caught my eye. I sighed, and waved at the bartender.\n\n\u201cAre you supposed to be talking to me about it, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cMe being a fore... (truncated)",

Most people don't need to know that Feynman diagrams are \"graphical representations of a perturbative contribution to the transition amplitude or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory\".\n\nIn simpler terms, Feynman diagrams are basically just diagrams showing how a particle interaction works, in a nice graphical, easy-to-understand way. Isn't that a nicer description?\n\nPretty much everything I want to say about Feynman diagrams is actually in the comic. You don't need scary-looking equations to explain scientific concepts. (Though sometimes the equations do make neat summaries.)\n\nI remember vividly learning about these in my university quantum physics courses, and being utterly blown away by the fact that one simple interaction (electron-positron annihilation) and another simple interaction that looks at first glance to be completely unrelated (photon scattering off an electron) look exactly the same if you swap around time and space and think of antiparticles as normal particles moving backwards in time. It's not just the case for this interaction either - there are plenty of other interactions involving all sorts of other particles that work just as well when rotated this way.\n\nThis is not necessarily to say that antiparticles are normal particles moving backwards through time. It's not really clear what that would actually mean in practical terms. But if you think of them that way, quantum physics still works, and becomes considerably simpler in the process. So it's a powerful way of thinking about it than can help you solve real world problems.\n\nIn many ways, this is actually one of the less weird aspects of quantum mechanics.\n\nLEGO\u00ae is a registered trademark of the LEGO Group of companies, which does not sponsor, authorise, or endorse this site.\nThis material is presented in accordance with the LEGO\u00ae Fair Play Guidelines.\n\nIrregular Webcomic! | Darths & Droids | Eavesdropper | Planet of Hats | The Prisoner of Monty Hall\nmezzacotta | Lightning Made of Owls | Square Root of Minus Garfield | The Dinosaur Whiteboard | iToons | Comments on a Postcard | Awkward Fumbles\nLast Modified: Thursday, 9 December 2010; 02:11:01 PST.\n\u00a9 2002-2017 Creative Commons License\nThis work is copyright and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported Licence by David Morgan-Mar.",

        "text":"The Book of the Moon\nHome Contents Reviews & Essays Links About Me Contact\nTrashing the Moon\nMoon in Smog The space race is back on and this time the contestants are India and China. The prize is Helium 3, a key potential fuel for nuclear fusion. 24 tonnes of helium 3, a shuttle load 24 would keep America powered up for a year. While the earth has only an estimated 15 tonnes of helium 3 the moon has about 5 million tonnes. Once more the moon is exerting its power and we are in the grip of a new lunacy, a madness that could cause us to destroy the moon itself.\n\nThe seeds of this madness were planted thirty nine thousand years ago, in the Lembombo Mountains in Swaziland. There, one of our ancestors painstakingly carved a lunar calendar into a piece of bone.\nThree thousand years later another ancestor carved the phases of the moon into a bone taken from an eagle's wing. To make the carvings they would have had to rig up a system of rocks or sticks with which they could observe and mark the movements of the moon. They would have had to devise a way to make notes and records of their observations or perhaps they achieved it through a phenomenal act of memory. The job would have taken years. Those ancestors started something which we have obsessively gone on doing ever since.\n\nWe do not know how those Stone Age moon watchers made their lunar observations or why they bothered. Perhaps they thought that by understanding the cycles of the moon they would be able to harness it's power. Sixteen thousand years ago deep in a cave in Lascaux in France, a painter, whose expertise daunted even Picasso, daubed hunting scenes onto the rock walls. Those paintings include two sets of dots that are thought to represent lunar cycles. Again the effort to acquire this knowledge and then translate it into pictures must have been very considerable. Was it worth it? Did the cave painter believe he or she was working magic into the picture. Or was it just record, a calendar to remind them of the passing of the seasons, an image of the one thing in their lives that was certain, the monthly passage of the moon.\n\nBy seven thousand years ago lunacy had taken a very powerful hold on the mind of man. We begin to build megaliths that are positioned to reflect the moon's movements. Some of them are huge. At Locmariaquer in France there is a stone that has been shattered into four pieces. It once stood 20 meters high and weighed 280 tonnes. It had been put in place a thousand years before the comparatively puny 25 tonne rocks of Stonehenge. It stands at the centre of a complex of stone markers that is over twelve miles in diameter. The complex is aligned to mark the extremes of moonrise and moonset in the summer and winter. The data needed to build the complex would have taken hundreds of years to gather. And again the unanswered question is: why bother.\n\nBy 1500 BC in Mesopotamia Babylonian astrologers are keeping the most meticulous records of the moon's routine. The information is scientifically sound but was used for the purposes of prophecy. Since then mankind has given the moon many names, has given it male and female identities, has called it god in many languages and has ascribed fantastical magical powers to it.\n\nWe inhabitants of the 21st century have learnt a thing or two. We know that in reality the moon is a huge, almost inert and airless, rock. Getting there and living there is very difficult and impossibly expensive. Oddly this knowledge has not stopped us trying. The moon race in the 1960's was as time consuming and obsessive as anything undertaken by the people who erected the 280-ton monolith at Locmariaquer. A computer screen showing an analysis f the moon's orbit describes a pattern very similar to that drawn on the eagle's wing over thirty five thousand years ago and has a similar power to derange. It was not necessary to send men to the moon. The information could have been acquired using remotely controlled robot craft. Such an enterprise would have been infinitely easier and cheaper and of course, a lot less exciting.\n\nAt today's prices the USA spent $135 billion dollars on the Apollo programme. The astronauts bought back less than half a ton of moon rock at a cost of over $160 million dollars a pound. The moon had proved to be quite an expensive god. Now, in our lunar madness, we are going to take our revenge. We are enlisting the help of another god, Mammon. We are going to mine helium 3. The stakes are high. 1 tonne of helium 3 will be worth $4 billion. It is estimated that there is enough helium 3 on the moon to power the whole earth for 8,000 years. Helium three is easily mined, it is found in the lunar regolith, the dust that covers the moon's surface. All you have to do to get a tonne of the magic substance is heat a million tons of regolith to 800 degrees centigrade. India reckons to be on the moon by 2020, the Chinese are close behind. The arguments have started as to who owns the lunar real estate. We are poised to trash the object that has obsessed us for so long. The moon will become the next rain forest. Billions of dollars will be spent in the process. The surface will be scarred by strip mines. The moon's unique vacuum environment will be destroyed by the explosives used to excavate the regolith. Moon tourists will leave there polluting junk just as they now do in the Antarctic or on Everest. This will all be a great distraction to the people on earth who will still fight each other and find it impossible to mobilise the resources to give everybody clean drinking water.\n\nRick Stroud\nAutumn 2008\nReview: Fly Me To The Moon\n\nOn Stage with Buzz Aldrin\n\nEssay: Trashing the Moon\n\nWhy I wrote The Book of the Moon\n\nVideo: Man & the Moon\n\nIQ2 Space Festival\n\nMoon Magic - Great images of the Super Moon\n\nRifleman, A Front Line Life\nClick below to order your copy of The Book of the Moon.

The way in which information is stored is of no importance; all that matters is the information itself. It may be in the form of written words on paper, of varying magnetic fields, or patterns of electric charge. Men have used all these methods of storage, and many others. Suffice it to say that long ago they were able to store themselves - or, to be more precise, the disembodied patters from which they could be called back into existence.\n\n\"So much you already know. This is the way our ancestors gave us virtual immortality, yet avoided the problems raised by the abolition of death. A thousand years in one body is long enough for any man; at the end of that time, his mind is clogged with memories, and he only asks for rest - or a new beginning.\n\n\"In a little while, Alvin, I shall prepare to leave this life. I shall go back through my memories, editing them and canceling those I do not wish to keep. Then I shall walk into the Hall of Creation, but through a door you have never seen. This old body will cease to exist, and so will consciousness itself. Nothing will be left of Jeserac but a galaxy of electrons frozen in the heart of a crystal.\n\n\"I shall sleep, Alvin, and without dreams. Then one day, perhaps a hundred thousand years from now, I shall find myself in a new body, meeting those who have been chosen to be my guardians. They will look after me as Eriston and Etania have guided you, for at first I will know nothing of Diaspar and will have no memories of what I was before. Those memories will slowly return, at the end of my infancy, and I will build upon them as I move forward into my new cycle of existence.\n\n\"That is the pattern of our lives.

        "text":"Martian Ocean\n\nFrom Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe Martian Ocean is -- or was -- a result of the Great Flood. (But see Hindu version, below.)\n\nMartian ocean\n\nThe Martian Ocean as it appeared in antiquity.\n\nGod, having come to believe that He'd screwed up in creating mankind, decided to drown everyone. To do that He needed an immense amount of water, enough to raise sea level by maybe 4 or 5 kilometers. By chance He had stashed just the quantity he needed on nearby Mars, in the Martian Ocean.\n\nOk, it wasn't by chance. Being omniscient, He knew He'd want that water in order to wipe out land-living life on Earth. Why his omniscience didn't tell him that mankind would turn out badly is beyond the scope of this article. See instead Limitations of Superpowers as Applies to God.\n\nAt any rate, God simply evaporated the Martian Ocean and re-constituted it on Earth as the Noachic 40-day global rainstorm. Of course as we all know, after deciding He'd made a mistake and ought to wipe everyone out He flip-flopped again, and made up His mind (final answer) to save Noah and his immediate family. As a kind of ace-in-the-hole He also preserved all the diseases and parasites He might find useful for tormenting mankind later, as well as others of His favorite land animals. Left behind were dinosaurs, unicorns, dragons, mastodons, giant ground sloths, intelligent politicians, Godzilla, saber-toothed tigers, and other preposterous and impossible creatures.\n\nWhen He was done drowning things, God gradually evaporated the surplus water and returned it to Mars. Unfortunately, the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere of Mars caused the mighty rain thus created to escape into space, where it formed the tenuous rings around Jupiter.\n\nedit Nay nay, sayeth the Hindu\n\n\nShiva defeating cheese on Mars\n\nIn the Hindu view, the Martian Ocean came from the Nipple of Brahma, and was divine milk. By placing the Celestial Martian Ocean of Milk on Mars instead of Earth, Brahma hoped to keep Earthly poo from turning it to cheese. (This was a bad thing for reasons that will become clear later.) However Vishnu, egged on by Ganesh, snuck an exceptionally fertile cheddar culture onto an asteroid and crashed it into the Martian Ocean. (Vishnu likes to tease Brahma, and once put a decaying fish in his emblematic water-pot. It is said that after drinking Brahma gagged continuously for seven kalpas, which is 70 billion years.)\n\nOf course the cheddar bacterium spread rapidly through the sea of divine milk. Molecules of the cheese evaporated into space and the aroma caught the attention of the evil Bhodis of Ngathama, who reside on Saturn's moon Titan. These fiery 13-armed demons love cheese above all else.\n\nShiva resolved the problem of the burgeoning Martian cheese in a great battle of pasteurization, using his Trident of Whopping Destruction to destroy the cheese. This saved the inner planets from invasion by the Bhodis of Ngathama.\n\nHindus can point to a stone on the banks of the upper Ganges which they say is a fragment of the Martian cheese which escaped destruction and later immigrated to escape the rampant unemployment on Mars.\n\nedit Objections\n\nNow, the concupiscent reader will have noticed that the so-called Martian Ocean is actually not one of Earth's fourteen oceans. Not in a strictly factual sense. However, in both explanations the Martian Ocean is inextricably linked to Earth. In the Christian version the Ocean actually resided on Earth during the Great Flood, and in the Hindu version was changed to an earthly substance -- cheddar cheese -- from its original celestial form.\n\nTherefore in 1931 it was the international consensus that the Martian Ocean would henceforth be listed as one of Earth's fourteen oceans. This, of course, brought the count to fifteen.\n\nEarth's Oceans\nArctic Ocean ~ Indian Ocean ~ Martian Ocean ~ Mediterranean\nOcean Connery ~ Pacific Ocean ~ Russian Ocean\nPersonal tools",

        "text":"Penguin, penguin, penguin.\n\n[Previous chapter: The Polar Front]\n\nI held on to my camera in the Antarctic wind as the Zodiac approaches the land in front of me. A gigantic glacier, which ended abruptly as it touched the ocean, originated between two snowy hills embellished with stark rocks. The two ends of the glacier were pebble beaches, one of which formed a little cove, providing a natural landing site for the Greenwich Island.\n\nAs soon as I slid off the zodiac, I strode across the pebbles, which I found surprisingly sizable as I made my walk through them. They were of different shapes, some perfectly round and glassy, some appeared oblong, while some had sharp edges, rendering it somewhat difficult to navigate through. Nevertheless, I didn\u2019t let them slow me down, and stumbled towards my destination. My destination, of course, was not the colossal glacier that stood in front of me, but was a group of elegant creatures that haunted my dreams.\u00a0\n\nA small group of Gentoo Penguins manifested themselves on the pebble beach. I got closer and closer to them, and decided to sit down quietly, fearing I\u2019d disturb them if I didn\u2019t maintain some distance. My attempt to be noiseless was proven a failure. I almost set off a small pebble landslide when I lowered myself to the ground. The penguins didn\u2019t seem to care much. After observing me for a while, they were curious enough to slowly made their way to me. As they jumped from pebble to pebble, their black and white body blended perfectly with the bright blue glacier. I raised my camera clumsily and started to take pictures.\u00a0\n\nI lingered in front of these penguins for an hour before realizing that it was time to return to the Zodiac. I unwillingly abandoned them and headed towards the Zodiac. I\u2019d soon find out that it was probably foolish to spend so much time among five or six penguins, but I\u2019d never find a scene as breathtaking and serene as this place.\u00a0\n\nIt was not the first time that I saw penguins in the wild. Even though they are generally south hemisphere seabirds, only two species of penguins are true Antarctic creatures. Other species of penguins can be found in countries like South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. The Galapagos Penguins are even distributed north of the Equator.\n\nThree month prior to my departure to Antarctica, I\u2019d seen my first species of penguins, Magellanic Penguins, at Peninsula Valdes in Argentina. It didn\u2019t spark much of an emotional reaction when I actually saw a colony of Magellanic Penguins in proximity. To my disappointment, they were already accustomed to visitors and cameras, and some of them even lied on the trail. A probably more important reason was the environment that these penguins were living in \u2013 the weather was dry and warm. It was incongruent to my stereotypical image of where penguins ought to live in. There was just something so compelling about the combination of penguins and a remote, icy world like Antarctica.\n\nThe Zodiac came to another side of the Greenwich Island called Fort Point as I mulled over my first encounter with antarctic penguins. I couldn\u2019t help but grinned when I saw hundreds of penguins on shore. I started to hear the deafening sound of penguin calls. Later I\u2019d learn that penguins are vocal creatures, which allows penguins to identify each other among thousands of similar individuals. I also started to smell the strong and abysmal scent of penguin guano, a scent that I\u2019d get very familiar with for the following few days. I hopped on shore with exuberance and was immediately amazed by the sheer amount of penguins breeding at this place. In order to minimize human disturbance, a parameter were set up in front of the borders of the colony to maintain a reasonable distance from the sensitive penguins. The man in charge of this precaution is Fabrice, a French ornithologist that would earn my respect and admiration during the voyage.\n\nFabrice was a passionate and silver-haired frenchman who speaks English with a thick French accent. His adventurous spirit and lively manner while being in the wild belied his ages. His earliest experience with the polar region dated back to 1989, when he studied the breeding behavior of blue petrel at the Kerguelen Islands, a remote French subantarctic territory. Three years later, he\u2019d begin to work as a field guide and a lecturer in expeditions to the polar regions. He\u2019d still wear the same red coat (also a Personal Floating Device) up to this day, only to find it severely bleached by sunlight and covered by dirt. \u201cYou know, it still floats on water.\u201d he explained to us when being asked about it, while sitting on the Yamaha engine of the Zodiac and resting his hand on the direction controller.\n\nAfter working as a polar guide season after season, he\u2019d develop a predilection towards penguins. \u201cYou can find me where the penguins are,\u201d he told me with a big smile on his face at the lunch table, \u201cI like penguins.\u201d That was very true. Whenever we had a landing, I\u2019d always find him standing in front of a penguin colony and looking at the penguins. When people came up to him bearing different questions, he\u2019d always humbly answer them with patience. From my interactions with him, never did he not have a satisfying answer to my questions about birds: it was from him that I learned that when a penguin returns to its nest from the ocean, it vocalizes so that it and its partner could identify each other.\n\nBack to Fort Point, Greenwich Island, Fabrice found two Macaroni penguins among the Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins. I heard the news and hurried to the frontier of the parameter to spot them myself\u2014after all a Macaroni penguin was not a guarantee on this expedition. I looked through my binoculars in hopes of finding the pair of Macaroni penguins, and I did manage to espy them with relatively ease. Their golden forehead, which continued as a tuft, stood out among the black and white Chinstrap penguins around them. They were about one meter apart\u2014the female was incubating on their nest while the male resting on a higher rock. Later I\u2019d come to know that their baby (or babies) probably won\u2019t make it through the first year because they won\u2019t have enough time to become strong when it\u2019s time for them to leave the breeding site. The fate of the progeny of these two penguins was uncertain and unfavorable, and I wondered if they realized that themselves.\n\nThe same rule applies to the Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins. For the ones that were still incubating their eggs, their progeny probably won\u2019t survive the first year.\u00a0\n\nFor the majority of the penguins on the Greenwich Island, on the other hand, their chicks were already several weeks old. These chicks would rely on extensive parental care before coming together with other chicks. Therefore, this is the most sensitive time of their lives as they require one of their parents around them at all times. The other parent would be at sea and hunt for krill and fish in order to fill their body with food. According to Fabrice, a penguin that weighs 6 kilograms usually carries up to 1 kilogram of food, which appears to me as an impressive feat. The penguin would then return to its nest and feed its babies with cud.\u00a0\n\nI stood with awe in front of the hundreds of penguins in front of me while Fabrice talked about how penguins breed. As a bird watcher, I probably spent too much time learning how to identify one species of bird, but I did not understand why these species are the way they are, and how they manage to thrive. Learning about penguins, I was amazed by all the details that I was oblivious to.\n\nI ambled around, and noticed a juvenile penguin chasing around its parent, asking for food. Poor penguin! With an empty stomach, the parent could do nothing but to wait for its partner\u2019s return. Hopefully, by the end of the breeding season, the small penguin could be chubby as a balloon, and ready for its first winter.\n\nMy one-hour staying time on Greenwich Island quickly elapsed, and once again, I found myself reluctant to leave this smelly, noisy, yet amazing little world. The wind started to pick up, so I held on firmly to the safety rope at the side of the Zodiac, and watched the colony become tinier and tinier, until I could only see a giant dark patch on the shore.\n\n[Next chapter: Of Penguin and Men]\n\nOne thought on \u201cPenguin, penguin, penguin.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.
