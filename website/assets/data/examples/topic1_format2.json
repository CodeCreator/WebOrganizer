ANOTHER ONE OF THESE, YES.\n\nThis went through a revival.. I drew an older version of this story, but never found the time to post it up on DeviantArt (This was before the site was made).. and so much time passed that I forgot about it to the point that the comic became outdated and if I wanted to post it, I would have to draw it all over again. Well.. here it is! I\u2019ll probably post the original comic in the future.. once I get some extras section. Filled with other goodies.\n\nThe third panel of this comic was absolute murder. You know those times you\u2019re drawing and you just CANNOT get it right.. even after much-needed erasing and redoing? Yeah.. that was a plane crash all over.. oh well. I think it\u2019s just the hair looking so FLAT. Also I should practice at more adult, elderly faces.. more wrinkly. This keeps reminding me of the artist for Pokemon Adventures.. except his old characters don\u2019t look as bloody weird. They look quite \u201cchibi\u201d.. but tastefully so. It\u2019s weird!\n\nI\u2019m getting progressively better at Tess. I was looking at old comics and noticed how much of an ABOMINATION she looked.. she\u2019s improving.. as are everyone else.

        "text":"May 2017\n\n- \" A Short Song on every Path...\" -\n\n\nFor a long time, I had thought that the tall birch tree between Hamfelde and Basthorst, two villages near Hamburg, would be a good a motif for me. With its lively branches dancing in the wind, this tree drew my attention whenever I passed it. On a nice day in May I painted it and then visited my friend Ute in Reinbek.\n\nLike in old student days in Berlin, prints by Gauguin, van Gogh and Paula Modersohn-Becker adorn her walls today. She loves art, literature and France as I love painting, writing and traveling through the world. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to show me your new painting?\" Ute asked whilst we sat at the beautifully laid table in her garden. Looking at my sketch book, her eyes glowed in a familiar way: \u201cAh yes, you always liked trees! I can remember exactly the big palm that you painted in our shared flat next to your tiled stove \u2013 from the floor to the ceiling.\u201d \u2013 Flashback! There it was again in front of me, my old room with the palm, the large bay windows, my hammock across the room, the many green plants, my two zebra finches, the antique desk and a certain postcard on the wall above it.\n\n\u201cYes, I remember \u2013 and now, finally, I know why I painted this birch tree!\u201d \u2013 Ute looked at me in surprise. \u201cYou still know my uncle Ernst, don\u2019t you?\u201d I began. \u201cHe taught me a vagabond song, when I was 6 or 7 years old, which I have never forgotten. And do you remember the postcard on my wall at that time, the one with the two old men under a birch tree? I bought it for myself in my first semester at university because it reminded me of this song. Yes, and when I painted this birch now, it is definitely a throwback to the postcard from way back then. A subconscious chain of association, so to speak!\u201d Ute\u2019s cheeks revealed a dimple from the left and right. \u201cYou cannot be serious,\u201d she laughed. \u201cYou've just made that up.\u201d I shrugged, put on an \u2018everything-is-possible\u2019 look \u2013 and then gave in. \u201cYes, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it\u2019s somehow musical, my birch tree.\u201d And then I spontaneously sang my uncle\u2019s unforgotten song to her.\n\n\n> order magnetic bookmark motif\u00a0 ' My birch tree '",

        "text":"Salamander Knight Picture\n\nThis is a fan art about Japanese manga\/anime Saint Seiya drawn by Masami Kurumada. My version is very different. The story happens in Greek mythological era. When the Olympian gods fought the Titans, each god formed an army of knights. Hephaestus created all the armors for them. Athena only had 48 knights (according to the number of ancient constellations). When the war ended, half of Athena's army was dead. The survivors became rogue knights because their service was no longer required. Just like the original Greek version, Athena chose to mingle with other gods on mount Olympus - leaving humans at the mercy of mischievous gods and dangerous monsters. Each ex-Athena's knight then handed down their armor and power to their descendants or relatives. Although the war against the titans had ended, people still needed savior because sometimes Olympian gods caused havoc. Hence, the knights were still in business of saving lives.\n\nKorax is my original character. He is one of Poseidon's 7 generals. When Triton's All-Seeing Pearl was stolen, Poseidon sent Korax to help Triton retrieve it. Such treasure mustn't have fallen to the wrong hands because it could give the owner the ability to see and change the future as well. Korax' only lead was a boat used the thief. Although Triton was so sure that the thief was Andromeda Knight's - Ouranos - father, Korax had different conclusion. While Andromeda, aided by Cygnus, battled Triton, Korax spotted Zestos - Phoenix Knight. Korax confronted Zestos but failed to capture him.\n\nOfficially, in Saint Seiya universe, the armor of this knight is called Lymnades. Problem is Lymnades is aquatic fairy but the armor itself has salamander shape. Thus, the name and the shape contradict each other. Therefore, I chose to name him Salamander Knight, rather than Lymnades Knight.\n\nContinue Reading:",

        "text":"The yellow story\n\nChapter 4: part 1: CHOREOGRAPHY\nby Daria Lanz\n\nI was taking a much-needed getaway up to Scotland for a couple days. I\u2019d never been before, which is sad considering I\u2019ve been in London over 2 years now, and my family history is rooted\u00a0up there. Regardless, I was finally there, and on the first night my flatmate and I were happily wandering through the streets of Edinburgh, when we came across a pub with live celtic music.\n\nI fucking LOVE celtic music. Especially live.\n\nEarlier in the day we\u2019d found a fantastic soup shop run by a lovely group of volunteers. Their food was all home-made, vegan, and heart-warming. It was cooked from would-be-food-waste from local shops. And the kicker (if that wasn\u2019t already enough)? It was pay what you want.\n\n\nWe ate, we chatted, we paid abundantly. And with our stomachs full and our hearts warm, we left after lunch and wandered through the city, up Arthur\u2019s chair, and back down the streets again until we stumbled upon this pub. It was dusk, and we weren\u2019t quite hungry for dinner yet.\n\nInside was crowded, loud, and buzzing. There was a long table at the front where 9 or so musicians sat playing their tunes. At least 5 violins, a piper, guitarist, and a few other celtic instruments. It was wild, and my Scottish blood was dancing. We ordered a bottle of wine and squeezed ourselves in amongst the many other musical admirers right in the front row.\n\nWe drank the entire bottle. And we stayed until the music stopped. It was the most fun I\u2019ve had in ages. The rhythms, the violins, the pipes, the dancing. It brought me back to my highland dancing days when I was younger. There is just something about this music that gets me going, from the inside out. It boils up from my heart and explodes over the brim, pouring through my entire body, head to toes. It makes me want to jump and dance and sing with laughter and joy.\n\n\nIn the front row, we had our eyes on one particular violinist. She was exquisite. I was mesmerized by how fast her fingers were flying on the strings. I was watching the patterns she knew so engrained in her muscle memory, and it sparked a thought \u2013 a connection. It made me think that choreography is just a visual pattern of a different sort. As a dancer, a musician, a painter \u2013 we practice and memorize certain muscle patterns to perform our dance, music, art. It made me think about Heather Hanson\u2019s beautiful charcoal dancing canvases \u2013 where she dances on a large paper with charcoal in her hands and feet, capturing her choreography in a visual artefact.\n\nI wanted to do the same, but I wanted to play with light.\n\nAnd so there I had my next word, my next chapter for this yellow story:\u00a0choreography\n\nAfter returning home, I strapped some laser lights to my hands and feet, and proceed to dance as many styles as I could in front of a long-exposure camera.\n\nI sent Elise the photos, each labelled with a post-it of the type of dance they represented:\n\nHip Hop\n\nAll dancing styles I have danced at some point in my life. Some better than others, but all with as much heart. It will be interesting to see how she interpreted the post-it labels, whether she was able to decipher their dancing meaning.\n\nPrevious \u2018yellow story\u2019 chapter\n\nPrevious post\n\nNext \u2018yellow story\u2019 chapter\n\nNext post",

        "text":"A growing desert\n\nIn the summer of 2014, photographer Jacqueline\u00a0Zilberberg and writer Liliana Lara, both from Venezuela, met in Israel to collaborate on a project which combines images and words from the vision of those coming from afar. In this project, the protagonist is the desert.\n\nA stone desert, free from the continuous movement of the sands.\n\nThis is the desert of Judea, on the way to the Dead Sea, in Israel. In this desert, changes take centuries to perform. The wind incessantly gnaws the stones until they are crested. You can even feel the texture\u2019s static and lumpy form. And still, the desert expands, not only as an ecological catastrophe but as a Nietzsche kind of void. \u201cPoor is he, who harbors the desert inside.\u201d\n\nThese are the images of what we saw in this desert.\n\nWhat first hit us was the aridity.\n\nBecause we come from tropical greenery, with abundance of water and bustle, this silence shuddered us.\n\nWe wish to show the meaning of this dried and colorless, open and never ending place, for somebody who grew in a jungle landscape.\n\nIn this desert there are trees, but they are growing artificially, with the help of waters brought from afar through long pipes. Other trees grow naturally, with stubbornness, waiting in the heat of death for a minuscule raindrop through the seasons.\n\nThis is not an inhabited desert. Humans left their mark through their buildings, their electric wires hanging over the winding roads, and their plowing and sowing at any cost.\n\nThe Judean desert is a seabed, and we walk the depth of this extinct, millennial and condensed sea. At the lowest and saltiest place on earth, what remains of this sea has been turned into spas and hotels, where cautious ladies bathe, soaking their bodies, wearing their plastic bathing caps.\n\nParadoxically, the sea of death serves as a therapeutic bath.\n\nWhile looking at this Mexican cactus, completely detached from the surrounding nature, you can feel the artificiality of tourism, of the travelers, and of the beholder with estranged eyes.",

Oh, you must sketch my portrait! I insist.\u201d\n\nSo Picasso agreed to sketch her. After studying her for a moment, he used a single pencil stroke to create her portrait. He handed the women his work of art.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect!\u201d she gushed. \u201cYou managed to capture my essence with one stroke, in one moment. Thank you! How much do I owe you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive thousand dollars,\u201d the artist replied.\n\n\u201cB-b-but, what?\u201d the woman sputtered. \u201cHow could you want so much money for this picture?

        "text":"On the Subject of Couples\n\n\"You have to promise not to laugh.\"\n\n\"I won't laugh,\" he offers quickly, almost before I finish my sentence.\n\nAs I begin to pull the small package from my bag, he notices the work's current form.\n\n\"You framed it?\"\n\nThe surprise in his voice is unanticipated. I explain that the frame is a part of the piece.\n\n\"You ready?\"\n\nI lift the small black frame from my bag and place it gently on the table. He inspects the image. His response is rapid, unexpectedly flattering.\n\n\"That's nice. What's wrong with it?\"\n\nThe question is understandable. I'd introduced the photo with details of what I'd affectionately dubbed \"hell shoot.\" Anything that could go wrong mechanically\/technically during the photo session did, and what was before him represented an attempt to salvage some part of the work.\n\nI explain that nothing is wrong with the image per se and that it's \"hazy\" on purpose.\n\n\"It's cool,\" he continues as he pulls the frame toward him. \"Hey, that's nice.\" There's a beat before he adds: \"You look so angry.\" He shifts, studies the image. \"Well, I mean . . . What's wrong with it, though?\"\n\nThis time, I suspect the question has to do with my mentioning that I had thought of reconceptualizing the project.\n\n\"Nothing is 'wrong' with the photo,\" I tell him.\n\nI'd set this meeting because I wanted his input. I knew what I read in the image, but where couples were concerned, I suddenly felt I couldn't trust my judgment. Having never been a part of one, I felt completely out of my element.\n\n\"I guess that shirt's not all that bad-looking,\" he says.\n\nIt's a comment related to the shoot. We'd worn matching shirts, and though the one I'd given him was a large, it fit more snugly about his chest and shoulders than I'd anticipated. He'd remarked shortly after donning it that he thought he looked like a \"dork.\"\n\nI go over some of the technical aspects of the creation, then inform him, \"It was the one image . . . There was something about it . . . When I looked at it, it became about two other people. What do you get from the image?\"\n\n\"I dunno. It's difficult to say, you know, because I'm looking at myself.\"\n\nI ask if he can not see himself.\n\n\"I'm too wrapped up in myself to do that,\" he tells me. \"I look fuckin' great!\"\n\nThere's no mistaking his intended humor. Laughter rises from deep within each of us. Then his tone returns to serious.\n\n\"I'm not sure what you were trying to do, but what I'm getting out of it is . . . I mean, you get a feeling that it is . . . I'm looking . . . I can become like . . . two other people. Are you telling me . . . I'm not quite sure . . . I could probably get like a challenging look out of it, kinda like a confrontational thing . . . But it's kinda weird, because it's such a soft photograph. Maybe you could also get like some other kinda like softer emotions, romantic emotions. I dunno . . .\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'confrontational'?\" I ask.\n\nThere's no hesitation before he says, \"I mean, we both look pissed. That's part of it.\"\n\n\"You think you look pissed?\"\n\n\"You also have this look on your face like, you know - let's say that this isn't us - like, 'What am I doing with this moron?' You know?\"\n\n\"What am I doing with this moron?\" I parrot. It's my turn for surprise.\n\n\"Or, I dunno, 'Look what I settled for.' Or something like that.\"\n\n\"So there's an indifference . . .\"\n\n\"'Cause your head's kinda tilted,\" he interrupts. \"There seems to be sort of an indifference in there. But I seem to be . . . This guy appears to be just glaring.\"\n\nI suggest that since the meeting place is so dark, he might want to re-examine the image under the light. He does.\n\n\"I mean, this is also kinda weird. Both of my arms are around you, and you don't know where your hands are at, so it looks like I'm . . . protecting you or something. And you don't have . . . Your face doesn't say 'Protect me' or 'I need this' or 'I feel,' you know what I'm saying? So that's weird.\"\n\nI explain that my \"couple-ese\" is weak. It's one of the reasons I'm pursuing this particular proj-ect. Couples - how they're constructed, how they function, why some work, why some don't - fascinate me.\n\n\"This could be a Benetton ad,\" he says.\n\nLaughter visits once more.\n\n\"What makes you say that?\"\n\n\"Their whole . . . themes of race and stuff like that. You know.\"\n\n\"But it's in black and white.\"\n\nMy eyes fall toward the image. He stares at me from the frame, blond hair, blue eyes, arms wrapped about me. The delicacy of the printing lessens the difference in our respective skin tones.\n\nBenetton's approach is light-years away. Very colorful, very \"rainbow coalition.\" The phrase \"black skin as art direction\" pops into my head. I begin to resent the connection he's formed between my work in this instance and Benetton's advertising, primarily because of Benetton's insensitivity. It's an insensitivity I project onto him. There's a moment before I soften, realizing the unfairness of the projection.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess it's obvious with this hair, I'm not exactly Scandinavian.\"\n\n\"I . . . I could be from Scandinavia, though. My name could be 'Bjorn' or something . . .\"\n\nHis attention drifts back to the small image sandwiched between glass.\n\n\"I think the most interesting thing is, now that I'm looking at it, the most interesting thing is that my arms are around you . . . Because that gives it . . . that sets up this kinda . . . I mean, the eyes are confronting the looker, the person looking at this thing, you know, and I'm getting from that . . . I'm getting confrontation from that. You know. I'm getting 'Challenge this. Challenge this, I dare you' - that kinda thing. That's what I'm saying.\n\n\"But then,\" he continues, \"when I see . . . That's totally undercut by the fact that my arms are around you, kinda like shielding or protecting you, 'cause that opens up a relationship between the two people which I'm not expecting either. It . . . From the hard glare I'm not gonna expect . . . Not glare, but from the hard look from like me and you in the photograph that I'm getting, or, at least, I dunno if it's a look of indifference or a look of just like . . .\"\n\nHe stops and ponders the image once more.\n\n\"Or maybe I'm looking at it all wrong. Maybe you do look vulnerable. I can't tell now.\"\n\nSponsor Content",
