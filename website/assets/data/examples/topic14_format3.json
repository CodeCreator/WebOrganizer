It is a privilege to serve and care for each of them.\n\nWe help families understand their options and answer their questions during the decision-making phase. Once a resident and family determine we are the right fit, we strive to be just as helpful in the move-in transition.\n\nYou can expect changes no matter if preparing for a nursing home short-term stay or moving into a retirement community. Whether the resident requires much assistance, the family lives out of town or there's still a high level of anxiety, we are experienced in just about every scenario and are prepared to help make you or your loved one feel at home as soon as possible.\n\nOur Welcome Home Preparation\n\nUnlike preparing for a nursing home (\"skilled nursing facility\"), Country Meadows of Hershey offers a range of care levels and amenities. As such, we have multiple teams and resources to accommodate residents. Here's what you can expect upon choosing us:\n\nBefore moving in\nThe family and resident (if able) will\n\n  \u2022 Review and sign a resident agreement\n  \u2022 Determine a move-in date\n    (if needed, we can assist in finding moving professionals)\n  \u2022 Supply detailed information about the resident's preferences, needs and goals to acquaint and help our staff support the resident to be as independent and active as he or she chooses. This information is added to the overall care plan for us to monitor and be aware of any family concerns.\n  \u2022 Collaborate with the marketing team to coordinate a physician's visit within the required time and obtain the necessary paperwork\n  \u2022 (In person or via phone if the family is not local)\u00a0 Conduct a pre-move-in meeting with our team to review transition details including daily routines, care and medication(s). This gives the family a chance to know the team who will be supporting their loved one and share any requests or concerns prior to moving in.\n\nUpon moving in\nThe resident is\n\n  \u2022 Welcomed by an appointed Ambassador to introduce him or her to new neighbors, show the resident around, answer any questions, choose preferred activities, provide any one-on-one support that day and proudly be that \"first friend\" the resident surely will be glad to see thereafter\n  \u2022 Introduced to his or her dining companions by the management team\n  \u2022 Invited by dining or community life teams to join resident-led committees\n  \u2022 Visited by our Hershey department directors in dining, fitness, community life and chaplaincy\n\nAfter moving in\nThe resident\n\n  \u2022 Is welcome to invite friends and family as his or her guests to events, activities and meals\n  \u2022 Attends monthly fireside chats with our Hershey management team to learn of community updates and news, ask any questions or voice concerns\n\nWhile these are scheduled monthly forums, residents are welcome and invited to approach and talk to our staff, including management, at any time\n\n  \u2022 Is encouraged to participate in one or more programs that support fellow residents or members of our local community\n\nAfter the last personal item is unpacked and change of address cards mailed, we hope new residents quickly feel at home. Because after all, it is their home.\n\nOur residents are proud of their home and would enjoy showing it to you. Contact us to set up a personalized visit for any day of the week. We look forward to welcoming you.\u00a0\n\nHershey Tabs - Photos\n\nCountry Meadows of Hershey Country Meadows of Hershey Country Meadows of Hershey Country Meadows of Hershey Country Meadows of Hershey Country Meadows of Hershey\n\nHershey Tabs - Menu Sampling\n\nOur dining team prepares a variety of healthy, freshly made meals daily.

It is important to distinguish what is a City Ordinance complaint vs an HOA complaint and contact the appropriate parties. \u00a0Examples of such will be listed below. \u00a0Do not expect the HOA to take on a city ordinance issue on your behalf. \u00a0It is your responsibility to call the Mayors Action Line to report and followup on any city ordinance violation.\n\nExamples of City Ordinance Violations: Call 918-596-2100\n\n1. Yard and Structure Maintenance including:\n\nTall Grass (12 inches)\nTrash, Junk, Debris in yard or on curb\nStagnant Swimming Pools\nBroken Windows\nStructure in need of repair\nTarps on roof, cave in, etc\nDead Trees that pose a safety risk\n\n2.) Road Maintenance of Any Kind\n\n3.) Graffiti\n\n4.)Abandoned, Disabled, or Illegally parked cars\n\nCars parked in yard\nCommercial Vehicles such as Box Trucks\n\n5.) Barking Dogs\n\nWhen to call the HOA \u2013\n\nFor any issue specifically listed in the covenants for your section of the neighborhood after you have discussed with the neighbor in question with no resolution. \u00a0The preferred method of communication is via e-mail as our volunteers may have other work and family obligations that you could be interrupting when you call. \u00a0Please be respectful of their time and remember your dues are not paying for your access to them, their time is generously given to the HOA.\n\nThank you for your consideration;",

        "text":"Home > Housing > Empty Homes > Report Empty Homes\n\nReport Empty Homes\n\n\nMaking the best use of existing homes is one of our key objectives.\n\nThere is a shortage of residential accommodation available as housing demand outstrips housing supply quite significantly.\u00a0It is essential to ensure that empty homes do not remain empty unnecessarily and fall into misuse and dereliction.\n\nReport an empty home\u00a0\n\nWe can offer support and assistance to empty home owners to help them bring their property back in to use, or we can use enforcement action to bring the properties in to use. \u00a0\n\nWhy properties become or remain empty\n\nIn most cases this is because the owners need assistance, support, information, or encouragement to help return empty homes to use. Although there are numerous other reasons that properties remain empty including:\n\n  \u2022 Financial implications.\n  \u2022 Requires renovation and\/or building work.\n  \u2022 Reluctance to let\/sell.\n  \u2022 Health issues.\n  \u2022 Probate, estate or legal ownership issues.\n  \u2022 Lack of awareness of support options.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive, and the reasons can vary in severity. It is important, therefore, that we are able to give the appropriate level of support to those who need it.\n\n\nImpact of an empty home\n\nEach empty home denies a household somewhere to live and returning an empty home to use has social, environmental and financial benefits. If left empty properties can:\n\n  \u2022 Fall into disrepair, or become ruinous or dilapidated.\n  \u2022 Attract vandalism, antisocial behaviour and crime.\n  \u2022 Cause damage to adjacent properties, and possibly health issues for neighbours through lack of maintenance.\n  \u2022 Pose a threat to safety, particularly to young children.\n  \u2022 Reduce the value of the surrounding area as well as themselves.\n\nAgain this list is not exhaustive, empty homes can create a great deal of problems not only for the owners but for those situated in the surrounding areas.\n\nBenefits of bringing an empty home back into use\n\nBringing an empty home back into use has a number of benefits, these include:\n\n  \u2022 Generating potential income for the owner, and increasing property value.\n  \u2022 Reducing the risk of crime and vandalism for the property, and the local area.\n  \u2022 Providing accommodation for others to use.\n  \u2022 Contributing to the regeneration of an area, increasing spending in the local economy, and helping to protect the value of the surrounding area.\n\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe can offer a range of services to give the best support and advice possible to empty homes owners and neighbours, we can:\n\n  \u2022 Offer informal advice and assistance.\n  \u2022 Offer financial assistance to owners.\n  \u2022 Offer to buy empty homes from the owners.\n  \u2022 Offer to refer to town hall lettings the councils not for profit letting agent\n  \u2022 Offer to find suitable companies to do works for owners.\n\nIn some circumstances we may consider to use enforcement action these could be:\n\n  \u2022 Deal with dangerous, derelict, and ruinous buildings through enforcement notices.\n  \u2022 Serve improvement notices in order to remove hazards.\n  \u2022 Take over the management of the property by using an empty dwelling management order or EDMO\n  \u2022 Undertake Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPO) when it is in the public interest, as a last resort.\n\nWe are eager to help empty home owners as much as possible, whilst avoiding enforcement actions.\n\n\nContact our Private Sector Housing Team for advice and support - contact us.",

If you cannot find one, remember the dog may have a microchip. If at all possible, take the dog to a local vet clinic or to Animal Control to have it scanned for a microchip, which will contain owner information.\n\nIf you are unable to locate owner information, please call your local Animal Control to file a \u201cfound animal\u201d report.\nStafford Animal Control: 540-658-7387\nIf it is after-hours, call the non-emergency number for Stafford County Sheriff\u2019s Office:\u00a0540-658-4400. But follow up with a call directly to Animal Control the next morning.\nIf at all possible, it is ideal to keep the dog in your home for the first day instead of surrendering to Animal Control. Animal Control often operates at capacity, and surrendering there might put another dog at risk for euthanasia if they run out of space.\n\nWe at the Stafford SPCA are rarely able to take in strays because we usually operate at capacity.\nCall us to file a found animal report, and to see if we have a lost report that may match.

        "text":"Self Build & Custom Housebuilding Register\n\nSelf build housing refers to an individual, or group of individuals, directly organising the design and construction of their own homes. Custom build usually means an individual working with a specialist developer to construct your home. For either option, a serviced plot with vehicular access needs to be available on which to construct the dwelling. A plot could be on its own or part of a larger scheme.\n\nThe provision of self build and custom house building plots is\u00a0supported through\u00a0Policy H1 \u201cHousing Mix: Market Housing\u201d of the adopted Hart Local Plan 2032.\n\nThe Council is required to keep a register of individuals and associations of individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in Hart. Joining the Register is by application and a number of eligibility criteria must be met.\n\nThe Register is divided into two parts:\n\nPart 1 \u2013 comprises local demand for plots. If you want to be entered onto Part 1 of the Register all the eligibility criteria must be met including a local connection test.\n\nPart 2 \u2013 comprises general demand for plots.\u00a0Eligibility criteria must be met except the local connection test.\n\nThe local demand on Part 1 of the Register informs the number of serviced plots that we should be providing in Hart.\n\n\nYou can apply for entry to Part 1 of the register if you:\n\n  \u2022 Are\u00a0aged 18 or over\n\n  \u2022 Are\u00a0a British citizen, a national of an European Economic Area State other than the UK, or a national of Switzerland\n\n  \u2022 Satisfy\u00a0our local eligibility criteria\n\n  \u2022 Have paid the relevant fee required to enter or remain on the register\n\n  \u2022 Are\u00a0seeking (alone or with others) to acquire a serviced pot of land in the Council\u2019s area for\u00a0your own self build and custom housebuilding\n\nA group of individuals who wish to register as an association must appoint an individual to act as the lead contact. An association is eligible for entry to Part 1 if each member meets all of the above requirements.\n\nCriteria for the local connection test and financial resources test are contained in the Eligibility Conditions Guidance Note.\n\nEntry on the Register does not guarantee an allocation of a plot as these are predominantly provided by the private sector.\n\nHow\u00a0to apply\n\nIf you would like to be placed on the Self Build and Custom Housebuilding Register please complete the Self Build and Custom Housebuilding Register application form. Once you have been notified that\u00a0your application has been successful, the appropriate fee should also be paid using one of the methods stated below, in order to enter and remain on the register.\n\n\nAn\u00a0annual fee is payable for an individual or association of individuals to join the register. The fee is payable within 28 days of being notified that\u00a0your application has been successful.\n\nThereafter an annual fee will be payable to remain on the register during the subsequent 31 October \u2013 30 October period.\n\nThe annual fees are shown in the table below:\n\nType of fee\n\n\n\nInclusion fee - Part 1\n\n\n\nInclusion fee - Part 2\n\n\n\nAnnual fee - Part 1\n\n\n\nAnnual fee - Part 2\n\n\n\n*Includes applications from a couple or 2 or more members of one household, but each member must meet the local connection test to be entered onto Part 1 of the Register.\n\nThe Council is entitled to refuse entry onto the Register until the\u00a0fee is paid, or not paid within the stated time period. Once a fee is paid it cannot be refunded.\n\nOn the register\n\nOnce you are on the Register we may contact you from time to time with updates about the self build and custom housebuilding initiative, including providing details of serviced plots which are granted planning permission.\n\nThe Register will not be a public document, but we will publish headline data\u00a0annually,\u00a0such as number of plots required by location.\n\nFor more\u00a0helpful resources on self build and custom housebuilding view our\u00a0information guide.\n\nIf you have any queries about the self build and custom housebuilding register, if your details or circumstances change, or you wish to be removed from the register, please contact:\n\n\nPhone: 01252 774118",
