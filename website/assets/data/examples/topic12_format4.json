        "text":"Man Appears Free of HIV After Stem Cell Transplant\n\nJacquelyne Froeber writes on CNN:\n\nA 42-year-old HIV patient with leukemia appears to have no detectable HIV in his blood and no symptoms after a stem cell transplant from a donor carrying a gene mutation that confers natural resistance to the virus that causes AIDS, according to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe patient is fine,\u201d said Dr. Gero Hutter of Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin in Germany. \u201cToday, two years after his transplantation, he is still without any signs of HIV disease and without antiretroviral medication.\u201d\n\nThe case was first reported in November, and the new report is the first official publication of the case in a medical journal. Hutter and a team of medical professionals performed the stem cell transplant on the patient, an American living in Germany, to treat the man\u2019s leukemia, not the HIV itself.\n\nHowever, the team deliberately chose a compatible donor who has a naturally occurring gene mutation that confers resistance to HIV. The mutation cripples a receptor known as CCR5, which is normally found on the surface of T cells, the type of immune system cells attacked by HIV.\n\nRead More: CNN\n\n  \u2022 fabian_ramos\n\n    say what? ha, stem cells. amazing\n\n    Germany, i here is pretty cool. not just col\n\n  \u2022 tony\n\n    A little research will reveal that HIV does not cause AIDS, so this story is a fizzle\u2026\n\n    \u2022 I'll bite\n\n      @Tony: wow, you're the greatest troll ever.

The definition of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is this (according to the Mayo clinic): \u201cAIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the final and most serious stage of HIV disease, which causes severe damage to the immune system.\u201d Essentially, the end stage of HIV is called AIDS.\n\n          You don't know anything, so stop pretending to.\n\n    \u2022 dumbsaint\n\n      Even if this was the case, why exactly is curing HIV alone remotely 'a fizzle'?\n\n  \u2022 Sean\n\n    more proof that the faith lobby is turning us into a medical 3rd world country\n\n    \u2022 dumbsaint\n\n      Seriously.

Talia862\n\n    Talia862 Well-Known Member\n\n    I\"m having an awful night. I have bipolar, and the doctor put me on steriods, which always mess up my meds. I have been in the grip of horrible despair for a week. I was staying over at my parents, and they were very supportive. Now i\"m home and struggling on my own with suicidal feelings. It is the middle of the night and no one is around to talk to. I feel sick from the new Rheumatoid arthritis med that the doc put me on and wasn't able to eat with my geadon which means it won't work. I am in the deepest darkest depression I have ever been in. I know its mostly chemical and will hopefully get better as soon as my meds get back to normal, but it seems timeless when I'm in it.\n\n    Id give up, but I just have the best friends in the world. I love them so much. I love them too much to hurt them. I keep wanting to believe they would not be hurt by my death but deep down I know that isnt'; true. They would be very hurt Right? They would, right? I mean, losing a friend to suicide would be really hard for them.\n\n    My counselor told me that I need to remember I won't ALWAYS feel this way but its so hard.\n\n    Would be grateful for any advice or kind words.\n  2. Petal\n\n    Petal SF dreamer Staff Member Safety & Support SF Supporter\n\n    I also sometimes have to take steroids (deltacortril), (entocort) and they sky rocket my anxiety so I can understand that aspect, just wanted to let you know I read your post and your therapist is a wise woman\/man. You won't always feel this way. Thoughts change,life changes and all we can hope for is for the better :) Try and remain strong and calm, the storm will pass!

Trivial: Inconsequential. Having no consequences. Causing no medical condition.\n    2. Minor: Usually denoted by bleeding. Some degree of first aid, a bandage, scrubbing with antiseptic could\/should\/would have been used. You may have consulted a medical professional such as poison control for advice.\n    3. Moderate: A vital sign, pulse rate, respirations or blood pressure was affected. First aid was required and a follow up by a medical professional, an ER visit, would have been indicated - whether this was done or not. Typically includes a bite that penetrated the skin by an unknown species of snake or spider. Human bites that break the skin go here. Hospitalization may be indicated\/advised.\n    4. Major: More than one vital sign was involved and commonly other symptoms were present and marked. Medical follow up was strongly advised. Hospitalization is usually in order.\n    5. Extreme: Life threatening.\n    Exception: persons having known allergies always raise the degree of severity one and possibly more level. Symptoms of anaphylaxis always start at level 3.\n\n    (Could also be included: Effects upon vital signs. Any of the following that continues for more than 5 minutes. Pulse rate or respirations increase or decrease significantly. Typically > +\/- 15%.

        "text":"What Upsets Your Plans ?\n\nWelcome to The Fast Diet The official Fast forums Mind Planning\nWhat Upsets Your Plans ?\n\nThis topic contains 3 replies, has 2 voices, and was last updated by \u00a0TracyJ 4 years, 10 months ago.\n\nViewing 4 posts - 1 through 4 (of 4 total)\n\n  \u2022 We all know we have to stick to our diet\/exercise project to get maximum benefit. However, being human, we slip up occasionally \u2013 even frequently perhaps. But what are the main tripping points that send us off piste ? For me it is definitely change in routine. I am happy with a steady 5:2 routine and, provided it is not interfered with, I can plod on rhythmically in the knowledge that the end target will be mine eventually. (Oh yes it will !). However, here are my disasters-in-waiting :\n\n    Christmas : far and away the worst period for maintaining control of one\u2019s project. For example it is irritating to open your first present on Christmas Morning, like I did, to disclose a large box of delicious Liquorice Allsorts ! Eat them sparingly then ? Don\u2019t be silly !\n\n    Holidays : it just does not seem like a holiday if you have to \u2018watch what you eat\u2019 all the time. Full English Breakfast already included in the price ? I rest my case.\n\n    Birthday celebrations : we have 3 here in 4 weeks in the Summer. Potential disastrous cake-fest !\n\n    Meals out : TBH I am most reluctant these days to go on these outings, especially to self-service carvery establishments ! I have absolutely no self-control whatever. \u2018Twas always thus.\n\n    With regard to exercise outdoors, continual poor weather (as now) is a right downer. In fact I am sat here writing this instead of getting out there, even though I am already changed for action ! But I am nearly finished \u2026\n\n    Sound familiar ? What derails you lot out there ?\n\n    Nowt really.\n\n    Christmas: It\u2019s Christmas give yourself a break, forget about calorie counting on non-fastdays during the \u2018festive period\u2019 (but don\u2019t go mental and eat an entire Xmas pudding on your own in one sitting \u2013 half is fine \ud83d\ude09 ). Sacrifice 1-2 days during Xmas & new years weeks to normal fasting days (your body will thank you for the rest and it\u2019s not THAT hard to find 1-2 days that you can do this).\n\n    Holidays: I just don\u2019t bother with breakfast and maybe lunch too and eat whatever I feel like for dinner on holidays. No point trying to fast on holiday but travelling days are fair game and I never find it difficult to fast all day on \u2018flying\u2019 day and just have a small (hopefully) 500 calorie meal on the first day there and again when I get back home. Yes, you\u2019ll probably put on a couple of lb but, as people have reported on various \u2018Holidays\u2019 threads over the last year, it goes pretty quickly when you get back.\n\n    Birthday Celebrations: Yep, my family and friends are all quite bunched together over summer too but unless you have 7 birthdays on different days of the same week, it\u2019s not really an issue on 5:2. Just organise your fasting days around the \u2018special\u2019 day and save all your \u2018normal\u2019 calorie intake on that day for the celebratory dinner and or cake. You should have lots of fasting experience from your fastdays \u2013 just use them on a non-fastday and save your calories for where they\u2019re needed.\n\n    Meals out: see Birthday Celebrations. All you can eat buffets are probably not the best idea (I\u2019ve done that to myself a couple of times & my stomach can\u2019t really take the punishment anymore, although that never stops my mouth so PAIN ensues). However meals out can be great as, depending how many meals you\u2019ve already had that day (none in my case), you can have the a drink, starter, main and desert and still be reasonably confident that you haven\u2019t totally destroyed your TDEE. You might go over slightly but as long as you don\u2019t do it every day it\u2019s not too bad and if you stick to 2 courses you\u2019ll definitely struggle to bust your TDEE in one sitting.\n\n    Re exercise: I\u2019m a swimmer, so although I may not feel like leaving the house to get to the pool I can\u2019t really say \u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d and use that as an excuse, it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t going to get wet anyway \ud83d\ude00\n\n    I just started a thread about the importance of goals & something to aim for myself. Maybe you need something to aim for to inspire you out of the chair too? http:\/\/thefastdiet.co.uk\/forums\/topic\/goals-support-and-something-to-aim-for\/\n\n    Hah ! Excellent !\n\n    Well, I sure set myself up there, to be shot down in flames, didn\u2019t I, TracyJ ! Don\u2019t get me wrong; I appreciate your comments. All very logical tactics and clearly indicating your extensive 5:2 journey experience compared with myself, still struggling 7 weeks in.\n\n    What I forgot to mention, with regard to derailment at the micro level, is that traditionally it has always been myself that \u2018finishes things off\u2019 in the fridge or food cupboard. For example, the 2 spare roast potatoes sitting there, friendless, in the fridge since the weekend. Nobody will touch them except myself. Same for stuff past its \u2018best before date\u2019. I am originally from Yorkshire also and, especially being brought up there immediately after WW2 with rationing etc., am loathe to throw ANY food away. So I don\u2019t (unless it has gone green or furry) !\n\n    However, it is good to see that you have developed a strategy for disruption and I have taken it on board. And I did get out for a 5K run this morning after all !\n\n    Good for you!\n\n    I don\u2019t like to waste food either. I made today (fastday) very difficult for myself by over eating (not by much but still) yesterday, as I had half a family sized (but only a small family I stress \u2013 if there were more than 4 people they\u2019d be rather put out) cheesecake that needed finishing off.\n\n    These things are sent to try us. It put me (probably) a couple of hundred over my TDEE and made this morning difficult (hunger increases when you overeat on non-fastdays) but it\u2019s not the end of the world as long as it\u2019s not something that you do all the time.\n\n    Flexibility and adaptation are the unique selling point of this way of life after all. You just might have to do some creative thinking to get those potatoes used up \u2013 they\u2019d be useful as the base for a soup (just sayin\u2019). Soups freeze pretty well (just sayin\u2019).\n\n\nViewing 4 posts - 1 through 4 (of 4 total)\n\nYou must be logged in to reply.",

I felt like my anxiety was getting better this week, I've started using CBT and it was really really helping. But then I has a few drinks last night and lost the ability to use the CBT when I started to get worked up and anxious. It was like all the anxiety had bubbled up over the week and exploded, turning me into this scary person who told everybody she hated them just to make them leave her alone. I feel like there was a lot of collateral damage in terms of upsetting people, especially as everyone there was pretty close friends. I don't know what to do because I've always enjoyed having a few drinks with friends (I only had 3 normal strength rum and cokes) yet I seem to have lost my alcohol tolerance. I also find CBT really helpful at the time and thought it was working, but if its leading me to build things up subconsciously then is it really working? I'm not on any meds and I never want to be.\n\n  2. #2\n    Senior Member\n    Join Date\n    Aug 2012\n    Indiana, USA :)\n    Yes, alcohol lowers mental thresholds. Yes, alcohol will bring forward the thoughts you're learning to file away or dispose of. Yes, CBT is helpful but won't overpower the effects of a poison added to your system.\n\n    Yes, stop drinking until you gain full control of your mind and this anxiety.\n\n\n\n\nTags for this Thread\n\nPosting Permissions\n\n  \u2022 You may not post new threads\n  \u2022 You may not post replies\n  \u2022 You may not post attachments\n  \u2022 You may not edit your posts\nDriving Large",

But I'm slowly acquiring them!\u00a0 My primary seems okay.\u00a0 My psychiatrist and therapist are awesome.\u00a0 My nutritionist is changing my life.\u00a0 And my new gynecologist is great.\u00a0 Now if I can just add a pain specialist to the mix, my health team will be perfection!\n\n\n  1. I have PCOS too. Have you been prescribed Metformin? It's supposedly the best thing for insulin resistance, but I couldn't take it due to uh, ah, certain side effects that I won't get into here. I hope you tolerate it and it works well for you. I'm currently taking Yasmin and Spironolactone, which keeps my testosterone down but doesn't help with the weight gain at all sadly. Best of luck!!\n\n    1. Yes, I'll be starting metformin once they make sure it doesn't conflict with my psych meds. I'm on ortho tricyclin because I didn't have any issues with it before and it's really inexpensive. Fingers crossed!\n\n    2. I should also add that it sounded really weird and anti-fat of me to say \"sadly\" about the weight gain - not my intention at all. I left out some personal context there, oooooops.\n\n  2. Sounds like it is all starting to come together...hope the results will make this summer the best ever.\n\n  3. Heidi, I'm pretty sure what's being referred to are the gastrointestinal side effects of Metformin\/Glucophage; bloating, gas, diareah. Don't let it scare you off though. I have PCOS and Diabetes and it works very well for me. I had the doctor switch me to the Extended Release option and didn't have the side effects any more. Something to keep in mind.\n\n\n  4. Heidi, I am so glad you are taking care of your health issues. You deserve to have a body that feels good and does what it's supposed to do.\n\n    One thing I really hope you're doing, health-wise, is taking your vitamin supplements. People who've had WLS really, really need to do this; their bodies have problems absorbing vitamins so they need to take high doses to absorb adequate amounts. Vitamin deficiencies can cause all sorts of serious problems, such as depression and extreme fatigue, and you've written about suffering from both of those problems. See here, for example, for one woman's story of how a vitamin B-12 deficiency wreaked havoc with her health: (The writer of that piece says that birth control pills prevent adequate B-12 absorption, so you might want to ask your doctor about that, now that you're going on birth control).\n\n    I hope this doesn't sound too preachy or condescending, Heidi! I'm just writing this because I'm a huge fan of you and your work, and I care about how you feel. Take care of yourself, sweetie!\n\n  5. You also can have extreme fatigue as part of the fibro. So if you have multiple illnesses causing fatigue, when each alone is enough to keep you in bed all day, that can be overwhelming for sure. Oh, and also, fibro can cause muscle weakness, I get that a ton with the muscles in my thighs, on days it is bad I cannot stand up at all. I've been in lines at the pharmacy before and had to go sit down because my legs couldn't hold me up anymore.\n\n    Denied your case? Like he isn't taking new patients or he won't take you as a patient or if he takes you as a patient, he won't help you manage your pain medically...??? That sucks. There's got to be some dr in the south that will have a little compassion for a girl in pain.\n\n  6. Hey Heidi, so glad things are coming together. As to the Metformin, try to get the extended release type as it doesn't have the unfortunate gastrointestional side effects, yugh. Keep going buckaroo, things just keep getting better.",

My husband died in an accident few years ago.\u00a0Recently, I\u2019ve been suffering from different dental diseases like swollen and receding gums, bleeding etc. I then consulted a dentist in my locality. He warned me if bone loss occurs, multiple teeth will fall out and before that happens it has to be cured by doing periodontal disease treatment. Hearing this, I was terrified. My kid is only 6 years and if all my teeth are gone I will look like a granny. So, can anyone of you help me? I am not so educated and don't know much about this treatment? Is it effective? Is the disease permanently curable? Is it expensive? Waiting for your valuable replies.

I am not a dentist but I would strongly suggest seeking out a second or third opinion. I would Google dentists in your area and read the reviews. Not all dentists are created equal and some will financially take advantage of patients. Please consider consulting the dental association in your area and hopefully they will have more information about the treatment you were offered. I hope you will find the answers you are looking for.\n\nShare this post\n\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nCreate an account or sign in to comment\n\nYou need to be a member in order to leave a comment\n\nCreate an account\n\nSign up for a new account in our community.

I also get a lot of muscle stiffness just after some mild exercise. Everything except for my leg is quite subtle and so I am wondering if this fits MS. I am not having any overt loss of sensation or muscle weakness. And no real heat intolerance, I just get fatigued right after a hot shower. And no problems with vision besides needing to get a glasses perscription. Besides that I am just fatigued all the time, always have been actually. So my questions are:\n\nDid anybody have just vague sensory symptoms as their first sign?\nHow long does it take after symptoms start to get a positive MRI?\nDid you have trouble getting people to believe you that you are having these symptoms?\nWhat other diagnoses did you get before confirming MS?\n\nI guess thats all I can think of for now. Thanks so much for your input!\nPosts: 1\nJoined: Sat Dec 15, 2012 11:37 am\n\n\nRe: Waiting on a diagnosis, have some questions\n\nPostby MarkLavelle \u00bb Sat Dec 15, 2012 2:03 pm\n\nI guess you could say my initial symptoms (paresthesia [pins & needles] in my feet) were vague, in that for the first week or so that came & went. But over the course of 2-3 months the paresthesia spread over most of my skin and became 24\/7.\n\nIt was about a year and a half before I had a diagnosis and the confirmation of a second opinion, but the neuros didn't make any other dx along the way.\n\nI didn't have any trouble getting anyone to believe me, but I initially saw my physiatrist (thinking it was spine-related) and he's really good about listening (and is the one who sent me to a neuro). Describing things as well as possible usually helps...\n\nRRMS dx 3\/3\/11; Copaxone since 12\/1\/11\nFamily Elder\nPosts: 178\nJoined: Sat Dec 17, 2011 9:08 pm\nLocation: San Francisco Bay area\n\nReturn to General Discussion\n\n\n  \u2022 Related topics\n    Last post\n\nWho is online\n\nUsers browsing this forum: No registered users\n\nContact us | Terms of Service",

It was a bit of a shock to both of us as we haven't even been going out a month. This and a few other circumstances that I won't go into are making things a little complicated for me as I'm not sure, after such a short period of time together, that committing myself to the possibility of a life long infection is a wise choice.\n\nThing is we really like each other and personally I don't see it as a major issue as long as the risk of transmission is reasonably low.. My problem is finding out any specific information as I've seen numbers ranging from less then 1% without an outbreak to far far higher again without an outbreak. All of which seems to be anecdotal at best with very few of them citing any objective research. (Protected sex of course.)\n\nI've been gathering as much information as possible so I can make an informed decision on how to procede. I was hoping that some of the more experienced and knowledgeable users on this board could possibly point me in the right direction.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated..\n\n\nPS: In saying all this I've read plenty about people being carriers without knowing so I'll be going for a blood test on Monday to check myself out too.\n\nThanks for reading\n\nSponsors Lightbulb",

Also a decrease in pulse. I see a chiropractor and sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. I also feel a burning sensation down that arm. Could it be thoracic outlet?\n\nI also get intense chest discomfort but heart has been ruled out.\n\nHello Dodie,\nBecause this radiates very specifically to the C8 dermatome, it's unlikely to be related to any heart condition; that's the good news.\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome is a possibility because the C8 nerve lies directly on the first rib; are the symptoms worse when working with your arms above your head? Ask your chiropractor to do Adson's test. The subclavian artery and radial pulse in the wrist are then often affected. You don't say which pulse.\n\nBecause bending the elbow increases the symptoms, we also have to think of the ulna nerve in the funny bone groove in the elbow; it's very rare, in my experience but should be considered.\n\nTwo little tests for you.\n\n1. Turn your head to the left and look up. What happens?\n\n2. Use the search function to find Upper Limb Tension Test at Chiropractic Help.

I saw my chiropractor and the initial xrays of my neck when I started to first see him show I have what is called a \"Military Neck\". It doesn't pivot. I discussed with him what I commented here and it does appear I have some arterial compression going on. I have been doing nerve slide exercises and several others and have stopped laying on my back spending hours on my Kindle with my arms bent. No numbness, and no chest pain issues. Once my insurance kicks in in a few months he will reevaluate me. Thank you.\n\nHello Dodie,\nThat's all great news. A military neck, or straightening of the lordosis, is almost always associated with pain; it's pointing to an injury in the spine. But anyway, it's great you're feeling better.

Luckily, most of the discomfort is upper cervical which is only rarely arthritic; his lower cervical spine is a degenerative mess that I've left alone. After seven treatments his pain and stiffness is 50 percent better, and he's happy in the circumstances. He can sleep through the night now and that makes a huge difference.\n\n2. Mr P is 32 year old man with very severe lower back pain radiating to the big toe which is 30 percent numb. He had an episode three weeks ago, took anti inflammatories and was soon better as is typical of the medial disc herniation. But before it healed, after a trivia it came roaring back, much worse. The characteristic crossed sign was evident; sitting in a chair, straightening the right leg provoked severe left back pain and tingling in the leg. He's doing well.\n\n3. Severe lower back pain is scary; just ask Mrs P. Just watching her get out of the car I she was in trouble; she had a slipped disc at L4 making her lean towards the opposite side; luckily she had no pain in the leg. Despite family pressure that this was far too severe for a chiropractor, she persevered. Within five days she was standing upright, and after two weeks almost painfree.\u00a0\n\nDespite a hectic job, she wisely took my advice and stayed home for what I call exercising bed rest.\n\n4. Mr S has had lower back, groin and back of thigh and calf pain for fourth months.\n\nHe has a pincer deformity in the hip causing the stabs in the groin, and a degenerative facet causing the sciatica. Both are responding well to chiropractic and he's well pleased; sixty five percent better after three treatments.\n\n5. Mr T is a wise man; he's taken a warning TIA seriously and has lost 15 pounds, and has at least as much again to lose. A change to a low starch diet and half hour daily walk has made the difference; but the walking is making his foot and back miserable. The expensive orthotic is hopeless; luckily his hips and back are fine, but he needs a simple heel lift.\n\n6. I too have had serious lower back issues, luckily fixed by my own chiropractor; so I too have to do my exercises, take care when lifting supers full of honey, gardening and using the chainsaw. Regaining the function of your spine is just as important as the pain.\n\n7. My own granddaughter, only 7 is hypermobile giving her pelvic, knee and ankle issues. Xrays show a mildly dysplastic hip. Years ago we would have called it growing pains. She too regularly needs chiropractic care and luckily responds well. Increased range of motion is more difficult than too stiff in my opinion. Our care is for kids too.\n\n8. This 65 year old lady is a serious gardener; every day she is bending, lifting and digging for 2 to 3 hours a day. It regularly catches her in the sacroiliac joint, so she has a treatment once a month that sorts it out. She does her lower back exercises faithfully.\n\n9. This 88 year old lady is an inspiration; every day she is busy in the community. With a nasty scoliosis she manages very well with a chiropractic adjustment every six weeks and exercises faithfully done. \u00a0\n\n10. Mr X is a 71 year old retired man who wants to continue with maintenance care every six to eight weeks; he had suffered from two years of lower back pain when he first came a year ago. He has no discomfort now after 8 chiropractic treatments, but is aware that danger lurks.\n\n11. Mrs C has been having severe headaches, and taking a lot of analgesics. It's a non complicated upper cervical facet syndrome, and she's doing well.\n\n12. Mr D is a 38 old year man with chronic shoulder pain after a rotator cuff tear playing cricket. It responded well to treatment, but he knows he must do his exercises every day; for two years he couldn't sleep on that shoulder.\n\n13. Mr D, a 71 year old man, has a severe ache in the shoulder and midback since working above his head. Trapped nerve tests are negative but he has advanced degenerative joints of Luschka; after just two treatments he is 50 percent better. Can we reach 90?\n\nAnd so the day goes; chiropractors shouldn't be treating the elderly most medical sites state but that's so much bunkum.\n\nHave a problem that's not getting better? Looking for a different slant on your pain? Want to pose a question?\n\nInteresting questions from visitors\n\nCLS writes:\n\nGreetings, Dr B.\nYou helped me quite some time back with a soothing and professional response which turned out to be exactly correct. I now consult a local chiropractor. You write a superb newsletter, too.\n\nYour own unresolved problem. Pose a question\n\nKnowing that up to 70% of the time the correct diagnosis is made with no examination, no special tests, no xrays, but just from the history, there's a fair chance I can add some insight to your unresolved problem. But at least 30% of the time, I may be quite wrong! Give plenty of detail if you want a sensible reply.\n\nYou visited this chiropractic help site no doubt because you have a problem that is not resolving and want to know more about what chiropractors do.\n\nThe quickest and most interesting way is to read one of my ebooks of anecdotes.

And I continue to wake up lighter every day.\n\nNot a bad problem to have, but I am a creature of habit (as you may have noticed). Now that we're back home, I can't get myself to stop eating my oatmeal, acorn squash, sprouts, tomatoes and lefse. I have been adding TVP to the oatmeal, which helped with the protein situation. And supplement bananas, apples, tofu and cottage cheese as needed. But there just aren't many calories in those. And, of course, I should mention that breastfeeding burns 500-700 calories a day.\n\nSo how thin is too thin? I think I'm actually where I want to be, but don't want to stop the diet! The thing is, I pride myself on being a strong woman who can run ultras and swim miles at a time, but I like the fact that I'm losing weight without trying. And SR is giving me tons of positive feedback (no one minds being called \"gorgeous skinny b####\"). Although he does find all the oatmeal and gords a bit weird.\n\nDare I say staying at a healthy weight is as challenging as losing weight? At least I find this to be true while I'm breastfeeding. So now that my BMI (18.2) is underweight, I've probably got to stabilize, but I still feel healthy and strong. And the lighter you are, the faster you can run, to a point. From the information I found on the internet, Paula Radcliffe's BMI is 18.0, so I probably don't want to be below that.\n\nStay tuned, I'll hopefully end up staying at this weight, which seems about right for me. And if you're feeling adventurous, try the oatmeal diet and let me know how it works for you.\n\n\nLisa said...\n\nSea Legs...I would cry and die if I had to eat that much oatmeal. LOL! You don't alternate egg whites or something? Glad you are happy with your weight. Kiss the Bois! Enjoy!\n\nsea legs girl said...\n\nHa, Lisa. Cry and die. I love it. Maybe that's why the oatmeal diet is not a staple among diets. Perhaps I'm the only one who enjoys that much oatmeal. And, yes I'll kiss the Bois!\n\nolga said...\n\nI guess I should try and like oatmeal (love would be overstatement). I can eat a cup for breakfast, but don't fill up on it. Good for you!\n\nHeather said...\n\nJust be careful, sealegs.\n\nAs someone who once had an eating disorder, and not as a competitive runner, etc, I have to give the word of caution pretty much whenever someone is talking about losing weight past for medical reasons.\n\nDanni said...\n\nIf you want to maintain your weight but stay on your oatmeal diet, it sounds like you need to supplement your oatmeal with yet more oatmeal. Or do you mean you don't want to stop dieting?\n\nI think it's harder to maintain weight than to lose it -- you are rewarded directly by dieting -- you see the low number on the scale. The reward of not gaining weight isn't as palpable and can be boring. Perhaps a new goal, such as how much weight you can lift, would satisfy the number-oriented\/goal-oriented\/fitness-oriented cravings?\n\nSteveQ said...\n\nI never connected this blog and you until you contacted me! There's a built-in failsafe for runners who diet; decreased performance. In my case, in college, I started to fall apart at 130 lbs (at 6 feet). I'm 30 lbs. heavier now and slower, but healthier overall.\n\nsea legs girl said...\n\nGood point, Danni, that the GOAL needs to be feeling good and strong (and maybe a number goal like that is the way to go... interesting idea). And to Danni & Steve, I often find it hard to know weather it's actually the affect of the diet itself that makes me a bit slower (albeit temporarily), or if it's the fact that I weigh too little. People can be weak from eating too little and still weigh too much, obviously. So, I guess it takes a lot of experimentation to figure out what your ideal performance weight is (and obviously depends on your sport). That is part of the reason I'm a little hesitant to stop the diet now. Steve, your BMI was 17.6 - holy wow - that is low!",

There are several commonly used ingredients that can be found in everything from body and face lotions to cosmetics and shaving creams which are known endocrine disruptors.\n\nThese ingredients can alter hormonal chemistry in a couple of ways. They can increase circulation of certain hormones by mimicking their activity in the body, or they can reduce the level of sex hormones in the body or block their activity. This can impact fertility, lead to early menopause and influence things like mood, length and severity of the menstrual cycle in women.\n\nPhthalates linked to infertility, early menopause\n\nPhthalates are a family of chemicals that are used in most artificially scented products on the market today. This includes air fresheners, scented body products like lotions and of course most commercial perfumes. They are used to help stabilize the fragrance chemicals.\n\nThey are commonly used to soften plastics. They are also found in products such as hair straighteners, hairsprays, and nail polish. A recent study done by the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0(CDC) found that all 289 participants in the study had phthalates present in their urine.\n\nStudies have concluded that phthalates likely contribute to early-onset menopause and may also contribute to infertility in women and men. They can have a definite impact on the\u00a0natural\u00a0hormones circulating in the body, and have shown the ability to reduce circulating sex hormones.\n\nIn other words, they tamper with your body's natural ability to control its natural balance of female and male sex hormones. Some of the ways you may see\u00a0phthalates\u00a0on the ingredient label are as di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di(2-ehtylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP).\n\nThe \"amine\" family of chemicals\n\nYou've likely seen offshoots of this popular chemical additive in the ingredient list of products purchased in the past. They can be found as diethanolamine (DEA), triethanolamine (TEA), amonoethanolamine (MEA) on the ingredient label.\n\nThese\u00a0chemicals\u00a0are often used as an emulsifier for stable mixtures, as a foaming agent in bar and liquid soaps and shampoos, and also as a preservative for long shelf life. They are not only linked to hormonal disruption, but they are also linked to liver and kidney cancer and are corrosive to the delicate eye tissue.\n\nNonylphenol or nonylphenol ethoxylates\n\nThese chemicals are found in many commercial hair colors and dyes as well as in laundry detergent and household cleaners. They can usually be found on the ingredient label as 4-nonylphenol, an alkylphenol. These chemicals act like female estrogen in the body and can throw both the male and female body out of their natural hormone balance.\n\n\nParabens are preservatives that are present in many body and hair care products. This family of chemicals is found on the ingredient label with the prefixes of \"methyl,\" \"ethyl,\" \"propyl\" and \"butyl.\" Parabens are a well known endocrine disruptor with a documented history of causing hormonal issues because of their ability to mimic the female hormone, estrogen.\n\n\nTriclosan is an antibacterial agent that was added to specially formulated soaps and hand sanitizers specifically marketed for antibacterial use. They are highly disruptive to the human endocrine system and several links to cancer have also been raised over the past several years.\n\nThankfully, a lot of products have yanked this from their formulations, but it is still one to watch out for in your ingredient labels. Also, it is important to note that normal soap and warm water will kill bacteria just as effectively.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nLearn more:\nby on Jan. 10, 2013 at 6:41 AM\nAdd your quick reply below:\nYou must be a member to reply to this post.\nThere are no replies to this post.\nJoin the Meeting Place for Moms!\nTalk to other moms, share advice, and have fun!\n\n(minimum 6 characters)\n\nclose Join now to connect to\nother members!\nConnect with Facebook or Sign Up Using Email\n\nAlready Joined?
