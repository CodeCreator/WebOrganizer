        "text":"Week 20: June 14-20\n\nGroup Discussion: (30 Minutes)\n\n  1. Pastor Keith said that racism isn\u2019t political. Are you able to address this topic outside of the political rhetoric that you listen to? Does the Bible inform you or CNN or FoxNews?\u00a0\n  2. Pastor Keith said that we often mishandle power in our brokenness. What power has God given you that you can use to serve others? In what way are you tempted to use your power for you?\n  3. Pastor Keith suggested that we listen before we talk. I am reading a couple of books that make me uncomfortable. I am learning. I am reading \u201cWhite Awake\u201d written by a white Christian Pastor. It is his journey of understanding God\u2019s heart for a New Humanity and the struggle to see his own prejudice. From another (opposing) point of view, I am reading Thomas Sowell\u2019s book \u201cIntellectuals and Race\u201d. He is an African American economist and social theorist who advocates for an understanding of racial inequities along social and economic lines rather than ethnic identity wars that have been made commonplace by intellectual elites. My suggestion: turn off CNN and FoxNews and read for yourself. So, the question: what are you learning?\u00a0\n  4. Lastly, let\u2019s pray together.\u00a0\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

        "text":"My Cold Objectivity & Your Emotions\n\nCold objectivity has its value in psychic readings.\u00a0 One unfortunate phenomena many of us have run into is having a Psychic let their personal experience color their view of your situation.\u00a0 That will never happen with me.\u00a0\n\nWhile I can be compassionate about your situation,\u00a0 I am coldly objective about the psychic data.\u00a0 My personal experience has no place except as an occasional point of reference.\u00a0\n\nNor do your emotions have an impact on the reading. You can be crying, sobbing or even screaming. As long as I can make out what you're saying, I'm okay with emotions. I can read right through them! The only thing I would have a problem with in you calling into question my integrity as a psychic or hurling personal insults at me. If you get excited about your man and demand to know why he is behaving a certain, I will tell you. You're tone, quite frankly, doesn't make a damn bit of difference.\n\nI only ask that you be honest with your verbal feedback so I can stay properly attuned to your situation.\n\nIf you want brutal accuracy with practical application, I am your psychic!\u00a0 Talk to you soon!\nNo Comments\nAnonymous comments are disabled",

        "text":"29 July 2011\n\nClinging to the Shore\n\nI can't exactly put words on it.\u00a0 Maybe ache-urge-shame-wonder-awe comes close.\u00a0 It's what wells up when I read something like these lines from Baisa\u014d:\nPain and poverty\npoverty and pain\nlife stripped to the bone\nabsolute nothingness\nonly one thing left\na bright cold moon\nin the midnight window\nilluminating a Zen mind\non its homeward way\nHere's the thing, though:\u00a0 I don't want just to read about it.\u00a0 I want to see that very same moon with that very same mind.\u00a0 I want know exactly what Baisa\u014d knew (and, yes, I read the first two lines of the poem, too, and, yes, I realize just how \u00fcberinflated, \u00fcbercomfortable and \u00fcberpadded my own life still is).\n\nIs that so very much to ask?\n\nI still feel like I'm looking at the water afraid to get wet.\u00a0 I see Baisa\u014d in the waves.\u00a0 I see Ry\u014dkan in the waves. \u00a0 I see Saigy\u014d in the waves.\u00a0 I see Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the waves.\u00a0 \"Come in,\" they call, \"the water's fine.\"\u00a0\n\n\"But what about my stuff?\"\u00a0 I call back.\n\n\"Just leave it. You won't miss it once you're in here.\"\n\nAnd I both believe and don't believe them.\u00a0 So I shout out, \"I'll be in in a little bit,\" and I wait on the shore feeling that same ol' ache-urge-shame-wonder-awe for yet a while longer.\n\n27 July 2011\n\nA Case of Tourista\n\nNo, it wasn't because of the water, and it wasn't what one might expect.\n\nIt was me!\n\nMy enjoyment of the past week's sights and sounds and tastes and smells (and I did enjoy them thoroughly) couldn't overcome the growing uneasiness I felt at being a leisure traveler.\u00a0 It gnawed at me the whole time.\n\nI don't like finding myself counted among the pampered and the privileged.\u00a0 I don't like the separation that comes when I stay in surroundings that are cleaned and tended to by those who couldn't begin to stay in them, when I eat food prepared and served by people who couldn't begin to eat it.\u00a0 I would love to say to them, \"I'm your brother, let me be what you need me to be,\" but my actions say, \"I'm your master, and you're supposed to make my whims come true.\"\u00a0 I would love for their well-being to be my highest concern.\u00a0 Instead, my comfort becomes theirs.\u00a0\n\nI will have occasion to need overnight lodging from time to time.\u00a0 My kids' colleges are too far away for pick ups and drop offs to be single-day events.\u00a0 When I make such trips, I stay one-star cheap.\u00a0 Clean linens and a clean bathroom are more than enough.\u00a0 Maybe in time I can do without even that much, staying with friends or relatives, perhaps, or camping if that's an option.\n\nBut leisure travel?\u00a0 I think I'm ready to resolve not to engage in leisure travel again.\u00a0 It just turns me into something I did not ordain to be.\u00a0 And no sight or sound or taste or smell on earth can compensate for that.\n\n17 July 2011\n\nGoing and Returning We Never Leave Home\n\nA long time ago I was spending a couple of months with a friend in Hamburg, Germany before heading off to Frankfurt for a year of study.\u00a0 At the time, the favorable exchange rate coupled with my still-qualifying-for youth-fare age meant travel was rather inexpensive.\u00a0 So I got the bright idea to head to Assisi on a pilgrimage, spending a few days on the cheap where Francis had hung out so many centuries before.\n\nI boarded a train and traveled through a day and a night and the better part of another day before finding myself at the station on the plain below Assisi.\u00a0 When I got off the train I realized in an instant that there was nothing there for me that I didn't already have, nothing I would discover that I didn't already know, nothing I could take away that could avail me in any way, shape or form.\u00a0 So rather than make my way up the hill to the city to stay for a few days, I boarded the next northbound train, and I traveled through the night and a day and part of another night before arriving back where I had started from some 60 hours earlier.\n\nTomorrow I fly across the ocean for a week abroad.\u00a0 I'm getting the trip for free, and I'm grateful for the generosity that is making it possible, but to tell the truth I wouldn't be at all upset if the trip got canceled right now. \u00a0 It's not that it won't be nice to get a change of scenery, and it's not that it won't be nice to get away from the center for a little bit.\u00a0 It's just that I have come to know, from the one side, that no matter what I pack or don't pack, this bundle of stuff I take to be \"me\" always goes along for the ride, and it doesn't really matter at which latitude and longitude it happens to find itself, since it can (and does) pull its shenanigans anywhere at any time.\u00a0\u00a0 From the other side, whether it's borscht or Boca, Nevsky Prospekt or Mt. Prospect, it's all just this.\u00a0 Travel an inch, travel 2500 miles, it's still just this.\n\nThat said, I really like flying in airplanes.\u00a0 At this time of year that far north there will be hardly any night for me for a week, and if that isn't cool enough, I'm going to be all too happy to let someone else monitor the rogue bamboo in the garden for 8 days.\u00a0 Off I go!\n\n15 July 2011\n\nAsalha Puja\n\nToday is Asalha Puja, sometimes called Dharma Day, which commemorates the first turning of the Wheel of the Dharma.\u00a0 Vassa, the three-month Rains Retreat, begins tomorrow.\n\nI get that in Mah\u0101y\u0101na practice there is not a lot of emphasis on the historical Buddha or on celebrations that surround key moments in the early development of Buddhism.\u00a0 But what could better capture the Mah\u0101y\u0101na spirit than Asalha Puja?\u00a0 Here we see the Buddha, having cleared the mind, now liberating all sentient beings with the Dharma.\u00a0 What he did, we also aspire to do.\n\nBut reenactment is not the order of the day, and if by turning the Wheel we mean giving a lecture on the Four Noble Truths, we've missed the point, too:\nThe kid is cranky.\u00a0 Now turn the Wheel.\nYou land the much needed job.\u00a0 Now turn the Wheel.\nThe soup is spilled.\u00a0 Now turn the Wheel.\nA friend needs a hand.\u00a0 Now turn the Wheel.\nYou inherit a fortune.\u00a0 Now turn the Wheel.\nThe spouse dies.\u00a0 Now turn the Wheel.\nA most propitious Asalha Puja, sangha!\n\n14 July 2011\n\nGetting Dressed (Or Not) In The No Comprendo Zone\n\nThe other night I received a text message from my daughter who was riding a train en route to Washington, DC: \"There are Tibetan monks on this train!\"\u00a0 She knew that because they were dressed like Tibetan monks.\n\nA couple of years ago I was renewing my drivers license, and in line in front of me was an Eastern Orthodox priest.\u00a0 I knew that because he was dressed like an Orthodox priest.\n\nA couple of weeks ago when we bought the trees for the yard, we knew when we had spotted the Catholic nun selling baked goods when we were looking around for her stand.\u00a0 We knew that because she was dressed like a Catholic nun.\n\nAt a clothing store recently I saw an Orthodox Jewish mom and her son shopping for the boy.\u00a0 I knew that because he was wearing, and carrying to the register, a white shirt and black pants, and out of the pants and shirt he was wearing I saw his tzitzis.\n\nI find these snapshots compelling.\u00a0 I find them compelling because these men and women and children have no qualms about not fitting in with the prevailing culture.\u00a0 I find them compelling because these men and women and children, by not fitting in with the prevailing culture, create within that cultural landscape something noticeably different, something that points \u2013 I'll say it \u2013 in a better direction.\u00a0 I find them compelling because these men and women and children are willing to live with the realization that they cannot go just anywhere so dressed, that they will not be welcomed everywhere, and that others may well (and often do) look at them and shake their heads in contempt.\u00a0 I also find them compelling, though, because others may well (and often do) look at them, see that another way is possible and begin to set themselves on that path.\n\nI get that Zen came to America at the same time as the 60s hit.\u00a0 I get that it showed up just when folks were seeing a benchmark of liberation in the shedding of such distinctive religious clothing (as if nuns trading in their habits for polyester pantsuits in the 70s was, in the end, a fashion coup!).\u00a0 I get that one of the very important things about Zen in America is that it emphasizes lay practice.\n\nStill, we fret about how to spread the Dharma.\u00a0 We ponder ways of getting more folks interested in Zen practice.\u00a0 We scratch our heads wondering why more people don't avail themselves of what Zen has to offer.\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that we think first and almost exclusively in terms of media, without realizing that what moves people most is the example of another human being.\u00a0 Siddhartha didn't set out on the path because someone told him about suffering or because he had read about it.\u00a0 He set out on the path after seeing, in the flesh, a sick person, an old person, a dead person and a living, breathing, distinctively clad monk.\n\nWhat's the worst that would happen were (at least some) ordained Zen folk to walk about the world, ride trains, deal with license lines, procure basic goods and the rest dressed in our robes?\u00a0 Why is it good for the Tibetans, good for the Catholic nuns, good for the Orthodox priests, good for the Orthodox Jews, but not for us?\u00a0 What are we most afraid of here \u2013 bothering somebody or being bothered and inconvenienced ourselves?\n\nI don't understand the resistance to the idea of dressing according to station.\u00a0 I just don't understand.\n\n12 July 2011\n\nNothing To Be Ashamed Of\n\nI find no stumbling-block in the robe of the Buddha.\n\nSo when I heard from a high-standing Zen priest that he doesn't wear the robe and kesa when officiating at weddings, opting instead for a well-tailored shirt and rakusu, I was kind of surprised.\u00a0 He explained that he thought the robe and kesa might be confusing or off-putting to people in attendance who were not familiar with Buddhism or Zen.\n\nI do not now know \u2013 and I may never know \u2013 what it means to wear the robe and kesa, but I do know that I will not apologize for it or...

        "text":"A man with his head bowed and holding a holy bible in prayer\n\nTo those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ. \u2014 2nd Peter 1:1b\n\nI often reference the scriptures by identifying the author and audience. Who is writing and to whom is he writing to? Sometimes it\u2019s a personal note to a specific individual or group, it can be a prayer to God, we see a lot of warnings and admonishments, and then we see some that are intended for us, personally. I\u2019d like to take a moment and recognize the treasure of what Peter calls \u201cPrecious Faith.\u201d\n\nNow, we know that, \u201cAll Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.\u201d But there are certain times where the words on the page become amplified. When I see, \u201cTo those who have obtained like precious faith,\u201d it \u00a0is something that I should be able to utilize to dissolve an ailment like rejection or loneliness, to know that if I\u2019m a believer in Jesus that I have been given a \u201cPrecious\u201d gift that unites you and I together.\n\nIn the quietness of personal devotion time, may the reminder of this truth unite us as we face a world that seems to be all about division.\n\nWith the emphasis on the word \u201cprecious,\u201d we move from good to great, held in honor, esteemed, especially dear, as of a great price are some of the definitions of this emphasis. This gift of faith that unites us is something to be valued. Peter instructs us \u201cthat through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust\u201d.\n\nThis \u201cPrecious Faith\u201d should be what identifies us as believers, Peter bases his two epistles on trusting in the faith we\u2019ve been given. He says in his first letter, \u201dTthat the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ\u201d.\n\nWhen we treasure the gift that has been given us, there is a manifestation that takes place that reveals the glory of God. So, as we walk our walk, even if there\u2019s not another believer around we are still united through the \u201cPrecious Faith\u201d that sustains us until we are \u201cHome\u201d, safe and sound.

We are what the Word says \u2026 LOVED.\n\nJust as Jesus Christ died on the cross and gave up His life for us \u2013 so that we can be completely free \u2014 is how we are to love and care for others.\n\nWe must love them into the Kingdom.\n\nLove them when they are hurt. Love them when they are broken. Love them when they are angry. Love them when they are proud. Love them when they feel rejected.\n\nIf we, as children of the King, were set free the day we accepted Christ as our Lord and Saviour, shouldn\u2019t we love others just like Christ did \u2014 and follow His example. If we don\u2019t, then who will?\n\nA broken person can\u2019t lead the broken. An angry individual can\u2019t lead someone else suffering from equally anger issues. The rejected can\u2019t lead others who personally know rejection into a secure place of freedom.\n\nOnly those whose heart in child-like faith surrendered their heart to Jesus, now desiring to walk like their Saviour in love.\n\nIndeed, what has love got to do with it? Everything.\n\n\u201cBe ye therefore followers of God, as dear children and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.\u201d (Ephesians 5:1-2)\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"Lambert Dolphin\n\nSaints and Sinners\n\nAll Christians are all given the appellation \"saint\" in the letters of Paul. But late in his life the Apostle Paul said that he was \"foremost among sinners.\" So are the followers of Jesus Christ saints, or sinners?\n\nThe saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. And I am the foremost of sinners; but I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. (1 Timothy 1:15,16)\n\nMy mentor, Ray Stedman once said, \"When a person becomes a Christian everything is changed, but nothing is changed.\" That is, there is a life-long paradox Christians live with. We are saints and sinners at the same time until we go home to be with the Lord. In regard to Romans 12:3 Ray once reminded a group of us that just as we needed to avoid the obvious pride in thinking more highly of ourselves than we ought to think, so also it was wrong to think too little of oneself either!\n\n\"For by the grace given to me I bid every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned him.\"\n\nOne of the disconcerting facts of Christian life is the discovery that simply receiving Jesus Christ into one's life as Lord and Master does not instantly lead to wholeness and an entirely new life overnight. In the eyes of God we are new--and already made perfect and complete, but that is from the vantage point of eternity, not as we see it and must live it out in our time frame of history. Paul in the new Testament teaches that our justification, sanctification and glorification can be thought of as already completed as far as God is concerned (Romans 8:30,1 Corinthians 6:11). It is up to us to \"work out our own salvation with fear and trembling; for God is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure\" (Philippians 2:12,13)\n\nTherefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come. (2 Corinthians 5:17)\n\nAnd I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. (Philippians 1:6)\n\nThe progress of Christian life, (our pilgrim journey) follows a pattern exactly laid out in the books of the Old Testament concerning the history of God's representative nation, Israel. That is, (a) there is a new beginning, (b) a time of deliverance from the world, (c) a wandering in the wilderness, (d) a time for conquest of the land, (e) times of testing because of past incomplete obedience, (f) times of refreshing, and so on. The outworking of this our inheritance from God requires a lifetime of hard work and diligence on our part.\n\nWhat Jesus accomplished for mankind on the cross is so all-encompassing in its possibilities that Paul urges us to persuade all men to avail themselves of God's solution to their deepest needs for healing and wholeness. There is hope for anyone!\n\n\"For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\" (2 Corinthians 5:14-21)\n\nMany healthy changes follow a real surrender to Christ as Lord, and it is quite common for God to give new Christians lots of personal support in terms of a very real and constant sense of his presence for a season. In spite of the difficulties an individual may have come out of in terms of an adverse family background, or exceptionally sinful life-style, many believers continue to grow to maturity in Christ if all they do is follow basic instructions for Christian living.\n\nLet us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful; and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near. (Hebrews 10:23-25)\n\nThis \"normal Christian life\" should include regular time in the scriptures, adequate prayer time alone with God, prayer with other Christians, participation in public worship and getting together with other Christians. Instruction by gifted teachers, and fellowship (body-life) are part and parcel of Christian experience. Christians never do well in isolation. As members of the family of God, as \"members one of another\" and \"members of the Body of Christ\" it is only logical that we should develop close and intimate friendships within the household of faith. Ordinarily, following these basic instructions taken together with our personal obedience to Jesus will produce maturity and wholeness in Christ. Jesus told us to continue in His word in order to become trained by Him, and so that then, as a long term result, full freedom could follow.\n\n\"If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free. They answered him, 'We are descendants of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How is it that you say \"You will make us free\"? Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you. Everyone who commits sins is a slave to sin. The slave does not continue in the house forever. So if the Son makes you free you are free indeed.'\" (John 8:31-36)\n\nOnce Dead in Sin--Now Alive in Christ\n\nPrior to becoming Christians, all of us are described as being \"dead in sin.\" This means we are unresponsive to God and can not be really free not to sin--we can only manage the evil in our lives within certain limits. We lack the power to be free.\n\n\"And you God made alive, when you were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. Among these we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of body and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God--not because of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. (Ephesians 2:1-10)\n\nSpiritual regeneration brings with it freedom for us to choose between God and self, but this involves a struggle (Romans 7) Christians can and do sin after they become believers, inadvertently as well as by choice. Choosing sin after one comes to know the Lord brings temporary slavery to sin. We escape from this temporary bondage not by our own efforts, but by calling on the name of the Lord for restoration , forgiveness, and cleansing. Jesus sets us free so that we can obtain \"the perfect liberty of the sons of God.\" When a Christian does sin, his or her failures leave stains which take time to heal. We retain vulnerability to fail again especially in areas of past failure. (See The Scars of Sin by Ray C. Stedman). Conversely, every time we say \"no\" to temptation we gain strength against evil.\n\n...we are writing this that our joy may be complete. This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth; but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. My little children, I am writing this to you so that you may not sin; but if any one does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. (1 John 1:4-2:2)\n\nThe Role of the Law\n\nThe Law of Moses, given to Israel as part of God's Old Covenant with that nation, was not intended to produce good moral behavior--it can not do that. The Law reveals the character and standards of God and diagnoses our failures. The Law proves us guilty, weak, and helpless. Only when we learn to call on Jesus out of helplessness and inadequacy do we find His adequacy--His resurrection power--at work within us. The New Covenant works by changing our hearts so that we lose interest in sin, and decide to trust Jesus... (truncated)",

        "text":"Mia, Millie and Alfie\n\n\nMia, Millie and Alfie have been born into a family where they are loved, just like millions of other children are around the world. Watching them grow is an amazing experience. Sharing with them about life is an awesome responsibility, teaching them God\u2019s ways and His truths is extremely important to Boo and myself. Much of what we have learnt about life was given to us by our beloved parents. While Mia, Millie and Alfie will never know them personally, we are committed to passing on the important things our parents shared with us. They were incredible people.\n\nSir Isaac Newton is credited with a phrase which has had a big impact on my life \u2018Standing on the shoulders of giants\u2019 in which he gives credit to those who have gone before.\n\nNewton didn\u2019t originate it though. The 12th century theologian and author John of Salisbury used a version of the phrase in a treatise on logic called\u00a0Metalogicon, written in Latin in 1159.\n\nThis so makes me think of the impact our parents had on our lives. Mia, Millie and Alfie will, I trust, get to know much about them as they grow, and we will pass on to them what our parents passed on to us.\n\n\u201cWe are like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants. We see more, and things that are more distant, than they did, not because our sight is superior or because we are taller than they, but because they raise us up, and by their great stature add to ours.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the commandment that\u00a0God, your God, commanded me to teach you to live out in the land. \u00a0This is so that you\u2019ll live in deep reverence before God\u00a0lifelong, observing all his rules and regulations that I\u2019m commanding you, you and your children and your grandchildren, living good long lives.\n\nDo what you\u2019re told so that you\u2019ll have a good life, a life of abundance and bounty, just as\u00a0God\u00a0promised.\n\nGod, our God!\u00a0God\u00a0the one and only!\n\nLove\u00a0God, your God, with your whole heart: love him with all that\u2019s in you, love him with all you\u2019ve got!\n\nWrite these commandments that I\u2019ve given you today on your hearts. Get them inside of you and then get them inside your children. Talk about them wherever you are, sitting at home or walking in the street; talk about them from the time you get up in the morning to when you fall into bed at night.\n\nThe Bible (The Message Version)\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

This is as it should be.\u00a0 Balanced, balanced \u00a0energy, neither too dominant, each\u00a0 working together in cohesion, working together to make the world a better place.\u00a0\nAnd it is becoming a better place.\u00a0 You may not feel this right now, for you are going through a hard time on planet Earth, on planet Gaia.\u00a0 But this is changing the energy, this is changing everything for you. \u00a0So do not fear, but instead go into Love, Unconditional Love.\u00a0 Send out Unconditional Love to everyone on the planet, especially those in fear.\u00a0 For there is much fear on the planet now, but fear is not good, anxiety is not good, stress is not good.\n\u00a0So send out that unconditional Love to allay those fears, to allay the stress, to allay the negativity and to bring everything into positivity.\u00a0 So that Gaia may rise higher and higher, for a new Portal has opened and the energy is pouring in.\u00a0 Allow yourself to flow with this energy.\u00a0 Allow yourself to flow.\u00a0 Put no barricades up with fears or stress, instead open yourselves to Love, the purest Love, Unconditional Love and allow this to be within your soul, your heart, your mind.\u00a0 Allow this to be You, totally You, Unconditional Love, for that is the God energy, the Creator energy, the strongest energy of them all. So be in the Love, the Unconditional Love with the Divine Feminine.\nThank you dear friends, thank you.\u00a0 I am Merlia.\n\nChannelled through Pamela Goodall\n\nLove and Separation\n\nPosted on May 11, 2020 at 8:49 AM Comments comments (305)\n18th April 2020\nChannelling from David, King David of the Bible - Love and Separation\nHello this is David.\u00a0 I come to you tonight to speak of love and separation.\u00a0 At the moment most people on your planet are feeling this separation due to the fact that you are having to isolate for the good of all. This is so you don't pass the virus willy nilly between you and make it worse.\nDuring the Black Death, those who had money isolated themselves as much as they could.\u00a0 This saved some at that time, but not all.\u00a0 For those who had already contacted the Black Death took it with them.\u00a0\nNow you are being asked to keep separate, to not pass this deadly virus to others. You find this hard but know that it will not be forever, there will come a time when once more you can walk around your country and mix with others.\u00a0\nHowever, be patient, what would be the good of mixing with others too quickly.\u00a0 The virus would be free to jump from person to person if this was so.\u00a0 So be patient and stay separate as much as possible.\u00a0 Remember that as well as taking practical steps, there are spiritual solutions too.\nCreate a Ball of Light around you for protection.\u00a0 Make this ball of Christ Consciousness Golden Light and with sparkles of Archangel Michael's Blue of Protection.\u00a0 Fill the ball with the Adamantine\/Diamond Light of God\/Creator.\u00a0 In this way you will keep yourself in high vibration, so that low vibration cannot reach you.

        "text":"Jacob In Haran\n\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother\u2019s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother\u2019s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well\u2019s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother\u2019s brother.\u201d (Genesis 29:10)\n\nGenesis 29 opens up on the same high note which Genesis 28 closed with. \u201cJacob went on his journey\u201d, the King James Version tells us. The Hebrew literally reads that he \u201clifted up his feet\u201c, conveying the idea that Jacob is refreshed now and filled with a newness of strength and purpose. His direct encounter with the Lord God Who visited him through his dream the night before has definitely made a powerful impression on Jacob. He is not timid and lonely anymore, but seems to proceed with a fresh spring in his step; the heaviness of the fear of Esau now giving way to the encouragement that can only come from the confidence that God\u2019s mercy rests upon him.\n\nIn some ways, I wish that Genesis 29 was but a single verse in length because things go downhill from there. How many people have we known who have left a Sunday church service with a renewed zeal and purpose, their faces glowing with a revitalized passion for the things of God, only to return to business, as usual, come Monday morning? Even worse, the pricking of their own conscience and the convicting work of the Holy Spirit are now muffled by the illusion that all is well within them. For many, there is little doubt that the former state is preferable to the latter; since a solitary feasting at a banquet does little more for the starving man than satiate him for a short time, all the while further callousing his sensitivity to the hunger pangs by which he perishes.\n\nBut we are convinced of better things concerning Jacob. For God will call Jacob back to Bethel and will revive the wayward prodigal to Himself. But for now, unfortunately, Jacob must pass through some difficulties resultant of his reliance on self rather than trusting in the provision of God. Verse 2 of Genesis 29 begins to paint a familiar, yet somewhat dissimilar scene to one we read about in Genesis 24. A meeting at a well, a beautiful young girl, a man in search of a bride. But something is strangely absent this time, something is different. The humility and quiet determination of Eliezer, Abraham\u2019s servant, has been replaced by the headstrong recklessness of Jacob, Abraham\u2019s grandson. The observance of polite etiquette which Eliezer demonstrated stands in stark contrast to Jacob\u2019s brashness. Jacob presumptuously refers to strangers as \u201cmy brethren\u201d (v.4), and then proceeds to instruct them in how they ought to be conducting their business affairs (v. 7). To top it all off, Jacob takes it upon himself to move the stone guarding the well without being bidden or permitted to do so (v. 10)!\n\nI am sure that more than a few of the onlookers were a little shocked when this stranger threw himself upon Rachel and began to loudly sob (v. 11). It is obvious that Jacob was very enthusiastic and emotional about having arrived at his destination, but there seems to be more than mere social impropriety during Jacob\u2019s encounter with Rachel that set it in great variance to Eliezer\u2019s encounter with Rebekah years before:\n\n\u201cAnd [Eliezer] said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham\u2026And [Eliezer] bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.\u201d (Genesis 24:12, 26)\n\nNow, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that it was God\u2019s will for Jacob to marry Rachel, but I wonder if things might have ended a little more pleasantly for Jacob if he had been trusting more in God and less in his own abilities? Perhaps Jacob was relying on the direction of the Lord more than we are told in the narrative, but it sure doesn\u2019t look like it. God led Jacob to the exact spot where he ended up at the exact time he ended up there, but it doesn\u2019t appear that Jacob was fully understanding just how much God was directing things. Even Jacob\u2019s vow back in Genesis 28:20-21 seems a little \u201cwishy-washy.\u201d \u201cIf God will do this, if God will take care of me, if God will bring me back to my father\u2019s house\u2026\u201d God had already promised that He would do these things (Gen. 28:15)!\n\nSo, Jacob comes to the well where Rachel was bringing her father\u2019s herds filled with confidence and determination, but it sure doesn\u2019t seem to be a humble determination in God like Eliezer had. It looks a lot more like self-assuredness than a firm faith in God. But have we not all been guilty of such from time to time? We reach a spiritual mountaintop and have a very intimate encounter with our Lord, and then we come down from that mountaintop fully energized to face the trials of our lives. That is, face them in our own strength! God never told Jacob \u201cI will be with you so that you can do what I have spoken to you\u201d, no, He said \u201cBehold I am with thee\u2026I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of\u201d (Gen. 28:15 emphasis added). God doesn\u2019t tell us that He is going to strengthen us to accomplish His will in our lives, He tells us that He is going to accomplish His will in our lives. God did not appear to Jacob just so that Jacob would become a little more confident in his own abilities, to have a little greater trust in his own ingenuity. God appeared to Jacob in order that Jacob would be confident in the Lord\u2019s abilities and not continue to trust in his own. He does the same with us.\n\nTo Jesus Christ goes all glory.

        "text":"Sept. 24, 2019\n\nFarewell, Father John\n\nFrom Prometheus Writes! by Nathaniel Lindell (author's profile)\nThis post is in reply to comments on:\u00a0 Why Did I Do It? thumbnail\nWhy Did I Do It?\n(March 13, 2013)\n\n\nDate: 9\/19\/2019 11:55:36 PM\nSubject: Reply ID wa3r\n\nFarewell, Father John\ncreated 19 Sept. 2019\n\nThose of you following my blog know that I am an atheist, humanist and honest. I'm anti-deist, anti-inspired religion because of the many and outrageous degradations those belief systems have inflicted on people, causing witch burnings, pogroms, crusades, genocides, genital mutilations, whole ages of darkness\u2014ultimately because believers can't accept non-believers as full, fellow human beings.\n\nThis awareness on my part I can't pretend to not have, yet I have no problem embracing, relating with those who do believe, even remaining silent about my beliefs. So long as they don't try to evangelize me.\n\nYou also know I shoot straight, talk blunt, honestly in my writings.\n\nWell, I let Father John know that I'm trying to get in a Christian studies BA program yet reiterated that I'm an atheist and that atheists are in the program. Fr. John replied that he wanted me to stop saying that I'm a disbeliever, asked me to \"keep an open mind,\" after we already discussed this. He said he wouldn't try to reconvert me (I was raised Catholic, didn't have a choice in the matter). My response in relevant part is pasted below, followed by the results.\n\n\nHave you ever scrutinized Deceptions and Myths of the Bible or, more generally, The Psychology of Superstition? I have, along with world and European history books, the history and evolution of the world and European religions.\n\nFrom all of those studies, I KNOW that all sects of Christianity and other religions are man's invention, mostly male inventors too, which explains (partly) the peculiar phenomenon that the God individuals believe in tends to have a personality that the believer wants or needs psychologically. Some gods condemn homosexuality, other gods condone it, and both believers adamantly justify their views of their gods based on the same scripture.\n\nBut when someone like me points such things out, I'm evil or mean or some other ad hominem attack is used to ignore the truth I point out: people, mostly men, invent gods to server their typically subconscious purposes. Sometimes people invent gods (or religions) for more conscious purposes as maybe Constantine did (\"By this you will conquer\").\n\nBeing a morally conscientious person, I thus can't and won't fake belief not even to get the Pope's help. And it surprised me that you seemed to suggest that I do so. When younger and more ruthless, bro, I'dve faked the funk on you. And maybe you'd be happier believing the lie that I \"believe.\"\n\nAnyhoo, I ain't scared of studying Christianity. Are you scared of studying criticisms of religion, Christianity in particular?\n\nDoesn't matter what your religion is to me. Does my lack of religion make it... difficult to see me as a full, functional human being worthy of dignity and respect? I've no hangups, no biases, even though I KNOW that Catholics in particular have caused the deaths of tens of millions, easily, and justified that with their religion. Not to mention the torture inflicted on me in the name of Catholicism. It's too in the past for me to be angry about it, as you assume I am.\n\nI'm disappointed at humans such as yourself, who are intelligent and mean well yet are mentally blocked from objectively considering the POSSIBILITY that your beliefs are not valid, or worse, not caring because the \"beliefs\" serve a pragmatic purpose, not the act of desperation that compels some to embrace \"beliefs\" that they really don't believe in, in order to survive.\n\nI suspect that you believe I'm angry at God because you can't accept that a decentislmguyy can simply disregard a need to believe in God, so you assume there must be some reconcilable reason for my disbelief so I don't lose my eternal soul. Good intentions on your part. But I also don't believe in the Easter Bunny, one of the many Pagan components of Catholicism. And I'm not angry at it either.\n\nI am, however, dismayed and displeased at how powerful people, mostly men, use their positions to force their conceptions of God on the world and oppress people in the process, which I don't want you to feel guilty about. I don't intend to manipulate you into accepting me or my beliefs, nor do I need or want to persuade you of anything. I'm just attempting to correct your misperception about why I'm atheistic. Truth matters to me, and someone else's imagined deity is not the truth, even if they have a powerful machine backing them.\n\nAnyway, I can only beat that horse to death, bring it back to life, and beat it to death again so many times! :) Die, horse!\n\n\nMan, I'm not perfect, but I fail to grasp how this email is so horrible that Fr. John would block me. Yet block me he did\u2014without comment!\n\nThat's just foul.\n\nLike I said in another part of my email to Fr. John, \"I don't do dictators, especially of thoughts, my thoughts in particular.\" I don't dictate to either of my remaining close friends what to believe (one's a Jewish neuroscientist, the other's a French-English literature post grad), and I'm tired of people trying to \"save\" my soul by withdrawing their friendship when I don't accept their religion. Not the first time\u2014a girlfriend who wanted to have my baby did the same schtick!\n\nLet me be clear\u2014I AM AN ATHEIST! I'M NOT AFRAID TO BURN IN HELL! As some guy said on TV recently. YOU WILL NOT CONVERT ME.\n\nDon't write me expecting otherwise. Write me only if you're willing to take me as I am.\n\nGoodbye, Father John. Enjoy this free lesson in morality\u2014you're not the first priest in need of one.\n\n\nReplies Replies feed\n\nWe will print and mail your reply by .

        "text":"There is considerable interest in the topic of divine healing amongst Christians of most any denomination. While there are those Imagethat disagree with God\u2019s desire to heal people here and now, in times of crisis I have rarely seen a Christian person NOT pray for healing, suggesting that it is not a theologically sound idea.\n\nAs I have navigated the waters of divine healing over the years I have heard many ideas for and against and I have disagreed with some of the voices on both sides of the argument. Throughout the years I have also seen people prayed for and healed. Indeed I have prayed for people and have seen them healed. Many other times I have not seen them healed.\n\n\nWhat do we make of all of this then? Does God heal or doesn\u2019t he? Is it normal and expected or not? Should we \u2018get people\u2019s hopes up\u2019 that God might heal them and risk a drastic let down? How will this affect their perspective on God after the fact?\n\n\nI think that I finally have some answers for these questions. Biblically speaking, humanity was created in wholeness, without disease and decay. We were given direct access to the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, as the biblical narrative tells us. Essentially, humanity had the opportunity to be perpetually renewed through access to God, the giver of life. Something catastrophic took place, and humanity was placed at a distance from this Tree of Life\u2026at a distance positionally, relationally, and spiritually. This is where disease and death entered into human existence.\n\nIf we fast-forward to the end of all things as described in the Bible, we find a dramatic renewal of this Garden of Eden state; the coming of the kingdom of God as Scripture describes it. At this time our imperfectness will be made perfect and sickness and pain will be removed (Rev 21:4). This will be a literal heaven on earth situation where humanity\u2019s relationship with the life giver, with God himself, will be unhindered once again. The kingdom of God (or of heaven, depending on the biblical author) will have come to stay.\n\nHumanity finds itself today living between this \u201cGarden of Eden\u201d state and the complete coming of the Kingdom of God. Many important things have happened spiritually throughout the past thousands of years and it seems that we are approaching a time when death, disease and decay will be removed from all of human existence\u2026but we are not fully there yet. So, where do we stand in terms of God\u2019s healing here and now, even today?\n\n\nLets consider for a moment that the approaching Kingdom of God is like a movie that is highly anticipated but not yet released. For example, the sequel to the movie \u201cHunger Games\u201d is highly anticipated by many people. Prior to the release we will see posters, trailers, and advertisements\u2026all aimed to stir some measure of passion and anticipation for the movie. In fact, the purpose of a movie trailer is to give you just enough of a taste of the movie to keep you wanting and anticipating the day when the full movie will finally be released.\n\nI believe that we are living in a day when the Kingdom of God is breaking in here and there with evidence of divine healing and a number of spiritual gifts and manifestations with the purpose of pointing us to the coming merger of the present world with the coming Kingdom of God. What we can expect from God today is a regular \u2018breaking in\u2019 of the Kingdom of God just like a movie trailer would crop up here and there to show us a little piece of what the movie will be all about once it is released. This is actually quite biblical when we read what John the Baptist said about Jesus (\u201c\u2026the Kingdom of heaven has come near\u201d Matt 3:2) and what Jesus himself says in the Lord\u2019s Prayer (\u201c\u2026thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven\u201d). These and many other Scriptures point to the approaching Kingdom of God that is indeed breaking in but has not yet completely arrived.\n\n\nWith these thoughts in mind we are better suited to answer the questions I posed earlier.\n\nDoes God heal or doesn\u2019t he? Yes, God heals, even today.\n\nIs it normal and expected or not? Everyone will not be healed in this present day, although we should not place limits on what God may decide to do in our life or our church.\n\nShould we \u2018get people\u2019s hope up\u2019 that God might heal them and risk a drastic let down? We should teach people what the Scriptures say about healing and then invite them to the truth of God in this life whether they are healed or not.\n\nHow will this affect their perspective on God after the fact? I am sure that some will scoff at the fact that all are not healed. I am sure that some will suggest that it is because God is not that great and the whole thing is a farce. I think, however, that in some matters (such as this one) God is big enough to defend himself and will do so in good time.\n\nI have a few other thoughts on divine healing that I want to share and I will do so in the coming days. For now, think about this: when you see the Kingdom of God breaking in here and there but maybe not where you are at the moment, do not get discouraged and assume there is something defective about your faith, about your church, or about your pastoral leadership. Rather, rejoice that the Kingdom of God is active in our world. Celebrate with those who are healed and make the name of Jesus famous. And\u2026never, ever loose the hope that God\u2019s Kingdom can indeed break into your life and into your church at any moment of any day.\n\n\nJames 5:13-16\n\n13\u00a0Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. 14\u00a0Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. 15\u00a0And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. 16\u00a0Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.",

Pastor Hal is a wise, bubbly, inspirational communicator who has helped aid both CLC\u2019s growth and my own personal growth, an area that I wasn\u2019t really giving enough attention to. I\u2019m so glad that I signed up and am looking forward to combing through the teaching again to deepen my learning and strengthen our application.

        "text":"By \u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 July 14, 2008 \u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Topics: ,\n\n\nOur church is looking for a new pastor, and I've been put on the search committee (something I've never had to do before). Our first task is to come up with a description of the kind of person we should look for. What advice would you give to a committee like ours?\n\n\nYou\u2019ve been given a very important responsibility \u2014 and the best advice I can give you is to seek God\u2019s will as you seek to fill this position. Pray for God\u2019s guidance in your committee, and encourage your whole church to be praying as well.\n\nAfter all, someone might meet every standard on your list \u2014 but if they aren\u2019t the person God wants in that position, their ministry will not make its maximum impact. Remember: God is even more concerned about your church and its ministry than you are, and He has already chosen the person best equipped to lead your church in the future.\n\nWhat kind of person should you seek? You know your church\u2019s needs, of course, and your description will take those into account. But first of all seek a person of godly character \u2014 someone who reflects Christ in their daily life. Paul urged his young pastor friend Timothy to \u201cpursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness\u201d (1 Timothy 6:11).\n\nSecond, seek someone who will make the Bible the foundation of their teaching and preaching. Paul\u2019s example is a challenge to every pastor: \u201cYou know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you. \u2026 For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God\u201d (Acts 20:20, 27).\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published but you will receive our next BGEA ministry update. You can opt out of future emails at any time.\n\n\n  1. Danny Stevens says:\n\n    I am on our Pastor search committee and I have never been ask to do anything like this before but finding these words has greatly touch me. Thanks for sharing and thanks to Mr. Billy Grahams for his unselfish sharing of Gods word and service over the years. God Bless\n\n  2. fran koebert says:\n\n    i think we will be looking for a pastor \u2013 our pastor is on life support and a decision is going to be made today \u2013 he is a true man of God and has taught and preached word for word straight from the Bible \u2013 he is a warrior- he is fearless \u2013 he is a retired marine \u2013 he has led many to the cross \u2013 it is a heart wrenching decision the family is thinking about because the doctors have suggested it \u2013 miracles do happen \u2013 right now the only plan b is in God\u2019s hands \u2013 we are a small country church\n\n    1. fran koebert says:\n\n      your answer is exactly the one i expected as that is the way we have been taught as kids over 70 years now \u2013 sadly this church does not even know what a pulpit committee is \u2013 some how the right pastor for this church must stumble into it the same way we found this church \u2013 you are right \u2013 God has the right person for this church so somehow God will show either the right way which begins with earnest prayer or the right person finds his way here \u2013 our pastor passed away early this morning shortly after the one person he cared about most showed up to see him \u2013 his son \u2013 he was thrilled and rallied for a short time then passed on \u2013 something good will happen \u2013 we will just wait for God\u2019s plan to kick in",

The festival is celebrated about nine days prior to Diwali, specifically on Kartik ki Chauth. Married women pray for the wellbeing of their husband, on the day. Special puja is conducted in the evening, while women sing songs on the praise of the festival. Traditionally, one song is sung, when the women see the reflection of the moon in a thali of water. This song is known as Karwa Chauth Ark song. Another song, known as Karva Chauth thali song, is sung when women gather in circle, perform Karwa Chauth puja and rotate their thali.

        "text":"Eating The White Cake Of The Word Of God \/ Severe Water Shortage! \u2013 Humbled for Service\n\n\nEating The White Cake Of The Word Of God \/ Severe Water Shortage!\n\nDecember 17, 2020 8:46 AM\nHumbled for Service\n\nPsalm 119: 49 \u2013 50\n\n49\u00a0Remember the word to Your servant,\nUpon which You have caused me to hope.\n50\u00a0This\u00a0is\u00a0my\u00a0comfort in my affliction,\nFor Your word has given me life.\n\n\nI received these two short dreams on the morning of the 13th\u00a0December 2020.\n\nThese two dreams are important for the believers today. I believe that the Lord is asking us to dwell on reading of His Word, even as we watch unfolding events.\n\nDream 1: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eating The White Cake Of The Word Of God!\n\nIn the dream, I found myself inside an ultramodern boardroom. I was seated together with about 10 to 15 young executives at the boardroom table. The seats we sat on were high back executive chairs made of leather. The conference table was long and it was dark brown in color. The walls were soft white or cream in color and there was nothing else painted or hanging on them. There was one long window in front of the side where I sat. And the blinds of this window were of the same color as the wall. The blinds were drawn so that I was not able to see outside the room.\n\nEvery inch of the floor was carpeted with a cream fury carpet. There was a screen on my right, which was the front of the conference room, and the entrance door was on my right too.\n\nThe executives all wore shiny black suits. And hard dark grey or black shirts and blouses. Looking at them gave the impression of a funeral, as though someone had just been buried. That\u2019s what I thought inside the dream.\n\nWe were all seated and silent. There was a whisper here and there as some chatted with the nearby person. The table was completely clean. There was nothing on it apart from some of the arms that were resting on the table. There seemed to be no agenda, and frankly I did not understand why we were there and what we were waiting for.\n\nSuddenly a Man opened the conference door and entered. In His right hand he had a white cake made of white maize (corn) meal. The white cake was on a white plate. The Man came to my right side and placed the cake in front of me, over my right shoulder. He did not say a Word, but left immediately.\n\nI began to break with my hands, and eat of this white cake. It was warm and well cooked. I continued to break of it and put it into my mouth and chew and swallow.\n\nAs I began to eat the cake, I could see some of the executives looking at me wondering what I was doing. Some even started pointing their finger at me, and sneering. But this did not deter me. I kept eating until there was no more cake on the plate.\n\nThe dream ended and another began.\n\n\nThis is what I believe is the meaning of this dream:\n\nThe conference room is the modern world we are now living in. And the executives are its inhabitants. The windows are closed, so that the inhabitants of this world cannot see what is happening around them. What is available to them is \u201cprojected images\u201d from the screen. (This is with the exception of those who have the Holy Spirit.)\n\nTheir black funeral attire signifies death (physical and eternal) that is coming to those who will not believe in the Word of God.\n\nThe Man who brought the white cake is the Holy Spirit, and the white cake is the Word of God, pure and clean. I believe that the Holy Spirit is telling us to dwell on the Scriptures, even as we are watching on the unfolding events.\n\nThe finger pointing and the sneering of the executives, is the mockery and scoffing that the true preachers of the Word of God are suffering, as they try to break the pure Word of God to others in this world.\n\n\nDream 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Severe Water Shortage!\n\nIn this dream, I saw a very long queue of people waiting in the line to get water. The line was long, perhaps as long as a kilometer or a mile from the point where the water was available.\n\nSome of those who had come to look for water were having as many as 20 jerry cans.\n\nI saw a man fainting on the line out of exhaustion. I also felt that he was very hungry, having not had anything to eat for a substantial amount of time.\n\nThe dream ended.\n\n\nThis dream I believe is literal in its meaning. I believe there is coming a major water shortage around the world.\n\nBut I think too there is another meaning to this dream. And that it why it has come together with the previous one. I believe there is coming to the world, a thirst for the pure unadulterated Word of God. And this comes after the Lord removes His Holy Spirit, and the Bride from the world.\n\n\nVision of the Summer Fruit\n\nAmos 8: 11 \u2013 12\n\n11\u00a0\u201cBehold, the days are coming,\u201d says the Lord\u00a0God,\n\u201cThat I will send a famine on the land,\nNot a famine of bread,\nNor a thirst for water,\nBut\u00a0of hearing the words of the\u00a0Lord.\n12\u00a0They shall wander from sea to sea,\nAnd from north to east;\nThey shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the\u00a0Lord,\nBut shall\u00a0not find\u00a0it.\n\n\nSatan Tempts Jesus\n\nMatthew 4: 1 \u2013 4\n\n1\u00a0Then\u00a0Jesus was led up by\u00a0the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.\u00a0And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.\u00a0Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, \u201cIf You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.\u201d\n\nBut He answered and said,\u00a0\u201cIt is written,\u00a0\u2018Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\n\nThe Purpose of Parables\n\nMatthew 13: 10 \u2013 17\n\n10\u00a0And the disciples came and said to Him, \u201cWhy do You speak to them in parables?\u201d\n\n11\u00a0He answered and said to them,\u00a0\u201cBecause\u00a0it has been given to you to know the\u00a0mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.\u00a012\u00a0For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.\u00a013\u00a0Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.\u00a014\u00a0And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says:\n\n\u2018Hearing you will hear and shall not understand,\nAnd seeing you will see and not\u00a0perceive;\n15\u00a0For the hearts of this people have grown dull.\nTheir\u00a0ears\u00a0are hard of hearing,\nAnd their eyes they have\u00a0closed,\nLest they should see with\u00a0their\u00a0eyes and hear with\u00a0their\u00a0ears,\nLest they should understand with\u00a0their\u00a0hearts and turn,\nSo that I\u00a0should\u00a0heal them.\u2019\n\n16\u00a0But\u00a0blessed\u00a0are\u00a0your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear;\u00a017\u00a0for assuredly, I say to you\u00a0that many prophets and righteous\u00a0men\u00a0desired to see what you see, and did not see\u00a0it,\u00a0and to hear what you hear, and did not hear\u00a0it.\n\nWishing you all God\u2019s blessings.
