Neither shalt thou commit adultery.\u00a0 Neither shalt thou steal.\u00a0 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.\u00a0 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour\u2019s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour\u2019s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbour\u2019s.\u00a0 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more.\u00a0 And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.\u201d\u00a0 (Deut 5:1-22)\n\nIn the days when the Lord God brought the children of Israel out from under the bondage of Egypt, he made a covenant with them and delivered his commandments through his servant Moses, on tablets of stone.\u00a0 Instructed by the Lord, Moses went atop Mount Sinai where he spent 40 days and 40 nights in the presence of the Lord, and there he \u201cwrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments\u201d (Ex 34:28) as given to him by the Lord to deliver to the people. The basic principals for living a life righteously, and pleasing before the Lord, was etched in stone and given to Moses to give to Israel, that they may learn, observe and do all that was written and commanded.\u00a0 The breaking of these laws would render judgment, and the keeping of these laws would render blessings. \u00a0 Thus, Moses shared with the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded being the mediator between them and the Lord as written in Deut 5:5.\u00a0 When the children of Israel had need of instruction or prayer, it was Moses who went to the Lord on their behalf and likewise, the Lord who chose to deliver His Word to the people through his servant Moses.\u00a0 The Laws given to Moses by God, were regularly broken by the children of Israel, thus atonement for their sins had to be made on a consistent basis.\u00a0 They found it difficult to heed to all that was written on the tablets of stone.\n\nBut, then came Jesus who demonstrated a more excellent way to fulfilling the laws of God that were written in stone, by writing them in our hearts in the form of Love.\u00a0 He summed the entire written laws into two MAJOR commandments being: \u201cThou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, all thy soul and all thy mind\u201d following with \u201cThou shalt Love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Of which he concluded: On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d \u00a0 If we examine the first four of the written ten commandments, we will notice they deal strictly with our Love for the Father.\u00a0 For they instruct us to: have no other Gods before Him; to make no graven images or likeness of anything in heaven, on earth, or in the waters to bow down and serve them, to Not take His Name in vain, and the keeping of the Sabbath. If we adhere to the Greatest commandment of Loving the Lord our God with all our hearts, souls and minds, we would then automatically fulfill these four of the ten commandments.\u00a0 In like manner, the last 6 of the ten commandments given to Moses, deal mostly with our love and responsibility towards others as they instruct us to: Honour our father and mother; not to kill; not to commit adultery; not to steal; not to bear false witness against our neighbor; and not to covet that which is our neighbors. \u00a0 Thus, if we heed to the second commandment given by our Lord to love our neighbor as ourselves, we would then automatically fulfill these last six of the ten commandments.\u00a0 Therefore, we can conclude that LOVE is the FULFILLMENT of the LAW!\u00a0\n\nIf we truly love our Father, then we would do whatever is necessary to please Him. We would not allow our minds, to control our behavior, but our hearts.\u00a0 If we notice the command was to Love the Lord our God in this order: OUR HEARTS (FIRST), SOUL (SECOND) AND MIND LAST.\u00a0 However many attempt to love Him in opposite order being the MIND (FIRST), SOUL (SECOND) and finally attempt to love him with the HEART!\u00a0 This is why we fail, for we cannot love him first with our MINDS, but MUST begin by first loving Him with our SPIRITS (HEARTS), which stirs up the love for him in our SOULS (where all our emotions lie), and finally the MIND comprehends and receives.\u00a0 All working together, we are then loving our beloved Father with our whole being, with every part of us that makes up for who we are.\n\nLikewise, if we truly love our neighbor, we would then treat him\/her as we ourselves desire to be treated. If TRUE love would abide in our hearts for each other, it would prevent us from speaking unkindly towards one another and gossiping about one another; from becoming bitter; angry and vindictive towards one another; from lying on and to one another; and from esteeming one above the other. It would prevent us from tearing one another down, and would cause us to deliberately lift one another up.\u00a0 It would erase entirely feelings of jealousy, hate, insecurity, prejudice and all manner of evil thinking towards our brothers and sisters that many attempt to tuck secretly away, believing they are hidden yet are exposed by their fruits or lack of.\u00a0 If love truly existed in the hearts of believers for one another, before the thought would ever arrive in our minds to mistreat, to gossip, or speak unkindly of our fellow man, the power of Love would instantly come and overtake it!\u00a0 If we have not love for one another, we have NOT Christ for there is NO possible way the Spirit of the Lord can reside in a heart that has even an OUNCE of hate towards it\u2019s fellow man.\u00a0 Thus, before we boast of our \u201cgreat Love\u201d for the Lord, let us examine our hearts to determine if we have surrendered completely to the second commandment to Love our neighbor as ourselves, for we cannot truly and sincerely love the Lord whom we\u2019ve not seen, and hate our brother whom we have!\n\nWe cannot fulfill the will of the Lord for our lives individually, as well as collectively without Love. Oftentimes, we place such great emphasis on trying to be \u201cperfect\u201d in keeping the commandments of God, and consistently fail at our attempts.\u00a0 We set out daily with a conscious effort to do everything right, but lose the battle because we lack the substance, the heart of the law, that being Love.\u00a0\u00a0 When love is present and active in our hearts, it locks the doors of temptation to sin against God.\u00a0 Our Love for Him is inevitably proven GREATER than our desire to fulfill the evils of our flesh. \u00a0\n\nTherefore, the one thing that\u2019s required to fulfill the commandments of the Lord, before anything else, even faith, is LOVE.\u00a0 FIRST loving the Lord our God, and second loving our neighbor as we do ourselves. If we without question KNOW the Lord,\u00a0 and if He without question is absolute LORD of our lives, then the law of LOVE by Him has been \u201cwritten in our hearts\u201d and blessed are they that keep it!\n\nI love you all so very much. Have a blessed week in the Lord and remember: Whatever we do, do ALL for the GLORY of GOD, who ALONE is worthy of the GLORY and the PRAISE!\n\nMay the peace of the Lord be with you today and always\u2026\u2026.\n\nlittlerose.gif (186 bytes) Khandieleselittlerose.gif (186 bytes)\nDaughter & Servant\n\u00a0\u00a0 of the Lord God\n\u00a0 rose13.gif (10213 bytes)\n\nFind true peace now.\nFind True Peace Now\n\nprayer.gif (3860 bytes)\nNeed Prayer?

It is not a bona fide or leg itimate theology, but the polar opposite thereof. Its destructive aims mirror those of Marxism, which can only be understood if the demonic spirit of Marx is seen as its real origin. The Kairos Document and the Road to Damascus replaced the biblical God with the anti-god of Marx, the deified proletariat and the deified revolution. The article calls for a reconversion to God who revealed himself in Jesus Christ of Scriptures. Orthodox theology is truly \u2018thisworldly\u2019 theology, since it offers real hope and salvation. The Marxist gospel can only offer a utopia, a \u2018no-place\u2019. It is self-alienating, world-aUenating and God-alienating.\n\n\nNo related keywords in the metadata.\n\n\nTotal abstract views: 1244\nTotal article views: 934\n\nCrossref Citations\n\nNo related citations found.",

But still.\n\nOtherwise, it was a wild, rainy, windy drive down the hill, with the leaves swirling down in front of me and dancing under the wheels of the other cars. At church, there was a group praying on this Veterans Day, so we went about our setup quietly. We have a nice rhythm and routine as we get the church ready for Sunday. The presence light creaks down on its metal cord and is doused, then is replaced and cranks up again.\n\nThe only annoying aspect to altar guild is that the hymn numbers are not big enough for their slots on the hymn boards and flutter down to the floor as soon as they are put in place. Someone bakes our Communion bread, so there is always (except once!) a ready supply in the freezer.\n\nIt's soothing to be in the nave, with the only light coming in through the stained glass. Mundane activities become meditative. . .\n\nNo comments:",

Constitutional amendments to strengthen minority rights and legislation for the implementation of constitutional guarantees;\n  2. Adequately financed and rationally conceived programs designed to facilitate the voluntary return of the country's refugees;\n  3. National Commission for Minority Affairs to promote peaceful dialogue between religious and ethnic groups;\n  4. A University in Nineveh Province;\n  5. Security for vulnerable minority communities;\n  6. Fulfillment of Iraq's obligation to respect international human rights instruments;\n  7. Increased representation of Christians in the federal and state parliaments; and\n  8. Increased investment in the infrastructure of previously marginalized areas populated mainly by minorities.\n\nDr. John Eibner, CEO of CSI's U.S. affiliate warned that the prospect of extinction still faces Iraq's ancient Christian community, and would do so until violent persecution ceases and basic human rights are guaranteed in word and deed.\n\nIn an interview with Iraq's Mosuli TV, Eibner noted that the considerable progress providing security in Mosul and surrounding Nineveh Province during the past year is reversible.\n\nSince the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, nearly half of Iraq's approximately one million Christians have been forced by violence to flee the country, while many other remain in Iraq as destitute Internally Displaced People.\n\nThe Governor of Nineveh Province, Athil Al-Najifi, in his role as Conference Patron, announced that outside interference and instrumentalization of minorities in Nineveh is coming to an end, and expressed willingness to establish a mechanism, including all elements of civil society, to defend minority rights.\n\nWilliam Warda, President of the Hammurabi Human Rights Organization (HHRO) claimed that neither the Iraqi nor the American governments are acting with sufficient energy and foresight to end the violent persecution of Iraq's Christians and to create conditions for the return of refugees.\n\nThe Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Kirkuk, Louis Sako, urged Christians not to leave Iraq, emphasizing the need for an enduring Christian witness in the country.\n\nThe Conference was co-sponsored by CSI and by HHRO.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nChristian Solidarity International (CSI)\nElliott Daniels (919) 440-9729, elliott.daniels < a t>\n\nAlert \u00a0 IP Print \u00a0\u00a0Edit\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reply\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Re-Quote Top\n\nForums Topics\u00a0 Previous Topic Next Topic\n\nAssyria \\\u00e3-'sir-\u00e9-\u00e4\\ n (1998)\u00a0\u00a0 1:\u00a0 an ancient empire of Ashur\u00a0\u00a0 2:\u00a0 a democratic state in Bet-Nahren, Assyria (northern Iraq, northwestern Iran, southeastern Turkey and eastern Syria.)\u00a0\u00a0 3:\u00a0 a democratic state that fosters the social and political rights to all of its inhabitants irrespective of their religion, race, or gender\u00a0\u00a0 4:\u00a0 a democratic state that believes in the freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture in faithfulness to the principles of the United Nations Charter \u2014 Atour synonym\n\nEthnicity, Religion, Language\n\u00bb Israeli, Jewish, Hebrew\n\u00bb Assyrian, Christian, Aramaic\n\u00bb Saudi Arabian, Muslim, Arabic\nAssyrian \\\u00e3-'sir-\u00e9-an\\ adj or n (1998)\u00a0\u00a0 1:\u00a0 descendants of the ancient empire of Ashur\u00a0\u00a0 2:\u00a0 the Assyrians, although representing but one single nation as the direct heirs of the ancient Assyrian Empire, are now doctrinally divided, inter sese, into five principle ecclesiastically designated religious sects with their corresponding hierarchies and distinct church governments, namely, Church of the East, Chaldean, Maronite, Syriac Orthodox and Syriac Catholic.\u00a0 These formal divisions had their origin in the 5th century of the Christian Era.\u00a0 No one can coherently understand the Assyrians as a whole until he can distinguish that which is religion or church from that which is nation -- a matter which is particularly difficult for the people from the western world to understand; for in the East, by force of circumstances beyond their control, religion has been made, from time immemorial, virtually into a criterion of nationality.\u00a0\u00a0 3:\u00a0 the Assyrians have been referred to as Aramaean, Aramaye, Ashuraya, Ashureen, Ashuri, Ashuroyo, Assyrio-Chaldean, Aturaya, Chaldean, Chaldo, ChaldoAssyrian, ChaldoAssyrio, Jacobite, Kaldany, Kaldu, Kasdu, Malabar, Maronite, Maronaya, Nestorian, Nestornaye, Oromoye, Suraya, Syriac, Syrian, Syriani, Suryoye, Suryoyo and Telkeffee. \u2014 Assyrianism verb\n\nAramaic \\ar-\u00e9-'m\u00e1ik\\ n (1998)\u00a0\u00a0 1:\u00a0 a Semitic language which became the lingua franca of the Middle East during the ancient Assyrian empire.\u00a0\u00a0 2:\u00a0 has been referred to as Neo-Aramaic, Neo-Syriac, Classical Syriac, Syriac, Suryoyo, Swadaya and Turoyo.\n\nPlease consider the environment when disposing of this material \u2014 read, reuse, recycle. \u267b\nAIM | Atour: The State of Assyria | Terms of Service",

        "text":"by Jerry Shugart\n\nVII. Type and Antitype: Regeneration\n\nIn the book Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church Progressive Dispensationalist Bruce A. Ware quotes Homer A. Kent, Jr., extensively in order to attempt to prove that that there exists only one New Diatheke. Even though Dr. Kent believes that there is only one New Diatheke he does understand that it is in regard to \"spiritual regeneration.\" He also understands the distinction between an \"individual\" believer's spiritual regeneration as opposed to the spiritual regeneration of the \"nation\" of Israel:\n\n\"The essence of the new covenant is spiritual regeneration, enjoyed now by Christian believers and prophesied for national Israel at the second coming of Christ\" (Kent,\"The New Covenant and the Church,\" Grace Theological Journal, 6:2, Fall, 1985, p.290).\n\nType: The Regeneration of the Nation of Israel\n\nArnold G. Fruchtenbaum understands that there will be a \"national regeneration\" of Israel, writing that \"The basis of Israel's final regeneration is the New Covenant in Jeremiah 31:31-34...The result of the New Covenant will be a total national regeneration of Israel...That Israel was to undergo a national regeneration is not confined to the words of the New Covenant alone. The truths of the New Covenant are greatly elaborated by various prophets\" [emphasis added] (Fruchtenbaum, Israel in the Messianic Kingdom).\n\nIn the thirty-seventh chapter of the book of Ezekiel we see the prophet taken to a valley full of \"dry bones\" and these bones are described as \"the whole house of Israel\":\n\n\"The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones...Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts\" (Ez.37:1,11).\n\nCharles H. Dyer says, \"To what did this vision refer? God said it was about the nation of Israel (the whole house of Israel) that was then in captivity\" [emphasis added] (Walvoord & Zuck, The Bible Knowledge Commentary; Old Testament [Colorado Springs: ChariotVictor Publishing, 1985], p.1298).\n\nThen in the verses which follow we see the two elements which will be instrumental for the future corporate regeneration of Israel:\n\n\" Again he said to me, 'Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD'. Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause spirit to enter you, and you shall live\" (Ezek.37:4-5; RSVCE).\n\nThe regeneration of the \"nation\" of Israel is a blessing under the New Diatheke promised to the \"nation\" of Israel. It is a \"type\" of the regeneration of the \"individual\" believer. Under Israel's New Covenant that nation will be regenerated by the Spirit and the word of God:\n\n\"As for me, this is my covenant (diatheke) with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever\" (Isa.59:21).\n\nAntitype: The Regeneration of the Individual Believer\n\nWhen speaking of \"individuals\" the Lord Jesus said:\n\n\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live\" (Jn.5:25).\n\nThe Lord Jesus also said the following which makes it abundantly plain that the two elements responsible for bringing life is the word of God and the Spirit:\n\n\"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\" (Jn.6:64).\n\nDefinition of a Type\n\nDonald K. Campbell writes that \"it should be observed that a type presents a general though genuine resemblance of its antitype\" (Campbell, \"The Interpretation of Types,\" Bibliotheca Sacra [Volume 112 Issue 447, 1955], p. 254)\n\nThe Scriptures make it clear that the \"national\" regeneration of Israel presents a genuine resemblance to an \"individual\" believer's regeneration. It will be the word of God and the Spirit which will regenerate corporate Israel and it is the word of God and the Spirit which regenerates individuals. Therefore, there is no doubt that a typological relationship exists between the two.\n\n\n1\u00a0\u00a0 2\u00a0\u00a0 3\u00a0\u00a0 4\u00a0\u00a0 5\u00a0\u00a0 6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 8\u00a0\u00a0 9\u00a0\u00a0 10\u00a0\u00a0 11\u00a0\u00a0 12\u00a0\u00a0 13\u00a0\u00a0 14\u00a0\u00a0 15\u00a0\u00a0 16",

        "text":"Saturday, December 26, 2015\n\nTeresa Scott ~ Astral Avatars ~ Becoming Beacons of Light on Treacherous shores\n\nYou can be on the cusp of something.\nAppreciate the cusp, not the something.\nAppreciate this moment now.\nErnest Holmes\n\nAs 2015 begins to slip away, we can feel the rise of 2016\u2019s patterns, potentials, and rites of passage, including a need to de-clutter both our outer and inner lives, to shed karma and increase service, to discard destructive judgments, and to master the tidal waves of impermanence.\n\nIn the 2016 we will be deeply investigating all of these initiatory cycles, in addition to each Mercury retrograde cycle, the Mars Retrograde and 4 transformative Eclipses (dates listed below). This is the year where you must step into the Teacher you have become, but truly, what do you Believe, and what motivates you to Realize your Dream and feel empowered for the transformative year ahead. Focus on your dream and you will bypass the minutia and subterfuge of others drama.\n\nWhat is happening now, as we move to a more telescopic view, getting an overview of the bigger picture \u2013 we are healing the cataclysm between Lumeria and Atlantis. The division is realized in our timeline as a separation between science and spirituality, between experiential reality and \u2018factual\u2019 reality, and the rift between technology\/industrialization versus nature\u2019s way.\n\nThe present 3D incarnated tribes of light are on both sides of the spiritual spectrum and therefore it is important that the massive collective race memory be purified and cleared \u2013 for ourselves and all of earth.\n\nWe are all in for an interesting ride in 2016 (a 9 year of completions) as we all let go of separateness and begin to merge and blend the polar opposites of ideologies - mind, will & emotions, body, soul & spirit!\n\nThe ReGenesis Elohim Team\u00a0has asked for the gathering of qualified individuals who have been through personal and soul-collective initiation, who are ready to engage their master keycodes, gatekeeper codes and signature encodement and come together for healing & training, to be of service in light working in the astral plane, 4D.\n\nWe are called Astral Avatars by the ReGenesis Team and have incarnated, enduring sometimes brutal life experiences and astral\/entity invasion and harassment. My list of outrageous tampering, etc is similar to many I have worked with \u2013 not fun, but necessary to train us to be fearless, to be balanced in chaos and anchored in adeptness in eluding lower density agendas.\n\nAstral Avatars\u00a0\u2013\u00a0uniting the tribes of light\u00a0\u2013 is a community endeavor to positively empowering the spiritual journey of a billion souls.\u00a0 This has already begun here in the Heartland of the US - Kansas City!\n\nOur next Astral Avatar Gathering is January 9th\u00a0\u2013 time and location to be\n\nBe purposeful with your thoughts and emotions\u00a0in the coming days and more consistently with each passing moment, holding firm to the initiate\u2019s parameters.\n\nIn the book, Light on the Path, there are four statements that have been used for centuries by Initiates via meditation and inner concentration. Their meaning is profound and many-sided:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the eyes can see, they must be incapable of tears.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the ear can hear, it must have lost its sensitiveness.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the voice can speak in the presence of the masters, it must have lost the power to wound.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBefore the soul can stand in the presence of the masters, its feet must be washed in the blood of the heart.\u201d\n\nThese four statements have mystical power. But we must bring them to life within us; we must love them and let them guide us, as the needed railing on the precarious bridge between the mind, into the heart.\n\nWe must become anchored in the heart as our new interpretation center. \u00a0All must be perceived from this level in order to see all that is, so that we can become all that we are.\n\nWe have arrived at a powerful juncture in our collective journey. \u00a0We are on the cusp of \u2018something\u2019- struggling to appreciate the passage and not worry about the outcome. The passage between the 12-12 gateway and\u00a0January 17th\u00a0will be a highly transformative for those completing the Resurrection phase, as all unfolds seamlessly. \u00a0Higher echelon blueprints are unfolding by divine design, as the Beacons of Light (Wayshowers) become the guardians of the New Light.\n\nThe Beacons of Light\u00a0are like Light Houses on treacherous shores;\u00a0they are Humble, Devout, Peaceful and Powerful\u00a0Beings\n\nThere are Gatekeepers, Wayshowers, Gridworkers and Lightworkers of the True Light who are entrusted with Divine service - the sacred path to\u00a0become Guardians of the New Light. On a grounded level the challenges to that power, peace and service can be\u00a0plentiful in order for us to find strength and doubtless devotion to Source; a deep inner dedication to Love.\n\n\nNature holds a mirror for the possibilities of composure, who in all changes of weather and seasons has found a way to be resilient. \u00a0T. Scott\u00a9\n\nThere is little room for doubt \u2013 the Holidays can be challenging.\u00a0 I am traveling over the next week and I will be wearing a 'cloak of composure', deep down knowing there is an adventure contained in the journey.\n\nIf you are traveling during the Holidays, wishing you safety, surety, sanity and undisturbed composure,\n\nMay the candle you ignite this holiday season reflect the light of the Beloved.\u00a0 May that light remind you of the risen Solstice Sun within, about to emerge, illuminating its intentions in the 2016 year of Re-Genesis.\u00a0Teresa\n\nEclipses in 2016\n\nMarch 8, 2016\u00a0- Total Solar\nMarch 23, 2016\u00a0- Lunar Penumbra\nSeptember 1, 2016\u00a0- Annual Solar 'Golden' Ring\nSeptember 16, 2016\u00a0- Lunar Penumbra Eclipse\u00a0\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 ReGenesis, All rights reserved.\nYou are receiving this email because you opted in at our website.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Monday, January 21, 2013\n\nIt's My Life, Episode 3: They Call it Transition...\n\nTo some, this may not be a big deal, but to's been a 4 month in the making big deal. There is a culture that is perpetuated by us, the Mormon's.\u00a0 It's a culture within the culture, one that I've been a part of for the last 13 years of my life, one that most people only step into for a couple years and then successfully bow out of by way of what has been pegged a \"graduation\" of sorts, it typically involves a blushing bride and handsome groom.\u00a0 The crowning success that YSA bishops track with tick marks on the office white board or a \"Wall O Success\" displaying all wedding announcements from their tenure.\n\nI WAS one of them, I was a YSA, young single adult, now technically the \"Y\" in the equation has been removed and now I'm a SA, single adult. Unfortunately I was not a graduate, but fortunately my tenure was one of the longest allowed. I have had so many unique opportunities to serve.\u00a0 I have been able to do things that have stretched and pulled me in ways I would not necessarily have thought possible.\u00a0 I was SPORTS Co-Chair for Heavens sake!\u00a0 I don't play sports, I know sports but I don't play them, I had the time of my life. Sacrament meetings were silent, allowing for great thinking time, I've had my share of free meals at mingles every other week.\u00a0 I could go on, but you just can't explain the culture until you live it\n\nSo this brings me to the transition part of this message,\u00a0 I was out, it was my time to transition.\u00a0 It was scary for me, so I hung on as long as I could, I felt comfortable, productive, helpful, and needed in the YSA ward.\u00a0 But I finally decided, January was the right time, a\u00a0 new year, a new ward.\u00a0 The family ward was it.\u00a0 I know I have a place, I know I belong but sometimes knowing it and feeling it are different, it takes time.\u00a0 I know my talents, I know my abilities, I know I can get along with people, I know I have the capacity to serve faithfully in whatever calling. But it doesn't make it easy.\n\nEnter the Kenwood 1st Ward.\u00a0 If you want an example of how to make one such as me feel welcome, you may consult the Kenwood 1st ward.\u00a0 A huge blessing. They have got it right and my prayers have been answered, and to those who have said hello, stopped me in the hall, sent me a quick e-mail, remembered my name and sat by me, I thank you.\u00a0 I once was the one on the flip side of this, the one who felt I needed to seek out those who needed a friend, now, I'm the needy one and this is how Heavenly Father takes care of everyone, through others.\u00a0 I now understand a bit more and my life is better, much better and I'm going to love my new ward home. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, transitions can be hard, and may involve tears, but in the midst of the transition you find blessings, it took me 4 months to be okay with my change in status from a YSA to Wendy, I'm not a single adult named Wendy, I'm just Wendy. It's simple, and I like it.\n\nA few unrelated photos just have to balance out the words with photos.\u00a0 It's necessary.\n\n\u00a031 and living up the D-Land dream. Happiest place on earth especially with a 4 year old.\u00a0 It really was magical for the kiddos.\u00a0 Well, most of the time...\n\n\u00a0The new Princess at D-land, we'll call her Wendalyn.\u00a0 Sure I'll sign autographs as soon as I get my own movie.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0I'm still happy to report, I'm healthy and hydrated.\u00a0 After 40 minutes, 40 short minutes.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0New glasses.\u00a0 Mom looked at me and said... You Look Smart!\u00a0 I hope that also means, I am smart.\n\n\u00a0Do I get the 2012 courage award or what???\u00a0 The haze even seems to be glowing red.\n\nAnd...I'm just really grateful for family.\u00a0 REALLY GRATEFUL!\u00a0 I don't let them know enough.\u00a0 So, family, I love all of you.\n\n\nShawn AND Chelsey said...\n\nyay for new beginnings! i think you will make a great wendy :-)\n\ncute glasses!\n\nMissy & Jimmy said...\n\nJust wanted to tell you that I think you are AWESOME and I love reading your should do more. hint hint.\n\nJaNae said...\n\nOf all people YOU make the most of every trial, adventure, or unexpected change that comes your way! Before you know it you will be back to looking for those who need you in this ward...if you haven't already.\n\nAngie said...\n\nWendlyn! I love you! Honestly, I love reading your blog and it makes me happy. I miss having you as my downstairs roommate. I'll be leaving the YSA and becoming ANGIE in a couple of months....I might need some cheer leading from you as I make the transition! Love ya!\n\nMelissa said...\n\nSo I have finally made the trip to your blog! I love it! And I love that you are so happy in the family ward. You're adorable and inspiring and I love you.",

        "text":"Ganga: The River of Rebirth\n\nChronicles known as Puranas narrate the tale of how Ganga came down to earth to help those who die take birth once more.\n\nA king called Sagara was once performing a yagna. If the ritual was a success, he would become Indra, king of paradise, and have access to all the pleasures of the world, including immortality. But there was already an Indra in the sky, and he could not bear the idea of being replaced. So he stole Sagara\u2019s horse that was an integral part of the ritual and hid it in the hermitage of a sage called Kapil. The sons of Sagara looked everywhere for the horse. They dug so deep that they created a crater that eventually became the receptacle of the sea. Finally they found the horse in Kapil\u2019s hermitage and they accused Kapil of theft. Kapil\u2019s eyes were shut at this time, as he was lost in deep contemplation. He had no idea of Indra\u2019s mischief.\n\nIrritated by the disturbance, he opened his eyes. So fiery was his first glance that the sons of Sagara who stood before him shouting accusations burst into flames and were reduced to a heap of ash. Indra smiled and Kapil shut his eyes once again. A heartbroken Sagara wondered, \u201cMy sons have been killed in their youth. I will die of old age. None of us will be Indra. The yagna had been abandoned midway. None of us will sip Amrita, the nectar of immortality. None of us will experience unending joy. Is every living creature doomed to die having lived such incomplete lives?\u201d\n\nSagara searched for an answer. So did his son Anshuman, and Anshuman\u2019s son Dilip and finally Dilip\u2019s son Bhagirath. Bhagirath met Garud, the eagle, the only creature who had defeated Indra in battle. He said, \u201cIf the ashes of your ancestors are washed by the Ganga they will be reborn and have a second chance of life.\u201d Unfortunately Ganga flowed in the sky.\n\nBhagirath prayed to Brahma, father of all living creatures, and he promised to persuade Ganga to descend on earth. \u201cBut beware,\u201d said the haughty river-goddess when compelled to descend, \u201cthe force of my fall will surely wash away all life on earth and crush its very foundations.\u201d Bhagirath therefore invoked Shiva. Shiva agreed to let Ganga fall on his head and thus protect the earth from direct impact. The world watched the spectacle of water descending from the sky. Indra gloated, convinced that Ganga would destroy all of humanity, and with that all threats to his reign.\n\nBut when Ganga fell on Shiva\u2019s head, she found his head was covered with thick matted hair, so thick and so densely matted that she found herself getting entangled and trapped. Far from washing away life and breaking the foundations of earth, Ganga found herself locked up atop Shiva\u2019s head. She tried to find a way out, but Shiva\u2019s locks were like a labyrinth. There was no escape. She begged and cried, and finally, Shiva relented and Ganga flowed out of Shiva\u2019s head, down the slopes of Kailasa, through the ravines of the Himalayas, onto the plains and finally towards the sea. Her bubbly movements irritated one sage called Jahnu who swallowed her whole but when Bhagirath revealed the identity and importance of the river, he released the river through his ear, after which she came to be known as his daughter, Jahnavi.\n\nThe idea of rebirth and the Ganga cannot be separated. The river comes from the land of Indra, who has access to Amrita, the nectar of immortality. Indra, the hero of Vedic hymns, lives the life everyone on earth wants to live. He is strong and powerful and attractive and invincible. All day he spends enjoying the good things in life. He does not fear aging or death. Kings of the earth, such as Sagara, envy him. They all want to live Indra\u2019s perfect life. They spend their lifetimes working towards it. Eventually everyone fails \u2013 those who die \u00a0young like Sagara\u2019s sons and even those who die old like Sagara himself. And everyone wonders, if there will ever be another chance to become Indra.\n\nA dip in the Ganga is about getting a karmic clean slate, a chance to begin life with a new balance sheet. Throwing ashes in the Ganga is about giving the dead a chance to be reborn once more, hopefully in Indra\u2019s paradise, and enjoy all things that were denied in this life. Ganga thus is all about forgiveness and second chances. It is an idea that gives hope to humanity.\n\nThe doctrine of rebirth is perhaps informed by agricultural practices on the riverbank, where crops grow and are harvested every year with cyclical regularity. Every year there are the rains, the summer heat and the winter chill. Nothing lasts forever, but everything comes back eventually. But civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and China were also nurtured on the banks of rivers. Rebirth never featured in their stories. All of them spoke of death and an endless afterlife. They built pyramids and tombs to the dead and kept the ashes of ancestors in urns and temples, to celebrate the life that was. They did not cremate the dead and scatter ashes in a river, in hope of yet another life. This life was their one and only chance. In the river valley civilizations of India, however, the idea of a second chance took root firmly, perhaps because of men that the Greek followers of Alexander, the Great, identified as gymnosophists or the naked wise men, who imagined the world very differently.\n\nGanga\u2019s story refers to several such naked wise men, such as Kapil and Jahnu and Gotama and Agastya, but none more spectacular and magnificent as Shiva, from whose dreadlocks springs the promise of rebirth in the form of Ganga, and who smears his body with ash to remind all of the promise of soul that outlives death!\n\nShiva is the great destroyer whose worship scholars often fumble to explain. \u00a0How can a destroyer be worshipped? Few ponder over what Shiva actually destroys. Even today, writers on Shiva insist on describing him as \u2018destroyer of evil\u2019 or \u2018creative destroyer\u2019 which reveals this long discomfort with the term \u2018destroyer\u2019. Yes, Shiva is destroyer. He is Yamantaka, the destroyer of death, and Kamantaka, destroyer of desire. He is the destroyer of limitations imposed by one life.\n\nShiva, and the gymnosophists who considered him Adi-nath, or the primal teacher, offer a dual promise: a temporal promise to live as many lives one wants trying to be Indra, and a transcendental promise to break free from this foolhardy quest someday. This is not redemption or salvation or liberation. This is not enlightenment. This is just the offer of infinite second chances. With this one offer, death ceases to be a full stop; it becomes a comma. Shiva, the destroyer of death, then becomes worthy of worship, as does the river sprouting from his head.\n\n~ Dr. Devdutt Pattanaik\n\nAdd Comment\n\nClick here to post a comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.
