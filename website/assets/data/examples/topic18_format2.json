How she wanted that necklace, and when she asked her mother if she\nwould buy it for her, her mother said, \"Well, it is a pretty necklace, but it costs an awful lot of money.\n\nI'll tell you what. I'll buy you the necklace, and when we get home we can make up a list of chores that\nyou can do to pay for the necklace.\n\nAnd don't forget that for your birthday Grandma just might give you a whole dollar bill, too. Okay?\"\n\nJenny agreed, and her mother bought the pearl necklace for her.\n\nJenny worked on her chores very hard every day, and sure enough, her grandma gave her a brand new dollar bill for her birthday. Soon\n\nJenny had paid off the pearls. How Jenny loved those pearls. She wore them everywhere to kindergarten,bed and when she went out with her mother to run errands.\n\nThe only time she didn't wear them was in the shower. Her mother had told her that they would turn her neck green!\n\nNow Jenny had a very loving daddy. When Jenny went to bed, he would get up from his favorite chair every night and read Jenny her favorite story.\n\nOne night when he finished the story, he said, \"Jenny, do you love me?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Daddy, you know I love you,\" the little girl said.\n\n\"Well, then, give me your pearls.\"\n\n\"Oh! Daddy, not my pearls!\" Jenny said. \"But you can have Rosy, my favorite doll. Remember her? You gave her to me last year for my birthday. And you can have her tea party outfit, too. Okay?\"\n\n\"Oh no, darling, that's okay.\" Her father brushed her cheek with a kiss. \"Good night, little one.\"\n\nA week later, her father once again asked Jenny after her story, \"Do you love me?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Daddy, you know I love you.\"\n\n\"Well, then, give me your pearls.\"\n\n\"Oh, Daddy, not my pearls! But you can have Ribbons, my toy horse. Do you remember her? She's my favorite.\n\nHer hair is so soft, and you can play with it and braid it and everything. You can have Ribbons if you want her,\n\n\"Daddy,\" the little girl said to her father.\n\n\"No, that's okay,\" her father said and brushed her cheek again with a kiss. God bless you, little one. Sweet dreams.\"\n\nSeveral days later, when Jenny's father came in to read her a story, Jenny was sitting on her bed and her lip was trembling. \" Here, Daddy,\" she said, and held out her hand. She opened it and her beloved pearl necklace was inside.\n\nShe let it slip into her father's hand.\n\nWith one hand her father held the plastic pearls and the other he pulled out of his pocket a blue velvet box.\n\nInside of the box were real, genuine, beautiful pearls. He had had them all along. He was waiting for Jenny to give up the cheap stuff so he could give her the real thing.\n\nSo it is with GOD. He is waiting for us to give up the cheap things in our lives so he can give us beautiful treasure\nLovely Thoughts for Lovely People Just Like You\n\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\nInspirational Motivational Quotes on Life Love",

Your eyes bore my soul; I am naked but not exposed for you cover me with love.\n\nShow me more, O Lord, let me run into eternity seeking but not finding the end of your goodness. What I have and who I am can\u2019t contain it, like a 2nd helping of my favourite dessert, there is no more room but you remove me and place me where there are no limits. This is your place of favour for those who love you and give themselves in surrender to you.\n\nI am yours, totally and forever. My life is lived in worship for you, my King. There is no place you go where I won\u2019t follow because I am protected in your shadow; it\u2019s the only place I\u2019m safe.\n\nRun away with me; let\u2019s go to the caves and hide out there.

Keeping you searching even if it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nDarkness is the inevitable side on every line of life no matter what. In the dark sometimes you can\u2019t be so strong for ever that your tears drip. Or getting lost on the open road. Or being scattered in the randomness of fantasy. Darkness isn\u2019t pleasant to see (and you can\u2019t really see it) but it gives you the opportunity to imagine colors and lights using only your brain and your heart \u2013 the most capable medium ever created to invent whatever you want.\n\nUntil that trumpet horns resonate, you will always be in the darkness of hopes and certainties. Teaching you that life is not designed to give you happiness, but instead chains of disappointment and pain. So there is this saying, \u201cpleasure and happiness are actually trials.\u201d For true life is the flood of sufferings that are written for all who were born.\n\nBut God doesn\u2019t perfect the dark as an absolute misfortune that you must accept. Thus, on preferred nights, accompanied by a gentle breeze of wind you can enjoy a luminous night: when you let yourself bathed in a full-moon light \u2013 round, silvery, blazing.",

        "text":"Double Lesson\n\nYour work shall be rewarded (2 Chr. 15:7).\n\nI really don\u2019t know how I let Sister Moffat talk me into it in the first place. Before I knew what was happening, I had agreed to give a five-minute talk in sacrament meeting about being a Cub Scout. All the other guys were pounding me on the back, saying that they were glad it was me, not them.\n\n\u201cYou really are a pal, Alan,\u201d Will said. \u201cYou saved all the rest of us.\u201d\n\nYeah, I thought, but who\u2019s going to save me?\n\nWhen I got home, I told Mom about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I said I\u2019d do it. I can\u2019t talk for five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a great opportunity to me,\u201d she said, smiling.\n\nSomehow I knew she\u2019d say that. That\u2019s what mothers always say. \u201cBut five minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time to say I like Cub Scouting because it\u2019s fun and helps me learn new things.\u201d\n\nMom chuckled. \u201cFive minutes isn\u2019t nearly as long as it sounds to you. I\u2019ll help you. Together I\u2019m sure we can think of enough to take up five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sure hope so,\u201d I said. I was glad she had volunteered to help though. It was kind of like she had picked up the other end of a heavy load that I had been trying to lift by myself.\n\nBecause this was a talk for sacrament meeting, and because Dad says that sacrament meeting is probably the most important of all our Church meetings, I knew that I couldn\u2019t put off preparing it until Saturday. So after school on Monday I asked Mom if she had had time to write any of my talk.\n\nShe looked at me in surprise. \u201cNow, wait a minute. I didn\u2019t say that I would write your talk. I said that I would help you write one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you always wrote my talks before,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought that that\u2019s what you meant when you said that you\u2019d help me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re old enough now that I don\u2019t have to do everything for you. Wasn\u2019t it you who was telling me last week that a ten-year-old ought to have more privileges than his eight-year-old sister?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t even know how to begin,\u201d I wailed. \u201cYou said that you\u2019d help me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Mom answered. \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between helping you and doing it for you.\u201d\n\nWell, when Mom finally convinced me that she really wasn\u2019t going to do it all, I pleaded for suggestions. She said that we should start with prayer. Then, by asking questions, she helped me get a better idea of what I wanted to say. After that, she helped me decide in what order to say things.\n\nI still had to sit down and write the talk out myself, but it wasn\u2019t as hard as I\u2019d thought it would be, because I knew what I wanted to say. When I finished, Mom helped me correct some grammar mistakes.\n\nOnce the talk was written, I started feeling kind of glad that I was going to talk in sacrament meeting. I practiced giving it every day in front of a mirror. By the time Saturday rolled around, I felt pretty confident. As long as I had my paper there to remind me what came next, I could give most of the talk by just glancing down once in a while.\n\nSunday morning I made one last trial run with Dad as my audience. \u201cAlan, that is a very fine talk,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do just great in sacrament meeting. But there is one thing that you don\u2019t want to forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, a little disappointed to think that something wasn\u2019t just right.\n\nSeeing my disappointment, he said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s nothing wrong with your talk. I just want to remind you to ask Heavenly Father to help you do your best.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, feeling much better. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nSitting up on the stand, I felt pretty important. I glanced at the clock\u2014two minutes until the meeting started. I felt a nervous excitement as I reached into my pocket for my talk. It wasn\u2019t there! I felt in my other pockets. I looked on the floor. It was gone! Just then the bishop got up and announced the opening song and prayer.\n\nWhat was I going to do? I caught Mom\u2019s eye and gave her a pleading look. She just smiled at me. I began praying fervently that the paper with my talk on it would miraculously appear. I felt in my pockets again\u2014nothing. When I put the hymnbook under my seat, I felt around the entire area for my paper\u2014still nothing.\n\nWhen the deacons were just about finished passing the sacrament, I knew that my miracle was not going to happen. I began praying that I would be able to remember my talk or that I would at least know what to say.\n\nSuddenly I heard my name as the bishop announced me as the first speaker. With leaden feet I walked slowly to the pulpit. I could see my mother and father smiling at me. Will was pointing at me.\n\nI was sure that everyone could see me shaking. Very slowly I announced the topic of my talk. There was Sister Moffat. She was smiling too. I just stood there quaking for a minute. Then something miraculous did happen: I remembered the first few sentences! As I began speaking, I remembered more and more. It was almost like I was standing in front of the mirror at home, except that I felt a warm, radiating glow around me.\n\nI was finished before I knew it. The rest of the meeting was like a pleasant after-glow. I felt wonderful. That feeling was only intensified by all the compliments I received when the meeting was over.\n\n\u201cAlan,\u201d Dad said, \u201cyou were great!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really were,\u201d Mom said as she planted a kiss on my cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know,\u201d I confessed, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that I was going to be able to do it, because I lost the paper with my talk on it. When I discovered that it was gone, it was too late to do anything else but pray for help. So I did. Heavenly Father really came through for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like you learned more than just how to give a good talk,\u201d said Dad, giving my shoulders a squeeze.\n\n\u201cYeah, I really did.\u201d\n\n[illustrations] Illustrated by Mike Eagle",

        "text":"a safe place\n\nTheir kindness unraveled me.\n\nThere were no expectations.\u00a0 There were no admonitions.\u00a0 There was\u00a0no condemnation.\n\nThey listened with calm patience and\u00a0peaceful understanding in their eyes.\u00a0 They\u00a0encouraged with loving words of counsel and wisdom for every aching sigh and wretched confession.\n\nWithout judgement or correction, they drew near and waited for this unwilling\u00a0flower to open.\u00a0 They were not appalled when a long wilted petal fell to the ground.\u00a0 The stench of long neglected\u00a0wounds did not make them flinch.\u00a0 Nor were they scandalized to see that what remained was lacking.\n\nAnd when the tears fell and the dam\u00a0broke and my speech became slurred and incomprehensible, they\u00a0laid\u00a0solemn\u00a0hands over me and called on the Comforter to minister where they could not.\n\nOver and again, another blemish would be\u00a0revealed as we addressed the last.\u00a0 I was appalled that the breaking was cyclical, there seemed to be no end.\u00a0 The healing a wrestling of persistence and stamina.\n\nBut\u00a0these mothers, these Titans,\u00a0she that had walked in the ways that I was entering, created a holy haven with their Being.\n\nThey provided for me what no other had attempted or\u00a0had fathomed was needed.\n\nThese women of faith surrounded\u00a0me with a\u00a0shield of anointed protection.\u00a0 Rescuing me from the\u00a0harsh elements of this earth, they created a safe place.\u00a0 They sustained a covering in which I finally felt the confidence to heal. A\u00a0gentle gathering where truth\u00a0could be spoken and received.\u00a0 Where the poignancy of honesty\u00a0was delivered\u00a0in the sanctuary\u00a0of acceptance.\n\nThere is a resistant protection built up in every broken person.\u00a0 When there has been a shattering, the frantic makeshift\u00a0triage has left a thick scar. Only in a harbor, a place of refuge\u00a0can we even entertain a thorough repair.\n\nWe all need a cove, where our hearts and minds find soothing balm, a place we feel content.\u00a0 It\u2019s where\u00a0the violent waves\u00a0meet the breakers far from the shore.\u00a0 A shelter where there is love and calm waters and we don\u2019t fret the tides. Tears\u00a0well up in our eyes from just the thought of being there and our longing to return overwhelms us until the breath in our lungs presses against our heart and all we\u00a0hear is the\u00a0deafening beat in our ears.\n\nThat is where the layers begin to\u00a0fall away and\u00a0 the walls start to crumble.\u00a0 When we stop trying to\u00a0pick up the broken pieces with dust-covered hands\u00a0and press them back into the walls that imprison us.\n\nIt\u2019s where the tears begin to wash away the soot and our stories start to fall like vibrant petals from our tongues.\n\nThis is the space that every broken girl needs.\u00a0 It is\u00a0a gift of grace and love.\u00a0 It is a place of\u00a0 beauty and courage\u00a0where brokeness, weakness, flaws and fragility\u00a0are not uncomfortable but unconditionally accepted.\u00a0 It is where you are called blessed\u00a0because of them.\n\nBeautiful\u00a0alabaster box, pouring out your sin and hurt and shame at the feet of Christ.\n\nOh mighty women of valor!\u00a0 We need you to pass on your\u00a0knowledge, your intentional acceptance and willingness to serve and save.\u00a0 So many of us need you.\n\nSo many need us to take up that mantle of rescue.\u00a0 To lift our hands in service and call on the\u00a0Comforter to abide in the spaces we keep.\u00a0 To restore warrior princesses and high priestesses to their rightful, whole and fortified selves.\n\nAnd show your own self in all respects to be a pattern and a model of good deeds and works, teaching what is unadulterated, showing gravity [having the strictest regard for truth and purity of motive], with dignity and seriousness.And let your instruction be sound and fit and wise and wholesome, vigorous and [a]irrefutable and above censure, so that the opponent may be put to shame, finding nothing discrediting or evil to say about us.\u00a0 Titus 2:7-8 (AMP)\n\n\nlet\u2019s cross over\n\nHe calls me out to cross the waters.\n\nBut I am hesitant.\n\nThe harbor is safe. The docks overflow with provision. I am held in high esteem. My position is secure and my name is known at the gates.\n\nOh but his voice dances on the wind. I am drawn by his invitation though reason keeps my feet planted in the sand.\n\nThe water is perilous and unpredictable. Struggles and temptations are the litany of the water. It is murky with the unknown. Hostile is its nature.\n\nThere are storms at sea.\n\nMonsters rise up out of its dark deep and rush waves upon waves of doubt and fear onto the shore. They threaten to capsize and send me adrift should I dare attempt a crossing. Should they engulf me, overwhelm and consume me, I could perish!\n\nBut still he calls.\nLet\u2019s crossover.\n\nWhat is on the other side?\nWhy does he beckon?\nI must know.\nI cannot resist.\nAcross the waters I will go.\n\nQuickly all is black of ink and foamy white and shades of gray.\n\nThe waters are merciless.\n\nTempests rise, squalls abuse, hurricanes churn, the waves are icy cold and heavy. They batter and bruise.\n\nThe sea is unrelenting.\n\nRun down, I am sinking beneath the waves. Gasping for air, I am at the brink of surrender when I hear that same sweet voice now speak with authority into the chaos.\n\nThen peace.\nAll is haltingly still.\nI will cross over.\n\nWhat is on the other side?\nOn the other side is victory.\nOn the other side is potential.\nOn the other side is hope.\n\nWhen I cross over to the other side, the storm surge rolls and withdraws and rushes back into the sea. My adversaries are swept into the very waters that threatened and tried to intimidate me. Doubt and fear are dragged through the sand and into the dark undertow.\n\nLet\u2019s crossover.\nLet\u2019s walk on water.\nLet\u2019s go and know Him\nand all He is,\nand all He will do,\non the other side.\n\nthorns and thistles\n\nThe earth is in me.\n\nThough my soil is deep, rich and fertile, the warmth of its dark grounds seemingly affectionate and cultivated, in it lie thorns and thistles.\n\nThe gardener scattered the seeds of His word in my fields.\u00a0 My heart had been worked by the till of contrition and I was ready to receive the seeds of life.\n\nAs these seeds took root their young shoots pushed though the surface, reaching for the righteousness of the Son and seeking to drink in the refreshing rains of His grace.\n\nThe dormant thorns and thistles were aroused.\n\nThorny creeping tendrils of cares and fears, worries and anxiety began to twist, tangle and distort. And while I worked diligently to remove the noxious weeds, it seemed that with each one I removed, three more sprouted up in its place. Prickly and seemingly evolving in defense, they were painful to uproot.\n\nThe thistles of my doubt and skepticism were even more adept at pressing down words of life.\u00a0 They were quick to choke every expectant bud as too lofty to take root and too risky to cultivate.\n\nSoon my treasure of seed was fruitless.\u00a0 Hope looked just vain. The promise of increase, harvest and bounty in the Word was consumed until the vital shoots and buds of my faith shriveled, withered and came to nothing.\n\nI was overcome. \u00a0\n\nIn my despair the serpent slithered:\n\nThe earth is cursed. \u00a0\u201c..thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you\u201d\n\nScripture warns me of these thistles and thorns.\u00a0 They are the bitter herbs that took root when along with Eve I rejected God\u2019s provision and questioned his motives.\n\nThey are the weeds of discontent and distrust.\n\nThey are the root of all sin that continues to distance us further and further from the certainty of the gardener\u2019s love and intentions for us . \u00a0They spiny stalks are the cause of pain, suffering and death that we experience in our lives.\n\nGod saw all of this.\n\nWe were overrun by thorn bushes, suffocating and seemingly defeated.\n\nThen God, in His unfailing love and never-ending compassion, sent His son to free us all.\u00a0 Christ gathered up each thorn of sin and He laid them on his head.\u00a0 He bore my shame and endured my pain and sorrowed all of my failings.\n\nHe succumbed to my death.\n\nReaching down into the depths of all sin, he paid the price of the curse. \u00a0 And in rising again, he defeated it. \u00a0Breathing life into his lungs he breathed life into all humankind.\n\nHe made all things new.\n\nAnd through Him, and with Him, I can hope again.\n\nI can believe that those seeds of promise in me will one day birth fruit to perfection.",

Thus their fastened belts become loose, and these women become the unpaid maidservants of Krsna. Indeed, they run toward Krsna exactly like madwomen.\n\nLink to this page: http:\/\/prabhupadabooks.com\/cc\/antya\/17\/46\n\nPrevious: Antya 17.45 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next: Antya 17.47\n\nIf you Love Me Distribute My Books -- Srila Prabhupada",
