A truck, as it was turning, landed on a jeep. It (truck) was just on top of the jeep; in fact, it was God that saved the driver.\n\n\u00a0\u201cSo, we preach safety for the vehicles and also for the drivers. The drivers should be exposed to how they can adequately manage their health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0The Supply Chain Director of the company, Hanna Colman, said the Safety Week was designed to ensure that the company\u2019s transport operations were executed with smart, alert, focused and educated drivers, through its third-party contractors.\n\nColman, who was represented by the Site Director of the Benin brewery, Adebayo Alli, added, \u201cWe have taken safety in our operational environment very far.

He was flagged down for not wearing his seat belt and in an attempt to escape, he collided with our operational vehicle.\n\n\u201cImmediately it happened, the reckless driver went to the nearby Akim Police Station to ensure that his vehicle was not towed to our yard. We had already booked him for seat belt use violation, dangerous driving and assaulting regular marshals.\n\n\u201cBut before we knew what was happening, the matter was immediately transferred from Akim Police Station to the Zone Six Command. In less than 24 hours, my men were invited to the command where they were detained for over 10 hours for no just cause.\n\n\u201cOur lawyers went there, but they insisted that we should come and sign a bail bond. These men were detained with their uniforms and this is disturbing.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in charge of Zone Six Command, Mr Abeng Oyom, said the driver of the BMW had come to lodge a complaint that his car was damaged by FRSC operational vehicle driven by an official.\n\nHe, however, denied the claims that the FRSC officials were detained.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe complainant had come to lodge a complaint that his vehicle was damaged by FRSC operational vehicle.\n\n\u201cHe complained to the state traffic unit, but was not pleased with the way the matter was being handled. That was why we took it over. The FRSC officials were not detained.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\nAll rights reserved.

Playing on bills with internationally touring superstars like Victor Wooten, EOTO, Primus, The Roots, Matisyahu, Members of G-Unit, Rusted Root and Parliament Funkadelic have helped build an enthusiastic fan base.\n\nIowa City electronic\/jazz\/rock quartet Slip Silo celebrated the release of its first full length album, Monsoons, on April 14th, 2012, the follow-up to the group\u2019s 2009 self-titled EP. Formed in the summer of 2008, Slip Silo is comprised of talented, thoughtful musicians who studied jazz and who have appeared in groups such as Koplant No, OSG, Big Funk Guarantee, The Critical Hour, New Beat Society, and many more. The band combines a variety of influences to create a unique sound that listeners find delightfully difficult to classify.\n\nBryce Janey is an outstanding blues\/rock axe slinger from Marion, Iowa. He began his career at the age of 13, touring regionally and nationally from Chicago to Los Angeles with a blues-rock trio called the Janey's. Bryce began his solo career in 1995 and has received widespread praise and accolades ever since.

The beauty in Thankful Dirt\u2019s music comes not only from Molly\u2019s powerful, soul snatching vocals but also from the unique relationship the two share in the project. Together they ignite a sound both unique and universally appealing. Music lovers \u2018dig\u2019 Thankful Dirt.\n\nBig Blue Sky started as a father-son duo in the mid-90s by Jon Stravers Sr and Jon-Jon Stravers. Their musical style includes the influence of folk, bluegrass, blues, and reggae. In their music they seek a closer connection to the planet, and indeed their musical writing comes from the inspiration of wild places and a celebration of our natural heritage and the natural rhythms of life.\n\nWhitney Mann is an old soul with a child's glow. Her story is only beginning. It's the story of a poetic farm girl from Michigan who grew up to open for Loretta Lynn. It's the story of a young woman whose voice will break your heart but whose songs will bring you back for more. Her new package of country ballads and barn tales is called The Western Sky.\n\nAveraging over 100 shows per year, Chad Elliott has been on the road for more than a decade performing a blend of roots, blues and folk music. He has played across the country and has been lauded as a modern-day troubadour.\n\nThe Awful Purdies are an eclectic quintet of female multi-instrumentalists who take turns stepping up as song writer and lead singer. The ensemble purdify's each song they meet, letting the song lead the way. One song might require channeling the Andrew's Sisters, while another song might reach out to a rock-a-billy or Motown sensibility.\n\nThe Candymakers of Davenport, Iowa offer a sound that is contemporary, yet keeps the essence of old-school groove bands of music past. Emulating the many talents of artists such as Ben Harper, Aretha Franklin and BB King, it\u2019s important to the band to produce an original sound that keeps fans craving for more.\n\nSongwriters Sam Knutson and Milk & Eggs (Jordan Sellergren) have recently collaborated for The Englert Theatre's Iowa City Song Project, recording their duet \"Up the Street From You\" as part of the Englert's centennial celebration.\n\nLindsay Lou & the Flatbellys are giving a nod to American traditional music, while boldly taking their own songs in new directions. Distinct vocals, tight harmonies, instrumental expertise, and creative arrangements are all essential characteristics of their unique sound. The group focuses on the original tunes of Lindsay Lou Rilko, which include true-life tales of bank-robbing aunties, moonshinin' grandpas, and celebrations of love, life, and nature.\n\nCaroline Smith and Jesse Schuster\u2014of Caroline Smith and the Good Night Sleeps\u2014will play a special duo performance on November 2nd for IPR\u2019s Java Blend. This past summer, Caroline and Jesse toured as a duo, appearing at a small handful of intimate shows hosted in people's houses and living rooms across the Midwest.\u00a0\n\nMike Mangione & The Union is a touring group that combines a folk-rock sound with an orchestrated string section, soulful vocals and literate sensibility. The band\u2019s debut album, Tenebrae, received favorable press from all corners of the country, including the honor of being an All Music Guide Album Pick, while Blurt refers to their \u201ctearstained folk, Memphis-styled gospel and bluesy-flavored pop\u201d as \u201cluminous.\u201d\n\nVicki and Joe Price, a husband and wife blues duo, combine talents on this energetic crowd pleaser released on their own label, Blues Acres Productions. Fun and spunky guitar riffs that make you stomp your feet, bob your head, and smile explode right out of the gate and don\u2019t quit until the album is done.\n\nVicki\u2019s powerful bluesy voice evokes an image of a woman in a 1920\u2019s speakeasy singing her heart out.\n\nNo secrets between friends, ignorance is bliss.

Offering positive punk-rock energy with folk\/pop musicianship, their sonic champagne is frothing and bubbling with the release of their third studio album, FORTRESS SESSIONS. It is seriously full of fun.\n\nThe release of Side 2 exposes a different view of Des Moines musician Tony Bohnenkamp. For nearly twenty years Tony has been active in the music industry, but Side 2 marks the life-long musician\u2019s debut solo album. Tony has played just about every role \u2014 owner of a successful recording studio, well-known dueling pianist, drummer for The Nadas, singer for Lunchbox, not to mention producer\/songwriter\/composer \u2014 but now it\u2019s time for Tony to showcase his own material. \u201cEvery project I\u2019ve ever worked on has been for someone else.\n\nWisconsin based singer-songwriter Jeremiah Nelson is constantly creating and reinventing his music with an ever-evolving cast of characters. \u201cDrugs to Make You Sober\u201d, Jeremiah Nelson\u2019s new solo record feels like a real labor of love. It\u2019s made up of seemingly traditional rock arrangements adorned with beautiful atmospheric and dreamy sonic wanderings.There\u2019s something lonely and heartbreaking hiding underneath Nelson\u2019s sonic layerings.\n\nThe Feralings are Benj Upchurch (mandolin \/ vocals), Nicole Upchurch (clawhammer banjo \/ vocals), Patrick Bloom (upright bass \/ vocals), and Stacy Webster (acoustic guitar \/ vocals), but the name is a bit of a misnomer, as the members of the band are far more likely to invite you to sit down and enjoy a cup of tea than they are to jump you and steal your beer money.\n\nBegun as a side project between singer\/songwriter Jen McClung and her husband, poet\/musician Jim Coppoc, the Gatehouse Saints cover great lyricists from Leonard Cohen to Trent Reznor to the Dixie Chicks, and use these influences to build their own original music.\n\nWith story songs that search for community and shared meaning, Jen Chapin creates a funk and soul inspired k...
