For instance, if you are ranked higher than 70% of all players, then you would be in the 70th percentile.\n\nWhy do you chart the percentile instead of the rank?\n\nThe number of ranked players in the TennisRecruiting.net lists changes from week to week, and the differences can be dramatic over long periods of time. For example, there may be only 500 players ranked before the busy summer season\u00a0-\u00a0and 1000 players ranked at the end. With these changes, your ranking may change significantly over long periods of time\u00a0-\u00a0and these changes are not necessarily correlated with your performance.\n\nWe have found that percentile does not fluctuate as widely as the raw rankings and better correlates with performance. Using percentiles makes the historical ranking charts more meaningful.\n\nWhy does the chart start at the 50th percentile?\n\nThe pool of players considered is much bigger than the players that we rank.

Read more.\n\n1612: Death of Prince Henry\n\nHenry, Prince of Wales, died from typhoid fever on 6 November 1612. His death was a major blow to the Stuart dynasty.

James\u2019s Catholicism had proved deeply unpopular, as the earlier Exclusion Crisis (1679-1681) and Monmouth Rebellion (1685) demonstrated.
