        "text":"What SUVs Are Meant For\n\nView Special Offers\n\nNo Obligation, Fast & Simple Free New Car Quote\n\n1. Vehicle Option\n\n2. Contact Info\n\n3. Dealer Selection\n\nPorsche boss Wendelin Wiedeking once famously remarked: \u201cNo one needs a 911.\u201d Not many people need an SUV, either. Oh, sure, plenty of folks have convinced themselves they do, but in most cases what they actually buy is a high-riding station wagon with faintly macho styling: Some 50% of all SUVs sold in the U.S. are actually two-wheel-drive models and so about as useful off the pavement as the Wagon Queen Family Truckster. Go figure.\n\nI was thinking about this over the weekend as I tiptoed a Land Rover LR3 through a forest ablaze with fall color on the 8000-acre Biltmore Estate in North Carolina. Tricky climbs, heart-stopping descents, deep waterholes, nasty ruts, chassis-twisting undulations: It was a walk in the park for the LR3, our 2005 Sport\/Utility of the Year winner.\n\nI learned to drive in an early 1960s Land Rover Series II with about a million miles on the clock and no synchro on first or second gears. It went damn near anywhere, that old Landie, but it was a visceral ride; all sweat and muscle when the going got tough. In the LR3, Land Rover\u2018s impressive Terrain Response System, which electronically links all the vehicle sub-systems \u2014 suspension, differentials, throttle, transmission, braking \u2014 and optimizes them to suit the surface you select from a menu on the center console, does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nOne thing hasn\u2019t changed, though: Although you might be travelling at little more than walking pace, serious off-roading is driving every bit as technical and challenging as hot-lapping a racetrack. You\u2019re constantly thinking about the physics at work in the interplay between vehicle and surface; always aiming to place each wheel with millimetric accuracy. The most notable difference is that, if you make a mistake off-roading, you usually have a lot more time to think about it as the consequences unfold before you in slow motion.\n\nThe Land Rover LR3 is a lot like a Porsche 911: Function has been transcended by fashion. Many owners buy the style or the badge rather than the ability; few have any real idea what their vehicle can do, and fewer still have gotten anywhere near the limits of its performance. Demonstrating to folks what the Land Rover badge really means is the idea behind the Land Rover Experience Driving School.\n\nThe Land Rover Experience Driving School at Biltmore Estate (it uses land around the stunning 250-room Biltmore House built by George W. Vanderbilt in the late 1800s) is one of four in North America. The others are in Manchester Village, Vermont; Carmel, California; and Montebello, Quebec. The schools offer everything from one-hour tasters for people who have never ventured off the blacktop, to full-day advanced winch-and-recovery techniques for those who understand that a four-wheel-drive vehicle, however accomplished, does not transcend the laws of physics.\n\nAs we noted during this year\u2019s Sport\/Utility of the Year evaluation, the term SUV is now applied to everything from high-riding hot-rods (BMW X6, Infiniti FX) to 21st-century riffs on the traditional full-size station wagon (Ford Flex, Chevy Traverse). Form following marketing, I guess. Like a track day in a Porsche 911, my drive in the Land Rover LR3 at Biltmore Estate was a welcome reminder of a deeper truth, however: Form still follows function.",

        "text":"Back to list\nOwning a Car Is So Last Century\nby Canvas \u2022 July 1, 2019\n\n\nOwning a Car Is So Last Century\n\nIt\u2019s wild to think about how much everything has changed over the past century. From our beloved smartphones to Netflix, we\u2019ll be the first ones to admit that technology and innovation have completely transformed our lives. Things are continuing to change as we shift towards flexility and convenience.\n\nIn the same way that we now can order food straight from our phones and can watch movies from the comfort of our own homes, the way we get from point A to point B has also taken a drastic departure from traditional car ownership and financing. Vehicle ownership and spending years locked into the same car are finally drawing to an end.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look back to learn how far we\u2019ve evolved in the past 100 years or so.\n\nModel T for the Masses\n\nThe Ford Model T changed the world when it hit the streets in 1908. Before its arrival, owning a car was a luxury reserved mainly for the wealthy. With a starting price under $900 at the time of its launch, the Model T made car ownership a reality for the masses. As Ford perfected their moving assembly line technology, production soared and the cost of buying a new Model T fell by roughly half. Over 15 million Model Ts rolled off the line between the years of 1908 and 1927.\n\nWhile the Model T\u2019s original prices seem remarkably low today, they represented a large chunk of change for working folks back in the day. Henry Ford was not keen on selling the Model T on credit. He offered a weekly layaway plan that required buyers to pay $5 to $10 weekly before delivery, but it was not well-accepted. Outside firms stepped in with offers to finance the purchase of a Model T with a \u201csmall payment down\u201d and \u201cbalance by the month.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors Kickstarts the Automobile Loan Industry\n\nGeneral Motors got the conventional financing ball rolling when it launched the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) in 1919. A 35 percent down payment was commonplace, with the remainder paid off in monthly payments over a year, which is a tiny fraction of today\u2019s auto loans, which can extend to five or six years.\n\nGMAC\u2019s short-term loan reflected the realities of maintenance and repair. The cars of yesteryear were far less reliable than today\u2019s vehicles. Once the year was up, repair bills consumed a significant amount of the family budget. In some ways, the one-year timespan foreshadowed today\u2019s short-term leases.\n\nHalf-a-Car Changes the Game With Vehicle Leasing\n\nModern car leasing owes its roots to Eustace Wolfington\u2019s revolutionary Half-a-Car company, which he founded in the early 1960s. With Half-a-Car, new car customers paid off half the cost of the car over a two-year term, then turned the car over to the dealer to resell it for half the original value. The idea was slow to catch on, but persistence paid off as Ford latched on to the concept in 1982. Eustace\u2019s vision persists. The majority of today\u2019s leases are in the 24\u201336-month range.\n\nSelling Your Used Car Is Rarely an Enjoyable Experience\n\nFolks tend to focus on new vehicle acquisition \u2014 the beginning of the cycle \u2014 rather than the end of the period, which is where the \u201cgotchas\u201d are often the most painful. Unloading a less-than-perfect used vehicle can be a grueling experience if you choose to sell it privately. Trading it in for your next vehicle yields disappointment when the dealer offers far less than you\u2019d expect. People tend to forget the trade-in value to retail value differential.\n\nCar Subscriptions Make It Easy\n\nFlash forward to 2019 and the vehicle subscription model has shaken things up, with a marketplace that\u2019s evolving rapidly. All-inclusive car subscriptions include insurance coverage, preventive maintenance, repairs, and roadside assistance into one easy-to-budget monthly payment. When you compare it to a conventionally-financed purchase or lease, the advantages are clear. You\u2019ll save time and hassle with a subscription, with no heartbreak at the end of the term. If you\u2019re considering the subscription route, you should explore all the options. We\u2019re confident that Canvas offers the best subscriber value among its competitors.\n\nNot Owning a Car Can Be a Beautiful Thing\n\nMaking a substantial long-term vehicle commitment is something that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to live near public transportation, owning or leasing a car becomes far less critical. Taking the occasional Uber, Lyft, or taxi is a reasonable expenditure with immediate benefits.\n\nOur modern world is full of conveniences and fraught with expenses. While Grandma and Grandpop were lucky to have had a milkman and possibly a Charles Chips delivery, today we can have practically anything dropped off on our doorstep in a day or less. Whether it\u2019s the weekly groceries through Instacart, dinner via DoorDash, or D-I-Y home improvement products from Home Depot with Roadie \u2014 convenience is king.\n\nA vehicle subscription provides a middle-of-the-road option, with the flexibility to suit any requirements. You subscribe to the specific vehicle that meets your needs each month, without the hassles of ownership or leasing.\n\nA Blast From the Past\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way from Ford\u2019s iconic Model T to the cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers of today. The Model T resembles a tractor, by comparison. Modern vehicles provide luxuries, safety, and technology that our great-great-grandparents might never imagine. So much is taken for granted these days.\n\nIf you\u2019re intrigued by automotive history, take your car from Canvas to the Greenfield Village or the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, as they\u2019re both a must-see. The rides at Greenfield Village are authentic and historic. They\u2019re amusing, for sure, but this is no amusement park. Whether you\u2019re tooling through the streets in a meticulously restored Model T or around the grounds in a train pulled by a steam-powered locomotive, there\u2019s nothing quite like it anywhere else.",

        "text":"A Colyford Railway Child\nBy Mike Bussell\n\n\nThe autor and a friend\nIt all began in 1954 when I was born at Rose Bank, Colyford - the house next door to what was then a milking parlour but is now the annexe to the left of \u2018Yeomans Acre\u2019 which in those days was still a working farm supplying milk to the village. Rose Bank belonged to my maternal Grandparents, Frank and Mabel Marchant and because housing was hard to come by in the \u2018fifties my parents, my sister and I lived with my grandparents at Rose Bank until I was six years old. My Grandfather was Mayor of Colyford 1959\/60.\n\nMy earliest recollections of the village were not so much the sights, but the sounds to be heard, particularly in the early mornings. First was a dull \u2018thud-thud-thud-thud\u2019 coming from nearby which I soon discovered was the sound made by the milking machine at Mr Loud\u2019s farm next door. His herdsman was happy to allow a small boy to watch him go about his work and so often in the morning I\u2019d be lifted over the fence from where I\u2019d make my way through the farmyard to join him in the milking parlour, where I happily watched everything that was going on and learned many things about work on the farm.\n\nThe second, and far more mysterious noise though was a loud metallic clanking that echoed across the valley soon after 7.00am each weekday morning. That, I was told, was the morning goods train from Exeter making its way down to Seaton. It could be seen from our back window which looked out across Mr Loud\u2019s fields to the railway and the rest of the valley beyond. This was, of course, when what is now Orchard Close, located behind Rose Bank, was still an orchard. The clanking noise was made by the rather tired railway engine from Exeter which was bigger and noisier than the one from the small engine shed at Seaton which worked the rest of the trains that passed by, largely unnoticed, several times a day. My curiosity aroused, I persuaded my Grandfather (himself interested in railways) to take me to have a closer look at the trains, and so began regular visits to the little station that I came to know so well.\n\nColyford Station\nBy way of background, Colyford station opened with the branch line to Seaton on 16th March 1868 and consisted of a single platform around 180 feet long with a brick cottage for the level crossing keeper as well as small wooden buildings for the booking office and waiting room. A cast iron urinal was also provided alongside the booking office and at some later date a small concrete hut was provided behind the station, alongside the \u2018White Hart\u2019 wall, for oil lamps and their fuel to be safely kept, the station never benefitting from the provision of a mains electricity supply throughout its 98 year existence. By the late nineteen-fifties the cottage and wooden buildings had all gone, replaced by an anonymous concrete hut adjacent to the level crossing which served as both booking office and waiting room, although the urinal and lamp hut remained (indeed both are still there in 2019 now surrounded by undergrowth, the urinal looking rather lost in mid-air since the demolition of the railway platform which once stood in front of it).\n\nOn entering the station by passing through a wooden gate from the road beside the gated level crossing (alongside a concrete wall, part of which is also still there in 2019) the first thing I remember passing was a large green platform barrow parked by the gate and used to transport heavy items of luggage and parcels up and down the platform. The next thing I recall was thinking how long the platform seemed, the illusion being partly created no doubt by the perfectly straight and very white line painted along its edge. The platform itself was tidy and well swept with redundant tyres, painted white and containing flowers, appearing every few yards along its length. On the other side of the track was a colourful and well-tended flower garden fronted by white painted bricks set into the ground at a 45-degree angle to give a \u2018saw tooth\u2019 effect. Just over half way down the platform was the gent\u2019s urinal, then still serving its intended purpose. What I remember most about that was the smell \u2013 strangely not as unpleasant as one might think, possibly because of whatever was used to clean it (like everything else on the station, it was well looked after), but a smell I have never encountered anywhere else since, although I remember it to this day.\n\nWe next entered the rather plain but functional concrete hut with metal window frames which served as booking office and waiting room and I was introduced to the Porter\/Crossing Keeper, a very pleasant and smartly dressed young man with whom my Grandfather was well acquainted being a regular user of the railway. The hut itself measured no more than twenty feet by ten feet and had a single door into the waiting room, which had a green wooden bench attached to the wall on two sides with a collection of posters and timetables above. Across the middle of the building was a hardboard partition, the partition having a small ticket window and door giving access to the tiny office behind. In practice the ticket window was rarely used because the door, except on cold winter days, was nearly always left open and so what few tickets were sold were passed directly through that. The room had another smell all of its own, but one I later came to discover was common to many railway buildings of the time and one which the preserved railway movement has never quite managed to recreate \u2013\u00a0 a unique mixture of lamp oil, coal smoke from the stove, polish and a hint of mustiness. Again, nothing like as unpleasant as it sounds.\nOn peering into the office I saw a rack of cardboard tickets, a tall bench with a cash drawer and ticket dating machine, a large black old-fashioned telephone giving access to the internal railway \u2018bus line\u2019 and, most importantly of all, a coal stove in the far corner \u2013 the only means of cooking or heating. In the office there was also a bell which repeated the coded messages the signalmen at Seaton and Seaton Junction exchanged, and by this means the Crossing Keeper at Colyford was able to tell when a train left either station (two bells meaning \u2018train entering section\u2019) and, with experience, be able to calculate exactly when he needed to open the level crossing gates for the next train to pass. In practice, because lineside vegetation was carefully managed in those days and accordingly, unlike today, there were virtually no trees within the railway boundary it was possible to see the steam of a train leaving Seaton and also to see along the line for some distance towards Colyton. As well as passengers the station dealt with parcels, although larger items had to be handled by the goods office at Colyton where there were two sidings for goods wagons (in those days of course almost everything one purchased was either sourced locally or came by train for local delivery).\n\nSingle Ticket Seaton to Colyford\nSoon after our arrival the bell in the background rang twice with a clear \u2018ting-ting\u2019 to indicate the departure of a train from Seaton Junction, and around five minutes later the Crossing Keeper (his official title \u2018Leading Porter\u2019) suddenly left his little office, walked briskly to the end of the platform adjacent to the level crossing and went down the ramp and across the line to the two levers that locked and unlocked the level crossing gates and pedestrian wicket gates. After unlocking the gates, he then waited for a gap in the traffic (in those pre-motorway days the road through Colyford was still the A35, a main artery to the west) before opening by hand each of the two heavy white gates just as the train came into view from the Colyton direction. He then quickly returned to the platform to collect tickets or deal with any passengers or parcels requiring his attention (as was all too usual by then, there were none!). The train itself consisted of two elderly green carriages with a compartment for the driver in the front and the even more elderly ex- London and South Western Railway tank engine, built during the reign of Queen Victoria, at the back of the train where the fireman worked alone on the downhill journey to Seaton. On the return journey the engine led - this \u2018push-pull\u2019 arrangement saving time by removing the need for the engine to keep running round to the other end of its train at each end of the line. As quickly as it had arrived the train left for Seaton and the Crossing Keeper returned to open the level crossing gates to road traffic before locking them and returning to his office and peace and quiet, having once more played his small part in the theatre that was the day to day running of the traditional railway. All this was done around thirty times a day (up to 15 trains each way) making it a surprisingly busy piece of railway.\n\nBetween trains though, the Crossing Keepers (there were two, working early and late shifts, changing over at around 2.00pm each day) had little to occupy their time, hence the well-kept gardens and hanging baskets (maintained largely at their own\u00a0 expense) and the vegetable patch behind the concrete hut which they maintained as an allotment in their own time (officially at least). Colyford\u2019s last Station Master had departed in the nineteen-twenties so the men worked without direct supervision other from the occasional visit from the Seaton Station Master. It was a charming, well ordered and often unhurried way of life which had barely changed in nearly a hundred years, although unbeknown to anyone at the time the winds of change were very much in the air. For the time being though, even though the local population had largely ceased using its railway (for local journeys the bus from outside Mr Pritchard\u2019s Post Office was cheaper and more convenient, and for long journeys many chose to get a lift to Axminster from where they could get a main line train without having to carry luggage over the long footbridge at Seaton...

        "text":"New Car\/Review\n\n\n\n\nHowever popular sport utility vehicles may be, there are still plenty of would-be buyers out there who simply don't want the bulk and high running costs associated with many conventionally-sized (read big!) models. It's for these people that Suzuki has developed its all-new 1999 Grand Vitara - a compact, easy-to-handle SUV that offers surprising handling and performance and very commendable styling. And given the recent flurry of news reports about the ''environmental impact'' of SUVs, Suzuki could be poised to build some serious market share with its new rig.\n\nSuzuki has a long-standing reputation for producing compact, affordable SUVs that offer go-anywhere capability, ease of handling and low running costs. The four door Grand Vitara is bigger than any of its Sidekick and Samurai predecessors, but it still falls into a compact category in the SUV market. Even so, it'll handle almost any chore the bigger rigs are capable of.\n\nIt certainly gives up nothing in styling to its more expensive rivals. It looks great from every angle and has a purposeful, wide-track, brawny stance that I find really attractive. Many models come with a very attractive two-tone paint job. The Grand Vitara doesn't look compact until you put it alongside a Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Explorer. Although this is a relatively inexpensive SUV, it gives visual the impression of being quite upscale.\n\nRugged composite bodyside cladding, which extends around the wheel arches, is an excellent protective feature and it looks good too. The rear door swings open and provides easy access to a roomy cargo deck - which can be expanded by folding the back seats. I'm no fan of tailgate-mounted spare wheels, but the Vitara's is at least full-sized and the setup does create more room inside. I suppose that with a compact SUV, there just isn't the room to locate the spare either inside or under the load deck.\n\nOne thing I didn't warm to was the power door lock arrangement. Although the key will lock all the doors, it only opens the driver's side. You have to reach inside and fiddle with a button while your passengers stand around in the rain. I found this a constant annoyance and wished that Suzuki had opted for a more convenient setup.\n\nThe Grand Vitara is powered by a very satisfying 155 horsepower V-6 that proved to be surprisingly refined on the highway and quite a ''stump-puller'' off-road. It's quite a bit more powerful than its Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 rivals in the compact class. The Suzuki's V-6 is a sophisticated little motor with four cams and 24 valves working away inside. Not too many SUVs - especially inexpensive ones like the Grand Vitara - boast such a high-tech powerplant.\n\nI did some serious off -road drives over very demanding territory with the Grand Vitara and it came through showing almost Jeep-like capability. I drove the vehicle on one day-long foray into the mountains around Whistler, crossing old washed-out logging roads and negotiating steep boulder-strewn grades. This little rig will take you just about anywhere when the going gets rough and no owner should feel hesitant about taking a Grand Vitara into the boonies..\n\nMy tester, which I drove for an extended period incidentally, was equipped with a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission which didn't seem to clip off too much power. Four wheel drive - high or low range - is engaged with a secondary shift lever and there are no locking hubs to grapple with. You can also order your Grand Vitara with a 5-speed manual gearbox. Interestingly, neither the CR-V or the RAV4 offer a two-speed transfer case - even as an option. They don't offer a V-6 engine either and Suzuki undercuts them both on price.\n\nAiding performance on and off-road is an all-new 5-link rear suspension. Tackling a couple of runs up and down the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler, I was amazed at the Grand Vitara's handling prowess. It powers round tight turns like a decent sedan - and maybe a little more competently than some.\n\nBraking is taken care of with front discs and rear drums and ABS is standard - not always the case in this class. Other features include dual air bags, side impact beams and three-point seatbelts at all outboard positions. Rear passengers also get head restraints, which must be removed when setting up the truck for full cargo capacity. My tester was trimmed in a good-looking and seemingly durable cloth which was comfortable and easy to keep clean.\n\nThe snazzy exterior is complemented by an excellent cabin with clear instruments, easy-to-reach controls, lots of oddment space and more headroom than any Stetson-clad cowboy - or gal - could wish for.\n\nI drove this Grand Vitara over a three-month period, on and off road, and it never missed a beat. The test didn't reveal a single flaw, which says a lot for a small automaker that seems to be making a big name for itself. A base Grand Vitara costs a very reasonable $22,995 (CDN), though options can push it close to thirty grand. Suzuki will soon launch a less expensive ''standard'' Vitara in short wheelbase two-door form. This model will also come as a convertible like its Sidekick predecessor.\n\nHome | Buyers Guides By Make | New Car Buyers Guide | Used Car Super Search | Total New Car Costs | Car Reviews Truck Reviews\nAutomotive News | TACH-TV | Media\u00a0Library | Discount Auto Parts\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1996-2015 The Auto Channel.

        "text":"An empty, dry tunnel under the East River.\n\nOn a normal day, New York\u2019s subway system is magical. That the largest city in the United States, one of the densest and tallest places on Earth, should have running beneath it an intricate, extensive series of tubes linked at various places to the surface is an achievement we rarely reflect upon. Right now, as they have been for months, crews are digging a new tunnel along Second Avenue, a brand new subway line, under homes and stores and businesses like it\u2019s just the regular way things are done.\n\nPublic transit is never simple, but when it\u2019s done elegantly and well, it seems like simplicity incarnate. Go down, get on the train, get off where you wanted to be.\n\nSandy shook that. For a week, the subways were soaked and silent. For the first two days after the storm, New Yorkers were immobile. But only for two days. What happened next, as the head of one riders\u2019 advocacy group told the Times, \u201cborders on the edge of magic.\u201d\n\nIt has been less than two weeks since the most devastating storm in the New York City subway system\u2019s 108-year history. Seven tunnels beneath the East River flooded. Entire platforms were submerged. Underground equipment, some of it decades old, was destroyed.\n\nThe damage was the worst that the system had ever seen. And yet, the subways have come back \u2014 quicker than almost anyone could have imagined.\n\nThe Times article outlines how that happened, focusing on the Metropolitan Transit Authority\u2019s head, Joe Lhota, and his agency\u2019s preparations for and response to unprecedented flooding.\n\nAt some points, the story \u2014 which you should go read immediately \u2014 reads like a disaster movie.\n\nAt the same time, Joseph Leader, the subway\u2019s chief maintenance officer, went into South Ferry. No one knew the barriers outside the station had given way, Mr. Leader said, breached apparently by 15-foot hunks of wood that, late last week, remained strewed across the mezzanine, beside the turnstiles.\n\nAs he lurched into the terminal, the water had already risen over the platform. When it began climbing the stairs, Mr. Leader fled. He made his way on foot toward the darkened loop track, approaching Rector Street, training his flashlight ahead. \u201cYou could just see it rising, coming up the tracks,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized, I can\u2019t stay here much longer.\u201d\n\nThe South Ferry subway station, submerged.\n\nThe most remarkable part of the story is how the MTA recovered. Bus bridges \u2014 impromptu routes using city buses \u2014 were the first response, even as trains began running limited routes.\n\nTest trains began running partial routes on Wednesday. But with power still out in Lower Manhattan, no trains could run between Manhattan and Brooklyn. If not for the power loss, officials said, the No. 4 and 5 trains could have very likely returned during the week. \u2026\n\nCharles Gordanier, the authority\u2019s chief map designer, began drafting changes to the old subway map, fading out the lines that were without service. Copies were released to the public on Wednesday, and have since been updated as service is restored.\n\nThe bus bridges created winding lines and widespread gridlock, resulting from a simple math problem, Mr. Prendergast said: Between 1,500 and 2,000 people can pile into a train. A bus can fit no more than 75 or so.\n\nAccordingly, connecting the boroughs by subway was the next priority. Late Friday, as the power returned, officials were confident they could restore full service to some trains, like the Lexington Avenue line and the No. 7, almost immediately. By Saturday morning, they had, and several other connections between boroughs followed.\n\n(Transportation Nation has a nice profile of how Gordanier made the constantly updated maps.)\n\nService is still not back completely. But given the apocalyptic predictions that preceded the storm, the amount of progress made has been almost incredible.\n\nLast night, I jumped on the downtown 2 express train into lower Manhattan. It wasn\u2019t until I got off at Chambers Street that I remembered that the journey had been amazing, something that a week and a half ago would have been a privilege. Riding it as usual, it was just another subway trip, unremarkable. Simple.\n\nMagic in plain sight.",

        "text":"Road Tests: 2015 BMW i3\n\nTraditional BMW driver need not apply\n\nThe electric i3 is the most important BMW of the moment, the car that resulted when the German brand strained the whole of its R&D effort and $3.7 billion through a filter of sustainability and efficiency. Ironically, the car became a resource pig, sucking the company's other product budgets dry and watering down its more mainstream offerings. BMW has risked its entire business on the development of this car, so it had better be amazing.\n\nMunich's press materials tout the i3 as the \"world's first premium car designed from the ground up to be powered by an electric drive system.\" Maybe the Bavarians have forgotten about the Tesla Model S, but at least the i3 is constructed unconventionally. Instead of a unibody, the i3 consists of three discrete members: An aluminum chassis locates the running gear, a carbon-fiber passenger cell provides occupant protection, and thermoplastic body panels keep the elements out of the interior.\n\nThe resulting vehicle is claimed to weigh as little as 2635 pounds. Given that the car holds a 450-pound lithium-ion battery, that's seriously impressive. But at more than 17 inches shorter than a Nissan Leaf, the rear-drive i3 isn't large. Ingress to the two-person rear seat requires opening the layered rear suicide door and climbing over a wide honeycomb-carbon-fiber sill. Once in, passengers are trapped with no openable window and no way out unless someone opens a front door first.\n\nLuckily, the i3's cabin is an interesting place to be. The ultramodern, minimalist dash uses two floating LCD screens. The chic interior is peppered with angles, curves, and plenty of eco-thoughtful materials. The door panels even include carbon-fiber scraps left over from production of the passenger cell.\n\nThe i3 looks intriguing, and as a package, it almost makes financial sense\u2014the $42,275 base price is only five and a half grand more than a loaded Leaf, a car that looks almost as strange but lacks the cachet of a BMW badge on its rump.\n\nIronically, the BMW's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, and the one thing it has over every other city-focused EV, is something the company doesn't like to talk about. BMW engineers insist the i3's optional range-extending gasoline engine is a nonevent. This isn't Chevy Volt overkill\u2014it's a simple 34-hp, 650-cc, two-cylinder scooter engine attached to a generator and mounted under the cargo hold. It works in conjunction with a 2.4-gallon gas tank and exists solely get you home when the battery runs out. If you've ever run out of juice in an EV in the middle of nowhere in the dark, you'll think this option is worth every penny. Hell, if you've ever run out of power in the middle of a city in broad daylight, you'll know the engine is worth whatever it costs. You'd be insane to not buy it.\n\nSo why don't the Germans want to acknowledge it? They're too busy pretending the i3 is the world's first all-electric car, and an internal-combustion backup dilutes that message. On a cynical bent, you could posit that BMW wants to earn brownie points with government agencies demanding electric cars. More rationally, it just seems like denial.\n\nGovernments want EVs, but to date, the market has shown consumers don't. Not small, unpretty electric city cars anyway\u2014despite a $200-per-month leasing special, Nissan moves fewer than 2000 Leafs each month. That's barely more than the Tesla Model S, because the Tesla is gorgeous, priced rationally, and drives like an absolute dream.\n\nUnfortunately, the drive is where the i3 falls apart. Our time at the wheel consisted of 15 minutes on a cone course. The first thing I scribbled into my notebook: \"This ain't no Tesla. It's not a BMW, either.\"\n\nThreading an i3 through a slalom feels like autocrossing an X5 on snow tires three sizes too narrow. The battery pack is mounted in the floor, Tesla-style, helping to keep the center of gravity low, but you'd never know it. The tall body cranks into the air, lists like a sailboat, and settles into tire-chattering understeer at what feels like a walking pace.\n\nTire size can't help. The i3's low-rolling-resistance, 155\/70R-19 Bridgestones are nearly 1.5 inches narrower than the rear tire on BMW's S 1000 RR motorcycle. The 1970s-tall sidewall is likely a boon to ride quality, as is the lack of a rear anti-roll bar, but it does the chassis no favors.\n\nBMW says weight distribution is nearly 50\/50 front-to-rear, but there's no balanced behavior here. The overboosted steering is devoid of feedback, and at high speed, the understeer becomes snap oversteer paired with pucker-worthy stability-control interventions that seem to be the only thing keeping the car's wheels on the ground.\n\nAt least the brakes feel great. The i3 uses Tesla-style accelerator mapping (full regeneration hits when you come off the gas), leaving a brake pedal free of the typical unpredictability of a blended brake system. The 11,000-rpm electric motor uses a clever magnet design that helps power production at high shaft speeds. Consequently, the i3 is quick to its 93-mph top speed, and BMW says 60 mph arrives in around seven seconds.\n\nIn the European NEDC driving cycle, the i3 is rated at 118 miles of range, which isn't that impressive. (The much-heavier Leaf is rated at 124 miles, and its battery is barely larger than the BMW's.) Sure, there's that optional range-extender, but with no more electric range than a conventional EV, why the skinny tires and mega-expensive construction?\n\nAt a moment when even the once-unassailable 3-series seems unnecessarily compromised on grounds of cost and efficiency, it's hard to figure out what the Bavarian company stands for nowadays. I got an answer following the drive. Pointing to an app that links the i3 with public transit, Google Maps, and a network of BMW-managed parking lots and electric providers, a senior BMW planner said, \"this is to sell mobility, not to sell cars. We are a mobility company\u2014with good-driving cars.\"\n\nSilly us for being behind the times. They say branding matters more than ever, right?

        "text":"A Short History of the Modern Van\n\nJamie Lincoln Kitman\n\nJamie Lincoln Kitman | Sep 02, 2011\n\nObservers as diverse as Karl Marx and Bachman-Turner-Overdrive have long understood, the working man always gets the short end of the stick. Take van drivers, for instance.\n\nIn the old countries of Europe, they frequently make fun of White Van Man, an un-socialized, unsociable misanthrope with a powerful need to get somewhere in a hurry, one who proceeds without sufficient reference to what might stand in his way or to the fact that he is in no condition to drive his white van, due to impairment by any one of the hundred illegal substances coursing through his bloodstream. Or perhaps it is a full-blown psychosis? Place him behind the wheel of a white van, and the young man\u2019s deep-seated homicidal tendencies blossom.\n\nOh you big European blouses. Sounds to me like any driver from Boston, Massachusetts, irrespective of age, gender, creed or association with the Brothers Magliozzi (though this last attribute doesn't hurt).\n\nWe don\u2019t have the concept of White Van Man here in the United States, where the freedom to drive badly is a birthright. Instead, the true affront to the American working man is the fact that he doesn\u2019t really drive a white van. That is, we don\u2019t even have vans as good as the white ones Europeans send into battle. Big European vans -- think Sprinter vans -- tend to be taller and narrower than their American counterparts, but they\u2019re also faster, more economical, and more nimble. They weigh less, but they carry more. That\u2019s because they are altogether more modern -- diesel-powered, unibodied instead of body on frame -- and, in a word, better.\n\nFord Transit Connect (Rudolf Stricker)\n\nSmall vans, an option we're only getting around to seeing with the commendable Ford Transit Connect (and not even in its most efficient diesel form), are also everywhere in Europe, while we make due with vans that are often larger and thirstier than need be, not unlike the cars many of us drive, and, come to think of it, us.\n\nTo think that the surrender monkeys of France are driving around in vans superior to that of my van-driving brethren here in America, well, it burns my deep-fried, artificially flavored, apple pie pride. And I am a not infrequent van driver by virtue of my close professional associations with the sort of down-market rock bands who don\u2019t always get to tour in million-dollar custom coaches. I\u2019ve done my time in Ford Econolines and my music management company just sold a Sprinter we used for nine years and 170,000 miles as a crew and gear transporter, so I know of whence I speak.\n\nOf course, we have no one to blame here but American industry. Van technology on this side of the pond has been stifled by an all-too-obvious, gentleman\u2019s non-compete agreement; a tacit understanding that the steady demand for work vehicles makes sales inevitable and therefore investment in product development a pointless luxury.\n\nIt was plain that the prospect of easy profits had overtaken all other considerations when Chevrolet let its van hit a semi-Jurassic seventeen years before introducing the only modestly updated Express in 1995 -- and guess what? It's still here 16 years later. Ford took an identically relaxed approached to its 1975 Econoline, which hung on seventeen years, too, until 1992, when its development costs and their amortization were distant memories. Most customers were never the wiser that close to a dozen and a half years of key developments in road-ability and safety had passed them by.\n\nFord Econoline\n\nToday, the replacement for the Econoline -- no spring chicken at age nineteen -- is on a drawing board, somewhere, we hope, unless they lost the drawing board. Though we can seriously thank Ford for the Connect, like I said, but if they really respected American vannistas they'd sell us a diesel.\n\nWe can take a moment to blame the accomplished European van makers who\u2019ve failed to bring their wares here (Volkswagen), those who haven't tried hard enough (Fiat\/IVECO -- coming soon to a Ram dealer near you, one expects), or those who haven\u2019t even tried at all (Peugeot, Renault, etc.). But history buffs will know that the lifetime non-achievement prize goes to Chrysler. Its Dodge Tradesman (later Ram) went into service around the time man landed on the moon and was only laid to rest in 2001. It is an enduring testimony to engineering sloth, spanning five decades, yet still on the road today, to show us just how bad they used to build them in the old days.\n\nOf course, one of the few happy moments in Van World (and also in the disastrous Daimler-Chrysler merger), occurred when Team Germany helped the under-funded Chrysler side, in 2002, by giving it access to the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, which, I found as a satisfied customer, took the van-building game to a whole 'nother level. Sold first as a Freightliner, then badged as a Dodge, before becoming a Mercedes-Benz as well as a Freightliner (which are the two nameplates it is now sold under following the dissolution of DaimlerChrysler), the Sprinter was so obviously fit for the task of replacing a van whose life spanned almost a third of a century that then-Chrysler boss Dieter Zetsche laid plans to assemble as many as 100,000 a year at a new, purpose-built plant in Alabama. But then the German combine\u2019s growing penury reared its ugly head and the new plant was cancelled from on high. Instead of 100,000 units, 8,000 to10,000 Sprinters would be assembled each year from knocked-down kits sent from Germany at a small facility set up in South Carolina; which is where Sprinter -- frightfully expensive, on account of short supply and no competition -- stands now.\n\n2007 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Thomas Doefer)\n\nIn the wake of Chrysler's ultimate cop out, Ford shelved plans to build a new, tall van to replace the Econoline, which soldiers ever on. Meanwhile, last year, Nissan followed the American makers' lead. Like Ford and GM, the Japanese firm actually knows how to build a decent, modern, economical, diesel-powered, unibody van for customers outside of the U.S. (as opposed to the hoary body-on-frame jobs they're foisting on us now). But with the new NV line of high-roofed vans it introduced, Nissan has jumped into the fray, building not what is right but with a half-hearted variation on what the Americans are already doing wrong. Take away its high roof and startlingly off-putting looks and you have another 12 mpg, body-on-frame V8 van that fails not only to move the van game forward but manages to not even get an inch closer to the standard of the rest of the civilized world. Sharing much with their not very successful Titan pick-up brethren, another shameless and shameful bid to beat the Americans at their own cynical game, the NV reminds us that van drivers are still being treated here like the Third World-ers for whom carmakers have saved their worst, most backward products.\n\nVan drivers of the world unite. It's time take care of business.\n\nGet the Car Talk Newsletter",

        "text":"1977 Pontiac Can Am - Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\n\nWritten by on February 10, 2008 Pontiac's Star-Crossed 1977 Can Am Was The Best Musclecar That Never Had A Chance.\n1977 Pontiac Can Am - Boulevard Of Broken Dreams View All 8 Photos\n0802phr 01 Z+1977 Pontiac Can Am+ 1\/8 Russell Wells of Spring, TX, owns this Can Am equipped with the T\/A 6.6 engine. He found it in Tennessee in 2001 while searching for a 1966-'67 LeMans and bought it virtually sight-unseen.\n\nThe '70s was not kind to Pontiac. Aside from the Grand Prix and the Firebird, Pontiac's sales and image were way down from the glorious Wide Track days of the '60s. By 1975, the GTO was gone, and Pontiac seemed more interested in miles per gallon than miles per hour.\n\nGM's performance division was in big trouble as sales continued to tumble. One of the flagships of the product lineup had always been the LeMans. Since 1961, the LeMans had been a sporty, intermediate model that provided an alternative to the Firebird. By the late 1960s, more than 80 percent of LeMans sold were two-door models equipped with bucket seats. The average buyer was under 35 years old.\n\nThe LeMans was drastically restyled in 1973, and it was more than just controversial. Styling is always subjective, but the buying public would quickly make their opinion known by staying out of the showroom. Although sales were up over the 1972 LeMans, Pontiac was highly criticized for the car's squarish front end and flat grille while the rear was all curves. One magazine noted it looked as if two totally different designs were screwed together in the middle. The only bright spot in the LeMans line was the European-inspired Grand Am, with its sophisticated styling and balanced suspension.\n\n0802phr 02 Z+1977 Pontiac Can Am+ 2\/8 Mike Petkovich of San Francisco, CA, is the original owner of this 403-powered Can Am. The Olds 403 used in Can Ams was sold only in CA and high-altitude counties and had a \"6.6L\" decal on the shaker.\n\nBy 1976, LeMans sales were down to 96,229, and Pontiac was in damage control. Oldsmobile and Buick's intermediates were chalking up impressive 10-day sales results while the LeMans continued to slide. Pontiac's management was mysti-fied why LeMans sales were sinking to the ground.\n\nThe LeMans failure didn't puzzle Jim Wangers. Wangers had taken a Catalina to the 1960 NHRA Nationals and won Top Stock Eliminator. He was the marketing genius behind the GTO and creator of the 1969 Judge and Trans Am. Wangers knew more about performance cars than anyone in Detroit. He had left Pontiac's ad agency in 1969 but was back as a consultant on another project. Wangers recognized what Pontiac's management didn't-the stale LeMans line needed something to generate excitement and attract customers back into Pontiac dealer showrooms.\n\nWangers found his inspiration in a show car Pontiac had exhibited for the American bicentennial celebration. Pontiac stylist John Schinella had designed a package based on the Grand Am that sported a white body with red, white, and blue striping surrounding the side windows and flowing toward the front, meeting at a point in the center of the hood. Integral air deflectors were placed at the leading sides of the wheel openings, and a rear deck ducktail spoiler carried the name of the car, \"All American.\" A set of stock honeycomb wheels painted white to match the exterior completed the package. The All American made the rounds of auto shows and was shown to several dealer councils, where the car received a warm reception for its sporty looks. They felt it was just the type of package necessary to stimulate the dying LeMans nameplate. Management felt the market was saturated with bicentennial cars in 1976 and made no plans to put the All American into production. Instead, it was parked behind the Pontiac engineering garage and forgotten.\n\n0802phr 03 Z+1977 Pontiac Can Am+ 3\/8 The 403 engine is rated at 185 hp at 3,600 rpm and 320 lb-ft of torque at 2,200 rpm. In the late '70s, before the use of electronic engine controls, emissions systems severely choked horsepower output.\n\nPontiac's General Manager Alex Mair agreed with Wangers that the LeMans needed some pizzazz and commissioned him to work up a proposal. Wangers equated the importance of his idea behind the '69 Judge as a promotion to bring attention back to the GTO. Wangers went right to work. Starting with a 1976 LeMans, he added the All American's rear spoiler, modified the striping to reflect the original 1969 Judge motif of orange and black, and installed the shaker hood from the Trans Am. Wangers included market research that indicated the Judge nameplate still had considerable respect from performance car buyers.\n\nWhen presented with the 1976 Judge proposal, Pontiac management gave it an emphatic thumbs down. They rejected the use of the Judge nameplate, and the package as presented was unacceptable. Pontiac had missed the entire thrust of Wangers' proposal. \"I licked my wounds and put my ideas away,\" Wangers recalls, \"and participated in watching Pontiac continue on its way to the grave.\"\n\n0802phr 04 Z+1977 Pontiac Can Am+ 4\/8 The Can Am's sumptuous interior included the beautiful Grand Prix instrument panel. Since the Grand Prix was simply a stretched version of the LeMans A-body chassis, the GP instrument panel bolted right in.\n\nThe idea of a packaged car to put some pop into the LeMans wouldn't die, however. Mair was intrigued with Wangers' idea and instructed Ben Harrison, who was responsible for new markets, to work with him on another proposal. Harrison had been responsible for the idea to redesign the 1969 Grand Prix that breathed new life into that dying model.\n\nWangers dusted off his Judge proposal and showed it to Harrison. They both agreed it was a base from which to work. Harrison knew it was important to get the backing of Pontiac's design staff if any project was to succeed, so they went back to the All American once again. This time, the package would be built around the introduction of the 400-cid T\/A 6.6 engine in the LeMans, set for a 1977 release.\n\nHarrison and Wangers began with a Cameo White LeMans sports coupe and installed the All American's ducktail spoiler. The Trans Am shaker hood was lifted off Wangers' Judge since they felt it had a powerful performance image needed in the package. A three-color stripe of orange, gold, and yellow flowed from the bottom of the C pillar to the front of the car, meeting in a point at the center of the hood. To make the car even more distinctive from a standard LeMans, the Grand Prix instrument panel was installed and white Pontiac Rally II wheels were added. Working with engineering, it was determined that the M40 Turbo Hydramatic was needed in place of the LeMans Turbo 350. To enhance the car's ride and handling, Pontiac's sophisticated Radial Tuned Suspension was added. The RTS featured higher-rate springs and shocks, with fat stabilizer bars in the front and rear and GR70 x 15-inch steel-belted radial tires.\n\n0802phr 05 Z+1977 Pontiac Can Am+ 5\/8 John Schinella designed the 1976 All American Grand Am show car for the bicentennial celebration. It was the inspiration for the Can Am.\n\nSchinella was pleased that Harrison and Wangers had used his All American as a base. However, he was opposed to using the Trans Am's shaker hood. He soon changed his mind, realizing the importance of the performance image so desperately needed. With design and engineering both signing off on the proposal, it was almost time to bring the car to management for approval. All that was needed was a name.\n\nHarrison once again went back to the All American and took a pair of scissors to one of the decals. He cut out the letters \"A-M\" and \"C-A-N\" off the decal, rearranged them to spell CAN AM, and had new ones made for the proposal's hood, fenders, and rear spoiler. The car now had a name and a personality that vibrated with power and performance.\n\n0802phr 06 Z+1977 Pontiac Can Am+ 6\/8 The ducktail spoiler borrowed from the All American Grand Am enhanced the Can Am's appearance. Wangers knew the Can Am would give the LeMans lineup a sales lift.\n\nMair liked the new presentation and approved the Can Am over the protests of his sales and production managers. Their main concern was the use of the Grand Prix instrument panel. The Grand Prix was extremely profitable for Pontiac, and installing it in the Can Am would reduce Grand Prix production and company profits. Mair overruled the objections, and plans were made to produce 5,000 1977 Can Ams.\n\nBecause the Can Am would require special tooling for the shaker hood, spoiler, and other modifications, it couldn't be completed on the Pontiac assembly line. Instead, local Detroit company Motortown was tapped to do the work. It would develop the tools necessary to cut out the hole in the hood for the shaker and produce the tool for the rear spoiler.\n\nProduction began at the Pontiac assembly plant in mid-April 1977 on Cameo White LeMans coupes with the T\/A 6.6 engine, the GP dash, RTS suspension, and Turbo 400 transmission. Then, in what's known as \"interrupt shipping,\" the cars were sent to Motortown, where the spoiler, stripes, and shaker hood with the Trans Am shaker were installed. The completed cars were then shipped back to Pontiac, which in turn distributed them to dealers.\n\n0802phr 07 Z+1977 Pontiac Can Am+ 7\/8 The Grand Prix's instrument panel added upscale luxury to the Can Am's interior. Full instrumentation was standard with the GP dash. The three-spoke Custom Sport steering wheel was an extra-cost option.\n\nIn the meantime, Wangers was charged with promoting the Can Am. Doing what he did best, Wangers put together a magazine ad using shots of the Can Am and the headline, \"Remember the Goat!\" \"It was the first and only time,\" Wangers says, \"that Pontiac ever acknowledged the nickname for the GTO.\"\n\nWangers also prepared Can Ams for the automotive press, just as he had with GTOs 10 years earlier. The enthusiastic press praised the... (truncated)",

        "text":"The $92,000 Volvo: Has the Volvo 1800 just emerged from its cult-niche status?\n\n1973 1800 ES\n\nNinety-two thousand dollars for a Volvo? That must have been some Volvo that sold at the Bonhams Auction at the Greenwich Concours d\u2019 Elegance this past June. It was a 1973 1800ES sport wagon, and it was a new record for a Volvo, according to Bonhams.\n\nIt was also practically a new car \u2014 \u201cbeautifully preserved\u201d Bonhams said \u2014 and with just 13,000 original miles. Until this sale, the most frequent mention of mileage in conjunction with a Volvo 1800 was a red 1966 model that\u2019s traveled 3 million miles in the hands of its original owner, Irv Gordon. Volvo has gotten a lot of positive publicity helping to promote that car.\n\nBut $92,000?\u00a0Hagerty\u2019s valuation for a 1973 1800 ES shows an average of $12,000 and a high of about $27,000. So the Greenwich sale certainly seems like an anomaly. Is the sporty little Volvo about to emerge from its own niche following?\n\nHigh-mile 1800\u2019s are certainly more common than the Greenwich auction car. Volvo, in fact, had marketed the P1800 model on the strength of its durability, especially compared to high-end European sports cars. One of the ads for the car showed it doing something no Ferrari or Maserati driver would do: driving through a mud puddle. The headline, \u201cDriving isn\u2019t bad for it,\u201d was a nod to owners who were afraid to drive their \u201cfragile\u201d European GT cars out in nature.\n\nVolvo also played up the 1800\u2019s \u201cEuropean styling,\u201d featuring Ferraris, Maseratis and Aston-Martins in some ads. One headline read, \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a souped-down Ferrari.\u201d The self-deprecating copy suggested that sports cars didn\u2019t need to have a 160-mph top speed to be fun \u2014 that 110 mph was adequate. Volvo extolled a different performance measurement: \u201cAt 90 mph, it uses no more gasoline than a Volkswagen uses at 70 \u2014 all you need is a highway to enjoy this kind of performance.\u201d Of course, driving a VW Beetle at 70 mph was probably never a good idea anyway.\n\nVolvo introduced the P1800 in 1962, a sports coupe built on the mechanicals of the sturdy 122 sedan. The design was quite un-Volvo, and the work had long been credited to the Italian design house Frua, which had done some Maseratis. But that was not the case. Pelle Petterson, a young Swedish designer who later designed yachts, had drawn the car. (He did work for Frua for a time, however.)\n\nWithout its badges, the Volvo P1800 could have fooled casual observers into thinking it had Italian parentage, and that perhaps there was something more potent than a 100-hp 1.8-liter four-cylinder sedan engine under the long hood. Many got their first look at the sporty Volvo as Simon Templar\u2019s ride in the TV show, \u201cThe Saint.\u201d The show\u2019s producers had reportedly approached Jaguar about getting free use of an E-Type for the show but were turned down.\n\n\u201cThe Saint\u201d wasn\u2019t the only British connection. For its first two years of production, the Volvo P1800 was contract-assembled for Volvo by Jensen, using body panels from another company. Jensen was also contract-building bodies for the Austin-Healey 3000.\n\nThe early P1800s were certainly not fast, doing 0-to-60 in about 12 seconds.\u00a0 Performance improvements came, including a big change in 1969 with electronic fuel injection and four-wheel disc brakes. The 60-mph dash was under 10 seconds, quicker than most affordable British roadsters. Fuel injection was a big deal \u2013 something that few sports cars had, not even Ferrari.\n\nPerformance parts were available, too, and Volvo advertised the 1800\u2019s two SCCA F-Production championships. (The \u201cP\u201d was eventually dropped.) So, the \u201csouped-down Ferrari\u201d had a racing heritage, too.\n\nThe $92,000 Volvo at Greenwich was from the end of the 1800 line. For 1972, Volvo redesigned the coupe into a sport wagon, the 1800ES, with a roomy cargo hatch. Its 2.0-liter fuel-injected engine offered 125 horsepower, prompting Volvo\u2019s advertising double entendre, \u201cThe sports car that really hauls.\u201d\n\nProduction of the 1800ES was low, however, with just under 8,100 built in two years. One of them just fetched nearly 100 grand. Make a note of that.\n\n  \u2022 1\n  \u2022 \/\n  \u2022 3\nRead next Up next: Club Corner: Ryan Counterman, CORSA",

        "text":"Cascadia Header Graphic\nPrinter Friendly Version\nDotted Line\nThe Cascadia Conundrum: Balkanized Transportation\n\nBy: Knute Berger\nOctober 4, 2011\n\nLink to Original Article\n\nThe Cascadia Center has been affiliated with the Discovery Institute, known for its advocacy of \"intelligent design.\" Cascadia has balanced Discovery's charter because its expertise is \"unintelligent design,\" namely regional transportation. Everyone agrees those problems are man-made.\n\nCascadia was founded in the 1990s to push a regional agenda aimed at infrastructure and economics in the larger region, and especially focusing on the Vancouver-to-Eugene corridor. They urge high-speed rail, freight mobility, they even helped cook up the downtown tunnel as an Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement option. Bruce Agnew, a former staffer for onetime Republican Congressman and Seattle City Councilman John Miller, runs Cascadia, and the group has been partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They're now looking at a more distant relationship with Discovery, which will likely make some potential funders more comfortable, especially greens for whom anti-science conservatism is anathema.\n\nThe bigger picture is that the Cascadia Center has been a less airy-fairy advocate of regional coordination and cooperation. It emphasizes Cascadia's joint economic clout as opposed to its green-corner-of-the-world feel. Cascadia as an economic zone, not an isolated Ecotopian Alamo. The center has been concerned with how to get people and goods, and ideas, back and forth across the Canadian border, for example.\n\nAgnew, at a recent meeting with Crosscut staff, talked at length about lessons that can be imported from British Columbia, where public-private partnerships (P3's in transpo jargon) have helped build highways, bridges, hospitals, and schools. This in \"socialist\" Canada. There are opportunities here too, especially if banks and investment funds get more active and the gap between public funding and infrastructure appetites continues to grow. The 520 bridge is a couple billion dollars short: Could the private sector step in and win a contract to manage it, with the inevitable tolls, to the benefit of both public and private interests? Could public employee or union pension funds invest in such projects to make a reasonable return and keep their people in jobs? Cascadia originally envisioned the downtown tunnel as a P3.\n\nThere are plenty of other, smaller opportunities for P3s as well, including some kind of multi-use redevelopment of Colman Dock on the Seattle waterfront. The ferry system might be an ideal agency to experiment with them, matching need (new docks and terminals) with amenities for tourists, commuters, maybe even housing. Why not?\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to progress in transportation is balkanization, and Puget Sound is a poster child. It's tough, says Agnew, to do even simple stuff that can make a difference. The ORCA card? That no-brainier took only took eight years and $35 million, Agnew said. There are plenty of arbitrary boundaries here that impact our ability to move broadly and nimbly. It's an old complaint, but it's a real one: we have too many cooks in the kitchen; our process fetish leaves many opportunities for parochial monkey-wrenching. He points to the example that along Highway 99, each city has a separate contract with different companies to manage the traffic lights. Instead of having synchronized traffic signals along its length, let alone smart lights that read and adjust lights in real time to traffic levels, the corridor is more of a bottleneck than need be. Imagine the savings in time, congestion, and pollution if it something as simple as traffic lights were coordinated?\n\nCreating a new regional governance system for Puget Sound always raises big fears and suspicions. Back in the 1950s and '60s when Metro was formed, it was portrayed a kind of spider at the center of a Big Government web. Many suburban cities opted out, and the water cleanup was eventually limited mostly too Lake Washington, but the larger plan, which would have included lakes and sewage systems throughout the region, was whittled down. Local opt-outs and funding based on location rather than need are also problems. Regional government and planning reform are shot down by local interests, fear of big government, and distrust of Seattle.\n\nThe latter is important. The creature at the center of the web is often identified as the region's biggest city, widely regarded by the communities around it with the kind regard one would have, if we mix animal metaphors a bit, for a badly behaved 900-pound gorilla. (Bobo, Woddland Park's fabled ape, was fun to look at in his cage, but he treated female companion Fifi miserably and loved throwing his weight around and hogging all the cake.)\n\nNo one trusts Seattle with power because it is believed the city will always exercise it to its own advantage, and\/or that it will pursue a screwball agenda with no basis in reality for other municipalities. The fact that the Eastside end of 520 is underway while the Seattle side is still embroiled in (some legitimate) design issues is but the latest example. People fear that Seattle-style dysfunction will swallow them \u2014 or they'll catch it like a case of civic cooties. Nor is Seattle regarded as a particularly inspiring role model, as the hubbub over then-Bremerton Mayor Cary Bozeman's critique of Seattle's treatment of its own waterfront and Pioneer Square revealed. Seattle isn't the paragon of urban design it pretends to be.\n\nSeattle is the dominant center of Pugetopolis, but has embraced a central-city growth ethic that puts it in competition with its neighbors. And Bellevue, which was barely even visible from Seattle 40 years ago, has literally grown up as a kind of rebuke to Seattle's dominance and self-regard. Other communities are competing for growth and population and power, too. All those urban growth nodes in the suburbs want their share. It was ever thus on the Sound, where regional rivalries have been intense at least since Seattle and Tacoma tried to kill each other off over the railroad.\n\nInstead of being bossed around by Seattle, many suburbs have simply been turning into Seattle, becoming more dense, more diverse, and better places for starving artists to find vital immigrant communities, cheap housing, and work space. The Seattleizing (or Brooklynizing) of the suburbs has been going on a while \u2014 Starbucks helped lead the charge in the '90s by colonizing regional shopping centers; the job is being extended by strip mall ethnic eateries. The Eastside, as it has become more dense and more populated by Microsofters, has also trended bluer politically, turning more purple than the reliable red that it used to be. The days when the old Bellevue American was the most John Birch Society-friendly weekly in the state seem faraway and long ago.\n\nOne battle to watch is the fight over light rail in Bellevue. The rail effort could be sabotaged by a Tim Eyman initiative and Bellevue's retail Robert Moses, Kemper Freeman, Jr. is a mighty opponent of Sound Transit and proponent of his own interests. Freeman does not want to see Seattle values dominate on the Eastside, which is still car-oriented and rich with development potential. (Back in the '90s, the late Eastsideweek ran a spoof campaign for Eastside secession and it was very popular with readers.)\n\nWhile Freeman has been a huge booster of urban-style development in downtown Bellevue, it's not necessarily in his interest to see the city's center of gravity shift to other corridors. Sound Transit's Eastside rail poses both the threat of big, spendy government, a big-city culture and political shift, and a redrawing of the real estate chessboard. (Freeman is a big funder of Tim Eyman's new anti-toll, anti-Eastside-rail initiative.) Another way to view light rail is as a potential boon for the suburbs, just as the building of floating bridges was. But the very concept of regional rail carries the baggage of Seattle hegemony.\n\nIt will be very tough to rewrite regional governance without getting over some of these old barriers. Seattle's recent behavior hasn't done its image any good. The fight over the downtown tunnel, the broken promises and costs of light rail, the bike-centric philosophy of the mayor and his brain-trust, the sense that Seattle isn't a team player, never will be. Greg Nickels, who had a can-do orientation in terms of big projects, was seen as too Seattle-centric. So, too, Schell, Rice, and Royer before him. Nickels once raised the idea of Seattle secession to express his frustration with the rest of the region, and Olympia, for not bending to local will. Part of the problem lies in the Seattle utopian attitude that wraps its ideas in moral superiority. Seattle mayors are out to save the world. The mayor of Federal Way or Renton \u2014 they just want to get stuff done. It doesn't help that Nickels posed in Vanity Fair and Mike McGinn is the cover-boy for Dope.\n\nSo, Cascadia still looks best from 10,000 feet, where the political and jurisdictional borders disappear, geography seems to have more logic, neighbors are much closer, the problems shrunk to invisibility. We can all feel like Paul Bunyan at that altitude, ready to reshape the region with the swing of an axe and the horns of an ox.\n\nAgnew has said he is fascinated by the concept of the Salish Sea, which is another approach to a Cascadia-like concept. It defines a geographic entity. It speaks to having a shared stake in something bigger and border-bridging. it reflects the heritage of native tribes that traded and cooperated (and still do), share a common language, and had a common sense of place. Is there a way to shape a broader civic and commercial Cascadian \u2014 or Salishan \u2014 tribal council? That might be a way to bring some intelligent design to the workaday challenges of our region.\n\n\nKnute Berger is Mossback, Crosscut's chief Northwest native. He ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Rise of Sharing Economy Benefits Businesses, Consumers & Sustainability\n\nBy: | May 29th, 2016\n\nSharing Economy\n\nSharing Economy (Image Courtesy www.greenfunding.it)\n\nThe Information Technology (IT) revolution has brought many gifts and some would argue, many headaches, to modern society. Creative destruction has seen whole industries (newspapers, music) destroyed or significantly transformed and new industries (robotics, nanotechnology) rise.\n\nOne of the more interesting developments enabled by IT has been the sharing economy, sometimes referred to as the collaborative economy or the on-demand economy. The basic principle is that consumers temporarily pay for a product or service rather than buying and owning it. This arrangement eliminates maintenance costs, ongoing costs, and even insurance, putting more money in the pockets of consumers. Companies such as ZipCar, AirBNB, Uber, Lyft, Kickstarter and soon, Google autonomous cars, are transforming the way people live their day-to-day lives, businesses plan their operations, and governments deliver their services.\n\nThe Sharing Economy & Environmental Impacts\n\nThe sharing economy will likely have very positive environmental impacts as private vehicle contributions to carbon emissions should decrease as more and more people share gas powered vehicles. One day, gas powered vehicles will be gone, and emissions will drop even more.\n\nImpacting Policymakers\n\nThe rise of car sharing services is now challenging government policymakers to also take advantage of the benefits by incorporating ridesharing services into transportation systems.\u00a0It is expected that more and more innovative ventures in the sharing economy will continue to ring out systematic waste typical of mass production economies, and governments will benefit from this.\n\nThe path to a more widespread sharing economy is not without its hurdles as evidenced by Uber\u2019s constant battles with entrenched interests and business regulations; some local governments are just too hostile at the moment. The question as to whether Uber and Lyft drivers are employees or independent contractors isn\u2019t important to users who love the service, convenience, and low cost. Some local governments don\u2019t blink an eye at ride-sharing services while others maintain intense opposition leading to slightly altered sharing service business models.\n\nSharing Economy\n\nSharing Economy (Image Courtesy www.campbellmithun.com)\n\nTransforming Influence on Entire Economy\n\nThe sharing economy is also influencing all other businesses. Sharing services have significant savings and efficiencies to offer businesses, altering standard business models. Even B2B companies are benefiting from the sharing economy as sharing services improve efficiency, quickness of service delivery, and lead to better profits.\n\nEntrepreneurship & Sustainability\n\nThe sharing economy is made for both entrepreneurs and sustainability and represents a better, more efficient modern society. The Internet Society of China estimated that in 2015 China\u2019s sharing economy was worth $300 billion and employed over 500 million people. No other country on the planet, perhaps with the exception of India, needs efficiency more than China.\n\nThe following video discusses how the sharing economy is changing the world.\n\nDavid Russell Schilling\n\nDavid enjoys writing about high technology and its potential to make life better for all who inhabit planet earth.\n\nMore articles from Industry Tap...",

        "text":"Dr. Loren Groff at the NTSB.\n\nThe NTSB\u2019s meeting on the 2009 Red Line Crash continued this afternoon with even more troubling revelations. They also criticized the Board\u2019s lack of safety oversight, which seems unfair for before the crash, but the Board does need to step up now that they know there are problems.\n\nWMATA top management seems to have tragically ignored safety warnings and potential problems for years. The systems generated 8000 \u201calarms\u201d from track circuit errors per week, but according to the NTSB, WMATA safety officials ignored these problems because they assumed the system was \u201cfailsafe.\u201d\n\nSome train operators were instructed to run their trains on manual because there were problems with automatic operation, and operators were being punished for delays.\n\nHowever, NTSB staff also blamed the Board for not doing more on safety. NTSB member Robert Sumwalt also repeatedly brought up the Board\u2019s role during questioning. According to one presentation by Loren Groff, they felt the Board should have not only asked tough questions of top management, but gone around them to conduct their own investigations into the safety operation of the organization.\n\nThat seems unrealistic. It\u2019s probably true the Board could have asked more tough questions. They could have commissioned an Inspector General\u2019s report. But they asked safety questions of the General Manager and got what seemed like satisfactory answers.\n\nAccording to the NTSB discussion, the Board asked the General Manager to explain the top safety incidents and what was being done about them. The Board sees itself as a policy-making body, and doesn\u2019t meddle in day to day operations. Asking the GM for a safety summary seems like the right approach. If the GM\u2019s summary was misleading, it would be nice if Board members had psychically divined this, but it\u2019s hard to see how exactly they could have.\n\nSumwalt also criticized the way the WMATA Board has a committee on Customer Service, Operations, and Safety. \u201cWe at the NTSB only focus on safety,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that committee has to balance customer service with safety.\u201d Yes. It should. Customer service and safety are both important. The NTSB may have the luxury of ignoring everything but safety, but that doesn\u2019t mean that boards or agencies can do so.\n\nThe Board could have constantly asked the General Manager what the agency was doing to comply with NTSB recommendations, said Groff. But we know that many of those recommendations were financially unrealistic. The NTSB members might wish that everyone spent all their time sitting around and only worrying about safety and nothing else, but that\u2019s not how it works in reality.\n\nAnother NTSB member noted that in a hearing, Board Chairman Peter Benjamin previous Board Chairman Jim Graham said he hadn\u2019t heard of the Tri-State Oversight Committee before the crash, though then-General Manager John Catoe was well aware of it. But few of us out in the public had heard of it either. The TOC, by all accounts, operated in obscurity and for some strange reason didn\u2019t feel it could talk to the Board or the public.\n\nWe were all ignorant of the safety problems before the crash. Now, following investigations, it\u2019s clear that there were many organizational problems within WMATA, and the TOC wasn\u2019t functioning properly. I wish that the Board or other leaders had found out and fixed it, but it\u2019s hard to throw stones at leaders who only knew what we knew, and we didn\u2019t know about the problem.\n\nThe fault lies with General Manager Catoe and the safety officials at WMATA. Now, knowing this was such an issue, the Board does have a responsibility to ensure it gets fixed. Now, the Board should delve more deeply into the progress the agency is making on safety. Now, they shouldn\u2019t be satisfied with vague answers from management.\n\nAnd now, if future crashes happen that could have been prevented, it would be fair to blame the Board if they don\u2019t take adequate action. I\u2019m not sure that stepped-up level of oversight is happening. The NTSB said that even today, the Board doesn\u2019t claim responsibility for safety. They\u2019re right that this should change. It should start now.\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve revised the headline and intro paragraph to reflect some further thoughts on what the Board needs to do going forward.\n\nDavid Alpert is Founder and President of Greater Greater Washington and Executive Director of DC Sustainable Transportation (DCST).

        "text":"Lawyers, Not Ethicists, Will Solve the Robocar 'Trolley Problem'\n\nLawyers, Not Ethicists, Will Solve the Robocar 'Trolley Problem'\n\n\nLawyers, Not Ethicists, Will Solve the Robocar 'Trolley Problem'\n\n\nPeople seem more than a bit freaked out by the trolley problem right now. The 60s-era thought experiment, occasionally pondered with a bong in hand, requires that you imagine a runaway trolley barreling down the tracks toward five people. You stand at a railway switch with the power to divert the trolley to another track, where just one person stands. Do you do it?\n\nThis ethical exercise takes on new meaning at the dawn of the autonomous age. Given a similar conundrum, does a robocar risk the lives of five pedestrians, or its passengers? Of course, it isn't the car making the decision. The software engineers are making it, cosseted in their dim engineering warrens. They will play God. Or so the theory goes.\n\nGiving machines the ability to decide who to kill is a staple of dystopian science fiction. And it explains why three out of four American drivers say they are afraid of self-driving cars. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration even suggested creating something of an \"ethical\" test for companies developing the technology.\n\nBut the good news is, that point might be moot. In a paper published in Northwestern University Law Review, Stanford University researcher Bryan Casey deems the trolley problem irrelevant. He argues that it's already been solved\u2014not by ethicists or engineers, but by the law. The companies building these cars will \u201cless concerned with esoteric questions of right and wrong than with concrete questions of predictive legal liability,\u201d he writes. Meaning, lawyers and lawmakers will sort things out.\n\nSolving the Trolley Problem\n\n\u201cThe trolley problem presents already solved issues\u2014and we solve them democratically through a combination of legal liability and consumer psychology,\u201d says Casey. \u201cProfit maximizing firms look to those incentivizing mechanisms to choose the best behavior in all kinds of contexts.\u201d In other words: Engineers will take their cues not from ethicists, but from the limits of the technology, tort law, and consumers\u2019 tolerance for risk.\n\nCasey cites Tesla as an example. Drivers of those Muskian brainchildren can switch on Autopilot and let the car drive itself down the highway. Tesla engineers could have programmed the cars to go slowly, upping safety. Or they could have programmed them to go fast, the better to get you where you need to be. Instead, they programmed the cars to follow the speed limit, minimizing Tesla's risk of liability show something go awry.\n\n\u201cDo [engineers] call in the world\u2019s greatest body of philosophers and commission some great treatise? No,\u201d says Casey. \u201cThey don\u2019t fret over all the moral and ethical externalities that could result from going significantly lower than the speed limit or significantly higher. They look to the law, the speed limit, and follow the incentives that the law is promoting.\u201d By that, he means that if policymakers and insurers decide to, say, place the liability for all crashes on the autonomous cars, the companies making them will work very hard to minimize the risk of anything going wrong.\n\nThe public has a say in this too, of course. \u201c[T]he true designers of machine morality will not be the cloistered engineering teams of tech giants like Google, Tesla, or Mercedes, but ordinary citizens,\u201d writes Casey. Lawmakers and regulators will respond to the will of the public, and if they don't, automakers will. In January, Tesla pushed an Autopilot update that lets cars zip along at up to 5 mph over the limit on some roads, after owners complained about getting passed by everyone else. The market spoke, and Tesla responded.\n\nEthics in Self-Driving Cars\n\nStill, thought exercises like the trolley problem helps gauge the public's thoughts on autonomous vehicles. \"When you\u2019re trying to understand what people value, it\u2019s helpful to eliminate all the nuance,\u201d says Noah Goodall, a transportation researcher with the Virginia Transportation Research Council who studies self-driving cars. The thought experiment can provide a broad overview of what kinds of guidelines people want for those cars, and the problems they want addressed. But it can confuse them, too, because they are the fringe case at the fringe of fringe cases. \"Trolley problems are pretty unrealistic\u2014they throw people,\" says Goodall.\n\nThe trolley problem also assumes a level of sophistication from the technology that remains quite some way down the road. At the moment, robocars cannot discern a child from a senior citizen, or a group of two people from three people\u2013which makes something like the trolley problem highly theoretical. \"Sometimes it's hard to come to a fine-grain determination of what's around [the car],\" says Karl Iagnemma, who used to head up the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Robotics Mobility Group and is now the CEO of the self-driving software startup nuTonomy. \"Typically the information that's processed by a self-driving car is reasonably coarse, so it can be hard to make these judgments off of coarse data.\"\n\nHelping people feel comfortable with autonomous vehicles requires \"being upfront about what these vehicles really do,\" Goodall says. \"They prevent a lot of crashes, a lot of deaths. Fine-tuning things are difficult, but companies should prove they put some thought into it.\" More than 35,000 people die on American roads every year; over 1.25 million people die worldwide. Worrying about the ethical dilemmas of something like the trolley problem won't save lives, but honing autonomous technology might.\n\nBut in addition to hiring more engineers, all these companies developing robocars might want to hire a few smart lawyers. Turns out they'll have a hand in the future of mobility, too.",

        "text":"Toronto\u2019s Lost Transit Dreams\n\nGenerations of plans and projects have disappeared down political black holes. (Illustration by Eric McMillan)\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you want to buy a car.\n\nAs city council debates whether to put Light Rail Transit on Sheppard Avenue or extend the current subway line, and Queen\u2019s Park ponders when council will make up its mind, Torontonians have been left wondering when \u2014 or if \u2014 anything will actually get built.\n\nNow industry spokespeople are saying it\u2019s time to take the politics out of planning.\n\nSome, such as executive director of the Residential & Civil Construction Alliance of Ontario Andy Manahan, believe the political wrangling at city hall and Queen\u2019s Park has resulted in transit-building gridlock in this city.\n\n\u201cBy its very nature, transportation planning and delivery is always going to be political,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess the question is how do you take some of the politics out of the process?\u201d\n\nOne only needs to look at a long list of dubious transit projects in Toronto to see that decisions regarding transit infrastructure are not always based on sound public policy.\n\nAccording to a March 2011 TTC report, the Sheppard subway, now at the core of a seesaw debate over its extension, was expected to carry 15,400 riders per hour in one direction at its peak time. Employment around the North York Centre was supposed to catapult from 29,400 in 1986 to 93,400 in 2011.\n\nThose numbers never panned out. In 2011 the Sheppard subway line carried just 4,500 people per hour per direction, while subways are warranted at a demand of 15,000 or greater. Employment in the area grew by only 800 jobs over two decades, rather than by the projected 64,000.\n\nWildly optimistic\n\nTransit activist Steve Munro says it\u2019s very possible the numbers in the TTC\u2019s Network 2011 plan were \u201cwildly optimistic\u201d for political reasons.\n\n\u201cI can be kind and just say it was simply the enthusiasm of the day for the growth that would come in the suburbs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in retrospect \u2026 you\u2019ve got to ask whether the development projections for North York and Scarborough were just simply not credible, and were numbers that were put there more for political reasons than for planning reasons.\u201d\n\nAccording to Munro, the real reason was a little bit of political back scratching. When Mike Harris was elected premier in 1995, the Eglinton West subway line was scrapped as part of the Common Sense Revolution. Construction had already started on both the Sheppard and Eglinton subways, but Munro contends the Sheppard line was retained because it was a priority for then-North York mayor Mel Lastman.\n\n\u201cHarris wanted to kill the whole thing, but he needed Mel Lastman in his corner for amalgamation,\u201d Munro said. \u201c So there was a deal, that Mel would support amalgamation in return for Mike Harris not killing his subway, and that\u2019s how we got the Sheppard subway.\u201d\n\nThe Eglinton West line (now slated to be constructed as Light Rail Transit) was deemed a non-priority, despite consulting, environmental assessments and construction having gone ahead since 1988.\n\nMillions of dollars buried\n\nEglinton-Lawrence MPP Mike Colle was chair of the TTC from 1992 to 1994. He said he was \u201cmortified\u201d to see the project scrapped when he was elected to the legislature in 1995 as a member of the opposition Liberal party.\n\n\u201cIt was seven years of work and over $160 million worth of money all basically buried,\u201d he said. \u201cI call it (Canada\u2019s) biggest mistake in transit history.\u201d\n\nColle says that at the time, they were looking at $800 million for the entire line. Depending on whom you ask, the current estimated cost for the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown is $6 to 8 billion.\n\nHowever, the Crosstown also includes the replacement of the Scarborough Rapid Transit line and will go to Kennedy Station and connect to Scarborough Town Centre.\n\nTo some, the Scarborough Rapid Transit line is another example of politics trumping planning in Toronto. In the 1980s, the Ontario Crown-owned Urban Transportation Development Corporation wanted somewhere to showcase its Intermediate Capacity Transit System in order to sell the technology to Vancouver in time for its 1986 Expo Fair. They convinced the TTC to adopt the technology by paying a large portion of its costs.\n\n\u201cIt was a prototype the Government of Ontario wanted to export around the world and it just didn\u2019t work out very well,\u201d said Manahan.\n\nToday the technology has been deemed too expensive to replace and is being converted to Light Rail Transit, which was the technology the TTC originally wanted to use for the Scarborough line before being convinced otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe have a bad history in Toronto of provincial meddling in transit technology,\u201d Munro said. \u201cThe Scarborough RT is a particular example of it.\u201d\n\nSimilar to Eglinton West, the downtown relief line is another example of a Toronto transit project that was proposed in the 1980s and is now being revisited \u2014 more than 20 years later.\n\nSo why is it that Toronto has a pattern of coming up with grand transit projects that never see the light of day?\n\nOne issue is that no one can make up their minds what mode of transit is best for the city, says Colle.\n\n\u201cTransit projects are notorious for having differences of opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou talk to 10 transit experts, they have 20 different solutions.\u201d\n\nThat makes it difficult to come to a decision for all parties \u2014 the city, TTC, the province, and its regional transit agency Metrolinx \u2014 to agree on.\n\nAnother issue is politicians in power can change every four years, and any transit project almost certainly takes longer than that. This allows a new mayor like Rob Ford to arbitrarily cancel a project like Transit City.\n\n\u201cBecause of the four year electoral cycle, we have been whipsawed from time to time,\u201d Manahan acknowledged.\n\nA step in the right direction, he said, is to give Metrolinx more teeth, so they could mandate where provincial money goes.\n\n\u201cIf Metrolinx had control over the funding, they would have a greater level of determination over how that money was spent, and then you wouldn\u2019t get into some of those local political issues that we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201d\n\nUnder the current model, there is no clear funding formula. Queen\u2019s Park can earmark funds for transit, but it\u2019s up to city council to determine which transit projects to implement.\n\nMunro says the idea of giving Metrolinx more oversight is wishful thinking.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely idea and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some alternate universe with birds singing and flowering trees where you can create an agency with those kind of powers. The problem is, there is nothing to prevent a change of government from completely changing the mandate and the scope of work in which an agency like Metrolinx operates.\u201d\n\nLike kids with money\n\nWard 11 councillor Frances Nunziata believes the project should be totally handed over to the province.\n\n\u201cSince they\u2019re paying 100 percent of it, they should make the final decision,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said city council has demonstrated that they can\u2019t be trusted with tax dollars by deciding to build Light Rail Transit rather than the mayor\u2019s mandate of subways.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like giving money to kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell them what to spend it on, they\u2019ll spend it on anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat people want to see is something happening and they\u2019re getting very frustrated with the politics we have at city hall,\u201d she added.\n\nOne of those frustrated people is Kurt Christensen, who served as a Scarborough councillor from 1982 to 1988.\n\nHe also says Metrolinx should take over becaus, in his opinion, the TTC is more concerned about its union than about its riders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cKaren Stintz and her people, it\u2019s all about jockeying against the mayor for the next election \u2026 It\u2019s all political.\u201d\n\nHe believes the TTC should only operate the system because \u201ceverything they touch is a disaster\u201d, referencing the St. Clair right of way as an example.\n\nThe St. Clair streetcar is frequently referred to as a disaster by the mayor due to its time and budget overruns that hurt local businesses. Originally budgeted at $48 million, the project swelled to well over $100 million.\n\nBut Munro said it\u2019s not fair to blame the TTC for the failure in planning.\n\n\u201cThese days, you can basically go into any public meeting and stand in the corner and whisper the words \u201cSt. Clair\u201d and its code for all the things that are alleged to be wrong with the TTC,\u201d he said. \u201cThe actual fact is, the TTC part of the St. Clair project was built on budget. It wasn\u2019t built on time.\u201d\n\nThe project ran into complications due to municipal additions to the project such as burying hydro lines, unforeseen water work, road paving, design changes and a court injunction by a public interest group that stalled construction.\n\nTo Colle, the issue isn\u2019t the political favours or lack of coordination between various levels of government and their arms-length agencies.\n\nHe says it comes down to the dollars. \u201cThe underlying problem that nobody brings up, it\u2019s like the elephant in the room, is that we are the only country in the civilized world that doesn\u2019t have a federal government that is a full-time partner in transit.\u201d\n\nHe noted that everyone supports subways, but when asked if they\u2019ll support road tolls, congestion or parking fees to pay for them, they say no.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants transit, but they don\u2019t want to pay for it.\u2026 You\u2019ve got to remember, we\u2019re in a city where people threw away a transit plan for $60,\u201d Colle said, in reference to the vehicle registration tax.\n\nHe believes that\u2019s why Toronto has only three subway lines while Madrid, Spain, which is slightly smaller in area but about 700,000 larger in population, has 28.\n\nAnd if we really want to get transit building on track in Toronto, the former TTC chair says it\u2019s time for the federal government to get on board.\n\n\u201cThe province and city can\u2019t do it alone unless you give the right to have other funding tools and the public doesn\u2019t want that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re...

Charles Kennedy tells the story of the airline\u2019s history, its present-day operations, and its very unusual aviation tourism niche.\n\n\nJapan\u2019s colonial possessions, including Korea, were divided among the victors of World War Two, creating a U.S.-sponsored South Korea and a Soviet-sponsored, communist North Korea, whose formal name is the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nThe Korean War broke out, after five years of partition, when North Korea tried to reunify the country by military means in 1950. After three years of fighting, with major participation by the U.S. and China and the loss of over two million lives, the only result was a ceasefire at the 38th Parallel; ironically this border line had been the starting point of the war. A peace treaty has never been signed and, technically, a state of war continues to exist after more than sixty years.\n\nThe politics of this stalemate has made the DPRK one of the least visited and least understood countries in the world. Although visitor numbers are very low\u2014 about 25,000 foreign entries to the country in 2013, including 20,000 Chinese nationals\u2014North Korea nonetheless relies on its flag carrier to connect to the world, much like any other country.\n\n\nThe airline started life in 1945, as SOKAO, an acronym that translates to \u201cSoviet-North Korean Airline.\u201d SOKAO flew to the Chinese capital city of Beijing and to the Russian cities of Vladivostok and Chita, using Lisunov Li-2s and Antonov An-2s aircraft. Its services were terminated for the duration of the Korean War. After the ceasefire, the dormant entity was taken over by the Ministry of Communications and renamed UKAMPS, adding Ilyushin Il-12s and Il-14s. An additional Il-14 was given to President Kim Il Sung by Soviet leader Stalin for use as a head-of-state aircraft. Today, this aircraft, registration simply \u201c535\u201d, is preserved in a huge indoor space at the International Gift Exhibition outside Pyongyang, following a year of display on the ramp at Pyongyang in 2012.\n\nIn 1966, the airline acquired its first Antonov An-24, which was followed by two more from the factory in Kiev. These durable twin-prop workhorses remain in service today, serving remote towns in North Korea on tourist charters and government trips.\n\nIn 1969, UKAMPS expanded, to become a true long-haul carrier, with four-engine propjet Ilyushin Il-18s, which, for the first time, made service to Moscow possible. The I1-18s even served European points beyond Moscow, within the sphere of socialist countries, such as Sofia in Bulgaria, Belgrade in Yugoslavia, and East Berlin in the Democratic Republic of Germany. The furthest from base a Korean Il-18 is known to have flown is Havana, Cuba.\n\nIn 1975, the airline was renamed Chosonminhang, \u201cChoson\u201d means Korea, \u201cMinhang\u201d means \u201cAirways\u201d; in English it became known as CAAK, short for Civil Aviation Authority of Korea, in the style of China\u2019s then flag carrier CAAC. This was just in time to receive its first jetliner, a Tu-154B, opening jet service to Moscow and beyond, although the B model of the Tu-154 was not a true long hauler, having to make fuel stops in Irkutsk and Novosibirsk.\n\nThe first Ilyushin Il-62M, P-885, was delivered in 1979, opening non-stop jet service to Moscow and more frequent services to East\u00a0 Berlin and Sofia. This type became the airline\u2019s flagship for the next three decades, serving trunk routes to Moscow and Beijing; a dedicated aircraft, P-618, became the head-of-state transport.\n\nIn 1982, the airline suffered its only fatal accident when an Il-62M, registered P-889, crashed in mountainous terrain in Guinea at the end of a long flight on a government trade misi\u00f3n from Pyongyang to Conakry, the capital city of the West African nation. The cause is not publicly known, although it is assumed to be pilot error, possibly compounded by crew fatigue.\n\nIn 1984, the airline received a pair of Tupolev Tu-134s, P-813 and P-814. P-813 was the first to be delivered and was personally inspected by President Kim Il Sung upon its arrival in Pyongyang. Among the last Tu-134s to be built, they were mostly used for local trips to Vladivostok in Russia and provincial Chinese cities, such as Shenyang in Manchuria, while the Il-62Ms covered Beijing and further afield.\n\nWhile jet-capable runways in the provinces of North Korea exist, there have not always been scheduled domestic flights, mostly due to the short distances involved, which made train travel a more viable option. The An-24s and Tu-134s were called upon to operate to North Korean destinations, such as Sondok, serving the industrial city of Hamhung, and Samjiyon, serving the Mount Paektu region, mostly on an ad-hoc basis.\u00a0 Recently, however, Air Koryo has published schedules for domestic flights for the first time in a long while.\n\n[tribulant_slideshow gallery_id=\u201d345\u2033]\n\n\nAnother rebrand came in 1993, when the airline was given its current name, Air Koryo, taken from the ancient Koryo dynasty that ruled the peninsula in the years 918\u20131392 AD. However, this name change was followed by the most difficult time in North Korea\u2019s history, coinciding with both the death of President Kim Il Sung, in July 1994, and the \u201cArduous March\u201d of the mid-to late-90s. Famine and hardship were caused by the disappearance of the economic constellation of socialist nations that followed the demise of the Soviet Union and of its European satellites. This hardship was exacerbated by serious flooding in the North Korean countryside, which destroyed crops essential for the survival of the population.\n\nWith the dawning of the new century, the situation in North Korea gradually began to improve and orders were placed for a pair of new modern aircraft, Tupolev Tu-204s, to replace the Il- 62Ms in frontline service. One was a standard -100 and the other a rare short body -300 \u201cSP\u201d. The Tu-204-300 is unusual because, while all -300s (eleven were built) are six meters (19 ft.) shorter\u00a0 than the -100 baseline to extend range and performance, this particular one (and one other) were modified from the -100 in a major surgical operation, removing two barrels from the fuselage and resetting the hours on the airframe to zero.\n\nIn 2013, Air Koryo received an An-148- 100 from Antonov, once a Soviet design bureau and, since 1991, a stand-alone airframe manufacturer in post-USSR independent Ukraine. The An-148 is a regional jet with a striking resemblance to the British Aerospace BAe 146, but with two Ivchenko Progress D-436 engines instead of the 146\u2019s four Lycomings. At one point, it was announced that Air Koryo had ordered two more, one An-148 and one stretched An-158, but those orders were cancelled and the aircraft not taken up.\n\nAround the same time, in 2013, Air Koryo stopped operating \u201cold\u201d Russian hardware (the Il-62Ms, Tu-134s and Tu- 154Bs) on passenger service to foreign civilian airports. Since then, the pair of Tu-204s and the An-148 have operated all international passenger flights. The fleet that has been relegated to domestic and charter service has a new waving flag on the tail, while the international fleet retains the more sober \u201cstraight\u201d representation of the flag.\n\nJanuary\u00a02015Add to cart\u00a0|\u00a0View Details\n\nIn recent years, Air Koryo has opened scheduled routes to Asian ports such as Bangkok and Macau, but without lasting success, so these services have been discontinued. One destination that is showing staying power is the twice- weekly rotation to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur for trade and tourism. The other long haul service out of Pyongyang is to Kuwait, with a technical stop in Pakistan, supplying labor to Kuwaiti construction projects.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that airline rating website Skytrax reserves a one (out of five) star rating for Air Koryo alone. In fact, service is always gracious, soft-spoken and kind, with a hot meal, usually a hamburger, and drinks served on all international sectors; imagine that in the West. Air Koryo\u2019s poor rating does not represent the passenger experience at all, but is because some Skytrax checkboxes remain unfulfilled; for instance, the airline does not have a website.\n\nNonetheless, air travel is at a low level in North Korea. The sum of the airline\u2019s scheduled operations is a near-daily service to Beijing, a couple of flights a week to Shenyang and Vladivostok, plus Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait. The only foreign carrier at Pyongyang is Air China, calling a couple of times a week with Boeing 737 service from Beijing. This adds up to only a couple of flights a day in total. For periods of the day, the passenger terminal is unattended, a fascinating contrast to airports serving other Asian capitals.\n\nThe original terminal, which had stood since the 1960s, was taken down piece by piece in 2012, to be replaced by a temporary terminal, while a new, permanent facility is being built. This is now almost complete and due for a November 2014 opening. Its appearance is that of an impressive and modern glass-fronted complex that will use jetways for the first time.\n\n[tribulant_slideshow gallery_id=\u201d346\u2033]\n\n\nAt odds with North Korea\u2019s media image of an unwelcoming and officious country, Air Koryo has thrown its doors open to aviation enthusiasts since 2012. Juche Travel Services is a tour operator with offices in London and Beijing, run by a Brit who was sufficiently aviationliterate to know that Air Koryo\u2019s lineup of old Russian jets, which he had seen when passing through Pyongyang airport, would be of interest to aviation enthusiasts. After months of planning, the first tour went on sale for May 2012. The line-up of types was so mouthwaterin... (truncated)",

        "text":"An Education At 18,000 Feet\n\nAviation Educator Kent Lupton Learns a Thing Or Two Outside the Plane\n\ntandem skydiving\n\nKent Lupton loves the sky. He shares that love in a pretty unique way, too: He has been teaching the next generation of aviation enthusiasts at the Carolinas Aviation Museum for years. Suffice it to say, he has flown in quite a few airplanes. He knows the history. He knows the science.\n\nKent had never, however, cranked open the door of one of those airplanes at high altitude and seen it zoom off without him. Never, that is, last week.\n\n\u201cThere will be plenty of opportunities to talk about it to my classes. It\u2019s a very cool perspective on aviation,\u201d he grinned. \u201cJust another perk of the job!\u201d\n\nThat job, as it turns out, is very cool. Founded in 1992 and located just alongside Charlotte Douglas International Airport, the Carolinas Aviation Museum is home to aircraft and artifacts from the advent of aviation (including the award-winning \u201cMiracle on the Hudson\u201d exhibition, featuring the famed passenger jet that crash-landed safely in New York\u2019s Hudson River in 2009.) The museum\u2019s mission is to \u201chighlight stories of innovation, hope and heroism throughout the history of aviation and to \u201cinspire visitors of all ages to pursue their own dreams and goals.\u201d\n\nKent\u2019s story--all the way up until his triumphant jump--is a great example of real-world dream-pursuit and goal-setting. Ending up in the aviation field was something of a career surprise (he holds a degree in environmental science), but it turns out that education is what Kent loves, so his work as an educator is a great fit.\n\n\u201cWe work with a lot of school groups,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut we also focus on daily programs and stuff we can add to the visitor experience to make it more exciting and more interactive.\u201d\n\nOne of the newest additions to the Museum offerings was a flight simulator, complete with two pilot seats, a yoke and pedals. The kids love it--but that\u2019s not all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some hard-core, real pilots come in,\u201d he said, \u201cWho get quite a surprise because the controls are different to what they\u2019re used to. They find getting the plane off the ground easy; then, when they go to land, it\u2019s a whole new ballgame.\u201d\n\nGetting out of a real plane in real flight is another \u201cwhole new ballgame,\u201d and Kent recognized that right away. He\u2019d been in plenty of small planes before, sure--but the open door tends to change things on an elemental level.\n\nKent had a bit of a casual briefing from a long-time skydiver who volunteers at the Museum, but he was hardly prepared for the surprise he was about to receive when he arrived at Piedmont Skydiving: his tandem was manifested for the dropzone\u2019s first 18,000-foot skydive (the highest in the Carolinas!). Not only was Kent going to go for a truly epic skydive--the kind of skydive you need supplemental oxygen to perform--he was going to be one of the first people in the Carolinas to do so.\n\n\u201cNone of that surprised me,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I knew, working in aviation education, about being on unpressurized planes at high altitudes--going through the mountains, for instance. When you get to a certain height, you\u2019ve got to have oxygen.\u201d\n\nRight about then, it was time for the kind of first-hand, experiential education that the Carolinas Aviation Museum strives to give its guests: Except this wasn\u2019t going to be a gentle walk through a hangar. This was going to be a 120-mile-an-hour classroom, kicked off by a climb up to the Earth\u2019s mesosphere.\n\n\u201cThey kept asking me if I had questions,\u201d Kent laughs. \u201cUncharacteristically for me, I went with the idea that, if I asked questions, it might take my mind a little further than I wanted to go. But [the Piedmont Skydiving skydiving instructors] helped a lot just by being incredibly professional and calm. For them, jumping like this is an everyday occurrence, just like teaching at the Museum is for me. I get it. They made me sure that there was nothing, really, to be worried about. I knew I was going to enjoy the experience.\u201d\n\nEnjoy it, he did. Butterflies and all.\n\n\u201cI actually felt a little bit more comfortable than on a normal commercial plane,\u201d he mused. \u201cWhich is good, because I was so excited that it felt like it took forever to get to 10,000 feet. After everyone else jumped, the climb felt like it was on fast-forward, and boom, we were there.\n\nFor someone who had never been in the open door of an airplane before in his life, Kent was remarkably calm--collecting data, no doubt, for his students.\n\n\u201cI was just absorbed into the experience and the fact it was happening,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI loved the freefall part of it. When we were freefalling, I got really into it. I didn\u2019t really think about the fact that we were shooting towards the ground at 120 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nWhen you ask Kent if his landmark skydive is going to inform his teaching going forward, he gives an enthusiastic \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many small-plane pilots who visit the Museum,\u201d Kent explains, \u201cBut not all of them go up to super-high altitudes, so it\u2019s interesting to engage with them about the procedures you use when you\u2019re not in a pressurized plane and you have to be on supplemental oxygen; when you need it, and how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\n\u201cSkydiving is something that I would definitely encourage others to do,\u201d he enthused. \u201cGo for that experience! Word got around in the museum about [my jump], so I ended up talking to a lot of our volunteers about what it was like and how cool it was. I describe it as a rollercoaster ride that has no restraints. It is just free, and open, and you\u2019re going with it. I\u2019m looking forward to my next one, for sure.\u201d\n\nSomething I wanted to do for myself and my kids for our birthdays. \u00a0Went with a group of eight (all family) and honestly could not have had a better time. \u00a0The facility was nice, and the people were honestly fantastic. \u00a0Made the entire experience that much better. \u00a0Sincerely appreciate the attention to fun and safety from all of the instructors, and absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a unique thrill. the money for the pictures and videos. \u00a0It's worth it...but hold the camera yourself. \u00a0Makes for interesting viewing later on.\n\n\u00bb Randy Clark",

        "text":"Let\u2019s learn from the Skagit River Bridge replacement | Don Brunell\n\nThe news these days is filled with stories about Big Bertha, the stalled Seattle waterfront drilling machine, and the cracks in the pontoons of the new SR 520 floating bridge across Lake Washington.\n\nThe news these days is filled with stories about Big Bertha, the stalled Seattle waterfront drilling machine, and the cracks in the pontoons of the new SR 520 floating bridge across Lake Washington.\n\nYou might wonder if Washington\u2019s Department of Transportation (DOT) is doing anything right.\n\nThey are.\n\nFor example, the replacement of the collapsed I-5 bridge across the Skagit River between Mount Vernon and Burlington is an example of how DOT engineers and private contractors can move quickly to design and complete a major transportation project with minimal traffic disruption.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened.\n\nOn May 23, 2013, just after the evening rush hour, a semi-truck carrying an oversized load of oil drilling equipment slammed into the supports of the 58-year old bridge. About a third of the four-lane bridge plunged into the river. Two vehicles fell into the water, but the three people in those cars were rescued by boaters. Miraculously no one was seriously injured.\n\nState transportation officials went to work almost immediately.\n\nTraffic engineers worked through the night on detour routes through the streets of Burlington and Mount Vernon for the 71,000 vehicles that use the bridge daily.\u00a0 Within 24 hours, a contractor was hired under an emergency contract to remove the collapsed span, and began working with WSDOT engineers to install a temporary span to get the interstate back open. The temporary span was up and operating by June 19.\n\nOn June 18, the state awarded a $6.87 million contract to Max J. Kuney Construction of Spokane, one of our state\u2019s oldest and most respected contractors, to design and build a permanent replacement span. The design was completed on July 9 and construction began three days later.\u00a0 The replacement bridge was built alongside the temporary span without interrupting traffic, and moved into place during an overnight closure on Sept. 14\u201315, 2013.\n\nThe Skagit River bridge replacement is an example of how things can get done quickly and effectively.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, this was an emergency and we cannot expect that breakneck pace on a regular basis.\u00a0 But surely there is something we can learn from this extraordinarily successful project \u2013 something lawmakers and elected officials can use to reduce the protracted delays that cost motorists and taxpayers billions.\n\nTraditionally, major transportation projects in Washington seem like a bureaucratic blood sport.\u00a0 They spark months or years of criticism, accusations, public hearings and debate from all sides. We call that \u201cinput.\u201d On occasion, people who don\u2019t get their way file lawsuits, causing further delays. That\u2019s followed by months or years more of design and permit review.\u00a0 We call that \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\nThere must be a better way.\u00a0 Of course, public input is important, but there comes a time when we have to stop talking and get moving.\u00a0 Endless \u201cprocess\u201d needlessly runs up the costs of these projects, and hinders transportation improvements that bring environmental and economic benefits.\n\nLawmakers, state transportation officials and private contractors should come together to analyze what made the replacement of the Skagit Ridge Bridge such a resounding success.\u00a0 Then they should identify ways to translate that success to everyday transportation projects around the state \u2013 whether by streamlining permits, utilizing the faster \u201cdesign and build\u201d construction process, or expediting regulatory reviews.\n\nThe Skagit River Bridge project was a stunning success.\u00a0 Let\u2019s learn from it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s make it possible to have successes like that every day of the week.\n\nDon C.

But that is more of a wakeup call than many of the non-technical media really understands.\n\nFrankly, I have to slap Tesla on the wrist for that one. Yes, the driver was an idiot by thinking that self-driving cars have arrived, but Tesla should have known better. They should not allow fully hands-off driving.\n\nThe cars may be closing in on full autonomy, but the infrastructure that has to support that is not in place. Hands-off parking is one thing. Flying down the highway at 75 mph, while watching a movie (or sleeping through one) is just plain stupid. Without being integrated into the transportation infrastructure, it is suicide. And people who push the envelope are going to find that out. This will not be the only such incident if the edge isn\u2019t rolled back a bit.\n\nThere is not going to be a fully functional self-driving ecosystem until the transportation arterials are plugged in. Translated, that means a ubiquitous smart transportation infrastructure, of which the wireless (and non-wireless) components are still a long way away from being in place. Autonomous cars will require something called \u201cdeep learning.\u201d Deep learning is an artificial intelligence that uses neural networks, which are able to \u201clearn as they go.\u201d In technical terms, that simply means it is able to analyze inputs and use them to collectively \u201clearn\u201d about the environment.\n\nFor example, when the vehicle car approaches an intersection, the software receives inputs of the situation (how many cars are present and what direction are they headed, what is the stop sign or light situation, if applicable, etc.) and then make decisions that are best suited from the information. If the decision made turns out to be incorrect, then the logic is updated to make it work better for almost every possible situation. As the logic improves, so does the intelligence. Eventually, you have millions of ways to process information through the network.\n\nHowever, that puts tremendous stress on vehicle-only AI. If the intersection and streets are smart, the input from that segment, coupled with the inputs from vehicle sensors, presents a much more complete set of inputs \u2013 to where true hands-off capabilities can be assumed.\n\nAnd that will also be critical for the \u201cintuitive\u201d type of decisions such as if the self-driving AI can \u2014 in a situation that places multiple vectors in harm\u2019s way \u2014 either direct the vehicle to hit the people in the crosswalk \u2014 or run the car over a cliff killing the passenger(s) in the car. We aren\u2019t even close to that yet.\n\nTherefore, Tesla is making a grave mistake allowing the vehicle to run, completely hands-off in scenarios that are related to life and death \u2013 such as hands-off highway driving.\n\nI am all in for autonomous vehicles. But not until all of the ecosystem components are in place.",

Designed to take on and effectively whoop M and AMG cars, Audi has never let us down when it has come to doing what's necessary to accomplish such feats.\n\nEurp_0909_01+2001_audi_s4_avant+front_left Photo 2\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 2001 Audi S4 Avant - Avant Guard\n\nActually, that's not entirely true, at least not for North American enthusiasts. Because Audi did let us down, big time, by keeping the original Audi RS - the Porsche-partnered RS2, as well as the even more impressive follow up, the B5 RS4 - out of the hands of US enthusiasts. And although we've since been blessed with the more recent Audi RS4, other versions have again gone missing.\n\nBesides their outrageous performance and stealthy good looks, truly one of the coolest features of the first two RS cars was that each was only offered in Avant form. That's right, if you wanted Audi's highest performing vehicle you were going to be driving a station wagon. Talk about the perfect all-around vehicle!\n\nMissing out on the RS2 and B5 RS4 bummed-out many Audi enthusiasts - some more than others. Denver's Adam McCarty is one of the others. Adam was bummed-out enough that he thumbed his nose at AoA and set forth to build his own B5 RS4. Though he's certainly not the first nut-job to do it, Adam's RS4 clone is as comprehensively built as any we've seen. Although the 380hp RS4 was no slouch in stock form, Adam has taken his vision of the RS4 even farther - some 75% farther.\n\nFrom the pearl white paint to the bulging OE fender flares, to the impossibly wide BBS CH wheels, this '01.5 S4-turned-RS4 is truly stunning. If Adam had never opened the hood or touched the interior, this would still be a car you'd love to have in your driveway. There's an emotional appeal to the RS4's lines and, as already mentioned, the fact it's a wagon factors into the equation.\n\nEurp_0909_02+2001_audi_s4_avant+left_rear Photo 3\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 2001 Audi S4 Avant - Avant Guard\n\nLest anybody thinks converting a US-spec B5 S4 Avant to full RS4 spec is easy, keep in mind this particular project is six years in the making and, according to Adam, \"It all began as a simple build, but obviously I don't know when enough is enough.\" True enough. In fact, he tells us there's still more to do\n\nOne specific problem faced by Adam and his tuners-of-choice, Autosport Werks and European Performance Labs (EPL), was how to get big horsepower from the twin-turbo 2.7 V6 while breathing the thin air at 5000ft above sea level. \"Lots of trial and error with different turbo set-ups drove us crazy,\" said Adam, \"but in the end, TiAL's 750 turbo kit and EPL's tuning did the trick.\" Yes, and quite the trick it is, too, with a Dyno Dynamics verified 528hp at all-four wheels. Keep in mind, this dyno is notorious for providing pessimistic numbers, and even factoring a conservative 15% drivetrain loss, we're still talking over 600hp at the crank.\n\nThere's more to building a 600-horse 2.7TT than slapping on bigger turbos, and Adam took a comprehensive approach to achieving his goals. Bigger is often better, so toward that end he upped the displacement to a full 3.0 liters by way of forged 82.5mm pistons and Pauter rods. The entire assembly was balanced, blueprinted and O-ringed to ensure everything stayed bolted together under multiple atmospheres of pressure.\n\nOther notable players included a pair of ported and polished 2.8 heads, dual Apikol intercoolers, a sensible Aquamist water\/meth injection system, and a custom Autosport Werks exhaust system employing sizeable 3\" downpipes.\n\nA Stasis-built transmission and Dahlb\u00e4ck Racing clutch ensure the power makes it to the venerable quattro AWD system.\n\nHelping the quattro system effectively put 600hp to the ground is a set of 265\/30-19 Toyo T1R tires wrapped around the aforementioned 19x10\" BBS CH wheels.\n\nMaking the CHs extra special is the fact Adam began with offsets designed for the BMW M3, having the wheels re-drilled to work with his Audi's 5x112 bolt pattern. Why go to such lengths when \"proper\" Audi applications are available? Spend a few moments drooling over the deeply recessed centers and contoured spokes of the RWD rims and get back to us.\n\nEurp_0909_13+2001_audi_s4_avant+bbs_ch_wheels Photo 7\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 2001 Audi S4 Avant - Avant Guard\n\nHigh-quality Ohlins motorsport suspension and StopTech big brake kits round out most of the handling upgrades.\n\nThe S4 came from the factory with narrow fenders and Santorin blue paint. SVE Autobody had the task of adding the metal RS4 fenders and applying the tricky pearl white paint. Despite the high degree of difficulty, SVE should be congratulated for their impressive work.\n\nSince we've mentioned this is a comprehensive build, you wouldn't expect the S4's interior to have been neglected. Anybody who's spent time in a factory B5 RS4 knows there's little to nothing that needs to be done in the way of improvements, and Adam obviously agreed. \"When it came to modding the interior, I didn't want to stray far from the OEM theme,\" he said. \"So all I wanted were the OE RS4 seats, steering wheel and carbon fiber trim.\" He's also added black alcantara inserts to the seats for good measure, but the effect is OEM and sensational. There's no shortage of custom ICE scattered about, but none of it detracts from the subtle factory theme Adam chose.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that looks out of place in the car is the aluminum canister mounted in the trunk. At first, we thought it looked like an old hooch still, and our guess wasn't a million miles off because the custom-made reservoir contains the methanol for the Aquamist system.\n\nEurp_0909_06+2001_audi_s4_avant+custom_aquamist Photo 8\/10 \u00a0 | \u00a0 Custom-built aluminum reservoir in trunk distills methanol mixture for the Aquamist water\/meth injection system\n\nSo Adam got his RS4. He followed the \"if you want something bad enough you have to build it yourself\" clich\u00e9, but it's taken a lot of work, money and time to achieve. Upon deep reflection, is he happy he went that route?

I started to queue on the B1050 to enter Willingham near the Earith Bridge.\n\nIt has become an almost-daily occurrence that an incident on the A14 not only gridlocks the main road but also causes major congestion on all the minor roads that feed onto the A14.\n\nEver since the A604 was upgraded and renamed the A14, the stretch of road between Huntingdon and Bar Hill has been a problem. Successive Roads Ministers have come to look at the problem and have gone away promising to commission 'a study' into the problem. Has anybody seen a report?\n\nTwo things have happened, though. First, the Government set up the Highways Agency traffic officers, heralding them as the 'jam-busters', though they might as well have called them the 'jam-makers'.\n\nOn that Wednesday, they shut the road. Cars and lorries poured onto minor roads, with their drivers not having a clue were to go. If a road is closed, clear signs should be put up to direct traffic around the incident.\n\nSecondly, I think the Government thought that a cheap option would be a rapid transit system to get commuters from Huntingdon and St Ives into Cambridge. All hail the guided busway. What a disaster.\n\nWith the cost of setting up the Highways Agency traffic management and the final cost of the misguided bus, the money would have built the new road that will still be needed in the future.\n\nIf the council can fine BAM Nuttall \u00a314,000 a day for not delivering the completed busway, then perhaps the Government should be fined \u00a314,000 an hour for every hour the A14 is closed. We should have the money in no time.\n\nPerhaps Cambridge Services should be renamed Liberation Services Square, and we could hold rallies there, fighting the Government forces who oppose the upgrade of the A14.\n\nDon't be silly, were British: we will just shrug our shoulders and mustn't grumble.\n\n\nStation Road",
