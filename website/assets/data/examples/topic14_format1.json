Thee were a new option for retires who liked the concept of being able to \u201cown an apartment\u201d. After the condo boom in Florida was successful, developments made their way up the east coast and throughout the country. Today, if you take a ride around any town you will see a number of condos for sale in CT that have been built in varying styles, sizes, price points and demographics.\n\nIt\u2019s a way of life that allows for home ownership with shared or common areas of the property for all residents to enjoy. You are able to get more for your money than if you had purchased on your own. Amenities such as swimming pools, club houses, tennis courts etc are now available at a price point that makes them a reality. You also don\u2019t have to worry about exterior maintenance, such as snow removal, cutting grass and raking leaves because you pay a shared monthly payment to have those professionally taken care of. It\u2019s a great way of life, it\u2019s CONDO LIFE!\n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone though. It\u2019s a great decision if you are able to live in a community where your neighbors are also your business partners, for what could be the largest investment of your life, your home. If you don\u2019t play well with others, it might not be for you.\n\n\u00a0Keep Reading!\n\n35 Reasons Moving to Connecticut is an AWESOME Idea!\n\nTo start, I figured I would let you know that I am someone who has lived in Connecticut most of my life and I am proud of my home state. I have also lived in a few other places such as Texas, North Carolina (and a couple places I\u2019d rather not go back to in the Middle East) while I was in the Air Force. After my enlistment ended, I\u00a0decided that moving to Connecticut was best for me\u00a0because I felt that this was where I wanted to call home again.\n\nNow that I have a family of my own, I understand that it\u2019s important to live in a state that I\u00a0feel will be the best choice for their long term success. I could move to any state I want, but I choose to live in Connecticut because I really do feel that this is a great place to raise a family. After all, geographically we are located directly in between two major cities, Boston and New York, with excellent transportation options close by such as highways, railroads and multiple international airports. In addition, each Connecticut town and city is uniquely charming with highly desirable classic New England characteristics. Also, being a coastal state we have excellent beaches and direct waterfront property for residences, personal enjoyment and commercial operations.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m perfectly aware that Connecticut has it\u2019s share of challenges that it is facing right now. However, it\u2019s impossible to ignore all the positive qualities that we have available to us as residents of CT. I decided to write the article because of all the attention lately is focused on the negative aspects of living here and all the positive is constantly being overlooked. Connecticut can and will become highly desirable and sought after again and now is a great time to live here because home affordability is at it\u2019s best level in a long time. Below are the 35 reasons that I feel make moving to Connecticut and living in Connecticut an AWESOME idea!\n\n\u00a0Keep Reading!\n\nFair Market Value, Appraised Value, Assessed Value and Replacement Value: What is My House Worth??!?\n\nAs a real estate agent in Connecticut, I am intimately involved with home values as a part of my every day activities.

As a Realtor, whenever I meet with people who are starting the process of selling their home they are often surprised when I tell them we should have your house sold in 2 weeks or a maximum of 30 days, if done correctly.\n\nUnfortunately, many home sellers fall into common traps for delaying the sale of their home and below I\u2019ll explain the Top\u00a0Tips for Selling Your House in 30 Days Or Less.\n\n\nTop 10 Most Expensive Homes For Sale In South Windsor\n\nReal Estate in South Windsor Connecticut is very sought after for people who are looking for a town that features great schools, shopping, entertainment and a convenient location.\n\nBut what makes South Windsor unique?\n\nIf you were to ask a politician they would say \u201cthe people, the great people of South Windsor\u201d.

When selling your home the rule of thumb is to go neutral to attract the most amount of buyers. However, if you are a home buyer and recently closed on your new home in Connecticut, you can go all out and paint with any colors you desire. Some decide to go with their favorite sports team or a really bright or bold color. The trend today is also to do an accent wall to make a statement.\n\nBut what is the correct color and how do you choose one correctly? Home Depot tackled this challenge with the release of the Home Depot\u2019s Project Color app for both your iPhone or Android device.\n\nThis app was designed to tackle the challenge of ensuring that you are confident in your paint color decision by allowing you to take a photo of a room or choose a\u00a0\u201clive view\u201d and digitally paint the room with any of the 1000\u2019s of available paint and stain colors. Check out the commercial below to see how Home Depot is marketing the app.\n\n\nCan Saint Joseph\u2019s Statue Sell Your House Fast?\n\nAre you looking for a little extra help selling your Connecticut house? There is a way that seems to work for many realtors and home owners alike. It is as simple as planting a Saint Joseph\u2019s Statue for luck in your real estate efforts. According to a New York report, an increasing number of people is seeking the help of \u2018Patron Saint of Real Estate\u2019 in the hopes that it will help solve their selling woes issues.\n\nJoseph may have been a carpenter, but apparently he can turn around the situation and help you sell your house if you have a little faith. And you need not be a Catholic for this to work. The legend of b... (truncated)",

Well, here\u2019s a few fast facts to get others just as excited about this as we are.\n\n  1. Skate World is Now Self Storage World\n\nThat\u2019s right! We\u2019ve converted the old Hillsboro, Oregon Skate World into a whopping two-story, indoor self storage facility that boasts a ton of new features. We took an aging building and made it beautiful again \u2013 upcycling at its best!\n\n  1. The World Will Be Watching\n\nOk, so maybe not \u201cthe world\u201d \u2013 but the self storage world will be, using our state of the art camera monitoring system designed to keep you and the items you store here safe from crime.\n\n  1. Pick a Number Between 1 and 380\n\nOne of those numbers is going to be your new storage unit \u2013 and you\u2019ll be the FIRST in! Yep, we have a whopping 380 units for you to choose from, but there\u2019s more. Depending on your needs, you can pick indoor storage or parking, a small unit or a large one \u2013 it\u2019s all up to you!\n\n  1. We\u2019re Both Steaming Hot and Cool as a Cucumber\n\nHow can we be both, you ask? Because at our Hillsboro, OR location we offer climate controlled self storage that keeps your items at room temperature all year round. We turn up the heat when the outside temperature gets cold, and crank it low when the summer sun kicks it up.\n\n  1. Meet a New Local Rock Star\n\nOur facility\u2019s manager will be there each day during regular business hours, and they are going to be famous for their service. Helping you through the rental process, monitoring the security cameras, keeping up with the paperwork, and more \u2013 all with a friendly smile.\n\nWe know all of this exciting news can be overwhelming, so take a couple deep breaths. Because at Northwest, we bet that if you stop by to see us about a self storage facility, we\u2019ll be sure to get your heart racing and your adrenaline glands pumping at the thought of storing your things at such a top of the line facility.\n\nbaby socks on top of crib\n\nHow to Create a Nursery That Will Grow With Your Baby\n\nFor the past few years, Eugene, Oregon home prices have been on the rise \u2014 and it\u2019s only expected to increase with time. Knowing this, new parents are looking to make their current living situation work no matter what, even with a lack of space and self storage. Northwest is all too familiar with this situation, and has come up with a few tricks to help parents create a place for their child that will grow with them throughout the years.\n\nMap it Out\n\nPlanning out the new nursery before you get started is important, but equally important is mapping out what the room is capable of holding beyond just the crib years. Will it accommodate a growing child, and what do you need to do to ensure it can? Whatever changes you make need to work for a child and a teenager, as well.\n\n\nWhen deciding on paint colors and themes for the room, think ahead. Chances are, the child will quickly grow out of pastel colors and bubbly baby animal designs. Instead, opt for more mature, neutral color palettes that are still youthful and calming. Don\u2019t negate the power of white walls, either. They provide a blank canvas for making simple changes to d\u00e9cor and adding any pop of color your child prefers as he grows.\n\nIf you want to include cute designs, look into easily removable vinyl wall decals. The options are endless, and when it\u2019s time to change it up, just peel them off and start over.\n\n\nConvertible cribs are a great solution for growing into. While they work great for your newborn, they quickly transform to provide the perfect place for your young child to snuggle up. The initial cost can be high, but remember that you\u2019ll be keeping this for a long time to come.\n\nSpeaking of that, opting for durable furniture that doubles as self storage and can be updated with paint or vinyl decals, is a sure way to keep your overall costs down. Buying a good dresser now means that it doesn\u2019t break down over the years. And that dresser can act as a changing table, too! Just purchase a removable changing table top and when the time comes to put it away, you\u2019re not getting rid of an entire piece of furniture.\n\nFollow the Rule of the Price Tag\n\nThere\u2019s a simple rule to follow when designing your nursery: The cheaper the item, the more age-appropriate it can be. Things like pillows, wall d\u00e9cor, blankets and table lamps are usually inexpensive enough to continually change. For the more expensive items, make sure they\u2019re able to grow with the child. Opt for more age-neutral colors and styles \u2013 and stay away from \u201ctrendy\u201d touches.\n\nSmart Storage\n\nSelf storage is a major issue for a lot of parents. Babies may be small, but they come with a lot of stuff. Consider outside-the-box self storage areas, like walls, closet hangers, doors and window sills. When you look into rocking chairs to add to the nursery, consider getting a storage ottoman that gives you a place to put up your feet, and put away your things.\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful to think ahead. Remember to choose a wide variety of storage sizes that can accommodate different-sized items. When the room fills up and it\u2019s time to make some space, storage facilities offer units ranging from a few feet to enough room to fit a car.\n\nBuy Ahead\n\nYour child may only be a certain age, but you might find great deals on items they will need in the future, like when it\u2019s finally time to buy their growing bodies a bed that will fit them for years to come. This is another way storage facilities near your Eugene, Oregon home can come in handy. Just store it there until it\u2019s ready to be used, and put your old furniture in until you\u2019re ready to sell it.\n\nAs you go through this amazing, scary yet wonderful time in your life, planning ahead will always work to your benefit. By creating a space your child can easily grow into, your family stays put without the stress of encroaching clutter. And you always know that when it\u2019s time to clear things out, Northwest Self Storage is right down the road \u2013 ready to help you move on to the next stage of your life.\n\nclassic cars lined up in a row\n\nTips to Fixing Up a Classic Car\n\nThe 26th annual Oregon Mountain Cruise Car Show is taking place June 12-13. If it gets you in the spirit to buy and fix up your own car, we can help! Here are some tips on how to find the perfect classic car for fixing up and how to keep it safe in Northwest storage units.\n\n5 Tips on Buying a Classic Car in Hillsboro Oregon\n\n  1. If you see rust, walk the other way.\u00a0Don\u2019t spend your money on a car with rust holes in the trunk and floors. You\u2019ll end up spending more on repairs than you would buying a nicer car. A few bubbles and rust spots aren\u2019t a big deal, just avoid buying a car lacking any hope at all.\n  1. Check the production numbers.\u00a0Always check the production numbers before buying. Look for cars that manufacturers didn\u2019t produce in mass amounts. A car with a lower production number will have a higher value, which has the potential to bring you more money if you decide to sell it in the future.\n  1. Pick a car from the 80s.\u00a0If you\u2019re looking for an investment, buy an 80s performance car like a Buick Grand National or a Camaro IROC-Z. You can even buy a Mazda RX-7 FC3S and fix it up with aftermarket parts that will make it stand out and outperform many of the cars on the road today.\n  1. Don\u2019t buy what you don\u2019t want to drive.\u00a0Just because a car is a classic doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll want to drive it. Instead, choose something that you\u2019re itching to drive. If you decide to fix it up and sell it, you\u2019ll get just as many people wanting to buy the car and drive it for themselves.\n  1. Upgrade a classic with modern features.\u00a0Buy a car from the 50s, 60s or 70s, and upgrade it with power windows, door locks and other modern features. Adding these features will not only make the car exhilarating to drive but also increase its value. Upgraded features on a car that normally wouldn\u2019t have them provide something to show off at the Oregon Mountain Cruise Car Show.\n\nStoring Your Classic Car in Hillsboro, Oregon\n\nProtect your investment by storing it at Northwest Self Storage in Hillsboro. We have storage facilities that shield your classic car from the sun\u2019s rays and rescue it from the dreaded humidity. You can also use the storage facilities to store tools, parts and other items while working on your car. After the car show, park your classic in a Northwest Self Storage unit, and have peace of mind knowing that it\u2019s safe and secure 24 hours a day.\n\nMan taking picture while woman looks at map\n\nGet Bitten by the Travel Bug\n\nMore and more people every day are saving their money, quitting their jobs and putting all their things in self storage to go travel the world. Why not you? A permanent vacation sounds like a dream come true, a life in which you have no worries and can go from place to place, meet new people and see wondrous things. Redmond, Oregon may have beautiful views and offer plenty to do, but there\u2019s a whole world out there just waiting for you to experience it.\n\nGoing On a Permanent Vacation\n\nPerhaps you dream about traveling along the Venice waterways, or maybe you just want to hit the highway and visit every major landmark in all 50 states. Before you can leave your old life behind, you\u2019ll need to save enough money to support you during your trip. If you already have that covered, here are a few storage tips to get you ready for your long-term getaway.\n\nCover the basics before traveling.\n\nGet a passport if you don\u2019t already have one, and book your plane flights ahead of time.

The animals competed in agility, obedience and working trials categories. Their owners were some of New Zealand's top canine taskmasters, who provide dog training classes for the public at the kennel club's 50 dog training clubs throughout the country.\n\nSummer dog rules now in force\n\nPress Release: Rodney District Council Summer dog rules now in force\n\nRodney District Council is reminding dog owners that summer rules for exercising dogs on a number of Rodney beaches are now in force.\n\nUntil March 19, when daylight savings finishes, dogs are not allowed on designated beaches from 9.00am to 7.00pm.\n\nDogs can be exercised on beaches before or after these times, but must be under control and any faeces removed.\n\nIn other areas including regional parks, public campgrounds, designated picnic areas, habitat sites and within 10 metres of playgrounds, dogs are prohibited at all times of year.\nRodney District Council\u2019s Animal Control and bylaws manager Wayne Knightbridge encourages pet owners to find out more about the dog rules in Rodney and exactly which beaches the daylight savings rule applies to.\n\n\u201cDog owners must be responsible for their dogs so that way we can all enjoy safe and clean beaches over summer,\u201d says Mr Knightbridge.\n\nFor more information about Rodney District\u2019s dog exercise rules, please visit or call 0800 426 5169 and request a brochure.\n\nOctober 25, 2005\n\nPeg Loague speech: National Dog Training Assembly\n\nSpeech: NZ Kennel Club Speech notes 21 October 2005\n\nSPCA and NZ Kennel Club\u2019s dog training clubs are singing out of the same hymn book\n\nI\u2019m honoured to be asked to open your National Dog Training Assembly in Taupo this weekend. This is the biggest event of the year in the NZ Kennel Club\u2019s dog sports calendar, and the biggest NDTA in over 15 years.\n\nWhile I no longer represent SPCA in any way (although I am the Administrator for the Turangi branch) I come to you tonight as an individual who\u2019s been around critters for a long time. An upbringing revolving around animal welfare and thirty six years of SPCA field experience does not get forgotten overnight. When I was part of the inaugural committee of Taupo SPCA in 1969, we used to divide each months deficit between us so the absolute minimum requirements were met and the bills paid. I\u2019m pleased to say that it was a very different situation I retired from earlier this year, although animal welfare seems to require ever increasing funding and attention.

Anything they retrieved they had to bring back right to their owner's hand or they faced instant disqualification.\n\nNo Waikato interest for hearing dog\n\nThe search continues for a deaf person in the Waikato in need of a hearing dog.\nIn July, the Waikato Times reported that a grant of $12,500 had been gifted to the Hearing Dogs for Deaf People New Zealand to train a dog for someone in the Waikato.\n\nOctober 22, 2005\n\nSausage dog gives birth to 11 wieners\n\n19 October 2005\nWendy Macpherson can't step outside these days without being hounded - dachshunded, that is.\n\nEveryone has a role to play in tackling unwanted animals\n\n\"Yesterday's neuter-a-thon at the Pakuranga Vet Clinic is an excellent\nbeginning.

It is the biggest dog sports event in the country, and the biggest NDTA in over fifteen years.\n\nMrs Loague has been \u201caround critters for a long time\u201d in her words. A founder of the Taupo SPCA 36 years ago in 1969, she has had continuous field experience since then, and she has served as National President of the RSPCA until 2000. Peg is a lay appointee on the Veterinary Council of New Zealand and works as an independent animal welfare adviser.\n\nShe told competitors tonight that \u201cThere is a world wide overpopulation of companion animals.\n\u201cOne of the things the breeders among you can do to guard against this is ensure that the animals you sell are either to be used for responsible and very discriminate breeding, or leave you as desexed pets,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOver the years it was rewarding when really happy families brought their loved canines back to the SPCA to visit and I could see how good the match was.\n\u201cInvariably I recommended puppies and young dogs be taken to dog obedience, explaining that, done properly, this helped the owner understand how best to get a cooperative, well behaved and happy dog..\n\n\u201cThe people here tonight are important in providing that training. The NZ Kennel Club includes about 50 dog training clubs from Whangarei to Invercargill. You train for competition obedience and agility, and that is why you\u2019re here this weekend. But you also offer domestic training classes where the public can enroll and learn how to train their dog. That is a valuable public good offered by NZ Kennel Club members. \u201cI admire you all for the relationship you have with your dogs,\u201d said Peg Loague\n\nOctober 20, 2005\n\nEveryone has a role to play in tackling unwanted animals\n\n\"Yesterday's neuter-a-thon at the Pakuranga Vet Clinic is an excellent\nbeginning. Now everyone involved with dogs and cats must realise we all\nhave a part to play to tackle the problem of too many unwanted animals.\n\nMastiffs come out to play\n\nMastiff dog breeds have existed for at least 5000 years, but it has only been in the past 200 years they have been bred for \"looks and beauty\" rather than as an aid to man.\n\nSummer dog rules keep beaches safe and cleanThursday\n\n20 October 2005, 10:57 am\nPress Release: Auckland City Council MEDIA RELEASE\n\n20 October 2005\nSummer dog rules keep beaches safe and clean for summer\n\nSummer rules for exercising your dog on Auckland city's beaches are now in force.\n\nThe rules, with a couple of exceptions, are that from Labour Weekend until Easter 2006, dogs are not allowed on city beaches between 9am and 7pm.\n\nWhen exercising your dog on the beach outside these hours, you must make sure that your dog is on a leash at all times and remove any faeces.\n\nSome areas are prohibited to dogs at all times of year, including:\n- the swimming area in front of the bathing sheds on St Heliers Beach\n- safe swimming areas or lanes marked out or identified by Auckland City (including the marked \"safe swimming lane\" on Kohimarama beach)\n- any area developed or marked out as a sports field (except for the spe...
