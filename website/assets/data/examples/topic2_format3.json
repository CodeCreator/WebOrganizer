        "text":"Build Your Backlog\n\nThe backlog is the collection of all customer input represented by user stories, any open defects, or defect suites. Typically, the product owner collects, manages, and prioritizes the backlog based on the importance of the request or defect. Those items at the top of the list are usually scheduled into releases and iterations to be worked on by the agile team. Once the item is scheduled into a release or iteration, it is removed from the Backlog page.\n\nIf you have CA Agile Central Portfolio Manager enabled, user stories are likely the results of portfolio items that have been groomed by product managers and PMOs.\n\nThe Backlog page lets you manage your work items with the following actions:\n\n  \u2022 Add items (quick add or add with details)\n  \u2022 Edit the existing items (in-place or full edit mode)\n  \u2022 Rank your backlog\n  \u2022 Customize your backlog appearance\n  \u2022 View the detail page of the selected item\n  \u2022 Copy a work item\n  \u2022 Delete a work item\n\nThere are several keyboard actions that facilitate your entries:\n\n  \u2022 A single click selects a row and displays the row action menu. Multiple selections are listed under the backlog_gear menu option.\n  \u2022 Click any editable field on the selected row to go to inline edit mode.\n  \u2022 Use the tab key to move from one editable field to another. Tabbing on the right-most field brings you to the first field in the next row down.\n  \u2022 Use Shift+Tab to go to the previous field.\n  \u2022 Use the Esc key to remove the row selection or cancel an inline edit.\n\nIf a parent story contains child stories, the parent story cannot be scheduled and is not displayed in the backlog page. In the case of a story hierarchy, only child stories can be scheduled.\n\nBuild your backlog consists of the following topics:\n\nThe Backlog page versus the User Story page\n\nThe Backlog page is a prioritized list of user stories, defects, and defect suites that have not yet been scheduled into a release or iteration.\nThe User Stories page is an inventory of all user stories ever created in the current project. These stories can be viewed as a flat list or as a hierarchy. Add or remove columns from your view and apply filters to create custom reports.\n\nTask Which page to use\n  \u2022 Backlog page for detailed ranking prior to scheduling work\n  \u2022 Backlog page when you want to rank user stories and defects together\n  \u2022 User Stories page when you want to rank high-level (parent) stories\n  \u2022 Create and view reports The robust custom view editor available on the User Stories page makes it easy to create and share reports\n    Manage the story hierarchy\n  \u2022 Child stories can be added on either page\n  \u2022 User Stories page to gain visibility into full story hierarchies\n  \u2022 Schedule work The backlog section of the Plan page allows you to easily schedule work into releases and iterations using drag-and-drop\n\n\n    Need more help?

        "text":"Table of Contents\n\nBefore you report a bug\n\nThe Apache Tomcat community consists of those who use Apache Tomcat, help answer questions on discussions lists, contribute documentation and patches, and those who develop and maintain the code for Apache Tomcat. Almost all those who assist on a day to day basis resolving bug reports do this for a wide variety of reasons, and almost all of them do this on their own time.\n\nMany bugs reported end up not being a bug in the Apache Tomcat code, but are due to misconfiguration, problems caused by installed applications, the operating system, etc.\n\nBefore reporting a bug please make every effort to resolve the problem yourself.\n\nIf you need help, ask on the users mailing list.\n\nThe remainder of this document points you toward resources you can use to resolve the problem you are having.\n\nBugzilla is not a support forum\n\nBugzilla is a tool to track bug reports and feature requests. It is used to organize work on Apache Tomcat projects, so that such issues are not forgotten and to document how they were resolved.\n\nBugzilla is not a place to ask questions on how to configure your own system, or how to interpret some error message or behaviour that you do not understand. If you have questions, please ask on the users mailing list.\n\nWhen you have gathered enough information to diagnose your problem, and it is indeed a bug that can be fixed in Apache Tomcat, feel free to create or reopen your Bugzilla issue for it. You can find a link to your discussion in the mailing list archives and include it in your bug report.\n\nResources to help resolve Apache Tomcat problems\n\nHere are some resources you can use to help you resolve the problem you are having before reporting a bug.\n\nProblem troubleshooting\n\n  \u2022 Documentation \u2013 Review the documentation for the version of Apache Tomcat that you are using. The problem that you are facing may already be addressed in the docs. Note, that documentation is searchable.\n  \u2022 Logs \u2013 The logs which Apache Tomcat generates can be a valuable resource when trying to diagnose a problem. Please review them. You may want to enable debug output in your Apache Tomcat configuration so that you have more information to help diagnose the problem. You may want to configure an Access Log (a valve) to log what requests reached Tomcat and what was Tomcat's response to them.\n  \u2022 Wiki \u2013 Search the Wiki. That is unofficial documentation to which everyone can contribute.\n  \u2022 FAQ's \u2013 Search the Tomcat Frequently Asked Questions that is part of the Wiki.\n\nApache Tomcat discussion lists\n\nIt is very likely you are not the first to run into a problem. Others may have already found a solution. The mailing list archives may contain discussions which will help you resolve the problem.\n\nSee the mailing lists page for the further information on the lists.\n\nSee also the Find help page.\n\nKnown issues\n\nPlease search the bug database to see if the bug you are seeing has already been reported. Please look at the changelog page for the bugs that have already been fixed. The changelogs for not-yet-released versions of Tomcat are also available. More details are below.\n\nRecent version\n\nTry to reproduce your problem with the latest released version of Apache Tomcat.\n\nLooking for known issues\n\nSearch the bug database\n\nPlease search the bug database to see if the bug you are seeing has already been reported.\n\n  \u2022 The bug may have already been fixed and is available in a later version or nightly build.\n  \u2022 Someone else may have reported the bug, you could add supporting information to help reproduce and resolve the bug.\n\nThe search page is here. There is also advanced search page.\n\nHere are some search tips.\n\n  1. Search for closed bugs as well as for the open ones.\n\n    On the advanced search page you can clear the \"Status\" field to avoid filtering by status.\n\n  2. Search across different versions of Tomcat.\n\n    In the bug database Tomcat is represented by several \"products\". The same problem should be reported only once, but the fix may be applied to different Tomcat versions. While doing so, the bug report is moved between different products. A bug that is originally reported against Tomcat 9 is moved to Tomcat 8 and maybe later to Tomcat 7. So it makes sense to search all the versions at once.\n\n    Here is a quick list of supported products:\n\n    \u2022 Tomcat 9, Tomcat 8 and Tomcat 7 \u2013 Tomcat 9.0.x, 8.5.x or 8.0.x and 7.0.x\n    \u2022 Tomcat Connectors \u2013 Integration of Tomcat with other Web servers\n    \u2022 Tomcat Native \u2013 APR based native HTTP and AJP connectors for Tomcat\n    \u2022 Tomcat Modules \u2013 Additional Tomcat components\n    \u2022 Taglibs \u2013 Apache Taglibs subproject\n  3. Search not only Summary field, but also the Comment one\n\n    On the advanced search page open \"Detailed Bug Information\", then type your query into the \"Comment\" field.\n\n  4. You can limit results to the issues that were changed recently.\n\n    On the advanced search page open \"Search by Change History\", then type \"-2m\" into the first field in the pair of \"between\" fields to limit results to the issues changed in the last 2 months.\n\n  5. Some bugs do not belong to Tomcat.\n\n    Tomcat bundles libraries from several other projects. You can see RELEASE-NOTES and NOTICE files in your distribution for details. More details are in a separate section below.\n\n\nIf you are looking for the recently fixed issues there are several places to look at.\n\n  \u2022 Changelog files for released versions\n\n    These are published on the Tomcat website.\n\n  \u2022 Changelog files for not-yet-released versions\n\n    These are available in the source code.\n\n    They are in XML format with style sheets attached. Thus modern web browsers can display them nicely.\n\n    The files are also available in nightly documentation builds. See Buildbot page for details.\n\n\nProduct Changelog (released) Changelog (unreleased)\nTomcat 9.0 (trunk) changelog.html changelog.xml\nTomcat 8.5 changelog.html changelog.xml\nTomcat 8.0 changelog.html changelog.xml\nTomcat 7.0 changelog.html changelog.xml\nTomcat Connectors changelog.html changelog.xml\nTomcat Native changelog.html changelog.xml\n\nThird party components\n\nTomcat bundles libraries from several other projects. See RELEASE-NOTES and NOTICE files in your distribution for details. The versions of the components that were used to build Tomcat are defined in the file in the source distribution.\n\nNotable components are:\n\n  \u2022 Tomcat service launcher \u2013 commons-daemon-*, tomcatN.exe, tomcatNw.exe\n\n    The service launcher is provided by Apache Commons Daemon project.\n\n    Using the terminology from that project, the *nixes launcher is called jsvc and the Windows launcher is called procrun. The tomcatN.exe and tomcatNw.exe programs in Tomcat distributions are just renamed prunsrv.exe and prunmgr.exe from Apache Commons Daemon binaries distribution.\n\n  \u2022 DBCP Database Pool implementation \u2013 tomcat-dbcp.jar.\n\n    This pool implementation is provided by Apache Commons Pool and Apache Commons DBCP projects.\n\n    The classes from these two projects are renamed into a different package, to avoid conflicts if the same libraries are used by web applications, recompiled and packed into a single JAR file.\n\n  \u2022 JDBC Database Pool implementation \u2013 tomcat-jdbc.jar.\n\n    This pool implementation is available with Tomcat 7 and later and it comes from jdbc-pool project that is part of Tomcat Modules. This library is developed alongside the main Tomcat.\n\n  \u2022 Tomcat Maven plugin subproject tracks its issues in JIRA database.\n\nReporting Apache Tomcat bugs\n\nPlease make sure the problem is a bug in Apache Tomcat and not a bug in your web application.\n\nNote, that security-related issues should not be reported through Bugzilla.\n\nHow to write a bug report\n\nPlease provide as much information as possible. It is very hard to fix a bug if the person looking into the problem cannot reproduce it. See also Bug Writing Guidelines.\n\nBug submission starts here. You have to include the following information in your bug report:\n\n  \u2022 Product. Here is a list of supported products:\n\n    \u2022 Tomcat 9 \u2013 Tomcat 9.0.x and web site\n    \u2022 Tomcat 8 \u2013 Tomcat 8.5.x and 8.0.x\n    \u2022 Tomcat 7 \u2013 Tomcat 7.0.x\n    \u2022 Tomcat Connectors \u2013 Integration of Tomcat with other Web servers. The mod_jk module for Apache HTTPD and other web servers.\n    \u2022 Tomcat Native \u2013 HTTP and AJP connectors for Tomcat using native code and linked with Apache APR and OpenSSL libraries\n    \u2022 Tomcat Modules \u2013 Additional Tomcat components, such as jdbc-pool\n    \u2022 Taglibs \u2013 Apache Taglibs subproject\n  \u2022 Version \u2013 Apache Tomcat version.\n\n    Please not only select it from the list, but also mention it in your text. The bug description can be updated, so it is important to mention the version in the text as well.\n\n  \u2022 Component \u2013 The component which has the bug.\n\n    If you do not know, just guess.\n\n  \u2022 Platform and OS \u2013 Hardware platform and operating system Tomcat is running on.\n\n  \u2022 Severity \u2013 This is normal for usual bug reports and enhancement for enhancement requests.\n\n    If you tend to mark it as critical, you are probably doing it wrong. It is likely that the issue is already known and fixed, or it is not an issue at all.\n\n  \u2022 Configuration details\n\n    Please mention these in your text:\n\n    \u2022 Java version \u2013 Vendor and version of your Java Runtime Environment used to run Tomcat.\n    \u2022 If Tomcat is used behind Apache HTTPD or other web server \u2013 its version and how it is configured.\n    \u2022 Tomcat Connector that is being used. There are several implementations of Connectors in Tomcat. Which one is being used is shown in the logs during Tomcat startup.\n  \u2022 Attachments\n\n    Attach configuration files and Tomcat log files if they would help to track down the bug.\n\n  \u2022 Reproducer\n\n    Please describe how to reproduce your problem on a clean Tomcat installation. If you can please provide a simple sample web application that demonstrates the issue.\n\nHow to submit patches and enhancement requests\n\nEnhancement requests for Tomcat are subm... (truncated)",

Help us to give you the greatest possible quality of service.\n\n\nYou want to associate your name with this initiative?

        "text":"[must read] Upgrading v5 to v6\n\nCreated on 2018\/01\/27\n\nThis is a summary of common issues that can appear during upgrade. It is a copy of original forum thread https:\/\/pyd.io\/f\/topic\/troubleshooting-upgrade-to-v6\/\n\nUpgrade to v6 troubleshooting\n\nLet\u2019s use this forum thread to summarize and discuss potential issues while upgrading First, a list of resources: - Release note: https:\/\/pyd.io\/pydio-core-6-0-0\/ - Product tour: https:\/\/pyd.io\/pydio-6-tour\/\n\nPlease post as a comments your issues, i\u2019ll reedit this thread accordingly.\n\n1\/ I don\u2019t see \u201cupgrade available\u201d in the app\n\nMake sure that your Update Engine plugin is correctly configured: if you are running 5.2.5, must be poiting to Stable channel. If you are running 5.3.4, must be pointing to dev channel.\n\n2\/ I can\u2019t upgrade because I\u2019m using APT-GET or YUM \u2013 Or I did upgrade using apt-get\/yum update, but I have a blank page\n\nDid you read https:\/\/pyd.io\/upgrade-pydio-5-2-5-to-6-0-0\/ ?\n\n2.1\/ Error : The root install path is not writeable, no file will be copied! The archive is available on your server, you can copy its manually to override the current installation.\n\nThe simplest way should be to temporarily change permissions on your Pydio install, perform upgrade from the interface, and revert them again. Basically, you can chown -R www-data (or httpd) the whole folder, do the upgrade, then revert to whatever the user was, and then again reopen the write permission on the \/data\/ folder.\n\n3\/ After upgrading from a serial-based pydio5, i cannot access my workspaces anymore\n\nYou see an error about \u201cwrong SQL setup for meta plugins\u201d. Open the file conf\/bootstrap_repositories.php and comment out the lines of the default repositories where you see \"meta.syncable\" => array(), by simply adding a double slash at the beginning \/\/ \"meta.syncable\" => array(), . This should solve the problem.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll have to change the \u201cAccess.fs\u201d plugin options. In the admin panel, in the plugins settings, look for Workspaces Drivers >> FileSystem Standard (access.fs), edit the global parameters of this plugin: remove \u201cmeta.syncable\u201d from the Default Meta Sources here. Otherwise, each time you will create a workspace with this driver, the meta.syncable will be added automatically.\n\nPlease note that you then cannot use the PydioSync with such a setup.\n\n4\/ After upgrading, I still see the old theme, and not the beautiful one as on your demo!\n\nMake sure to switch to the new ORBIT theme: under admin panel, in Features Plugins > Graphical User Interface > Client Driver, switch the theme to \u201cOrbit\u201d.\n\n4.1\/ I updated my DEB\/RPM and manually applied the DB upgrade as explained in the how-to, but I now see DB errors like \u2018Unknown column \u2018index_path\u2019 in \u2018where clause\u2019\u2019\n\nThis is because another manual update was necessary when upgrading to v5.2.0, and you probably have not applied it. And it was probably transparent because the new columns were not used unless you activated some features, which we did in v6. So please go to https:\/\/github.com\/pydio\/pydio-core\/blob\/develop\/dist\/php\/5.2.0.sql (or .sqlite) and apply this as well.\n\n5\/ Help! White Page after upgrade and no errors in logs [FIXED in 6.0.1]\n\nIf you see a blank page, and let\u2019s say that your server is installed at http:\/\/yoururl.com\/my_pydio , open the Web Developers console of your browser, and you see errors loading JS and CSS files. If you look carefully at the problematic urls, you can see that they are pointing to \/plugins\/gui.ajax\/etc\u2026 instead of \/my_pydio\/plugins\/gui.ajax etc. You probably have manually set the Server URL in your pydio core options, and the base of the application is detected as \/my_pydio instead of \/my_pydio\/ (the last slash is important).\n\nOpen the file plugins\/gui.ajax\/class.AJXP_ClientDriver.php and add the following line just after line 144:\n\n    $root = '\/'.ltrim(parse_url($configUrl, PHP_URL_PATH), '\/');\n    if(strlen($root) > 1) $root = rtrim($root, '\/').'\/';\n    \/\/ END\n\nNow reload the interface.\n\n6\/ New Shares are not working (404)\n\nNew shares now REQUIRE that you have apache mod_rewrite enabled (or equivalent for other webservers). Also, the upgrade should have modified the .htaccess located in data\/public\/, but to make sure, you can remove the file data\/public\/grid_t.png inside this folder, and create a new share. This should regenerate the htaccess file.\n\n7\/ Php big errors like \u201cParse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING \u2026\n\nMake sure to use php5.3 or higher.\n\n8\/ Various errors with ldap_control_paged_result_response() [FIXED in 6.0.1]\n\nWe introduced the usage of new PHP features to help browsing pages on an ad\/ldap server (functions added in php5.4). But it seems some php versions have problems with that. We\u2019ll add a parameter in next release, in between, you can hack the ldap plugin by forcing to ignore this feature. In plugins\/auth.ldap\/class.authLdapDriver.php, replace existing line 312: $isSupportPagedResult = function_exists(\"ldap_control_paged_result\") && function_exists(\"ldap_control_paged_result_response\"); by $isSupportPagedResult = false;\n\n9\/ Problems creating workspaces in Italian Language [FIXED in 6.0.1]\n\nThis should now be fixed in 6.0.1",

However, just because we don't want to limit our users from using our themes in conjunction with any module, we have taken great pains in ensuring that our themes and any modules that come with them, do not interfere with Drupal's core functionality. In addition our themes strictly follow the specifications for theme development according to Drupal.\n\nTherefore, as long as the module you\u2019re interested in using, does not interfere with the core architecture and functionality of Drupal, chances are it will work seamlessly with our theme and distribution. You could check the module\u2019s behaviour with any of the core themes and if everything seems fine, you can be sure that the module will have no problem working with our theme.\n\nFurthermore, as long as the module does not have special theming needs, it won\u2019t have any issues regarding the look\u2019n\u2019feel as well. Even in case it does have some special theming needs, such as i.e.: some additional designs\/icons\/images and\/or coding, we are always available for hiring, so that we do this for you, or we can consult on a basic level, free of charge, so that you can carry this out yourself.\n\nContact Us\nseconds ago\na minute ago\nminutes ago\nan hour ago\nhours ago\na day ago\ndays ago\nInvalid characters found",

        "text":"Forums\/Knowledge Base\/MySQL Galera\n\nLimitations in Galera Cluster for MySQL\n\nVinay Joosery\nposted this on July 06, 2012 11:59\n\nIn MySQL-5.5.x\/wsrep-23.x, Galera Replication has some limitations, these are documented in readme-wsrep.\n\n  1. Galera replication originally only worked with InnoDB storage engine, but it now also supports MyISAM storage engine. Any writes to other table types, including system (mysql.*) tables are not replicated. However, DDL statements are replicated in statement level, and changes to mysql.* tables will get replicated that way. So, you can safely issue: CREATE USER..., but issuing: INSERT INTO mysql.user..., will not be replicated.\n\n  2. MyISAM replication is recent and should be considered experimental. Non-deterministic functions like NOW() are not supported. The Configurator for Galera enables wsrep_replicate_myisam by default.\n\n  3. DELETE operation is unsupported on tables without primary key. Also rows in tables without primary key may appear in different order on different nodes. As a result SELECT...LIMIT... may return slightly different sets.\n\n  4. Unsupported queries:\n    * LOCK\/UNLOCK TABLES cannot be supported in multi-master setups.\n    * lock functions (GET_LOCK(), RELEASE_LOCK()... )\n\n  5. Query log cannot be directed to table. If you enable query logging, you must forward the log to a file:\n    log_output = FILE\n    Use general_log and general_log_file to choose query logging and the log file name.\n\n  6. Maximum allowed transaction size is defined by wsrep_max_ws_rows and wsrep_max_ws_size. Anything bigger (e.g. huge LOAD DATA) will be rejected.\n\n  7. Due to cluster level optimistic concurrency control, transaction issuing COMMIT may still be aborted at that stage. There can be two transactions writing to same rows and committing in separate cluster nodes, and only one of the them can successfully commit. The failing one will be aborted. For cluster level aborts, MySQL\/galera cluster gives back deadlock error.\n    code (Error: 1213 SQLSTATE: 40001\u00a0 (ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK)).\n\n  8. XA transactions can not be supported due to possible rollback on commit.",
