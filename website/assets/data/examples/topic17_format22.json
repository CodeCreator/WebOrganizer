        "text":"Three Keys to Successful Political Fundraising\n\n\nFundraising plays a very important part in getting a candidate elected into public office. Political campaigns and events are critical for raising awareness among voters, and often take large sums of money. Therefore, political fundraising is very important to a candidate\u2019s success. These 3 keys will help ensure that your candidate is well known, and that your political fundraising events are a success.\n\nKey #1: Raise Awareness\n\nPublic awareness is the first essential key to successful political fundraising. After all, people won\u2019t donate to a candidate unless they know not only \u201cwho\u201d the candidate is, but details about their background, education, beliefs, etc. So what\u2019s the best method of making people aware of your candidate and of your fundraising efforts?\n\nRaise Awareness through Technology\n\nWhen it comes to building awareness, the latest technology is your best friend. Social media and the internet allow you to reach a large number of people quickly and effectively. These methods are often less expensive than more traditional media like television or newspaper ads, so they are great for when your campaign is just starting out.\n\nStart by building pages and accounts on social media for your candidate. Find out what your target audience uses the most \u2013 it might be Facebook, Twitter, or even Instagram. Create pages and profiles on the best networks, and use these accounts as platforms to get the word out. Use social media to open dialogue with local business, voters, and others who can assist in spreading the word.\n\nSet up a custom fundraising website where people can come to learn about your candidate and why they are running for office. This is also a great place to process and receive donations from supports. A website like this is often very easy to setup, and can more than pay for itself in the long run. Offering an easy, simple, secure way for people to donate can really help your fundraising efforts \u2013 both online and offline.\n\n\nWhen it comes to successful political fundraising, microtargeting is one of the latest and greatest methods. Microtargeting is based on a technique called data mining \u2013 combing through collected personal data to extract what\u2019s useful to your campaign. The data is then used to microtarget specific people, with tailored messaging that can really help to get their attention. For example, an unemployed dock worker might receive a message about how your candidate supports the local construction industry, while a mom of 4 might receive messaging about how education or family care is important. These customized messages really help to catch people\u2019s attention, and improves the chance these people will support your campaign as your message is something that speaks to their specific values and concerns.\n\nTraditional Media\n\nWhile social media and the internet offer a lot of potential for building awareness, don\u2019t discount the effectiveness of more traditional media. TV advertising, while it can be expensive, is a great way to bring your candidate into the public eye. Billboards, leaflets, and direct mailings are other traditional methods to draw attention. Place lawn signs on highly trafficked areas and roads to get people used to seeing your candidate\u2019s name.\n\nKey #2: Host Political Fundraising Events & Get Involved Locally\n\nOnce people are aware of your candidate and your campaign, it\u2019s time to start getting involved locally and hosting events. Both of these methods are wonderful ways to build even more awareness, and will often even attract local journalists which results in more PR and free advertising.\n\nGet Involved\n\nGetting involved in local movements and events is a wonderful way to build awareness for your candidate and to potentially gain free advertising. Look for events that your candidate can attend, like a clean-up day at a local park, or the opening of a new local business. Often times, journalists and local news crews will already be at these events to cover the story, and may give your candidate the chance to be interviewed or mentioned on TV or in the newspaper. Post your candidate\u2019s schedule and which events you\u2019ll be attending online and on social media as well as your fundraising website.\n\nHost Events\n\nThere are many people who may not respond or donate because of advertising or a direct mailer, but will be happy to donate for the chance to attend a party or a dinner. Hosting major fundraising events like formal dinners is a very effective way to target high level donors and raise a large amount of funds. Send out invitations at least 4 weeks in advance, with clear instructions on attire and venue. Low, medium, and high donation levels should be available for guests to select, with what\u2019s included at each level. For example, a high level donor might attend the dinner and have access to a VIP party afterward. Allowing for these distinctions helps keep donors happy and able to contribute to a successful fundraiser. Learn more about fundraising event ideas.\n\nKey #3: Stay Connected\n\nStaying connected is the last key that is absolutely critical to your political fundraising success. Thank each and every donor promptly for their contribution. For higher level donors, a personal hand-written thank you note from your candidate can be very effective. It lets donors know that they are appreciated, and that you truly care about them and their involvement in your campaign.\n\nRemember that you will often ask for donations multiple times throughout your campaign, so make sure first-time donors feel appreciated and acknowledged. This will make re-solicitation much more effective. You may even want to call some donors out by name, especially if it\u2019s a local business or someone who\u2019s well known. Thank them with a note, as well as publicly on your website and on social media.\n\n\nGuest post provided by DoJiggy \u2013 a company that\u2019s been helping nonprofit and community organization achieve success in their fundraising efforts by utilizing affordable, easy-to-use online fundraising software solutions. \/ @DoJiggy\n\nPost to Twitter\n\nCampaign Budgeting 101 \u2013 Fundraising\n\nTrue or False:\n\nYou have to spend money to make money.\n\nFalse! \u00a0Well, sometimes it helps, but it\u2019s certainly not\u00a0mandatory, especially in the beginning. \u00a0The amount of money you set aside for fundraising purposes will largely depend on how\u00a0you plan to fundraise. \u00a0Many candidates hear about $1,000 plate dinner fundraisers and get it in their heads that this is a \u2018normal\u2019 way to fundraise. \u00a0Not at all, my friend, not at all! \u00a0Here are some typical fundraising methods real, down-to-earth, local candidates use:\n\n  \u2022 Sending a fundraising letter to friends, family and potential donors\n  \u2022 Calling people who\u2019ve donated generously to candidates in the past and asking them to contribute to you as well\n  \u2022 Asking people for money in person (specifically people who can afford to give $500+ to start with)\n  \u2022 Hosting an event and charging people to come to it\n  \u2022 Accepting donations online\nThere are about as many ways to fundraise as there are candidates running for office. \u00a0Creativity is a very useful talent in this category, because you\u2019re going to have to think up some creative ways to fundraise without spending a small fortune on a \u2018traditional\u2019 fundraiser.\n\nHere are some of the things you\u2019ll need to spend money on under the \u2018fundraising\u2019 category:\n\n  \u2022 Stationary, envelopes and thank you notes (this could be considered an administrative cost instead)\n  \u2022 Postage\n  \u2022 Event invitations\n  \u2022 Food\n  \u2022 Venue rental\n  \u2022 Transportation, in the case you have a meeting with a PAC Director considering donating\n  \u2022 Admission to GOP networking events where you intend to meet potential donors\n\nAs you can see, the real spending doesn\u2019t happen unless you decide to hold a formal event, and even in that case, there are plenty of ways to cut costs. \u00a0The goal of fundraising is to bring money in, not send it out, so remember that when you\u2019re planning your fundraisers and make sure you\u2019ll getting the most bang for your buck. However, budget yourself a realistic amount \u2013 the last thing you want to do is give yourself such a tight fundraising budget you can\u2019t actually raise any funds.\n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t tell you exactly how much to budget for fundraising \u2013 after all, a great deal of that will be determined by your fundraising goals. \u00a0I can tell you that raising $100,000 doesn\u2019t have to cost that much\u00a0more than raising $10,000. \u00a0I can not stress enough that the bulk of the money you raise will come from sitting down with donors and asking them for money.\u00a0 And it costs zero dollars to do that. \u00a0The difference between a $100,000 goal and a $10,000 goal is not how much money you spend on a fundraising event, but rather the people you ask for money and how much you ask them for.\n\nSo what are the steps to developing the Fundraising section of your budget?\n\n  1. Research potential donors through your state\u2019s online campaign finance directories and with the help of former candidates\u2019 lists.\n  2. Compile a list of potential donors, including friends and family, complete with name, address, phone number, notes on how much they\u2019ve donated in the past and what you intend to ask them for.\n  3. Compile a list of PACs that may donate to your campaign and research their requirements.\n  4. Estimate the costs of sending an initial introductory fundraising letter \u2013 include paper, printing, envelopes, postage, etc. \u00a0I recommend doing this by hand \u2013 your list will likely be somewhere between 50 and 200 addresses.\n  5. Set tentative dates for fundraisers \u2013 front load them into the schedule if possible to save room for grassroots\/GOTV efforts closer to election day.\n  6. Estimate the costs of venue rental and food based on a \u2018typical\u2019 number of attendees \u2013 you\u2019ll need to talk to former candidates and local GOP leaders to get a rough idea.\n  7. List all your potential costs and total them up. \u00a0Then start looking for ways to save m... (truncated)",

        "text":"World Day Toolkit\n\nIdeas for action on October 17th\n\nOrganise or participate in events to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty, and those who join them in efforts to tackle poverty\n\nOn the first October 17 in 1987 Joseph Wresinski revealed not only the suffering, but the courage, efforts, and aspiration of people living in extreme poverty around the world. The words engraved on the Trocadero commemorative stone are often repeated in October 17 celebrations.\n\nOctober 17th is a day when people in poverty testify to their efforts and those of others in resisting poverty and exclusion. Such testimonies and messages hold a place at the heart of gatherings on the World Day and are a valuable record of the lives and efforts of people in poverty.\n\nOctober 17 commemorations have taken many different forms throughout the world. Often events take place in the community and close to places of significance for people in poverty.\n\nOn the international level the day is growing in its reach. The international coalition Global Call Against Poverty also holds October 17th as a major day of mobilisation against poverty. For more information and ideas from their toolkit visit\n\nConcerts and cultural events\n\nPeople in poverty have often spoken only through the songs of their struggles, pains, and resistance. Thousands of choirs and choral groups around the world have taken up the challenge to organize special concerts, or to participate in World Day commemorations with a special repertoire of the songs of people in poverty. From Chad to Peru, from Luxembourg to Manila, people have garnered their artistic talents into art exhibits, theater pieces, and dance performances evoking the history of the struggle against poverty.\n\nWrite or record a testimony or message\n\nIf you have experienced (or know someone who is experiencing) the injustices of poverty and exclusion, write about it so that others can understand and join forces. These messages can be shared on the international day. Send your testimonies and messages here\n\nCommunication around the world...\n\n\"It helps to know we are not alone,\" many people in poverty have said during the events on October 17. Whether people gather by the thousands, or only a few to commemorate the World Day, they are all part of a movement that breaks the isolation of the poorest and most excluded. People have used different means to make those links real: from international radio communication between countries to simple conference calls, to exchanges of post cards, fax or e-mail.\n\nSilence and spiritual observance\n\nFor some October 17th is an important time of reflection and silence. Whether with a traditional service in a Rwandan village, meditation in a temple in Thailand, prayers in an Algerian mosque, an Israeli temple, or Notre Dame of Paris, or in interfaith gatherings, people of many faiths and traditions have commemorated the World Day in the manner of their choice.\n\nYou may wish to organise such a moment, or call on your religious leaders to encourage them to promote a time of reflection on the lives and efforts of people living in extreme poverty. You may wish to use Joseph Wresinski\u2019s Universal Prayer written for October 17, 1987.",

        "text":"ArtsAutosBooksBusinessEducationEntertainmentFamilyFashionFoodGamesGenderHealthHolidaysHomeHubPagesPersonal FinancePetsPoliticsReligionSportsTechnologyTravel\n\nHow to write a government press release\n\nUpdated on December 1, 2014\n\nRon Kluvers said that one important aspect of accountability is information. Therefore, it's vital that government offices be able to create and distribute press releases to share information about their affairs with the public. Government press releases differ from those for private companies in that they are not directly advertising something, but rather are sharing facts with the public to help build support and understanding for their actions and decisions.\n\nGovernment offices are making an effort to word the information carefully to as to shine a more positive light on the office or elected official. Typically you want to focus on positive things that have been accomplished. Even if the press release provides information about a more negative event or decision, such as layoffs or a natural disaster, you still want for your office to be proactive on the issue so as not to seem that you are avoiding a problem.\n\nAfter choosing the topic for your press release, write the content in accordance with regular press release rules:\n\n  \u2022 The language should be formal\n  \u2022 Sentences should be concise and simple;paragraphs should be no more than five sentences, and also, try to keep the length of the entire release to less than one page\n  \u2022 Consider your audience, what they are interested in, and what they understand\n  \u2022 Include the who, what, where, when, why, and how\n\nOnce the press release is completed, be sure to post it online and distribute it to your press contacts.\n\n\nSample Format\n\nLogo and name of government office\n\n\nDate of release (optional)\n\nContact information for main press contact(s)\n\n\nSUBHEAD (optional; centered)\n\nName of City (in italics) - Press Release content (font should be easy to read, like size 12, Times New Roman. Have an extra space between paragraphs)\n\nThe first sentence should summarize the news.\n\nThe next paragraph should provide some information on the issue, or if the issue is simple, then a quote from the relevant staff member or official.\n\nProvide background information on the topic, like what contributed to the decision or what happened in previous years.\n\n### (centered; marks the end of the press release text)\n\nOffice name, address, and phone number (bottom, centered)\n\n\n    0 of 8192 characters used\n    Post Comment\n\n    \u2022 dallas93444 profile image\n\n      Dallas W Thompson\u00a06 years ago from Bakersfield, CA\n\n      CYA... Put your best foot forward. Public information from the private sector may at times may be the same format, depending on the needs of the company.

I have used press releases in the past to advertise or to inform about different events I am presenting. They seem helpful and newspapers seem open to printing them--probably cuz they're short and sweet and do not appear to be advertising as such. In terms of government press releases, it is certainly a simple way for the government to release information without doctoring the information, but I doubt they fight the temptation!!\n\n\n    \u2022 De Greek profile image\n\n      De Greek\u00a06 years ago from UK\n\n      Next time I am in government, I shall think of your press release advice :-)\n\n    \u2022 glassvisage profile image\n\n      glassvisage\u00a06 years ago from Northern California\n\n      Thanks everyone!

But peace must prevail for the protests to be regarded as worth. But to many, protests must involve the creation of chaos. This is because of the belief that people that it is the only way for the grievances to be put into consideration.

Therefore, one can consider protesting on public forums such as the streets, sidewalks and even in the parks. Also, conducting protests in front of a government building g is not a problem as long as the activities carried out in the building are not blocked.

        "text":"What to Do if You're Turned Away at the Polls\n\nLast week, reports came out that because of Georgia's \"exact match\" law, 53,000 residents of the state who registered to vote have had their registration marked as \"pending,\" raising questions about whether or not those voters will be allowed to cast their ballots in this year's election. An analysis of the pending applications by The Associated Press showed that they overwhelmingly belong to African American applicants. The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia responded to the news by ensuring Georgians that the \"pending\" status does not prohibit them from voting if they have proper identification.\n\nEarly voting already has begun in Georgia, and the voter registration deadline has already passed. Since many applicants were unaware that the exact match law applied to them, many don't know that their voter registration wasn't approved. They are still legally allowed to vote.\n\nSean J. Young, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia said:\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s Office has confirmed that if your voter registration application is deemed \u2018pending\u2019 because of the exact match law, you can still cast a regular ballot IF you provide photo identification at the polls, which substantially reflects the name you used on your voter registration form. Though the ACLU of Georgia strongly opposes the discriminatory exact-match law passed by Georgia politicians, we must focus on ensuring that all registered voters come out to vote. We reiterate that all voters who have pending registration applications can still cast a regular ballot by presenting photo identification.\n\nThe placing of the registrations under pending status was carried out under the direction of Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is running for governor against Stacey Abrams, who would become the first African American\u00a0and first\u00a0woman to become Georgia's governor.\n\nDuring his time as secretary of state, Kemp has canceled more than 1.4 million voter registrations, including nearly 670,000 in 2017 alone. Kemp is far from the only Republican enforcing such laws. Since 2014, more than 16 million voters have been purged from voting rolls across the country. The systems used to purge voters often remove valid voters from the rolls, for instance, a study of a 2016 Arkansas voter purge found that thousands of voters had been falsely purged. And that doesn't even get into the validity of the laws in the first place, most of which were strenuously opposed by civil rights organizations.\n\nSo what can you do if you have been falsely targeted by one of these purges?\n\nIt depends on the state you live in, but here are steps you can take in any state to make sure you can vote in this election:\n\n  1. Check your registration now. While the voter registration deadline has passed in many states, it is still important that you double-check and make sure you are still properly registered to vote. Plus, 17 states allow for Election Day registration\u2014check here to see if your state is one of them.\n\n  1. Find your polling place before Election Day. You can be turned away if you attempt to vote at the wrong location, so make sure that you know where to go. You should also be aware of the polling place hours and make sure that you arrive before they close. Remember that if you are in line at the time the polling location is set to close, you still have the right to vote and they cannot legally turn you away. Call the nonpartisan hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE if you run into any problems.\n\n  1. Make sure you have the required voter identification with you when you vote. Different states have different standards about what identification they will accept, so make sure to check in advance. Check now, that way if you don't have the required identification, you may have time to obtain it before Election Day.\n\n  1. Vote early if that option is available. If you have been falsely removed from the rolls, you will find out sooner rather than later and can call 1-866-OUR-VOTE to connect with a voter protection volunteer who can help you figure out what to do next.\n\n  1. If you are not on the voting rolls at your precinct or are turned away, election officials are required to give you a provisional ballot. (Some states call it a \u201cchallenge ballot\u201d or an \u201caffidavit ballot.\u201d) Ask for one and request a receipt or other information about what you need to do to be sure your vote is counted.\n\n  1. If you have any problems that you can't work out, call the toll-free, nationwide, nonpartisan hotline 1-866-OUR-VOTE (1-866-687-8683) and talk to a trained volunteer for voting assistance.\n\nYou can learn more about your local laws and find other election protection news and information at",

At this crucial economic juncture, reducing funding to the CSU can only harm its mission of producing a highly skilled workforce for our state.\n\nI believe this is the wrong direction for the state to go; cuts to the CSU will only make the economy more stagnant and reduce our ability to remain competitive in our global marketplace.\n\n1) For every dollar the state invests into the CSU, $4.41 is generated in economic activity.\n2) With these cuts, many eligible students are being turned away.\n3) The CSU plays a major role in the state\u2019s workforce, graduating 90,000 students each year, including 87 percent of education graduates, 64 percent of nurses, 65 percent of business professionals, 82 percent of those involved in public administration, and more than half of the state\u2019s graduates in agriculture-related fields.\n4) Cuts to the CSU mean a loss to the economy.\n\nGiven the significant impact the CSU has on the future of California\u2019s workforce and economy, it is critical that you restore the budget cuts to the CSU. California\u2019s future depends on the CSU. I look forward to hearing your response to this matter.\n\n\nYour Name\n\nLegislative contacts for the San Jos\u00e9 region\n\nSanta Clara County Legislators\n\nCalifornia State Senate\n\nSenator Ellen Corbett (D-10)\n39155 Liberty Street, Suite F610\nFremont, CA\u00a0 94538\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0510-794-3900\nFax:\u00a0510-794-3940\n\nSenator Jerry Hill (D-13)\n160 Town and Country Village\nPalo Alto, CA 94301\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0650-688-6384\n\nSenator Jim Beall (D-15)\n100 Paseo de San Antonio, Suite 209\nSan Jose, CA 95113\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0408-286-8318\nFax: 916-319-2124\n\nSenator Bill Morning (D-17)\n701 Ocean Street, Room 318A\nSanta Cruz, CA 95060\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0831-425-0401\n\nCalifornia State Assembly\n\nAssemblymember Rich Gordon (D-24)\n5050 El Camino Real, Suite 117\nLos Altos, CA 94022\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0650-691-2121\nFax: 650-691-2120\n\nAssemblymember\u00a0Bob Wieckowski (D-25)\n39510 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite 280\nFremont, CA 94538\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0510-440-9030\nFax: 510-440-9035\n\nAssemblymember\u00a0Nora Campos (D-27)\n100 Paseo De San Antonio, Suite 319\nSan Jose, CA 95113\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0408-282-8920\nFax: 408-277-1036\n\nAssemblymember\u00a0Paul Fong (D-28)\n274 Castro Street, Suite 202\nMountain View, CA 94041\u00a0\nTel:\u00a0650-210-2000\nFax: 650-210-2005\n\nAssemblymember\u00a0Mark Stone (D-29)\nState Capitol,\u00a0P.O.

        "text":"How To Conduct A Political Argument On\u00a0Facebook\n\n11 Feb\n\nFirst, look for someone who posts a link which represents the polar opposite of your political orientation.\u00a0 So if you are a big fan of Obama, then find one from the Tea Party.\u00a0 If you are a big Fox News fan, then find one which\u00a0disparages Fox News.\u00a0 If you are a vegetarian, find one about veal parmesan.\u00a0 You get what I\u2019m saying.\n\nAbove all, do not click on the link.\u00a0 There\u2019s no need for that, you already have your political orientation, you aren\u2019t some kind of waffling flip-flopper who changes your mind at the appearance of new information.\u00a0 Just leave the link alone, and then go straight to the comment box.\n\nThere, drop approximately\u00a0four (4) cinderblocks of text in which you:\n\n1.\u00a0 Announce that you are not affiliated politically or intellectually with what has been attacked, scrutinized, questioned, etc \u2013 by the link your Facebook friend posted.\n\n2.\u00a0 Assert your incredible and unquestionable objectivity in general, preferably by claiming that you actually have no political orientation at all, that you are merely stopping by and commenting because you are an intellectual\u00a0David Banner, who travels Facebook righting logical and rhetorical wrongs, all in the name of truth and justice.\u00a0 It\u2019s your curse, really.\n\n3.\u00a0 Then procede\u00a0to blithely contradict whatever is at the link which you didn\u2019t read.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to sprinkle it\u00a0with accusations of intellectual sheepitude, directed toward anyone who actually believes what the person posted, but insist that you aren\u2019t trying to be insulting or argumentative.\n\n4.\u00a0 Close with some kind of argumentative insult, directed toward anyone who disagrees with you.\n\nNow 94% of the time, either nothing will happen because you will have successfully convinced everyone on Facebook of your perspective, possibly putting an intellectual end to an entire ideology.\u00a0 Or everyone will pile onto the comment section to cheer your bullet-proof logic and also to thank you for opening their eyes.\u00a0\n\nRemember, most political and intellectual topics are just a few glib paragraphs away from a rock-solid, species-wide resolution.\u00a0\u00a0In such normal circumstances,\u00a0simply pat yourself on the back and then you might want to go and hang out with some people who already shared your mindset before you enlightened the world with it.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can all re-enact the debate and congratulate each other for being so smart.\n\nOf course, a small percentage of the time, people will respond to your comment, and as baffling as this will seem to you, they might still disagree with you and defend whatever is at the link.\u00a0\n\nI know, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s like, didn\u2019t they read your cinderblocks?\n\nWell, no worries.\u00a0 First, check to see if they are making any spelling errors.\u00a0 Facebook has a well-known Zero Tolerance Policy when it comes to spelling and grammatical errors, so if you can detect one, then point it out and you will have rendered anything the commenter has said completely useless.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the\u00a0Reverse\u00a0Bangkok Checkmate \u2013 be careful with that move, it\u2019s like the nightshade, beautiful, mysterious, and deadly.\n\nUnfortunately, some of these folks will not make such errors, or they may claim that typos have nothing to do with reason, logic, arguments, politics, math, etc.\u00a0 And sometimes, because of this, they will refuse to\u00a0hang their heads in shame before\u00a0your obvious intellectual domination, and if that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll have to load on a few more cinderblocks.\n\n\n  1. Remember the salad bar.\u00a0 The idea is, you go through what the person said and find the weakest possible sentence, maybe two of them.\u00a0 Pull those suckers out and leave the rest behind.\u00a0 Especially if\u00a0there\u2019s anything in there to\u00a0correct and\/or eliminate any perceived weakness in the sentences you have selected.\n  2. Meditate upon your selections, imagining a single hand clapping, until you can recall nothing else the person has typed.\u00a0 When you are finished, look in the mirror and tell yourself that you are Nature\u2019s Greatest Miracle, ten solid times.\n  3. Rephrase your previous cinderblocks,\u00a0increasing smugness by approximately 50%.\u00a0\n  4. At the end, attack the two sentences you have selected.\u00a0 Insist that the two sentences not only represent the sum of everything the person has typed, but also\u00a0that they reflect a possible mental problem in the commenter, and declare him or her to be unfit for Facebook Discourse by reason of insanity.\n  5. Congratulate yourself for being smart, express pity for stupid people, then announce you are leaving because arguing with stupid people is such a waste of time.\u00a0 As opposed to most of your Facebook activity, which is all about cancer cures, synergistic money-making schemes, and philanthropy.\n  6. If you know how to spell sheep noises, then go ahead and type them in there \u2013 but ONLY if you know how to spell them (see above).\n\n\u00a0Well, by now you are probably talking to just two or three of the hundreds or possibly thousands of people who can see the link, so you can assume that everyone except those two or three people agree with you.\u00a0\n\nIf\u00a0anyone continues arguing with you, just keep rephrasing your cinderblocks.\u00a0 Make sure they are the big, industrial cinder blocks \u2013 you want to make fifteen or sixteen points at a time so no one can respond without a flow chart.\u00a0\n\nAlso, keep reminding the person that he or she is so beneath you intellectually, that you are violating all sorts of your own moral principles and also a few international treaties by even continuing to acknowledge them at all.\u00a0\n\nAll the while, be sure to announce frequently that you are abandoning the argument because it has deviated from standard Harvard Law School Debate Protocol, which we all know is the Law of Facebook.\u00a0 But don\u2019t really leave, sit there haunting the thread all day, jumping in for the last word every time anyone twitches.\n\n\nI can\u2019t stress this enough.\u00a0 You know you\u2019re right, and so does everyone else on Facebook, as they have tacitly made clear by their silence, so just go ahead and grout right over anything valid.\u00a0 If the person hounds you about it, then simply declare yourself the winner and leave, safe in the knowledge that another Dragon of Disinformation has been vanquished.\n\nLater, you can always meet up with representatives of the 99.999% of the population who agree with absolutely everything you say, and then you can all re-enact the argument without the pesky arguer.\u00a0 Your dominion should at that point be clear and beyond debate.\n\nGodspeed, Holy Facebook Warrior.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done some good work today.\n\n\n\nEarlier:\u00a0 Welcome To The Harmless Ice Monster Project\n\n\nAnd:\u00a0 The Golden Voice Dance Remix: Engaging The Milker\n\n\nAnd:\u00a0 Future Tom Blog Force: Crisis On The Internet\n\n\nPosted by on February 11, 2011 in Future Tom Grab Bag\n\n\nTags: , , , , , ,\n\n16 responses to \u201cHow To Conduct A Political Argument On\u00a0Facebook\n\n  1.

Ken Howell\n\n    February 12, 2011 at 11:01 pm\n\n    I think there\u2019s a real medium-as-message problem underlying the idea of discourse on the web, especially sites like Facebook (and I have taken to FB like a duck to water, don\u2019t get me wrong). Facebook is set up to mimic social interaction; but without the subtleties of facial expression, tone, good hygiene, etc., it\u2019s really easy to discount someone\u2019s argument, even to an extent their existence when they\u2019re not physically there. Also, waitng for responses, I think, lends itself to a real pronouncement-based form of dialogue, as well as a dearth of real questions. In fact, even without politically charged subject matter, how many people post questions? It seems to me to be in the vast minority. Anyway, sorry for the run-ons.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Log... (truncated)",

        "text":"\n\nIt Starts at Home: Confronting Anti-Blackness in South Asian Communities\n\nCreated by the Queer South Asian National Network, based on curriculum from East Coast Solidarity Summer. Modified by Sasha W., Monica, and Radha, based on curriculum by Sasha A. and Sheena.\n\n\nWe are a group of queer South Asians who believe that undoing anti-Blackness starts at home: in our families, given and chosen; in our communities; in the intimate spaces where conflict can often be hardest.\n\nWe understand that this should not be the work of Black people: this is our work, and it always has been. We understand that we will never be free until Black people are also free; our freedom is bound up, inextricably, in Black liberation.\n\nWe are committed to doing this work, and to providing the tools for other South Asian organizations, communities, leaders, and more to do this work. We hope that this guide is useful for other South Asians to hold these conversations within their own communities. You can download the PDF version of this guide here.\n\n\n  \u2022 Understanding anti-Black racism\n  \u2022 Breaking down how we are socialized to understand and reject Blackness\n  \u2022 Acknowledging and addressing what anti-Black racism looks like in our personal lives and communities\n  \u2022 Developing culturally competent ways of addressing anti-Black racism\n  \u2022 Laying the groundwork for effective allyship with Black communities that acknowledges privileges and shared oppressions\n  \u2022 Develop practical skills to fight anti-Black racism and support the #BlackLivesMatter movement\n  \u2022 Practice interrupting oppression\n\n\n  \u2022 Chart paper & markers\n  \u2022 Paper for participants to draw\n  \u2022 Crayons\/colored pencils\/markers\n\n\n  \u2022 Ideally 2 hours\n  \u2022 For a 1 hour version, run the following sections:\n    \u2022 Opening\n    \u2022 Why Are We Talking About This Now?\n    \u2022 Starting With Our Socialization\n    \u2022 Bringing it Home\n\n\n\nTo download in PDF format, click here.\n\nIt Starts at Home:\nConfronting Anti-Blackness in South Asian Communities\n\nOPENING (10 minutes)\n\n\n  \u2022 Ask everyone to introduce themselves with names and preferred gender pronouns (PGPs). If anyone is unsure, explain that PGPs are how you want to be referred to, e.g. he, she, they, etc. If there\u2019s less than 10 people, also ask participants to say why they are here.\n\nCommunity Agreements\n\n  \u2022 Ask everyone: what do you need in order to participate here?\n  \u2022 Take note of different answers. Leave the notes in a visible place.\n\n\nDrawing Exercise\n\n  \u2022 Explain that we\u2019re going to ground this conversation in our own personal experiences of racism: both experiencing and perpetuating racism. To start, ask everyone to draw their response to the following prompts:\n    \u2022 Think about a time when you experienced racism in your own life. What was this experience? What was your response? If you haven\u2019t experienced racism, why may that be?\n    \u2022 Think about a time when you perpetuated racism? What was this experience? What was it like?\n\n\n  \u2022 Ask for a few people to share. Make sure to ask for examples of both experiencing and perpetuating racism.\n  \u2022 If participants are highlighting only experiencing racism, speak to that. Ask participants why it\u2019s easier to talk about experiencing racism than perpetuating it.\n\n\nHistorical Context\n\n  \u2022 Explain the importance of talking about South Asian anti-Blackness in this particular historical moment. You can use the talking points below:\n    \u2022 The movements around #BlackLivesMatter, in response to Michael Brown\u2019s murder in Ferguson and Eric Garner\u2019s in Staten Island, have reinvigorated a national conversation around race. As South Asians, we have a complicated racial position in the U.S.: our communities experience racism, but also often perpetuate racism, especially against Black communities in the U.S.\n    \u2022 Many of us have experienced racism \u2013 for some of us, this is because we live in a post-9\/11 world. For others of us, racism is a daily part of life. However, we rarely create space to do our own work \u2013 to think about the ways in which we actually perpetuate racism, specifically against Black communities.\n\nOur Definition of Racism\n\n  \u2022 This definition of racism is taken from the People\u2019s Institute for Survival and Beyond. Explain racism as prejudice + power using the talking points below:\n    \u2022 Keep in mind our working definition of racism: Racism = prejudice + power. Because South Asians are often seen as less threatening, and sometimes as wealthy, we have conditional power in society. When that power is combined with prejudice, against other people of color, we are perpetuating systemic racism.\n\n\nLarge Group Discussion\n\n  \u2022 Explain that we\u2019re going to start from the beginning: with our first introductions to Blackness and Black people. We need to understand the source of our anti-Black racism in order to challenge it.\n  \u2022 Guide discussion using the following questions:\n    \u2022 At birth:\n      \u2022 Ask: What do we know about racism when we are first brought into the world?\n      \u2022 Nothing! All of our socialization around race is learned. We are going to work on unpacking that learning.\n    \u2022 First socialization:\n      \u2022 Ask: What do you recall as being your first socialization around Blackness? What\u2019s the first thing you remember learning or experiencing with or about people of African descent?\n      \u2022 What was this like?\n      \u2022 What messages did you receive?\n      \u2022 Reinforcement:\n        \u2022 Ask: How is this first socialization reinforced?\n  \u2022 What are or were the institutions and cultural factors that reinforced this first socialization?\n      \u2022 Examples can include: media, family gatherings, school, etc.\n      \u2022 Why didn\u2019t you ignore these messages?\n    \u2022 Present day:\n      \u2022 Ask: How is anti-Blackness continuously reinforced \u00a0in our communities?\n      \u2022 How does this make us feel?\n      \u2022 Have these feelings ever made you feel good\/powerful\/safe? How\/why?\n\n\n  \u2022 Highlight the importance of acknowledging that we live in a country built on anti-Blackness. It\u2019s part of our laws, our economy\u2013our \u201cjustice\u201d system. We need to recognize how we contribute to that anti-Blackness in order to confront it.\n\n\nLarge Group Discussion\n\n  \u2022 Thank everyone for sharing their own continuing socialization around anti-Blackness. This is powerful, but also vulnerable work. Acknowledge that it can be hard to see only the ways that we perpetuate racism\u2013without acknowledging and brainstorming the ways that we actively resist.\n  \u2022 Guide discussion using the following questions:\n    \u2022 Ask: Are we committed to undoing anti-Black racism in our own communities?\n      \u2022 We need to be. In many ways, that is the role that we need to play in this burgeoning movement: We need to challenge the ways that our communities participate in anti-Black racism.\n    \u2022 Ask: What are ways that we already do this?\n      \u2022 Take ideas from the group. If participants are having trouble coming up with examples, invite them to talk in pairs. Hang this list up.\n\nBringing It Home\n\n  \u2022 There is always someone, or maybe many people, who we absolutely dread having these conversations with. Who is that for you?\n    \u2022 Ask: Who are the two people that you can\u2019t imagine having this conversation with? Who is it hardest to confront?\n      \u2022 Take a couple of answers from the group. Answers often involve our families, given and chosen.\n    \u2022 Write down those 2 people in your life whom it\u2019s hardest to confront. Think of at least 3 strategies you could use to interrupt anti-Black racism with them.\n      \u2022 Remember that these strategies can be big or small: bringing someone with you to a protest, talking about the prison industrial system, highlighting Black leadership in your city, talking about moments you\u2019ve stood up against racism, or anything else.\n\n\n  \u2022 Ask a few people to share out. Write down strategies folks come up with and put them up in the room.\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Thank everyone for sharing, and give people a moment to take a deep breath. Acknowledge that this is a hard topic, and hard conversations to even imagine!\n  \u2022 Announce that the group is going to role-play a couple of these hard conversations.\n    \u2022 Ask for a volunteer who is willing to model the strategies they just wrote out. They will act as themselves.\n    \u2022 Ask this volunteer to give life to the situation: who are they talking to, what is the context? E.g. my dad and I are watching the Lakers game after he gets home from work.\n    \u2022 Ask for another volunteer to act as the first volunteer\u2019s \u201cdreaded conversation\u201d person.\n    \u2022 Role-play. Allow the conversation to go on for 5 minutes max.\n\n\n  \u2022 Applaud your volunteers!\n  \u2022 Ask them to reflect first:\n    \u2022 How was that for you?\n    \u2022 How are you feeling?\n  \u2022 Ask the room:\n    \u2022 What went well?\n    \u2022 What could either volunteer have done differently?\n  \u2022 Role-play 1-2 more times, depending on how much time you have.\n  \u2022 During the debrief, acknowledge that these \u2018dreaded\u2019 conversations are ongoing and may not have breakthroughs after the first time. \u00a0It is important, nontheless, to continue having these conversations with friends and family.\n\nCONCLUSION (15 mins)\n\n\n  \u2022 Reflect on what the group has done in a short amount of time: you\u2019ve identified your own experiences perpetuating racism, interrogated where that racism comes from for you, and brainstormed and practiced ways to interrupt anti-Black racism, in big ways and small. These are all crucial pieces of change work, especially for non-Black communities of color. We need to change ourselves, first.\n  \u2022 Ask: What\u2019s one way that you will use the information from this workshop when you leave here? If there are less than 10 people, invite everybody to share. If there are more, invite everyone to share with a partner, and then take a few examples.\n  \u2022 Thank everybody for coming. Make sure you get contact information (email addresses, phone numbers, etc.)\n  \u2022 Give everyone a copy of this curriculum when they leave, and encourage them to have these conversations with their people.\n\nFOLLOW UP (After the Workshop)...

Because it is in a classroom and not a peace club, the anticipated audience is a mix of students ranging from anti-war to pro-military. This training can help trainers \"get their foot in the door\" by connecting with sympathetic teachers in the school, and may lead to invitations to come back for longer trainings.\n\nThe Poverty Draft\nThis session is like a counter-recruitment 101. It explores how the military is reaching out to youth and how larger societal forces like poverty, racism, and classism impact who is targeted most by recruiters. The connections between education funding cuts and increased militarism in schools are made, and the lies that recruiters tell are examined. Alternatives to the military are presented.\n\nHow a Recruiter Gets Your Number (PDF, 861KB)\nThis is an informational session on how military recruiters operate. Specific attention is given to tools that help recruiters get access to youth including school access, ASVAB, No Child Left Behind, JAMRS, and JROTC. We look at each of these recruitment tools as an opportunity for activists to campaign against military recruitment. We also look at what appeals to people about going into the military, and look at the truths behind the values recruiters promote and the promises they make.\n\n\nCore Organizing Skills\nWhat is organizing and how do we do it? This workshop explains how organizing differs from other forms of social change (like service providing\/advocacy). It then moves into specific skills for being persuasive, in settings such as school board meetings, and other skills for building relationships and becoming an effective organizer.\n\nCreating and Expanding Your Group\nThis workshop offers leadership skills training to help groups become more effective. It is especially for counter-recruitment groups looking to strengthen their own internal leadership and ability to organize. It includes theory and skills about leadership development, decision-making and team-building. A major section is devoted to expanding the group, especially how to reach out across lines of diversity, such as race and class.\n\n\nHow to Build a Campaign: Setting Goals, Making Allies, and Evaluating Outcomes (PDF. 1.16MB)\nCampaigns wage struggles for specific outcomes that further larger social change goals. Like a story, they have a beginning, middle and end - setting goals, waging the struggle, and eventually winning. This workshop focuses on defining a campaign and building skills to create a counter-recruitment campaign. The skills include setting specific goals that lead to larger outcomes, reaching out to new allies to win that campaign, and evaluating a campaign.\n\nThe Big Picture of Counter-Recruitment: Seeing CR as a Movement\nFor those already involved in counter-recruitment work, this workshop helps folks put counter-recruitment into a larger context of militarism. This workshop focuses on the dynamics of social movements and puts smaller campaigns into the bigger picture of social change. Folks will build skills in the strategic choices they need to further their campaign, sustain themselves for the long run, and get familiar with the Movement Action Plan, a powerful framework for how movements develop over time.\n\n\nMedia and Messaging: Presentation, Message Discipline, Telling Stories\nIn order to effect the kind of change that we long for we need to engage, and on some level mobilize, large numbers of people. To do this we need to tell a story that speaks to people's values; a story that reframes the conflicts we face; a story that tells a different future than the one projected by the power holders; a story that people can sympathize with and imagine themselves in. And it is not enough just to tell a story; we need to amplify it. This requires navigating through the filters of the corporate-owned media - the less-than-ideal channels through which many people get their information.\n\nWho we are\n\nAFSC is a Quaker organization devoted to service, development, and peace programs throughout the world.

Women of Color Against Violence for much of this organizing information.\n\nSOA Watch is made up of hundreds of local groups around the hemisphere, doing work in their own communities to lay the groundwork for a successful campaign to close the School of the Americas. Your work to connect with others in your own community is a key part of our movement's work to close the SOA.\n\nWe are still working to expand and improve our information on building local groups. Please send feedback and suggestions to\u00a0Becca at This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it .\n\nFind or list a local SOA Watch group in your community.\n\nGeneral Thoughts on Local Organizing\n\n  \u2022 You do not need as many people as you think to do effective organizing. Three people are enough to begin a local group. Even if your group does not attract lots of members, you can still do important work in your area.\n\n  \u2022 Understand that people will put in varying amounts of time into organizing efforts. A few people will do lots of work; some will contribute every once in a while; others will show up at special events; some will only contribute financially, etc. Rather than become frustrated that not everyone is putting in the same amount of work, learn to work with what people ARE able to do and make the most of what they ARE willing to contribute. That way, they will not become alienated from the work, and will hopefully later increase their commitment to the group.\n\n  \u2022 You do not need to know as much as you think to do organizing work. Most successful organizers learn by doing and by trial and error.\n\n  \u2022 Do not become disheartened by failure and mistakes. It is through mistakes that one learns how to organize effectively. For every successful event or campaign someone organizes, they probably were involved in ten events\/campaigns that did not work.\n\n  \u2022 Possible Activities for Local SOA Watch Groups\n\n    1. Form study groups to educate yourselves on the issues of the School of the Americas, U.S. foreign policy towards Latin America, insitutional and personal racism and militarism.\n\n    2. Do education in your community. Host a public video showing of a film about the SOA (Click here for list of available videos and DVDs). Table at local events and hand out flyers about the School of the Americas (Click here for flyers available for downloading). Support the work of community organizations in your region, and work to connect local issues with the SOA. Cut and paste SOA Watch's flyers to make them relevant to current community struggles. Host a speaker in your community to talk about the SOA.\n\n    3. Coordinate Congressional petition or letter writing campaigns urging Representatives to co-sponsor HR 1707 to suspend operations at the SOA\/ WHINSEC. Ask Senators to sponsor similar legislation in the Senate. (Click here for more info and for updates on the legislative campaign).\n\n    4. Coordinate, sponsor and actively participate in discussions, rallies and demonstrations addressing issues central to militarism, to US foreign policy towards Latin America, to racism and to the lives of those most affected by places like the SOA.\n\n    5. Conduct teach-ins and consciousness-raising sessions among your communities.\n\n    6. Promote activities which create dialogue and coalitions among activists working for justice.\n\n    7. With your local group, write letters to the editor of local papers responding to coverage of militarism, of Latin America, of community struggles for justice. (Click here for more tips on media outreach).\n\n    8. Promote activities which organize and advance the leadership of youth, especially youth most affected by places like the SOA.\n\n    9. Use media advisories, news releases and follow-up calls to get media coverage of your community events, vigils, speakers or demonstrations. (Click here for sample press releases and more).\n\n    10.

        "url":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Get-Your-Local-Congressman-to-Know-You",
        "text":"How to Get Your Local Congressman to Know You\n\nCo-authored by wikiHow Staff\n\nUpdated: March 29, 2019\n\nGetting to know your congressman can help you feel you have a say in your government. If you are consistently politically involved, you can develop a relationship with local politicians. Develop your presence in local politics by volunteering and donating to political campaigns. Meet with your congressman in person at events and town hall meetings. Make sure to interact in a professional, grateful manner. This will help your congressman remember you.\n\nMethod 1 of 3:\nDeveloping Your Presence\n\n  1. 1\n    Join political organizations in your area. If you want your congressman to know you, you need to make your name politically. People from Congress pay attention to those who are politically active, as they're seeking out likeminded people to help them gain favor in the community. If you want to make an impact, increase your current involvement in politics. If you are already part of an organization, for example, take on a leadership position or plan an event. This could get your congressman's attention.[1]\n    \u2022 If you're not already part of a political organization, look for advocacy groups in your area that interest you. If you're interested in immigration reform, for example, you could join an immigration advocacy group.\n    \u2022 You could also start your own group or lead your own initiative within the community or an existing group. Look to your Facebook and other social networks to find likeminded people who share your political views. Consider getting together with them to do something like start a petition or stage a protest. This could potentially get the attention of a member of Congress.\n  2. 2\n    Develop your relationship with their staff. Congressmen and women all have staff members. Usually, you cannot contact someone in Congress directly, but you can get through to staff on occasion. Having a solid relationship with a congressman's staff can help you eventually meet the congressman himself. You can also work on doing things like inviting staff to events or greeting staff members if you see them somewhere like a county fair or political rally.[2]\n    \u2022 Introduce yourself to staff whenever possible. If a member of your congressman's staff is at an event, go up and talk to them. Say something like, \"I'm part of the local Republican party here and I just wanted to introduce myself.\" If you have any messages to pass along to your congressman, politely request that staff members do so.\n    \u2022 Never treat the staff as unimportant or lower than your congressman. It is their job to act as a filter for your congressman, figuring out should be brought to his attention. If you are polite and make a good impression on staff members, your congressman may come to know your name.\n  3. 3\n    Donate to a campaign. If you have any disposable income, consider making a donation to your congressman's campaign. Congressmen often meet with big donors, or at least send thank-you letters. A sizable donation may help your congressman come to know you.[3]\n    \u2022 Your congressman may also host events where donations are taken. For example, congressmen may sometimes have dinners where you donate a set amount for a plate. This could be a great way to meet with your congressman in person while making a donation.\n    \u2022 If you don't have the money for a big donation, even a small donation with other efforts may get your congressmen's attention.\n  4. 4\n    Call your representatives. If something is concerning you as a voter, try calling your congressman. Call them at their state or district office if you have something you wish to bring to their attention. You're unlikely to get through directly to your congressmen, but if you consistently call to make your voice known in a respectful fashion, your congressmen may eventually come to know you.[4]\n    \u2022 You can find contact information for your elected officials on the US government's website. You can enter information like your city, state, and zip code to get the proper phone numbers.[5]\n  5. 5\n    Write letters. Handwritten or typed letters are actually more effective than e-mails if you want to get your congressman's attention. A written out letter that you send to your congressmen's office shows you took initiative. If you want to get your congressmen to know you, write them a letter with any concerns you have about current events.[6]\n    \u2022 Remember to be respectful in the letter. Choose your words wisely and express yourself in a calm fashion, even if you disagree. Comb the letter carefully for typos afterwards so you send out a polished draft.\n    \u2022 Your congressman may not respond directly to your letter. However, remember that the point is to gradually establish your voice over time.\n\nMethod 2 of 3:\nMeeting Your Congressman in Person\n\n  1. 1\n    See if you can schedule a meeting. If you really want a congressman to know you, try meeting with him face-to-face. Scheduling a meeting is simple. All you have to do is call their local office and request a meeting to discuss an issue of importance to you. Someone should be able to get you into the schedule.[7]\n    \u2022 You may end up meeting with staff members. However, remember that a positive relationship with congressional staff can eventually get your name to the congressman.\n    \u2022 Know what you want to meet about. For example, if you're a teacher, tell the congressman you want to meet to ask questions about an upcoming vote regarding school funding.\n  2. 2\n    Invite them to events. If you are a member of any political organizations, invite your congressman to speak. You can also invite your congressman to speak at things like charities or events for a local library, animal shelter, or other organization. If you volunteer for these types of organizations, reach out to your congressman. You should be able to call their office and see if they're able to attend events. This is a great way to get your congressman to know you, as you'll be showcasing that you're politically involved and able to take initiative.[8]\n    \u2022 Your congressman will be more likely to make time for your event if you can show him the benefit for him. You can try hosting a fundraiser or invite him to speak about an issue that will be important in an upcoming election.\n  3. 3\n    Show up at town hall meetings. Congressmen host town hall meetings where they meet with voters one-on-one. If you are a regular at town hall meetings and engage in conversation and questions, your congressman may eventually come to know you.[9]\n    \u2022 Be prepared for town hall meetings. Your congressman is more likely to remember someone who had an articulate question or comment planned out ahead of time. Read up on current events and think of a question you could ask at the meeting.\n  4. 4\n    Give it time. It can take years to establish yourself politically enough that your congressman knows you. Have patience and take little victories as they come. If you receive a letter from your congressmen, for example, keep in mind he probably did not write the response himself. However, if you continue to engage with your congressman's staff respectfully, you may eventually break through and talk to him directly.[10]\n\nMethod 3 of 3:\nEnsuring Effective Interactions\n\n  1. 1\n    Dress professionally. If you want your congressman to remember you well, always dress professionally. You want to make a good impression by wearing business-like attire to events and meetings with you representative.[11]\n    \u2022 If you're meeting your congressmen on behalf of an organization, you should wear a t-shirt or button advertising that organization.\n  2. 2\n    Learn about your cause ahead of time. When you meet with your congressmen, whether face-to-face in a town hall meeting, make sure you go in knowing what is being discussed. Congressmen are more likely to get to know people who are politically involved, so do some research before meeting your congressman.[12]\n    \u2022 Be prepared before you meet your congressman. Make sure to write out notes with a rough idea of what you will say and ask and review them ahead of time. Read or watch the news in the days leading up to meeting your congressman.\n    \u2022 Research based on what will be discussed. If you're going as an advocate for an organization you work for, for example, make sure you read up on your organization extensively ahead of time. If you're going to a town hall meeting covering something like, say, healthcare, read up on the healthcare debate ahead of time.\n  3. 3\n    Avoid reaching out via social media. Many people attempt to reach their congressman via tweeting or commenting on Facebook. This is usually ineffective. Congressmen and women are unlikely to read every tweet, so do not expect to get your congressman's attention by reaching out via social media.[13]\n  4. 4\n    Remember to thank your congressman. After meeting with your congressman, offer a sincere \"Thank you.\" Being polite will help your congressmen remember you fondly. This can keep your name on their mind in the future.[14]\n    \u2022 Say something like, \"Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me. I really appreciate it.\"\n\nCommunity Q&A\n\n    Ask a Question\n    200 characters left\n    Include your email address to get a message when this question is answered.\n\n\n        About This Article\n\n        Co-Authored By:\n        wikiHow Staff Editor\n        This article was co-authored by our trained team of editors and researchers who validated it for accuracy and comprehensiveness.

Here\u2019s what you need to know about what \u201cnarrative change\u201d means and how we can all effectively use it strengthen our efforts to end discrimination and build peace.\n\n\nPublic narratives are stories that help us understand our world. We encounter these stories everywhere: in the news, in politics, in conversations with our friends and family. Some are such common assumptions that they\u2019ve become dominant narratives that over-determine how we understand important issues.\n\n\nRight now, dominant public narratives about issues of peace and justice are setting us up to lose. We hear them every day: Islam is inherently violent. Immigrants are a threat to our way of life. Police and prisons are necessary to keep us safe.\n\nAt the American Friends Service Committee, we\u2019re employing narrative change strategies to shift people\u2019s focus and the ways our issues are framed to help us build widespread support. If we can change the story, we can create the context for our work to win.\n\n\n\u201cNarrative change\u201d is a hot communication buzzword right now. But we see it as a part of organizing, a set of tools to use to help us build support and create real change.\n\nAs with any organizing work, it\u2019s important to have a clear goal identified: Know what you\u2019re trying to achieve and why narrative change is necessary to win.\n\nThen we do research to understand existing narratives and test narratives and messages we think might help us move people to take action to solve the problems we\u2019re addressing.\n\nTo develop strong messages, it\u2019s important to know the audience you\u2019re speaking to. Identify who you need to move on your issue, and who you can actually move. These might not be the same groups, but maybe there\u2019s a progressive base you can reach who can then be mobilized to move the elected officials who represent them, for example.\n\nFinally, narrative change requires a lot of flexibility. You have to be prepared for your messages to fail, or for them to be so successful that they get co-opted. That means regularly re-evaluating and re-strategizing as needed. Once you\u2019ve done the advance work of identifying goals and audiences, doing research, and developing messages to test, you can be responsive to breaking news and shifts in the organizing context.\n\n\n\nOur friends at the nonprofit Opportunity Agenda have created a\u00a0great, research-based rubric for messages that talk about issues in a way that inspires people to take action: First, establish a value shared by your audience. Then, identify the problem you\u2019re trying to address as a threat to shared values. Offer a solution to that problem and a way people can take action to bring policies or practices in line with the shared value.\n\nFor example, at AFSC, we\u2019re organizing against the profiling and surveillance of Muslims through our Communities Against Islamophobia project. Earlier this year, we conducted a study that found that progressive audiences were most likely to be moved to action by messages that led with human rights. Moving forward, when we talk to our progressive base about this issue, we will use human rights language to help move them to act against profiling and surveillance policies.\n\n\nOur messaging formula looks something like this:\n\n  \u2022 Value: Respect for human rights is an essential, universal value.\n  \u2022 Problem: Profiling and surveillance of Muslims is a threat to everyone\u2019s human rights.\n  \u2022 Solution: We need to end the profiling and surveillance of Muslims.\n  \u2022 Action: Join us next Thursday at City Hall to tell our City Council members to vote NO on Resolution 123, which would increase funding for police surveillance programs.\n\nOur research for this program also showed that if we want to inspire people who are politically moderate to take action against profiling and surveillance policies, we should focus our messages on a slightly different value: safety and peace. As a result, when we develop messages to move moderate audiences to action, we\u2019ll use this language. The formula is the same as the one we use for progressives, but since the shared value is different, we also frame the problem a little differently:\n\n  \u2022 Value: Everyone deserves to live in safe and peaceful communities.\n  \u2022 Problem: Profiling and surveillance of Muslims is a threat to everyone\u2019s ability to live in safety and peace.\n  \u2022 Solution: We need to end the profiling and surveillance of Muslims.\n  \u2022 Action: Join us next Thursday at City Hall to tell our City Council members to vote NO on Resolution 123, which would increase funding for police surveillance programs.\n\nSee how even when the action or outcome you seek is the same,\u00a0you can use different shared values to speak to different audiences?\n\nCommunities Against Islamophobia is just one of AFSC\u2019s narrative\u00a0change projects. We\u2019re also working to change the narrative\u00a0on Gaza and Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK\/North Korea). Our messaging for these projects uses the same format.\n\nFirst, we researched existing narratives and shared values.\n\nIn the case of Gaza, we found that mainstream U.S. media rarely cover Gaza, and that people in the U.S. know very little about Gaza or Palestine. But we also found that people responded to messages focused on human rights and dignity\u2014frames that\u00a0we\u2019ve been using to move people to advocate for ending the Israeli blockade of Gaza via our Gaza Unlocked campaign.\n\nIn the case of the DPRK, we found that U.S. media overwhelmingly\u00a0portray the DPRK as a threat. But when we frame our messages in terms of engagement\u2014at both the individual level, as in people-to-people exchanges, and the national level, as in diplomacy\u2014these messages stick in part because the overwhelming majority of people in the U.S. support engagement with North Korea rather than isolation. We\u2019ve been using engagement messages to help build support for peace on the Korean Peninsula,\u00a0and have been continuously monitoring their success since 2015.\n\n\nInterested in working with AFSC to change the narrative on one of these issues?

Just remember to be patient; not everyone will be as prepared for these changes as you are.\n\nState It\n\nAs always, you\u2019ll need to state your full name and address for the election official who checks you in. They\u2019ll check your information in the poll book.\u00a0 Understandably, some people are uneasy about announcing their name in public, but it is the law, and it helps ensure openness in elections.\n\nShow It\n\nNext, it\u2019s time to show your photo ID. That way, poll workers can compare your face to your photo and confirm that you really are you.\n\nThe address on your ID doesn\u2019t have to be current. And the name on your ID doesn\u2019t need to be an exact match for your name in the poll book. (So, Richards who go by Rich, Bobs who are also Roberts and Susans with IDs that say Sue can relax.) Of course, there are certain requirements.\u00a0 Your ID should look like you, even if you\u2019ve colored your hair, shaved your beard or lost some weight.\n\nSign It\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll sign the poll book (unless a physical disability prevents it).\u00a0 Your signature or mark should go right next to your name and address. Now you\u2019re ready to vote.\n\nFor more, watch this informational video:\n\n\"What to Expect at the Polling Place\"",

        "text":"How to organise a public protest, whether that\u2019s a candlelight vigil or a photo stunt\n\n\u00a0The Children Society campaigners\n\nWhen you think an issue is important and other tactics might not get enough attention, protesting can help raise public awareness, get media coverage and send a clear message to your target.\n\nPeople can protest in lots of different ways:\n\nA demonstration is often a loud form of protest. People hold up signs and chant or sing in front of a targeted site.\n\nA stunt is like a demonstration, except the aim is to capture a message visually \u2013 it\u2019s usually something fun and humorous and often involves dressing up!\n\nA march is a large number of people gathering and walking a route while chanting. This can be quite a disruptive kind of protest.\n\nA vigil involves a group of people sitting or standing silently in a specific location. They\u2019re usually held at night, with candlelight. This can be a very positive way to raise awareness of an issue and causes minimal public disruption.\n\nA sit-in usually involves a group occupying a public or private space where they will attract attention. Members of the protest make a demand and stay put till this demand is met or at least discussed.\n\nThe right to protest is a vital part of our democracy. Protesting is legal, but there are some restrictions, so make sure you have spoken to The Children\u2019s Society first.\n\nHow to organise your protest\n\nStep 1: Come up with an idea for your protest\n\n  \u2022 What is the message you want to get across \u2013 and to whom?\n  \u2022 Make the message as simple to understand as possible.\n  \u2022 What type of protest will work best? A photo stunt is visual and often amusing so it\u2019s attractive to the media. They are also good for sharing your message through social media.\n  \u2022 How can you visually get your message across?\n  \u2022 What props do you need?\n\nStep\u00a02: Decide on a time and location\n\n  \u2022 How does the time and location relate to your target?\n  \u2022 Who else will see the protest? Causing maximum inconvenience (eg in rush hour traffic) may not always result in the best outcome or sympathy for your issue. Give the council and\/or police a headsup, and ask us for advice first.\n\nStep 3: Let people know\n\nA successful protest needs to get people\u2019s attention.\n\n  \u2022 Spread the word through social media, posters, flyers, local media and word of mouth.\n  \u2022 Let us know your plans. We can help you spread the word.\n\nStep 4: Think creative and catchy\n\n  \u2022 Make your stunt eye catching and visual. This will help attract the media and the general public.\n  \u2022 Simple slogans stick in people\u2019s memory. It needs to make sense and not be aggressive. You want passers-by to understand and be educated about your issue, not be confused or annoyed.\n  \u2022 A local band or people playing instruments can help keep things tuneful.\n\nStep 5: Get equipped\n\n  \u2022 List the equipment that you\u2019ll need. For example: megaphones, cameras, banners, placards, props, flyers etc.\n  \u2022 Plan how you will get things to and from the location.\n  \u2022 Make sure to take your pictures in landscape as this will make them easier to share. STEP 6 Check the weather\n  \u2022 You don\u2019t want to be standing around getting too cold or too hot \u2013 bring whatever you will need (umbrellas, sun cream, water or snacks).\n  \u2022 Make sure your props are weatherproof.\n\nStep 7: Be informative\n\nA big part of protesting is increasing public awareness, so ensure some people at the protest can hand out flyers to passers-by or approach them to sign an action.\n\nStep 8: Clean up your act\n\nMake sure you clean up when you\u2019re done \u2013 you don\u2019t want to get fined for littering after all your hard work.\n\nDownload this guide",
