In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn\u2019t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do\u2014the whole world is shot through with it.\n\nMath allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It\u2019s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does \u201cpublic opinion\u201d really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer?\n\nHow Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician\u2019s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman\u2014minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia\u2019s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can\u2019t figure out about you, and the existence of God.\n\nEllenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is \u201can atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.\u201d With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be Wrong will show you how.\n\nYou might also enjoy...\n\nPlease wait while the item is added to your bag...",

Selective extractions using surface materials can be used to extract a specific component\u00a0of the soil that may have been added by degassing biological activity or electrochemical cells. Bioleach, a technology that Actlabs has developed, dissolves remnant proteins that bacteria have left behind when the die. These proteins migrate directly above mineral deposits by a variety of processes and bioleach is designed to digest this soil component which can then be analyzed by ICP\/MS or for most effectiveness by\u00a0high resultion ICP\/MS. Enzyme Selective Extraction dissolves metals that have been adsorbed onto amorphous manganese dioxides (but not from crystaline managanese oxides which comprise the bulk of manganese but is more related to parent material).\u00a0Sodium pyrophosphate will digest organic material. Sodium acetate pH5 or\u00a0pH7 will digest exchangeable cations adsorbed on clay or co-precipitated on carbonates. There are also a number of leaches like hot and cold hydroxylamine leaches\u00a0 that will dissolve amorphous and crystalline iron and manganese oxides. Generally to be most effective at depth penetration, \u00a0the weakest leaches are best including Bioleach and Enzyme Selective Extraction.\u00a0Spatiotemporal Geochemical Hydrocarbons\u00a0(SGH) is also an extractive procedure that has been useful in finding buried ore deposits in difficult terrain.\n\nActivation Laboratories Ltd. | 41 Bittern Street, Ancaster, Ontario, L9G 4V5, Canada | TF: +1.888.228.5227\nSearch | Privacy | Contact Us | News RSS | Login",

Readers are introduced to the basic theory of quantum phases, their phase transitions, and their observable properties.\n\nThis second edition begins with nine chapters, six of them new, suitable for an introductory course on quantum phase transitions, assuming no prior knowledge of quantum field theory. There are several new chapters covering important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory.\n\nWeb pages of the first edition",

The antibody-mediated hot-start method means no enzyme pre-activation is required before or during thermocycling, translating into much faster PCR protocol times than other methods of hot-start protection. The master mix includes a concentration of magnesium that is optimized to work for almost all reactions. Additional magnesium chloride solution is provided for further optimization if required. The master mix is also compatible with most additives used to enhance amplification efficiency of high GC amplicons.\n\nKit Contents\n\n  \u2022 2.5X Master Mix\n  \u2022 10 mM MgCI2\n  \u2022 Reagent Grade Water\n  \u2022 LightScanner Master Mix User\u2019s Guide\n\nKit Part Nos.\n\n  \u2022 HRLS-ASY-0002 \u2013 Reactions 100\n  \u2022 HRLS-ASY-0003 \u2013 Reactions 500\n\nDownload Information Sheet\n\n\nLCGreen Plus Melting Dye\n\nLCGreen Plus dye is specifically designed for Hi-Res Melting curve analysis to detect DNA sequence variants. The addition of LCGreen Plus dye increases the melting temperature of DNA by 1-3 \u00b0C and may require adjustment of cycling parameters. This dye is manufactured exclusively by BioFire Defense and its chemical structures are unique among the scientific and patent literature. LCGreen Plus dye is tailored specifically for Hi-Res Melting and has the unique ability to detect heteroduplexes during melting analysis after PCR. Just add the dye to your sample before PCR. LCGreen Plus dye is extremely stable, does not inhibit PCR, and is a \u201csaturation\u201d dye which makes it possible to detect multiple PCR products in a mixture during melting analysis.\n\nKit Details\n\nLCGreen Plus is tailored for use in melting instruments with 96- or 384-well microtiter plates. It has superb fluorescence intensity and can be used with most fluorescence based PCR detection systems such as the Roche LightCycler\u00ae instrument. For optimal performance, the use of a Hi-Res Melting instrument is suggested.\n\nNumber of Reactions\n\n  \u2022 1 mL \u2013 1,000 Reactions\n  \u2022 10 x 1 mL \u2013 10,000 Reactions\n\nKit Part Nos.\n\n  \u2022 BCHM-ASY-0005 \u2013 Reactions 1,000\n  \u2022 BCHM-ASY-0006 \u2013 Reactions 10,000\n\nDownload Information Sheet",

        "text":"Caption: Animation of the structure of the 6s atomic orbital, cut in half to show the internal structure. Orbitals contain an atom's electrons, which are found around the central atomic nucleus (not seen). Each orbital can hold two electrons. The 6s orbital is the sixth spherical s orbital out from the nucleus. Orbitals further from the nucleus are at a higher energy, and orbitals are filled from the lowest energy (level one) first. An atomic orbital is a mathematical model of the location of an electron around an atomic nucleus. Electrons do not orbit the nucleus as might be imagined, but instead exist as a standing wave around it. The phases of the wave are arbitrarily coloured red (negative) and blue (positive). S orbitals are spherical, and comprise concentric shells of alternating positive and negative wave function phases.\n\nRelease details: Model release not required.
