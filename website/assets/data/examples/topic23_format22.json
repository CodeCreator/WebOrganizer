        "text":"The Portuguese island of Madeira is part of that country's maritime legacy and one of the most popular beach destinations in Europe. The latter has much to do with its southerly location, lying about 430 miles from the coast of Africa and about 600 miles southwest of Lisbon. As Lisbon is the transportation hub of the mainland, that city is one of the world's most convenient launching pads for a trip to Maderia, even if there are only two ways to travel to Madeira from Lisbon.\n\nStep 1\n\nBook a flight on either Portugal's national carrier TAP ( or Easy Jet ( from Lisbon International Airport (LIS) to Maderia Airport (FNL) in Funchal. You may also be able to find charter flights via White Airways ( through a Lisbon-based travel agency.\n\nStep 2\n\nAppear at Lisbon's airport at least one hour prior to your departure (the flight to Madeira is within metropolitan Portugal, and thus a domestic flight). If you do not wish to take a taxi, Lisbon's bus line 91 is a public airport shuttle bus and runs through most of downtown Lisbon.\n\nStep 3\n\nBook a cabin on a cruise if you wish to incorporate a stop in Funchal as part of a larger trip by sea. Cruise lines such as Silver Sea ( and Crystal Cruises ( have regularly scheduled departures from Lisbon with Funchal in Madeira on the itinerary.\n\n\n  \u2022 A third option for traveling from Lisbon to Madeira is by freighter. Many freighters have passenger cabins. Lisbon is a major European port, and there is much commerce between the Portuguese capital and Madeira. But freighter travel is irregular, and if you commit to this route, you must wait in Lisbon until you find a ship going your way.\n\nPhoto Credits\n\n  \u2022 Jupiterimages\/ Images\n\nSlider images:\n\n  1.

The\u00a0reasons to visit Tuscany\u00a0are actually countless! Let\u2019s see how to arrive in Tuscany.\n\nArriving to Tuscany by plane\n\nThe two major International airports serving Tuscany are\u00a0Pisa and Florence,but there are also a few smaller airports for charter. The most important airport is the\u00a0Galileo Galilei Airport in Pisa, the second in central Italy after Rome for number of passengers.\u00a0Florence\u2019s Airport Amerigo Vespucci, also known as Peretola Airport, is instead much smaller, and can be ideal to reach Tuscany\u2019s main town.\n\nIf you come from Europe, you\u2019ll find direct flights with competitive rates getting directly to Pisa Galileo Galilei Airport. Flights from North America, Canada, and Australia mostly arrive to Rome and are more expensive.\n\nArriving to Tuscany by train\n\nTuscany can be easily reached by train from any part of Italy and Europe.\u00a0You can find train timetables and buy tickets online on\u00a0Trenitalia, the Italian railway network.\n\nTuscany is crossed by the fast\u00a0Eurostar trains\u00a0that integrate the dense network of regional and local trains.\u00a0Florence\u2019s Santa Maria Novella Railway Station\u00a0(SMN) is on the main national railway line, that connects the north, Milan via Bologna, to the south of Italy, via Arezzo to Rome and Naples. Trains arriving from across Europe arrive in Florence\u2019s Santa Maria Novella Station.\n\nArriving to Tuscany by car\n\nThere are\u00a03 main highways, called\u00a0Autostrade, that connect Tuscany to the rest of Italy and Europe. The Autostrada del Sole (A1 from Milan to Naples, and A3 from Naples to Reggio Calabria), connects the north to the south of Italy. The A12 Genova-Livorno follows the Tyrrhenian coast and arrive to Rome, it is the more direct link with France, via the Liguria region. On\u00a0the website of Autostrade\u00a0you\u2019ll find very useful information including real time news on traffic conditions.\n\nAbout the author\n\nHi! My name is Elena, I'm a travel writer and a happy mom living near Florence. I love to explore Tuscany to discover special places and I have a great passion for Tuscan Cooking. On this blog I share my experiences on special hotels and places to visit in Tuscany and Italy, and about my grandmother's tasty Recipes!

Here are some ways you can be better prepared for your journey.\n\nThe First Steps to Traveling Internationally\n\nWhile planning to travel overseas for the first time can feel exciting, your lack of experience could cause you to feel anxious and unprepared. However, planning ahead can help to ease your mind and make the process feel like it is running more efficiently. If you have not already filed for your passport, this is the first step you need to take. Search for the Passport Acceptance Facility closest to you and bring your original birth certificate and a photo ID with you when you visit. Getting your passport in the mail could take anywhere from four to six weeks, but your passport will last for ten years. It is also a good idea to purchase international travel insurance so that you and your belongings are safe while you are overseas.\n\nDetermine If You Need to File for a Visa\n\nThis can be a complicated process because countries often change the rules about whether a visa is required or not. Research what rules are in place in the country you plan on visiting, and if you do need to purchase a visa, allow yourself plenty of time to complete the process.\n\nTraveling on a Budget\n\nWhile it might be more ideal to stay in a hotel while you\u2019re away, a cheaper alternative is to stay in hostels or search for an organized campsite group. If you decide that camping is the best solution, remember to account for rainy weather. Another thing to research ahead of time is what the currency exchange rates are in the country you plan on visiting. While it is not a good idea to carry a large amount of cash with you everywhere you go, it is also not a great situation to have to keep paying fees each time you want to buy a cup of coffee either.\n\nPlan for the Unexpected\n\nIf you knew every aspect of your trip beforehand, your journey would be boring. One of the best aspects of traveling to another country is not knowing what to expect. Some of the best memories are made when an unforeseen event happens, so embrace the unexpected with open arms.\n\nCategories: Blog",

Here\u2019s the best guide for KLIA2 to get to check-in and not miss your flight! A great tip is to stay at the new Tunes KLIA2 and it will make your travelling and transit so much better!\n\nAir Asia recently started using KLIA2 for all their flights and there has been advice for passengers to actually be at the airport at least 3 hours before flight times. I had one concern as my flight on\u00a0 is at 6:45am in the morning. That really gave me quite a lot to worry about since it\u2019s advisable to be at the airport 3 hours before departure! I need to be at the airport before 3:45am. Early morning check in can be quite congested surprisingly as they tend to be cheaper to book apparently.\n\nI had a few options to consider \u2013 did a lot of research and these were the options I have!\n\nOption (1) Take a cab from the city and pay rm130 \u2013 150 at least since it\u2019s way past midnight \u2013 or I might not be able to hail a cab at that hour!\n\nOption (2) Take the earliest bus from KL Sentral at 3am in the morning \u2013 it\u2019s not expensive at less than RM10 but I still need to find a cab or someone to send me to KL Sentral \u2013 plus I might arrive too late in KLIA2 for checkin \u2013 what if the bus is late? What if this and that ~~~ *headache la* So much to worry about \u2013 so stress laaa~~\n\nOption (3) for me was to stay in Tune Hotel \u2013 stress free and not so expensive.\n\n\n*Photo from Tune Hotels*\n\nIt was really an excellent idea to have Tune Hotel opening within close proximity to KLIA2. I was supposed to take the 6:45 morning flight Kuala Lumpur to Brunei and taking a cab or public transport can be a huge hassle \u2013 especially since\u00a0 KLIA2 can be confusing for first timers, but once you get the hang of it \u2013 it\u2019s pretty easy. I find that the lift labels and signs DO CONFUSE people as I myself got really confused initially. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 I did all the research (and practical \u2013 imagine a confused food blogger running around in circles). How to ( directions to) get to KLIA2 Check In (baggage drop) Counter from Tune Hotel KLIA2 the FASTEST and QUICKEST WAY!\n\n\nImage taken from Tune Hotels website.\n\nHaving seen so many passengers sleeping on floors and hard benches in the KLIA2 \u2013 I think it\u2019s better to actually spend a night at Tune Hotels KLIA2 for a good rest as well as stress hassle free checking in \u2013 It\u2019s actually 5 minutes walk for me! For this post \u2013 I will show you the rooms as well as how to get to your baggage drop counter as quick as possible! You will use less than 10 minutes to reach the baggage drop \u2013 but expect long queues! MAKE SURE YOU WEB CHECK IN AND PRINT YOUR BOARDING PASS! This will save you tons of time!\n\n\n\n*Photo from Tune Hotels*\n\nThe lounge is pretty fancy as well \u2013 while you\u2019re waiting to check in or checking out ~ a good place to hang around with your ipad or laptops. Thankfully - You can check in to Air Asia flights and print your boarding pass at this very lounge! They have web check in machines kiosks here! So CONVENIENT!\n\n\nDSCF9813 (Medium)\n\nWalking from Tune Hotel to KLIA2 takes less than 10 minutes for me even while pushing a trolley. You will first see a lift that brings you to L1M \u2013 keep walking until you reach another lift. You will see this signboard (I took this when I\u2019m in level 2)\n\n\nDSCF9810 (Medium)\n\nNow \u2013 when I\u2019m in the lift \u2013 I want to look for level 3 which is departure hall \u2013 but there\u2019s no L3 (level 3) button?! Omg! What do I need to press? Many would try to press CP3 thinking it\u2019s L3 departure but it\u2019s NOT! DO NOT PRESS CP3. (I will explain where CP3 leads to later)\n\n\nDSCF9812 (Medium)\n\nInstead \u2013 press CP4 \u2013 which is the access to the Malls \u2013 technically that\u2019s L2 (Level 2). Get out of the lift \u2013 go out and turn right.\n\n\nDSCF9814 (Medium)\n\nYou should see a Baskin n Robbins when you turn right. Walk straight at that direction.\n\n\nDSCF9815 (Medium)\n\nYou will walk past Jaya Grocer (located on your right side) and also Guardian should you need some supplies.\n\n\nDSCF9816 (Medium)\n\nThe natural move is to take an escalator up to Level 3 as soon as you see it \u2013 but there\u2019s one problem\u2026\n\n\nDSCF9818 (Medium)\n\nNo trolleys allowed. If you' don\u2019t use trolleys \u2013 no problem \u2013 but OMG \u2013 What should I do now?! Don\u2019t panic \u2013 there\u2019s a lift!\n\n\nDSCF9819 (Medium)\n\nBehind HOMETOWN Hainan Coffee \u2013 there\u2019s actually a lift for you to go to Level 3\n\n\nDSCF9820 (Medium)\n\nYou should see this and then turn left ~\n\n\nDSCF9821 (Medium)\n\nLift spotted! Hurray!\n\n\nDSCF9822 (Medium)\n\nGo to Level 3!\n\n\nDSCF9823 (Medium)\n\nWalk towards the direction of Nandos ~~ do not be tempted to go in \u2013 go straight to drop your luggage first! Walk past Nandos \u2013 yes I know the chicken smells fantastic but you can eat after you drop your luggage!\n\n\nDSCF9824 (Medium)\n\nWalk out of the Mall section of Level 3 \u2013 Straight after you walk past Nandos.\n\n\nDSCF9825 (Medium)\n\nThen you will enter departure hall! That was easy wasn\u2019t it?\n\n\nDSCF9826 (Medium)\n\nWalk straight in and you should see this counter KLIA2. I actually asked them plenty of questions and yes- if you haven\u2019t print your boarding pass yet or haven\u2019t web check in \u2013 you\u2019re in for a rough ride!\n\n\nDSCF9827 (Medium)\n\nTurn LEFT and go towards U or V lanes \u2013 where you can check in and drop your baggage. Despite arriving at 4am in the early morning \u2013 I still needed to queue for 30 minutes before I manage to drop my luggage.\n\n\nDSCF9828 (Medium)\n\nU or V lanes are the ones for Baggage Drop for International. You\u2019ve now reached your destination! It took me around 7 minutes from Tune Hotel KLIA2 to reach here \u2013 with a huge trolley. If you have elderly or physically disabled passengers (or passengers who spent too much time shopping and their legs hurt like crap)\u00a0 with you, it might take a slightly longer time.\n\n\nDSCF9829 (Medium)\n\nBut what about those who took the taxi? Well \u2013 you should be at Level 3 when they drop you off \u2013 so just keep walking straight past all the shops \u2013 exit the mall level 3 and you should reach departure hall \u2013 turn left and go straight to U and V to drop off your luggage!\n\n\nDSCF9830 (Medium)\n\nI also need to highly recommend the KLIA Ekspres Train \u2013 I took it from Airport to KL Sentral and it only cost RM35 and less than 35 minutes to reach KL Sentral station. A good idea if you want to avoid the stressful traffic jams of Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\nDSCF9831 (Medium)\n\nNow if you\u2019re in KLIA2 and you needed to wait long hours for transit and you decided to stay in Tune Hotels KLIA2. Well just walk past Jaya Grocer and turn left towards the lift and press \u2026. CP3 (yes \u2013 CP3 leads to Tune hotels) As soon as you see this sign \u2013 you\u2019re on the right track!\n\n\nImage taken from Tune Hotels website. They have plenty of parking space as well with reasonable parking rates. Please check their website for more information.\n\n\n20140601_091052 (Medium)\n\nTook this from their in flight magazine and I have to agree \u2013 why sleep on the hard bench or stress yourself out when you can just stay in Tune Hotels \u2013 have a nice shower and sleep in a very comfortable bed \u2013 within 5-10 minutes walk to the baggage drop counter!\n\n\nDSCF9977 (Medium)\n\nTheir Tune Hotel KLIA2 Lobby and Reception. Quite a lot of sofas, chairs for guests to sit while waiting.\n\n\nDSCF9832 (Medium)\n\nEntering my room \u2013 I got a room far from the lift.\n\n\nDSCF9833 (Medium)\n\nSpacious and comfortable!\n\n\nDSCF9834 (Medium)\n\nAnother angle \u2013 Doesn\u2019t that make you wanna snooze already?\n\n\nDSCF9844 (Medium)\n\nA nice desk for you to put your make up kits, laptops to update your work or blog\/instagram. Pretty convenient \u2013 with the sockets there.\n\n\nDSCF9836 (Medium)\n\nToilet ~~ cosy and just the nice space.\n\n\nDSCF9837 (Medium)\n\nStrong warm shower for one \u2013 or two if you are supermodel thin.\n\n\nDSCF9841 (Medium)\n\nTune Hotels KLIA2 was having a function to launch the grand opening that day and this is the view from my window.\n\n\nDSCF9892 (Medium)\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of their WonderKafe restaurant \u2013 where you can enjoy a good meal while meeting new travellers! Or you can just walk 5 minutes to KLIA2 for a wide variety and range of dining and shopping options. I hope this guide would be very useful for guests staying in the hotel or those who are planning their trips in Kuala Lumpur!\n\nNo comments :\n\nPost a Comment",

Research on the organization you will be working with \u2013 background checking is important before partnering with them. Is there an available translator for easier communication?\n\nResearch the country you are visiting.\nKnow all the issues it faces. Read so you will have a grasp of their unique culture. You don\u2019t want to be stepping on their norms and end up being rude and disrespectful. Get in touch with previous volunteers- they can give you first hand feedback.\n\nSee if your skills are good fit.\nAlways gauge whether your skills match the needs of the project and the community. This ensures you will be productive and the community will benefit from your stay. Keep in mind that not all projects require skills \u2013 the benefit you may be bringing is the funding to get a need met, such as a house for a needy family.\n\nGet out there and get dirty.\nShake it! Let loose. Get out of your comfort zone and reach out! Take time to interact with and get to know the locals you are working with, hear their stories, gain insights into their lives. Immerse yourself in the richness and uniqueness of the culture. You can learn from them.\n\nGive even more.\nIt\u2019s amazing to help alongside with the locals, but donating money beyond the funds needed for your project helps do even more good.\n\nThe Don\u2019ts\n\nDon\u2019t assume you already know it all.\nNo, you don\u2019t. Learn thoroughly before you begin embarking on the project. Learn how to use the hammer, saw, all the tools before starting on your building project.\n\nDon\u2019t just give away things.\nGiving things away may encourage begging, and providing a community with things without involving them can foster dependency. It is fantastic to bring items for donation, but give them to your partner organization so they can distribute them properly (and ask them for what it is best to bring).\n\nA voluntourism trip can be a bit daunting. We can make it easy for you. If you are looking for a luxury family voluntourism vacation, let us handle it for you. Email us at [email\u00a0protected]",

        "text":"Your Travel Expert: Raphael Meese\n0044 808 189 0178\n  \u2022 9:00 am - 5:00 pm (Monday - Friday)\nOpening hours\n\nGerman bank holidays are excluded.\n\n\nCamping with children: Tips for a family vacation with a camper van\n\nA family trip doesn't have to take you far away to be a unique experience: For many children, travelling in an RV and then going camping is a real adventure. With the right planning and equipment, camping with a child is guaranteed to be a highlight. To ensure that your camping experience becomes an unforgettable one, we have collected the most important tips and information about camper trips with children.\n\nWhy is camping ideal for families?\n\nFrom the thoroughly organized package vacation to the flexible camping trip, all family trips have a few things in common: lots of preparation, lots of packing, often a long journey and, of course, the relief of finally getting there. However, when compared with hotels or vacation apartments, camping has some clear advantages:\n\nYou are more flexible when camping:\n\nPack your bags, load up your camper and off you go! On a camping trip, you decide how you want to spend your RV vacation and at what pace you want to travel - both on the road and when planning your day. Which region do you want to visit? Which campsite has the best activities for children? What do you want to do during the day? You decide freely and without constraint.\n\nCamping is cosy:\n\nWhen you arrive, you can take a rest right away and don't have to make the long journey to the hotel or flat or settle into a strange hotel room. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave; you'll always have everything you need at your fingertips. You feel at home in a camper and it\u2019s easier to keep to your usual routines, which is important for small children.\n\nYou'll never be bored:\n\nFor children, there is plenty to explore at a campsite and plenty of space to run around. The experience is rounded off by leisure activities on and around the campsite, which you can discover together. These could be adventure playgrounds, hiking trails, beaches, or animal parks, for example.\n\nIf you plan to split your trip between different locations or campsites, you shouldn\u2019t change locations too often. A stay of several days at a child-friendly campsite allows children to settle and make friends.\n\nCamping is pure nature:\n\nDepending on where you go camping, you can experience nature in a whole new way. Especially for families living in the city, being close to nature is a great change of pace and helps you forget the stress of everyday life. For children, time in nature is precious \u2013 they can let off steam and get to know and understand the natural environment a little better.\n\nTip: On camper trips, children are likely to go on adventures and get a little dirty. It's best not to pack their finest clothes.\n\nCamper trips are cheaper:\n\nWhen it comes to family vacations, costs also play a role. Compared to a vacation apartment or a room in a resort, staying at a campsite is cheaper. Depending on the area and season, the costs differ slightly, of course, but they are much cheaper than all-inclusive packages with the whole family. However, fuel and food should not be forgotten when calculating costs.\n\nTo enjoy camping with children, you don't necessarily have to buy an RV or campervan. After all, the costs of a new vehicle can be high. Renting is a good idea, especially if you are new to camping and just want to try it out. All you need is the essentials for the little ones (e.g. child seat or booster seat).\n\nHow do you recognize a child-friendly campsite?\n\nTo ensure that your camping trip is enjoyable for the whole family, it is best to visit a campsite that is suitable for children. You can be sure that your children will enjoy their vacation and that other campers won't feel disturbed by the extra noises from playing children.\n\nCamping sites for children: facilities and offers\n\nCampsites for children offer a variety of activities and the entire layout of the campsite will be more friendly for families and children. Read on to find out which facilities a child-friendly campsite should have:\n\n  \u2022 The campsite should be spacious, with enough open areas for safe playing.\n\n  \u2022 There should be a family bathroom on the site with low washbasins, children's toilets, and baby changing facilities.\n\n  \u2022 Shopping facilities should be available close to the campsite that sells baby items.\n\n  \u2022 A child-friendly campsite should offer playgrounds, children's entertainment, and\/or recreation buildings for playing in bad weather.\n\n  \u2022 Snack bars or restaurants should offer children meals. They should have play areas or something to do for the kids and baby high chairs available.\n\nTip: If possible, look for a campsite that offers sufficient shade. Children shouldn\u2019t be constantly in the blazing sun; additional sun protection is essential. It is also easier to fall asleep at night if the campervan is not too hot.\n\nSafe campsites for children\n\nA campsite for children should have various safety features to ensure that nothing happens to the little ones while they are playing and romping around:\n\n  \u2022 The site must be securely fenced off.\n\n  \u2022 Playgrounds and play areas should be easily visible so that parents can keep an eye on their children.\n\n  \u2022 The paths should be well laid out. On larger playgrounds, site plans and signposts should be marked with picture maps to give an overview.\n\n  \u2022 There shouldn\u2019t be any busy roads too close.\n\n  \u2022 At night, the campsite should be well lit.\n\n  \u2022 Possible danger areas (e.g. ponds, pits, etc.) should be fenced.\n\n  \u2022 If the campsite is located by a lake or the sea, access to the water should be fenced. This also applies to pools and swimming pools.\n\n  \u2022 First aid equipment should be available along with an emergency medical service.\n\n  \u2022 The reception is staffed all day. During closing times, staff should be reachable by phone.\n\n  \u2022 Emergency plans with important telephone numbers and numbers of the local doctors should be clearly visible.\n\nA safer alternative is car-free campsites, where driving on the site is only allowed on arrival and departure. This allows children to play safely on-site.\n\nCamping with children: Leisure activities at the campsite\n\nThe number of leisure activities available at child-friendly campsites can vary from site to site. It's up to you whether you're looking for a campsite where your children can run around freely, or whether you want entertainment programs or even supervision.\n\nVaried leisure activities around the campsite\n\nTo make sure the little ones don't get bored, there should be various leisure activities on the campsite and in the vicinity. Look out for the following activities and attractions:\n\n  \u2022 Age-appropriate playgrounds, such as playgrounds and slides for younger children and adventure playgrounds for older children.\n\n  \u2022 Swimming facilities, e.g. swimming lakes with shallow entrances or alternatively, adventure pools.\n\n  \u2022 Climbing forests.\n\n  \u2022 Adventure and nature trails.\n\n  \u2022 Children's museums with interactive exhibitions or hands-on activities.\n\n  \u2022 Workshops for children, e.g. dance or painting classes.\n\n  \u2022 Animal parks, aquariums, or petting zoos.\n\n  \u2022 Bike or boat rentals.\n\n  \u2022 Sports fields, e.g. for soccer or volleyball.\n\nTips for planning each day when camping with children\n\nParents usually crave relaxation while on vacation, while children tend to want the opposite. To find the perfect balance for your trip, you can use the following tips as a guide:\n\n  \u2022 Look for age-appropriate activities. While the little ones can play in a slide park or on a water playground, older children might have more fun letting off steam in a ropes course, boating, or on the sports field.\n\n  \u2022 If you have children of different ages or with very different interests, the campsite environment should have something for everyone.\n\n  \u2022 Don't plan too many activities each day. One or two activities a day are enough for young and old to enjoy their time together.\n\n  \u2022 Don't let rainy days spoil your mood by finding suitable indoor activities as alternatives. These can be indoor games as well as indoor attractions.\n\nLarger campsites usually offer a more extensive activity program and more leisure activities, but they are also more confusing. At a smaller campsite, you can keep a closer eye on your children, but the leisure activities are often more limited and may require more day trips to keep them occupied.\n\nSummary: Camping with children made easy\n\nTaking a break from daily life in the fresh air, making new friends, sleeping in a campervan - for children of all ages, camper trips are a unique experience and a true adventure. For families who long for a vacation close to nature, to be more flexible, and looking for a change from more expensive and crowded resorts, camping is just the thing. To make sure everyone feels at home, you should look for a child-friendly campsite with exciting leisure activities. As campsites are becoming an increasingly popular vacation destination, it's a good idea to start looking early and book a place. That way, your next camping trip is guaranteed to be an unforgettable experience.",

        "text":"Getting More For Less Every Time You Travel\n\nAlthough intended to be a leisurely and relaxing activity, travel can sometimes be unnecessarily stressful and fraught with disaster. A vacation that is not carefully planned can be disastrous. To reap the benefits when you travel next, continue on for solid tips below.\n\nIt is important to keep a photograph of your child on you, in case they wander away. It can be terrifying to lose your son or daughter. However, in case it happens, you should be prepared. Having a photo you can show people immediately if the child becomes lost could wind up making a substantial difference in getting them back quickly.\n\nDo not expect an airline to cater to your whims when you are flying. Provide your own blanket and pillow if you know that you will have a requirement for them, your own headphones too. You should also pack snacks to ensure that you won\u2019t go hungry if you do not like what the airline offers.\n\nAlarm Clock\n\nCheck your hotel alarm clock. Whether by simple accident or obnoxious prank, many a traveler has been awakened early in the morning or worse, in the middle of the night, by the alarm clock at their bedside. To be sure you can rest, check that the alarm is either off or set to the time in which you want to wake up.\n\nMake sure there is someone close to who you can get hold of your itinerary. This way, your loved one knows where you always are. Also, stay in touch with that person for safety\u2019s sake. Nobody will have to worry if you keep in touch.\n\nThese products are overpriced and the space saved is not worth it. Instead, try to pack clothes in a manner such that they utilize the available space efficiently. These techniques will help you create additional space in your bag.\n\nCookie Sheets\n\nWhen taking a long trip with kids, take along some cookie sheets. These cookie sheets can be a flat surface to put cards or coloring books on. They also work great in tandem with bright magnetic numbers and letters.\n\nUse environmentally responsible services if you would like to take an eco-friendly trip. There are now many hotels that use linen reuse programs, have energy efficient lighting, have recycling bins that guests can use, and have low flow plumbing. Even restaurants and transportation can be green.\n\nGoing online when making your vacation plans is the easiest and most cost effective way to get what you want. Using travel sites will greatly assist you in planning your travel destinations without using a lot of unwanted effort on your part. You are able to reserve hotels, rental cars, and flights online. Reviews of hotels with pictures are instantly available. Travel websites also offer good deals in planning your trip, as well as discounts on last minute travel.\n\nJet Lag\n\nStaying awake until about 8pm in local time will help you to adjust better in the new time zone. Resist the urge to fall asleep too early because this will only prolong the disorientation of jet lag. You will overcome jet lag fast if you help your body quickly adjust to the time zone changes.\n\nTraveling by car can become boring; so, you may need to plan activities for the trip. Anticipating some fun activities during the trip breaks up the trip\u2019s monotony with much more than the usual meal and bathroom breaks. Show your kids the itinerary so that they anticipate each destination on the way to your main vacation.\n\nIf you sleep light, try using some earplugs. Hotel walls are not that great for sleeping. Investing in a decent pair of earplugs can really help you get a good night of sleep.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to another country, make up some cards that state any food allergies that you have in the language of the country you are visiting. If you have special dietary restrictions, tell your server and ask for recommendations. Cards help ensure that your dining experiences are positive ones.\n\nAlways request a room that is up at least two or three flights. Bottom and ground floor rooms are more accessible to potential thieves. Be sure to also ask for quarters which do not have sliding doors. These large, glass doors are extremely easy to break into.\n\nYou can often go without luggage when traveling by air. You can save lots of time and avoid unnecessary trouble. Instead, send your belongings, via FedEx or UPS, to your travel destination. This suggestion will probably cost more; however, it saves on lost luggage.\n\nOne travel nugget is to ensure that the alarm clock in your hotel room works before you go to sleep. Without checking, you don\u2019t know if the alarm has been set, and you don\u2019t want any surprises.\n\nIf you want to hit the ground running on your next vacation, be sure to take some of the local currency with you. In some countries, getting currency changed outside of business hours can be difficult. Almost all large banks sell foreign currency, so before going to the airport, make a quick run to the bank.\n\nAlthough travel is supposed to be a relaxing experience, if you aren\u2019t fully aware of simple tricks to follow, it can be quite the opposite. By implementing the advice found here, you are likely to find your next trip more pleasant.",

        "text":"\n  \u2022 The Torote Bowl is known for its stand of elephant trees, a plant native to Baja but rare in California.\n  \u2022 Story alerts\n  \u2022 Letter to Editor\n  \u2022 Pin it\n\nThe present Bow Willow Campground was the site of a large seasonal Kumeyaay village. Many trails radiate out from the campground area, making it a choice staging area for adventure. One trail heads into the Laguna Mountains while another leads to a historic rock house, a remnant of when cattlemen roamed these hills. Still another trail, the one described here, leads to the beautiful palm oases at Mountain Palm Springs. En route, there is an opportunity to visit the elephant tree \u201dforest\u201d at Torote Bowl, with its dramatic views east to the Carrizo Badlands and marsh.\n\nStart walking northwest from the campground, crossing the wide, sandy Bow Willow Creek wash. Look for weathered 4\u02ddx4\u02dd posts with yellow tops that mark the trail. An unpainted sign identifies this as the Mountain Palm Springs Trail, and a sign about 0.3 mile from the campground marks the direction for the Southwest Grove and the Torote Bowl. While crossing the 0.7 mile-wide Bow Willow Creek wash, note the widely spaced desert willow, mesquite, smoke, and ironwood trees, which may be in bloom. If the rains have been favorable, there also may be a carpet of colorful annual wildflowers that could include purple mat, desert phacelia, Bigelow\u2019s monkeyflower, chia, and bajada lupine. The trail proceeds up the hillside on the north side of the wash, opening up some grand vistas as you gain elevation. At a fork in the trail, take the left branch to proceed to Torote Bowl, about half a mile ahead.\n\nThe Torote Bowl is the upper end of an unnamed canyon and is home to at least 15 large (for an elephant tree) torote, as the elephant tree is known in Spanish. Although rare in the United States, the elephant tree (Bursera microphylla) is common in Baja California. This is one of the largest concentrated \u201cherds\u201d of elephant trees in the Anza-Borrego area and is well worth the hike to view this unusual plant that has a swollen truck reminiscent of its namesake.\n\nThe view from Torote Bowl out to the Carrizo Badlands and marsh is not to be missed and is another reason to take this short side-trip. After examining the elephant trees and taking in the view, return to the trail junction and take the signed trail to the Southwest Grove of palms in Mountain Palm Springs, 1.9 miles from Bow Willow. This large well-watered palm grove offers shade and a cool respite from the desert sun.\n\nAt this point, there are two options. Either head back the same way for a slightly less than 4 miles out-and-back hike, or take the well-worn trail east from the Southwest Grove toward the Mountain Palm Springs primitive campground for more adventure. There are six major palm groves in the Mountain Palm Springs area plus many other scattered palms wherever water nears the surface, opening up many opportunities for further exploration. However, the route described here assumes further exploration will be left for another day.\n\nTo head back to Bow Willow Campground, find a well-used but unsigned trail leading south up a small gully shortly before arriving at the Mountain Palm Springs trailhead parking area. Following this trail requires close attention, but it is marked with frequent ducks, and it is easy walking through the Sonoran scrub. If the trail is lost, just keep walking west-southwest until Bow Willow Campground comes into view.\n\n  \u2022 Distance from downtown San Diego: 106 miles. Allow 2 hours (Anza-Borrego Desert State Park). From CA-163N take I-8E, exiting on the Imperial Hwy at Ocotillo, after 88 miles. Turn north on SR-2 (Imperial Hwy), and drive 16.5 miles to milepost 48 and look for a turnoff on the left (west) for Bow Willow Campground (signed). Drive 1.6 miles to the campground. There is a charge for overnight use of one of the 16 campsites at the Bow Willow Campground but not for day-use. Drinking water sometimes is available, but it was not in the Fall-Winter of 2013\u2013\u201914. Bring your own water in case. Continue to the western-most campsites and park.\n  \u2022 Hiking length: 4-mile loop.\n  \u2022 Difficulty: Moderately easy, mostly over well-marked trails, though the last 0.5 mile may require some simple route finding. Elevation gain\/loss 400 feet. Trekking poles can provide some stability on steep portions of the trail. Carry plenty of water.\n  \u2022 Story alerts\n  \u2022 Letter to Editor\n  \u2022 Pin it\n\n\nSign in to comment\n\nJoin our newsletter list for\n$5 off your next purchase\non our daily deal site,",

And we happen to know how to throw a great party, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning a Charleston wedding with bridal party activities, we\u2019ve got a few ideas on how to make your special week even more memorable.\u00a0\n\n\nCharleston Wedding Bridal Party Tips\n\nPlanning a Charleston wedding bridal party? We\u2019ve got a few tips that should help you make your special week an unforgettable event.\u00a0\n\n\nCheck the Weather\n\nCharleston is known for its temperate weather. We don\u2019t experience harsh winters, and we enjoy some pretty mild temperatures in the spring and fall.\n\nYet, the weather here (like in many parts of the U.S.) can be quite fickle, too. We\u2019ve been known to get hit with a rainstorm (or even hurricanes in the fall). Before planning your bridal party activities (or your Charleston wedding), we recommend checking out what to expect in the Holy City in every season.\n\nOur What to Pack Before Visiting Charleston guide will help you decide which month to visit (and how to plan for any unexpected weather during your trip).\u00a0\n\n\nPlan Ahead\n\nHere in the South, we tend to go with the flow. We love visitors and are famously accommodating. But there\u2019s only so much we can do to ensure we\u2019re accommodating to every guest that enters our fair city.\n\nCharleston is a pretty popular city in the spring and fall. And though we experience hotter temperatures in the summer, June, July, and August are also pretty popular months to visit.\n\nWe recommend making reservations whenever possible \u2014 especially if your bridal party is large. This goes for tours, boat rides, restaurants, and more.\u00a0\n\n\nExpect the Unexpected\n\nWe get it: you want your bridal week to be the most exciting, fun-packed week of your life. But the magical thing about the Holy City is that this is a place where you can (and should) expect the unexpected.\n\nWe can\u2019t tell you how many times travelers walking to their dinner reservation suddenly turn on a side street \u2014 only to find the most enchanting garden courtyard. Or, stumble across our famous pineapple fountain.\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t over-plan your bridal party week. Allow yourself some time to soak it all in and enjoy the romance of Charleston.\n\n\nCharleston Weddings: Bridal Party Activities\n\nCharleston feels like it was practically made for weddings and bridal party activities. Not only are we one of the most romantic cities in the U.S., but we\u2019re known for being home to some of the prettiest streets, gorgeous water views, and stunning sunsets, too.\n\n\nGuided Tours\n\na group of people walking down the street in front of a building\n\nSure, you could meander through the city on your own \u2014 but then you might miss out on some of Charleston\u2019s prettiest streets!\n\nA guided tour of Charleston will give you the lay of the land while entertaining and informing your group. You\u2019ll see some sights you might otherwise miss, and you\u2019ll learn a little about the history of the Holy City.\n\nWalks of Charleston offers two public tours, our History Tour and Passages and Alleyways. But if you\u2019re booking for a larger group, we can also coordinate a private tour for you, too. Just some of the private tours we offer include day trips to Savannah, plantation tours, and more.\u00a0\n\n\nHorse and Carriage Rides\n\na man riding a horse drawn carriage on a city street\n\nWhat\u2019s more romantic than a horse and carriage ride? We get it, you\u2019re probably not thinking too much about romance for your bridal party (after all, the romance is supposed to be for you and your significant other, right?).\u00a0\n\nBut horse and carriage rides will help you see the city (as well as some of its main sights) \u2014 and it will help you do so in style.\n\nAnd because this week is supposed to be about you and your partner spending time with friends and family, why not book a horse and carriage ride for a small group? Our partner, the Carolina Carriage and Polo Co., has a fleet of carriages that can accommodate groups of up to 16 passengers at a time.\u00a0\n\n\nBoat Rides\n\nWe recommend spending plenty of time out on the water while you\u2019re here in Charleston. It\u2019s one of the best ways to see the city.\u00a0\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of ways to charter a boat and sail into the sunset in Charleston. If your bridal party is all about the fun, we recommend booking a brews cruise. If you\u2019re the type of group that\u2019s more into elegant romance, we recommend booking a sunset sail.\n\n\nBrews Cruise\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance if you\u2019re here with your bridal party, you\u2019re here to have fun.\u00a0\n\nOur partner Charleston Brews Cruise won\u2019t get you out on the water, but you will cruise past a few of Charleston\u2019s most popular breweries on an unforgettable tour.\n\nOr, head out on the water (if you don\u2019t mind a little bit of exercise) for a Saltwater Cycle tour. This tour allows you to power a boat using only your feet (and a little liquid courage).\u00a0\n\n\nSunset Sail\n\nIf your wedding party is more into sophisticated fun than beer and paddle boats, we recommend checking out Schooner Pride.\n\nSail under the Ravenel Bridge and check out the sights of the city \u2014 afternoon, evening, or night. Schooner Pride offers three tours (day, sunset, and night) and is one of the top-rated boat tours in Charleston.\n\nThe daytime tour focuses more on the local sea life (including dolphin watching!) while the sunset and nighttime tours are all about the ambiance.\u00a0\n\n\nCharleston Food\n\nAt some point, you\u2019ll inevitably get hungry. And when that happens, Charleston has got you covered.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve got plenty of good eats \u2014 some of which you can only find here in the Holy City! While your bridal party is in town, you\u2019ve just got to try some of our iconic foods.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the city\u2019s famous shrimp and grits, the Historic Charleston City Market, and some of our popular rooftop bars. Can\u2019t decide on where to eat? Book a Charleston food tour to familiarize yourself with lowcountry food.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Posted in:",

Glancing over it, you will see that certain preparations are needed to be made well before the date that you and your spouse leave for your honeymoon.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to start planning for your honeymoon well in advance. Six to twelve months is the norm for going over plans with your loved one about where exactly to spend your honeymoon. If going overseas or to another country, a passport will be needed, so keep that in mind. Later on, you\u2019ll need to prepare reservations and travel insurance for your journey. Learning about cell phone use is also very necessary in this type of situation, and you must discover how high roaming charges might be.\n\nShortly before departing, make sure to pack anything that might be needed, but make smart decisions as to not slow yourself down with too much luggage. Remember to double-check for your travel documents and tickets before leaving.\n\nWith Checklist Template\u2019s Honeymoon Planning Checklist, you\u2019re sure to be ready for the big getaway. \u00a0The checklist is very simple and straightforward and will help to make preparations easier in the long run.\n\nDownload:\u00a0Honeymoon Planning Checklist\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"How to Camp in Elysian, Minnesota\n\nTrent Jonas, Leaf Group\n\nTucked onto an isthmus between lakes Francis and Elysian, the 580-resident town of Elysian, in south-central Minnesota, is a jumping-off point for outdoor adventure. Surrounded by several large and small lakes and directly on the 39-mile Sakatah Singing Hills Trail, Elysian attracts visitors year-round for hiking, fishing, boating, skiing and camping.\n\nStep 1\n\nPlan your trip. Decide how long you will be going and what type of gear you will need. Are you going to fish in Lake Elysian, or hike the Sakatah Trail? Determine what activities you will be doing, how many meals you plan to cook and the type of shelter you will be using, tent or RV.\n\nStep 2\n\nMake a reservation. While some campgrounds offer walk-in sites, it is better to plan ahead. Three campgrounds are in Elysian, all privately owned. Just steps from Lake Elysian's northern shoreline, Clarke's Campground (no website; 915 State Highway 60, Elysian; 507-267-4310), The Pit Stop Campground (no website; 205 E. Highway 60, Elysian; 507-267-4560) and Silver's Resort (no website; 108 S. First St., Elysian; 507-267-4694) all have camping facilities within the limits of Elysian.\n\nStep 3\n\nGet ready to camp. Ready your RV, or make sure your tent has all its stakes and posts. Pack enough food for your stay. Minnesota nights can be cold even in July, so plan accordingly with respect to clothing, sleeping bags and heating fuel --- whether it's wood for a fire or propane for your heater. Don't forget matches and a flashlight.\n\nStep 4\n\nGet to Elysian. From the Twin Cities, take Interstate 35 south to Faribault and Highway 60 west to Elysian. From Rochester, take Highway 14 west to Janesville, then head north on East Elysian Lake Road.",

        "text":"Cordillera Blanca (Per\u00fa)\npractical hints\n\n1. Peru in general\n\n1.1. Country, Geography\n\nWith 1.2 million km2, Per\u00fa is South America's third largest country. Out of the 28 million inhabitants, 8 millions live in the urban area of Lima. Geographically, Peru is divided into three different climatic regions: Cordillera Blanca is Peru's highest mountain range, it is situated about 400 km north of Lima.\n\n1.2. Weather\n\nIn south winter (May - November), the weather of the coastal region is foggy and cold (daily maximum of 20\u00b0C). The sun returns not before November. In the mountains, winter is the dry season, mostly offering good weather for mountaineering. Best time is May to September, in the beginning there can be a lot of snow in high regions. Towards end of the seasons the snow coverage of the glaciers disappears, and crossing the very ragged glaciers can be difficult. Short bad weather times last only one or two days, after that it normally becomes sunny again.\n\n1.3. Language\n\nOfficial languages are Spanish, Quechua, and Aymar\u00e1. Escpecially on the countryside frequently the old languages Quechua (in the north) and Aymar\u00e1 (in the south) are spoken, so Spanish is a first \"foreign\" language for the local population. English knowledge is not very widespread, therefore a basic knowledge of Spanish is recommended. Unlike in Chile or Argentina, the pronunciation is accentuated relatively clearly.\n\n1.4. Money\n\nPeru's currency is the Nuevo Sol (S\/); the exchange rate in June 2008 was about 3 Soles per US$, and 4.15 Soles per Euro (when changing cash). The rate for withdrawals from our German bank account was about 4.55 S\/ per Euro. While bus tickets can be booked via internet without problems, especially smaller trekking agencies accept only cash. The ATMs in Huaraz worked without problems with the (Maestro) ec card; we could not get any money at the ATM using our credit card (German Mastercard). Many things can be payed directly in US$, and the ATMs offer a choice of withdrawing Soles or Dollars.\n\n1.5. Traffic\n\nCar drivers are exclusively oriented in forward direction. The priority is proceeding as fast as possible, using any possibly existing space. Pedestrians are not respected except in order to avoid collisions. Everybody tries to draw attention to his car by blowing the horn as loud and often as possible. It is clear that traffic lanes or pedestrian crossings are understood as no more than a suggestion. The driving style in Huaraz was much more moderate than in Lima, where colectivos push through the dense traffic at distances of only few centimeters at high speed.\nBesides care of cars turning off, pedestrians should also - like elsewhere in south America - watch for sometimes not covered holes or gullies along the sidewalk. Except for the main roads, only few roads are paved, and many mountain roads are in adventurous conditions.\n\n1.6. Flights\n\nFrom Europe, there are flights either via the U.S.A. or (more or less) directly to South America. Flying via U.S.A. has the advantage of a higher baggage allowance. Disadvantage of every trip via U.S. is that U.S. American airports (as the only ones in the world!) have no international section - this means one has to enter the U.S.A. even if one doesn't want to visit this nation. The long waiting times at passport controls and the time-consuming check-out and check-in again of all baggage can easily make you miss your connecting flight. Even if you catch it, you don't know if the baggage did it, too.\nAfter the experience of our flight to Ecuador five years ago we preferred to spend a little more money and take a direct flight from Amsterdam.\n\n2. Lima\n\nPer\u00fa's capital Lima is situated in a plain close to the mountains, at the coast. The plain does not directly extend to the beach, there is a 100 meter high cliff at the sea. The colonial old center is in the north of the urban area at R\u00edo Rimac, the touristic center around Miraflores is 10 km further south. A large arterial street connects these parts of the city, but currently (as in almost all other roads, too) road construction is going on there leading to lots of diversions (but they are well marked). The airport is situated about 10 km northwest of the old center.\nAs far as the level of crime is concerned, Lima seems comparable to other citys of this size. We never felt insecure anywhere.\nFrom Miraflores to the colonial center, use the colectivos NM38 \"B\". From the center to Miraflores: NM38 \"A\" and SO26 (the latter goes to Larcomar). Fare is S\/ 1 to 1.40.\n\n3. Huaraz \/ Cordillera Blanca\n\n3.1. Geography\n\nHuaraz (3100 m) is the capital of the region Ancash, the town as about 100000 inhabitants and is situated on the valley of R\u00edo Santa (Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas), which runs in north-south-direction parallel to the coast. The valley separates two mountain ranges: In the west the Cordillera Negra, which reaches about 5000 m and showing no glaciers, and in the east the Cordillera Blanca, which is strongly covered by glaciers and contains many 6000 m peaks. The Cordillera Blanca here also is the continental divide to the Amazonas region with the Amazonas headstream Mara\u00f1on. The small distance to the humid Amazonas basin also explains the strong glacier coverage; in south summer there is an intense rain period which delivers the snow in the high altitude. A characteristic feature of Cordillera Blanca are very steeply cut valleys with canyon-like entrances, probably formed by ice-age glaciers.\n\n3.2. Bus trip to Huaraz\n\nFrom Lima one can use different operators to cover the about 470 km distance to Huaraz. The trip takes about 7-8 hours; the first two hours are on a good road along the coast, then the road slowly climbs up to Conococha Pass (4080 m). The upper part of this section has a lot of potholes. From Conococha the road slowly leads down to 40 km distant Huaraz, the road is better again.\nOne can choose cama (sleeper), semicama (a reasonable amount of space for sleeping), and econ\u00f3mico (normal seats); the names of the classes are different between the bus companies. Each company operates its own bus terminal at its destination towns, making things rather confusing. This makes a comparison of the rates difficult. Unlike in e.g. Argentina, in Lima or Huaraz there is no central bus terminal, therefore any infrastructure (baggage checkroom, shopping centers, restaurants etc.) is only very limited in the company-owned terminals.\nBuses leave at 10 p.m. (arriving next morning very early), or also in the morning. Some companies have morning departures only in high season. We went to Huaraz with Cruz del Sur, and back with Moviltours. The tire problems on the way back was possibly just bad luck.\n\n3.3. Hotels, restaurants in Huaraz\n\nIn Huaraz there is plenty of accomodation. We did not book anything in advance and just followed the first offer of an agent in the bus terminal. The hostal (Albergue Ishinca) was about 1.2 km away from the center, but at a rate of S\/. 30 per night for a double room rather cheap, very clean and quiet. For another S\/ 15 also breakfast was offered.\nGood restaurants are found mainly around the Plaza de Armas, and along Calle Luzuriaga (the main street west of the Plaza). A good meal for two persons including beverages was about 35 to 60 Soles. Typical dishes are lomo (filet) or bistec (beefsteak) with papas fritas and ensalada; lomo saltado (meat cut into small pieces with onions, tomatoes and french fries); pollo (chicken); Original Peruvian dishes are cuy (guinea pig), cebiche (raw fish cut into pieces, marinated in lime juice, with onions). caldo de gallina (chicken soup). \"A lo pobre\" is, by the way, not paltry but with egg, banana and rice in addition to french fries and salad.\n\n3.4. Bus\/Taxi in and around Huaraz, access to the mountains\n\nA taxi drive within Huaraz costs S\/ 2.50 to 3.\nWe booked the transport to the mountains as \"transporte privado\" (sometimes the package included the pack-animals); a normal taxi was sufficient to read the destinations. Except for the paved main road through the Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas, all roads are in a more or less bad state, so it tooks some time to get there. Fares: Laguna Llaca (bring and pick up) US$ 140, Collon\/Pashpa (bring and pick up) US$ 100, Cebollapampa (only one way) US$ 70.\nThe colectivo from Yungay to Huaraz costs S\/ 3.50 per person.\n\n3.5. other sports activities (except mountaineering)\n\nIn Huaraz one can rent mountain bikes (ca. 40 S\/ per day), they are - on the whole - functioning. However one won't wish to go by bike for more than two days, since the main road is not nice to use due to the heavy traffic. Cars always got an advantage over bikers or pedestrians, because the stronger always prevails. The (unpaved) mountain roads are sometimes in adventurous conditions; some decent sections are the roads from Wilkahuain (north of Huaraz) to the Quebradas Llaca, Cojup, and Quilcayhuanca. The dogs in the countryside are - similar to Ecuador - a nuisance, they always try to catch bikers' legs.\n\nAt Mirador de Rataquena one easily meets some joggers, even if the 300 height meters from downtown to the viewpoint are rather mountain running than jogging.\n\nThose who prefer water might want to visit the Termas de Monterrey (about 6 km north of Huaraz). The 25 meter basin is not really a sood sports location, but the water has a unique color (light brown). It is said to help against all sorts of health problems.\n\n4. Mountaineering in the Cordillera Blanca\n\n4.1. Parque Nacional Huascar\u00e1n\n\nThe Parque Nacional Huascar\u00e1n comprises the complete Cordillera Blanca above about 4000 meters from Nevados Milluacocha and Pilanco in the north of Quebrada de los Cedros\/Quebrada Alpamayo, and Conococha in the south. In order to enter the park, a ticket is needed which is issues either in the office of the park administration in Huaraz (near Plaza Bel\u00e9n) or at the control posts.\nThe terms of use say that for all activities that are considered \"dangerous\" (like mountaineering, climbing etc.) t...

        "text":"Coo Palace\n\nDumfries and Galloway, Scotland\n\nWalk 12 - Carstramon Woods and Knocktinkle walking and hiking route\n\n\nWalk Instructions\n\nStart: At a parking area in Carstramon Woods\nRefreshments: Caf\u00e9s and pubs in Gatehouse of Fleet\n\nWoodland and moorland walking over varied terrain. This is a good walk for seeing red squirrels, roe deer and a variety of woodland birds.\n\n1. Carstramon (also known as Castramon or Castramont) Wood is found along the minor road on the east side of the Fleet Valley about 2 miles north of Gatehouse of Fleet. There is a designated parking area with information boards just before the junction with the minor road that crosses over to the west side of the valley. The woods are part of a Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve that is known for its abundant bird life and spectacular bluebells in late spring. The woods are largely composed of oak trees that were planted around 1800 and were used for charcoal production for about 100 years. The oak wood was also used to produce bobbins for use in the cotton mills of Gatehouse. For the first section of the walk you can follow the road northwards, past Carstramon House to the end of the woods or alternatively make use of the network of paths through the woods to reach the same point.\n\n2. At the north end of the wood is a sign post indicating the start of the path that follows the rough valley of Castramont Cleugh up the east side of the Fleet valley. The path stays to the right side of a dry-stone wall and has muddy sections and some bridges to assist in crossing small streams that come down from the hillside of the left. After about a mile of rough going you will meet a forest track coming in from the left. Follow this track up to meet the Gatehouse to Lauriston road.\n\n3. Turn right (southwards) on the road and enjoy the panoramic views over Wigtown Bay as you descend for about a mile to reach the point where the road crosses the Laghead Burn and a track branches off to Laghead farm on the right. The dry-stone walls along the roadside here are some of the finest examples of walling using rounded granite boulders. This is an indication that the underlying rocks have changed from the angular sedimentary rocks that are seen along the coast to the more massive granite rocks that underlie the higher elevations of the Galloway Hills.\n\n4. Take the track down past Laghead farm and continue down fields where the track deteriorates into a faint footpath but eventually leads down to Lagg farm and the road from Gatehouse. Turn right along the road and follow it for just over half a mile back to your starting point.\n\nIt would be a great help to future walkers if you could record any inaccuracies you come across during this walk and report them to reception so that appropriate amendments can be made. Thank you for your help. Happy walking.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This route was correct at time of writing.
