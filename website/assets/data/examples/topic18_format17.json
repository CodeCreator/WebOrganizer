        "text":"\u201cYes, but help and healing are needed.\u201d\n\nA disproportionate number of those going into missions come from wounded backgrounds and often have a strong desire to rescue or help others. These young adults from \u201cdysfunctional\u201d families can be as able a servant on the mission field as anyone else. However, they first need to allow our Lord Jesus to heal the wounds remaining from their upbringing.\u00a0\n\nFamily problems can be a very sensitive issue, and must be dealt with in an atmosphere of love and trust. Most mission agencies have personnel staff ready to help potential missionaries prepare for service with them. Don\u2019t try to wait until you\u2019re perfect before beginning application! Pastoral care from your church and\/or campus fellowship are other means of getting help.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nProfessional counseling is not the only way to recovery. Seek out counsel, understanding and accountability from believers, a pastor, lay people at church, friends, or campus staff workers who are older, more mature and emotionally healthy.\u00a0\n\nNote: This answer is excerpted from\u00a0Dysfunctional Families: Going into Missions from a Wounded Background, by Timothy Boyd and Brent Lindquist. We encourage you to read the rest of the article. The resources section of this website lists a number of\u00a0articles on the topic of guidance\n\nAnswer from Drs. Timothy Boyd and Brent Lindquist with the counseling and restoration ministry Link Care.\n\n\u201cJesus is the redeemer, so yes, you can.\u201d\n\nI experienced several childhood and early adulthood traumas before going to the mission field. When I was eight, my dad died. That was traumatic. Later, just after my high school graduation, both of my grandparents died on the same day. My grandfather had been ill, but my grandma had not. Later, my 28-year-old brother was killed in a work accident. Five years later, I lost my 29-year-old younger brother and my 26-year-old sister. Those losses were painful. I was a believer and dealt with them as I could and sensed God\u2019s help in getting through those struggles.\u00a0\n\nThree years after the death of my sister, we were appointed to serve in Chile. We spent eight months in Costa Rica and then moved on to Chile. During a very stressful time in the life of our mission, at the start of my second term, while my son was eight years old, I had panic attacks. I had never even heard of them before. I thought I was dying. Then I thought I was going crazy. Thankfully, our member care person helped me to understand what was happening. I realized that I was trying to control the uncontrollable and that I was, in fact, trying to be God. With the help of medication, prayer, a loving wife, and several professionals, I was able to overcome the PTSD problems.\u00a0\n\nAlthough I would not wish such anxiety on anyone, I learned so much about Jesus as my redeemer. All of the traumatic events in my life were like coupons, just worthless, meaningless pieces of paper unless I took them to the right place to be redeemed. He gave me meaning for these events and even turned my own anxiety struggles into opportunities to care for others and to offer hope and encouragement. God uses cracked clay pots.\u00a0\n\nI would certainly tell you to seek all of the great help that is available now, before you go, to make sure you are ready and resilient. However, just because you have suffered loss or abuse or trauma, you should not consider yourself unfit to serve the Lord. You may, in fact, be better to touch the lives of others who need Jesus.\n\nAnswer from Ken in Spain, who served with the Canadian National Baptist Convention and Fellowship International in Chile and Spain for 15 years.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it depends on how much healing they\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nDr. Robert Grant, a psychologist who counsels missionaries, is exploring this issue a lot because those who are still wounded can wound others. A traumatic childhood should not preclude someone from missions, but a lot of inner healing work and counseling should be a priority first.\u00a0\n\nOften where we\u2019ve experienced healing can be a place where we have the most compassion for others. We just have to be really careful and do our due diligence.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve written a little bit more about this on my blog here: \u00a0What I Wish I\u2019d Known about Missionary Burnout.\n\nAnswer from Sarita, who has served with Zion Project in Uganda for seven years.",

He writes that it is improper to pray for unnecessary things - \"\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05de\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d7 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05da\" - \"for he unnecessarily troubles his Master\" - a concept found in the Talmud (Taanis 24a). The Mabit discusses this at length, but his basic point is that the acceptance of prayer is a supernatural event, and God \"dislikes\" unnecessarily disturbing the natural order that He created.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

There is no other way to freedom.\n\nWe know Supreme Being is God. As stated below from Kaivalya Upanishad.\n\nHe is God, He is The Absolute, He is Heaven, He is Eternal, the Supreme, the Self-luminous, He alone is All, He is Breath, He is Time and Fire, He is the Moon.\n\nIf God alone is all that was,and all that will be , then isn't every being a God? Isn't every act an act of God ? Isn't every speech an speech of God?\n\n\nEvery being infact every thing is Brahman.\n\n\"You are the woman, You are the man, You are the boy, (and) You are the girl too. You are the old man tottering with a stick. Taking birth, You have Your faces everywhere.\"\n\n(Svetasvatara Upanishad 4.3)\n\n\"You, indeed, are the blue bee; You indeed are the green parrot having red eyes; You indeed are possessed of lightning in Your womb. You indeed are the seasons and the seas. You indeed are without beginning; You exist as the Omnipresent, from whom have sprung all the worlds. \"\n\n(Svetasvatara Upanishad 4.4)\n\n\nKrishna says in the Gita, chapter 9, verses 4-6 (Swami Nikhilananda translator):\n\nBy Me, in My unmanifested form, are all things in this universe pervaded. All beings exist in Me, but I do not exist in them.\n\nAnd yet the beings do not dwell in Me--behold, that is My divine mystery. My Spirit, which is the support of all beings and the source of all things, does not dwell in them.\n\nAs the mighty wind blowing everywhere ever rests in the aksha, know that in the same manner all beings rest in Me.\n\n\nYes, everything is God. Even right now, in whatever condition you are, in this condition also You are God. Supreme Shiva involves in five activities -\n\n  1. Emanation (Srishti).\n  2. Re- Absorption (SamhAra).\n  3. Concealment (Vilaye).\n  4. Maintenance (Sthiti).\n  5. Grace (Anugrah).\n\nNow, Even after forgetting his real nature, Lord Shiva in the form of Jiva keeps doing these 5 activities.\n\nEven in this condition (of the empirical self), he (the individual) does the five krtyas (deeds) like Him (i.e. like Siva). Pratyabhijna Hridyam Sutra 10.\n\nCommentary by AchArya KshemrAj: When the great Lord who is consciousness (lit. whose form is consciousness) entering into the sphere of the body, prana etc. on the occasion of the attention becoming external, makes objects like blue etc. appear in definite space, time etc. then with reference to appearance in definite space, time etc., it is His act of emanation (srastrta). With reference to the appearance of the objects in another space, time etc., it is His act of withdrawal or absorption (samhartrta). With reference to the actual (continuity of the) appearance of blue etc., it is His act of maintenance (sthdpakata). With reference to its appearance as different, it is His act of concealment (vilayakarita). With reference to the appearance of every thing as identical with the light (of consciousness), it is His act of grace (anugrahitrta). As to how the Lord is always the author of the fivefold act, I have extensively demonstrated in Spandasandoha. Thus this authorship of the fivefold act occurring within one's own personal experience, if pursued steadily with firm understanding, reveals the Lord's greatness to the devotee. Therefore, those who always ponder over this (fivefold act of the Lord), knowing the universe as an unfoldment of the essential nature (of consciousness), become liberated in this very life. This is what the (sacred) tradition maintains (ityamnatah).\n\nYou must log in to answer this question.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for? Browse other questions tagged .",

        "text":"Now, I don't go to church, my family stopped when I was like 8 (I'm 13), the church near me, that didn't have a raping problem and was Christian(not Catholic even though that is Christian), was a super church. It didn't really teach me much, since I was little I went with the other little kids, we only watched Veggietales and colored. We really didn't like that it used fast food and drink places, like Starbucks, to attract people since that isn't what church is about to us. I did learn what ellipses were though.\n\nSo, I didn't really know what Jesus looked like except the pictures in my grandma's house. The Jesus in her house had (idk if she has them in her new house) a black guy with thick hair and then one with lighter skin, very long hair, and a long beard.\n\nI asked her which one was really Jesus and she said that she said that she thinks that the black one is since nowadays they don't portray peoples' colors correctly and that we were the first people. She has both because she likes to have more than one thing portraying Jesus, even though it isn't the right one to her, she still knows who it is supposed to be. (Her church is a black church and the booklets portray Jesus as black)\n\nI have even seen Jesus with white skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes and for some reason, I don't really like it since it seems fake.\n\nMy question is, which Jesus is right? And for the wrong ones, do you know why they changed them or did God make it so Jesus could be seen differently for different people?\n\n\nWhat did Jesus look like?\n\nWhile the Bible doesn't give any detailed information as to Jesus' appearance, let's look at the facts:\n\n  \u2022 Jesus was born of a Jewish woman, therefore he would have the characteristics of that particular nationality. He would blend in with the local people without standing out amongst a crowd. (John 7:10,11)\n  \u2022 Jesus' hair would have been longish, probably around the shirt collar, but not long like that of women (1 Cor. 11:14)\n  \u2022 Jesus would have a beard as was the custom for those following the Law of Moses (Lev. 19:27)\n  \u2022 Being a carpenter for a time, Jesus had the physical traits of someone that did intensive labor. Let's not forget that Jesus did lots of walking during his 3 1\/2 year ministry. (Matt. 9:35)\n\nSome people have argued that Jesus was of African descent because of the description of Jesus in Revelation 1:14, 15. But the book of Revelation was presented \"in signs\" (Rev. 1:1) to the Apostle John, so the description of Jesus would have symbolic meanings. Take for example that Revelation also describes Jesus as having feet of bronze or copper (Rev. 1:15), but there is no race that has skin color like in that description.\n\nSome people say that Jesus was weak or frail. Jesus was a man of action like when he overturned the tables of the moneychangers in the Temple. (John 2:14, 15) The only time Jesus needed help was after he had been whipped and beaten by Roman soldiers. (Luke 23:26)\n\nIf you would like more information on this topic, read the article \"What Did Jesus Look Like?\" on jw.org. This is just one of several \"Bible Questions Answered\".\n\n  \u2022 Yes, the Transfiguration did affect his appearance but this was for a short time and it happened several decades after his birth. Therefore, for the majority of his life, Jesus would have had the Semitic features of his birth mother. \u2013\u00a0agarza Nov 1 '20 at 14:08\n\nJesus looked the same for everyone.\n\ndid God make it so Jesus could be seen differently for different people?\n\nI'll address this part of your question, since agarza has addressed what Jesus actually looked like based on Biblical sources.\n\nIn essence, no, Jesus looked the same for everyone. During his life on Earth, Jesus had a fully human body of flesh and blood. While his facial features were supernaturally transformed during his Transfiguration, he still remained fundamentally human.\n\n1 John 4:2-3\n\nBy this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess 1that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.\n\nIf Jesus had a flesh-and-blood human body, then it would have interacted with the world the same way every other flesh-and-blood human body does; it would have reflected light the same way our bodies do, and it would have appeared the same to everyone the same way our bodies do - though the interpretation of the light Jesus's body might have varied from person to person, the same way that two different people can look at the same thing and interpret it differently based on differences in their personal experiences and contexts.\n\n  \u2022 1\n    \"While his facial features were supernaturally transformed during his Transfiguration\" This is a big claim that you need to justify. \u2013\u00a0curiousdannii Nov 1 '20 at 14:11\n  \u2022 @curiousdannii Luke 9:29. \"As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.\" \u2013\u00a0nick012000 Nov 1 '20 at 14:13\n  \u2022 2\n    The parallel account at Matt. 17:2 tells us \"his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.\" So, Jesus' face changed in that it began to glow. If his face was to have physically altered, the Biblical record would have given evidence that those seeking to kill him would not be able to recognize him after the Transfiguration. \u2013\u00a0agarza Nov 1 '20 at 19:51\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
