        "text":"You asked: Why do you not feel any force of attraction between yourself and your friend sitting close to you?\n\nBecause the masses of persons are not large enough to overcome the value of small constant of gravitation so the force of gravitation is very small and negligible to feel.\n\nWhy can\u2019t you feel the force of attraction between you and the surrounding objects?\n\nBecause your mass is so much less than the mass of the Earth, you can\u2019t feel your gravitational force. \u2026 Because the Earth\u2019s gravity has the same pull on every object, all objects fall at the same speed (in a vacuum). On Earth, we have air. Air resistance will cause some objects to fall more slowly than others will.\n\nTHIS IS EXCITING:\u00a0 Quick Answer: What are the most attractive physical features in a man?\n\nWhy can\u2019t you feel the pull of gravity between yourself and another person?\n\nEvery object that has mass exerts an attractive gravitational pull proportional to that mass. The seat, the walls around you, the ceiling, the TV, etc. The reason you don\u2019t feel it is because gravity is by far the weakest of the fundamental forces.\n\nWhy do two students sitting close to each other not feel force of gravitational attraction between them?\n\nBecause every object experiences the same gravitational force from the Earth, they all fall at the same rate (in a vacuum). We have air on Earth. \u2026 Therefore, the gravitational force is negligible as compared to gravity of Earth, that\u2019s why we do not feel the gravitational force between us and a person sitting closely.\n\nHow do you find the force of attraction between two objects?\n\nThe mathematical formula for gravitational force is F=GMmr2 F = G Mm r 2 where G is the gravitational constant.\n\nHow does the force of gravitation between two?\n\nHow does the force of gravitation between two objects change when the distance between them is reduced to half? Ans. The force of gravitation between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them therefore the gravity will become four times if distance between them is reduced to half.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we notice the gravitational pull of objects like books and chairs?\n\nThe more mass an object has, the stronger its gravitational force. Because Earth\u2019s gravitational pull is so strong, we do not notice the pull from other objects. Earth\u2019s gravity pulls everything to the center of Earth and prevents us from flying off into space.\n\nTHIS IS EXCITING:\u00a0 You asked: What does tourist guide mean?\n\nWhy we do not notice the gravitational force between most objects?\n\nThere is a gravitational force of attraction between every object in the universe. The size of the gravitational force is proportional to the masses of the objects and weakens as the distance between them increases. \u2026 We only notice gravitational forces if one of the objects involved has a huge mass (such as the Earth).\n\nWhy two people on the surface of the Earth will not feel the effects of gravity?\n\nThe force of gravity does not require that the two interacting objects (your body and the Earth) make physical contact; it can act over a distance through space. Since the force of gravity is not a contact force, it cannot be felt through contact.\n\nHow do you feel the gravitational force of the Earth on yourself?\n\nGravity does not move objects in spacetime (hence it\u2019s not a force), instead gravity warps spacetime and you will warp with it provided nothing gets in your way, when something gets in your way (the ground at your feet), then you feel it.\n\nWhat is difference between G and G?\n\ng is the gravitational force exerted by any planet. For earth it\u2019s 9.8m\/s2.\n\nquestion_answer Answers(5)\n\nAcceleration due to gravity ( g ) Universal Gravitation Constant ( G )\nIt will change from place to place. Constant at any place in the universe.\nValue of g=9.8 m\/s2 Value of G=6.673\u00d710-11 Nm2\/kg2\n\nWhich force always attract objects towards the earth?\n\nThe weight-force or weight of an object is the force because of gravity, which acts on the object attracting it towards the centre of the earth.\n\nTHIS IS EXCITING:\u00a0 Can I work online in the UK without a visa?\n\nWhat happens to the force of attraction between two objects when?\n\nSince gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance between the two interacting objects, more separation distance will result in weaker gravitational forces. So as two objects are separated from each other, the force of gravitational attraction between them also decreases.\n\nHow does the force of attraction?\n\nThe first force that causes attraction is the gravitational force. According to Newton\u2019s Universal Law of Gravitation, every object in the universe attracts every other object in the universe. Gravity is an attractive force since any object with mass will experience a force of attraction from other objects with mass.",

        "text":"Most molecules containing nitrogen atoms in trigonal pyramid configuration undergo a relatively fast process of inversion at room temperature. On the other hand, the free energy barrier for phosphines, sulfoniums and sulfoxides are high enough that they are optically stable: the rate of racemization is slow at room temperature.\n\nI wonder what effect is responsible for this difference in behaviour (the larger energy barrier). I expect that it has to do with the size of the central atom (N being one row higher than P and S), but is that all there is to it? And how does size impact the free energy barrier for the inversion: energetically or entropically (or both, of course)?\n\n\nAzane all by itself has an inversion barrier of about $6\\ \\mathrm{kcal\/mol}$, which is low compared to phosphine's approximately $30\\ \\mathrm{kcal\/mol}$ barrier. Pyramidal nitrogen inversion requires a planar transition state. One can use a classical theory to model the thermal rate and we could write $$k \\propto \\mathrm e^{-E_\\mathrm a\/(RT)} $$ and using models like these we would predict that ammonia at $300\\ \\mathrm K$ would have a rate on the order of $10^8\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, instead what is observed is something on the order of $10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nAssuming the potential energy surface has two minima equal in energy and a higher energy TS, two routes are possible: a thermal process going over the maxima or quantum-mechanical tunneling. Determining a tunneling frequency requires writing down vibrational wave functions, finding their linear combination and overlap. If we were to do all this for a particular vibration, we'd see that the tunneling frequency decreases exponentially with a dependence on increasing $\\mu$, thickness of the barrier\/shape, and the barrier height. As an example, $\\ce{ND3}$ has approximately an order of magnitude slower rate of inversion than $\\ce{NH3}$ at a sufficiently low temperature \u2013 this has been attributed to a decrease in its tunneling frequency.\n\nBut why the difference in the energy barriers and corresponding rates depending on the atomic position in the periodic table? Perhaps the easiest\/quickest explanation rests on considering what the TS requires for interconversion. Ideally the classical conversion requires passing through a trigonal planar structure with bond angles on the order of 120 degrees. If you consider the series of azane, phosphane, arsane then you'll see bond angles of 108, 94, 92 degrees respectively. In the absence of other effects, the barrier goes from smaller to larger. Indeed, asane-like molecules were the first of this series resolved, followed by phosphane-like. To the best of my knowledge the fastest have yet to be resolved, because rates on the order of $10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ are required at RT for a decent shot at isolating them. Naturally, this isn't the whole story, as I've previously alluded to above. Let me know if you would like to know more.\n\n\nNeither of the two enantiomers is actually an energy eigenstate of the molecule. If the right-handed and left-handed enantiomers are states $|R\\rangle$ and $|L\\rangle$ respectively, then the ground and first-excited energy eigenstates are going to be something like $|g\\rangle=\\left( |R\\rangle +|L\\rangle \\right)\/\\sqrt{2}$ and $|e\\rangle=\\left( |R\\rangle -|L\\rangle \\right)\/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nBecause each enantiomer is in a superposition of energy eigenstates, a molecule initially in one chiral state will oscillate back and forth from one to the other, with a frequency determined by the difference in energy between $|g\\rangle$ and $|e\\rangle$.\n\nIn general, the difference in energy between $|g\\rangle$ and $|e\\rangle$ is determined by the barrier between the $|R\\rangle $ and $|L\\rangle$ states: the higher and wider the energy barrier, the slower the oscillation. Since P and S are much larger than N, the energy barrier between the $|R\\rangle $ and $|L\\rangle$ states is larger, and the frequency of oscillation between $|R\\rangle $ and $|L\\rangle$ is much lower.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Sorry, my question is: why is the barrier higher for larger atoms? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0F'x May 20 '12 at 20:25\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I don't know why (or even if) larger atoms would have a higher barrier, but they would have a wider barrier by virtue of just being larger. Part of the point was that a wider barrier is enough to slow down the oscillation. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Dan May 20 '12 at 20:28\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Indeed, that's a good point (not the answer to my question, but something I hadn't considered). As you said, the wider the barrier, the slower the oscillation\u2026 but between N and P, the energy barrier actually is much higher for phosphine (132 kJ\/mol) than ammonia (24 kJ\/mol). I would expect that contribution to be more important than the barrier widening. $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0F'x May 20 '12 at 20:31\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nMathOverflow is a question and answer site for professional mathematicians. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nI am interested in showing that a certain Green's function can be used to approximate the distance function on a Riemannian manifold in the following sense. Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and consider a ball $B \\subset M$ centered at a distinguished point $p \\in M$ whose radius is no larger than the injectivity radius at $p$. Let $d: B \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be the geodesic distance to $p$. (The reason for considering the ball $B$ instead of the entire domain is simply to avoid issues concerning the cut locus, where the distance function fails to be smooth.) If $\\Delta$ is the negative-(semi)definite Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$, then there is a 1-parameter family of Green's functions $u_t$ defined as solutions to\n\n$$(\\mathrm{id}-t\\Delta) u_t = \\delta_p$$\n\nwhere the parameter $t$ is positive and $\\delta_p$ is a Dirac delta at $p$.\n\nQuestion: does $\\nabla u_t \/ |\\nabla u_t|$ approach $-\\nabla d$ as $t \\rightarrow 0$? Alternatively, do the level sets of $u_t$ approach geodesic circles as $t \\rightarrow 0$?\n\nSeveral closely related results suggest that the answer is likely positive, mostly related to analysis of the heat kernel. In particular, Varadhan in his classic paper (\"On the behavior of the fundamental solution of the heat equation with variable coefficients\") considers a similar boundary value problem $(\\mathrm{id} - t\\Delta)v_t = 0$ on a domain $\\Omega$ with $v_t |\\partial\\Omega = 1$ and shows that $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow 0} -\\sqrt{t}\/2 \\log v_t = d$, i.e., the function itself converges to the distance function. However, this result does not (as far as I know) explicitly guarantee convergence of the gradients. In a similar vein, Malliavin and Stroock (\"Short time behavior of the heat kernel and its logarithmic derivatives\") essentially show that the gradient of the heat kernel converges to the gradient of the distance function. However, the heat kernel is a solution to the parabolic problem $\\dot{u} = \\Delta u$ for some duration $t>0$ with initial conditions $u_0 = \\delta_p$ -- i.e., it is not the same as the elliptic problem described above. I am also aware of some results by Bardi (\"An Asymptotic Formula for the Green's Function of an Elliptic Operator\"), but they do not seem relevant in this case because they do not consider operators with a constant component ($\\mathrm{id}$) as in the case above. Basically what I'm saying here is that the result is almost certainly true (and not a major departure from what's already mentioned in this paragraph), but I'm having trouble nailing down a concrete reference to cite.\n\n\nshare|improve this question\nMaybe the Li-Yau Harnack inequality is relevant? ams.org\/mathscinet-getitem?mr=834612 \u2013\u00a0 Ian Agol May 3 '12 at 2:49\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 5 down vote accepted\n\nFirst observe that on a compact Riemann manifold $(M, g)$ the operator $1+t \\Delta$, $t>0$. $\\Delta = d^*d: C^\\infty(M)\\to C^\\infty(M)$ has a unique fundamental solution. Jacques Hadamard has constructed very explicit asymptotic expansions for this fundamental solution which lead to convergent series in the case of real analytic manifolds and metrics.\n\nA modern description of Hadamard's construction can be found in volume 3, Sec. 17.4 of L. H\\\"ormander's four volume on linear partial differential operators. (Hadamard's original memoir is also very useful, but harder to penetrate.) I will give a brief description of the fundamental solution $S_r$ of $(r+\\Delta)$, $r>0$.\n\nFor $\\nu=0,1,2,\\dotsc $ and $r>0$ denote by $F_{\\nu,r}(x)$ the generalized function (a.k.a. distribution) on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ described as $\\newcommand{\\ii}{\\boldsymbol{i}}$ a Fourier transform of a temperate distribution.\n\n$$F_{\\nu,r}(x)= \\nu! (2\\pi)^{-n} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{ \\ii\\langle x,\\xi\\rangle} (|\\xi|^2+r)^{-\\nu-1} d\\xi. $$\n\nThe function $F_\\nu$ can be expressed explicitly in terms of Bessel functions. Note that\n\n$$F_{\\nu,r}(x)= r^{\\frac{n-\\nu-1}{2}} F_\\nu(\\sqrt{r} x),\\;\\;F_\\nu(x):=F_{\\nu,r=1}(x). $$\n\nIf $$\\Delta=-\\sum_k\\partial^2_{x_k}$$\n\ndenotes the (geometers') Laplacian in $\\mathbb{R}^n$$ then\n\n$$(r+\\Delta)F_{0,r}=\\delta_0,\\;\\;(r+\\Delta)F_{\\nu,r}=\\nu F_{\\nu-1, r},\\;\\;\\forall \\nu>0. $$\n\nOne can show that the generalized function $F_\\nu$ depends only on the distance $|x|$.\n\nGoing back to the Riemann manifold $(M,g)$ we denote by $d: M\\times M\\to \\mathbb{R}$ the geodesic distance function.\n\nThe Green function $G(x,y)$ then has an asymptotic expansion\n\n$$ G(x,y)\\sim \\sum_{\\nu=0}^\\infty U_\\nu(x,y) F_{\\nu,r}( \\; d(x,y)\\;)$$\n\nvalid for $d(x,y)$ sufficiently small, where the functions $U_\\nu(x,y)$ are explicitly described in the above reference. If $(M,g)$ is real analytic, then the above series converges in an appropriate sense.\n\nThis asymptotic expansion ought to be enough to investigate your question.\n\nUpdate I want to add a \"philosophical\" comment. The question you asked is a special case of the following more general question.\n\nSuppose that $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. For simplicity, let us assume it is also bounded. We can define the bounded symmetric operator $f(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ where $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian on an $m$-dimensional manifold $M$. Investigate the behavior of $f(\\varepsilon\\Delta)$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.Your case corresponds to $f(x)=(1+x^2)^{-1}$. The heat equation problems correspond to $f(x)=e^{-x^2}$. Suppose that $f$ is a symbol of order $k$, where $k$ could be $-\\infty$. For example $(1+x^2)^{-k}$ is a symbol of order $-2k$, while $e^{-x^2}$ is a symbol of order $-\\infty$.\n\nIn any case, when $f$ is a symbol, then $f(\\Delta)$ is a pseudodifferential operator, and as such it has a Schwartz kernel which is a distribution on $M\\times M$. $\\newcommand{\\ve}{\\varepsilon}$ Your question is about the behavior as $\\ve\\to 0$ of the Schwartz kernel of $f(\\ve \\Delta)$ along normal directions to the diagonal of $M\\times M$.\n\nIf $f$ is rapidly decaying at $\\infty$, say $f(x) < (1+x^2)^{-m}$, $m=\\dim M$, then the Schwartz kernel of $f(\\Delta)$ is given by a continuous function and one can be quite precise about the behavior of the kernel of $f(\\ve \\Delta)$. In fact, the faster the decay of $f$ at $\\infty$, the more accurate one can be about the behavior of the Schwartz kernel of $f(\\ve \\Delta)$. The radial symmetry you are talking about is then a simple consequence if $f$ decays faster than $|x|^{-N}$, $N$ sufficiently large. (I believe that $N>2m$ ought to do it but I don't want to be too firm.) If $f$ has exponential decay at $\\infty$ one can be remarkable accurate and recover the radial symmetry you are mentioning. Your question involves the symbol $(1+x^2)^{-1}$ that isn't decaying fast enough at $\\infty$. Translation: your problem requires a bit of care.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nGreat -- thanks for the pointer; I'll take a look. \u2013\u00a0 TerronaBell Apr 25 '12 at 1:17\nWhat happened to $S_r$, and why do the $F_\\nu$ not depend on $r$ even though the recursion relations that they satisfy do depend on $r$? \u2013\u00a0 Robert Bryant May 2 '12 at 15:06\n@ Robert: Ooops!

In fact Hormander's carries the computation for any $r$. I will edit my answer. \u2013\u00a0 Liviu Nicolaescu May 2 '12 at 20:22\n@Robert: I screwed my comment above. You are right. I have updated my answer. In the book I cite, Hormander computes the an asymptotic expansion for the kernel of $(r+\\delta)^{-1}$ for any $r>0$. \u2013\u00a0 Liviu Nicolaescu May 2 '12 at 20:32\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nMathOverflow is a question and answer site for professional mathematicians. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nThe Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem is a fundamental result in the ergodic theory of dynamical systems which is typically stated as follows: if $T$ is a continuous transformation of a nonempty compact metric space $X$, then there exists a Borel probability measure $\\mu$ on $X$ which is invariant under $T$ in the sense that $\\mu(A)=\\mu(T^{-1}A)$ for all Borel sets $A \\subseteq X$, or equivalently $\\int f d\\mu = \\int (f \\circ T)d\\mu$ for every continuous function $f \\colon X \\to \\mathbb{R}$. This question is concerned with proofs of that theorem.\n\nThe most popular proof of the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem operates as follows. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ denote the set of all Borel probability measures on $X$, and equip $\\mathcal{M}$ with the coarsest topology such that for every continuous $f \\colon X \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the function from $\\mathcal{M}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $\\mu \\mapsto \\int f d\\mu$ is continuous. In this topology $\\mathcal{M}$ is compact and metrisable, and a sequence $(\\mu_n)$ of elements of $\\mathcal{M}$ converges to a limit $\\mu$ if and only if $\\int fd\\mu_n \\to \\int fd\\mu$ for every continuous $f \\colon X \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Now let $x \\in X$ be arbitrary, and define a sequence of elements of $\\mathcal{M}$ by $\\mu_n:=(1\/n)\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\delta_{T^ix}$, where $\\delta_z$ denotes the Dirac probability measure concentrated at $z$. Using the sequential compactness of $\\mathcal{M}$ we may extract an accumulation point $\\mu$ which is invariant under $T$ by an easy calculation. This proof, together with minor variations thereupon, is fairly ubiquitous in ergodic theory textbooks. In the answers to this question, Vaughn Climenhaga notes the following alternative proof: the map taking the measure $\\mu$ to the measure $T_*\\mu$ defined by $(T_*\\mu)(A):=\\mu(T^{-1}A)$ is a continuous transformation of the compact convex set $\\mathcal{M}$, and hence has a fixed point by the Schauder-Tychonoff theorem. A couple of years ago I thought of another proof, given below. The first part of this question is: has the following proof ever been published?\n\nThis third proof is as follows. Clearly it suffices to show that there exists a finite Borel measure on $X$ which is invariant under $T$, since we may normalise this measure to produce a probability measure. By the Hahn decomposition theorem it follows that it suffices to find a nonzero finite signed measure on $X$ which is invariant under $T$. By the Riesz representation theorem for measures this is equivalent to the statement that there exists a nonzero continuous linear functional $L \\colon C(X) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $L(f \\circ T)=f$ for all continuous functions $f \\colon X \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Let $B(X)$ be the closed subspace of $C(X)$ which is equal to the closure of the set of all continuous functions which take the form $g \\circ T - g$ for some continuous $g$. Clearly a continuous linear functional $L \\colon C(X) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $L(f \\circ T)=f$ if and only if it vanishes on $B(X)$, so to construct an invariant measure it suffices to show that the dual of $C(X)\/B(X)$ is nontrivial. A consequence of the Hahn-Banach theorem is that the dual of $C(X)\/B(X)$ is nontrivial as long as $C(X)\/B(X)$ is itself nontrivial, so to prove the theorem it is sufficient to show that the complement of $B(X)$ in $C(X)$ is nonempty. But the constant function $h(x):=1$ is not in $B(X)$ because if $|(g \\circ T - g)(x) - 1|<1\/2$ for all $x \\in X$, then $g(Tx)>g(x)+1\/2$ for all $x \\in X$ and hence $g(T^nx)>g(x)+n\/2$ for all $n \\geq 1$ and $x \\in X$. This is impossible since $g$ is continuous and $X$ is compact. We conclude that $B(X)$ is a proper Banach subspace of $C(X)$ and the desired functional exists.\n\nThe second part of the question deals with the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem for measures invariant under amenable groups of transformations. Let $\\Gamma = \\{T_\\gamma\\}$ be a countable amenable group of continuous transformations of the compact metric space $X$. We shall say that $\\mu \\in \\mathcal{M}$ is invariant under $\\Gamma$ if $(T_\\gamma)_*\\mu = \\mu$ for all $T_\\gamma$. I believe that by using F\u00f8lner sequences one may generalise the first proof of the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem to show that every such amenable group has an invariant Borel probability measure. I seem to recall that the second proof also generalises to this scenario (in Glasner's book, perhaps?). Despite a certain amount of thought I have not been able to see how the third proof might generalise to this situation, even when $\\Gamma$ is generated by just two commuting elements. So, the second part of this question is: can anyone see how the third proof generalises to the amenable case?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 4 down vote accepted\n\nYour proof can be modified a bit so that it works for a general countable, amenable group $\\Gamma$. In this case, we can take $B(X)$ to be the closure of $\\mbox{span} \\{ f \\circ T_{\\gamma} - f : f \\in C(X), \\gamma \\in \\Gamma \\}$ and we show that $B(X)$ doesn't contain the constant functions on $X$ as follows:\n\nI claim that every function $h \\in \\mbox{span} \\{ f \\circ T_{\\gamma} - f : f \\in C(X), \\gamma \\in \\Gamma \\}$ is non-negative at some point in $X$, namely $\\max_{x \\in X} h(x) \\ge 0$. This is sometimes called the \"translate property\" for amenable groups, if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, after establishing that, the conclusion follows easily: it follows that one cannot uniformly approximate a negative constant (say $-7$) by a function of the above form.\n\nThe proof of the translate property I'm familiar with goes like this:\n\nAssume for contradiction that $\\max_{x \\in X} h(x) = \\delta < 0$ and let $\\varepsilon > 0$. Let $h=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}\\circ T_{\\gamma_{i}}-f_{i}$. Since $\\Gamma$ is amenable we can find a finite set $U \\subset \\Gamma$ such that $\\frac{\\left|\\gamma_{i}U\\triangle U\\right|}{\\left|U\\right|}<\\varepsilon$ for all $i=1,\\dots,n$ (the F\u00f8lner condition). Now consider the function $F:=\\frac{1}{\\left|U\\right|}\\sum_{u\\in U}h\\circ T_{u}$. Choose some point $x_0 \\in X$. On the one hand, by our assumption, $F\\left(x_{0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left|U\\right|}\\sum_{u\\in U} h \\left(T_{u}x_{0}\\right)\\le\\delta<0$. On the other hand,\n\n$\\left|F\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right|=\\left|\\frac{1}{\\left|U\\right|}\\sum_{u\\in U}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}\\left(T_{\\gamma_{i}}T_{u}x_{0}\\right)-f_{i}\\left(T_{u}x_{0}\\right)\\right|$\n\nBy the triangle inequality, changing order of summation and using the property of U, you see that the above is at most $2n \\varepsilon \\max_{x\\in X,1\\le i\\le n}\\left|f_{i}\\left(x\\right)\\right|$. So if you choose $\\varepsilon$ small enough, you get a contradiction.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nLet me first mention that actually Bogolyubov himself proved \"the Krylov-Bogolyubov\" theorem for actions of arbitrary amenable groups in 1939 (2 years after the Krylov-Bogolyubov theorem was published). Unfortunately, it was published in Ukrainian in a rather obscure place, and remained virtually unknown (see Anosov's article MR1311227 in Russian Math. Surveys 1994 for more details). Currently its Russian translation is available in various volumes of Bogolyubov's collected works, but as far as I know no English translation exists. Bogolyubov's argument is close to your \"first proof\", except for he works directly with means instead of F\u00f8lner sequences (which had not been defined yet at the time).\n\nNow, returning to your question about the \"third proof\". One way to do it (with a bit of cheating) consists in trying to replace invariance with respect to all elements of an amenable group with invariance just with respect to a single operator. This can, indeed, be done by using the fact that for any amenable group there is a probability measure $\\mu$ on the group such that the sequence of its convolutions strongly converges to invariance (see the answer to the question characterizations of amenable groups which use the space $\\ell_1(G)$ and convolution). Therefore, if a measure on the action space is invariant with respect to the convolution operator $P_\\mu$ associated with the measure $\\mu$, then it is necessarily group invariant. Now, for proving existence of $P_\\mu$-invariant measures one can apply your argument. Of course, the same trick works for the \"first\" and for the \"second\" proofs as well.\n\nPS The term \"amenable action\" already has several well established (and contradictory) meanings, and it is misleading to use it just for actions of amenable groups as you do in the last paragraph of your question.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks. I have rephrased to avoid use of the words \"amenable action\". \u2013\u00a0 Ian Morris Jul 31 '11 at 7:46\n\nPlease check Krasnosel'skii, M.A.; Lifshits, Je.A.; Sobolev, A.V. (1990), Positive Linear Systems: The method of positive operators, Sigma Series in Applied Mathematics,\n\nKrasnoselskii told me that he presented his argument at Bogolubov's seminar in 1949?\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks very much, I will look at this book when I can get hold of it (according to COPAC, there are only seven copies of this book in the entire country!). I am not surprised that the argument is not new, but it does seem to be quite rare in the English-language literature. \u2013\u00a0 Ian Morris Jan 18 '12 at 11:36\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

I read about Connie Mack and Shoeless Joe and Home\nRun Baker (12 home runs in a single year, a record that would stand forever)\nand imagined how Bob Feller would pitch to Ty Cobb if they had played\ntogether.

For about two years I was sure I was right around the corner\nfrom the FLT solution, and my rightful place in the annals of mathematical\n\n    Math history is my history, math people are my people, and it is through\ntheir lives I learn my culture.

You can get it from\nAmazon or the MAA ( www.maa.org) and I hope it will convince you to continue\nyour worthy goal.\n\n    And don't forget the Hindu-Arabic mathematicians, and the oriental\ncontributions.  When western science and mathematics went into a 700 year\nslumber, they kept the flame aglow.\n\n   Good luck and I hope your students find the joy in the history of\nmathematics that I did.

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nMathOverflow is a question and answer site for professional mathematicians. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nIn light of my previous question, I am interested in the following scenario: Let $\\tilde Y$ be the blow-up of $Y=\\mathbb{P}^n$ along a linear subvariety $X\\subseteq Y$ of codimension $d$, i.e. $X\\cong\\mathbb{P}^{n-d}$. Let $E$ denote the exceptional divisor. Let $H$ be a hyperplane in $Y$ and denote by $P$ the strict transform. I am now interested in the degrees of $P^a E^b$ for $a+b=n$. The only thing related I could find was this post, but I am in a more general setting.\n\nPS: I am working over $\\mathbb{C}$, so you may assume that, or just any algebraically closed field, or less of course.\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 2 down vote accepted\n\nAssuming $H$ contains $X$, I think $P^{n-b} \\cdot E^b = (-1)^{b-1+\\dim X} {b-1 \\choose \\dim X}$, where $\\dim X = n-d$. One can, if one wishes, reduce to the case $a=0$ by letting $Y'$ be the intersection of $a$ generic hyperplanes through $X$, for then $P^a\\cdot E^b = (E|_{Y'})^b$. Or, without making this reduction, let $T=P+E$ be the total transform of $H$ in $\\tilde{Y}$, and note that (i) $E$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{d-1}$-bundle over $X$, (ii) $P|_E$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{d-2}$-subbundle over $X$, meeting every fiber of $E\\to X$ in a hyperplane, (iii) $T|_E$ is the pullback to $E$ of a hyperplane section of $X$. It follows geometrically that, if $a+b=n$, then $P^{a}\\cdot T^{b-1} \\cdot E = (P|_E)^{a}\\cdot (T|_E)^{b-1}$ equals 1 if $(a,b)=(d-1,n-d+1)$ and 0 otherwise. Then we can expand $P^a \\cdot E^b = P^a \\cdot (T-P)^{b-1} \\cdot E$ using multilinearity of the intersection form.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThis is great! However, why exactly is $P|_E^a\\cdot T|_E^{b-1} = 1$ iff $(a,b)=(d-1,n-d+1)$? You say it follows geometrically, but I cannot quite see it. Thanks a lot already and also in advance. \u2013\u00a0 Jesko H\u00fcttenhain Mar 9 '12 at 13:53\nIf I'm not mistaken, (ii) says $P|_E^a$ is represented by a $\\mathbb{P}^{d-a-1}$-subbundle over $X$, which is empty if $a>d-1$, and (iii) says $T|_E^{b-1}$ is represented by the preimage in $E$ of a linear $\\mathbb{P}^{n-d+1-b}$ in $X$, which is empty if $b>n-d+1$. If $(a,b)=(d-1,n-d+1)$, then $P|_E^a$ is a section of $E\\to X$ and $T|_E^{b-1}$ is a fiber, and these things meet transversally in one point. \u2013\u00a0 Tiankai Mar 9 '12 at 16:21\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nMathematics Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for people studying math at any level and professionals in related fields. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nIn reading my Lie algebra text, I see a lot of propositions starting with, \"If char F does not equal 2, then...\" For example, if char F does not equal 2, then o(n,F) is a subalgebra of sl(n,F).\n\nI am failing to see the importance in most cases. Could someone give me an example when char F = 2 will be the downfall? I was thinking about fields where x = -x but couldn't pinpoint the error. I'm sure it's a foolish miss on my part.\n\nThanks sincerely!\n\nshare|improve this question\nCharacteristic three is also problematic for Lie algebras. \u2013\u00a0 Mariano Su\u00e1rez-Alvarez Jan 26 '13 at 2:21\nCould you give an example? \u2013\u00a0 Phdetermined Jan 26 '13 at 2:22\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 1 down vote accepted\n\nOften times the reason things don't work out in char 2 is because in such fields $2x = 0$ does not imply $x = 0$. This is why for $o(n,F) \\subset sl(n,F)$ you need $char F \\ne 2$. The Lie algebra $o(n,F)$ is all $A$ such that $A + A^t = 0$. Taking the trace we see that $0 = tr(A + A^t) = tr(A) + tr(A^t) = 2tr(A)$. If $char F \\ne 2$ then we conclude that $tr(A) = 0$ so that $A \\in sl(n,F)$.\n\nEDIT: actually for $char \\ne 2$ any element in $o(n,F)$ must have zero along the diagonal since $A + A^t = 0$ implies that $2a = 0$ for any diagonal entry $a$. In particular the trace must be zero. But for $char = 2$ a skew-symmetric matrix can have an arbitrary diagonal.\n\nSo a similar example of where things get messed up in char 2 is that for char not equal to 2, the space of all matrices is the direct sum of anti-symmetric matrices and symmetric matrices. But in char 2 these spaces are the same since $A = A^t$ if and only if $A = -A^t$ since $1 = -1$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you. That helped clarify things. \u2013\u00a0 Phdetermined Jan 26 '13 at 2:17\nYour first sentence is somewhat tautological... \u2013\u00a0 Mariano Su\u00e1rez-Alvarez Jan 26 '13 at 2:25\n\nCharacteristic three is also problematic for Lie algebras. The appearence of the two characteristics is related to the fact that the identities that define Lie algebras \u2014antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity\u2014 are related to the symmetric groups of degree $2$ and $3$, and these have very simple representation theory except when the characteristic is $2$ or $3$.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI'm not very familiar with representation theory yet, but this is a fact I will keep in mind. \u2013\u00a0 Phdetermined Jan 26 '13 at 2:28\nMariano, does that have to do with the fact that $S_2,S_3$ are abelian grapes? \u2013\u00a0 Asaf Karagila Feb 4 '13 at 23:36\n\nYou hit the nail on the head with thinking \"x = -x\" because that is equivalent to 2x=0 for all x. I admit openly that I know little about Lie Algebras but I do understand the difficulty of char F = 2.\n\nIf char F = 2 the the field F is isomorphic to {0,1} so anytime you appeal to F all it offers is a 0 or a 1 and in that case it is probable your exercise will be rather trivial.\n\nIf you are interested in Galois Theory look up Keith Conrad's papers about finding Galois groups via discriminants. He always sets out with char <> 2.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThere are other fields of characteristic two aparto from $\\mathbf F_2$! \u2013\u00a0 Mariano Su\u00e1rez-Alvarez Jan 26 '13 at 2:19\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"Ask A Scientist\n\nWe've discovered that various types of radioactive particles produced during radioactive decay affect molecules in the cells\/tissues of our bodies. How are those molecules affected and what does that do to the cell\/tissue?\n\nAsked by: Seth Kane\nSchool: Sidney high school\nGrade: 11\nTeacher: David Pysnik\nHobbies\/Interests: Football, baseball and basketball\nCareer Interest: Design Engineering\n\nAnswer from Al Haber\n\nProfessor Emeritus of Biology, Binghamton Universi\n\nPh.D. School: University of Wisconsin\n\nResearch Area: Radiation biophysics\n\nInterests\/hobbies: classical music, reading, listening to and volunteering at WSKG.\n\nFamily: Wife, four grown children, one grandson\n\n\nNaturally occurring radioactivity consists primarily of (a) alpha particles, each like a helium-4 nucleus, with electric charge +2; (b) beta particles, each identical to the ordinary electron, with charge -1; and (c) gamma rays, which resemble X rays. The smallest gamma-ray energy packet is called a photon (as with light), and is uncharged. Cellular injury results from interaction between electrically charged subatomic particles and molecules. The orbital electrons (negative) are knocked out of molecules by alpha particles (positive) by attraction between the opposite charges, and by beta particles (negative) by repulsion of the like charges. By different mechanisms, a gamma-ray photon also knocks out an orbital electron. All these ejected electrons zoom away, and each can knock many additional electrons out of other molecules. In these electric interactions, the kinetic energy (energy of motion) of each alpha, beta, or ejected electron is incrementally \"cashed in\" to knock orbital electrons out of molecules, and give these ejected electrons their own kinetic-energy send-offs. Missing some orbital electrons, an affected molecule can undergo abnormal biochemical reactions. Also, a charged particle may boost an orbital electron to a higher energy level (still within the molecule), thereby also enabling the molecule to undergo abnormal reactions. The most important damage is in DNA: (a) misprints in \"genetic letters\" (A, T, G, C); (b) breaks in either or both strands, or abnormal cross links between the two strands, of the double helix; and (c) abnormal bonds between DNA and nearby molecules. Damage in replicating DNA may be a somatic mutation leading to cancer, or a germ-line mutation leading to a genetic defect in offspring. Also, chromosomes (larger structures containing DNA and other kinds of molecules) are broken, and the broken fragments may be lost during subsequent cell divisions. The fragments may also rejoin to make abnormal rearrangements. Thus cells are formed that must \"play without a complete deck\" of genes. In addition, inhibition of cell divisions prevents normal development of tissues and organs. Life on Earth has always been exposed to natural radioactivity (and to cosmic rays, which have similar actions), and all cells evolved multiple and redundant mechanisms to repair most damaged DNA. Multicellular organisms evolved a second line of defense: Many a dangerously damaged cell can be activated by healthy cells to \"commit suicide\" in a process called apoptosis. Both DNA repair and apoptosis also play important roles in many other situations in biology.\n\nLast Updated: 9\/18\/13",
