        "text":"Buyouts and Bootstraps\n\nThe microphone was old-fashioned, the kind with a ball of steel mesh on top. It made Alex feel silly, holding it; it was like a prop from some sort of seventies period piece. It was, he supposed, some sort of miracle that it didn\u2019t have an actual cord on it. He raised it to his mouth, wishing he\u2019d taken the time to practice with it.\n\nHe looked up. The office didn\u2019t have a proper all-hands area, so they were holding this one in the lobby; people were standing around him, and lining the stairs and the railing of the upper floor, looking bored but curious. Apparently the old CEO hadn\u2019t had all hands meetings, so everyone in support and IT was figuring this out.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said. There was a nasty echo from the mic; he winced, and there was a scramble from where the IT people were standing. His secretary, who\u2019d come with him, made a gesture that he interpreted as \u201cmove the mic further from your face.\u201d\n\nHe moved the mic further from his face. Someone was doing something with the soundboard.\n\nAlex gave a winning grin. A CEO should be able to be graceful under fire, he told himself.\n\nFriday night, he\u2019d gone back to his hotel room after dark. He was new to the city, and didn\u2019t have a place of his own yet, so he was living in the hotel across the street from the office; even that commute, down the elevator, across the cross walk, and up the elevator, had exhausted him.\n\nIt had been an exhausting week.\n\nCould it, he wondered, really have been just a week that he\u2019d been at this? He\u2019d always said that when opportunity knocked, the winners of history were those who answered and answered quickly, but the sheer speed with which this had happened had swept him up.\n\nThe previous week, he\u2019d been sitting in a restaurant in Baltimore, having lunch with a friend, Roger, and talking vaguely about what was next, when the news had come across the TV in the restaurant: A small corporate jet had crashed, three of the five board members of Auden Technologies aboard.\n\nThe two men and looked at one another, obviously with the same thought in mind.\n\nIt had been surprisingly easy: A classic leveraged buyout, borrowing enough money against Auden\u2019s value to buy enough stock to put him in the CEOs chair and he and Roger and a third friend, Doug, in Board seats.\n\nThe hotel room was one of those slide-cards that were starting to feel old-fashioned; everything else in Alex\u2019s life was a touch-pad with a card or fob. Something about the light going green, though, and the CHUNK sound, made his shoulders un-knot. He\u2019d lie down, watch something mindless on TV, go to sleep, and in the morning there\u2019d be breakfast.\n\nA light went on, in the far corner of the room. There was a well, if somberly, dressed woman sitting in a chair beside the window\n\n\u201cMister Michaels,\u201d said the woman. \u201cMy name is Martin.\u201d She pronounced it \u201cMar-teen,\u201d and Alex knew who she was: Head of a department inside Auden called \u201cExternal Security,\u201d which had a ridiculous budget and an extremely murky remit which didn\u2019t seem to have much to do with security. \u201cI\u2019m here to provide your weekly briefing.\u201d\n\nIt was all very dramatic, he had to admit; fine stage craft.\n\nAs far as Alex could tell, External Security was some sort of internal spy agency. The company had spent two decades producing knockoff products at the last possible minute: Some other company would bring an amazing technology to market, having spent years researching and developing it, only to find Auden delivering something remarkably similar, the same week.\n\nAuden had a reputation as an amazing innovator; Alex was learning the truth, that they were simply skilled at corporate espionage.\n\n\u201cMs Martin,\u201d he said, catching his breath. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re, here, we need to talk.\u201d\n\nAlex took a deep breath, and looked up at the people staring down at him from the top rows. \u201cSo that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom now on, it\u2019s just us: we\u2019ll have to do it on our own, without spooks and cheats. We\u2019re going to behave like a real tech company, do real research, create real products. And if we can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nWell, if they couldn\u2019t, then Alex was on the hook for quite a bit of money.\n\nHe looked around at his people, at his company, letting it hang there for a long beat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be strong, we will be quick, and we will create something like the world has never seen, but I need all of you to be clear that this is not the same company you\u2019ve been working for: Our future is staked, now, on innovation; our security is dependent on our quickness, our strenghth.\n\n\u201cBut I know that together, we\u2019ll make this work.\u201d\n\nHe lowered the mic, looked up, around. Everybody stared back.\n\nThe stock is down 30%.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s stabilized. It was in free fall at first.\u201d\n\nThe two men were sitting in a cafe, across a small table from one another. The place was an oasis of light and tranquility in the otherwise-bustling downtown; there were a lot of free tables, in the middle of the afternoon, and the people who were here seemed to be serious, mostly, about whatever they were reading or clicking on.\n\n\u201cIt was so\u2026 weird,\u201d said Alex. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 it was like someone sold a big chunk of our stock, but I can\u2019t see\u2026 none of the big shareholders seem to have shifted. I mean. It\u2019s like thousands of the smaller shareholders all suddenly sold shares to one another, at reduced price, right *before* I made the announcement\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, something spooky happened, is what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nAlex nodded miserably.\n\n\u201cSo, didn\u2019t you just stomp on a spook in your organization? It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s that hard to put this two and that two together to come up with four.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Ms. Martin had the kind of money we\u2019re talking about, I can\u2019t understand what she\u2019s doing working for an obscure branch of a small tech company\u2026\u201d\n\nRoger shrugged, expansively. His traditional role in these arguments was to argue for the simple path, the easy answer; Alex\u2019s role was to poke holes in it. Whoever turned out to be right, it was a useful exercise when running across a strange problem; lots of times the answer was not to waste resources doing anything, and that was Roger\u2019s default position.\n\nThere was something happening by the door that was getting more and more distracting: A group of people had come in, all wearing expensive-looking matching white bathrobes; they seemed to be walking around examining things, as though they were in a museum.\n\nLooking out the big windows, Roger could see that the street seemed to be full of white bathrobes.\n\nHe grinned. He had heard about the big random art things that happened here, and had been looking forward to seeing one for himself; certainly nothing like this happened in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cAlex,\u201d he said, and pointed at the bathrobe-people with his chin. Alex turned and looked, but didn\u2019t seem to take any joy in the spectacle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad some people have the leisure time to engage in\u2026 antics,\u201d he said, somewhat waspishly.\n\nRoger realized that he was grinning like a rube at the bathrobe people, and that they\u2019d noticed and were reacting appropriately: by pretending to ignore him. He approved.\n\n\u201cRoger, what am I supposed to do? I took a big gamble with this deal, making this company into a real, you know, thing, an innovator, and it turns out that they don\u2019t have untapped reserves of insight or whatever, they just have spies that tell them what to make next so\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cMy,\u201d said someone standing suddenly very close by, \u201cAren\u2019t they lifelike. So\u2026 businesssy. I love the lack of ties, it\u2019s very daring. They must be tech.\u201d\n\nRoger looked up at a tall, thin, blonde man with a beard who looked exactly like the popular conception of someone who lived on a trust fund and played tennis all day.\n\nIf it was a characterization, it was amazing. Roger wondered whether doing weird art stuff was the new tennis, for trust fund people.\n\nThe blonde man\u2019s companion, a matching slender blonde woman with long, wavy hair and pink bunny slippers under her bathrobe, leaned over and picked up a placard off of Roger and Alex\u2019s table. Roger would have sworn it hadn\u2019t been here before.\n\n\u201cBusinessmen,\u201d she read off the placard. \u201cResin, stress and bull feces, executed this year by O. VerVorked and N. Visibule, Amsterdam.\u201d She looked up at the two men, critically. \u201cThey\u2019re so lifelike, Erik. Can we get them? They\u2019d look so good in the beach condo in St. Moritz.\u201d She handed the placard to the man, Erik.\n\nThe man stared at them critically for a second and then called, \u201cExcuse me, proprietor, are these easily shipped? And can I have them charged to our rooms?\u201d\n\nThe exasperated barista, who appeared not to be in on the joke, shouted back, \u201cYou can\u2019t charge anything to your room, you don\u2019t have a room here.\u201d\n\nErik\u2019s mouth made a slight downward curve, his eyebrows doing something disapproving, and then he shrugged. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cThat\u2019s that, you can\u2019t always get what you want, in a place like this.\u201d He set the placard down on the table.\n\nThe woman looked like she was close to throwing some sort of temper tantrum, but let herself be led away, out of the coffee shop.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Roger. \u201cThat was super.\u201d He picked up the placard; it looked just like something you\u2019d see attached to a piece of sculpture in a museum.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re amused,\u201d said Alex, gathering his things. \u201cI have to get back to work, there are actual people who notice if I\u2019m not in\u2026\u201d he stopped, suddenly, staring at a card.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Roger set the museum placard back down on the table, then reached over and took the card from Alex\u2019s hand.\n\nIt was glossy black on one side, and had a fancy-looking governmental seal\u200a\u2014\u200ahe\u2019d seen it before: the Eagle\u2019s head and sunburst on a shield, with \u201cCentral Intelligence Agency\u201d around the outside. The card was for someone identified as \u201cRagnar Danneskjold,\u201d who was apparently assistant to the Director of Operations.\n\nThe back of the card was plain white; someone with extremely good penmanship had written \u201cAre you sure? Call me,\u201d in thick blue ink.\n\nLook, I ju... (truncated)",

        "text":"Written by Global Citizen\n\nPrint this\n\nSunday, 16 September 2007\n\nimage for 'Markets - Give me a Break!': Bernanke\n\nWell, we are almost there for the all important September 18th Federal Reserve meeting to review the benchmark Fed. rate. And as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, I am forced to write this piece as I look at the madness that's been generated over this meeting.\n\nWell, one may wonder why I picked Spoof when 'you-name-it' news sites all over the world that claim to know what markets want have dissected each word of mine and that of other board-members to recommend us what decision we should take and analyzed further its impacts on financial markets, on sub-prime issue, on liquidity and credit availability and finally on the all-important economic growth. The reasons are obvious - only Spoof offers me the freedom that I badly need to share my thoughts. I will serve my purpose; and I don't want markets to react unnecessarily before that 18th decision as well.\n\nSince last one month or so, I have read 'n' number of articles that stated markets expect interest rates would be cut by a minimum of 25 basis points on 18th; and by year end, by close to 75 bps. Many played with the figures by 0.5% and 1.0% respectively. Many even gave interesting median estimations (with other statistical jargons that make no sense) on what economists told them. And majority of these economists came from the Investment Banking community or from Hedge Funds.\n\nI have nothing against those articles and its recommendations and expectations. Many academicians even gave Fed. an 'F' for our mishandling of sub-prime issue. Again absolutely fine, honestly I myself do agree that we deserve that (if not an expulsion, I favor an expulsion that Fed. should be closed!). However my sole submission is that grading is based on performance of Federal Reserves over last six years - i.e. when interest rates were brought down to 1% to boost consumption and economic growth. Many scholars complete their PhDs in five years; whereas markets and academicians took more time to give us a rating on our past performance after six years! I wonder what grades they deserve for their timely judgments!\n\nFreedom of speech is a fundamental right. However I am at a loss to interpret the loud drums that's playing in the so-called markets that blurt out the same theme again and again - 'markets expect Fed. To cut interest rates'. In Google search; you will find millions of news articles covering that - not only in our homeland, but in almost all parts of the world. Initially I laughed, then I felt angry, then a bit frustrated and now I am little perplexed at the stupid audacity of the self-proclaiming prophecy when some one says some thing like 'markets expect'. Eventually I understood that it's a lobby group that wants us to know that markets expect Fed. to bail out markets!\n\nSounds a bit funny - isn't it! Did Saddam expected US to bail him out? Probably no. Does Osama bin Laden expect that the US will bail him out for his adventurous actions? Probably no again. The voices against this lobby, though weak because they don't have the money power that markets command, also said that our parents told us not to play with fire - be it with Weapons of Mass Destructions or Terrorism or even with Money matters. And if we still decide to play with fire; we should not be complaining of getting our fingers burnt. So these academic voices warned that Fed. should not send a signal by proving all parental advices are wrong because markets want them to be wrong.\n\nSo I read it this way - the rich expects to get richer and Fed. to help them; the fund managers expect Fed. to help him\/her so that they can show bumper trading profits with riskier instruments and leveraged position to earn huge bonus; the sub-prime lender expects Fed. to help them out as they struggle with forfeited properties with no takers in a falling market.\n\nDoes the poor (around 12% of the US population) expect to get poorer? No one talks about that because their voices seldom get heard? I guess not. Does the people who have not yet bought their American dream homes because prices have shoot up too high beyond their means should be left without the chance by maintaining prices artificially high thro' a bail out? And by sheer numbers, this group has more people than the rich, the fund-managers and the aggressive lenders, or even the struggling end home-buyer.\n\nIf prices fall now, many would be able to buy house again in future. And if prices don't fall; many will never be able to own a house in their life time.\n\nI agree that a terminally ill cancer patient can't flex his\/her muscle. However we need to make a choice today whether this 'Fiat' Fractional Banking led system has indeed driven US economy to the stage of a terminally ill patient; or we can survive with our strong will and determination as we have done many times in the past.\n\nMany called me 'Helicopter Bernanke' because they expected me to distribiute Dollar from a helicopter so that everyone gets enough money and no one complains. Many expected the 'Greenspan Put' era to continue. Both are not feasible for ever.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I have my empathies for the real Americans who today are struggling with their mortgages (or even lost their homes). It's indeed satirical that when we face economic slowdown; we ask the not-so-well-off section to consume more, to spend more, to dream big so that economy can grow and come out of recession. We rearward those consumptions and dreams with asset bubbles, and low supporting interest rates. The rich always have been consuming more and they can't consume any more, in all likelihood. So we have used the struggling section with the pawns of 'grow rich' scenario once in every five or so years. They also don't believe us easily now-a-days. So initially they doubt our commitments - they take time to decide to consume more, dream big. But as they wait and watch; the rich creates the asset bubbles. The poor wonders 'this time it must be for real'. And they finally join. And the bubble bursts. Interest rates tighten; and they again are shattered. And they complain - 'I was happier by consuming less and without dreams; you created environment for me to consume more and dream big. And when I have just started; you rob me by creating the totally opposite scenario.' It has some merit, and we can't and shouldn't ignore those weak voices of many.\n\nSo I am against bailing out this so-called lobby group that apparently knows what markets want. I wonder if anyone ever can know what markets want - even for a day, for an hour or for a year. By claiming that they declare that a few large investment bankers control the markets - their voices are those of the markets' voices. Which itself is a lie and failure of markets. They live in a fool's world; and expect that they can influence any with the strength of their money power. They eventually mean that they knew that this crisis was predestined; and markets whisper to the ears of the rich and super-rich.\n\nAlternatively, even if one thinks that these guys indeed know what the market wants where in Fed., we struggle hard to find what's good and healthy for the markets for the long term and short term. And we don't deny that we do make mistakes; and if these lobby-groups are to be believed; they expect markets expectations are rational, logical and are never wrong. As common people, we know it to be otherwise. The American people also want our troops to return from Iraq; and it definitely sounds more authentic that 'market wants' statements. Does that mean we pull back our troops starting today? Or even take more controversial 'Bush-impeachment'. Majority probably favors that - does it mean we allow public to take over judiciary and impeach President Bush?\n\nIn above cases, we find nothing wrong when Federal policies and systems work against those of the citizens. Then why we expect Federal Reserves to listen and deliver what this so-called market expects thing.\n\nThere is something called an infeasible region for many problems if constraints are self-contradictory. It's a challenge for any Central banker following Fractional Reserves Banking to keep inflation and unemployment low; and growth rate moderate to high. When one adds bailing out the rich on top of that difficult problem; one surely lands in no real solution zones.\n\nThat does not mean that we have not deliberated over the issues in Federal Reserves. The best course of action which we will love to take, but can't is kill the investment bankers like J P Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldmann Sachs, Lehman Brothers and that lot. They are the root of the problem and they are not like the heart or the liver of our indispensable global body. They rather are the tumors. There would be some pain as the large investment bankers, hedge funds and Private Equity players die; but their death would indeed herald a new and better financial world with stability and less inequality. If one documents the malpractices these investment bankers have adopted in last couple of decades to earn profit by playing and leveraging money alone; that would put Hitler's records as most kind and humane.\n\nSo we in federal Reserves believe deep in our hearts that we should not bail out these tumors; and prove the lessons our parents taught us to be wrongs. However we have plans to bail out the struggling end-borrower; the house owner who are finding it difficult to pay their monthly installments. And our calculations also show it makes better monetary sense. By keeping interest rate high for manipulators; we earn more (meaning we can afford lower Money Supply) and a fraction of that can be used to subsidize the retail customer - partly or even fully. One may question our profit motive; but if the investment bankers so long used our other motives to make profit by cheating their customers; why we ourselves don't adopt that model for a change for so...

        "text":"Chapter 1\n\n\nThe sun rises rude and intense and disregarding of a headache that presses dully with each heartbeat. I try to hide my face in the pillow but without the blinds drawn it is like trying to stay dry under a waterfall.\n\nI surrender and go through the routine: coffee, shower, clothes sticking to a wet back. I pause to look at myself in the bathroom mirror. Steam hazes my image, but I see a man who looks older than I remember, bruised under eyes that are dark and veiled with sleep. The jaw is set in a hard line. The mirror-man used to smile sometimes, sometimes growl, sometimes look playfully back, but more and more he looks like this man, tired and aging.\n\nBefore I leave I go in to kiss her. She is awake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m off to work,\u201d I say, \u201cI hope you have a good day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou too,\u201d she replies, throwing off the covers. \u201cCan you put the kettle on before you leave?\u201d\n\nA nod and a trip down the stairs, kettle switched on, followed by the long drive to work, NPR talking in energetic voices about the emerging news of the day.\n\nThe office is one of those open-air ones meant to imply some sort of equality, with the executives working next to the office managers and junior sales associates. It certainly has the air of equality \u2014 so long as one doesn\u2019t compare paystubs or the gender of the leadership. It\u2019s a tech startup, the kind of company that has transformed my hometown in Eastern Colorado from a once-sleepy mountain town full of hippies and cowboys into a hipster and Tesla-filled upwardly mobile, increasingly crowded region.\n\nMy position is in marketing, that slippery first cousin of advertising. I\u2019m the Content Marketing Manager, a fancy way to say I get paid to write stuff that drives customers into the wide end of a marketing funnel, not unlike those giant fishing nets cast by professional fisherman designed to catch as many fish as possible, never minding the occasionally drown dolphin or sea turtle. \u00a0\n\nI nod at my team, take my seat, open my laptop and then stare at it blankly. It\u2019s Monday and we have our weekly marketing meeting at 9:30.\u00a0 I pass the 45-minutes in an under-caffeinated crawl of pretend work, until we are finally summoned into the large and modernist conference room dubbed \u201cThe Rectangle\u201d. Clever, since the room is, in fact, a rectangle.\n\nWe take seats around the large table, a beautiful single cut of exotic wood with slivers of glass through the middle of it. My boss, Steve, is 8 years younger than me. He\u2019s an executive vice president, or EVP, which means he\u2019s very ambitious and very good at his job, since most EVP\u2019s are in their early 40\u2019s to early 50\u2019s. He\u2019s a blonde, youthful-looking man prone to wearing tucked-in checkered shirts with designer skinny jeans squeezed over heavy legs. His face is an oval and he likes to wear that universal badge of hipsterhood, the groomed beard. He is the kind of man who gets his hair cut every two weeks, so it never changes in its perfect, gel-infused breaking blonde wave. Steve has the California habit of ending every third or fourth sentence on an up-note, making statements sound strangely like questions?\n\nHe is speaking, and with effort I pay attention. \u201c\u2026so the thing is when we look at inbound marketing streams and how they impact the bottom line we need to look for is metrics, of course \u2013 how do we measure marketing success, right? Now we haven\u2019t done a good job of that yet (we\u2019ve been understaffed \u2014 which isn\u2019t an excuse) but now we have the right team in place and so we can put those metrics in place to see what kinds of impacts we\u2019re having before an inbound lead gets handed off to a BDR on the way to becoming an MQL, and our results from last quarter stand up pretty well (I\u2019m glad we have Jamie now to handle this better than I could)? So we\u2019re in good shape, but we can do better, right? So for today, let\u2019s go around and talk about where you are in supporting this quarter\u2019s MQLs and SQLs, with the purpose of making sure we\u2019re not getting too siloed in our roles but are working in ways that are making the team operate as one. Not that we don\u2019t have our own projects. But I\u2019m concerned that our siloes \u2014 our swim lanes \u2014 are too narrowly focused? So while Logan is mainly in charge of MQLs. Jen really takes over halfway through the sales cycle converts them into SQL\u2019s for the BDR\u2019s, and Jamie tracks our ROI and engagement along the way so we can track our success (not that it\u2019s always trackable week-to-week) so we can dynamically steer marketing. So we have some big projects coming up in Q2, so let\u2019s start with Logan and get everything onto the table.\u201d\n\nI clear my throat. Fucking marketing acronyms. BDR\u2019s. SQL\u2019s. MQL\u2019s. RFP\u2019s. CPC\u2019s. CR\u2019s. ROI\u2019s. USP\u2019s. They are endless, and in most meetings half a dozen get dropped. I say my bit for the meeting. With all due modesty, I\u2019m a good writer and my job is largely about writing. But when it comes to fitting into a company culture, in presenting things inside of the accepted siloes of communication, in working as part of a team, and in giving a flying fuck about a corporate mission, I\u2019m afraid my experience is as lacking as my heart. Yet I speak with relative competency about a piece of paid content I am creating for the company to get more emails for our list, and people interested in an upcoming webinar. All stuff that generates MQL\u2019s, or market qualified leads \u2014 which can, in turn, lead to 5 or 6-figure accounts for the company.\n\nJamie is a young Korean woman who joined the company after me, as sharp and fast as a guillotine, her intense drive filtered through often-dismissive Millennial sarcasm. I\u2019m a little scared of her.\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d she says, a finger twirling around a long strand of black hair, cured at the ends. Her eyes roll from her computer to me, without any movement of her head. \u201cSo, like, you\u2019re going to write that up this week?\u201d I know, somehow, that she went to Oral Roberts University, which makes her and me not just different kinds of people but a different species altogether.\u00a0\n\nI nod. Jamie has black, thigh-high socks and a blue skirt, but when she sits and crosses her legs like she is now, there is an exposed, 4-inch gap of skin that I try not to notice. An off-white blouse comes down each shoulder and is secured up to the modest second-to-last button. A gold crucifix hangs from her neck just above the chasm of her cleavage.\n\n\u201cSo, uh, are you, like, setting up metrics to track the inward bound traffic to see where people are coming from when they get to it?\u201d She puts on a pair of designer glasses with sharp black frames. \u00a0\n\nI look around the table. Jen, another young female colleague who is blonde and blue eyed and recently a mother, is staring hard at her computer screen. Steve is looking at me, a groomed eyebrow raised in anticipation. I\u2019m a relatively new hire, after all, and one he made, so my competency is a direct reflection on him.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I say, stalling and thinking, \u201cYes.\u201d I pause. I then make a tactical decision to not bullshit, because I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll get busted. \u201cBut I could use a little help in getting that set up.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Steve says, quickly. \u201cJamie, can you help Logan with that?\u201d\n\nShe sighs and there is the tiniest roll of her eyes. \u201cOf course.\u201d I reflexively put my hand on my neck.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve says, \u201cThanks, Logan. Jen, do you want to walk us through where you are in supporting the BDR\u2019s?\u201d\n\nI exhale.",

        "text":"The Original Macintosh:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a059 of 132\u00a0\nThe Little Kingdom\nAuthor: Andy Hertzfeld\nDate: December 1982\nCharacters: Dan Kottke, Steve Jobs, Jef Raskin, Mike Moritz\nTopics: The Press, Personality\nSummary: Steve Jobs was almost 1982's Man of the Year\nSteve on the cover of Time\n\nThe February 15th, 1982 edition of Time magazine featured none other than Steve Jobs on its cover, appearing in an article entitled \"Striking It Rich: America's Risk Takers\". Instead of a photograph, Steve was depicted in a drawing with a red apple balanced on his head that was pierced by a zig-zag bolt of light emanating from an Apple II.\n\nThe article inside focused on a number of high tech start-ups, but there was a long sidebar that told the story of Apple's meteoric rise, written by a young business reporter named Mike Moritz. It was a bit critical in places (\"As an executive, Jobs has sometimes been petulant and harsh on subordinates\"), but in general it was positive about the company and its prospects.\n\nMacintosh development was shrouded in secrecy, even within Apple, so we were surprised one day a few months later when Steve appeared in the software area of Bandley 4 accompanied by the Time reporter, Mike Moritz. Steve requested that I give him a demo of the Macintosh, and answer all of his questions. Apparently, Mike wanted to write a book about Apple, and managed to convince Steve to give him total access to the company, including the Macintosh team.\n\n\"Mike's going to be our historian,\" Steve informed us, \"so you can tell him everything. Treat him like he's a member of the team, because he's going to write our story for us.\"\n\nThe previous year, a development team at Data General was immortalized by Tracy Kidder's best selling book, \"The Soul of a New Machine\", about the ups and downs of developing a new mini-computer. Now it seemed like Mike Moritz was going to do something similar for the Mac team.\n\nOver the next few months, Mike spent lots of time hanging around the Mac team, attending various meetings and conducting interviews over lunch or dinner, to learn our individual stories. Mike had grown up in South Wales and attended Oxford before moving to the US for grad school, obtaining an MBA from Wharton. He was in his mid-twenties, about the same age as most of us, and was very smart, with a sharp, cynical sense of humor, so he fit right in, and seemed to understand what we were trying to accomplish.\n\nIn December 1982, word somehow got around that Time Magazine was considering awarding Steve Jobs its prestigious \"Man of the Year\" designation for 1982. Mike Moritz, who was by now Time's San Francisco Bureau Chief, came down to Apple for another round of interviews, as background for the lengthy \"Man of the Year\" story. But we were in for a surprise when the award was announced the last week of the year.\n\nInstead of crowning Steve Jobs as the Man of the Year as we expected, Time's editorial staff gave the designation to \"The Computer\", declaring 1982 to be the \"year of the computer\" and explaining that \"it would have been possible to single out as Man of the Year one of the engineers or entrepreneurs who masterminded this technological revolution, but no one person has clearly dominated those turbulent events. More important, such a selection would obscure the main point. TIME's Man of the Year for 1982, the greatest influence for good or evil, is not a man at all. It is a machine: the computer.\"\n\nThe cover story did include another profile of Steve Jobs, containing some comments that were less than complimentary. One unspecified friend was quoted saying \"something is happening to Steve that's sad and not pretty\", but the best quote was attributed to Jef Raskin: \"He would have made an excellent King of France.\"\n\nSteve became quite upset when he read an advance copy of the Time article on New Year's eve, and even called up Dan Kottke and Jef Raskin early on New Year's Day to complain to them about it. Soon, Mike Moritz was no longer welcome on the Apple campus; in fact, Steve told the software team \"if any one of you ever talk to him again, you'll be fired on the spot!\"\n\nBut some of us talked with Mike again surreptitiously, as he was putting the finishing touches on his book around the time of the Mac introduction. The book, entitled \"The Little Kingdom: The Private Story of Apple Computer\", was published in fall of 1984; twenty years later it remains one of the best books about Apple Computer ever written.\n\nPerhaps inspired by the example of Steve Jobs and Apple, Mike Moritz switched careers in 1986 to become a venture capitalist, working for Don Valentine at Sequoia, one of the original investors in Apple. Mike became the original investor in Yahoo in April 1995, convincing Jerry Yang and David Filo to commercialize their web directory, and today is one of the most respected VCs in the industry.\n\nBoot Beep\nBack to The Original Macintosh\nLittle Rubber Feet\n\nAccount Name:\n\n\nCreate new account\nRelated Stories\nOverall Rating:\u00a04.30\n\nYour rating:",
