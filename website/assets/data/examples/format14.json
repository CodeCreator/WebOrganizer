        "text":"Glen BolesGlen was born in St.Stephen, New Brunswick, in 1934 and moved to Calgary in 1953. As a child all his spare time was spent either drawing, taking part in sports or roaming the woods. In 1957 he was persuaded to go climbing by fellow worker mountain climber Heinz Kahl, a native Bavarian. With Kahl and English climber Brian Greenwood he was introduced to the more difficult side of climbing, by 1960 he began to take it seriously.Glen Boles\n\nGlen has taken part in many facets of mountaineering from expedition climbing to mountain rescue and since the early days, he has climbed in the St Elias Range of the Yukon and Alaska, the Alps of Europe and extensively in the Rockies and the Interior Ranges of British Columbia, summiting close to 600. His first love though are the Canadian Rockies where he has topped out on over 450 peaks including many new routes and first ascents. During this time his pencils, pens and brushes had to take a back seat.\n\nAlso an avid skier, he has enjoyed cross country skiing, ski mountaineering as well as downhill skiing over the years. He spent 13 years on the Canadian Ski Patrol System and is now a member of the Ski Friends program at the Lake Louise ski area.\n\nGlen BolesGlen is now retired after spending thirty five and a half years with the City of Calgary Waterworks Engineering Division, the last eighteen years as the Waterworks Planner. He has been married to his wife Elizabeth since 1965 and resides in Cochrane, Alberta. Since retiring, he has resumed his interest in art, drawing in pen and pencil and painting with water colours and acrylics.\n\nFrom his mountaineering experiences, Glen has also developed a keen interest in photography and writing as well as art, these have evolved as enjoyable sidelines. Over the years he has built up a large collection of mountain photos in both colour and black and white to work from.\n\nGlen BolesGlen is the author of a book titled \u201cGlen Boles My Mountain Album\u201c. This book of his black and white photography and his art was published in 2006.\n\nHe was also co-author with Bill Putnam and Roger Laurilla of two editions of \u201cThe Climbers Guide to the Canadian Rockies-South\u201d and \u201cPlace Names of the Canadian Alps\u201d, renamed \u201cPlace Names of the Canadian Mountains\u201d for the second edition. He attributes his enjoyment in the mountains to the freedom to explore, to keep fit and to think young.\n\nGlen is an Honorary Member of the Alpine Club of Canada, the American Alpine Club and the Calgary Mountain Club. He acted as honorary president of the Alpine Club of Canada from 2005-2009. During the Banff Mountain Film Festival of 2005, Glen received the Bill March \u201cSummit of Excellence Award\u201d for his contribution to Canadian mountaineering.",

Cardenas\n\nOf Counsel\n\nGreg Cardenas has been providing legal services in the health care industry for over 25 years, but becoming a lawyer was not his original career plan.\u00a0 After graduating from Texas A&M University with a degree in finance, Greg went to work in the budget and planning office of Texas Governor William Clements. It was there that Greg saw how experienced attorneys analyzed problems, developed reasoned solutions, and persuaded others to support their solutions.\u00a0 Greg went to law school to develop those skills, and he uses them to serve clients on a full spectrum of corporate, transactional, and regulatory matters.\n\nGreg\u2019s practice is transactional in nature, and is concentrated in the healthcare sector. Greg works with physicians, hospitals, management and development companies, diagnostic and therapeutic healthcare providers, and investors and investment companies that work with healthcare companies. \u00a0He has assisted clients on a variety of matters including entity formation and capitalization; corporate governance and governing document preparation and negotiation; joint venture negotiation and regulatory structuring; business combinations, and purchases and sales of equity and assets; compliance program development and implementation; and civil and criminal fraud and abuse issues arising under state and federal health care fraud and abuse laws.\u00a0 Greg has served as the Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of both a publicly traded company that owned and operated an integrated health care delivery system, and a national supply chain services company that served the non-acute health care industry. Greg regularly acts as outside legal counsel and board advisor to small and medium sized companies.\n\nOutside the office, Greg enjoys golf and spending time with his wife Anna and their four daughters.\u00a0 He has served on, or consults with, several charitable and non-profit boards, including the Notre Dame School of Dallas, St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic School, Ursuline Academy, and Stairs, Inc.\n\nCredentials & Experience\n\nLearn more about your compliance partner.\n\n\n  \u2022 Texas A&M University, B.B.A. Finance (1986)\n  \u2022 Texas Tech University School of Law, J.D., Magna Cum Laude, Law Review (1995)\n\n\n  \u2022 Texas State Bar\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, District of Colorado\n  \u2022 U.S. Tax Court\n\nWant to learn more about ByrdAdatto?\n\nContent by Greg A.

This leads him to dive more and more into the main spirit of his images.\n\nThis result is conceivable according to him only if the realisation of a series is preceded by a long maturation. Between the birth of an idea and the first shot, the photographer takes the time to think, observe and conduct research to define the most important points of his project.\n\nThis meticulous work is prolonged during the execution by a critical analysis of his first tests that he renews until obtaining the desired result.\n\nFaced with what our eyes see, from time to time our brain chooses to retain only a part of reality. We discover lost details that I focus on, to the point of understanding the essence of their beauty.\n\nFrom this reality, graphic images of great purity are born\n\n\ninstagram \/ facebook\n\nBack To Top",

One could say that my passion and profession converged and blogging and podcasting became the road on which I continue my self-discovery.\n\nMarket research, industry research, knowledge and information management, social media, political analysis, technology, consulting; are some of the topics that interest me. It interests me to know how these things impact our daily lives and business decisions such as branding, advertising, marketing, product & service design and public relations.\n\nBeing a part of the information age has also made me look at all technology and its evolution from the legacy internet on dial-up connection to the present day wireless connection and touch based applications that is driving the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data revolution towards driver-less cars and extreme automation.\n\nMy interests drive my blog and podcasts and I continue discovering new things through reading and research.\n\nThis has fueled a habit of projecting the future and then testing the projection through direct observation.\n\nWhy Game Theori?\n\nIt started as an experiment to share ones thoughts. Over time it has also enabled a personal learning with a desire to make it a platform for professionals from all industries to share their knowledge and learning to guide new entrants into industry and make the transition from academia to industry smooth.\n\nSo if you are a person or an organization interested in such topics do stick around and if you have a demand for a particular topic do let me know.\n\nI would love to work with other professionals and organizations on solutions that have tangible impact and benefit. I can be contacted at sriram@gametheori.com and I look forward to suggestions as well as constructive criticism to improve.",
