She always enjoyed putting a smile on people\u2019s faces and now she gets to work with families to help them find the perfect home where they can grow or downsize.\n\nWhen she started doing this job, Jessica determined that buying a home is something people should never feel rushed into. She says it\u2019s important to take your time because buying a home is such a huge decision. She believes it\u2019s really important to make sure you truly love a home before making any decisions about buying it.\n\nJessica also really loves working with sellers. Her secret tip for home sellers: Stage your home! Many people look at homes on the internet and seeing a home furnished makes them picture their own family in that house.\n\nWhen Jessica is away from work, she spends time with her husband, four kids who are still at home (plus one adult daughter when she\u2019s able to visit!), and dog Axl. She enjoys many coastal activities that are part of life on the Shore. She loves traveling with her family and kayaking on the water. She regularly volunteers with various organizations to help in the community, as does her husband who is a volunteer firefighter. Aside from their five children, Jessica and her husband have also chosen to be a foster parent for nine years. She loves having the opportunity to help and care for others.\n\nJessica Lewis, Eastern Shore Realtor, with her family\n\nJessica Lewis, Eastern Shore Realtor, with her husband\n\nIf you would like to chat with Jessica to see if she\u2019s the right Realtor for you, just shoot us a message!\n\nJessica Lewis, Realtor at Powell Realtors, shares photos of her family enjoying the Eastern Shore lifestyle",

        "text":"Noel Grealish his story....\n\nNoel Grealish grew up in a large Carnmore family of nine boys and one girl.\n\nLike so many in the West of Ireland, many of the Grealish family had to emigrate in search of work \u2014 at one point there were seven of them abroad, and currently Noel has three siblings living in Boston and one each in Copenhagen, Chicago and Nebraska.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working hard, travelling to and from the D\u00e1il, helping people at his constituency office in Briarhill or meeting constituents in their own communities, hurling is one of Noel\u2019s passions \u2014 he is currently chairman of the Carnmore club. He also enjoys skiing (though not in Carnmore!), golf, and travelling to the US to meet up with his family.\n\nConsidering his name, it\u2019s no surprise that Noel\u2019s birthday is in December, and his most recent one was a milestone, his 50th.\n\nApart from representing the interests of the people of Galway as an elected TD, he has enjoyed meeting world figures like the late Ted Kennedy and, more recently, Prince Charles and Pope Francis, with whom he had a private audience.\n\nOutside of politics, Noel established the Galway Glass Centre, which traded at Briarhill Business Park until 2012.\n\n\nNoel began his political career when he was elected to Galway County Council in 1999 as a member of the Progressive Democrats and in 2002 he stood for election to the D\u00e1il, following the retirement from national politics of Bobby Molloy, one of the founding members of the PDs.\n\nThe election campaign in Galway West was a lesson in electoral strategy.\n\nNoel secured 2,700 first preference votes and still managed to get elected, largely thanks to strong transfers in subsequent counts from party colleagues, city councillors Donal Lyons and Declan McDonnell. Indeed it was transfers from the surplus votes of current President Michael D Higgins that gave him the final push he needed to be elected on the last count.\n\nNoel stood for re-election in 2007 and, at a time when his party\u00a0 suffered from a fall in support, he more than doubled his personal vote to 5,806, a tribute to his hard work.\n\nAfter the break-up of the PDs in 2009, Noel stood as an Independent candidate, again enjoying huge support from the people of Galway and increasing his vote further to 6,229.\n\nHe has campaigned hard during his time in the D\u00e1il on priority issues like the prevention of crime, improving access to hospitals and other medical services, fast tracking the delivery of additional housing stock, practical solutions to Galway\u2019s traffic problems, continuing to secure funding for flood alleviation measures in Galway, measures to protect and increase employment in Galway, and adequate funding for people with disabilities and disability services.\n\n\n\nConstituency Office - Briarhill Business Park, Galway.
