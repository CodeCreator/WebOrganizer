        "text":"One of the most exciting things about the upcoming Overwatch Anniversary event, as with most events, will be the new skins coming to our favorite characters. But one character in particular has been singled out for being the recipient of a particularly captivating new skin: Symmetra. As a Symmetra main, when the news of this new skin broke courtesy of Jeff Kaplan on the Overwatch forum I peed myself a little bit due to my excitement. I love, love, LOVE Symmetra. As someone who grew up playing all sorts of multiplayer FPS nonsense I\u2019ve found her to be one of the most unique characters in any FPS ever. Known mostly as a defensive\/support stalwart, Symmetra can also be devastating on assault (if you\u2019ve ever watched Steveooo do his thing you know what I\u2019m talking about). But her skins are a bit lacking (more on that below).\n\nSo, when I was invited to be part of Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch Anniversary media event in NYC I had one thing on my mind: the new skin. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t get a preview during the presentation but we did get a chance to talk to Game Director Jeff Kaplan during a QnA. My hand shot up immediately. Knowing he couldn\u2019t reveal anything specific about the fabled skin I went with something more vague. I asked him, on a scale of 1-to-10, how happy would Symmetra mains be with the new skin. His eyes lit up. He smiled a wide, knowing smile.\n\n\u201cOn a scale of 1-to-10? Easily a ten,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cif not 11.\u201d\n\nKaplan then told a quick story about the unveiling of the skin. He said that soon after Lead Character Concept Artist Arnold Tsang showed the skin to Blizzard team members in a meeting, they immediately left the room and made the image their desktop backgrounds \u201cbecause it\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n\nWhile we still don\u2019t know what the skin is going to look like, it will likely be part of a set of skins coming in the Overwatch Anniversary update based on some datamining shared in this reddit post. Reaper, Tracer, Orisa and Sombra also seem to be in line to get some new skins, too.\n\nBut this is about Symmetra dammit! So, in honor of her \u201ceasily a ten\u201d skin coming the Overwatch Anniversary event I\u2019ve decided to share with you my personal picks for the top three skins currently available to Overwatch fans.\n\nSymmetra Skin #1: Qipao Skin\n\nSymmetra Qipao Better red than dead. Creative Commons\n\nFar and away my favorite Symmetra skin, the Qipao was only available during the Year of the Rooster Event in TK. Why do I like it so much? Because, to me, Symmetra is all about class. She\u2019s a brilliant, cosmopolitan woman in a near-future full of advanced tech. She\u2019s a lady. And this elegant red qipao, inlaid with delicate gold patterns, conveys the high-class vibe I feel is a big part of Symmetra as a character.\n\nSymmetra Skin #2: Utopaea Skin\n\nSymmetra Utopaea Too pure for this world. Creative commons\n\nThis skin combines the classy lassy look I like for Symmetra while delivering a nice side order of lore. Utopaea refers to a Vishkar city built using the \u201chard light\u201d tech seen in Symmetra\u2019s attacks and abilities. It\u2019s easy to imagine the \u201cJewel of the Vishkar\u201d as a bright, shining city if this is the kind of clothing people wear there. Or maybe the white and gold color scheme just reminds me of my favorite Power Ranger?\n\nSymmetra Skin #3: Devi Skin\n\nSymmetra Devi Controversial? Sure. Badass? Absolutely. Creative Commons\n\nSymmetra\u2019s legendary Devi skin came with a bit of controversy. A prominent Hindu leader called for removal of the skin last year, essentially saying it blasphemes the image of a Hindu deity. Blizzard apparently agrees to disagree with that assessment as the controversy came and went without the skin being pulled. Me personally? I just like the skulls.",

It'll almost make you as queasy to watch digital Megatron crumple after a hit as it would to watch real life Calvin Johnson tear as an ACL. Almost.\n\nBut the violence of most sports games in 2012 is based on a need to resemble reality (and comply with the rules of the leagues that gave their licenses to the game companies). The games of the past didn't have the technology we have today, but they did have imagination and easy-to-sign celebrity endorsers, which combined to make some of the weirdest, most violent games of all-time, sports or otherwise.

        "text":"The Gentleman, Hustler, Rounder, and Moneymaker: Influencing Pop Culture and Poker\n\nHow has \u00a0poker influenced the pop culture as a whole?\n\nWith the heavy influence of mass media, popular culture or pop culture has affected our everyday lives. These are ideas, images, perspectives, and phenomena that embody society. From gentlemen to online phenomena, here are some people, fiction and non-fiction, who made their mark on pop culture.\n\nThe Gentleman Player: Mark Twain\n\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens or {Mark Twain} has heavily influenced pop culture through his wit and humor. Who could forget his great classics like \u201cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\u201d \u201cThe Prince and the Pauper,\u201d and \u201cA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court.\u201d Aside from writing, he was also an avid poker player. Since he grew up along the river banks of the Mighty Mississippi, Mark was exposed to this card game and grew fond of it. In his book \u201cLife on the Mississippi\u201d, he told the story of four robbers who planned to outwit and rob a farmer in a poker match. However, the farmer proved to be a wiser opponent and defeated them in at their own game. Although, Mark Twain always showed his disgust towards professional gamblers in his stories, he hailed the regular card players. He believed that a player should always be a gentleman, who showed control, moderation, and propriety in every game.\n\n\n\nThe Hustler and Mutant: Gambit\n\nKnown as the \u201cLe Diable Blanc\u201d (The White Devil), Gambit is one of the X-Men\u2019s most famous characters. His Cajun-inspired humor, good looks, and hypnotic charm earned him the 65th spot on IGN\u2019s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time. Aside from his card-throwing skills and ability to turn them into kinetically-charged weapons, Gambit is also known for his table-hustling skills. In the movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it was mentioned that he always hustled the Three Mile Prison\u2019s guards in card games. After escaping prison, he made his way to back-alley casinos, bars, and underground poker matches to make a living. Gambit also made his appearance on several video games like the \u201cMarvel vs. Capcom series,\u201d \u201cX-men vs. Street Fighter,\u201d and \u201cX-Men: Mutant Apocalypse.\u201d\n\nBuilding a Cult Hit: Rounders\n\nWith the growing popularity of Texas Hold\u2019em and the other poker games, Miramax Films asked John Dahl to direct a film about this card game. In 1998, the film \u201cRounders,\u201d starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, and John Malkovich, the story revolves around two friends; Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) and Lester Murphy (Edward Norton) who makes the rounds around New York City to raise enough money to pay off their debt. Eventually, he beats Teddy KGB (played by John Malkovich) and settles their debt. The movie ends with Mike heading towards Vegas to play at the WSOP (World Series of Poker) Main Event. Vanessa Rousso, a professional poker player revealed that the movie captured the true energy and tension of the game. According to her, it\u2019s the best poker movie ever made.\n\nAn Online Phenomenon: Chris Moneymaker\n\nWith only $39 as his investment, he turned the world around as he won the $2.5 million pot at the 2003 World Series of Poker Main Event. Called the Moneymaker Effect, Chris is credited for kick-starting the poker revolution, and reintroducing it to the masses. His story also influenced the likes of Kara Scott, an active member of team partypoker, who became the first woman to cash-in on both the 2008 and 2009 WSOP Main Events. With the combination of skill and luck, he made it possible for anyone to play poker.\n\nComments are closed.",

Others, like third-party\u00a05e or Pathfinder products, have to compete against a sea of competition.\u00a0This week, I\u2019m counting down eight [Good gravy!!!] RPG campaigns that deserve a look. Some of these offer wanna-lancer* rewards that are worth considering into if you want to build your RPG resume.\n\n*Wanna-lancer\u2122 \u2013 A gamer that\u2019s pursuing freelance RPG work. Some back RPG Kickstarters that offer rewards to create NPCs, spells, items, adventures, etc. in order to\u00a0build up their resume, make contact with publishers, and learn what\u2019s expected on assignments.\n\n\n8) Wicked Pacts by The Polyhedral Knights\nEnds on Thursday, August 31 2017 10:14 PM EDT.\n\n\u201cA modern day Roleplaying game where players create various types of magic users. Urban fantasy magic meets gritty crime drama.\n\nWicked Pacts \u2013 Grunt Archetype\n\nUnknown to the general public, there are chaotic societies filled with magic, supernatural creatures, and other beings trying to establish themselves in the enchanted world and to promote their self interests regardless of the conflict that ensues. Meanwhile, many of the responsible magic practitioners do their best to shield the Ungifted from the reality of their existence to avoid a modern day witch hunt. \u00a0It is in everyone\u2019s best interest not to draw attention to their mystical world.\n\nIn Wicked Pacts players create magic users from various types of blood lines, from Pure blooded, half-blooded, Angel blooded, or Demon Blooded. Furthermore, there are a wide variety of magic training thus forging them into an archetype they can pick from in the game. Wicked Pacts features Talents, Complications, and a ton of Spells.\n\nThe game mechanics are designed to be fast and easy to learn, but not too easy it waters down the play and detail of the action. Wicked Pacts uses the regular polyhedral dice set and also what we call our Tarot Card element. Each character is linked to an Arcana card in a Tarot Deck. This card and many other cards can be used as fuel for the GM or the Player to affect various elements in the storytelling.\u201d\n\nWanna-lancer\u2122 Reward:\n\n\u201cPledge $100 or more\n\nFor your pledge, you will be able to work with the creator to help design either a supernatural monster, organization or ultimate bad guy or adventure with full credit to your contribution.\u201d\n\nEgg\u2019s Thoughts:\n\nThis is a new dice and Tarot Card combo gaming\u00a0system that you can help fund. Or, if you want to create content for this setting\/system, you can pledge to create a substantial\u00a0element for it. You can write up an organization or adventure which could have an impact on the direction of this game.\u00a0Their wanna-lancer reward gives you the chance to influence\u00a0Wicked Pacts\u00a0from the start.\n\n\nYou can see examples of The Polyhedral\u00a0Knights work at DriveThruRPG here.\n\nYou can support this Kickstarter campaign here.\n\n\n* * * * * *\n\n\n7) Lion\u2019s Vault Module for 5th Edition D&D & Pathfinder RPG\u00a0by 2CGaming\nEnds on Friday, September 1 2017 12:00 AM EDT.\n\n\u201cThe Lion\u2019s Vault \u2013 Part 3 of the Fate of the Forebears adventure path for 5th Edition D&D and Pathfinder RPG.\n\nLion\u2019s Vault is the third chapter of the Fate of the Forebears Adventure Path, beginning immediately after the close of City of Sands module. The players must now venture out into the desert wastes of the Mirrored Steppes to uncover the secrets of an ancient city in ruins. Characters must withstand an ever-present corruption that feasts on their will, while they race treasure hunters and bandits through trapped-filled ruins to find the corruption\u2019s source, an unspeakable horror protected by an ageless guardian.\n\nThe 80+ page adventure is setting agnostic, but with original locations and written for both Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition as well as the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The module will take characters from level 9 to level 11 and brings them through three narrative acts of a story arc, yielding 10-12 sessions of play. It is the continuation of the second module of Fate of the Forebears AP,\u00a0City of Sands, which, in turn, picks up after the first module,\u00a0Domes of Ishaq-Zahur.\n\nIn addition to the module, there will be an opportunity to pledge for digital assets in addition to PDF and print versions, which will allow you to easily run it online through virtual tabletop as well as at your table.\n\nThe destruction and terror the Nartheneen scepter caused on the metropolis of Archensheen will mark the city for decades. But even as the warring factions of the city fell to its power, it was clear that its evil source came from somewhere. Following a trail of disreputable treasure hunters, it is learned that a long-ruined Nartheneen city in the wastes of the Mirrored Steppes was the source of not only that scepter but all manner of evil and corrupted artifacts.\n\nA dark corruption lies beneath the Nartheneen ruins, tainting everything around it\u2014and this corruption is protected by ancient guardians who will stop at nothing to protect their secrets. What extremes must the adventurers reach to reveal the Nartheneen secrets and what horrors will awaken when they do?\u201d\n\nEgg\u2019s Thoughts:\n\nThis is the first of five\u00a0RPGs that are for either 5e or Pathfinder or both (six if you count Starfinder since it\u2019s akin to Pathfinder\/3.5e). With that in mind, each of these 5e\/PF adventures deserves a look because they all have something to offer.\n\n\n\nYou can see examples of\u00a02CGaming work at DriveThruRPG here.\n\nYou can support this Kickstarter campaign here.\n\n\n* * * * * *\n\n\n6) The Mysterious Happenings at Furlong Down. 5th ed Adventure\u00a0by John R Davis\nEnds on Friday, September 1 2017 5:31 AM EDT.\n\n\u201cThe Mysterious Happenings at Furlong Down is an adventure landscape (mini campaign) for 5th edition D&D. It is for 4-6 2nd level PCs.\n\nThe Restless Dead\n\nThe Restless Dead\n\nThe Mysterious Happenings at Furlong Down is an adventure landscape (mini campaign) for use with 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. It pays homage to early 1st edition modules such as Bone Hill, Sinister Secret of the Saltmarsh and Against the Cult of the Reptile God. It also draws specific inspiration from the following 1980s small press publications: Starstone by Paul Vernon & the Adventures in Tortured Souls Magazine.\n\nThere are at least 20 quests \/ plots \/ mysteries to resolve. There is plenty for the PC\u2019s to do.\n\nThis Kickstarter is to raise funds to pay for editing and to add as much art, from the most excellent Jonny Gray, \u00a0as possible.

Davis\u2019 The Cruellest Mistress Of All Kickstarter and pledged for a vanity press reward. My pledge allowed me to get the adventure and the prequel as well as create and write\u00a0a\u00a0setting and NPCs.\u00a0The reward let me write a location but John\u00a0let me sneak in a pair of NPCs to enhance the flavoring. John was easy to work with, very open to my ideas, and offered a lot of praise (and may use the setting\/NPCs in a future volume of his adventure path. That was a validating conversation). CMoA was a nice addition to my RPG resume and\u00a0pleasant work experience.\n\nFor John\u2019s campaign, I gave \u00a315 (about $24 at the time). If I hadn\u2019t pledged for that, I would have gone with the Forgotten Souls level (\u00a314 or about $21) that included the prequel adventure,\u00a0the adventure for CMoA and the\u00a0gazetteer. My wanna-lancer cost was a pound or about $3 (all January, 2016 conversions and poor rounding). The adventure is fun, the art is solid, and my writing appears in the product. I count this as a win!\n\n[UPDATE \u2013 2017-08-29 at 13:23 \u2013 After I messaged John R Davis\u00a0about this post, he emailed me\u00a0about my CMoA submission \u2013\n\nHi Egg\nThanks for the support\nOne of your merfolk is pencilled in to become sea-dragon food in Part 4 of Keranow! Might feel a bit guilty about that now!\n\nJohn cracks me up! Support his newest campaign here.]\n\nEgg\u2019s Thoughts on The Mysterious Happenings at Furlong Down. 5th ed Adventure:\n\nBased on my experience with John R. Davis, this is an easy recommendation. I expect a great adventure, great art, probably some extras, and John is very open to including your ideas. The base cost is \u00a35\/$7 or you can create content for \u00a37\/$9. The extra cost is negligible and a great resume builder. I cannot recommend it enough!\n\n\nYou can see examples of John R.

        "text":"ITF Gaming\u2019s Worst of 2013: Shame of the Year\n\nGames differ vastly in quality, some are incredible and immersive, while others can be described simply as shovelware. Today, we deal with the latter category, focusing on the worst titles our writers have had the displeasure of playing and finding out yours. Below, you\u2019ll find our picks of the absolute worst games of this calendar year.\n\nDarryl: The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct\nThis was a little bit of a toss up for me as I was almost on the verge of going with Aliens: Colonial Marines, Ashes Cricket, or Fast & Furious: Showdown. While they all equally deserve the title of worst game of 2013, The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is by far the worst video game I have experienced in 2013. Not only was it a slight insult to the very popular television series, it barely even comes close to the greatness of Telltale Games\u2019 rendition of the series.\n\nThe Walking Dead\nBrady: Sonic: Lost World\nThankfully I haven\u2019t played too many terrible games in 2013 but one that wasn\u2019t particularly great was Sonic: Lost World on the 3DS. While it wasn\u2019t an atrocious attempt at a Sonic game, it was one that failed to capture my attention for very long. The game also didn\u2019t do a very good job at utilising the handheld\u2019s potential, which came across as a missed opportunity.\n\nSonic Lost World Review (2)\nBracken: Star Trek\nStar Trek was unequivocally horrendous \u2013 especially for a universe that potentially has so much to offer. A joke of a storyline, gameplay mechanics that can best be described as intoxicated Mass Effect, horrible voice and character acting, and dated visuals make this title my clear worst title of 2013. And no, I fortunately did not play Aliens: Colonial Marines, in case you were wondering.\n\nStar Trek\n\nNow moved on, Bracken is an aspiring tech and gaming journalist. Is anyone even reading this?\n\nFacebook\u00a0Twitter\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Alex Filipowski\n\n    They\u2019re all bad but Ride To Hell Retribution was one of the worst games ever. The Survival Instinct game was fun but sadly their developer went bust so no possibility of a sequel\n\n  \u2022 Nerdmaster\n\n    Sonic Lost World on 3DS is good, but the stages are a little too long.",

        "text":"Latest in Gaming\n\nImage credit:\n\nPerfect Ten: MMO features that were hyped but never delivered\n\n\nDevelopers like to talk a big game. It's expected, it's encouraged by all parties, and it's part of the fun. When a game or big expansion is coming up, the spokespeople for studios like to hop on stage, grab that mic, and start proselytizing for all they're worth. And while some promises come to fruition, others are various shades of white lies, and still others never come to be at all.\n\nThese are the features that studios would much rather you forget were mentioned in the first place, although this is the internet and the internet never forgets. Well, players who latch on to everything devs say as absolute truth never forget.\n\nSometimes things happen along the way in development. Studios run out of time to get in all of the features and have to prioritize which make the cut and which do not. Features end up not testing as well as hoped and the studio quietly drops them because the PR hit for the features not going in is much less than the disaster that they might cause. And some developers like to flap their gums and spout brainstorm ideas that send the actual programmers and designers back at the company into spasms of agony when they try to figure out how to make them work.\n\nToday let's go through 10 features that were talked up but never delivered in MMOs!\n\n1. Warhammer Online: \"Your characters will grow physically!\"\n\nMythic promised the moon and the stars when it came to Warhammer Online, especially small but \"new\" features like the token system and (yeah, I'm going there) bears, bears, bears. But one neat-sounding idea that was touted quite often during the development stage never got into the game proper, and that's the concept of your characters growing and changing physically over time. Orcs were supposed to bulk up as they leveled, Dwarf beards would become longer, and Marauder mutations would become more noticeable.\n\nYeah, no growth for you, kids; you're going to stay a stunted runt forever!\n\n2. World of Warcraft: \"We're going to let you learn new dance moves!\"\n\nListen, I could probably fill this entire list with lofty promises that Blizzard made about WoW and since ignored, abandoned, or reneged just to watch fans cry. However, someone's already done that, and I want to mention one in particular anyway: the dance studio.\n\nTeased as one of the new features in Wrath of the Lich King, the dance studio was supposed to allow characters to learn dance moves beyond their default boogie. However, this has proven to be so difficult, so arduous, so incredibly tasking for the world's premier MMO studio that the devs just couldn't make it happen. Three additional expansions, sure, but more dancing? Impossible!\n\n3. Ultima Online: \"We'll have an intricate virtual ecosystem!\"\n\nUltima Online was a pioneer in many ways, taking the innovative concepts of the CRPG franchise into online space. One of the new ideas was to make this a living, breathing world full of animals and plants that would form an ecosystem much like we find in the real world. Bigger animals would prey on smaller ones, smaller ones would eat plants, herds would migrate, and players would need to adapt based on scarcity and supply.\n\nThen after this intricate system was constructed, the flood gates of beta opened and players. Slaughtered. Everything. Unless you consider \"dirt\" an ecosystem, there wasn't much of anything left once the hordes finished plundering. The concept was pulled and never reinstated for the live game.\n\n4. City of Heroes: \"You'll be able to go to the moon!\"\n\nWhy keep superheroes confined to the bounds of terra firma when the comics often had them going out into the cosmos? A trip to the moon was allegedly on the docket for City of Heroes, as clues and hints for a \"moon zone\" were found in several places. While this never came to be, the developers did confirm that such a zone was in the works prior to the game's closure.\n\n5. EVE Online: \"You can get out of your ship and walk around in a space station!\"\n\nHas there ever been so much hoopla made out of an avatar walking around as we've seen in EVE? While this is something that most MMO gamers take for granted, like killing pigs for profit and red liquid healing you, I guess it was something just shy of a gaming revolution for cabin-confined pilots in New Eden. Yet to date the closest CCP has come to making this flight of fancy reality is sticking players in another confined space: their bedroom. Unsurprisingly, players weren't that happy about a major studio treating them the way their parents do.\n\n6. Age of Conan: \"You'll go to hell!\"\n\nHave you ever had a game tell you to go to hell? Age of Conan almost did. One of the potential death penalties discussed was a trip to the underworld if you've been especially bad. The idea was that players using dark magic would receive soul corruption points for tapping into that forbidden power. If you got too many of those points without cleansing them, you'd find yourself in hell, battling your way back against demons to return to Hyboria.\n\nNeat idea for this gritty world, but unfortunately not to be. Guess all barbarians go to heaven when they die.\n\n7. DAWN: \"We're a real MMO with everything you could possibly imagine! Srsly! We promise, guys!\"\n\nTake a half-dozen \"developers\" and every pie-in-the-sky idea that any MMO gamer has ever had, call it \"truth,\" and sit back to doing pretty much nothing, and you'd have DAWN. DAWN wins the award for most broken promises in an MMO -- all of them -- since the game wasn't so much a piece of software as it was an entry in someone's dream journal. Animals that have sex! A fully constructible world! Agnosticism! Torture! A realistic star system! Pregnancy! Exceptional water physics! Something called \"squirmishes\" that's probably a typo but if it is then it's the best typo of all time!\n\n8. Guild Wars: \"Utopia will be our third campaign!\"\n\nThere's a new type of MMO. It's not a real MMO, but we'll pretend it is. It comes out without subscription fees. It says that it will make its money by releasing new campaigns -- standalone or stand together editions of the game -- every six months. It does this three times and not on that schedule. But when it starts to plan for a fourth, the team balks, changes its mind, and yanks it from production in favor of an abbreviated expansion and a sequel.\n\nThat's the saga of Guild Wars Utopia in a nutshell. For a longer version, visit the Olivetti Memorial Library.\n\n9. Champions Online: \"You'll enjoy the same Foundry system that other Cryptic games have!\"\n\nAh, Champions Online. My pity flows out toward thee, you unbeloved runt of the Cryptic family. Ignored, belittled, and criminally underdeveloped, Champions hasn't even received the same quality of free-to-play adaptation that its other family members have. It also hasn't received a player creation content system that the other titles have with the Foundry. Oh, sure, it's been talked about, but considering that the Champs team most likely consists of one part-timer, a cardboard cutout of Leonardo DiCaprio, and a terribly depressed hamster, I wouldn't hold your breath.\n\n10. Vanguard: \"You can reserve a whole family of mobs just for your party!\"\n\nOpen dungeons offer a whole set of complications and issues with greedy and malicious players. Vanguard's devs hoped to cut down on the jerk quotient with a so-called \"Advanced Encounter System.\" If your party was in an open dungeon and managed to hit a certain threshold (such as downing a named mob), then the system would reserve the remainder of that area or those mobs for your party so others couldn't leapfrog past your accomplishments. It was put into the game for a couple of months, got so buggy as to be unusable, and was yanked from the game ever since.\n\nJustin \"Syp\" Olivetti enjoys counting up to ten, a feat that he considers the apex of his career.

        "text":"7 Wonderful But Ridiculous Skyrim Mods You\u2019ve Gotta Try\n\nSkyrim is serious business, which makes these seven ridiculous mods all the more magnificent.\n\nWhile The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim does sport the odd dash of humour, it\u2019s a relatively po-faced affair. When they\u2019re not sending you on quests, the world\u2019s populace express an inordinate amount of interest in your affairs. NPCs of note\u00a0impress upon you the importance of your role as Skyrim\u2018s saviour, even if only five minutes before you were running up and down their dining table.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s not a laugh-a-minute game, which is why Skyrim\u2018s modding community is such a blessing. While PlayStation 4 owners get a raw deal, thanks to restrictions imposed by Sony, PC and Xbox One owners can add all manner of fan-produced content to the game. The available add-ons range from the mundane through to the totally absurd and while the former have their value, it\u2019s the latter end of the spectrum that we\u2019ll be looking at today.\n\nInstall one or more of these ridiculous mods and you\u2019ll find that Skyrim becomes a much sillier place. It becomes a land where rabbits are nine feet tall and where one man\u2019s flatulence is the only thing that can protect the realm from the F-14 fighter jets that seek to destroy it; truly, a place of wonder.\n\n\n\n1. Super Kamehameha Wave\n\nAuthor: TrentisN\n\nDragonball Z is, I\u2019m reliably informed, an anime about levelling up to fight a boss, then grinding away \u2019til you\u2019ve got enough power points to fight the next one. It\u2019s also quite popular apparently, with Dragonball FighterZ, a fighting game based on the series, coming out this month.\n\nBut if you can\u2019t wait till then, Skyrim\u2018s modders have you got you covered. The Super Kamehameha Wave is an absurdly and hilariously powerful attack that puts Street Fighter\u2018s Hadouken to shame, capable of obliterating all foes within a five-metre radius.\n\nIt\u2019s almost guaranteed to get you arrested if you use it in a village, but that\u2019s a small price to pay for engulfing yourself in a massive, impractical ball of blue energy.\n\nDownload Super Kamekameha Wave on nexusmods, and check it out in action below:\n\n\nSkeleton Ghost Pirate\n\nAuthor: skinnytecboy\n\nIn the words of renowned spiritual guru Robbie Rotten, \u201cDo what you want \u2019cause a pirate is free. You are a pirate!\u201d Or in the case of this mod, a Skeleton Ghost Pirate.\n\nDespite my initial misgivings, I\u2019m happy to report that while using this mod (which does little other than change your appearance) I encountered no anti-ghost-pirate prejudice. Patrons of one local bar were happy to point me in the direction of Belethor\u2019s General Goods, paying little attention to the mead that was leaking out between my ribs. Unless, that is, they secretly hated him and thought that sending a flaming, glowing skeleton his way would terrify him into an early grave.\n\nDownload Skeleton Ghost Pirate from nexusmods, and check it out in action below:\n\n\n\nGiant Rabbits\n\nAuthor: ThatGuyMitch\n\nThere\u2019s not a great deal to say about this mod, which turns every rabbit in the land into a giant, except that its effects are beautiful to behold. I mean, what more could you want from a game apart from\u00a0giant rabbits? Not much, I say. I\u2019m totally sold on the idea on principle alone.\n\nSkyrim\u2018s opening cart ride was robbed of its already limited emotional impact when not one but two huge bunnies bounded across the road. Simple, ridiculous and totally wonderful.Oh, and this is a rare mod that\u2019s actually available on PS4. Hurrah!\n\nDownload the Giant Rabbits mod from Bethesda.\n\n\nMetal Shouts\n\nAuthor: Waspinator1998\n\nFus-Ro-Dah is for wimps, as this mode\u2019s gravel-voiced Merchant of Metal would no doubt tell you.\n\nPurchase the appropriate tome from a stall outside Riverwood and you can annihilate your foes with a blast of pure heavy metal. There are thirteen shouts to choose from including high-quality samples from Manowar, Hammerfall, Rhapsody of Fire and more.\n\nHurling someone over a cliff using only the power of \u201cFast as a Shark\u201d by Accept is a rite of passage that every gamer should undergo.\n\nDownload the mod here and see it in action below:\n\n\nKatamari Dovahkiin\n\nAuthor: verteiron\n\nKatamari Damacy is terrifying. Maybe not from the perspective of the player but imagine living with the the knowledge that, at any time, you and your loved ones could be \u201crolled up\u201d and launched into space just because the King of the Cosmos accidentally destroyed half the solar system.\n\nNow you can bring that terror to the inhabitants of Skyrim with a spell that sucks any nearby animals or humans towards you and gathers them around your feet. The further you go, the more hapless beings that are drawn into the hellish ball of meat and fur.\n\nSomehow, I don\u2019t think Skyrim\u2018s fate is in the right hands.\n\nDownload the Katamari mod on nexusmods, and check it out in action in the video below:\n\n\nAnimated Fart Shouts\n\nAuthor: Twiggy\n\nWhy waste your voice dragon shouting when you can Fus-Ro-Dah from an entirely different orifice?\n\nInstall this mod and, under the right circumstances, your character will bend over and demolish their foe with a fierce gust of rectal wind. The local populace are surprisingly forgiving of this change in tactics; the Jarl of Whiterun continued to talk to me even after I\u2019d guffed him halfway across his throne room.\n\nDownload the fart shout mod from nexusmods, and check it out in action below:\n\n\nTop Gun \/ Kenny Loggins Mod\n\nAuthor: ChadPerson\n\nI used to think that Skyrim\u2018s Macho Dragon mod, which made all the dragons look like wrestler Macho Man Randy Savage, was the height of perfection.\n\nBut no, this add-on surpasses even the appeal of the Macho Man, injecting a much-needed dose of Top Gun into Skyrim\u2019s world.\n\nRather than having to deal with dragons, Skyrim is now plagued by fighter jets, which swoop in to the sound of Kenny Loggins\u2019 orchestral epic\u00a0\u201cDanger Zone\u201d, as heard in the entirely-subtext-free action film.\n\nThe only downside to this mod is that you can\u2019t harvest F-14 parts to create your own Gundam suit.\n\nGrab the Kenny Loggins mod from Bethesda\u2019s website, and check it out in action below:",

        "text":"Happy 30th Birthday 'Legend of Zelda!' Here Are 30 Facts About The High-Fantasy Adventure Game\n\nNintendo's\u00a0The Legend of Zelda\u00a0franchise is the world's most popular video game next to Super Mario. Link is probably one of the gaming world's most recognizable heroes after the portly moustached plumber.\n\nFor the game's 30th anniversary on Feb. 21, 2016, here are 30 fun facts you might not have known about Shigeru Miyamoto's green, wooden sword-wielding, time-traveling, ocarina-playing hero.\n\n1. Link's Sword\n\nLink gets his wooden sword from an old man in the original game, but this was not included in the plot until much later in development. Originally, Link starts out with the cheap weapon already in his inventory but early game testers were confused with what to do with it.\n\n2. Link Is A Lefty!\n\nWell, at least most of the time, he is. The sword fighting hero was infamously turned into a righty in the Wii version of Twilight Princess\u00a0because most gamers hold the Wiimote in their right hands.\n\n3. Which Is Which Zelda\n\nAlthough she is mostly remembered as the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda has also had other characterizations. Zelda has also been portrayed as a ninja, a pirate, and as Link's childhood best friend.\n\n4. Zelda Is F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife\n\nNot just a fun tidbit for literary geeks, but gaming geeks also know that the character of Zelda was inspired by the wife of \"The Great Gatsby\" author, Zelda. Hence the same names.\n\n5. Zelda Williams\n\nSpeaking of namesakes, the late actor Robin Williams was such a fan of the games that he even named his daughter after the character.\n\n6. Robin Williams Scene\n\nIn fact, Williams was such a fan of the game that he wanted to sign on to play the voice on Ganondorf. The scene was, unfortunately, cut from the game and never filmed.\n\n7. Link Speaks\n\nLink has only ever spoken twice in the game. The first was when he says \"Come on!\" in Wind Waker\u00a0and \"Giddy up!\" when he rides his horse, Epona, in The Twilight Princess.\n\n8. I'm Zelda\n\nIf you enter your name as Zelda at the start of the original game, you can unlock a hidden level with new dungeons to explore that non-Zeldas can't access.\n\n9. The Chris Houlihan Room\n\nAnother secret area to look for is the \"Chris Houlihan Room\" named after a lucky gamer who got to be immortalized in A Link to The Past\u00a0after winning a contest sponsored by Nintendo Power. Subsequent versions of the game, however, remove Chris' name and simply refer to it as \"Top Secret Room.\"\n\n10. The Almost-Precursor To\u00a0Minecraft\n\nOriginally,\u00a0The Legend of Zelda\u00a0was to be distributed on floppy discs to take advantage of the extra storage for users to design and create their own levels to save and share. But the idea was scrapped when Nintendo decided to go with cartridges instead.\n\n11. Links' Link\n\nTwilight Princess\u00a0is the first ever Zelda game where two Links interact with each other. Thanks to the game's time-traveling themes, the Hero Shade is also the Hero of Time, the savior in Ocarina of Time\u00a0and Majora's Mask.\n\n12. Time-traveling Links\n\nConfused yet? The time paradox gets even more loopy when you consider that the first ever\u00a0Legend of Zelda\u00a0game is actually the last chronologically. It takes place in an alternate time dimension where Link was unable to defeat Ganon in Ocarina of Time.\n\n13. Back Alley Back Story\n\nIf you don't quite know why Ganondorf and the king have so much conflict between them, find a back alley in Castle Town in Ocarina of Time\u00a0and you'll find a dying soldier who will tell you all the details.\n\n14. No Cheaters!\n\nNintendo dislikes cheating devices like GameShark. They even left an easter egg in Ocarina of Time\u00a0of a shark trapped in a cage at the bottom of a lake.\n\n15. Arwings Attack!\n\nAlso, if you enter a GameShark cheat code in Ocarina of Time, Arwings will immediately flock and attack you. Get the hint: No cheaters!\n\n16. Gaming Glitch\n\nThat being said, you can actually beat the entire original game in half an hour just like Lackattack24. But you'd have to take advantage of a glitch in the game to do it.\n\n17. Dungeon Protests\n\nJewish groups in the U.S. wanted to protest the original game's release because one of the dungeons was in the form of a swastika.\n\n18. Zelda Dungeons\n\nOther dungeon shapes in the original game could also be arranged to spell out Z-E-L-D-A.\n\n19. Series Regular\n\nThough the series bears the name of the Princess of Hyrule, Link is actually the character who has appeared in every single title of the video game franchise. Him and Octorok.\n\n20. This Is Not The Link You're Looking For\n\nIn\u00a0Wind Waker, however, the little boy who looks like Link is actually not him but a reincarnation of our hero.\n\n21. What's In A Name\n\nNintendo's official stance on Link's name is that he is a link between the game and the players. However, the game plays with time travel and alternate universes also hint that Link is also THE link between all these worlds and eras to the past and future.\n\n22. The Disney Connection\n\nLink's green outfit was inspired by Disney's \"Peter Pan\".\n\n23. Linked To \"Twin Peaks\"\n\nThe Legend of Zelda\u00a0may be completely different from of off-kilter world of \"Twin Peaks,\" created by David Lynch. But Link's Awakening was reportedly inspired by the series which featured memorable characters in a small community.\n\n24. Gardening Game\n\nThe Legend of Zelda was inspired by nature. At the time, games like Donkey Kong\u00a0and Super Mario Brothers\u00a0were popular - where the game was all about beating the bad guys to save the princess. But Miyamoto wanted the game to allow gamers to indulge more in exploration just like he used to do in the woods outside his home when he was a child - making it a garden they could wander through that could fit in their gaming drawer.\n\n25. Not In America\n\nBecause the original game pushed so many boundaries when it came to gaming, creators were reluctant to release it in the U.S. But they did and The Hyrule Fantasy\u00a0was renamed to The Legend of Zelda.\n\n26. No More Microphone\n\nAnother change from the original Japanese game was the exclusion of the microphone from game play. The U.S. versions of the console did not include a microphone so the Pols Voice rabbit ghost which is found in several dungeons had to be dealt with more traditionally rather than with the innovative use of making noise into the microphone to defeat it.\n\n27. The Triforce Symbol\n\nThe three triangles in a triangle of the Triforce and present in every single Zelda game was inspired by a traditional Japanese emblem used by the H\u014dj\u014d clan in Japan's 13th-14th century. It was called the Mitsuuroko or \"the Three Dragon Scales.\"\n\n28. The Music That Almost Wasn't\n\nBy now, Koji Kondo's score has become synonymous with The Legend of Zelda, however it almost wasn't to be. Originally, the creators wanted to use Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro as the game's theme but couldn't afford the rights.\n\n29. High-Tech Fantasy\n\nOriginally, the Triforce pieces which Link collects were supposed to be micro-chips. Playing in even further to the theme of time travel and linking the high-fantasy of the past with a high-tech far future.\n\n30. Down Voted\n\nAccording to The Facts Site, \"Navi, Link's companion in Ocarina of Time, has been voted the most annoying companion in gaming history.\"\n\n\u00a9 2018 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

        "text":"You are perhaps wondering whether or not you should play Ni no Kuni, the RPG by Level-5 and Studio Ghibli that comes out today on PlayStation 3.\n\n\nLet me put it simply: Yes. Ni no Kuni is a fantastic game. Although I haven't played enough to feel comfortable writing up a full review\u2014I'm around 14 hours in so far, and taking my time\u2014I think it's safe to say that yes, if you are a fan of role-playing games, or Studio Ghibli movies, or fun, this is an experience worth having.\n\n(While it's possible that something somehow ruins the game later on, it's worth playing even just for the 14 hours of greatness that I've experienced thus far.)\n\n\nThat's the short version. Now for some more impressions, in bullet-pointed form because really, bullet points are just too convenient not to use. Here are 12 things you should know about Ni no Kuni:\n\n  1. The first thing you'll notice about Ni no Kuni is just how gorgeous it is. That part's obvious. But what you might not notice right away is that the soundtrack, performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus, is just as powerful and welcoming as the Ghibli-crafted animation.\n\n  2. Many Japanese RPGs come with great music, but Ni no Kuni comes with an actual score\u2014instead of following a few catchy melodies, the horns and harps swell up and down as you walk through the world, meandering as if they're going on their own adventure with you. It feels like you're roaming through a movie.\n  3. You play as Oliver, a little kid who goes through some serious tragedy and winds up traveling to a new world, where he has to become a wizard in order to defeat the evil Dark Djinn Shadar and yada yada yada. So he has to go off and find a bunch of Great Sages to get more powerful and really this is all well and good but it doesn't really matter all that much because the appeal of this game lies in the adventure, not the excuse you need to go on that adventure.\n\n  4. So, yes, Oliver needs a reason to fight his way through deserts and forests and rumbling volcanos, but the sights and sounds justify themselves. Ni no Kuni's world is surreal and wonderful, well worth the trip.\n  5. The voice-acting is phenomenal, good enough to make me think about reconsidering my opinion on English voice acting in Japanese RPGs. Mr. Drippy's Welsh drawl steals the show, but all of the performances are extremely well done. Children in video games are usually annoying. Oliver is not. He feels and sounds like a real human being, and even when you might get sick of his naivety, his blind, innocent courage is appealing in a \"wow, I wish I could do that\" sort of way.\n\n  6. As always, Level-5 has done excellent work with the localization. Hope you like animal puns.\n  7. You get your very own book filled with wizarding spells, interesting stories, and even a made-up language that actually asks you to pull out a pen and paper IRL so you can decipher Special Wizard Code. Lucky pre-orderers get a physical version of this book, but you can see all of it in-game. Part strategy guide, part Easter Egg-filled lore tome, it's the type of thing that can steal an hour or two of your time.\n  8. The attention to detail is awe-inspiring: Oliver's cape swirls and flows in the wind, enemies run away from you when you're bigger than them, towns are full of random little secrets and treasures. When you get large objects, your tiny companion Drippy will carry them over his head. One town you visit has enacted a law that everyone is required to wear a bathing suit at all times\u2014so naturally, your characters swap into bathing suits every time they visit.\n  9. Ni no Kuni is a lot like Dragon Quest VIII\u2014a fantastic RPG, also by Level-5\u2014in many ways, from silly animal puns to crafting cauldrons. In most ways it's even better. This is a traditional JRPG, yes, but it also feels smart, engrossing, and modern.\n  10. One of the bosses is a genie that must have been inspired by Robin Williams's memorable performance in Aladdin. As you fight him, he'll pull out random objects from a giant cauldron: melons, parasols, ladies' undergarments. Whimsy!\n  11. So yes, Ni no Kuni is very good at making you feel like you're on an adventure, a whimsical adventure filled with personality and charm.
