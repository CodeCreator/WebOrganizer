        "text":"Is Costa Rica Safe For Families?\n\nIf you\u2019re planning a Costa Rica family vacation, this page covers common FAQs.\n\nCosta Rica is a country filled with beauty and wonders, but there are also challenges. Among these challenges, one particular thing can make you think twice before traveling there \u2013 safety concerns.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of crime in Costa Rica, and it\u2019s not just a matter of theft when it comes to belongings or cars. Kidnappings and burglaries are part of the crime scene in certain parts of Costa Rica.\u00a0\n\nEven with the crime in certain areas as when traveling anywhere travelers continue to flock to this country due to its various attractions. Be sure to do your homework before heading to Costa Rica. Know how to stay safe and maximize your time here and 99% of the time crime will not be an issue.\n\nIs Costa Rica Safe?\n\nWith its beautiful beaches, rainforests, and laid-back culture, Costa Rica is a fantastic destination for travel.\u00a0\n\nLike many other countries, Costa Rica struggles with drug trafficking. Still, Costa Rica manages to remain one of the safer countries in the region.\u00a0\n\nStaying safe in Costa Rica is certainly possible for visitors.\u00a0 It is always best to travel with greater awareness of possible dangers that may arise. Risks can come from any direction, but if you are aware of them, you can mitigate them and make sure you are prepared for anything!\n\nMany services have been developed to support tourism, whether a package holiday touring the country with reputable tour operators or visiting one of the many all-inclusive hotels.\n\nHowever, what makes costa Ricans proudest is their natural beauty, from the cloud forests in the central mountain regions to the humid tropical dry forest that extends through Central American down into South America or the white sand beaches fringed by palm trees. The lush virgin rainforest is home to some of the world\u2019s rarest species, monkeys, alligators, and jaguars.\n\nMany tourists think the jungle and all the natural surroundings are dangerous. This is not a factor when answering is Costa Rica safe for families. There is probably a better chance of getting struck by lightning than having a dangerous encounter with\u00a0 \u00a0Costa Rican wildlife. With this said though as always it is better to be on the side of caution and pay attention to your local guides.\n\nIs Costa Rica safe to travel for families?\n\nYes, it is totally safe for families. Enjoy a variety of family-friendly activities in Costa Rica. Hit up an incredible adventure park or go whitewater rafting in the rainforest.\u00a0\n\nGo horseback riding on the beach or zip-line through the jungle. Explore rainforests, volcanoes, and pristine beaches: you\u2019ll never run out of things to do in Costa Rica!\n\nCosta Rica is full of surprises. While you will undoubtedly love its well-known beaches and jungles, you\u2019ll be amazed at the country\u2019s excellent play spots for kids: paddle boats, iguanas in the streets, wild monkeys at the market. But don\u2019t forget to check frequently your little ones; they are speedy!\n\nIs Driving Safe?\n\nDriving in Costa Rica is not recommended for beginners. You\u2019ll be driving on mostly dirt roads, along with a lot of road construction going on as Costa Rica is making efforts to improve infrastructure. The fun part about driving is that you could face anything from wandering pack animals on the highway to imprompt river crossings that leave your car covered in mud.\n\nBeing an experienced driver in Costa Rica doesn\u2019t matter much if you don\u2019t have your car. With a car rental, you can drive your choice of hundreds of cars, including small sedans, jeeps, and four-wheel drives that easily cross rivers and rutted trails. Keep it simple and go with a 4\u00d74 and if you have your choice go with a Toyota.\n\nIs it safe to take taxis?\n\nA taxi is an easiest and quickest way to travel in Costa Rica, and they can get you to most places a lot cheaper than renting a care for short distances.\n\nThe only worry is that they don\u2019t have the best reputation for honesty, so use common sense when getting inside one and tell your driver where you want to go immediately, so they don\u2019t take any weird routes or stop randomly if it\u2019s not what you want.\n\nWhat about public transportation?\n\nPublic transportation is cheap and safe in Costa Rica and very easy to navigate, as you can see the place in the front of the bus. The buses are primarily new and clean and will be safe as long as you know your surroundings and do not travel too late at night.\n\nIf you begin to feel unsafe at any time during the bus journey, it is essential to let the bus driver or police know. They will be more than happy to help.\n\nLuggage on a bus is a dangerous place to stow your bag. Anyone can access your bags, and if you have valuable items, they could be stolen by other passengers. You can store the luggage under the bus, and it is safer.\n\nIs the food safe to eat?\n\nThe food in Costa Rica is excellent. The best way to say it would be \u201cfresh.\u201d The average person will be perfectly safe eating at most establishments in Costa Rica, and with food handling standards on the rise in the country, you can expect things to get even safer.\n\nCosta Rica is filled with fantastic Food. You will not be upset with the fresh fruit smoothies to the enormous plate of fried plantains or rice and beans.\n\nIs it safe to rent an Airbnb?\n\nRent an Airbnb in Costa Rica, and you\u2019ll be staying in stunning private villas, plush apartments, cozy treehouses, and luxurious homes. Each with its unique style, they\u2019re inviting spaces for creative escapes, inspired travel, thrilling adventures, and lifelong memories.\n\nAirbnb hosts are friendly folk who love sharing tips on the best sights to see and the best places to eat. Costa Rica is brimming with endless activities, rainforests bursting with life, and sun-drenched beaches.\n\nAnd, Finally\n\nFor any traveler, Costa Rica may seem like a unique travel destination. With its exotic climate, beautiful beaches, and variety of natural wonders, it\u2019s not hard to see why. However, there are several safety factors you should look into when traveling here. We have answered a list of common questions that will help you make your trip as smooth and safe as possible.\n\nShare :\n\n\nJoin The Ride\n\nSubscribe to our fortnightly newsletter with stories from our latest adventures and the best travel tips\n\nMore Adventures\n\nCosta Rican Cuisine\n\nAmazing Costa Rican Cuisine\n\nFrom fine dining to pulling up on the side of the river, you will be sure not to go hungry when adventure through Costa Rica on a POC Adventure.\n\nWant to plan Your Custom Itinerary\n\nContact Us Today And Get The Perfect Itinerary For You, Your Friends Or Family!\n\nContact Us Today\n\nPOC Camp\n\nThe POC camp is an extension of the POC lodge and while the POC Lodge is located with vast views of the Pacuare River Canyon the POC Camp is down on the river\u2019s edge.

It is a glamping experience with some of the important comforts of home.\n\nPOC Lodge\n\nStarted in 2011 is the POC lodge. If you haven\u2019t figured it out by now POC lodge is our own lodge and what we like to call the \u201cbaby\u201d of the P.O.C. Adventure Company. We wanted a lodge on our favorite part of Costa Rica which is the Pacuare River and with the help of locally harvested supplies and labor, the POC Lodge was born.\n\n\nThis is a 180-acre property that runs over 1 mile of the Pacuare River. Our goal has always been to offer as much comfort as possible without steering too far away from our roots of just roughing it on the river\u2019s edge. Our lodge has hot water, a splash of luxury in the rooms, and 5-Star service and attention to our guests.\n\nOur favorite part about the lodge is that we built a short hike up from the river\u2019s edge. We know we have the best views of the Pacuare River canyon and unfortunately pictures don\u2019t even do it justice.\n\nArenal Paraiso, Arenal\n\nHave you ever wanted to stay the night at the base of an active volcano? Well here is your chance. The Arenal Paraiso is located at the base of the Arenal Volcano with breath-taking views of the perfectly cone-shaped volcano.\n\nHere at Arenal Paraiso\u2019s, you will enjoy the beautiful property which offers much more than just a view.

You will be sure to wake up to the sound of the local residents such as the howler monkeys and green macaws. After your day of adventure, you will have a chance to relax and enjoy the beautiful swimming pool at the Shawandha Lodge.\n\nHotel Villa Florencia, Turrialba\n\nLocated in the valley of Turrialba surrounded by sugar-cane plantations and views of the smoking Turrialba Volcano sits an old plantation home that has been renovated into a beautiful small hotel named Villa Florencia.\n\nThis is a great hotel with a beautiful pool and plenty of space to take long morning or afternoon hikes. The Villa Florencia hotel is a chance to enjoy luxury while feeling like you stook back in time. While you are in the valley don\u2019t forget to look up as the Turrialba Volcano can often be seen doing small eruptions from across the valley.\n\nCasa Turire, Turrialba\n\nCasa Turire has been one of our favorites since we started.

        "text":"\ufeff China Visa FAQs, Application Tips\nHome > China Visa > Tips\n\nVisa Tips\n\nAsk Question\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Apply\u00a0A Visa?\n\nThe embassies and consulates stationed abroad of each country are authorized to issue visas to foreign nationals, who want to travel or immigrate to its country. Different countries have different jurisdictions, procedures for handling the visa, so the processing time after an applicant submit all the documents are quite different. Some may take as long as 3 to 5 months, even one year or longer are not uncommon, but others will issue the visa immediately after the applicant's application. It does not depend on the working efficiency, but the different complexity of jurisdiction and bureaucratic procedures.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Is It Difficult to Get the Visa?\n\nWhether visa is easy to get or not varies from one country to another. The main difficulties and differences are explained by the reasons below:\n\n1. Easier in immigrant countries (US, Canada, Australia\u2026) than non-immigrant countries (Japan...)\n2. If you have some relatives in your target country, it will be easier for you to get the visa.\n3. Applicant being educated to a high level will get the visa much easier.\n4. Easier to get in developing countries than in the developed countries.\n5. Easier to get in countries of small population than the countries of large population.\n6. More difficult to get if the applicant is considered as a stayer or to have the immigrant suspicion.\n7. Easier to get if your target country has the foreign relations with the country of your own.\n8. Easier to get if the economic guarantor of the applicant is more superior in riches.\n9. Easier to get when there are seldom applicants to apply for.\n10. Easier when the applicant is in a tourist group.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Distinguishing Genuine from Fake\n\nNowadays, there are more and more agencies which are providing the services of visa application. If you get the visa by consigning these agencies, the first important thing that you should do is\u00a0to\u00a0ensure\u00a0it is genuine and not a forged one. The following methods are offered for your reference:\n\n1.\u00a0Have your visa checked at the\u00a0issuing organizations;\n2. Make comparison with others who have applied for the same visa as yours;\n3. Carefully inspect the content on the visa word by word.\n\nGenerally, a fake visa is quite rough with illegible handwriting, signature and a blurred seal; even they make a mistake on the attachment to the visa page itself. In ordinary circumstances, the visa is affixed to your passport.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0After You Get the Visa\n\nAfter you obtain the visa, you should carefully check whether or not that the following preparatory work has been fulfilled, only then can you start your journey:\n\nWhether the international air ticket, ships passage or train ticket are prepared. Confirming the seat on the plane is highly recommended. Then, the notice (the written notification is the best) to the relatives or friends in your target country is necessary, including the information like scheduled departure\/arrival time, flight\/ship\/train number and so on;\n\nWhether the \"Prophylactic inoculation Certificate\" is prepared. You had better put this together with your visa and passport so as to provide ease of access when going through customs;\n\nIf all the credentials and materials are fully prepared, including passport, visa, health certificate and other corresponding letters of introduction, photos and so on;\n\nIf your luggage is appropriately prepared. You should be familiar with the prohibition of import stipulations of your target country in order to avoid delays and potential trouble at customs. Also ensure not make your baggage overweight, and that the baggage is sound, secure and labeled.\n\nQuestions & Answers on Visa Tips\n  \u2022 Dear Sir\/Ma'am\n\n    I am a Srilankan passport holder living in India with Indian residnece permit.

Of course, travelers can ask GSSA associates any other questions at any time.\n\nCan GSSA plan, coordinate, and execute all types of trips, tours, and events?\nYes, absolutely! If you can imagine a trip, we can organize it. More unique or specialized trips might need a few more days to plan, but we are confident GSSA can provide a great trip to any group coming from any location.\nAre GlobalGoSEE Trips limited to the ones described on the GSSA site?\nThe current GlobalGoSEE Trips listed are not exhaustive of locations GSSA is willing to go. Anyone can suggest a trip, and if there is interest, we would gladly make appropriate plans to visit locations not yet listed.\nIs GSSA primarily interested in getting International Travelers to the USA?\nWe enjoy working with our foreign guests and desire to expand opportunities for multiple nations to send their citizens to experience special programs available to them in the USA. However, GSSA is an organization that is interested in expanding opportunities wherever they exist.\nDoes GSSA work with public groups or private groups exclusively?\nGreat question. GSSA desires to work with anyone interested in traveling overseas for either a relaxing adventure tour, a special missions trip, or to expand international experiences. We enjoy working with high schools, colleges and universities, home-school groups, civic and community action groups, and any other individual or group desiring a quality travel tour.\nCan a group of individuals unrelated to each other organize a trip with GSSA?\nAbsolutely, Yes.\nHow does GSSA handle trips to global hotspots?\nGSSA avoids areas of the world where the State Department issues travel warnings.

        "text":"The Turks and Caicos Islands\n\nWhitby Beach on North Caicos\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Islands are one of the Caribbean's secret hideaways. More than 40 islands and cays are locked inside the world's most spectacular continuous coral reefs. Islands far from the neon and noise of cities; where life is simple, warm and welcoming, where there's no need to lock your doors.\n\nFeel like you've never felt before! Sunning, swimming, beachcombing, sailing, diving, fishing, or searching for sunken treasures off our 230 miles of gold and white sand beaches.\n\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands lie southeast of Nassau, halfway between Miami and Puerto Rico, and are separated from the Bahamas, our nearest neighbors, by a 30 mile wide ocean passage. The two groups of islands, the Turks Islands and Caicos Islands, are 200 square miles.\n\nThe Caicos group consists of six principle islands: Providenciales, North Caicos, South Caicos, Middle Caicos, East Caicos and West Caicos, and numerous small cays, some of which, like Pine Cay and Parrot Cay, are inhabited.\n\nThe Turks Islands are smaller and are separated from the Caicos Islands by the 22 mile wide deep-water channel (the Turks Island Passage) and consist of two main islands, Grand Turk and Salt Cay, and a number of small uninhabited cays\n\n\n\nElectricity is created by diesel generators on Providenciales and brought to North by an underwater cable. It is expensive.\n\n\nFresh Water is precious -- please help us to conserve it.\n\n\nOur reefs and marine life are our heritage. Please look after them so that we can all continue to enjoy their beauty.\n\nThank-you for helping us to keep the islands pristine, as you would wish to find them.\n\n\n\nHow to Get to North Caicos\n\nSee this link for options on transportation to North Caicos\n\nCurrency and Banking\n\nThe Turks & Caicos Islands are a British Crown Colony and popular tax haven for North Americans and Europeans. The U.S. dollar is legal tender of The Turks & Caicos Islands. There are no currency control regulations. Full international banking facilities are available on Providenciales in several locations.\n\nThere are no banks or ATM machines on North Caicos at this time.\n\nCredit cards are not extensively used in North Caicos. US dollar denominated traveler cheques are always accepted. There is a Western Union office.\n\nClothes to bring\n\nDress is informal. Light sweaters are useful for breezy evenings. Our Island is in the tropics and the sun is much hotter than in Florida, so bring your sun protection creams!!!!!!\n\n\n\nThe climate on North Caicos can best be described as an eternal summer cooled by the trade winds. The constant sunshine, makes the Turks and Caicos Islands an ideal year-round vacation destination. The temperature rarely drops below 25\u00b0 C (77\u00b0 F) or rises above 28\u00b0 C (83\u00b0 F) average. The breezes make for comfortable sleeping without air conditioning. North Caicos is known as the Garden Island and enjoys a rainfall averaging 40 inches per year. The vegetation is more lush compared to the neighboring islands.\n\nTurks & Caicos Ship Wreck, the 'River Arc' on North Caicos Reef\n\nThe River Arc - ship wrecked on the north side of North Caicos Turks and Caicos Islands shipwrecksOne night in early July 1985, a German made steel ship drifted into the North Caicos waters and got stuck on one of the small natural cuts in the reef.\n\nThere was no crew aboard, however, personal items and charts were left behind. The generators were still running.\n\nIt is believed that it was a drug ship and that the crew of 4-6 people abandoned ship into their lifeboats after their transaction was complete.\n\nHurricane Kate in late November 1985 moved the ship to its present position. There was a rope ladder on the west side and in the early years we use to climb up the ship to look around. The view was spectacular, because you were literally sitting right on the reef.\n\nIn later years an Oprey Nest appeared on the North side of the ship at the highest point. Over the years the wind and storms have gradually beaten the vessel down, loosing large section of panels it has now twisted and leaning. I am sure we will wake one morning to the ship no longer on the horizon becoming part of the reef, just as we woke in July 1985 to a ship being on the horizon.

        "text":"Every ticket purchased enters you in a raffle to win a one week, Saturday to Saturday cabin rental with any available boat from our fleet. Any cabin and any boat, as long as they are available during the dates you choose. Up to a $1500 value! You can check cabin availability online or give us a call at 715-476-2347.\n\nTickets will be sold until September 26th, 2020. Winner will be announced and contacted September 27th, 2020.\n\nWhat\u2019s the catch?\n\nThere is no catch except that the winner cannot bump anyone from a previously booked cabin. A lot of people have the same cabins reserved the same weeks every year. Winner cannot bump them. Must choose from available dates \u2013 but there are plenty! There are only two weeks during the summer that we are sold out \u2013 July 4th week and the first week in August. Cabins are open (tentatively, we still aren\u2019t sure when we CAN open) late May through early October.\n\nDoes the prize have to be used in 2020?\n\nNo. It will not expire.\n\nOur returning renters get first dibs on next summer\u2019s rentals though, so if you want to come Summer 2021, you must wait until after March 1, 2021 to book unless you are choosing a week that is currently available this summer. If the week you want is available this summer, it is also available next summer. If that doesn\u2019t make sense please call and we can explain it.\n\nWhat if I win but don\u2019t want to stay at your resort?\n\nThe week will be yours to do with as you please. It is transferable as long as you let us know what is going on. You can sell your week, you can give it away, you could use it for the most awesome wedding gift ever\u2026.whatever you want, just keep us in the loop.\n\nWhat if I win but already have a cabin reserved for Summer 2021?\n\n  \u2022 You can cash it in when you get here and we will refund your security deposit, making your stay totally free.\n  \u2022 You can use it Summer 2022\n  \u2022 You can come again!\n\nWhat cabins do you have?\n\nThere are 9 cabins ranging from a studio to a 4 bedroom. All except the studio have a full kitchen. Every one has a screened-in porch and private pier.\n\nWhat boats do you have?\n\nWe have decent Lund fishing boats and a \u201cvintage\u201d pontoon. We also have a tiny pontoon, perfect for couples or getting away from everyone else. Give us a call to see what is available when you are considering coming.\n\nWhat exactly happens if I win?\n\nYou give us a call to get your reservation settled (pick a cabin, a boat and dates) and that is it. You show up on the Saturday, enjoy and leave the following Saturday. You do not need to pay us anything. Taxes are included in the prize. The only thing you would have to buy is replacement gas for what you used in the boat, which comes with a full tank.\n\nI can choose any cabin?\n\nYes, as long as it is not already booked when you want to come.\n\nI only go up there for snowmobiling. Can I rent a cabin in the winter?\n\nNo, we do not have any winter-able cabins at this time.\n\nCan I bring my dog?\n\nHell yes.\n\nI want to bring 15 of my friends and pile them into my free cabin. Can I?\n\nPlease don\u2019t. That would probably be the end of our septic system. We ask that you only cram in as many people as can comfortably sleep in the provided beds and maybe one air mattress.\n\nI have my own boat and don\u2019t want to rent one.\n\nNo problem. We have plenty of trailer parking and every cabin comes with a private pier.\n\nI want to buy a million dollars worth of tickets. Is that ok?\n\nYes it is.\n\n\nIsland View Lodge \u2013 Cabins and Boat rentals, Bar, Restaurant \u2013 Mercer, Wisconsin",

        "text":"On Tour\n\nWe use spartamet bikes, which are also known as Snorfiets. \u00a0They are regular bicycles with a small 30cc engine that can power the bike without the need to pedal. \u00a0Therefore you don\u2019t need to be in great physical shape to take a tour, but you must be 16 years old and have a valid drivers license to operate the spartamet.\n\nYes, you may bring your own bike along on the tour. We offer a 5 euro discount to people who do so. However our guides are only trained in fixing our bikes, so if anything happens to your own bike on the tour, they will not be able to help you and we unfortunately will have to leave you behind. So only bring your own bike if you are willing to take that risk.\n\nThere is a maximum number of 8 riders on a bike tour.\n\nThere is a maximum of 12 people for a walking tour.\n\nThere is a minimum of 2 people for a chauffeured tour, and a maximum of 6 persons.\n\nPlease note that for private tours we can take as little or many as you like.\n\n\nNo, we do not charge any extra fees or fuel surcharges. The listed price is the price you pay. Including tax.\n\nWe understand that you may not have a printer handy when you\u2019re traveling so it is not necessary to have a printed copy. However, we require that you show ID matching your reservation and also the Order # that is immediately emailed to you after you make your reservation.\n\nPlease contact us to get the latest information on your desired trip.\n\nYou can purchase your ticket online through our website\u2019s booking page. \u00a0You may choose to pay by credit card using Paypal, or you may pay cash at the start of the tour.\n\n\nWear whatever is comfortable. It is recommended to have a sturdy pair of broken-in trail shoes, boots, or sneakers. It is preferable to dress in layers and wear clothing that will wick away perspiration and keep you dry and comfortable\n\nNot much, remember our trips are all inclusive. We do suggest you bring appropriate clothing to fit the season and a day pack to carry extra snacks and water.\n\nThe meeting-point is our shop located outside Almere Centrum Station. \u00a0In the square just outside the Station is a square with a bench about 50 meters from the station entrance. \u00a0The tour guide will be wearing Almere Tours shirt and\/or hat.\n\nWe recommend the Almere City bike tour to anyone who is not used to city traffic or nervous about biking. Almere has separate bike paths that rarely cross traffic so it is the ideal place to ride a bike in the Netherlands. \u00a0However please bear in mind that you must be able to ride bike on your own.\n\nWe expect you to be able to check over your shoulder before turning while riding in a straight line and turning corners. We also expect you to be able to ride in a straight line with one hand, while signalling with the other. Be clear in traffic and make sure traffic is clear to you.\n\nNo, children under 16 may not operate a Spartamet. \u00a0They may sit on the back of a tandem or in the box of a box bike (Bakfiets). \u00a0A Bakfiets is a bike with a large box for cargo or children in front. \u00a0Our Bakfiets also have the small motor on them so it is easily to drive up to 4 small children on the bike.\n\nYes, on special request we have helmets available for those who would like to use one. We have lots of children\u2019s helmet and a few helmets for adults. Helmets are not mandatory in Amsterdam and the Netherlands and most people don\u2019t use them, but we understand if you like to use one.\n\nMost tours last between 2-4 hours. \u00a0Each tour lists the tour duration and an itinerary on the tour description page.\n\nPlease note that in case you are planning other activities for after the bike tours, count on the tours possibly lasting + 30 minutes extra.\n\nIf you have paid for a ticket online, we guarantee that the tour will happen no matter how small the group is. If you walk in on the day of the tour we need a minimum of 4 people to do the tour.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not allowed to bring your baby along on our public groups tours.\n\nWe also do not have any bikes with baby seats.\n\n2 hour City bike tour cost a minimum of 150 \u20ac\n\n3 hour City bike tour cost a minimum of 225 \u20ac\n\n4 hour City bike tour cost a minimum of 275 \u20ac\n\n4 hour Countryside bike tour cost a minimum of 275 \u20ac\n\n5 hour Countryside bike tour cost a minimum of 325 \u20ac\n\nHow do I book a private tour?\n\nsend us an email us info@almeretours.com\n\n\nYou must call 72 hours ahead of your scheduled tour for a full refund. Within 72 hours you will assess a $35 termination fee. There are no refunds for cancellations within 24 hours of your tour, or if you decide not to show up.\n\nYes. Reservations are required for guaranteed spots on all tours. Reservations help us determine the number of guides we need to ensure that our groups remain manageable and enjoyable, and they allow us to notify you of changes to the tour due to weather or anything that could disturb the tours.\n\nIf you really want to join the bike tour on a certain day, then we highly recommend that you book in advance as the tours often gets sold out. \u00a0We do have a limited number of Spartamets, and only a couple tandem and box bikes. \u00a0\n\nYes we do accept walk-inns for the tours as long as they are not fully booked already. We recommend that you show up at least 15 minutes before the tours start and that you are flexible in case it\u2019s already sold out. \u00a0You should contact us by email or phone prior to showing up to the tour so we can confirm availability.\n\n\nWe do the bike tours in the rain or shine. We will provide you with a rain suit for the duration of the tour\n\nWe only cancel the bike tours if there is a serious weather or extremely high winds. \u00a0In addition, in winter time, heavy snow or ice would force the cancellation of certain tours. \u00a0If a tour were to be cancelled you will be notified and be given the option of rebooking the tour or receiving a full refund.",

How far is it from the train station to the ferry?\n\n    It's a\u00a02-3 minute walk - the ferry departs from \"the steps\" on the old pier (not the Caledonian Macbrayne terminal).\n\n  4. How do we get from the ferry to the cottages?\n\n    The\u00a0ferry sails\u00a0to Tarbet Bay.\u00a0The Estate Boat will meet you off the ferry to transfer you and your luggage\u00a0the short distance to the pier at Kylesmorar.\u00a0On arrival at the pier there is still no need to carry your luggage as we have a vehicle waiting to do just that.\n\n  5. What if we cannot make the ferry to the estate or need to leave earlier than the ferry's departure time?\n\nYou would need to make your own arrangements with one of the skippers listed on our Things to do page. If in doubt, give us a ring or drop us an e-mail to see what we'd suggest.\n\n\n  1. Can we restock our supplies during the week?\n\n    If you contact the Co-operative in Mallaig before 10:00 on any morning (or the day before) they will accept a credit card payment for your food supplies and send them up on the afternoon ferry to Tarbet.\n\n  2. What does the estate supply in terms of food?\n\n    The estate does not supply any food. We have a small 'welcome pack' for guests.\n\n\n  1. Can we use one of the estate boats on our visit?\n\n    Sorry no\u00a0for health & safety reasons.\n\n  2. Do we need to arrange a day out in advance?\n\n    Some trips may need arrangements to be made in advance. Please see our Things to do page.\n\n  3. Do you have freezer facilities?\n\n    The Old Post Office has no freezer facilities. The Bothy has a fridge-freezer and the Wee House has a fridge with a small\u00a0freezer compartment.\n\n  4. Do you have laundry facilities?\n\n\n  5. Can we swim in the loch?\n\n    You are welcome to try at your own risk; it has been done.

With the exception of live in nannies, most customers ask our nannies to arrive around 10am (this is when the shops and services open in Bali) and stay throughout the day until after dinner time. Some prefer to have their nanny start in the afternoon until later at night. You can adjust the start times of each day directly with you nanny. Our nannies are flexible and are happy to fit in with your arrangements.\n\nOur nannies are happy to look after 2 children at one time. If your children are older and only require supervision, 3 children are allowed. Contact us with your specific requirements on the Bookings page.\nPricing can be found on the Bookings page of our website. A deposit is required to secure your booking.\nOur nannies are happy to prepare meals for the children at your direction. This includes feeding infants. We ask that you plan your meals in advance and have all the necessary ingredients for the nanny to feed your children adequately. Our nannies are not allowed to take the children out to lunch \/ dinner unless you specifically request this, the restaurant is in the hotel \/ resort and the children are of a reasonable age. If this is the case, we ask that you inform the hotel \/ resort prior that the nanny will be bringing the children to lunch \/ dinner and it will be charged to your room.\nOur most popular option is a live out nanny for up to 12 hours per day. Choosing a live in or live out nanny can depend on various factors. They include the age of your children and how much supervision they will require, where you are staying and your travel plans. We can advise you on pricing and availability and the best scenario for your requirements.\nLive in nannies are very common in Bali and you must provide the nanny with their own room or a room they can share with the children. If you hire a live in nanny you must also provide all meals and refreshments- (a small meal like nasi goreng is sufficient in most cases). Live in nannies are also to be provided with 1 x 1\/2 day off in a period of 7 days paid.\nYes! In fact, we highly recommend this. Most Kids Clubs will not allow children under the age of 3 years to be left alone at a Kids Club without a nanny with them. We recommend you check with the Kids Club your children will be attending about the age limits.\nOur nannies have looked after children of all ages and adapt easily. This can include outdoor activities, walks on the beach, swimming in the pools or simply playing computer games and watching movies. Our nannies are happy to follow your direction on these activities and what you would and wouldn't like the children to participate in.\nOur nannies provide ALL services when looking after your children. These include nappy changing, feeding, bathing, general hygiene, playing, reading, bedtime routines and general supervision. We ask that you give your nanny as much information about your children's normal routine to keep things as consistent as possible.\nWe recommend that you use Bali Baby for all your baby equipment needs in Bali. Bali Baby is a western owned and operated company that provides excellent service to travelers to bali. All of the baby equipment is super clean, imported into Bali and meets Australian Safety Standards. Helena and her team will be happy to help you out with any questions you may have.\nAgain, this is a personal choice. There can be advantages and disadvantages to both. We recommend that you assess your needs and look into both. We highly recommend Nina's Bali Villas or Bali Soul Villas. Both agencies are Australian Owned, have a wide selection of villas in all main tourist areas of Bali and these agencies offer a wonderful service.",

        "text":"How do I get there?\n\nFly into Santiago de los Caballeros airport (STI). All flights from the DC area are one-stop routes and take between 6-9 hours depending on layovers. Delta and United have the best routes with average prices from BWI and DCA around $550 for an economy-class ticket. From the NYC area, non-stop flights average $450.\u00a0The cost of airfare will rise, as the departure date gets closer.\u00a0\n\n*DO NOT\u00a0book your flight prior to contacting Pravassa to confirm the tour is happening.\u00a0\n\nArrival\/Departure Information\n\nCheck-in begins at 3pm on the start date of our tour. A designated group airport transfer is included in your package, and will depart early afternoon on arrival day. Please make sure Pravassa has your flight itinerary so we can schedule your transfer. Our program will begin on arrival day with a welcome introduction followed by dinner.\u00a0\n\nOur group departure for STI will leave the hotel around 10am on our final day. If you have an early morning departure we can arrange a private transfer for you payable to the driver. We will confirm our group airport transfers once we have travel plans from the group attendees.\n\n\n  \u2022 The national language of the DR is Spanish. The resort staff and tour guides will speak English, but most of the locals will not.\u00a0As a conscious traveler we suggest you download a translation app such as Google Translate and learn hello, good morning, please and thank you.\n  \u2022 The currency is the Dominican Peso with the current exchange rate at $1 US = 45 Pesos. This number can fluctuate, so we suggest downloading a currency app to your phone for quick conversions. Cash is King for small purchases such as tips, dining in neighborhood restaurants and massages -\u00a0so be prepared. There is NO NEED to get Pesos before you arrive in the DR as everyone accepts USD.\u00a0Prior to departure we will advise you on the best amount of spending cash to bring with you.\n  \u2022 Visa or Mastercard is accepted for larger purchases.\u00a0Call your credit card companies before you leave home and inform them of your trip. There's nothing worse than being stuck overseas with no access to money!\u00a0\n  \u2022 Here's a sample of what you can expect to spend:\n    \u2022 Bottle of Water - $1USD\n    \u2022 Cappuccino - $2.5USD\n    \u2022 Beer - $2.5USD\n    \u2022 Kayaking tour - $45USD\n  \u2022 Tipping for outside offerings is voluntary and typically 10% for restaurants, spa treatments, and taxis.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Electricity is the same as in the US so no need to worry about bringing anything special.\n  \u2022 Drinking filtered or bottled water is your best bet to stay healthy. It's cheap and available everywhere.\n  \u2022 The DR is 1 hours ahead of EST during the time of our visit.\n  \u2022 Taxes & Services charges are included in your Pravassa package.\u00a0\n\nTravel Info\n\nAll traveler's passports MUST be valid for 6 months after date of entry into Dominican Republic. Please make sure to check your passport at least two months before your departure so you have time to update it if necessary. For US Citizens there is a $10 on arrival Visa fee to be paid.\n\nFor our week long trip you will only need casual clothing. You'll receive a full packing list, in our exclusive Wellness Travel Guide, before we depart, but to get started think about getting a small bottle of laundry soap to wash your clothes in the sink, pack light weight clothing, a yoga mat & props,\u00a0yoga clothes,\u00a0a bathing suit, ear plugs and a good pair of hiking shoes if you want to explore.\n\nFitness Level\u00a0\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is your vacation and you have the freedom to skip any wellness activity that does not resonate with you.\u00a0\n\n\nOur yoga classes in the Dominican Republic will be an open-air room with ceiling fans.\u00a0It can be hot and humid so be prepared to practice in these conditions. Classes will be a mixture of flow asana, meditation, and movement designed to encourage rejuvenation, healing, and rest, while at the same time creating heart openings, empowering, and stimulating you both physically and mentally.\u00a0Our instructors, Moses Brown and Bita Jenkins,\u00a0will customize their instructions to every fitness level. Beginners are always welcome.\n\nSwimming\/National Park\n\nWe'll be in the middle of a national park so rugged terrain will literally be at your feet. We suggest you bring sneakers with good treads and\/or water shoes so you can wade out into the ocean.\u00a0If you plan to be out for more than an hour, bring a day-pack so you can store extra water and sunscreen. Bikes are available to borrow at the hotel so you can also explore the salt-works area where Morton's cultivates their supply or ride to a local restaurant for lunch.\n\nHealth Concerns and Medical Emergencies\n\nPravassa will be purchasing a group travel protection plan for our travelers to help protect you, your trip, and your investment. The Plan Document, with full coverage details will be sent to you upon registration.\u00a0Even if you're healthy, accidents can happen! Our group protection plan covers things such trip delay, lost luggage, accidents and emergencies.\u00a0\n\nStomach problems can be common when traveling. Drinking bottled or filtered water is the best way to stay healthy. We suggest you pack activated charcoal or oil of oregano\u00a0to settle your stomach should it become upset.\u00a0\n\n\nWe will be visiting a remote area of the Dominican Republic where the locals are friendly and welcoming. While pickpocketing is prevalent around the world, if you are aware of your surroundings you'll have nothing to worry about. Please do not leave your belongings unattended at the beach and when off-property we suggest women dress respectfully in long pants or long skirts.\n\nClimate and Weather\n\nThe Dominican Republic has that perfect Caribbean weather. Days will average around 85\u00b0 with the possibility of a mid-afternoon tropical shower. Temperatures can cool at night to a breezy 65\u00b0 so we suggest packing a loose cotton clothing, lots of sunscreen and some layers for sunset.\u00a0\n\nWhat will I eat? \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOur trip will be based on a pescatarian offering (fish and vegetables).

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhere do I check in for my scheduled tour?\n\nCheck in for all tours is at the Pentagon Tours window located in the Pentagon Visitor Center at the Metro Entrance.\n\nWhere can I park at the Pentagon?\n\nPublic parking is not available at the Pentagon. Visitors may opt to park at the Pentagon City Mall. No shuttle service is provided to or from the Pentagon. The Pentagon is less than a five minute walk from the mall and can be reached through a pedestrian tunnel. Once through the tunnel, look for signs to the Metro entrance.\n\nHow can I schedule a short notice Pentagon tour?\n\nReservations may only be booked from 14 to 90 days in advance. Reservations will not be accepted for tour dates within 13 days or more than 90 days away. There are no exceptions to this rule.\n\nI am having trouble requesting a tour via the online submission form; is there another way I can submit a tour request?\n\nAll Pentagon tours must be scheduled through our website Pentagon Tours Request at least 14 days in advance.\n\nWhat are some major points of interest on the Pentagon tour?\n\nAll tours will be exposed to the history and facts pertaining to the four branches of the military (Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force). You may have an opportunity to visit the indoor memorial placed near the September 11th crash-site, along with the September 11th Memorial Chapel. Also, the names of all the recipients of the Medal of Honor may be seen in the Hall of Heroes, as well as an up-close look at an actual Medal of Honor medallion. These are only a few of the many exhibits that may be seen on your tour.\n\nCan we eat inside the Pentagon?\n\nTour Guides do not pause during the tour; groups will not have a scheduled time to eat in the Pentagon. Groups may coordinate with other Pentagon personnel to escort them to an area where they may eat before or after the tour.\n\nAre tours offered in other languages?\n\nCurrently all tours are presented in English. However, translation is permitted for tour groups that bring approved translators with them.",
