        "text":"The most spectacular waterways in the world\n\nPhotography: Sergey Borisov f0r Alamy Stock Photo\n\nEnchanting Danube\nOne of the most popular river-cruising waterways, the Danube plays host to charming small European towns, delightful cities and views for days. Europe's second-longest river flows through 10 countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine. A popular route links Budapest, an elegant city on the banks of the Danube, with famously progressive Amsterdam, following the Rhine, Main and Danube rivers. En route, river cruises pass by Vienna, Austria's stunning capital, and Germany's fairytale castles. Longer cruises that follow the Lower Danube build on itineraries that travel through Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria.\n\nMighty Mekong\nAs South East Asia's life-giving waterway, the mighty Mekong winds its way through some of the most fascinating countries in the region. Travelling along the river is to understand the important role it plays in the daily lives of locals. Dozens of hill tribes have settled along the river's banks, and many offer their handmade arts and crafts at lively outdoor markets. Traditional fishing villages still line the waterfront in many regions, while golden-domed temples make a breathtaking sight at sunset. A journey along the Mekong is an exploration of diverse and fascinating cultures.\n\nExploring the Rhine\nAmong the most lively and beautiful waterways in Europe, the Rhine is one river that holidaymakers can't get enough of. It's also one of Europe's longest and most important, winding through Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, France and the Netherlands. Expect to see a melting pot of old and new scenery along the way, as medieval villages and dramatic castles give way to thriving modern cities where industry and innovation has superseded tradition. Keep your ears open for local folklore and legends, as tales of beautiful mermaids driving sailors to distraction are as prevalent here as Hansel and Gretel in the forest.\n\nA taste of Bordeaux\nYou don't have to be a wine connoisseur to enjoy a cruise around France's celebrated Bordeaux region, but it sure doesn't hurt. Immerse yourself in country life as you pass through rural French towns where the daily fresh market is the central meeting place, sheep roam impossibly green, verdant hillsides and the welcome is as warm as the wine is terrific. Bordeaux, a gorgeous city with UNESCO World Heritage status, sits on the Garonne River and is one of France's culinary and cultural gems. Cruises here tend to focus on port stops where wine appreciation, indulgent cuisine, beautiful gardens and stately homes are the order of the day.\n\nDoing the Douro\nFlowing some 900 kilometres through Spain and Portugal, the Douro river finally empties into the Atlantic Ocean where the city of Porto meets the coast. Along the way, it splashes by terraced vineyards where grapes are grown for Portugal's acclaimed wines, under the shadow of imposing monasteries and historic castles. Translating as Portugal's River of Gold, it weaves through sun-drenched towns and rustic farmland, where some of Europe's most delicious produce is sourced. On the steep banks of the Upper Douro, vast reserves of Port wine grapes drink in the sun for a bountiful harvest. Expect to see fewer river cruises on this body of water than in other parts of Europe.\n\nThis article is presented by helloworld and APT River Cruises.\n\nView Full Site",

        "text":"Guidelines for your J1\n\nGuidelines for your J1\nJune 21, 2016 bigboss\n\nWho is off on a J1 this summer? Well here are a few guidelines to get you prepared for what lies ahead.\n\n\n1.Tipping is essential\n\nAll Americans expect tips. This is actually classified as compulsory when in a bar or restaurant, if you don\u2019t leave a tip they will literally chase after you and think you\u2019re really rude. The usual tipping guide is 20% of your total bill or 1 dollar per drink at a bar.\n\n\n2.Have a nice day\n\nExpect everyone to tell you to have a nice day. Although its nice that everyone is so friendly it does get a little irritating after you have heard this phrase for the fortieth time in one dat.\n\n\nWhen booking accommodation there are only two things you need to be know:\n\n1.Live near a public transportation system.\n\n2.Avoid the ghetto\n\n\n4.Move Around\n\nDon\u2019t spend your whole summer in the same location. Maybe travel towards the end of the summer so you have a little bit of cash and can afford to rent a car, try see as many places as possible.\n\n\n5.Leprechauns aren\u2019t real\n\nAs insulting as it sounds, you will probably have to tell at least one American that leprechauns aren\u2019t real.\n\n\n6.Putting on a tone of weight\n\nSo as we know American food portions are so big and so delicious. This is having consequences on your body. Between all those McDonalds and midnight Taco Bell Burritos expect to put on weight!\n\n\n7.Roll Over\n\nIt wont is easy but you will do it!! It wont is easy but after the first few nights of drinking it will get easier, by day 10 you will be flying it!!\n\n\n8.Gullible Americans\n\nYou will have to take the piss out of at least one gullible American. Some of the best would be- the legal drinking age is 13 years old or that we have no cars only horses. The funniest part is they will believe it!!\n\n\n\nYou will have to explain to Americans that Ireland is not in the UK and its not somewhere ovate west coast. We are an independent country!\n\n10.American Accent\n\nWe are notorious for this! Even someone with the biggest Irish accent will spend 3 months in America and develop a slight American twang. You might even begin telling everyone to \u201chave a nice day now\u201d. NO THANKS-\n\nAuthor Image\n\n\nLeave a reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"Cool destinations to visit in Panama\n\nBy haui\nIn Central America\nFeb 6th, 2017\n1 Comment\n\nCool destinations to visit in Panama\n\nHere is a short list for some great and probably lesser known cool destinations to visit in Panama, there is MUCH more to see then just the Panama Canal, aldo thats probably a must when your visiting this beautiful country. Fore more to read on and thanks for some of the images to this story about Panama please see also, they offer many more destination and travel tips plus general information about Panama.\n\nSo here we go a short list followed by some images of probably lesser known destinations in Panama:\n\n1.) Coiba Island\n\nA paradise and worth a trip all by itself. Specialy for snorkeling and diving, but also for some hiking, swimming and sightseeing. With an area of 50.3 square miles, Coiba is the largest island in Central America, off the Pacific coast of the Panamanian province of Veraguas. Coiba National Park ( Parque Nacional Coiba) is a group of 38 islands. Unesco declared the entire Coiba National Park a \u201cWorld Heritage Site\u201d. Worthwhile also to visit the old prison and Isla Granito de Oro a marvel with crystal clear waters good for a swim or snorkeling. You must organize a trip here with a local travel agent, all visitors must register before hand with the local authorities (ANAM) and you can only stay at the rangers stations where rooms are basic and limited in numbers. Boats to here can be hired for example in Santa Catalina.\n\n2. Fort San Lorenzo\n\nThis visit can be done as a day tour when visiting the Colon side of the Panama Canal. One must drive to the Gatun Locks first and from there to Fort Sherman where they have a check point and then to the Fort. You have a great view from the Fort and below is a small beach in case you want to go for a little swim in the Caribbean Sea. There are no reataurants or hotels here so bring your own lunch and have a little picknick at this magical spot, if your lucky you might even see some howler monkeys along the way or around the ruins.\n\n3. Isla Grande\n\nSince we are talking already about the beautiful Caribbean coast of Panama here is a beautiful spot to relax a few days and go for a swim or for diving around the area. Beach side restaurants, small hotels and a little resort are available here. Book in advance and best during the week as weekend it might be crowded with local visitors. Also on the way there plan a stopover in Portbello and old town with ruins from the Spanish area and little church that has the statue of the so called Black Christ.\n\n4. The Dracula Orchid Farm in Cerro Punta\n\nThis is a magic place to visit in the mountains of Chiriqui that features guided tours to show of one of the most complete collections of rare American orchids (with a variety of over 2000 species). That place is pure magic and a delight for every nature lover. Hotels in the area include the Queztal in Cerro Punta or along the way the Hotel Bambito. The area is also a good starting point for birdwatching and tours to El Volcan Baru, but you must hire a local guide as one can get easily lost in those cloud forests.\n\n5. The Pipeline Road and the Panama Rainforest Discovery Center\n\nThis area can be visited in a day tour from Panama City or from the Rainforest Resort Hotel in Gamboa where you can stay for a few days and do a variety of tours including to the monkey islands along the Panama Canal. From the City the drive is around 45 minutes along the Panama Canal, passing Miraflores and Pedro Miguel Locks and turning left after you pass under a small Railroad bridge where the turnoff is market by a sign that also indicates the limits of the Soberania National Park that starts there. Here you come first along the Summit Zoo also well worth a visit then the Plantation Road and Charko Hike, later the old bridge over the Chagres River unfortunately this bridge is in a shabby conditions and one wonders why they spend millions on the Canal expansion but can not afford a few thousands to fix that bridge. Anyway just after the bridge right turn off os to the Hotel Gamboa and strait on passing Gamboa to the Pipeline Roand and to the Rainforest resort see this website for some details and maps. From here you can hike along the Pipeline Road and or drive to the Rainforest Discovery Center, see also more details and fees on their website here. This area is a paradise for nature lovers and birdwatchers. A warning again stay on the roads and never wander off into the forests or you will get lost!\n\n6. La Tavida \u2013 Cerro la Vieja\n\nWe cuote from Cerro la Vieja (The old Lady\u2019s Mountain) is located about 40 minutes up into the mountains from Penonome in Chiguiri in the province of Cocle. Up there you find the Eco Lodge called Posada Ecol\u00f3gica Cerro La Vieja, unfortunately they closed on January 2014 but still have the caba\u00f1as available at the waterfall (see the Posada Ecol\u00f3gica Cerro La Vieja website here for up-to-date info) Around the Hotel there are a few trails to go hiking and bird watching and don\u2019t miss to visit the impressive waterfall La Tavida close by where the water rushes down from a height of 30 meters and you may take a refreshing bath. The caba\u00f1as at the falls are a great place to hang out for a weekend, you wont regret it!\n\nNow there are MANY more beautiful spots to visit in Panama so start and discover some yourself and please let us know what you found! So enjoy and have a great time!\n\nHere we attach a few images that highlight some of the destinations mentioned here:\n\n\nOne Response to \u201cCool destinations to visit in Panama\u201d\n\n  1.

It has been in existence for approximately 450 years, and the style of the uniform of the riders is nearly unchanged since the beginning. Only Lipizzaner horses, which are bred at the federal stud Piber in the Austrian province of Styria, are trained here.\n\nThe Morning Exercise offers an insight into the years of training of the Lipizzaners and their riders. Accompanied by classical Viennese music the riders and their horses do simple relaxing exercises and exercises aimed at refining and perfecting a certain movement. \u00a0The show takes place in the morning and is one of the popular places to visit in Vienna, so if you plan to attend buy the tickets beforehand. \u00a0Make sure to check the schedule, they do take a break during summer months.\n\nSpanish Riding School, Vienna - Photo by Outside Suburbia\n\nRingstrasse Tour\n\nVienna\u2019s important buildings are along this historical street. \u00a0In the 13th century, Vienna was walled to defend this area that now comprises the first district of Vienna. After the First Siege by the Ottoman Turks in 1529, it was extended and a defensive slope\u00a0was built around the walls.\u00a0 In the 18th century, the glacis(the defensive slope)\u00a0served as a recreation area, as Emperor Franz Joseph II commissioned the regeneration of this area by cultivating plants, installing street lamps and building walkways and roads. This former glacis, is called the Ringstrasse, and it surrounds the city center of Vienna, leading to several historical and the important buildings of that you want to see in Vienna.\n\nTram rides - Best Things to do in Vienna with kids - Photo by Outside Suburbia\n\nThe Ringstrasse is basically the boulevard that surrounds Vienna\u2019s historic center. The Votive Church, the City Hall, Europe\u2019s largest theater (Burgtheater), the Austrian Parliament, the Vienna State Opera, to name a few are all on this area. Kids will enjoy riding the tram, we had the Vienna Pass and used the hop on and off buses to get around. Our hotel was also located right on the\u00a0Ringstrasse.\n\nSt Stephen\u2019s Cathedral\n\nSt. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral, also known as Stephansdom, started out as a parish church in the 12th century.

        "text":"Travel | May 6, 2022 7:00 am\n\nA Local\u2019s Guide to Louisville, Courtesy of Jefferson\u2019s Bourbon Founder Trey Zoeller\n\nSkip Kentucky Derby weekend and plan a trip around these 13 recommendations from \"the mad scientist of whiskey\"\n\nJefferson's Bourbon founder Trey Zoeller stands next to a few barrels topped with bottles of his brand's whiskey. We spoke with Zoeller to get a local's guide to Louisville, Kentucky ahead of the Kentucky Derby.\nListen to Trey, who not only has good taste in whiskey but restaurants and breweries too.\nPhoto courtesy of Jefferson's Bourbon\n\nFor two minutes on the first Saturday of May, the city of Louisville, Kentucky, becomes the center of the sporting universe. We\u2019re speaking, of course, of the Kentucky Derby, the longest continually run major sporting event in the United States, when the best three-year-old thoroughbred horses in the world streak around the famed dirt track at Churchill Downs for their shot at immortality.\u00a0\n\nThis year, for the first time since 2019, the race will go off in all its glory as an estimated 170,000 people will fill the track. Known affectionately by city residents as the biggest cocktail party of the year, the race is the official kickoff to the summer social season when tourists flock to a city that Southern Living recently named one of the South\u2019s best cities\n\nThe 148th running, this year\u2019s race has been one that Trey Zoeller, the founder of Jefferson\u2019s Bourbon, has looked forward to all year. A native son who has spent most of his life in Louisville, he has his best suit pressed and is ready to head to the track for a few customary mint juleps.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe last couple of years have been a version of the Kentucky Derby light, something I had never experienced in my life and never hope to again. It cast a pall over the state,\u201d he tells InsideHook. \u201cThe town has been buzzing for weeks now with the anticipation of finally doing the Derby right again. It will be an epic weekend filled with cocktails, brews, laughter and hopefully some winning bets on the horses. A good Derby sets the tone for the summer here, and it should be a memorable one this year.\u201d\n\nBut Zoeller will tell you not to fret if you miss the race. Louisville is a city that can offer a memorable time year-round and, no offense to Derby goers, is best visited once the race crowds leave.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a Laissez les bons temps rouler attitude here \u2014 we like to let the good times roll. It\u2019s due to traditional drivers of the state\u2019s economy: bourbon, marijuana and gambling on horse racing. We\u2019re rebels at heart,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why there are so many great places to sip cocktails, eat food and have a fun night out, especially since the bars don\u2019t close in Louisville until 4 a.m. We are the northernmost Southern city, so there is an interesting mix of sophistication and relaxation infused in the city, and the people are genuinely nice.\u201d\n\nFor those missing out on the festivities of Derby weekend, we asked Zoeller for the places he personally takes visitors when they come to the Ville, as the locals call it. He didn\u2019t include Kentucky Artisan Distillery, the home of Jefferson\u2019s Bourbon and a 30-minute drive from downtown Louisville, so consider that a bonus stop.\u00a0\n\nThe bar at Hell or High Water, a cocktail bar in Louisville, Kentucky\nHell or High Water is worth taking the time to make a reservation, so do it.\nPhoto: Andrew Hyslop\n\nWhere to Eat: Tasting Menus to Farm Restaurants\n\n610 Magnolia\n\n\u201cMy good buddy Edward Lee, owner and chef, consistently does a great job here. Any time you can get a table, something not that easy, and dive into his tasting menu, you will be rewarded with an inventive meal filled with local items. Plus, his bourbon and wine list are great.\u201d\u00a0\n\nJack Fry\u2019s\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a Louisville staple that has been around since 1933. It reminds me of Raoul\u2019s in SoHo in New York City. I love sitting at its intimate bar where you can always strike up a good conversation with someone sitting next to you. Their shrimp and grits are out of this world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis new spot in the red-hot neighborhood of Nulu downtown that\u2019s funky and fun with great bars and restaurants. Housed inside a building with a huge mural of Frida Kahlo on the front, you know it will be interesting. I love their fresh takes on classic Mexican dishes, and they have one of the best tequila lists I have seen.\u201d\n\nBarn8 on Hermitage Farm\n\n\u201cLocated just outside town on a beautiful horse farm inside an old barn, this place is worth visiting just to enjoy the scenery. It\u2019s amazing. It was opened by the same people who opened the 21c Museum Hotel downtown. The attention to detail is great, and the food is excellent.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDecca Lounge & Restaurant\n\n\u201cBrunch is a southern staple, and Decca does it better than anyone. Their food is superb and fresh. It is brimming with energy, and I always bump into someone there. Best of all, upstairs is B-Side, a bottle, book and specialty LP store that is just cool.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhere to Grab a Drink: Cocktail Bars to Breweries\n\nHell or High Water\n\n\u201cThis speakeasy-style cocktail bar is located underneath the Old Forester Distillery right in the heart of the Urban Bourbon Trail. You have to make reservations to get in, and it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s got a great vibe, killer drinks and is near the great tasting bars for Michter\u2019s and Rabbit Hole distilleries.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHoused in a skinny little bar in Nulu, this place has an incredible bourbon portfolio and good cheap beers. I love hanging in its courtyard out back, especially when they crank up the karaoke at night. It\u2019s the perfect spot for some late-night fun.\u201d\n\nNeat Bourbon Bar and Bottle Shop\n\n\u201cAs a bourbon lover, this place has one of the best lists in the city since they buy old bottles from estates using Kentucky\u2019s Vintage Spirits Law, so you are sure to find some wild stuff here. Even better, they can sell you bottles to go.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3rd Turn Brewing\n\n\u201cI love this brewery housed in an old plant nursery located right by the Kentucky Artisan Distillery where we make our product. Their beers are great, and drinking them in the old greenhouses filled with huge vines and plants on a hot day is perfect.\u201d\n\nF.A.B.D Smokehouse\n\n\u201cA true locals hangout, this old package store always has a smoker going out front upon which they cook some of the best ribs and chicken in the city. The inside is a relaxed combo bar and package shop where everyone hangs out and has fun.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe bourbon bottle hall at Frazier History Museum in Louisville, Kentucky\nThe Bourbon Bottle Hall at Frazier History Museum showcases every bottle currently in production in the state of Kentucky.\nPhoto courtesy of Frazier History Museum\n\nWhat to Do: Museums to Parks\n\nFrazier History Museum\n\n\u201cLocated downtown, this is the official Kentucky Bourbon Trail Welcome Center. It tells the story of bourbon so well, identifying everyone and everything that has and is involved in making our spirit. There are interactive exhibits, and they sell some rare bottles too, of course. It\u2019s also across from the Louisville Slugger bat museum, something that every Louisville kid visits in their youth. It\u2019s pretty cool watching them make the bats.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWaverly Hills Sanatorium\n\n\u201cSupposedly, this is one of the most haunted places in the world. It\u2019s a gothic building that exudes such an uncomfortable vibe that I love taking people there for a tour. If that place doesn\u2019t drive you to a drink, nothing will.\u201d\n\nCherokee Park\n\n\u201cAnyone who grew up in Louisville has spent hours in Cherokee and neighboring Seneca parks. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the same man who created Central Park in New York City, you can easily get lost in its many wandering trails that lead to hidden nooks and crannies. In the summer, everyone seems to head there to hang out on Beargrass Creek.\u201d",

        "text":"Top reasons to visit Kashmir\n\nKashmir was once called Heaven on Earth, and one of the most beautiful places in the world. However, in last couple of years, terrorism has faded its charm \u2013 A place home to Himalayan Ranges. Yet the previous year, Kashmir recorded the maximum number of tourists ever. The alluring beauty of Kashmir gives you a reason to live and visit this place again and again.\u00a0 The famous Dal lake where you can stay in houseboats, a five star luxury beyond the hotels that offers you the options to choose your cuisine according to your own taste and enjoy your meals while looking at the hustle and bustle of the Dal. The Shikaras, Kashmiri handicrafts like shawls, woodcarvings, dried fruits, saffron and the Kashmiri Culture are some of the attractions.\nHere are the top reasons to visit Kashmir:\n\n1. Beauty:\u00a0 Needless to say, Kashmir offers such breath taking views that it becomes extremely difficult for one to go back home! From the very beautiful Tulip, Nishat, Chashma Shahi and Mughal Gardens to the marvelous hill stations like Gulmarg, Pahalgam & Sonamarg; Kashmir has it all.\n\nDal Lake\n\nLeh Ladakh or the Biker\u2019s heaven is a feast for eyes! The Valley is full of the mighty mountains, lush greenery, and blossoms of pinks, whites, yellows and flowers of all the rarest varieties.\n\nThe beautiful Valley\n\nThe Chinar trees account for most of the elegance, painting the entire canvas with myriad of colors. The skies here are awesome azure with cotton like ivory clouds! The magic the valley wreathes one with is accentuated with the quaint charm of houseboats or Shikaras of Dal Lake.\n\nA Flower in Mughal Garden\n\n2. To beat the heat:\u00a0 With scorching heat and temperature rising over 40 degrees, in most of the cities; Kashmir is probably the best place to visit to get a relief from the summers!\n\nThe view from Hotel New Green View on Dal Lake\n\nInfact, It is a delight for people from cities like Mumbai and Delhi as one enjoys the exotic hills and breath taking views of the mountain ranges. One would surely enjoy the pleasant weather in Srinagar.\n\n\nDal Lake at Night\n\n3. Adventure-Sports:\u00a0\u00a0 Kashmir is certainly the best destination for those, who are adventure crazy and love to experience adrenaline rush. The state of Jammu and Kashmir offers top class sports including skiing, golfing, river rafting etc. Kashmir pulls Lakhs of International tourists mainly for its wide range of adventure sports!\n\nRafting Point near Pahalgam\n\n4. Shopping:\u00a0\u00a0 The capital of Jammu and Kashmir i.e. Srinagar offers a rich variety of traditional Handicrafts, Leather Items, Shawls, Blankets and other good including Dry Fruits, Saffron etc. The floating market on Dal Lake is a must for all the Shopaholics!\n\nKashmiri work on a Shawl\n\nThe Sunday Market at Lal-Chowk is one of the best markets in Srinagar. It offers quality products at reasonable prices. The market at Jammu specializes in Leather Goods. One must remember to bargain at any of the markets, when in J & K.\n\nBangles at a Shop in Srinagar\n\n5. Cuisines:\u00a0\u00a0 The state of Kashmir offers a wide variety of Cuisines. Wazwan, a multi-course meal in the Kashmiri Muslim tradition, is treated with great respect. Its preparation is considered an art.\n\nThe Kashmiri Kahwah\n\nSome of them are:\n\n  \u2022 Rogan Josh (lamb cooked in red sauce)\n  \u2022 Yakhni (lamb cooked in curd based sauce)\n  \u2022 Tapak Mans\n  \u2022 Matschgand (minced lamb)\n  \u2022 Goshtaba (extra-minced meat balls cooked in creamy sauce)\n  \u2022 Qabargaah (Kashmiri Muslims refer to this as Tabakhmaaz; It is similar to Roasted Lamb)\n  \u2022 Syoon Pulaav (Meat Pulao)\n  \u2022 Modur Pulaav (Sweet Pulao, usually as a dessert)\n  \u2022 Lyodoor Tschaman (Cottage Cheese cooked in turmeric based sauce)\n  \u2022 Dum Oluv (Whole Potatoes cooked in Red Sauce)\n  \u2022 Muj Gaad (Fish with Radish)\n  \u2022 Nadir-Waangan (lotus stems with Brinjal)\n  \u2022 Nadir-Haaq\/Gogji\/Monji (lotus stems cooked with Spinach or Radish)\n  \u2022 Raazma-Gogji (Kidney Beans with Radish)\n\nNo No! These aren't Tomatoes, They are Kashmiri Guava\n\nOther Other famous cuisines include: Kahwah (GreenTea) and Noon Chai. Kashmiris are heavy tea drinkers. Over 20 varieties of Kahwah are prepared in different households. One must taste the unheard \u201cKamal Kakri ke Pakore\u201d near Nishat Gardens in Srinagar. Kashmir offers a vast variety of Kebabs. Non-Vegetarians must enjoy the mouth watering Chiken,Kebabs etc. But then, Nothing can beat the very own Lucknawi Kebabs! (Seriously),\n\nSeekh Kebabs\n\nMost of the people have Kashmir on their wish-lists, but they don\u2019t plan a trip because of the situation prevailing in the valley. I personally had the issue throughout my journey, but what I discovered was totally opposite to whats being portrayed. The media can definitely be blamed for the same. You can have an idea by the fact that Record 10 lakh tourists visited Kashmir Valley in 2011. The place is quite safe now. So, Go and enjoy the scenic views of the valley! Hope you all enjoyed reading :D\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Nandan Jha says:\n\n    Welcome back Naman.\n\n    Congratulations for scoring excellent marks in your boards and wish you luck.\n\n    A nice sweet story covering the major insights you gained from your trip to Kashmir. You forgot \u2018Tapak Mans\u2019 in the cuisine list. Look forward to read more from you.\n\n  \u2022 Welcome Back Naman,\n\n    Congratulations for scoring brilliant marks ( as described by Nandanjee) .\n\n    Thanks for this wonderful series on Kashmir. I am going to Kashmir this July \u2013 August but most days are for Amarnath and Vaishno Devi Yatra. If everything works according to schedule I will have 2 days left apart from this yatra . In that I will cover Pahalgam , Patnitop and if possible Srinagar. I will once again read your posts on Kashmir in coming 15 \u2013 30 days and if I have question I will ask via comment. please reply asap.\n\n    Once again Thanks for wonderful series of beautiful pictures and wonderful narrations.It was a delight. Keep travelling and posting.\n\n  \u2022 Surinder Sharma says:\n\n    Dear Naman,\n    In 70es we saw Kashmir in every film and I think every important place we saw through Hindi films. Now you describe so nicely and phtos are so good. I heard before in Kashmir goods are cheaper than rest of India , like to know about Bus fare, food items in market and hotel etc. I know house boat in Dal may be not affordable for everyone.\n\n    Thanks and regards\n\n    \u2022 Naman says:\n\n      Hello Sir\n      Yeah, I agree! 90% of the films in 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s were shot in Kashmir! Sadly, now the place invites not many film-makers! Well, goods in Kashmir are not very cheap (blame it on U.P.A). Its because of the decline in tourists and as well as unemployment in the valley! But, as I mentioned one should bargain at every place. You\u2019ll get to find the rates of some items almost double!! So beware! We stayed in Hotel New Green View at Dal Lake. They provided us with the complete package which included sight seeing and drop till Jammu. Thought we had our dinner at a restaurant near by (Ahooja ki Rasoi) which had served Punjabi Dishes! :D The house boats charge around 350 rupees for a complete Dal Lake\u2019s ride. Hope this helps! Thanks! :D\n\n  \u2022 Surinder Sharma says:\n\n    Thanks Naman\n\n  \u2022 Mukesh \"Ghumakkar\" says:\n\n    Welcome back. As always beautiful pictures and nicely written description.\n\n\n  \u2022 D.L.Narayan says:\n\n    Welcome back. Naman. Fantastic pictures. And, thanks for that amazing statistic: Kashmir had a million visitors in 2011.\n\n    Now that you have passed the most important exams of your life with flying colours, what next? We would like to know your future plans. All the best.\n\n    \u2022 Naman says:\n\n      Hello Sir! Thanks a lot! I hope that this year the visitors would break the current record! Well I\u2019ve cleared my medicals and will be going to BITS Tolani in Pune for Merchant Navy! That\u2019s the only career where I can see the world! :) :)\n\n  \u2022 Jyoti says:\n\n    I\u2019m thanking you wholeheartedly for sharing such a beautiful piece about Kashmir. Since childhood I have hearing stories of beautiful Kashmir. With your nice description of the place, I felt that I am witnessing the places myself.\n\n    Can\u2019t wait to give myself a holiday package to Kashmir.

The Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the largest collection of coral reefs in the world, spanning over 1,400 miles. It\u2019s so large that it can be seen from space, and it\u2019s among one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World. It is the place to go diving, offering a one-of-a-kind display of underwater life.\n\n2. Pyramids of Giza, Egypt\nAs the only one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World still largely intact, the Pyramids of Giza are definitely worth a visit. Dating back to around 2,560 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza stood as the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years.\n\n3. Stonehenge, Amesbury, England\nLots of mystery surrounds Stonehenge, and contrary to those who believe it\u2019s just a pile of 25-ton rocks, it\u2019s actually a beautiful sight.

Salar De Uyuni, Bolivia\nThis massive salt flat\u2013the largest in the world\u2013spans a massive 4,086 square miles. Formed by several ancient lakes, this salt flat becomes so reflective in the rainy season that it\u2019s used to calibrate satellites. It\u2019s effectively the world\u2019s largest mirror and a breathtaking sight.\n\n5.

        "text":"5 Travel Blogs you need to follow right away!\n\nTravel blogging has now become a career for many nomads out there. They are the one who survive on travelling, and breathe in and out on different countries and continents. They are the one who are on road all the year round. I know they make me jealous as well. But there are many of them currently to keep a track of them. So here are the 5 best travel blogs who would give you an insight of the world through your screens. Check out this 5 travel blogs and start following them right away.\n\n1.The Blonde Abroad\n\nKiersten\u2019s site focuses on the intersection of fashion and travel. She gives tips and advice for women on what wear, pack, and see while overseas and focuses more on higher-end, comfort travel than I do. Her blog is one of the best for female travellers.\n\n\n2.Hey Nadine\n\nThis popular YouTube channel by Nadine Sykora documents her experiences as she travels around the world. Nadine\u2019s zany, nerdy take on travel makes her videos entertaining to watch! She\u2019s funny, smart, and a bit awkward, but her film-making style really puts you there in the destination with her. There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s one of the biggest travel channels on YouTube!\n\n\n3. Skift\n\nThis is my go-to resource for all travel-related news and industry information. It breaks stories and provides detailed analysis on the latest trends in travel, on both the business and consumer sides of the industry. If you love travel as much as I do and think listening to what CEO\u2019s have to say about revenue and consumer tastes is fun, this is the only website that\u2019s worth reading.\n\n\n4. Nomadic Matt\n\nStarted in 2006, Nomadic Matt is a website you would land upon while you are on road. He lists down the cheap ways to travel and how to travel with $50 a day.\n\n\n5.

But more than that, he tells the story of the place and its culture through the food he\u2019s eating. It\u2019s not just about what dishes to order \u2014 it\u2019s about how food has shaped culture and vice versa.",

        "text":"Top Lists\n\nTop 4 Waterfalls\n\n\nIt is incredible that something as simple as water falling can bring us so much aesthetic pleasure. Is it the sight of water cascading over rocks that is so delightful or is it the sound the water makes as it crashes down towards earth? Maybe it\u2019s the fact that a waterfall is the perfect example of just how incredible nature can be. Or it could be a combination of all of those factors.\n\nWhatever it is, it is an undisputed fact that standing in front of a mighty waterfall is an awe-inspiring and humbling experience. Of course, not all waterfalls were created equal. Waterfalls range from mere trickles to gigantic sheets of water that leap over cliffs into ravines.\n\nTaking all shapes and sizes into account, here are some of the best waterfalls nature has to offer.\n\nIguazu Falls, Brazil & Argentina\n\nLet\u2019s start with one of the most impressive waterfalls on earth: Iguazu Falls. Cutting across the border between Brazil and Argentina, this waterfall is guaranteed to be one of the most incredible things you have ever laid eyes on. The entire area comprises 275 waterfalls, ranging from the thick, white curtain you have probably seen in photos to some smaller, more elegant cascades. The size of the main fall is utterly staggering, as is the spray it creates on impact.\n\nAngel Falls, Venezuela\n\nAngel Falls is one of the main reasons why people visit Venezuela. Measuring a whopping 979m, it is the highest, uninterrupted waterfall in the world. If you are looking to be blown away by nature, Angel Falls is the place to visit. The waterfall sits within the boundaries of Canaima National Park, which is in itself a remarkable attraction. As you walk through the rich, virgin forest take in the sights and sounds of the exotic wildlife on your way to Angel Falls.\n\nVictoria Falls, Zambia & Zimbabwe\n\nWhen you think of attractions in Africa, your mind probably immediately thinks safaris or Mount Kilimanjaro. While these sights are undoubtedly impressive, they are rivalled by Victoria Falls. This gigantic waterfall complex spans the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe and is a testament to just how powerful Mother Nature is. The best way to admire the falls is to take a helicopter ride over the top or to be daring and visit the Devil\u2019s Pools that sit on the edge of the cascade.\n\nSeljalandsfoss, Iceland\n\nThis beautiful waterfall is hypnotic to behold. Located just off the famous Route 1 that passes through Iceland\u2019s main attractions, the fall is easily accessible. Once there, simply walk along the path that leads from the road and you will find Seljalandsfoss. You can walk behind the waterfalls but make sure you take a waterproof jacket as you will get soaked from the spray. If you get there at the right time you might even be lucky enough to catch a rainbow reflectedin the spray of the waterfall. Be sure to take your camera as this sight is every photographer\u2019s dream.\n\nMost Popular\n\nTo Top",

        "text":"Take a Road Trip to See the Island\n\n\nI cringe when I see people's vacation photos of Maui and they're all from the resort.\u00a0 To experience Maui you've got to get into that car and drive around the island.\u00a0 From the crazy volcano that will literally take your breath away (elevation 10,000 feet) to a drive into the jungle on the Road to Hana, Maui offers travelers a myriad of sights and experience that are unequaled.\u00a0 Best yet, these are FREE activities.\u00a0 Let's go explore Maui!\n\n\nVisit a Volcano that Looks Like the Moon\n\n\nCrazy moon-like volcano\n\nThis is one nutty volcano!\u00a0 No, you don't see lava spewing out like you would on the Big Island but you'd swear you landed on the moon.\u00a0 This is no exaggeration, there's no other place like this on Earth.\n\nLots of people come here for the sunrise, a near religious experience and not too bad if the time zone difference works in your favor.\u00a0 Grab that blanket from the hotel - it's freezing cold there in the morning.\u00a0\n\nOnce there you can hike into the volcano but most people snap a few photos and then head over to the beautiful Ali'i Kula lavender farm or stop in at Paia Town, a trippy little hippy town with shops and restaurants, or combine it with an afternoon in Upcountry.\u00a0 Adventure types will want to check out a bike trip down the volcano, 26 miles and nearly all downhill, they'll take you to the top and away you go.\n\ntripadvisor Reviews | OFFICIAL WEBSITE\n\n\nSee What Got Everyone So Excited About Maui in the First Place\n\n\n\nDon't listen to those people who tell you not to drive the Road to Hana.\u00a0 Anyone who doesn't come away raving about this day long drive into the tropical jungle probably didn't take my advice and purchase the CD guide for their car\n\nWith the CD you'll find the hidden waterfalls and pools, some right off the road, along with jaw dropping views of the coastline.\u00a0 Without the guide you'll see lots of traffic on a winding road with screaming kids (and wife) begging you to turn around.\n\nThe Road to Hana is all about the journey, not the destination town of Hana.\u00a0 Wear good shoes and a swimsuit, bring insect repellant and a towel, and be rewarded with stunningly beautiful waterfalls and lush green tropical scenery.\u00a0 Start your day early to avoid the crowds and bring a change of clothes so you can end your day at the wonderful Mama's Fish House.\u00a0 Remember, Hana and the \"7 Sacred Pools\" is a great destination but it's not the goal of the Road to Hana, it's the journey along the way.\n\nTIP:\u00a0 Some like to drive straight to Hana and then turn around and stop at the sights on the way back, which is pretty smart because the worst part of the Hana adventure is the drive back to the resort.\n\ntripadvisor Reviews | OFFICIAL WEBSITE\n\n\nSee the Sights and Shop for Trinkets in a Historic Whaling Town\n\n\n\nI like Lahaina Town but like San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, a little goes a long ways.\u00a0 Sure, it's an authentic old whaling town with lots of cool history but it also gets a bit too touristy with the junky trinket stores and t-shirt shops and NO, I DO NOT WANT TO BUY A TIMESHARE!\n\nThat said, there is something charming about Lahaina Town.\u00a0 Come early in the day before the crowds and it's almost serene or arrive after dark and you can almost sense what it was like when it was a rowdy port town filled with rum drinking pirates.\u00a0 The giant Banyon Tree is pretty amazing and the ABC stores are where you can find the best cheap souvenir T-shirts.\u00a0 Good for a side trip and an essential part of any Maui vacation but dangerously close to tourist trap territory.\n\ntripadvisor Reviews | OFFICIAL WEBSITE\n\n\nDiscover a Different Side of Maui\n\nUpcountry Maui\n\nCountry living, Maui Style\n\nVisiting Upcountry Maui isn't a big adventure, it's a peaceful drive in the country through groves of redwoods and eucalyptus trees and into stunning views of lavender fields and rustic scenery.\u00a0\n\nAlong the way you'll find the old Hawaiian towns of Paia and Makawao and don't miss stopping in at Tedeschi Winery where you can sample their pineapple wine.\n\nCombine this with your trip to Haleakala Volcano or just get away from the beach and resort and go explore a part of Maui that's often missed by busy tourists.\u00a0 Take a stroll through the Upcountry Farmers Market to buy fresh local fruit, it's that sort of adventure.\n\ntripadvisor Reviews | OFFICIAL WEBSITE\n\n\nGet Up Close and Personal with a Blowhole\n\nNakalele Blowhole\n\nBeautiful Drive to the North Tip of Maui\n\nIn some ways the drive to the northwest tip of Maui is as rewarding as the Road to Hana - and a lot quicker.\u00a0 You'll pass pristine snorkel spots like Honolua Bay and beautiful spans of undeveloped coastline that will take your breath away.\n\nYou'll also find the Nakale Blowhole, a great place to put on your hiking shoes to get a closer look.\u00a0 But not too close as blowholes have a nasty habit of sucking you in and depositing you out into the ocean, not a good vacation experience and often fatal.\u00a0 Don't be chicken, take the short hike and check it out as it's pretty darn amazing to see the surf shooting out of a hole like a giant angry whale that you just poked with a stick.\u00a0\n\ntripadvisor Reviews | UnOFFICIAL WEBSITE\n\n\nTake the Shortest Hike Ever into Stunning Beauty\n\nIao Valley national park\n\nhistoric location of the battle for maui at Iao Needle\n\nGlance at your phone and if all of your photos are of you holding a Mai Tai then get off that lounger and head to the Iao Valley State Park where a short hike into the tropical jungle yields impressive photos that makes it look like you hiked all day.\u00a0 Look at you now!\n\nLocated near the airport, take the paved .6 mile path to see rushing streams and rising peaks, including the impressive Iao Needle, and learn a bit about the bloody battle for Maui (which has evolved into the bloody battle for a parking space so come early).\u00a0 See it all in about an hour, a great side destination and perfect for those with exercise-intolerance.\u00a0\n\ntripadvisor Reviews | OFFICIAL WEBSITE\n\n\nGet Your Nude On at a Local Beach\n\nBig and Little Beach\n\nWhich one is the nude beach?\n\nRemember this - Little Beach is nude, Big Beach is not.\u00a0 Little, nude. Big, not.\u00a0 Got that?\u00a0 Good because I don't want any emails complaining that I warped little Johnnie for life because you went to the wrong beach.\n\nBoth beaches are located in the south area of Wailea and are true local beaches.\u00a0 It's great to look behind you and see lush greenery rather than high rise resorts and you'll feel a bit less like a tourist lounging with the locals.\n\nLimited food so pack in your own and make sure you bring an umbrella for shade.\u00a0 Oh, did I forget to tell you about the sharks?\u00a0 Yes, Big Beach does have a reputation for being shark friendly but the chances of you being the only one left in the water if a shark does show up are pretty slim - you're more likely to get a sunburn than a shark bite. Of course, if the lifeguard starts yelling like he's Chief Brody I'd listen to him.\n\ntripadvisor Reviews | OFFICIAL WEBSITE",

Just 15 miles away in Kalispell there\u2019s the Hockaday Museum of Art, Central School Museum and Conrad Mansion (Open May 15-Oct 13)\u00a0 \u2013 \u00a0a hidden jewel of a beautifully preserved pre-1900 mansion of the founder of Kalispell, Charles Conrad, complete with over 90% of the original family furnishings.\n\nGet pampered: Perhaps in your day-to-day life you don\u2019t have time for massages & spa treatments \u2013 but now you do \u2013 you\u2019re on vacation after all!\u00a0\u00a0 Take a day out for a mani\/pedi, massage or facial at one of the many day spas & salons here in the Valley.\u00a0 We\u2019re happy to recommend our favorites or visit: for a list of options.\n\nGo thrifting: Yea, it\u2019s a thing now \u2013 shopping at thrift stores and consignment shops \u2013 what used to be the necessity of a broke college student is now \u201ccool\u201d and a great way to find one-of-a-kind unique items and fashion finds. Whitefish has 2 thrift stores and several consignment shops including the Chic Boutique and Copperleaf Consignment.\u00a0 More thrift stores and consignment shops are to be had in Kalispell.\n\nHike local trails:\u00a0 The Whitefish Trail is a great place to get some exercise and the snow will be gone long before the trails of Glacier Park are cleared of the white stuff.\u00a0 Pick up a trail map and get moving.\n\nBike: There are many local mountain bike trails less than 10 miles from the Moose, including Spencer Mountain.\u00a0 You can rent a bike at Glacier Cyclery and hit the road.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a local\u2019s tip \u2013 Bike the Going to the Sun Road before it opens to car traffic.\u00a0 In mid-May to early June (perhaps earlier depending on the weather) the park service has the Going-to-the-Sun Road closed at Avalanche Creek to car traffic but beyond that point bikes are allowed and the road can be cleared to the Loop and beyond before you run into plow crews trying to clear the road.\u00a0 The road offers spectacular views and you won\u2019t have to worry about cars.\u00a0 For road status call: (406) 888-7800 or see it at:\n\nSee how things are made: Montana Coffee Traders gives tours of their roasting facility and as mentioned in a previous blog post Whitefish Pottery gives tours of their facility to curious visitors who want to pull back the curtain to see how artists get their hands dirty to make beautiful pottery.\n\nThose are just a few of the things you can do in the \u201coff-season\u201d here in the Flathead Valley and I didn\u2019t even get to mention: Seeing live music and theatre, antiquing, gambling, fishing or just bellying up to the bar at a local joint to get recommendations on things to do and see from a friendly barkeep who lives here year-round.\n\nSpring is also a great time to get great rates at the Hidden Moose Lodge since it\u2019s our \u201coff season\u201d too.\u00a0 See our Specials & Packages page for more info.\u00a0 Then give us a call at: 1 (888) 733-6667.\n\nAuthor: Sarah Stewart",

Comprised of three stone houses built in 1502, the hotel is named after the town\u2019s founder, Nicolas de Ovando. Though the property\u2019s 16th-century architectural details and impressive heritage design are striking enough on their own, there are excellent on-site amenities here, as well.\n\n\ufeffGuests love relaxing in the outdoor pool and bar area (where you can gaze out over the scenic River Ozama), sipping wine in the sun-splashed courtyards, and indulging in blissful whole-body treatments at the luxury spa.

Combining modernist design with 15th-century brick and arches, the Billini is one of the most unique and exquisitely designed hotels in the Dominican.

        "text":"\n\nYet, steady economic growth and a particularly catchy \"Malaysia Truly Asia\" tourism campaign have helped lift the country to prominence.\n\nMalaysia is a tapestry of diverse cultural influences, drawing from its local indigenous, Malay, Indian and Chinese communities as well as its colonial heritage.\n\nIt's also a story of contrasts -- a place where smooth highways lead to both modern cities and lush rainforests, where street vendors set up shop in the shadows of skyscrapers and hipster cafes operate next to traditional kopitiams (coffee houses).\n\nOn August 31, Malaysia celebrates Merdeka Day, signifying 60 years of independence from British rule.\n\nIn commemoration, we've compiled a list of 10 things to do and eat in this unmissable Southeast Asia destination.\n\n\n1. Discover Malaysian wildlife\n\nMalaysia has no shortage of natural beauty -- it's home to one of world's oldest rainforests, extensive cave systems and immense mangrove forests.\n\nNaturally, this makes the nation an ideal destination for wildlife spotting.\n\nTravelers can observe fauna overnight from the safety of huts inside Pahang National Park, where the oldest deciduous rainforest in the world awaits.\n\nIn Kuala Gandah -- also in the state of Pahang -- guests can accompany orphaned elephants for daily baths at the National Elephant Conservation Centre.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre in Sabah on the island of Borneo offers a glimpse of these endangered great primates in their natural environment. They tend to swing by the viewing platform around feeding times, at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\n\nNext door, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre is dedicated to the world's smallest bear species.\n\n\n2. Stay in a village\n\nThe Malaysian Homestay program works with local communities to offer an authentic kampung (village) experience.\n\nCurious travelers can stay with local hosts -- or in traditional long houses -- both in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah and Sarawak in the east.\n\nThe experience includes daily village activities, such as preparing local meals, fishing, feeding livestock or learning Malaysian games such as congkak (a wooden board game) and gasing (spinning tops).\n\n\n3. Explore Gunung Mulu National Park\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak is famous for its millennia-old karst cliffs.\n\nFor keen spelunkers and climbers, this means challenging mountain faces to scramble up and explore jaw-dropping cave chambers.\n\nDeer Cave, for example, forms the largest cave passage in the world, measuring 400-550 feet in diameter. Located to the northeast of Deer Cave, Sarawak Chamber is the world's largest cave chamber, stretching about 2,000 feet in length, 1,400 feet wide and almost 33 feet high.\n\nBut not just anyone can jump in: Visitors keen to explore the more advanced cave systems must provide certification or proof of ability for the park manager's approval.\n\n\n4. Go whitewater rafting\n\nAdrenaline addicts will appreciate Malaysia's intricate network of rivers, which offers rapids for all levels of difficulty.\n\nFor class 1-4 rapids the Selangor River in the town of Kuala Kubu Bharu in Selangor, Slim River in Perak and Padas River in Sabah are just a few of the many popular destinations for recreational whitewater rafting.\n\nMore experienced rafters can head to the Telom River in Pahang to tackle class 5 rapids.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, Singoh River in Perak is where rapids reach a heart-stopping level 6 -- the highest level on the international rapid scale, only to be attempted by experts.\n\n\n5. Hunt for fireflies\n\nYour boat is gliding silently along a mangrove-lined river. Daylight is waning and suddenly, you spy hundreds of flickering lights.\n\nIn Malaysia, there's only one thing it could be: Fireflies.\n\nAlso known also as lightning bugs, or kelip-kelip in the local Malay language, these tiny creatures are beloved for their beauty.\n\nThere are several locations where travelers can admire the flickering insects, including Kuala Selangor in Selangor; Kuala Sepetang in Perak, Kampung Cherating in Pahang, Kuching in Sarawak as well as Sandakan, Semporna and Kota Kinabalu in Sabah.\n\nAs a bonus, some tour groups will even throw in a seafood dinner before or after the boat ride.\n\n\n6. Find an island paradise\n\nIf it's clear water and sandy shores you're after, Malaysia's got you covered.\n\nFrom luxury resorts to private islands, backpacker hostels and beachfront bungalows, there's an island experience for every budget.\n\nNot to mention a few of the world's best dive sites.\n\nThe rich waters are teeming with sea creatures, such as hammerhead and other sharks, barracudas, sea turtles and manta rays.\n\nFor diving, popular choices include the Perhentian Islands, Redang Island in Terengganu, Tioman Island in Pahang, Pangkor Island in Perak, Langkawi Island in Kedah, and Gaya, Sipadan and man-made Layang-Layang island, all off Sabah.\n\nPlan ahead as islands off the east coast are closed from October to February or March, due to the annual monsoon season.\n\n\n7. Try metalworking\n\nAt its height in the 19th century, Malaysia was the largest provider of tin ore in the world. And where there's tin, you will find pewter, a gray alloy metal made up of tin, copper and antimony.\n\nRoyal Selangor, the world's largest pewterware producer, gives travelers a hands-on introduction.\n\nOpened in 1885, the historic brand's headquarters offers two pewtersmithing workshops: the School of Hard Knocks for beginners and the more challenging The Foundry.\n\nUnder the guidance of a trained pewtersmiths, travelers use traditional tools and techniques to create their own keepsakes.\n\nRoyal Selangor, Visitor Center 4, Jalan Usahawan 6, Setapak Jaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;\n\n\n8. 'Backpack' on two wheels\n\nThe cycling community in Malaysia has grown dramatically in recent years thanks to emerging networks of cycling lanes in cities across the country, such as Kuala Lumpur, Shah Alam in Selangor, George Town in Penang and Putrajaya, Malaysia's administrative capital.\n\nMany experienced cyclists, too, are abandoning urban paths and taking to dirt roads to better explore the country.\n\nOne cycling enthusiast, Nadiah Aziz -- who blogs about her cycling adventures at Folding Tales -- describes cycling as \"the new way to backpack.\"\n\nAnd you won't have to go it alone: Many grassroots groups organize cycling excursions along lesser-frequented trails.\n\nAmong them are Cycling Kuala Lumpur, Bicycle Map Project (KL), husband-wife mountain biking team Doowaroda (nation-wide), and Kinabalu Iron Horse (Sabah).\n\n\n9.
