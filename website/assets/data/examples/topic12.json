My name is Zoe and I live in Hastings, East Sussex, with my son Harvey and dog, Milton. I have been fighting the fat for years but this time I am serious. I want to lose weight and gain health. This blog is about how I am changing my lifestyle so I can lose weight but not by just \"being on a diet\" but by making small changes to our lives so that as I lose weight, I gain health. I want my family to be healthy too and never have to struggle with their weight like I have. In common with many large people, I have gained and lost weight many times over the years. This time, I want to lose it and maintain a healthy low weight. I am interested in eating food that is nutrient dense and delicious and that appeals to children and adults. I do not eat animal products so follow a vegan diet. I try to use locally produced food supplemented with what I can grow myself. I support and try to use local farmers markets and farm shops. Another objective is to add more exercise to our days. It sounds so simple when I write it down :-)\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

        "text":"Highlights of the BMC Series \u2013 March 2021\n\nWhy do those bagels smell so good? - Vaccinated mother gives birth to baby with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies - The influence of politics on healthcare systems - Does walking through a doorway always make you forget? - Robotic surgery\n\nBMC Chemistry: Why do those bagels smell so good?\n\nHave you ever walked past a baker\u2019s shop and immediately felt hungry thanks to the lovely aroma from freshly baked bread?\u00a0 Smell plays an integral part in how we taste our food; if it smells good, then chances are, it\u2019s going to taste good too. Here, Lasekan et al. looked into how the aroma of the popular bagel changed due to differences in cold fermentation time.\n\n  \u2022 Dough A (control) was allowed to develop for an hour before cooking.\n  \u2022 Dough B was also allowed to develop for an hour initially but was then kneaded and placed in a chiller for 48 hours before cooking.\n  \u2022 Dough C was treated similarly to Dough B, but the chilling time was reduced to 24 hours.\n\nKey aroma-active compounds were collected via solvent assisted flavor evaporation and then characterized by a process called aroma extract dilution analysis.\n\nResults showed all bagels had similar roasty, malty, buttery, baked potato-like, smoky and biscuit-like notes. However, the odor notes in the long, cold fermented bagels were more intense than those produced by the control bagels.\u00a0 These findings provide a basis for more research into the effect of cold fermentation on bakery products in the future.\n\n\nBMC Pediatrics: Vaccinated mother gives birth to baby with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\n\nIt is well established that newborn babies can be protected from a number of potentially fatal viruses, such as tetanus or diphtheria, though the vaccination of their mother during pregnancy; the antibodies are passed from mother to fetus though the placenta.\n\nWith vaccine rollouts now underway in many countries, it would be hoped that a similar protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would occur for babies born to mothers vaccinated against the virus responsible for the disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2)\n\nThis has indeed been shown to be the case, as demonstrated by an exciting new case study presented by pediatricians at Florida Atlantic University. The baby, a healthy baby girl, is the first infant known to have been born to a vaccinated mother with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detected in her cord blood.\n\n\nBMC Health Services Research:\u00a0 The influence of politics on healthcare systems\n\nIn an age where our healthcare systems are under intense pressure, it is important to look at the services offered and implement change when needed.\u00a0 Clarke and colleagues from the University of Birmingham recently performed a systematic review in order to discover how the use of \u201cpolitical skill\u201d can contribute to changes in health services from both within and across organizations.\n\nThe review involved the analysis of 62 papers published over the last 40 years and from diverse areas of research. \u00a0\u00a0The findings pointed towards political skill certainly having an impact, with changes implemented via five \u201cthematic dimensions\u201d which include performance, awareness, influence, stakeholder engagement and influence on policy processes.\n\n\nBMC Psychology: Does walking through a doorway always make you forget?\n\nHands up everyone who has walked into a room and then forgotten why you were there. Interestingly, this is a well-documented phenomenon called the doorway effect, which literally refers to how memory can be affected by passing through a doorway or other boundary.\u00a0 Research into this effect has demonstrated that people can forget items of recent significance when they pass through a physical boundary (such as walking from one room to another), imagining that they have done so (i.e. metaphysical boundary) or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer.\n\nIn a study recently published in BMC Psychology, a team of researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute (University of Queensland) attempted to replicate the doorway effect with the use of both virtual and physical environments. The team ran four experiments that measured participants hot and false alarm rates to memory probes for items placed in either the same or previous room. Two experiments used highly immersive virtual reality, one used passive video watching and experiment 4 involved physically moving from one room to another.\n\nThe results of these experiments showed that there was, in fact, no significant effect of doorways on a person\u2019s memory. These findings cast doubts on how common the doorway effect actually is and also on the finding of previous studies looking into the phenomenon.\n\n\nBMC Surgery \u2013 Call for papers: Collection on Robotic surgery\n\nIn order to recognize the significant growth and advancement of robotic surgery over the past few decades, BMC Surgery is welcoming original submissions on robotic surgery. The collection will be edited by an international team of Guest Editors. The collection is open for submissions until 1st April 2022.\n\nView the latest posts on the BMC Series blog homepage",

These are trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 13, and trisomy 18. Growth retardation, mental retardation, and multiple congenital anomalies are associated with all three trisomies. However, each has distinctive morphological characteristics, which are presumably determined by the extra dosage of the specific genes on the additional chromosome.\n\nDown syndrome (chromosome 21) is the most frequent trisomy found in humans, and one of the most common conditions encountered in genetic counseling. General characteristics are mental retardation, distinctive palm prints, and a common facial appearance. The average life expectancy is now much greater thanks to improvements in medical care. Generally, individuals with Down syndrome have affable personalities and are able to be partially independent. The incidence of Down syndrome is about 1 in 800 children and is often associated with later maternal age (as may also be the case with other aneuploids).\n\nDown syndrome appears to be related to the difference in gamete formation (gametogenesis) between males and females. In females, oocytes are formed before birth and held in a static state until ovulation. In the case of older mothers, an oocyte may be in this stage for more than forty years, during which time environmental factors may affect the genetic material. In trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 patients, congenital abnormalities are much more severe. These individuals generally do not live much beyond birth. Both trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 result in syndromes characterized by specific dysmorphic features and severe organ malformations.\n\nIn addition to trisomies involving the autosomal chromosomes, aneuploidy may also involve the sex chromosomes. Two examples are Turner's syndrome and Klinefelter's syndrome. As mentioned previously, Turner's syndrome is a monosomy involving the X chromosomes. Turner's syndrome females possess forty-five chromosomes (45, X) as compared to clinically normal forty-six (46, XX). They are usually sterile and short in stature with some neck webbing. Klinefelter's syndrome patients have a trisomy involving the This karyotype of Turner's syndrome is characterized by a missing X chromosome. sex chromosomes and thus have forty-seven chromosomes (47, XXY). Klinefelter's syndrome individuals are sterile males possessing some female characteristics. These chromosome abnormalities are of interest especially for their implications in infertility and abnormal development.\n\nChromosomal Aberrations - Abnormalities Of Chromosomal Structure [next] [back] Chromosomal Aberrations - Aneuploidy\n\nUser Comments\n\nThe following comments are not guaranteed to be that of a trained medical professional.

When the relevant pool of patients is limited, as it often is, trials essentially compete for participants. There is evidence that such a competition is a predictor of low study accrual, with increased competition tied to increased recruitment shortfalls. But there is no consensus on what steps, if any, institutions should take to approach this issue. In this article, we argue that an institutional policy that prioritises some trials for recruitment ahead of others is ethically permissible and indeed prima facie preferable to alternative means of addressing recruitment competition. We motivate this view by appeal to the ethical importance of minimising the number of studies that begin but do not complete, thereby exposing their participants to unnecessary risks and burdens in the process. We then argue that a policy of prioritisation can be fair to relevant stakeholders, including participants, investigators and funders. Finally, by way of encouraging and helping to frame future debate, we propose some questions that would need to be addressed when identifying substantive ethical criteria for prioritising between studies.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 loading \u00a0Loading Related Articles",

Since people typically visit the dentist twice a year, shouldn't a horse's teeth be examined by a veterinarian just as often?\n\nAccording to Dr. Scott Austin, an equine veterinarian at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Urbana, horses between 2 and 5 years of age should have two dental exams each year. This allows the veterinarian to address problems related to the eruption of permanent teeth.\n\nIf things are proceeding normally, teeth should be checked once a year after that. Horses after age 15 might have issues that need to be addressed more frequently, and therefore their teeth should be examined twice a year.\n\n\"Although you can get an impression that the upper teeth are sharp by observing a reaction when the horse's cheek is pressed against the edge of the upper teeth, sedation is recommended to perform a complete examination of the horse's teeth,\" Austin said. \"You need to look into the back of the mouth and palpate all the teeth to fully evaluate the oral cavity.\"\n\nAll teeth should be examined to make sure they are not loose, as this is a common problem in older horses. A veterinarian will \"float\" the teeth, a process that involves filing any sharp points and adjusting teeth with abnormal wear.\n\nThis is important because horses' teeth grow continuously throughout their life, a condition called \"hypsodont,\" and the teeth need to be kept even to ensure precise chewing.\n\n\"Horses that live indoors typically require more dentistry,\" Austin said, \"because they spend less time chewing compared with horses that are on pasture and spend more time grazing. Less time chewing often means more sharp teeth, which can irritate and cause a horse pain if not routinely checked.\"\n\nCommon dental problems and diseases among horses include sharp enamel points, mal-eruptions (retained baby teeth), pulling wolf teeth, broken teeth, periodontal diseases and tooth loss. Very old horses can run out of teeth as their cheek teeth are ground down throughout their life.\n\nSigns that a horse might need to have its teeth examined include avoiding grain, dropping feed while chewing, feed retention, foul smell in the oral cavity, feed refusal, nasal discharge and rotating the head while chewing to get food to the \"good side\" of the mouth. Performance-related issues that might indicate dental problems in horses with a bit in their mouth include refusal to work and head tossing.\n\nAustin recommends feeding horses less concentrates and more roughage, which will allow the teeth to wear correctly. He also advises having horses' teeth examined by a veterinarian regularly to avoid problems.\n\nAn archive of pet columns from the UI College of Veterinary Medicine is available at Requests for reprints of this article may be directed to Chris Beuoy,\n\nSections (1):Living\n\nComments embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

        "text":"European Barberry\u00a0Berberis vulgaris\u00a0Duke\u2019s Handbook of Medicinal Herbs lists barberry as being anti-helicobacter, fungicidal and anti-parasitic.\n\nBarberry is a thorned, deciduous shrub growing up to 3 meters (10 feet) in height common \u00a0to most areas of Central and Southern Europe and the Northeastern regions of the United States. It grows well in dry, sunny locations, flowers in mid-spring to early summer and produces a fruit (Fructis berberidis) that can be harvested in early autumn or fall.\n\nThe leaves of the barberry plant are spatula shaped with numerous spiny teeth arising from the axils of thorns on short bushy shoots. Barberry has yellow, unpleasant smelling flowers that form hanging clusters, which form into long scarlet colored berries with a sour taste (1) (2).\n\n\nIn folk medicine, european barberry root bark has been used for various conditions including liver dysfunction, gallbladder disease, diarrhea, indigestion and urinary tract diseases (3) (4) (5). It has been applied in many cultures to treat malaria, and leishmaniasis (4) (5) (6).\n\nAmerican Indians used barberry to improve appetite, a function that was soon picked up by early American settlers. It was also reportedly used for treating stomach problems such as ulcers and heartburn (3), and is listed in the American Medical Ethnobotany Reference Dictionary as being effective in reducing fever (7).\n\nDuke\u2019s Handbook of Medicinal Herbs lists barberry as being anti-helicobacter, fungicidal and anti-parasitic. It reports indications of barberry against staphylococcus, streptococcus and yeast, and claims that it is superior in bactericidal properties to chloramphenicol, a commonly prescribed antibiotic drug (8).\n\nThe constituents berberine, columbamine, and oxyacanthine show evidence of antibacterial activity, with some suggestion that berberine sulfate might be amebicidal and trypanocidal (3) (9). Research indicates that berberine is specifically effective against cholera, giardia, shigella, salmonella and E. coli (10).\n\nThe German Commission E Monographs list barberry not only as useful for treating liver diseases, but also as a stimulant for the circulatory and respiratory systems (11). Barberry is claimed also to have anti-viral activities, and as a treatment for chronic candidiasis, indigestion and parasites (12).\n\nLaboratory studies have shown that berberine has some activity against E. histolytica in mice (6).\n\nBarberry is generally considered safe when consumed orally and appropriately for medicinal purposes, but due to its moderately toxic properties cannot be recommended for consumption in quantities over 500 mg. Barberry has been classified as unsafe to take during pregnancy due to its uterine stimulant properties. Due to the lack of reliable studies on the use of barberry during periods of lactation it is not recommended for use while breastfeeding (4).\n\n\n  1.

        "text":"Cell Transplant Repairs Diseased Nervous System In Dogs\n\nDecember 31, 1996\n\nApplication Seen For Multiple Sclerosis In Humans\n\nMADISON -- In a hopeful new development for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), researchers have shown in studies with dogs that they can repair diseased areas of the spinal cord by transplanting nervous system cells into the animals.\n\nScientists at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine and collaborators report the finding in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.\n\n\"We are cautiously optimistic that the success we have achieved in dogs may become the best hope available for repair of lesions in people with chronic MS and related disorders,\" said Dr. Ian Duncan, professor of Veterinary Medicine, who directed the research. \"But several scientific questions must be answered before testing in humans can begin. We hope to have these answers within the next two years.\"\n\nDuncan stressed that transplant therapy for MS would need to be combined with drugs that lessen or prevent on-going disease. While MS is usually widespread throughout the central nervous system, in many patients it causes chronic lesions of the spinal cord, and such patients might be appropriate first candidates for the therapy, he said.\n\nMS is a complex, chronic disease affecting myelin, the sheaths that surround nerve cells. Patches of demyelination, or lesions, along nerve cells can result in weakness, incoordination, and speech and vision disturbances. As many as 300,000 people in the United States have MS, which usually strikes young adults.\n\nSome MS researchers have been encouraged by the recent success of fetal tissue transplantation into patients with Parkinson1s disease, noted Duncan.\n\n\"This has been an important precedent,\" he said. \"These advances have shown us that nerve cells can be transplanted safely and effectively, and can survive long-term in the human brain without significant complications in the majority of patients.\"\n\nBuoyed by the Parkinson1s transplant experiences and progress resulting from his own years of research and that of others on myelinating disorders in rodents, Duncan recently turned his attention to a family of dogs born with a genetic mutation affecting central nervous system myelin. Although not identical to MS, the dog model offers many similarities.\n\nResearchers transplanted glial cells, the supporting structure of nervous system tissue, from healthy newborn pups or fetuses into six of the abnormal dogs ranging in age from two to 32 weeks. All of the dogs exhibited myelin growth at the site of the transplant and in adjacent areas, including one dog in which growth was noted for 27 weeks.\n\n\"A dramatic result of these experiments was the degree of myelination - seen as thick and well-compacted sheathing - achieved by the transplanted cells,\" said Duncan. \"However, the extent of myelination in dogs that received the fetal glial cells was even more remarkable.\"\n\nThe fetal cell transplants yielded growth well beyond the graft site, said Duncan, noting that migration of the cells and subsequent myelination was far greater than he and others had observed in earlier experiments with rodents. The experiments in dogs were the most relevant to humans undertaken to date, he added.\n\nThe UW scientist was especially encouraged to observe that nerve cells in the mature dog could also be myelinated by the transplanted glial cells. \"This is encouraging with regard to human transplantation, since most myelin disorders in humans occur in early adulthood,\" he said.\n\nMS and spinal cord injuries can also produce gliosis, a reaction that results in excess tissue around demyelinated nerve cells that may serve as a barrier to remyelination. Gliosis also occurs naturally with age in the dogs Duncan studied.\n\n\"We showed we could transplant cells into a mature animal with gliosis and still achieve significant myelination,\" he said. \"This has started us thinking that gliosis in MS may not be an absolute barrier to repair, as previously believed.\"\n\nDuncan said his group has targeted MS with this research, but several other disorders characterized by demyelination may benefit from the transplant technique.\n\nThe Wisconsin work is supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Myelin Project, an international task force of scientists working on myelin and remyelination founded by Augusto and Michaela Odone of Lorenzo's Oil fame.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nRelated Multiple Sclerosis Articles from Brightsurf:\n\nNew therapy improves treatment for multiple sclerosis\nA new therapy that binds a cytokine to a blood protein shows potential in treating multiple sclerosis, and may even prevent it.\n\n'Reelin' in a new treatment for multiple sclerosis\nIn an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), decreasing the amount of a protein made in the liver significantly protected against development of the disease's characteristic symptoms and promoted recovery in symptomatic animals, UTSW scientists report.\n\nNot all multiple sclerosis-like diseases are alike\nScientists say some myelin-damaging disorders have a distinctive pathology that groups them into a unique disease entity.\n\nNew therapeutic options for multiple sclerosis in sight\nStrategies for treating multiple sclerosis have so far focused primarily on T and B cells.\n\nDiet has an impact on the multiple sclerosis disease course\nThe short-chain fatty acid propionic acid influences the intestine-mediated immune regulation in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nThe gut may be involved in the development of multiple sclerosis\nIt is incompletely understood which factors in patients with multiple sclerosis act as a trigger for the immune system to attack the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSlowing the progression of multiple sclerosis\nOver 77,000 Canadians are living with multiple sclerosis, a disease whose causes still remain unknown.\n\n7T MRI offers new insights into multiple sclerosis\nInvestigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital have completed a new study using 7 Tesla (7T) MRI -- a far more powerful imaging technology -- to further examine LME in MS patients\n\nHow to improve multiple sclerosis therapy\nMedications currently used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) can merely reduce relapses during the initial relapsing-remitting phase.\n\nVaccinations not a risk factor for multiple sclerosis\nData from over 12,000 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients formed the basis of a study by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) which investigated the population's vaccination behavior in relation to MS.\n\nRead More: Multiple Sclerosis News and Multiple Sclerosis Current Events\nBrightsurf.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.",

Up until this point in my life, except for getting the odd pimple around the time of my period,\u00a0I was that\u00a0annoying person with\u00a0clear skin even though my skincare routine was minimalist at best. But as\u00a0soon as I turned 28, I started getting a few hormonal, cystic pimples on my chin and jawline, regardless of where I was in my monthly cycle. This quickly escalated into full-on breakouts that didn't respond to any acne treatment I tried.\n\nIt\u00a0wasn't until I finally stopped being stubborn and visited a dermatologist that I seriously considered\u00a0spironolactone, a prescription drug, as an alternative treatment to the\u00a0other last resort options I was looking into: birth control or Accutane.\n\nWhat Is Spironolactone?\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of the pill, join the club. I only came across it during one of my early hypochondriac Google searches before my hormonal acne was at its worst.\n\nThe reason that treating hormonal acne with spironolactone has gone under the radar is that it\u2019s actually an off-label use for the drug. \u201cSpironolactone has been around for over 50 years,\u201d\u00a0Dr. Cybele Fishman, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City told InStyle. \u201cIt was originally used as a blood pressure medicine because it\u2019s a diuretic and when you pee more your blood pressure goes down. Now, it\u2019s not regularly used to lower blood pressure, but to treat hormonal acne, female pattern hair loss, and PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] due to its anti-androgen activity.\u201d\n\nHow Does Spironolactone Work for Acne?\n\nSpironolactone acts as a roadblock for androgen hormones in your body by preventing them from overstimulating the skin\u2019s oil glands. \u201cIn women with hormonal acne, androgens appear to have a strong impact on sebaceous gland activity,\u201d explains Dr. Fishman. \u201cSpironolactone blocks the effect of those androgens. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are the main ones, but progesterones also have some androgen activity.\" This is why women often experience breakouts right before their period, as they get a spike in progesterone.\n\nBy the time I was first prescribed spironolactone, my hormonal acne was beginning to effect my mental health and my self esteem. I was desperate for a solution so I barely asked about any of the pill's side effects. So while spironolactone will drastically improve the appearance of your skin,\u00a0it's\u00a0not\u00a0a miracle pill so do not expect perfection.\n\nHere are eight things you should know before you start taking spironolactone for hormonal acne, from the aforementioned side effects to how long the pill takes to work.\n\n1. Don't Expect Instant Results\n\nAlthough I started seeing an improvement in the cystic acne on my chin and jawline after being on the pill for around a week, don't expect that spironolactone will work as\u00a0quickly for you as it did for me. \"It takes about three\u00a0months at the right dose to get the full effect,\" says Dr.\u00a0Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\u00a0\"If the dose is too low for an effect in you, you may need to increase the dose and need to wait a few months for\u00a0that dose to kick in.\"\n\n2. Spironolactone Might Not Work for You\n\nIf you've been taking the pill for over three months\u00a0and your hormonal acne situation isn't any better, it might be time to try a new dose or another treatment option all together.\u00a0 \"When using it to treat acne, spironolactone\u00a0is only used\u00a0in women and tends to work best for women with hormonal acne, menstrual flares, adult-onset acne, or conditions with hormone abnormalities and acne (e.g. PCOS),\" explains\u00a0Sejal Shah, cosmetic dermatologist and founder of\u00a0Smarter Skin Dermatology\u00a0in New York City\u00a0\"It is also often used in women whose acne is resistant to conventional therapies.\"\n\n\"At a high enough dose\u00a0it has some effect on all women,\" adds Dr. Zeichner.\u00a0\"The issue is that at higher doses it may be associated with side effects like breast tenderness or irregular periods, which get in the way with using it.\"\n\n3. You Will Pee\u00a0\u2014 A Lot\n\nThe pill itself is a diuretic, so frequent urination is an expected side effect. Personally, I peed every 30 minutes the first week or so I was on spironolactone. (Yes, I counted.) The interval eventually tapered off, but I still pee more than I did before I started taking the medication.\n\n4. Your Period Cramps May\u00a0Get Worse\n\nI've had borderline\u00a0debilitating\u00a0cramps every month since I started getting my period in middle school, and I didn't think it was possible for them to get worse until I experienced my first period on spironolactone. Dr. Shah says that it's possible that these\u00a0intensified cramps could be caused by\u00a0hormonal changes from taking the drug.\u00a0My cycle also lasts longer, too. (Lucky me!). But what I haven't dealt with is spotting, which is a common side effect of spironolactone.\n\nVIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot\n\n5. You Can Feel\u00a0More Tired Than Usual\n\nWhen my body was still adjusting to spironolactone, I was so exhausted\u00a0I could have easily fallen\u00a0asleep standing up while in line at Whole Foods \u2014 even though I was taking a very small dose of the medicine. Since then, my energy levels are pretty much back to what they used to be before taking the pill.\u00a0\"Spironolactone blocks the hormone aldosterone, which can lead to fatigue,\" Dr. Shah explains. \"In addition, it can lower the blood pressure, and if this drop is sudden, you may feel tired.\"\n\n6. It Is Possible to Still Get Pimples While Taking Spironolactone\n\nThe first six months I was on spironolactone, my skin was completely blemish-free. Then, I started\u00a0getting the odd whitehead \u2014usually during weeks when I was\u00a0under extreme stress or\u00a0had a few too many late-night pizza slices.\n\nWhen I asked Dr. Zeichner\u00a0about this, he said\u00a0that it's possible to experience mild breakouts after being on spironolactone for a year. \"You are not the same person you were a year ago,\" Dr. Zeichner\u00a0said.\u00a0\"The hormones and sensitivity to those hormones may change over time, which means you may need to adjust your dose.\"\n\n7. Spironolactone Is Safe for Long-Term Use\n\nSure, the everyday side effects of spironolactone are minimal, but what about the long-term risks of being on it? Breathe a sigh of relief, because it falls under \"very safe\" on the spectrum of medications. Although it's not associated with cancers (including breast or\u00a0ovarian) in humans, both Dr. Zeichner and Dr. Shah note that spironolactone\u00a0does have a black box warning\u00a0because high doses have caused tumors in rats.\n\nHowever, if you are planning on getting pregnant, you shouldn't take spironolactone. \"Theoretically it can cause birth defects, so you should use contraception if you are\u00a0on it,\" says Dr. Zeichner.\n\n8. Your Acne Can Come Back If You Stop Taking Spironolactone\n\nThe reality is that spironolactone only works when you're\u00a0on it. If you do stop taking it, it's possible that your hormonal acne will come back. \"The effect of the body's hormones will go back to what it was before you started,\" says Dr. Zeichner.\n\nSpironolactone may sound too good to be true, but if you\u2019ve struggled with hormonal acne and have exhausted other treatment options, this\u00a0pill may finally be the exception you\u2019ve been searching for. My\u00a0skin drastically improved once I started taking spironolactone, and even though everything's not perfect, I'm happy I made the decision to go on it.",

Author William Miller compares the nutritional qualities of this extraordinary food, manufactured by bees for millions of years, to those of refined sugar. His conclusion? They\u2019re complete opposites nutritionally, with honey providing vitamins, minerals, and other factors critical for life and white sugar providing nothing more than empty calories.

Original source unknown.\n\nArm and Shoulder Pain\n\nBy Dr. George Goodheart\n\nSummary: In this 1960 article, the \u201cfather of Applied Kinesiology,\u201d Dr. George Goodheart, discusses chiropractic manipulations and nutritional support for treating pain in the shoulder area. One of the most common causes of such pain, he explains, is the precipitation of calcium out of the blood and into the tissues in and around the shoulder joint\u2014a condition resulting usually from an overly alkaline state within the body. (For more on pH and health, see Dr. Goodheart\u2019s excellent primer, \u201cThe Acid-Alkaline Balance and Patient Management.\u201d) Other times, Dr. Goodheart says, discomfort in the shoulder is actually referred pain originating from dysfunction in the digestive organs, making nutritional support of the stomach, gallbladder, and liver critical to resolving the issue. Articles like these reveal the holistic understanding of the body\u2019s function\u2014and appreciation of the value of nutritional therapy\u2014that have long distinguished chiropractic care within the healing arts.\u00a0From the\u00a0journal Michigan State Chiropractic Society, 1960. Reprinted by the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research\n\nThe Acid-Alkaline Balance and Patient Management\n\nBy Dr. George Goodheart\n\nSummary: If you\u2019ve read anything at all about nutrition, you\u2019ve likely heard of the importance of proper pH balance in the body. But what is meant by proper, and where in the body should one assess acid-alkaline balance? Blood, urine, saliva, gastric juices, intestinal fluids\u2014each of these has its own ideal pH range varying from highly acidic to highly alkaline. Just how does a nutritionist make sense of pH and apply it practically? That\u2019s the subject of this outstanding primer from 1965 by renowned chiropractor Dr. George Goodheart, who presents some of his clinical observations in balancing pH in patients. While \u201cpH\u201d does ultimately refer to the acid-alkaline balance of an individual\u2019s blood, he says, one can assess that value simply be measuring the pH of the saliva, which mirrors blood pH. (Urine pH, on the other hand, does not reflect the pH of the blood.) And contrary to popular belief, he adds, diet alone is seldom sufficient to alter a person\u2019s pH, which is far more dependent on the functioning of the endocrine system and the ability of the body to digest fats than it is on the foods the individual is eating. Dr. Goodheart discusses both chiropractic and nutritional means of addressing these issues while presenting some of the classic symptoms of hyperalkalinity\u2014such as allergies, insomnia, and arthritic pain\u2014as well as those of hyperacidity, including breathlessness, dry skin, and hard stool. By addressing endocrine imbalances and poor fat digestion in the patient, he says, these often mystifying symptoms can be readily resolved. From the Digest of Chiropractic Economics,\u00a01965. Reprinted by the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research\n\nAcidophilus Yeast\n\nBy Dr. Royal Lee\n\nSummary:\u00a0In this primer on the benefits of lactic acid to digestion, Dr. Royal Lee explains the science behind his remarkable bowel-normalizing product Acidophilus Yeast (known today as Lactic Acid Yeast), which has the special distinction of being able to convert any dietary carbohydrate into lactic acid within the colon. Not only does this action acidify the bowel, thus killing potentially dangerous microorganisms and promoting balanced gut flora, but the yeast also releases enzymes that aid digestion, and it provides bulk to stool\u2014all of which help ensure proper bowel function. Dr. Lee backs up his comments by presenting a clinical study showing Acidophilus Yeast\u2019s impressive results in combating constipation, the researchers stating unequivocally the chief reason for the yeast\u2019s effectiveness: \u201cIt has been demonstrated time and time again that the stools of patients who are constipated are, in a very large majority, alkaline\u2026The lactic acid acts as a stabilizer of the hydrogen ion concentration in the colon.\u201d With many alternative health\u00a0practitioners\u00a0today promoting indiscriminate alkalization of the body, the words of these investigators are well worth remembering. Published by Vitamin Products Company, circa 1940.\n\nGuideposts to Mental Health\n\nBy Dr. Royal Lee\n\nSummary: Dr. Lee addresses some possible nutritional causes of mental distress. People who eat too many acidifying foods, such as whole grains, may become overly acidic, marked by symptoms of irritability, introversion, and the feeling of not getting enough air. People who eat too many alkalizing foods, such as green vegetables, on the other hand, may feel aches in their joints or a nervous stomach. Dr. Lee also quotes Dr. Benjamin Sandler\u2018s description of people who suffer from drastic swings in blood sugar: \u201cDizziness, faintness, nervousness, tremors, sweating, pallor, flushing, palpitation, tachycardia (rapid heart), abdominal pain, and psychoneurotic manifestations may occur,\u201d Sandler says. To combat such sugar swings, Lee recommends\u2014in words that speak to any nutrition practitioner today\u2014to \u201cavoid refined sugars as found in doughnuts, pies, cakes, ice cream, candy and other forms of sweets.\u201d From Let\u2019s Live magazine, 1958.\n\nGuanidine, Cider Vinegar, and Health\n\nBy Dr. Royal Lee\n\nSummary: Dr. Royal Lee lauds Vermont physician Dr. D.C. Jarvis, author of the classic book on holistic health\u00a0Folk Medicine. In particular, Lee praises Jarvis\u2019s recommendation of apple cider vinegar as a natural remedy for a host of disorders, from guanidine toxicity as a result of the overconsumption of meat to a dysbiotic gut to constipation to low thyroid to overweight. (Two teaspoons of cider vinegar in\u00a0a glass of water at each meal dependably effected gradual weight loss, Dr. Jarvis observed.)\u00a0Dr. Lee discussing Dr. Jarvis is a must for any fan of nutrition, history, or both.

Higgins, MD\n\nSummary: Excerpts from a review of studies investigating the connection between vitamin A deficiency and renal calculi, or kidney stones. This is one of the earliest tracts showing the critical role of vitamin A in the health of the kidneys. Although pH is discussed, the main thrust of the report concerns studies\u2014conducted in the U.S., Africa, China, and other parts of Asia\u2014all reaching the conclusion that vitamin A deficiency leads to renal calculi and lesions.

Hart\n\nSummary:\u00a0Perhaps the first published study of a probiotic supplement for the treatment of constipation and related bowel disorders. The researchers fed their subjects a special mycelium-type of yeast\u2014developed by Dr. Royal Lee and known today as Lactic Acid Yeast\u2014that converts carbohydrate foods into lactic acid in the colon. (The normal pH of the colon is acidic; this promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria.) Unlike lactobacillus-type bacteria, which can convert only lactose into lactic acid, Lactic Acid Yeast is able to convert any carbohydrate source into lactic acid. This efficient conversion restored the lower bowel to its normal pH and function and provided improvement in every parameter that was studied. Clinical Osteopathy,\u00a01940.

Price\u00a0\n\nSummary: The notion of \u201calkalizing\u201d one\u2019s diet\u2014or eating foods that supposedly increase the pH within the body and thus optimize health\u2014has been around as long as the science of nutrition itself. In this 1935 article, famed dentist and nutrition pioneer Dr. Weston A. Price debunks the hypothesis that an alkalizing diet helps prevent tooth decay. Citing data from his famous worldwide study of populations free of dental disease and other degenerative illness, Dr. Price states,\u00a0\u201cIn no instance have I found the change from a high immunity to dental caries [cavities] to a high susceptibility\u2026to be associated with a change from a diet with a high potential alkalinity to a high potential acidity.\u201d In fact, he adds, his data show, if anything, that good tooth health is the result of an acidifying diet.\u00a0Dr. Price further discounts the notion that an alkalizing diet promotes health in general and instead stresses the importance of eating whole foods rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly the\u00a0fat-soluble\u00a0vitamins so abundant in animal foods.

The roles of carbamide (a.k.a. urea) in denaturing proteins\u2014and thus reducing their antigenicity\u2014and of vitamin F (fatty acid complex) in defusing calcium bicarbonate (ionized calcium) into the cell fluids are virtually lost on orthodox medicine. Yet holistic doctors have repeatedly discovered this article since its publication in 1946 and been amazed at the clinical efficacy of the applied knowledge it presents.

        "text":"\u2022 10\n  \u2022 Canadian Neighbor Pharmacy: Discussion of Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Associated Hypoxemia\n\nsleep apneaThis study shows that a large majority of patients with sleep apnea and associated hypoxemia have cognitive impairment. In addition, this study demonstrates that patients with sleep apnea and associated hypoxemia have poorer cognitive functioning than such patients without hypoxemia. The hypoxemic patients with sleep apnea had a significantly greater number of performance scores in the impaired range than patients without hypoxemia. Finally, the degree of hypoxemia during the awake and sleeping states was significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea.\n\nHypoxemia during both wakefulness and sleep may cause a disruption in the biochemical and hemodynamic state of the central nervous system. Hypoxemia markedly affects central neurotransmitter function and brain adenosine levels in animals. Hypoxemia and hypercapnia also significantly increase cerebral blood flow in humans. Given such disruptions in the central nervous system, it is not surprising that previous investigators have found an association of hypoxemia with cognitive dysfunction in humans at high altitudes and in patients with severe COPD.\n\nPrevious investigators have found hypoxemia to be associated with impaired cognitive functioning in humans. Poor judgment, decreased memory, and impaired ability to perform complex tasks have been described in humans at high altitude.The severity of these impaired cognitive functions is said to be related to the subjects lowered PaO2 Other investigators have found cognitive function to be impaired in hypoxemic patients with COPD. Priga-tano et al found that performance on individual neuropsychologic tests as well as overall indices of neuropsychologic functioning significantly correlated with awake Pa02 in patients with COPD. Nocturnal hypoxemia was not examined in these studies at high altitude or with chronic pulmonary disease.\n\nTwo previous studies have described cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea. One study reported significant relationships between cognitive performance and sleep-related respiratory disturbances in 41 elderly men. Impairment of visuospacial reasoning, memory, and psychomotor speed were positively correlated with the numbers of disturbed breathing events during sleep. The second study demonstrated cognitive impairment in 76 percent of patients with severe sleep apnea. These patients had deficits in thinking, perception, memory, communication, and the ability to learn new information. The 76 percent rate of cognitive impairment in these patients is similar to the 89 percent rate found in the hypoxemic patients with obstructive sleep apnea in our study. Although the authors of each of these two studies suggested that associated hypoxemia was an important cause of cognitive impairments, measurements of hypoxemia during the sleeping and awake states were either not reported or qualitatively described in these studies. In addition, sleep architecture and sleep fragmentation were not analyzed in relation to cognitive impairment in these studies. Canadian Neighbor Pharmacy website is a source containing all news that you need.\n\nOur findings suggest that sleep fragmentation is a less important cause of cognitive impairment than hypoxemia in sleep apnea. The multiple awakenings and movement arousals caused by apneas and hypoxemia fragmented the sleep of hypoxemic patients with obstructive sleep apnea; however, this disruption of sleep did not significantly correlate with overall cognitive impairment in our patients with sleep apnea. In addition, the percentage of total sleep time in stages 3 and 4 sleep and the number of desaturations per hour of sleep were not significantly related with overall cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea. The lack of significant linear correlation between variables reflecting sleep fragmentation and overall cognitive impairment does not exclude a role of sleep fragmentation in producing cognitive impairment. Both groups of patients have marked sleep fragmentation, and a threshold effect could be present. Sleep fragmentation, nocturnal hypoxemia, and sleep deprivation can produce daytime somnolence, and daytime somnolence is a potential mechanism of cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of sleep fragmentation in impairing cognitive functioning.\n\nAlthough this study shows statistically significant correlations between overall cognitive impairment and measures of both awake and sleeping hypoxemia, no direct role of hypoxemia as a cause of cognitive dysfunction is proven. In addition, the high correlations among median Sa02 during sleep and awake Pa02 do not allow separation between effects of awake and sleeping hypoxemia upon cognitive functioning. Further studies using either daytime or nocturnal oxygen supplementation may help to define the relative importance of awake and sleeping hypoxemia in maintaining cognitive functioning in patients with sleep apnea.\n\nOnline Pharmacy",
