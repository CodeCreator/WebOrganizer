        "text":"Pocket-lint Podcast #86 - Sir Jony Ive, Apple's next big thing and Microsoft So.cl\n\nIt's podcast time again and the team discusses what Apple's next big thing could be after head of design Sir Jony Ive admitted that the product he's working on now is the one he'd most like to be remembered for.\n\nPlus, in a related chat, we look at the possible increase in screen size and resolution of the iPhone 5, and wonder if it'll be enough to compete in a market dominated by\u00a0monstrous\u00a0handsets. The Linters also wonder what consoles we may see launched at the forthcoming E3 videogames convention in LA. We know the Wii U will be properly unveiled, but what about the Xbox 720 and PS4?\n\nChatting about these things and more are former Gamesmaster presenter and editor of news Rik Henderson, editor of features and BBC radio pundit Dan Sung, and contributing editor and roving reporter Hunter Skipworth.\n\nEnsure that you listen below or subscribe via iTunes in order to get your all new and improved Pocket-lint Podcast hit from every Friday morning at 8.30am...\n\nHear the podcast\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload podcast (right click and save)\n\nListen (mp3)\n\nListen (acc)\n\nPlease let us know what you think of the Pocket-lint Podcast, and we'd really appreciate it if you review the show on iTunes.",

While a number of multi-platform titles brought their HD shine to a Nintendo platform for the first time, those looking for a new experience that was hardcore in nature were in all likelihood drawn to Ubisoft's tale of a zombie apocalypse in London.\n\nAs a title that hogged so many headlines before launch and has caused such divided opinion since it hit stores, Nintendo Life was keen to learn more. It's spoken to the game's Producer, Guillaume Brunier, the man responsible for bringing the project together.\n\nRead Full Story >>\nThe story is too old to be commented.\n1655d ago",
