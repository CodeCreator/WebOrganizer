        "text":"Beyond My Island Dreams\n\nFrom Tourist to Journalist on the Caribbean Island of Antigua\n\nRecently I took a trip I approached with both anticipation and dread .\n\nThe marrying kind\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d my friend Kay had said when I picked up the phone. Before I could utter a word, I found out the location was Antigua . And any thought of\nbegging off and just sending an extravagant gift to compensate immediately vanished.\n\nLately burn out and health issues had taken me out of the realm of the harried frequent flyer. The Caribbean was the perfect destination get me to shed my new land-lover ways. My fascination with the West Indies goes way back. Unlike other places I\u2019ve traveled, the ease and familiarity I feel there is wondrous to me.\n\nI like to think it\u2019s my ancestors welcoming me back\u2014generations later.\n\nHave press pass, will travel\nSince this was to be my first trek out of the U.S. in quite a while, I decided to extend my stay beyond the wedding and make it a working vacation\u2014making contacts and exploring the island as a reporter .\n\nThat Antigua was the first British Caribbean island to achieve freedom from slavery and that it has one of the highest literacy rates and income levels in the Caribbean already told me a lot about the strength and resilience of its people.\n\nChains of memory\n(population 78,000) has only been its own nation since 1981, when it achieved full independence from Britain. The majority of Antiguans are of African lineage, descendants of slaves brought to the island by the British to work in the sugar cane fields, an industry now virtually obsolete.\n\nToday the topography of the island is marked by over 100 crumbling stone windmills, remnants of the old plantation days and a reminder of times of servitude.\n\nEvery summer, Antigua\u2019s Carnival festivities celebrate the end of slavery in 1834.\n\nAfter all, not so many generations have passed since Antigua\u2019s people were fully subjugated by the British, and in many ways the wounds are still raw.\n\nA Beach For Every Day Of The Week\nKnown for its 365 white sand beaches, Antigua is a sun-lovers paradise. Many celebrities\u2014including Eric Clampton, Bill Gates, and Whitney Houston\u2014have had homes there and move around relatively unnoticed.\n\nMy first couple of days in Antigua were spent lounging on the sand and sipping pastel-colored concoctions. My remaining days probably would have been spent in the same position if I hadn\u2019t committed myself to discovering what the Catholic Church was up to in Antigua.\n\nSunshine and suffering\nDriving around town I noticed that, while most of the island neighborhoods looked pretty well tended, there were surprising pockets of crushing poverty where dilapidated homes of rotted wood, tin roofs, and outhouses were the norm.\n\nIncreasingly Antigua is suffering from some of the same ills as its larger Caribbean cousins, like crime and escalating violence.\n\nAlthough Antigua is a former British colony, much of the culture imported is from North America, and \u201ca lot of both the good and the bad has found its way here,\u201d said Cecilia Gomes, administrator at Holy Family Cathedral in\nSt. John, Antigua\u2019s capital.\n\nI learned Antigua is a country short on social services and those at the bottom often get left behind with little hope of catching up. Fortunately religious organizations and churches have stepped in to fill the gaps.\n\nSmall but with a reach\nThe Catholic Church in Antigua, although small, is strong in spirit and activities. Approximately 7.2 percent of the population (about 5,500 people) call themselves Catholic.\n\nWorking independently and along side other faith communities, the Catholic Church provides services ranging from elder care, health care, programs for single mothers, orphanages for homeless and abandoned children, education programs, food banks, and affordable housing.\n\n\u201cWe form a safety net along with other organizations to make sure people don\u2019t fall through the cracks,\u201d said Mary Rose Knight of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.\n\nAnd there is the issue of the youth. Trying to counter the negative influences of crime and violence on the community\u2019s young people,\nHoly Family Cathedral has instituted a series of programs focused on youth and family that are open to people of all denominations. The bishop himself participates.\n\nReflections and worries\nTouring the country and speaking with people working to improve living conditions for the island\u2019s poor, I felt I was truly experiencing the principles of Catholic Social teaching at work. Those who had more expected nothing in return except seeing the lives of others improve.\n\nNext week I leave for Haiti with the same sense of anticipation and dread, knowing but for a twist of fate it could be me on the other side instead of them.",

        "text":"Tuesday, July 22, 2014\nCurrent Weather\nLoading Current Weather....\nPublished: Saturday, 10\/28\/2000\n\nOrange blossoms as a great destination while in France\n\nPROVENCE - We're barreling through Southern France on a TGV bound for the Riviera. TGV as in tres grande vitesse. As in \u201cvery high speed.\u201d\n\nTo be honest, you don't exactly \u201cbarrel\u201d on a French silver and blue-nosed bullet train. You scythe smooth and straight through the countryside at a blurring rate ... 180 mph sometimes ... like a Michael Schumacher Ferrari in full song with 300 passengers on board!\n\nThe time to Nice will be 1 hour, 22 minutes precisely. Just enough time, if the muses comply, to tell you a little something about the Provencal town of Orange and a day we spent there, just messing about.\n\nWe went on a whim, really, because we had some extra hours to spare. It was easy to reach by train, we had never been there before, and there was Roman stuff to look at.\n\nWe've become quite besotted by all things ancient and Roman ever since we first saw the massive Pont du Gard, part of a towering, multi-level aqueduct system that carried water 30 miles into Nimes. It was built some 19 years before the arrival of Jesus Christ, and still towers over the River Gardon.\n\nArriving mid-morning in Orange, we immediately checked into the best-looking of the three modest hotels adjacent to the train station - a little 3-star number called the Louvre et Terminus (rooms $60, breakfast $7 extra), and struck out for town, maps and guide books in hand.\n\nThe Tourist Office provided additional sightseeing materials, and some instant smiley facts.\n\nOrange, pronounced \u201cor-AHNGE,\u201d has a population of 26,964. It was named after a Dutch count, is rich in art and history, has a reputation for good food and wines, and is home to two world-renowned monuments.\n\nOrange in season, Easter time and May through September, is a popular destination for foreign tourists - Brits and Americans mostly. But in mid-October, it isn't exactly bustling, which makes sightseeing and strolling an unusually pleasant proposition.\n\nOrange's Arc de Triomphe was stop No. 1. Located on the northeastern edge of town on the ancient Via Agrippa, which links Lyons with Arles, the arch was used for some 2,000 years both as a defensive tower and a war memorial. Our Green Michelin Guide spilled out the specific details.\n\nImpressively proportioned at 72 feet high by 69 feet wide, the magnificently preserved arch was put up in 20 B.C. to commemorate the campaigns and ultimate victory of Rome's Second Legion over the Gauls.\n\nThe battle scenes are still clearly visible in several stone panels. As are the helmets and javelins, shields and flags, anchors and tridents, skulls and scalps.\n\nRomans, 1. Long-haired Gauls, 0.\n\nTo visitors who show up for a quick look-see without any visible explanatory matter, the extraordinary edifice has little meaning beyond its obvious antiquity, which is quite a shame, really.\n\nBecause the next object of our visit, the 3-star Roman Theater, was on a two-our lunch break along with the rest of Orange, we took our omelets, salads, and carafe of municipal water on a pretty square directly in front of the 18th century Hotel de Ville.\n\nIntriguing here, besides the people watching, was the fact that the intricate wrought-iron bell tower was purposely opened up to the elements because the prevalent Mistral winds would have blown anything solid clear into the Mediterranean.\n\nThe theater, the real pride and joy of Orange, and the best preserved in the entire Roman Empire, was nothing if not sensational. Worth a visit. Worth a journey. And certainly worth the $4 price of admission.\n\nFor two solid hours we breathed in the Roman air. And the atmosphere. We clambered up and down the ancient stone seats and steps cut into the side of a hill and explored the many corridors and staircases to get the best possible pigeon's-eye views of the Great Wall - a stunning 118-foot-high backdrop, punctuated by bays and stage doors, and once ornately decorated with multi-colored marble pillars, statues, mosaics, and such.\n\nNine thousand spectators could be seated here on three different levels, arrayed according to social status, and they would look down upon a wooden stage featuring a mechanical curtain and a \u201cvelarium\u201d - a canopy that shaded the most noble from the strong Provencal sun.\n\nClever chaps, those Romans.\n\nIn ancient times, the theater was used for every kind of special event - political meetings and concerts, lectures and shows featuring conjurors, jugglers, and sword swallowers.\n\nElaborate plays were also staged there - but the contents of all those comedies and tragedies have sadly disappeared in the veils of time.\n\nToday, the theater provides a quite extraordinary venue for public spectacles, taking full advantage as it does not just of a unique and evocative setting, but of almost perfect acoustics.\n\nVery clever chaps, those Romans.\n\nFor us, the simple fact of being there, treading in the footsteps of the Caesars and imagining the scene 2,000 years ago, has vaulted Orange into one of our all-time favorite Roman holidays!\n\nReaders may write to travel advisers Roger Holliday and Claudia Fischer at P.O.

A portion of the well-known OTAs is Travelocity, MakeMyTrip, Expedia, Thomas Cook and so forth. OTAs can likewise give lodging\/room pictures to their customers, other than different subtleties like best arrangements, costs, and visitor surveys. Every one of these subtleties makes it much simpler for voyagers to choose the best lodging for their needs.\n\nMaster-bedroom Lynns getaway\n\nIn spite of the fact that OTAs are very famous in the movement showcase, one can\u2019t neglect the advantages related with making direct appointments at lodging sites. Direct lodging appointments are increasingly well known with faithful, visit, unmanaged and recreation business explorers who center more around the comfort and timetable adherence during their movement. While lodging sites especially take into account this crowd which requests a more noteworthy degree of personalization, OTAs are speaking to other class of explorers who lean toward rare recreation occasions at their very own comfort. The last classification of explorers is more value touchy and takes just a couple of outings for every year.\n\nAn overview completed as of late affirms that solitary 39% of in general travel deals online are shut through OTAs. The staying 61% of lodging appointments are made straightforwardly at the inn sites. Consequently, it is very obvious that the new age in the client is truly shrewd and puts stock in reserving direct spots like Samoa tourist attractions without the mediation of any outsider.\n\nVavau beach Samoa\n\nAn enormous number of budget hotel in Samoa\u00a0like Lynn\u2019s Getaway these days have their very own sites that have online reservation programming consolidated into them, empowering individuals to hold rooms progressively.

I haven\u2019t done so yet, but I still might. Since then I\u2019ve managed to find and report on fantastic affordable holidays in Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Morocco, and there\u2019ll soon be an article on Ghana. (The previous articles can all be found at manchan.com.)\n\nI realise it\u2019s hard to convince Irish people to holiday on a continent which has been branded in our minds as a place of poverty and despair, only worthy of our charity, but Morocco, 45 minutes by boat from Spain should be an easy sell.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned Sheherazad Ventures before, a travel company specialising in Moroccan culture and music set up by Rachel Blech, who used to present Lyric FM\u2019s Magic Carpet. She works in partnership with Abdellah Hajja, a desert guide from a distinguished Saharoui nomadic clan. Blech and Hajja run the usual 4x4 tours, desert safaris and camel trips, but their most interesting and intimate offerings are the musical and cultural ones, where they arrange unparalleled access to local culture. They are keen to develop links between Irish community\/arts groups and Moroccan ones. Mostly they focus on the Sahara region south of Marrakech.\n\nLast Christmas I wanted to explore northern Morocco, and so I settled in the mountain village of Chefchaouen only two hours by bus from the ferry port to Spain, but so far away in terms of culture that there was no sign whatsoever of Christmas. In fact, up until 1920 only three Europeans had ever set foot in Chefchaouen: two missionaries, one of whom was poisoned, and a journalist who was attacked for being a \u201cChristian dog\u201d.\n\nThe village itself is beautiful, a complex knot of cobbled lanes and soaring blue and white painted mud homes crammed inside high medina walls. The central Plaza, Uta el-Hammam, is disorientating timeless \u2013 women rushing with dough to the community ovens, boys hauling carpets past the red-hued Kasbah walls and mountain farmers dropping their bundles before shuffling into the Grand Mosque.\n\nI found it hard at first to access the surrounding Rif mountains until I came upon Chaouen Rural, a non-profit, community-based tourism initiative which aims to provide extra income streams for rural farmers in return for priceless holiday experiences. There are now a series of routes one can hike between community homestays or basic guesthouses through the Talassemtane Natural Park and and Jbel Bouhachem, an 8,000 hectare mountain reserve with outstanding trails through dense oak forest and Atlas cedar. One can learn about local farming practices if one wants, or else just enjoy the produce: goat cheese, dried fruits, honey, olive oil, etc.\n\nLike most community-tourism ventures, Chaouen Rural is still finding its feet. The website is only in French and Spanish, but they can speak English and with a bit more support from interested tourists they will develop. Gite Talassemtane provide similar eco-tourism experiences in the same region. Their cycle trip across the Rif mountains sounds extraordinary.\n\nSee sheherazadventures.com; chaouenrural.org;\n\nSign In\n\nForgot Password?\n\nSign Up\n\nThe name that will appear beside your comments.\n\nHave an account?

        "text":"One of my favorite museums in the world, Evergreen Museum & Library, is located in the city where you would least expect to find such an opulent jewel. It sits on 26 landscaped acres in a leafy neighborhood in the northern quartile of Baltimore. Walk through this Gilded Age homestead of the Garrett family -- railroad barons who built the Baltimore & Ohio -- and you get a strong sense of an eccentric family from the bric-a-brac that fills this 48-room Italianate villa.\n\nUpstairs, near the family bedchambers, the Garretts reclined their derrieres on America's only gold toilet seat. A proper throne, in short, worthy of the family, where even the bathroom's wooden shutters are gilded with 23-karat gold leaf. In the downstairs walnut library, opening out onto the gardens, the family gathered to read rare books. Among the museum's 30,000 volumes are 140 works constituting one of the largest private collections of incunabula -- books printed before 1501. The museum also has the first bible printed in America and one of the world's few surviving double-elephant Audubon folios (50 inches tall) of Birds Of America. The private theater on the second floor was designed by family friend Leon Bakst, the artist best known as the set and costume designer for the Ballet Russe. It is in this charming theater that Alice Garrett endlessly performed her amateur song-and-dance numbers before her captive houseguests.\n\nThe city's Mount Vernon section resembles a stately London square. Massimo Borchi\/Corbis\n\nWhy, might you ask, is Barron's Penta going on about a little-known museum? Because if you're like many wealthy folks, you're looking to plan some more family travel, and Baltimore can make for an easy and rewarding getaway between more exotic trips overseas. The city, to my mind, is America's Marseille.\n\nBaltimore's colonial merchant houses, the warehouses near the old port -- not far from the boarded-up shop fronts and buckled pavement made famous by the HBO series The Wire -- are all redolent of a slightly seedy grandeur similar to Marseille's. Baltimore, I confess, was never high on my must-see list of cities prior to my daughter's attendance at that pricey institution of higher learning known as Johns Hopkins University, but I have since become a devotee of this deeply atmospheric port city. It's an American original. It's authentic.\n\nBut you do need a good compass. The revived piers in Baltimore's Inner Harbor are predictably filled with chains, from Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 to P.F. Chang's, but veer just slightly from the harbor's fanny-pack pit-stops into the quieter adjacent neighborhoods, and unexpected pleasures await, often at a fraction of New York's or D.C.'s costs.\n\nMy favorite restaurant in the lively cobblestone streets of old Fell's Point is the Black Olive, a stylish Greek restaurant specializing in fish. Upon your arrival, the waiter guides you to a chilled glass counter for you to pick your dinner from the day's catch -- grilled dorade or saut\u00e9ed barbouni (a small-boned fish that the ancient Greeks deemed the only fish acceptable for offering to the gods). A few blocks away, on the edge of Fell's Point, stands Pazo, a fiery Spanish restaurant that has been carved out of a converted warehouse. A soaring ceiling, an oversized dining pit, and lush murals are the backdrop to wood-grilled mushrooms and arroz negro (black rice stuffed with shrimp and cuttlefish).\n\nThe Admiral Fell Inn, where Edgar Allan Poe is said to have had his last stiff drink, is smack in the middle of atmospheric Fell's Point, but my family usually stays at the old-world hotel in Mount Vernon, the Peabody Court.\n\nTHE MOUNT VERNON SECTION OF BALTIMORE, with its central 1815 statue of George Washington, is like a stately London Square surrounded by elegant townhouses, clubs, and brownstones. The Peabody Institute, the nation's second-oldest conservatory and now run by Johns Hopkins, and the Walters Art Museum are central to the neighborhood. The Walters' Chamber of Wonders, a hall filled with curios that a 17th-century Flemish nobleman might collect, such as a narwhal tusk, faux mermaid, and \"corn mummy,\" is a must-see, even with young children. Mount Vernon also has a very fine Afghan restaurant, The Helmand, owned by one of President Karzai's brothers.\n\nFor those with an adventurous spirit, I urge you to make your way to the funky neighborhood of Hampden, best known as the \"Baltimore kitsch\" playground of the controversial film director John Waters. It's filled with Sicilian-looking palm readers, antique stores, and some surprisingly good restaurants. Grano Emporio, in the bottom two floors of what looks like a modest home in New York's Queens, is in fact charming and stylish and serves squeaky fresh fare: The Zuppa di Pesce Alla Luciana, a robust seafood stew, followed by a flourless almond cake, could have held their heads high in San Francisco, London, or New York, but cost about a third of what those dishes would go for in those cities.\n\nA version of this column appeared Aug. 3 on\n\nFrom recent Penta Daily blogs\n\nInsuring the Yacht, July 31\n\nBoat insurance is evolving: Chartis will send divers to hunt for your jewelry lost at sea and experts to prep you for a gale.\n\nDisappointing Returns, July 23\n\nRich investors had median returns of 1.5% in 2011, said the Institute of Private Investors.

So real Hawaiians head for the far sides of paradise.\n\nMay 24, 2001\nOutside Magazine\n\nOur boots begin to smolder as we walk across the beach. All around, pinpricks of light bob in the darkness as other hikers hop gingerly from foot to foot. Then, with a noisy hiss, crackle, and spit, another wave of molten rock hits the Pacific, rolling instantly into glowing, red-neon balls. The 2,100-degree lava burns for a moment beneath the waves until\u2014poof\u2014in a cloud of white steam it's transformed into grains of black-sand beach. Here, at Kilauea Volcano, on the Big Island, we've just witnessed the creation of the world's newest patch of terra firma.\nHawaii is constantly being remade. Large swaths of it have become everything that adventuresome travelers dread: crammed, canned, plasticized, mai taied. But other pockets of Hawaii remain as they always have been: serene, lush, silent. And empty. Paradoxically, the more tour groups and honeymooners crowd Waikiki and Honolulu, the quieter the island backcountry can seem. Too many discriminating types dismiss and avoid this archipelago now. It's where people go for blue drinks and a bad sunburn. It's not a land, they think, of cloud-forest treks and badlands gallops and utterly deserted beaches.\n\nBut you can have this Hawaii\u2014and have it to yourself\u2014if you're willing to leave behind both established resorts and voguish preconceptions of the islands. Pack a lunch and a tide chart and kayak out to an evanescent sandbar. Swim to a remote beach accessible only by boat. Stare out for hours over a sea devoid of ships, populated by humpbacks, and indistinguishable at its far edge from the horizon. This is the Hawaii of those of us who live here. This is the Hawaii we seek out and love.

        "text":"Gibraltar Chronicle Logo\n\nExploring Mexico\u2019s ancient wonders\n\nIn this week\u2019s travel feature Janeve Freyone visits Mayan ruins in Mexico.\n\nby Janeve Freyone\n\nThe Yucatan Peninsula in south eastern Mexico comprises three separate Mexican states: Yucat\u00e1n, Quintana Roo and Campeche, as well as parts of Belize and Guatemala.\n\nAs far as Mexican destinations go, the Yucatan Peninsula has it all, from ancient Mayan ruins and the secret unerworld of Mexico\u2019s cenotes to colonial cities and the white sands and turquoise waters of Riviera Maya\u2019s stunning coastline.\n\nThere are a number of adventure and eco parks in the area and a vibrant nightlife in both Cancun and Playa del Carmen. As a holiday destination, Mexico offers a wide range of things to see and do, meaning that there is something to suit every type of traveller.\n\nWe tried to see and do as much as possible during our stay in order to make the most of what Mexico has to offer.\n\nThe Mayans were one of the most brilliant ancient civilizations and were ahead of their time in the fields of architecture, astronomy, science and mathematics. Therefore, from the outset, no visit to Mexico would have been complete for us without visiting some of the many Mayan ruins dotted around the peninsula, the most famous of which is arguably Chichen Itza, which was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.\n\nImage 4 - Traditional Mayan dwellings called 'palapas'\n\nThe site is dominated by El Castillo, or Temple of Kukulkan (feathered serpent), and the Great Ball Court, which are impressive both in terms of architecture and acoustics. As we walked around, hordes of tour groups could be heard clapping in front El Castillo, which creates an echo that resembles the cry of the quetzal, a Central American bird that Mayans believed was a messenger of the Gods.\n\nWithout a doubt, Chichen Itza is definitely worth visiting. However, it was our visit to the less excavated and restored archaeological site of Coba which was the highlight of our trip. We booked an excursion which included a visit to Tulum, Coba and a Mayan village through Alltournative, a company that helps to sustain small and secluded Mayan communities by providing employment to locals while also preserving the customs and traditions of the Mayan culture.\n\nOur first stop was the ruins at Tulum, a walled city originally called Zam\u00e1 (place of the dawning sun) due to being situated atop cliffs overlooking Mexico\u2019s east coast.\n\nAfter this we made our way to Coba. Despite its proximity to the coastal tourist areas of the Riviera Maya, Coba is often overlooked by visitors and for this reason is much less crowded. Situated deep in the Mexican jungle, the Coba ruins are surrounded by two lakes as well as various cenotes (sinkholes). In fact, Coba means \u2018waters stirred by the wind\u2019, an appropriate Mayan name given its location.\n\n\n\nWhat makes Coba unique is that it is the nexus of the largest network of stone causeways of the ancient Mayan world.\n\nThese paved roads, known as \u2018sacbeob\u2019, connect the various sites to the central temple pyramid. Coba was estimated to have had a population of around 50,000 inhabitants at its peak of civilisation, making it an important Mayan city. Although the entire site spreads over more than 80 km\u00b2, only a small fraction (around 3%) of the total site has been excavated.\n\nThe central group of temple pyramids is known as the Nohoch Mul (large hill), the tallest of which, Ixmoja, is 42 metres in height and is among the tallest pyramids on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. One of the main appeals of visiting Coba is that Ixmoja is one of the only Mayan pyramids that is still open to the public to climb.\n\nNohoch Mul is around 2km from the main entrance and as we walked beneath the shade of the jungle canopy, we saw glimpses of ruins nestled into the surrounding vegetation \u2013 it felt like a scene out of Indiana Jones\u2019 Raiders of the Lost Ark. Alternatively, there are also bicycles to rent, or you can take a round trip tricycle-taxi to take you there and back. Climbing Ixmoja can seem like a daunting task as the 120 stone steps to the top are steep and uneven, but the spectacular views make it all worthwhile.\n\nStanding at the top of the pyramid you can see the dense expanse of the Mexican jungle stretching out to the horizon. This was one of the most memorable moments of our holiday and was truly exhilarating.\n\nOur final stop of the day was a small Mayan community where we enjoyed a delicious typical Mexican lunch cooked by the local village women.\n\nImage 2 - Ixmoja temple pyramid - Nohoch Mul, Coba\n\nThe community still observes many of the traditional customs of the Mayan culture which are handed down from generation to generation. After lunch we ventured into the Mexican jungle to enjoy a refreshing swim in a nearby cenote. As we made our way there, spider monkeys screeched and swung from the trees above.\n\nCenotes played an important role in Mayan rites and were considered sacred as they were both a source of fresh water and believed to be gateways into the afterlife. Therefore, before entering the cenote, we were blessed in a traditional Mayan ceremony led by a Shaman. Swimming in the refreshing crystal-clear waters of the underground cenote was a truly surreal experience. A sole shaft of sunlight illuminated the extraordinary rock formations of stalactites and stalagmites adorning the cave, making this ancient underground world simply breath-taking to behold.\n\nThe Mayan people were happy to share their way of life with us which gave us the opportunity to immerse ourselves in their culture and made this an unforgettable and authentic experience.\n\nMost Read\n\n\nA Royal Marine at 19\n\nOpinion & Analysis\n\n\u2018Coronavirus is not the end of the world\u2019\n\nDownload The App On The iOS Store",

        "text":"Keep Pressing Forward: A Tibet travel essay by Devin Moore\n\nTibet: a magnificent place steeped in ancient history. Mountains dominate the landscape at every turn and prayer flags flutter in the wind as their mantras pervade outward bringing peace and wisdom to those below. Rivers meander through IMG_0457valleys like veins, providing life-blood for the farms that allow Tibet\u2019s people to eek out an existence in the harsh elements. Walking out of the airport, I was ecstatic and nervous at the same time; my first visit to Tibet was my first trip overseas at all. Jumping into the unknown halfway around the world was a test of fate.\n\n\u201cTashi Delek, welcome to Tibet,\u201d said a smiling man holding a piece of paper with my name on it. He draped around my neck a long white Khata, a sash symbolizing purity and compassion. In Tibetan culture it is customary to greet guests with a Khata along with the greeting \u201cTashi Delek\u201d. While it doesn\u2019t directly translate to English it is a word of welcome intended to wish blessings and good fortune.\n\n\u201cMy name is Sonam, you are Devin?\u201d he continued in accented yet surprisingly clear English.\n\n\u201cYes, wonderful to meet you!\u201d I replied as I shook his hand.\n\n\u201cThis is our driver, he will take us to Lhasa,\u201d noted Sonam. The driver, who\u2019s name I don\u2019t remember, chuckled at the language barrier between us, waived, and shook my hand.\n\nSonam\u2019s aura of kindness and hospitality was strikingly clear, and eased my nervousness a bit. I had made it; I was finally here, in the far-flung, mysterious, and exotic land that is Tibet. Thinking back to those first few moments brings about feelings of euphoria. As I climbed into the van, Sonam handed me a bottle of water, which I gulped down instantly. The effects of the drastic change in altitude were shocking. I felt parched and light-headed just walking through the airport. I remember stopping in the bathroom on the way out and leaning against a sink.\n\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d kindly asked a concerned looking man, in heavily accented English.\n\n\u201cOk,\u201d I responded as I nodded my head.\n\nAs we began to drive away from the airport Sonam and I made some casual conversation while getting to know each other a little better. Even though Sonam and I had just met and our driver didn\u2019t speak English, I knew I was among friends. Sonam answered all of my questions with delight and seemed to have genuinely appreciated my curiosity.\n\nOnly a few days after my arrival in Tibet, I was set to embark on a four-day trek to Mt. Everest Base Camp, high in the Himalayas. Looking back I had no idea what I was getting into. The terrain was fairly forgiving, but it was the altitude that I would battle. Imagine for a moment taking a deep breath and feeling as if your lungs still starve for oxygen, must be how a fish feels out of water. For some reason I had it in my mind, at least up until then, one could just jump on a plane, travel to the other side of the world, complete a four-day trek in the highest mountain range in the world and expect it to be a cakewalk. This was a journey that would test my mental and physical strength to the core.\n\nGrowing up I spent most of my time indoors watching television or playing computer games. I was always on the chubby side and was never interested in exercising or physically exerting myself in any way. During my high school years, I became more active and slimmed down but it still came as a surprise to many that I had committed myself to setting out on such an adventure. I hired a personal trainer several months before my departure to help me get into shape; I made headway in gaining muscle mass and even got to the point where I could run a few miles with no problem. No amount of training could have fully prepared me for the drastic change in altitude. I hadn\u2019t yet left the airport and it was clear that what lay ahead was to be an extreme challenge.\n\nThe drive to Lhasa, Tibet\u2019s capital, left me beaming at the mountain scenery and life in the valleys. Yak roam through fields and along the bank of the river that runs near the road while the people tend to barley blooming bright yellow blossoms that gleam in the sun. Leaving the rapidly expanding cities is like taking a step back in time, everything moves a little slower and life revolves around the seasons. I once met a farmer who watched the stars for their signal to plant, to harvest and everything in between. Gazing up at the heavens has always mesmerized me; I admire the wisdom, experience, and patience it takes to live by nature instead of the demands of the modern world.\u00a0 Some areas of Tibet have little space for crops, so the yak must be driven to mountain pastures to graze for the summer.\u00a0 During the annual harvest festival, after all the fields have been cleared, the farmers give their yak troughs of barley wine so they can drunkenly stampede through the harvested fields. When I asked why, I was told that it makes them happy after a long summer standing in the cold and windy mountains. Compassion runs deep in Tibet.\n\nWe arrived in Lhasa, the capital. Clearly divided into two sections, the west has new construction where hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese call home, the aged structures, built in traditional Tibetan style, of east Lhasa is where most Tibetans live. The east side maintains a grasp on its old world charm while the restaurants, shopping malls, name brand stores, and non stop construction on the west side is typical of a Chinese city. My hotel was on the edge of Barkhor Bazaar, one of the oldest parts of Lhasa. Buildings two or three stories high lie on each side of paths that wind through the maze that is the Barkhor area. Little shops line the bazaar selling everything from jewelry to household items to large slabs of meat. Outside the shops are shouting merchants that sell statues, incense, and little odds and ends from their stalls. The winding paths lead to a large square where Jokhang Temple, one of Tibet\u2019s most important temples, houses the only known statue of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, that remains in existence today. Sculpted in his twelve-year-old image, it was a gift given by the Chinese around 647 AD.\n\nDevout pilgrims throw themselves on the ground, prostrating in reverence outside the temple. Some walk counterclockwise in circles around it spinning their prayer wheels and chanting mantras. Large chimneys burn incense smelling of a mixture of pine needles and earthen materials; it wafts throughout the winding Barkhor area. The culmination of the smell of incense, the sights, sounds of chanting pilgrims, and the kiss of the dry mountain air completely enveloped me in a sensory experience like none that had touched me before. I remember typing an email that described what I was experiencing as foreign beyond anything I could have ever imagined. Witnessing the diversity of human life is perplexing and eye opening. Not only do you gain an appreciation for other cultures but also for your own, a break from the every day grind gives you the opportunity to realize that where you come from is a unique and a special part of the world.\n\nSonam and I became fast friends as he guided me through some of Tibet\u2019s most important historical and religious sites. It was only my first visit and looking back I learned loads. Still today, I\u2019m deciphering my recollections, notes on conversations with Sonam, or reading books and articles. The second time around, things really began to make more sense but it became clear that what I\u2019m yet to learn and understand would fill volumes. Although I still strive to dig deeper into Tibet\u2019s fascinating culture and history, it doesn\u2019t take an expert to be profoundly impacted. Up until then, I felt that human\u2019s existence on earth was seemingly pointless. It seemed to me that in the face of a universe whose vastness is beyond comprehension, human aren\u2019t even as significant as a drop of water is to an entire ocean. But seeing people so dedicated to beliefs that have been passed down over thousands of years made me reevaluate my how I felt. Walking where the Dalai Lamas walked and looking upon the towering Stupas where their remains lay, witnessing monks and pilgrims chanting their prayers as they light incense in offering to Gods represented by ornate statues touched my heart and changed my outlook on life in a manner that is beyond words. I felt a peace within my soul and life\u2019s persistent anxieties seemed to have just melted away, maybe there is greater meaning to our existence?\n\nWith the fervor of such an epiphany buzzing within me we set out towards Mt. Everest Nature Preserve, our camp that night was set amongst stunning scenery. At an altitude of around 13,000 feet there was still green grass and a river flowing near our campsite. Peaks rose up around us in the not so far off in the distance and the clouds, not able to drift any higher, seemed close enough to touch just by reaching up. We set off the next morning, the lack of oxygen was exhausting but I kept pressing forward through the vast mountain expanse. Splitting headaches awaited me at each day\u2019s camp; they were the toll paid to the mountains in exchange for the privilege to walk in their presence.\n\nLife is a struggle up there. While we sat in our camp passersby would stop and ask for food. I particularly remember a weather beaten woman who approached our tent. We invited her in out of the cold dry wind to enjoy a hot meal. With Sonam acting as our translator, she said that she had five children, there was no school in her village that owned few animals, they were very poor and the soil was hardly fit for growing food. Living was a daily struggle for her family, I think back to her now and wish the best. As we trekked past villages, people would run out saying in very poor English \u201cHaallo, money?\u201d Sheppard spend a lonely summer with grazing yaks and sheep in mountain pastures, living out of tents or roofless stone enclosures.\n\nOne day on the trek Sonam admitted, \u201cAt home I sometimes feel very poor and...

        "text":"Sipan Temple of Doom\n\nTravel Journalist Neil Geraghty discovers a lost world of fabulous treasure and dark mythology along northern Peru\u2019s Moche Route.\n\n\u201cVould you like a choc ice?\u201d An elegant Air France stewardess purred seductively as our Lima bound Airbus was bumping over a particularly turbulent patch of Amazon storm clouds. I was engrossed in my 3rd inflight film, Marsupalami, a rip roaring French comedy set in Palombia, a fictitious South American dictatorship located in the steaming jungle below us. Based on a 1950s Belgian comic strip, the plot is an hilarious romp involving a hunt for the secret of everlasting youth, radioactive orchids, narrowly averted human sacrifice and the mythical Marsupalami, a yellow monkey-like creature with superhuman strength. Biting into my choc ice, I couldn't think of a more entertaining way to prepare for an adventure in darkest Peru.\n\nA week later I was hiking along the slopes of the Cocahuayco river valley in search of another creature with a whacky name, the scarlet plumed Cock of the Rock, Peru\u2019s handsome national bird. My guide Jos\u00e9 had already introduced me to the delights of bird watching and consulting the gorgeously illustrated Princeton Field Guide to the Birds of Peru we\u2019d already identified sky blue tanagers, iridescent humming birds and bright yellow tit tyrants darting through the treetops. The winding path suddenly led out into a spectacular gorge flanked by jagged cliffs festooned with curtains of emerald moss. In the distance, we could see the slender white ribbon of the Gocta Waterfall cascading down a mountainside. At a dizzying 771m this 2 tiered waterfall is one of the tallest in the world and is a spectacular focal point for hiking in the northern Andes. A sudden screech emanating from the thick jungle canopy below us saw Jos\u00e9 freeze with excitement. It was the courtship call of the Cock of the Rock in which several males gather together and compete for the female in an intricate and noisy treetop dance. Right on cue the distant forest canopy erupted into a cacophony of frenzied whoops and warbles but no matter how hard we peered through our binoculars, the raucous Cocks of the Rocks remained as tantalisingly elusive as the mythical Marsupalami.\n\nPlaying host to one of the seven modern wonders of the world means one thing for most tourists visiting Peru; flying to the beautiful Andean city of Cuzco in the south and making a beeline straight to the legendary ruins of Machu Picchu. This has left the northern half of Peru relatively undiscovered which is a great shame as tourists are missing out on recent archaeological discoveries unparalleled since the golden age of Egyptology. 1,500 years ago the Moche Civilization flourished along the fertile rivers that flow down from the Andes. As the civilization slipped into decline, many of the Moche\u2019s mysterious adobe brick cities were engulfed by the Sechura Desert\u2019s shifting sands. Recent excavations have revealed temples covered in beautiful polychromatic frescoes and treasures as dazzling as Tutankhamen\u2019s.\n\nThe main base for exploring the northern deserts is Trujillo a charming Spanish colonial town an hour\u2019s flight north of Lima. As I walked down the steps from the plane into the fierce equatorial sunshine, I was fully expecting blasts of searing hot desert air to burn my face. I needn\u2019t have worried; Trujillo is known in Peru as The City of Eternal Spring and for good reason. Along Peru\u2019s northern shore line, the freezing cold Pacific Humboldt Current sends blasts of natural air conditioning into the desert. Temperatures hover around 23C all year round which makes exploring the desert\u2019s archaeological sites a delight. With tourists few and far between, Trujillo is blissfully unaware of its charms. The streets and squares are lined with attractive mustard and blue mansions with ornate window trellises. The skyline is pierced by graceful Baroque church domes and a sprinkling of leafy Plazas completes the elegant colonial ensemble.\n\nA short drive out of Trujillo\u2019s dusty suburbs and the sinister conical silhouette of Cerro Blanco, the Moche\u2019s sacred mountain comes into view. At the base of its black lava streaked slopes two vast temple structures were built: The Pyramid of the Sun and the Temple of the Moon. With over 130 million bricks, the Pyramid of the Sun was the largest adobe structure ever built in the Americas but what remains is a mere shadow of the original structure. In their lust for gold, early Spanish settlers diverted the nearby Moche River to undermine the temple\u2019s foundations forcing the walls to collapse. The smaller Temple of the Moon has been much better preserved and recent excavations inside the onion like structure have vividly brought to light a lost world of fascinating mythology and ritual.\n\nWhile visiting Peru\u2019s archaeological sites, it\u2019s impossible to avoid human sacrifice and the first space you encounter in the Temple of the Moon is a sacrificial pit in which dozens of skeletons of Moche warriors were found. With a disconcerting smile on her face, my guide explained how elite warriors fought ritual battles in which the losers were presented to priests for sacrifice. After having their throats cut and blood drained, a priestess would carry a vessel of blood to the king to drink. Meanwhile the hapless warriors had the flesh stripped from their body and their skeletons were used as ritual marionettes.\u00a0 My head still spinning from this terrifying slice of history, I then came face to face with the gruesome visage of Al Apaec, the Moche\u2019s chief deity. Otherwise known as The Great Decapitator, his boggle eyed, fanged face surrounded by human heads stares out from beautifully preserved rhomboid frescoes decorating the temple walls. The blood curdling mythology is mawkishly fascinating but I was glad to have a breather as I stumbled across a display of humble adobe bricks. The makers stamped each brick with an identifying mark and there amongst all the dots, dashes and crosses was a perfect Smiley, drawn a thousand years or so before it became a Pop Culture icon.\n\nFrom Trujillo I drove north through the mournfully beautiful Sechura Desert to the bustling city of Chiclayo stopping en route at the imposing ruined city of El Brujo. Located next to a majestic windswept stretch of the Pacific Ocean, the remarkable intact tomb of The Lady of Cao, a 1600 year old Moche Queen was discovered here in 2004. A striking contemporary museum of polished angular concrete and beautifully lit rooms shows off the treasure to breathtaking effect. Highlights include intricately wrought golden parrot and puma earrings, a beaten gilt copper crown and The Lady of Cao herself whose extraordinary mummy is covered in sinister spider tattoos. Displayed on a raised platform and lit by soft blue light she hovers above her treasure like a levitating ghost.\u00a0 I stood for ages contemplating the unfathomable world she must have inhabited and meanwhile hadn\u2019t noticed a small crowd gathering behind me. When I turned round I was startled to see about 20 primary school children staring at me in owl eyed wonder rather than this phantom queen from a long lost world. With tourists few and far between in this part of the world, you\u2019ll often be the prize exhibit as you travel around northern Peru\u2019s ancient sites!\n\nI left El Brujo feeling as if I\u2019d just been in an Indiana Jones film but perhaps the most mysterious ancient site in the northern deserts is the Valley of the Pyramids at Tucume. Here, 26 adobe pyramids cluster around a sacred mountain known as Purgatory Hill which is covered in the spiky arms of hallucinogenic Saint Peter\u2019s cacti. These plants were used by the Moche in religious ceremonies, and shamans still travel to the mountain to imbibe the drug and perform ritual divinations. A rocky path leads up the mountainside to a look out where I sat down on a parapet to take in the magnificent view. A fresh breeze was blowing in from the Pacific and the staccato trill of mocking birds was echoing around the mountain slopes. The eroded pyramids resemble giant termite mounds and are dotted by the flapping tarpaulins of archaeological digs. Treasures are discovered almost every year in this part of the world and the whole region has become a looter\u2019s paradise. I idly fantasised about buying a metal detector and discovering a quick and easy fortune. At that moment a giant black bee flew straight into my face and I almost toppled backwards off the parapet in surprise. I was a hair\u2019s breadth away from becoming an impromptu human sacrifice myself and I made a mental note in future to be more respectful when visiting sacred sites lest I incur the wrath of vengeful ancient Gods.\u00a0 After all, in a land where the Great Decapitator once held sway, you can never be too careful.\n\nTailor-made holidays\n\nFlexible, custom-made holidays to Latin America created to match your exact requirements: our tailor-made itineraries are as unique as the clients for whom they are designed.\n\nDesign my trip",

        "text":"The Landmark Hotel: No longer \"The Kremlin\"\n\nOur Arts Correspondent Kevin Wilson peels the layers back on one of London\u2019s grand hotels.\n\nLandmark Hotel\n\nThe tucked away Gazebo is perfect for informal business meetings\n\nMany years ago when money piles were higher, a wealthy art collector put me up at the Landmark Hotel for a few weeks while we shopped London to death to fill up his Bishop\u2019s Avenue house.\u00a0\n\nBack then I was still as fussy, difficult and hyper critical as I am now.\u00a0 But the suite at the Landmark was perfect: \u00a0John Burton Race ran the restaurant and the room service was so good it kept me plonked in my room for days.\u00a0\n\nThis huge chunky chunk of a building started life in 1899 as the last of the great Victorian railway hotels that were constructed during \u2018the golden age of steam\u2019. Originally named the Great Central Hotel, it was a fancy, fancy place with a huge central courtyard designed to accommodate the carriages delivering the well healed.\u00a0\n\nSince then it\u2019s had a roller coaster history. The courtyard was roofed to enable a dance floor for the 1920\u2019s flappers, while the craze for this new thing called the motor car began to reduce rail passenger numbers significantly until eventually the hotel became redundant and was forced to close.\n\nFor the next 40 years the elegant building sobbed in protest and was dubbed \u201cThe Kremlin\u201d by the staff of the British Railways Board who had moved in and headquartered there. \u00a0Papers were pushed and typewriters bashed. The opulent rooms reduced to housing timetable clerks and lost luggage claims.\n\nWho might you see: \u00a0residents have included: Katy Perry, Jack Black, Keira Knightley, Natalie Cassidy and Freddie Flintoff and I did have a nice chat with Belinda Carlisle there once.\n\nHurray for Ritz Carlton who saved the day \u2013 the hotel brand kicked BRB out and put back beds and carpets. Once done Ritz promptly sold it on to the Four Seasons group who renamed the hotel The Regent. But this incarnation lasted only two years when Four Seasons sold it onto the Lancaster Landmark Hotel Company in 1995.\n\nThe Landmark as we know it now was born.\n\nIt is now a sprawling labyrinthine building that uses all of its space well. It has a range of 11 flexible meeting and conference rooms and state of the art technical facilities. It is a big enough hotel to do business in but relax without any friction.\n\nAlthough it started life as a 700 bedroom hotel, this has been pared down to 300 five star rooms which includes 51 suites.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s privacy and general OTT-ness also makes for an ideal wedding venue. (I\u2019ve been to a couple here and they have been seamless affairs;\u00a0 many corners for the bride to cry in and enough ostentatious trappings to make the bride\u2019s father feel he\u2019s got his money\u2019s worth.)\n\nA stay here is suited for the mid to top end traveller, and the large corporate expense account tenant.\n\nIn recent years the Landmark has maintained its excellent standards of hospitality in its rooms and this is down to superb housekeeping. My colander head partner left a pricey ring on the floor of the room after we checked out once and, true to form, they rang the next day and couriered its return.\n\nOne thing I like about the rooms is the space. Nowadays online it\u2019s the norm to see what room size your money buys. You can get a nice 30 per cent more space for your money at the Landmark. Perfect for swinging a cat or colander headed partner around. \u00a0Most of the rooms have corridors so you don\u2019t hear the hallway footfall and its walls are thick so you\u2019ll need more than a glass to your ear to hear them next door. They have a very wide range of rooms and prices, the smallest never feel small and the larger suites feel\u2026 well, large.\n\nOne of the Landmark\u2019s USP\u2019s is the absence of chain memorabilia. There is only one Landmark London, not 246, and you do feel you have landed somewhere unique and special.\n\nLandmark Hotel\n\nRoom to play group Twister. The spacious corner Executive Suite\n\nThink romance, think opulence. Think the restaurant from the film Brazil and you are there. As for its Winter Garden restaurant, it has to be one of my favourite places in London to dine. Take someone there if you want them to give a small gasp. It\u2019s that sort of place. The food is special.\u00a0 I have had a dozen or so meals there in the last two years and all were consistently wonderful. That\u2019s rare.\n\nLandmark Hotel\n\nThe eight story Winter Garden by day; it transforms into Romance Island at night\n\nOn this occasion I had the carpaccio of Casterbridge beef which melted before the knife touched it. I chased that with a whole Dover sole teamed with a duvet of perfect hollandaise; faultless food. My dinning partner (who is notably fussier than I am), knifed into a perfectly roasted quail followed by\u2026 fish and chips \u2013 I know, I know, but it was three types of fish beautifully battered.\u00a0\n\nThe deserts went perfectly with the palm trees and soft plonkings of the grand piano, lots of bits and pieces of caramelised this and fondant that rounded off a perfect meal.\u00a0 A couple of bottles of a special Sancerre gave everyone in the room a nice sparkly halo.\n\nYou leave feeling unrushed, occasioned and you take away a piece of the hotel\u2019s grand origins.\n\nSo there must be something to criticise after years of rooming and eating here. I am thinking hard and really the only thing that springs to mind is that when the luxurious swimming pool and spa get a bit busy, the changing rooms can get a bit cramped. I\u2019m not partial to having a strange bloke throw his y-fronts on my shoulder while aiming for his locker; but the answer is to phone down to the spa to find the quiet times.\n\nDespite being central, The Landmark is tucked away in Marylebone and provides an oasis for formal or informal meetings. It would be my hotel of choice for high end clandestine canoodlings, except the secret\u2019s out now, I\u2019ll have to go somewhere else for that.\n\nThe Suitometer: LLB\u2019s quick guide to sleeping and dining in the capital\n\nWould a stay at the Landmark London\u2026.\n\n  \u2022 Inspire a productive business meeting?\u00a0Without doubt. Who could fail to agree to your terms in such an idyllic setting? All the meeting rooms and conference facilities are spot on.\n  \u2022 Impress the boss when everything else has failed? A big yes, but he may think he\u2019s paying you too much if you take him there \u2013 so say your mother gets a discount .\n  \u2022 Break the ice with those awkward clients?\u00a0 One of the less formal bars would break a glacier. Try the tucked away Mirror Bar.\n  \u2022 Sufficiently blow your bonus and make you feel like a king?\u00a0Totally, stay in the Presidential Suite at \u00a34000 a night and enjoy the top end room service.\n  \u2022 Provide the right setting for an all-important first date?\u00a0At night the palm trees light up and the grand piano kicks in, perfect place to propose - even to someone on the next table.\n\nThe Landmark London is located at 222, Marylebone Road, London NW1 6JQ, right outside Marylebone Station.\u00a0 Telephone +44 20 7631 8000 Room prices vary greatly with a selection of packages and advanced offers. On average expect to pay from around \u00a3250 a night. Regular stayers benefit from \u00a0e-club discounts.\n\nKevin Wilson\u00a0is an international arts consultant, curator and collector.

        "text":"Cruise Industry Trends From the 70s to 90s\n\nIn 1974, to boost a declining market, Cunard Line Limited, the company running transatlantic travel service between New York and London with the Queen Elizabeth II, hired international celebrities to perform cabaret acts aboard ship. They advertised the crossing as a vacation\/entertainment experience with Las Vegas \u2013 caliber shows.\n\nThe Cruise Industry has had Some Major Improvements over the Years\n\nThe QE2, still one of the fastest passenger liners afloat with a maximum cruising speed of 38 knots, was the perfect vessel to inaugurate these changes. While it was fast enough to whisk passengers from London to New York in just four days, it was elegant enough to stage big productions. The QE2 also ushered in the concept of \u201cone-class\u201d cruising, as the ship\u2019s facilities and amenities were made available to all passengers. Regardless of the staterooms or berths passengers had booked, they enjoyed the same service, menus, entertainment, and activities. The idea caught on, and the general public began taking cruises for short vacations, rather than solely as a means of transportation. Of course, it would only be fair to also give credit to the creators of the original \u201cLove Boat\u201d 1970s television series for the resurgence in popularity of romantic cruises for singles and couples. While the show\u2019s storylines were made of the usual Hollywood fluff, its gorgeous scenery and exotic ports of call had an undeniable impact on millions of viewers every week.\n\nThe cruise industry broke new ground again in the 1980s launching a fleet of giant passenger liners, some capable of carrying over 2,000 people. These megaships were built exclusively for vacationers, maintaining a cruising schedule to sun-drenched locales around the globe. Unlike their predecessors, this fleet was designed as all-inclusive magnificent floating hotels with casinos, running tracks, spas, champagne and caviar bars, basketball courts, private stateroom verandahs, and three-story nightclubs. Suddenly, ports of call were not the main selling point for travelers. Instead, people were interested in the whole experience of just being on board. Carnival Cruise Lines made quite a splash marketing its shipboard experience rather than its destinations to the vacationing public.\n\nQuickly, many other major cruise lines followed suit. Throughout these new glittering palaces the message was \u201cluxury for the masses,\u201d and for the most part, this is still the rallying cry of the cruise industry.\n\nWhere have the wealthy pleasure cruisers gone? The upscale cruise lines found their niche as well by using a fleet of smaller ships that can visit secluded ports, avoiding the popular bustle of big-name destinations. Additionally, concern for the environment has created cruise itineraries that involve ecologically friendly agendas. Termed \u201ceco-tours,\u201d this new branch of the tourism industry balances the needs of the environment with the desire to see the world. Companies specializing in eco-cruises focus on education, wildlife, and relaxation, rather than entertainment, gambling, and margaritas. The ships are small and fares are often high, but they guarantee exotic, quiet destinations and a healthy conscience. The markets continue to grow steadily for these specialized companies.\n\nSign up for our newsletter!",

        "text":"previous page\nnext page\n\nVictoria Peak\n\nIn the winter of 1993, I hardly even knew that the country of Belize exisited. That was until I read \"Jaguar\", Alan Robinowitzs' dramatic account of his attempt to create the world's first Jaguar Reserve. One passage was exceptionally intriguing to me. It was his description of Victoria Peak, then thought to be the tallest mountain in Belize. Alan wrote, \"It was not until 1984, while I was in the basin, that a group of fifteen Belize Defense Forse soldiers made what was to my knowledge the first successful attempt from the south. It took them two weeks, and only one man, a Maya Indian, made it to the top of Victoria Peak.\" I wondered how many people had been successful in climbing to the top of that mysterious and remote mountain in the 9 years since Alan wrote that passage. I vowed that one day, I would follow in the foot prints of that one Maya man, and climb to the top of Victoria Peak. Ten years later, in July of 2003, I had my chance.\n\nVictoria Peak (3675 feet) is located on the remote northern boundary of the 150 sq. mile Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and Jaguar Preserve. Anyone who has been off the coast of Belize on a clear day has seen it looming in the distance. Big, tall and impressive. It is often shrouded in clouds and until recently thought to be the highest mountain in Belize. It is a total of 28 km to the summit from the Cockscomb headquarters. So the round trip is approx. 35 miles. It was indeed a difficult hike, often described as the \"hardest hike in Belize.\"\n\non the trail to Victoria Peak\nMarcos, Eduardo and Valentino on the trail\nto Victoria Peak.\nWith all our provisions stored in our backpacks, my guides Marcos Cucul, Eduardo Pop, Valentino Kzub and I hiked from the Cockscomb headquarters for 12 km to a small camp next to the Sittee River where we spent the first night. The hike to km 12 was easy and enjoyable. The Belize Audubon Society now controls and manages the reserve and has done an excellent job maintaining the trail. Sitting by the river camp that evening was a bird watcher paradise. We spotted a pair of Great Carrosaws flying between tree tops and heard the clicking sounds of the White-collared Manakin and the unforgettable songs of the Oropendola. As the sun set and we prepared to retire into our hammocks we were treated to the haunting calls of the Howler monkeys in the far distance.\n\nThe following day we hiked to km 19. Here the hiking becomes much harder. Even though the distance is only a total of 7 km, the hike is much more arduous than the first day. The trail was in good condition and the weather cooperated but we started a series of continuous up and down grades of between 20-60 degrees. There are no switch backs. Just straight up and down. Many times just hanging on to trees or roots to maintain footing. The jungle is incredibly vibrant and lush here. No secondary growth, just mature forest with massive tropical hardwoods. We crossed many small jungle streams that are a fine source of good drinking water and great places to take a brief rest. At km 19 we spent the night in our hammocks, close to a clear fast running stream. Dozing off with the myriad sounds of the rainforest.\n\nThe third day is the most difficult and the most rewarding. From km 19 to the top of Victoria Peak at km 28. Here the trail becomes very difficult. We started the morning hike with a 40 minute climb up a 45+ degree incline. That got the heart pumping. Hanging on to roots to pull yourself up and sliding on your butt sometimes on the way down. But that was just the beginning. It took about 3-4 hours to reach the true base of Victoria Peak. During those hours it is rough hiking, especially with the burden of carrying heavy backpacks. But the forest is just incredibly beautiful and the wildlife prolific. Eduardo saw a Puma on the trail. All I saw was the tail end disappearing into the jungle. And we encountered many Jaguar markings on the trail.\nNear the summit of Victoria Peak\nMarcos on rope near summit.\nWe started climbing Victoria Peak up a dry creek bed that eventually turns into solid stone. Most of the way to the top was 60 degree or more incline up wet stone. Good foot holds but very slippery and potentially very dangerous. Because of the remote location and treacherous terrain, a fall here could be a real disaster.. At this point it is a good idea to have some basic climbing gear to help over the 'rough spots'. Marcos Cucul, my guide and friend is an accomplished climber. I am not. When the climbing became too difficult or too dangerous in my opinion, he would fix some ropes. The 'trail' continued straight up then eventually veered left and leveled out onto a very narrow path (2 feet) with a 700-800+ foot fall over the other side. Not good for those prone to vertigo. After several hundred feet the trail terminated next to a vertical rock face that had to be scaled. It was only 50 or 60 feet high and not a problem with good climbing equipment . From the top of the rock face we scrambled over another series of small steep inclines and rock faces. Here the forest changes dramatically. A very wet tropical forest environment dripping with moisture and moss. Then, tired and exhilarated, we finally reached the summit! The total time it took us from the camp at km 19 to the top was approx. 7 1\/2 hours of continuous hard hiking and climbing.\nCamping on Victoria Peak\nCamping on top of the summit.\n\nMost people or groups give up before reaching this point. I believe it is because alot of guides expect people to climb to the top, stay 15 minutes, then climb back down and make that difficult hike all the back to km 19. That's a 12-14 hour day and most expeditions find that there is not enough daylight to complete the hike before sunset, so they turn back. We did not have that concern because we camped on the summit. Probably the first expedition to do so. The primary advantage of making the summit in one day and returning to camp km 19 is that you don't have to carry much gear. Just water and some food. We, on the other hand had to carry all our camping gear up to the summit. But it was well worth the effort.\n\nIt cleared when we reached the top and the view was inspirational. The air was cool and crisp. A thick carpet of unbroken forest and mountain ranges stretched as far as the eye could see. But quickly it changed and the clouds moved in. The wind picked up along with a strong drizzle and the temperature dropped. We pitched our hammocks among the stunted growth of foliage and spent a somewhat sleepless night listening to the winds roar with a thick mist swirling around us.\n\nThe next day, day four, we were completely fogged in. No view, just a strong wind from the East. We started the climb back down Victoria Peak early in the morning.. I found the climb down much more intimidating than the ascent. We used the ropes to repel over the most dangerous areas and hiked back to km 19 in about 6 1\/2 hours. There is a wonderful jungle stream close by and a small waterfall that created the most exhilarating shower. A great place to wash away the days hike and get refreshed.\n\nThat evening our group sat around the camp fire sharing stories. Valentino told fascinating stories about the diverse wildlife he has encountered in the jungles of Belize. Marcos spoke about his various trekking and climbing adventures and his love of his Mayan ancestry. I mainly just listened, content to be in their company and remembering that one Maya man who first made the summit less than twenty years earlier. Marcos told me that less than 175 adventurers have climbed to the top of Victoria Peak since then. And unless you are very well prepared I can see why. We were well prepared.\n\nOn the Top of Victoria Peak\nValentino, Greg and Marcos on the top of Victoria Peak.\n\n\nMarcos Cucul\nFor more information about guided trips to Victoria Peak, contact Marcos Cucul at or Greg Harris at\nThe next morning, day five. We hiked from camp km 19 all the way back to the Cockscomb headquarters. Approx. 12 miles of steady hiking.. But we did stop often to observe the bird life. We saw a 'Bush Dog' dash across the trail. We smelled the strong odor of a peccary herd. We hiked in the pouring rain. We listened to Toucans sing in the trees and we saw a snake whip past. We slipped and fell on the wet trail. We were tired and wet and very happy campers when we arrived at Cockscomb headquarters as the sun slipped beneath the jungle canopy.\n\nAll photos provided by Greg Harris.

        "text":"Edit ModuleShow Tags\nEdit ModuleShow Tags\n\nRoyal Mandarin\n\nMiami is the Floridian's antidote for chronic life-in-the-slow-lane. That's why we go there-to jump start the lassitude that comes with the latitude, to reap all the benefits of an exotic foreign vacation without passports or luggage scans or those pesky full-body frisks. There's always something shaking in Baghdad-on-the-Biscayne, and the weekend we planned promised to be even more kinetic than usual.\n\nFor starters, there was the Miami International Boat Show, probably the largest display of dreamcraft on the planet-gazillion-dollar trawlers, tricked-out sportfishermen and flats boats galore, a real nautical droolfest. We'd spend the better part of a day just ogling all there was to ogle. Then we'd hop over to the Coconut Grove Arts Festival, which is the coolest such gathering certainly in all of Florida since they cut out the kitsch and decided to concentrate on stuff that is actually artsy. There's lots of good food (killer conch fritters) and lots of beer and lots of truly interesting people to look at (it helps that Miami has one of the highest percentages of underclad human beings in the universe.) Plus, I wanted to hit a couple of favorite Cuban joints on Calle Ocho, and I'd been promising my wife a stone-crab bacchanalia at Joe's, and there were all those hot South Beach clubs we could prowl after midnight if we were still numbered among the living. Yes, it was shaping up to be an action-packed three days.\n\nAt least that's what we were thinking as we wheeled our car over the little bridge that leads from the heart of downtown Miami to Brickell Cay and caught our first glimpse of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Every trip to Miami seems to bring some new architectural wonder-OK, an occasional glaring oddity thrown into the mix-and the hotel was a real grabber. It soared 20 stories above the bay, but it wasn't just a box of blocks meant to dazzle merely by its bigness. It gave a sense of sculpture.\n\n\"It looks like a fan,\" my wife said. \"A giant Chinese fan.\"\n\nIt was white and ochre, the color of a queen conch shell, and its gentle form seemed to mimic the curve of the shore. Yes, a giant Chinese fan, that's just what it looked like.\n\nWe pulled up to the entrance, handed the car keys to the valet, followed the bellman into the lobby and stopped dead in our tracks. It was closing in on sunset and, through the floor-to-ceiling atrium windows, the crazy Dow Jones graph that is the Miami skyline did more than just glow, it radiated. There was Brazilian marble everywhere and bamboo trees and tasteful artifacts placed in just the right places, along with the sound of falling water, surely some kind of masterful feng shui thing. It was Art Deco meets Steamy Latino meets Cool, Cool Zen. Over-the-top fusion, sure, but it worked.\n\nBut what really galvanized us was a long, low table in the middle of the lobby. Atop the table were dozens of tiny vases. And in each vase stood a single orchid stem. Far be it from me to get all goo-goo about it, but each orchid was like a tiny face.\n\n\"Oh, my,\" said my wife. She got this dreamy look in her eyes, a look that likely mirrored my own.\n\nAt that precise moment our plans went straight to hell. We were goners. Forget that on-the-town, burn-it-at-both-ends weekend. We didn't leave the hotel for three days.\n\nSince opening a little more than two years ago, the 329-room Mandarin Oriental Miami has secured its niche as the city's A-list outpost. Springsteen stayed here. Cher stayed here. J. Lo stayed here. Michael Jackson stayed here for an entire month (before all that weirdness with babies and balconies.) Pavarotti settled in at the top-of-the-heap Oriental Suite, a 2,365-square-foot aerie that comes with a multimedia screening room and its own grand piano. The well-fed tenor christened the suite's kitchen by cooking his favorite pasta and serving it in the formal dining room with seating for eight.\n\nWe bunked down in one of the Biscayne Suites, almost a thousand square feet of exquisitely livable space. The ceilings were high, the furnishings elegant, and bamboo hardwood covered the floors. There was a stand-alone tub-for-two in the bathroom and an enormous walk-in shower that could have fit the entire starting lineup of the Miami Dolphins with room for substitutes should anyone slip on the Spanish marble floor. It took me a few minutes to notice that the marble was speckled with golden, bamboo-like veining. Nice, cohesive touch.\n\nWalk into a suite like that and your \"ahhhhh\" is automatic. I plopped down on the bed and picked up the room-service menu.\n\n\"I think we'll be ordering in tonight,\" I called out to my wife.\n\nBut she didn't hear me. How could she? She was already in the bathtub and the water was running.\n\nWe kept meaning to leave the hotel, really we did. But things just kept conspiring against us. Among the most devious co-conspirators was the food. Miami is one of the best cities for eating in the entire world. There is absolutely no reason to eat all your meals at a hotel. But then most hotels don't have restaurants like Caf\u00e9 Sambul and Azul. The creation of acclaimed restaurant designer Tony Chi, the two restaurants share a separate, multi-leveled waterfront building with views of the bay and the city.\n\nCaf\u00e9 Sambul, casual and open all day, serves up fresh breads and good coffee and breakfasts of turkey hash with poached egg, Asian pesto and hollandaise sauce. For lunch there are Asian-inspired offerings like sugarcane roasted salmon with sticky rice, red snapper with almond fried rice and jumbo sea scallop kung pao. Azul, which was the first Miami restaurant to win the AAA Five Diamond rating, has garnered worldwide acclaim through its chef, Michelle Bernstein. A native of Miami, Bernstein studied dance and performed with the Joffrey Ballet before turning her talents to the kitchen. She's now a co-host of The Food Network's Melting Pot. It's an apropos title since Bernstein has followed the Mandarin Oriental's fusion theme by blending Latin flavors with Asian, Caribbean and classic French influences. Bernstein and her staff perform in a magnificent white marble, open kitchen, which encompasses a raw bar and a long wine table. Among the plats de resistance are grouper with Malaysian curry stewed vegetables, short ribs falling-off-the-bone with jalape\u00f1os and kumquats, and a signature Caribbean bouillabaisse with lime, chiles and cilantro.\n\nAnd then there's the spa. Really, it's more like a temple-three levels, 15,000 square feet with 17 private treatment rooms. My wife went in for an aromatherapy facial and I settled on a Thai massage.\n\nAfterward we lounged on the balcony outside our suite, draped in those terry-cloth robes that are such a temptation to steal. There was chardonnay and a nice p\u00e2t\u00e9 and the sun was sinking low again.\n\n\"You know, we really should get out and do something. Like go to the boat show,\" said my wife.\n\n\"Look, there's some boats, down there on the bay,\" I said.\n\nSo we sat there and watched them awhile.\n\n\"We could get in the car and drive to the art festival,\" I said.\n\n\"We could,\" said my wife.\n\nSo we napped awhile.\n\nLater, we talked about getting dressed and hitting the South Beach club scene. So we took a bath, a really long bath. And after that we ordered room service.\u00a0\n\nEdit ModuleShow Tags\n\nYou Might Like\n\nBags of Style\n\nDining Review: Figs Grille\n\nFlavors of the Mediterranean shine in delicious specialties from nearly every port-of-call.\n\nCaffe Milano: Light-Filled Space, Lite Lunch\n\nA change in ownership last season rethought the d\u00e9cor and menu at a Fifth Avenue space that\u2019s hosted rotating Italian restaurants for several years.\nEdit ModuleShow Tags\nEdit ModuleShow Tags Edit ModuleShow Tags\nEdit ModuleShow TagsEdit ModuleShow Tags\nEdit ModuleShow Tags",

        "text":"Housekeeping & Accessibility\n\nBy Arnold.Fewell\n\nSeptember 17, 2015\n\nHousekeepers can make a much better impression on disabled guests, say Arnold Fewell FIH and Christoph Hoffmann MIH\n\nMany people will think that the role of hotel housekeeping is to create a great first impression for hotel guests: a nice clean room, sparkling surfaces, a comfortable well-made bed, all the information and help you need available, plus a room layout that meets your needs. For guests with additional needs, such as a wheelchair user, ideally the room should have no carpet, must have suitable support such as grab rails in the bathroom and toilet and be set up with less furniture.\n\nUnfortunately, in reality hotels are not getting it right when it comes to catering for the accessible market. Housekeeping, which plays an important role when it comes to the service delivery to guests with additional needs, is usually misinformed, overstretched and underresourced.\n\nHowever, hotels might want to reconsider how they resource their customer service departments, including housekeeping, since the accessible tourism market is worth \u00a312 billion a year according to VisitEngland. So how can the housekeeping team make a difference when it comes to catering for guests with additional needs? First of all, the hotel should make the right facilities available to cater for the market, then the hotel team needs to identify the guest\u2019s requirements at the time of booking and pass these on to housekeeping team to execute. Ok, but how can housekeeping make a difference on a day-to-day basis?\n\nLet\u2019s take Arnold\u2019s latest hotel visit as an example and look at the possible final impression given to a disabled guest as they set off for breakfast, checkout or both:\n\n\u201cI had had a lovely stay, enjoyed a delicious dinner and just got up after a great night\u2019s sleep. I got in my wheelchair and set off towards reception. What did I see? The first thing that came into my mind was an obstacle course in the corridor made up of a housekeeping trolley, a vacuum cleaner with trailing wires, trays of dirty crockery, waste materials and dirty laundry. It was about 9am and so the time when housekeeping staff were just setting up or perhaps having a cup of coffee while waiting for rooms to become available for cleaning. This just made matters worse as I was now shouting for help as I was completely stuck, especially as I was travelling on my own. I couldn\u2019t get out of my wheelchair as I am an amputee, I couldn\u2019t get past, I needed help but there was nobody around. I was left to shout for help and hope someone heard me. This time, and on many occasions, that has been another guest. All that happens is that I get angry and upset and what was an enjoyable stay is turning into a nightmare that will be recounted to many others.\u201d\n\nThere are some fundamental changes that need to take place in order to get hotel teams to deliver the right service to the accessible market:\n\n  \u2022 Hotels need to get their product and service right. It is all about giving great customer service time and time again which is the aim of hoteliers for non-disabled people so why do disabled people miss out?\n  \u2022 Disabled people need more information such as accessibility statements on the hotel website.\n  \u2022 At least two team members in a 100 bedroom hotel should be given the responsibility for being an accessible champion. One needs to report to the senior management team and take on the responsibility for accessibility training and information to customers.\n  \u2022 Hotels need to provide high quality training on how to look after people with disabilities. This could be face to face training or online like Arnold\u2019s www.accesschamp.co.uk. The latter has many advantages because it is not taking any key personnel out of the business for a long period of time. This online tool also provides an e-learning programme for the Accessible Champions. The training then needs to be cascaded through the hotel and this should be in the form of short coffee time chats that start by looking at the three main areas of disability which are mobility, sight and hearing.\n  \u2022 Time for training needs to be built into the delivery model for each department. In the case of housekeeping, decision-makers need to take stock and identify how much ROI they will get by training the room attendants on service delivery, rather than pushing for another room to clean per shift.\n\nIn the end, it is all about awareness and communication. Arnold\u2019s nightmare experience highlighted above, could have been prevented if the information that a wheelchair user was staying in a particular room had been passed from reception to housekeeping and then onto the floor staff. The trolley and other items could have been positioned away from the room concerned.\n\nThis is just one example of many simple steps that can be undertaken in all departments to improve customer service to people with disabilities.\n\nArnold Fewell FIH is managing director of AVF Marketing and AccessChamp\nChristoph Hoffmann MIH is quality assurance and health & safety director, Omni Facilities Management, and founder of hsk-knowledge.com",

        "text":"Thanks! You're all signed up.\n\n\nNorwegian Cruise Lines Reaches Out to Single Travelers\n\n\nAt least one big cruise line has decided to court the solo travel market. Norwegian Cruise Line\u2019s new Norwegian Epic has 128 \u201cEpic Studios\u201d designed for single occupancy. Although a few other big cruise ships have a few single cabins, the Norwegian Epic is the first megaship I know of where the single cabins represent a serious effort to target the solo traveler market, not just an afterthought.\n\nThose studios are unlike anything else in the major-line cruise inventory. At 100 square feet they\u2019re smaller than even the typical river cruise cabins. In fact, they\u2019re about the same size as the rooms in Formule 1 and other low-end French motel chains, although each does have a separate shower, sink, and toilet. Cabins provide a full-size bed, flat-screen TV, and small desk. All studios are inside, and some have connecting doors to others. For more personal space, studio occupants have access to a dedicated two-story \u201cstudio lounge\u201d where you can mingle with other singles or get a cup of morning coffee or an evening drink.\n\nThe layout represents an ingenious use of shipboard space. Cabins are on decks 11 and 12, with the lounge near midship. All studio cabins are located on either side of a central corridor, on the center of the ship, and between rows of conventional inside cabins on either side. Only studio passengers use the central corridor. The advantage is a certain level of privacy and separation of studio occupants from the other 4,000 or so cruisers; the downside is that occupants of the far fore and fore aft studios have a long schlep to the lounge. Following a transatlantic cruise in late June, Norwegian Epic will operate seven- and 14-night Eastern and Western Caribbean cruises from Miami.\n\nPricing seems attractive to solo travelers. For summer seven-day cruises, studio cabins generally go for $150 to $200 more than the least expensive per-person rate for an inside cabin. Where the inside cabins start at $649 per person, the studios start at $799; when the inside cabins start at $799 per person, the studios start at $999. Those prices are the equivalent of a single supplement of 23 percent to 25 percent, a better deal than the 50 percent to 100 percent supplement most mass market cruise lines charge for single occupancy of a double cabin. Norwegian\u2019s studio cabins represent the best offering I\u2019ve seen for travelers who really want to cruise solo.\n\nOf course, you have alternatives.\n\n  \u2022 Some other big-ship cruise line ships have at least a few cabins designed for single occupancy. Check with any of the big online cruise agencies for possibilities.\n  \u2022 Carnival has a reputation for low single supplements. Several postings on the Website Cruise Critic report promotional single supplements that are often very low. And the high-end cruise lines generally charge small supplements\u2014or even none\u2014although even the no-supplement rates on these ships are far higher than you\u2019d have to pay on a mass-market line. And some small-ship \u201cniche\u201d cruise line ships have single cabins.\n  \u2022 If you\u2019re willing to share, many cruise lines or cruise agencies will match you with another single of the same sex, so you pay only the per-person rate. A few actually \u201cguarantee\u201d a match: If they can\u2019t find a match, you still get the per-person rate. Or if you prefer, you can arrange your own match through one of several travel-matching organizations. But many singles I know really don\u2019t want to share cabin accommodations with anyone, and the studio cabins represent an attractive option.\n  \u2022 If you\u2019re willing to gamble on finding what you want, you can also wait until a month or so before you want to leave to check last-minute deals. I\u2019ve often seen \u201cno single supplement\u201d or \u201creduced single supplement\u201d deals on last-minute promotions. And I sometimes see per-person rates cut so much that even with a 50 percent supplement, single occupancy is a great deal.\n\nDespite these options, many solo travelers will welcome Norwegian\u2019s new approach. If you\u2019re interested, contact Norwegian, or one of the big online agencies.\n\nWhat do you think of Norwegian\u2019s new studios designed for single occupancy? Would you ever consider cruising in one, or would you like to see more cruise lines adopting this strategy?

        "text":"Welcome warmer weather! After a long, cold winter, just about everyone I know is hankering to get out and about. If you're yearning for a change of scenery, Lambertville, New Jersey, located on the banks of the Delaware River, is perfect for a weekend get-away.\n\nIn addition to being known as one of the smallest cities in the United States, Lambertville was recognized in 2013 by Forbes magazine as one of the \"15 prettiest town in America\" and in 2014 ranked number five among the \"quirkiest\" by Travel & Leisure.\n\nLambertville is a walkable little town, just like New Hope, a popular destination across the bridge in Pennsylvania, but the vibe is a bit different \u2014 more relaxed, quieter and more conducive to a lazy stroll.\n\nMelanie Tucker of \"Rare Finds Travel\" lives in Lambertville and said she was drawn to the area for its diverse mix of residents. \"Residents range from blue-collar workers to artisans and professors,\" said Tucker. One of the first things she recommends is for visitors sign up for the free walking tours conducted by Lambertville Historical Society on the first Sunday of the month from April through November.\n\n\"On the tour, visitors will see things like the Cowin stone mansion, built by the mayor of Lambertville and the owner of Stoneworks, who engaged Italian stone makers to hand cut each stone on site. They will also learn that another homeowner owned a spoke factory and he became wealthy due to the Civil War. Lambertville provided many of the spokes that were affixed to the caissons that carried the cannons for the Union Army,\" said Tucker.\n\nGalleries galore\n\nFamous for an artist colony formed there more than a 100 years ago, Lambertville is known for its selection of art and is home to a plethora of galleries. You can spend hours admiring the many works of art in galleries dotted along the streets of the town. From small galleries like The River Queen on Church Street, to mega-galleries like \"Jim's of Lambertville\" on Bridge Street, there's something for every taste.\n\nBe sure not to miss A Mano Galleries on North Union Street. Located in an old \"5 & Dime\" building, the gallery can be mistaken for such. Step inside the dime store doors and you'll find an upscale array of one-of-a-kind, colorfully painted art furniture known as \"Sticks,\" along with a selection of artisan jewelry, lighting, handbags, paintings, sculptures and more.\n\nOvernight lodging\n\nIf staying in a hotel rich in history, known for its hospitality and located in the heart of the action is attractive to you, then the Lambertville House Hotel is an excellent choice. Built by Captain John Lambert in 1812, the hotel originally operated as Lambert's Inn, a stagecoach stop that provided lodging to U.S. presidents including Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant, dignitaries and business leaders traveling the main thoroughfare from New York to Philadelphia.\n\nDescribed by many as luxurious and comfortable, the historic haven has been awarded the AAA Award of Excellence for the past 14 years. Each room contains a fireplace, robes and jetted tubs. Relaxing on the spacious front porch to watch the world go by is a favorite pastime of guests.\n\nAn antiques enclave\n\nFor those who have a passion for antiques, Lambertville does not disappoint. The People's Store is located on Union Street in a building that dates back to 1839. There you'll find four floors of antiques from the collections of 45 dealers in an eclectic array of furnishings, art, period clothing, jewelry, silver and more.\n\nDining to your taste\n\nFinding a place to eat in Lambertville is easy. Choosing one \u2014 not so much. A good suggestion to begin your day is Rojo's Roastery, especially if you appreciate a great cup of coffee made from sustainably grown beans and roasted in state-of-the-art equipment. If coffee isn't your thing, you can order chai, or even herbal tea. Grab your libation of choice and sink down into a comfy couch to start the day off right.\n\nFor lunch, Lambertville Station is a good choice. There you can order anything from snapper soup to sandwiches, wraps, salads and even duck pot pie and jambalaya\n\nIf you're more of the \"grab and go\" type, visit DiNapoli's on Kline's Court for a choice of sandwiches from Italian hoagies, to meatball subs and their signature Italian Roast Pork.\n\nCraving a sweet afterwards? Pick from among an assortment of artisan truffles, handmade toffee and exotic chocolate bars at the Chocolate Box on North Union.\n\nFor dinner, Anton's at the Swan is top on my list. Chef Chris Connors is an expert in the kitchen and changes his menu with the seasons. He'll impress you with fish, beef, pork or chicken. My filet was top notch and sides like garlic potato gratin were delicious. It's a great place for a date, with a romantic, low-lit, elegantly appointed dining room and attentive service.\n\nThere's so much more to see and do in Lambertville. For a short, entertaining, laid-back getaway, this pretty, quirky, small town certainly fits the bill.\n\nRead or Share this story:",

Golden, British Columbia, used to draw only the most extreme purists \u2013 they\u2019d ride the lift to the top and start hiking from there.

So go ahead, ride the gondola to the peak: Take in the 360-degree views, and pick your own way down through 2,600 acres of fine powder. You won\u2019t find many people along the way \u2013 the resort\u2019s remote enough to be a bit of a secret \u2013 or much going on at the bottom of the hill. Situated on the eastern edge of British Columbia, Kicking Horse is closer in climate and character to Banff than to Blackcomb \u2013 a night out\u2019s more likely to involve tossing back a couple of Kokanees at a bar full of locals than hitting a pajama party in the condo next door.

        "text":"An American in Paris: Notes on a Parisian street\n\nNJ Voices Guest Blogger\/For By NJ Voices Guest Blogger\/For The Star-Ledger\non May 24, 2009 at 5:24 AM, updated March 30, 2010 at 3:47 PM\nA street in Paris, with the Eiffel Tower in the distance.\n\nWalking around the cobblestone streets of the Marais in Paris earlier this month, I couldn't help but think of a conglomeration of neighborhoods in Manhattan, where I grew up: The orthodox Jews in black hats brought to mind the old Lower East Side; the ribald gay shops were a touch of Christopher Street, circa 1977; and the chic boutiques that attracted young shoppers reminded me of Soho today.\n\nWhat made the spectacle remarkable was that all of these activities were contained in a few blocks of one Parisian neighborhood, the Marais. Late at night, one could see people young and old ambling along the cobblestone streets -- on the way to clubs or synagogue, to sit in a cafe or walk with a cheap falafel meal in hand.\n\nThe writer Jane Jacobs, in her 1961 classic \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities,\" wrote about the importance of diversity or mixed uses in neighborhoods. Stores and homes and jobs and parks, museums and delis, historic buildings reimagined for modern use -- all feed a dynamic street life, drawing in residents and tourists. Those lessons come vividly to life in the winding back streets of the Marais.\n\nThe neighborhood, which runs into the city's 3rd and 4th arrondissements, is home to many glorious and well-trod tourist sites, including the stately Place de Vosges, the Musee Carnavalet, devoted to the history of the city of Paris, and Musee Picasso, which was established with works the artist left to the country after his death. But the streets that caught my eye were off-kilter -- filled with cafes, small theaters, parks and comedy clubs.\n\nTaking it all in, a visitor can ponder those things that make a city street work beautifully, and come up with a checklist of lessons that apply beyond the boundaries of great cities like Paris or New York.\n\nIn addition to the famous cafes (which can be famously expensive) there were cheap falafel stands competing on the Rue de Rosiers, and many people walked and ate their baguettes, filled with jambon and fromage, purchased at one of the many boulangeries. You could order a house wine and know it would be cheap and very, very good. Different price-points for visitors and residents: Check.\n\nThe ambience was one of tolerance and openness. Same-sex couples walked arm-in-arm and displayed affection without fear. There was a pervasive sense of safety on the streets, without a heavy police presence. It wasn't uncommon to see an elderly man or woman walking a dog on a deserted street late at night, or to see a young woman strolling with a suitcase at the same hour. Feeling safe and secure: Check.\n\nOne of the impressive things we learned in the Marais had to do with something that wasn't genuine at all.\n\nThe apartment my husband and I stayed in looked old -- uneven wood stairs, cracked linoleum and walls that seemed papered to hide antiquity -- but we later found out the apartment house was built in 1985. Planners took care to keep the building consistent with other structures on the street, instead of squeezing apartments and people into it to maximize profits. Respect for the harmonizing profile of a street: Check.\n\nIt's easy for a city to celebrate its glorious history. In the Marais and elsewhere in Paris, we constantly found plaques commemorating not just where brave Freedom Fighters were arrested during the Occupation of World War II, but also where French collaborators had rounded up Jewish families and children, who were sent to death camps. A truthful history, however painful, told straightforwardly: Check.\n\nA small park, surrounded by sculpture rescued from ancient buildings, is a place for nearby workers to eat lunch. And the stores are not selling tourist trinkets, but products that a middle class would find desirable: stylish clothing, handmade books, antique and vintage treasures. As always, the presence of a middle class is a fulcrum around which other communities may rise and fall away, without harming something essential about the place. A stable middle class that lives and shops in the neighborhood: Check.\n\nIt would be easy to say, well, that's Paris, for heaven's sake. To be sure, the city of lights has its own urban problems. The Metro is rife with graffiti, scratched on the glass, just like New York City, and the tunnels feature the florid balloon-lettered tags that reminded me of N.Y.C. in the bad old days of the 1970s. A short Metro ride away and I was whisked to a neighborhood that felt like a weedy, uninspired residential part of Queens I know too well. Warnings about pickpockets abound.\n\nBut in the Marais, there was a sense of -- to use a political term -- a big tent.\n\nJane Jacobs, as she did so well, got down to it best: \"Without a strong and inclusive (Jacobs' emphasis) central heart, a city tends to become a collection of interests isolated from one another. It falters at producing something greater, socially, culturally and economically, that the sum of its separated parts.\"\n\nFor me, that inclusive heart was the great find on the streets of the Marais. That, and a great baguette.\n\nLinda Ocasio is a member of The Star-Ledger editorial board.",

        "text":"Why Vegas?\n\nWe don't devote the magazine to a single topic very often.\n\nWe once covered London comprehensively; that made sense, because it is a man's town. But why Vegas? It's pretty simple: if you are a cigar lover, a food lover, a golf lover, a gambling lover, a good-life lover, and you haven't been to Vegas, something's wrong.\n\nAnd don't say, \"Oh, I was there years ago, and I'm never going back.\" Forget that. Las Vegas has transformed itself, yet again, into one of the most exciting adult playgrounds in the world. It's not just about gambling anymore, although you can still do that to your heart's content 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But there was a time when that's all you could do in Vegas.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nIt's easy to argue, for instance, that Vegas may have more talented chefs cooking in great restaurants in a smaller area than any other city on Earth. Daniel Boulud of New York's Daniel opened his doors at Wynn. Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, one of France's greatest three-star chefs, has recently begun cooking at MGM. Paul Bartolotta, Michael Mina, Charlie Palmer and Alex Stratta all have great restaurants there. On our last visit to Vegas, we had two of the best meals we've ever tasted, at Robuchon and Bartolotta.\n\nYou can also walk the fairways of some of the finest modern golf course designers working today. Shadow Creek, a Tom Fazio design, has frequently been cited as a Top 10 course in the country. Fazio's new Wynn Resort course is a challenging and spectacular creation. Reflection Bay is one of Jack Nicklaus's best designs. Southern Highlands is a collaborative masterpiece between Robert Trent Jones senior and junior. And that's even before you mention Cascata, which is touted as one of Rees Jones's best designs ever and perhaps the best course within a hundred miles of the city.\n\nThere are almost no words to adequately describe the hotels and casinos in Las Vegas either. As some of the largest lodgings in the world, the luxury and quality built into the best ones is astounding. Walk through the lobby of the Bellagio; you can't help but appreciate the marble and the aesthetic marvels. Or check out The Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes, or the hotel's large suites that it offers as standard rooms. And Wynn epitomizes what can be done at the crossroads of sumptuous luxury and modern amenities.\n\nUp for all-night dancing? The newest fad in Vegas are the mega-clubs, places where you go to be seen, along with two or three thousand other people. When you walk up to the front door of Pure, there are easily 500 people waiting in line to get in.\n\nBut the biggest evolution today in Las Vegas is the advent of dozens of high-priced condominium developments, many aimed at retiring baby boomers looking for a second home. Like their hotel counterparts, the condos are luxurious, and many share the same views of the Strip.\n\nIn short, we've devoted an entire issue to Las Vegas because it is one of the most fascinating cities in the world. Whether you already love it, or you profess to hate it, we recommend a visit in the near future. You could try out the Wine Spectator's Grand Tour event there in April, or come to the Las Vegas Big Smoke in November. For more details, check out www.winespectator.com or www.cigaraficionado.com. We hope to see you there.\n\nRatings & Reviews\n\nSearch our database of more than 17,000 cigar tasting notes by score, brand, country, size, price range, year, wrapper and more, plus add your favorites to your Personal Humidor.",

        "text":"An insider's guide to Newcastle\n\nView larger map\nNo image\n\nBy Andrew McFetrich, a Travel Enthusiast\n\nRead more on Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nOverall rating:3.0\u00a0out of 5 (based on 1 vote)\nRecommended for:\nBeach, Food and Drink, Short Break, Budget, Expensive, Mid-range\n\nNewcastle has a reputation as a party town, but there's much more to it than that, with lush green spaces to explore, glorious food to eat and the bracing North Sea to surf\n\nIf you arrive in Newcastle by train, then your first view of \u2018the toon\u2019 will be special. As the train shuffles over one of the seven bridges that span the river, you will be able to catch a glimpse of the impressive Baltic flour mill and the Sage Opera House (home of the Northern Sinfonia Orchestra), both sat snugly next to the glittering Tyne. Walking through the John Dobson-designed 19th-century train station, you can use the underground system (the only one in England outside London) to head directly to the coast, to Sunderland, or to one of the more laidback and fashionable suburbs.\n\nJesmond, only 10 minutes' metro ride from the station, is an intriguing blend of laidback coffee shops, upbeat bars and boutique shops. The main thoroughfare, Osbourne Road, contains enough bars to keep Oliver Reed happy, but there are some real treats to be had if you know where to look.\n\nFor the best sandwiches north of Sheffield, try Nipoti on Brentwood Avenue. Run by an Italian chap and his Geordie wife, it serves genuine Italian sausage, a mouthwatering range of salami and cold meats, and the meanest espresso macchiato outside Italy. The home-made pizzas, at \u00a31.50 for a large slice, cannot be beaten on taste or value for money. A few doors down is the \u2018only butcher in Jesmond\u2019, Stewart & Co. When the northeastern weather allows (more often than you think!), you can enjoy a green tea and pizziola on the outside tables, but be prepared to wait: the service can be slower than you may wish for.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nBecause of licensing laws, every bar on Osbourne Road is also a hotel. Whites Hotel, above Bar Blanc at the south end of the street, has 38 ensuite rooms starting at just \u00a339 for a single and \u00a359 for a double. The front of the hotel overlooks the bars, so a room at the back is advised if you\u2019ll not be out after the sun sets.\n\nA little further away is The Townhouse Hotel. A Victorian townhouse that was renovated in 2008, it offers 10 luxury ensuite rooms, starting at only \u00a379 per night. All the rooms were decorated by Sheila and Cathy, the current owners, and revolve around enticing chocolate browns and smooth greys. Exquisite bathrooms with flat screens and huge bath tubs help you recover after a hard day.\n\nIf you want decadent luxury, Jesmond Dene House offers 40 beautifully designed rooms (starting at \u00a3175 for a double) in a sensational Grade II-listed Georgian building that was built by the mayor of Newcastle and bought by a local industrialist. Previous guests include Rudyard Kipling, Lord Baden-Powell and numerous foreign dignitaries. Once a month they run a legendary jazz night; booking a room on one of these nights entitles you to a room, supper, world-class jazz and breakfast in the morning for only \u00a3225.\n\nWhere to play\n\nTo relax, there is no finer green space in Newcastle than Jesmond Dene itself, designed to offer a rural setting in the heart of the city. There are waterfalls, lakes, crags and pools to explore, as well as the craft fair situated on Armstrong Bridge every Sunday. A petting zoo provides great entertainment for kids.\n\nThe Ouse Burn runs through the Dene all the way down to the Tyne; following the path of the river down will bring you to the cultural quarter. Next to the Cluny pub - which serves an amazing home-made burger (\u00a35) that will definitely keep you going until tea - lies Seven Stories, a great interactive children's bookstore\/museum that will keep kids entertained.\n\nNewcastle has several excellent restaurants that cater for all tastes and budgets. At the inexpensive end, The Gospoda in Princess Square offers authentic Polish cuisine. When I say inexpensive, I really mean it: less than \u00a36 for a main course like the Hunter's Stew is amazing value, but the Brigand\u2019s Pancake, a crunchy potato pancake served with goulash, takes some beating at \u00a35.30.\n\nAdriano\u2019s, on the high street in Gosforth, just a mile from Jesmond, is an Italian restaurant with a great wine list. Mains are between \u00a37 and \u00a320. The roast suckling pig, which was added to the menu after impressing as a special, is definitely worth trying.\n\nFor a restaurant with views as good as its food, Six Baltic is, as the name suggests, on the sixth floor of the converted Baltic flour mill on the south bank of the Tyne. The sea bass with crayfish risotto and asparagus is a stunning dish, but try to leave enough space for the Pimm's jelly knickerbocker glory.\n\nIf you need to burn off the inevitable calorific overload, surfing at Longsands beach in Tynemouth will leave a lasting impression. Rubber Soul has friendly, patient tutors catering for those who have never surfed before and those who need a quick refresher; Tynemouth Surf Co is based on the cliff overlooking the breaks; and Rise boasts a British big-wave surfing legend (Jesse Davies) as a tutor and charges \u00a350 for two lessons or \u00a390 for four.\n\nSave money on booking\n\nflightshotelscar hire\n\nby following our money-saving guides.
