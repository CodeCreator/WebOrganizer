        "text":"Closer to the Sun\n\nYou thought the peak of Everest was Earth\u2019s highest point? Think again. Damian Hall climbs to the heavens on the dormant Ecuadoran volcano Chimborazo.\n\nF orget Everest. The glacier-covered summit of Ecuador\u2019s Volc\u00e1n Chimborazo is the highest point on Earth.\n\nThe sleeping volcano may be 6310 metres above sea level to Everest\u2019s 8848 metres, but, because of our planet\u2019s equatorial bulge, the Andean peak is actually nearer to the sun than its more illustrious Himalayan rival \u2014 and any other mountain in the world.\n\nIs Chimborazo harder to climb than Everest? Well, no. But for me, climbing Chimborazo was the most exhausting experience of my 35 years of life. Its name is still a swear word to me and it also sent me genuinely loopy for a bit.\n\nSky high\n\nWhen I arrived in Riobamba, the capital of Chimborazo province in central Ecuador, I went to a local guiding company to arrange the climb and hire equipment. I was told I should acclimatise for three days, but I wouldn\u2019t be there long enough. Altitude sickness, which can be lethal, is a real risk anywhere above 4000m. In Riobamba, which is at 2754m, the air already felt thin and elusive. But some people adapt to altitude faster than others and I just had to hope I was one of those lucky ones. I was advised to eat pasta and drink lots of coca-leaf tea to combat any sickness. The plant is used to produce cocaine, though it\u2019s not nearly as exciting to drink as that makes it sound.\n\nAt the appointed time I met up with my fellow climber, Pierre, a Frenchman about my age, and our guide, Juan, who looked exactly like a girl I used to work with but with thighs that would make Cadell Evans feel inadequate. I asked him how many of his clients get to the top of Chimborazo. \u201cAbout half,\u201d said Juan, avoiding eye contact.\n\nAfter an hour\u2019s drive and an hour\u2019s upward walk through scree and loose boulders, we were at the refugio, a wooden hut that marks the point where the serious climbing starts. This is at 5000m, so we had another 1310m to go.\n\nThe plan was to climb at midnight, when the snow is firmest and safest. We waited out the afternoon and evening with card games, chat and short walks in the snow with the other climbers in the refugio. Sleep was impossible at this altitude.\n\nWith balaclavas and headlamps on, Juan, Pierre and I left the hut at 11.30pm. The temperature was -10\u00b0C and Juan had made it clear that we had to make fast progress or we\u2019d turn back. I developed a light headache that got rapidly worse and, when we stopped to attach crampons, I alerted Juan as instructed. He gave me an aspirin and the pain subsided.\n\nUp, up and a break\n\nIt was relentlessly steep. Every step involved bringing a knee up beyond a right angle, often near to my chest. After about two hours of climbing in the dark, an exhausted Pierre called out for a break. The only reason I hadn\u2019t done so was because I didn\u2019t want to be the first to show weakness. I was shattered. My thighs were burning white-hot. I\u2019d thought I was in good shape. I\u2019d walked from coast to coast in England a few weeks earlier. But it was soon my turn to call out for a rest. Breathing was a battle. I had saved my iPod for when I started hurting and now seemed a good time for the Rocky soundtrack. But my flaky iPod died on the spot, killed by the cold.\n\nAt around 6am it was suddenly light, as if someone had lifted the blinds. Snow-topped peaks were all around us, if mostly below, and I felt like a figurine atop an iced cake. The views gave me a much-needed boost, until I reached for my water bottle for a celebratory swig and found it had gone AWOL.\n\nAs our calls for rests became more frequent, Juan grew more impatient. He knew our window of opportunity was closing. Soon the volcano would be unsafe. I was beginning to realise we might not make it.\n\n\u201cAre we at 6000m yet?\u201d Pierre asked. It was almost exactly where we were. \u201cThat\u2019s it, I can\u2019t go on,\u201d he said. I was surprised \u2014 surprised that it wasn\u2019t me who had failed the test. And secretly pleased that it was over. But Juan had other ideas.\n\nWish Listo\n\nJuan spotted another guide just in front of us, who he knew. Juan called out, they exchanged some Spanish and he said, \u201cDamian, you can go with them.\u201d Well yes, I could\u2026 but even though I found myself fantasising about a taking a blissful bath back in Riobamba, I knew I had to go on. There was only 300m left to climb. I scrambled to catch up the other group, then roped myself up to the guide\u2019s American client.\n\nMy new guide, David, asked, \u201cListo?\u201d \u2014 \u201cReady?\u201d It was a word I would hate by the end of the climb.\n\nFrom here on my memory is vague and dreamy. As the sun beat down, there seemed to be just one colour all around, a kind of hazy, ethereal white. We climbed up and up, sometimes dragged on the rope by David. At some point it got flatter and I\u2019m pretty certain we made the summit at around 7.30am.\n\nBut like some kind of monster from Greek mythology, Chimborazo has multiple heads. I don\u2019t remember agreeing to climb to a second, higher, summit, but we headed towards it.\n\nHalf an hour later, I flopped to the floor at the highest summit. The views were sensational \u2014 I think.\n\nI felt limp and mangled but contented, a bit like someone who\u2019s just finished a marathon. However, I was only halfway through this marathon. Around 80 percent of mountaineering accidents happen on the way down the mountain and I was running on empty.\n\nDown time\n\nThe descent was harder. The hot sun, no water to drink, the increasingly dangerous slushy snow and a guide intent on hurrying us along. Most of the time I let the rope pull me along.\n\nI remember expecting my legs to simply give up and refuse to move, and I wanted to lie down in the soft snow and go to sleep.\n\nThe American was as white-faced as I imagine I was. Occasionally, I\u2019d offer him some encouraging inanity, but I couldn\u2019t understand his replies. Every half hour or so, or maybe every couple of minutes, I either called for a \u201cmomentito\u201d (a small moment) or just plonked myself down on the snow like a petulant teenager. After just 10 or 20 seconds David would say \u201cListo?\u201d more as a command than a question, and we\u2019d be off again.\n\nAt one point David himself stopped. A rest? No such luck. Helmets on, he instructed, we had to run. As I stumbled along as fast as I could, rocks the size of laptops bounced and whizzed past me.\n\nI finally understood the haste. The volcano was warming up and, as it did, so it shook itself. That\u2019s what was sending killer rocks spraying out.\n\nIt got even weirder after that. Once, I blacked out while walking and woke up on my knees. Another time, I awoke sliding. I put more snow under my hat and down my back, to try to stay awake. I remember laughing out loud to myself at one point. And hallucinating. I was sure some of my friends were having a picnic on a nearby mound.\n\nTenth heaven\n\nI finally stumbled into the refugio about 13 hours after we\u2019d left it. After a long drink, I discovered that of the six groups to attempt the second summit that morning, we were one of only two to make it. The guiding company later told me that only about 10 percent of their clients get to the very top.\n\nWhen I fell into bed back in Riobamba I\u2019d been awake for about 40 hours. But with adrenaline racing around me like a Scalextric car, I couldn\u2019t sleep for another two hours.\n\nIt took me a few days to realise the guide, David, whose name I\u2019d been cursing, was heroic. His refusal to allow me to rest for too long possibly saved my life. And I was too tired to remember to tip him. Perhaps I\u2019ll go back and do it again, so I can give him a few dollars. Or perhaps not.\n\n\n\nWhen to go\n\nGenerally, climbing and trekking in the Andes is best in the drier months between May and September. However, Chimborazo is accessible for most of the year \u2014 December to January is a good time.\n\nGetting there\n\nFly from Sydney or Melbourne to Santiagio for between $2100 and $2500 return, then get a flight to Quito and a bus to Riobamba.\n\nGetting around\n\nBuses are very cheap, regular and the network is comprehensive, although some of the journeys can seem as dangerous as climbing a bloody volcano.\n\nGuide book\n\nThere are plenty of books, but the most popular among climbers seems to be Ecuador: The Bradt Climbing And Hiking Guide by Rob Rachowiecki and Mark Thurber.\n\nClimbing guide\n\nLots to choose between, including Andes Adventures (, Gulliver Travel (, RainForestur ( and Julio Verne Travel ( Expect to pay around $180-$210, which covers food, transport and kit (including boots, crampons and ice axe). And don\u2019t forget to tip your guide generously.\n\n\nEcuador\u2019s official currency has been US dollars since 2000. A budget hotel costs around $8 a night.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll get by OK in tourist regions with a Spanish phrasebook. If you really can\u2019t manage a word of the Spanish language, make sure you get an English-speaking mountain guide.\n\n\nIf you have a valid Australian passport, they\u2019re granted on arrival.\n\nFor more on ecuador, visit\n\n\n\nGive these alternative South American adventures a go.\n\n1. Lost City Trek \u2014 Colombia\n\nBilled as Colombia\u2019s Inca Trail, this six-day trek takes you through the Colombian jungle to ancient Indian ruins. It\u2019s not as spectacular as Peru\u2019s version (see below) but not as busy either. If you like a frisson of danger while on your adventure, this trek goes past a cocaine factory.\n\n2. Amazon River \u2014 Brazil, Peru and Colombia\n\nVarious adventure nuts have used the world\u2019s second-longest river for extreme escapades. People have walked the length of it, and paddled it in a kayak and raft. In 2007, Martin Strel, a 52-year-old Slovenian, swam its entire length while drinking two bottles of wine a day. You\u2019ll probably want to stick to rafting.\n\n3. Inca Treks \u2014 Peru\n\nPeru\u2019s famous Inca Trail, a four-day walk through the Andes to the mountain kingdom of Machu Picchu, is brilliant but busy. There are several excellent alternative treks, some of which still involve Machu Picchu, that offer amazing Andean scenery.\n... (truncated)",

The trick is to rent a house or apartment. Generally known as \"gites,\" vacation rentals are a time-honored tradition throughout France and, thanks to the Internet, easier than ever to access.\n\nI learned the hard way about the advantages of renting. As a frequent Paris visitor, I prided myself on being an aficionado of that city's many small, special and relatively inexpensive hotels.\n\nOn a flight from Boston, I told my seatmate how skillfully I had patched together a 10-day family reunion using several Parisian hotels. He described the apartment rental he was sharing with a few other students.\n\nThe enormity of my blunder sank in a few weeks later when we exchanged e-mails, comparing notes. His apartment with its splendid roof deck cost a fraction of what we paid for the hotels. Then there were the tabs for all the cafes where my family gathered because our hotel rooms were too small, and all the restaurants in which we dined because we did not have a kitchen to cook our own meals.\n\nFor last year's family trip, I tried an entirely new approach. At Charles de Gaulle Airport we boarded the fast TGV train south, snoozing the two hours until our stop at Angouleme, a small walled city known for its 12th century cathedral, a colorful public 19th century market and an elaborate museum devoted to \"la Bande dessinee\" (the comic strip).\n\nIn rural France, businesses still close for a two-hour lunch. Luckily, there's a good restaurant in Angouleme's train station. We arrived at 12:03, and the Eurocar rental office was already on its lunch break. Eventually three of us squeezed into a tiny, two-door, stick-shift Renault and drove 20 miles south, through increasingly lush countryside.\n\nAngouleme is the capital of The Charente, an area of small villages and rural, rolling farm country north of Bordeaux and bordering the better- known Dordogne.\n\nThe small, picturesque farms are no longer profitable and antiquated old farmhouses are being sold off, snapped up as bargains by Brits, given the favorable exchange rate of the pound vs. euro.\n\n\"La Vieille Forge,\" the farmhouse apartment we found on a British Web site, featured a big old hearth in the living room and included a fully equipped country kitchen\/dining area and two baths (one with washing machine) and two upstairs bedrooms, all for about $478 per week.\n\n\"It's Coo-Coo mating season\" our British host, Diana Conheeney, explained cheerfully as we arrived at a farmyard filled with the fragrance of roses and the calls of Coo-Coo Birds. Diana and her husband, David Conheeney, are enthusiastic converts to The Charente, familiar with the weekly schedule of farmers' markets in surrounding towns as well as the hours of the local golf and tennis club, now owned by British expats named Peacock.\n\nGiven all the small questions that inevitably come with rural rentals (\"Do you have matches?\" \"An iron?\"), it was a plus to have English-speaking landlords. I had ample opportunity to use my fractured French in the local supermarket nearby and at the farmers' market beside the Byzantine cathedral in Perigueux, capital of the Dordogne and an easy drive. We feasted on fabulous and reasonably priced breads, cheeses and wine, on strawberries and asparagus.\n\nDay by day we explored the farm paths that began at our door. Our challenge was to find our way to l'Abbaye Ste. Marie de Maumont, a nearby monastery with magnificent Gregorian chant. The neighboring farmer claimed that he had driven oxen along these paths right to the monastery. We rented bikes from our hosts but got bogged down wheeling them through cornfields, happily lost.\n\nAs our stick-shift skills driving the Renault increased, we ventured farther along narrow, curvy roads. The local sight-to-see was Aubterre-sur-Dronne, a truly beautiful medieval village clinging to a steep hillside above a sandy beach on the River Dronne. Its big attraction is a spooky 12th century monolithic church, a high-domed but dark cathedral-sized cave, with tombs dating to the sixth century.\n\nWe walked the narrow streets of the Dordogne village of Sarlat, sampling its foie gras, and climbed the steep Pilgrim's Staircase in Rocamadour, where carless streets are lined with 12th to 15th century buildings and capped by a turreted castle.\n\nBut as glorious as the Dordogne was, it was a relief to return to the less-touristy Charente, and to our farmhouse apartment - which progressively felt like our French home away from home.\n\nRenting in Paris\n\n\"The apartment wasn't just a bargain, it was a big part of the way we experienced Paris\" enthused Melrose, Mass., resident Richard Appleyard.\n\nAgreed wife, Betty Appleyard, \"We felt like we belonged. The woman in the patisserie knew just what we would order when we walked in the door.\"\n\nAlthough widely traveled, the Appleyards had not been to France until Richard presented Betty with roundtrip tickets, a surprise retirement present.\n\nFriends advised the couple to spend time in Paris, specifically in the 6th arrondissement, a lively Left Bank neighborhood within walking distance of most major sights. On the Web they booked a rental above Les Deux Magots, one of the oldest and most famous cafes in Paris. It seemed too good to be true. It was.\n\nTwo nights before departure an e-mail informed them that the apartment had been double booked. They could either have their deposit back or a less appealing-looking rental elsewhere.\n\n\"It was clearly a case of bait and switch,\" Richard still fumes. The good news is that he was quickly able to find promising rentals on other Web sites and to book an apartment in the 6th.\n\n\"For years I'd been wondering what was inside those fabulous 16-foot-high doors you see throughout Europe,\" said Richard.\n\nOn arrival, the Appleyards were presented with the key to just such a door in a former convent, around a corner from the River Seine. It opened onto a flower-filled courtyard, the view from their bedroom. The kitchen was fully equipped, phone and Internet service were free, and the Louvre art museum was an easy walk, all for about $159 per night.\n\nIf You Go\n\nOur French Farm was found at www.frenchconnection.co.uk.\n\nOthers in the area are listed under Poitou-Chrante at www.gites-de-france.com\/, an umbrella listing for carefully rated rentals throughout France. Or try googling the specific region you are interested in.\n\nA search for \"vacation rentals and Paris\" on the Web brings up plenty of options.

        "text":"imagen-articulo.jpgEl Salvador: what tourists are missing\n\nFebruary 7, 2014 6:25 pm\n\nBy Chris Moss\n\n\u00a9Philip Scalia\/Alamy\nSanta Luc\u00eda Church in the centre of Suchitoto\nI was short on time. We had the wrong kind of car. The keys to the four-wheel drive were misplaced. I was hungry, thirsty and hot. The guide had forgotten his torch. And it was getting late.\n\nThe climax of my five-day trip through El Salvador \u2013 a visit to the El Imposible National Park \u2013 was beginning to look like an existential pun. Benjam\u00edn Rivera, 40, the guide-cum-driver, was desperate for me to see the bird life and hike through the tropical forest \u2013 one of the few areas of true wilderness left in this densely populated, intensively farmed country.\n\nWhen we finally had all the tools for the trip, Rivera asked me if I wanted the scenic route or the fast road.\n\n\u201cThe most direct route,\u201d I said.\n\nHe took the scenic route. Guides always know best, or so he had reminded me during our road trip through Central America\u2019s smallest country. It had started 320km away in the east, with a motorboat ride from Nicaragua to the port of La Uni\u00f3n.\nAfter welcoming us on board, Mario Mel\u00e9ndez, 37, our captain, had run through the wildlife we passengers \u2013 myself and three Swiss tourists \u2013 might see: manta rays, ospreys, frigatebirds, dolphins. He showed us pictures of tree species and mangroves, a diagram of an oyster-farming project we would pass, and named the volcanoes we could see on every horizon.\n\nHe turned a border crossing into a lovely half-day tour. We saw several of the promised species, and got a quick introduction to Salvador\u2019s turbulent recent history. Mel\u00e9ndez was a child when civil war broke out in 1979. He later escaped conscription \u2013 his father was an army recruiter \u2013 and was able to work as a fisherman and outboard motor mechanic.\n\nMel\u00e9ndez told me that half the islands\u2019 populations had emigrated to the US and those remaining lived off remesas \u2013 money wired from relatives. El Salvador\u2019s main sources of income are these remesas and foreign aid, though as Central America\u2019s most industrialised country it also generates revenue from maquilas (clothing factories), coffee and sugar cane. The question now is: can tourism play a part?\n\nMany people were not as lucky as Mel\u00e9ndez during the conflict, in which an estimated 75,000 lost their lives. The Oriente region\u2019s hilltop town of Perqu\u00edn, where I spent my first night, was a centre of resistance. Over coffee I spoke to Serafin G\u00f3mez Lima, 43, a former child soldier who now spearheads tourism projects.\n\n\u201cAfter the peace accord of 1992, we realised the war story could appeal to visitors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe organised a festival for Salvadoreans and then opened the Museo de la Revoluci\u00f3n.\u201d\n\nThe museum is a rich if roughly assembled collection of war memorabilia, weapons and photographs of heroic-looking guerrillas. Stylish agitprop posters from the 1980s are a reminder of the support that the rebel movement received from leftwing populations in Europe and the US.\nI got my fill of dark tourism in Perqu\u00edn and its environs \u2013 Rivera and G\u00f3mez Lima insisted on taking me to the interment of some victims\u2019 remains in nearby El Mozote \u2013 but the experience was engaging. Being a traveller in a recent war zone isn\u2019t voyeurism but, for Salvadoreans, an act of witness.\n\nSuchitoto is El Salvador\u2019s poster city. It is cobbled, quaint and at weekends fills with visitors from the capital 50km away. The word \u201ccolonial\u201d is thrown around loosely in Latin America but some of the buildings here are the real thing \u2013 including the former mansion where I stayed, Los Almendros de San Lorenzo, built in 1805 for Spanish landowners.\n\nOpened in 2005 after 17 months of restoration work, the hotel\u2019s six rooms (and separate honeymoon villa), pool, restaurant and palm-tree-filled patio cover a city block. Owned by Pascal Lebailly, 53, a French former fashion events organiser, and his Salvadorean partner Joaqu\u00edn Rodezno, 60 \u2013 who used to be the country\u2019s ambassador to Paris, Rome and Brussels \u2013 it is decorated with Salvadorean artworks and high-value craft pieces. The men are now ambassadors for a country they regard as safe, unspoilt by tourism and misrepresented by the media.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are interested in El Salvador now that Panama and Costa Rica have become expensive, especially for visiting Americans,\u201d said Lebailly. \u201cHere they find everything they want at affordable rates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to correct the country\u2019s image. Local media only report crime statistics and violence and that\u2019s what foreign media pick up. But the data are never analysed. None of the crimes affect tourists and none of the reports reflect the friendliness of the people.\u201d\n\nOver the past nine years, Lebailly and Rodezno have seen a \u201cslow but steady\u201d increase in visitors, including independent travellers from the US, Canada, Colombia and Brazil and small tour groups from western Europe. Russians and Polish travellers are also beginning to arrive.\n\u201cAs the country opens up to travellers, service gets better,\u201d said Lebailly. \u201cBut there\u2019s no mass-market tourism here.\u201d",

        "text":"From Cecil, the Lion\u2019s Killing to Xanda\n\ncecil the lion\n\nPoaching continues to rob us\n\nCecil the lion\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been just two years since we lost Cecil, and now his son had to face the same fate. At times, it\u2019s not just wealth\u00a0that one inherits.\u201d\n\nTourism in Zimbabwe has always been one of the bedrocks of the economy.\n\nOur concern for the environment remains limited to pollution, population growth or global warming. Most of us are selfishly concerned about issues that affect us directly. Seldom do we brood over the problems of poaching and the like. I will admit that my concern about poaching also has some selfishness embedded in it. One of the highlights of travelling is seeing animals. Poaching threatens to rob me of this. It threatens to rob future generations of the pleasure that I have so often enjoyed. Poaching and trophy hunting are not uniquely Zimbabwean problems. They are rife in most parts of Africa. Where there are animals and a market for their task, bones, hide; there are people willing to kill them.\n\n\nWhile some events of poaching get worldwide media coverage and face outrage of the commons, a greater number of killings fail to draw any public attention. Media coverage enables the concerned authorities to raise their voice valiantly against such offense. Media coverage makes sure that governments and other authorities are held accountable for issues that are happening under their watch. An incident ignited a revolt across the world a few years back. You will have heard of the prestigious lion Cecil, who was killed two years ago. Well, Cecil\u2019s son, Xanda, has had the same fate.\n\n\nThe Tragic Story of Cecil\u2019s Killing\n\ncecil-the-lion From Cecil, the Lion\u2019s Killing to Xanda\n\nImage Credit\n\nTourists, in large numbers, would travel Matabeleland North, Zimbabwe, just to visit Hwange National Park, where Cecil the esteemed lion lived. He was the pride of Hwange National Park in Matabeleland North, Zimbabwe. Cecil had earned the prestige of being the center of attraction of the park. Moreover, he was a part of a radio tracking study led by Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) of Oxford University. Even the name \u201cCecil\u201d was given by the WildCRU researchers. I can only assume that he may have been named after Cecil John Rhodes, based on the historical context, with Zimbabwe.\n\n\nIn July 2015, Cecil was shot and wounded by a hunter\u2019s arrow. A few hours later, he was tracked injured around 250 meters away from the spot where he was first shot. Some forty hours later, the hunter shot him again which ultimately took his life. When traced by the relevant authorities, Cecil was found skinned and beheaded. Hwange lost the iconic lion, the symbol pride for some Zimbabweans. Other Zimbabweans had either never heard of Cecil, or thought that there were more important issues at hand.\n\n\nInitially, it was reported by the authorities that the lion stirred out of its allotted area which ultimately triggered his killing. But later, and gradually, the true picture developed. After weeks of investigation, the officials of Zimbabwe identified the guilty behind the offense as an American dentist as well as a recreational big-game hunter named Dr. Walter James Palmer. Reportedly, Cecil was lured out of his protected area offering bait by the hunter and a local guide whom Palmer bribed considerably huge amount to kill Cecil.\n\n\nLater, the officials arrested two Zimbabweans based on the investigation in the matter. But by the time the case developed, Palmer had already returned back to America and issued a statement stating that upon knowing the fact that the lion was so famed amongst the public, he deeply regretted his action and also stated that he entirely relied upon the local expertise to ensure it was a legal hunt. He also claimed that he never knew the lion was a part of any study or research.\n\n\nReactions to the killing of Cecil the lion\n\nThe killing of Cecil ignited worldwide outrage among animal conservationists, politicians, celebrities and the masses. It is believed that the killing of Cecil has gathered the boldest response to a wildlife narrative in history. Zimbabwe suspended legal lion hunting temporarily for a period of 10 days. As per reports, initially, eight African countries which include Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Mozambique allowed consistent trade in the export of lion body parts. There were not many restrictions imposed and nor was the subject ever closely monitored. But after the carnage of Cecil, the concern came to the global limelight.\n\n\nA considerably large number of airlines prescribed the transport of animal parts because they believed it would invite negative publicity. Countries like Australia and France, which were believed to be amongst the most fascinated importers of animal trophies, straight away banned such imports. The United States, the largest importer of lion trophies, introduced certain new regulation for the protection of lions under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\nOn the other side, Palmer received death threats from various sources for the sin he had committed. He had to shut down his dental practice for a temporary period in order to veil from the rage of mass protest against him, both online and in-person. He went into hiding for weeks before he issued the statement justifying his outlook regarding his activities.\n\n\nInherited Fate of Xanda\n\n\nThe wounds of Cecil\u2019s killing were still fresh while a recent event sparked another fury. Xanda, Cecil\u2019s son, one amongst the 13 cubs Cecil left behind, met the same fate as of his father\u2019s. Xanda was recently killed with the same intention as of his father\u2019s kill- Trophy hunting. He was Cecil\u2019s oldest son and was just 6 years old. He was also a part of a study led by the same research unit of Oxford University. He too was on the verge of attaining popularity like his father when on 7th\u00a0July 2017, he was shot by a trophy hunter not much far from the spot his father\u2019s body was recovered. Xanda was wearing a GPS collar which enabled the authorities to track his location. As per sources, Xanda was killed outside Zimbabwe\u2019s Hwange National Park as a part of game hunt organized by a private hunter, Richard Cook. It is also reported that the hunter was a client of Richard Cook. Even though the authorities reported the hunt of Xanda could legal as it was executed within the stipulated guidelines, Cook refused to reveal the name of his client who reportedly killed Xanda.\n\n\nXanda would often move out of the protected area. This is believed to be the reason behind the success of the killing. He has shot a mile away from the borders of the restricted area where the authorities state that hunting is legal. On being further enquired, the officials stated that conflicts between the wild and the human are quite common. Apt rules are yet to be framed to ensure adequate safety for both the inhabitants. Moreover, on account of frequent egress of the wild beyond the protected premises, certain rules which prohibit hunting within 3 miles outside the protected area are in the process of being implemented.\n\n\nReaction to Xanda\u2019s Killing\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the execution of another lion belonging to the same family, once again the concern of wildlife exploitation ignited, and this time in social media. People from across the world are expressing their anger, grief, and concern over the matter on various social platforms. The officials of the park are facing worldwide indignation. Pressure is being imposed on the concerned authorities to respond to the bulk of questions raised on the killing of Xanda. Rising concerns over the fact that there has been constant degradation in the population of lions in the continent, as well as worldwide, adds fuel to the fire.\n\n\nLions are at risk\n\nOver the past five decades, the population of Africa\u2019s lions has reduced from a hefty total of 200000 to a fewer than 20000 today. Many conservation foundations are struggling to enact a measure to curtail the reducing population of lions but by far it seems they have failed to succeed. Lions have now completely disappeared from as many as 16 African nations. As per the reports of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), over the past 21 years, the population of lions in the continent has dropped by 42 percent.\n\n\nCountries, including Ghana and Congo, have been added to the long list of nations who have lost all their lions. And the remaining nations predict extinction in not-so-far future. Despite the existence of various factors which justify the diminishing population of lions in the continent which includes increasing population, loss of habitat, natural calamities, etc. trophy hunting is something which has largely affected the lion population. Moreover, looking stringently at trophy hunting is the most important immediate preventive measure to contain the agony being faced by the species. As per the reports of Born Free foundation, the export of lion parts and whole lions has doubled within 2009-2013 as compared to the preceding 5 years.\n\n\nConvention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) trade database depicts a total of 6,652 lion trophies exported during 2000 \u2013 2009.\u00a0 At an average, around 450 lion trophies are exported each year. Estimates suggest that trophy hunting raises more than $200 million a year across the sub-Saharan region of Africa of which, revenue from lion hunting amounts to nearly 5 \u2013 17 percent.\n\n\nDespite the enactment of numerous laws and developments of national parks and wildlife centuries, despite the reservation of forests and training and deployment of \u201cforest rangers\u201d, the sophisticated network of poachers succeed in exploiting the loopholes in the framework of the law which ultimately enables them to accomplish their immoral desires. Sometimes, every single individual in the system is bribed to keep the lucrative trade on. \u00a0Syndicates of criminals offer just two choices to customs officials, police and judges- take the money or take the bullet.\n\n\nW...

        "text":"What a worldly couple packs to look good on the go\n\nShane Mitchell\nJune 04, 2009\n\nThe chambermaid couldn't resist. She had to peek inside Madame's cosmetics bag. (After all, it was her job to pack up the suite by checkout.) There it was, lying open on the marble vanity, contents scattered. Next to it was the gentleman's dop kit. The couple had caused quite a stir in the hotel lobby when they arrived. So tall, so American. It was obvious, even to a complete imbecile like Henri the porter, who risked being fired by asking Madame for her autograph, that they were as extraordinary as the newspapers reported. And she had simply laughed when he noticed her, because everyone always clamored for Monsieur.\n\nPulling a clipping from her apron pocket, the maid looked at the photos again: Madame backstage at the Lagerfeld show; in London, lunching at Aubergine with Anouska Hempel and David Linley. With her gentleman at the grande f\u00eate for the Venice Biennale. (How did she get her hair to do that?) Always traveling for her new collection, his next film. As she gathered the toiletries into a neat pile, the maid decided: That explains why there is such a m\u00e9lange in their bags. Razor Sharp shave gel by Philosophy. Agn\u00e8s B lipstick. Naturopathica lavender stress-relief oil.\n\nInside Madame's sleek Louis Vuitton bag were provocative Chanel colors: Tabou Nightlight Burgundy and Fracas Daylight Crystal eye shadows, Mauve Ice mascara. She couldn't wait to tell her sister. And she had heard from Philippe the valet that they shared everything. Even eau de toilette?She picked up a bottle and read the label: Eau de Campagne, from Sisley in Paris. The maid sprayed a bit on her wrist. The scent was tr\u00e8s\u2026unisexe.\n\nShe found a damp bottle of shampoo in the shower and carefully wiped it off. It would be a crime to soil the handsome leather of Monsieur's bag. For an American, his toilette was oddly English. D.R. Harris & Co. toothbrush, Joris razor, a shaving brush. Perhaps his next film was to take place in London?At least he favored sweet almond soap from L'Occitane, made near her family's house in Provence. On the tub, the couple had left a small bottle of bath oil\u2014the label read: Jo Malone Nutmeg & Ginger. She wondered, looking intently at the oval bath, if they ever employed it \u00e0 deux. There was a blue vial of Naturopathica Honey Vanilla lip balm and a petite Perfumes Isabell Garden Herbs candle in a glass votive. Voil\u00e0! The wick was burnt. As a key rattled in the lock, the maid zipped up the cases and laid them with the luggage for Henri to take down in the service lift. No one would catch her. Not this time.\n\nWomen's Bag\nLouis Vuitton Cannes Epi leather bag\n* Chanel mauve mascara\n* Acca Kappa biodegradable toothbrush\n* Jo Malone skin serum with protein\n* Relax smelling salts\n* Herm\u00e8s sterling silver pillbox\n* Ad Hoc compact magnifying mirror\n* Soap from the Hempel hotel, London\n* Grandiflorum solid perfumes: Floral Ambrette and Balsamic Velvet\n* Acca Kappa aluminum comb\n* Shu Uemura retractable sable makeup brush\n\nMen's Bag\nConnolly leather wash bag\n* Descamps terry bath mitt\n* Kiehl's everyday shampoo\n* Bone-handled toothbrush and Pick-Me-Up tonic, from D.R.

        "text":"Weather Forecast\n\n\nDNT travel review: Duluth to Phoenix direct\n\nEmail Sign up for Breaking News Alerts\nNews Two Harbors,Minnesota 55616\nLake County News Chronicle\n(218) 834-2144 customer support\nDNT travel review: Duluth to Phoenix direct\nTwo Harbors Minnesota 109 Waterfront Dr. 55616\n\nhe second-biggest mistake travelers to Phoenix make, the cab driver says, is renting a car from the wrong airport.\n\nWe're on our way from Phoenix-Mesa Gateway (where we exit on the tarmac on a warm night, greeted by a cactus and a half-dozen wheelchairs) to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to pick up my mis-reserved wheels.\n\n\nThe cost for this lesson: $60+.\n\nI took Allegiant Air's inaugural direct flight from Duluth to Phoenix last weekend, an event that included sheet cake at the airport, a complimentary sleeve of golf balls and the words \"maiden voyage\" repeated so often that I was surprised there wasn't a marching band. I spent about 65 hours in the Valley of the Sun, mostly downtown. I ate the most intense salsa I've ever had and was mistaken for a prostitute. I questioned Phoenix native Alice Cooper's legacy and watched a car melt. I studied American Indian art and history and was left alone on a bus for 10 minutes while the driver ran in to Walgreens. I was charmed by Tempe's Mill Avenue District and grossed out by the dirt undertones of the tap water.\n\nAnd -- because of another snafu with my car reservation at the second airport -- I did it all by navigating the city's decade-old Valley Metro light rail system and city buses. This was clean and convenient and gave me the chance to gaze at the surrounding mountains, hills and reddish rock formations, rather than following a GPS or my face pressed to a map. Smart phones, with access to public transportation routes and compasses, have made travel so easy that everything pre-2000 seems like an episode of \"Little House on the Prairie\" in comparison.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nThe light rail system is easy. It's efficient. It's bicycle-friendly with hooks to hang them on in specified cars. The windows are tinted to block out the sun. And its passengers are oddly chatty. I hear conversations about the naming conventions of domestic airports and I see a man try to share a can of Tecate beer with a 19-year-old kid he mistakes for his nephew.\n\nThe buses, however, are empty. It's just the driver and me heading into the foothills of the South Mountains. Toward the end of the trip he pulls over at a bus stop, mumbles something and jumps off. He leaves it running, doors open, and walks into Walgreens. This seems ... different. Dangerous, even.\n\nFor about the third time in my life, I wonder: \"What would Sandra Bullock do?\"\n\nI get off the bus and stand next to it. The driver returns about 10 minutes later and we proceed without incident -- though he doesn't find jokes about bus theft very amusing.\n\nBest brunch in town\n\nThe first meal of the weekend for both tourists and Phoenicians -- and even Food Network star Guy Fieri, who has left his graffiti-style stamp on an inside wall -- is at Matt's Big Breakfast, a square brick diner where all morning long the sidewalk is crammed with rumbling tummies.\n\n\"There are 19 names ahead of ours,\" a woman groans to her group. They don't leave.\n\nMost clusters gather on the somewhat shaded side of the building. It is already 85 degrees at 10 a.m. and the sun is pan-searing my blue Minnesota skin. It goes quickly, though. Will gladly trade a 45-minute wait in the slim shade of a street light in exchange for this day's special: Three-egg scramble with chicken artichoke sausage and baby organic spinach bound with Fontina cheese. The wheat toast is cut as thick as a slab of beef loin and served with blueberry jam, a concentration of flavor that rivals chutney.\n\nA tale of two cities\n\nAside from the crowd outside this small diner, there is little movement in downtown Phoenix on a weekend afternoon. It has the apocalyptic feel of downtown St. Paul, so many suits evacuating on Friday at 5 p.m. The voice of a busker, stationed on North Central Avenue and East Adams Street, bounces off the buildings and is heard blocks away.\n\nAlternately, the Mill Avenue District -- located a 30-minute train ride away in the adjacent city of Tempe -- has brick sidewalks, is inordinately clean and is full of activity.\n\nIt's a mix of chain and charm: Hooters and Five Guys Burgers, but also retro-style clothing store Hippie Gypsy and Old World Books, a used bookstore where a wizardly-looking man with a cane asks if he can help finding anything. I smile, say no and almost trip over a long-haired cat lounging in the stacks. Some of the restaurants with outdoor seating provide mists of water over the patio, so fine it feels like being sprinkled with cool powdered sugar.\n\nI'm third on the scene of a car fire on Saturday afternoon, so close that at least three people ask if it's my ride. The blue Nissan Versa has flames creeping from the hood to the windshield and the car seems to melt as the fire grows. The driver and a passenger escape with their things before firefighters snuff it using hoses and an axe.\n\nThere is an intriguing butte at the foot of the Mill Avenue train stop. The hill has a massive A on the side, visible from Sun Devil Stadium, home of Arizona State football. Dot-sized hikers can be seen walking, some running, up the winding path. I find a father taking his kids through a round of calisthenics and explaining the income levels of professional athletes. It doesn't take long to get to the top, an elevation of 1,500 feet, with a view into the bowl of the Sun Devils' stadium -- though not quite the field. This is fine, as the Sun Devils are on the road this weekend. When airplanes from Sky Harbor fly over this butte, it seems like I should be able to read the pilot's nametag.\n\nFrom shock rock to T-shirt shop\n\nGame nights must be wicked in downtown Phoenix, where the Arizona Diamondbacks play Major League Baseball at Chase Field and, when there isn't a lockout, the Phoenix Suns host NBA games at US Airways Center. But this Saturday is quiet -- except for a pub crawl of twenty-somethings prowling the city in Mardi Gras beads and fishnet costumes or oversized mascot heads.\n\nA purely scientific question has been eating at me for days. Q: What would a restaurant and bar owned by metal shock rocker Alice Cooper look like? Word on the street is that servers have smears of black makeup under their eyes. A: Alice Cooperstown is a barbecue-themed sports bar and restaurant with an attached souvenir shop. It has T-shirt racks. And its owner, known for maybe or maybe not ripping the head off a live chicken then drinking its blood, closes up shop by 10 p.m. on a Saturday night.\n\nOh, Alice Cooper. How perfectly Coldplay of you.\n\nMystery Castle\n\nThe bus takes me a little less than a mile from Mystery Castle, which has a back story as interesting as its actual architecture. Boyce Gulley left his wife and daughter in Seattle in the 1930s when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He moved to the outskirts of Phoenix and began building a dream castle for his daughter, Mary Lou, using dirt, stone and the kind of stuff one would find cluttering a hoarder's lawn.\n\nThe result was an 18-room, 13-fireplace home complete with secret coves and cubbies, built-in beds and tables, balconies and patios. It took about 15 years to build, and his estranged wife and daughter didn't find out about it until after his death. They then spent the rest of their lives at the castle. Mary Lou died a year ago.\n\nThe castle sits in the foothills of South Mountain, a rocky formation with a view of a golf course and downtown Phoenix, but a half-mile from any sort of main road with nothing else around. The lawn is filled with bird baths, ceramic dogs, cactus plants and wagon wheels. Much of it is without electricity, the sun through recycled windows as its main light source.\n\nHeard Museum\n\nIt's a challenge to resign yourself to an indoor educational activity when it is 95 degrees out and sunny. In a mental tournament between the Phoenix Art Museum, Desert Botanical Gardens and Heard Museum. The latter, specializing in American Indian art and culture, wins. A temporary exhibition of Retha Walden Gambaro's \"Attitudes of Prayer\" is a collection of smooth sculptures caught in contemplative and freeing moments. Also stunning is Steven Yazzie's \"Fear of a Red Planet: Relocation and Removal 2000.\" It is a bit like an extra-large graphic novel-style mural, the story of the forced removal of Arizona's native population told in panels on the wall in the Ullman Learning Center.\n\nNot for sale\n\nIt would be a gross oversight to not eat Mexican food on this trip. I use a combination of proximity, Phoenix's alternative weekly newspaper and the Yelp app to land at Comedor Guadalajara, located just off of downtown and next to nothing but a freeway exit.\n\nThe restaurant is a big room with a barn-style roof and the music system is piping pop music with Spanish lyrics about dancing and nighttime.\n\nThe pre-meal salsa is unreal. It's so spicy it pinches parts of my tongue I didn't even know existed and tickles my sinuses. The server keeps it coming. I have a combination platter that includes a cheese enchilada and dessert.\n\nOn my way back to the bus stop a truck honks at me twice, performs a U-turn, then pulls on to a nearby side street. The driver honks again, two short beeps. Then he drives past the stop, honks, pulls on to another side street, honks.\n\nThis is when I realize he thinks I'm a prostitute and I set a personal record in the 50-yard dash back to the restaurant's parking lot.\n\nLeaving Phoenix\n\nGetting from downtown Phoenix to the airport in Mesa on public transportation would require an Olympic level of juggling luggage, trains and buses, so you really need a car. Since I don't have one, my cab fare exceeds the amount the driver can accept using his archaic credit card system. This ends in a bargain: Buy a 45-mile trip, get 12 o... (truncated)",

        "text":"Takamatsu: Udon the key to Shikoku castle town\u2019s heart\n\n\nContributing Writer\n\nTakamatsu has gained recognition in the last half-century for its specialty Sanuki udon and the incredible gardens of Ritsurin Koen. In the process, the city has quietly become the go-to destination for travelers starting their exploration of the island of Shikoku. As the closest port to Honshu, the castle town flourished under the daimyo of the Edo Period (1603-1868), and has a long history of maritime trading. Today, the town is a city, and is the business capital of Shikoku and the heart of Kagawa Prefecture, with plenty to offer any traveler who steps onto its streets.\n\nWhether it\u2019s by direct bus from Takamatsu Airport or a short train journey from the center, the first stop on anyone\u2019s list is usually Ritsurin Gardens. Famed for its \u201cborrowed scenery\u201d of forest-cloaked mountains and calm boat rides across shimmering lakes, the gardens are known as a place of carefully constructed serenity.\n\nConstruction began under feudal Lord Ikoma Takatoshi in 1625 and continued for more than 100 years under the watchful eyes of successive family members until the gardens were completed in 1745. Ritsurin remained a private retreat for the Matsudaira family for more than a century, but was designated a prefectural park in 1875 following the Meiji Restoration.\n\nSplit into two halves, the north garden is Western in style and the south is Japanese, with six ponds and 13 mounds creating a world in miniature. The concept of borrowed scenery is common in Japanese gardens \u2014 where designers use the surrounding landscapes as a backdrop for smaller scenes \u2014 but here that art is perfected. The soft curves of Mount Shiun form a backdrop for the gardens and, rather than marking borders with fences and walls, the edges of Ritsurin merge seamlessly with their natural counterparts, allowing the eye to wander across the landscapes as one.\n\nThe gardens are impossible to explore in a hurry: Small hills and viewpoints stop you in your tracks and paths tempt you into hidden pockets of beauty. Following the south garden route you can admire traditional wasen boats as they glide across the main pond and even ride in one yourself. Friendly guides aboard the boats offer explanations of the garden\u2019s construction and notable features as you relax and enjoy the views once reserved for feudal lords. Within the gardens is the Kikugetsu-tei teahouse, perched on the water\u2019s edge and positioned perfectly for autumnal moon viewing. For a few hundred yen, you can relax on tatami with traditional matcha and delicate wagashi sweets, looking out across Nanko pond as boats pass by.\n\nAlthough its name translates to \u201cChestnut Grove,\u201d Ritsurin is famed for its collection of pine trees, with more than 1,000 carefully pruned trees lining the garden\u2019s paths. With curved branches and imposing silhouettes, they resemble bonsai trees and lend a magical yet haunted feel to the gardens. One of the most impressive is the Neagari Goyo-matsu pine, which was gifted to the Takamatsu domain in 1833 as a bonsai by the 11th Tokugawa shogunate. It now stands tall, looming over the Kikugetsu-tei teahouse with fantastically twisted branches that provide shade from the summer sun.\n\nLike Japan itself, seasonal changes transform huge areas of the gardens, filling ponds with floating water lilies, arches with hanging wisteria and whole swaths of hillside with autumn leaves. The gardens are home to a gift shop and the Sanuki Fold Craft Museum, displaying a variety of Kagawa lacquer ware, dolls and local rihei-yaki ceramics. Kagawa was the first place in Japan to successfully cultivate olives, and the garden shop is a great place to pick up a bottle to take home.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve wandered through each and every corner of the garden, you\u2019ll no doubt have worked up an appetite and there\u2019s only one dish to try in Kagawa \u2014 Sanuki udon. Known as the \u201cudon prefecture,\u201d Kagawa is home to more than 700 udon shops and is the largest udon producing prefecture in Japan.\n\nSanuki udon is the local specialty and, alongside Mizusawa udon from Gunma Prefecture and Inaniwa udon from Akita Prefecture, it is one of Japan\u2019s top three udon noodles. Characterized by their chewy and firm texture, the noodles were originally made from Sanuki wheat grown in the prefecture, but are now mostly made from wheat imported from Australia. Due to the udon\u2019s popularity, you won\u2019t have any problem finding a restaurant to try the noodles, but some restaurants are worth a little extra effort.\n\nTraditionally, Sanuki udon are served fast, fresh and with minimal fuss, often in self-service restaurants. The process of lining up, ordering and selecting toppings is definitely speedy, but sometimes it\u2019s nice to savor the moment and enjoy your food.\n\nOne of the best spots for this is Shinpei Udon in the Kawaramachi area, which can be found at the end of the city\u2019s shopping arcade. Easily reached from the gardens using the pleasingly retro trains of the Kotoden Kotohira Line, this local favorite is full-service, always busy and pays tremendous attention to detail. There\u2019s both tatami seating and communal counters, and staff speak English, Chinese and Japanese.\n\nWhether you order the summer special of Hiyakake udon, or the warming Shippoku udon in winter, you won\u2019t be disappointed. One of the simplest dishes, however, is Kamaage udon: a portion of noodles served in their cooking water in a rotenburo-like wooden bowl. With a side-serving of a strong, soy-based dipping sauce, you can focus on the texture and subtle flavors of the udon: simple and delicious. It\u2019s easy to see why Japan is so in love with Sanuki udon, and the locals are proud of their specialty. One regional dish, Kamatama udon, is so popular that the local Takamatsu soccer team, Kamatamare Sanuki, named themselves after it. The dish is made with beaten eggs and a soy or fish broth.\n\nAs you head back toward the city center and Takamatsu Station, there\u2019s one final spot worth visiting before continuing your journey in Shikoku. Looking out across the Seto Inland Sea, Takamatsu Castle was once one of the three great water castles of Japan. Although little remains of the original structure, it is a site worth exploring and has both unusual moats and well-tended gardens. The Western-style, three-story castle was first built by Ikoma Chikamasa in 1590 and took two years to complete. Just over half a century later it became the residence of the Matsudaira clan, who were relatives of the ruling Tokugawa shogun, and remained under their control until the end of the Edo Period. Although the castle was damaged by bombs during World War II and later demolished, there are two surviving turrets and the traditional entrance bridge remains.\n\nCrossing into the castle grounds, you\u2019ll be greeted by a seawater moat and the sight of wasen boats that can be hired for short rides. The boats pass by the roof-covered Sayabashi bridge that connects the honmaru (core of the castle) to the ninomaru (outer castle). One of the two surviving turrets, Tsukimiyagura, has been carefully maintained and is an impressive feature. Designed for moon viewing, it was used to look out across the sea for advancing boats and to announce the daimyo\u2019s return from his travels. Takamatsu Castle is slated for reconstruction and in 2013, its foundations were restored after years of work, but no further progress has been made since. The gardens are still popular however, with more than 90 cherry trees in the Sakuranobaba area of the castle becoming a busy hanami spot in spring.\n\nHowever, it is the dry stone garden that is the castle\u2019s real attraction With its aged pine trees and winding paths, it feels a world away from the bare castle walls. Called Naienoniwa, the garden was built in 1917 along with the Hiunkaku \u2014 a reconstruction of the original daimyo\u2019s home that is now used for banquets and flower-arranging classes. With stepping stones and bridges crossing ever-empty streams, the sketch-like perfection of the space remains untouched by the movement of water. A sense of serenity and calm envelops the garden, removing you from the busy roads of the city and rewarding explorations into the quieter corners of the castle.\n\nGetting there: Takamatsu is served by Takamatsu Airport, which has direct flights to Tokyo. The city is also connected by rapid train to Okayama City, which is on the JR Tokaido\/Sanyo Shinkansen Line. Night buses run from Tokyo to Takamatsu and take approximately 10 hours one way.",
