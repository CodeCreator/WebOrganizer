        "text":"Investigation Discovery: The Vanishing Women edited by James Ellis\n\nInvestigation Discovery: The Vanishing Women\u00a0edited by\u00a0James Ellis\nMy rating: 3 of 5 stars\n\nMagazine, 98 pages\nPublished July 2016 by Topic Media Lab\nSource: Purchased print edition\n\nA feature magazine about the six missing women from Chillicothe, Ohio since May 2014. I had not heard of this case and ID's presentation is very respectful to the families. In fact, it is also somewhat of an ode to the six women. We are told all about who they were, how they disappeared and in four cases, the finding of their bodies. This is all and well and hopefully, will serve to bring further tips and information to the police. However, from a true crime reader perspective, it is not satisfying as nobody has been caught, no suspect is named and in reality, we don't even know if the six disappearances are related. One is already labelled a suicide though the police are willing to look at any future evidence contrariwise. The photographs show lots of pictures of scenery and architecture mostly. The best part of the magazine from an entertainment perspective for the true crime reader are approx. the last 20 pages which feature other missing women cases, some solved, some not, some rescued, others only bodies found. This part includes Elizabeth Smart, Jaycee Dugard and the Cleveland Three along with other perhaps less known cases. For reading, I preferred ID's previous magazines, but we can at least take heart that this feature may lead to new information coming forth.\n\nPS - The day after I wrote this review Jason McCrary was convicted of the murder of one of the women featured here, Timberly Claytor! Yeah!\n\n\n  1. Huh. This sounds interesting, but depressing. I hope it helps solve these cases and bring some closure to the women's families.\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\nPopular Posts",

We made an appointment for the following day where he met my \u00a0brother and my cousin's mother. The strange thing is that he didn't park in front of our office but he was driving. He explained how he works and requested info on our cousin and some documents including his id copy which we gave him. He demanded a deposit of R2500 which we paid him. The following day he claimed to have a lead and demanded R2000 for petrol as they work as a team which we gave him. He wanted more money again and we started to be suspicious of him. My husband demanded proof of info he said he has including pictures. \u00a0All this time he is phoning us and updating us on what's happening. \u00a0When we want info,he refuses to give us. My husband told him that we won't give him any money until he give us the info. I told him to stop communicating with me or the mother and \u00a0contact the my husband only with the info but he is avoiding him.

Even though I was paying more than the minimum amount, he said that was just going toward the finance charge and not the principal amount of the purchase.\u00a0\n\nAgain, I should have realized what was happening but in my state of mind \"I WAS FREAKING OUT\".\u00a0 i had financial problems in the past and thought the terms of this \"new\" card I had may have some provisions as Mr. Brown was telling me.\u00a0 He also told me I would be arrested if not settled today.\n\nI agreed to pay but the banks were closed by this time and I could only get so much fromthe ATM. Mr. Henderson said I could send the rest the next day if I sent as much as I could right now.\u00a0 He told me to get a \"Net Spend Reloadable Voucher\".\u00a0 It has a pin number on it that you scratch off.\u00a0 I sent him $340.00 by this method. He called me back and said the transaction did not go through and to call the number on the card to make sure it is activated.\u00a0\n\nI did and was told the transaction did go through and was transferred to some credit card.\u00a0 I JUST GOT SCREWED!\u00a0 The reloadable card person said this is a scam and she has heard of it before and that I should call the police and report it.\u00a0 As I went back and read the emaild letter from Baker, I realized I was in fact scammed.\u00a0 The letter had poor grammar; it was dated Sept 5, 2013 (today) so I could not have received it in the mail yet and some of the language was offensive to say the least.\n\nI should have done more before paying them any money.\u00a0 That was my costly mistake and trust me it won't happen again.\n\n\nThis report was posted on Ripoff Report on 09\/06\/2013 07:30 AM and is a permanent record located here: http:\/\/www.ripoffreport.com\/reports\/baker-and-mckenzie\/san-francisco-california-94111\/baker-and-mckenzie-baker-and-mckenzie-law-firm-richard-henderson-senior-paralegal-credit-1082175.

It was interesting to return to my vehicle and find a parking violation for failure to display the front license plate. Granted I realize this is indeed a valid minor violation, but I noticed as I looked down the row, approximately 1\/3 of the vehicles also had parking violation notices as well. I pulled up to the toll booth to pay the parking fee and asked the attendant about the fine. She said the Parking Violations Bureau is routinely at all the LAX associated parking lots feeding on all the unsuspecting travellers.\n\nApparently if you park at one of the private parking companies, it is considered 'private property' so they are not allowed to enter for the purpose of scowering for unsuspecting victims. Because LAX is part of the city of Los Angeles, the associated parking lots such as the best known parking lot C, are considered the same as if you parked on the street in the city, allow this to be a cash cow.\n\nHow pathetic a use of law enforcement resources, I thought to myself.

Flowers didn't arrive Friday and I called my dad and they still were not delivered on Saturday at 11:00 am. I then called the florist and he said they had left a message with my mom and they were waiting for her to return their call to let them know she was home. I told him she was elderly & hard of hearing and I had talked to her and she would be home until 4:00 pm so go ahead and deliver them.\n\nI called about 2:30 pm and they were still not there. I called the florist and talked to a man, Terry, and he said they had put them on the truck and it wasn't his fault, because my mom hadn't called them. I told him I would never do business with them again and he politely hung up on me. I was so upset and shocked that a person would do this to a customer.\n\nWhen my sister-in-law got to my mom's the flowers had been left on the neighbors porch. She took a picture and I have included both what I ordered and what she got.

[continued below]....\n\n..... 10:40 am PST) that the search alert was created by the stalker, confirmed that most of the search alerts are NOT REAL, TOALLY FAKE FORADVERTISING PURPOSES. \u00a0This stalker has cause me 4 years of heartache and worry, So I confronted the stalker by email. \u00a0She says she gets the same search alerts(probably not true as I do not search for her). \u00a0I sent Mylife.com 2 seperate emails with a header of ATTN: Please RESPOND ASAP SECURITY ISSUE. \u00a0 They claim n their customer care section that all inquiries will be answered WITHIN 24 hours, never happened. I got an auto reply that the inquiry was recieved and I would get a response within 24 hours, it never came so i called today to find out why. \u00a0They refused to answer why they never got back to me. \u00a0I tried to speak to a manager, I was refused as well, saying \"there wasn't one available\" or something like that, either way, no manager access. \u00a0 I explained that their FAKE SEARCH ALERT software had caused me to already file police reports, and was currently in the process of obtaining a restraining order becas ethe stalker has threatened to harm me and\/or my family. \u00a0I also explained that I wanted a record from my account of which of the searches were real, from the stalker, ones she actuay performed herself, and I was told i would need a court subpoena to retrieve those. \u00a0This company is extremely decptive, they use misleading, unethical and dishonest tactics to promote their services which are not even real. \u00a0These deceptive practices almost led me to court over how many alerts I recieved, giving the exact date\/time\/name of the person looking for me and exactly when they searched, all fake. \u00a0Mylife.com has actually caused the local Sheriffs' Dept and the courts time and money, as they have already called this person and have had to issue me paperwork for the restraining order, and if finalized, would have had to pay for the filing, service to the defendant, and an entire court case for the restraining order. \u00a0 Rachael from Mylife.com could not explain why it is legal for Mylife.com to use misleading and fake advertising sacms to get people's money for services they supposedly provide, but illegal for all other businesses to do. \u00a0I now it is illegal and unethical for a busines to trick or mislead or decieve anyone, so I am writing tis complaint. \u00a0I informed \"Rachael\" that I would be filing complaints with every single consumer group I could because of the legal severity of this case, citing the need for a complete change to their unethical practices, or at least a DISCLAIMER on their site and all pages within their site that the search alert is not real. \u00a0I am also EXTREMELY concerned about Mylife.com failing to respond or knowingly ignoring \u00a0two(2) different emergency inquiries about this and the legal ramifications it is causing. \u00a0If the slaker(who is extremely dishonest but occaisionally says something true)is not lying, that means MYlife.com has been giving her the direct impression that I have been searching for her every 2 days. \u00a0 This is unacceptable, and I honestly hope that Mylife.com gets a class action suit filed against them and goes bankrupt from losing the case. \u00a0There are thousands of legitamate businesses out there that suffer and lose business every day that scam companies are allowed to operate.\n\nThis report was posted on Ripoff Report on 06\/20\/2013 10:57 AM and is a permanent record located here: http:\/\/www.ripoffreport.com\/reports\/mylifecom\/internet\/mylifecom-misleading-untruthful-scam-dishonest-business-practices-deceptive-advertising-1060710.

Test drove it around town and it all seemed fine. Agreed to buy it for the ridiculously high price of 5000 dollars for a 15 year old car with 165K miles on it. But my credit was bad and they agreed to finance so I gave them 1K down and agreed to 204 per month.\n\nThe following day I drove down the mountain to get groceries. We live at an elevation of about 5000 feet so it's a pretty steep drive comming back up home. Truck overheats halfway up. Barely make it home with boiling coolant in the radiator. Took it to the dealership and owner agreed to replace radiator. He had the cheapest possible radiator put in. Car continued to overheat. I returned to the dealership several times and the owner simply couldn't offer any solution other than waiving my payments till I could get the issue fixed.\n\nShortly afterwards the transmission started acting up so I took it to a shop and 3K later I had the transmission rebuilt thinking it might help with the overheating issue. No dice. Started replacing everything I could think of. Found out the dealership had REMOVED the thermostat in order to get the truck to drive o.k. on level ground. With the thermostat it would overheat within minutes. It got so bad it actually destroyed the cheap radiator installed by the dealership. I replaced it with a heavy duty radiatior and thought it would solve the issue but that's when the transmission failed again.\n\nI called the owner and tried to figure out a solution but he was a complete p***k and didn't want to work with me anymore and said that if I felt ripped off I should take him to court. I thought about it but because all the junk he sells is sold AS IS then I would never win. I told him I would never pay him a dime for the vehicle and if he wants it back he would have to come get it because I was not going to repair anything anymore.\n\nI recently found out from the mechanic that works there that the owner was well aware of my overheating issues and knew the motor was shot and needed a serious overhaul yet he said NOTHING to me and let me spend 3K rebuilding the transmission. Worse yet he knew the issued the truck had BEFORE I even bought the truck.\n\nThis guy...the owner....is a real crooked SOB that buys cars from auctions and does not test them at all for anything. He figures as long as the cars make it to the dealership from the auction then they are o.k.\n\nI know I'm not alone.\n\nThis report was posted on Ripoff Report on 02\/17\/2010 02:11 AM and is a permanent record located here: http:\/\/www.ripoffreport.com\/r\/Mountain-Magic-Motors-Crestline-Ca\/Crestline-California-92325\/Mountain-Magic-Motors-Crestline-Ca-screwed-me-over-and-I-am-not-the-only-one-Crestline-570513.

        "text":"\u2022 Report: #474617\n\nComplaint Review: Video Professor, Inc.\n\n  \u2022 Submitted: Wed, July 29, 2009\n  \u2022 Updated: Wed, July 29, 2009\n\n  \u2022 Reported By:Venice Florida\nVideo Professor, Inc.\n2590 W. 2nd Ave, Unit 15 Denver, Colorado U.S.A.\n\nVideo Professor, Inc. Uses false advertising, hidden non-published charges, steals from your Credit Card accout. Denver Colorado\n\nWhat's this?\nWhat's this?\nWhat's this?\nIs this\nRipoff Report\nAbout you?\nRipoff Report\nA business' first\nline of defense\non the Internet.\nIf your business is\nwilling to make a\ncommitment to\ncustomer satisfaction\nClick here now..\n\nDoes your business have a bad reputation?\nFix it the right way.\nCorporate Advocacy Program\u2122\n\nSEO Reputation Management at its best!\n\nOn July 3, 2009 I was linked to Video Professor, Inc. home site with the offer of \"Free\" Digital Camera lessons for only a $6.95 S&H charge. Next to the \"Free\" offering was an asterisk. Next to the asterisk below was the S&H charge. Without the asterisk next to it, it said that you make keep two of the disks for free and return the other within ten days to avoid purchase charges. No amount for the purchase was indicated.\n\nI foolishly provided a Charge Card number on their secure site. Assuming that because this company has been around so long and did so much advertising on TV, that they were legitimate. I clicked the \"send me the free lesson\" button and that's when my problems began.\n\nThe next contact I had with Video Professor, Inc. was an email dated July 24, 2009 that thanked me because I \"decided to learn with Video Professor!\" and that I'd receive my \"Digital Devices learning lessons within a few short days.\" I didn't order Digital Devices, I order Digital Camera lessons. I called the customer service number listed on the email and explained that there was a mistake. I was told that \"Digital Devices\" was my second lesson that I enrolled to receive. No, I said, I didn't want it and wanted to cancel whatever program I was \"enrolled\" in. Also, I didn't want to be charged for the second lesson, I hadn't even received the first one.\n\nI was told by the service person that I was cancelled and wouldn't be sent any more lessons. That afternoon, the 24th I got the first lesson in the mail. There was no paperwork with the lesson that discussed sending anything back within 10 days or about product charges if I didn't return anything.\n\nYesterday July 28th I found out that I was charged $189 plus $6.95 in various small charges by Video Professor, Inc. on July 27th. I also received the second lesson \"Digital Devices\" that I did not order. I called the 800 number on my statement and talked again with the service person. They said the charges were for the first lesson I had ordered. I wasn't entitled to a refund because more than 10 days had passed. They hadn't. I complained about the lack of information and time to evaluate and return the product.\n\nThe customer service person \"talked with\" their \"supervisor\" and did give me two Return Authorization numbers. They told me that I'd be credited with the $189 in 10 to 21 business days from when they received my returned lessons. I immediately went on line to search for information on the well known Video Professor. Now after \"Googling\" the company, I've found that they have and are scamming thousands of people.\n\nToday, July 29, 2009 I took a number of steps to protect myself in the future from this scam operation called Video Professor. I called my Bank, registered a complaint with the fraud division, cancelled my card, had a new card issued. Began the process of filing a fraud complaint with the Colorado Attorney General's office and sent back the lessons by Registered\/Return Receipt Requested, at my own cost of another $20. I also sent out a warning to everyone I exchange email with to avoid Video Professor and it's scam. Hopefully, it will begin being passed on. I wish someone had told me about this before July 3rd.\n\nI don't know how this scam operation is allowed to continue. I think they have invested a lot of money in protecting themselves with legal papers and small print. The information needs to get out that no one should fall for their scheme again. I don't know if I'll ever see my $189 again. What I will do is spend time and energy to get the word out to as many people as I can.\n\nVideo Professor is a scam operation offering \"free\" lessons to \"Phish\" for Credit and Check Card numbers, then steal from the unfortunate people that provide them. They are the lowest form of predator that I've seen advertise anywhere.\n\nVenice, Florida\n\nThis report was posted on Ripoff Report on 07\/29\/2009 01:18 PM and is a permanent record located here: http:\/\/www.ripoffreport.com\/r\/Video-Professor-Inc\/Denver-Colorado-80219\/Video-Professor-Inc-Uses-false-advertising-hidden-non-published-charges-steals-from-yo-474617.

After the second time she was released it was probably about 6 or 7 months later I began seeing other behaviors that was not normal so this year I tool her to holy spirit hospital in camp hill, pa to see if they can. [continued below]....\n.....check her. They admitted her.again and said her behavior was out of control. She was in kids peace for about a week and they released her on 450 mg of lithium and 350 of sequel and tennex. I could tell as soon as I picked her up she was not the same. She was so angry and after a couple days of being home she was screaming and.hitting and angry. I.took her to her med check up at diakon in mechanicsburg and I.wanTed to let him know that the doctor's at kidspeace put her on way to much medicine for her little body. Before we went into the office she was throwing a tantrum because I would not buy her a soda she was on the floor just throwing a tantrum kicking your feet and I just let her go well it was time to go back into the office so I picked her.up n carried her back in the office. When.I put her down she was still upset and threw down the doctor's chair. I was overwhelmed I was crying.but only because.I.knew it was the medicine taking over her body. Later when I got home is when I got the phone call. I didn't understand when they said I couldn't keep her safe. We were in a closed room it wasn't like she was in a street. So it's been almost 4 months and she has been.been bounced three times in foster homes. The first foster home that they had placed her in she wasnt even in there a week and she was removed because a 9 year old sexually propostioned Hailey. Then she was moved to shippenburg with another family. Hailey seemed to adapt there and liked the family but children and youth for word that there was the possibility of drugs being sold and using in the home. They took Hailey and placed her with the same foster mom from the beginning only because that boy that tried to perform sexual acts on my daughter is no longer there. They are investigating the second home and trying to send Hailey back to shippensburg. I'm supposed to be doing three days parenting skills sessions with Hailey three times a week. We are supposed to start out there and the supposed to move into my home so we can start the reunification process. Needless to say we have not moved inside my home and the woman who is my mentor at abc is procrastinating. I see a big difference in Hailey and things are going well but Andy keeps saying I have to work on this and work on that and making me watch these does on parenting. She belittles me all the time. Her father well he gets to see her 1 time at the abc office and 4 hours at his house on Sundays. Andy said we are two diff cases ...and Hailey seems to listen to her dad more. But all kids do that kids act diff with there mother and father. I feel like he's getting all this special treatment. And I saw my daughter 1 time this week. The foster mom they put her back with won't drive to where the office is three times a week. And the day she was supposed to drive her which was yesterday she said Hailey was sick. Her father said he Is seeing Hailey on thanksgiving. But not me? Something is not adding up. I didn't deserve this. Plus they are drug testing me 2 times so far and I was clean both times. Her father came up dirty and who knows if he's been having to take more. I need help .... can someone help me.\n\nThis report was posted on Ripoff Report on 11\/16\/2012 09:15 AM and is a permanent record located here: http:\/\/www.ripoffreport.com\/reports\/cumberland-county-children-youth\/carlisle-pennsylvania-\/cumberland-county-children-youth-wrongfully-taken-carlisle-pennsylvania-970125.
