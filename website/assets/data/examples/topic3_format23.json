After the second time she was released it was probably about 6 or 7 months later I began seeing other behaviors that was not normal so this year I tool her to holy spirit hospital in camp hill, pa to see if they can. [continued below]....\n.....check her. They admitted her.again and said her behavior was out of control. She was in kids peace for about a week and they released her on 450 mg of lithium and 350 of sequel and tennex. I could tell as soon as I picked her up she was not the same. She was so angry and after a couple days of being home she was screaming and.hitting and angry. I.took her to her med check up at diakon in mechanicsburg and I.wanTed to let him know that the doctor's at kidspeace put her on way to much medicine for her little body. Before we went into the office she was throwing a tantrum because I would not buy her a soda she was on the floor just throwing a tantrum kicking your feet and I just let her go well it was time to go back into the office so I picked her.up n carried her back in the office. When.I put her down she was still upset and threw down the doctor's chair. I was overwhelmed I was crying.but only because.I.knew it was the medicine taking over her body. Later when I got home is when I got the phone call. I didn't understand when they said I couldn't keep her safe. We were in a closed room it wasn't like she was in a street. So it's been almost 4 months and she has been.been bounced three times in foster homes. The first foster home that they had placed her in she wasnt even in there a week and she was removed because a 9 year old sexually propostioned Hailey. Then she was moved to shippenburg with another family. Hailey seemed to adapt there and liked the family but children and youth for word that there was the possibility of drugs being sold and using in the home. They took Hailey and placed her with the same foster mom from the beginning only because that boy that tried to perform sexual acts on my daughter is no longer there. They are investigating the second home and trying to send Hailey back to shippensburg. I'm supposed to be doing three days parenting skills sessions with Hailey three times a week. We are supposed to start out there and the supposed to move into my home so we can start the reunification process. Needless to say we have not moved inside my home and the woman who is my mentor at abc is procrastinating. I see a big difference in Hailey and things are going well but Andy keeps saying I have to work on this and work on that and making me watch these does on parenting. She belittles me all the time. Her father well he gets to see her 1 time at the abc office and 4 hours at his house on Sundays. Andy said we are two diff cases ...and Hailey seems to listen to her dad more. But all kids do that kids act diff with there mother and father. I feel like he's getting all this special treatment. And I saw my daughter 1 time this week. The foster mom they put her back with won't drive to where the office is three times a week. And the day she was supposed to drive her which was yesterday she said Hailey was sick. Her father said he Is seeing Hailey on thanksgiving. But not me? Something is not adding up. I didn't deserve this. Plus they are drug testing me 2 times so far and I was clean both times. Her father came up dirty and who knows if he's been having to take more. I need help .... can someone help me.\n\nThis report was posted on Ripoff Report on 11\/16\/2012 09:15 AM and is a permanent record located here: http:\/\/www.ripoffreport.com\/reports\/cumberland-county-children-youth\/carlisle-pennsylvania-\/cumberland-county-children-youth-wrongfully-taken-carlisle-pennsylvania-970125.

        "text":"\u201cKeith wins cases others lose. His verdicts far exceed those of mortal lawyers. Trials are his life. It is not work. It is his passion and cause. He will be remembered as one of Americas greatest trial lawyers. The numbers and the verdicts don\u2019t lie.\u201d \u2014 John Morgan\n\nRecent Testimonials\n\n\"For Keith, being a trial lawyer is not a job, it\u2019s a calling. Having had the opportunity to prepare and try complex business cases with Keith, I can tell you that his combination of talent, drive, and experience is one-of-a-kind. He\u2019s a methodical tactician, he\u2019s in touch with jurors\u2019 mindsets, and he is a clear and powerful communicator. He\u2019s also a master craftsman at the top of his game \u2013 constantly refining his techniques to give his clients every possible advantage. Having Keith at your counsel\u2019s table gives you a big leg up in any trial \u2013 a fact that is borne out by his consistently impressive verdicts.\"\n\nAttorney William B. Lewis\n\nMorgan & Morgan\n\n\"First and foremost I wanted to thank you for writing such an amazing book, 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises'. I have read it a few times and it has become a huge asset for me in trial. My last two trials have been big victories due to your trial strategies. Most recently we had a big verdict due in part to your lecture on letters of protection. At the end of the seminar I watched, you had left an email address if we had questions. Today I sent you an email not thinking I would even get a response but you responded. I cannot thank you enough for the help you gave me on my case today. You are a true asset to the legal community and I cannot thank you enough.\"\n\nAttorney Robert C. Solomon\n\nSaban + Solomon\n\n\"I\u00a0attended Keith Mitnik\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Eat the Bruises\u201d seminar put on through our state\u2019s trial lawyers association. It was the best, most practical and useful seminar I have attended. It kept me up almost all night thinking of my life experiences and analogies that I could use at trial that incorporate those life experiences. It felt like Keith was throwing out nuggets of great wisdom the entire day-long seminar. I know his words were wise because of how simple his trial ideas seemed after hearing them. As Albert Einstein said, \u201cThe definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple.\u201d And, as Robert Brault said, \u201cThe average teacher explains complexity; the gifted teacher reveals simplicity.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Eat the Bruises\u201d is genius, and Keith Mitnik is a gifted teacher.\"\n\nAttorney Justin Swaim\n\nSwaim Law Firm\n\n\"In 22 years of trial practice, I\u2019ve found that the absolute best trial attorneys are usually either naturally talented or doggedly driven to the pursuit of justice. Keith Mitnik is the rarest combination of both at the highest level. Keith has an innate gift with the spoken word and connecting with jurors and judges. He is a poet in the courtroom, and he has the ability to analyze complex issues and make them understandable to laypeople in the most persuasive way.\u00a0What I believe truly separates Keith from other incredibly talented attorneys is his tireless work ethic not only to win cases, but to continue to hone his mastery of trial work outside of the courtroom. It\u2019s one thing to put in long hours during multi-week trials, which he does on a regular basis. It\u2019s another to keep up that same drive between trials constantly thinking of ways to improve on trial themes, voir dire, opening, cross-examination and closing. The results speak for themselves, not only in the number of multi-million dollar verdicts Keith has, but in winning other cases that were thought to be unwinnable, and would have been in the hands of others. Quite simply, in my opinion Keith Mitnik is the best trial attorney in America.\u201d\n\n\nAttorney Greg Prysock\n\nMorgan & Morgan\n\n\u201cAs a recovering defense lawyer, I can spot systems, strategies, and techniques that will gut the core of a defense case. 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises' had all the earmarks of proving fatal to common defense trial practices and themes. After putting it into practice, I now can confirm it works. 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises' is nothing short of a game changer, particularly as to voir dire and selecting a fair and impartial jury. I have never had so many challenges for cause\u2014and granted\u2014since using Keith\u2019s system. I own the book and audio disc. It is part of my four horsemen of the defense apocalypse: 'Rules of the Road', 'Reptile', 'Case Framing', and 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises'.\u201d\n\n\nAttorney Tim Casey\n\nSchmitt Schneck Smyth Casey & Even, P.C.\n\n\"Keith is a warrior. And so when he straps on his gear, he fights. That's what the people who hire him want. And it works for him. Mitnik has a rare gift. He's comfortable in the courtroom. He moves around with ease. When he's comfortable, the people around him are comfortable. Keith has a self-deprecating quality. The trick, for those of us in this business, is to have confidence. . . But you can't let that make one side-step in[to] arrogance. Jurors don't like that. Mitnik's confidence and humility is a winning combination. I think he's emotionally honest. He is who he portrays. He's not putting on an act. He's comfortable attacking when he needs to attack.\"\n\n\nMayanne Downs\n\nOrlando Sentinel\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read many books on trial advocacy. 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises' is \u2013 by far \u2013 the best. Keith\u2019s method of eliminating biased jurors and foiling the Defense\u2019s plans to sabotage your case is nothing short of revolutionary. If you are a Plaintiff\u2019s trial lawyer, 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises' is a must read.\u201d\n\n\nAttorney John Kinney\n\nMoseley C. Collins III\n\n\u201cThank you so much for coming to Sacramento last week. [Don't Eat The Bruises] was the most successful seminar the CCTLA has ever had thanks to you. You got a lot of great stuff that I have used several times myself in trial since reading your book and listening to your CDs.\u201d\n\n\nAttorney Glenn Guenard\n\nGuenard & Bozarth, LLP\n\n\u201cI have been a trial lawyer for over 40 years. Earlier this year, a trusted trial consultant insisted I read Keith Mitnik\u2019s book 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises' before my next trial. It has forever changed my approach to jury selection [...] 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises' may be the best book on trial technique and strategy for plaintiff lawyers that I have ever read; it is destined to be a classic.\u201d\n\n\nAttorney Mike Stapleton\n\nBall Eggleston P.C.\n\n\u201cI bought your book, 'Don\u2019t Eat the Bruises', and I tried your techniques for the first time in a case this week and I got a great verdict and I wanted to thank you [...] I can\u2019t tell you how helpful everything you have in that book is.\u201d\n\n\nAttorney Nate Nasser\n\n\u201cI attended the seminar on Friday in Sacramento. If your presentations were not the absolute best I have seen in 25 years of practicing law, they were certainly in the top 3.\u201d\n\n\nAttorney Adam Sorrells\n\nLaw Office of Adam Sorrells",
