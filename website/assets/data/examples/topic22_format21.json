TOM GJELTENThanks for joining us. I'm Tom Gjelten of NPR, sitting in for Diane Rehm. A new California law now allows self-driving cars on state roads, at least on a test basis. Proponents promise computer-controlled vehicles will reduce accidents and congestion, maybe even eliminate the need for driver's licenses. Opponents worry there could be a loss of privacy for drivers. Joining me in the studio to talk about the future of driving in the digital age: David Shepardson of The Detroit News and Azim Eskandarian with the Center for Intelligent Systems Research at George Washington University.\n\n  \u2022 10:07:32\n\n    MR. TOM GJELTENAnd for those of you who want to hear more about this fascinating development or have questions or concerns about driverless cars, our phone number is 1-800-433-8850. Our email is We'll be getting to your calls and emails later in the show. Of course, you can also join us on Facebook or Twitter. Good morning to both of you.\n\n  \u2022 10:07:55\n\n    MR. DAVID SHEPARDSONGood morning, Tom.\n\n  \u2022 10:07:55\n\n\n  \u2022 10:07:56\n\n    GJELTENSo if you can just hold off for a few minutes because I want to start with Anthony Levandowski. He's the project manager for Google's self-driving car project, and he's on the line with us this morning from Mountain View, Calif. Thanks for being with us, Anthony.\n\n  \u2022 10:08:14\n\n    MR. ANTHONY LEVANDOWSKIGreat to be here. Thank you.\n\n  \u2022 10:08:16\n\n    GJELTENSo the -- I guess what -- driverless cars have been in development for many years. But the big news this week is this law that passed in California allowing some driving of self-driving cars. Tell us what's in this law exactly.\n\n  \u2022 10:08:32\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIWell, this law is called SB 1298, and it sets forth the framework for the DMV to set up the guidelines that vehicles will need to adhere to in order to, in the future, be able to drive themselves with or without people inside them. It outlines the type of technical standards, the types of insurance requirements. Everything that you would expect a person to go through when they get their driver's license, you would expect a vehicle that doesn't have a driver in it to be able to have.\n\n  \u2022 10:09:08\n\n    GJELTENAnd what vehicles will actually be on the road? I mean, these -- obviously, these vehicles are not available to the general public yet. So are we talking here about test drivers being able to do this? What exactly is going to change as a result of this law being passed?\n\n  \u2022 10:09:24\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIWell, what's changing really is more on the fact that, currently today, the technology is ahead of the law. And at Google, we've been focused on developing this technology with safety being our top priority because we believe that it's unacceptable that 40,000 Americans die every year, 1.2 million people worldwide, and roughly 90 percent of these accidents are caused by human error.\n\n  \u2022 10:09:49\n\n    LEVANDOWSKISo as the technology has been evolving in the last several years, we're reaching a point now where -- that we're seeing real benefits of having this technology installed on people's cars in our test slate. And I think it's a great move by Sen. Padilla to put forward measures that would close the gap between what the law says today, which is that a person doesn't need to be driving, which leaves the field wide open to something that's more sensible that has the proper guidelines in place.\n\n  \u2022 10:10:22\n\n    GJELTENWell, tell us exactly how these cars work.\n\n  \u2022 10:10:25\n\n    LEVANDOWSKISo these cars have a variety of sensors on them. They have cameras that look at traffic lights. They have laser scanners that measure the world all around it in three dimensions and radars that track other vehicles and their speeds. And all of this information is sent to a computer in the back of the vehicle that processes information and understands where the vehicle can safely drive on the road and where it's located. So you can imagine, just like your GPS navigation right now, it gives you turn-by-turn directions verbally.\n\n  \u2022 10:10:57\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIWith these additional sensors on the vehicle, you're able to properly have the vehicle drive down the street and understand where the traffic light is. And if it's red, it's going to stop. And then it's going to wait for the pedestrians to get out of the crosswalk before it makes that turn and kind of, you know, remove the aspects of driving that are dangerous for people, which is when we don't pay attention.\n\n  \u2022 10:11:20\n\n    GJELTENAnd do these cars know where they are because of the GPS technology? I mean, they know what road they're on, and therefore, they don't just react to obstacles. But they have intelligence about where they are and what they're doing?\n\n  \u2022 10:11:34\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIRight. We don't rely on GPS fundamentally to keep us driving in a similar lane. But GPS is a really good indicator to know that you're in, you know, downtown D.C., you know, or in San Francisco. But the driving itself really relies on the sensors. Just like, you know, when you drive, you look out the window. You don't look at your navigation display. You need to see what's in front of you, what's in front of the world.\n\n  \u2022 10:11:58\n\n    LEVANDOWSKISo the GPS part is just to guide you in terms of saying you need to be going northbound. But what the car picks up from the ground is really the important part of the driving.\n\n  \u2022 10:12:08\n\n    GJELTENAnd what have you at Google already done with this? You know, I read somewhere that you actually were secretly doing some test driving -- in advance, that is -- of getting official permission to do so.\n\n  \u2022 10:12:21\n\n    LEVANDOWSKISure. So we haven't been doing secret testing. But, you know, the project started back in 2008, and we've been testing our self-driving technology in California. And the number one thing that, of course, motivates us is the ability to improve people's lives dramatically. And so far, we've done about 300,000 miles of testing. And, you know, our vehicles, A, they look a little bit strange 'cause they have all this technology on them, and, B, they have, you know, Google's self-driving car labeled on the side of them. The...\n\n  \u2022 10:12:53\n\n    GJELTENWhere was that done, Anthony, that 300,000 miles that were logged?\n\n  \u2022 10:12:58\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIIt's been done on a variety of highways and surface streets in the Bay Area, in California, Nevada. We've driven in downtown D.C., actually, near the Capitol, and we've driven also in Florida.\n\n  \u2022 10:13:13\n\n    GJELTENBut how did you do that? How did you do that if the laws weren't on the books yet to allow it?\n\n  \u2022 10:13:18\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIWell, so the laws that are on the book currently in California were requiring a person to have a driver's license for the person to drive but no requirement for a computer to be able to drive the vehicle. And that was the same in Nevada, Florida and D.C. today. So it's more -- it's not that we're looking for permission. Permission has kind of always been there. What we're really looking for is kind of setting a sensible guideline so that everybody can do this safely.\n\n  \u2022 10:13:48\n\n    GJELTENYeah. So what's -- I mean, you said quite clearly that, you know, what your interest here is in safe driving and promoting safety. But what is Google's interest as a company? In other words, how did your company in particular come to this interest? How did it grow out of other products you've developed, other research you've done, you know, other business lines that you've been in?\n\n  \u2022 10:14:12\n\n    LEVANDOWSKISo Google's really a technology company, and we love innovation. And we love solving big problems. So, you know, where we see our ability to build new software to have a huge impact in the world, to save lives, make people's lives richer, we see it as a huge opportunity for us to explore. And so we don't have a commercial plan on how this technology will come to market, but we just think that, you know, in our innovation spirits, we can't pass this up. This is something too important for a society to have for it to lie dormant for a long time.\n\n  \u2022 10:14:47\n\n    GJELTENYou know, I think it's really easy to get excited about this development. Are there any caveats that you want to sort of lay out there right now so that our listeners don't get perhaps too excited about, you know, what they're going to be able to have?\n\n  \u2022 10:14:59\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIAbsolutely. So it's important to remember that, unlike things in Hollywood, technology, you know, takes a long time to develop. And right now, we're at the early stages. The things that we're working on the most are making sure that the system is more reliable than people are. And in many case, we've shown that that's true for some scenarios but not all scenarios. So while I'd love to have everybody be able to have one of these in their driveway next year, it's going to be a lot more longer before the technologies mature enough to go out.\n\n  \u2022 10:15:31\n\n    GJELTENAnd will Google actually manufacture cars or work with manufacturers, provide the technology that then car manufacturers will incorporate? What's going to be your relationship with car manufacturers?\n\n  \u2022 10:15:41\n\n    LEVANDOWSKIWell, we love technology, so we're really interested in building the technology aspect of this, and we're looking forward in talking to all the manufacturers on how to incorporate this into their vehicles. So how it will come out is undecided yet, but we're talking to everyone.\n\n  \u2022 10:15:57\n\n    GJELTENWell, finally, Anthony, how quickly can we expect actually to be... (truncated)",

want you to take me seriously you think that joke is [TS]\n\n\u00a0 funny every time God we are like a married couple now before it's not funny [TS]\n\n\u00a0 the one and one that drives my wife crazy is whenever the way to comes and [TS]\n\n\u00a0 asks if you want to test the wine and even just a tiny city and you have like [TS]\n\n\u00a0 the worst as the last week and then you say yes that's fine think-i iOS that put [TS]\n\n\u00a0 a face and pretend it's disgusting [TS]\n\n\u00a0 yeah and like she's like yeah but that wasn't funny last time it won't be a [TS]\n\n\u00a0 next time and it wasn't this time either you do that every time [TS]\n\n\u00a0 most of the day it's something fun oh is it is it fine every time for the wait [TS]\n\n\u00a0 time for the way to its not fun for my wife it's fun for the waiter every time [TS]\n\n\u00a0 because the way to hasn't seen a million times before do you think the waiter [TS]\n\n\u00a0 hasn't seen it a million times before I think the way to have seen it a million [TS]\n\n\u00a0 times before you head there probably have actually the way there is being [TS]\n\n\u00a0 paid to be nice to you it's part of their job you shouldn't judge your [TS]\n\n\u00a0 humorist skills against someone who was paid to be nice to you but I should just [TS]\n\n\u00a0 pay more people to be nice to me if you're in a restaurant you're dealing [TS]\n\n\u00a0 with the waiter or you're you're you're interacting with a service person in [TS]\n\n\u00a0 general like a hotel concierge or an uber driver or any any of these people [TS]\n\n\u00a0 in the world who are providing a service to some extent when she used the word [TS]\n\n\u00a0 sir with them I actually a more likely to call themselves than anyone else and [TS]\n\n\u00a0 I do that all the time it's almost like it's almost like an over compensation [TS]\n\n\u00a0 because of not an awkwardness but just to kind of a thing in the back of my [TS]\n\n\u00a0 head that they're kind of serving May and now I feel a bit uncomfortable with [TS]\n\n\u00a0 that power dynamic I feel like maybe I overcompensate because I will always [TS]\n\n\u00a0 call someone who is serving mayor doing something for May which sort of puts me [TS]\n\n\u00a0 in the more powerful position I always call themselves thank you very much so [TS]\n\n\u00a0 have a good day sir why I always do that I will do it particularly with my bro [TS]\n\n\u00a0 drivers they almost every single time [TS]\n\n\u00a0 normally don't speak to the drivers but then at the end you just want to [TS]\n\n\u00a0 acknowledge the person and so I would always say something like thank you sir [TS]\n\n\u00a0 right as a as I'm getting out to me it feels like if you look at the nice thing [TS]\n\n\u00a0 it's a it's a bit of a sign of respect your acknowledging that the other person [TS]\n\n\u00a0 news person too and it's a it's slightly more than a thank you but I'm never [TS]\n\n\u00a0 quite sure in in a place like England if this is as standard I don't I don't [TS]\n\n\u00a0 really know if if that is the case but you do it to that makes me feel a little [TS]\n\n\u00a0 bit better I do it I think you're overthinking I think it's alright I [TS]\n\n\u00a0 wouldn't worry about it I don't I don't think I over think things I don't think [TS]\n\n\u00a0 I over think things great if there is one thing you do it is over think things [TS]\n\n\u00a0 that's that is like you're defining quality it's now it is not my defining [TS]\n\n\u00a0 quality but it was ok but I haven't over think things but there are two problems [TS]\n\n\u00a0 with the servo one of which is I find the double sir [TS]\n\n\u00a0 suddenly gets really awkward so if I will say to her driver or the waiter [TS]\n\n\u00a0 thank you sir [TS]\n\n\u00a0 and then they say back to me thank you sir [TS]\n\n\u00a0 suddenly the surf feels ridiculous to me it doesn't work both ways like if if the [TS]\n\n\u00a0 driver beats me to it if it was like Oh have a nice day sir then I always feel [TS]\n\n\u00a0 like I have to I have to just say oh thank you you too like I can't say the [TS]\n\n\u00a0 server if the other person has beaten me to it there's something about it where [TS]\n\n\u00a0 it where it's like it's too many servers in to close at the time that span is [TS]\n\n\u00a0 just no good it doesn't work I i agree with that [TS]\n\n\u00a0 ok so I haven't over thought this is the correct way to know you have definitely [TS]\n\n\u00a0 over there now is proving my point that you're just digging a deeper and deeper [TS]\n\n\u00a0 hole of over thoughtfulness here now it's ok ok I had never thought about [TS]\n\n\u00a0 that before just because I'm just because I'm agreeing with you now that [TS]\n\n\u00a0 you put it out there doesn't mean I had thought about it before you never [TS]\n\n\u00a0 thought about this before [TS]\n\n\u00a0 not not the not the double sir first in best dressed suits you sir problem you [TS]\n\n\u00a0 have never thought near the end of an interaction which you may use the word [TS]\n\n\u00a0 sir I need to be the first person to get to the words sir this hasn't crossed [TS]\n\n\u00a0 your mind it's completely just instinct made just it's just no I'm not I'm not [TS]\n\n\u00a0 there are things that I think about before hand at the end of a taxi ride or [TS]\n\n\u00a0 a interaction with someone but one of those things is not I must make sure I [TS]\n\n\u00a0 get the first Syria and the israeli natural to me okay but so the only other [TS]\n\n\u00a0 problem and this is the one that comes up much more frequently is that there's [TS]\n\n\u00a0 no appropriate female version for sir there is no but there is no word for [TS]\n\n\u00a0 this in the English language and now if you are in Alabama you can say this is [TS]\n\n\u00a0 this is acceptable [TS]\n\n\u00a0 just broadly across the south as the serb equivalent for women but you know [TS]\n\n\u00a0 it's like in the south [TS]\n\n\u00a0 I would totally say thank you ma'am to a woman in a service position but I do not [TS]\n\n\u00a0 think that the word man in my very limited experimentation goes down well [TS]\n\n\u00a0 almost anywhere else I never get the feeling like this is a word that say a [TS]\n\n\u00a0 waitress in her thirties really wants to have applied to her under normal [TS]\n\n\u00a0 circumstances they can do you ever say ma'am you say sir do you say ma'am thank [TS]\n\n\u00a0 you ma'am in a restaurant would you say that I think I possibly would but I'm [TS]\n\n\u00a0 less likely to I think you've assessed the situation correctly I did see what [TS]\n\n\u00a0 comes out at the time that is not always the best policy and realize and [TS]\n\n\u00a0 sometimes it gets me into a pickle but I don't I usually don't think too much [TS]\n\n\u00a0 about what I'm gonna say i just i just follow my heart yes the only way I would [TS]\n\n\u00a0 use man outside of the south is if I could lay a thousand dollars on the [TS]\n\n\u00a0 table to say that the service will when I was interacting with his over 60 [TS]\n\n\u00a0 she's over 60 then I might use ma'am but if it's less than that I feel like now [TS]\n\n\u00a0 if I can't be absolutely sure about this I'm not gonna make this bad but we have [TS]\n\n\u00a0 the problem in the opposite way that the only other vaguely equivalent word is [TS]\n\n\u00a0 the word miss I feel like miss does not carry the same weight as Sir and it also [TS]\n\n\u00a0 has its own weird problems ugh radical quite the same way you do about man and [TS]\n\n\u00a0 I think when you called someone so there's a kind of joke inna sets are [TS]\n\n\u00a0 already going on it's kind of already like potential for more Nexus this bit [TS]\n\n\u00a0 of a there's been a wink wink was neither of us here particularly notable [TS]\n\n\u00a0 are important so we just switches using these formalities for fun and I think [TS]\n\n\u00a0 that applies when you would use the men so I don't think a thirty year old [TS]\n\n\u00a0 woman's gonna go my goodness he suggesting are much older than I am or [TS]\n\n\u00a0 he's he's doing it wrong I think there's already like a little game going on [TS]\n\n\u00a0 where we're joking around [TS]\n\n\u00a0 thank you sir thank you have a good day I think there's already such a this over [TS]\n\n\u00a0 the top friendliness going on that is understood the whole thing's be ready [TS]\n\n\u00a0 this just goes to the fundamental jovial nature of your whole life again imagine [TS]\n\n\u00a0 you going from place to place and just everything is happy everything's a joke [TS]\n\n\u00a0 brady's just so happy him the sun is shining are we all just having a great [TS]\n\n\u00a0 time how your social interactions just naturally go [TS]\n\n\u00a0 can do the little thanks man when you give a charming when can you scamper off [TS]\n\n\u00a0 and everybody's had a great day I wish that was true in fact I'm grumpy old man [TS]\n\n\u00a0 he just sits around whinging having paper cuts but I guess when it comes to [TS]\n\n\u00a0 that sort of thing I am a bit more jokey I do like when I actually do enjoy every [TS]\n\n\u00a0 day but I do like I do like things to be a bit in a bit of a joke I'm not an [TS]\n\n\u00a0 overly serious person I think you can get away with more than I can which is [TS]\n\n\u00a0 why I mates appropriately think about these things to the level that they [TS]\n\n\u00a0 deserve so now we have any follow-up rating do we have follow-up we have to [TS]\n\n\u00a0 show you my ass first with something I know you don't particularly like [TS]\n\n\u00a0 and this is an arbitrary shout out to a fair and pretending this and you think [TS]\n\n\u00a0 this is the thin end of the wedge it is yeah but let me explain why we have to [TS]\n\n\u00a0 do this one and you can always some reason there's always some reason if I [TS]\n\n\u00a0 left either if I left you entirely to your own accord the show would be [TS]\n\n\u00a0 starting with nothing but a long list of happy birthday wishes to everybody I [TS]\n\n\u00a0 have to ring you in on these things to some extent someone emailed me today [TS]\n\n\u00a0 asking me i'm not gonna do it right or not gonna do it but you gonna mention it [TS]\n\n\u00a0 now [TS]\n\n\u00a0 ok open that door a bit wider ok I'm gonna mention I'm not going to use the [TS]\n\n\u00a0 names of its

        "text":"Article Thumbnail\n\nRiding Shotgun in Floribama With the Truckers Keeping You Fed in the Plague\n\nThey\u2019re criss-crossing the country to keep grocery store shelves stocked. They just don\u2019t want you to forget about them when this is all over.\n\nThe sprawling Oasis truck stop in Robertsdale, Alabama, is an important hub for interstate commerce, and typically, a happy gathering point for road-weary drivers. It\u2019s located just over the border from Pensacola, Florida, on Interstate 10, situated along that stretch of Gulf Coast that locals call Floribama. The truckers who stop here have been hauling produce from California, and grocery deliveries from distributors in Texas and Arkansas. Some have even crossed the border bringing in goods from Mexico. \u201cIf you bought it, a truck brought it,\u201d one trucker there tells me on a recent Sunday afternoon.\u00a0\n\nThis, of course, is true in the best of times, but it\u2019s abundantly true now. Just like with medical workers, grocery store employees and the brave men and women currently delivering us food and packages, we\u2019re depending on truck drivers to keep criss-crossing the nation\u2019s freeways and highways, hauling loads through COVID-19 hotspots, over and over again.\n\nWhat, though, are they thinking as they continually hit that open road on our behalf (and at the risk of their own well-being) \u2014 especially because we usually regard them as more of a punchline than a lifeline?\n\nTo find out, I spoke to about 10 such truckers during my few hours at the Oasis. My abbreviated roll call:\n\n  \u2022 Gurdev Singh, age not given, is the only trucker I see who\u2019s wearing a face mask. He\u2019s friendly, straight-forward and plain-speaking. The sort of homie who says (and fully believes) things like, \u201cBeing a truck driver, we\u2019re trying to serve the community.\u201d\n  \u2022 Long-haired, long-bearded and gruff-voiced, Scott Fisher, 56, is the sort of old-school truck driver who looks like he stepped out of a country song. Being a road veteran, he laughs easily as he eagerly counts down his days until retirement.\n  \u2022 When Larry Reese, 60, walks out of the truck stop with hot food and a weary look in his eye, he\u2019s reluctant to speak with me; he does so, however, mostly because he wants people to know what truckers are dealing with in this pandemic.\n  \u2022 Wesley, in his late 40s, steps down from his rig to have a smoke, fill his trucks\u2019 tanks and grab himself something to eat. He says he doesn\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be until he might find another truck stop, since they\u2019re pretty much the only places truckers can eat these days.\n  \u2022 Sonny Singh, 29, has only been trucking for the last two-and-a-half years, but in that time, he\u2019s become an old hand. To stay safe, he travels with a co-pilot, his pit bull, Ivy.\n\nHere\u2019s what they told me\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow\u2019s the road treating you? Have you been able to find places to stop to rest?\nGurdev: I don\u2019t have any problem with that. All the rest stops are open in this area. But in Pennsylvania and other areas, they\u2019ve closed them, which is ridiculous. We\u2019re trying to serve the community. So it\u2019s ridiculous that the government isn\u2019t trying to understand our problems.\u00a0\n\nWhat about getting food and finding your next shower? How\u2019s that going now that the world is more and more shuttered?\nScott: Kinda crazy. It\u2019s definitely hard to find food.\u00a0\n\nSonny: As far as food goes, you better stop somewhere there\u2019s food at the truck stop, because 99 percent of these places will not let you enter to get food right now.\u00a0\n\nLarry: Also, if they do have food, you have to go in to get your meal and then go back to your truck to eat alone. You can\u2019t be around other people.\n\nIf you\u2019re hauling food, you don\u2019t have any hours restrictions, right?\nWesley: Nope.\u00a0\n\nIs it accurate to say that the trucking industry has loosened a lot of the regulations about the amount of hours you guys can drive?\nSonny: Temporarily, because they need something from us.\u00a0\n\nHas this changed how you\u2019re driving, or how many hours you try to get in each day?\nWesley: Nah, not really. The main thing is, do it the safe way, like we normally do.\u00a0\n\nLarry: We\u2019re still all running the same way we\u2019ve been running.\u00a0\n\nDo you think if a driver gets into a problem because they go over their hours, that the law or whomever will keep in mind that it occurred during a crisis?\nSonny: I was delivering a load of water last week to Missouri, and they still gave me an overweight ticket. I\u2019m the one bringing you guys water. So I don\u2019t know \u2014 they\u2019ll make money wherever they can, regardless.\u00a0\n\n\nDo you worry about other truckers on the road, the ones pushing themselves to get food and water to those in need but who also put themselves at risk to deliver their loads?\nScott: I worry about truck drivers every day. Because it\u2019s not like it was when I started. I\u2019ve been doing this for 37 years. When I started, people were courteous to one another. Today, they don\u2019t care about other drivers. They just care about themselves.\u00a0\n\nHave the distribution centers been cool with you guys? Are they working with you to come up with new protocols that help everyone?\nGurdev: No, no, no. That\u2019s the worst thing. The government or somebody has to step in to tell these people. Because they treat us like animals. They don\u2019t let us use their toilets. They may have a Porta Potty for us, somewhere. But they don\u2019t allow us in the building. And now they take their time; they don\u2019t care if you\u2019re under your hours, or whatever. They do their thing.\u00a0\n\nSonny: Some places are being real strict about it. They don\u2019t even want you in the office any more. Like they\u2019ll leave the papers in the trailer. They don\u2019t even want to touch the papers. Meanwhile, other places are like, \u201cSARS killed more people than this.\u201d [Laughs]\n\nAre you worried about the immediate future of trucking?\nScott: It\u2019s not going to stop. The trucking industry isn\u2019t going to stop. If we stopped driving, that would cause the country to go into panic and craziness. They\u2019re not gonna let that happen.\n\nHave you found that when you bring in a load from, say, Florida or Texas, where they haven\u2019t been practicing the same amount of social distancing, people worry that you might spread the virus?\nSonny: Not really. Because they need the stuff so much. When people are in need, they\u2019ll overlook a lot of things. Next year, it\u2019ll probably be a different story. It\u2019ll go back to, \u201cGo to hell, drivers!\u201d But this year, as of right now, I don\u2019t know \u2014 what little appreciation we get, that\u2019s cool.\n\nThe people you see on the road \u2014 have they been treating you with more respect?\nGurdev: The last couple of weeks? Yeah. But I wish they\u2019d do that everyday.\u00a0\n\nWesley: I\u2019ve seen kinda 50\/50. You see it on social media \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of thanks on there. But on national network TV, they don\u2019t do a lot for truck drivers. They don\u2019t think of us.\u00a0\n\nScott: I\u2019ve had more people waving at me when I drive by. I think that\u2019s part of all this, because that doesn\u2019t usually happen. Usually, it\u2019s people giving us the finger, or something. [Laughs] I think you see more of it on Facebook. More thanks. Truck driving is an honest profession, and yet, people hate us because we\u2019re big and we\u2019re slow on the road; we get in their way. But without us, this country stops. You can\u2019t name a thing that hasn\u2019t been on one of them. [He points at the yard of idling big rigs.] Well, not unless you grow it yourself. [Laughs\n\nDo you appreciate the sentiment? Do you believe it?\nSonny: I appreciate it, anytime. But I also know it\u2019s circumstantial. We\u2019re offering something you need right now, so you appreciate it. That\u2019s cool. But we offer you this when you don\u2019t need it so much, too. And in that time, it\u2019ll be back to, \u201cGo to hell!\u201d [Laughs]\n\n\nIs your family worried about you?\nWesley: Oh, of course. It\u2019s like every day with them, they worry.\n\nWhat have they been saying?\nSteve: Just be real careful. Keep my distance from people and wash my hands. I carry extra soap and water in my truck, and every time I get in or out, I wash my hands.\n\nLarry: My family worries about me getting something to eat more than anything else. Some places watch you and make sure you wash your hands. Some of us complain about that, but hey, that\u2019s just good hygiene.\u00a0\n\nScott: We don\u2019t believe in all that \u2014 we think that the news is making it bigger than it is. I just think it\u2019s a bunch of crap. I mean, it\u2019s bad and people are dying from it, but every year we get a new flu, or a different strain of some flu. This is the first time they\u2019ve gone crazy about it. And it\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nGurdev: I was just talking to my friends right now. All my family members are scared that I\u2019m going out, trying to deliver the stuff people need. Like, right now, I\u2019m going to Florida, which is locked down. So I don\u2019t know if the warehouse is going to be open, or if people are going to be working when I get there. But I feel like it\u2019s my job to deliver the groceries to the stores. If there\u2019s no workers in the warehouse, I\u2019m going to be stuck there, and I won\u2019t know for how many hours, or even how many days. But I\u2019m still trying to do my job.\u00a0\n\n\nAs far as the rates you guys are earning go, there\u2019s been talk that some drivers are getting up to 6 percent more on loads. Has that been your experience?\nGurdev: No, nothing.\n\nThere\u2019s been no offer of hazard or emergency pay?\nGurdev: No, no. Nothing.\n\nNo increased medical coverage?\nGurdev: No, nothing.",

        "text":"Why I Ride with Waymo: Xavier\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Last year, we opened up our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to all of our Waymo One riders, and Xavier is one of the people who relies on this service to get where he needs to go. He shared this video with us, and we gave him a call to learn more about how he likes the service and what it\u2019s like to ride with Waymo, solo.\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself, and how you first heard about Waymo.\n\nI\u2019m Xavier, and I live in Chandler, Arizona. I\u2019ve been riding with Waymo for around a year now and first heard about Waymo when I saw them driving around my neighborhood. I started wondering what they were and finally looked it up and saw on the website that you could sign up to ride in them.\n\nI\u2019d heard about autonomous cars before on a few tech podcasts I listen to, but I didn\u2019t know the technology was fully there yet or that there was a possibility of riding in one until I signed up. It took about a week to get accepted, and I\u2019ve been riding since.\n\nWhat do you normally use the service for?\n\nI don\u2019t own a car myself, so my primary mode of transportation is Waymo, other ride-hailing services, or the bus.\n\nI mainly use Waymo to get to and from work. I\u2019m a restaurant manager at Wendy\u2019s and don\u2019t live too far away; it\u2019s a short 10 minute ride usually. I also use it to visit my mother every once in a while.\u00a0\n\nWe bet your mom loves that! What makes you choose Waymo over some of the other modes of transportation you mentioned?\n\nWaymo generally is a nice ride, and you get a very consistent experience. The cars are always super clean and it feels futuristic, almost like you have a robot butler. You get in, press the button, and you\u2019re on your way.\n\nI compare it a lot to other ride-hailing services that aren\u2019t automated. With those, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. Sometimes the driver is having an off day, may speed, or not obey the traffic laws.\n\nWith Waymo, it picks the same route, goes the same speed, and feels more secure. I also like the fact that you get to specifically choose where it\u2019s going to pick you up and drop you off.\n\nHave your transportation habits changed at all through COVID-19?\n\nI still feel comfortable using the service. I feel as comfortable as I do going to work, which I still have to get to somehow!\n\nYou\u2019ve had the opportunity to ride a lot in our 100% fully autonomous cars with no human driver. Can you talk about what that\u2019s like? Any major differences or similarities from the experience you\u2019ve previously had with vehicle operators?\n\nEvery fully autonomous ride has been pleasant. For me personally, anytime I get in a car with a driver, Waymo or otherwise, I usually don\u2019t play my music too loud or fully relax since I\u2019m trying to consider the other person. But when I\u2019m by myself, I\u2019m more likely to change the temperature or adjust my seat and feel more at ease watching YouTube videos or listening to a podcast on my phone.\n\nI also feel more comfortable changing the destination during the trip, like if I\u2019m heading home from work and remember I need to stop by the store on the way home. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m inconveniencing anyone in fully autonomous rides.\n\nThat\u2019s awesome to hear. Any feedback you have on the overall experience?\n\nThe only flaw I\u2019ve noticed, but it\u2019s not actually a flaw, is that sometimes Waymo is overly cautious. I can\u2019t complain about that because it\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s cautious. Sometimes it will make decisions on the road, like routing, that don\u2019t make sense to me all the time, but again, I understand it\u2019s just being cautious.\n\nIn my head, all of these things are going to improve or already are.\n\nWhat do you think the potential is for fully autonomous technology, both in times like these and in the future more broadly?\n\nFor me, I don\u2019t have any doubt that autonomous cars are the way to go for the future, and if the world is just, it\u2019s going to replace people driving cars. If it\u2019s not necessary for humans to drive, why would we if it\u2019s safer for computers to drive?\n\nAnd, it\u2019s going to have a good impact on the environment because if not everyone owns a car there\u2019s going to be less cars out there because we\u2019d all be sharing them.\n\nAnything else you want to share about your experience?\n\nI definitely recommend that people try it! It\u2019s really fun and you feel like you\u2019re part of the future.\n\nRead More",

        "text":"\n\nPotholes in Edinburgh are a big concern for many.\nPotholes in Edinburgh are a big concern for many.\nHave your say\n\nTHE man in charge of fixing Edinburgh\u2019s potholed roads says the city is \u201cgetting better\u201d at dealing with the problems caused by wear and tear on our busy streets.\n\nDespite widespread complaints about the vast number of holes in the roads, the city\u2019s \u201cpothole tsar\u201d Gareth Barwell insists progress is being made in handling problems that are on the rise across the whole country. Where the Capital needs to improve, he says, is \u201ctransparency and openness\u201d over the closure of certain roads and informing locals over a timeframe for their repair, both areas he was hoping to improve as the council embarks on its latest stage of road improvements.\n\nUp to 24 per cent of A-roads managed by City of Edinburgh Council fell into the \u201cred or amber\u201d category for repairs \u2013 around 19 miles of road network managed by the local \u2028authority \u2013 according to the latest data.\n\nIn addition, a further 20 per cent of B-roads and just over 25 per cent of C-roads were found to contain serious surface defects.\n\nBetween December and February, transport chiefs fielded more than 4,000 reports of potholes on city streets, including 251 they say \u201cwould cause damage to tyres or pose danger to cyclists\u201d.\n\nThe Evening News reported in February a backlog of more than 1,500 road defects were waiting to be filled, with an additional 75 potholes reported to the authority every day.\n\nHowever, transport and environment convener, councillor Lesley Macinnes, committed an extra \u00a31 million investment in road and street lighting improvements in the council\u2019s latest budget in \u2028February.\n\nAnd Mr Barwell, whose role as head of place management also covers litter and waste management, said the authority is improving its system of reporting and dealing with road defects.\n\nQ In December 2017, an Evening News survey found the top level of dissatisfaction among readers with council operated services included litter, waste management and potholes. As all three come under your remit, do you find that concerning?\n\nA \u201cOf course it is concerning, we have to balance all those things. I know one of the criticisms we have had is that we are not as open about why certain roads are being resurfaced or why certain areas have been closed for a certain period of time.\n\n\u201cI genuinely think that, through the improvement plan that we\u2019ve got, we will get better at this, but the communication aspect of it, how accessible we are, how transparent we are; that is what we need to improve on.\u201d\n\nQ What is being done to improve the quality of road surfaces in Edinburgh?\n\nA \u201cThe pothole problem \u2013 while we are ultimately responsible for maintaining and operating the road network \u2013 doesn\u2019t lie just with the council. It\u2019s trying to join up all the different utilities who are responsible for that repair to do it properly, that then lessens the likelihood over time of that pothole happening, the cost to put that right, cost of an injury to somebody, the cost of congestion are all determinant of everybody doing that as well as they can.\n\n\u201cWe have been open in the roads improvement plan that the council has done too many temporary repairs \u2013 so that bit of sticky plaster we were putting over the pothole \u2013 and that was really because we were finding more category one defects.\n\n\u201cInstead of whacking some tarmac on top of it and rolling it, that lasts for days, weeks, months, but that\u2019s what we know annoys residents. They think \u2018I\u2019ll take a little bit of disruption if I know that is going to get fixed\u2019.\u201d\n\nQ How will the extra investment in road repairs be spent by your department?\n\nA \u201cWe\u2019ve got significantly more resource out treating the potholes. This is not a problem that is unique to Edinburgh and one of the problems we have is that Edinburgh is such a vibrant and successful city which makes it fundamentally harder to shut a road to fix it.\n\n\u201cWhen we juggle the priorities that Edinburgh has as a capital city, major sporting events, being a festival city, hold up business, those challenges face us. But that is the same in London Boroughs, in Manchester, in Leeds, even in Glasgow \u2013 what we are doing through our roads improvement plan is learning from other cities and how they do that.\u201d\n\nQ City of Edinburgh Council paid out over \u00a310,000 in compensation for road defects last \u2028year, what is being done to drive down that amount over the next 12 months?\n\nA \u201cThe claims issue is highlighted in the roads improvement plan and has informed us on what streets are a priority. Safety inspections and claims handling was one of the big areas that we need to improve on.\n\n\u201cWe value every user of the road equally, contrary to popular opinion, whether you are a pedestrian, on a bike, in a car, on a bus. What we need to do is from boundary line to boundary line make sure that transport infrastructure is maintained safely for all those people.\u201d\n\nQ How does your department determine which areas are top priority for resurfacing works?\n\nA \u201cThere are some roads where it will be a case of determining structural integrity, there will be road safety arguments, its impact on surrounding services so whether that is doctor\u2019s surgeries, schools and then there\u2019s also a test we have to apply where we have to know if we are going to be doing schemes in the surrounding area, that would be a waste of cash if we do the repair and then 12 months later come in and rip it all up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a vehicle driving Edinburgh\u2019s road network with a laser bar underneath it, measuring how pitted the surface is, any depressions in the surface and an overall value for that asset - that basically tells us if it is value for money to rip up the surface and replace it.\u201d\n\nQ Where are the areas you have identified as being at serious risk of road defects?\n\nA \u201cA prime example right now would probably be the around the Scottish Water works at Haymarket, near Eglinton, Palmerston, in those areas. We know fine well that is an area where residents will be frustrated with. A lot of heavy vehicles have come around, but we are already working with Scottish Water to say \u2018right, as soon as the diversion is off, you are going to give us some cash and we are going to go in and make those routes safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure residents could point to examples in the past where we haven\u2019t gone in and done that but that is why our roads improvement plan has been put in place to let them know we have listened to their concerns and we are making those changes.\u201d\n\nQ How do you feel the city\u2019s road network coped during the \u2018beast from the east\u2019?\n\nA \u201cI think in what was a very challenging situation, probably a one in eight to ten year event, we did as well as we could have hoped. In fairness, that wasn\u2019t just because of the council\u2019s work, that was because of partners and members of the community as well.\n\n\u201cWhat we found in the middle of the Beast from the East was that everybody was willing to chip in in a kind of abnormal situation and we needed to get on top of it. All in all, I think the city managed well and recovered well and we kept the city moving.\u201d",

We hold regular meetings on\u00a0the\u00a0individual industries, but the\u00a0crucial part is that all of\u00a0our plans and\u00a0projects are implemented on\u00a0time and\u00a0in\u00a0full.\n\nThis is what I\u00a0have in\u00a0mind. On\u00a0May\u00a011, after a\u00a0serious discussion with the\u00a0Government and\u00a0the\u00a0Executive Office, I\u00a0proposed a\u00a0set of\u00a0measures to\u00a0support the\u00a0people and\u00a0businesses. On\u00a0the\u00a0next day, over a\u00a0million requests had been posted on\u00a0the\u00a0Public Services Portal by\u00a0those who hope to\u00a0receive the\u00a0one-time assistance of\u00a010,000 rubles per child aged through 15 years. Then the\u00a0portal crashed. I\u00a0know that our colleagues from the\u00a0Communications Ministry have now repaired it, but I\u00a0would like you to\u00a0take notice of\u00a0this, as\u00a0well as\u00a0of\u00a0other such similar matters.\n\nEven during these difficult times\u00a0\u2013 it is also difficult for\u00a0the\u00a0budget, because budget revenue has decreased considerably due to\u00a0the\u00a0falling prices of\u00a0our traditional products, that is, oil and\u00a0energy\u00a0\u2013 we nevertheless found the\u00a0means to\u00a0support our people, the\u00a0economy in\u00a0general, as\u00a0well as\u00a0individual industries and\u00a0companies. Once we started doing this, we must carry it through, for\u00a0otherwise we will not achieve the\u00a0result that we want and\u00a0that the\u00a0people expect us to\u00a0achieve.\n\nThis also concerns, as\u00a0I\u00a0mentioned last time we met, additional payments to\u00a0our medical personnel. As\u00a0I\u00a0said on\u00a0May\u00a011, regrettably, these payments have been made in\u00a0far from all of\u00a0the\u00a0regions. As\u00a0of\u00a0now, only two or\u00a0three regions have not made these payments. We only had to\u00a0point at\u00a0the\u00a0drawback, and\u00a0it was immediately remedied. Why cannot we do everything properly from the\u00a0very start?\n\nI\u00a0am asking you to\u00a0pay more attention to\u00a0performance standards.\n\nAs\u00a0I\u00a0have already mentioned, we regularly hold industry meetings to\u00a0support the\u00a0economy and\u00a0jobs, employment and\u00a0the\u00a0incomes of\u00a0citizens. Today, as\u00a0agreed, we will discuss the\u00a0airline industry. Together with business representatives, we will consider the\u00a0current state and\u00a0development tasks of\u00a0domestic airlines, airports, as\u00a0well as\u00a0aircraft manufacturing enterprises.\n\nAs\u00a0I\u00a0have already noted, due to\u00a0the\u00a0coronavirus epidemic, air traffic\u00a0\u2013 both in\u00a0our country and\u00a0abroad\u00a0\u2013 is facing forced restrictions. Perhaps the\u00a0most serious decline among all types of\u00a0transport occurred in\u00a0aviation. The\u00a0numbers of\u00a0users on\u00a0domestic flights decreased significantly, by\u00a088 percent. International air traffic has almost stopped: there is a\u00a0reduction of\u00a0more than 90 percent. The\u00a0number of\u00a0passengers at\u00a0Russian airports has dropped to\u00a0a\u00a0minimum.\n\nCompanies, airports are losing revenue, which certainly affects their financial situation and, most importantly, their employees and\u00a0the\u00a0well-being of\u00a0people involved in\u00a0air transportation.\n\nLet me remind you that we have already decided to\u00a0allocate emergency assistance\u00a0\u2013 over 23 billion rubles\u00a0\u2013 to\u00a0Russian airlines so that they can pay salaries to\u00a0crews, personnel, airport services, leasing expenses and\u00a0other purposes and\u00a0thereby ensure the\u00a0stability of\u00a0enterprises.\n\nI\u00a0would like to\u00a0ask business representatives today to\u00a0tell us how this work is being organised and\u00a0whether all the\u00a0issues have been resolved. Although I\u00a0do know that not all the\u00a0issues have been resolved, and\u00a0in\u00a0fact, the\u00a0organisation of\u00a0this work within the\u00a0allocated funds requires more serious consideration. Let us talk about this today. Let us talk about how effective and\u00a0sufficient the\u00a0incoming support is.\n\nI\u00a0would also like to\u00a0note that last week, following a\u00a0meeting on\u00a0transport, I\u00a0gave instructions to\u00a0especially support airports during the\u00a0epidemic, to\u00a0allocate federal funds\u00a0\u2013 almost 11 billion rubles\u00a0\u2013 for\u00a0their urgent needs. I\u00a0would like to\u00a0ask the\u00a0heads of\u00a0the\u00a0federal departments to\u00a0report on\u00a0how the\u00a0decisions made are being implemented.\n\nLet me emphasise that our common task is to\u00a0provide for\u00a0reliable, high quality and\u00a0safe airline service in\u00a0Russia. Meanwhile, it is important for\u00a0the\u00a0industry to\u00a0see the\u00a0prospects of\u00a0its development and\u00a0further growth. However, it is also important for\u00a0the\u00a0Government to\u00a0understand these prospects. I\u00a0think that any of\u00a0our actions to\u00a0support this or\u00a0that sector should proceed from a\u00a0clear long-term model of\u00a0its operation. I\u00a0am asking the\u00a0Minister of\u00a0Transport to\u00a0tell us today which structural changes in\u00a0the\u00a0industry are expected in\u00a0the\u00a0years to\u00a0come and\u00a0what the\u00a0Government is going to\u00a0do in\u00a0this respect.\n\nWe are talking not only about major aviation. I\u00a0suggest talking about small, specialised, sanitary aviation operating in\u00a0remote areas where it, in\u00a0fact, has no alternative.\n\nAnd, of\u00a0course, in\u00a0the\u00a0current circumstances it is necessary to\u00a0support the\u00a0foundation of\u00a0the\u00a0industry, namely the\u00a0aircraft-building enterprises, and\u00a0give work to\u00a0those complex and, in\u00a0many ways, unique production facilities.\n\nRussia is, by\u00a0the\u00a0way, among the\u00a0few countries that can produce the\u00a0entire range of\u00a0military and\u00a0civil planes and\u00a0helicopters. It is a\u00a0huge competitive edge and\u00a0an\u00a0embodiment of\u00a0our industrial, economic, scientific and\u00a0educational potential.\n\nRussia-made aircraft can compete in\u00a0many specifications on\u00a0equal terms with their foreign counterparts and\u00a0global market leaders and, by\u00a0the\u00a0way, speaking of\u00a0combat aircraft, largely surpass them.\n\nIn\u00a0addition, the\u00a0capacity of\u00a0the\u00a0Russian aircraft industry makes it possible to\u00a0work on\u00a0new and\u00a0promising models. Above all, I\u00a0mean the\u00a0MS-21 medium-range civil airliner that is being tested. I\u00a0believe, it has already made over 300 flights, which is a\u00a0third of\u00a0the\u00a0required number.\n\nI\u00a0have already said that it is a\u00a0matter of\u00a0principle to\u00a0provide our aircraft plants with orders and\u00a0raise the\u00a0demand for\u00a0Russia-made aircraft. It will encourage the\u00a0creation of\u00a0jobs, the\u00a0upgrade of\u00a0production facilities and\u00a0the\u00a0development of\u00a0new aircraft models.\n\nI\u00a0believe that the\u00a0right thing to\u00a0do would be to\u00a0take the\u00a0following decisions in\u00a0this regard:\n\nFirst, we need to\u00a0launch a\u00a0support programme for\u00a0the\u00a0leasing and\u00a0operation of\u00a0Russian aircraft. To\u00a0this end, I\u00a0propose offering leasing companies state guarantees in\u00a02020\u20132021, as\u00a0well as\u00a0subsidies in\u00a0order to\u00a0reduce the\u00a0per-hour flying cost for\u00a0Russian aircraft. According to\u00a0our estimates, this programme will enable Russian plants to\u00a0manufacture 59 new civilian aircraft in\u00a0the\u00a0first two years alone.\n\nAt\u00a0the\u00a0same time, we need to\u00a0simplify and\u00a0streamline these leasing subsidies for\u00a0carriers and\u00a0aircraft manufacturers, including by\u00a0directly linking the\u00a0purchase of\u00a0a\u00a0specific aircraft to\u00a0receiving the\u00a0subsidy. In\u00a0other words, the\u00a0money will follow the\u00a0aircraft.\n\nSecond. We are paying a\u00a0great deal of\u00a0attention to\u00a0developing regional air services by\u00a0subsidising direct region-to-region flights bypassing the\u00a0Moscow Aviation Hub. We are doing this primarily in\u00a0the\u00a0interests of\u00a0the\u00a0people, the\u00a0passengers, since non-stop flights are much more convenient and\u00a0of\u00a0course cheaper.\n\nEvery year, the\u00a0government earmarks about 8 billion rubles from the\u00a0federal budget to\u00a0this effect, and\u00a0regions chip in\u00a0as\u00a0well. However, the\u00a0demand for\u00a0subsidies largely exceeds the\u00a0allocated funds.\n\nWe need to\u00a0consider the\u00a0possibility of\u00a0expanding this programme. In\u00a0addition, we need to\u00a0fine-tune this mechanism in\u00a0order to\u00a0prioritise destinations operating Russian aircraft.\n\nI\u00a0would also like to\u00a0remind you about the\u00a0decision adopted in\u00a0December 2019 when I\u00a0asked you to\u00a0draft proposals on\u00a0creating a\u00a0dedicated airline operating a\u00a0fleet of\u00a0Russian-made passenger and\u00a0cargo aircraft in\u00a0Russia\u2019s Far East, including hard-to-reach territories. I\u00a0would like to\u00a0hear a\u00a0progress report on\u00a0this instruction.\n\nThird. The\u00a0state will have to\u00a0place more orders to\u00a0support demand. This is a\u00a0universal and\u00a0effective approach that we use to\u00a0support automobile manufacturers, other industrial sectors, as\u00a0well as\u00a0infrastructure construction. Of\u00a0course, for\u00a0the\u00a0aviation industry this could be even more relevant than for\u00a0any other sector.\n\nWe have planned to\u00a0purchase aircraft as\u00a0part of\u00a0the\u00a0national projects and\u00a0state programmes. I\u00a0propose fast-forwarding these transactions in\u00a0order to\u00a0give work to\u00a0our manufacturers right now, when they are going through a\u00a0challenging period. I\u00a0am referring, among other things to\u00a0the\u00a0purchase of\u00a066 helicopt... (truncated)",

I am a freelance photographer and cinematographer with a passion for the beauty of cars. I'm a Lincoln tech honors graduate as a certified auto technician. So not only do I take pictures of cars I can also fix and mod them. That\u2019s what sets us tuner photographers apart from the rest. We know what we are taking pictures of; the year, make, model, rarity or uniqueness of every car, part or modification. I love what I do and take pride in my work and never slack or cut corners in anything I do.

While I was going to school I was customizing and modifying my 2007 TL Type S. By the time I was graduating I was pretty much done. After that I started hitting up all the car shows, car meets, street races etc. Then I got discouraged because not all the top photographers were taking pics of my car at the top shows. Then It hit me, after that I saved for my first camera and started taking my own pics of my car and flooded the internet with them. I was shocked about the impact\/popularity my photos made online, So I went back to school, made my own website, and kept with doing private shoots with other cars covering car shows, street races etc. I gained my respect not only online but also on the street as a photographer\/car tuner and enthusiast. And now people call me a pro photographer. I love it! But unfortunately i had to pay 28k in school tuition to become an auto technician to later find my calling as a photographer and cinematographer. But, i have no regrets, because I found a profession that i love to do, and not everybody can say that.\n\nPhotographer Spotlight: Nicki Cruz Photographer Spotlight: Nicki Cruz\n\nHow long have you been a photographer for?\n5 years\n\nHow would you describe your style?\nI describe my style as raw & uncut, a journey into my head that allows people to see my view of things from my third eye.\n\nWhat equipment do you use?\nCanon dslr's:\nCanon EOS 550D\n\nWhat is your favourite location to shoot pictures?\nBesides a studio or indoor set for a car, I love to shoot in the city at night with all the pretty bright lights and all the different things going on.\n\nPhotographer Spotlight: Nicki Cruz Photographer Spotlight: Nicki Cruz\n\nAre you a Mac or PC user?\nI use both. I edit my photos and handle all my online stuff on my pc and edit my videos on the mac.\n\nWhat was your most memorable assignment?\nCovering \"hella flush\" in Hawaii back in 2011.\n\nWhat would you say to other enthusiast photographers out there who aspire to become a photographer?\nKeep it up until you reach your goal.

        "text":"Simply Bunk Confessions of a shore-based cab driver\n\n\u201cI have a guy for your house,\u201d my old buddy Jake said out of the blue.\n\n\u201cYour timing is excellent, Smithers,\u201d I responded in my bad imitation of Mr. Burns. \u201cWho is this fellow?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis name is Bunk and he would fit in well with your crew,\u201d Jake said. \u201cPlay and knows sports, cooks, and will drive you wherever you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a butler. Shouldn\u2019t his name be Cheeves?\u201d I shot back but quickly thought, \u201cWell, then again, Bunk does have a, \u2018Your bath is ready, sir\u2019 sound to it\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHis real name is Bernie and he\u2019s a van driver for a cab service down at the beach,\u201d Jake explained. \u201cMakes good money doing it too\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the movie Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2026gotcha. So when does he have time to go out?\u201d as my mind was jolted from its one-dimensional state regarding summer weekends.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Jake stated without ambiguity. \u201cHe works every weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when the summer ends?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHe runs a pizza place at UConn and a ski house like a bed and breakfast in Mount Snow on the winter weekends. He\u2019s basically his own boss and comes and goes as he pleases.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s genius,\u201d I marveled. \u201cOK, he\u2019s in.\u201d\n\nThat conversation took place over two years ago. In 2007, Bunk is a central part of my beach empire\u2026driving members for food at 3:30 AM and more importantly, picking them up to go to and from bar to bar. He also contributes waffles in the morning, organizes a intra-house Olympics with events that include archery, tug-of-war and kiddie-bike-slalom-beer racing (See: Revenge of the Nerds I), and owns every college pennant in the universe, which are hung up in the beach house according to who went where during their undergrad days (a bit hokey, but it actually makes an otherwise listless living room portray a sports bar\u2026and where else will you find a U Penn and a Willie P U. pennant side-by-side?).\n\nI recently interviewed Bunk\u2014who incidentially doesn\u2019t drink due to being allergic to alcohol\u2014during an early morning run to 1st Ave. Pizza while watching Hoosiers on his in-cab DVD screen.\n\nConcha: What first got you into driving a van at the beach?\n\nBunk: I needed a job that coincided with my party animal shore housemates and the hours they kept. The cab was the perfect fit. It also enabled me to still be a part of the whole scene.\n\nConcha: What kind of money can you make on a good night?\n\nBunk: I do OK, I\u2019d rather not give you a number, but I have to hustle and put up with a lot of crap.\n\nConcha: I guess if I asked any guy or girl in the house what kind of cash they brought home, I\u2019d get the same answer. Well played. Still, at $4.00-$6.00 per person and sometimes 20 to a ride that may only be a mile or three, sounds like the money can add up quickly.\n\nOK, a less-intrusive question: What are your hours?\n\nBunk: I start at 4pm unless someone pre-arranges an earlier pick up. I can get home anywhere between 3am and 5am.\n\nConcha: What are some of the drawbacks of the job?\n\nBunk: I\u2019ve had people fight in the van, throw up, relieve themselves, and always throw in the usual Jagoff who thinks it\u2019s cool to give the driver a hard time.\n\nConcha: With all of the alcohol and beer muscles involved that usually is a staple of the aforementioned Jagoff, how do you handle security within the van?\n\nBunk: You try to keep them happy and stuff like that won\u2019t happen. I also try to be selective when picking up a group. You can tell a certain group will be trouble so I would stay away from them. You\u2019re usually safe taking groups of girls. Though the craziest brawl in my van was between girls. It wasn\u2019t a hair pulling cat fight, this was a NHL bench-clearing brawl! Clean, hard punches to the face. It took me and two other guys to pull these chicks apart.\n\nConcha: What does your service provide that other cab companies don\u2019t?\n\nBunk: It has been my experience that if I can make the customers transition from their house to the bar a smooth one the ride is much more fun for them and less stressful for me. I find that a good CD with music for all tastes can make a huge difference and one less thing to give me a hard time about. I am also courteous to my passengers and open the door for them when they get in and get out.\n\nConcha: Not many, if any, cab companies down there extend that courtesy. Well, I\u2019ve seen some\u2014and admittedly participated in\u2014some crazy stuff while in a beach cab in the past, so share two of your best stories from driving down there\u2026\n\nBunk: Last summer I drove 12 huge guidos from Belmar to Seaside. They were completely obnoxious the entire 45-minute ride. But the funny part was that they spent most of the trip arguing about what the appropriate time to take their shirts off would be. As we were blocks away someone saw two gigantic dudes walking toward the bar without their shirts. At that point someone in the van says, \u201cYo Sal, I told you we was good\u2026 I\u2019m taking off my freakin\u2019 shirt!\u201d\n\nThen there was the time a few years ago I picked up three girls and one guy at the Parker House. Impressively, in the short drive from Parker to Leggett\u2019s the guy up front talked his girlfriend and two friends into kissing and stripping in my cab! It was strange to say the least\u2026\n\nConcha: Hooking up and being at the shore are almost synomyous\u2026does this process first begin in your van often?\n\nBunk: Most times a hook up has been pre-determined prior to entering the van. I have seen some crazy things happen though. I watched a guy who was loading his group into the van at DJ\u2019s late one Saturday night start talking to a girl who was passing by and somehow within minutes convinced her to go home with him. Amazing\u2026 I also had a couple of 17 year olds doing some pretty unbelievable things in my van and they had just met as well.\n\nConcha: Only at the shore do you see that sort of thing. I\u2019ve never experienced that kind of cab ride in Hoboken. But those anecdotes are usually a product of the busy times. What do shore cab drivers do during the week when things are slow at the beach?\n\nBunk: Sit in their vans and go out of their minds with boredom! Back in the day when I would drive during the week their were a few nights like Monday (Boat House) and Tuesday (Bar A) that you would basically be a shuttle to and from the bar which was easy. Other than that I was carting around drunk teenagers from party to party.\n\nConcha: Do people treat nickels like manhole covers or does being drunk mean being generous? What is the average tip?\n\nBunk: $1 per person\u2026 Some people give more and then there are some that won\u2019t give you anything. I can understand, when I used to go out I would walk from PH to Edgars. Whatever it costs, it\u2019s a lot less than a DWI. I can\u2019t tell you how many DWI\u2019s I\u2019ve seen in the six years I\u2019ve been doing this.\n\nConcha: Speaking of DWI, how does local law enforcement treat you and other cab\/van companies down there in general?\n\nBunk: In the early years it seemed like I could get away with pretty much anything except vehicular manslaughter. The thinking was, we were helping them get drunks off the street and making their jobs easier. Since 2005 it\u2019s gotten pretty tough. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because back then there were only a few cab companies and now there are more like 20. Point Pleasant and Belmar are the toughest. Just this past weekend the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commision decided to enforce the taxi stand rules. Most of the larger vans have limo plates and are not allowed to park in the taxi stands. By chasing all the large vans the end of the night at bar closing was a disaster. It got to the point that the Manasquan police were calling my boss and asking him to send his vans to the beach front. Of course, this all could have been avoided, but balls need to be broken I guess?\n\nConcha: Are there rivalries among the cab services at the shore?\n\nBunk: There are some rivalries amongst companies, but drivers all pretty much get along. Nobody likes Able or the gypsies. Able has a new owner who thinks he should have a monopoly, and the gypsies make it hard on the rest of us because they overcharge people and take advantage of drunk people.\n\nConcha: Do you see yourself doing this five or ten years from now?\n\nBunk: You know what, I keep saying maybe this will be my last summer\u2026 But, then I make some money and have fun with my friends in my shore house. If I wasn\u2019t working I wouldn\u2019t be in the house. Maybe if I was involved with someone it would be a different story. As long as it\u2019s still fun I\u2019ll keep doing it!",
