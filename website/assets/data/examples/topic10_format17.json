Answered on 27th February 2012\n\nFull question\n\nDear Nigella, first of all congratulations for your books! I am Italian and have some of your books in Italian and also in English. I like the way you talk the reader through your recipes and I have tried some of them and always had great success with family & friends! However in Italy it is not possible to buy the vanilla extract that you usually use in your recipes; you can only find the chemical vanilla powder (called \"VANILLINA\") but it is really unhealthy and \"depressing\" to use! You can find vanilla pods but they are quite expensive that's why I'd like to know if you can suggest anywhere where I can buy a bottle of vanilla extract? Thank you very much and all the best from Italy! Debora\n\nOur answer\n\nMost bakers prefer to use a natural vanilla extract and there are several British companies that sell vanilla extract on-line (usually Dr Oetker or Nielsen-Massey brands) and will ship to Italy. We have given some links below as examples and you should find other suppliers on-line. It is also worth checking for vanilla extract on Amazon.\n\nAlthough vanilla pods (vanilla beans) are expensive you can make them last longer by making your own vanilla sugar or vanilla extract. Split 3 vanilla pods lengthways and put them in a large jar then add 500g caster sugar (2 1\/2 cups superfine sugar). Seal and leave in a cool, dry, dark place for a month then shake the jar and use the sugar in your baking recipes and top the sugar up each time that you use it. The sugar will be perfumed by the vanilla pods and the vanilla pods should last for a couple of years (or longer, depending on how frequently you use the sugar and the storage conditions).\n\nFor vanilla extract split 3 vanilla pods and put them in a clean jar then add 250ml (1 cup) vodka. Seal and leave in a cool, dark place for 2 months, giving the jar the occasional shake. The vodka will turn brown as the vanilla infuses into it. You can use this home-made vanilla extract in the same quantity as a store-bought one and the jar can be topped up with 125ml (1\/2 cup) vodka once half of the home-made extract has been used (let it infuse again for a couple of weeks before using). You can add a little sugar to the extract if you like (as most commercial brands are slightly sweetened) though for most baking recipes this is unlikely to be necessary. However do be careful about using this extract for anyone who is not allowed to consume alcohol.\n\nTell us what you think",

When I thaw them out, they are sometimes glued together and impossible to separate without making holes in them. Is this preventable? Is there a way to unstick them? If I can't freeze them, how long will tortillas keep in the fridge?\nposted by Could it be, El Guapo ... to Food & Drink (13 answers total)\nput plastic wrap between the tortillas before you freeze them.\nposted by signal at 5:19 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nPlastic wrap sounds like a lot of buggering around, IMO.\n\nThe tortillas we purchase come in a heavy-duty ziploc pouch. We toss them immediately into the freezer when we get home from shopping, and they are placed as flat as possible. When we use them, we have them out of the freezer for however long it takes to peel them carefully apart and warm them in the frypan. Then we fire them back into the fridge.\n\nThey seldom stick so badly as to tear. They do sometimes stick enough that they need a minute in the pan to warm them up to the point where they'll peel apart.\n\nThe trick, IMO, is that they need to be kept from becoming moist. That means freezing them quick, and not leaving them out when you're using them.\n\nposted by five fresh fish at 5:35 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nBest answer: How long does it take you to use them? I find the only thing that keeps them from doing this is to keep them at room temperature. They last much longer than you'd think. And I've tried a wide variety of brands. I keep them around for two or three weeks and have never seen a speck of mold and have never noticed any changes in taste.\nposted by miniape at 5:50 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nUse waxed paper between each one - take them out of the bag, tear several pieces of waxed paper, re-stack, rebag in a freezer bag, and don't set anything on top of them. Also if you use a microwave to unthaw them, they are much more likely to stick - use a pan or just sit them out for a while.\n\nBut I keep flour tortilla in the baggie, in the veggie\/fruit compartment of my fridge and they last at least a weeks.\nposted by LadyBonita at 6:04 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nI have exactly the same problem, and I put some greaseproof paper between them once I've opened the packet.\n\nWe'd use two from a pack of 6 or 10 a week, so they've got to go in the freezer.\n\nI don't have enough time to let them defrost when I get home from work, and I cant microwave them all together, that doesn't work, so I have to use paper.\n\nThere's one brand in my supermarket that puts bits of paper between the tortillas, but unfortunately they're only an intermittent supplier.\nposted by wilful at 6:07 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nI keep mine in the freezer as well, I like to have them around, but only go through a package a month.\n\nI put a piece of parchment paper between every two tortillas, because I almost always eat them in pairs, and putting the two stuck together ones on the frying pan causes them to unstick.\n\nI avoid wax paper, I find it tends to leave bits of wax on frozen stuff. I'm not big on eating candles.\nposted by Marky at 6:25 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nUnless you either a) put some kind of paper between them (I dunno what you'd call it...when I worked at a pizza joint, all our dough had paper between each piece of dough and there was no problem after being frozen. I know it wasn't wax paper) or b) warm up the entire stack (microwave works) and then refreeze them (once again, the place I worked at had a tortilla station...if they were frozen, we ran into your problem so we just nuked em' till they were a little bit warm and problem solved).\nposted by jmd82 at 6:38 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nThirding (fourthing? I lost track) the wax paper. This is what wax paper is for!\nposted by mendel at 6:42 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nWax Paper.\nposted by dobbs at 6:48 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nI keep corn tortillas in the freezer. The trick to not having these stick is to separate them with a knife blade immediately after removing them from the freezer. Just slide the blade into a crevice between the top and the second tortilla, give a slight twist, and pop! Off they come one by one. This must be done before they start to thaw, or they do stick. So separate first, thaw after.\n\nI've never tried it with flour tortillas. They're gummier in general, so I'm not sure my strategy will work. WOrth a try, though.\nposted by Miko at 7:15 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nBest answer: I think sometimes the tortillas are stuck together when you buy them. Freezing doesn't seem to have an effect on that. I pick through the packages at the store to find ones that don't seem to be stuck together. You can tell by bending the package around whether they're sticky. Also, drier, thinner brands of tortillas stick less than the fluffy, thicker ones.\nposted by donnagirl at 7:25 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nIt may also help to store them vertically when they're frozen, rather than horizontally. I don't generally have any problem with them sticking, and I don't stick anything between them.\nposted by NYCnosh at 8:57 PM on August 18, 2005\n\nBest answer: Just leave 'em at room temperature. Unless a stray mold spore gets in, they'll keep for weeks.\nposted by ikkyu2 at 11:16 PM on August 18, 2005\n\n\u00ab Older Transfer: PC to Mac \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Grand camping?

But hulling by cutting a cone out of the top of the berry with a paring knife can be slow work. How can I quickly remove the core (the hard white part near the stem) from the strawberry?\n\nWhat do professional chefs and kitchens do to quickly hull strawberries?\n\nshare|improve this question\nI don't know what professionals do but if I am going to slice the strawberries anyway then I slice them in half and take the hull out of each side as a quick triangular cut. \u2013\u00a0 Sobachatina May 15 '12 at 16:59\nWhy do you remove the center? I eat it. If the strawberry is terribly unripe, then I cut off the whole top up to the place where it turns pink, but leave the lower part of the core inside. \u2013\u00a0 rumtscho May 15 '12 at 17:14\nGo to Amazon and search for \"strawberry tool\". There are several for under $10. \u2013\u00a0 Cos Callis May 15 '12 at 17:55\n@rumtscho: On occasion I've purchased huge mutant strawberries where the green\/white \"stem\" goes all the way down to the center; they were very difficult to hull properly, maybe that's what Katie has. \u2013\u00a0 Aaronut May 15 '12 at 18:14\nGenerally I get \"Hood\" strawberries (from Oregon or Washington), which are softer, juicier, and have a shorter lifespan than the more common California berries. The white core of strawberries has a different (undesirable) texture and taste. \u2013\u00a0 KatieK May 15 '12 at 18:51\n\n7 Answers 7\n\nup vote 8 down vote accepted\n\nI don't usually hull strawberries, but when I do I use a straw. The idea is that you push the straw up through the tip of the strawberry and it comes out at the stem. For pictures you can see http:\/\/amy-newnostalgia.blogspot.com\/2010\/06\/hulling-strawberries-with-straw.html are just Google \"hull strawberries with a straw\"\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThat is ingenious. Is it fast? \u2013\u00a0 Cerberus May 15 '12 at 19:06\nI think so - but I haven't used a \"strawberry tool\" so I don't have much to compare it to. For me it's faster than trying to use a paring knife to carve out the stem and it takes less skill then using the spoon technique (plus I've had the spoon mangle berries that were very ripe). \u2013\u00a0 djmadscribbler May 15 '12 at 19:09\nPerhaps that's where their name comes from! \u2013\u00a0 Mien May 16 '12 at 13:56\n\nI always use a teaspoon to scoop out the green. Going any deeper than 5 mm is unnecessary anyway (it's only the green and the little stalk that are unpleasant), but you can go as deep as you like. It is fast and it works perfectly. You press the spoon's edge into your thumb, so to speak, with the strawberry in between. You can easily continue to hold it in the right position in your right hand while you pick up new strawberries with your left hand. When I found this out years ago, I couldn't understand why the whole world wasn't using this, just as with grating garlic. The only thing quicker than a teaspoon would be a teaspoon with thinner (= sharper) edges.\n\nenter image description here\n\nenter image description here\n\nPictures from Thepioneerwoman.com\n\nshare|improve this answer\nDoesn't a spoon destroy the berries, rather than cut? Perhaps you and Ree Drummond have sturdier strawberries than I do... \u2013\u00a0 KatieK May 15 '12 at 18:57\n@KatieK: No? They become more or less as in the picture. I guess if they're extremely ripe it becomes hard (then I would personally not like them anyway). \u2013\u00a0 Cerberus May 15 '12 at 19:05\nI think a lot depends on the edge thickness and the ripeness of the berries. Personally I have mangled quite a few berries using this technique because the spoon edge wasn't sharp enough and just deformed the berry. \u2013\u00a0 djmadscribbler May 15 '12 at 22:22\n@djmadscribbler: I don't know...I have used this method exclusively with strawberries for years, and never a problem. I wouldn't use it with other berries, probably. \u2013\u00a0 Cerberus May 15 '12 at 22:37\nI'm guessing the thickness of the spoon's bowl will be a factor -- I have a bunch of different spoons, and I'm guessing the thicker ones wouldn't be useful ... but I'd be inclined to use a grapefruit spoon (as I have one). \u2013\u00a0 Joe May 16 '12 at 23:01\n\nAlton Brown recommends a star-shaped tip from a pastry piping bag.

All of Hershey\u2019s iconic candies \u2013 including the Hershey Bar, Kisses, and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups \u2013 contain dairy, but the company does have one vegan option.

For example: you may be able to have milk in your tea or coffee, but not on your cereal. some products containing milk, such as milk chocolate, may still be acceptable in small quantities.\n\nWhat type of chocolate can vegans eat?\n\nHigh-quality dark chocolate is a great option for vegans. Look for chocolate with a cacao content of 50% or more. The higher cacao percentage indicates a higher chocolate content.\n\nWhy is vegan chocolate so expensive?\n\nDespite there being no trace of animal products in the ingredients, some bars might not be labelled \u2018vegan\u2019. \u2026 We should point out that some of the more expensive vegan chocolate is priced that way because they\u2019re much smaller operations than say, Cadbury, and use higher quality ingredients.",

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nSeasoned Advice is a question and answer site for professional and amateur chefs. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nThis is a recipe for a dark chocolate cake. It calls for 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate. But I made a mistake and bought the 70%. The recipe also calls for 1.25 cups sugar. I don't want it to be too sweet, so by how much should I decrease the sugar?\n\nThe last time I baked this cake, I used 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate and it was perfectly dark. I want to get the same results. Help!\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nThis is a challenge because not only will the different chocolate change the sweetness of the cake slightly but it will change the texture slightly. One thing you can do is subtract the amount of sugar from the recipe that is in the chocolate. In your case 30% of the three ounces of chocolate is roughly one ounce. This should work for you.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nGood points, Questie760 - nut I'd caution that care should be taken in reducing the sugar by that much since it also plays a role in the texture of the cake. I've interchanged chocolate types in cakes before without any real detriment to the texture. I'd reference an ingredient substitution website to give myself some reassurance. \u2013\u00a0 Kristina Lopez Sep 20 '12 at 17:18\nBut, not nut! :-) \u2013\u00a0 Kristina Lopez Sep 20 '12 at 17:28\nThanks for the advice. I'm glad I didn't try to substitute it. I actually gave in and went to the store to get unsweetened chocolate. The cakes turned out beautiful. I will be stacking and frosting them tomorrow. \u2013\u00a0 Nel Sep 21 '12 at 3:51\nIs it the case that for chocolate marked with a percentage, that the remaining percentage will be all or just about all sugar? Not any other ingredients such as fats or oils or milk products? (I ask as a naive but interested chocophile.) \u2013\u00a0 hippietrail Sep 21 '12 at 7:31\nNo - the 70% figure is cocoa solids. The other 30% will be sugar, cocoa butter, possibly other fats (depending on the quality of the chocolate) - so reducing sugar by 30% of the weight of the chocolate is probably too much. \u2013\u00a0 Matthew Walton Sep 23 '12 at 18:50\n\nCocoa butter is a cocoa solid. 70% chocolate means that 30% is sugar. The 70 % is made up of cocoa and cocoa butter (and usually a bit of vanilla).\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThat's almost, but not quite correct. Vanilla would not be in the 70%, nor would lecithin (if the chocolate has any), milk or milk fat, salt, or anything else that isn't in cocao. \u2013\u00a0 Jolenealaska Dec 13 '14 at 17:52\nI too would disagree with the statement of 30% is sugar, if you've ever eaten 70% Chocolate you'd understand it certainly does not have 30% sugar content:- en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chocolate#Blending will give you a pretty good run down of the actual properties. \u2013\u00a0 Doug Dec 13 '14 at 21:49\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

(unless of course you like that sort of thing).\n\n  \u2022 Some people prefer on fattier grinds of meat for a 'juicier' meatloaf ... I personally go with 85\/15 or fattier.\n\n  \u2022 Mixing types of fat with different melting characteristics will also change the texture; for this reason, some recipes call for adding pork sausage, or a blend of ground pork, beef and veal.\n\n  \u2022 Vessel is important -- some people will cook their meatloaf in a loaf pan; personally, I like a little crust on mine, but because of the grease that comes off during baking, I use a broiler pan.\n\n  \u2022 Shape will affect the crust and cooking time -- a larger cross-section will need a longer cooking time, but the top may crust up too much; you can either tent with foil while cooking, coat with a glaze, top with bacon strips, etc.\n\n  \u2022 Mixing the meat while chilled will keep the meatloaf less dense, but allowing it to warm up before cooking will allow it to cook more evenly. (so the outside isn't overcooked while the middle's still cold; especially important if you're not going with a glaze or similar)\n\n  \u2022 Almost any vegetables can be added as a filler, if you pre-cook them to soften and remove most of their moisture so they're not overly wet. Onions, bell pepper, carrots, cellery, dark greens (spinach, chard, etc), summer squash (eg. zucchini, yellow squash) all work well.\n\n  \u2022 To speed up cooking time, or if you're living alone and know you won't eat the whole thing, consider making smaller loaves. You can even make it in a burger patty size & shape for individual servings.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nGreat answer on the meat part. Just to add, part of controlling the density is adding a starch (bread crumbs, oatmeal) which is one of the things that keeps meatloaf from being a brick and meatballs from being hockey pucks. Not a requirement certainly, but traditional and will give you some leeway, which is good for a new cook. \u2013\u00a0 Doug Johnson-Cookloose Jan 10 '11 at 15:08\n@Doug -- I made it community wiki, so feel free to add ... I've always done dry breadcrumbs (not necessarily stale, just not soaked first), so I don't know how different starches might affect things \u2013\u00a0 Joe Jan 10 '11 at 15:13\n\nI've never been unlucky enough to make a dry loaf, but I suggest finding a well-regarded recipe and following that. Beyond that: don't squish.\n\nI cook in a 12-inch cast-iron pan, with a hand-shaped loaf in the middle. This gives room for the grease to spread away from the meat without losing it altogether. The cast-iron is easy to clean. Others prefer loaf pans. I suspect that my use of the cast-iron over a loaf pan does the most towards preventing a hard and dry loaf.\n\nFinally, the recipe I have based my loaf on calls for half the dry ingredients and 1\/3rd of the egg that I use. In my case, this has not resulted in mushiness. Of course, this doesn't really make the loaf very healthy!\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nOne thing I've found that helps keep it together is something called Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP). It's a vegetarian protein substitute that comes in a dry crumble (among other forms) that works great to absorb the fats in whatever meat you use. I found about 250mL of TVP to 1L of ground meat works well.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

However, as I was reading through the recipe, I thought it called for 2 cups of sugar when it actually called for 1\/2 a cup. Of course, I didn't realize this until just after I had mixed it into the cream cheese. I hoped for a bit that it might still be salvegable as a cheesecake, but I've given up on that. However, I do think that possibly it could be a good icing that I could freeze and use later. Right now it's 1 lb of cream cheese and 2 c sugar. Can I use this as is or should I add something to it?\n\nasked by WannabeBaker almost 3 years ago\n2\u00a0answers 1511\u00a0views\nadded almost 3 years ago\n\nAdd 3 more parts cream cheese of a larger recipe and use it up as it's supposed to be\n\nadded almost 3 years ago\n\nThe ingredients for traditional cream cheese frosting:\n\n8 oz cream cheese\n1\/2 cup butter\n1 lb.

My question posted before I even had a chance to ask it - guess my computer sensed the urgency. Sorry! So - here is the burning question - think I can freeze these and then slice and bake?\n\nMerrill Stubbs\n\nMerrill is a co-founder of Food52.\n\nadded over 3 years ago\n\nI've never tried that before, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. I'd imagine the texture might be a bit different. Let me know if you try it!",

If you make it correctly, you will never want to stop eating it. Also, for the texture of the cheesecake to be right, you must cook it all the way through.\n\n    Make sure that cream cheese and eggs are at room temperature.\n\n    (very important).\n\n    Preheat oven to 350\u00c2\u00b0F-180\u00c2\u00b0C\n\n    Spray a spring form pan with a non-stick spray.\n\n    In a large bowl mix eggs, cream, sweetener, and extract.

        "text":"I am making Chicken Vermentino (from another website)http:\/\/cooking.nytimes.com\/recipes\/9079-roast-chicken-vermentino\n\nIs there any reason this dish cannot be assembled ahead of time - maybe 3-4 hours early?\n\n  \u2022 Posted by:\u00a0bailboy\n  \u2022 November 5, 2016\n\n\nMMH November 7, 2016\nI just made this. It is simply divine. It just went in to our permanent file. I did what susan w said. I used 2 oz dried porcini - about $8 but i left out the potatoes and added a pound of baby portobellos and quartered onions. I saut\u00e9ed the fresh mushrooms in small batches. The recipe starts with chicken skin side down (it stuck a bit). The only thing I would recommend if preparing in advance is not to add the liquid until it goes in the oven. I think you could prepare the mushrooms and just hold them and the liquid separately until you are ready to roast. I used rosemary from my garden. I think fresh thyme would work well also. The aroma and the flavor are wonderful and it comes out a gorgeous carmelized color. I roasted cauliflower as a side dish which is easy to put together. Enjoy. Thank you for asking this question because I wouldn't have found this recipe without you!!!\nMMH November 7, 2016\nForgot to say i used all chicken thighs.\nMMH November 7, 2016\nAlso another pound of any type of mushroom would work well.\nSusan W. November 7, 2016\nI can't wait to make this. It sounds amazing. I'll probably skip the potatoes too and add rutabaga (it's making a comeback at my house) and baby portabellas.\nSusan W. November 5, 2016\nYour link doesn't work. You need to be sure there's a space between the link and whatever precedes it. I usually put the link on a separate line to be sure.\n\nI looked it up with Google and it looks like a perfect thing to assemble ahead of time. I'm questioning the amount of dried mushrooms. Does 2.5 ounces really turn into 2.5 cups? I know at my stores, 2.5 ounces would cost a fortune, but go for it if that's not an issue. I think I'd use fresh baby portabella mushrooms, but all those dried will be delicious!!\n\nHere's the link for anyone who's interested in the recipe. I'm definitely making it soon.\n\nRecommended by Food52",
