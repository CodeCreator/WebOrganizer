Whilst gelatine is doing its own disgusting thing, icing sugar must be sieved to ensure beautiful smooth consistency and eradication of lumps. We decided that doing this in the garden might be wise, it turns out this was possibly the best idea either of us have ever had as the aftermath was pretty spectacular.\n\n3. Attempt to lift the phenomenally heavy bag of icing sugar.\n\n4. On failing miserably, LSNM (long suffering nearby male) was once again roped in. for this much icing a spectacular 12 cups of icing sugar are required. This process is rather long, slightly boring, and we have a vague suspicion that inhalation of icing sugar is not actually very good for ones health.\n\n5. At this point we thought we would be clever and add just half the gelatine to half the icing sugar. Turned out we had peaked on the great idea front because by the time we came to the second batch the gelatine was almost solidified in the bowl, making it much harder to work in. so we would recommend finding a bath or something and attempting the whole lot in one go. Add the gelatine bit by bit to the mountains of icing sugar, stirring, then kneading as you go.\n\nRated 77 \/100 - 109 votes (3.85\/5)\n\nRate this pimp!\n\nPages: 1 \u00a0 \u00a02 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nKing Rainbow Drop\n\n\nGiant Chocolate Crispie Cake\n\nGiant Twix\n\nGiant Chocolate Orange\n\nEgg-cellent Easter Pimp",

Home for him was off the beaten track for he worked among the woods and fields as a gamekeeper.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother encouraged these visits for she knew that in his spare time her brother worked hard in his garden and there were always fresh vegetables to spare, better than anything you could buy in the shops.\n\nOne of the things the girl particularly liked were his potatoes, early varieties in the summer with skins that peeled off with a twist of your hand, delicious when cooked with the mint leaves that he showed her. Later there were the main-crop potatoes which he called King Edwards.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said one day. \u201cLook at all those spuds I\u2019ve got stored for the winter.\u201d And he showed her his store of potatoes, insulated in the shed from winter frosts. \u201cThere\u2019s more than enough for me and your aunty for the winter. You come and help yourself whenever you like.\u201d\n\nWinter came and with it the wet and the cold. A month went by and then she appeared again.\n\n\u201cHow are yer love?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh fine,\u201d was her response.\n\n\u201cWhere have you been getting your veg then?\u201d He waved towards the shed. \u201cI\u2019ve bin keepin\u2019 your spuds for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you uncle, but I want to get them fresh still, so I\u2019ve started going to the super-market.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to tell her that the super-market potatoes would be no fresher than his potatoes which he kept, better able to breathe under their straw covering, that the super-market potatoes would have been grown and harvested at the same time as his and that his potatoes had been grown without the help of chemicals. He wanted to tell her how the super-market potatoes would have been bumped about and loaded onto lorries and driven for hundreds of miles and unloaded in a hurry but she was already gathering up the baby and making her way indoors to see her aunt.\n\nWhat differences are there between the super-market potatoes and the uncle\u2019s potatoes?\nWhat do you think supermarkets mean when they say something fresh? What do vegetable gardeners mean when they say something is fresh?\n\nWhy do people trust advertisers?\n\nReturn to Mini Stories main page\nShare this:",

Presented here for your enjoyment.\n\nWombat Juice\nD.A. Cairns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s in it. It\u2019s a secret recipe,\u2019 said Hartley Gregg to an appreciative and curious customer. \u2018Why do you think people come here? The exotic and mysterious food we make, that\u2019s why.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The customer slowly shook his head, disappointed but understanding, and returned his attention to the Chef\u2019s special of the day, Boomerang Stew.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Enjoy,\u2019 said Hartley smiling and bowing slightly before moving away to pander to his other customers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All his competitors used digital waitresses to take orders and automatons to deliver the meals to the tables because it was the most cost effective method, but Hartley liked to give people a choice. So from the three dimensional interactive menu displayed above the table at eye level, they could chose a real waitperson to come and serve them or just place their order electronically. Despite these necessary concessions to the modern restaurant business, Hartley ran an old fashioned establishment where the people who served contributed as much to the ambience of the restaurant as those who were served.\u00a0 He liked to get around to the tables himself too whenever possible, to talk to people and make sure they were enjoying their dining experience at Sanctuary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the bar, Hartley ordered a Wombat Juice for table three and smiled as he watched the barman prepare it. When he finished he placed the glass in Hartley\u2019s hand and said, \u2018First one, eh Boss?\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018How do you think it will go down?\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018We\u2019ll soon find out.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As part of his drive and determination to be on the cutting edge of Australian cuisine, Hartley was always experimenting with new recipes. His father from whom he inherited the business would not have approved at all of all his son\u2019s innovation. He was a traditionalist. A straight up and down, meat and three vegetables, football loving, beer swilling Aussie bloke who reckoned he knew what people wanted and that\u2019s exactly what he gave them. That attitude might have worked in his father\u2019s time but now the competition was so fierce that to be successful one had to have an edge. Hartley\u2019s was food that one could not find anywhere else.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the Red Centre opened up to major development, including the construction and establishment of three entirely self contained satellite cities surrounding Alice Springs, many entrepreneurs were excited by the possibilities offered by a twenty first century gold rush. Hartley Gregg was one of these, but he came to his fortune via an unexpected route.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Long a fan of kangaroo meat, especially barbecued steaks, Hartley had an idea that perhaps some of Australia\u2019s other native animals would also make exotic and sumptuous fare. The problem was, all but the kangaroo, which was considered a pest throughout most of the nation particularly to farmers, were protected by conservation laws. They could not be captured or hurt let alone killed and eaten by hungry or curious humans.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the southernmost of these new satellite cities, the imaginatively titled Sandtown, was a native wildlife sanctuary maintained by private sponsorships and grants. Befriending the chief zoologist there, Hartley learned of the development of a new drug designed to improve the breeding success of endangered native species. The engineers of this pill, had in mind the repopulation of large sections of Australia with native animals. Hartley, however saw another use for a possible excess production of native animals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018What do you think of that?\u2019 said Hartley as he placed the tall glass of Wombat Juice on the table in front of a wide businessman who sat straining at the seams of his dark suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018It looks like fruit juice.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018What did you expect? A frothy brown liquid with hair in it?\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An equally rotund lady sitting opposite the man snorted her disapproval. \u2018Mr Gregg, please, I\u2019m trying to eat.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fat man dismissed his partner with a wave of his fat hand and laughed heartily. \u2018You kill me Hartley,\u2019 he said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Go on and try it.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He lifted the glass slowly to his lips and sniffed at it as though it were fine wine then sipped and swallowed some. A look of bewildered satisfaction came over his fat face and he smiled and said, \u2018Damn that\u2019s a peculiar flavor.\u2019 He lifted the glass to eye level and stared at its contents. \u2018I\u2019ve never tasted anything like it.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Do you like it?\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018I do, Hartley, I do,\u2019 said the man. Pointing his glass at his partner, he added, \u2018Better get another one over here for my lady.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hartley nodded, smiling then turned and walked away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Success! Winning the approval of the fat man, whom he had hoped would be the first to sample his new creation, was a coup for Hartley. The man was not simply another valued regular customer, he was the Chief Magistrate for the satellite cities. His opinion counted and those he favored, were truly favored. His patronage had helped Hartley establish The Sanctuary Restaurant in the first place, and thereafter forge for himself the reputation of being the finest restauranter in the country.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Winking to the barman as he passed on his way to the kitchen, Hartley congratulated himself. The initial results of the trials of the new breeding drug were very positive and so, ignoring possoms and koalas due to their cute and cuddly factor, he started to talk up the likelihood of a plague of hairy-nosed wombats. Although the wonder breeding drug eventually failed on all species, Hartley wanted to do something with wombats. So before the results of the trial of the breeding drug were announced, he fabricated a story and released it through his media contacts.\nThe spin was that for some completely bemusing reason the breeding program had been hyper productive with wombats and now the tubby native beasts, verging \u00a0extinction at the beginning of the twenty first century, were proliferating like rabbits. The problem was how to use the surplus of wombats. Zoos all over the world wanted them, intending to populate their own nations with these distinctive Australian citizens, and there was significant interest in them for scientific testing and research but still there were too many. Having to cull a creature once so close to extinction was a bizarre twist of fate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about serving them up on the dinner tables of The Sanctuary\u2019s patrons. Hartley cleverly ruled that out on the grounds that it was theoretically good but highly problematic. Wombat meat was tough, foul smelling and very high in fat. Good for pet food maybe, but not for people. These facts avoided the reality of not having any wombats. Still the idea persisted that some product may be attained and marketed, as being made from wombats.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wombat Juice was his brainchild and now its inevitable popularity would ensure he stayed on top, and that was exactly where Hartley Gregg wanted to be.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next night everyone demanded Wombat Juice. Hartley was stuck behind the bar helping to prepare the hottest new drink on the menu when a film crew arrived at Sanctuary wanting to do a story for the evening news. Hartley quickly ordered his security automatons to refuse them entry.\nDespite the obvious success of word of mouth, Hartley did want to get the word out about Wombat Juice to as many people in as short a time as possible, so he consented to an interview with a journalist he knew personally. She and her photographer were instructed to remain seated at the table during the interview and asked to keep it brief.\nPassing table four on his way back to the bar, Hartley took another order for Wombat Juice which he delivered to the overworked barman.\n\u2018Boss, I need a hand here.\u2019\n\u2018Right,\u2019 said Hartley graciously, \u2018I\u2019ll do this one myself, no problem.\u2019\u00a0 To the empty drink shaker he added sliced mango and pineapple, then a teaspoon of salt, and a cup of fresh strawberries followed by one shot of white rum and another of vodka.\n\u2018Don\u2019t forget the Wombat, Boss.\u2019\nHartley smiled at his cheeky barman as he reached under the bar for a bottle of thick brown liquid labeled Wombat. He popped the lid and poured it in. \u2018Milo milk and Vegemite. Ridgey didge, my friend,\u2019 he said as he switched on the blender and watched his secret concoction evolve before his eyes. \u2018Truly Australian product.\u2019\n\u2018How long do you reckon it will take someone to figure it out?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Hartley, \u2018but we\u2019ll make a packet of money and have some fun while we\u2019re waiting, won\u2019t we?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah. Hey what about all the real wombats?\u2019\nHartley smiled. \u2018So you believed the story about the hairy-nosed wombat population explosion did you?\u2019\nThe barman shook his head and laughed. \u2018You got me there Boss. You got me there.\u2019",

        "text":"From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nMelons (Latin: Maximus Melonus) are a type of fruit that grows in the Caribbean, on islands such as Jamaica and Antigua. Melons are about 30cm in diameter, roughly spherical and weigh approximately 2.5kg.\n\nA melon is a largish fruit not unlike a unripe watermelon. Without melons this world might be as significant as it is today. Melons can be Honeydew, Cantaloupe, Galia or possibly even simultaneous. Melons tend to taste sweet, providing the skin is left unadulterated. Melons are also known to suddenly disappear.\n\nedit The Significance of Melons\n\nWhere would we be today if that student hadn't thrown a melon at George Bush in his speech to the nation? Imagine what would have happened if Germany when it attempted to drop a nuclear bomb on Liverpool in early 1945 had actually put their nuclear bomb prototype in the aircraft instead of a melon by mistake. Well actually it's Liverpool, so it's unfortunate that the Germans fouled up.\n\nedit History\n\nDetermining the exact age of the melon is an uncertain business, given that most melons resemble other fruits. However, with the use of cunning technology, it has been determined that the melon is probably 300-400 million years old. Not a great deal is known about the original melons, though they would have been half the size of modern equivalents.\n\nedit Uses\n\nMelons have been cultivated for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, eating, bowling and as weapons. The taste is reminiscent of a sort of sweetened watermelon taste with extra sweetness and less redness. Without melons, diet would collapse.\n\nPersonal tools",

Woman: Give me a pound of your finest bologna.\n\n6\/12\/11 4:55AM\n\nDid y\u2019all catch the metaphor for Asian American race relations in the first panel? In all seriousness, this comic\u2019s poke at elitism is the closest we\u2019ve ever come to real social commentary. Well, except for that time we invented all those penis names. That was DEEP.\n\nI\u2019ve long scoffed at those poor souls older than, say, 5 who still consider american cheese of any color edible. I had, however, been led to believe that for those who consume it, white american was somehow the more respectable choice. It was all lies.

In anger over the inconvenience, we issued the following email to their public relations correspondent:\n\nDear Christine,\n\nI\u2019m wondering why you named your institution after the worst of all cheeses. Technically, American Cheese isn\u2019t even cheese at all. Why not call yourselves \u201cThe US Cheese Society,\u201d so as to maintain some semblance of respectability?\n\nI expected things to end there, assuming such an attack wouldn\u2019t warrant a response. I was wrong.\n\nDear William,\n\nI invite you to look around our website and you will see that the founder of our organization, Dr. Frank Kosikowski, Professor Emeritus of Dairy Sciences at Cornell saw much more in American cheese than the sliced single. Today, we represent Artisan, Farmstead and specialty cheeses and supporting cheese community from throughout the Americas. You can attend our upcoming conference in Montreal, August 1-4 to learn more.\n\nI responded in turn:\n\nDear Christine,\n\nIf you represent just the United States and Canada, then you should call yourselves \u201cThe North American Cheese Alliance.\u201d If Central and South America are part of your coalition, then I recommend \u201cThe Western Hemisphere Cheese Group.\u201d Anything to distance yourself from the \u201cprocessed cheese product\u201d (so labeled because American Cheese does not typically meet the legal definition of cheese in many jurisdictions) that your current name recalls.\n\nNeedless to say, I have yet to hear from Christine a second time. Her email address is chyatt@cheesesociety.org, and I encourage you all to email her new name suggestions for her cheese society. Nipples points for anyone who gets any kind of response.",

Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll sign you out.

The waitress poured his mom another cup of coffee.\nThe waitress laughed, a snorting giggle.\n\u201cThat's cute\u201d she said, turning to look at Mom, a young woman in her mid twenties who'd peering at a magazine while fidgeting with her food. She slapped her sandwich on her plate and grabbed Denny's arm.\n\u201cShit\u201d she said, her voice a irritated hiss, \u201che's doing this on purpose, the rat-\u201c\n\u201cOwwwwwwwwwwwwWWWWWWW\u201d yelled Denny when she yanked him upright on the stool, forcing into an impossible posture. His face met the edge of the counter half way,\nwhere he could see a history of dried and chipping wads of gum mark the rim like mountain ranges on three-dimensional globes. The hamburger Mom ordered for him sat on its plate in front of him, a mountain of meat and sesame seed buns.\n\u201cNow eat\u201d his mother demanded. Her long finger that had been leafing through the magazine pointed to the plate, looking crooked, shaking, with a long, twisting fingernail curling toward the charred patty as if to drop something from a claw. Denny cringed again.\n\u201cEat\u201d she said again \u201ceat and quit fucking around.\u201d\nThe waitress's smile shrank to a chastised `o' from his bulging , full-cheeked glory, and turned to chores , her own business. She pulled half empty ketchup bottles from a shelf under the counter as Denny reached over the chasm between he and the counter and grabbed the hamburger from the plate. It was the size of a football in both his hands. Squeezing it tight, he raised it to his mouth and then turned his eyes to Mom in order to see if she could see him doing exactly what he was told, a mature boy of 4 and a half!\nMom was sipping her coffee, the sandwich on the plate with two bites out of it, staring at the waitress who was pouring the remains of the ketchup bottles into a single vessel, so to waste not a drop. Denny squeezed the burger so tight that the patty slid from between the buns and hit the floor with a wet slap that sounded like a kiss heard in rowdy cartoons. The phone rang, and when the waitress reached over to grab the line, her arm swept into the bottles and knocked them to the floor. The bottles shattered into a hundred red, bloodless shards. Startled, Mom spilled her coffee.\nLittle Denny fell off the stool.\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1. I question that this is fiction. I saw much the same thing happen last weekend at Famous Weiner Lunch in Hanover, PA. Stop trying to spare the public the harrowing, carnivorial truth.\n\n\nComments are moderated due to spam.

And cheese has never been possible.\n\nAre you mad doing that in front of him?\n\nAnd it was the same at work.\n\nAs you can see on the \"camembert\" pie chart, camembert, camembert, camembert...\n\nHere I live in perfect harmony with nature. Be careful. There are monkeys. Is anyone there?\nWell, yes, yes. I miss my family. Especially my son.\n\nMr. Crow perched on a tree. Was holding in his beak a piece of chee... chicken.\nThat's my boy.\n\nChampion. Cheese is mice's favorite food. Once you know that, you understand everything. Yeah, it needs thinking about. So the day I found out Burger King was creating Cheese Lovers - burgers with cheese all over - cheese sauce, cheese bread, cheese slices, I moved to the other side of the world. I had no choice.\n\nCurrently the Cheese Lover. Unique burgers for those who are crazy about cheese. (simply crazy you mean).\n\nAnd why not steak with cheese. Come on!\n\nWritten Text\n\nNo Help\nCheese Lover & Bacon\nBurger King\n\nMore from Popisms\n\n\nName: Email: URL: Comment:",

Meat, she claims, especially the red kind, will never touch her lips. Consuming any kind of animal flesh would make her ill.\n\nShe spoke of her passion while seated on my leather-upholstered sofa in my living room. Beneath her Italian leather shoes, a sheepskin rug played with her toes. The wide belt that held her top and bottom halves together had once been part of a bovine. I wondered how she\u2019d coaxed the cow into giving up its skin. She continued her diatribe on the subject of vegetarianism and I began to feel accused of a deadly sin.\n\nSo I asked her, \u201cHow about other carnivores?\u201d\n\n\u201cCarnivores?\u201d she echoed.\n\n\u201cYou know, those other animals of Heaven\u2019s kingdom that eat meat? Are you planning to train leopards to quit munching on emus and water buffalo? If you can do that, how about turning wolves and coyotes onto leeks and lettuce so they\u2019ll leave my lambs and calves alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Ms. Veggie. \u201cI avoid red meat, white meat, dairy products and eggs. I eat only barley mash and cauliflower. My system repulses anything else. It\u2019s a spiritual thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSon-of-a-gun,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe I should turn my little ranch into one giant vegetable garden. Vegetables don\u2019t bunch up and stampede across the top of a person as the sheep did to me this morning. I got dumped on my face in Mother Earth\u2019s finest fertilizer.\n\nEnergized by my own rhetoric, I babbled on. \u201cAnd vegetables don\u2019t have to be wormed or rounded up or fed hay in the teeth of a blizzard. And anybody can castrate a carrot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd rarely do you have to go out in frigid weather to check the heifer cabbages, let alone pull a baby one out of its mamma.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd breeding vegetables is a straightforward matter of dropping a seed in a bit of dirt. You\u2019re not required to have a bull vegetable. You don\u2019t have problems with a broccoli boar shooting blanks or a sow cauliflower lying on her babies. And rarely do you have social problems with hired men falling in love with the zucchini.\u201d\n\nTalking with Ms. Veggie made me hungry. So I invited her to sit at my kitchen table while I started supper. I pulled some nice prime rib steaks out of the freezer, put some potatoes in the oven and started chopping up salad makings.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d I said, \u201cVegetables. And I\u2019m fixing a spinach cheese casserole as well. It\u2019s a spiritual thing.\u201d\n\nMs. Veggie sniffed, shuddered at the sight of juicy steaks and began to draw on her leather gloves in preparation for departure. I paused in chopping a stalk of celery and sort of waved my knife in her general direction.\n\n\u201cSomething occurs to me,\u201d I said. \u201cSeems as if the carnivores of the world go around eating up the herbivores. Like lions eat buffalo; foxes eat geese; cats eat mice. Maybe vegetarians are put here as food for the rest of us. I don\u2019t care for rare vegetarians, so how would you like yourself cooked \u2013 medium or well-done?\u201d\n\nStart a dialogue, stay on topic and be civil.\nIf you don't follow the rules, your comment may be deleted.\n\nUser Legend: iconModerator iconTrusted User\n\n( function ( body ) { 'use strict'; body.className = body.className.replace( \/\\btribe-no-js\\b\/, 'tribe-js' ); } )( document.body );",

        "text":"The Waffle House is, perhaps, one of the greatest eating establishments ever constructed. It's impossible to quantify a person's preference and I imagine mine is closely related to the fact that I haven't eaten at a Waffle House in nearly ten years. Absence, they say, makes the heart grow fonder and the stomach stronger. You see, there aren't any Waffle Houses in Nevada. There may be none on the entire west coast but to be realistic, I'm really only concerned with the shortage in my immediate vicinity.\n\nFortunately for me the casino culture in Las Vegas brings many culinary venues into an area that would not normally support them and while this service has not extended to Waffle House or White Castle yet, we do have some adequate replacements. Enter, the Original Pancake House. Featured on FoodTV, this restaurant has all of your normal breakfast goodies and some extras that make the experience worthwhile.\n\nThe true specialty of The Original Pancake House is undoubtedly their oven baked dishes. They oven bake pancakes that fluff at the edges and become filled with fresh fruit. By some method that remains mysterious to me they also oven bake omelets and it was one of these that nearly did me in.\n\nI had heard so much about these particular omelets that I decided to deviate from my normal pattern of always buying the same dish at any restaurant. I normally get the bacon waffle at The Original Pancake House. What could be better than a waffle with bacon in it? Such was the question I aimed to resolve, so I ordered the Irish Omelet, advertised as \"4 farm fresh eggs oven baked with corned beef hash, onions and cheddar cheese. It sounded delightful and capable of satisfying my meaty desires. Just to be safe I also ordered a side plate of bacon.\n\nAfter a lengthy wait, our cherubic waitress brought my plate, set it in front of me, and made no sign or word of warning about the dish's temperature. Now, I'm not normally the type of person to lay blame for the withholding of what should be obvious information, and I shall make no exception to that rule this time. In retrospect, that the food was hot should be clear to anyone who's IQ surpasses that of a wet bag of hammers. After all, my fluffy whipped egg dish had just spent fifteen or more minutes basking in the warmth of an oven and was then basted with melted cheese, a product known for its peculiar thermal properties. So, I shall not blame the service industry for my own, nearly fatal error.\n\nIn my own defense, I would like to say that I have frequently won chess matches against a wet bag of hammers. Additionally, my meal exhibited none of the traditional visual warning signs of heat. There was no steam and the cheese was not runny but rather appeared crusty and cold where it had once bubbled. I felt no excessive heat, either in the vicinity of the main course or from the plate itself upon which the eggs sat. With the ignorant bravery of a lemming proud to be the leader of the pack, I dug in with gusto and placed a largish portion of the omelet in my tender mouth.\n\nEither I had mistakenly forked a hot coal or Lucifer himself had decided to sublet my palette. Fire had seemingly sprouted between my teeth and in that moment I realized several things within a matter of seconds. One, the baked and browned exterior of the omelet had become an extremely efficient insulator that could potentially revolutionize space vehicle re-entries. B, My mouth was swiftly blistering and I needed to do something fast. Four, I needed to get a smog check on my truck so that I could get the registration renewed. It's strange which memories float to the surface in moments of great suffering and alacrity.\n\nUsing the time honored method employed by every idiotic glutton, I maneuvered the offending piece of food with my tongue so that it rested upon my teeth, opened my mouth wide and drew in breath so as to cool the overheated food. Unfortunately for me, a largish piece of my partially chewed egg became detached from its brethren and aided by my desperate breaths, was drawn into my windpipe. I was choking.\n\nWith all the dignity of a chatty dentist my companion inquired of me, \"What's wrong?\" I of course, was unable to reply, but I made several hand gestures that would have won me nothing but cold stares in Pictionary. I continued to chew and choke. Tears filled my vision. Undaunted by my vague gesticulations, my companion continued her litany of interrogatives. \"Do you not like it? Why aren't you chewing?\" Her string of questions were only interrupted by her laughter, as I'm told I was quite comical by this point.\n\nI suppose I could have simply spit out the bite of egg, and flaming hot cheese, but honestly it hadn't even occurred to me. One simply does not spit out food when in public. I may be many things, but spitting up perfectly good food is simply rude, even if it is killing you. Frequently, miracles have little explanation and this one was no exception. I was able to clear the choking egg without spitting it out, at the same time that the egg in my mouth had cooled enough to complete its mastication and swallow.\n\nI was, understandably, short of breath and after a few sips from my water glass I explained my situation to the young lady laughing across the table from me. The danger had passed and I began to laugh myself, although I was troubled that I had not been privy to a review of my life. It's just as well, as I'm sure it would have distracted me from the very necessary task of preventing my death.\n\nA short time later the waitress returned to refill my coffee and pleasantly inquired, \"How is everything?\"\n\nMy reply was curt, \"I damn near died!\"\n\n\"Okay,\" she smiled, \"let me know if you need anything else.\"\n\nLog in or registerto write something here or to contact authors.",
