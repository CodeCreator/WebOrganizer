        "text":"\n\n\n\nFAQ : How does the use of World Class Manufacturing & Just in Time (JIT) vary between mass production and process industries?\n\nWorld class manufacturing opportunities vary enormously from one company to the next and certainly between one type of industry and another. World Class Manufacturing is not therefore a prescriptive solution but a toolbox of techniques. You should pick the most appropriate of the various techniques to fit the precise situation.\n\nIn an industry, for instance, where discrete but basically similar products are built sequentially, the best manufacturing method is likely to be based on kanban control whether it is a process industry or a batch production industry. If each of the products are engineered to order fewer of the world class manufacturing techniques are applicable. Even though a company cannot use kanban for its main production processes it may be possible to supply components such as fixtures fittings, packaging and labels using kanbans. The first stage is therefore to understand the techniques the second, and more difficult, is to learn how to apply them to your business.\n\nHave a look at the checklist at http:\/\/www.bpic.co.uk\/wcm_checklist.htm for a convenient checklist of the main world class manufacturing techniques.\n\nJIT (Just in Time) is basically the same technique as Lean Manufacturing. Six Sigma embraces many of the Lean Manufacturing and Total Quality concepts. They all come under the general heading of World Class Manufacturing.\n\nFor more information you should get a copy of my book Business Excellence.

        "text":"\ufeffMolokai Wind Farm | The Molokai Dispatch\n\n, , , ,\n\nMolokai Wind Farm\n\nBasic Questions and Answers (Part 1)\n\nBy Steve Morgan\n\nA quick disclaimer \u2013 I currently do not represent a position of support or opposition in regard to the proposed wind farm. My only intention of this series is to help our community in getting a basic understanding of this project.\n\nWhy is the state actively seeking to build windmills on Molokai?\nThe urgency to build a wind farm on Molokai originates with State Bill HRS 269-92, which mandates that the state of Hawaii replace 40 percent of its oil consumption by the year 2030 with renewable energy. Mandated intervals also require a 10 percent reduction in oil consumption by 2010, which has been met. By 2015, renewable energy must reach the 15 percent level and by 2020 a 25 percent level must be reached.\n\nWind energy from Molokai and Lanai is recognized as a significant contributor to reaching these goals. According to Hawaiian Electric, the only other readily available source of renewable energy that could substitute the capacity of wind would be bio diesel, both created domestically and imported.\u00a0 The cost of biodiesel however, would be expected to be considerably higher than that of wind power.\u00a0 The primary motive for the creation of HRS 269-92 centers on major concerns of rising oil prices and its impact upon our economy. In the last two years the price of oil has risen 119%.\u00a0 On Molokai, the primary source of our power is oil based. Even our ability to pump water is determined by the availability of oil.\n\nHow many windmills are being proposed for Molokai?\nThe number of wind turbines will range from a minimum of 56 to a maximum of 174 dependent on the total output size of the project (either 200 megawatts (MW) or 400 MW). The number also depends on the size of the turbines themselves which range from 2.3MW to 3.6 MW.\u00a0 For example, a total output capacity of 200 MW would require 87 turbines each with a capacity of 2.3 MW. If turbines with a capacity of 3.6 MW were used, the total number required would be 56 turbines.\nWhere will the inter-island cable come on shore?\nAlthough the final location of cable landing is yet to be determined, the three proposed sites include the areas of Ilio Point, Hale O Lono and Pala`au.\n\nIs the cable safe or cause harm to the reef?\nAlthough further conclusions may result during the course of the environmental impact statement (EIS) process, the impact should be minimal. A cable system with a rating of 400 MW is likely to require at least three conductors (power lines) bundled together into a single line, each conductor being four inches in diameter.\u00a0 Beyond the original settling on the ocean floor, which takes a few days, no further significant disruption should occur. No reports of human safety concerns have been reported in other areas of the world where similar cabling has been used. Keys to avoiding environmental damage include the method in which the cable is laid, and avoiding highly sensitive marine environments. At this time, many submarine cables exist between the islands.\n\nFor cable diagrams and mapping: http:\/\/hawaii.gov\/dbedt\/info\/energy\/efficiency\/ppe\/Resources\/2010%20Presentations\/Kam.pdf\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.",

If you are not getting this many holes out of your punch, call us so that we can determine how to get the most out of your punch.\n\nI don't see my punch and die style number on your site.\n\n  \u2022 Email or fax us a rough sketch of your punch showing the head diameter, body diameter and overall length.\n  \u2022 Show the outside diameter and the height of the die.\n  \u2022 Indicate any special spots or grooves.\n  \u2022 Or, call us with the punch and die and measuring tool in front of you. We will walk you through it.\n\nHow do I know if my machine has enough tonnage for my application?\n\nTo calculate the tonnage you need for your application click here:\u00a0Tonnage Calculator\n\nWhat if I'm not punching mild steel? How do I determine the tonnage I require?\n\nFor punching materials other than mild steel use our Tonnage Calculator. Select your material, thickness and punch size and it will calculate the tonnage you require for your application.\n\nWhy am I getting a burr on my slug and hole?\n\n  \u2022 A burr can indicate punch and die misalignment if the burr is only on one side.\n  \u2022 If there are burrs all around the slug and hole, this indicates a worn punch. Reorder the punch for a clean hole.\n  \u2022 If you find your slug is double sheared, the clearance between punch and die is too tight. Calculate the proper clearance here:\u00a0Die Clearance Calculator\n\nWhy is my punch breaking?\n\n  \u2022 Be sure that your stripper has a tight clearance between the bottom of the stripper and the top of the material.\n  \u2022 Check that you have proper clearance between punch and die.\n  \u2022 Do you have enough tonnage?\n  \u2022 Never\u00a0punch a hole that is smaller than the thickness of the material you are punching.\n\nHow do I know if I need keyways on my punch?\n\n  \u2022 If you are punching a shaped hole, keyways are helpful for keeping the punch aligned properly. For more information click here:\u00a0Alignment Tools\n  \u2022 Check your punch stem. Does it have grooves in it?\n  \u2022 If so, are they square, round, \"v\" grooves or side grooves?\n  \u2022 If they are square, measure the width and depth.\n  \u2022 You will be able to select your appropriate keyway when ordering.\n  \u2022 If your punch stem is not keyed and your would like to use keyways, call us.
