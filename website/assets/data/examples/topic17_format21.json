        "text":"Michael Merrifield\u2019s Liberal-Leaning Globe\n\nHere is a story that pretty much embodies state Rep. Michael Merrifield\u2018s approach to politics. Two years ago, Merrifield\u2019s conservative colleague Dave Schultheis announced he was forming a Bible Study at the state Capitol. Not to be outdone, Merrifield organized his own, four-week long bipartisan Bible study in another room at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it to make a swipe at the ultra right,\u201d Merrifield said at the time. \u201cOne of the things I decided when I decided to run for office is that I would not let the Christian right abrogate from me my Christianity or patriotism; those are not owned by the far right.\u201d\n\nMerrifield\u2019s a retired high school music teacher. He\u2019s strident, energetic and rambunctious. It\u2019s almost been a prerequisite for the job. For the past six years he\u2019s been El Paso County\u2019s lone elected Democrat in a 13-member legislative delegation. He has never forgotten the insult of Rep. Keith King, asking him at the start of one session years ago, when the Republicans still held the majority, how it felt knowing that every single one of his bills was going to be killed. Merrifield gets the last laugh. Headed into his third term in office, the chairman of the House Education Committee is in the majority \u2013 and now he\u2019s got a second Democrat from El Paso County, Senator-elect John Morse, watching his back.\n\nNow that the Democrats have taken over the governor\u2019s office, as well as the House and Senate, what are you planning to do?\nI\u2019m looking forward to taking over the world and turning it into my own personal liberal-leaning globe. Seriously, it\u2019s kind of scary being in this position; what if we screw it up? I\u2019m really excited and nervous about the next couple of years. We have the opportunity to do some positive things for Colorado and really get some things done in education and the environment, health care \u2013 it\u2019s really time to put up or shut up.\n\nWhat can we expect from education, specifically online charters? (NOTE: A host of problems, including lack of accountability, massive overhead costs, dismal student test scores and tax dollars funding religious instruction have been exposed in recent weeks targeting Hope Online Learning Academy.)\nI look forward to addressing the obvious shortcomings of online education in Colorado. I\u2019ve never been particularly fond of online charters \u2013 look at the amount of money they use that doesn\u2019t go into educating kids. It\u2019s a total misuse of the original charter school legislation. It\u2019s one of the methods that the neocons and the public education detractors and haters are using to gain entry into the system, and we are going to address it in legislation this year.\n\nIn addition, we might try to see if there\u2019s a way to administer CSAPs earlier, and get results back earlier to make it more user friendly.\n\nI\u2019m also interested in establishing a restorative justice system for schools, so kids have an alternative to being expelled or suspended. Basically they agree to sit down with the group and face the victim of whatever act it was, and work out restitution, and apologize and understand the negative effects of what they\u2019ve done.\n\nWhat else is on the agenda?\nI\u2019m going to bring back my tenant-landlord bill, probably with stronger tenants\u2019 rights than in the past. I\u2019m looking forward to sitting down with Governor Ritter, to hopefully come up with something that\u2019s good for tenants and landlords. Governor Owens vetoed the bill two years ago, and then last year I asked for it to be killed. I had thought we had an agreement between tenant and landlord groups, but it didn\u2019t work out. It did a number of things \u2013 changed the cap on late fees, changed the date that landlords have to return damage deposits, required renters to be given a copy of lease. It was a pretty minor bill compared to what other states have.\u00a0 But Governor Owens was convinced by the realtor\u2019s association that it would be a terrible catastrophe \u2013 the winds would come in fury, and the locusts would descend upon us\u2026\n\nSo have you heard from the conservative Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce, which declined to endorse either you or Democrat Senator-elect John Morse?\nThey haven\u2019t been calling me and beating on the door. I can\u2019t understand. No Christmas cards, nothing.\n\nSeriously, though, the majority party wants Senator Morse and myself to do well \u2013 Democrats have established a beachhead in El Paso County and if John and I can show that Democrats from a place where the vast majority is Republican can get things done, it will help in the coming years.\n\nHave you reached out to the similarly-conservative Colorado Springs City Council or the El Paso County Board of Commissioners?\nI did send out feelers. I think it would be a good policy if we met on a regular basis \u2013 I\u2019ve put out the offer and I\u2019m hoping they respond positively. I\u2019m really looking forward to meeting with [county Commissioner] Douglas Bruce on a regular basis\u2026 you know my tongue is firmly in cheek, right? But it does need to be done.\n\nWhich new Republican lawmaker from El Paso County are you most excited about joining you at the Capitol?\nThat\u2019s a tough one \u2013 they\u2019re all so exciting. Kent Lambert and Bob Gardner are sort of the Bobbsey Twins of humor \u2013 both are such great, fun guys. (Gardner, a former GOP chairman and longtime political operative in Colorado Springs, replaces term-limited Rep. Keith King; Lambert replaces Senator-elect Dave Schultheis, for whom Lambert previously worked as a legislative aide. Geographically speaking, Merrifield\u2019s district in central\/western Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs is sandwiched between the two incoming freshmen.)\n\nThe first thing I plan to ask [Bob] Gardner is, \u201cHow does it feel to know none of your legislation will pass?\u201d Ha, ha, just kidding.\n\nOne final question: Did you hook Ted Haggard and Mike Jones up? I mean, this campaign you were being challenged by Haggard\u2019s junior pastor, Kyle Fisk\u2026\nThat\u2019s even past the limits of my political strategic intellect \u2013 that sounds like a Karl Rovian thing, really.\n\nCara DeGette is a longtime editor and columnist at the Colorado Springs Independent.\n\nRead all of the \u201cKnow Your Legislator\u201d profiles here.\n\nComments are closed.",

        "text":"Full Text Political Transcripts February 15, 2018: Statement by President Donald Trump on the Shooting in Parkland,\u00a0Florida\n\n\n\nDiplomatic Room\n11:22 A.M. EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, today I speak to a nation in grief. Yesterday, a school filled with innocent children and caring teachers became the scene of terrible violence, hatred, and evil.\n\nAround 2:30 yesterday afternoon, police responded to reports of gunfire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida \u2014 a great and safe community. There, a shooter, who is now in custody, opened fire on defenseless students and teachers. He murdered 17 people and badly wounded at least 14 others.\n\nOur entire nation, with one heavy heart, is praying for the victims and their families. To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you \u2014 whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain. We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.\nNo child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school. No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning.\n\nEach person who was stolen from us yesterday had a full life ahead of them \u2014 a life filled with wondrous beauty and unlimited potential and promise. Each one had dreams to pursue, love to give, and talents to share with the world. And each one had a family to whom they meant everything in the world.\n\nToday, we mourn for all of those who lost their lives. We comfort the grieving and the wounded. And we hurt for the entire community of Parkland, Florida that is now in shock, in pain, and searching for answers.\n\nTo law enforcement, first responders, and teachers who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We thank you for your courage. Soon after the shooting, I spoke with Governor Scott to convey our deepest sympathies to the people of Florida and our determination to assist in any way that we can. I also spoke with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.\nI\u2019m making plans to visit Parkland to meet with families and local officials, and to continue coordinating the federal response.\n\nIn these moments of heartache and darkness, we hold on to God\u2019s word in scripture: \u201cI have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will heal you.\u201d\nWe trust in that promise, and we hold fast to our fellow Americans in their time of sorrow.\n\nI want to speak now directly to America\u2019s children, especially those who feel lost, alone, confused or even scared: I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you. If you need help, turn to a teacher, a family member, a local police officer, or a faith leader. Answer hate with love; answer cruelty with kindness.\n\nWe must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life, that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.\n\nOur administration is working closely with local authorities to investigate the shooting and learn everything we can. We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.\n\nLater this month, I will be meeting with the nation\u2019s governors and attorney generals, where making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority. It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make that difference.\n\nIn times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil, and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.\n\nAnd so always, but especially today, let us hold our loved ones close, let us pray for healing and for peace, and let us come together as one nation to wipe away the tears and strive for a much better tomorrow.\n\nThank you. And God Bless you all. Thank you very much.\n\n\n11:28 A.M.

our rights come from our Creator.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 No matter what, no Earthly force can take those rights away.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That is why the words \u201cPraise be to God\u201d are etched atop the Washington Monument, and those same words are etched into the hearts of our people.\n\nSo today, we praise God for how truly blessed we are to be American.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Across our land, we see the splendor of God\u2019s creation.\u00a0 Throughout our history, we see the story of God\u2019s providence.\u00a0 And in every city and town, we see the Lord\u2019s grace all around us, through a million acts of kindness, courage and generosity. \u00a0We love God.\n\nWe see the Lord\u2019s grace in the service members who risk their lives for our freedom.\u00a0 We see it in the teachers who work tirelessly for their students, and the police who sacrifice for our communities \u2014 and sacrifice they do.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd we see the Lord\u2019s grace in the moms and dads who work two and three jobs to give their children the chance for a better and much more prosperous and happier life.\n\nAs the Bible tells us, for we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Jesus Christ to do good works.\u00a0 America\u2019s heroes rise to this calling.\u00a0 In their selfless deeds, they reveal the beauty and goodness of the human soul.\n\nWhen catastrophic hurricanes struck, first responders and everyday citizens dove into rushing waters to save stranded families from danger.\u00a0 And they saved them by the thousands.\u00a0 Neighbors opened their homes to those in need of food, clothes, shelter.\u00a0 Firefighters braved blinding smoke and flames to rescue children from devastating wildfires.\n\nDuring the horrific shootings, strangers shielded strangers, and police officers ran into a hail of bullets to save the lives of their fellow Americans, right in Las Vegas.\u00a0 A terrible day, a terrible night.\u00a0 But such bravery.\n\nFamilies have adopted babies orphaned by the opioid epidemic and given them loving homes.\u00a0 Communities and churches have reached out to those struggling with addiction, and shown them the path to a clean life, a good job, and a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nAnd soldiers, sailors, Coast Guardsmen, airmen, and Marines have spent long months away from home defending our great American flag.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAll we have to do is open our eyes and look around us, and we can see God\u2019s hand.\u00a0 In the courage of our fellow citizens, we see the power of God\u2019s love at work in our souls, and the power of God\u2019s will to answer all of our prayers.\n\nWhen Americans are able to live by their convictions, to speak openly of their faith, and to teach their children what is right, our families thrive, our communities flourish, and our nation can achieve anything at all.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nTogether, as Americans, we are a tireless force for justice and for peace.\u00a0 We have witnessed this truth over the past year.\n\nFor years, ISIS had brutally tortured and murdered Christians, Jews, religious minorities, and countless Muslims.\n\nToday, the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the te...

        "text":"About this site\n\nThis resource is hosted by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, but was compiled and authored by Padraig O\u2019Malley. It is the product of almost two decades of research and includes analyses, chronologies, historical documents, and interviews from the apartheid and post-apartheid eras.\n\n10 Nov 1996: Chalmers, Judy\n\nClick here for more information on the Interviewee\n\nClick here for Overview of the year\n\nPOM\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Judy, we had just been talking about Louis Botha, the outcome of the Malan trial, his work here in Port Elizabeth as a community policeman and I want to move the question slightly; he passionately believes that the Truth & Reconciliation Commission is a witch-hunt, that only perpetrators of crime on one side are being called to heel, that, for example, he will say he knows dozens of dockets that were outstanding against senior people in the ANC that were put in abeyance during the negotiations and that many of these ANC senior people have told him personally they are never going to go before the Truth Commission. And you're back to this question, and I sense underneath it, Matthews Phosa's thing of there being a just war and they should never stand at the same bar of justice as those who imposed the apartheid regime. And it's given arise to a lot of anger that I sense among white people, that they feel they are being nailed and that they are angry about it and also that they don't feel particularly guilty about all these revelations about Eugene de Kock. I mean they shocked but they don't feel any sense of personal or collective guilt for actions of Eugene de Kock or security forces or whatever. Are my perceptions on the mark, off the mark, where would you come in?\n\nJC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well the ordinary whites who are saying those sort of things, such as why rake up the past and is it helpful towards reconciliation and does it matter now who were the actual perpetrators, and as one who lived through the eighties and to an extent was victimised by what was happening there it doesn't surprise me that they are taking that point of view. It doesn't surprise me that Louis Botha is in fact taking a point of view and feels passionately that it is a witch-hunt. I feel just as passionately that the people who were the perpetrators should be brought, not necessarily to book, but the revelations must go on and must take place and it is about truth. The people that I speak to like Benedicta Godolozi who is mother of one of the Pepco three and Nyami Goniwe and Xalata's widow, they themselves, Nyami and to a lesser extent Mrs. Xalata when the Truth Commission, and it was the first held, was held here in Port Elizabeth, Nyami particularly felt very wary. She felt she had said it so many times before, she felt that although they didn't know exactly who had done the killing she felt that they had gone right up to the point and she didn't ever think we would take that final step. But when she made her appearance and it was in East London, I phoned her that night and she said to me it was absolutely liberating. She said, \"I found it so extraordinary to be able to be saying those things and I knew they were being televised and I felt at the end of that day that for the very first time I was freeing myself to an extent of the bitterness and the anger and the hatred and the total resentment that nothing would ever come out.\" She said, \"I found it hugely liberating.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And for me, and I attended, for instance, the hearing of the Langa massacre in Uitenhage which I had been extremely involved in and heard once again the truth of what the people were saying because at the time everybody was saying, \"Oh they were an unruly and a wild mob, oh they were throwing stones\", and to hear, which I had heard from a contact within the police, that they had put stones into the people's hands, which we knew. First of all they said they were not properly prepared, which we all knew, that the crowd were a wild, barbarous mob and had attacked them, we knew that hadn't happened but it had never been said by the other side. So I have found, myself, again and again as the revelations have come out, a sense of relief. The whites, of course, were never exposed to the sort of things that a few of us whites were exposed to. They were enclosed in their sort of corrals and were very happy to be there and I'll bet they feel put upon now because the truth is coming out.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But I think it's been an extraordinary and a wonderful journey for many, many people and for whites as well, people who had a suspicion of some of the things that were going on and have now said to me, \"I feel so ashamed that I lived through that time and I did nothing.\" And that sort of shame is appropriate now I do feel. I think that a measure of guilt, they should feel that.\n\nPOM\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thought was whether this is a cathartic experience for whites or whether there is, again, this feeling of it being a witch-hunt in terms of the perpetrators who are being brought to boot. For example, one will hear Matthews Phosa say that the Church Street bombings, people will not apply for amnesty even though civilians were involved, that it was an act committed in a just war. You have Robert McBride given amnesty for an act that involved the wanton bombing of civilians. Can you equate the two? Where does the principle of moral equivalence come in? For example, I talked at length last week to a young man who had been very involved in the townships in the eighties as a young comrade and he went into detail about the way they operated and it was gruesome. You could only call it a kangaroo court, anybody who came under suspicion was just ganged up on and killed. Is there a difference between that and some of the actions that Eugene de Kock would commit?\n\nJC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It's a difficult one. I always felt uncomfortable with the soft target strategy because I felt there was an immorality about it that I felt extremely uncomfortable with. I also felt that it was a politically inappropriate strategy to adopt because it just gave fuel to the Nationalist government and to the security forces. But it was always difficult to know whether there was third force involvement there or not. Here in this town we knew that there was a considerable third force involvement. There was the whole AZAPO scenario which we were never sure whether they were truly AZAPO or whether they were being used by people like the Reverend Mcina who was running an anti-UDF whole sideline at the time and in fact subsequently we heard that he was in the pay of the security police so it was difficult to know quite what was what at that time. The necklacing was horrifying and terrible but, of course, the police did necklacing as well. They used it as a strategy to put the comrades and the UDF whole fighting force in a bad light.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But to get back to the Truth Commission, I understand what Desmond Tutu is saying, that the ANC cannot decide for themselves whether they go for amnesty and they can't be their own moral judge and jury when the Truth Commission has been set up with ANC approval to do a job of work and I think there is room for some of the ANC ways of working that happen then to be brought under the spotlight and some of those comrades who were doing the sort of things that you described a few minutes ago, for the truth to come out about that. But nobody who didn't live through that time - I'm outraged that Louis Botha can say it's a witch-hunt when he was part and parcel of a regime that tore this country apart, that leaves us in a situation now where we are trying so desperately to rebuild and remake and build anew, because it never was built in the first place, and that he can say it was the likes of Eugene de Kock and his minions, that that is a witch-hunt.\n\nPOM\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No, I don't think he sees Eugene de Kock as a witch-hunt.\n\nJC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But what happened to himself.\n\nPOM\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That him and that only people from one side are being sought. It's not that it's a particular individual per se, it's that it's one-sided.\n\nJC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I think what Matthews Phosa said about the just war from the ANC's position it was a just war but there were bad things done by the ANC soldiers and comrades and the Magoo Bar that was an atrocious happening and I can never feel comfortable with random killing of that sort and car bombing and explosives and shooting set to happen just to frighten the general public. I think the ANC had so much moral ground on its side and had such a strong moral position it wasn't necessary to do those sorts of random strategic killings.\n\nPOM\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But my, and correct me, my recollection is that in 1985 official sanction was given to going after, up to that point it had been just hard targets, that at that point sanction was given to going after soft targets. There was a shift in not just the political but in the moral strategy as to what was a legitimate and not a legitimate target.\n\nJC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From my personal point of view I always had problems with that decision. It was a decision that I felt would lose us an enormous amount of moral ground and would not really in the long term make a difference to the war because it hardens attitudes, it is so random. You never know whether it will be children, whether it will be women, whether it will be innocent men, it just promotes a climate of fear that is across the board and in any war, as happened in the second world war where there were huge bombings of cities, Dresden and Cologne and those great cities. Look, there are no easy answers to it. Those happened because they were trying to crush Germany into submission and in a way that is what the ANC was trying to do here but didn't really have the wherewithal to carry a strategy like that to where they might have wanted it to go which was a crushing of the major forces against them. It just couldn't work like that. And now we come to the point where the perpetrators of those acts, is it necessary for them to come before the Truth Commission?... (truncated)",

        "text":"Sunday, November 14, 2010\n\nSpeech delivered by Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah during the Martyr's Day Celebration on 11,11,2010\n\nI Take refuge in Allah from the stoned devil. In the Name of Allah, The Compassionate, The Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah, The Lord of the World.\n\nPeace be on our Master and Prophet \u2013 The Seal of Prophets \u2013 Mohammad and on his Chaste Household, chosen companions and all prophets and messengers.\n\nBrothers and sisters! Peace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessing.\n\nI welcome you on the Day of Hezbollah Martyr. My special regards are for the families of the honored martyrs.\u00a0\n\nFirst, I salute the chaste souls of our great dear martyrs, and we offer them the rewards of reciting the holy surah of Al Fatiha.\n\nAllah Almighty says in His Holy Book: {In the Name of Allah, The Compassionate the Most Merciful: Allah hath purchased of the Believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the Garden (of Paradise): they fight in His Cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qoran: and who is more faithful to his Covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme}\n\nAt the beginning of our ceremony and in the presence of the martyrs' souls, we pose before this holy ayah for a while and say it is among the holy ayahs that tackle one of the great kindnesses and generosities of Allah.\n\nBrothers and sisters! Allah Al Mighty has offered us our souls. Allah also has offered us our wealth. So our souls and our wealth are His properties and not ours. Then pursuant to His generosity, bounteousness and kindness He offered them to us. Then pursuant to His kindness He approached us and demanded on us to sell Him these souls and wealth. In return, He did not give us or promise us a price that corresponds to what He is buying as is the case in any buying and selling transaction. Rather He promised us what is much greater from what we are offering in this divine transaction.\n\n{Allah hath purchased of the Believers their persons and their goods} which are originally His possession. In return He promised the Paradise which is as wide as Heavens and Earth and which includes what no eye has seen, no ear has heard and had never crossed the heart of man. This Paradise is the price in return.\n\nHow is this contract and transaction executed? They fight in His Cause. Those who have sold their persons and their goods fight in His Cause. So they fight not through claiming, not through slogans and not through reverberating words but rather through jihadi bloody action. \"They fight in the cause of Allah and slay and are slain'. They die as martyrs. 'A promise binding on Him' is an assertion by Allah Al Mighty. The truth on this promise is first that it is a promise binding on Him. 'In truth' is another assertion. Where is the third assertion? It's in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qoran. He is telling the believers that this covenant and selling contract is a commitment from Me in all divine messages and all Holy Books. It is one of the constants of belief since Allah created man until Doom's Day. This is the interpretation of 'a promise binding on Him in truth in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qoran'. The fourth assertion is in 'and who is more faithful to his Covenant than Allah?' Why are all these assertions for? That's because in other transactions or agreements the other party might fail to live up for fulfilling his promise. While it is impossible that Allah Al Mighty fails or becomes feeble or unable to fulfill His promise. Others might hesitate to fulfill their promises but Allah does not hesitate in fulfilling His promise, word and will. Some might feel remorse for their deeds as a result of something wrong in the given and many other suppositions. However Allah is The Lord, The Omnipotent, The Omniscient and The Al Mighty who owns the Heavens and Earth. 'And who is more faithful to his Covenant than Allah?\n\nThen after this equation, He is the one who granted. He is the one who demanded buying. He is the one who granted Heaven. He is the one who promised. He is the one who is felicitating and congratulating them and giving them the good tidings. 'Then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme'. He refers to the achievement as supreme. Who is referring to this achievement in this bargain as supreme? Allah, The Supreme. The True and Absolute Supremacy is referring to this achievement as supreme.\n\nAnother ayah says: {And Another (favor will He bestow), which ye do love help from Allah and a speedy victory. So give the glad Tidings to the Believers}\n\nBrothers and sisters! In our jihadi procession of belief, a group of brothers and sisters and of men and women who believed in this ayah and believed in the promise of Allah Al Mighty and trusted in His covenant sold their souls and goods to Allah. They fought with their goods and souls in the cause of Allah which is the cause of spreading righteousness, justice and freedom. The cause of Allah is the cause of defending the tortured, the oppressed, the prosecuted and the hungry. This is the cause of Allah or else Allah is not in need of our prayers, fasting, worship, endeavors, blood and money. All of that is rather in the cause of Allah.\n\nSome of these brothers and sisters passed away as martyrs and they have received the good tidings of meeting Allah and Heaven. Some of these brothers and sisters are still waiting. They are alive. They are the mujahedeen who have tasted the sense of honor and witnessed the promised victories with their very eyes. On this very track we move with this spirit of faith which we rely on with such determination.\n\nToday is November 11th. It's the Day of Hezbollah Martyr. It is the day of the most powerful and important qualitative jihadi operation in the history of the Arab-Israeli struggle. It's the day of the Prince of self-martyrs Ahmad Qasir. He is a prince because he is the founder and the pioneer in the era of self-martyrdom operations against the Zionist enemy. Truly he must be referred to as a prince. He was 18 years old if we counted his age in natural years but he who had reached a degree of knowledge, intelligence, awareness, faith, love, will and determination which enabled him to be among the most prominent figures in the life and history of this nation. On this day the martyr prince stormed into the headquarters of the Israeli military chief in Tyr killing 140 officers and soldiers thus hurling the Zionist entity in deep sadness and mourning for three full days. Through his qualitative self-martyrdom operation, he set the foundations for a different new decisive stage in resistance, fighting, jihad, operations and the true implementation of the fight of wills.\n\nMany a years ago, we in Hezbollah have chosen this day to be the day for all our martyrs and to all our leader martyrs: Sayyed Abbass, Sheikh Ragheb and Hajj Imad and all the other leader martyrs. It is the day for all the self-martyrs who followed Ahmad Qasir. It's the day for all our mujahedeen martyrs. It's the day for all our men, women, elderly and children who were killed in the confrontation fields or in massacre zones or are paying the price of belonging to this resistance and this track starting with the first martyr in our procession to the last martyr who died few weeks ago \u2013 brethren martyr Mahdi Mohammad Hirz who was twenty years old. He was martyred while he was with his brethren mujahedeen in the Islamic Resistance detonating mines and cluster bombs in our fields and territories in our resisting and jihadi Lebanese South.\n\nIt's their right on us that on this day we talk about their jihad, sacrifices, the victories of their blood on all the swords of the world, great achievements and the esteem, pride, honor, freedom, liberation, sovereignty, independence, power and capability to face the upcoming challenges which they have left for us. However I will talk about their cause and their resistance and what their resistance is confronting in the current stage because this resistance has always been their primary will which they have recorded with their voices and inked on their papers that carried their final wills.\n\nBrothers and sisters! We have now entered a very critical stage in the fate of the nation, the resistance and the region. Before these great and dear martyrs we are concerned in having a pause for contemplation and revision which is necessary for all of us and not for one group instead of the other. That's because when we face new and critical stages we must recall the previous stages. Where were we right? Where were we wrong? How did we confront? What are the elements of strength? What are the elements of weakness? We read what has taken place to know how we are to confront what is upcoming so that our stances and choices be right, appropriate and responsible.\n\nWe all feel that Lebanon today is before a new phase and a new stage, and that the resistance in particular is before a new phase of the phases of targeting the resistance. In this review, I want to reach the statue quo and set a group of points.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps with another brethren and with a various reading other divisions might be seen. As for me, I have seen that so far we have passed through five phases. That means that there are five phases and we are now living the fifth phase from the phases of targeting the resistance in Lebanon. Indeed the books which have been published in the past few days and weeks \u2013 so far I have not read any translations but only extracts which were published in newspapers and we have read whether the French book \"The President's Secret\" or the autobiography of Tony Blair or the other book for George Bush or the book of the former UNIFIL leader. All of these books help us. Indeed among these books those of George Bush and Tony Blair are of greater importance because they are v... (truncated)",

Aired 12-1a ET\n\nAired November 16, 2017 - 00:00 \u00a0 ET\n\n\n\n[00:00:10] JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: This is CNN NEWSROOM, live from Los Angeles.\n\nAhead this hour --\n\nISHA SESAY, CNN ANCHOR: As armored tanks roll down the streets of Harare, what's next for Zimbabwe after an apparent military coup?\n\nVAUSE: Donald Trump and his most excellent adventures. A thirsty U.S. President boasts America is back after his marathon trip to Asia.\n\nSESAY: And a defiant Roy Moore fights back against a growing list of accusers. Attorney Gloria Allred joins us to renew her call for a senate hearing.\n\nVAUSE: Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. Great to have you with us.\n\nI'm John Vause.\n\nSESAY: And I'm Isha Sesay. NEWSROOM L.A. starts right now.\n\nWell, Zimbabweans are anxiously waiting to see if a military takeover will bring political change. President Robert Mugabe who's ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist for almost four decades is now said to be safe under house arrest. It's unclear what political role, if any, the 93-year-old president will have in a new government.\n\nVAUSE: Military leaders denied they staged a coup but it sure looks like they have. Tanks and troops are stationed around key government buildings and state-run television is under their control. A number of officials have reportedly been arrested.\n\nAnalysts believe the military is trying to prevent the President's wife, Grace, from taking over from her husband.\n\nSESAY: CNN's Eleni Giokos is following all of this for us from Johannesburg and joins us now live. Eleni -- good to have you with us.\n\nSo the military described what is happening in Zimbabwe as a move to target criminals surrounding President Mugabe to pacify the situation in the country. What can you tell us about what is happening in the country at present?\n\nELENI GIOKOS, CNN NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean what we do know -- military on the ground, it's got all the markings of a potential coup. The military, of course, as you said, is not calling it a coup at this point in time.\n\nWe know that the airport is still under control of the military, so too is the state broadcaster. President Robert Mugabe and the first family as we understand is being confined and under house arrest so to speak. But talking with President Jacob Zuma we know that apparently everyone is fine.\n\nI was watching the Zimbabwe news broadcast this morning, of course as I mentioned it is under military control at this point in time. And mixture of news coming through this morning but one of the key elements that came through was that peace and stability needs to kind of stay in place; that people are urged to go back to work. That it's all about peace.\n\nThe military is also hosting a three-day summit in Masvingo over the weekend that is going to be focused on peace and stability. So the military I think is just going on about making sure that peace and calm remains in the country.\n\nAnd the reason that they need to do this is to ensure there isn't any kind of hard-core regional intervention. And we know that President Jacob Zuma's envoy has been sent there this morning and hopefully they're going to be engaging in some kind of negotiation and a meeting with President Jacob Zuma.\n\nBut the region is definitely on high alert because if anything does play out, any kind of violence sparked, then it becomes a regional problem and, of course, there needs to be as much calm as possible at this point in time and a very difficult and, of course, tense situation.\n\nSESAY: Jacob Zuma sending an envoy to Zimbabwe to engage in talks, as you mentioned there. But the question has to be, what is the end goal on the part of the South African envoy of Jacob Zuma being quite clear that this is a coup urging the military not to intervene or not to contravene the Zimbabwean constitution?\n\nMeanwhile, the African Union taking a more circumspect position here in all of this just saying, you know, urging restraint. So what is -- I guess, what's Zuma's end game here?\n\nGIOKOS: Well, Zuma and Mugabe we know are close friends. In fact, Mugabe invited to the World Economic Forum a little earlier this year which, of course, raised a lot of eyebrows given the fact that Zimbabwe of course, has been under international scrutiny for a lot of issues over the past 20 years or so.\n\nImportantly Jacob Zuma is now the chair of the Southern African Development Community. He has to take a diplomatic stance. And he has to also ensure that he engages in SADC (ph) protocol and African Union protocol as well. It's going to be very difficult for him to stand on the sidelines.\n\nAs to which side he's going to take, it's going to be interesting. We know that South Africa has always taken a stance of perhaps quiet diplomacy when it comes to Zimbabwe even during the times of violent land grabs by the Zimbabwean government in the early 2000s that resulted in food shortages and hyperinflation.\n\nSouth Africa perhaps stood on the sidelines and that was the view of many people. So it will be interesting to see how Jacob Zuma reacts to all of this.\n\n[00:05:00] But also remember this is a man that has been in power for almost 40 years. Is he going to stand by and just stand down? This is going to be kind of an interesting development. It's very fluid right now as you can tell.\n\nSESAY: Yes. It certainly is. I mean Robert Mugabe still held by many African leaders as, you know, this legendary figure that saw off the British there in what was Rhodesia. So it will be interesting to see how they handle this moment.\n\nEleni Giokos -- appreciate the insight and analysis. Thank you.\n\nVAUSE: Well, to Washington now and fresh off his trip to Asia, President Donald Trump says America is back, so am I; and he's restored U.S. standing in the world. And he's claiming progress on North Korea, fighting terrorism and trade.\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I also had a very candid conversation with President Xi about the need to reduce our staggering trade deficit with China and for our trading relationship to be conducted on a truly fair and equitable basis.\n\nWe can no longer tolerate unfair trading practices that steal American jobs, wealth and intellectual property. The days of the United States being taken advantage of are over.\n\n\nVAUSE: Joining us now, CNN correspondents Andrew Stevens in Beijing; Paula Hancocks is in Seoul, South Korea; and here in Los Angeles, Democratic strategist Caroline Heldman; and conservative commentator Alex Datig. I hope I got that right.\n\nThank you for being with us.\n\nOk. So Caroline -- this was a 35-minute long speech by the President. It was billed as a major announcement but it seemed more like a travel diary and most of the entries say I was wined and dined and had a really good time and everyone liked me.\n\nCAROLINE HELDMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIS: And apparently he didn't have enough to drink because he was very thirsty.\n\nVAUSE: There was that, too.\n\nHELDMAN: This is what we remember about the speech. I thought he was teasing a major trade deal as his whole point in going on this trip was really two-fold. One was to establish a clear trade policy in the region which he's failed to do. As much as he says that he has there's nothing concrete.\n\nAnd the other was to share an idea of stabilization and get everybody together to coalesce against what's happening to North Korea. That didn't happen either. He got into a petty Twitter squabble with Kim Jong-Un and then, you know, he flip-flopped on Russia after meeting with Putin.\n\nSo this was not a successful trip and his speech today really exemplifies the fact that nothing happened on this trip.\n\nVAUSE: Alex -- how do you answer that criticism? Also, the fact that, you know, what he did outline in this speech many say it's kind of overblown? It's exaggerated.\n\nALEX DATIG, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Well, I'd like to begin like this.\n\nVAUSE: Nice.\n\nDATIG: Here's to you.\n\nVAUSE: You're not the only one who's done that today, by the way.\n\nDATIG: You know, I think he accomplished a lot by bringing those UCLA basketball players home, for starters --\n\nVAUSE: That was not on the trip thought.\n\nDATIG: -- and it would have been nice if they would have said thank you.\n\nVAUSE: I think one did.\n\nDATIG: Ok. Well, if they did, then I didn't hear it.\n\nBut needless to say, I thought that was a good accomplishment. And I though, you know, I thought it was, you know, no good deed goes unpunished with this President. Nobody wants to give him any credit. He freed these students. They got admitted to UCLA, what are they doing stealing stuff?\n\nVAUSE: He didn't go to Asia to free the three students.\n\nDATIG: I understand and he could have negotiated something else had they not done that.\n\n\nHELDMAN: That's why he didn't get a trade deal -- Alex? Because he was negotiating on behalf of the basketball players? DATIG: He was looking toward a trade deal. He was looking to have\n\ngood relations.\n\n\nDATIG: He was looking to have good relations with China to help with Korea so we wouldn't have an issue with Iran because we do have this nuclear agreement that is being undone right now or in the works and so forth. So I think it was a diplomatic tour very much for him.\n\nI think it was successful. And I don't think we should have expected a lot more than just for him to have good relations so that we can have higher expectations.\n\nVAUSE: Well, one of the big goals of the trip was to build pressure on North Korea, especially to try and get to China do a lot more about North Korea and its nuclear and missile program.\n\nThis is the assessment the President had. Listen to this.\n\n\nTRUMP: During our visit, President Xi pledged to faithfully implement United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea and to use his great economic influence over the regime to achieve our common goal of a denucl...

        "text":"The Pagan MP - The Reykjavik Grapevine\n\nThe Pagan MP\n\nThe Pagan MP\n\nPublished August 19, 2005\n\nThe Liberal Party was founded in 1998 and has only three seats in parliament, but the most recent Gallup poll shows their support already at 5%. Their popularity continues to rise, however slowly, despite having lost one MP \u2013 Gunnar \u00d6rlygsson \u2013 to the Independence Party earlier this year. They have one person on City Council, \u00d3lafur F. Magn\u00fasson, who is in the position of being able to help swing votes between the majority coalition R-listinn and the Independence Party.\nThe Grapevine spoke to Liberal Party MP and co-founder Sigurj\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson, who is also the only member of parliament to be a member of \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0, an Icelandic association practicing a Norse pagan religion. In fact, he\u2019s also a go\u00f0i (chieftain) in the faith, presiding over Hegranes in northwest Iceland. \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson told us about why the party was formed, what it\u2019s like to be a pagan MP, who among him is, in his own words, \u201ca traitor\u201d and why the Independence Party is \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nWhat got you involved in politics?\n\nI lived in the northwest, and saw the population going down. As manager of public health in the region, I saw that the quota system [wherein the government lays strict outlines for how many tons of what kind of fish may be culled by every fishing company] was total nonsense. I\u2019m a biologist, and my brothers are all fishermen, and the way I looked at it, there were two things wrong with the quota system. Number one is in how they manage fish stocks, and number two is the injustice it causes. A fishing company can sell its quota to any other fishing company, taking its jobs out of town. With the quota system, it doesn\u2019t matter where the fish are caught. All of Iceland\u2019s fishing could be done off of the Westmann Islands. Also, the quota system makes criminals out of hard working fishermen \u2013 in order not to go over quota, they have to throw fish back in the ocean. Or in order not to go over the quota for a certain type of fish, they record the excess amount of cod as haddock, for example, in their logs. The quota system practically forces them to take these measures.\n\nI imagine that would deplete regional fish stocks, like what happened to the herring in Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur not too long ago.\nPerhaps the herring wasn\u2019t over-fished in Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. It could be that the ocean became colder at that time. When you fish a great amount, you leave room for recruitment [drawing in more fish stocks]. When the spawning fish stock goes up, recruitment goes down. It doesn\u2019t pay off for society to stock fish. Sometimes, when overfishing is said to be the cause of the collapse of fish stocks, the reason can also be changes in the environment, such as a colder climate.\n\nSo it\u2019s the quota system that led you to forming the Liberal Party?\n\nYes, but also, another thing that\u2019s rotten about politics in Iceland is how parties hide who is financing them. We want to try to clean up politics. Let me ask you a question: Do you think the Independence Party is right wing?\n\nYes. I believe they want further privatization, so I\u2019d say they\u2019re right wing.\n\nIn recent years, shares of the GNP that the government is using are always growing under the Independence Party\/Progressive Party coalition. If we measure them on a scale of how big the public spending is, the Independence Party is communist. We always see a rise in expenditure under them. Another thing that worries me is the burden on the taxpayer because when there\u2019s an increase in taxes, it\u2019s always on the lower salaries. The Independence Party has been doing well for big companies, but the smaller ones aren\u2019t doing so well.\n\nSo is the Liberal Party the true right-wing party in Iceland?\n\nWe don\u2019t emphasize the right, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re right of centre. We want to privatize where it\u2019s sensible, and we want fairness in business. When [consumer watchdog group] Samkeppnisstofnun went after the oil companies, the director [Stef\u00e1n M\u00e1r Stef\u00e1nsson] was sacked and his group split into two different groups because he was interfering. One main swindler who cost the public billions, Kristinn Bj\u00f6rnsson, is married to S\u00f3lveig P\u00e9tursd\u00f3ttir, and he cheated the police while she was Minister of Justice. Now he\u2019s the vice chairman on the board of Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0. [Opens a copy of Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 on the desk.] This paper is just a decoration around the government.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Gunnar \u00d6rlygsson leaving the Liberal Party, which he said had \u201cmoved too far to the left,\u201d to join the Independence Party? Were you surprised when it happened?\n\nI think his reasoning is nonsense. I was surprised, and I wasn\u2019t. We don\u2019t miss him, but we miss his seat. I think what he did was very unfair to the people who voted for him. I wouldn\u2019t like to be in his shoes. He\u2019s a traitor.\n\nDo you think, for as young and as small as the Liberal Party is, that you\u2019re taken seriously by the rest of parliament?\n\nI think we\u2019re taken seriously by the voters. What we\u2019re aiming to do and what we are doing is stirring up the establishment. We\u2019re building up an equilibrium. What we\u2019re aiming for is for the people of Iceland. I think the other parties have missed their vision. They\u2019re looking more into forming cliques than serving public interest.\n\nDo you feel as though your colleagues treat you differently for being the only pagan member of parliament?\n\nI don\u2019t think my faith matters to them. If anything, I think I get respect for that.\n\nDoes your faith shape the way you approach laws and the structure of government?\n\nI\u2019m in favour of separating faith and law, but I do think that faith marks the individual. I think that Christians and \u00c1satr\u00faar have influenced each other. For example, look at the simliarities between Christmas and the pagan J\u00f3l. We\u2019ve done that for ages, and I think this faith has shaped Icelanders\u2019 views on things. A lot of what we believe comes from the old beliefs, and has influenced how we are today.\n\nHow so?\n\nThere\u2019s the concept of \u201cdrenglyndi\u201d [noble-mindedness], the philosophy of the Old Norse, as well as H\u00e1vam\u00e1l [a collection of Old Norse proverbs], and the belief in a simple way of life. I think a lot of Icelanders can find a connection to that.\n\nSo what brought you to \u00c1satr\u00fa?\n\nMy brothers have been doing this for ages and also, this is not a \u201csupposed to do\u201d religion. In \u00c1satr\u00fa, you take responsibility for your actions and if you do wrong, you try to better yourself. It\u2019s also a cultural thing.\n\nWhat Liberal Party legislation or initiative are you proudest of?\n\nIt\u2019s like this in Iceland: there\u2019s a funny democracy here, where there are very few opposition bills that get through. What we do is we take a stand, and we influence discussion on how the government acts, although they deny it. I\u2019m sure we influenced creating a discussion on the hiding of financing by political parties. I also think we have an influence over the fisheries, and have started having influence in other countries, too. We\u2019re in very close contact with the Faroe Islands.\n\nIn what areas do you think the Liberal Party can improve?\n\nThe best thing for us is to get more into the local governments, which is very important. One thing that\u2019s important in Icelandic politics is to be frank with who you work with. We want to lift the tax burden from the lower salary earners, and the fisheries are of course one thing that we think are very important for Iceland\u2019s future. If small towns die, Iceland will lose out on a lot of possibilities for those who want to visit us. I\u2019m sure the tourists who come here want to see more than just one city.\n\nIn the life of politics, money is just one way of measuring something. There are other things. We want more discussion about fairness. What makes life more pleasant is not just about how much money is in the bank.\n\nSay I\u2019m an undecided voter and don\u2019t know which party to vote for. What reasons can you give me to vote for the Liberal Party?\n\nI think there are many reasons. It\u2019s very important to have a party that isn\u2019t in close contact with one financial provider. We speak a simple language that\u2019s not decorated with complicated words. People can count on and understand what we\u2019re saying. We\u2019re the people\u2019s party.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the Liberal Party?\n\nThe voter decides what\u2019s next. We want people to take part in politics. There\u2019s a lot of easygoing people with us.\n\nSupport The Reykjav\u00edk Grapevine!\nBook your day tours in Iceland right here!\n\n\nGo travel with Grapevine tried and recommended tours by Grapevine.

        "text":"Back to All News\n\nJanet speaking on the marriage bill\n\nSpeeches in Parliament\nJanet Rice 16 Nov 2017\n\nSomewhere, over the rainbow, way up high, there's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby. Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.\n\nThese lyrics are so fitting for the debate we're having right now. For so long lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people have only been able to dream of marriage and equality under the law. Marriage has been out of reach. Marriage has been denied. Equality has not been granted in our country's laws. I am almost overwhelmed that this dream is on the cusp of becoming a reality, because Australians voted yes.\n\nI thank them so much for doing so. To my family and me, and to so many LGBTIQ Australians, it means that our dreams will soon come true. It means that our love, our relationships and our families will be equal under the law. It means that LGBTIQ people will feel safer to hold the hand of their partner when they walk down the street. It means that LGBTIQ couples will be able to get married and to celebrate their love in front of family and friends. And it means that young LGBTIQ people will feel safer to come out, knowing that their community said yes and that who they are and who they love is respected by law.\n\nThis process of achieving marriage equality has not been easy or fast. There have been many, many LGBTIQ campaigners and their allies whose commitment and determination has led us to this point over decades. I pay tribute to the community's leaders, campaigners, families and friends who paved the way, especially when it was far more dangerous and difficult to do so.\n\nI thank especially the campaigners who have campaigned so hard over the last years, the last months and in particular the last two months. I thank the magnificent campaigners of Australian Marriage Equality Alex Greenwich, Tom Snow, Anna Brown, Tiernan Brady, Lee Carnie, Francis Voon, who is not here today, and all the rest of the amazing team. I thank Rodney Croome and Shelley Argent, from Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. I thank Felicity Marlowe, Ivan Hinton-Teoh, Corey Irlam and so many other campaigners whose work has led to the magnificent result that we got yesterday. But there are so many campaigners who aren't with us now, who have passed on prior to today, who have missed out on the joy of hearing Australians resoundingly say yes to our lives and our loves. We achieve this reform with them in mind and with their memories in our hearts.\n\nAnd I want to thank those who came before me in this place and who stood for equality, especially when it was not so widely supported. I'm proud to be in a party that has unequivocally stood with LGBTIQ people to say yes to equality over the entire history of our party. Thank you, Bob Brown, Michael Organ, Kerry Nettle, Christine Milne, Robert Simms and all of our Greens forebears in this place. Our party room today continues on your work, proudly, and we build on your work\u2014especially Sarah, who stewarded this portfolio for the Greens for many years. It's been a long road to be here.\n\nIt's been frustrating, to say the least, over the last few years to have a Prime Minister who didn't have the courage to stand up to those who want to continue to discriminate. We didn't need to have this postal survey. Parliament could have done its job way before now.\n\nThe last two months have been hard for LGBTIQ people. They have been so hard. Our identities, our relationships and our lives have been dissected and analysed and talked about. We've been told that we're not normal; our relationships are not normal; our families are not normal.\n\nFor my wife, Penny, and me, people's blatant transphobia was on full display, with people challenging Penny's trans identity and with offensive attacks on our marriage and our love. But we didn't need a yes vote to know that we are worthy of equality. Our community is one of the strongest that there is. We're more resilient than you know. We stand here on the shoulders of our LGBTIQ elders, in power and in love. We have endured. And now Australians have said yes. They agree with us. They have demonstrated that they think everyone should be treated equally under the law, and that includes being able to marry the person that they love.\n\nWe must fix the wrongs of the past and the present with this legislation. While LGBTIQ people will carry scars of discrimination, we can look forward to a brighter future with our country coming together to celebrate LGBTIQ people, our relationships and our families. So I am really looking forward to just getting on with it. It is time for parliament to do its job.\n\nThe bill before the chamber today, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, is the result of a long and deliberative process, one that I've been proud to be a part of. It began with the establishment of a Senate select committee at the end of 2016, inquiring into the exposure draft of the government's proposed marriage bill. In that inquiry, we took the government's draft bill on marriage equality, which it released with its original plebiscite legislation, as a starting point. We considered issues and ideas raised by faith groups, LGBTIQ peak bodies and community voices, civil liberties groups, legal experts, human rights organisations, marriage celebrants, doctors, scientists, local councils, state and territory governments and many Australian residents as individuals.\n\nSenators from across the parliament considered many issues, including the definition of marriage, exemptions for ministers of religion, exemptions for marriage celebrants, exemptions for religious bodies and organisations, international jurisprudence on the introduction of same-sex marriage, goods and services, and the protection of the right to freedom of conscience and religion. There are a number of these areas where my views and those of the Greens do not align with those of my colleagues across the Senate, but we came to the table and we hashed it out. And the final report from that inquiry outlined a path forward which considered the issues falling out of a change to the Marriage Act and which responded to the considerations put by the full range of organisations that we heard from. These findings are reflected in this bill. If passed, this bill will remove discrimination in marriage and allow all LGBTIQ people to marry the person they love.\n\nIt would change the definition of marriage from being between a man and a woman to being between two people, and this would finally give not only gay and lesbian Australians but bisexual, trans and gender diverse Australians, intersex Australians\u2014all Australians on the rainbow spectrum\u2014the right to claim their fundamental right to that institution. I do want to focus on the concerns from the LGBTIQ community that we have heard from the time of the Senate inquiry through until now, that they want to see marriage legislation that does not add new discriminations to our existing law.\n\nOur current law gives exemptions to religious organisations, and there is deep concern about expanding these exemptions to individuals on the basis of their personal religious beliefs. We've heard concerns about attempts to expand the scope of what the existing religious exemptions allow religious organisations to do. The Greens are acting in good faith in this debate. We want to see a bill passed by this parliament that reflects both the principles of equality and freedom from discrimination and the ability of people to act in accordance with the tenets, doctrines and beliefs of their religion. We are considering some amendments that we believe will improve the bill in this regard.\n\nIt's important, though, to make clear that this bill has already built in concessions from the Greens. This is not the bill that we would have introduced if it were up to us alone, but through the Senate committee process and through working with my colleagues across the chamber it has become apparent that this is the bill that can win the support of the parliament and finally enshrine equal marriage into law. It appears that in the committee stage debate in the week after next we will see many amendments moved by those seeking to expand the right to discriminate. I want to be clear: this is not what the Australian people voted on. This is not in keeping with the principles of equality and not what is being recommended by the legal community. We already have a set of exemptions in Australian discrimination law that religious organisations can access if they choose not to wed a same-sex or gender-diverse couple, if they choose not to provide the use of their goods and services or if they choose not to be part of any practice or action that they believe disagrees with their doctrines, tenets or beliefs.\n\nThe Greens actually think that these laws go too far, but this is not the appropriate place for anyone to add to or unwind these laws. We believe that any changes to those laws should be part of a comprehensive review of the scope and functioning of our national antidiscrimination laws and do not have to occur as part of amending our marriage laws. The Greens support the call of the UN Human Rights Committee for Australia to replace its patchwork antidiscrimination laws with a human rights act that would provide a legal framework for protecting human rights that balances these competing rights.\n\nBut that is not for this week, and achieving marriage equality does not have to wait for this reform. It's way past time for waiting. I said a few weeks ago in this chamber that the government has been playing games with the lives, loves and relationships of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, and we have had enough. The game is over. I say to the conservative members of this chamber, and indeed, in the House of Representatives: you demanded this plebi... (truncated)",
