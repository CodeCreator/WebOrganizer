        "text":"Transcription Certification and Certificate Programs\n\nCertificates in transcription are available in various specialties, including medical transcription and court reporting. These programs cover relative terminology, types of transcription work, and documentation procedures.\n\nView popular schools\n\nEssential Information\n\nA medical transcription certificate program takes about a year to complete. The program includes courses in medical terminology and writing style, health care documentation procedures and transcription equipment operation. A court reporting certificate program may take a little longer to complete. Courses cover legal terminology and business ethics as well as the procedures for several types of transcription work, such as voice recording and captioning.\n\nGraduates of these programs can apply for certification from professional organizations. While not mandatory, certification is desired by many employers. There are no requirements for certification in medical transcription, although some employers prefer it, while some certification organizations require court reporters to pass an exam.\n\nMedical Transcriptionist Certificate\n\nMedical transcriptionists translate and transcribe the voice-recordings of physicians and doctors into permanent records. Medical transcriptionists may work from a hospital or health care facility office, in a laboratory, a library or from home.\n\nMedical transcriptionist certificates are offered at a variety of vocational schools, distance learning programs and community colleges. Some programs offer basic anatomy coursework and supervised job training. Admissions prerequisites vary by program, but typically require that students possess high school diplomas or equivalency certificates. Some programs will admit non-high school graduates, assuming students demonstrate ability through work history and testing. Medical certificate programs are usually completed in one year and require around 33 hours of coursework. Typical courses subjects include:\n\n  \u2022 Basics of medical transcription\n  \u2022 Basics of medical software\n  \u2022 Medical transcription applications\n\nFind schools that offer these popular programs\n\n  \u2022 Health Care Administration\n  \u2022 Health Information and Records Admin\n  \u2022 Health Information Technology\n  \u2022 Health Management and Clinical Administration\n  \u2022 Health Unit Coordinator\n  \u2022 Health Ward Supervisor\n  \u2022 Medical Administrative Assistant or Secretary\n  \u2022 Medical Claims Examiner\n  \u2022 Medical Facilities Management\n  \u2022 Medical Insurance Billing and Coding\n  \u2022 Medical Insurance Services\n  \u2022 Medical Office Computer Technologies\n  \u2022 Medical Office Management\n  \u2022 Medical Office Specialist\n  \u2022 Medical Receptionist\n  \u2022 Medical Staff Services\n  \u2022 Medical Transcriptionist\n\nLegal Transcriptionist (Court Reporter) Certificate\n\nLegal transcriptionists, more commonly known as court reporters, are trained for what is known as 'verbatim court reporting.' Court reporters create written transcripts of court proceedings, legal meetings, depositions, conversations and speeches. Court reporting certificate programs develop legal language skills, stenotype machine proficiency, transcription accuracy. Specializations include voice recording, computer-aided transcription and captioning. Many programs also offer foundational medical terminology, business law and administrative courses.\n\nMost court reporter certificate programs recommend prior college training or work experience related to legal transcription. The majority of programs require no more than a high school diploma or the equivalent for enrollment. Court reporting certificate programs require a minimum of 42 credit hours, although they can range up to over 60, depending on the program. Typical classes required in these programs include:\n\n  \u2022 Real-time writing\n  \u2022 Speed building\n  \u2022 Stenotype machine shorthand\n  \u2022 Reporting technology\n  \u2022 Business law\n\nEmployment Outlook and Salary Information\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the field of medical transcription is expected to decline by 3% between 2014 and 2024, particularly as technology advances and older transcriptionists phase out of the field. The BLS reported that the mean yearly salary of medical transcriptionists was $35,720 in 2015.\n\nAccording to the BLS, the employment outlook had a projected 2 percent growth in the field projected between 2014 and 2024. Certified court reporters, particularly those that provide specialized services, such as broadcast captioning or Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART), are expected to be the most in demand. In May 2015, the BLS reported a median annual salary of $49,500 for court reporters.\n\nContinuing Education Information\n\nStudents may elect to pursue an associate's degree in medical transcription. Many medical transcriptionists also seek professional certification through the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), the largest professional organization for medical transcriptionists. Although the AHDI recommends possession of a certificate and at least two years of work experience or an associate's degree in medical transcription as preparation for the exam, there are no requirements for eligibility.\n\nCertification can increase marketability in the field and lead to higher wages. In addition, medical transcriptionists may take continuing education classes in technology or related administrative skills to help increase their marketability.\n\nMany certifications are available for court reporters through the National Court Reporters Association, United States Court Reporters Association and American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers. Many employers require particular certifications from one of these organizations. In addition, certifications increase court reporters' marketability and hiring potential. Associate's degree programs in court reporting are also available, and they are minimum requirement for many employers.\n\nTranscription certification is available in the field of medicine and court reporting. Associate's degree programs are available in medical transcription, while various certifications exist for court reporting in addition to associate's degree programs.\n\nNext: View Schools\n\nWhat is your highest level of education?\n\nSome College\nComplete your degree or find the graduate program that's right for you.\nHigh School Diploma\nExplore schools that offer bachelor and associate degrees.\nStill in High School\nEarn your diploma of GED.

        "text":"International Education Programs in Macedonia\nThe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or soon possibly known as Upper Macedonia, but most commonly referred to as just Macedonia, gained its independence from Yugoslavia peacefully in 1991.\n\nSince independence, Macedonia has been trying to make a huge leap in development and join the European Union and NATO.\n\nThe biggest obstacle for the country\u2019s EU and NATO membership has been the name dispute that arises from the ambiguity in\u00a0nomenclature\u00a0between the Republic of Macedonia and the adjacent\u00a0Greek region of Macedonia.\n\nHowever, this dispute has not stopped members of international bodies from supporting international education programs in Macedonia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union see education as an important step to both democratic and economic stability of the country.\n\nFor this reason, both bodies are sending aid in form of international education programs, while the country settles its naming dispute with Greece.\n\n\nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been supporting international education programs in Macedonia since 1993. USAID works directly with the country\u2019s Ministry of Education and Science in order to improve education.\n\nBy improving education, USAID hopes to foster the fledgling democracy and promote inter-ethnic relations.\n\nUSAID programs have been most heavily aimed at children. From 2013 to 2018, USAID supported the Readers are Leaders Project. This project was focused on children in all primary schools across the country. Its aim was to strengthen literacy and numeracy rates among the youth.\n\nCurrently, several other projects, such as Children with Visual Impairment Project, are active. This project is run jointly with the International Lions Club. It was started in 2014 and will last to 2019. It works to increase the quality and accessibility of education services, provide individual support to children with visual impairments and facilitates early eye-screenings.\n\nAnother joint program underway is the Youth Ethnic Integration Project (2017-2022). Through this program, USAID is promoting both civic responsibility in youth but also a cultural understanding between Macedonia\u2019s ethnic groups.\n\nThe Peace Corps\n\nSince 1996,\u00a0 when the first volunteers of this organization were welcomed by the Ministry of Education and Science, the United States Peace Corps has supported international education in Macedonia.\n\nThe Peace Corps education mission in Macedonia has been two-fold since the beginning. The first goal is to introduce new teaching methodologies to the Macedonian classroom at both the primary and secondary school levels. The second is to help with the instruction of English courses.\n\nHowever, volunteers do not just stick to the classrooms for instructions of English language. They also promote and start English speaking clubs and organizations.\n\nThe Peace Corps developed English Language clubs, drama clubs and summer camps. The Peace Corps works with three Ministries\u00a0of the country along with other international agencies and organizations to promote international education programs in Macedonia.\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe largest monetary contributor of development and international education programs in Macedonia is the European Union.\n\nIn 2017, the government of Macedonia and the European Union adopted a program of international development within Macedonia and signed a financial agreement.\n\nThe result is that the EU released $82.3 million worth of funds for the social and economic development of the country. These funds are only a small portion of the planned aid to Macedonia that stretches back to 2014.\n\nThe funds of EU are mostly directed towards the development of education in Macedonia. They are part of the financial assistance under IPA II agreement that totals to $757 million worth of aid to Macedonia. To ensure the funds are being used properly, the EU and Macedonia have set up joint monitoring committees to oversee their usage.\n\nAt the end of September 2018, the government of Macedonia held a referendum to change the official country\u2019s name from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Upper Macedonia.\n\nBy changing the name of the country the Prime Minister hopes to speed up the process of joining NATO and the EU. His opponents see this as an appeasement to bullies.\n\nLess than 50 percent of the total population voted in the referendum making it void, although the tally of those who did vote was nearly 90 percent in favor of the name change.\n\nA trend showed the youth overwhelmingly supported the change. It shows that the work of international organizations on international education programs in Macedonia was efficient in showing the youth what needs to be done in order to help the country move forward.\n\nNicholas DeMarco\n\nPhoto: Flickr",

        "text":"Skip to main content\nSelect Source:\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, located in Philadelphia, emerged from a sequence of experimental trusts. Starting from a 1740 plan for a charity school, in 1749 it became a public academy, as Benjamin Franklin had suggested in his Proposals and the Constitutions. The resulting institution was significant because never before in the history of higher education had anyone founded an educational institution on purely secular and civil objectives, without patronage from a religious group, a private sponsor, or a government. Instruction began at the academy in 1751 and included some classes for poor children. In 1755 a rechartering that denominated the school a \"College and Academy\" epitomized Franklin's commitment to higher education.\n\nDuring the eight years between 1749 and 1757 that Franklin shepherded the infant institution, he exemplified the spirit of compromise needed to moderate the conflict and bitterness that can strangle academic progress. Instead of insisting on the primarily utilitarian curriculum he preferred, he agreed to a major classical emphasis in order to attract important trustees, and thus, there emerged a balance between classical and scientific education unique in the colonies. Through the succeeding two centuries, the example of resilience set by Franklin more than once moderated academic fright over prospective change and permitted some venturesome innovations, such as the first medical school in the colonies in 1765 and the first department of botany in 1768.\n\nDespite Franklin's example, little progress occured between 1790 and 1850. The medical school was faltering, and the pioneer law professorship of 1790\u20131791, which was the first in the United States, failed to inspire the establishment of a law school until 1850. Fortunately, vigor was on the point of resuming, as proved by the addition of the Towne Scientific School in 1875, the School of Dentistry in 1878, the Wharton School of Business in 1881, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1882, and the Veterinary School in 1884. Affiliation with the Free Museum of Science and Arts, which later became the University Museum in 1938, began in 1887.\n\nThe twentieth century brought medicine forward at the university. The Graduate School of Medicine was founded in 1919, the School of Nursing in 1935, and the School of Allied Medical Professions in 1950. The university became affiliated with several hospitals and diverse medical facilities. The spectrum of academic inquiry broadened further with the founding of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in 1923, the College of Liberal Arts for Women in 1933, the Fels Institute of State and Local Government in 1937, and the Annenberg School of Communications in 1959. In 1974 the College of Liberal Arts for Women merged with its male counterpart.\n\nSuch rapid and varied growth called for taking stock, and in 1954 the university commissioned a critical five-year survey by outside specialists. Adoption of many of the suggested alterations resulted in the expenditure of $100 million for new buildings and a proliferation of experiments in curricula, student lifestyles, and community relations. Currently, the university stresses the value of interdisciplinary learning, a dedication that the establishment of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Management and Technology of Program exemplifies. The university also is committed to improving the overall quality of life in West Philadelphia. The total yearly operating expenditures of the university were $3.05 billion in 2000. Franklin's little academy, which opened its doors in 1751 to 145 pupils, had become a multiform university of approximately 22,000 students in 2000.\n\n\nBrands, H. W.

It assumed its present name in 1791. A pioneer in the areas of law, botany, chemistry, and psychology, Pennsylvania has added much to the traditional curriculum. In 1881 it opened the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce (now the Wharton School of Business), the first U.S. school of its type. Well known among the many divisions of the university are its medical and law schools; the museum, which has an extensive archaeological and ethnological collection; and the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology (opened 1892).

It was established in 1970 as Manchester Polytechnic and gained university status in 1992. Its headquarters and central campus are in the city of Manchester, and there are additional facilities in Cheshire. The university has its roots in the Manchester Mechanics' Institution (1824) and the Manchester School of Design (1838).[6]\n\nManchester Metropolitan University receives approximately 52,000 applications every year, making it the second most applied-to university in the UK after the University of Manchester.[7] It is the fifth largest university in the UK in terms of student numbers. It is an accredited member of the Association of MBAs, a member of the University Alliance, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the North West Universities Association, Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and the European University Association.\n\nThe university is home to the Manchester School of Art and the Manchester School of Theatre. Together with the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University also jointly administers the Manchester School of Architecture (MSA) with MSA students classified as students of both universities.\n\n\nThe university developed from mergers of various colleges with various specialisms, including Technology, Art and Design, i.e. Manchester Mechanics' Institution (1824) and Manchester School of Design (1838). Later, Schools of Commerce (founded 1889), Education (f. 1878) and Domestic Science (f. 1880) were added along with colleges at Didsbury, Crewe, Alsager and the former Domestic and Trades College (f. 1911), latterly Hollings College.\n\nThe painter L. S. Lowry attended Manchester School of Art in the years after the First World War where he was taught by the noted impressionist Adolphe Valette.[6] It became Manchester Polytechnic in 1970. On 1 January 1977, the polytechnic merged with the Didsbury College of Education and Hollings College, and on 1 January 1983 with City of Manchester College of Higher Education. In 1987 the institution became a founding member of the Northern Consortium. Having previously been a local authority institution, the polytechnic became a corporate body on 1 April 1989, as allowed by the terms of the Education Reform Act 1988.\n\nIt was granted university status as \"Manchester Metropolitan University\" by the Privy Council on 15 September 1992 under the provisions of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The university absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education on 1 October 1992 and the Manchester School of Physiotherapy in 2004.[8]\n\nManchester School of Physiotherapy: The Manchester School of Physiotherapy (MSOP) was a higher education institution based in Manchester, United Kingdom. It provided undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes within Physiotherapy and additionally offered NVQ level qualifications for unqualified Physiotherapy Support Workers. The School of Physiotherapy was affiliated to the Victoria University of Manchester and all degree level courses were validated and conferred by this institution.[9]\n\nThe School was officially formed in 1991, through the amalgamation of the Manchester Royal Infirmary (M.R.I.) and the Withington Hospital Schools of Physiotherapy. From these two institutions it can date its history back to 1911 and during the 1980s via its M.R.I. routes, became the first NHS School of Physiotherapy to offer a three-year undergraduate honours degree programme.[8] The Manchester School of Physiotherapy was based at the Manchester Royal Infirmary and from 1993, was housed within purpose built accommodation converted from the hospital's former outpatient department. The academic building consisted of two large raked lecture theatres, a number of practical rooms, a gymnasium, seminar rooms, a library, office facilities and a student common room.\n\nIn 2004 the Manchester School of Physiotherapy officially joined the Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and initially became known as the Department of Physiotherapy. It was at this point the last NHS School of Physiotherapy to join a UK higher education institution.[8] It subsequently became the Department of Health Professions and is currently based at the Birley Fields Campus of MMU in Hulme.[10] All students now have their degrees conferred from the Manchester Metropolitan University.\n\nThe final cohort of Manchester School of Physiotherapy students graduated in 2005, with their degrees being conferred by the University of Manchester.\n\nManchester Royal Infirmary School of Physiotherapy Badge\n\n\nExercise and Sports Science Building at Cheshire Campus.\nThe All Saints Building on the All Saints Campus, Chorlton-on-Medlock\nThe administration building of the Didsbury Campus\n\nThe university was previously located on seven sites, five in Manchester (All Saints, Aytoun, Didsbury, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Hollings) and two in Cheshire (Alsager and Crewe), and has rationalised its estate, reducing the number of sites to two. The university has moved the work of the Alsager campus to Crewe. The Aytoun campus closed in 2012 when a new Business School opened on the All Saints Campus. Since 2011, the university has been engaged in a \u00a3350 million investment programme involving the largest physical change to its estate since its foundation. In 2014 the Elizabeth Gaskell, Hollings and Didsbury campuses were closed and the faculties moved to All Saints and the new Birley campus[11]\n\nAll Saints Campus[edit]\n\nStatue of John Dalton by William Theed outside the university's building in Chester Street\n\nAll Saints campus is one of the university's 2 campuses.\n\nThe Faculty of Humanities, Languages and Social Science is split between the Geoffrey Manton and Mabel Tylecote buildings. The Geoffrey Manton Building accommodates the English, History and Economic History, Information and Communications, Politics and Philosophy, and Sociology departments. The Languages departments are housed in the Mabel Tylecote Building.[12]\n\nThe John Dalton Building, on Chester Street is the home of the Faculty of Science and Engineering.[13] It comprises four schools: the School of Healthcare Sciences, the School of Computing, Mathematics & Digital Technology, the School of Engineering, and the School of Science and The Environment. To the rear of the John Dalton Building is JD tower, housing the university's main science laboratories including IRM,[14] the Institute for Biomedical Research into Human Movement and Health.\n\nThe Manchester School of Art on the All Saints Campus is composed of four departments: The Manchester School of Architecture (operated jointly with the University of Manchester Faculty of Humanities); Department of Art; Department of Design; Department of Media.[15] The faculty houses the Holden Gallery which has a continuous programme of exhibitions and is open free to the public.[16] The university has invested in improving the Manchester School of Art building granting \u00a335 million to facilitate three changes including: a new building for the faculty, refurbishment of the workshops and renovation of the studios. In 2014 the building was nominated for the Stirling Prize.[17][18]\n\nNew premises costing \u00a375 million for the Faculty of Business and Law have been built on All Saints Campus and the Business School re-located to this building from the Aytoun Campus in 2012.[19] It will house more than 5,000 students and 250 staff.[20] The new building is an original architectural concept with three towers under a single glass roof.[citation needed] Green credentials are an integral part of the building's design which incorporates solar panels and heat pumps to power the building and a rain water recycling scheme.[20] The Manchester Law School is in the Sandra Burslem building which opened in 2003.\n\nThe university library, renamed the Sir Kenneth Green Library, is on the All Saints campus. It houses a number of special collections mainly relating to the fine and applied arts, like the Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection, a collection of 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards.[21] The library is in the All Saints Building where it occupies three floors. It was planned as a single central library in 1972 but after the mergers with the Didsbury College of Education and Hollings College it became a central library and administrative centre for seven library sites. From 1975 a catalogue was produced with the aid of the Birmingham Libraries Co-operative Mechanisation Project.[22] From 1992 the library was part of the Consortium of Academic Libraries in Manchester (CALIM) which was extended in 2002 to become NoWAL, the North West Academic Libraries.[23]\n\nThe John Dalton Tower and John Dalton West on the All Saints Campus\n\nThe Hollings Faculty offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in food, clothing, and hospitality studies and related fields. Formerly in Fallowfield, the faculty is now housed in the Righton Building on the All Saints campus, a former department store.\n\nCheshire Campus[edit]\n\nThe second campus is based in Crewe, Cheshire.

        "text":"Speech\/Language Delays & Reading\/Writing Challenges\n\nSpeech\/Language Delays & Reading\/Writing ChallengesAre you aware of the connection between speech & language delays and reading\/writing challenges?\n\nChildren who have speech and language challenges run the risk of developing difficulties with written expression.\n\nFor example, children are probably going to spell words the way they pronounce them. If a child says \u201cbroder\u201d for \u201cbrother\u201d in conversation, that is how \u201dbrother\u201d is going to appear in the child\u2019s journal. The same is true for grammar and syntax. If a child says \u201cThe dog runned away\u201d, that\u2019s the way it will appear in written expression.\n\nThe bottom line is this: children can only write as well as they can speak.\n\nCommunication challenges can also interfere with learning to read.\n\nA child who doesn\u2019t hear the difference between the \u201cw\u201d and \u201cr\u201d sounds will likely have difficulty learning that an \u201cr\u201d says \u201cer\u201d. The challenge will get worse when that same child has to differentiate between short \u201ci\u201d and \u201ce\u201d to figure out if a word says \u201cpig\u201d or \u201cpeg\u201d. The ultimate challenge will present itself when intermediate readers have to differentiate between words like \u201cvision\u201d and \u201cfission\u201d and \u201ctransition\u201d and \u201ctranslation\u201d.\n\nParents can prevent many of these academic difficulties by getting their children enrolled in appropriate intervention\u2026..the earlier, the better.\n\nRemember that prevention is a lot more effective and less expensive than remediation. To prevent academic struggles, children must be seen by speech- language pathologists who understand the skills needed to succeed in school. To address these academic struggles in school-aged children, parents must seek professionals who can identify the speech and language causes of the challenges and then treat the problems from the ground up.\n\nFollow us on Facebook!",

        "text":"The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at SUNY New Paltz serves approximately 600 students each year. SUNY reports that 81.3 percent of New Paltz EOP students graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in six years.\n\nThe New Paltz program is one of the State University of New York\u2019s Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP), which provide academic, financial, and student support services to low-income students who are not academically prepared for college-level work. These programs can demonstrate college completion rates that approach or exceed that of non-participants.\n\nThe EOP experience at New Paltz begins with EOP-specific sessions during freshman orientation. Students are offered three to four sessions to choose from, which address topics such as academic requirements and the advising system. Students also take Math and English placement exams during the summer before freshman year.\n\nEach student is assigned an academic advisor who they meet with over the course of their time in the program. Prior to their initial meeting, advisors review student records, including high school transcripts, Regents exams and SAT scores, as well as placement exam scores in order to develop a baseline understanding of students\u2019 potential academic needs. Advisors meet with first-year students on an individual basis three to four times a semester and develop a graduation plan with students during freshman year. During their sessions together, advisors also focus on students\u2019 social-emotional needs and pay close to attention to the extent that students are developing a sense of community and feel engaged on campus.\n\nDuring the fall of freshman year students participate in a credit-bearing seminar course that is taught by their EOP academic advisor. The seminars address topics such as time management, research, note-taking skills, and test-taking skills. The seminars include a writing component and also expose students to different careers. Each section of the freshman seminar is taught at the same time to provide opportunities for plenary sessions that bring all EOP first-year students together.\n\nTutoring is mandated for all first-year students. Tutors typically have graduate degrees and provide tutoring in small group sessions.\n\nEOP staff closely monitor student performance over the course of the semester. Advisors maintain regular contact with professors and also review student performance data throughout the semester. Students who are on academic probation are required to meet with their advisors eight times per semester. Tutoring is also mandated for students who are on academic probation.\nFor upperclassmen, SUNY New Paltz focuses on providing students with leadership development opportunities. Upperclassmen are provided with the opportunity to serve as peer mentors for first-year students. SUNY New Paltz encourages EOP students to study abroad and has been recognized nationally for supporting EOP students who study abroad. Upperclassmen are also encouraged to participate in internships.\n\nSUNY New Paltz also encourages EOP alumni to connect with current students. A biannual conference is held on campus which provides alumni and current students an opportunity to meet.",

Read on for accounting career information & tax attorney opportunities.\n\n  \u2022 slide 1 of 5\n\n    Accounting Career Information Tax Attorney\u00a0Tax attorneys maintain confidential records and tax information of their clients. The broad aspects of a tax attorney job description include:\n\n    \u2022 researching and analyzing federal and state laws, and the related case laws\n    \u2022 communicating and negotiate with federal, state, and local governments for their clients\n    \u2022 offering advice on tax related issues to their clients.\n\n    Image Credit: Kabir\n\n  \u2022 slide 2 of 5\n\n\n    A review of a tax attorney job description reveals that the main role of a tax attorney is negotiating on behalf of clients in trouble with authorities such as the IRS and state tax authorities to provide relief such as reduction of fines and removal of liens, to name a few. They also represent the client before the court and argue the client\u2019s case if the tax dispute reaches the court.\n\n    Tax attorneys also negotiate with the tax authorities for a compromise to settle back taxes. They also help businesses that owe the IRS and other tax authorities more than they can afford to pay prepared restructuring proposals that allow the business to escape most penalties.\n\n    Another area of tax attorney\u2019s job profile is providing tax related advice and identifying potential trouble spots in the organizational and accounting set up, payroll processing, and other areas, to help clients preempt trouble with the authorities, rather than trying to solve the trouble.\n\n    The tax attorney also helps clients set up trust funds, stock portfolios, and other structures to secure the best tax deal, besides providing general tax advice, including estate, property, and gift taxes.\n\n  \u2022 slide 3 of 5\n\n\n    A career as a tax attorney is a highly technical and specialized field that requires a minimum of seven years of college education, including four years of any undergraduate program and three years in a law school, followed by securing a license to practice in a state by passing the bar exam.\n\n    One good entry path is a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) in Accounting that offers subjects such as financial, managerial and cost accounting, income tax, fundamentals of auditing, and business law, and an internship.\n\n    Another more common path is the bachelor\u2019s law degree program that covers the basics of taxation such as federal income tax, tax practices, and procedures, corporate and partnership tax, and other courses.\n\n    The three year master\u2019s degree in law allows further specialization in areas such as general business taxation, international taxation, financial services, and other similar courses. Another option is to select electives that focus on tax laws.\n\n    The basic entry-level qualification for a lawyer is the degree from a law school, followed by passing the bar exam to obtain a license to practice within the state. Depending on the state, the bar exam consists of a written test and an ethics exam.\n\n  \u2022 slide 4 of 5\n\n\n    The accounting career information tax attorney profile indicates that the qualification and license notwithstanding, establishing a reputation as a specialized tax attorney requires years of experience handling debt management cases with the IRS and working with real live taxpayers.\n\n    Apart from a law degree and experience, to be a successful tax attorney also requires extensive knowledge on how to communicate and analyze financial data and how to keep accounting records, besides good math skills. Tax attorneys need a sound understanding of contemporary finance and accounting principles to evaluate and assess complicated tax issues.\n\n    The best tax attorney are those with good communication skills, negotiation skills, attention to detail, and analytical acumen. Successful tax attorneys also need to interpret data in unorthodox and unconventional ways to create custom plans that suit the client's unique situation.\n\n  \u2022 slide 5 of 5\n\n    Job Prospects\n\n    A review of the accounting career information tax attorney profile shows that they remain in demand, especially among small business owners who consider their tax attorney at par with the accountant. Most of the tax attorneys work either as freelancers or under established tax attorneys in law firms. Some very large corporations may hire their in house tax attorneys as well.\n\n    2010 figures indicate a median salary level for a tax lawyer with less than two years of experience at $86,500, and the median salary for tax lawyers with at least eight years of experience at $165,700.\n\n    The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there were about 750,000 attorneys in the United States in 2008, with the number of job opportunities for all lawyers expected to increase by 13 percent through 2018.",

        "text":"As a baby, your child discovered first how to make sounds, then how to make those sounds into real words (\"mama\" and \"dada\" may have slipped out as early as 4 or 5 months). By the time she was a year old, she was trying to imitate the sounds around her (though you probably heard her babbling away in a language that only she could understand).\n\nNow comes a period of extraordinary growth, as your toddler goes from speaking a few simple words to asking questions, giving directions, and even telling you stories she's made up.\u00a0\n\nWhen and how it develops\n\nHere's a general idea of how you can expect your toddler's language skills to progress. Keep in mind that every child is different.\n\nIf your child varies somewhat from these general guidelines, don't worry. (If he's being raised in a\u00a0bilingual environment, the number of words he can speak may be split between the two languages he's learning.)\n\n12 to 18 months\n\nYour toddler may not be saying much yet, but he\u2019s listening and starting to understand. Over the next few months, he'll try to copy words, and you may hear him babbling away as if he's having a real conversation. He'll even practice speech sounds, raising his tone when asking a question. He might say \"Up-py?\" when asking to be carried, for example.\n\nBy his first birthday, your child will probably begin to use one or two words meaningfully. When you say \u201cchair\u201d or \u201cball,\u201d he may look at it or point to it. You can help him by naming things as you talk to him. Many toddlers love hear animal names and sounds, so when he hears \"duck\" he thinks \"quack.\" He's also learning his own body parts, and you can build on this by playing naming games: \"Where is your nose? Oh, there it is!\"\n\nYour toddler is learning to tell you what he needs, but may combine words with gestures. He'll reach his arms toward his favorite toy, for example, and say \"ball.\" Some toddlers develop a whole\u00a0sign language\u00a0of gestures to communicate with their parents. Your child might put his fingers to his lips when he wants food, for example.\n\nDon't worry if he struggles to get his meaning across now and then. This frustration is actually a healthy sign that he's trying hard to communicate and cares whether you understand him.\n\nBy 18 months, your toddler will probably start making many common consonant sounds, such as t, d, n, w, and h. Learning to make these sounds is a big event, and leads to big gains in vocabulary. Don't expect to hear all these sounds in actual words yet. But you may hear him repeating them when he's alone in his crib or playing with his toys.\n\nBy 18 months, your toddler may be speaking only a few words \u2014 five to 20 is typical \u2014 but he'll understand about 50 to 100. And he'll may be able to understand and begin to follow your directions even if they involve two separate actions. For example, he'll understand, \"Pick up those building blocks and put them in the toy chest.\"\n\nWhen to be concerned: If your child isn't saying any words by 12 months (including \"mama\" or \"dada\"), didn't babble before his first birthday, is unable to point to things, doesn't respond to others or his name, or you still can't understand a word he's saying by 18 months, check in with your pediatrician.\n\n19 to 24 months\n\nYour child now understands simple commands and questions. Each month she'll add more words to her vocabulary. Many of these words will be nouns common things, such as \"spoon\" and \"car.\"\n\nWhen you're reading a picture book to your child, ask her to point out items you name. Even though she may not use the word herself, she can likely pick out a cow or a duck. She may also try to name new things by \u201coverextending\u201d the words she already knows, so that all new animals are called \"dogs,\" for example.\n\nBy her second birthday, your child may begin stringing together simple two- to four-word sentences. These will likely have a noun and a verb and be directly related to her life, like \"Dog bark\" or \"Go car.\" English is tricky, so you might hear some funny grammar like \"Me go.\" She may be using around 100 words, but may understand several hundred, and is capable of paying attention to what you say.\n\nAs her sense of self matures, she'll use \"me\" to refer to herself, and she's likely to tell you what she likes and doesn't, what she thinks, and what she feels. You may also hear her say, \"Jenny want milk\" or \"Baby throw,\" for instance. She may start to understand that you have different opinions than she does, and may feel possessive of her favorites, letting you know which toys are \"hers.\"\n\nWhen to be concerned: If your child rarely attempts to speak or imitate others and doesn't seem to get frustrated when you can't understand what she wants, you may want to ask at your next doctor visit.\n\n25 to 30 months\n\nBetween ages 2 and 3, most 2-year-olds understand at least 200 to 300 words and add as many as 10 new ones to their vocabulary every day. He'll string nouns and verbs together to form complete but simple sentences, such as \"I eat now.\"\n\nBy now, your child may also be able to understand and respond to who, where, and what questions. If you ask him, \"Where are your shoes?\" he may go look for them. He's also starting to get the hang of pronouns, such as \"I,\" \"me,\" and \"you.\"\n\nNow that he has a bigger vocabulary, your toddler will begin to experiment with sound levels. For a while he may yell when he means to speak normally and whisper softly when answering a question, but he'll find the volume soon enough.\n\nHe may also try talking about events that happened in the past, so you'll hear him say things like \"I runned\" or \"I swimmed.\" Sure, it's cute, but it also shows that he's picking up on the basic grammar (that you add a d sound to a word if it happened yesterday, for example, and an s sound to make things plural).\n\nWhen to be concerned: If you notice that he doesn't use two-word phrases, consistently\u00a0echoes your familiar expressions, or doesn't respond to his name, bring it up with your child's doctor. This can be an early sign of a developmental delay.\n\n31 to 36 months\n\nBy the time she's 3, your child will be a more sophisticated talker. She may know as many as 900 words, and use about 300 regularly. It's not just quantity, though. She's beginning to truly understand adjectives, such as dirty and clean. She\u2019s using more verbs, such as walk, run, or play, and adding prepositions such as over, under, and behind.\n\nShe'll be able to carry on a conversation and even adjust her tone, speech patterns, and vocabulary to fit the person she's talking to. She may use simpler words with a peer (\"I need go potty\") but more complex sentences with you (\"I need to go to the bathroom\"). She'll also understand simple rules of grammar and use plurals and pronouns correctly.\n\nBy now, other adults, including strangers, should be able to understand almost everything your child says, which means you won't have to do as much translating. She'll even be a pro at saying her first and last name and her age.\n\nWhen to be concerned: By the time she\u2019s 3, if your child doesn't understand simple instructions, doesn\u2019t ask questions, or can't pronounce vowels, check in with your pediatrician.\n\nA word on stuttering: If your child\u00a0stutters, it doesn't necessarily signal a problem. Stuttering is a normal phase, especially when her thinking and language skills are expanding so fast.\n\nParents can help by speaking slowly and clearly, and pausing. Try not to complete sentences or interrupt your child, just give her time with good eye contact and non-verbal feedback like patiently nodding your head. But if stuttering continues for more than six months, or if it's bad enough that he tenses his jaw or grimaces in an effort to get the words out, talk with his doctor about it.\n\nYour role\n\nYou can help your child's language skills\u00a0at any age providing a stimulating environment. The most important things to do:\n\n  \u2022 Talk.\u00a0Research shows that parents who talk to their baby play a critical role in their child's language development. You don't need to chatter nonstop, but speak to your child whenever you're together. Describe what you're doing, point things out, ask questions, sing songs. (Although some baby talk is okay, resist the temptation to coo and babble. Your child will learn to speak well by listening to you speak well.)\n  \u2022 Read.\u00a0Reading to your child\u00a0is a great way to expose him to new vocabulary, the way sentences are put together, and how stories flow. But don't just read the words \u2013 ask your child to find things in the illustrations or tell you what happened to the characters.\n  \u2022 Listen.\u00a0When your child talks to you, be a good listener \u2013 look at her and be responsive. She's more likely to speak up when she knows you're interested in what she's saying.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned\n\nYou\u2019re the best judge of your child\u2019s progress, and children develop at different rates. Still, it it\u2019s a good idea to speak with his pediatrician if your child is showing these signs age 3:\n\n  \u2022 He has trouble understanding the simplest directions and suggestions\n  \u2022 He shows little or no progress over a period of 3 to 6 months, or loses skills he had\n  \u2022 Others can't understand him most of the time\n  \u2022 He still depends on physical gestures to communicate (like pointing to the cookie jar instead of asking for a cookie)\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of when to worry, see our\u00a0warning signs of a language delay or\u00a0hearing problem. Your doctor's office, daycare provider, or local school might also be able to direct you to an early intervention program in your area that will provide free screening for language problems.\n\nIf needed, your doctor will refer your child to a\u00a0pediatric speech-language pathologist\u00a0for an evaluation. (A searchable directory of certified therapists can be found on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's\u00a0website.)\u00a0\n\nWhat comes next\n\nAs your child grows, she'll become more of a chatterbox. There might be moments when you long for those peaceful quiet days, but for the most part, you'll ... (truncated)",

Also known as placement agencies, these priceless resources have connections with companies of all kinds and sizes. Positions may range from part time to full time, temporary to permanent. People who contact employment agencies to find work could be placed in just the right vocation in just the right industry. However, at the same time one must also pay a small fee to the agency for their service. Depending on the agency, the fees will either be paid up front or deducted from the employee's pay cheque.\n\nThe first employment agency began over one hundred years ago and the idea has been in use ever since. Now, there are various categories of this type of organization. Some types of employment agencies offer general or industrial labor; others specialize only in executive employment. When it is companies that have projects that need temporary workers, they usually contact a staffing agency. When the company in need contacts the staffing agency,employees are not responsible for any fees. The company pays the staffing agency for their service and the staffing agency pays the employee. Positions may be full time, part time or seasonal. A temporary position may last for several days or several months.\n\nEmployment agencies offer a many services. They might be responsible for everything from screening employees to recruiting those with specific job skills. In some cases they can be used as a company's human resource department. Not to be left out, agencies also offer several options to jobseekers as well. For example, in temp to hire positions a person placed in a temporary slot may be hired on permanently after a certain amount of days. If the company does not find an individuals's skills suitable for the job, he or she may move on to the next assignment. There are others who prefer to keep their work situations temporary.\n\nEmployment agencies may be found in just about every large city on the map. While some are small and work with businesses in the immediate and neighbouring areas, others span nationwide. Since certain types of jobs could call for certain types of employees, those who have specific skills or vocations often choose to go with specialized agencies. Medical or IT staffing agencies know the ins and outs of their industries and can do better at making sure both companies and employees are compatible. They know what licenses and certifications are needed and will ensure that each employee is qualified to do the required job duties.\n\nChristine Gray is a recognized authority on the subject of employment.
