        "text":"Adventure Time with Finn and Jake Wiki\n\nThe Fool\n\n2,818pages on\nthis wiki\nAdd New Page\nTalk0 Share\n\nThe Fool was a vampire gnome and a member of the Vampire King's court.\n\n\nMarceline fought The Fool centuries ago when she was on a mission to protect the remaining humans from vampires. While most vampires are malevolent, The Fool is more of a mischievous child; in one of his witless misadventures, he lost one of his fangs to a box turtle. Despite this, he is still a vampire which means he subsists on human blood. He is one of the first vampires Marceline ever targeted, and while she hunted him with deadly earnest, he regarded the whole thing as a game of tag. Marceline managed to defeat him and gain his power of flight and levitation.\n\nThe vampires are resurrected after Princess Bubblegum removes Marceline's vampire essence from her. After a short period, the Vampire King and his court manifest. While the other members of the vampire court debate what to do, The Fool proposes taking things easy, suggesting that they just get an apartment. Most of the court part ways with the group, but The Fool hangs around with the king.\n\nThe Fool is the first vampire Marceline kills in stakes in Vamps About. Marceline dispatches with him with absolutely no effort. The Fool casually shrugs off being stabbed in his usual carefree fashion.\n\n\nThe Fool has the body of a gnome with long, noodly limbs on a short, round frame. He has a Petit Goatee style beard, a single fang, light blue eyes with diamond-shaped pupils, and dresses barefoot with a grey, long-sleeved shirt, dark, navy pants dress, and a similarly colored pointy hat.\n\n\nAs a vampire with magical powers, the Fool can levitate and fly by his own means.\n\n\n  \u2022 He is named after the unnumbered trump or Major Arcana card in traditional Tarot decks. The Fool card represents innocence, spontaneity, and free-spiritedness. Similarly, Fool behaves like an incautious, carefree child. In the reversed position, the card can represent recklessness or a disregard obvious dangers, which is what leads to the eponymous vampire's downfall.\n  \u2022 He is seen playing a bongo with the others in \"Vamps About\"\n  \u2022 Jake describes him looking as if \"a baby snake was a baby baby\".\n  \u2022 The Fool had both his fangs when he was revived, but the Vampire King ripped it out of his mouth.\n  \u2022 He is the only vampire not to be encountered by Finn and Bonnibel, as well as the only vampire to stay with the Vampire King.\n\nAd blocker interference detected!\n\nWikia is a free-to-use site that makes money from advertising.

        "text":"\"Wait... You're that talent agent from the party.\"\n\"I assure you, I am something far more ruthless than a Hollywood agent.\"\nHedy Lamarr and Damien Darhk\n\n\"Helen Hunt\" is the sixth episode of the third season of DC's Legends of Tomorrow, and the thirty-ninth episode overall. It aired on November 14, 2017.\n\n\nWhen the Legends track down an anachronism in 1930s Hollywood, they discover it's none other than a time-displaced Helen of Troy and she's just started a war between two film studios. As the Legends try to fix history and return Helen to the Bronze Age, things get complicated when they are blindsided by the appearance of a former enemy. Sara contemplates an offer she has made, which would make the Legends leave the anachronisms be. Meanwhile, Stein and Jax find themselves in an unusual predicament.[src]\n\n\n\nSpecial appearance by\n\nGuest starring\n\n\n\n\"Helen Hunt\" begins with a scene set in Hollywood in 1937 \u2014 we see in the background shots of a film creation. An \"extra\" is shouted at for not being on set in time and the chief stops creation, he figures the extra ought to be the superstar. When asked her name, she says she's Helen of Troy.\n\nOn the Waverider, Ray is dealing with isolating Stein and Jax and the investigation they're experiencing detonates. At the point when the residue settles, it's uncovered that Jax and Stein have exchanged bodies. Called to the extension, the Firestorm couple imparts to the gathering that they've exchanged bodies.\n\nSara tells the gathering that there's been a time misplacement in 1937 and the gathering heads to Hollywood. Nate, Amaya, and Zari are accomplishing recon work when Helen makes a couple of the cast individuals begin battling.\n\nOutside of the studio, Helen gets into a vehicle with Eddie Rotherberg and the pair drives away.\n\nThe group goes to a chunk of Hollywood socialites where Stein begins chatting with a youthful Hedy Lamarr \u2014 who still can't seem to act in a film when they notice Helen gets this show on the road the ball.\n\nZari utilizes her forces to make Helen spill her beverage on herself with the goal that she needs to go tidy up. Sara and Zari approach Helen in her changing area attempting to persuade her to go with them.\n\nBack outside at the ball, the gathering runs into Damien Darhk, who has been filling in as Helen's operator. Damien's brought along Kuasa, who starts conversing with Amaya.\n\nDamien and Sara leave the gathering trying to work out an arrangement that would permit Damien to keep living in 1937. While the two are talking, Nate, Mick, and Ray begin battling once again Helen, which begins spilling once again different visitors.\n\nDamien discloses to Sara that the gathering needs to back up and return to 2017 else he'll execute them all.\n\nThe gathering rendezvous on the Waverider to talk about their further plans and they conclude that Sara, Zari, and Amaya will go attempt to convince Helen to go along with them on the boat so they can get her back in time.\n\nJax and Stein keep attempting to switch the impacts of their experimentation.\n\nSara, Zari, and Amaya get to Helen's home and take out her right hand so they have direct access. They have a go at persuading her to go along with them when administrators from the two motion pictures plummet on her home and start taking shots at one another. Sara attempts to get Helen to safe spot while Zari and Amaya take out the shooters. The gathering can leave the scene with Helen.\n\nThe women return to the boat and take a stab at getting some data from Gideon when everything goes disconnected. They make the association that since Hedy Lamarr was not, at this point an on-screen character in this timespan, the mechanical advances that made Gideon didn't exist.\n\nStein, despite everything caught in Jax's body, volunteers to help find Hedy an acting line of work and leaves the Waverider to do as such. Visiting Hedy at her call community work, Stein convinces her to converse with a film official and on out of the structure, they run into Damien and Nora Darhk, who leaves them both speechless.\n\nIn the wake of discovering Jax and Stein have exchanged bodies, Damien releases Stein and Hedy since he starts giggling. Damien and Nora tracks Stein and Hedy down and starts stifling Stein when the remainder of the Legends appear.\n\nSara challenges Damien to a duel utilizing blades.\n\nBack on the Waverider, Zari and Amaya have remained behind with Helen. Zari and Amaya are hanging out in the payload straight when Kuasa, in her water structure, enters the boat and starts assaulting the pair.\n\nWhile Sara's battling Damien, Ray, Nate, and Mick take a stab at battling Nora, who can control the entirety of their forces and use them against the Legends.\n\nOn the Waverider, Kuasa is picking up the upperhand over Zari and Amaya.\n\nNora overwhelms Sara when Hedy Lamarr persuades Jax and Stein to converge into Firestorm to prevent Nora from executing Sara. Firestorm's ready to stop Damien and Nora and the two transport away from the scene.\n\nAt the point when Firestorm parts separated, Jax and Stein have come back to their own bodies.\n\nKuasa and Amaya are as yet battling about the emblem on the Waverider. Kuasa uncovers that she's Amaya's granddaughter. Helen shows up and betrays Kuasa, who at that point goes to her water structure and leaves the Waverider.\n\nHedy approaches Stein in the wake of conversing with a film executive, she's gotten her next film job.\n\nBack on the Waverider, Ray has taken Sara to the medbay where Gideon has set her in a restoratively instigated trance like state to recuperate throughout the following not many days.\n\nZari is conversing with Helen, who despite everything has a go at persuading her to not put her back in the exact timeframe. Zari discovers that Helen vanishing didn't influence the course of events so she's ready to assume here to a position other than Troy. To keep her safe, Zari drops off Helen on none other the Themyscira.\n\n\n\n\nPreparation ran from August 23 until August 31, 2017. Shooting began on September 1 and ran until September 14, 2017.[1]\n\n\n  \u2022 The episode title \"Helen Hunt\" has two meanings. The first is the hunt for Helen of Troy and the other is the name of a popular actress, tying into the Hollywood setting of the episode.\n  \u2022 Sara says, \"must be Tuesday\" upon learning Martin and Jax switched bodies. This is a pun on the phrase \"must be Tuesday\", which refers to something crazy or strange that occurred, but is actually a common occurrence in one's everyday life, as well as referencing the day of the week which Season 3 episodes of DC's Legends of Tomorrow aired.\n  \u2022 Martin scolds Jax, claiming that the oldest movie he's seen is the 1984 film Police Academy.\n  \u2022 Martin expresses his belief that the 1942 film Casablanca is nothing without Ingrid Bergman (who portrayed Ilsa Lund) and the 1940 film The Philadelphia Story is nothing without Katharine Hepburn (who portrayed Tracy Lord).\n  \u2022 Martin and Jax switching bodies is an homage to the novel Freaky Friday and its various adaptations, itself referenced by Ray and Jax.\n  \u2022 When discussing Hedy Lamarr, Jax-in-Stein comments that Stein-in-Jax was interested in \"doing the nasty in the pasty\", a reference to a scenario in the Futurama episode \"Roswell That Ends Well\", where series protagonist Philip J. Fry inadvertently became his own grandfather during a trip back to Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.\n  \u2022 As Nora is about to kill Sara, she exclaims, \"Bye bye, birdie\", referencing the musical of the same name.\n  \u2022 This episode marks the first appearance of Themyscira in the Arrowverse, which is the home of the DC Comics female superhero Wonder Woman.\n  \u2022 Themyscira is portrayed with the famous view of Navagio Beach on Zakynthos Island, Greece.\n  \u2022 Hedy Lamarr invented Frequency-hopping spread spectrum, the technology used in wireless communications (smart\/cell phones).\n    \u2022 She worked briefly as a telephone operator before making her big break in Hollywood, allowing her to patent her technology, which (among other things) allowed the invention of the cell phone. Sadly she never earned any money from her invention because by the time anyone used it her patent had expired. Our modern world would not be possible without her invention, which she created during WWII to use in torpedo's so they could not be tracked or jammed. She was not taken seriously(because she was a Woman) by the military brass and her tech was not used in the torpedo until years later after WWII. The Idea was based on the same concept that makes a player piano work. Hedy Lamarr was a genius.\n  \u2022 When Hedy tells Jefferson and Stein to merge, she calls Firestorm \"Nuclear Man\", referencing the episode of the same name in Season 1 of The Flash\u200b, which marked the debut of Firestorm.\n  \u2022 The episode mainly takes place at Warner Bros. Pictures Studios. Warner Bros Pictures owns DC Comics.\n\n\n  \u2022 At the K&G party, Nate mispronounces Cecil B. DeMille's name; it's \"Sess-ill\", not \"See-sill\".\n  \u2022 Sara's hair at the party when Dahrk arrives goes from slightly curly\/wavy to very curly, then back to slightly curly\/wavy. This is most noticeable before and after she and Zari confront Helen.\n\n\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.",

        "text":"The 101ers\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nThe 101ers\nOrigin London, England\nYears active\n  \u2022 1974\u00a0(1974)\u20131976\u00a0(1976)\n  \u2022 (one-off reunion: 2003)\nAssociated acts\nPast members\n\nThe 101ers were a pub rock band from the 1970s playing mostly in a rockabilly style, notable as being the band that Joe Strummer left to join The Clash.[1] Formed in London in May 1974, the 101ers made their performing debut on 7 September at the Telegraph pub in Brixton,[2] under the name 'El Huaso and the 101 All Stars'. The name would later be shortened to the '101 All Stars' and finally just the '101ers'. The group played at free festivals such as Stonehenge, and established themselves on the London pub rock circuit prior to the advent of punk.\n\n\nThe group was named after the squat where they lived together: 101 Walterton Road, Maida Vale, although it was for a time rumoured that they were named for \"Room 101\", the infamous torture room in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nThe band's early gigs included several at the Windsor Castle and a residency at the Elgin.[3] They were supported by the Sex Pistols at the Nashville Room on 3 April 1976; this is when Strummer claimed he saw the light and got involved in the punk scene.[1] Joe Strummer commented on this event in the Don Letts documentary Westway to the World on the end of the 101ers by saying \"5 seconds into their (the Pistols') first song, I knew we were like yesterday's paper, we were over.\"[1]\n\nBy the time their debut single, \"Keys to Your Heart\", was released, Joe Strummer was in The Clash and the band were no more.[2] Clive Timperley later joined The Passions, Dan Kelleher went to Martian Schoolgirls and The Derelicts.[2] Richard Dudanski went on to work with The Raincoats, Basement 5 and Public Image Ltd.[2] Tymon Dogg worked with Strummer briefly in The Clash, playing fiddle and singing his original song, \"Lose This Skin\", on Sandinista!, and later in The Mescaleros.\n\nI know the 101ers were good. In fact, as far as sound and excitement went we were much better than Eddie and the Hot Rods. The other guys in the group were twenty-five and twenty-six and they played good because they'd spent a few years getting that far. But they were just too old. What I really wanted was to get in with some young yobbo's who I was more in tune with.\n\nThe 101ers' recorded output was initially limited to one single. However, by 1981, interest in The Clash was at its height and a second single and a compilation album Elgin Avenue Breakdown was released.[2] Several of the tracks on the latter album were live recordings, and there is no evidence that the band ever conceived of these recordings as a full-length album.\n\nUntil his death in 2002, Joe Strummer had been planning to re-release Elgin Avenue Breakdown, complete with previously unreleased tracks that would encompass everything the band ever recorded.[citation needed] The project was completed with the help of Strummer's widow Lucinda Tait and former drummer Richard Dudanski, and released in May 2005 as Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited via Astralwerks in the US and EMI in Europe. The last track on the 2005 re-issue was an 8-minute version of \"Gloria\" recorded on 22 May 1976 at the Cellar Club in Bracknell. This was recorded two weeks before the 101ers finally split.[5] Joe Strummer joined The Clash who played their first gig at the Black Swan, Sheffield supporting the Sex Pistols on 4 July 1976.\n\n\nThe Clash had played \"Keys to Your Heart\" live at around the same time it was reissued as a single. The Hypertonics have also covered this song.[6]\n\nBand line-up[edit]\n\n  \u2022 John \"Woody\" Mellor aka Joe Strummer \u2013 Guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Clive Timperley \u2013 Guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Dan Kelleher \u2013 Bass, guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Richard Dudanski \u2013 Drums\n  \u2022 Simon Cassell aka \"Big John\" \u2013 Saxophone\n  \u2022 Alvaro Pe\u00f1a-Rojas \u2013 Saxophone\n  \u2022 Marwood Chesterton aka \"Mole\" \u2013 Bass guitar (until Oct. 1975)\n  \u2022 Antonio Narvaez \u2013 Drums\n  \u2022 Julian Yewdall \u2013 Vocals, harmonica\n  \u2022 Patrick Nother \u2013 Bass (1st gig)\n  \u2022 Martin Stone \u2013 Lead guitar (final gig)\n  \u2022 Tymon Dogg \u2013 Fiddle, vocals\n\n\n\n  \u2022 \"Keys to Your Heart\" (Joe Strummer) b\/w \"5 Star Rock & Roll Petrol\" (Strummer, Dan Kelleher) (Chiswick\/Big Beat 1976)\n  \u2022 \"Sweet Revenge\" b\/w \"Rabies\" (Chiswick 1981)\n\n\n  \u2022 Elgin Avenue Breakdown Andalucia AND101 (1981)\n  \u2022 Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited Astralwerks ASW32161 \/ EMI 474460 2 (2005)\n  \u2022 Five Star Rock'n'Roll Made In Heaven 362020 (1993) [7]\n\n\n  1. ^ a b c Westway 2001.\n  2. ^ a b c d e Strong 2003, p.\u00a0109.\n  3. ^ Don J Whistance. \"Early gigs\".

        "text":"The dystopian thriller \u201cOblivion\u201d is a breathtaking collage of welcome originality and references to a huge common cultural bank of fantasy images and themes. It\u2019s grandiose in scope and scale, attentive to important details like character and tone, and unafraid to tackle mature themes like love and loss, personal identity and redemption. If there\u2019s a better science-fiction blockbuster this year, I\u2019ll count us lucky.\n\nThe film stars an intensely focused Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, a futuristic repairman tending to weaponized drones that guard the giant rigs mining Earth\u2019s final reserves of energy. The year is 2077, 60 years after an invasion by alien hordes devastated the planet. The remaining human population has relocated to one of Saturn\u2019s moons. Only violent alien marauders remain on the surface, sabotaging the equipment that is extracting the planet\u2019s last resources. Yet Jack, five years after his mandatory memory wipe, can\u2019t shake the feeling that this eerie brave new world is still his home. Who is that woman (Olga Kurylenko) who reappears so insistently in his dreams?\n\nThe film\u2019s look is mesmerizing, combining hypnotically sleek industrial design, workaday grubbiness and immense landscapes so stunningly barren that they elicit tangible unease.\n\nDirector Joseph Kosinski (\u201cTron: Legacy\u201d) and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (who shot \u201cTron\u201d and won an Oscar for last year\u2019s \u201cLife of Pi\u201d) make the impossible impressively realistic. Jack and his communications officer, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), live in a pristine, glass-walled loft that floats thousands of feet above stunning cloud formations. Their solicitous superior, Susan (Melissa Leo), checks in regularly via video screen to check their status as \u201can effective team.\u201d\n\nJack makes his service calls to the surface in a whizzy vehicle that looks like an Apple-designed commuter jet. \u201cOnly two more weeks, Jack, and we can finally leave and join the others,\u201d Victoria cautions. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t take any chances.\u201d It\u2019s as if someone is catering to his superficial needs in an effort to keep him from growing restless and inquisitive.\n\nWhile \u201cTron\u201d was a dramatically inert bite of eye candy and Cruise can emit a soulless vibe, here the star and director create gratifying emotional depth. A haunting loneliness pervades the story. When Jack visits a swath of desert terrain pierced by the spire of the Empire State Building, or rappels through the blasted roof of the New York Public Library, the effect is genuine pathos. Even shots of flowers stubbornly struggling to evolve in this decimated environment pack a punch.\n\nJack, a former Marine, has a generous supply of action-hero skills (this is a Tom Cruise movie, after all) but he is at heart a high-tech grease monkey. He looks suitably worried, awed and surprised when he encounters the plot\u2019s several bombshells. Cruise is fully engaged in his scenes with Riseborough, whose cool composure erodes as their caretaker assignment grows more perilous. She infuses her jargon-heavy \u201cCopy that\u201d dialogue with a rich subtext of vulnerability and longing. Even Leo, seen only as a smiling broadcast visage, imbues her honeyed tones with a hint of steely command, at once cloying and creepy.\n\nHappily, \u201cOblivion\u201d is not a remake, sequel, reboot or the foundation for a projected franchise. It tells a self-contained mystery story that, for all its explosive action passages, feels like an epic episode of \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d The film is rife with elements from its finest predecessors \u2014 Kubrick, Lucas, the Wachowskis and Pixar could be listed as creative consultants \u2014 but it has the spirit of a love letter to classic sci-fi, not an opportunistic mash-up.\n\nJust as Lucas reached back to \u201cFlash Gordon\u201d serials for inspiration, Kosinski borrows wisely and well. \u201cOblivion\u201d will not fade from memory for quite a while.",
