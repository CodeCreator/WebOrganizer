        "text":"The 101ers\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nThe 101ers\nOrigin London, England\nYears active\n  \u2022 1974\u00a0(1974)\u20131976\u00a0(1976)\n  \u2022 (one-off reunion: 2003)\nAssociated acts\nPast members\n\nThe 101ers were a pub rock band from the 1970s playing mostly in a rockabilly style, notable as being the band that Joe Strummer left to join The Clash.[1] Formed in London in May 1974, the 101ers made their performing debut on 7 September at the Telegraph pub in Brixton,[2] under the name 'El Huaso and the 101 All Stars'. The name would later be shortened to the '101 All Stars' and finally just the '101ers'. The group played at free festivals such as Stonehenge, and established themselves on the London pub rock circuit prior to the advent of punk.\n\n\nThe group was named after the squat where they lived together: 101 Walterton Road, Maida Vale, although it was for a time rumoured that they were named for \"Room 101\", the infamous torture room in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nThe band's early gigs included several at the Windsor Castle and a residency at the Elgin.[3] They were supported by the Sex Pistols at the Nashville Room on 3 April 1976; this is when Strummer claimed he saw the light and got involved in the punk scene.[1] Joe Strummer commented on this event in the Don Letts documentary Westway to the World on the end of the 101ers by saying \"5 seconds into their (the Pistols') first song, I knew we were like yesterday's paper, we were over.\"[1]\n\nBy the time their debut single, \"Keys to Your Heart\", was released, Joe Strummer was in The Clash and the band were no more.[2] Clive Timperley later joined The Passions, Dan Kelleher went to Martian Schoolgirls and The Derelicts.[2] Richard Dudanski went on to work with The Raincoats, Basement 5 and Public Image Ltd.[2] Tymon Dogg worked with Strummer briefly in The Clash, playing fiddle and singing his original song, \"Lose This Skin\", on Sandinista!, and later in The Mescaleros.\n\nI know the 101ers were good. In fact, as far as sound and excitement went we were much better than Eddie and the Hot Rods. The other guys in the group were twenty-five and twenty-six and they played good because they'd spent a few years getting that far. But they were just too old. What I really wanted was to get in with some young yobbo's who I was more in tune with.\n\nThe 101ers' recorded output was initially limited to one single. However, by 1981, interest in The Clash was at its height and a second single and a compilation album Elgin Avenue Breakdown was released.[2] Several of the tracks on the latter album were live recordings, and there is no evidence that the band ever conceived of these recordings as a full-length album.\n\nUntil his death in 2002, Joe Strummer had been planning to re-release Elgin Avenue Breakdown, complete with previously unreleased tracks that would encompass everything the band ever recorded.[citation needed] The project was completed with the help of Strummer's widow Lucinda Tait and former drummer Richard Dudanski, and released in May 2005 as Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited via Astralwerks in the US and EMI in Europe. The last track on the 2005 re-issue was an 8-minute version of \"Gloria\" recorded on 22 May 1976 at the Cellar Club in Bracknell. This was recorded two weeks before the 101ers finally split.[5] Joe Strummer joined The Clash who played their first gig at the Black Swan, Sheffield supporting the Sex Pistols on 4 July 1976.\n\n\nThe Clash had played \"Keys to Your Heart\" live at around the same time it was reissued as a single. The Hypertonics have also covered this song.[6]\n\nBand line-up[edit]\n\n  \u2022 John \"Woody\" Mellor aka Joe Strummer \u2013 Guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Clive Timperley \u2013 Guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Dan Kelleher \u2013 Bass, guitar, vocals\n  \u2022 Richard Dudanski \u2013 Drums\n  \u2022 Simon Cassell aka \"Big John\" \u2013 Saxophone\n  \u2022 Alvaro Pe\u00f1a-Rojas \u2013 Saxophone\n  \u2022 Marwood Chesterton aka \"Mole\" \u2013 Bass guitar (until Oct. 1975)\n  \u2022 Antonio Narvaez \u2013 Drums\n  \u2022 Julian Yewdall \u2013 Vocals, harmonica\n  \u2022 Patrick Nother \u2013 Bass (1st gig)\n  \u2022 Martin Stone \u2013 Lead guitar (final gig)\n  \u2022 Tymon Dogg \u2013 Fiddle, vocals\n\n\n\n  \u2022 \"Keys to Your Heart\" (Joe Strummer) b\/w \"5 Star Rock & Roll Petrol\" (Strummer, Dan Kelleher) (Chiswick\/Big Beat 1976)\n  \u2022 \"Sweet Revenge\" b\/w \"Rabies\" (Chiswick 1981)\n\n\n  \u2022 Elgin Avenue Breakdown Andalucia AND101 (1981)\n  \u2022 Elgin Avenue Breakdown Revisited Astralwerks ASW32161 \/ EMI 474460 2 (2005)\n  \u2022 Five Star Rock'n'Roll Made In Heaven 362020 (1993) [7]\n\n\n  1. ^ a b c Westway 2001.\n  2. ^ a b c d e Strong 2003, p.\u00a0109.\n  3. ^ Don J Whistance. \"Early gigs\".

Just one day after her ex-wife demanded a raise in spousal and child support, the \"I'm the Only One' singer fired back by filing her own court documents in which she calls her ex-wife \"angry and vindictive.\"\n\nOffering proof of Michaels' nastiness, Etheridge included an e-mail sent by the former \"Popular\" actress. \"Children should really be placed first, Melissa, I encourage you to try it this time around with these two of your children,\" the letter read. \"You know, Melissa, that I did not give birth to these two children to give them away to your various staff members and girlfriends to raise.\"\n\nIn the e-mail, Michaels allegedly also told Etheridge, \"You have to support so many households because you BROKE SO MANY HOUSEHOLDS, silly. If you had decided to have one ounce of integrity\/honesty as a person or partner, you would NOT be in this predicament. Think about it.\"\n\nAside from that, Etheridge also accused Michaels of accidentally burning son Miller Steven with a cigarette. Therefore, she is asking a judge to install a smoking ban for both Michaels and herself whenever they are around their twins. \"The children have allergies and I am concerned about their exposure to second-hand smoke,\" she added.\n\nIn her custody-related documents, the two-time Grammy winner additionally requests for more time with the kids since she believes Michaels is against an equal custody deal. On the reason behind the thought, the \"Come to My Window\" crooner said that her ex has accused her of not having the \"maternal instinct\". A hearing is set for May 22.\n\nMichaels herself filed a settlement conference brief on Monday. In it, she claimed she needs more than the $23,000 per month to live on because she grew accustomed to living at over $128,000 a month during her long-term relationship with Etheridge, and now \"has limited income and virtually no savings.\"\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nRequired fields are marked with *\n\n\n\n  1.

Although the song itself is identical in each case, the two versions are differently orchestrated and are therefore published side by side for ease of comparison, and to allow for use by singers with different vocal ranges.\n\nMore detailed information, together with original sleeve notes by the composer and new editorial notes by Paul Mann, are available under each listing.\n\nLook up:\nA Smile When I Shook His Hand\nThe Sun Will Shine Again\n\nFull list of Jon Lord\u2019s collected scores now\u00a0available.",
