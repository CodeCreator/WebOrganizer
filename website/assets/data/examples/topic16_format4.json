He is often\nsympathetic to people, especially Candy.\n\nAs for assigning OZ roles: there is one point, near the end of chapter 14,\nwhen Candy and Barnes are together in the hotel lobby, before they have ever\ngone up to Serpentina's room.

        "text":"Australian poetry\n\nOn Australian poetry now: a response to David Campbell\n\nOne way to read poetry in Australia is to see\u00a0it as being in a constant state of conflict. For the most part, this is a cold war where poets argue with poets in very poetic ways \u2013 the outcry about Geoff Page\u2019s Southerly blog probably counts as the outer limit of this activity, which manifests more often in email exchanges, reviews that are compliment sandwiches or gossipy asides. Sometimes this breaks out into the open, as we saw when John Kinsella took out a restraining order against Robert Adamson and Anthony Lawrence and which the Sydney Morning Herald covered in 2006.\n\nRecently, however, there has been fuel on the fire. This has oriented itself around the newly released Puncher & Wattman Anthology of Contemporary Australian Poetry. Following a review by Louis Nowra in the Australian, this past weekend saw the publication of a polemic by David Campbell in the same newspaper. There is an obvious politicisation of poetry and it seems like the editors are having their say on this matter as well. Campbell repeated many of Nowra\u2019s criticisms including that much of the volume was \u2018little better than minced prose\u2019. In addition to Nowra\u2019s position, Campbell attacked the volume on behalf of \u2018bush poets\u2019 who write \u2018traditional rhyming verse\u2019. He lamented the fact that they had been \u2018airbrushed\u2019 from history by their exclusion from the anthology. One might be tempted to argue what \u2018traditional\u2019 or \u2018free verse\u2019 or \u2018bush poetry\u2019 mean for Campbell, but what was striking in his piece was its closing paragraph:\n\nPerhaps, if the \u2018ruling majority\u2019 showed more respect for traditional verse, something that can already attract hundreds of people at a time to festivals across Australia, it may just help to spark renewed interest in poetry and make us less like \u2018beggars fighting over the contents of a dumpster\u2019.\n\nIn this paragraph, Campbell\u2019s target becomes clear. It is the \u2018ruling majority\u2019 (more a spectral presence than a named set of actors beyond the anthology\u2019s editors); their major crime, the promotion of \u2018free verse\u2019. I do not quite know what free-verse poetry is for Campbell because he does not offer a definition. But I agree with him that we need a proper debate. This is not only to \u2018spark renewed interest in poetry\u2019, but also to keep raising consciousness in terms of reference that make sense. What might lie hidden in all this is that poetry is part of a battle for national identity, something that anthologies prompt and which people beyond poetry are interested in as well.\n\n\nAnd, on that question of identity, one cannot immediately assume that to express an attachment to the country need take the form of a bush ballad, that traditional verse is the only authentic mode of expression. Where would we be, after all, without Indigenous song poems that are the tradition of this continent? Or indeed the work of Les Murray or Kinsella, whose many poems do not all belong to the \u2018traditional verse\u2019 Campbell suggests? This is to say nothing of the Anthology\u2019s great many poems set in the bush that are formally experimental. I say this as someone who is probably among Campbell\u2019s targets because I do not easily conform to the traditions as he describes it. This is despite the pleasure I gain from the yarns I listen to in Witchcliffe (in regional Western Australia) and a reading diet that includes many traditional verse icons from Banjo Paterson to Henry Lawson. This is in addition to Aboriginal people in my family, a father from the white rural working classes, and places and community groups I belong to in country Australia. Speaking from this position, I would defend the formal inventiveness common to much contemporary poetry. After all, it can also express attachment to rural places. Why can\u2019t we enjoy all the camps of poetry rather than decry the lack that seems to exist?\n\nI would also suggest that the aim of the Puncher & Wattman\u2019s Anthology is not completeness and, like Campbell, Corey Wakeling ably highlighted the absence of several avant-garde or experimental poets in his review in Cordite. One would also notice a lack of slam, spoken word, tabi. From this, one must assume that the anthology is a slice of the pie with a contemporary designation. Its opposition is not \u2018the traditional\u2019 like Campbell claims, and I do not think the absence of certain poets is intended to cause \u2018irritation\u2019, but rather that no anthology can be encyclopaedic. Choices must be made and, as Campbell himself notes, the introduction does say it will be a \u2018critical review\u2019.\n\nWhat might be more telling is the following sentence from Campbell: \u2018I find this blinkered attitude frustrating because I\u2019m caught in the middle.\u2019 If one is in the middle build a bridge, be a point of connection rather than dismiss it: see the anthology for what it is, which is a very good attempt at what counts as contemporary poetry. This is something I detailed in my review in Westerly. In that way, I am not represented in the volume and I am a poet who belongs to no camp as well, but what I appreciate about Puncher & Wattman and Campbell is the care they have shown to our field. What might be necessary is not so much an anthology that attended to all the different sides of the conflict but a way of creating a poetic culture that allowed it to flourish with a sense of proportion and direction. Perhaps then we might get the hundreds of people watching a dumpster fire that is warming as well as illuminating.\n\n\nImage: Shack at Pine Ridge \/ Sacha Fernandez\n\nOverland is a not-for-profit magazine with a proud history of supporting writers, and publishing ideas and voices often excluded from other places.\n\nIf you like this piece, or support Overland\u2019s work in general, please subscribe or donate.\n\nRobert Wood is the author of History & the Poet.

His review was one of the shoddiest pieces of literary journalism I have come across in a long while. It was simply a poor intervention in the tiresome \u2018culture wars\u2019, so beloved by The Australian. (BTW, \u2018Paterson\u2019 has one \u2018t\u2019.)\n\n  2. Glad to see some criticism of the Campbell review. But does it even deserve engagement? So patently out of touch with the contemporary, the review seemed to be aimed at those who don\u2019t read poetry and consider bush poetry to be synonymous with the nation\u2019s poetic history as such. So, as David McCooey says above, shoddy literary journalism.\n\n    Here, I want to address your mischaracterisation of my article on the anthology in this piece, which, I want to add, was an essay and not a review. I don\u2019t say this to be pedantic; I only say it to point out the intentions of my article: essay the question of contemporaneity in the context of Contemporary Australian Poetry. The intentions of that piece of writing was not to review the anthology, in other words, in the sense of evaluating it for the potential reader.\n\n    Indeed, the piece of writing I put together about the anthology redressed the absence of certain literary ecologies that have substantial influence upon contemporary poetics in this national context. As such, my essay sought to direct the attention away from individual exclusions, which can always be defended, to my mind, but instead toward the bigger questions of what contemporary poetics is.\n\n    In fact, my essay\u2019s most controversial claim might figure it quite differently to the way you have characterised it here and elsewhere. That is, I claimed that certain practices in contemporary poetry today, especially the small press realm and examples such as PiO\u2019s Collective Effort Press, can never be well-anthologised by anthologies such as this, antagonistic as such literary ecologies are to national anthologisation as such. So, the editors didn\u2019t really exclude PiO, for example, but rather the ecology in which PiO features prominently has always been marginal to this kind of nation-centric anthology. I think that members of that scene, at least in my limited impressions of it, are fairly indifferent to such anthologies and generally don\u2019t read them. Probably PiO turned them down their invitation to contribute anyway. These are the kinds of literary dynamics that interest me, not exclusions of individuals as such.\n\n    So, I somewhat resent my essay being put on the other end of the spectrum to Campbell\u2019s irrelevant conservative-reader-baiting as another example of critical writing about individual exclusions! But I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t forcefully intend to erect that dialectic here ;) I just wanted to use the footnote area of your piece here to clarify some matters. Thanks for keeping the conversation going, in any case.\n\n    \u2022 no i wasn\u2019t asked to submit\n      nor did i now it was being put together\n      it seem tho that some critics \/ commentators\n      give the editors the benefit of the doubt regarding my participation\n      by suggesting an out i.e. he may have knocked them back\n      considering the result (retrospectively)\n      i would have been glad to.\n      i think it true tho, Corey that it is\n      the very nature of these anthologies that my\/our exclusion is re-enforced.\n      i was asked by southerly to review it\n      which i did over a year ago, but it seems someone at southerly got sick and there was no one there to replace them so it still hasn\u2019t appeared, pity*!\n      love + anarchy\n\n  3. I spent some time over the weekend looking at the award winning poetry that Campbell claims should be included in an anthology of contemporary poetry.\n\n    I\u2019d have to say on balance, most of the award winning pieces just don\u2019t cut the mustard in terms of craft.\n\n    Now to be fair, there\u2019s only so much you can do with th...

While she's taking baths, Izumi's window sometimes randomly opens up to a scene in the other world. Izumi herself has no control over it and no idea what she has to do, however it quickly becomes apparent that with each instance, Izumi obtains something that will serve in the next instance.\n    \u2022 Secondly, unlike most novels, the series centers not on Izumi's growth, but on the characters she interacts with. Although the story is often told from Izumi's POV, Izumi herself is more like the support character that affects the lives of other characters and the relationship between them.\n    What this results in is a surprisingly decent world and character-building. Every chapter, Izumi faces a different situation with different characters: from battle instances, to political plotting, to just relationship issues, the situations Izumi faces are quite varied, unique, but also interconnected. The things she sets off in one country, for example, affects what happens in another.\n\n    Likewise, the characters she interacts with have very different reactions towards her, treating her either as a benevolent goddess\/angel, or as an evil witch, or even just as a shameless exhibitionist (much to her chagrin). The 'bathroom' premise is actually used to pretty good comedic effect, not by repeating the same gag, but rather both Izumi and the characters she interacts with are equally in a 'wtf?!' state, and Izumi ends up needing to find different ways to cope with each situation.\n\n    The story isn't long, so it's not a sprawling epic, but it exploits its premise pretty well, has a lot going on in the world, and makes for a pretty interesting and enjoyable read. Check it out for something different.\n\nShare This Page",
