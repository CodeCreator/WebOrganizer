The first stage of the research has used satellite remote sensing data on vegetation greenness and leaf area to calibrate crop growth models to estimate crop yields. Interannual variation in predicted yields will be compared to agricultural statistics available in Mali. The second phase explores the geographic and economic causes of variability in crop production to develop crop yield gap analysis across West Africa.\nKaboro holds a MSc. in Applied Geomatics from Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec (Canada), and a BSc. in Telecommunications Engineering from University of Sidi Mohamed ben Abdallah, Morocco. He served as a lecturer in Geomatics and as the Information System Manager at IPR\/IFRA (Institut Polytechnique Rural de Formation et de Recherche Appliqu\u00e9e), Mali, before starting his Ph.D. program in Geospatial Science and Engineering at SDSU in Fall 2015.

He has appeared on the TV show Ancient Aliens and his work has appeared in Atlantis Rising, New Dawn, UFO, Nexus, Wild West, Sierra Heritage, and Nature Photography. The author of The Genesis Race, he lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\n1 - The Genesis Race\n\nThe Genesis Race: Our Extraterrestrial DNA and the True Origins of the Species\n\nShows that Earth was visited by an extraterrestrial race who bioengineered modern man in its image and taught man how to construct the pyramids\n\n\u2022 Examines the flaws in Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution and presents startling new evidence of intelligent intervention\n\n\u2022 Reveals the messages coded in the pyramids left by the ancients concerning impending Earth changes at the end of the Mayan calendar\n\nFor millennia the development of humanity showed a consistent homogenous pattern. Then suddenly, around 3000 B.C.E., great civilizations sprang up around the globe. All the creation myths of these civilizations tell of gods who came down to Earth and fashioned man in their own image, teaching them the arts of agriculture and civilized life. In addition, the dominant architectural design in Egypt, Sumeria, Peru, Mexico, and China was the pyramid, though science has never been able to explain why or where these peoples obtained the advanced technological knowledge to construct such edifices. The abruptness and similarities of these evolutionary leaps calls into question the Darwinian theory of evolution, given that there are no traces of any intermediate evolutionary forms.\n\nNow, using the most current research on DNA, Will Hart shows that these gods were actually visitors from other worlds who genetically engineered modern humanity from the beings that then inhabited the planet. He also suggests that the Bible and other creation stories have been interpreted falsely as myth when they should have been read as history. The structures left by our ancestors were designed in accordance with precise astronomical and geodetic alignments to make them visible from outer space and to survive for thousands of years with the intent of communicating information relating to physical and temporal events. Humanity\u2019s current stage of development has finally reached the point where the secret messages of these structures can be decoded to reveal the fate of humanity in the coming Earth changes.\n\n\n[1]\u00a0https:\/\/www.simonandschuster.com\/books\/The-Genesis-Race\/Will-Hart\/9781591430186\n\n\nWho were they?\u2026 Why did they come?\u2026 What did they leave behind?\u2026 Where did they go?\u2026 Will they return?\u2026\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

The long-term interest of my laboratory is to elucidate the molecular regulators of the cellular processes that occur in endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls. We study these questions through cell-lineage specific, temporally regulatable gene expression and deletion in mice, combined with cellular, molecular, and two-photon in vivo imaging approaches. A key challenge in the study of angiogenesis is the regulation of arterial venous hierarchy. We are currently investigating the function of Notch and ephrin-B2 signaling pathways in arterial venous specification.\u00a0 This work may unravel signaling cascades regulating crucial vascular pathophysiology and facilitate rational design of therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\n\nRecent Publications\n\nView all Publications \u00bb",

To redress these failures, McCormick thinks that ownership assets need to be clearly marked and defined. He says that \u201cgood fences make good neighbors\u201d is both good poetry and good policy.\n\nMcCormick attended Clemson University and received his bachelor\u2019s degree in economics in 1972. Then in 1974, he received his master\u2019s degree in environmental economics from Clemson. Later, he earned his Ph.D. in economics at Texas A&M University in 1978.\n\nIn 1997, McCormick received the award for Innovative Teacher of the Year, nominated by the students at Clemson University. The following year he received the Alumni Master Teacher of the Year from Clemson University. McCormick has also been a Professor Visitante at the Universidad Francisco Marroquin in Guatemala City, Guatemala in 1990. He is a fellow at Consortium International MBA, CIMBA, which is an Italian program for MBA students, and he lectures annually during the spring in Italy to these students. Currently, McCormick is an economics professor at Clemson and the BB&T scholar in the John E. Walker Department of Economics. He is also senior research associate in the Arthur M. Spiro Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership.\n\nSince 2002, McCormick has been a senior fellow and directed a\u00a0program at PERC for environmental entrepreneurs who want to have a better understanding of how business and economic principles can be applied to environmental problems. In 2001, he was a Julian Simon Fellow at PERC. He is heavily engaged in the research of carbon sequestration and its impact on global warming. In this research, McCormick is investigating how income affects carbon sequestration as a solution for global warming.\n\nMcCormick resides in Clemson with his family. He has two sons,\u00a0both of whom are heavily involved in athletics. McCormick enjoys spending his free time woodworking, hunting, and roaming his property on his tractor.

(Some recalcitrant states, SC and TX to name two, seem hell bent on reminding the federal government of the long forgotten 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but wasn\u2019t that fight settled a long time ago?) Advocates of this law say that it encourages the use of more energy efficient lighting sources such as CFL and LED lights. It has been noted that a large fraction of the energy consumed by an incandescent light bulb goes to create heat and not light, and that the newer, high tech devices produce an equal amount of light using less energy.However, those of us who aren\u2019t lucky enough to live in AZ, south FL, or San Diego, demand a LOT of heat many months of the year. In Montana, I use natural gas to heat my home about 7-8 months of the year. In South Carolina, I heat my home about 5-6 months of the year using wood and electricity, not every day, but most of them from November to April.The energy that creates heat, not light, in a regular incandescent bulb is NOT wasted during those months. It is a nearly perfect substitute for the alternative heat in my home. The same electricity that heats the filament in my incandescent bulb in my living room in my South Carolina home in winter will be used by my heat pump to reproduce the heat lost when I convert to CFL or LED lights when my woodstove runs low. There is NO energy savings of any important degree. (It bears noting that my heat pump is a more efficient producer of energy than my incandescent bulbs, but that is not my main point as is explored more below.)Of course in the spring, fall, and summer, the CFL bulbs will not be producing heat that I don\u2019t want, but that isn\u2019t my point here. I am only making the observation that you are foolish to think that you will get the savings printed on the carton of CFL light bulbs if you ever use gas, electricity, or any other energy source to heat your house. Replacing incandescent light bulbs with cooler CFL or LED lighting means that other heat sources have to work harder in your home when it is cold outside. Of this there can hardly be any doubt.To be sure, heat pumps and natural gas may be more efficient heaters than incandescent bulbs, no argument here. I am only making the point that for homes in cool or cold climates, the promised energy savings simply cannot emerge.It makes a lot more sense to use CFL or LED lighting outside where the incandescent light bulb heat is wasted, or during summer or non-heating months, and I use them myself in this application. I have made a little Excel spreadsheet calculator\u00a0[XLS]\u00a0that properly calculates the real energy savings you will get from switching to CFL or LED lights from incandescent which is based on the number of days that you think you heat your home. Those of you who are interested to see just how dishonest the current forecasts are are welcome to use this simple tool.\u00a0\n\nBrainless Sustainability\n\nOne of the envirobuzzwords of the 21st century is sustainability. I recently googled the term \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d and there were over 11 million hits. The\u2026",

Dr. Mansfield is using quartz crystal microbalances (QCM), microbiological characterization tools, and optical\/fluorescence microscopy are used to characterize key aspects of MIC that present potential intervention and mitigation targets. Organisms from ethanol fuel environments, including acid producers, sulfate reducers and iron oxidizers are the primary microbes under investigation at NIST.\u00a0 Their impact on materials, such as those used in manufacturing, storage and transport of alternative fuels, are being evaluated.\u00a0 Through this development, intervention and prevention strategies can be developed.\n\n\nAwards and Honors:\u00a0\n\nDepartment of Commerce Bronze Medal;\u00a0citation:\u00a0\"for extending thermogravimetric analysis to the microscale, enabling characterization of nanoparticles, their coatings and purity\", 2013\n\nUniversity of Arizona Foundation Award,\u00a0\u00a0Meritorious Performance in Teaching, College of Science, University of Arizona, 2005\n\nPfizer Graduate Travel Award, ACS Division of Analytical Chemistry, ACS Fall National Meeting, Washington D.C., 2005\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, CO, 2007-2010\n\nNSF Fellowship to attend \"From Nanoparticles to Nanocomposites: Processing, Performance and Toxicity\" University of Massachusetts-Lowell, 2009\n\nPh.D., Analytical Chemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 2007 (Dissertation:\u00a0Cross-linked phospholipid coatings in micron-sized channels for spatially discrete bioassays and protein separations, with Dr. Craig Aspinwall)\n\nNSF Fellowship, David F.

        "text":"Skip to main content\n\nChris Xu\n\nShattering expectations to learn about the brain\n\nProfessor Chris Xu talks with a student in his lab at Cornell.\n\nChris Xu, professor of applied and engineering physics at Cornell, was at a White House conference as an invited guest in September, 2014. He was there to celebrate the progress made by researchers who are part of President Obama's BRAIN initiative. Xu was included in recognition of his exciting progress in creating new tools for brain imaging. Xu has 28 patents either granted or pending and his work on multiphoton microscopy is allowing researchers to image the mouse brain in living specimins at previously unattainable depths and resolution.\n\nBut for a boy raised in a poor neighborhood of Shanghai during Chairman Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution of the 1970s, being invited to the White House as an honored guest would probably have seemed unimaginable. \u201cI look back at my life and it is amazing where I have been able to go and what I have been able to do.\u201d says Xu.\n\nLife in China changed dramatically after the Cultural Revolution. Xu took a test at the age of 12 and ended up with a spot at the best middle school in the country. \u201cOne day I was living in a neighborhood where maybe one person in ten thousand actually went to college. My dad never spent one day of his life in a formal school. But then there I was at a boarding school with the cream of the crop. It was at that middle school that a physics teacher opened my eyes to the world outside China and the wonderful world in physics,\u201d says Xu. Fast forward to the early 1990s. After earning a B.S. in physics from Fudan University in 1989, Xu came to Cornell to get both his Master\u2019s and his Ph.D. in applied physics.\n\nCornell Engineering professor Watt Webb and doctoral student Winfried Denk had just invented a new imaging technology called two-photon microscopy and Xu joined Webb\u2019s lab. \u201cWorking with Watt Webb was one of the luckiest breaks of my life,\u201d says Xu. \u201cHe explained the project and it just clicked with me\u2014it made so much sense.\u201d This was the beginning of Xu\u2019s research in optics and biological imaging, which form the foundation of his current interdisciplinary research. \u00a0\n\nXu earned his Ph.D. in 1996 and then joined Bell Labs, a place he dreamed about when he was in high school. At Bell, Xu moved into new research areas in fiber optics and telecom, and invented breakthrough technologies for high bit-rate, long distance optical transmission. \u201cAt the time,\u201d says Xu, \u201call sorts of money was flowing in and you could pursue any idea in telecom.\u201d It was while he was at Bell Labs that Xu got his first exposure to the business and financial side of high-tech research. \u201cAt Bell I learned how things like practicality, cost, and politics all come into play when you are developing any sort of product,\u201d says Xu. He also got to see first-hand how large-scale economic trends make themselves felt in industry research labs during the heydays of the dotcom bubble and crash.\n\nAfter six years at Bell Labs, Xu decided to enter the world of academia. He joined the faculty of the School of Applied and Engineering Physics in 2002 and he has been with Cornell ever since. Currently, Xu is working on what he has called \u201cone of the most exciting projects I have ever engaged in in my entire life.\u201d Put simply, he and his colleagues are creating new technologies that will allow in vivo imaging deep into the brain. \u201cDuring my middle school years, I told myself that I should only work on two things: the universe and the brain, because both are so mysterious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is certainly wonderful to be able to pursue a childhood dream.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWe are also developing new medical endoscopes for non-invasive, real-time diagnostics of tissue without use of dyes or contrast agents,\u201d says Xu. \u201cIt is hard because it is all new. We have to make the tools we need in order to simply make the tools we need. We are turning a 200 pound microscope into a 2-gram handheld device. The challenges are enormous.\u201d\n\nXu may attribute a fair amount of his success to the schools he attended and the great mentors he had in life, but it is clear that something else is at play as well. Chris Xu has worked hard his entire career to master difficult concepts and challenging technology. His drive for excellence and efficiency, and his fearless pursuit of new ideas have been the cornerstones of his career. Xu\u2019s multiphoton microscope will play an important part in meeting the BRAIN initiative\u2019s goal of understanding everything about the brain. The medical endoscopes will be a valuable tool in diagnosing cancers and other diseases in far less invasive ways than done currently. It is a long way from the neighborhoods of Shanghai to Ithaca and the White House and no one is more aware of this distance than Chris Xu. \u201cAt some point in each day I remember how lucky I am,\u201d says Xu, \u201cand then I get back to work.\u201d",
