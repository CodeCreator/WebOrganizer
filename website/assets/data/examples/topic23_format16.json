The 150 pitches (all fully serviced, 4\/10A electricity) are on level grass, some under trees and others in the open by a stream that runs through the site. Wild birds are abundant, including kingfishers. This is the perfect location from which to commence the climb of the Ballon d\u2019Alsace, which is hugely popular with cyclists. Theatre lovers should visit Bussang (6 km) and see the large wooden People\u2019s Theatre, built in 1895 and still performing in July and August every year; you will marvel at the raked stage and the enormous backstage areas which may be visited at any time.\n\nThe site has a special lake for children to fish (stocked by the owner), whereas the adults can visit one of three adjacent lakes just outside. The keen cyclist would enjoy the long distance track which passes the boundary. Those of a slightly different sporting bent, may like to visit the Casino at Bussang (open all year) even if only to partake of a meal and watch.\n\n\nTwo stylish and modern toilet blocks (all season) and two older ones (high season only). Facilities for disabled campers and babies. Laundry. Motorcaravan services. Gas supplies. Bar and takeaway (July\/Aug). Large heated swimming pool with slide and paddling pool (June-Aug). Fishing.

The view was beautiful and the home is extremely well equipped with everything you could possibly need including fresh lemons and limes from the trees on the property. We were also thrilled to see that the owners had decorated the living room when we arrived filling our first Christmas away from home with holiday spirit. Bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and the bedding made us feel like we were staying in a luxury hotel.\n\nThe owners were very response to our numerous emails before our visit and called the day of our arrival to make sure we knew how to get to the property.\n\nThe town of Tiburon was beautiful place to explore on Christmas day even though most everything except the grocery store was closed. We had hoped to go to Muir Woods for a hike that morning, but arrived a little too late to get a parking spot. I would recommend getting there early if you want to go the the park. We also spent Christmas Eve in San Francisco and had no trouble getting a driver (Uber and Lyft) to take us to and from the city.

The 151-mile (243-kilometer) drive starts at Torquay and ends at Allansford is a popular daytrip from Melbourne but Hipcampers can make the most of the scenery by slowing down and settling in to some of the great camping sites, from beaches to bush, along the way.\n\nWhere to Go\n\n\nSurfers won\u2019t want to skip Torquay: Next to Bells Beach, it\u2019s famed for its big swells and hosts the world's best surfers at the annual Rip Curl Pro, held around Easter. Those who prefer to stay on dry land can embark upon the 27-mile (44-kilometer) Surf Coast Walk to Airey\u2019s Inlet. A little farther south, Lorne has inviting white-sand beaches and a relaxed atmosphere, and is a great place to see migrating whales between May and September. Powered sites at the centrally located Torquay Holiday Park have access to a heated swimming pool, camp kitchen, and laundry, while, just south of Lorne, Cumberland River Reserve is set in lush surroundings and has unpowered sites with access to hot showers, laundry, and barbecues.\n\nApollo Bay\n\nSet at the foothills of the Otways, the little town of Apollo Bay is a great place to base yourself for embarking on walks into the hinterland and around Great Otway National Park, as well as for exploring the 65-mile (104-kilometer)-long Great Ocean Walk, which starts in Apollo Bay and ends at Gibson Steps near the Twelve Apostles. This is also a great spot for wildlife spotting: Look out for platypus at Lake Elizabeth and koalas around Kennett River Holiday Park, which has powered and unpowered sites with access to laundry, camp kitchen, and barbeques. Just outside Apollo Bay, Marengo Holliday Park is similarly well-equipped, while the more adventurous can find basic hike-in campsites along the Great Ocean Walk, including Johanna\u2019s Beach Campgrounds, tucked behind sand dunes near a popular surfing beach.\n\nTwelve Apostles\n\nThe Great Ocean Road\u2019s star attraction, the seven rocky stacks of the Twelve Apostles jut out from the ocean and can be seen from a network of viewing platforms around the clifftops: Visit around sunset and you might also spot penguins come into shore after a day\u2019s fishing. The closest campsite to the Twelve Apostles, Princetown Recreation Reserve and Camping offers powered and unpowered sites with access to hot showers, laundry, and a barbecue area, as does nearby Apostles Camping Park and Cabins. Twenty minutes east, Port Campbell Recreation Reserve is set in a natural reserve and has powered and unpowered sites with access to hot showers, laundry, barbecues, and free wifi.\n\n\nAt the end of the Great Ocean Road, the attractive city of Warrnambool is famed for its whales, best seen from Logans Beach between June and October. You can also dive into the city\u2019s lively arts scene, discover the history of the Shipwreck Coast at Flagstaff Hill Maritime Village, and admire the historic lighthouses, whitewashed cottages, and maritime charm of nearby Port Fairy. Powered and unpowered sites with access to the camp kitchen, barbecue, laundry, and shower are available at Surfside Holiday Park on Warrnambool\u2019s foreshore, just steps from the popular swimming beach, while nearby family- and pet-friendly Warrnambool Holiday Park and Motel has powered sites, some ensuite, with access to a heated swimming pool, games room, kitchen, laundry, barbecue, and wifi.\n\nHipcamp is created with \u2764\ufe0f and hope for our future.",
