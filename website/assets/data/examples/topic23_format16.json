Private transfers to meet any flight are also possible.\n\nBooking your own flights\nClients wishing to use airmiles to buy or upgrade flights, or who wish to fly from outside the UK are advised to book their own flights. \u00a0The start and end point for the tour is SAN JOS\u00c9, Costa Rica. Do be careful as there is also a San Jose airport in California \u2013 booking engines and even travel agents have been known to confuse the two. \u00a0The correct airport code for the one in Costa Rica is SJO (Juan Santamaria International Airport). \u00a0On 14 April, the first day of the tour, there are no activities until dinner, so guests can arrive at any point during this day. \u00a0Check in at the Presidente Hotel is from 2pm but bags can be stored there if guests arrive early. We will be happy to provide a quote for early check-in if needed. On 25 April,\u00a0the last day of the tour, there are no activities after breakfast but you are welcome to stay until check-out which is 12.00 midday. If you would like us to give you a quote for late check-out or extra nights we will be happy to help. We will be arranging a group airport transfer for those booking flights with us (fee applies) but we can also arrange private airport transfers for those arranging their own flights for a supplement.\n\nVery Important! Those who plan to book their own flights should not make any binding or non-refundable arrangements until their place has been confirmed in writing on the tour and Temple World has confirmed that it is a guaranteed departure.\n\nThe tour price includes\nHotel accommodation in a twin or double bedded rooms with ensuite bathroom throughout, all excursions with local guides including entrance fees (except any optional excursions if mentioned), full board (except on first day, where no meals are included until dinner, and after breakfast on the last day, where lunch, if needed, is at own expense), expert trip lecturer.\n\nNot included\nInternational flights, drinks, tips to drivers & guides, items of a personal nature.\n\n\nNHS Fit For Travel advises travellers to Costa Rica are usually recommended to immunise against:\u00a0Hepatitis A. There is a risk of\u00a0Malaria\u00a0in parts of Costa Rica but the areas we are visiting are considered a low risk, so antimalarials are not usually advised.\u00a0A Yellow Fever Certificate\u00a0is required if entering from an area with risk of yellow fever transmission. Please seek professional medical advice at least 8 week before departure.\u00a0NHS Fit For Travel Website\n\n\nUK and US passport holders do not require a visa to enter Costa Rica as a tourist. Nationals of a few countries may require a visa in advance, so please check with your local Costa Rican consulate before travel. Those transiting through the USA must have a valid ESTA or Visa prior to departure.\n\nFitness Guideline\nWe have graded the fitness level required for participation in this tour as Moderate. There is quite a lot of walking (not hiking) in the tour, on jungle trails and in rain-forest conditions which can be a little wet and slippery. \u00a0There may not be anywhere to rest or sit down regularly.\nFull fitness guideline for this tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip Scholar\n\nProfessor Nick Davies\nProfessor Davies is Professor of Behavioural Ecology at the University of Cambridge. An ornithologist and field naturalist, he has accompanied many previous alumni tours to great success. His research concerns the study of how behaviour evolves in response to selection pressures from ecology and the social environment. His current work focuses on the interactions between cuckoos and their hosts, and Professor Davies has recently published \u2018Cuckoo: cheating by nature\u2019 (Bloomsbury), as well as having previously co-authored a number of definitive primers on Behavioural Ecology.\n\nLectures during our tours\n\nAll our tours are accompanied by an academic \u2018trip scholar\u2019 as well as local guides. The local guide or guides\u00a0provide the day-to-day guiding on our tours, whilst the trip lecturer will give regular lectures on his\/her\u00a0specialist subject throughout to provide an academic overview. Lectures\/talks usually last 30-40 minutes\u00a0including questions and answers (if applicable). These are generally held in the evenings before dinner and\u00a0attendance is optional. We don\u2019t usually specify before travel which days the lectures will be given (for\u00a0operational reasons) but guests can expect them roughly every other day as a minimum, with some\u00a0lecturers giving some kind of talk or presentation more frequently.\n\nOptional Post-Tour: 3 night\/4 day Osa Peninsula and Corcovado National Park\n\nFor those with more time, we have arranged an optional group post-tour with local guides to what National Geographic has termed \u201cthe most biologically intense place on earth\u201d, the Parque Nacional Corcovado. The last great tract of original tropical rainforest in Pacific Central America, it is home to dozens of endangered species including Baird\u2019s tapir, the elusive giant anteater and the spectacularly large harpy eagle.\n\n\n25 April 2018: \u00a0\u00a0San Jose to Oso Peninsula\nLeave before the main group early this morning for a transfer to the local airport and a 60 minute flight to Palmar Sur in the south of the country. You will be met by your local guide and transferred to Sierpe from where a 90 minute boat journey down the Sierpe River then the Pacific coast, observing the mangrove wetlands on the way, takes you to Casa Corcovado Jungle Lodge. Check in for a three night stay. The Four Star Casa Corcovado Jungle Lodge offers the closest accommodation to Corcovado National Park and is set in lovely surroundings above a palm-fringed beach in 170 acres of private tropical rainforest. The afternoon is at leisure to explore the beach, hiking trails and swimming pools at the lodge.\n\n26 April 2018: \u00a0\u00a0Corcovado National Park\nHave breakfast at the lodge before beginning the day\u2019s exploration. Starting out from the lodge with your naturalist guide head into Corcovado National Park. The cool morning hours offer a good opportunity to spot wildlife and to observe some of the incredible variety of birds that abound in the park. Along the trail your guide will have a chance to tell you some of the fascinating stories about life in the rainforest and you can hope to spot white faced capuchin, red-tailed squirrel, collared peccary, white nosed coati and northern tamandua, with birdlife including pairs of scarlet macaws and mangrove black hawk. Later, coming down through the forest you will find a river and then discover an incredible waterfall. Now is your chance to cool off in one of the shaded pools of the... (truncated)",

        "text":"Why Visit Bournemouth\n\nLast updated on March 2nd, 2020 at 07:02 pm\n\nWhy visit Bournemouth Beach\n\nBournemouth is located on the South Coast of England, surrounded by the beauty of the New Forest, the crashing waves of the English Channel and the award-winning seven miles of golden sandy beaches.\u00a0 There are many reasons to visit Bournemouth for your summer holiday.\n\nThings to do in Bournemouth\n\nBournemouth has an abundance of wonderful locations, events and experiences for visitors and residents alike to enjoy in and around this cosmopolitan town nestled beside the sea.\n\nJourney back to the beginning of time on the Jurassic coast\n\nThe Dorset Coastline, known as the Jurassic Coast, is the only natural location in England that has been given World Heritage Site status, and for good reason. The 95 miles of Jurassic rock upon which this coastal portion of Dorset sits holds secrets dating back as far as 185 million years ago. Other World Heritage sites include the Grand Canyon, the Great Barrier Reef, the Pyramids and the Taj Mahal \u2013 so this is quite some honour!\n\n\nHengistbury Head\n\nOther historical sites of interest when visiting Bournemouth include Hengistbury Head, a local nature reserve which has been designated a protected special area of conservation due to the large variety of wildlife that reside there throughout the year, as well as for the history surrounding the site \u2013 ancient settlers dating back as far as 12,500 years ago once lived on this spot though at that time the land extended further into the sea and thus the settlement was located further inland. However, erosion has played its hand and now Hengistbury sits on the very edge of the English Channel.\n\nHengistbury Head\n\nReserve at least 2 hours to enjoy Hengistbury Head\n\nThe reserve is a beautiful location to visit if you have a spare couple of hours whilst in Bournemouth. Take a walk to the top of Hengisbury Head to enjoy stunning views of Christchurch, Mudeford and the Isle of Wight, and on your way back down the hill stop off at The Hiker Caf\u00e9 to enjoy a delicious leisurely lunch or tasty Cappuccino.\n\nThe historic town of Christchurch\n\nSwan on the river in ChristchurchAnd finally, a visit to the historic town of Christchurch where one can wander around the wonderful Norman ruins of Christchurch Castle, or visit Place Mill, the Anglo-Saxon Watermill on the quayside.\n\nFrom the quay one can take a short ferry ride over to Mudeford and Hengistbury Head, and also to neighbouring Wick, \u2013 this service being historical itself since it first began transporting villagers around 1880.\n\nIn the summer months pack up a picnic to take with you whilst you sit and soak up the rays and enjoy the comings and goings of the Christchurch swans and other wildlife, as well as local sailors and fisherman enjoying Christchurch Harbour.\n\nReturn to Bournemouth Beach\n\nAfter all this gallivanting around Dorset, a little rest and relaxation are in order, so pack up your beach bag and head for the soft sand and glistening waters of the English Channel. Many of the beaches in Bournemouth hold Blue Flag status for meeting high standards of cleanliness in water quality and environmental management.\n\nEnjoy the warmth of the sun and take a stroll from Bournemouth Beach Pier to Boscombe Pier grabbing an ice cream along the way as you pass the vibrantly coloured beach huts that adorn the boardwalk.\n\nBournemouth beach huts\n\nEating out in Bournemouth\n\nAnd finally, to round off the day following a delicious dinner at one of the many fine restaurants Bournemouth has to offer, there is practically a restaurant with cuisine to suit most tastes, including Indian, Middle Eastern (Charminster), Chinese, Japanese (sushi), Italian, French and modern European fusion.\n\nHow about taking in a show at the BIC (Bournemouth International Centre).\n\nWhere to stay in Bournemouth\n\nYou\u2019ll be spoilt for choice with the many excellent Bournemouth Hotels that stretch from the quiet and less populated beaches of Southbourne and historical Hengistbury Head to the more commercial sea view accommodations scattered along the Eastcliff.\n\nTraditional seaside guesthouses\n\nHead on westwards a short distance and you\u2019ll find yourself in popular Westcliff where you\u2019ll discover a selection of traditional Bournemouth guesthouses. This area is popular due to its close proximity to sandy Bournemouth Beach as well as the busy Bournemouth Shopping Centre, and pretty Bournemouth Gardens.\n\nIs Bournemouth the happiest town to live in the UK?\n\nWell, according to the BBC, a poll of 6,000 people in 2007 say that it is the happiest place. Whether that still holds true is another matter, but one thing for sure Bournemouth is a serious UK destination for a weekend visit or a summer holiday.\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here",

The first half we had a tour guide, Brendan. He was very knowledgeable and gave us some real insight with stories of those that sacrificed to save others. Very moving! We did the self guided museum tour which was so informative and then the observatory. So blessed we got to experience this and pay our respects to so many brave souls. Would definitely recommend.\n,\u00a0Sep 2021\nMost memorable was how the iconic ball of Peace art sculpture was put back together the best way possible with it's original pieces found after being destroyed during 9\/11 attack.\nFascinating, emotional, and reverent.\n,\u00a0Sep 2021\nOur guides presentation was very well done, I would highly recommend this tour. The little known facts were fascinating and really added to our subsequent visit to the 911 museum. The museum was a highly emotional and reverent experience.\n1 traveler found this review helpful\n,\u00a0Jul 2021\nIt was amazing! Our tour guide Andrew was very personable, informative and all-around good guy! Nice\nFabulous 911 Tour\n,\u00a0Jul 2021\nOur tour guide Andrew was extremely informative and pleasant. In addition to giving us a tremendous education on so many of the details surrounding this tragic 9\/11 event, he took time to photograph our family at Key landmarks and went the extra distance to make us feel very welcome to his tour.\nFantastic !\n,\u00a0Jun 2021\nAndrew was great ! So informative with a personal touch . This tour is one of the best we\u2019ve done ! Highly recommend museum and observation deck , but plan on five hours for the whole thing . And we still didn\u2019t see everything! So good !\n1 traveler found this review helpful\nVery Emotional......\n,\u00a0Sep 2020\nWe did this tour 4 days before the 911 anniversary. It was very emotional to hear the story. Especially from the many people who actually lived it. Then to be standing so close to where it happened was scary. I took my family of teenagers who all said they learnt something new about the events of that day. Andrew our guide was great. He answered our questions and made stops for us to take pictures. You could tell he is very passionate about what he does. If you are in New York, I would recommend this tour. You will leave with a new perspective and a new respect for what happened that day.\nGreat tour\n,\u00a0Mar 2020\nAndrew did a great job! Unfortunately the museum was closed along with the memorial but we still thoroughly enjoyed our tour.\n9\/11 tour\n,\u00a0Mar 2020\nGood story of the fire fighters response on 9\/11; one feels proud of their commitment. Branden brings that out\nFantastic Guide!!\n,\u00a0Jan 2020\nTour guide Andrew was superb. Genuine, nice guy and full of knowledge.

You have dinner in a separate location\/ dining area from the show and after dinner you have a short walk to the theatre and see the show. It was fun Elvis, Michael Jackson and Celine Dion performed for us with Hawaiian dancers.\n\nUSD 95.98",

With walks along the River Oich and the Great Glen cycle route close by, you should pack your bikes and walking boots and enjoy the countryside around Loch Ness and the Great Glen.\n\nWildwood nestles in the forests surrounding Fort Augustus, this is a tranquil and beautiful location, yet within 2 miles of the village and the most famous loch in the world \u2013 Loch Ness. There are many trails through the surrounding forests and alongside the picturesque River Oich. A leisurely walk takes you to Fort Augustus with the historic Caledonian Canal Locks \u2013 the gateway to Loch Ness.\n\nDuring the holiday season the village bustles with visitors and is a popular holiday venue, with its many cafes, restaurants and bars. As Fort Augustus is geographically right in the heart of the Highlands it makes an ideal base for your Highland holiday.\n\nThe magnificent west coast, with its white sandy beaches, and the magical Isle of Skye are all within a leisurely days drive. Aonach Mor, where you can take a gondola ride and experience a spectacular view of the Great Glen and Ben Nevis is only about \u00bd hours drive. Winter skiing is available and downhill mountain biking in the summer months. A must is the Jacobite Steam Train journey from Fort William to Mallaig, which crosses the viaduct made famous in the Harry Potter films \u2013 one of the finest railway journeys in the world. For a spot of retail therapy, Inverness the capital of the Highlands is about 40 minutes drive.\n\nWith the mysterious Loch Ness and all its secrets virtually on your doorstep you do not have to venture far. Take a boat trip on Loch Ness in your own quest of finding that elusive \u201cmonster\u201d or experience the quiet and very beautiful south side of Loch Ness. With walks by the river or canal, along with the many forest walks you will find plenty to keep you occupied. The Caledonian Canal runs through the heart of the village so you can watch the boats manoeuvring the lock gates on their way through the Great Glen.\n\nWildwood is a private and secluded retreat ideal for the discerning holiday maker with deer and other wildlife right on your doorstep. Pine martens and red squirrels are often seen visiting the garden. The lounge at Wildwood is located on the 1st floor to take advantage of the magificent views and has a wood burning stove for those colder evenings. Whether you are sight seeing, actively seeking adventure - or taking time out to relax from everyday life, (perhaps with the odd game of golf) this place will hold you in awe.\n\nIf your heart is set on a holiday in a log cabin and Wildwood is booked then why not have a look our similar properties that can be found on the Log Cabins page.\n\n\nMore information\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Utility\/boot room, views out towards the forest.

Kids are older now and it was perfect for a single family of five. Fabulous location.\n\nReviewed this property on 19\/09\/2020\nAnd awarded it\nWe had a wonderful week at Wildwood Cottage, Fort Augustus. The property was well above expectations, tastefully furnished and spacious. The location was amazing, exactly what we were looking for. Lots of lovely river and woodland walks on the door step. Would definitely recommend and would like to go again.\n\nReviewed this property on 15\/11\/2016\nAnd awarded it\nWe rented Wildwood at Fort Augustus for a week and had the best time, our holiday started on 5th November and it was very mild. The wildlife there is amazing. Deer, pine martins, badger and so many birds. We were feeding them 2 pints of seed per day not including fat balls and suet. The property was spotless and there is everything there to make your stay so comfortable. We wish we booked 2 weeks now. If you book this property you won't regret it.\n\nReviewed this property on 27\/10\/2016\nAnd awarded it\nExcellent, fantastic, superb !!! A wonderful stay in a lovely property in the 'Wilderness', well almost. A short walk (1.5M) to Fort Augustus, beautiful surroundings and so many sights to go and see. Will definitely be returning again. The property is lovely and cozy with the wood burner, wildlife on the doorstep. An Excellent stay - Many Thanks A1++++\n\nReviewed this property on 16\/10\/2015\nAnd awarded it\nWe loved our stay at Wildwood. Peaceful setting, close but not too close to Fort Augustus. Clean and pleasant cabin. Would definitely recommend.\n\nReviewed this property on 19\/04\/2014\nAnd awarded it\nBeautiful furnished cottage with woodland stunning views. Fantastic holiday overall lots to do and see. Would highly recommend this cottage and it's location.\n\nReviewed this property on 12\/11\/2013\nAnd awarded it\nIf its peace and tranquillity you are after then Wildwood is for you. I took a book with me to read and didn't get past chapter 1 as the view from the window in the upstairs living area is stunning. The cabin is well equipped for your stay and very comfortable. The downstairs bathroom looks newly fitted out and the standard is good throughout. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Wildwood and so did our dog!\n\nReviewed this property on 04\/06\/2013\nAnd awarded it\nWildwood is a stunning property set in the perfect wooded location but only a mile from the village. Walks start from every angle on your doorstep, wildlife, peace and quite in equal measure. The property has everything you need, extremely clean and tidy. With two rooms on each floor that are seperate to the living spaces it is perfect for two families or friends. Highly recommended. Thanks.\n\nReviewed this property on 11\/03\/2013\nAnd awarded it\nVery disappointed, not to see the pine martins! We put bread and jam out every morning which disappeared without trace. We arrived when there was remains of snow on the roof and ground, the cottage standing out from the surrounding woodland. Once inside we made ourselves at home very easily, everything we needed was there especially the log fire which our great dane loved to curl up to each night. Extremely enjoyable peaceful stay. Look forward to returning soon (and seeing those pine martins).\n\nReviewed this property on 23\/10\/2012\nAnd awarded it\nThe lodge is exactly as stated. Woodland walks from the doors - ideal forest roads for cycling too. The single track road from Fort Augustus is much better than other single tracks in Scotland. So quiet and peaceful but with the TV to keep grumpy teenagers happy who have an allergy to fresh air - it catered for all. All the rooms were clean and fresh, no evidence of previous dog. Perfect for star gazing with the darker nights. Really enjoyable.\n\nReviewed this property on 25\/05\/2011\nAnd awarded it\nWOW, from the moment we turned the corner and saw our cabin it was like being in paradise, it was as magical inside as it was out, we didn't want to leave the children all decided that we should buy the cabin and stay there forever, it was so nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of life and look out onto so much beauty the cabin was set out perfectly, we are one hundred percent going back next year\n\nReviewed this property on 14\/09\/2010\nAnd awarded it\nhi will stayed at wild wood 28.8 2010. we had a great time. the weather was good to us . the log cabin was great. there was lots of walks around. we went on a boat trip which was great. the royal Scot which is at fort Augustus which is only a 20 min walk from the cabin. the Jacobite steam train from fortwilliam to mallaig was great. we even saw the pine martins at night. the down side was after 13 hrs drive the washing machine did not work the shower in the master bedroom did not work,\n\nReviewed this property on 06\/10\/2009\nAnd awarded it\n16th - 19th September 09 -...
