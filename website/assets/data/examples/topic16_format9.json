        "text":"Thursday Top Ten: fantasy books to encourage children to read\n\nI Heart Booksphoto credit: flickr\n\nTwo strong predictors of future academic success for our youngest children, when you have a supportive family life, are vocabulary and being read to daily. Simply put, the more hours a child spends reading and being read to coupled with a\u00a0 large vocabulary, the better off children will be.\n\nFor older children, reading comprehension is the single most important skill your child will need to learn, both to have that academic success and to become a life-long reader and knowledge-seeker. Academic success will only get us so far in life. We want to encourage our children to be curious, to ask questions, to seek answers, to love to learn and explore, and to always, always be thinking.\n\nThe most effective way to accomplish all of these things and have fun doing it is to read, read, read aloud to your children as much as possible and to choose books and stories that you and your children are invested in. For this, I highly suggest visiting your local library often to explore the vast range it has to offer.\n\nOld Booksphoto credit: flickr\n\nFor the most opportunities for learning, choose books that are highly imaginative: fairies, dragons, giants, magic, time travel, pirates\u2026 fantasy. Reading fantasy can lead to greater curiosity about the natural world, challenge the imagination, and encourage creative writing. Fantasy can lead our children to other worlds and teach them to be better citizens of ours.\n\nThe books on the following list are all ones that we have actually read, or are currently reading. This is not a theoretical top ten list, or a top ten list of the most wonderfully written children\u2019s fantasy books, but it is a top ten list of books that my children have loved and have asked to read again. My oldest son has also chosen to read many of these to himself after we have read them together. They are tried and true and I hope your children love them too.\n\nTop Ten Fantasy Books, listed from easiest to most difficult:\n\n1. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak \u2013 \u201cAnd the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws.\u201d\n\nWho hasn\u2019t felt something like a wild thing from time to time? Knowing that even after behaving like one and becoming king of all, you can still come home to your own room to a warm meal, is the best kind of love. If you have a Max, or even if you don\u2019t, there is something special about this book that keeps us reading it over and over again.\n\n2. Harold and the Purple Crayon 50th Anniversary Edition (Purple Crayon Books) by Crockett Johnson \u2013 \u201cOne night, after thinking it over for some time, Harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight.\u201d\n\nOh, how I love this gentle story exploring the imagination of a little boy and his purple crayon. I love how he keeps his wits, goes on adventures, and helps deserving animals have pie feasts, all with the power of his purple crayon.\n\n3. Raising Dragons by Jerdine Nolen \u2013 \u201cThe same way Pa knew that farming was in his blood, I knew that raising dragons was in mine. There are some things you just know.\u201d\n\nWhat little girl doesn\u2019t dream of raising her very own dragon? Well she certainly will after reading this book. The daughter of practical farmers finds her true calling when the egg she discovers hatches a dragon. She knows that she was meant to raise this dragon and so she does until she has to take him back to his tropical homeland due to the overwhelming crowds and attention he draws. Sweet, loving, and a book the whole family can enjoy together.\n\n4. Commander Toad series by Jane Yolen \u2013 \u201cLong green ships fly through space past the winking of a thousand thousand stars. There is one ship, one mighty ship, long and green, called Star Warts. The captain of this ship is brave and bright, bright and brave. His name is COMMANDER TOAD.\u201d\n\nFor children who can\u2019t get enough of Star Wars, but who (or who\u2019s parents) might be looking for something a little different, this is the series! With seven books altogether and plenty of puns, this will keep early readers busy and provide fun material for more experienced readers.\n\n5. Magic Tree House Series by Mary Pope Osbourne \u2013 \u201cThere\u2013at the top\u2013was a tree house. It was tucked between two branches.\u201d And so began the many adventures of Jack and Annie, through time and through books.\n\nMy boys love these books. There is just enough adventure and magic with just enough history to keep it interesting for kids and parents alike. My 7 year old has never wanted to read the series in order and skips around to the subjects he finds most interesting. Each book gives an opportunity to learn more about a time or place that has some historical significance and has prompted some wonderful conversations: mummies in ancient Egypt, rainforests in the Amazon, Vikings and Irish monks, and even the American Civil War.\n\n6. The Enchanted Wood, The Faraway Tree ,and The Folk of The Faraway Tree by Enid Blyton \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a simply enormous tree,\u201d said Jo. \u201cIts top goes right up to the clouds-and oh, Dick, at the top of it is always some strange land. You can go there by climbing up the top branch of the Faraway Tree, going up a little ladder through a hole in the big cloud that always lies on the top of the tree -and there you are in some peculiar land!\u201d\n\nThese books were lovingly introduced to me by Read Aloud Dad. I just knew we had to get one from the library for my 5 year old\u2019s first chapter book at bedtime. It was a huge hit! This is the book for children who want to listen to stories about three children (and later their cousin too) going on adventures in an Enchanted Wood with a magical Faraway Tree inhabited by angry pixies, fairies, a saucepan man, and Moon-face (so called because of his very round face) where Lands with names like, The Land of Ice and Snow, The Land of Take-What-You-Want, or The Land of Birthdays visit the top of the tree for a short time and then change again.\n\nWe are reading the original books, no editing of the 1930\u2019s British names or anything else. It has been quite interesting to read a book in English and not understand many of the things they say because of the differences in time and place.\n\n7. Where the Mountain Meets the Moon by Grace Lin \u2013 \u201cWhat a poor fortune we have. Every day, Ba and Ma work and work and we still have nothing. I wish I could change our fortune.\u201d\n\nMinli and her parents work very hard living in the shadow of Fruitless Mountain, yet remain in desperate poverty. Minli\u2019s father tells old folktales every night to keep their minds off their circumstances. His stories include the Jade Dragon, Magistrate Tiger, and the Old Man of the Moon who keeps the book of everyone\u2019s destiny. Minli decides one day to seek the Old Man of the Moon to change her family\u2019s fortune. Along the way she meets a wonderful cast of characters \u2013 a flightless dragon and a talking fish among others \u2013 that help her in her quest. A beautifully woven tale with strong morals and enough adventure and fantasy to satisfy all curious minds!\n\n8. When You Reach Me by Rebecca Stead \u2013 \u201cSometimes you never feel meaner than the moment you stop being mean. It\u2019s like how turning on a light makes you realize how dark the room had gotten. And the way you usually act, the things you would have normally done, are like these ghosts that everyone can see but pretends not to.\u201d\n\nMiranda is a fairly ordinary sixth grader growing up in 1970\u2019s New York when her life is changed by a message from the future. The novel follows ordinary themes like independence and friendship, interweaving them with mystery and time travel. Three plot lines \u2013 Miranda\u2019s mom preparation for and appearance on The $20,000 Pyramid, Miranda\u2019s oldest friend Sal suddenly not talking with her, and the appearance of a strange laughing man \u2013 all come together at the end in an unpredictable conclusion that will keep children engaged until the very end.\n\nMiranda\u2019s favorite book is Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s A Wrinkle in Time. This sold me on at least trying this book out, plus it is a Newberry Medal winner. Deservedly so. This is a subtle, character driven novel that may be best suited for the ages it was intended for, but my 6 year old absolutely loved it.\n\n9. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin \u2013 \u201cTo be oneself is a rare thing, and a great one.\u201d\n\nLong before Harry Potter, was another youth with a talent for magic and recklessness. A coming of age story with magic and adventure at the center. \u201cGed was the greatest sorcerer in all Earthsea,\u00a0\u00a0but once he was called Sparrowhawk, a reckless\u00a0\u00a0youth, hungry for power and knowledge, who tampered with long-held secrets and loosed a terrible shadow upon the world. This is the tale of his testing, how he mastered the mighty words of power, tamed an ancient dragon, and crossed death\u2019s threshold to restore the balance.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, we have only just begun this book, but any book that has been given as high praise as this one deserves to be on this list. Plus she is a local author!\n\n10. The BFG by Roald Dahl \u2013 \u201cThe witching hour, somebody had once whispered to her, was a special moment in the middle of the night when every child and every grown-up was in a deep deep sleep, and all the dark things came out from hiding and had the world all to themselves.\u201d\n\nThis is the darkest of all the books listed here. My son could handle the idea that there were giants sneaking about in the middle of the night searching for \u201chuman beans\u201d to gobble up, but there certainly may be some that will not. The BFG is The Big Friendly Giant for he does not partake in the guzzling and munching of human beans like the rest of the giants.\n\nOne night, a little girl named Sophie sees the BFG and he takes her away back to his home in giant land. He keeps her safe and protected from the other giants, but is afraid to let her go because she has seen him. Instead they come up with a plot to stop all t... (truncated)",

        "text":"Top Ten Tuesday: Titles or Covers That Made Me Want to Read\/Buy the Book\n\nTop Ten Tuesday was created by\u00a0The Broke and the Bookish\u00a0in June of 2010 and was moved to\u00a0That Artsy Reader Girl\u00a0in January of 2018. It was born of a love of lists, a love of books, and a desire to bring bookish friends together.\n\nPrevious Top Ten Tuesday Topics\n\nWhat is it that leads to me to buy a book?\n\nOftentimes, it is not the cover or the title \u2013 which poses some problems for this specific task. There are certain authors whose books I will buy because of the author \u2013 when authors like Patrick Ness, China\u00a0Mi\u00e9ville, Kate Atkinson, Akwaeke Emezi, Susan Hill, Tana French, Frances Hardinge release a book, it feels like an event \u2013 or because of the quality of their previous books. Occasionally because it is an entry in a series although I have found myself increasingly moving away from reading series recently \u2013 but the sequel to Ninth House will be picked up rapidly, or Sanderson\u2019s Cytonic series and of course his Stormlight Archive. So maybe I am still reading series.\n\nBook prize nominations and longlists are also great sources to find new authors: I do try to follow the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction and the Booker Prize (this year\u2019s longlist announced a few days ago) and the Carnegie Medal for Young Adult Fiction.\n\nThese TTTs \u2013 and recommendations from friends generally are also a great way to find new reads too: I often have my journal to hand and Goodreads open on another tab to swell my tbr \u2013 hence Casey McQuiston, Jasper Fforde, Becky Chambers, T J Klune and Kalynn Bayron have crept onto my radar.\n\nBut covers and titles in the abstract, not so much\u2026. but there have been the occasional one that caught my eye whilst browsing through the local bookshops and have ended up on my TBR list. These are the ten most recent evenly divided between titles and covers.\n\n\nNightbitch, Rachel Yoder\n\nOne day, the mother was a mother but then, one night, she was quite suddenly something else\u2026\n\nAt home full-time with her two-year-old son, an artist finds she is struggling. She is lonely and exhausted. She had imagined \u2013 what was it she had imagined? Her husband, always travelling for his work, calls her from faraway hotel rooms. One more toddler bedtime, and she fears she might lose her mind.\n\nInstead, quite suddenly, she starts gaining things, surprising things that happen one night when her child will not sleep. Sharper canines. Strange new patches of hair. New appetites, new instincts. And from deep within herself, a new voice\u2026\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nThis time is was the word bitch \u2013 a word I still find more shocking than I would expect! \u2013 and the blurb when I did look into it a little more also sounded\u2026 well\u2026 brilliant!\n\nHow To Kill Your Family, Bella Mackie\n\n\u00b7 Kill my family\n\u00b7 Make a claim on their fortune\n\u00b7 Get away with the above\n\u00b7 Adopt a dog\n\nMeet Grace Bernard.\nDaughter, sister, colleague, friend, serial killer\u2026\nGrace has lost everything. And now she wants revenge.\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nAh, the temptation to revel in fantasies of family murder\u2026. perfectly natural, yes? Also I has heard Bella Mackie and her husband Greg James on BBC Radio 4\u2019s A Good Read and they sounded such a lovely warm bookish couple!\n\nMrs Death Misses Death, Salena Godden\n\nMrs Death has had enough. She is exhausted from spending eternity doing her job and now she seeks someone to unburden her conscience to. Wolf Willeford, a troubled young writer, is well acquainted with death, but until now hadn\u2019t met Death in person \u2013 a black, working-class woman who shape-shifts and does her work unseen.\n\nEnthralled by her stories, Wolf becomes Mrs Death\u2019s scribe, and begins to write her memoirs. Using their desk as a vessel and conduit, Wolf travels across time and place with Mrs Death to witness deaths of past and present and discuss what the future holds for humanity. As the two reflect on the losses they have experienced \u2013 or, in the case of Mrs Death, facilitated \u2013 their friendship grows into a surprising affirmation of hope, resilience and love. All the while, despite her world-weariness, Death must continue to hold humans\u2019 fates in her hands, appearing in our lives when we least expect her . . .\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nThe silly silly pun! I love a good pun, and a bad one for that matter!\n\nThe Living Sea of Waking Dreams, Richard Flanagan\n\nIn a world of perennial fire and growing extinctions, Anna\u2019s aged mother is dying\u2015if her three children would just allow it. Condemned by their pity to living she increasingly escapes through her hospital window into visions of horror and delight.\n\nWhen Anna\u2019s finger vanishes and a few months later her knee disappears, Anna too feels the pull of the window. She begins to see that all around her others are similarly vanishing, but no one else notices. All Anna can do is keep her mother alive. But the window keeps opening wider, taking Anna and the reader ever deeper into a strangely beautiful novel about hope and love and orange-bellied parrots.\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nThis title is just a thing of beauty! Poetic, lyrical, rich\u2026 it gives nothing away!\n\nAt Night All Blood Is Black, David Diop\n\nAlfa and Mademba are two of the many Senegalese soldiers fighting in the Great War. Together they climb dutifully out of their trenches to attack France\u2019s German enemies whenever the whistle blows, until Mademba is wounded, and dies in a shell hole with his belly torn open.\n\nWithout his more-than-brother, Alfa is alone and lost amidst the savagery of the conflict. He devotes himself to the war, to violence and death, but soon begins to frighten even his own comrades in arms. How far will Alfa go to make amends to his dead friend?\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nAgain, it is the beauty of this title \u2013 the iambic beat to it\n\n\nThe Chosen and the Beautiful, Nghi Vo\n\nJordan Baker grows up in the most rarefied circles of 1920s American society\u2013she has money, education, a killer golf handicap, and invitations to some of the most exclusive parties of the Jazz Age. She\u2019s also queer and Asian, a Vietnamese adoptee treated as an exotic attraction by her peers, while the most important doors remain closed to her.\n\nBut the world is full of wonders: infernal pacts and dazzling illusions, lost ghosts and elemental mysteries. In all paper is fire, and Jordan can burn the cut paper heart out of a man. She just has to learn how.\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nJust look at the cover here, it is absolutely gorgeous! The white and black, the way it captures the period\u2026 and again once looked it up and saw that it was a queer Asian retelling of The Great Gatsby\u2026.\n\nAriadne, Jennifer Saint\n\nAs Princesses of Crete and daughters of the fearsome King Minos, Ariadne and her sister Phaedra grow up hearing the hoofbeats and bellows of the Minotaur echo from the Labyrinth beneath the palace. The Minotaur \u2013 Minos\u2019s greatest shame and Ariadne\u2019s brother \u2013 demands blood every year.\n\nWhen Theseus, Prince of Athens, arrives in Crete as a sacrifice to the beast, Ariadne falls in love with him. But helping Theseus kill the monster means betraying her family and country, and Ariadne knows only too well that in a world ruled by mercurial gods \u2013 drawing their attention can cost you everything.\n\nIn a world where women are nothing more than the pawns of powerful men, will Ariadne\u2019s decision to betray Crete for Theseus ensure her happy ending? Or will she find herself sacrificed for her lover\u2019s ambition?\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nThe gold and blue colour scheme is just gorgeous here! And the gold was sparkly! Alas, it did not transfer quite so beautifully to my electronic version\u2026.\n\nThe Library of the Dead, T. L. Huchu\n\nRopa dropped out of school to become a ghostalker \u2013 and she now speaks to Edinburgh\u2019s dead, carrying messages to the living. A girl\u2019s gotta earn a living, and it seems harmless enough. Until, that is, the dead whisper that someone\u2019s bewitching children \u2013 leaving them husks, empty of joy and life. It\u2019s on Ropa\u2019s patch, so she feels honour bound to investigate. But what she learns will change her world.\n\nShe\u2019ll dice with death (not part of her life plan . . .) as she calls on Zimbabwean magic and Scottish pragmatism to hunt down clues. For Edinburgh hides a wealth of secrets. And in the process, she discovers an occult library and some unexpected allies. Yet as shadows lengthen, will the hunter become the hunted?\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nThe cityscape \/ street plan background to the title was really eye catching. And also libraries in books!\n\nThe Mermaid of Black Conch, Monique Roffey\n\nNear the island of Black Conch, a fisherman sings to himself while waiting for a catch. But David attracts a sea-dweller that he never expected \u2013 Aycayia, an innocent young woman cursed by jealous wives to live as a mermaid.\n\nWhen American tourists capture Aycayia, David rescues her and vows to win her trust. Slowly, painfully, she transforms into a woman again. Yet as their love grows, they discover that the world around them is changing \u2013 and they cannot escape the curse for ever . . .\n\nWhat caught my attention?\n\nThe vibrancy of the colours here: the red and yellow heat of the sun contrasting with the cool blue of the mermaid herself\u2026. and also, of course, the word \u201cmermaid\u201d in the title is always a draw!\n\nWhirligig, Andrew James Grieg\n\nJust outside a sleepy Highland town, a gamekeeper is found hanging lifeless from a tree. The local police investigate an apparent suicide, only to find he\u2019s been snared as efficiently as the rabbit suspended beside him. As the body count rises, the desperate hunt is on to find the murderer before any more people die.\n\nBut the town doesn\u2019t give up its secrets easily, and who makes the intricate clockwork mechanisms carved from bone and wood found at each crime? Whirligig is a tartan noir like no other; an expose of the corruption pervading a small Highland community and the damage this inflicts on society\u2019s most vulnerable.

        "text":"5 Guidelines for Writing a Strong Female Character\n\n[Banner image courtesy of flickr by\u00a0Blue Stahli Lu\u00e2n]\n\nPeople talk a lot about writing strong female characters. Writers and readers everywhere always seem excited when a story features a female as the main protagonist. This is likely because of the seeming rarity of such stories. We could cite examples to the contrary all day, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the stereotypical storybook \u201chero\u201d throughout literary history has been a man. In this light, it could be a relatively new thing, this female hero. It\u2019s becoming more prevalent, but is still rare enough that the gaming distribution platform Steam has a specific tag for\u00a0\u201cfemale protagonist.\u201d\n\nBut what does it take for a female character to be \u201cstrong\u201d? Well, here\u2019s some tips to help examine your literary laudable lady.\n\n1. Badass characters are not necessarily strong characters.\n\nThe difference here might be a bit self-explanatory, but it\u2019s also an important one to understand. One might watch a movie and see a female character who makes a habit of making incredible acrobatic stunts whilst simultaneously beating up dozens of bad guys. They\u2019ll see this character and say that she\u2019s a \u201cstrong\u201d female character. But what they really mean is that she\u2019s a badass.\n\nContrary to common belief, this doesn\u2019t make a character \u201cstrong.\u201d A strong character is a well-written character; a character with depth, personality, flaws, strengths, and attachments. A strong character is one that makes mistakes and learns from them. A character\u2019s worth is not defined by the number of enemy grunts they can dispatch in a single scene.\n\nThis is not to say that a well-written character cannot also be a badass. A good example is the animated cartoon series The Legend of Korra, which features a female as both heroine and protagonist. She has a very strong character arc, beginning as an ambitious, arrogant, headstrong warrior and eventually developing into a spiritual leader and peacekeeper. She has very real struggles along the way, including both internal and external conflicts. She suffers from her own faults and benefits from her own strengths. Plus, she\u2019s also pretty good at beating up the bad guys.\n\n2. Strong female characters should have lives outside of romance.\n\nScreenwriters and authors frequently make the critical error of writing a female character\u2014often the only female character\u2014into a story for the major purpose of creating romantic tension for the male characters. There are far too many examples of this oversight to count. Some writers make a minimal effort to provide the female character with some helpful traits, but all too often it is only to help progress the male protagonist\u2019s story arc. Female characters often aren\u2019t allowed to have their own story arc.\n\nEven the classic fantasy film series\u00a0Lord of the Rings is guilty of this. The character of Arwen has little relevance to the overall story, and merely acts as a romantic foil for Aragorn. She exists within the narrative to add depth to Aragorn.\n\n3. Use the Bechdel Test.\n\nThe Bechdel Test can be useful when determining whether a story supports two or more strong, active female characters. It specifically refers to films, but is easily applied to other forms of storytelling. A film passes the Bechdel Test if it has:\n\n  1. two named female characters\n  2. who talk to each other\n  3. about something other than a man.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple enough method, and certainly not definitive, though it is useful as a general tool. This hearkens back to the previous point that female characters have lives outside of romance. In a realistic story, women\u2019s lives don\u2019t revolve around a man\u2019s. Female characters can be integral to the plot of the story without necessitating a sudden romance.\n\n4. Use the Mako Mori Test.\n\nThe Mako Mori Test evolved from discussions following the sci-fi action film Pacific Rim. Interestingly, the film failed the Bechdel Test dismally. In spite of this, viewers found the female lead to be highly compelling. They discussed her character with fondness and respect. Thus, the Mako Mori Test was born as an alternative to the Bechdel. A film passes the Mako Mori Test if it has:\n\n  1. at least one female character\n  2. who gets her own narrative arc\n  3. that is not about supporting a man\u2019s story.\n\nThis helps determine many of the same things that the Bechdel Test does, though from a different angle. Each has their own merits, but all that really matters is taking these lessons into consideration when writing.\n\n5. Write her like she\u2019s a human.\n\nThis is very succinct way of explaining that female characters ought to be written like any other character. Many quickly forgotten Hollywood films portray a cast of male characters with a single female character thrown into the mix. Each character has their own quirk that defines their personality. The quirk of the female character is that she is female.\u00a0She has no particularly outstanding qualities. She might be competent and savvy, but has about as much depth as Smurfette.\n\nFemale characters should be allowed to have their own quirky personalities. Pretty much any character archetype we see among male characters could easily be used for a female as well. In fact, an interesting exercise is to take an existing story and imagine it with all character genders reversed. Oftentimes, it works just as well.\n\nFor example, a beautiful\u00a0article by Michelle Nihjuis explores the idea that Tolkein\u2019s The Hobbit reads spectacularly with Bilbo Baggins being a woman. There are no annoying gender conflicts, no awkward romances, and no female stereotyping. The story remains exactly the same\u2014apart from pronouns\u2014except that it now features a very refreshing tale about a female Bilbo Baggins who goes on a grand adventure.\n\nWomen are awesome, and they ought to be adequately represented in fiction. All too often we have female characters who could not exist in the story without the quirky men who drive the narrative. A female character need not only be there to support the male protagonist\u2019s story arc. With luck we\u2019ll soon move past this concept as a society, allowing women equal representation in the stories we tell\u2014not as sideline characters or devices of romantic tension, but as compelling individuals who help drive the story forward.\n\nThis Week\u2019s Book Recommendation\n\nThe book we\u2019d like to recommend to you today is\u00a0Stormdancer by Jay Kristoff. The setting is reminiscent of Feudal Japan, with elements of magic and steampunk. It tells the story of a dying world and a rebellion facing extinction at the hands of mechanical enforcers and a corrupt shogun. Specifically, this book is significant for the purposes of this article on account of its strong female protagonist. Yukiko is a very real character, with her own flaws and strengths. Her journey throughout the narrative is a powerful one.\n\nCheck out this book and help support the Guild at the same time by buying on Amazon or Audible:\n\nBuy on Amazon | Buy on Audible\n\nNote: This post was originally published in September of 2015.",

Anyways\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s begin!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Way Back to You by Michelle Andreani & Mindi Scott\n\nI added this book to my TBR because I liked the cover & it looked like a contemporary that could possibly be a tear-jerker.\n\n\nStay Until We Break by Mercy Brown\n\nI recently read Loud Is How I Love You by Mercy Brown and enjoyed it so of course I had to add the second book to my TBR. I\u2019m hoping this book is just as entertaining as the first.\n\n\nOne Day Soon by A. Meredith Walters\n\nAfter reading Butterfly Dreams and completely falling in love with it, I now want to read Walter\u2019s other books. I\u2019m hoping they are just as good as Butterfly Dreams.\n\n\n\n\nThe Star-Touched Queen by Roshani Chokshi\n\nThis debut is starting to get some buzz around the book community, but I really only added it because of the cover. I get some TWATD vibes from this book so I\u2019m hoping it is good!\n\n\n\nBeautiful Bastard by Christina Lauren\n\nI\u2019ve been adding all the big name NA books on my TBR so of course \u00a0this book made the list!\n\n\n\nThe Weight of Feathers by Anna-Marie McLemore\n\nThis was a recommended read when I was looking for some fluffy YA contemporaries so I added this one to the list.\n\n\n\nSummer of Supernovas by Darcy Woods\n\nAdded this book solely based on the fact that that cover is ADORABLE! #noregrets!\n\n\nAmour Amour by Krista & Becca Ritchie\n\nThis was also another cover add, but I\u2019ve also heard great things about this sister-author duo and I want to see if their books are as good as everyone says.\n\n\n\nThe Conspiracy of Us by Maggie Hall\n\nI really don\u2019t remember why I added this book to my TBR, but here\u2019s to hoping I like it!\n\n\nDid I Mention I Love You? by Estelle Maskame\n\nI love reading published Wattpad books and I\u2019ve heard really good things about this book so far so I think I am going to like this one!\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0That\u2019s all for this weeks TTT. I\u2019m excited for all these books and I can\u2019t wait to get to them.\u00a0\n\nWhat books have you recently added to your TBR? Let me know in the comments!\n\n\n\n17 thoughts on \u201cTop Ten Tuesday (January 19, 2016):Latest Reads Added to the Ever-Growing\u00a0TBR\n\n  1. The Conspiracy of Us is really, really good! It\u2019s kind of like the movie National Treasure if you\u2019ve seen that. xD Curious to see what you think of it. And I\u2019ve heard some great things about The Weight of Feathers and The Star Touched Queen too. Thanks for sharing and, as always, fabulous choices! \u2764\n\n    Liked by 1 person\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Fresh Ink: New Books Out Today: October 9, 2012\n\nIt\u2019s been a season of Big Meaty Fiction so far, and don\u2019t get me wrong\u2013I love Big Meaty Fiction. But the new releases I\u2019m most excited about this week are nonfiction. Learn some stuff! Make some stuff! Use your noodle!\n\nThe Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee by James Freeman, Caitlin Freeman, and Tara Duggan (Ten Speed Press)\n\nOne of the loveliest moments of my year so far was spent\u00a0reading a book on The High Line, sipping a New Orleans iced coffee from Blue Bottle\u2019s Chelsea location while I recovered from Book Expo. These folks know what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re all about demystifying the process. Because good coffee can and should happen at home!\n\nThis beautifully illustrated book covers coffee sourcing, roasting techniques, instructions for brewing and serving, and recipes for delicious food pairings. It would make a terrific gift for the coffee lovers in your life, and at $24.99 in hardback, it\u2019s a steal compared to many cookbooks. Here\u2019s to drinking good coffee (and not having to leave your house\u2013or even put on pants\u2013before your first shot of caffeine in the morning).\n\n\nBorn This Way: Real Stories of Growing Up Gay edited by Paul Vitagliano (Quirk\u00a0Books)\n\nInspired by the popular site of the same name, this book presents short essays\u2013vignettes, really\u2013about growing up gay. Famous faces like Representative Barney Frank, Perez Hilton, and Sia Furler appear alongside everyday people telling the stories of when they knew they were gay (most were pretty young) and how they came out.\n\nSome of these pieces are sad. Some are heart-warming. Each is inspiring in its own way. And they create a whole that emphasizes our common humanity and provides one more way to support and encourage young LGBTQ people.\n\n\n\nSome Girls, Some Hats and Hitler: A True Love Story Rediscovered by Trudi Kanter (Scribner)\n\nFirst, the true love story part. In 1938, author Trudi Kanter\u2013who was then a hat designer for Vienna\u2019s most fashionable set\u2013met and fell in love with a young businessman named Walter Ehrlich. When Hitler\u2019s troops invaded Austria, Trudi and Walter fled, going from Vienna to Prague to London in search of a safe haven. This is their story.\n\nNow for the rediscovery.\n\nKanter, who died in 1992, originally published this story in 1984 in London, but it failed to find an audience and quickly went out of print. A British editor plucked it out of obscurity last year, and now we have the chance to read it. Take the chance now, while you have it. Make room in your heart for one more Holocaust memoir. This one\u2019s worth it.\n\n\nThere Was A Country: A Personal History of Biafra by Chinua Achebe (The Penguin Press)\n\nIf all you know of Chinua Achebe is Things Fall Apart, here\u2019s an opportunity to understand the defining experience of his life.\n\nAchebe combines history and memoir in this book about the Nigerian civil war (about which, I must confess, I know next to nothing). I haven\u2019t started it yet, and I can hardly wait. It promises to be challenging, educational, and beautifully written\u2013I\u2019d expect nothing less.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat new releases are you excited about today?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisementPut a book in your ears.

        "text":"The Fantasy Novel Back To School List\n\nIt\u2019s September, which means back to school time for a lot of folks. That got me thinking about classic fantasy stories that continue to be taught in schools. I thought it might be interesting to expand on some of those classics and take a look at more current works that play with similar themes and ideas. Here, then, is a list of both - the original classics along with their modern counterparts. This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but just a sampling of some of the better known works. I welcome debates and other recommendations in the comments.\n\nThe Iliad and The Odyssey\n\nIt might not be fair to group these together as they are very different in tone and scope despite both being attributed to Homer. The Iliad is a great military saga with a stunning cast of characters. The Odyssey, an adventure story, focuses in tightly on Odysseus and his men. One thing common to both epics, however, is the intrusion of and manipulation by the gods. In the Iliad, the gods take sides and aid their mortal champions on the field of battle. Athena, Hera, Poseidon, and Hermes side with the Greeks while Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, and Ares side with the Trojans. Later, in the Odyssey, Poseidon works against Odysseus while Athena does her best to aid him.\n\nThis manipulation by divine forces also plays out in the novel, Deathless, by Catherynne M. Valente. Deathless draws on Russian folklore and tells the story of Marya Morevna, who weds Koschei the Deathless. Baba Yaga features prominently in the tale, arranging a series of quests for Marya to complete. But this is also a love story, one more powerful than the quest to regain Helen or Odysseus\u2019s return to Penelope. And all against the backdrop of Stalinist Russia. Valente, like Homer, is a poet, and it shows in her prose.\n\n\n\nBeowulf is the original monster hunter-- slayer of Grendel, Grendel\u2019s mum, and a dragon. Beowulf comes to Hrothgar\u2019s aid to help with the first two, and accomplishes the last after becoming king of his own people.\n\nIt may seem like an unlikely pairing, but this representation of the self-sacrificing monster hunter also plays out in Jim Butcher\u2019s Dresden Files. Bear with me here, because I think it makes sense. Harry Dresden is a wizard detective, yes, but his powers mostly manifest as brute force. He\u2019s always willing to come to the aid of someone in need, and often puts himself out in front to protect others.\n\nFurthermore, without spoiling any of the books, Butcher gives us the sense that one day Harry will push himself too far. That one day he will give it all to save the people around him, the way that Beowulf does. Harry also has a habit of breaking things in his battles, just like Beowulf. And the Dresden Files contains monsters galore.\n\n\nLe Morte d\u2019Arthur\/The Once and Future King\n\nI studied both of these Arthurian works in school. Le Morte d\u2019Arthur, by Sir Thomas Malory, is one of the definitive Arthurian texts (though I find it pretty dry). T. H. White\u2019s The Once and Future King is one of the best modern accounts of the legend of Arthur and draws heavily on Malory\u2019s work. There are plenty of differing versions of the Arthur myth, but many of the key elements remain the same. Arthur becomes king, under the guidance of Merlin, and brings together the knights of his realm in a kingdom the likes of which has never been seen before. Arthur is a force for order in the realm, a uniting force. A banner under which heroes and knights can rally.\n\nI tried to think of something more obscure for this one, but I kept coming back to George R. R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire. Not only does it have a list of knights and heraldry that rivals Malory, but it ultimately plays with the same themes as The Once and Future King. In Martin\u2019s series, there are several kings (or queens), all vying for power, each believing that they are the true ruler that will bring order and stability to the realm. The Once and Future King clearly shows Arthur working against the rule of Might, and yet Arthur ultimately fails because he must maintain peace with Might. Martin\u2019s series likewise shows the violence and chaos that result when leaders and knights try to defend peace and order.\n\n\nA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\n\nOne of Shakespeare\u2019s most fantastic plays, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is full of deception, manipulation and transformation. Oberon makes free with love potions, Puck bewilders and beguiles, and Titania falls in love with a donkey-headed Bottom. All\u2019s well that ends well, but reality in this play is rarely what it seems.\n\nHolly Black takes these ideas into much darker territory in her Curse Workers series starting with White Cat. Cassel Sharpe is a non-powered kid from a family of curse workers, people who can change your luck or your emotions or your memory. They\u2019re criminals, of course, because curse work is illegal. Cassel, naturally, is a con man. Oh, and he killed his best friend a few years back. But when he begins to have strange dreams, and when he notices his brothers acting strange, he starts to uncover a secret. Deception, manipulation, and transformation abound, though this is hardly a comedy.\n\n\nThe Hobbit\n\nIn many ways, I appreciate the The Hobbit more than The Lord of the Rings. It is an adventure story, the Odyssey to LOTR\u2019s Iliad. The stakes in The Hobbit are smaller, but it\u2019s also more of a personal story. The message is also very different, I think, than in The Lord of the Rings. LOTR seems to lament the passing of a certain lifestyle and seems mired in sentimentality about the English rural countryside. The Hobbit, on the other hand, is about a normal person going on an adventure, pushing himself beyond boundaries he thought were rigid, and finding them fluid.\n\nAs mentioned, Bilbo is not necessarily anything special. Yes, he has some Tookish blood that\u2019s supposed to account for his weirdness, but he\u2019s a homebody, a typical Hobbit who likes typical Hobbit-like pursuits. Yet he ends up doing great things. In a similar vein, Deeba in China Mieville's Un Lun Dun is also a normal person. In fact, one of the great things about the novel is that there is a \u201cchosen one\u201d in the form of Deeba\u2019s friend, Zanna. Only Zanna ends up failing and then Deeba steps up, taking it on herself to save UnLondon.\n\nUn Lun Dun is a young adult book, and sometimes is a bit too punny for my tastes, but its subversion of the chosen one trope and championing of the normal person set it apart from other such fantasies.\n\n\nA Wrinkle in Time\n\nMadeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s A Wrinkle in Time gives us a wonderful protagonist in Meg Murry, an awkward, defensive thirteen year old girl whose father is missing. She has low self-esteem and doesn\u2019t get along with others her age or even her teachers at school. As she sets out to save her father, she has to learn to appreciate her differences and use her strengths. In the end she saves her brother through love rather than intelligence or skill. It\u2019s the journey of someone coming to accept themselves and their place.\n\nCas Lowood, the protagonist of Kendara Blake\u2019s Anna Dressed In Blood, has also lost his father, though in this case his father is dead. As a result, Cas now carries on his father\u2019s business, traveling the country and killing ghosts. Unlike Meg, Cas knows how to play people. He\u2019s good looking and knows how to fit in with the popular kids. He even ends up dating the prettiest and most popular girl in high school. But this is all a front. Cas is all business, concerned with killing the ghost, in this case the titular Anna Dressed in Blood. Only Anna isn\u2019t quite the typical ghost, and Cas has to depend on the people around him and learn how to open up. Ultimately he finds his place, like Meg, and accepts that there's more to life than just killing ghosts.\n\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez\u2019s brilliant novel of magical realism gives us generations of the Buend\u00eda family and the weight that that brings to their lives. Not only are they haunted by the past, quite literally, but it dooms them, causing their misfortune to repeat over time.\n\nZack Parson\u2019s Liminal States also deals with generations over time, though perhaps in an even more tragic way, these people carry the memories of those before them. From the beginning, in 1874 in New Mexico, the tale concerns three individuals - Warren Groves, a small town sheriff, his wife, Annie, and Gideon Long, who also loves Annie. Long orchestrates a train robbery that goes very wrong and brings him into conflict with Warren. Meanwhile, Annie is in childbirth. From there, things spiral out of control, especially when Gideon Long discovers a strange pool in an abandoned Pueblo village. The consequences of that discovery resonate through time, into 1951 and beyond. I don\u2019t want to spoil the novel, but Liminal States was one of the best novels I read this year.\n\nWhat do you think? What are some of your favorite fantasy classics, and what are some modern works that explore similar themes?\n\nRajan Khanna\n\nColumn by Rajan Khanna\n\nRajan Khanna is a fiction writer, blogger, reviewer and narrator.
