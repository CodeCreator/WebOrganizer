        "text":"5 Ways to Spark Your\u00a0Creativity\n\nBefore I jump into this post, I just wanted to thank you guys so much for 200 follows! It means so much to me and I appreciate you guys so much. Every like and comment still gets me really excited, and I love being able to connect with all of you who share the same interests as me. So again, thank you! \ud83d\ude42\n\nThere is a lot of writing I want to get done over the course of this year, however there is not a lot of motivation and creativity to support that. To help not only me, but any of you who are also feeling stuck. Here is a list I have compiled of 5 ways to get your creative juices flowing and I hope it helps!\n\n  1. Watch YouTube Videos On Writing \u2013 Watching writing vlogs or people talking about craft gets me extremely motivated to write. I did a post a few months back on some AuthorTubers (and a few BookTubers) I recommend so I will definitely leave that here for you to check out because you won\u2019t be disappointed. These authors\/youtubers are amazing and dedicated and soon you will find yourself also wanting to be amazing and dedicated.\n  2. Do A Different Type of Art \u2013 I really am not an artistic person but I do enjoy collaging and sometimes when I get stumped creatively, I will bring out my collage stuff and start collaging. It is nice to just let go and pour myself into something other than my words. Also, collaging isn\u2019t my passion so it is nice not putting ridiculous expectations on myself while doing it. Highly recommend picking up a hobby that doesn\u2019t have to do with writing because you will benefit so much from it mentally and creatively.\n  3. Listen to a Podcast \u2013 There are so many amazing podcasts on creativity, writing, and really everything you could ever want. Listening to the hosts bring in other creative people and interview them is so inspiring because they tell us how they too started at the bottom and rose to success. You can also learn a lot of valuable tips from podcasts apart from gaining back that creative spark.\n  4. Write Out Your Future Goals \u2013 These can be goals you plan to accomplish in the next year or the next five years, but the point is to just write some creative things you want to get done at some point in your life. Writing these down will create an image of the future in your mind and you will suddenly be hit with a load of motivation full force. You will suddenly want to start trying to accomplish these goals, and even though you will probably lose that energy and motivation eventually, keep looking back at your goals whenever you feel that motivation sinking away.\n  5. Take a Trip to the Library or Bookstore \u2013 Just being surrounded by books inspires me to write. I see all of the books that are published by others who just sat down and wrote the damn thing, and it makes me want to do just that. You can also get a book or two out of going to the bookstore which is another great way to get back into your creative groove!\n\nThose are 5 ways to spark your creativity and I hope you enjoyed! Don\u2019t forget to check out my last blog post: Audiobook TBR\n\nHappy writing \ud83d\ude42\n\nOther Places You Can Find Me:\n\n\nPinterest:\u00a0@zoermathers\n\n\n3 thoughts on \u201c5 Ways to Spark Your\u00a0Creativity\n\n  1. Hi,\n    I love your list of ideas. Have you ever listened to The Writers Panel? It\u2019s from the Nerdist network, and usually focuses on TV and film writing, but occasionally they have novelists on. Every time I listen to it, I\u2019m inspired.\n    Great post, thank you!\n\n    Liked by 1 person\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"Good SentencesI love good sentences. I really do.\n\nThe\u00a0best sentences are ones that show off brilliance without being show-offy. They pulse with the vitality of language and they aren\u2019t any longer than they need to be.\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find 43 good sentences. Solid sentences, sentences that you would be proud to bring home to Mom and Dad. Marriage-worthy sentences.\n\nUltimately, these sentences will repay your close attention. Under careful scrutiny, they will open up like flowers and reveal to you the wonders of the world.\n\nI\u2019ve spent years collecting the good sentences here in a file that I reserve for only my best sentences. I give them to you hoping that they will inspire to write more beautiful\u00a0sentences, inspire you to read more looking for these type of gems, and that they will make your life just a little bit more gorgeous.\n\nIf you want a few more sentences, check out my post of\u00a0100 Beautiful Sentences.\n\nI\u2019d also encourage you to start a file with good sentences, too. Ones that rock your soul and upend all your expectations about language and about the world. You\u2019ll never know when you might need inspiration.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like one or two\u00a0of these, wonderful. I would love to hear about why you don\u2019t like them in the comments.\n\nIf you love one or two of MOST\u00a0of these, I would love to hear which ones struck you to the core.\n\nBecause ultimately, like all art and things pertaining to beauty, \u201cgood\u201d is subjective. The only definition for good that I don\u2019t like is one that doesn\u2019t pay attention to language. Because for me, a good sentence isn\u2019t just about whether the language communicates a great idea; a good sentence has to showcase the infinite flexibility and brilliance of language itself.\n\nGood Sentences:\n\n1. \u201cHis body was all spring and torque, a bundle of fast-twitch muscles that exuded faint floral whiffs of ripe pear.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Ben Fountain\n\n2. \u201cAcross the chasm the first sunlight clipped the western echelon of ruined mountains and cones of the badlands volcanoes at the edge of the world, and they were gray and red and gold in the moment.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Ron Carlson\n\n3. \u201cI did not feel as if I were a person but simply a receiving station for a series of overwhelming transmissions.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Jeff Vandermeer\n\n4. \u201cKissing was good, but he tended to think of it as a beachhead from which to launch more serious operations, and a safe haven when, inevitably, he was forced to retreat.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Tobias Wolff\n\n5. \u201cPeople and their dwellings were such a thin dust on the surface of the globe, like invisible specks of bacteria on an orange, and the feeble lights of kebab shops and supermarkets failed utterly to register on the infinities of space above.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Michel Faber\n\n6. \u201cBut God is only a white cold eye, a quarter-moon poised above the smoke, blinking, blinking, as the city is gradually pounded to dust.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Anthony Doerr\n\n7. \u201cIt is said that unless you are born a god, your life, from its very beginning, is a mystery to you.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Jamaica Kincaid\n\n8. \u201cThe long evening had made its way into the barrack through the windows, creating mysteries everywhere, erasing the seam between one thing and another, lengthening out the floors and either thinning the air or putting some refinement on my ear enabling me to hear for the first time the clicking of a cheap clock from the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Flann O\u2019Brien\n\n9.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to fade away, I want to flame away \u2013 I want my death to be an attraction, a spectacle, a mystery.\u201d\n\n\u2013\u00a0Jennifer Egan\n\n10. \u201cI realised, of course, that other people used these roads; but that night, it seemed to me these dark byways of the country existed just for the likes of us, while the big glittering motorways with their huge signs and super cafes were for everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Kazuo Ishiguro\n\n11. \u201cHe seemed, like Albert Vetch, simultaneously haunted and oblivious, the kind of person who in one moment could guess, with breathtaking coldness, at the innermost sorrow in your heart, and in the next moment turn and, with a cheery wave of farewell, march blithely through a plate-glass window, requiring twenty-two stitches in his cheek.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Michael Chabon\n\n12. \u201cIt was hard to say what had depressed him more: the studied footwork of the couples on the dance floor, or the heartrending petty bourgeois piteousness of cucumber sandwiches passed around by accounting majors whose overly colorful bow ties had been expressly chosen to keep them from looking like waiters.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Nell Zink\n\n13. \u201cFridrik sat many a night by a smoking lamp, translating into Danish descriptions of the latest methods of keeping us poor humans alive, while on pallets around him lay the corpses, beyond any aid, despite the encouraging news of advances in electrical cures.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Sjon\n\n14. \u201cHis scarred, shaven face flattens against the mat.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Richard Beard\n\n15. \u201cWhatever I did I would do as I had done.\u201d\n\n\u2013 E.L. Doctorow\n\n16. \u201cThe fights between pupils were sometimes violent, the humiliations brutal and cruel, and Jed, being delicate and slight, would have been incapable of defending himself; but word spread that he was motherless, and such suffering, which none of them could claim to know, intimidated his schoolmates; thus there was around him a sort of halo of fearful respect.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Michel Houellebecq\n\n17. \u201cThere were patches of blackened snow on the red-tiled roof, and through the black teeth of its towering chimney rose a column of lignite smoke; wedged between the triangle of the roof and the rectangle of the chimney was a bright blue sky.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Orhan Pamuk\n\n18. \u201cObjects, their outlines beginning to harden in the growing light, had a shadowy, totemic menace.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Paula Fox\n\n19. \u201cWhen Jun Do had cordoned off the pounding in his eyes, and the hot blood in his nose, when he\u2019d stopped the split in his lips and the sting in his ears from coming inside, when he\u2019d blocked his arms and torso and shoulders from feeling, when that was all blocked off, there was only the inside of him, and what he discovered was a little boy in there who was stupidly smiling, who had no idea what was happening to the man outside.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Adam Johnson\n\n20. \u201cA single note, held in an amber suspension of time, like a charcoal drawing of Icarus falling.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Karen Russell\n\n21. \u201cNothing is random, nor will anything ever be, whether a long string of perfectly blue days that begin and end in golden dimness, the most seemingly chaotic political acts, the rise of a great city, the crystalline structure of a gem that has never seen the light, the distributions of fortune, what time the milkman gets up, or the position of the electron.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Mark Helprin\n\n22. \u201cWhat is astonishing is that we, who had no idea how anything was going to turn out, now know exactly what happened.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Philip Roth\n\n23. \u201cThe building\u2019s rusted fire escape would just come down, just come loose from its moorings and crash onto the street, if anyone stepped on it \u2013 a fire escape whose function was not to save lives in the event of a fire but to uselessly hang there testifying to the immense loneliness inherent to living.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Philip Roth\n\n24. \u201cBut it is just two lovers, holding hands and in a hurry to reach their car, their locked hands a starfish leaping through the dark.\u201d\n\n\u2013 John Updike\n\n25. \u201cThe jeep would round the bend, be hit by a dozen bullets at once, and that would be the end of his petty history of unfocused groping and unimportant dissatisfactions.\u201d\n\n\u2013\u00a0Normal Mailer\n\n26. \u201cIt was so quiet, a reservation kind of quiet, where you can hear somebody drinking whiskey on the rocks three miles away.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Sherman Alexie\n\n27. \u201cHow right that the body changed over time, becoming a gallery of scars, a canvas of experience, a testament to life and one\u2019s capacity to endure it.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Janet Fitch\n\n28. \u201cWe are all waiting for the luminous hands that will reach for us in the night, the eyes that will witness our pain, the voice that will whisper the possibility of a different truth.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Gina Nahai\n\n29. \u201cI am twelve years old, standing beneath a starfruit tree, standing on an asphalt path lined with banyan trees, their roots extending from ground to sky to ground again and forming great pockets of wild, empty space in the center of their root-branches.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Kyle Minor\n\n30. \u201cThe compasses are disappointingly true, pointing north over and over, when all he wants is for one to dissent, to demur, to show him the new direction he cannot find on his own.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Matt Bell\n\n31. \u201cHe thought of his eyes on alcohol, gray coals in a brick-like face, a vicious mouth that lifted flesh from bone like a man field-dressed a deer.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Shann Ray\n\n32. \u201cWeston, alone and in their father\u2019s car, sped from the edge of that highway in darkness and blew out the metal guardrail and warped the steel so it reached after the car like a strange hand through which the known world passes, the heavy dark Chevelle like a shot star, headlights that put beams in the night until the chassis turned and the car became an untethered creature that fell and broke itself on the valley floor.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Shann Ray\n\n33. \u201cThe sun glints through the pines and the heart is pierced in a moment of beauty and strange pain, like a memory of paradise.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Peter Matthiessen\n\n34. \u201cAs someone whose days were defined by the ten thousand ways a human can hurt, she needed, now and then, to remember that the nervous system didn\u2019t exist exclusively to feel pain.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Anthony Marra\n\n35. \u201cThere is no beyond, there is only here, the infinitely small, infinitely great and utterly demanding present.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Iris Murdoch\n\n36. \u201cOh, dear God, you don\u2019t actually have a brain, do you, it\u2019s more a filigreed spiderweb, with little chambers in it where trained monkeys play the pipe organ.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Glen David Gold\n\n37. \u201cI knew every raindrop by its name.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Denis Johnson\n\n38. \u201cAnd by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Carson McCullers\n\n39. \u201cThe wind was picking up off the ocean now and the whole coastal scene had a bleak, abandoned look, as though Maine in November really belonged to the ragg...

Ballard (Norton\/Liveright) - Completed just before he died in 2009 at age 79, this compelling memoir by SF novelist Ballard vividly portrays the vanished world of the British upper classes in Shanghai and Cambridge before and after WWII.\n\nA Natural History of Dragons by Marie Brennan (Tor) \u2013 Complete with gorgeous illustrations, this novel takes the form of protagonist Isabella\u2019s memoir of her youthful adventures, in a world where fantastical creatures roam. A rich and absorbing tale of discovery. Check out Brennan\u2019s exploration of the novel\u2019s dragons.\n\nCity of a Thousand Dolls by Miriam Forster (HarperTeen) - Forster makes a strong debut with a fresh South Asian\u2013inspired fantasy\/mystery crossover.

There, orphaned or unwanted girls are raised in six specialized houses, and when they start to go missing, Nisha tries to get to the bottom of it.\n\nSchroder by Amity Gaige (Hachette\/Twelve) - Written as an apology (in both the Socratic and emotional sense) to the narrator\u2019s ex-wife as he awaits trial for taking his six-year-old daughter on an unsanctioned road trip, this novel is quiet and deeply introspective.\n\nOut of the Black Land by Kerry Greenwood (Poisoned Pen) \u2013 In this gripping thriller set in ancient Egypt, the new pharaoh, Akhnaten, holds the heretical religious view that there\u2019s only one god, and acts to spread this idea by banning the worship of the traditional deities. Two charismatic figures\u2014Ptah-hotep, plucked from obscurity to become the Great Royal Scribe and Mutnodjme, Akhnaten\u2019s sister-in-law\u2014display a gift for surviving palace intrigue.\n\nHouse of Earth by Woody Guthrie (Harper) - Guthrie\u2019s multifaceted legacy lives on (and combines beautifully with his affecting 1930 autobiography Bound for Glory) with this posthumous Texas plains novel set during the Dust Bowl era. Includes a preface by Johnny Depp, who polished the rough manuscript.\n\nThe Lady and Her Monsters: A Tale of Dissections, Real-Life Dr. Frankensteins, and the Creation of Mary Shelley\u2019s Masterpiece by Roseanne Montillo (Morrow) - A macabre romp through 18th and 19th century Europe, Montillo\u2019s debut illuminates the circumstances and inspiration behind one of gothic literature\u2019s most notorious tales.

Nirenberg contends that anti-Judaism is \u201cone of the basic tools with which [Western thought] was constructed.\u201d\n\nAngles of Ascent: A Norton Anthology of Contemporary African American Poetry edited by Charles Henry Rowell (Norton) - This important if sprawling collection might be the first to give such a full and various account of its subject: African-American poets since the 1960s, and especially since the 1980s, in much of their ambitiously pluralist, confident, and energetic variety.\n\nMy Brother\u2019s Book by Maurice Sendak (HarperCollins\/di Capua) \u2013 In Sendak\u2019s final work, a series of small, jewel-like watercolors shows two brothers, lithe as acrobats, floating through a desolate world of murky forests and starry skies.

This mass-market fare routinely packs theaters with testosterone-addled adolescents, but foolish people making irrational decisions in ridiculous situations do not play well in thriller fiction: aficionados expect a lot more. And while unique spins on familiar themes\u2014highlighting the latest technologies and exotic locales\u2014still capture readers\u2019 attentions, characterization is king. Here we have five innovative page-turners, each with protagonists that render them damnably difficult to put down.\n\nFalling Glass Cover In Adrian McKinty\u2019s Falling Glass (Serpent\u2019s Tail, 978-1-84668-783-9), a retired fixer, Killian, is pulled back into \u201cthe life\u201d after he botches a real-estate investment. More than a common leg-breaker, he is highly educated, intelligent, and makes seemingly smart decisions that nevertheless go spectacularly awry. After he signs on to find an airline magnate\u2019s ex-wife and daughters, he finds himself embroiled in intrigue much grander and more dangerous than he imagined.\n\nMcKinty\u2019s last novel, Fifty Grand, won the 2010 Spinetingler Award, so it\u2019s no surprise that his newest offering carries on in that stellar tradition. The author\u2019s wit and lyrical style lend a noir ambiance to this modern story, as if he were channeling the ghost of Mickey Spillane. In many novels of this ilk, were readers to ignore the names and simply scan the dialogue, it would be difficult to tell one character from the other. Not so here. While the plot points are prosaic, driving the story are characters so real you expect them to walk off the page and smack you upside the head. Genuine emotional connections for the reader\u2019s taking make for a memorable, hard-hitting tale.\n\nTo Wander the Labyrinth Cover Brian Peters\u2019s To Wander the Labyrinth (AASP Press, 978-0-9838572-0-4) packs a poignant punch as well. It spotlights Clay, the man who wrote the Agency\u2019s interrogation manual and spent his career carrying it out. He was very good at his job and convinced himself that torturing suspected terrorists was his patriotic duty, yet the price for his actions includes a failed marriage, estranged son, and feeble mental health. Barely functioning without a potent drug cocktail, Clay is haunted by institutional smells and the sounds of his victims. Only when the Agency turns against him, sparking a race to uncover the mystery of what is truly going on, does he get a chance to regain a small piece of his humanity.\n\nThe antihero on a quest for redemption is not an easy theme to tackle in a first novel, yet Peters manages it in style. His brilliantly edited, minimalist approach shows the value of sticking to one viewpoint and trusting the reader\u2019s intellect to figure things out. Extraordinary pacing pulls us into the story, while gritty realism keeps us there. All in all, it\u2019s an unforgettable saga with an unexpectedly satisfying (albeit dark) ending.\n\nCompany Orders Cover Company Orders (Allium Press, 978-0-9831938-5-2) by David J. Walker is another powerful, character-driven tale that overcomes a been there\/done that\/got the t-shirt plot. Paul Clark, now a Catholic priest, unknowingly fathered an illegitimate child as a young man prior to joining the military. Years after his ordination he is contacted by the boy\u2019s grandmother, who tells him that his former girlfriend has passed on and that their son is being held in a Mexican prison on drug charges. Desperate to save the child he\u2019s never known, Father Paul makes a deal with a mysterious woman who claims to represent an agency of the federal government.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the arrangement doesn\u2019t end well, leading to a globe-spanning adventure that tests his fortitude, faith, and integrity.\n\nEvery character is magnificently realized, yet Father Paul, whose soul-searching struggle is tinged with subtle humor throughout, is unforgettable. An Edgar Award-nominated author of a dozen novels, Walker has worked as a parish priest, police investigator, and attorney, eclectic experience that helps inject realism into his prose.\n\nCooper\u2019s Promise Cover While remarkable characters can certainly drive memorable tales, the setting oftentimes enhances their plights. Cooper\u2019s Promise (Owl Canyon Press, 978-0-9834764-3-6), by Timothy Jay Smith, takes place in the fictitious African country of Lalanga, yet the horrific conditions he describes are all too real. Illicit diamonds, slavery, corruption, and human trafficking are the backdrop for the tale of Sergeant Cooper Chance, a former US Army sharpshooter turned renegade after a failed affair with his male CO, Rick. Struggling with his sexuality, Cooper meets a handsome diamond merchant, Sadiq, and falls in love, only to become entangled in political intrigue when massive oil reserves are discovered in the country and the military strongman falls out of favor with the US government. Offered the possibility of forgiveness for deserting the army, Cooper must decide if the consequences of pulling the trigger once more are worth a chance to go home again.\n\nSmith\u2019s first play won the prestigious Stanley Drama Award. Cooper\u2019s Promise continues to showcase his skills with stellar characterization, meaningful drama, and powerful messages. Original plot? Hardly. Brilliant insight into the human condition that resonates page after page? Categorically, yes.\n\nHook and Shoot Cover Those first four books thrill readers while examining weighty issues, but Hook and Shoot (Medallion Press, 978-1-60542-521-4), by Jeremy Brown, is just plain fun. Aaron \u201cWoodshed\u201d Wallace is a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter with a sordid past who is caught up in a Japanese mob\u2019s attempt to take over the MMA promotion company he works for. Together with Burch, an enigmatic ex-SAS bodyguard who tricks him into helping, he must find a way to take on the yakuza and prevail. Sure, a gazillion B-movies share the same plot, yet Brown\u2019s irreverent style marks a fresh approach. Solid characters, extraordinary dialogue, realistic action, and phenomenal pacing elevate his book far beyond the ordinary fare. Take this exchange between Burch and Wallace: \u201c\u2018You ever fought in an elevator before? It\u2019s more fun than it sounds.\u2019 Burch split time watching me and the elevator doors on the way down. \u2018I was just teasing,\u2019 I said. \u2018Next time I hit you I\u2019m not gonna warn you first. So relax.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown trained in Jeet Kune Do, MMA, and close-quarters combat, and became an author when he realized that it hurts less to write about such things. His experience lends a refreshing air of realism to warrior personae, honor codes, and fight scenes.\n\nA martial arts instructor with twenty-six years of security experience, Lawrence Kane has written nine books and numerous articles on self-defense and related topics, and consults with other authors to ensure realism in their novels.\n\nLawrence Kane\n\nComment on this foresight",

        "text":"Campus Cravings Spotlight! 1\n\n\u00a0Welcome to Cathia University, where school is in session! Nine of today\u2019s hottest gay romance authors have crafted brand-new interrelated novellas celebrating everything wonderful about college, including sophisticated professors, sexy teaching assistants, ambitious grad students, and spirited undergraduates, all looking for the same thing: an A+ in true love. Annabeth Albert: Winning Bracket\n\nMetrics and tournament brackets\u2014who knew they were sexy? When competing dorm advisors Edwin and Ollie bet on a basketball tournament, neither expects he\u2019s risking his heart. As the challenge becomes a hot bedroom battle to avoid real feelings, the two \u201cfrenemies\u201d must change their definitions of losing to win a shot at lasting love.\n\nCassandra Carr: The Eloquent Jock\n\nHockey jock and English Lit major Brendan knows he\u2019s gay, but hasn\u2019t come out to anyone, fearing a possible backlash. Then he\u2019s tapped to be a TA for a hot professor and feels an immediate connection. Now he must decide how much he\u2019s willing to risk to score the ultimate goal.\n\nDalton Diaz: Lesson Learned\n\nAdam Warren is counting down the days until he can put \u201cProfessor\u201d next to his name\u2014and his disastrous past with Tyler Ford behind him. When a fluke puts Tyler in Adam\u2019s class, the graduate assistant faces some hard choices while Tyler faces an uphill battle for a second chance at first love.\n\nMia Downing: Switching Leads\n\nCoach John Graham needs a new assistant for Cathia U\u2019s equestrian team. The last person he expects to get the job walks into the barn and stops his heart. How is he supposed to focus on the team when his ex-lover\u2014sexy horse trainer Finn Parker\u2014wants back into his life\u2026and into his bed?\n\nWhitley Gray: Artistic Endeavor\n\nWhen friends ask one-night stand connoisseur Michael Esteban to introduce shy virgin Cobey Miller to the joys of sex, Michael balks\u2014lust is his thing, not teaching. But Cobey\u2019s problem meeting men fuels Michael\u2019s decision to help Cobey become a gay-sex-loving guy. It\u2019ll all be fun and games\u2014unless someone falls in love.\n\nBianca Sommerland: Solid Education\n\nGage Tackett comes off as a bad boy\u2014detached and maybe a little dangerous. Definitely not Vet Sciences Professor Derek Paulson\u2019s type. When Gage arrives at Derek\u2019s veterinary clinic with a frostbitten stray dog, Derek realizes his most difficult student has a few things to teach him. Things he\u2019s more than willing to learn.\n\nKyAnn Waters: Private Lessons\n\nRyan Kane could lose his scholarship and his position on the pitch. Jake Finely offers to help. Only Ryan and Jake discover their private lessons have more to do with sex ed than Business Ethics. When a tenured professor offers Ryan an indecent proposal to make the grade, will he choose soccer or Jake?\n\nLA Witt: Did Somebody Order a Pizza?\n\nPaul Switzer has been miserable ever since his childhood love, Cory Bowman, chose a fraternity over him. When a pizza delivery to the frat house lands the exes face to face for the first time in eighteen months, the wound is reopened\u2026 and so are Paul\u2019s feelings for the only man he\u2019s ever loved.\n\nSara York: The Dust Of Everyday Life\n\nCole only has the courage to lust after the swim team from afar. When Seever asks to share a table at the packed coffee house where Cole is studying, he\u2019s sure it\u2019s a joke. But after one touch and one scorching kiss, Cole thinks the chance meet could lead to something with substance.\nPrivate Lessons by KyAnn Waters \u2013 4 stars\nI don\u2019t recall the last time I was so frustrated for a character as I was for Ryan. To be failing a class not because you don\u2019t understand the material, not because you aren\u2019t doing the work, and not because you\u2019re not doing everything you\u2019re supposed to, but rather because your professor is a prick on a power trip with a bias against athletes. Thankfully his TA, Jake, was willing to tutor Ryan to see if he could help Ryan improve his grade. Now for the dilemma, Jake is out and Ryan is so far in the closet no one suspects he\u2019s gay \u2013 although Jake does hope. I have to say I found Ryan\u2019s reason for being in the\ncloset one I haven\u2019t encountered before. While he had the expected worries about how others would react, it had more to do with not making his teammates uncomfortable in the locker room. I got the impression that Ryan knew he wanted to be a professional soccer player long before he knew he was gay, so the drive to protect the team dynamic actually made sense to me. I was disgusted by the professor\u2019s stunt and hated that Ryan had to deal with it. I was devastated when we learned that Jake had overheard part of the conversation. Fortunately Ryan made Jake listen to him and was able to explain what happened and remedy the situation. This was an enjoyable read and I look forward to checking out more of Ms. Water\u2019s work.\nThe Dust of Everyday Life by Sara York \u2013 4 stars\nI really enjoyed watching the blossoming of a relationship between Cole and Seever. Cole was absolutely too cute in his reaction to Seever\u2019s interest in him. He describes himself as a skinny nerd and goes so far as to ask Seever if he actually got a good look at him when Seever calls him sexy \u2026 I literally laughed out loud. Seever is a sweetheart who is Cole\u2019s fantasy come to life \u2013 hot, sweet, and a swimmer. They both had a great group of friends who served as an enjoyable support system, especially when dealing with what Julia did to them. The Dust of Everyday Life was a great story, but I expected it to be as I\u2019ve enjoyed everything of Ms. York\u2019s that I\u2019ve read.\nEloquent Jock by Cassandra Carr \u2013 5 stars\nTalk about hot for teacher! I much prefer the student-teacher dynamic in this story to that of Private Lessons. I loved both Scott and Brendan\u2019s characters and couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for the situation the found themselves in \u2013 trying to balance professional demands with burgeoning feelings of love. What really pushed this story to a 5-star read for me was Tyler, Brendan\u2019s best friend, roommate, and team captain. I loved how supportive he was of Brendan. The only thing missing for me was that I would like to have an update on Scott\u2019s book during the Epilogue. Great story.\nSwitching Leads by Mia Downing \u2013 5 stars\nI quite enjoyed this second chance romance between John, the equestrian coach, and Finn, his ex-boyfriend and newly hired assistant coach. After learning why their relationship dissolved a decade earlier, it was nice to see John open up to Finn and give Finn a chance to prove that he had indeed changed. The transformation that John undergoes from angry and bitter to happy and hopeful is refreshing. That the two are well-matched and sexy as sin just makes the read that much more enjoyable. This is one novella I would have really liked to read as a full-length book so that I could have spent more time with John and Finn.\nSolid Education by Bianca Sommerland \u2013 5 stars\nAs a fan of Ms. Sommerland\u2019s I was not surprised that I loved this novella. While I don\u2019t typically enjoy books in which a dog is the primary catalyst for a relationship or a main character (which is odd as I am a huge dog lover with two of my own), Gage\u2019s military background and Derek\u2019s career as a vet made\nMatty the perfect way for these two to find common ground. I must say that for a vet and adjunct college professor, Derek was a bit thick in accepting Gage\u2019s feelings for him \u2013 there are actions that Gage took early in the book that clearly illustrated his interest in the man. Their chemistry together was intense and the library scene was HOT! I absolutely loved the way in which the story ended. It was perfect.\u00a0\nDid Somebody Order a Pizza? by L.A. Witt \u2013 4 stars\nThis is by far my least favorite of the stories so far. It has nothing to do with the author\u2019s style of writing because the story flows well and I enjoyed the writing. It\u2019s the subject matter of hazing that made it less enjoyable for me. The fear and humiliation that pledges are subjected to by SOME fraternities is despicable and Ms. Witt has done an excellent job in creating a story centered around this reprehensible activity. That said, I really liked Paul and that he stood up for himself several times as Cory tried to reconcile with him. His refusal to back down from his firm disavowal of the Delta Sig fraternity was impressive, especially when it cost him the reconciliation with Cory. I was relieved that\nCory did the right thing \u2026 eventually. Well done Ms. Witt.\nWinning Bracket by Annabeth Albert \u2013 4 stars\nSuper cute story. I adore Edwin. I can\u2019t remember which of the previous stories mentioned him and relegated him to the position of the dorm\u2019s noise police, so it was \u201cnice\u201d to get to meet him and read his story. Of course, Ollie is just as \u201ccute\u201d as can be. Watching the two of them together was certainly\nentertaining as they learned to navigate their feelings for one another. And once you read this story, you\u2019ll understand the significance on the quoted words in my review.\nArtistic Endeavor by Whitley Gray \u2013 5 stars\nI freaking loved Artistic Endeavor. I absolutely adore Cobey. I cannot even imagine what it must have been like to grow up gay in a fanatical religious family and have to hide who he was until he finished college. Cobey had an amazing attitude of acceptance for himself. I\u2019ve known a couple of homosexual men who were raised Catholic and both grappled with the guilt their religious upbringing instilled about their homosexuality. As for Michael. Wow! Everyone deserves a first lover as patient and understanding as Michael. The chemistry between the two was electric and only intensified as they spent more time with one another. Another story with a beautiful ending.\nLesson Learned by Dalton Diaz \u2013 5 stars\nLesson Learned is another great second-chance romance in the Campus Cravings collection. The flashbacks both Adam and Tyler have give you all the information needed to understand why both men are so raw in their reactions toward the other. Getting to watch them fall in love all over again,... (truncated)",

        "text":"Wednesday, November 5, 2014\n\n5 Reasons to Finish Every Book You Start\n\n1. You\u2019re an idiot. You know nothing about books. You\u2019ve only read comic books or Sweet Valley High up until now. You may think you don\u2019t like real books, like Les Miserables, but if forced to finish one, you\u2019ll realize the true value of literature! You\u2019re not in a position to evaluate the worth of books yet; just finish them and ask questions later.\n\n2. The main reason to read novels is for the plot. You may think you don\u2019t like a book, but there could be a killer plot twist at the end that makes you see the value of the beginning of the novel in retrospect. Also you might miss something incredible. Don\u2019t worry about the incredible stuff you might miss in books you haven\u2019t started. If you haven\u2019t started the book, it doesn\u2019t count.\n\n3. All books have inherent value. Don\u2019t worry about the supposedly better books you could be reading instead (grass is always greener!); whatever book you have recently, arbitrarily started is, in the end, just as good as any other book.\n\n4. Finishing novels teaches strength. You\u2019ll prove to yourself that you can do it. If you don\u2019t finish every novel you start, you have probably never finished a book and are probably also the type to eat all the marshmallows.\n\n5. Whoever wrote the book finished it. It upsets the sense of symmetry in the universe if the writer finished it and the reader does not.\n\n(Inspired by \"Finish That Book!\" in The Atlantic.)\n\n\n  1. 10 reasons not to feel compelled to finish every book you start:\n\n    1. The Scarlet Letter\n    (I was one of the fortunate few who were not required to read this in school. Years later when I attempted it on my own, I got about halfway through and couldn't go on. I felt like I'd been condemned to clear acres of swampland.)\n\n    2. Tender is the Night.\n    (As I type this, at this very moment, Garrison Keillor quotes something from The Great Gatsby.)\n\n    3. Sometimes a novel might have a good (or at least entertaining) plot, but the writing goes down like greasy fast food. (I've found this to be the case with a lot of science fiction and mystery novels. There are exceptions -- for instance, I've liked most of what I've read by Dashiell Hammett, the plots and the writing.)\n\n    4. I renounced idiocy when I reached the age of critical thought (which in my case began probably around age 14). By \"age of critical thought\" I mean that point in one's life when one begins to have opinions that are not entirely derived from one's parents or the other adults who have loomed large in life up to that point.\n\n    5. The Catcher in the Rye. (I did eventually read this all the way through, just a few years ago, though I made several failed starts at it over the years before I finally pushed myself to get through the whole book.)\n\n    6. Some books work better as summaries contained in a book review than they do as books that one actually reads. An acquaintance once commented that many of the books that are reviewed in The Nation magazine are books that one probably wouldn't want to read, even though the book reviews might be interesting.\n\n    7. I once started reading Diane DiPrima's book Memoirs of a Beatnik, but lost interest a few pages into it when I realized that it was one of the books that various of the \"Beat\" writers wrote as porn (in varying degrees of hard\/soft) as a way of making a little rent money back in the 1950's and 1960's. A lot of the Beat porn books were published originally in France by a publisher there the name of which I'm not remembering offhand.\n\n    8. On the Road by Jack Kerouac.\n    I've tried several times over the years and haven't been able to get past page 1 or 2.\n\n    9. Grace Slick's autobiography.\n\n    10. I've only mentioned novels and one non-fiction book here. Talking about the poetry books I've started reading and haven't finished would open several (at least) cans of worms that I'll hold off opening at the moment. I've read relatively few novels compared with the number of books of poems I've read over the years.\n\n    By contrast, a few of the prose books (novels and otherwise) that I have finished and liked: Pere Goriot by Balzac; Germinal by Emile Zola; How the Steel Was Tempered by Nikolai Ostrovsky; Barricades in Berlin by Klaus Neukranz; From A to X, a novel by John Berger (and several of Berger's books of art criticism); The Moon and the Virgin by Nor Hall; Savage Coast by Muriel Rukeyser; Uncle Tom's Children by Richard Wright; Life's Good, Brother by Nazim Hikmet; What Is Found There: Notebooks on Poetry and Politicsby Adrienne Rich; several novels and short story collections by Dashiell Hammett; etc.\n\n    The two most recent books I've finished are Petrified Time by Yannis Ritsos (translated by Martin McKinsey and Scott King), and (truth) The Self Unstable by yourself, Ms. Gabbert.\n\n    1. I hope people got that this was satire. I only finish a small fraction of the books I start.\n\n    2. I'm surprised about Catcher in the Rye! I read it in junior high in, I think, one day -- couldn't put it down.\n\n    3. I endorse Samuel Johnson's cursory way of reading. (I'm thinking of when he told Boswell that he \"looked into\" books but didn't read them all the way through.) The moment you realize a book isn't worth reading, chuck it down the laundry chute.\n\n      About Beat porn: the French publisher was Maurice Girodias of the Olympia Press. I have an old paperback anthology called The Olympia Reader. Very good porn in that.\n\n    4. Tyler Cowen does this too -- starts a ton of books and doesn't finish most of them. he also throws bad books away.\n\n    5. @Elisa: yeah I did get that your post was satire, or something in that general neighborhood. It looked like fun and I jumped in. :)\n\n      And yeah, Catcher in the Rye, go figure. You know, Whit Stillman's films (especially Metropolitan) seem to me to wander in some of the same territory that Salinger's writing does, though I've mostly liked Stillman's films. * Some of it (re Catcher) may have been exaggerated expectations on my part. I first tried reading it when I was around 14 or 15 (ca. 1969-1970), and it was supposed to be this shocking controversial book that was always getting banned from school libraries and classrooms, etc., and when I first tried reading it, it was like, What's the big deal?\n\n      On the other hand, two or three years later when I discovered Kurt Vonnegut's books, I really liked them. I've finished every one of them that I've started. Recently reread Slaughterhouse-Five and still really liked it.\n\n      @Delia Psyche: Yes, Olympia Press, thank you. I may have run across the Olympia Reader some years back, though didn't buy or read it. Maybe someday I'll seek it out once I've fallowed into my Bukowski phase of life.\n\n    6. Yeah, why *was* it banned? Just because it had the word \"fuck\" in it? ?",

So, am feeling quite literary.\n\nBut how can you possibly put the Ayn Rand into the toilet paper category? 'Atlas Shrugged' is a brilliant book - I intend to re-read it for about the 3rd time on my flight to the States next month. You don't have to believe all of her philosophy to appreciate the book; there's a lot that I don't like about how she thinks, but it's a great read and always inspires me to try harder at everything I do.\n\nMelinda June said...\n\nI think it's a cultural thing, Ruth. In the US, conservatives with liberal arts educations use Randian thought as justification for everything from no public health care to abolishing all social security and welfare so they can have tax cuts on their multi-million dollar inheritances. Bleeding hearts like me are really tired of hearing it, and any appreciation for the work is overshadowed by annoyance with the politics.",

        "text":"November 3rd, 2012 \/ 5:51 pm\nBehind the Scenes\n\n10 Books\n\na.k.a. \u201cPlaying catch up with the stacks [4].\u201d\n\nIn this series, I share with you a stack of my recently acquired and most anticipated reading materials.\n\nI did a version of this in August, and\u00a0March,\u00a0and also back in\u00a0May\u00a0of 2011.\n\nOnce again I have a heaping pile of awesome-looking unread materials just waiting to be experienced\u2026\n\nD.V. by Diana Vreeland\n\nFrom 1963-1971, Vreeland was editor-in-chief of Vogue until she got fired and replaced by Grace Mirabella (1971-1988). I\u2019m excited as hell to read this book. Though I don\u2019t talk too much about it these days, there was a moment in my life when I almost went to fashion design school instead of creative writing school. I\u2019ve always adored fashion, followed fashion, and have been a subscriber to Vogue for years \u2014 although, truth be told, I\u2019ve recently switched my allegiance to W Magazine. Anyway, Vreeland\u2019s book opens with her punching some dude in the face for calling her nostalgic, and then quickly jumps to this time when she helped Jack Nicholson fix his back problems. In addition to the fashion aspect, I am also super interested in gossip. So this book is going to rock.\n\nHollywood Babylon: The Legendary Underground Classic of Hollywood\u2019s Darkest and Best Kept Secrets by Kenneth Anger\n\nSpeaking of gossip, this book also looks awesome. I\u2019m so glad I finally got a copy of it. Chock full of pictures and golden era Hollywood lore (it bills itself as \u201ca collection of Hollywood\u2019s darkest and best kept secrets\u201d), written by the\u00a0enigmatically\u00a0cool experimental filmmaker Kenneth Anger, I can\u2019t imagine how this isn\u2019t going to rock.\n\nPromising Young Women by Suzanne Scanlon\n\nA few nights ago, I read the first thirty pages in the bathtub and was totally mesmerized. Don\u2019t want to say too much about my impressions and ideas,\u00a0because\u00a0I plan to write more extensively about it. \u00a0Instead, I\u2019ll just share with you what\u00a0Eileen Myles has to say:\u00a0\u201cAbout ten lives occur in this very short novel. One swiftly becomes the background of the next, then that one looms up fast and for a moment you think oh this is the life. And it is ending. I like the swift consciousness with which Suzanne Scanlon orchestrates all of it and even more I admire the true (and maneuvered) intimacy that holds me here on the page despite the fact that inside and out of this volume of PROMISING YOUNG WOMEN there are so many of us, lives, and women and female writers. You wonder if we matter at all and Suzanne Scanlon says in a multitude of quietly intelligent and felt ways that we do, helplessly, all of us do, no matter.\u201d\n\nFra Keeler by Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi\n\nThis book is a complete mystery to me. \u00a0All I know about the author is that she snagged the recent tenure track CW job at Notre Dame, which is impressive enough to make me pay attention. \u00a0From the blurbs and the acknowledgments page, it would appear she went to Brown, which is another feather I tend to notice in a writer\u2019s hat. \u00a0Also of note is the fact \u00a0that the book\u2019s published by Danielle Dutton\u2019s Dorothy, a publishing project\u00a0\u2014 as is Scanlon\u2019s book.\n\n\nA Question Mark Above the Sun: Documents on the Mystery Surrounding a Famous Poem \u201cBy\u201d Frank O\u2019Hara By Kent Johnson\n\nKent Johnson is a provocateur of the highest order. \u00a0I could say a bunch about this book, and hopefully I will do so shortly, \u00a0but for now I\u2019ll share this line as a selling point from\u00a0The Times Literary Supplement,\u00a0\u201cAt the end of last year, an extraordinary work of detective criticism briefly appeared, despite legal threats.\u201d\n\nUncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age by Kenneth Goldsmith\n\nPicked this up at the Modernist Studies Association conference last month. Kept meaning to get it and kept putting it off. But there it was, and there I was, so we united.\n\nThe Runaway Note by Tyrone Jaeger\n\nI know Tyrone from back in my Nebraska grad school days, circa 2003-2005. \u00a0And now he\u2019s got a book in the world and I\u2019m pleased for it. Soon I\u2019ll be posting an interview with him about it. Stay tuned.\n\nNormally Special by xTx\n\nAfter recently writing about my belated but ardent enchantment with the work of xTx, she sent me a copy of this book and I am stoked to read it. Just flipping through, I get the sense that it\u2019s going to be rad. Blurbing the book, Blake Butler said, \u201cAfter reading Normally Special, if I knew xTx\u2019s legal name, I\u2019d file a restraining order. Maybe she\u2019s Aileen Wuornos. Maybe she\u2019s a wiccan living under A.M. Homes\u2019s bed. I don\u2019t know, she freaks me the hell out.\u201d\n\nMoving Parts by Magdalena Tulli\n\nWill be teaching this book in the spring, in a course on Global Perspectives on the Contemporary Novel. W.S. Merwin claims, \u201cThe originality of Tulli\u2019s writing is not lessened by representing a family tree that includes Michaud, Kafka, Calvino, and Saramago.\u201d And Amazon reviewer Bethany L. Canfield says, \u201cMoving Parts is an incredible, truly insightful novel in which the narrator looses control of his story. What? Yes! He becomes a character and cannot get out of the view of the reader. This is not a book to breeze though, it is jam packed full of brilliant quotes and stunning writing. The concept of this novel, and the storyline are completely unlike anything that I have read before.\u201d\n\nReborn: Journals and Notebooks, 1947-1963 by Susan Sontag\n\nSontag is one of my all-time favorites, and although it\u2019s taken me a while to get around to picking up her diary, it\u2019s not for lack of interest. I had thought about waiting until all three volumes become available so I could read them all at once, like how I prefer to watch an entire season of a television show all at once after the season ends rather than watching each weekly episode and waiting for the next while it\u2019s airing. \u00a0But I\u2019ve gotten too antsy. \u00a0The second volume hasn\u2019t even come out in paperback yet, so the third volume might take forever to be issued. \u00a0The time is now.",

The Arabic and French he added later in order to stay ahead of Arabic and French-speaking business partners.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Caden leads a life that tends to expose him to violence on a regular basis.\n\nContrariwise, he hates handguns and he\u2019s only an okay marksman with them.\u00a0 He\u2019s lethal, however, once he puts the handgun down. He often needs to cross international borders, both legally and illegally, so being able to take his weapons with him (his body, that is) gives him an advantage.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, with long range\u00a0 weapons, such as sniper rifles, he has a world-class reputation.\n\nThere are weapons and distances and shots that only the truly gifted marksman can make\u2026.Caden Rawn is one of them, and among the elite marksmen around the world, his name is well known.\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Caden likes to read, and educates himself on an eclectic and broad range of subjects on a continuing basis.\n\nThis is a result of his bizarre upbringing and even more odd childhood education,where he received a classical grounding in eastern philosophies and languages, poetry and literature and history.\u00a0 He\u2019s spent his adult years filling in the holes.\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Caden has always worked alone.\n\nHe has never worked alongside anyone, or invited anyone to share his business dealings.\n\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Caden has never been romantically linked with anyone.\n\nThere have been casual dalliances, and alliances around the world, but he has never come close to being attached to anyone.\n\n\nTerror Stash by Tracy Cooper-Posey\n\nTerror Stash\n\n\nTerror Stash is a (very) long romantic thriller set in Western Australia.\u00a0 It is part of the Romantic Thrillers collection.\u00a0 Click here to find out more about the book, including an excerpt.",

        "text":"Audio Book Downloads Blog\n\nThe blog for audio book lovers\n\nPosts Tagged \u2018download audiobooks\n\n5 Benefits of Listening to Audio\u00a0Books\n\nleave a comment \u00bb\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already discovered the joy of listening to audio books, this post will hopefully convince you to give them a try. There are many benefits to listening to audio books, the following are my top 5:\n\n1. Audio books can be listened to anytime and anyplace, e.g.\u00a0traveling, commuting, exercising, shopping, working in the garden, or even dusting and vacuuming the house.\n\n2. Audio books may\u00a0improve your retention and comprehension of the material, especially if you are an auditory learner or if you are easily distracted by noises (headphones can help block out other noise and help you focus on the material).\n\n3. Listening to an audio book can be more entertaining and exciting than reading a paperback book.\u00a0\u00a0I enjoy when a narrator changes his or her inflections for the characters and doesn\u2019t just read but acts!\n\n4. For those of you who look at the computer monitor and documents for hours, listening to an audio book is more relaxing to your strained eyes after work.\n\n5. Downloading audio books is quick and easy. And coupons (e.g. Audible coupons) or\u00a0membership plans (e.g.\u00a0Audible Gold Membership)\u00a0make audio books affordable. You can even download a high-quality audio book for free as part of the Audible free trial.",

        "text":"Bygone Badass Broads & Books: Florence Price, Caresse Crosby, Fatima al-Fihiri, Sybil Ludington\n\n\nIt\u2019s time once again for Bygone Badass Broads and Books! If you\u2019re not familiar with the series, every Friday at 1 pm EST, I take to my Twitter and wax poetic about the story of a forgotten badass woman from history and why you should know about her.\n\nToday, I am delighted to be sharing a wrap up of the women I talked about this month as well as some book recommendations to go with them!\n\nFlorence Price\n\nFlorence Price was the first African-American woman to have a symphony played by a major orchestra in the United States.\n\nthis song will save your life leila salesThis Song Will Save Your Life by Leila Sales\nAfter a suicide attempt, Elise finds solace and empowerment in DJing at local venues. Like Florence, Elise finds herself breaking barriers and coming up against sexism in the music industry, but loves her art enough to fight for it.\n\ntiny pretty things sona charaipotra dhonielle claytonTiny Pretty Things by Sona Charaipotra and Dhonielle Clayton\nMuch like Florence, the three protagonists of Tiny Pretty Things will do anything for their art \u2013 in this case, ballet. But they\u2019re willing to go to a bit more dramatic measures for success than Florence did. A dramatic, page-turning thriller set in the high stakes world of a competitive ballet academy.\n\nthe voice that challenged the nation by russell freedmanThe Voice that Challenged a Nation by Russell Freedman\nA compelling and readable biography of Marian Anderson, a similarly pioneering black musician in mid-twentieth century America. When she sang her historic concert at the Lincoln Memorial, she closed with a song by her good friends, Florence Price.\n\nCaresse Crosby\n\nCaresse Crosby was the holder of the first patent on the modern bra, publisher of literary greats in the 1920s and 1930s, patroness of the arts, all-around wild party girl and owner of a dog named Clitoris.\n\ngreat sara benincasaGreat by Sara Benincasa\nA modern (and queer!) retelling of The Great Gatsby about girls summering in the Hamptons. Since Caresse was publisher of a lot of the crowd F. Scott Fitzgerald ran around with, this is a great modern update of the sort of novels she worked on.\n\nthe diviners libba brayThe Diviners by Libba Bray\nEvie O\u2019Neill fights paranormal monsters in jazz age New York, set against the backdrop of the sort of clubs and hedonism where Caresse made a name for herself. Perhaps they would have partied together.\n\nvelvet undercover teri brownVelvet Undercover by Teri Brown\nThere are not enough YA books about World War I, but it\u2019s a big reason Caresse\u2019s patent for the modern bra caught on. A spy mystery set during the Great War that will keep you turning pages as Sam, a non-nonsense girl who suffers no sexism, takes a job as a spy for MI5.\n\nFatima al-Fihiri\n\nFatima al-Fihiri was the founder of the first and oldest operating university and library in the world, Al-Qarawiyyin, in Fez, Morocco.\n\nwritten in the stars aisha saeedWritten in the Stars by Aisha Saeed\nA suspenseful and moving story about religion, identity and fate. Like Fatima, Naila is a Muslim girl trying to find her footing in both her faith and her world. And Aisha Saeed is a Muslim Pakistani-American too!\n\ntell me again sara farizanTell Me Again How A Crush Should Feel by Sara Farizan\nLeila has almost finished her education at a prestigious boarding school\u2026 when she falls for a beautiful new girl. Another book by a Muslim author about an Iranian-American girl discovering her identity \u2013 and all set against the backdrop of boarding school, which I think Fatima would have been into.\n\nroomies sara zarr tara altebrandoRoomies by Sara Zarr and Tara Altebrando\nAn east coast\/west coast virtual friendship between two soon-to-be college roommates from very different worlds, each dealing with their own problems the summer before college starts. How could I not include a YA college book on the list for the founder of the world\u2019s oldest university?\n\nSybil Ludington\n\nSybil Ludington was the teenage patriot and Revolutionary War hero who rode twice the distance of Paul Revere in a single night to muster her father\u2019s militia and defend the town of Danbury, Connecticut against the British.\n\nsophia's war aviSophia\u2019s War by Avi\nThe execution of Nathan Hale spurs sixteen year old Sophia to take part in the Revolution against the British in the American Colonies \u2013 but soon Sophia\u2019s in deeper than she could have anticipated. Like Sybil, Sophia is a feisty girl doing her part to help the revolution.\n\nfever 1793 laurie halse andersonFever 1793 by Laurie Halse Anderson\nSet slightly after Sybil\u2019s historic ride, this evergreen favorite follows a young woman fighting for survival during the Yellow Fever epidemic in Philadelphia in 1793. I remember reading this book as a kid and being riveted by this piece of forgotten history, told by the sharp, suspenseful, and totally masterful Laurie Halse Anderson.\n\nJoin our YA newsletter:\n\nNo spam guarantee.\n\n\nAbout Author\n\nMackenzi Lee\n\nMackenzi Lee is a reader, writer, bookseller, unapologetic fangirl, and fast talker. She holds an MFA from Simmons College is the author of THIS MONSTROUS THING, a steampunk reaimgining of Frankenstein, and the forthcoming THE GENTLEMAN'S GUIDE TO VICE AND VIRTUE, both from HarperCollins.

        "text":"10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nOr we\u2019d watch on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Yahoo Originals or any online streaming service, really.\nRecently it was reported that HarperCollins struck a deal with Insurrection Media to option and develop their books for TV or digital originals, you know, like Netflix shows. The first book that is being developed under this deal is a YA book because clearly the suits know what\u2019s good. Mila 2.0 by Debra Driza is currently in the works to be made into a show and we\u2019re down with that because that book is about a girl who doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s an android!\nIn light of this news, we\u2019re here to offer Hollywood (and our bosses upstairs) some other options from the HarperCollins bookshelf that would be epic TV shows.\n\n1. Legacy of Kings by Eleanor Herman\n\nSimilar TV Shows: Game of Thrones, Rome, Outlander, Reign\nLegacy of Kings by Eleanor Herman - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nWhat the YA world (and the rest of the world for that matter) needs is another Game of Thrones-type show to fill the inevitable void that plagues us after each season of the hit HBO show. There are a lot of YA fantasy books out there that could fill this role, but we think Legacy of Kings would actually be the closest and best option as a Game of Thrones replacement. This book is a re-imagining of Alexander the Great as a teenager and has a HUGE cast of characters and spans multiple different continents, has magic elements, tons of action and fight scenes and all the romance you could ask for. The best part is, we heard the rights to this book were already sold so now it just needs to happen. MAKE IT HAPPEN, PEOPLE.\n\n2. Front Lines by Michael Grant\n\nSimilar TV Shows: The Man in the High Castle, Band of Brothers, Bletchley Circle\nFront Lines by Michael Grant - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nThere hasn\u2019t been an amazing show about World War 2 since Band of Brothers and The Pacific and we\u2019re ready to change that. We can totally picture Front Lines by Michael Grant as a beautiful mini-series made for one of the fancier cable networks or Hulu. The book is re-imagining of WW2 is women could enlist and fight in the war and the plot follows three different girls and their journey to enlist, train and enter the war. And that\u2019s just the first book. Front Lines is the first book in a series which means TV producers will have plenty of source material to work with, and it would certainly be a first for TV. And with all the popularity for Amazon\u2019s The Man in the High Castle right now, I don\u2019t see how Hollywood executives could turn down something like Front Lines!\n\n3. Avalon by Mindee Arnett\n\nSimilar TV Shows: Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Cowboy Bebop\nAvalon by Mindee Arnett - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nRemember when space operas used to dominate the airwaves with Star Trek and all of its spin offs and BSG and Firefly? Well, we propose Hollywood bring back the space opera. Why not? Star Wars is back in action, and we\u2019re getting space-set movies every year lately with Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian, so why not bring that to the silver (or digital) screen? To the people with Decision Making Powers reading this, we urge you to read and then produce a show based on Avalon by Mindee Arnett. It\u2019s just a two book series which means it\u2019s already finished which means you don\u2019t have to wait until the author\nGeorge R.R. Martinfinishes the story. The book is about a group of teenage space pirates that is very reminiscent of Firefly and even Cowboy Bebop.\n\n4. How to Love by Katie Cotugno\n\nSimilar TV Shows: The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Teen Mom, Jane the Virgin\nHow to Love by Katie Cotugno - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nYou know how that Showtime show The Affair is told in a present and past and he-said, she-said format? What if there was a teen version of that show that was decidedly less depressing and was more hopeful? That show could be How to Love by Katie Cotugno! The book is about two teens who fall into a messy love and then one day the guy leaves the girl and doesn\u2019t look back. Three years later, the girl now has a three year old daughter and out of the blue, the baby daddy shows back up and complications and mixed emotions ensue. A contemporary show like this would be golden on a network like Freeform, MTV or The CW but we could also see it working really well on a digital platform like Hulu!\n\n5. The Brokenhearted by Amelia Kahaney\n\nSimilar TV Shows: Gotham, Daredevil, Supergirl, Arrow\n\nThe Brokenhearted by Amelia Kahaney - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nThis little, underrated gem of a book would be perfect for Hulu or Amazon Prime to rival Netflix\u2019s Jessica Jones or Daredevil. The Brokenhearted by Amelia Kahaney is a teen novel that is basically the result if Batman and The Bionic Woman got busy and had a book baby. Set in the ruined fictional landscape of Bedlam, a Gotham-like city, this duology is about a girl named Anthem Fleet who ends up with a bionic heart in her chest, because of reasons, and now has these killer powers. Thanks to her mechanical heart, she can run faster, jump higher, fight better, all making her the best weapon Bedlam has against crime!\n\n6. The Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness\n\nSimilar TV Shows: I can\u2019t think of any, but maybe you can in the comments below?\nThe Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nDo you remember watching Buffy and wondering why no one else in the high school ever seems to know about all the supernatural crap happening or ever actually gets involved except to die when the Big Bad blows up the school? So, what if you aren\u2019t the Chosen One like Buffy or Katniss? The one who\u2019s supposed to fight the zombies, or the soul-eating ghosts, or whatever the heck this new thing is, with the blue lights and the death? That is exactly the story that Patrick Ness tells in The Rest of Us Just Live Here. So imagine a show about regular, normal teenagers who live in a world where all this crazy stuff is happening around them and they\u2019re just like, trying to get through Monday, man. Wouldn\u2019t that be a fun\/funny show to watch? I know I\u2019d watch it.\n\n7. Alice in Zombieland by Gena Showalter\n\nSimilar TV Shows: iZombie, Once Upon a Time\nAlice in Zombieland by Gena Showalter - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nAlice in Wonderland + Zombies = RATINGS GOLD. I don\u2019t really have to say more, do I? Okay, fine, I will. Just imagine the ridiculous sets and costumes that would be on a TV show based on Alice in Zombieland by Gena Showalter! The book isn\u2019t so much of a retelling of Alice in Wonderland as it is an homage to it, but I\u2019m pretty sure TV execs could change some things around and make it a bit more of a straight retelling (you know, \u2019cause you gotta hook in those viewers!) And since there are four books in the series, show writers will have plenty of source material to work with! I hope you are paying attention to this blog post, Hulu!\n\n8. Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi\n\nSimilar TV Shows: The 100, Misfits\nShatter Me by Tahereh Mafi - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nWell the good thing about the Shatter Me book series by Tahereh Mafi is that this has already been optioned for TV by ABC Signature Studios with Tahereh on board as a Consulting Producer. But until we actually see the show IRL, we\u2019re going to list it here because we all know that when movie or TV rights are acquired for a book it\u2019s wonderful news, but it doesn\u2019t always mean that a show will actually happen. Dear ABC Signature Studios, here\u2019s why you need to make this show happen: Go read chapter 62 in book 2, Unravel Me. *every YA book lover reading this is nodding their heads in unison to this*\n\n9. The Outliers by Kimberly McCreight\n\nSimilar TV Shows: True Detective, The Bridge, The Leftovers\nThe Outliers by Kimberly McCreight - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\nEveryone loves a good mystery show, especially when you have absolutely no clue as to whodunit and every episode ends on a cliffhanger. The Outliers by Kimberly McCreight (she wrote that mega-bestseller Reconstructing Amelia) would be the perfect book to adapt for a teen version of True Detective or Twinpeaks. The Outliers is the first in a trilogy (the first book goes on sale in May) and it\u2019s about a girl whose best friend goes missing and she must figure out where she is and who took her, but just when you think you\u2019ve read something like this before, the story takes a VERY SHARP left turn and gets weirder and crazier. Please make this one into a show, Netflix!\n\n10. Die for Me by Amy Plum\n\nSimilar TV Shows: The Vampire Diaries, Shadowhunters, Teen Wolf\nDie for Me by Amy Plum - 10 YA Books We'd Watch As TV Shows on Hulu\n\nThe whole paranormal thing might not be all that popular in the YA book world right now, but with the success of shows like The Vampire Diaries (oh look, that\u2019s based on a Harper book too!) and Supernatural, we believe a show based on the popular Die for Me series by Amy Plum would be a big hit. Set in the ultra gorgeous city of Paris, Die for Me introduces a new version of the undead with revenants, beings who are fated to sacrifice themselves over and over again to save others\u2019 lives. When Kate falls for Vincent, a revenant, she must choose between a normal life\u2014or the love of her life. This series is very sexy and filled with all the drama and intrigue any nighttime (or digital) soap opera could ask for!\n\n(Embedded Post from epicreads.com 01\/29\/2016 1:23PM | Posted by: TeamEpicReads)\n\nWhat other YA books would you add to this list?

        "text":"Five Indian children\u2019s books on tiger everyone must read\n\nOn World Tiger Day, it\u2019s time to show your stripes for India\u2019s national animal.\n\nGROWING PANGS \u00a0| \u00a04-minute read\u00a0| \u00a0 29-07-2015\n\nIt\u2019s time to show your stripes for India\u2019s national animal on World Tiger Day. We give you a round-up of five books about this magnificent animal that should be part of your children\u2019s bookshelves.\n\n1. Ambushed by Nayanika Mahtani:\n\n\nThe ten-year-old Tara is a gadget geek, she even thinks her Papa\u2019s birthday cake should be shaped like his BlackBerry phone. Which is why when her banker-turned-photographer father decides to take her to Ranibagh, a tiger reserve in the Himalayan foothills for the summer, she\u2019s horrified. After all, nothing ever happens there, does it? But then Tara lands splat in the middle of an adventure \u2013 who would have thought that the forest was not only home to the beautiful tiger, but also to an international gang of ruthless poachers? Satya, a tribal boy, enlists Tara\u2019s help to literally save the skin of a tigress and her cubs.Ambushed is a fast-paced read that puts the spotlight firmly on conservation. Nayanika Mahtani\u2019s debut novel is peppered with trivia, such as tigers are hard to spot and that some hundred years ago, there were over one lakh tigers in the world. While doing so, she also touches upon themes of social inequalities and the politics of conservation and poaching.\n\n2. Ranthambore Adventures by Deepak Dalal:\n\n\nFor any child who has visited Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, Deepak Dalal\u2019s Ranthambore Adventures is sure to transport them straight back into the Rajasthan forest. Aditya is planning to join his friend Vikram in Ranthambore, when he stumbles upon the diary of a tiger poacher. Aditya is grabbed by the poachers and his friend Aarti follows their trail, all the way to Ranthambore. At the same time, readers are invited into the world of Genghis, a magnificent tiger and his family. An action-packed adventure, Deepak Dalal\u2019s story is an informative read about tigers and their home, the forest. It\u2019s also a story of friendship and courage, harking back to timeless books such as Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five series. Although Ranthambore Adventures was first published in 1998, its message about tiger and forest conservation remains as evocative as ever.\n\n3. The Tigers of Taboo Valley by Ranjit Lal:\n\n\nOne of the best explanation of a poacher comes from Raat-ki-Rani, a tigress who lives in Sher-Kila National Park. She explains to her cubs that \u201cA poacher is one of those two-legged hairless cowards who will kill you if he can. He might use any revolting method he can think of \u2013 poison, traps or guns\u201d. Tragically, the brave tigress dies at the hands of poacher Khoon-Pyaasa, leaving an unwilling boss tiger Rana Shaan-Bahadur to take care of his four cubs, Hasti, Masti, Phasti and Zafraan. But like many forest, this one too is brimming with gossiping animals, a vulture squad called Diclo-Fenac, a photographer from the National Geographic, and an underground group of porcupine terrorists who have it in for tigers. Ranjit Lal offers a hilarious wild rumpus, where readers learn about the fascinating animals, while sparking concern for the forests and its denizens.\n\n4. Tiger by the Tail by Venita Coelho:\n\n\nVenita Coelho\u2019s book comes with a tagline, \u201cSave the Animals, Save the World\u201d \u2013 which happens to be the motto of the Animal Intelligence Agency (AIA). The back of the book explains that the AIA is \u201ca multi-species non-governmental agency. Specially trained animal and human agents work undercover to save animals and save the world. Some of them have the licence to kill\u201d. One of the agents with a licence to kill is Agent No 002 aka Bagha, a member of the Panthera tigris species. The tiger is 250kgs of sheer intelligence and muscle. He\u2019s really what one could call a cool cat. Bagha and Rana, a boy who can communicate with animals because he can JungleSpeak, embark on a mission to investigate the disappearance of tigers from wildlife reserves across South Asia. Tiger by the Tail is a wonderful read, interspersed with pages of trivia and facts about tigers.\n\n5. Tiger on a Tree by Anushka Ravishankar:\n\n\nPublished in 1997, Tiger on a Tree is one of the most iconic books about the big cat. Resplendent in orange and black, the picture book has been illustrated by Pulak Biswas. Anushka Ravishankar tells the story of a scaredy-cat tiger who gets stuck on a tree. As the villagers \u201cGet him! Net Him! Tie Him Tight!\u201d they need to decide what to do with this tiger. Written in verse form, Ravishankar talks about the man-animal conflict, courage, and kindness, in a simple yet beautiful way. Biswas\u2019 illustrations carry forward the tale, bringing the forests, the river and the village alive with his brush.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Riot Headline We\u2019re Closed for Memorial Day\n\nBooks that Transport Me to Other Places\n\nI had real trouble coming up with a headline for this one, so let me explain as best I can. You know those books you read that transport you to other places in such a way that you really feel you\u2019re living in them? You look up after a few chapters and realise that you\u2019re still on your couch in your yoga pants and haven\u2019t actually left the room at all? Those books.When words can transport me to another place in a significant way, somehow the book always ends up in my favourites list.\n\nI am Pilgrim Terry HayesI Am Pilgrim by Terry Hayes\n\nI read the first 500 pages of this on a flight from London to Florida. On landing, my companion said \u201cHey Aisling, we\u2019re landing,\u201d and I genuinely thought we were in Bodrum, Turkey, where much of the action in the book takes place. Terry Hayes has written a tour de force- from New York on 9\/11 to the severe Hindu Kush in Afghanistan and, of course, Bodrum, this one is a perfect example of a book that will take you out of your seat.\n\n\nThe Glorious Heresies Lisa McInerneyThe Glorious Heresies by Lisa McInerney\n\nI preface this by saying that I\u2019m from Cork, where this book is set. I haven\u2019t finished it yet, but McInerney has NAILED what it is to be from Cork, from the vernacular to the attitude to the place names and atmosphere. This is Cork at its grimmest- arguably, anyone who has been to the City will see how accurate the cultural context is.\n\n\nCategory ID: 476\n\nOnly Ever Yours Louise O NeillOnly Ever Yours by Louise O\u2019Neill\n\nLouise O Neill\u2019s book, born of the same strain of feminist theory that made The Handmaid\u2019s Tale a classic, focuses on a dystopian, patriarchal society. It\u2019s completely terrifying, because the beliefs upheld in this society are never questioned. The cloistered, harsh nature of their experiences is transporting in a mental rather than a physical sense. This book stayed in my head for a long time after I put it down.\n\n\nOutlander Diana GabaldonOutlander by Diana Gabaldon\n\nEven without the television show, which adds a visceral reality to this series, Gabaldon hit the nail on the head with her depiction of Jacobite Scotland (I presume- I wasn\u2019t around to know for sure) and 1940s post-war Britain. As the series progresses, the United States in the \u201960s for a female doctor, the birth of the US colonies and the slave trade in Jamaica are brilliantly portrayed. Gabaldon brings her readers around the world, in different timelines, to perfection.\n\nNoughts and Crosses Malorie BlackmanNoughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman\n\nI read this when I was 15 and it\u2019s stuck with me for over a decade. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s also had its fair share of controversy. Blackman turned the real world on its head, outlining a life where white people (Crosses) are inferior to the black skinned Noughts. The descriptions of the desperation that leads to violence and terrorism, coupled with a believable love story, make this a real live-in world. If you\u2019re looking for something to totally change your perspective, this is it.\n\nHis Dark Materials Philip PullmanHis Dark Materials by Philip Pullman\n\nGood fantasy requires good transportation out of this world, but Pullman did one better; he gave us a series of worlds, a war against God, an impossible romance and a series of different lives lived in different places, both in our world and others. I fell in love with the Oxford College Lyra lives in and considers home, but the time spent in the land of the dead is achingly good. If you haven\u2019t read these, you\u2019ve done yourself a disservice.\n\nIn Order to Live Yeonmi ParkIn Order to Live by Yeonmi Park\n\nA non-fiction entry from North Korean Yeonmi Park deserves a place here. Given the secretive nature of North Korea generally, this already shines a light in a dark place, but Park\u2019s story of growing up in North Korea and then fleeing through Mongolia and China to South Korea, is incredible. Park has suffered for being a North Korean as well as being a woman and this was the first book I read that brought me into North Korea- and convinced me that, far from a tourist fancy, it is a tough, dark, difficult place.",
