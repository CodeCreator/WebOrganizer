        "text":"Medical Marijuana\n\nMedical Marijuana: The FAQs\n\nMedical marijuana refers to the cultivation, use, and possession of marijuana in whole, unprocessed plants, or extracts to treat symptoms and illnesses.\n\nScientific and medical research recommend the use of medical Marijuana to treat terminal illnesses or long-term symptoms associated with cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, and AIDS. Marijuana contains about 100 cannabinoids and two of these chemical ingredients (THC and CBD) are widely used to manufacture medical drugs. Unlike other cannabinoids, THC and CBD play a crucial role in the body by regulating pleasure, promoting muscle movement, boosting memory and concentration, reducing pain, preventing inflammations, and controlling epileptic seizures.\n\nMedical Marijuana Laws\n\nThe Federal government has made the cultivation, possession, and use of medical marijuana in the US illegal. Through the Food and Drug Administration, the federal government requires carefully conducted studies and clinical trials in thousands of human subjects to determine the benefits and risk exposures of a possible medication. Hitherto, researchers have not conducted sufficient large-scale clinical trials about the benefits and risks of marijuana plant among patients with terminal illnesses. On the other hand, states have legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, twenty-nine states have legalized medical marijuana under controlled conditions as of April 2017. Although the law dictates that federal laws are above state laws, various federal and state agencies have come together to solve the incessant battle between federal and state laws regarding medical marijuana.\n\nMedical Marijuana penalties\n\nAlthough an increased number of states continue to enact statutes permitting terminally ill patients to cultivate, possess, and use medical marijuana, the federal government treats marijuana as a drug under schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act. Under this act, cannabis is viewed as a highly addictive drug having no medical value. Penalties for medical marijuana include imprisonment, fines or both depending on the felony class and the state.\n\nIn states that have not legalized medical marijuana, offenses are treated as felony drug charges while states that have decriminalized medical marijuana treat offenses as minor infractions. One may be charged with offenses under the following circumstances\n\n  \u2022 The sale of the drug to minors\n  \u2022 Possession of grams beyond the recommended amounts\n  \u2022 Cultivation of marijuana in states where cultivation is illegal\n  \u2022 Possession of marijuana equipment.\n\nWhere convicted and sentenced, a minimum of 85% of the sentence must be served. Possession or cultivation of higher quantities beyond the legalized amounts attract a longer jail term with minimal chances for probation or alternative sentencing. In California, which was the first state to decriminalize medical marijuana, possessing more than 1 kg of cannabis with no preceding sentences carries a minimum of six months jail term with a probability of probation. Higher quantities with prior convictions carry a minimum of two years with no possibilities for parole.\n\nPossible Defenses\n\nPatients arrested and prosecuted for the possession, cultivation, or use of medical marijuana have only the medical necessity as a probable defense under the First Amendment. The medical necessity defense is grounded as a state common law or general defense statute where one proves that their action, albeit being illegal, prevented harm. However, under the medical necessity defense, the defendant must prove beyond reasonable doubt that\n\n  \u2022 They did not intentionally bring about the circumstances that caused the illegal act and\n  \u2022 They could not accomplish the same objective using a less offensive alternative\n\nIt is important to consult with medical professionals and marijuana defense attorneys on the required documentation for the defendant to urge their case should be they found guilty of the drug felony.\n\nMany types of research funded by the National Institute of Health continue to explore the benefits of cannabinoids in the medical fields. Current research is directed towards the prevention of growth and multiplication of cancer cells. Evidence from some clinical and preclinical trials ascertain that extracts from whole-plant marijuana plants can indeed treat symptoms of diseases affecting the immune system. However, such research faces multiple legal issues that hinder progress. Stakeholders in the healthcare and legal sectors should work together and enact systems that will promote research and uphold legal standards.\n\nRead More:\u00a0Marijuana Laws in California\n\nTags: ,\nPosted in CA Laws Comments Off on Medical Marijuana: The FAQs\n\nBail Bond Rates\n\nIn general, the standard industry rate for bail bonds is 10% of the face amount of bail.

        "text":"Many people can be deeply affected by someone\u2019s untimely death. Of course, immediate family members are usually the people who most feel the loss, but other relatives, close friends, and even co-workers or employees can suffer emotionally and financially because of the death. When the death is caused by the negligent or intentional actions of another person, legal action may be pursued in the form of a wrongful death lawsuit. However, state law is very clear about just who is entitled to file such a claim and who is not.\n\nWhat Missouri Says About Wrongful Death\n\nThe Missouri wrongful death statute outlines a very specific list of people who may file a suit. The statute also makes it clear that only one person may file a suit against one defendant for the death of a person. In the first group of eligible plaintiffs are the following:\n\n  \u2022 Spouse of the deceased\n  \u2022 Children, natural or adopted, legitimate or illegitimate, of the deceased\n  \u2022 Grandchildren of the deceased, if the children of the deceased are also deceased\n  \u2022 Father or mother of the deceased, natural or adopted\n\nIf there is no one in any of these categories to file suit, then the following family members may take action:\n\n  \u2022 Brother or sister of the deceased\n  \u2022 Descendants of siblings of the deceased\n  \u2022 In both cases, the plaintiffs must prove that they will suffer financial or emotional loss because of the death\n\nFinally, if there is no one in either of these groups to file a wrongful death lawsuit, the court may appoint a plaintiff ad litem chosen from any applicants who feel they have a legitimate claim to proceeds from the suit. It is important to note that stepchildren are not permitted under Missouri law to file a wrongful death lawsuit for the death of a stepparent.\n\nKansas Statute Is a Little More Restrictive\n\nThe Kansas statute governing wrongful death claims is short and sweet: \u201cThe action may be commenced by any one of the heirs at law of the deceased who has sustained a loss by a reason of the death.\u201d An heir, according to Kansas law, is one who takes intestate succession, so if the deceased leaves behind a spouse or children, the parents and siblings of the deceased are not eligible to make a claim. Unlike in Missouri, where a biological connection is enough, in Kansas, the plaintiffs must also be financial dependents who will be harmed by the loss.\n\nHas A Loved One Died Due To The Negligence of Others?\n\nIf your loved one has died due to the negligence of someone else an experienced wrongful death attorney can help you hold them responsible.

        "text":"Tips and gratuities\n\nPrinter friendly version\n\n\nLabor Code Section 351 prohibits employers and their agents from sharing in or keeping any portion of a gratuity left for or given to one or more employees by a patron. Furthermore it is illegal for employers to make wage deductions from gratuities, or from using gratuities as direct or indirect credits against an employee's wages. The law further states that gratuities are the sole property of the employee or employees to whom they are given. \"Gratuity\" is defined in the Labor Code as a tip, gratuity, or money that has been paid or given to or left for an employee by a patron of a business over and above the actual amount due for services rendered or for goods, food, drink, articles sold or served to patrons. It also includes any amount paid directly by a patron to a dancer covered by IWC Wage Order 5 or 10.\n\n\nWhat is a tip?\n\n\nA tip is money a customer leaves for an employee over the amount due for the goods sold or services rendered. Tips belong to the employee, not to the employer.\n\n\nWhen a customer pays their bill with a credit card and the payment includes a tip, when can the employee expect to receive the money from the employer?\n\n\nPayment of a gratuity made by a patron using a credit card must be paid to the employee not later than the next regular payday following the date the patron authorized the credit card payment. Labor Code Section 351\n\n\nMy employer is deducting the credit card processing fees from my tips. Is this legal?\n\n\nNo. Labor Code Section 351 provides that the employer must pay the employee the full amount of the tip that is indicated on the credit card. The employer may not make any deduction for credit card processing fees or costs that are charged to the employer by the credit card company from gratuities paid to the employee.\n\n\nI work in a large restaurant as a waiter. My employer told me that I am required to share my tips with the busboy and the bartender. Am I obligated to do this?\n\n\nYes. Labor Code Section 351 provides that \"every gratuity is hereby declared to be the sole property of the employee or employees to whom it was paid, given, or left for\". The section has been interpreted to allow for involuntary tip pooling so long as the tip pooling policy is not used to compensate the owner(s), manager(s), or supervisor(s) of the business, even if these individuals should provide direct table service to a patron or are in the chain of service to a patron. In addition, the policy must be fair and reasonable. Therefore, your employer can require that you share your tips with other staff that provide service in the restaurant so long as the employees that share in the tip pooling policy are employees to whom the tip was paid, given, or left for. In this regard, the courts have validated policies that distributed tips among employees who provide \"direct table service\" or who are in the \"chain of service\" provided that employee in the chain of service bears a relationship to the customers' overall experience. (updated March 2013).\n\n\nAre the tips I receive considered part of my \"regular rate of pay\" for overtime calculations?\n\n\nNo. Since tips are voluntarily left for you by the customer of the business and are not being provided by the employer, they are not considered as part of your regular rate of pay when calculating overtime.\n\n\nIs a mandatory service charge considered to be the same as a tip or gratuity?\n\n\nNo, a tip is a voluntary amount left by a patron for an employee. A mandatory service charge is an amount that a patron is required to pay based on a contractual agreement or a specified required service amount listed on the menu of an establishment. An example of a mandatory service charge that is a contractual agreement would be a 10 or 15 percent charge added to the cost of a banquet. Such charges are considered as amounts owed by the patron to the establishment and are not gratuities voluntarily left for the employees. Therefore, when an employer distributes all or part of a service charge to its employees, the distribution may be at the discretion of the employer and the service charge, which would be in the nature of a bonus, would be included in the regular rate of pay when calculating overtime payments.\n\n\nMy employer deducts my tips from my paycheck. Is this legal?\n\n\nNo. Your employer can neither take your tips (or any part of them), nor deduct money from your wages because of the tips you earn. Furthermore, your employer cannot credit your tips against the money the employer owes you. Labor Code Section 351\n\n\nMy employer pays me less than the minimum wage because he includes my tips in my hourly pay. Is this legal?\n\n\nNo. Unlike under federal regulations, in California an employer cannot use an employee's tips as a credit towards its obligation to pay the minimum wage. California law requires that employees receive the minimum wage plus any tips left for them by patrons of the employer's business. Labor Code Section 351\n\n\nWhat can I do if my employer credits my tips against my wages?\n\n\nYou can either file a wage claim with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (the Labor Commissioner's Office), or you can file a lawsuit in court against your employer in to recover the lost wages. Additionally, if your employer is crediting your tips against your wages, you are being underpaid your wages and thus, if you no longer work for this employer, you can make a claim for the waiting time penalty.\n\n\nWhat is the procedure that is followed after I file a wage claim?\n\n\nAfter your claim is completed and filed with a local office of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), it will be assigned to a Deputy Labor Commissioner who will determine, based upon the circumstances of the claim and information presented, how best to proceed. Initial action taken regarding the claim can be (i) referral to a conference, (ii) referral to a hearing, or (iii) dismissal of the claim.\n\nIf the decision is to hold a conference, the parties will be notified by mail of the date, time and place of the conference. The purpose of the conference is to determine the validity of the claim, and to see if the claim can be resolved without a hearing. If the claim is not resolved at the conference, the next step usually is to refer the matter to a hearing or dismiss it for lack of evidence.\n\nAt the hearing the parties and witnesses testify under oath, and the proceeding is recorded. After the hearing, an Order, Decision, or Award (ODA) of the Labor Commissioner will be served on the parties.\n\nEither party may appeal the ODA to a civil court of competent jurisdiction. The court will set the matter for trial, with each party having the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses. The evidence and testimony presented at the Labor Commissioner's hearing will not be the basis for the court's decision. In the case of an appeal by the employer, DLSE may represent an employee who is financially unable to afford counsel in the court proceeding.\n\nSee the Policies and Procedures for Wage Claim Processing pamphlet for more detail on the wage claim procedure.\n\n\nWhat can I do if I prevail at the hearing and the employer doesn't pay or appeal the Order, Decision, or Award?\n\n\nWhen the Order, Decision, or Award (ODA) is in the employee's favor and there is no appeal, and the employer does not pay the ODA, the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) will have the court enter the ODA as a judgment against the employer. This judgment has the same force and effect as any other money judgment entered by the court. Consequently, you may either try to collect the judgment yourself or you can assign it to DLSE.\n\n\nWhat can I do if my employer retaliates against me because I objected to his crediting my tips against my wages?\n\n\nIf your employer discriminates or retaliates against you in any manner whatsoever, for example, he discharges you because you object to his crediting your tips against your wages, or because you file a claim or threaten to file a claim with the Labor Commissioner, you can file a discrimination\/retaliation complaint with the Labor Commissioner's Office. In the alternative, you can file a lawsuit in court against your employer.",

        "text":"Florida law provided for an injured person to be compensated or made whole by the responsible party. Obviously, the extent of compensation will vary depending on the specific facts or a case. In many cases, however, full compensation may include elements of damage other than payment of medical bills, such as payment for pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of ability to enjoy life, lost wages and diminished earning capacity. This is why early consultation with a lawyer experienced in personal injury cases can help you obtain the maximum recovery allowed by the law.\n\nBefore hiring a lawyer, you should research the law firm and lawyers you are considering to represent you. Ask for information about the lawyer\u2019s education, training and experience, and ask the lawyer to tell you about his\/her experience in dealing with cases similar to yours.\n\nAsk about the lawyer\u2019s trial and courtroom experience, and assure yourself that if your case goes to trial, your lawyer has the knowledge and experience to take you there. Ask the lawyer to go over the attorney\u2019s fee contract with you in detail, and be sure you understand how the lawyer\u2019s fees and costs will be paid at the end of the case.\n\nMost trial lawyers are willing to handle personal injury cases on a contingency fee basis. This means that the lawyer will not charge you a fee for his time unless there is a recovery. If a recovery is made, then the attorney\u2019s fee is based on an agreed percentage of the gross amount recovered.\n\nThe lawyers at Johnson & Williams, P.A. charge contingency fees in accordance with the Florida Supreme Court guidelines, typically 33-1\/3% in a case that is settled before the need for a lawsuit arises, and 40% when a lawsuit becomes necessary and is contested. The contingent attorney\u2019s fee does not include the costs of pursuing a claim, which may range from just a few hundred dollars to tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThese costs are payable separately, and not as a part of the contingent fee. Although many law firms may require you to pay these costs in advance, at Johnson and Williams, P.A. we understand that the consequences of an injury make it difficult, if not impossible, for our clients to advance the costs of a case.\n\nIn most cases, we pay the costs, and simply ask to be reimbursed at the conclusion of a case when your recovery is received.\n\nTypically, no. The majority of cased we handle involve a contingency fee contract. That means we do not get paid unless and until our client makes a recovery.\n\nIn some unique circumstances, we will represent a client on an hourly-fee basis, if the case calls for such an arrangement. In either case, the fee and cost agreement you have with our firm will be explained to you in detail before we begin pursuit of your claim.\n\nIndeed, it can be very expensive to pursue claims involving serious injuries, medical malpractice and defective products. It is not uncommon for the costs in such cases to exceed many tens of thousand dollars.\n\nAt Johnson and Williams, P.A. we understand that the expenses of pursuing significant cases can be substantial. Accordingly, we have positioned ourselves to be able to advance the costs necessary to prepare cases properly for trial Ultimately, out-of-pocket expenses are a client\u2019s responsibility in a successfully-concluded case. While a case is pending, we generally advance the expenses incurred during our representation.\n\nIf and when the case reaches a successful conclusion, the costs we have expended are returned to us out of your recovery.\n\nEvery case is unique. Before an accurate determination of the value of your personal injury case can be made, your doctors must have determined that you have reached maximum medical improvement, and we must have a thorough understanding of your course of medical treatment, your current condition and your future prognosis.\n\nAdditionally, we must have had an opportunity to completely investigate the details of the accident, and analyze the impact that the accident has had on your wage-earning ability and on your lifestyle. Only then can an experienced and knowledgeable personal injury attorney accurately determine the value of your case.\n\nYou should be wary of any law firm that purports to put a specific value on your claim before having an opportunity to learn all of the relevant facts and determine the impact that the accident will have on your future.\n\nYou should know that the vast majority of personal injury claims are resolved before a jury reaches a verdict at trial. Many cases are settled even before a lawsuit must be filed. The ultimate decision about whether to file a lawsuit at all is the client\u2019s. At Johnson and Williams, P.A. we are committed to helping our clients reach a satisfactory conclusion to their claim, whether by a lawsuit and trial, or by some alternative means. Our lawyers are experienced in alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation and arbitration, that can avoid the need to file a lawsuit altogether.\n\nIn all cases, we take the time to explain to our clients the alternatives available, including the risks and advantages of each, so that our clients can make an informed decision that is best for his or her individual circumstances.\n\nIt is well-documented that most lawsuits that are filed are settled before trial. Regardless, we prepare every case as if it might ultimately be decided by a jury. We believe in being prepared in the event an agreement between the parties cannot be reached.\n\nAt the same time, our philosophy is to aggressively pursue resolution of claims at all stages in the case, so that the process does not become unduly difficult, burdensome, or expensive for our clients, and so that we obtain the best results possible.\n\nStudies show that verdict trends have moved in a more conservative direction over the past several years, both with respect to the probability of a verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor and the amount of damages awarded. The popular media focus on the unusual verdicts, and tend to sensationalize jury awards that are exceptional.\n\nDo not be misled into thinking that juries routinely award large amounts of money for personal injury claims. The results in any case depend on its particular facts and the effectiveness of your legal representation.",

        "text":"Lawyers and Settlements\nHome Page >> Hot Legal Issues >> Legal Malpractice >> FAQ \/ Info\n\nLegal Malpractice Lawsuit FAQ\n\nWhat is Legal Malpractice?\n\nLegal Malpractice occurs when a lawyer's services fall below the standard of care; it means a lawyer has been negligent when providing legal advice or representation and has caused harm. Three areas of liability are Negligence (the most common cause of action); Breach of fiduciary duty; and Breach of contract.\n\n(Standard of care means that a lawyer has an obligation to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise under similar circumstances.)\n\nWhat constitutes \"harm\" in legal malpractice?\n\nIn a legal malpractice case, harm (or injury) requires that the client has suffered a financial loss or wrongful criminal conviction. Generally, emotional suffering does not constitute legal malpractice but there are a few exceptions to every rule. For instance, you could suffer stress and anxiety due to your lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fraudulent actions. The threat of possible future harm is not considered an \"injury\" in legal malpractice cases.\n\nMy lawyer made a few mistakes\u00e2\u0080\u0094does that count as legal malpractice?\n\nNot as a rule. The mistake must have been one that a lawyer of ordinary skill, prudence, and diligence would not have made. If it did not cause harm, the mistake is not legal malpractice.\n\nIs there a difference between a grievance or bar complaint and legal malpractice claim?\n\nYes. As stated above, a legal malpractice claim means that a lawyer's conduct did not meet the standard of care. A grievance or bar complaint is made to the organization (for instance, the bar association in your state) that licenses the lawyer. The state bar can discipline an attorney up to and including disbarring him or her or suspending his or her license.\n\nCommon grievance cases include:\n  \u2022 Lack of communication, i.e., not returning phone calls\n  \u2022 Unreasonable or excessive fees charged\n  \u2022 Clients have paid for work an attorney did not do\n  \u2022 Inappropriate charges\nCommon legal malpractice claims include:\n  \u2022 Failure to know\/apply law\n  \u2022 Failure to file documents and failure to know deadline\n  \u2022 Inadequate discovery\/investigation\n  \u2022 Failure to obtain Client Consent\n  \u2022 Conflict of Interest\n  \u2022 Fraud\nMy lawyer doesn't return my phone calls but I am still paying her bills. What can I do?\n\nLack of communication with a lawyer\/client is the most common complaint made to state bars. If your lawyer isn't returning your phone calls, make a paper trail. Follow up with a letter and\/or fax, telling him or her that you would appreciate a call back, ASAP. If you don't get response from a letter, you might want to speak with another attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0094in another law firm. You are entitled to request your file, regardless whether or not you have outstanding bills.\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) reports that most legal malpractice claims occur when an attorney is perceived as failing to communicate with clients or to educate them about a case.\n\nWhat are some typical examples of legal malpractice?\n\nSome examples are loss of the right to file a lawsuit, dismissal of a valid lawsuit, and losing a case that should have been won.\n\nLegal malpractice suits filed by disgruntled borrowers and lenders against lawyers are most prevalent, with plaintiffs claiming a lawyer should have advised them about the appropriateness of a mortgage. And bankruptcy related claims are common.\n\nStatistics show that lawyers who practice outside of their specialties run a greater risk of being sued for legal malpractice. And lawyers who have suffered from the economy may take on clients that they shouldn't.\n\nMy lawyer didn't file the right paperwork on time with the court and missed a deadline. Can I file a legal malpractice suit against him?\n\nThere are time limits on when you can bring a lawsuit against someone who has violated your rights and missing a deadline with the court is very important. For example, you were injured because of someone's negligence and in your state, you only have two years to file a personal injury lawsuit. If you bring your case to a lawyer in a timely fashion but the lawyer fails to file the papers in time, you could lose your chance to take legal action.\n\nThe failure of your lawyer to file paperwork by a deadline is a form of negligence. To establish legal malpractice under negligence, it is necessary to demonstrate the following:\n  \u2022 The lawyer owed a duty to provide competent and skillful representation;\n  \u2022 The lawyer breached the duty by acting carelessly or by making a mistake;\n  \u2022 The lawyer's breach caused an injury or harm;\n  \u2022 The harm caused a financial loss.\nTo win a legal malpractice claim, it is also necessary to prove causation. It must be shown that if the lawyer had been competent the client would have prevailed in the underlying case and the client would have been able to collect the damage award from the defendant. Causation is often the most difficult to prove in a legal malpractice lawsuit.\n\nI suspect that my lawyer committed legal malpractice; what should I do first?\n\nFirst, speak with your lawyer and find out why specific actions were taken. Perhaps there is a legitimate and justifiable explanation. If you aren't satisfied, you can contact your state's bar's discipline committee and you can also consult a legal malpractice attorney. An experienced legal malpractice attorney can assess your case and determine if indeed you have a case for legal malpractice.\n\nWhat must I prove to win a legal malpractice case?\n\nTo win a legal malpractice case, you must prove four points:\n  1. Your attorney owed you a duty.\n  2. Your attorney breached that duty by acting negligently, and making mistakes a reasonable attorney would not have made.\n  3. Your attorney's behavior caused you damage. This includes proving that the results of your case would have been different (for example, you would have won the case) had the attorney acted properly.\n  4. You suffered a financial loss because of the negligence.\nWhat will a legal malpractice case cost?\n\nLegal malpractice cases are typically complicated\u00e2\u0080\u0094and costly. Generally a legal malpractice case will be more costly than the former case because two cases must be proved: first, whether the attorney committed malpractice, and second, the former case must be presented. This is referred to as \"a case within a case\".\n\nSome attorneys work on a contingency basis while others might bill by the hour. Speak with your attorney about fees as soon as possible and avoid any surprises.\n\nDoes a statute of limitations apply with a legal malpractice case?\n\nYes, and a statute of limitations varies from state to state. Some states allow you two years from the date you knew or reasonably should have known that some error or omission by your attorney caused you some harm, even if you are not yet sure how extensive the harm might be. If you do not file your malpractice suit in court by that date, you won't be able to file again\u00e2\u0080\u0094ever.\n\nDo I have to fire my lawyer before consulting with a legal malpractice lawyer?\n\nNo. You can consult with another attorney at any time and they may be able to remedy your problem right away, without getting into a legal malpractice situation. makes it easy for you to find the Legal Malpractice lawyer. We work with legal malpractice attorneys throughout the US and Canada who practice in this specialized area.\n\nIf you--or someone you know --believe that you have been the victim of legal malpractice, you should check with a legal malpractice lawyer about the specific elements of a legal malpractice action under the laws of your state, and to determine if the incident might constitute legal malpractice.\nPlease click here for a\nfree evaluation of your Legal Malpractice case\nPlease click here for more\nLegal Malpractice info and legal news\n\nLast updated on Jan-3-11\n\nRequest Legal Malpractice Legal Help\n\nFirst name:\n\nLast name:\n\nEmail address:\n\nPhone number(s):\n\nZip\/Postal Code:\n\nDescribe your complaint:\n\nBy submitting this form I agree to the Terms of Service.\nThere is no cost to submit this form.\nI would like to be interviewed by a journalist.\nSubscribe to our free weekly newsletter.\n\nCheck Claim Status Advertise with us Legal Funding\n\nRelated Lawsuits\n\nLegal Services:\n\n\nFAQ | TOS | Privacy | Disclaimer | About Us | Contact Us | Press | Advertise | Member Login | Site Map | View Mobile Website\n\nAmerican Bar Association - Proud Member \u00a0 Better Business Bureau \u00a0 CAALA \u00a0 Best of the Web Approved \u00a0 Public Justice\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License \u00a9 2001-2016 Online Legal Media.
