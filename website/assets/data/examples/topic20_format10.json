According to the administrator, Bell Sympatico\u2019s traffic shaping affects an unmentioned number of applications and protocols, including BitTorrent, Gnutella, Limewire, Kazaa, eDonkey, eMule and WinMX.\n\nA Bell Sympatico Manager chimed in immediately afterwards, explaining that \u201cthere continues to be phenomenal growth of consumer Internet traffic throughout the world\u201d and that \u201cBell is using Internet Traffic Management to ensure we deliver bandwidth fairly to our customers during peak Internet usage.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Manager, the bandwidth cap was introduced sometime last year and \u201cdoesn't affect the vast majority of [Bell\u2019s] customers.\u201d One concerned user asked if the traffic management will be removed as network capacity increases, to which the administrator replied that he \u201ccan\u2019t answer this question,\u201d and noted that it would be decided as the issue arises.\n\nInternet service providers have found themselves under an increasing burden as bandwidth-intensive internet services like online video and file-sharing have proliferated. While the true volume is unknown, many think that 30%-50% of all internet traffic is P2P-related, with a recent survey from traffic-management company Ipoque pushing that number towards an astonishing 90%.\n\nIn response to this, many providers have employed a variety of techniques to limit customers who are deemed to be using more than their \u201cfair share,\u201d a tactic that has been the subject of much debate as part of the controversy surrounding \u201cnetwork neutrality.\u201d\n\nWhile traffic shaping is by far the most common, a few companies have employed more exotic methods: Comcast is thought to impose an invisible 600 GB bandwidth limit on its \u201cunlimited\u201d internet service, and a recent study conducted by the AP found that the ISP impersonates BitTorrent clients for the purposes of interfering with their connections.\n\nComments \u00a0 \u00a0 Threshold\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n\nAnother reason not to choose Bell\nBy DukeN on 11\/12\/2007 7:48:27 AM , Rating: 2\nHere in Canada, they are probably one of the worst organisations out there.

        "text":"This Is Why Half the Internet Shut Down Today\n\nIllustration for article titled This Is Why Half the Internet Shut Down Today\nGraphic: Downdetector\n\nScores of websites and services went down Friday afternoon due to problems with Cloudflare\u2019s DNS service, sparking rampant speculation about the cause. After all, a global DDOS attack would totally fit the real-life apocalypse movie that 2020 is increasingly turning into.\n\n\nThe outage, which started shortly after 5 p.m. ET, brought down popular sites and services like Discord, Politico, Feedly, and League of Legends for roughly half an hour on Friday. Once connections were restored, Cloudflare issued an incident report stating that the issue \u201cwas not as a result of an attack\u201d and that it \u201chas been identified and a fix is being implemented.\u201d\n\n\nTurns out the real explanation\u2019s nothing so nefarious. Evidently, half the internet briefly went dark because of a crappy router in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIt appears that a router in Atlanta had an error that caused bad routes across our backbone. That resulted in misrouted traffic to PoPs that connect to our backbone,\u201d Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince tweeted Friday. \u201cWe isolated the Atlanta router and shut down our backbone, routing traffic across transit providers instead. There was some congestion that caused slow performance on some links as the logging caught up. Everything is restored now and we\u2019re looking into the root cause.\u201d\n\nAccording to the incident report, this issue with Cloudflare\u2019s DNS service impacted its data centers internationally, from Frankfurt to Paris and Schiphol, as well as several in major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, and San Jose. Reports on Downdetector showed the outages appeared to be concentrated in the U.S. and northern Europe.\n\nA DNS, or Domain Name System, serves as the connective tissue between the domain name you use to locate a website (like and its corresponding IP address, which determines the site\u2019s specific location on the web. The service essentially acts as a digital phonebook for the internet, and there\u2019s no getting to where you want to go online without it\u2014regardless of whether a site\u2019s own servers are working or not. Some internet providers rely on their own DNS service, but alternatives from the likes of Google and Cloudflare, which launched its version in 2018, are more commonly used.\n\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder that most people immediately thought malicious hackers might have been the cause given this week\u2019s Twitter hack for the history books. That kind of sprawling breach would have anyone on edge. And while a glitch in Cloudflare\u2019s system may not be as exciting an explanation, at least we got a few good memes out of the deal.\n\nGizmodo weekend editor. Freelance games reporter.

The revamp focuses on simplifying the messaging experience by removing some of the clutter users have complained about in the past.\n\nMessenger 4 has simplified its navigation, revamping the entire bottom tab menu. It starts with one-to-one and group conversations, which are now combined into a single Chats tab. The company is also adding a new Camera button on the top right of this menu to let users easily share photos and videos to your friends and family.\u00a0You\u2019ll also have revamped People and Discover tabs which are self-explanatory.\n\nIn a recent Messenger study, 7 out of 10 (71%) people told us simplicity is the top priority for them in a messaging app.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all, Messenger 4 will also bring in new ways to personalize conversations with custom nicknames, emojis, and chat colors. This includes the ability to create a really incredible OLED dark mode with custom chat bubble colors. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to apply this app-wide, but just to the specific chat you\u2019re in. You can, however, manually theme every chat with the dark mode.\n\nWhile Messenger 4 is all about simpler and easier-to-use messaging, we\u2019re still keeping all of the features that help you connect with the people you care about. Whether you want to poll your friends on which movie to see, split the bill for last night\u2019s dinner, share your live location to find friends at a music festival, challenge them to your favorite games, or catch up in a group video chat, we aren\u2019t changing anything about what you\u2019ve always loved about Messenger.\n\nThe new update will be rolling out globally in the coming weeks.

        "text":"Spear Phishing Attacks On The Rise\n\nSymantec warns that spear-phishing attack volume has hit a two-year high as attackers try to install botnet software, keylogging applications, or other malware.\nStrategic Security Survey: Global Threat, LocalPain\nStrategic Security Survey: Global Threat, Local Pain\n(click image for larger view and for full slideshow)\nTargeted email attacks are on the rise. In fact, the volume of such attacks has recently reached a two-year high.\n\nThat warning comes via Symantec, which said that it's now intercepting 85 targeted attacks per day--a subset of the actual number that would be seen on the Internet--which is the highest volume since March 2009, when it saw 107 attacks per day prior to that year's G20 conference in London.\n\nFurthermore, the nature of such attacks appears to be evolving. \"While some high-profile targeted attacks in 2010 attempted to steal intellectual property or cause physical damage, many of these targeted attacks preyed on individuals for their personal information,\" said Francis deSouza, group president of enterprise products and services for Symantec, in a blog post.\n\nSymantec's warning came on the heels of last week's announcement from Google that it was seeing attacks that targeted specific Gmail users' accounts. Google's Eric Grosse, the engineering director of the Google Security Team, said the attack appeared to originate from China.\n\n\"We recently uncovered a campaign to collect user passwords, likely through phishing,\" said Grosse in a website post. \"This campaign, which appears to originate from Jinan, China, affected what seem to be the personal Gmail accounts of hundreds of users including, among others, senior U.S. government officials, Chinese political activists, officials in several Asian countries (predominantly South Korea), military personnel and journalists.\"\n\n\"The goal of this effort seems to have been to monitor the contents of these users' emails, with the perpetrators apparently using stolen passwords to change peoples' forwarding and delegation settings,\" he said.\n\nGrosse said that Google's investigation was aided by spear-phishing research published in February, which warned that attackers were using fake Gmail log-in pages to harvest log-in credentials, then forwarding email to an attacker-controlled account.\n\nTo mitigate the risk that these types of targeted attacks pose, Grosse offered numerous recommendations, including activating two-step verification for Gmail, which employs a phone and second password for signing in. He also recommended using a unique, strong password, and never entering it except for a proper sign-in prompt on a page encrypted via HTTPS, and watching for red \"warning about suspicious activity\" that appear above the Gmail inbox. Finally, he said that users should beware attempts to forward their accounts to strange addresses, or to delegate the account inappropriately.\n\nGmail tweaks aside, stopping targeted attacks remains quite difficult, as its success against numerous organizations, including the White House, as well as security powerhouse RSA, illustrates.\n\nThat's because many of these attacks employ so-called spear phishing techniques. Unlike regular phishing, which sends large numbers of emails to large numbers of people, spear-phishing refers to sending a phishing email to a particular person or relatively small group. Attackers may also heavily customize their spear-phishing emails, using public information gleaned from the Web, to make the emails seem more authentic.\n\nThe purpose of these targeted attacks it typically to get the recipient to execute an attachment, which is really malware, or to get them to visit a website that then attempts to exploit their PC using known vulnerabilities. In either case, the attacker's goal is to gain root-level access to the targeted PC, typically by installing botnet software, keylogging applications, or other malware.\n\nIn this new Tech Center report, we profile five database breaches--and extract the lessons to be learned from each.

Paul Ferguson, Senior Threat Researcher with the company, describes it as \"one of those smaller, more obscure botnets. The insidious thing about botnets\u2014especially those that fly under the radar\u2014is that the possibility is much greater of data being stolen by criminals,\" since the threat is relatively unknown.\n\nThis one could be especially problematic for corporate security, notes Michael Fitzpatrick, president of information risk management consultancy NCX Group. He points out that the bot appears to operate in a unique method, by flooding the UDP traffic on a network.\n\n\"That's usually traffic for your logs, for the routers and switches in the network,\" explains Fitzpatrick. \"This would flood the logs, and this malware may be using that fact to mask and disguise what's actually happening.\"\n\nIn addition, this threat is very complex, working in multiple ways: running automatically from USB sticks, through an Internet-based update module, and across the MSN Messenger chat network, plus there's a command and control interface to talk to other elements.\n\nThe potential for hidden botnets savaging unguided through corporate networks is a scary one, but at this point, there's little information about the potential danger of this one. Still, better safe than sorry, notes Fitzpatrick, who suggests that IT pros keep an ear to the ground. After all, everyone has heard of the big name threats, such as Confiker. \"There are lots of little, small, specially crafted botnets that fly under the radar. And they're really the danger.\"\n\nJeremy A. Kaplan is Science and Technology editor at, where he heads up coverage of gadgets, the online world, space travel, nature, the environment, and more.

Terms of use.\n\nGoogle on Thursday added a new layer of security to the Android Market, dubbed Bouncer, that will scan apps for evidence of malware.\n\nThe effort will automatically scan new and existing apps as well as developer accounts, \"without disrupting the user experience of Android Market or requiring developers to go through an application approval process,\" said Google's vice president of engineering, Hiroshi Lockheimer, in a nod to Apple's App Store process.\n\n\"Here's how it works: once an application is uploaded, the service immediately starts analyzing it for known malware, spyware and trojans,\" Lockheimer wrote in a blog post. \"It also looks for behaviors that indicate an application might be misbehaving, and compares it against previously analyzed apps to detect possible red flags.\"\n\nGoogle said it runs every app in its cloud infrastructure to simulate how it might work on an Android device to look for anything fishy. Developer accounts are also scrutinized to guard against banned individuals making a reappearance.\n\nAndroid malware was big news in 2011. Unlike Apple, Google does not have a strict approval process in place for its Android Market, and while that might make for a more open environment, it also makes the store vulnerable to some dangerous apps.\n\n\"We've chosen not to be the gatekeeper,\" Alan Davidson, now former director of public policy at Google, said during a May hearing on location tracking. \"We don't generally go back and try to make sure that every app does what it says it's going to do. [Google is] really trying to maximize the ability of small app developers to get online.\"\n\nAccording to data from Juniper Networks, malware in the Android Market jumped 472 percent between July and November 2011. Google said today, however, that it saw a 40 percent decline in the number of potentially malicious downloads on the Android Market between the first and second halves of 2011.\n\n\"This drop occurred at the same time that companies who market and sell anti-malware and security software have been reporting that malicious applications are on the rise,\" Lockheimer wrote. \"We know the rate is declining significantly.\"\n\nAfter announcing the discovery of the most widespread piece of Android malware, Android.Counterclank, Symantec today retracted its claim to align with rival Lookout's more muted assessment.\n\nLast month, in hopes of capitalizing on Google's mobile security problems, Microsoft offered free Windows Phones to Android malware victims.",

        "text":"Apple Delays iTunes 11 Launch to \"Get it Right\"\n\nSomething that has long set Apple apart from its competitors, and is one of the reasons for its success, is that it refuses to release a product that's less-than-perfect. Of course, recent launches and issues brought forth by those may lead us to question if that's still the case, but more often than not, the company is truly meticiulous when it comes to the design of many of its products, both hardware and software.\n\nBut... there can be exceptions. For about as long as iTunes has existed, it's been considered a bloated mess by many - and we're not talking only the Windows port here. The problem isn't even so much the fact that it installs multiple background services and usually finds a way to pack in additional software, such as QuickTime (and at one point, Safari for Windows). No, the problem has been that the program as a whole runs sluggish, and really isn't much of a joy to use. You may have an \u00fcber-fast PC, but iTunes is one piece of software that could make you think otherwise.\n\nGiven all this, it was of great interest to many when Apple talked briefly about the upcoming version of iTunes during its iPhone 5 launch event (read our review of the phone here). It was touted as being the most major update to ever hit the software, and the promise was that we'd see it before the end of October. Given the date of this news post, and the fact that the latest iTunes is still not here, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the almighty Apple missed a deadline.\n\nBut it's for good reason, as Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr puts it:\n\n\"The new iTunes is taking longer than expected and we wanted to take a little extra time to get it right. We look forward to releasing this new version of iTunes with its dramatically simpler and cleaner interface and seamless integration with iCloud before the end of November.\"\n\nAlthough I've used iTunes extensively in the past, I pretty much try to avoid it at all costs now. But with Tom's comments above, I have to say I'm rather excited to see what the final software is going to look like. In addition to aesthetics and design improvements, the latest iTunes will have faster performance, a full-library search, improved iCloud integration, a redesigned mini-player and a new full-window interface for both the PC and Mac.\n\nVia:\u00a0 AllThingsD\nTags:\u00a0 Apple, itunes, music\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus",

Microsoft at that time was tight lipped about the future of IE10 for Windows 7\n\nOctober 2012 came and brought along Windows 8's launch. It was in the week prior to the release of Windows 8 that the company shed some light on the future of IE10 for Windows 7. A blog post indicated that Microsoft had plans to release a \u00a0preview version for Windows 7 in November 2012.\n\nInternet Explorer 10 Preview for Windows 7 released today for 32-bit and 64-bit editions of the operating system, and for 64-bit editions of Windows Server 2008 R2.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n  \u2022 32-bit or 64-bit edition of Windows 7 SP1 or 64-bit edition of Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1\n  \u2022 At least 512 Megabyte of RAM\n  \u2022 At least 70 \/ 120 \/ 200 Megabyte of hard drive space\n  \u2022 At least 1 GHz processor\n\nInstallation and uninstallation\n\nThe installation of Internet Explorer 10 Preview will replace the current version of the browser on the system. A restart is required before the new version becomes available.\n\nNote that it is possible to uninstall IE10 again on a system it has been installed on. To uninstall the browser do the following:\n\n  1. Click on the Start button.\n  2. Type Programs and Features in the search box and select it from the results.\n  3. Select View installed updates from the sidebar.\n  4. Locate Windows Internet Explorer 10 under Microsoft Windows.\n  5. Right-click the entry and select uninstall.\n  6. Select Yes when prompted if you really want to uninstall the program.\n  7. Restart the PC right then or at a later point to complete the removal.\n\nWhat's New\n\nInternet Explorer 10 is nearly identical to the version of the browser that Microsoft released for Windows 8. The core difference: is: Adobe Flash is not natively integrated into the Windows 7 \/ Windows Server 2012 version.\n\nBoth Internet Explorer 10 versions on Windows 8 include a built-in version of Adobe Flash, which is especially important for the Modern UI version of the browser as it does not support browser plugins. Microsoft circumvented this restriction with the direct implementation of \u00a0Flash in Internet Explorer 10.\n\nWeb standards support appears to be identical in both versions of IE10. The Internet Explorer blog notes\u00a0that the following improvements have been made over previous versions of the browser:\n\nRich Visual Effects: CSS Text Shadow, CSS 3D Transforms, CSS3 Transitions and Animations, CSS3 Gradient, SVG Filter Effects\n\nSophisticated Page Layouts: CSS3 for publication quality page layouts and application UI (CSS3 grid, flexbox, multi-column, positioned floats, regions, and hyphenation), HTML5 Forms, input controls, and validation\n\nEnhanced Web Programming Model: Better offline applications through local storage with IndexedDB and the HTML5 Application Cache; Web Sockets, HTML5 History, Async scripts, HTML5 File APIs, HTML5 Drag-drop, HTML5 Sandboxing, Web workers, ES5 Strict mode support.\n\nThe browser scores 320 and 6 points in the HTML5test, an indicator of how well browsers support the HTML5 standard. That's an increase of more than 200 points over Internet Explorer 9. IE10 is still trailing behind other browsers in the test. Google Chrome 23 for instance scores 448 + 13 points in the test, and Firefox 16 372 and 10.\n\nInternet Explorer 10 is the first browser that ships with Do Not Track enabled by default. The feature informs websites and services the browser connects to that users do not want to be tracked. The default nature of the feature in IE10 has been controversially discussed as the Do No Track specification requires users to make the decision.\u00a0Yahoo as a consequence announced that it would ignore Internet Explorer 10's Do Not Track header.\n\nIE10 on Windows 7 may run faster than comparable web browsers in select benchmarks. Microsoft claims for instance that Internet Explorer 10 is two times as fast as Google Chrome 23 and 20 percent faster than Firefox 16 in the Mandelbrot benchmark available on Microsoft's Test Drive website.\n\nThe browser does not perform as well in other benchmarks. Its score of 5134 in Google's Octane benchmark is beaten by Firefox 19's 9031, and Google Chrome 23's 12975. Mozilla's Kraken benchmark paints a similar picture. Firefox and Google Chrome need roughly the same execution time of around 2200ms, while Internet Explorer 10 three times at much with 6800ms.\n\nIE10 performs better when running applications and demos on Microsoft's Internet Explorer Test Drive site. It is somewhat surprising that Google Chrome usually comes in last in these benchmarks, while Internet Explorer 10 and Firefox finish in close proximity to each other.\n\nClosing Words\n\nMicrosoft released Internet Explorer 10 as a preview version and it should be handled as such. While it is possible to uninstall the browser on the system to revert to the previous version of Internet Explorer, it is not suited for production environments, even though there does not appear to be any -- visible -- difference between the preview version for Windows 7 and the final version on Windows 8.\n\nMicrosoft managed to close a large part of the performance and web standards support gap between previous versions of Internet Explorer and third-party browsers such as Chrome, Firefox or Opera with the release of IE10.\n\nPhoto Credit:\u00a0Annkozar\/Shutterstock\n\n\u00a9 1998-2015 BetaNews, Inc.

        "text":"Microsoft Office 2016 For Windows Is Coming Next Month\n\nAug 26, 2015\n\nMicrosoft is expected to launch the latest edition of Microsoft Office by the end of next month, in a bid to merge all Office software across Windows. In Office 2016, there aren\u2019t many changes as\u00a0compared to already existing features, but there will be big a change in the color theme.\n\nOffice 2016\n\n22\u00a0September Will Be The Likely Release Date\n\nThere have been rumors that the new version of Microsoft Office for Windows\u00a0has certain features identical to its Mac counterpart. Users will now have a new colorful theme to bask under, probably customizable, similar to iOS and Android apps. It is also quite similar to the\u00a0Windows 10 touch-optimized versions of Office and with some similarities to the older versions of Excel, Word and PowerPoint.\n\nMicrosoft said now, you will be \u201cable to pick and attach files on your SharePoint or OneDrive accounts even if they don\u2019t appear in your recent items list.\u201d\n\nThe colorful new theme will most likely attract people who don\u2019t like the dull and dark outlay\u00a0available right now. Basically, Microsoft is improving several things this time around in Outlook 2016 as the company is\u00a0working on email delivery performance, increasing storage, making attachments easier for users, and improving image insertion options in both Word and Excel 2016. The company is\u00a0also refining the results for search as well, which has been the biggest challenge for them until now. A little orientation is required in order to insert images into documents automatically and so fewer number of clicks will be needed in the new version for Windows.\n\noffice 2016\n\nThe official date of its launch is not yet confirmed, but according to different sources, it is possibly launching in September. Right now testing on the final build of Microsoft Office 2016 is under process. According to some reports, the new Microsoft Office suite 2016 would cost around \u20ac140 (\u00a3102), and Office Home and Business 2016 would be around \u20ac240 (\u00a3176). It will be released in 139 countries and approximately in 16 languages around the globe by the month of July.\n\nA page of Office 2016 Launch Hub stated:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll release Office 2016 with updates for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Skype for Business, Project, Visio, Access, and Publisher. The innovation wave continues in Q2 with the release of E5 and Skype for Business, and on-premise servers will follow.\u201d\n\nAs we have more news on this matter, we\u2019ll update our readers immediately. Till then, sit back, relax and mark your calendar for September 22nd.",

        "text":"Home > Social Media > Another third-party Twitter client, Tweetro, is\u2026\n\nAnother third-party Twitter client, Tweetro, is forced to charge its users\n\n\nSince announcing API restrictions, Twitter has required that developers put in a special request should they hit the 100,000 user limit. And third-party app\u00a0Tweetro had a legitimate reason to request additional API tokens after hitting its 100,000 user limit on Windows 8 OS. \u00a0After reaching out to Twitter however, Tweetro hit a brick wall, and the developer\u2019s request was denied.\n\nTweetro, which was the only available Windows 8 Twitter client, quickly become popular after the OS\u2019 release and needed the extended availability. Twitter, for the record, has yet to introduce a native Windows 8 app (it\u2019s obviously available via browers, but there are no apps for download). Tweetro\u2019s popularity, however, was the beginning of its fall from grace. The third-party Twitter client was decisively pulled by Tweetro from the Windows Store until its team could figure out a solution. Twitter responded to Tweetro\u2019s request via email, which Windows Observer republished, that bluntly rejected Tweetro\u2019s request. The email stated:\n\n\u201cAs you know, we discourage developers from building apps that replicate our core user experience (aka \u201cTwitter clients\u201d). We know that there are developers that want to take their passion for Twitter and its ecosystem to unique underserved situations. As such, we have built some flexibility into our policy with regard to user tokens \u2013 which went into effect September 5, 2012.\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear that your service addresses an area that our current or future products do not already serve. As such, it does not qualify for an exemption.\u201d\n\nTweetro was forced to take extreme measures and resort to a pay-to-use business model that will be implemented in the coming weeks. Nonpaying users will be required to pay for the service for continued use, \u00a0and this should reduce the number of users to under the 100,000 token limit. Tweetro has not revealed how much it will cost. Lazyworm Applications, the company responsible for developing Tweetro, and its co-founder Atta Elayyan responded to the controversy with the following statement provided to Windows Observer:\n\n\u201cAs much as we\u2019d love to continue supporting Tweetro as a free app, it simply doesn\u2019t make sense for us under these new restrictions. We hope that people understand our situation and continue showing us their support as we\u2019d love nothing more than to continue delivering the best possible Twitter experience on Windows 8 \u2026 Even if it\u2019s only accessible to a very limited number of people.\u201d\n\nDevelopers reaching the 100,000 token limit are gravitating to the for-pay route, like Tweetbot has done with its Mac client, which costs $20.\n\nIf you pick apart Twitter\u2019s rhetoric, \u201cit does not appear that your service addresses an area that our current or future products do not already serve,\u201d you can probably assume the platform is hinting at its own native Windows 8 app. Until then, anyone wanting to download a free Twitter app for Windows 8 is out of luck.",

It cites security concerns, especially over virus transmissions.\n\nA memo to staff from EDS' security compliance unit leaked to The Register describes \"use of Instant Messenger (IM) products through the Internet\" as a \"risk to Client EDS' infrastructure and network\".\n\nThe company will block access to public Internet instant message sites at its firewalls from tomorrow (May 8).\n\nSecurity staff can make exceptions to the rule but the policy means that from tomorrow EDS staff will be unable to use popular IM products such as AOL, ICQ and Yahoo!\n\nGateway AV tools or managed services providers can be used to block infectious emails before they reach end users, but instant messages go directly to workstations - so skipping a layer of defence.\n\nIM is convenient but it can create holes into an organisation. Instant messaging attacks have become a common method of propagation in recent viral outbreaks, and (as CERT warned back in March) a tool for social engineering, including tricking users into running malicious software (potentially DDoS attack tools) on their machines.\n\nNeil Barrett, technical director of security consultancy firm IRM, said IM products are \"implicitly clandestine\" and make the exchange of files easier - something likely to be frowned on by security-conscious organisations.\n\nEDS is not noted for its lightness of touch with staff - and it hasn't always been so cosy with the UK government. In 1986, the company was found out ordering staff, American nationals, to lie to British immigration officials. The staff were told to say they were coming to the UK on holiday, when in reality, their real purpose was to work. That cost EDS one measly UK government contract - or, to be precise, the chance to bid for one contract. \u00ae\n\nBiting the hand that feeds IT \u00a9 1998\u20132017",

        "text":"Uncategorized \u2014\n\nVerizon wants fat pipes, not a badge; MPAA urges ISP filters\n\nAt the Tech Policy Summit in Los Angeles yesterday, the MPAA pitched its ISP \u2026\n\nAt the Tech Policy Summit in Los Angeles, MPAA CTO Jim Williams called on ISPs to install filters in their pipes, arguing that it was in their own best interest. Furthermore, Williams said that ISPs ought to start filtering content not just to please the movie studios, but for their own bottom lines. Filtering will \"unclog the Internet,\" Williams said, and eliminate \"a bunch of freeriders that are hogging bandwidth.\"\n\nWilliams' comments came in the wake of comments from Verizon CTO Richard Lynch, who admitted that the ISP does use a blacklist to stop access to child porn sites. Williams seized on that point. If Verizon truly isn't willing to police the Internet, why will it blacklist certain sites? Copyright concerns and child porn aren't quite on the same level, but Verizon's willingness to control access to certain kinds of content predictably leads others with content concerns to demand a similar sort of treatment.\n\nWe know this issue is on the minds of copyright owners (see our lengthy chat with NBC Universal's Rick Cotton, for instance), but Williams' remarks illustrate just how high a priority ISP filtering is to the movie business. When asked how he would rewrite the DMCA if he could go back in time and do so, Williams had no hesitation: he would \"like to see some sort of encouragement to ISPs to do something about mass, indiscriminate reproduction of copyrighted works.\"\n\nWilliams stressed that he's not against P2P. The studios love P2P as a technology because of what it could mean for them: a cost-effective method of selling high-def content to consumers without the need to pay for huge bandwidth bills and server farms. But he does argue that \"much of the Internet is being clogged up with stolen goods\" and \"you find that almost all P2P traffic goes away if you turn on copyright filters.\"\n\nA cat-and-mouse game\u00a0\n\nAfter his talk, I asked Williams about issues involved in filtering P2P content, especially with encrypted content. He noted that it was still possible, though because the data is encrypted, the filtering software needs to do extra work (such as joining a BitTorrent swarm in order to gain access to the encryption keys) rather than being able to peer directly at the traffic passing over the wire. Williams did admit, though, that it was a \"cat-and-mouse\" game, one that might spawn a P2P arms race but that could still put a dent in piracy, especially of the casual kind.\n\nFor a hint of how this might play out, we need only consider Canada, where several of the major ISPs throttle P2P traffic. Ashwin Navin, BitTorrent's president, told me that his company has ways to bypass such restrictions but that it's a constant game of tweaking. As BitTorrent makes changes, the ISPs respond, leading BitTorrent to make more changes. We've also seen Vuze in the US adopt encryption of its legitimate P2P downloads in part as a way of avoiding Comcast's upload throttling. Widespread ISP filtering would certainly lead to similar see-saw battles.\n\nVerizon wants no part of such battles, as Lynch reiterated that the ISP remains committed to an open Internet. In addition to throwing open Verizon Wireless' data network to more devices and applications, Lynch stressed yesterday that Verizon has no interest in being a content \"policeman.\"\n\nEducation and personal responsibility\n\nJim Davis, the CIO of UCLA, said that based on what was happening on his campus, the best approach seemed to be a combination of education, personal responsibility, and action against repeat offenders. The school takes its mission to educate its students seriously and it wants to create ethical adults who act out of their own sense of what's right. To that end, UCLA educates incoming students about what is and is not appropriate but has no interest in technological filters running somewhere in its network. It also targets repeat offenders with increasing sanctions.\n\nYouTube's chief counsel, Zahavah Levine, also stressed the need for digital media education. While YouTube does employ audio and video filtering systems, these can flag copyrighted content but can't help educate users about proper behavior. This leads to \"a lot of nasty e-mails from users\" when content is taken down, she said. Some users think that because they bought a CD or DVD, they have the right to upload parts of it to YouTube; others think that the footage they took on a cell phone camera at a concert is theirs to do with as they please and that they can upload band performances.\n\nGood ideas, all of them, but calls for \"education\" are unlikely to be enough for content owners, who see a clear and present danger. Education, whatever its merits, takes time.\n\nYou must to comment.",
