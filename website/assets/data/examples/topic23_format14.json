He began his hotel career over thirty years ago in his native Egypt after completing his college studies at Cairo University. Over the years, he has worked in the Middle East, Europe and the United States.\n\nFollowing his initial academic and property level training, Mr. Saleh spent several years in London where he began his managerial training within the luxury segment. In 1974, he came to the United States, settling in Boston as the Managing Director of The Colonnade hotel. Under his stewardship, The Colonnade became a favorite of both business travelers and international visitors and was welcomed as a member of both Preferred Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and The Leading Hotels of the World.\n\nOne of the first to envision the potential from growing international tourism early in the 1980's, Mr. Saleh led impressive overseas promotional efforts for his property, in cooperation with local industry and governmental marketing interests throughout Europe and the Far East. As a result, The Colonnade soon captured the largest percentage of the inbound foreign visitor market in New England and became known as \"Boston's Grand European Hotel.\"\nMr. Saleh has been honored for his international service to the hospitality industry, as well as his superior performance as a hotelier. His awards include the Preferred Hotels & Resorts Worldwide \u201c2000 Number One Service Award\u201d in North America, the \u201cTop 10 in the World\u201d Service Award in 2001; the \u201c1989 Spirit of Massachusetts International Tourism Leadership Award,\u201d and the \u201cInternational Golden Helm Award.\u201d\nIn 1993, Mr. Saleh acquired the Orchards Hotel in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The Orchards quickly earned the reputation as an intimate, boutique luxury lifestyle hotel which won numerous awards for its exceptional service, elegant ambiance and world-class cuisine. It too, was a member of The Leading Small Hotels of the World and Preferred Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. In addition, the hotel was a perennial winner of both the International Five Star Diamond Award and the AAA Four Diamond Award.\nFor many years, Mr. Saleh served as a board member of Preferred Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, devoting himself to the growth and development of that organization. He was honored by Preferred Hotels & Resorts Worldwide as the \u201c2003 Hotelier of the Year.\u201d\n\nMr. Saleh has served on numerous community, industry and government boards and commissions: President, Boston Skal Club International; Past President, Greater Boston Hotel Association; member of the Board of Directors; Massachusetts Lodging Association, Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau, New England Inns and Resorts Association, Tourism Massachusetts International, and the Roger A.
