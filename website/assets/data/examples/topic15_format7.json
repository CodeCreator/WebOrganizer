In practice, they are often misused. Cp and Pp describe the potential of the process to meet specification if the process is centered. The index compares the tolerance to the range over which 99.73% of the individual values will fall (6\u03c3 for data following a normal distribution). Cp and Pp only differ in the method used to estimate the standard deviation.\n\nSince Cp and Pp are not affected by the process being off center, the Cpk and Ppk were developed to produce indices which include a \"penalty\" for being off center. Again, Cpk and Ppk only differ in the method used to estimate the standard deviation.\n\nIn cases where the process target is not halfway between the upper and lower spec limits, the Cpm is a better alternative to the Cpk since it includes a \"penalty\" for being off target rather than off center.\n\nCommon mistakes when utilizing capability indices include:\n\n\nFailure to Ensure Process Stability\n\nComputing process capability for a process that is out-of-control (e.g. unstable) doesn\u2019t provide any idea of what to expect in the future. Furthermore, process capability implies that a single process exists! Assessing process capability without evidence of stability (using an appropriate control chart) is irrational.\n\n\nFailure to Appropriately Handle Non-Normal Data\n\nBlindly utilizing the typical process capability formulas (for normally distributed data) can lead to incredibly misleading results. Since process capability assessment is performed on individual measurements, care must be taken to check whether an assumption of normality is reasonable. Much (if not most) industrial data does not follow a normal distribution. Several methods (such as data transformations or distribution fitting) for handling non-normal data are readily available in modern software packages.\n\n\nFailure to Quantify Uncertainty in Estimated Capability Indices\n\nCapability indices are computed from sample data which is subject to randomness. While confidence intervals are routinely utilized in many applications of statistical methods (such as reliability estimation), they are routinely ignored in process capability assessment. Simply comparing capability estimates to minimum acceptable levels of process capability (e.g. is Cpk > 1.33?) fails to account for the inherent uncertainty in our estimates. Utilizing appropriate sample sizes is a critical aspect of ensuring adequate precision in any estimates including capability indices.\n\n\nFailure to Understand the Limitations of Capability Indices\n\nWhen assessing process capability, both the process center (e.g mean or median) and the amount of variation (e.g. standard deviation) are important. Identifying a statistic such as Cp or Cpk that summarizes both is impossible. A process that produces only 50% (or 0%) in spec can have the same Cp as one that produces nearly 100% in spec since the Cp is not affected by the process location relative to spec limits. What about Cpk? Consider the two processes below:\n\nBoth of these processes have a Cpk = 1. The top process produces much more consistently. Furthermore, the bottom process will produce twice the proportion of parts that are out-of-spec than the top process will! It should be relatively easy to shift the top process to the right (if this is desired as it may be more cost effective to run near the lower spec limit).\n\nWhile they are widely used to report process capability, the indices described here are often misapplied and misunderstood in practice. Estimating the actual data distribution and the proportion of parts exceeding each specification limit would serve us much better as it avoids the misleading nature of the process capability indices. Most importantly, we should focus on minimizing variation in key characteristics since it is critical to achieving high quality, reliability, and success of manufacturers.

        "text":"A very special synthetic rubber\n\n\nBuna is a synthetic rubber, which is available in a wide range of products today. It was originally used exclusively in the tire industry. The trade name\u00a0\"Buna\" stands for the starting materials butadiene and sodium (Natrium). The first commercial production plant for synthetic rubber started operation in 1937 at I.G. Farbenindustrie's Schkopau facility. In the same year I.G. Farben won a \"Grand Prix\" for development of synthetic rubber at the World Exhibition in Paris.\n\nThe present\u00a0Evonik site - Marl Chemical Park -\u00a0was built specifically for Buna production, which started there in 1940. On May 9, 1938 Chemische Werke H\u00fcls GmbH was founded for this purpose. The majority shareholder, I.G. Farbenindustrie, which had begun developing the process in 1928, supplied the patents for production of synthetic rubber using the arcing process free of charge. In return Chemische Werke H\u00fcls GmbH had to agree to give I.G. Farben access to all further developments in the process technology and sale of Buna products. The raw material acetylene, needed for Buna production, was first obtained\u00a0from the arcing process\u00a0in Marl. Acetylene is required in order to obtain butadiene, which is the main starting material for synthetic rubber.\n\nBuna manufactured in Marl was initially a war product, the historical background being the National Socialist policy of self-sufficiency and the 1936 Four-Year Plan. This was intended to prepare the German economy for wartime production and make it more or less independent of foreign supplies. The Wehrmacht's supply, transport and combat vehicles in particular relied on Buna production, which supplied the necessary raw material for tires and track cushioning.\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War in May 1945, the British administration prohibited Buna production in Marl in 1948. It was not until the early 1950s that production was fully authorized once more as a result of the Korean War, when supplies of natural rubber were jeopardized by the military conflict in the Far East. In 1955, together with Bayer AG, Hoechst AG and BASF AG, H\u00fcls established a subsidiary for the production of Buna, the Bunawerke H\u00fcls GmbH. Subsequently a wider product range developed out of the original Buna production for the tire industry. In the 1990s, H\u00fcls AG finally divested itself of its activities with synthetic rubber.\n\nFurther information",

        "text":"Huckleberry Mine, BC, Canada\n\nMonitoring a Tailings Dam\n\nHuckleberry Mine, BC, Canada:\u00a0Engineers employed several interesting techniques when they instrumented a tailings dam at this gold and copper mine in north-central British Columbia. They grouted-in piezometers, installed inclinometers and piezometers in the same borehole, and implemented a lightning protection scheme that has already proven its value.\n\nThe TMF-2 starter dam is the first in a series of dams that will be constructed for tailings and waste management at Huckleberry mine. The dam will be raised each year for the next five years to reach its final height of 110 meters.\n\nGeotechnical instrumentation installed in the dam included\u00a0inclinometersvw piezometersstandpipe piezometers, and surface survey monuments. The instrumentation will be used throughout the life of the mine, helping engineers assess the performance of the structure, optimize future construction, and detect any geotechnical problems early enough to allow effective remedial actions.\n\nInstallation of Piezometers:\u00a0The VW piezometers are installed in boreholes that are backfilled with a low-permeability, bentonite-cement grout. The grout effectively limits the intake zone for the piezometer, preventing migration of water upwards or downwards through the borehole. This allows several piezometers to be installed in the same borehole, each monitoring a discrete zone.\u00a0Standpipe piezometers, which will be used to monitor water quality as well as pore-water pressure, are installed with the traditional sand intake zone and bentonite seal.\n\nDual-Use Boreholes:\u00a0Engineers installed VW piezometers in the same boreholes used for inclinometers. The bentonite-cement grout provides a dimensionally stable backfill for the inclinometer casing and discrete zones for the piezometers. Eventually, there will be three VW piezometers installed with each inclinometer.\n\nLightning Protection:\u00a0Signal cables from the piezometers are extended vertically along the axis of an established instrumentation borehole or laterally in a trench leading to a readout location at an abutment. Since vulnerability to lightning damage increases with cable length, some form of lightning protection was required.\n\nSlope Indicator proposed a two-tier lighting protection system, based on recommendations proposed in its publication:\u00a0Sensors in the Real World. The first tier of protection is a lightning diversion system, comprising one or more lightning rods connected to bare, heavy-gauge, low- impedance, copper wire that directs the transient voltage away from the instrument zone.\n\nThe second tier is an equipotential grounding system. It comprises bare, heavy-gauge, low-impedance, copper wires that run parallel to each signal cable and extend about 2 meters deeper than each sensor. Spacers were used to keep the wires about 10 cm from the signal cables, as shown in the photo at right. The low-impedance wires keep electric potentials the same at either end of the signal cables, thus minimizing destructive current flow and eliminating damage to sensors and signal cable.\n\nThe protection system was put to the test when an electrical storm hit the mine a few months after the instruments were installed. The storm severely damaged the mine's telephone system, which took nearly a month to restore, but all of the piezometers survived.\n\nThanks to Slope Indicator Canada for providing this story.",

Most protein feeds of plant origin consist of processed oilseeds. Millings by-products generally make up the remainder of the plant protein feeds.

Even within the same plant, there is considerable variation from one stage of maturity to another or from one part of the plant \u00a0\u00a0to another.

Because it lacks power and adequate transportation, Chad is industrially one of the least developed countries in Africa. Cotton processing is the largest activity. Cottonseed oil is processed at Sarh and Moundou. Coton-Tchad, the state-owned company that produces and exports cotton, is the country's main manufacturing concern, and many of its subsidiary operations (including oil and soap) were being privatized in 2002.\n\nOther enterprises include several modern slaughterhouses, a flour mill complex, a sugar refinery, and textile plants. There are also rice and peanut oil mills, a brewery, a soft-drink plant, a soap factory, and a cigarette factory. Factories at N'Djamena also produce bicycles and mopeds, radios, and perfume.\n\nThe construction sector was growing in 2002, with investment in roads and schools, among other public works projects. There was interest in building a cement factory in the Mayo Kebbi region in 2002, and plans to produce detergent and establish assembly plants for agricultural equipment. If electrical costs could be reduced, light industry could be further developed.\n\nOil exploration in Chad began in the 1970s in the northern Lake Chad Basin and the Doba Basin in southern Chad. Chad's full hydrocarbon potential has yet to be fully determined. The Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, with estimated production at 225,000 barrels per day, was due to be completed in 2004. There were plans in 2002 to build a refinery in N'Djamena, to make Chad self-sufficient in oil products. The development of Chad's petroleum sector is aimed in part at raising electricity output, which is crucial to Chadian industry. Only 2% of households in Chad are supplied with electricity.\n\nAlso read article about Chad from Wikipedia\n\nUser Contributions:\n\nReport this comment as inappropriate\nNov 4, 2010 @ 7:19 pm\nreally good information i wish it could be not as much information but its still interresting\n\nComment about this article, ask questions, or add new information about this topic:",

        "text":"Washdown gear reducer choice can improve uptime\n\nChoosing a gear reducer that offers performance and can withstand the harsh chemicals and high-pressure washdown required in a food or beverage plant can be a real challenge.\n\n\nNo plant can afford to have processing lines shut down when inspectors find corrosion or other damage that can result from the cleaning process.\n\nUnderstanding the advanced features now available in washdown-capable gear reducers will help you select the most durable product.\n\nHousing materials\n\nMost washdown gear products are offered with either a cast iron housing covered with an anti-corrosion coating, or stainless steel housing. Although aluminum is thought to be a noncorroding material, when sprayed with harsh chemicals, the aluminum will quickly corrode and fail.\n\nOverall, a coated cast iron housing is the most cost-effective housing option. The cast iron housing is typically the same as used in the standard product line so costs are low due to high volumes. However, the type of anticorrosion coating, and how it is applied, makes a large difference in product performance at the customer\u2019s site.\n\nGears are subjected to a salt-fog bath as part of the testing process.It\u2019s critical you choose a washdown product from a manufacturer that uses a salt-fog chamber to run corrosion tests. The salt-fog chamber is the most consistent method available to compare the performance of different coatings under the same highly corrosive conditions. Trying new coatings at customer sites may lead to a coating that works well under some conditions, but not in others.\n\nThe highest performance coating system currently available consists of two coats of epoxy-based paint applied to the cast iron housing. Epoxy paint has superior adhesion, is highly durable, and offers very high corrosion protection to the base material. Although powder-coated products have an attractive high gloss, salt-fog testing has shown that powder coating does not provide the same level of corrosion protection as the two-part epoxy paint system. Some gear reducers include a clear third layer, but it primarily functions to add gloss for visual enhancement.\n\nFor optimal corrosion resistance, look for products that use electrodeposition to apply the first coat of epoxy paint to the bare housing. In the electrodeposition process, a multistep cleaning process is used first to ensure that all foreign material is completely removed from the surfaces being coated.\n\nAfter cleaning, the part is submerged into a large container of epoxy paint. An electric charge is then applied, which attracts the paint particles into the smallest crevices of the part\u2019s surfaces. The part is then baked to quickly and fully cure the paint. The resulting paint film is very uniform in thickness, extremely durable, and superior to a primer that is applied via a spray system.\n\nAfter the gear reducer is assembled, it is then completely covered in another layer of two-part epoxy paint that increases the overall paint film thickness to improve the corrosion resistance. A cast iron housing that has been coated with two layers of epoxy paint, with the primer applied using the electrodeposition process, has a better chance of withstanding the harsh cleaning processes required in the food industry.\n\nHowever, stainless steel housings provide the ultimate in water and chemical resistance. Since no coating is applied to the housing, the coating cannot be chipped off or inadvertently damaged through the use of very high-pressure water. The downside to the stainless housings is the high cost. Despite the cost, stainless housings should be selected when damage to the paint film cannot be tolerated in a particular food production process.\n\n\nWhether the housing is cast iron with epoxy coatings or stainless steel, look for a pressure\u2011relief type of vent if the reducer is vented. A standard open vent, even if equipped with chemicals to absorb moisture, will ultimately allow moisture to enter the reducer, resulting in premature failure.\n\nA gasket or O-ring should also be present between the gear reducer and motor to keep water and moisture out of the cavity between the two products.\n\n\nTo properly lubricate the gear reducer and avoid contaminating food product, lubricants should have NSF H1 (incidental contact) rating. Reducers using NSF H2 (no contact) lubricant offer no advantage and should not be considered an approved product for incidental food contact.\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the lowest cost components of a gear reducer, which nevertheless serves a critical function, is the shaft seal. Shaft seals in non-washdown gear reducers seal the lubricant in the reducer and keep dirt and other solid contaminants out. In a washdown application, the shaft seal must still keep the lubricant in the reducer, but it must also keep out water and chemicals being used to clean the exterior of the reducer. If the seal allows water into the reducer, the internal components will rust and the lubricant will break down. Ultimately, the gear reducer will prematurely fail from a combination of these two conditions.\n\nThe importance of the right gear reducer in a food processing plant can be seen in the gear\u2019s proximity to a chocolate chip cookie batch.A standard lip seal used in a non-washdown application typically has a rubber sealing lip that rides on the rotating shaft surface. There may also be a noncontacting dirt excluder lip that is used to keep large particles away from the sealing lip. The sealing lip is commonly held against the shaft with a small spring around the circumference of the lip. When exposed to high velocity, or high-pressure water and chemicals, the sealing lip will lift off the shaft and allow water and chemicals into the reducer. Even if multiple standard lip seals are stacked side by side, the sealing lips will lift off the shaft and allow water and chemicals to get inside the reducer.\n\nTo avoid these issues, look for enhanced shaft sealing systems that consist of specialty seals designed to keep the water and chemicals out. Commonly referred to as harsh duty seals, the seal construction is modified to provide a positive method for keeping the water spray from the sealing lip.\n\nA harsh duty seal consists of two parts: the normal outer case with sealing lip and a separate inner sleeve and flange. The inner sleeve has a rubber coating to seal tightly against the shaft, and an external flange to keep water from getting to the oil sealing lip. Between the flange OD and the oil sealing lip, there are multiple other lips designed to keep water and other contaminants away from the oil sealing lip.\n\nSome gear reducers come with a rubber v\u2011ring combined with a standard lip seal to cut costs. This combined sealing system does not typically provide the same level of protection as a true harsh duty seal.\n\nWorking in combination with harsh duty seals are corrosion-resistant output shafts. Look for output shafts that are either stainless steel or carbon steel plated, with a high-performance coating such as nickel plating. Both types perform well in washdown applications. Sealing out water and chemicals is vital to the life of the gear reducer.\n\nThe type of housing, venting, lubrication, and shaft seal are all critical components of a washdown capable gear reducer, and these features should be carefully evaluated before selecting a gear reducer for a food industry application.\u00a0\n\nRussell is Baldor's senior principal engineer for Dodge gearing.\u00a0\n\nNo comments\nThe Engineers' Choice Awards highlight some of the best new control, instrumentation and automation products as chosen by...\nThe System Integrator Giants program lists the top 100 system integrators among companies listed in CFE Media's Global System Integrator Database.\nThe Engineering Leaders Under 40 program identifies and gives recognition to young engineers who...\nThis eGuide illustrates solutions, applications and benefits of machine vision systems.\nLearn how to increase device reliability in harsh environments and decrease unplanned system downtime.\nThis eGuide contains a series of articles and videos that considers theoretical and practical; immediate needs and a look into the future.\nRobotic safety, collaboration, standards; DCS migration tips; IT\/OT convergence; 2017 Control Engineering Salary and Career Survey\nIntegrated mobility; Artificial intelligence; Predictive motion control; Sensors and control system inputs; Asset Management; Cybersecurity\nBig Data and IIoT value; Monitoring Big Data; Robotics safety standards and programming; Learning about PID\nFeatured articles highlight technologies that enable the Industrial Internet of Things, IIoT-related products and strategies to get data more easily to the user.\nThis article collection contains several articles on how automation and controls are helping human-machine interface (HMI) hardware and software advance.\nThis digital report will explore several aspects of how IIoT will transform manufacturing in the coming years.\n\nFind and connect with the most suitable service provider for your unique application.

        "text":"The District's Distribution System\n\nThe Goleta Water District delivers quality water to 87,000 customers throughout the Goleta Valley.\u00a0 Over the past 75 years, the District has invested millions of dollars to build, sustain, and improve its distribution system, which delivers that water from Lake Cachuma, the State Water Project, the Goleta Groundwater Basin, and the recycled water system.\u00a0\n\nHow does the potable distribution system work?\n\nThe District\u2019s distribution system consists of 270 miles of pipeline, 8 water storage reservoirs, 6\u00a0pump stations, 9 groundwater production wells, 6,500 valves, and 17,200 service connections.\u00a0 In addition, the District maintains 1,550 fire hydrants throughout the community.\n\nWater flows downhill from Lake Cachuma into the Tecolote Tunnel and on to the South Coast Conduit.\u00a0 This conduit then feeds the Corona Del Mar Water Treatment Plant where water is treated at a rate of up to 24-million-gallons-per day.\u00a0 Treated water then enters two large transmission mains, which run downhill through a series of smaller pipes that branch out to fill the District storage reservoirs and reach all areas of the District\u2019s service territory.\u00a0 In this sense the District\u2019s distribution system resembles the human arterial system, with several major arteries feeding into smaller capillaries. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nEach Goleta Water District customer is connected to the distribution system through a service line that supplies water through a meter located at the customer\u2019s property.\u00a0 Meters track the usage for billing purposes and are also helpful to detect leaks on the customer\u2019s property.\n\nThough the system is largely gravity based with 98% of the water being delivered downhill, the District also relies on\u00a06 pump stations to serve customers at higher elevations and to move water from the District\u2019s groundwater production wells.\u00a0 These pumping facilities range up to 2,500 gallons per minute and are located throughout the distribution system.\u00a0 Pumps use electric energy to push water against gravity from low to high elevations with a series of impellers, motors, and valve components.\u00a0 These mechanical systems are operated and maintained at an annual cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nHow does the District maintain pressure in the system?\n\nThere are 8 water storage reservoirs located at higher elevations throughout the distribution system.\u00a0 These reservoirs are large tanks that supply the District\u2019s pressure zones and balance supply and demand from day to day.\u00a0 Tank storage also provides a back-up supply of water for community fire-fighting needs and enough water to offset short duration supply outages.\n\nGoleta Water District\u2019s potable water system is unique in that it is over 98% gravity-fed.\u00a0 System pressures are maintained at various elevations through a series of pressure reducing valves located throughout the distribution system.\u00a0 A network of line valves also allow distribution operators to control and isolate portions of the distribution system during emergency repairs and scheduled maintenance.\u00a0 These valves also reduce the number of customers affected by service outages.\u00a0 Finally, the distribution system also includes a hydro-kinetic turbine that generates electricity, which offsets District power costs.\n\nWhat future challenges does the District anticipate?\n\nWater utilities across California and the nation are dealing with rising costs to replace infrastructure.\u00a0 The District recently celebrated its 75th anniversary, and nearly 71% of the District\u2019s pipes are older than 50 years.\u00a0 Due to wear, corrosion, and age the District currently spends approximately four hundred thousand dollars per year on emergency repairs and main breaks.\u00a0 The approximate cost of pipe replacement can range from one to three million dollars per mile.\u00a0 Because full infrastructure replacement is financially infeasible, prudent capital planning to target the most critical replacements is essential to sustaining the system moving forward.\n\nAs we look to the future, continued distribution system maintenance, enhancement and replacement will ensure the long term viability of quality water delivery to customers in the Goleta Valley.\u00a0\n\n(Published January 22, 2020)",

        "text":"What are the Advantages & Disadvantages of a Conventional Concrete Slab Vs. a Post Tension Slab?\n\nPost-tension concrete is a method of reinforcing concrete. This concrete has cable conduits cast into it and that cable is stretched, or tensioned, hydraulically after the concrete has hardened. The tension is transferred to the concrete, helping hold it together even better. Post-tensioning provides high strength and stability, but looks just like any other concrete slab. While most home projects don't require post-tensioning, it could still be a useful technique for some builders.\n\nPost-tensioned concrete is usually used in large structures.\n\n\nPost-tensioned concrete is stronger and more flexible than conventional steel-reinforced concrete. According to the Concrete Network, post-tensioning helps reduce cracking from shrinkage as the concrete dries, and holds together any cracks that do form. Post-tensioning is commonly used in large commercial and industrial projects such as garages and towers.\n\n\nConventional concrete slabs are limited in length and thickness. They require a specific level of thickness to maintain their strength \u2013 usually at least 4 inches for a slab-on-grade foundation. Long concrete slabs elevated above the ground are limited in length due to the danger of cracking. Post-tensioned concrete can be thinner and longer without risk to its strength or structural integrity, since the cables inside help stabilize it.\n\n\nPost-tensioned concrete will usually be more expensive for the home builder, due to the extra equipment needed. However, in large structures, post-tensioning can actually be less costly than conventional concrete slabs. According to the Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce, this is due to the relatively high cost of structural steel, such as rebar. Post-tensioning uses less reinforcing material, allowing it to cost less in large projects.\n\n\nOrdinary concrete slabs require a lot less skill and expertise to pour. Much of the time, you can complete at least part of the work on your own. Pouring post-tensioned concrete is nearly impossible if you're not a professional concrete worker, however, and is best left to experts. Since this material is rarely used in homes, local contractors may not be familiar with it.",

        "text":"Trona is a sodium carbonate compound that is processed into soda ash or bicarbonate of soda, or baking soda, as it is commonly known. Wyoming has the world\u2019s largest deposit of trona, supplying about 90% of the nation\u2019s soda ash. This mineral is Wyoming\u2019s top export and is shipped to markets around the globe. \u00a0Wyoming mines produced over 17.4 million tons of trona and\u00a0employed 2,225 people in 2018.\n\n2018 Wyoming Trona Production and Employment\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey in 1997 estimated the total reserve of trona to be 127 billion tons, but only 40 billion tons are recoverable. \u00a0At the current rate of operation, Wyoming\u2019s reserves of trona will last 2,350 years. \u00a0According to the Wyoming Geological Survey, Wyoming mines have produced over 633.2 million tons of trona since 1949.\n\nGlass making consumes about half of the soda ash, followed by the chemical industry, which uses about a quarter of the output. Other uses include soap, paper manufacturing, and water treatment, and all baking soda comes from soda ash, which means you probably have a box of Wyoming trona product in your kitchen.\n\n\nTrona Processing\n\nThe trona ore is sent to processing facilities, where it is crushed, heated, and refined.\n\nThe deposition of trona in Wyoming started about 50-60 million years ago during the Eocene Age in the Wilkins Peak Member of the Green River Formation. A large freshwater lake, Lake Gosiute, covered an estimated 15,000 square miles in a basin in southwestern Wyoming. The lake was fairly shallow and evaporated rapidly and repeatedly creating a climate that changed back and forth between humid and arid, trapping the once abundant life.\n\nAll the minerals and mud settled in the bottom of the lake and sodium, alkaline and bicarbonate, were transported to the lake by runoff water. The mixture of all these elements formed the trona deposits we mine today.\n\nLarge trona deposits are found in the Green River formation with 42 beds that cover about 1,300 square miles.\n\nTrona Facts\n\n  \u2022 18.1 million tons of trona mined in 2019.\n  \u2022 2,311 \u2013 Employees in 2019.\n  \u2022 The Federal Reserve Board uses soda ash as a national economic indicator.\n  \u2022 5,000 years ago the Egyptians used soda ash for making glass ornaments and vessels.\n  \u2022 Trona is Wyoming\u2019s top international export.\n  \u2022 At the current rate of operation, Wyoming\u2019s trona reserves will last over 2,000 years.\n\nMining & Processing\n\nAll trona is mined underground and then processed into soda ash or baking soda. An underground trona mine is like an underground city. There are maintenance shops, bathrooms, electricity lines, and streets.\n\nMost trona is mined through a room-and-pillar system where a series of parallel drifts are driven. Connections are made between the drifts at regular intervals, which creates a checkerboard pattern of rooms and pillars. The pillars are left to support the overlying rock, and the mineral is then cut from the mining face and processed.\n\nThe purification process begins with crushing the ore, which is then heated to drive off unwanted gases. This transforms the trona into a sodium carbonate. Water is added to this substance, which is then filtered to remove impurities. The water is evaporated and the resulting slurry is placed into a centrifuge to separate the remaining water from the soda ash crystals. The crystals are then sent to driers, screened, and sent to storage bins for transport.\n\n\nBaking SodaIn the 1st century, the Romans used soda ash for making bread, glass, and medicine, uses which continue today.\n\nBaking soda and baking powder both come from soda ash, so most Americans have a product of Wyoming trona right in their own kitchens. These two common household substances are important ingredients for making bread, cookies, cakes, and other baked foods. You eat this Wyoming rock every time you bite into a sandwich, peanut butter cookie, or chocolate cake.\n\nGlassSoda ash is also used to manufacture many chemicals used in industry including sodium bicarbonate, sodium chromates, sodium phosphates, sodium silicates, and sodium cyanide. It can also be added to adjust the pH of water and reduce acidity.\n\nCattle feed, swimming pool products, medicines, paper, textiles, and toothpaste all use soda ash.",
