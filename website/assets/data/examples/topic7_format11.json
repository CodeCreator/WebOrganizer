None of their business\n\n06\/25\/2013 6:13 PM\n\n06\/25\/2013 6:13 PM\n\nDEAR MISS MANNERS: I am extremely lucky to have parents who are able to pay for college for me. I don\u2019t qualify for or need any financial aid.\n\nI\u2019ve been in a few situations where people start giving me advice on how to get financial aid. What is the best way to respond? I usually smile and say, \u201cThanks, but my parents can pay for my college,\u201d and then they usually say, \u201cOh.\u201d It\u2019s a bit awkward, and I feel like a spoiled brat. Is there a better way to handle this situation?\n\n\nHow about: \u201cYes, we know how tough it is. That\u2019s why my family endows scholarships for those less fortunate than we are.\u201d\n\nNo, Miss Manners supposes not. Not even if it were true \u2014 and unlike your helpful acquaintances, she does not make assumptions about other people\u2019s finances.\n\nJust say, \u201cThank you, but that\u2019s taken care of.\u201d Should anyone be so rude as to ask how, the answer is, \u201cWe\u2019ve made arrangements.\u201d\n\nGenerosity in peril\n\nDEAR MISS MANNERS: We live in a small town where many people know almost everyone else. In the past two years, fundraisers have been held for a child with a brain tumor, two women with cancer and a young mother who was seriously injured in an auto crash. All but one of the individuals survived.\n\nResponse to the fundraisers was exceptional. We made donations directly to the individuals.\n\nNone of the individuals or their family or friends who sponsored the fundraisers acknowledged our gift or the personal note we included with each donation, two of which were substantial. Are we expecting too much, or is this the new norm for manners?\n\n\nIf it is, it will soon be the end of such generosity as you and your fellow townspeople have expressed. Generosity and gratitude are inseparably linked.\n\nMiss Manners knows to expect two dissenting reactions to that statement:\n\nOne is the standard defense by youngsters who haven\u2019t thanked their grandmothers for sending them checks \u2014 that Grandma must be really selfish to expect any return, rather than doing it for the pure love of giving. This is a bit like saying that it isn\u2019t true love if you care about being loved in return.\n\nThe other defense is that people in the midst of tragedy are excused from being grateful. But that is exactly when you find out who the compassionate and generous people are. Are those really the people you want to blow off?\n\nThe 15-minute rule\n\nDEAR MISS MANNERS: When one just \u201cdrops in,\u201d what is an acceptable time to stay?\n\n\nThe rule, when people routinely paid unannounced visits on one another, was 15 minutes. A gentleman was not supposed to give up his hat, but park it next to himself as proof that he wouldn\u2019t be a serious disruption to any plans his host may have.\n\nBut, as Miss Manners recalls, that was before the invention of the telephone, which miraculously allowed would-be visitors to inquire first about the host\u2019s convenience. If they fail to use it, she considers that the 15-minute rule still applies.\n\n\u00a9 Universal Uclick 6\/25\n\n\nJoin the discussion\n\nis pleased to provide this opportunity to share information, experiences and observations about what's in the news.

        "text":"Opinion: Get connected\n\nby Cougar News Contributor 0\n\nBy Valerie Traba\n\nSocial media is a phenomenon that continues to transform the way the world functions. The methods that people now use to interact with others have shaped society in a myriad of ways. Negotiating business, interacting with friends and family, advertising, learning, and gossiping are just a few of these processes.\n\nBecause people now form, maintain, and sever ties with one another on the web, the ways the world operates\u2014in comparison to how it did when face-to-face communication was still the norm\u2014has changed. However, this change is an improvement overall. Because of the benefits that have emerged as a result of social media\u2014broad audiences can be reached quickly more efficiently, life moments and memories can be uploaded and shared securely, communicating with people is more affordable, instant access to information can make people more knowledgeable\u2014it fundamentally is a good service to society.\n\nSocial media gives people the convenience to reach a broad audience in a fast and more efficient way. Because messages are posted instantly and are readily available to everyone online, the one who posts the content does not have to contribute as much effort as one would in a face-to-face exchange.\n\nThis facilitates voluntary responses from a wider range of people who could give better, more useful information than those from a small group. The guesswork of having to research solutions independently is taken out of the equation when others are given the opportunity to offer assistance.\n\nPeople are able to store memories and share life moments securely with others through the use of social media. With the click of a button, a proud parent can upload the footage of their child\u2019s first steps onto his\/her online profile and share it with the people in that given network. A benefit to saving content on the web is the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if the primary source is lost; the same version is still available online. The process of sharing experiences online, according to Laura Fitton, allows one to self reflect on their own lives.\n\u201cPerhaps the person you see most clearly is yourself\u201d, Thompson said.\u00a0 This self-examination is an example of how social media can be meaningful; good for society.\n\u00a0Social media has made communication much more affordable. People can enjoy the amenities of communicating with their friends and loved ones without paying the steep prices of international data and calling plans. Social media allows people to communicate through online calling, video chatting, and instant messaging in a way that, according to Clive Thompson, is \u201cfelt even more intimate than a phone call\u201d.\nBecause the social networking sites have features that enable private conversation, messaging, individuals are attracted to the idea of being in a place where they can communicate privately with another person.\nSocial media encourages people to become informed of the happenings in the world and helps them form opinions on them. This is precisely why sites like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have live news feeds that are constantly supplying the latest information for users to digest, and features that allow people to like, dislike, and respond to the content.\nAccording to Steven Johnson, author of the article, \u201cHow Twitter Will Change the Way We Live\u201d, \u201cThe most fascinating thing about Twitter is not what it is doing to us, but\u00a0 as Johnson explains what we\u2019re doing to it. Johnson is illustrating how it is the users\u2019 reactions that not only keep social media alive, but cause it to evolve.\nThere is no doubt that social media has succeeded in certain areas such as connecting people from all over the world and simplifying the ways in which society operates. However, it is not a perfect system, and many people suffer the consequences of misusing social media, both intentionally and unintentionally. Even though the intention of social media is to make networking run more efficiently, sometimes quantity compromises quality. It is this reason why people, especially college students, should use social media wisely and in moderation.\nAs exciting\u2013and in many ways welcoming\u2014as social media is, college students must strive to practice serious reflection without making a blog post, facebook status, or tweet that shows the world how they feel; because, although these means of sharing allow one to \u201csee\u201d themselves, it detracts them from experiencing the authenticity of being alone. Social media is a remarkable aspect of society, and when it is used properly and respectfully, it has the power to make amazing things happen.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.\n\nYou may use these HTML tags and attributes: <a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <s> <strike> <strong>",

        "text":"High 85\u00b0 \/ Low 63\u00b0\nChance of a Thunderstorm\nHigh 68\u00b0 \/ Low 46\u00b0\nVillage Life\n\nExhausted but very happy after Gabriella Kibblewhite\u2019s memorable birth are, in front, Jalana Lazar; in back, Naysan McIlhargey; Lee Kibblewhite holding daughter Lily; Molly Lunde holding her new baby; Aimee Maruyama and Miranda Lloyd.\n\nTidings of joy, babe born in stable van\n\nLast Thursday Jalana Lazar and her husband, Naysan McIlhargey, had not been home long when the phone rang. They had just spent the evening with long-time friends Molly Lunde and her husband, Lee Kibblewhite, Molly\u2019s sister, Aimee Maruyama, and Molly\u2019s childhood pal, Miranda Lloyd (a former Yellow Springs resident visiting from New York). Molly, pregnant with her second child, was planning to deliver at Miami Valley Hospital on New Year\u2019s Day, two weeks away. Two and a half years ago, she had experienced a long and difficult delivery with her firstborn, Lily, and was understandably anxious about repeating that ordeal.\n\nTo ease her friend\u2019s troubled mind, Jalana, a nurse midwife at Good Samaritan Hospital, reassured Molly that if she ever felt it was time to deliver, Jalana would come over and check to see that it was, indeed, time to go. \u201cCall me if you need me,\u201d said Jalana to Molly as she left the gathering.\n\nAn hour later, at midnight, the phone call came. Jalana immediately drove back to Molly\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing such a good job!\u201d Jalana said to Molly after examining her, using an ultra-calm and soothing voice that belied the urgency of the situation. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so well that we need to go the hospital right now and I\u2019m going to come with you just in case you need help on the way.\u201d\n\n(Sitting in their Miami Valley Pottery showroom the following day, owners Jalana and Naysan were much more relaxed and unhurried, retelling the story of that \u201choly smokes!\u201d night.)\n\nAfter her proclamation, Jalana, Molly and Lee quickly got into Molly and Lee\u2019s minivan (Molly getting in the back seat) while support team Aimee and Miranda followed behind in another car. The two vehicles didn\u2019t get very far. Halfway down Hyde Road at State Route 235, Jalana called Aimee on her cell phone. The caravan needed to turn around immediately and go to Jalana and Naysan\u2019s house, which they had just passed. Then Jalana told Aimee to call 911.\n\n\u201cIt must have been a hilarious call,\u201d said Aimee the next day, trying to remember what she possibly might have told the police. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the address of where we were going. I knew almost nothing about what we were doing. I said we were on our way to Miami Valley Pottery and we weren\u2019t going to make it to the hospital.\u201d\n\nAs the two cars pulled into the pottery driveway, the baby was crowning.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I heard was screaming that sounded like a cat,\u201d said Naysan, who had been blissfully asleep up until this point. \u201cI thought the cat was being stepped on.\u201d\n\nWhile Aimee ran into the house frantically searching for blankets and sheets for her sister, Naysan realized what was happening, got out of bed, and helped gather towels. The \u201ccat\u201d sound he heard was his friend, Molly, screaming in second-stage labor in a minivan parked in his driveway while his wife, Jalana, focused on trying to make her comfortable.\n\n\u201cAt some point Molly said, \u2018I am not having this baby in the back of the minivan!\u2019\u201d Jalana explained, \u201cand I just said, very calmly, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s okay,\u2019 because at that point it was very clear that we were having a baby in the back of the minivan.\u201d\n\nAs Aimee squeezed back in the van, stationing herself behind Molly to help lift and support, Jalana positioned herself half inside the van, her other half sticking out the side of the van with the sliding door open. Meanwhile, Miranda-from-New-York coached from the front seat while documenting the event with her camera.\n\nThe two men worked in tandem as a kind of abbreviated bucket brigade: the women calling out for certain items \u2014 hot water, blankets, towels \u2014 and the men retrieving the appropriate items from the house.\n\n\u201cIt was like being in a movie,\u201d recalled Lee afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s that classic line of \u2018We need hot water and towels!\u2019 \u2018Right! Okay!\u2019 So I ran in the house and Naysan is there, half-naked with a sheet pulled around him. \u2018We need hot water and towels!\u2019 I told him and he said, \u2018Right! Okay!\u2019 One-handedly he\u2019s holding this bedsheet around him, getting hot water and towels and passing me things like napkins and Jalana\u2019s sweater \u2014 things that were totally inappropriate. He saw the sweater and said, \u2018Oh no, we can\u2019t take that.\u2019 So he took that back. It was like this blur. In my mind I thought, \u2018This is like in a movie. This is what the father figure does.\u2019 I was in that movie scene and didn\u2019t know how to make hot water. It\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m a trained chef for God\u2019s sake and I couldn\u2019t make hot water!\u201d\n\nEpic-like imagery began to take shape: womenfolk huddled together in an emergency makeshift delivery room, cramped and unsuitable for the birth of a baby; mother and father unprepared for such a blessed event to take place under such strange circumstances. All were bathed in a mythical glow from the interior light of the Honda Odyssey minivan.\n\nThe stars in the sky looked down where they worked. The frost was cruel (along with the sleet). Two cats kept watch over their flocks of mice, birds, and other wildlife where Miami Valley Pottery shop and house lay. Sirens in the distance signaled the impending arrival of the Greene County Sheriff and three Miami Township Fire Rescue ambulances -\u2014 wise men and women (EMTs) who traversed afar, bearing emergency medical supplies.\n\nFortunately, Molly, although in excruciating pain, was not filled with mighty dread.\n\n\u201cI felt so comfortable because of the way that Jalana eased the situation with her words,\u201d said Molly after the shock had worn off. \u201cShe spoke so calmly, not a hint of panic, and I knew everything was going to be alright. I\u2019ll always remember her voice.\u201d\n\nAt 12:53 a.m. on Friday, Dec. 19, 2008, Gabriella Kibblewhite was born and placed on Molly\u2019s chest, where she laid her sweet head.\n\nWhile they all waited for the squad to arrive, shepherd\/potter Naysan served tea.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such the host,\u201d said Lee of his friend, grateful for the support he provided. \u201cGabriella was not born long and Naysan turns up. Finally he\u2019s got clothes on and he\u2019s got mint tea in one of his own teapots, and asks Molly if she\u2019d like a cup. Then he brought out a bowl of grapes.\u201d\n\nAll was calm, all was bright.\n\nWhile the babe was wrapped in swaddling towels and the group wrapped their collective head around what had just happened, the sheriff and EMTs arrived. Lee cut the umbilical cord, then he and Molly and the baby were transferred to an ambulance and taken to Miami Valley Hospital. Aimee stayed with them in the hospital, snuggling in love\u2019s pure light with her sister, brother-in-law, and new niece while Miranda stayed behind to shepherd their other child, Lily. Treasures of Gold Rush apples, cranberry cookies, and grapes from Naysan sustained them through their stay.\n\nLater, when they looked at their cell phone log, Molly and Lee were shocked to see the timing of events. \u201cWhen we decided we were going to turn around we called 911,\u201d said Molly, \u201cand 13 minutes later Gabriella was born.\u201d\n\nMother and child, tender and mild, were released from the hospital the next day while Lee checked in on their store, Asanda Imports, which had just moved into its new downtown location and was being tended to by Miranda.\n\n\u201cThe smile has not left my face,\u201d said Molly. Gabriella, who laid to rest on Molly\u2019s lap, was sleeping. \u201cI know that Jalana and Naysan will forever have a huge place in my heart. I\u2019ve known them quite a long time and there\u2019s a connection between our families. But it\u2019s even more strengthened now. We owe them a lovely set of towels. Almost all of them from their house!\u201d\n\nThe family and shepherds returned to their lives, telling all of the things they had heard and seen. And all who heard it were amazed.\n\nTopics: ,\n\nNo comments yet for this article.\n\nPlease complete to show you\u2019re a human: * Time limit is exhausted. Please reload CAPTCHA.",

        "text":"\u2018They want to be stimulated throughout the body\u2019: Bali Gigolos share their secrets\n\nBALI\u2019S beaches are renowned for their male gigolos - the ultimate \u201csexperts\u201d. They know some important things Australian men apparently don\u2019t.\n\nLuke Williams\nnews.com.auMay 8, 20173:34pm\n\nAmid the tourists and rubbish on Kuta beach, you\u2019ll find so called \u2018beach boys\u2019, catering to the needs of female visitors. Picture: AFP Photo \/ Sonny TumbelakaSource:AFP\n\nBALI\u2019S Kuta beach is as unpretentious as a rubbish dump.\n\nYou can swim among native noodle packets and tropical-coloured plastic bags, you can get your toenails cut and your hair braided, and you can save a horse and ride a Kuta cowboy.\n\n\u201cWomen come to us because they want to be respected, they want to be treated right,\u201d \u2018Brown Sugar\u2019 told me (that\u2019s what how he wanted me to name him in the story, by the way).\n\nBrown Sugar, 21, is one of Bali\u2019s many male gigolos. Often called Kuta beach-boys, these sex workers are young, handsome, lean, tanned Indonesian men who give their attentions to female tourists.\n\n\u201cMost of the time we really do find the women attractive \u2026 I prefer sex with caucasian women, they are wilder,\u201d Brown Sugar said, as he sat on a surfboard on the ground in front of me. \u201cThe gift is usually just a bonus.\u201d\n\nBrown Sugar = Artificial Sweetener? Possibly \u2014 I mean his comment did taste a little too sweet to be true. That said, after several days of observing the Kuta Beach boys for this story, I noticed their admirers were not usually women who would struggle to get a date with a man back home \u2014 most were young, attractive and socially adept.\n\nSo what do these guys offer them that others don\u2019t?\n\n\u201cAll we do is ask women what they want and then provide them with that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe give them massages, we treat them right.\u201d\n\nI met a young blonde Australian sitting with a group of tanned Indonesian surfer-boys.\n\n\u201cThey are more attentive,\u201d she said. \u201cI just find them more respectful, more affectionate than most Aussie men.\u201d\n\nA photo advertising the \u2018Bali Boyfriend and Male Escort Service\u2019 on Facebook.\n\nA photo advertising the \u2018Bali Boyfriend and Male Escort Service\u2019 on Facebook.Source:Facebook\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Aussie women. The two most common nationalities by the Kuta Cowboys\u2019 side were young Japanese and Korean ladies. When I asked Brown Sugar why this was the case he introduced me to his friend, \u201cThe Korean Killer\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe treat the Korean ladies as equal, we don\u2019t see them as any lesser or better than us,\u201d he told me.\n\nTellingly, South Korea is a place where young educated women come up against traditional values \u2014 like being expected to stay at home while men bringing in the cash.\n\nJapan is another place where females are known to often struggle for independence and senior jobs. Both the Japanese and the Koreans seem to be finding a sense of empowerment, freedom and status on Bali\u2019s beaches they often struggle to find at home.\n\nThe Bali Gigolo phenomenon might be as unexpectedly informative as it is right on trend: A 2015 study from the University of Lancaster\u2019s Criminology Department suggested the British women who were paying for sex with male escorts were not desperate and dateless, but busy career professionals in their 30s and 40s \u2014 often too busy or not interested in conventional relationships.\n\nThe same study showed the market for male sex services online is rising a faster rate than those for adverts for women escorts. Indeed, Bali Gigolos are also, unsurprisingly, moving off the beaches and advertising online.\n\nThrough Facebook I found Steven \u2014 he started the Bali Boyfriend and Male Escort Service about four years ago.\n\nSteven, 27, of Balinese-Japanese descent, told me he sees about four clients per month \u2014 most of them Australian, Korean, Japanese and Russian.\n\n\u201cGenerally the age range is between 22 and 40,\u201d he explained. \u201cOnly about half of them want sex ... They usually want me to accompany them on some events and to treat them special. They want to be understood and to be treated properly.\u201d\n\nI asked what other men might be able to learn from him, based on what women ask him for.\n\n\u201cMen should learn to understand what women need, and how to treat them properly with respect and mutual understanding ... It\u2019s more than just sex, it\u2019s the art of touching their hearts and souls,\u201d Steven told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cMost men just fall asleep after sex \u2014 I ask what they want,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd what is that?\n\n\u201cThat want me to be gentle and they want to be given oral sex,\u201d he explained.\n\nThat\u2019s similar to what the next interviewee told me too, but not before sending this when I asked him how he wanted to be identified in the story:\n\nI am Roy Gonzales: Bali \u2014 Indonesia\n\n32 y old , 175cm, 65 Kg\n\nThe picture Roy Gonzales sent.\n\nThe picture Roy Gonzales sent.Source:Supplied\n\nTo clarify, Roy does do massages with happy endings for women.\n\nHe told me all of his clients were women aged between 30 and 45, who almost always want \u201cto be stimulated throughout the body ... They like a massage first. I will touch all over their bodies, and in the end I will have sex with them. The secret is must follow the will of the woman. The game should be long,\u201d he explained.\n\nBeing affectionate, paying more attention and asking women what they want sounds pretty simple really.\n\nDr Marie Tudor from Adelaide Sex Therapy told news.com.au that both her male and female clients complain their partners are not attentive enough.\n\n\u201cSome women say that they would like more lead up to sexual touching \u2014 for example, the massaging the Balinese gigolos provide,\u201d Dr Tudor told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cIn a relationship context, some women feel unable to get in the mood for sex when there have been domestic tensions and little warmth and appreciation from their partners.\u201d\n\nBut sex with gigolos in Bali doesn\u2019t come without modern realities, like the risk of HIV.\n\nEmily Perry, an independent HIV and harm reduction consultant based in Denpasar, said HIV infection is a serious problem right across Indonesia and is concentrated among five key groups in Bali including male sex workers and their clients.\n\n\u201cPeople take risks that they don\u2019t take at home when they go on holiday \u2014 be it not wearing a helmet on a motorbike or having sex,\u201d Perry said.\n\n\u201cI do get western clients coming in to see me for a HIV test all the time \u2014 usually panicked after doing something they regretted the night before.\u201d\n\nPlay it safe \u2014 fair enough. But what about the issues of power, exploitation and money?\n\n\u201cIn my experience women who do it are condemned in the same way as men \u2014 for objectifying and wielding power over men,\u201d says Dr Laura Agust\u00edn, an anthropologist and author of the book Sex at the Margins.\n\n\u201cThey are accused of racism and sexualising blackness. Is this all the erotic side of imperialism? I guess so. But we are all caught up in it; there is no perfectly clean place to stand,\u201d Dr Agustin said.\n\nWhat I can confirm, for very different reasons, is there isn\u2019t any perfectly clean place to stand on Kuta beach. Yet, I did find somewhere pleasant to sit \u2014 under the shade and with the never-ending local sixpack stomachs on display.\n\nAround the world, other common male escorts for tourists (the \u201cRent-a-Dreads\u201d in Jamaica, \u201cthe Marlboro Men\u201d in Jordan, \u201cthe Bumsters\u201d in Gambia, the \u201cDrummer Boys\u201d in Senegal) are known for being quite tall. But height wise \u2014 Indonesians are on average the smallest nationality in the world. And \u2014 ah, well, do you see where I am going with this?\n\nI had to ask Brown Sugar: \u201cI\u2019m wondering ... everywhere else that is known for female sex tourism the guys are notorious for being well hung.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell hung don\u2019t make always make a girl happy,\u201d Brown Sugar retorted. \u201cThey want romance, they want company.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do you think about the Kuta cowboys anyway?\u201d he later asked.\n\n\u201cAll this is news to me,\u201d I explained. \u201cI like men.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have no genitals?\u201d Brown Sugar asked, \u201cOr did they get injured in accident. Does your dick not work anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it still works \u2014 that\u2019s not the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how much does it cost you to do that to a man?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, usually, many men are like this.\u201d\n\nBrown Sugar gave a look of pensive confusion, then staring out to the ocean he said:\n\n\u201cWell y\u2019know what, man, if you like this and they like this, then I am very happy for you and I hope you find a nice Balinese guy.\u201d\n\nA week on Kuta beach: A learning experience all-round apparently.\n\nLuke Williams is a journalist and author of the Ice Age: A Journey into Crystal Meth Addiction.\n\nMeet Steve, the male escort\n\nMeet Steve, the male escort\n\nMeet Steve, the male escort\n\nMORE IN relationships",

        "text":"Preparing for a Happy Marriage\n\nAt 22, Ruth was a picture of youth and beauty. She was enjoying the university. Her studies were challenging. Her teachers were good. Life seemed so much fun, and so much more lay ahead of her. One day she met Robert, 24, a fellow student, and after that her life seemed to take an additional hue and glow. Ruth and Robert shared so much in common, worshiped in the same church, and had a clear perception of future goals. It looked as if they were made for each other. One evening while on a youth retreat, they walked to the lake. The waters reflected the golden orange of a setting sun. The trees were gently swaying. A summer breeze was bringing in the coolness of the north. This is the time, thought Robert, and asked Ruth something he had asked her months before: \"Will you be my steady date? I love you.\" \"Yes,\" said Ruth, and it seemed as if she were in a different world altogether, floating in the openness of love and promise.\n\nRuth's answer was not a hasty one. It followed a lot of thought, counseling, and prayer. The first time Robert put that question to her, she was not sure. She wanted time. She talked to a teacher, whom she trusted. She counseled with her pastor. Weeks after much thought and prayer, she was ready to say \"Yes.\"\n\nMarriage is important, but preparation for marriage is just as important. Choosing a marriage partner is one of the most important steps a young person takes in life. Such a decision must not be taken lightly or hastily. Experience suggests that there are at least four criteria young people should examine in their quest for a life partner. Choosing a life partner: four criteria\n\nReadiness. Readiness implies maturity of both parties for courtship and marriage. Maturity can often be measured by the way you answer the following questions: Are you ready for the challenges and joys of married life? Have you come out of the confusion and conflicts typical of adolescence? Are you balanced and responsible? Do you know how to relate to others altruistically? Can you think through and solve a problem, or do you tend to let problems overwhelm you? Do you understand and accept the sacred and undying nature of marriage? Have you developed wholesome and appropriate attitudes toward sex? Do you know what true love is? Do you have a positive religious experience?\n\nCompatibility. Incompatibility between husband and wife is one of the primary causes for marriage breakups. Young people contemplating marriage need to evaluate their compatibility. Test yourself by asking some hard questions: Do you feel comfortable with the way you communicate with each other? Is it easy for you to establish a successful dialogue? Are you comfortable with the other's manners and lifestyle? Are the ways in which you express affection pleasant or discomforting to either one or both? Are you comfortable with each other's temperament?\n\nCommunication is a key element in compatibility. If you find during courtship that you have communication difficulties and that even a simple discussion leads to serious misunderstandings, heated arguments, and shouting matches, chances are you will face similar problems even after marriage. Yes, any problem can be solved, given love, mutual understanding, and tolerance, but why take the risk? Better end the relationship before you enter marriage commitment.\n\nAnother strong element in building compatibility is a sense of basic agreement. During courtship, have you sensed a growing list of topics that you would rather not talk about? Is there basic disagreement between you on the important things in life? Do you have significant differences about values, religious beliefs and practices, or friends? Any serious differences in these areas should alert you to the possibility of incompatibility in marriage.\n\nHomogamy. The word may sound strange, but it has a simple meaning: likeness. Research shows that partners who share common characteristics in certain crucial areas have a better probability of success in marriage than those who do not. These areas include age, religion, education, intelligence, and social, cultural, and ethnic background.\n\nThis does not mean that marriage between persons who differ in any of these areas will inevitably fail. Given time and effort, mature Christians who are otherwise compatible can work out differences in one or more of these areas. However, research indicates that the more common factors the partners share, the less difficult marital adjustment will be. And when conflicts do arise, the easier it will be to make needed adjustments.\n\nSpiritual commitment. The most important factor for success in any aspect of life is a positive relationship with God. This is particularly true in marriage. When two persons with different religious commitments and preferences choose to marry, they are putting their marital stability in serious jeopardy. Such a high-risk marriage also puts the children in serious trouble.\n\nWhen Ruth said \"Yes\" to Robert, she had already given serious consideration to each of these criteria, and was quite certain that she was taking the right step. After she got back to the university from the retreat, her best friend immediately sensed that something had happened. Soon they were discussing all the exciting details. But after awhile Ruth grew pensive and shared some worries with her friend.\n\nRuth had seen many relationships as happy as hers turn sour. She did not want this to happen to her, and wondered if there were any secrets that could help a couple to have a successful and happy courtship. She knew that habits initiated during courtship days establish patterns that frequently follow into marriage. She wanted a happy marriage; therefore, she wanted their courtship to be a happy and enriching experience that could contribute to their personal growth and fulfillment.\n\nSecrets of a happy courtship\n\nRuth and others like her will benefit from knowing at least four secrets for a happy courtship:\n\n1. Seriousness of purpose. The courtship period should not be taken lightly. It provides special conditions under which young people can get to know each other and make intelligent decisions about marriage. This is a time for careful consideration of the issues involved, avoiding impulsive decisions. While young people should not believe that they must marry the first person with whom they establish a courtship relationship, it is legitimate for them to believe that their special person is a potential marriage partner. This must be especially true of Christian youth who choose to act at all times in terms of their commitment to Jesus.\n\n2. Creativity. Make courtship creative. Let it be a time of authentic rejoicing\u2014not just for you, but for those who wish you well. Do not allow the relationship to fall into a rut. Plan activities which both of you can enjoy. Working in a church or community project, exercising, cooking (and cleaning up afterwards!), baby sitting, camping, and similar activities do not cost much money but provide many opportunities for fun and togetherness.\n\nCultivate a hobby in which you can participate together. Photography, music, reading, sailing, or collecting (coins, stamps, shells, etc.), can be fun. Sharing and discussing ideas on topics such as future plans, current events, sports, and church activities help establish healthy communication patterns and a respect for each other's opinions.\n\n3. Sincerity. Without truthfulness and absolute honesty, no courtship can survive. Sincerity calls for being true to oneself and to each other. Saul was courting Ellen, a music major. He accompanied her to all the concerts and recitals and pretended to enjoy them, although he would much rather have been somewhere else. Ellen thought she was truly fortunate to be with someone who could appreciate the kind of music that was so important in her life. Imagine her dismay when she discovered after marriage that Saul could hardly stand classical music!\n\nSincerity also implies that if one feels that it would be best to terminate the relationship, it is better to state so honestly than to find excuses to delay a decision.\n\n4. Respect. A successful courtship requires consideration for the other person\u2014his or her feelings, preferences, ideas, family, and friends. Respect also involves appropriate limits on physical expressions of love. A Christian couple cannot permit any careless behavior that could lead to guilt and shame. They need to recognize that sex becomes joyous and fulfilling only within the confines of marriage.\n\nFor Ruth and Robert, courtship was truly a special and happy time. After two years they decided that they knew each other well enough, and they were ready to make a marriage commitment. They announced their engagement. Now it dawned on them that besides getting ready for the wedding, they needed to get ready for marriage.\n\nAlthough the Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual recommends that no minister should perform a wedding without extensive premarital counseling with the parties, not every potential groom and bride have this opportunity open to them. Even where professional counseling may not be easily available, the couple should seek advise from their pastor, their own reading resources, and others who may have had a positive experience in this area. Ruth and Robert did this. They had a few friends who were also planning to be married, and together they formed an informal group that met once a week to discuss different aspects of getting ready for marriage.\n\nGetting ready for marriage\n\n1. Understand the true nature of love. Love is a principle, not a fluctuating sentiment. Love involves, but is not, feelings. In fact, feelings can come from physical nearness or an exchange of caresses with a person of the opposite sex without any love whatsoever. True love in courtship and marriage is a combination of loyalty, intimacy, feelings of physical attraction, romance, companionship, and commitment. The apostle Pau... (truncated)",

        "text":"The Joy of Kuwentuhan\n\n Some of FANHS volunteers with Aunty Dorothy Cordova. (Photo courtesy of Rainier&nbsp;Reyes)&nbsp;\n\nSome of FANHS volunteers with Aunty Dorothy Cordova. (Photo courtesy of Rainier\u00a0Reyes)\u00a0\n\nEvery Friday afternoon, a group of volunteers at the FANHS (Filipino American National Historical Society) Seattle office gather around a small table for some kainan (sharing a meal) along with some kuwentuhan (sharing stories).\n\nThe delicacies that the volunteers prepare are as flavorsome and colorful as the stories they share. The table is full of adobo, rice, lumpia, and salad while the air gets filled with all kinds of kuwentos (stories) about the volunteers\u2019 hometowns, kids, grandkids, recent travels, and pilgrimages. The food and the stories shared form an invisible bridge that connects and strengthens the bonds they have with one another.\u00a0\n\nStories connect us. Stories move us. Stories shape us. Stories transform us. Whether we are on the giving or the receiving end of the story, we are bound to feel the story. Science tells us that storytelling changes our brain chemistry and behavior. As the neurons get fired up by the stories we tell or hear, our beliefs and behaviors open up to change. As the cortisol and oxytocin levels in our brain rise, our empathy and our social connections get strengthened. The neural activities in our brains begin to synchronize to march to the same beat, the beat of the story.\n\nWhen Western-trained social scientists and anthropologists first attempted to study the indigenous Filipino culture, they had to learn to use kuwentuhan as a methodology for collecting data because Filipinos did not just provide \u201cdata\u201d to non-\u201ckapwa tao.\u201d\n\nStorytelling is an act of generosity. Storytellers generously share their knowledge and wisdom while listeners generously share their time, presence, and openness of mind and heart. Storytelling facilitates the flow of mutual compassion. In a time of divisiveness and discord, storytelling is just what we need to reconnect us. Storytelling builds bridges. Storytelling heals.\n\nThere\u2019s more to storytelling\n\nThe word commonly used to translate storytelling into Tagalog is \u201ckuwentuhan.\u201d However, there is something more to this word and its culture-specific connotations that a simple translation just doesn\u2019t cut it. The ways in which we, Filipinos, share our stories are very much entrenched in our being, our cultural identity.\n\nIn the Filipino culture, one which social scientists have often described as collectivistic as opposed to individualistic, there is a strong emphasis on social relationships and interdependence rather than on the self and independence. \u201cKa,\u201d a prefix used for many Tagalog words, is often used to describe one\u2019s relationship with others. For example, \u201ckapwa\u201d (shared togetherness), \u201ckasama\u201d (companion), \u201ckaibigan\u201d (friend), and \u201ckapatid\u201d (brother\/sister). The symbol for \u201cKa\u201d in pre-colonial Philippine language is depicted by two parallel curvy lines connected by a single line. It is symbolic of the emphasis on our connectedness.\n\n The regular FANHS volunteers who come every Friday to help Aunty Dorothy.\n\nThe regular FANHS volunteers who come every Friday to help Aunty Dorothy.\n\nThe Filipino\u2019s sense is more on the sociocentric end of the spectrum rather than the egocentric. Filipinos place a higher value on interpersonal cooperation (\u201cbayanihan\u201d), reciprocity (\u201ckasamahan\u201d), and social acceptance (\u201cpakikisama\u201d) rather than on the individualistic culture\u2019s constructs of autonomy and uniqueness. Filipinos have strong family ties, and it\u2019s not only with immediate family members but extended family members as well. Obedience and respect of parents and elders are highly valued and we owe our elders a deep sense of gratitude (utang na loob) for having paved the way for our stories and journeys.\n\nThe ways we share our stories are shaped by our concept of the self, our social relationships, and our values. In our kuwentuhan, there is a shared togetherness. We share our stories with our \u201ckapwa.\u201d In a simple translation, \u201ckapwa\u201d means \u201cother person\u201d but according to Virgilio Enriquez, regarded by many as the Father of Philippine Psychology, \u201ckapwa\u201d really is better understood as \u201cshared togetherness.\u201d When we do our kuwentuhan with our kapwa, our stories are shaped and transmitted by our shared identity, our shared togetherness.\n\nA lot of the\u00a0titos\u00a0(uncles) and\u00a0titas\u00a0(aunties) I know like to ask the \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d question when meeting someone for the first time. At first, it may sound pre-judgmental, especially in the American social context, but if we take the time to further reflect on that question, what we\u2019ll find is that it really is an innocent and genuine way for Filipinos to establish the connection. It really is shorthand for asking, \u201cWhere did your journey begin, where has it taken you, where are your ancestors from, and how is your story similar to mine?\u201d As kapwa tao, our journeys are connected and in many ways the same. As\u00a0Professor EJ David said, \u201cIn kapwa, we are all the same\u200a\u2014\u200ano walls, no levels, no separations, no better, no worse.\u201d The question \u201cWhere are you from\u201d is an invitation to share your story and realize our connectedness, our kapwa tao.\n\nA culture of kuwentuhan\n\nThe Filipino culture is a storytelling culture. Kuwentuhan is our way of preserving our stories, histories, heritage, and the values we hold. Stories connect us to our ancestors\u200a\u2014\u200athe journeys they have taken and how they have paved the way for us. Storytelling is how knowledge, wisdom, and values are passed down from one generation to the next.\u00a0\n\nStories connect us to one another, with our kapwa. It is a way of building solidarity and cultivating our sense of shared identity. When we tell our stories and when we listen to one another\u2019s stories, we discover and strengthen our connections. We put ourselves into the storyteller\u2019s shoes. We insert ourselves into their narrative and we discover that we have more commonalities than differences. We find ourselves sharing in their stories of struggle and triumph. When we share stories, the activities of our \u201cmirror neurons,\u201d the building blocks in our brains for language and empathy, are highly active, producing genuine emotions as well as genuine social connections.\n\nWhen Western-trained social scientists and anthropologists first attempted to study the indigenous Filipino culture, they had to learn to use kuwentuhan as a methodology for collecting data because Filipinos did not just provide \u201cdata\u201d to non-\u201ckapwa tao.\u201d They shared \u201cdata\u201d only by kuwentuhan. If you really want to get to know the Filipino culture, you dine with them and you listen to their stories. You first become a kapwa to them. In current Philippine psychology and psychotherapy, kuwentuhan is an invaluable method used to build rapport and understand the context of the person.\n\nToday, in our rapidly changing society, the art of kuwentuhan is getting transformed, for better or for worse. With many of the stories moving to a digital platform, the essence of kuwentuhan is getting lost. It is true, the opportunities to connect with more people, especially in the digital world, are abundant. But as the quantity of our connections increase, the quality of our connectedness with our kapwa tends to suffer.\n\nIt may be true that we are able to tell more stories, whether through social media or whatever digital technology, but are we really able to share them in ways that enable us to realize our connectedness? One of the roots of our problems in society today, especially with the many issues that divide us, is that we no longer share stories like we used. We think we do when we share snippets of stories or tweets, but are they really enabling us to share and hear where the other is coming from. The character limitations on our smartphones as well as our busy schedules restrict us from fully realizing how connected we truly are. They just do not give our neurons the opportunity to align, synchronize, and march to the same beat.\u00a0\n\nKuwentuhan is also listening\n\nWe must tell our stories and we encourage everyone to tell their stories. But we must not forget how important it is to keep the emphasis on listening. As author Susan Cain put it, \u201cin a world that cannot stop talking,\u201d less and less people are on the listening side. The word \u201cstorytelling\u201d implies an action word that goes one way\u200a\u2014\u200athe telling of a story. Kuwentuhan is a lot more than just telling a story. The word \u201ckuwentuhan\u201d implies and requires both acts of telling and listening where a story is shared between and\/or among kapwas.\n\nThe Urgent Need for Kuwentuhan Today\n\nToday, it is more important than ever that we continue our kuwentuhan. We need to discover and rediscover our connections and commonalities, with our kapwa, with one another, and with our ancestors, those who have paved the way for us. We need to realize how linked our journeys are, how similar our struggles are, and how much of a shared identity we have as a people. We need to cultivate our connectedness. We need to continue to preserve our histories, where we came from, how we came to be, how we got here, and realize that we are kapwa tao, with a shared humanity and a shared togetherness. Kuwentuhan tayo.\n\nThe mission of the Kuwentuhan Tayo Project is to facilitate the sharing of our kuwentos (stories) in order to preserve our narratives and histories, to share our journeys, to know where we have been and where we are going, and to cultivate our sense of connectedness with our kapwa.

        "text":"What is the single most necessary trait for a long term happy relationship?\n\n\/ \/ A Table For Six\n\nA new relationship guide by Dr Tashiro, a psychology professor, writes that singles looking for long-lasting love should limit their list on their checklist to only three. He writes that good looks and money should not be included in that list.\n\nDr Ty Tashiro writes in his book \u201cThe Science of Happily Ever After\u201d, that the problem is that singles want everything in a potential partner and that results in them ending up with nothing.\n\nHe says that personality traits should be concentrated on and that the \u201cagreeable\u201d trait is the key to sustainable love and desire. Being agreeable will show up as someone who is forgiving, cooperative, good-natured, flexible, trusting, soft-hearted and tolerant.\n\nAlternatively, a partner who has a quality of \u201cNeuroticism\u201d is someone who is prone to anxiety, depression, embarrassment, emotional instability and insecurity. Dr Tashiro says that people with this trait are the worst for relationship sustainability.\n\nFrom his own research Dr Tashiro reiterates that good looks are not a a predictor of satisfying relationships, nor do they correlate to happier marriages. In fact, there is \u201cno reliable association between physical attractiveness and relationship satisfaction,\u201d he writes.\n\nIn regard to money, his research has shown that it does not keep a relationship buoyant, at least over a certain point.\n\nMoney does make a difference on the lower end of the scale, but for those above $75,000 there seems to be diminishing returns on happiness in marriage. \u201cOnce this threshold is crossed, there is no significant association between more wealth and higher levels of psychological well-being\u201d, Dr Tashiro writes.\n\nHe encourages singles to be more realistic in their expectations to improve the odds of finding a compatible mate. Dr Tashiro states that society\u2019s fairy-tale view of romance where 88% of adults believe in \u201csoul mates\u201d \u2013 has contributed to the fact that although 90% of people will marry in their lifetimes, only one in three will find long-lasting love.\n\nHe says that many women will search for a man who is handsome, tall and makes good money, but only about one percent of the suitors they are likely to meet will fit into this category.\n\nDr Tashiro states that his book is about making smarter choices and learning to weed out the undesirable traits and rethinking our views about what really matters in a romantic partner.\n\nOur A Table for Six dinners are a great tool to use to meet singles face to face in a relaxed environment. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to interact and also observe other singles interacting in a social situation with no pressure. They are also a lot of fun.\n\nHere\u2019s another story I wrote on this topic \u2013\n\nWhat is most important in a partner?\n\n4 Things that will damage a relationship\n\n\nMargaret Newitt\n\n\n\n1300 885 311\n\nLic no 3338670",
