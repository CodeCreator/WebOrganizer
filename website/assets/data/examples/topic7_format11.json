        "text":"Weather Forecast\n\n\nPrime Time: Senior Center history account concludes\n\nIt's the year 2001 and that's where I, Ann Daly, came in.\n\nChuck Melberg invited me to serve on some kind of committee to help the Senior Center Board look at some new ideas. Chuck was a long time public servant and activist for the aging. He made a career out of helping people. We honored him for his extraordinary volunteer work in 2003. He was my mentor and friend.\n\nAnyway, so there I was per Chuck's invitation at the annual meeting. Following the meeting the new board retired to the meeting room at which time new officers would take over the business of running the center. I was soon to learn that they had a most unorthodox way of filling the board positions. The chair person, who happened to be Merlin Froyd at the time, said, \"OK, now, who hasn't been president around here yet? We haven't had a woman yet, so how about you, Ann?\"\n\n\"Not me,\" I gasped, \"I'm not even a member yet.\"\n\nWhere upon Wally Wubbles whipped out his billfold and slapped a $20 bill on the table and said, \"You are now.\"\n\nNow you tell me. Is that any way to run a railroad?\n\n\nI served as president a couple of times, and during those times, we did make some changes. We had to give up cooking at our Beltrami County Fair booth and having strawberry festivals, corn feeds and spaghetti dinners. Our members could no longer physically do these kinds of projects. Instead, we sold brats on Crazy Daze and had music and dancing under a big tent. We also started the annual style show fund raiser. The brat idea went down the tubes when the Lake Bemidji Dragon Boat Festival began, but the style show continues to be a special community event. The craft shop continues to make generous donations to the center and the card ladies keep the racks supplied with greeting cards for the public to buy. The monthly pancake breakfasts continue to be a popular event and a steady source of income. Incidentally, in 1993 a pancake breakfast cost $3 - here we are 18 years later and breakfast is still a good buy at $5. This project requires a lot of work and so provides a variety of volunteer opportunities. Other sources of income include donations from the safe driving and tax assistance programs, the Giving Tree and the LSS Nutrition Program. We receive donations from the morning coffee club and have also been fortunate to receive some generous individual donations. And, of course, the United Way is our greatest source of steady support.\n\nOne of the most positive things that has happened at the center in the last 10 years is the formation of a singing group known as \"The 3rd Street Senior Singers.\" Marie Luoma is given the credit for starting the program, and it continues to thrive under the direction of Cynthia White. Many thanks to both of these women for their commitment to this musical program. These singers are ambassadors of good will. They rehearse every week and perform regularly, bringing the joy of music to residents of several long-term care facilities in the community.\n\nAnother great program which is offered at the center is the Silver Stretchers Work Out and Walk Away the Pounds Program. Phyllis Grubbe has faithfully headed up this program for several years.\n\nCard playing, Scrabble and jigsaw puzzling continue to be popular activities. A wood carving group also meets on a weekly basis. The RSVP program provides opportunities for seniors to work with the America Reads Program, our pen pal project, and various other RSVP programs. For many people the noon time meal is the reason they come to the center. Thanks to LSS diners can receive a nutritious meal for a reasonable donation and visit with their friends while they eat. The Meals on Wheels Program is available for people who are confined to their homes.\n\nAnd so the saga comes to an end. It's been quite a ride. I know one thing I've learned. I will never ever put a photo in an album without including the name, the date, the place and the event. Mark my word!\n\nSo to wind this up, I'll just say that although I think I've always had respect and appreciation for seniors and what they are capable of doing, I have a lot more now. As for me, I need to do more thinking \"outside the box.\"\n\nAnn Daley is a Paul Bunyan Senior Activity Center volunteer.",

Sinn\n\nFormer Juneau resident, Walter \"Walt\" O'Neal Sinn, died on April 17, 2001, in Friday Harbor, Wash.\n\nHe was born March 29, 1914, in Gilbert, Iowa. As a young man he earned a living as a professional motorcycle stunt rider at state and county fairs throughout the Midwest. In 1942 he moved to Ketchikan, where he worked on a rock crusher. He later moved to Juneau joining the Coast Guard and served in World War II when he was stationed at Scotchcap Lighthouse and Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nHe married Doris Macomber in Juneau in 1944 at the Masonic Temple where he was an active 32nd degree member. He was also a 14th degree Scottish Rite member.

        "text":"Billy Richards \u2013 Navigating A Better Future for Hawaiian Keiki\n\nBilly Richards, a member of the original Hokulea crew and several subsequent voyages, is now working to improve the quality of life for Hawaii children through Partners In Development\n\nE kaupe aku no i ka hoe a ko mai (Put forward the paddle and draw it back. Go on with the task that is started and finish it.) \u2013Hawaiian proverb\n\nIs life a journey or a destination? For Billy Richards, it\u2019s a fascinating journey that takes him to the depths of the ocean, to exotic ports of call guided by the stars and to native Hawaiian communities that touch the human spirit.\n\nYet all the while he is anchored by cultural values that define \u201chome\u201d for him. It is both destination and destiny.\n\nHow does a Renaissance man balance traditional and contemporary ways?\n\nTo find out, we make our way to a second floor office in Nuuanu, where Richards works as director of communications for Partners In Development Foundation (PID).\n\nRichards, 65, a Kailua resident, is a handsome islander with silver hair, mustache and Van Dyke beard that contrast strikingly with the black shirt he is wearing. His youthful appearance belies the depth of character, maturity and infinite wisdom he imparts.\n\n\nPicture 1 of 2\n\nBilly Richards, who has crewed aboard Hokulea, Hawaiiloa, Makalii and Hokualakai, is president of Friends of Hokulea and Hawaiiloa | Nathalie Walker photo\n\nHe\u2019s an old soul of sorts with a quiet sophistication that friends say makes him ha\u2019aha\u2019a (humble).\n\nBut today we hope to draw out his credentials and achievements that merit recognition. He would be the first to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not about me.\u201d We\u2019ll see about that.\n\nRichards has been involved with Hawaii\u2019s voyaging community since 1975 and has served aboard canoes Hokulea, Hawaiiloa, Makalii and Hokualakai. He is president of the Friends of Hokulea and Hawaiiloa, a nonprofit that perpetuates ancient Hawaiian canoe practices by building and restoring vessels.\n\nHe is chairman of Ohana Waa, a canoe hui that pools resources and manpower to pursue voyaging ventures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved the ocean,\u201d Richards says. \u201cI was inspired as a youngster by stories of mythological heroes such as Vikings and Greek gods. My dad (William K. Richards Sr.) reminded me that Hawaii has its own legendary heroes.\u201d\n\nRichards reaches for a book on his desk.\n\n\u201cThis was on my dad\u2019s headboard,\u201d he says of a volume titled Vikings of Sunrise by Sir Peter Buck. \u201cIt is about the great migration of Polynesians and the tales regarding the creation of man and the islands.\n\n\u201cI read it and thought to myself, \u2018One day I\u2019m going to sail to Tahiti,'\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cMy mother (hula teacher Bella Richards) visited Tahiti often on dance missions and invited me along, but I wanted to approach the island from the sea,\u201d says the voyager at heart.\n\nThat is not surprising, given his European-Hawaiian ethnicity that suggests an adventuresome and exploratory nature.\n\ne shares this spirit with wife Debbie Nakanelua-Richards, senior manager of government and community relations at Hawaiian Airlines. A former Miss Hawaii, this beautiful hula dancer who performs weekly at the Halekulani, met her husband at an induction ceremony for lua (Hawaiian martial arts) practitioners. The Richards have a 22-year-old daughter, Mahina, a graduate student in clinical psychology at Sarah Lawrence College.\n\nThe exploration of the ocean and its pathways to the world led Richards to marine management jobs in the public and private sectors. He spent two decades at Oceanic Institute, where he served in program development, research, Hawaiian fishpond revitalization and administration of Hawaii Island\u2019s Keahuolu facility.\n\nMore recently he was vice president and general manager of Hawaii High Health Seafood Corporation, the sales and marketing subsidiary of a large land-based aquaculture operation located on Kauai.\n\nHe also has been an underwater surveyor, doing biological surveys for environmental impact studies of projects such as Kahoolawe and the reef runway.\n\nBut his most socially sensitive link to his cultural roots and traditions might be the role he presently holds at the nonprofit organization known as Partners in Development (PID), an Aloha United Way agency.\n\nDon\u2019t be scared off by the word \u201cdevelopment.\u201d This has nothing to do with building high-rise condos and mega malls, although \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d in personal growth and a social sense would be a logical association.\n\nThe foundation was founded in 1997 by Jan E. Hanohano Dill, grandson of a Hawaiian healer who wants to help native Hawaiian families and communities deal with life challenges.\n\nThe Kamehameha Schools graduate and Fulbright Fellow utilized his skills as an educator, political scientist, lawyer, marine scientist and diplomat to develop PID Foundation, where Richards directs communications and \u201cputting us on the map.\u201d",
