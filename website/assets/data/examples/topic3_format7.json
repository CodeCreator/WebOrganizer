        "text":"Enforcement of Judgments 2020 Comparisons\n\nLast Updated August 04, 2020\n\nContributed By Baker McKenzie\n\nLaw and Practice\n\n\nBaker McKenzie is a leading global law firm, with offices in 78 cities worldwide. The Canadian team has acted on some of the country's most important enforcement cases in the past two decades. The firm's Canadian lawyers are fully integrated with other Baker McKenzie litigators located worldwide. The firm is a highly regarded litigation group in Canada with particular expertise in multi-jurisdictional disputes, including all manner of fraud, financial recovery and enforcement-related disputes. The Canadian group provides clients with co-ordinated litigation, arbitration and enforcement services nationally and internationally. To appreciate the depth of the Canadian group's fraud law, enforcement and asset tracing expertise, visit their blog-site at: www.canadianfraudlaw.ca\n\nIdentifying an opposing party's asset position prior to, during or following a proceeding can be critical to informing a plaintiff's litigation or judgment enforcement strategy. Obtaining a judgment will be of little value if the unsuccessful party has no assets or is unable to satisfy the judgment. Fortunately, a number of measures are available in Canada that can assist in identifying an opposing party's asset position.\n\nPublicly Available Information and Private Investigations\n\nSome limited information that can shed light on an adversary's financial position is publicly available. For example, title searches and land registry searches can reveal the registered owners of real property and whether any encumbrances such as liens, certificates of pending litigation, judgments or mortgages are registered against the property.\n\nSearches can be conducted for personal or moveable property, which will indicate whether the personal property of a person or corporate entity is encumbered and subject to the security interests of other creditors.\n\nLitigation searches and insolvency searches can reveal the extent to which an adverse party has been involved in prior or concurrent litigation and\/or insolvency proceedings. If the adverse party is or has been involved in litigation or insolvency proceedings, a review of public court filings may reveal useful financial information about that party.\n\nLicensed private investigators can be engaged to investigate the other party's asset position. In Canada, private investigators are subject to industry regulations as well as provincial and federal laws. Private investigators can garner financial information by carrying out various registry searches (including those noted above), conducting interviews, performing surveillance and other legitimate investigative techniques.\n\nExaminations in Aid of Execution\n\nFrom a post-judgment perspective, having a full appreciation of the unsuccessful party's asset position will facilitate a well-considered and targeted enforcement strategy. Once judgment is obtained, a successful party can conduct an examination in aid of execution to obtain information concerning the debtor's financial position and his or her ability to satisfy the judgment. The debtor must answer questions under oath about his or her financial affairs, assets, income, liabilities and expenses. The debtor is also obliged to produce relevant financial records, such as financial statements, bank statements, tax returns, payroll information and the like, all of which can be of assistance in guiding the creditor's enforcement strategy. Examinations in aid of execution are discussed in more detail in 2.3 Costs and Time Taken to Enforce Domestic Judgments.\n\nFreezing and Asset Disclosure Orders\n\nIn Canada, there are a number of remedies to assist in securing assets before judgment. These include Mareva injunctions (which can include an asset disclosure component) and certificates of pending litigation, as well as asset or \"specific fund\" preservation orders issued under provincial rules of civil procedure.\n\nThe Mareva Injunction in Canada\n\nWhile the law concerning Mareva injunctions has not developed in exactly the same way as in the United Kingdom, this extraordinary form of pre-judgment \"freeze order\" is available and, in the right circumstances, can be granted with asset disclosure terms having worldwide effect. Dubbed one of \"the law\u2019s two nuclear weapons\", it was confirmed as part of the common law of Canada in a 1985 decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada. However, the Supreme Court did not establish a rigid test for the remedy. Rather, it established certain broad parameters without imposing an inflexible prescription. The court summarised the \"gist of the Mareva action\" as follows: the right to freeze exigible assets within the jurisdiction, regardless of where the defendant resides, where a cause of action between the plaintiff and defendant has been determined which is justiciable before the courts of that jurisdiction and where there is a genuine risk of the disappearance of assets, either inside or outside the jurisdiction.\n\nIn recent years, as more Mareva orders have been sought in more varied scenarios, the requirements for a Mareva injunction have been relaxed somewhat. A recent Ontario Superior Court decision held that the risk of dissipation can be inferred in cases where the inference arises from the circumstances of the alleged fraud, taking into context of all of the surrounding circumstances. Such circumstances include evidence suggestive of the defendant\u2019s fraudulent activity or a pattern of prior fraudulent conduct. However, the requirement to have evidence of dissipation would not be automatically addressed simply because the plaintiff established a strong prima facie case of fraud. The inference would also be available if a strong prima facie case is established for other causes of action.\n\nThe Supreme Court seemed to favour the \"strong prima facie case\" requirement adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal a few years earlier, while also noting that the Ontario approach was \"somewhat narrower\" than the \"good arguable case\" standard of UK case law. The \"balance of convenience\" must favour the issuance of the order. This branch of the analysis involves a detailed consideration of the competing interests at play: principally, the plaintiff\u2019s interest in avoiding a dry judgment and the defendant\u2019s interest in not having assets detained prior to judgment.\n\nIn British Columbia, the courts have adopted a flexible approach, employing a two-step test for the issuance of a Mareva injunction. Courts have the flexibility to carry out justice between the parties in any given case, and not render the judge \u201ca prisoner of a formula\". The British Columbia Court of Appeal has also recognised that almost every Mareva injunction is likely to inconvenience the other party in some way and has emphasised that \"the overarching consideration in each case is the balance of justice and convenience\".\n\nMareva injunctions are often sought on an ex parte basis. As with any ex parte relief, it is crucial that full, frank and fair disclosure be made of all material facts, particularly those that tend to support the position of the party against whom the injunction is sought. Such disclosure should include sufficient detail to allow the ex parte judge to determine the correct value of the underlying claim and, accordingly, of the assets to be frozen.\n\nCertain jurisdictions have developed model Mareva orders, which serve as a guide when determining the appropriate parameters for this extraordinary relief. In a number of provinces, the ex parte order has a specific shelf life (ten days, typically) within which it must be renewed on an inter partes basis.\n\nCertain model Mareva orders include or permit asset disclosure terms. These provisions can be a powerful tool to determine the scope of a defendant's assets. There will often be a term that requires the defendant to deliver a sworn statement describing the nature, value and location of assets, whether in his or her own name and whether solely or jointly owned. A further term can require the defendant to submit to examinations under oath on the sworn asset statement. Where these terms are granted, refusal to provide the asset information or submit to cross-examination may result in a finding of contempt of court.\n\nAs mentioned above, Mareva injunctions can be framed to freeze and obtain disclosure of assets, both within Canada and on a worldwide basis. In Ontario, a recent decision provided for a worldwide Mareva injunction where the defendant had no assets in the jurisdiction. A key factor in granting the injunction was evidence based on information from Hong Kong lawyers that the Canadian order would assist in securing a freezing order in Hong Kong.\n\nFinally, while Mareva injunctions are typically sought before judgment, there is authority for granting a Mareva after judgment, which can be useful to determine the location of assets and securing assets in circumstances where a judgment debtor may seek to deplete, move or otherwise deal with the assets pending the outcome of an appeal.\n\nCertificates of Pending Litigation (CPL)\n\nWhere real property is at issue, an order for a CPL may be obtained. A CPL is designed to provide a notice of claim and a warning to the public that the property is subject to a court dispute. It has the practical effect of restraining dealings with the property (eg sale, financing, mortgaging etc) while the litigation is pending.\n\nAs a standalone pre-judgment remedy, a CPL can be made on a motion without notice, provided that the originating pleading includes a claim for the CPL with a proper description of the land in question. To obtain an order for a CPL, the moving party must first show that there is a triable issue in respect of the claim to an interest in the land. If this threshold test is met, the court will typically go on to consider a variety of equitable factors, such as whether the land is unique, whether dam... (truncated)",

        "text":"Carbon Monoxide Alarms and Colorado's New Law\n\nColorado\u2019s new law concerning carbon monoxide alarms was signed by Governor Ritter on March 24, 2009 and applies to sales, rentals and remodels of single family and multi-family residences on and after July 1, 2009. The definition of \u201cmulti-family dwelling\u201d in the new law specifically includes condominiums, and therefore, subject to certain limitations, would apply to units in condominium associations.\n\nThe law applies to dwelling units that have a fuel fired heater or appliance, a fireplace, or an attached garage. If any of these conditions exist, then the law applies to sellers of dwelling units offered for sale on or after July 1, 2009; dwelling units where, on or after July 1, 2009, remodeling occurs that requires a building permit; or dwelling units used for rental purposes that have a change of occupancy after July 1, 2009. If any of these three events occurs, then the unit must have an operational carbon monoxide alarm installed within fifteen feet of the entrance to each room lawfully used for sleeping purposes or in a location specified by any applicable building code. This latter requirement is overridden if the multi-family dwelling has a central alarm system and the carbon monoxide alarm is installed within twenty-five feet of the fuel fired heater, fireplace or garage. In addition, in connection with rental units, the law mandates certain actions that the unit owner must take with respect to installation and replacement of alarms, and provision of batteries to assure that the alarms are operational.\n\nWhile the law is somewhat vague with respect to who is obligated to install the alarm when the circumstances giving rise to the requirement is either remodeling or rental, it does not appear to require associations to be responsible for compliance or assurance of an owner\u2019s compliance. Rather, it appears that the onus is on the unit owner to install the alarm and assure its ongoing maintenance and operation. If the alarm is installed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and the new law, then the owner of the property, his\/her authorized agent, person in possession of the property and the installer are immune from liability for damages resulting from operation, maintenance, or effectiveness of the alarm.\n\nIf you have other questions about this new law, please feel free to contact us.",

        "text":"Intellectual Property Protection\n\n1 Intellectual Property Protection\n\nIntellectual property protection in Malaysia comprises of patents, trademarks, industrial designs, copyright, geographical indications and layout designs of integrated circuits. Malaysia is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and a signatory to the Paris Convention and Berne Convention which govern these intellectual property rights.\n\nIn addition, Malaysia is also a signatory to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) signed under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Malaysia provides adequate protection to both local and foreign investors. Malaysia's intellectual property laws are in conformance with international standards and have been reviewed by the TRIPs Council periodically.\n\n\nThe Patents Act 1983 and the Patents Regulations 1986 govern patent protection in Malaysia. An applicant may file a patent application directly if he is domicile or resident in Malaysia. A foreign application can only be filed through a registered patent agent in Malaysia acting on behalf of the applicant.\n\nSimilar to legislations in other countries, an invention is patentable if it is new, involves an inventive step and is industrially applicable. In accordance with TRIPS, the Patents Act stipulates a protection period of 20 years from the date of filing of an application. Under the Act, the utility innovation certificate provides for an initial duration of ten years protection from the date of filing of the application and renewable for further two consecutive terms of five years each subject to use. The owner of a patent has the right to exploit the patented invention, to assign or transmit the patent, and to conclude a licensed contract.\n\nIn accordance with TRIPS, under the scope of compulsory licence, the Act allows for importation of patented products that are already in the other countries' market (parallel import).The Government can prohibit commercial exploitation of patents for reasons of public order or morality. The Act was amended to include provision for Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and to allow importation under the scope of compulsory license.\n\nMalaysia has acceded to the PCT in the year 2006 and effective from 16 August 2006, the PCT International Application can be made at the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO).\n\nTrade Marks\n\nTrade mark protection is governed by the Trade Marks Act 1976 and the Trade Marks Regulations 1997.\n\nThe Act provides protection for registered trade marks and service marks in Malaysia. Once registered, no person or enterprise other than its proprietor or authorised users may use them. Infringement action can be initiated against abusers. The period of protection is ten years, renewable for a period of every ten years thereafter. The proprietor of the trade mark or service mark has the right to deal or assign as well as to license its use.\n\nIn accordance with TRIPS, Malaysia prohibits the registration of well-known trade marks by unauthorised persons and provides for border measures to prohibit counterfeit trade marks from being imported into Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia accedes to the Nice and Vienna Agreements on 28 June 2007 which was enforced on 28 September 2007. Nice Agreement is concerning the International Clasiffication of Goods and Services for the purpose of the registration of marks whereas the Vienna Agreement establishes a classification for marks, which consist of or contain figurative elements. Both agreements are significant to facilitate trade mark registration.\n\nAs with patents, while local applicants may file applications on their own, foreign applicants will have to do so through registered trade mark agents.\n\nIndustrial Designs\n\nIndustrial design protection in Malaysia is governed by the Industrial Designs Act 1996 and Industrial Designs Regulations 1999. The Act provides the rights of registered industrial designs as that of a personal property capable of assignment and transmission by operation of the law.\n\nTo be eligible for registration, industrial designs must be new and do not include a method of construction or design that is dictated solely by function. In addition, the design of the article must not be dependent upon the appearance of another article of which it forms an integral part.\n\nLocal applicants can file registrations individually or through a registered industrial designs agent. However, foreign applicants will need to seek the services of a registered industrial designs agent. Registered industrial designs are protected for an initial period of five years which may be extended for another two 5-year terms, providing a total protection period of 15 years.\n\n\nThe Copyright Act 1987 provides comprehensive protection for copyrightable works. The Act outlines the nature of works eligible for copyright (which includes computer programs), the scope of protection, and the manner in which the protection is accorded. There is no registration for copyright works.\n\nCopyright protection for literary, musical or artistic works is for the duration of the life of the author and 50 years after his death. In sound recordings, broadcasts and films, copyright protection is for 50 years after the works are first published or made.\n\nThe Act also provides protection for the performer's rights in a live performance which shall continue to subsist for fifty years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the live performance was given.\n\nA unique feature of the Act is the inclusion of provisions for its enforcement. The amendment of the Copyright Act 1987, which was enforced on 1 October 2003 confers power of arrest (including arrest without warrant) to enforcement officers of the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperative and Consumerisme (MDTCC) formerly known as Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs. This special team of officers of the MDTCC is appointed to enforce the Act and is empowered to enter premises suspected of having infringing copies and to search and seize infringing copies and contrivances.\n\nLayout Design of Integrated Circuit\n\nThe Layout Designs of Integrated Circuits Act 2000 provides for the protection of layout designs of integrated circuits based on originality, creator's own invention and the fact that the creation is freely created. There is no registration for the layout design of an integrated circuit.\n\nThe duration of protection is 10 years from the date of its commercial exploitation or 15 years from the date of creation if not commercially exploited. The Act also allows for action to be taken by the owner if such rights recognised under the Act have been infringed. The right can also be transferred either partly or wholly by way of assignment, licence, wills or through the enforcement of law.\n\nThe Act is implemented in compliance with the TRIPS Agreement to provide a guarantee to investors in Malaysia's electronics industry and to ensure the growth of technology in the country.\n\nGeographical Indications\n\nThe Geographical Indications Act 2000 provides protection to goods following the name of the place where the goods are produced, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the goods is essitially attributable to their geographical origin. This protection is applicable to goods such as wine and spirit, or natural or agricultural products or any product of handicraft or industry. Geographical indications which are contrary to public order or morality shall not be protected under the Act.\n\nThe period of production is 10 years and renewable for a period of 10 years thereafter.\n\nFor further information on intellectual property protection please visit http:\/\/www.myipo.gov.my.\n\n\nEnvironmental Management\n\nBanking, Finance & Exchange Administration\n\n\nInfrastructure Support\n\nLast Updated : Friday 28th April 2017",

LPS will provide protection for people aged 16 and above who are or who need to be deprived of their liberty in order to enable their care or treatment and lack the mental capacity to consent to their arrangements, in England and Wales. The government has committed to bringing LPS into force to replace the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). It had been planned for an implementation date of 1 October 2020. However, this has now been postponed until an anticipated date of April 2022. See\u00a0Liberty Protection Safeguards Factsheets (Department of Health and Social Care).\n\nFebruary 2021: This chapter was amended to add the note above regarding the timetable for the introduction of Liberty Protection Safeguards.\n\n1. Deprivation of Liberty\n\nThe Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) were introduced in 2009 to protect against arbitrary deprivations of liberty in either a care home or hospital.\u00a0 The Safeguards protect the human rights of people who lack capacity to\u00a0consent\u00a0to care or treatment in a hospital or registered care home, when \u2013 in their best interests \u2013 they receive care that amounts to a deprivation of their liberty (as defined by Article 5,\u00a0Right to Liberty,\u00a0Human Rights Act 1998).\u00a0 DoLS is an amendment to the\u00a0Mental Capacity Act 2005\u00a0(MCA), as introduced by the Mental Health Act 2007.\n\nIn March 2014, the Supreme Court held that a deprivation of liberty can also occur in community settings, such as the person\u2019s own home or a supported living environment, where the State is responsible for imposing such arrangements. Deprivation of Liberty in this context must be authorised by the Court of Protection.\n\n1.1 Identifying and Addressing Potential Deprivations of Liberty\n\nRelevant case law (Storck v Germany, 2005) confirms that, in order to determine whether a person is deprived of their liberty, within the meaning of Article 5(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights, three conditions need to be satisfied:\n\n  \u2022 the objective element of an individual\u2019s confinement \u2013 the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation and the degree of intensity of the restrictions upon the person (Guzzardi v. Italy 1981);\n  \u2022 the subjective element \u2013 the person lacks capacity to consent to the confinement;\n  \u2022 the confinement is imputable to the state (that is one for which the state can be said to be responsible, or aware of).\n\nMore recently, in March 2014, the Supreme Court confirmed that if a person is also under \u2018continuous supervision and control\u2019, and \u2018is not free to leave\u2019, then they are potentially being deprived of their liberty.\u00a0 This is commonly known as the \u2018acid test\u2019 (which emerged from P v Cheshire West and Chester Council and P and Q v Surrey County Council). The Supreme Court ruling significantly widened the criteria for DoLS, and more people now fall within the scope of DoLS.\n\nThe Courts do not expect care providers to be experts about what is, and is not, a deprivation of liberty, but they do expect staff to be able to recognise when a person might be at risk of deprivation of liberty, by applying the\u00a0conditions as described above.\n\nTherefore, care providers must consider any restrictions \/ restraints when designing and implementing new care and treatment plans for individuals lacking capacity.\u00a0 They must also be alert to any restrictions and restraint which may be of a degree or intensity that mean an individual is being, or is likely to be, deprived of their liberty.\n\nWhere a potential deprivation of liberty is identified, the care provider must explore the alternative ways of providing the care and\/ or treatment, in order to identify any potentially less restrictive ways of providing that care which will avoid a deprivation of liberty.\n\nIf the deprivation of liberty cannot be avoided then the Courts expect care providers to take the required action, by applying for an authorisation to the supervisory body (the Local Authority). Organisations and care providers must refer to their local policies and procedures for guidance on how to apply for a DoLS authorisation.\n\nIf an organisation fails to take appropriate action then they risk breaching a person\u2019s human rights by unlawfully depriving them of their liberty.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a serious issue which could attract regulatory, civil or criminal action against the care provider.\n\n2. Alerting to Unlawful Deprivation of Liberty\n\nIf a person (professional or otherwise) suspects an individual is being deprived of their liberty, and the care provider has not taken appropriate action by applying for an authorisation to the relevant supervisory body, then they should first discuss their concerns with the care provider.\u00a0 The care provider should review the care regime and, where necessary, make an application for a DoLS authorisation.\n\nIf the care provider does not agree to make a request for a DoLS authorisation, the concerned person should approach the local authority, as the supervisory body, to discuss the situation and report their concerns.\u00a0 The concerned person may also contact the Care Quality Commission if the concerns relate to a care home or a hospital.",

        "text":"Welcome to the National Center for Victims of Crime\n\nWe are the nation's leading resource and advocacy organization for crime victims and those who serve them. Please join us as we forge a national commitment to help victims of crime rebuild their lives.\n\n\nThe term \"restitution\" in the criminal justice system means payment by an offender to the victim for the harm caused by the offender's wrongful acts. Courts have the authority to order convicted offenders to pay restitution to victims as part of their sentences. In approximately one-third of states, courts are required to order restitution to victims in cases involving certain types of crimes, typically violent felony offenses, but sometimes other serious offenses as well. Restitution can cover any out-of-pocket losses directly relating to the crime, including:\n\n  \u2022 medical expenses\n  \u2022 therapy costs\n  \u2022 prescription charges\n  \u2022 counseling costs\n  \u2022 lost wages\n  \u2022 expenses related to participating in the criminal justice process (such as travel costs, child care expenses, etc.)\n  \u2022 lost or damaged property\n  \u2022 insurance deductibles\n  \u2022 crime-scene clean up, or any other expense that resulted directly from the crime\n\nRestitution will not cover such things as pain and suffering or emotional distress, only damages that are easy to prove-things for which a victim might have a bill or a receipt.\n\nThe difference between restitution and compensation\n\nWhile restitution is court-ordered payment from a convicted offender, crime victim compensation is a state government program that pays many of the out-of-pocket expenses of victims of violent crime even when there is no arrest or prosecution. Ordinarily, to be eligible for compensation the victim is required to report the offense within a certain amount of time, cooperate in the investigation and prosecution, and file an application within a set time. The expenses covered by compensation vary and are usually set by state law. All compensation programs cover medical expenses, most cover counseling, and very few cover any property loss.\n\nIn comparison, restitution can only be ordered in cases where someone has been convicted. However, restitution can be ordered in almost any case (although courts may be required to order it only for certain offenses), and can be ordered for a wider variety of losses, including property loss.\n\nA victim cannot collect both compensation and restitution for the same losses. Where compensation has already paid for some of the victim's losses, a court may order the offender to reimburse the state compensation program and order the offender to pay the victim for losses that weren't covered by compensation.\n\nThe difference between restitution and civil damages\n\nRestitution, as noted above, is ordered by a criminal court after the offender has been found guilty. Civil damages are ordered when someone has won a lawsuit in civil court. Victims of crime can obtain both restitution and civil damages. A victim can sue an offender even when the offender has been ordered to pay restitution. Civil damages can include losses not covered by restitution, such as payment for pain and suffering, payment for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and even punitive damages-damages imposed just to punish the defendant. However, as in cases where the victim receives crime victim compensation and court-ordered restitution, victims cannot collect twice for the same loss. Usually a civil judgment is decreased by the amount of restitution that the victim has already received for a loss.\n\nIncreasing the likelihood that restitution will be ordered\n\nVictims can do two things to increase the likelihood that restitution will be ordered in their case: gather information about their financial loss, and request that restitution be ordered.\n\nTo increase the chances that restitution will be ordered, victims should make sure their victim impact statement includes a summary of the out-of-pocket expenses resulting from the crime. The prosecutor's office may have financial impact forms that can help victims think about the possible losses that could be covered by restitution. Victims should also tell prosecutors early in the process that restitution is important to them, so that prosecutors can be prepared to request restitution as part of any plea agreement, sentence, or condition of probation. If victims have the opportunity to address the court at the time a plea agreement is presented or at sentencing, they should specifically describe the financial impact of the crime and, if permitted in that state, request restitution. (In some states, a victim's in-court statement must be limited to describing the impact of the offense and cannot include any opinion about the sentence that should be given, including restitution. In those states, the prosecutor can still seek restitution.)\n\nCourts may order full or partial restitution\n\nWhen courts order restitution, they look not only at the victim's losses but also at the offender's ability to pay. In some states, the court may reduce the total amount of restitution ordered if the offender is unlikely to be able to pay that amount. In other states, courts will order the offender to pay for the full amount of the loss, but then set a payment schedule based on the offender's finances, which may only be a minimal amount per month.\n\nCollecting restitution\n\nCollection of restitution is often limited by the offender's ability to pay. As a result, many victims wait years before they receive any restitution, and they may never receive the full amount of restitution ordered.\n\nCollection also depends on enforcement of the court's order of restitution, either by the criminal justice system or the victim. There are many laws and procedures used to make sure the offender pays as ordered.\n\nFor example, where payment of restitution is made a condition of probation or parole, the probation or parole officer must monitor whether payments are being made on time. The victim may help provide this information to the probation or parole officer. If the offender is about to be released from probation or parole, but has not paid restitution as ordered, this information must be conveyed to the court or parole board. Victims who have not received restitution as ordered should ask the probation or parole officer how this information will be provided to the court or parole board. In some states, probation or parole can be extended when the offender has willfully failed to pay restitution.\n\nIn those states with prison work programs, restitution payments are typically collected out of the wages of those programs. Some states collect restitution from state income tax refunds, prisoner accounts, lottery winnings, or damage awards from lawsuits against the prison.\n\nWhere the offender has not paid restitution as ordered-has \"defaulted\" in payment-restitution often can be collected by the same methods used to enforce other court judgments, such as attachments of assets or garnishment of wages. In some states, the victim is authorized to take these actions; in other states, enforcement is up to the prosecutor, the court, or another official.\n\nMany states provide that restitution orders become civil judgments. This expands the ability of victims to collect restitution and also means the orders can stay in effect for many years, typically ten to twenty years. In many jurisdictions, civil judgments can be renewed, so they can stay in effect even longer. During that time, the offender's financial circumstances may change: he or she may have inherited property, won a legal judgment, or become employed. Depending on the state, the civil judgment may be enforceable immediately, or enforceable when the offender defaults on payment, or enforceable only after the criminal justice process is completed and the offender has been released from probation, prison, or parole. A victim may need to hire an attorney to help enforce the civil judgment.\n\nTo find out more about your state's restitution law, contact your state Attorney General, county\/city prosecutor, county probation\/parole office or your local law library: Check in the Blue Pages of your local phone book under the appropriate section heading of either \"Local Governments,\" \"County Governments,\" or \"State Government.\"\n\nAll rights reserved.
