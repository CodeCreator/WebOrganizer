        "text":"Intel Extreme Masters Katowice 2020 has new CS:GO rules\n\nAstralis IEM Katowice 2019\n\nIntel Extreme Masters has updated its rulebook ahead of IEM Katowice next year, and it looks like Vertigo is replacing Cache in the competitive map pool. The rulebook, which dictates what players can and can\u2019t do at the tournament, received several updates this morning.\n\nThe main one, which might not be popular with all the pro players, is that Vertigo will be replacing Cache in the map pool. Although the new and reworked Cache is back in the game, it\u2019s not yet ready for competitive play, and as such Vertigo will be replacing it. This is currently the norm for tournaments at the moment, although it\u2019s quite often vetoed.\n\nBecause of this addition, however, intentional suicides have also been banned by Intel and ESL. Players aren\u2019t allowed to use the \/kill command or deny kills for the opposing team by jumping off the map on Vertigo. Failing a run jump is\u00a0 not counted as part of this rule.\n\nA change to the veto process has also been made to ensure players veto maps in good time before the match, and to ensure that those vetoes aren\u2019t made public until ESL has announced them.\n\nPlayers who join the wrong team at the start of the game will be slapped with a minor penalty point, and any warnings issued to coaches for breaching the excessive communication rule will be carried throughout the tournament now, rather than through a single game. Coaches are only allowed to talk or communicate to the players during tactical pauses or at half time, and if that is breached, a coach will be ejected on the second infringement.\n\nHowever, any coaches known to regularly breach this rule will be given a preemptive warning, and ejected on the first offence.\n\nOther rule changes include punishment for damaging rooms, furniture, or equipment, and ban guidelines for serious offences such as match-fixing.",

(Updated!)\n\nskull trooper skin fortnite\n\nEpic Games\n\nWith the news that Fortnite\u2019s rare Red Knight skin coming back to the item shop, many players are left wondering what skins will remain vaulted and what skins will see a return.\n\nOne skin that many fans have always wondered about and has been growing in popularity is the Skull Trooper skin.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Twitch fan, then you\u2019ve probably seen TSM_Myth rocking the Skull Trooper skin regularly, showcasing its unique design.\n\nThe Skull Trooper skin is from Halloween 2017, before Fortnite was a household name. The Halloween event ran for pretty much the entire duration of Season 2 and was one of the first skins to be introduced into the game.\n\nIt was a simpler time back then, when everyone had the Ghoul and Skull Trooper skin shooting pumpkin rockets.\n\nThere was no telling Fortnite would become so popular so many players likely didn\u2019t want to invest any money for the skins. Fortnite eventually caught fire and a lot of the early skins were locked away form players.\n\nThe return of the Red Knight leads many players wondering one thing: when is the Skull Trooper returning?\n\nAt this point there is no official confirmation whether this skin will return or not. If we do eventually see it come back it would probably be around Halloween since it is a Halloween-themed skin after all.\n\nIt\u2019s possible a similar skin could come back around for Halloween but have it look slightly different as a nod to those who supported the game from the beginning.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the emergence of old skins from the vault will become a trend. If it does then we can probably count on the Skull Trooper coming back one day.\n\nIf you go onto Fortnite\u2019s Twitter page or any big Fortnite player\u2019s Twitter then you\u2019ll see a lot of players claiming to be selling accounts with Skull Troopers on them. If the skin does return then we\u2019ll likely be seeing less of these tweets and less opportunities for players to be scammed.\n\nWould you like the see a return of the Skull Trooper or do you want it to remain rare? Let us know in the comment section below.\n\nSeason 4 of\u00a0Fortnite\u00a0wraps up in mid-July and there has already been a number of clues as to what to expect with the next season. With last week\u2019s rocket launch, we have seen a huge rift created in the sky and now random portals are popping up all over the map.\n\nThe first sighting of the portals was at Lonely Lodge but they have since spread to places like Tomato Town and Retail Row. The tomato head on top of the Tomato Town restaurant has recently fallen victim to a portal. We\u2019ll surely receive more clues and information about Season 5 once the current season winds down.\n\nFortnite: Battle Royale\u00a0is out now on Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Nintendo Switch and PC\u00a0via the Epic Games Launcher.\u00a0For more\u00a0Fortnite: Battle Royale\u00a0coverage, content and guides\u00a0stay with us here at\u00a0Heavy.

Sure, there's a whole crew there, but after talking to them once to see what gossip they had, the vendors were the only ones I went back to. Since Blizzard refuses to take me up on my suggestion to allow fishing from moving boats, it gives me the one more thing to do while waiting for that zone-in screen, aside from chatting and making bandages. Being able to sell trash, stock up on reagents, and sometimes repair during this downtime is really nice.\n\nUnfortunately, the boat vendors have been disabled in a hotfix to the live realms, for vague reasons. Nethaera clarifies that there are \"propulsion issues\" that necessitate the vendors being out for the time being, but that they'll be \"back on duty\" as soon as the issues are fixed. Possibly related is a note that the entire boat crew is gone on the 2.3.2 PTR, \"for testing purposes.\" Hopefully the vendors will be back soon; until then, my boat rides will be (even more) boring.\n\nFrom around the web\n\near iconeye icontext file",

Zoo Rescue sees you flying a helicopter, trying to winch up animals stuck at the bottom of a cliff. Yes, indeed, it\u2019s something of a departure.\n\nThe controls are uber-simple, as you tilt to steer your copter left and right, while tapping the screen for \u2018gas\u2019 to rise (it drops automatically).\n\nThe animals swing around cutely while being winched, and the three-star scoring system feels very Angry Birds, in terms of spurring replayability. There\u2019s also some depth, as you have to collect coins and manage your gas (so to speak) while playing.\n\n20 levels are included, with support for Apple\u2019s Game Center community.

That's why we paired the news with the above photo of upbeat, happy-to-see-you birds! That ... makes it better, right? No?\n\nTo make matters worse, activity on the Phantasy Star Online 2 English Facebook page, as documented by PSO2 Blog, suggests that English-speaking fans living outside of Southeast Asia won't be able to join in due to an IP block for other regions. The page's About section supports this, stating that the English version is published by Asiasoft Online for Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vientam, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nThe appearance of English-based servers would help explain October's rumor, as reported by Massively, of a Western release of PSO2 being unlikely, despite the game being \"fully localized.\" If that localization work was only for servers in Southeast Asia and will never amount to something that would be used stateside, well ... that's a shame. Don't bother emailing Sega to see what's up, either - the status of a Western PSO2 is among the list of things the publisher can't answer.\n[Image: Sega]\n\nGallery: Phantasy Star Online 2 | 11 Photos\n\nFrom around the web\n\near iconeye icontext file",

About 4,000 would-be entrants played in smaller satellite tournaments at the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino Saturday in hopes of winning an entry.\n\n\"I hope that I can survive Day 1,\" said Michael Musich of Highlands Ranch, Colorado, whose wife rooted him on as he played his first hands. \"They get tougher as it goes.\"\n\nMusich played among a field of 771 players with several poker legends, including 1987 and 1988 champion Johnny Chan, who was among the chip leaders after more than six hours. Also playing were 2003 champ Chris Moneymaker, and Antonio Esfandiari, who won an $18.3 million score in 2012 in the series' first ultra-exclusive $1 million buy-in tournament.\n\nFrom millionaire card sharks to home-game amateurs, players stake $10,000 each for a shot to win millions in poker's most popular variant. The no-limit betting rules mean players can wager all their chips at any time, risking their tournament chances in hopes of gaining more chips.\n\nThose who busted on Day 1 included poker professionals Jean-Robert Bellande and Jason Mercier, as well as MTV reality star Trishelle Cannatella.\n\nOnly 10 percent of those who enter the tournament will win any money. Players compete until they bust out or win it all, like Ryan Riess, who won $8.36 million at the main event last year at age 23, topping a field of 6,352 players. Riess played Saturday and nearly doubled his chips after more than six hours of play.\n\nThe main event hasn't offered an 8-figure payday since 2006, when Jamie Gold won $12 million for topping a field of 8,773 players. The only other 8-figure top prizes were won by Esfandiari and Daniel Colman, who won $15.3 million in the series' second-ever $1 million buy-in tournament this week.\n\nSeries officials hope the $10 million guarantee will draw more entrants, a similar tactic that has worked with smaller tournaments this year at the series.\n\nPhil Hellmuth, one of poker's most famous players who won the main event 25 years ago in 1989, said card players are getting better while the tournament has gone through phases of playing styles. But despite a large number of entries making things tougher, Hellmuth said he still sees an opportunity for the game's best players to finish on top.\n\n\"The main event is winnable,\" Hellmuth said.\n\nPoker professional Daniel Negreanu said it's a feat that requires smarts and stamina, plus an ability to perform under the pressure of an atmosphere much different from home games and regular casino games. ESPN films the tournament for 2-hour episodes, and plans to air the final table nearly live in November.\n\n\"I'm comfortable under the lights and the cameras. I think it's actually one of my edges,\" said Negreanu, who enters the main event sitting fourth in the World Series of Poker Player of the Year standings, a measure of how players perform over the entire 65-event series. Negreanu said he prepared for this year's series by getting in the best physical shape of his life and sharpening his mental focus and approach.\n\nThe last nine players will likely play at least 70 hours to reach the final table, over seven sessions of 10 hours each.\n\nJackie Glazier, an Australian player who was the top woman in last year's main event, finishing 31st for more than $229,000, said it doesn't pay to make chancy plays early because even quadrupling your starting chips won't matter much as play wears on.\n\n\"I think slow and steady to start,\" she said.\n\nA handful of players busted early despite the purposely slow structure, gambling chips unnecessarily in spots where their opponents would surely only call with better hands.\n\nJoe Hachem, the 2005 main event winner who won $7.5 million, said at the start of play Saturday that his first thought back when he started his winning run was that he should just refund his $10,000 ticket and leave.\n\n\"But in reality, the only person I have to beat is myself, same as you guys,\" Hachem said.\n\n\nAP photographer John Locher in Las Vegas contributed to this report.\n\n\u00a0Print\u00a0 \u00a0Email\u00a0 \u00a0Comment\u00a0|\u00a0View\u00a00\u00a0Comments\u00a0 \u00a0Most\u00a0Popular\u00a0 \u00a0Save\u00a0 \u00a0Post\u00a0 \u00a0Retweet\n\nYou must be subscribed to participate in discussions\nBy participating in online discussions you acknowledge that you have agreed to the TERMS OF SERVICE.

        "text":"news\\ Jun 18, 2013 at 10:55 am\n\nThe Elder Scrolls Online will not support cross-platform play\n\nThe Elder Scrolls Online\n\nAlthough The Elder Scrolls Online will be available on consoles and PC, the highly anticipated MMORPG will not support cross-platform play.\n\n\"Players will be in their own separate environments. PC players will play with PC players; Xbox will play with Xbox players; and PlayStation with PlayStation,\" lead PvP designer Brian Wheeler told GameZone.\n\nZeniMax Online later confirmed via Twitter that \"The Elder Scrolls Online's megaserver technology will allow PC and Mac players to play together.\" But like Wheeler told us, Xbox One and PS4 players will each have distinct megaservers. Despite the segregation, Wheeler assured us that The Elder Scrolls Online AAA gameplay experience will be the same, regardless of your platform choice.\n\n\"We are not trying to skimp or compromise on quality across any platform,\" he told us.\n\nOne thing Wheeler wasn't able to confirm was how pricing for the MMO will work, particularly on consoles. While many expect the game to require a monthly fee on PC, the fact that it's heading to consoles begs to question whether it will support some free-to-play option. The notion of paying for PS Plus or Xbox LIVE Gold in addition to a monthly MMO subscription sounds a bit risky to me. Especially when Sony is already offering other free-to-play MMOs like DC Universe Online for free.\n\nBe sure to check back later this week for our full interview with ZeniMax Online Studio's Brian Wheeler.\n\nAbout The Author\nIn This Article\nFrom Around The Web\nblog comments powered by Disqus",

        "text":"Archives by Day\n\nColin McRae Rally 2005\n\nPlatform(s): PC, PSP, PlayStation 2, Xbox\nGenre: Racing\nPublisher: Codemasters\nDeveloper: Codemasters\n\nAbout Judy\n\nAs WP's senior editor, I edit review and preview articles, attempt to keep up with the frantic pace of Rainier's news posts, and keep our reviewers on deadline, which is akin to herding cats. When I have a moment to myself and don't have my nose in a book, I like to play action\/RPG, adventure and platforming games.\n\n\n'Colin McRae Rally 2005' Also Coming to the PC - Screens\n\nby Judy on July 20, 2004 @ 9:37 a.m. PDT\n\nPC gamers can prepare to go faster, get muddier, and compete in more off-road events than ever as Codemasters confirms that Colin McRae Rally 2005, the new arrival in the genre-leading series, is coming to PC and sooner than expected!\n\nColin McRae Rally 2005 accelerates the series to a blinding speed that captures the sheer adrenaline of edge-of-control rallying and lets you take the stages at speeds a third faster than before. You won't be spinning off unnecessarily either: the stages have been designed to let you use that speed as you hurtle through the detailed international environments. However, crash out and you'll see the individual damage models for each car in action \u2013 right down to scraping the paintwork!\n\nDelivering more cars, more stages, and new challenges, the adrenaline-pumping heart of Colin McRae Rally 2005 is the all-new multi-discipline Career Challenge. Taking players through their very own, full professional rally career, you'll be driving the most diverse selection of rally cars for different manufacturers.\n\nAn incredible 23 individual rally events provide a personal challenge with real progression and rewards through Challenges, Cups, SuperCups, Shields and Championships as you earn the right to compete with the very best. You're not limited to the car you select at the beginning: choose the cars you drive and the event class as your international rallying prowess increases. Launch your career as a privateer, choose from a selection of 2WD cars and compete in lower-league events.\n\nTake the lead and progress to more powerful cars, taking Part Tests to win upgrades, and accelerate into different classes of championships in new countries. Through the 23 events, with the ultimate goal being to compete at global level, drivers are pummelled through a staggering 300+ stages in cars from 4-wheel drive, 2-wheel drive, 4-wheel Classics, Super 2-wheel, Rear Wheel, Distinctive and 4x4, making it the most complete rally experience ever offered.\n\nIn addition to the Career Challenge, Colin McRae Rally 2005 includes the McRae-centric 4WD Championship where you drive as Colin, choosing the car he competes in through 6 rallies. Then there are the Rally and Stages modes with the complete compendium of 9 international locations including the all-new German rally, which joins the UK, Sweden, USA, Finland, Australia, Spain, Greece, and Japan rallies, each with 8 stages and a shakedown event. Four Super Special stages are also featured. LAN and Online rallying returns and sees up to 8 gamers going head-to-head in single stages, country rallies or custom rallies.\n\nOver 30 cars are fully simulated, using the renowned handling physics, and include the Toyota Celica GT4, Lancia Stratos, Alfa Romeo 147 GTA, Alfetta GTV Turbodelta, Peugeot 206, 205, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII, Escort RS Cosworth, Fiesta concept, Beetle RSi, Golf R32 and 1967 Mini Cooper!\n\nRealistic collision reactions include bending and breaking posts and look out for potholes, loose rocks and other on-stage hazards, all of them dynamic in-game objects with real physics. If you crash into a tree, it'll shudder and drop leaves that flutter to the ground around your car. Mess up your drive seriously and you'll see the new 'dazed' visual effect as you recover from a crash!\n\nAs the king of rally gaming, the Colin McRae Rally series has seen off all pretenders to the throne. Through evolution, refinement and the introduction of fresh rally gaming experiences, Colin McRae Rally 2005 will continue the series' reign and deliver its most exhilarating drive when it launches in late September for PC, alongside the PlayStation 2 and Xbox editions.

        "text":"scroll down\n\nBattlefield 1 Alpha Screenshots Show Lobbies, Loadouts, Server Browser and More\n\nOne brave Reddit user has violated a non-disclosure agreement and leaked a large number of Battlefield 1 alpha screenshots onto the internet.\n\nThese screenshots show off game lobbies, class loadouts, and a server browser that seems to be replacing Battlelog on the PC version of the games. Battlefield 1\u2019s alpha footage is taking place before the game\u2019s official release in October.\n\nThe closed alpha, which only started a little while ago, was exclusively played on the St. Quentin Scar map. Set during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin in 1918, the map takes place around a small village that\u2019s been partially devastated by war, and features the German and British teams. One of the Behemoth superweapons used in it is a massive zeppelin.\n\nThe lobby screenshots actually seem to show a lobby that\u2019s similar to the lobby from Star Wars Battlefront, a smooth, flat design where you choose your game mode of choice rather than having to play what\u2019s on the servers. The two different gametypes that are available in the alpha appear to be Conquest and Domination, both of which I assume are \u201cterritory capture\u201d modes.\n\nOther Battlefield 1 alpha screenshots include shots of the controller and what button does what, the ability to rebind keys if you prefer to play on a keyboard, and the ability to customize your loadouts before you go into battle.\n\nUnfortunately the Reddit user that violated the NDA didn\u2019t show us anything new from the alpha, but at least we\u2019ve got a ton of nice videos to watch for it. Hopefully EA will be showing off some more gameplay from the game before it comes out in October.\n\nHaving some leaked Battlefield 1 alpha screenshots is nice, but it would be even better if we could have some more gameplay screenshots instead of shots of the control scheme and loadouts.",

        "text":"Smash Bros Brawl's Japanese Instruction Booklet hits the Internet?\n\n\nWell, we had to expect that this to would happen. Super Smash Bros Brawl, now set for release in Japan on Jan. 31st, has suffered it's first leak of physical evidence of proving it's actual, factual existence. Super Smash Bros Brawl is real. It's not like Big Foot or El Chubacabra. It's real and it's out there and some one has it, or it least they have it's instruction booklet. The proof is here in these scans, currently posted on Korean gaming site Ruliweb.com.\u00a0\n\nNotably missing from these pages is the profile of one of the series most popular veterans, the one and only Captain Falcon. If these scans are legit, this may be confirmation that Captain Falcon will not be in the game's starting line up, and potentially not in the game at all. However, the recently announced new comer to the series, Olimar, is also missing a profile page. What does it all mean? Like so much of the Brawl info that has come from sources other than Nintendo, are these scans not to be trusted? I leave it to you Internet Matlocks to figure it out.\u00a0\n\nFake or not, these scans aren't likely to be floating around for long. After they catch wind of them, Nintendo of Japan is sure to have them ripped down from the internet faster than you can say \"Falcon Punch!\"\n\nThanks to Jeromy for the heads up. \u00a0\n\nYou are logged out.
