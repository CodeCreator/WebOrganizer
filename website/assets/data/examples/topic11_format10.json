        "text":"EVO 2022 Will Not Have Any Super Smash Bros. Games Because of Nintendo\n\nThis will be the first EVO since 2007 to not have any Super Smash Bros. games.\n\nThis post might contain affiliation links. If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nNintendo has made the decision to not have any Super Smash Bros. game be part of EVO 2022, the world's largest fighting game tournament that is now owned by Sony, for the first time since 2007.\n\nEVO shared a letter announcing the news on Twitter ahead of the EVO 2022 announcement show on March 8 at 5pm PTT\/8pm ET.\n\n\"Please join us March 8 at 5pm PST on twitch.tv\/evo for the EVO 2022 announcement show,\" EVO wrote. \"While we're thankful for all the amazing games joining us later this year in Las Vegas, we want to let you know in advance that Super Smash Bros. will not be making a return appearance.\n\n\"Since 2007, we've seen historic Super Smash Bros. moments created at EVO's events. We are saddened that Nintendo has chosen not to continue that legacy with us this year. In the future, we hope to once again celebrate the Super Smash Bros. community alongside them.\"\n\nNintendo's choice to not be part of EVO follows Sony's purchase of the fighting game tournament in 2021. At the time of the acquisition announcement, Nintendo said that it wishes the show's organizers the best and that it will continue to assess EVO in the future. That decision, at least for now, appears to have been made.\n\nThis move also could be due to Nintendo partnering with Panda Global for the first officially licensed series of Super Smash Bros. eSports tournaments in North America.\n\n\"Nintendo has enjoyed engaging with fans at past Evo tournaments and wish the show organizers the best with their new venture. We will continue to assess Evo, and other opportunities, as we plan for future online and offline Super Smash Bros. tournament activity.\u201d A spokesperson for Nintendo said in March 2021.\n\nEVO 2022 is currently set to take place from August 5-7 in Las Vegas.\n\nSo, not only will 2022 be the first year without new Super Smash Bros. Ultimate content as in 2021 Sora was the final DLC fighter to be released, but fans will also have to look elsewhere to see competitive Smash battles.\n\nFor more on this ongoing situation, check out our look at the rocky history between Nintendo and its esports communities.\n\nHave a tip for us?

        "text":"Sega\u2019s Latest Shenmue Video Goes Back To The Actual Dobuita Street\n\nBy Jenni . July 13, 2018 . 9:00am\n\n\n\nShenmue is like the Yakuza series, in that the game takes inspiration from actual locations in the real world. To help promote Shenmue I & II HD, Sega put together a new video that looks at the real Dobuita Street in Yokosuka, Japan. This is where people spend a lot of time in the original game, as it is Ryo\u2019s hometown.\n\n\nThe footage for the Shenmue: Return to Dobuita Street video was actually recorded back on April 13, 2018. The hosts are comedian Imran Yusuf and YouTuber Adam Koralik. Both of them had made quite a big deal about their being present for SegaFes 2018 back in April, with Yusuf even noting the two had been in Yokosuka together on Twitter. The two visit places seen in the game in the video and talk about their memories with Shenmue.\n\n\n\nShenmue I & II HD will be coming to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on August 21, 2018.\n\nRead more stories about & & & on Siliconera.\n\nVideo game stories from other sites on the web.

        "text":"One of the Metal Gear Solid series' trademarks is the option to complete the game without killing a single human being. Despite Metal Gear Solid: Rising's gloriously gory debut trailer, you can clear it too without registering one kill.\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Rising producer Shigenobu Matsuyama says that he's trying to change the series with the new one starring cyborg ninja Raiden. He thinks it might change so much that it will spawn two distinct lines of Metal Gear games, one with the patient stealth style Snake prefers, one with a high-speed stealth of Rising's Raiden.\n\n\n\nMatsuyama wants to find new Metal Gear fans this way, something \"easier to understand for first-time users.\"\n\nOne thing he won't change is the option for a no-kill completion. I asked Matsuyama about the ultra-violent limb-severing action seen in Metal Gear Solid: Rising's E3 2010 trailer, something some players will never have to see.\n\n\"I believe that MGS has a key stealth element in not trying to kill anyone,\" Matsuyama says. \"You could actually have a no-kill completion [in Rising]. There will be a lot of mechs and cyborgs, but if you slice them up, that will be considered as a no-kill as well. You'll have the freedom of killing humans, of course, but you can proceed through the game without killing a human being, but slicing up mechs and cyborgs.\"\n\n\nMatsuyama also talked about the option of cutting the weapons and ammunition of enemies, rendering them defenseless. That awesome display of the power of Raiden's high frequency blade will be intimidating enough to make some enemies run away. However...\n\n\"You could maybe accidentally cut human enemies,\" he noted. \"We have to think about the violence and the morals behind it. I would like to add the expression of the pain [enemies feel] as well... not just make a slice 'em up, dice 'em up.\"\n\nThat \"expression of pain,\" Matsuyama adds, isn't necessarily meant to make the player feel bad about their choices, but an illustration of the reality of the player's actions. Matsuyama says he's aware of the guidelines and ratings that might limit the graphic display of violence. But, he says, \"I don't feel its correct that if we only change the color of blood or blur the scene\" to mask that violence.\n\n\"I will put the essence of the beauty of the no-kill,\" he says. \"I want to emphasize that I will never reward a player for killing human beings in the game. I won't make it easier to clear the game [that way]. I will probably make it more difficult.\"\n\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Rising doesn't currently have a release date, but hopefully we'll learn more about the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game, what else is changing and what isn't, at this year's Tokyo Game Show.",

Meath to check their accounts and emails this morning as the lucky online player is Ireland\u2019s newest millionaire.\n\nA National Lottery spokesperson said:\u00a0\u201cThis morning, imagine getting up out of bed as normal, making yourself a cup of coffee and then checking those emails, as so many of us do. Imagine if one of those emails announced that you are a millionaire! Well that is what may have happened to one person registered in Co Meath. So if you are from Meath and have a National Lottery online account, what are you waiting for? Check those emails or log onto your account to see if you are \u20ac1,000,000 richer.\u201d\n\nThe winning Lotto Plus 1 numbers from last night\u2019s draw (Wednesday 20th\u00a0May) are:\u00a006, 12, 26, 30, 41, 45\u00a0and the Bonus number is:\u00a027.\n\nThe National Lottery spokesperson continued:\u00a0\u201cIf you have discovered that you are our newest millionaire please contact our prize claims team on 1800 666 222 or email\u00a0and we will make arrangements for you to collect your prize, once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, in the National Lottery Winner\u2019s Room in Dublin.\u201d\n\nThis lucky winner from the Royal County is the 5th Lotto Plus 1 top prize winner, of \u20ac1,000,000, this year and is the eleventh Lotto millionaire created so far in 2020. To date, almost \u20ac54 million has been won in prizes in all Lotto games this year.\n\nThere was no winner of the Lotto jackpot worth \u20ac2,789,321, which rolls to an estimated \u20ac3.2 million for next Saturday\u2019s draw.\n\nWith more than 77,000 winners in last night\u2019s Lotto draw, the National Lottery has reminded players that it has extended the period of time that lucky winners can collect prizes to encourage people to stay at home and not require them to make any unnecessary journeys during the current public health emergency.\n\nThis means that any lucky winners of Lotto and Lotto Plus, Lotto 54321, EuroMillions and EuroMillions Plus, Telly Bingo, Daily Millions and Daily Millions Plus draws from 9th January 2020 until draws in the week 5th July 2020 will have an extra three months in which they can claim their prize. The prize claims extension applies to winners who purchased their tickets and scratch card games in-store, online at\u00a0and via the National Lottery App.\n\nNearly 30 cent in every \u20ac1 spent on all National Lottery games goes back to Good Causes in the areas of sport, youth, health, welfare, education, arts, heritage and the Irish Language. In total more than \u20ac5.6 Billion has been raised for Good Causes since the National Lottery as established 32 years ago. In 2019 alone, \u20ac250 million was raised for local Good Causes in communities across Ireland.",

It's up to Sora and friends to help defend the world.\n\n\"Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be our first full HD game in our current console generation\", he continued. Based off these screenshots, Hercules, Tangled and Big Hero 6 will also be apart of the Kingdom Hearts.\n\nHe was keen to emphasize that it hasn't been problems with development or any choices made by him or his team that have caused Kingdom Hearts 3 to take so long. \"And so after, perhaps, maybe we can start thinking about other possibilities\".\n\nKingdom Hearts 3 is, at long last, scheduled to be released in 2018. Unfortunately, no specific release date was announced by its developer. This is not common because another character in the game will present a different perspective and that is key information that unlocks the mystery behind KH3's story.\n\n\"Just looking at the trailer, I feel Sora really fit in and matched well with that world, and it's something I always personally wanted to see - that image of Buzz and Woody coming face to face with Sora in his toy form\", Nomura said.\n\nUnlike previous games in the series, the party of Kingdom Hearts 3 may include more than two additional characters. The game is said to feature ultra-polished visuals and a more engaging battle system, according to The Verge. UE4 is mostly used on popular and latest games that are released on the PS4, Xbox One, and the PC.",
