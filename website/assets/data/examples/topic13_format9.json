        "text":"A Guide To Mexico\u2019s Aztec Ruins\n\nA Guide To Mexico\u2019s Aztec Ruins\nModern Mexico City is built atop the sinking lake and ruins that once formed part of the Aztec Empire\u2019s principal city; Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Arguably one of the most significant and well-known of the ethnic groups that existed in Mesoamerica, the Nahuatl-speaking, central Mexican Aztecs left Mexico awash with fascinating ruins which attest to their technological advancement and immense ruling power. This group is best known in pop culture for their tendency to sacrifice humans, but don\u2019t let that deter you from visiting some of Mexico\u2019s best Aztec ruins. Here\u2019s our guide.\n\nTeotihuac\u00e1n, State of Mexico\n\nUndeniably the best known of the Aztec ruins is Teotihuac\u00e1n. Located just outside of central Mexico City, in the surrounding State of Mexico, this archaeological site features the two iconic and towering pyramids, known as the Temple of the Moon and the Temple of the Sun respectively. Arriving at the site, you\u2019re met with the Avenue of the Dead, which leads you through what little of the sprawling site has been uncovered by archaeologists, and culminates with the Temple of the Moon. A must-visit for even the casual visitor, this is Mexico\u2019s most emblematic Aztec ruin.\n\nPir\u00e1mides de Teotihuac\u00e1n, San Juan Teotihuac\u00e1n de Arista, Estado de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico, +52 594 958 2081\n\nTemplo Mayor, Mexico City\n\nAnother incredibly well-known ruin is the Templo Mayor, which takes up residence right in the heart of Mexico City\u2019s historic centre. Literally situated next to the imposing cathedral, on the far corner of the z\u00f3calo, stones from this ruin were alleged to have been used in the construction of the aforementioned cathedral. Formerly one of the main temples in the ancient city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, this is now one of Mexico City\u2019s biggest tourist attractions, and is dedicated to both Tlaloc (God of Rain) and Huitzilopochtli (God of War).\n\nSeminario 8, Centro Hist\u00f3rico, Cuauht\u00e9moc, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico, +52 55 4040 5600\n\nSanta Cecilia Acatitl\u00e1n, State of Mexico\n\nThis lesser known Aztec ruin is situated in the State of Mexico, in a town today known as Santa Cecelia. In Mesoamerican times, it was actually located on the northwest shore of Lake Texcoco and is an excellent remaining example of early Aztec architecture. As with many other Aztec monuments, the Spanish Christians destroyed much of it so the stone could be used for churches. However, this site was once associated closely with the political and religious centre at the time, making it well worth a visit for the Aztec history buff.\n\nAztec inspired artwork \u00a9 Se\u00f1or Codo\/Flickr\n\nTenayuca, State of Mexico\n\nLocated in San Bartolo Tenayuca, this is the religious and political hub with which Santa Cecilia Acatitl\u00e1n was once associated and is also an example of the earliest Chichamec capital city. However, the style of the architecture is distinctly Aztec. Translating to \u2018walled place\u2019 in Nahuatl, the archaeological site of Tenayuca was discovered in 1925 and nowadays includes (like the Templo Mayor), temples dedicated to Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli. However, it is replete with far more serpent artwork and detailing than the Templo Mayor.\n\nCalle Quetzalcoatl S\/N, San Bartolo Tenayuca, Tlalnepantla, Estado de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico, +52 722 215 8569\n\nEl Tepozteco\n\nRuins, Park\nOur final mention on the guide to Aztec ruins is also the only one located outside of greater Mexico City. Found in Morelos, El Tepozteco is a tiny site which features a temple dedicated to the Mesoamerican god of the alcoholic drink pulque.Speculation reigns supreme at this site, with archaeologists asserting that glyphs found there suggest it was built in 1502, and others saying that these glyphs were additions that merely commemorated the death of Aztec ruler Ahuizotl, who died in 1502.\nMore Info",

Vietnam remains one of the world\u2019s largest motorbike markets.\n\nWhat are two facts about Vietnam?\n\n20 Astounding Facts About Vietnam\n\n  \u2022 Vietnam is actually a combination of two words, Viet and Nam, both of which predate the common era by at least a thousand years. \u2026\n  \u2022 Sitting at 3143 metres, Fansipan is Vietnam\u2019s tallest mountain. \u2026\n  \u2022 Among certain niche circles, Vietnam is referred to as \u2018The King Of Cashews\u2019\n\nWhat are 3 interesting facts about Vietnam War?\n\nHere are 10 facts that you probably did not know about the Vietnam War:\n\n  \u2022 President Kennedy wanted to get the US Army out of Vietnam. \u2026\n  \u2022 The US didn\u2019t lose the war on-ground. \u2026\n  \u2022 The US troops preferred to use AK-47\u2019s over government issues M-16\u2019s. \u2026\n  \u2022 The war wasn\u2019t just between US and Vietnam.\n\nWhat are some interesting facts about Vietnam for kids?\n\n\n  \u2022 OFFICIAL NAME: Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n  \u2022 FORM OF GOVERNMENT: Socialist republic.\n  \u2022 CAPITAL: Hanoi.\n  \u2022 POPULATION: 97,040,334.\n  \u2022 OFFICIAL LANGUAGE: Vietnamese.\n  \u2022 MONEY: Dong.\n  \u2022 AREA: 127,123 square miles (329,247 square kilometers)\n  \u2022 MAJOR MOUNTAIN RANGE: Annam Cordiller.\nTHIS IS INTERESTING:\u00a0 Do I need visa to go to Cambodia from Philippines?\n\nWhat makes Vietnamese unique?\n\nVietnam is a country of contrasts due to its geography. This makes the country unique as it offers travelers the ability to experience a multitude of landscapes. From the rice-cultivating tropical lowlands, to the rich-soiled, coffee-producing highlands, Vietnam offers a unique and varied travel experience.\n\nHow old is Vietnamese?\n\nAncient History\n\nVietnam has one of the oldest and most continuous histories of any nation. The area has been inhabited by some of the world\u2019s earliest societies. The needs to control flooding along the Red River and fight off invaders caused the inhabitants to form one cohesive government early on in 2879 BC.\n\nWhat language do Vietnamese speak?\n\nThe term Vietnam dates from the early 19th century, when the Nguyen dynasty was founded. The Vietnamese government of this time was on very close terms with China, and the name was probably a compound derived from Dai Viet and Annam. Like the Chinese before them, modern colonial powers also avoided the term Viet.\n\nIs Vietnam a poor country?\n\nIn 1990, Vietnam was among the world\u2019s poorest countries with a GDP per capita of $98. \u2026 Vietnam is now defined as a lower middle income country by the World Bank.

This marks the official beginning of American involvement in the war as recognized by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\n\nWhat was unique about the Vietnam War?\n\nIt resulted in nearly 60,000 American deaths and an estimated 2 million Vietnamese deaths. It was the first war to come into American living rooms nightly, and the only conflict that ended in defeat for American arms. The war caused turmoil on the home front, as anti-war protests became a feature of American life.\n\nWhen was Vietnam discovered?\n\nAccording to mythology, the first ruler of Vietnam was Hung Vuong, who founded the nation in 2879 B.C. China ruled the nation then known as Nam Viet as a vassal state from 111 B.C. until the 15th century, an era of nationalistic expansion, when Cambodians were pushed out of the southern area of what is now Vietnam.\n\nDoes Vietnam have snow?\n\nThe only snow in Vietnam falls in the northern mountainous regions of the country. It doesn\u2019t snow in the town of Sapa often but the top of Mount Fansipan can get dusted with snow. Parts of the Annamite Range, possibly the most beautiful mountains we\u2019ve ever seen, can also get snow between December and February.\n\nWhat continent is Vietnam?\n\nlisten)), officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, is a country in Southeast Asia. Located at the eastern edge of mainland Southeast Asia, it covers 311,699 square kilometres.\n\nTHIS IS INTERESTING:\u00a0 What are the factors affecting weather patterns in the Philippines?",

        "text":"9 Kickass Women in Philippine History You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\n\nLast Updated on\n\nSome Filipinas in history went beyond their motherly roles just to prove their bad-assness. Most of their names have been forgotten, but their achievements will definitely blow your minds.\n\nRelated Article:\u00a014 Amazing Filipina Heroines You Don\u2019t Know But Should\n\nHere are 9 of the most amazing lesser-known Filipinas who blazed a trail and made their own mark in Philippine history:\n\n\n1. Leona Florentino.\n\nLeona Florentino\nStatue of Leona Florentino at Crisologo Street, Heritage Village, Vigan City, Ilocos Sur, Philippines. Photo Credit: eazytraveler via Flickr.\n\nAlso known as Mother of Philippine Women\u2019s Literature.\n\nExtraordinary moments:\u00a0Leona Florentino (1849-1884) became the first internationally recognized Filipina poet at a time when Philippine society was largely patriarchal. Born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, Florentino started to write poems at the age of ten. Her works\u2013written in Ilocano and some in Spanish\u2013include\u00a0Naangawan A Kablaaw (\u201cA Jolly Birthday Greeting\u201d) and Nalpay A Namnama (\u201cBlasted Hope\u201d).\n\nA prolific poetess, satirist, and playwright, Florentino braved all adversities to express her creativity\u2013sometimes even at the expense of her family. It is said that due to her feminist views, her husband and son opposed her writing. For this reason, Florentino was forced to leave her family and had since led a life of solitude until her untimely death in 1884 at the age of 35.\n\nFlorentino\u2019s 22 poems were later exhibited posthumously in the\u00a0Exposicion General de Filipinas\u00a0(Madrid, 1887),\u00a0Exposition Internationale\u00a0(Paris, 1889), and\u00a0St. Louis International Exposition (Missouri, 1904). Her name, as well as her works, were also represented in Madame Andzia Wolska\u2019s anthology, Bibliotheque Internationale des Oeuvres de Femmes, edited in 1889.\n\nInteresting facts:\n\n  \u2022 Leona Florentino\u2019s ancestral home in Vigan City, Ilocos Sur now houses the\u00a0Provincial Tourism Center, the Vigan Heritage Commission, and the famous Caf\u00e9 Leona.\n  \u2022 She was a distant cousin of Jose Rizal, Philippines\u2019 national hero.\n  \u2022 She was the mother of Isabelo de los Reyes, a labor activist and founder of the Aglipayan or Philippine Independent Church. Like his mother, De los Reyes was also a talented writer. In fact, he is considered as the Father of Philippine Folklore. Among his works include\u00a0Ti Langit Ti Inanamatayo (\u201cThe Glory of our Hopes\u201d), the first short story in Iluko.\n\nDid you know? President Ferdinand Marcos\u00a0was baptized into the Aglipayan Church.\n\n\n2. Encarnacion Alzona.\n\nEncarnacion Alzona\nEncarnacion Alzona. Source: Ateneo Library of Women\u2019s Writings\n\nAlso known as The first Filipina historian and also the first Filipina to obtain a doctoral degree.\n\nExtraordinary moments: In an era when Filipinas were somehow considered intellectually inferior to Filipino men, a woman named Encarnacion Alzona (1895-2001) refused to be defeated. Her fight for gender equality opened a lot of opportunities for women that would not have been possible if she had refused to take a leap of faith.\n\nIn 1919, Alzona participated in the\u00a0pensionado\u00a0program of the American government which, for the first time in many years, provided equal opportunities for middle- and upper-class Filipinas to study in the US. She eventually earned a master\u2019s degree from Radcliffe College as well as a Ph.D. degree from Columbia University in 1923, the first Filipina to do so. Her achievements gave her the necessary credentials to serve as the\u00a0chairperson of the Department of History in U.P.\n\nEven while pursuing her career, Alzona never stopped fighting for women\u2019s rights. Believing that education is the key to gender equality, Alzona helped other Filipinas\u2013including Fe del Mundo, then a medical student\u2013to pursue studies in the US. She also fought for Filipinas\u2019 right of suffrage, going as far as hosting tea parties for members of the Legislature just to convince them to grant such right.\n\nFortunately, her efforts soon paid off. In September of 1937, the election bill that grants the right to vote to all citizens (male and female, 21 years of age and who can read and write) finally became a law.\n\nInteresting facts:\n\n  \u2022 As a historian, Alzona\u2019s most prominent works include\u00a0\u201cThe Filipino Woman: Her Social and Political Status 1565-1933,\u201d\u00a0published in 1934 as part of the campaign for woman suffrage in the country, and \u201cA History of Education in the Philippines: 1565-1930,\u201d\u00a0her first book that was released in 1932.\n  \u2022 Alzona was elected\u00a0Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on Social Science, Philosophy, and Humanities during the 1946 meeting of the UNESCO in Paris.\n  \u2022 In 1985, she received her highest award when she was given the\u00a0distinction of National Scientist by the National Academy of Science and Technology.\n\n\n3. Pelagia Mendoza.\n\nPelagia Mendoza\nPelagia Mendoza on the cover of La Ilustracion Filipina.\n\nAlso known as The first known Filipina sculptor in history.\n\nExtraordinary moments:\u00a0Pelagia Mendoza y Gotianquin (1867-1939)\u00a0stood out for excelling in the male-dominated field of sculpture. She was the first female student ever accepted at the\u00a0Academia de Dibujo y Pintura, known as the first and only coeducational institution during the Spanish regime.\n\nWith an exceptional flair for painting, embroidery, and sculpture, Mendoza entered the prestigious school at the age of 22. With the help of her mentors Agustin Saez and Lorenzo Rocha, Mendoza\u2019s artistic mastery grew by leaps and bounds, culminating to her award-winning entry to the\u00a0Columbus Quadricentennial Art Contest,\u00a0a competition organized by the Spanish Government in 1892.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a07 Most Unintentionally Terrifying Statues In The Philippines\n\nMendoza\u2019s winning artwork\u2013a wax bust of\u00a0Christopher Columbus\u2013also reaped other international awards such as\u00a0the second prize at the 1892 Chicago Universal Exposition, making her the first Filipina artist to gain international recognition.\n\nInteresting facts:\n\n  \u2022 Pelagia Mendoza married\u00a0Crispulo Zamora, a silversmith and her former classmate at the\u00a0\u00a0Academia de Dibujo y Pintura.\u00a0To support their seven children, the couple established an engraving business,\u00a0Crispulo Zamora and Sons, Inc., which became known for religious jewelry and ornaments.\n  \u2022 After her husband\u2019s death in 1922, Mendoza took over the business. By traveling to different countries and studying the different carving techniques used in those places, Mendoza was able to help modernize the metal-working and engraving industry in the Philippines.\n  \u2022 All of Mendoza\u2019s works\u2013including the award-winning bust\u2013were destroyed when her family home\u00a0at Sta. Cruz was bombed during WWII.\n\n\n4. Olivia Salamanca.\n\nOlivia Salamanca\nOlivia Salamanca in Filipino dress. Source: The Diary of\nOlivia Salamanca, M.D.,\n1889-1913 by Encarnacion Alzona, Ph.D.\n\nAlso known as\u00a0Pioneer Woman Physician of the Philippines.\n\nExtraordinary moments:\u00a0In 1910, Salamanca obtained the degree of doctor of medicine from the\u00a0Women\u2019s Medical College in Philadelphia. Therefore, she was the second Filipina to become a physician after\u00a0Dr. Honoria Acosta-Sison who graduated from the same school in 1909.\n\nSalamanca was among the pensionados who qualified and were chosen by the government to study in the US in 1905. She was sent to St.\u00a0Paul, Minn. to finish the secondary course and later to\u00a0Women\u2019s Medical College where she fulfilled her dreams of becoming a physician. Salamanca graduated on June 1, 1910, at the age of 20 and also passed the civil service examination in the same year.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a034 Facts You Didn\u2019t Know About Philippine First Ladies\n\nTo give back to her countrymen, Salamanca returned to the Philippines and served as the first\u00a0secretary\u00a0of the Philippine Antituberculosis Society. At the time, potent anti-TB drugs were not available yet, so Salamanca and other medical professionals had to care for their patients at the expense of their own health.\n\nEventually, Salamanca was also diagnosed with tuberculosis. Despite her deteriorating health, she still led an active life, travelling back and forth between Philippines and Hongkong until her untimely death in 1913 at the age of 24.\n\nInteresting facts:\n\n  \u2022 Salamanca was one of the first Filipinos to\u00a0be subjected to the use of tuberculin in the treatment of tuberculosis. However, her health had not improved.\n  \u2022 She was a child prodigy. In fact, she was able to play the piano without the guidance of a teacher.\u00a0Maestro Manuel Ruiz y Javier, her elder sister\u2019s teacher, was so impressed by her that he composed\u00a0a mazurka entitled \u201cOlivia.\u201d\n  \u2022 To honor her contributions as a pioneer Filipino physician, the\u00a0Philippine Medical Women\u2019s Association named the place at the corner\u00a0of General Luna and T. Kalaw as \u201cPlaza Olivia Salamanca.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: How to Become a Doctor in the Philippines\n\n\n5.

She spent most of her early twenties nursing the wounded and providing vital intelligence information to the Allied forces. Indeed, she was the ultimate Filipina spy.\n\nAlso Read:\u00a06 Badass Filipina Warriors You Never Heard Of\n\nOnce a deaconess to evangelical churches, Magdalena was forced to take over a new role when the American soldiers from the Japanese-occupied Baguio City chose to retreat to her hometown. She assisted\u00a0Reverend Nagel of the United Evangelical Church who became the chaplain to the American soldiers led by\u00a0Colonel John Horan. She also served as an interpreter between English and Ilokano\/Kalinga speakers.\n\nAfter the Fall of Corregidor in 1942, Magdalena was imprisoned together with Horan\u2019s troops. She was later freed and subsequently joined the guerrilla\u00a0Fil-American Irregular Troops (FAIT) in Manila. In January of 1944,... (truncated)",

        "text":"Early Conquests: 7 Pivotal Battles that Shaped Early Rome\n\nPosted on\n\nAccording to tradition, Rome was founded by Romulus in 753 BC, although excavations have revealed that a wall was built in the area of the city centuries before the official year of foundation. Modern historians suggest the city was founded a little later but regardless of when it was established, Rome was to become the greatest city in ancient history.\n\nLegend has it that seven kings ruled the city until the Roman Republic was formed in 509 BC when the people took power from Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. From that point onward, Rome started to expand into other regions and ultimately formed one of the greatest empires of all time. Much is written about Roman conquest from the Second Punic War onwards, but less is known about its early history. In this article, I will look at 7 important battles in the early Roman Republic which end just before the Second Punic War. As I covered the Pyrrhic War in another piece, I have not included the battles of Heraclea and Asculum.\n\n1 \u2013 Battle of Silvia Arsia (509 BC)\n\nThe Battle of Silvia Arsia was fought between the Etruscan forces of the Tarquinii and Veii and the republican forces of ancient Rome. It was the first failed attempt by Tarquin to regain the throne after he was overthrown in 509 BC. Also known as Tarquin the Proud, the former king ruled as a tyrant, and his actions angered Romans to the point where they decided to abolish the monarchy and form a Republic.\n\nAccording to legend, one of Tarquin\u2019s sons, Sextus, raped Lucretia, the daughter of the prefect of Rome. After the event, she told her father before committing suicide. The Roman people were so angered by the king\u2019s abuse of power that they declared it was better to die in defense of their liberty than to allow tyrants to rule. One of the city\u2019s leading citizens, Brutus, proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome. A general election was held, and the people voted for a republic. Brutus took armed men to find the king, but Tarquin fled with his family into exile.\n\nHowever, he wanted his throne back and gained the support of the Etruscan cities of Veii and Tarquinii by reminding them of their territorial losses at the hands of the Roman state. He led his army against the Republican forces commanded by Brutus and Publius Valerius Publicola at the Silvia Arsia, which was a forest near the city of Rome. Tarquin\u2019s son Aruns led the monarchy\u2019s cavalry and charged at the enemy cavalry, led by Brutus. The two men apparently speared one another to death.\n\nAlthough the right wing of both armies found success, Tarquin was forced to flee the field. Valerius returned to Rome and was given a hero\u2019s welcome. The city also held a magnificent funeral for the fallen Brutus. According to Livy, Valerius fought the Veii soon after Silvia Arsia but does not give details of what happened. Tarquin had failed in his initial attempt to reclaim his crown, and this battle marked the beginning of the Roman Republic. However, the deposed king was not finished yet.\n\nPrev1 of 7Next\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"6 Unexpected Facts about Albert Einstein\n\n6 Unexpected Facts about Albert Einstein\n\nMuch is known about the iconic, brilliant scientist with the wild eyes and white hair. Some of Albert Einstein\u2019s quotes and accomplishments are common knowledge, including his Nobel Prize win for physics in 1921 and this poignant quote: \u2018Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is to never stop questioning.\u2019 Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on 14 March, 1879. He revolutionised the field of physics as we know it and formulated the world\u2019s most famous equation: E = mc2. As with every brilliant mind, there is more to Einstein than common knowledge can tell us. In celebration of his recent birthday, here are 10 surprising things about Albert Einstein.\n\nMusic was his biggest joy in life\n\nDeeply fascinated with science and how the universe works, Einstein dedicated his life to scientific discovery. But did you know he was a passionate violinist? Quoted as saying \u2018I get most joy in life out of music\u2019, Einstein played since the age of six. His second wife Elsa claimed he liked to take breaks from his studies to play violin, because it relaxed him and helped him think.\nHe declined an offer to be president of Israel\n\nOn 17 November, 1952, Einstein received a letter asking if he would accept the offer for the presidency of Israel. His response was cordial and diplomatic, claiming that although he was \u2018deeply moved by the offer \u2026 I cannot accept it.\u2019 Having dedicated his life to \u2018objective matters\u2019 he felt he lacked \u2018the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official functions\u2019.\n\nAn illegal autopsy was performed on Einstein\u2019s body\n\nPathologist Doctor Thomas Stolz Harvey performed the autopsy following Einstein\u2019s death. Normal procedure\u2014except that no paperwork has ever been found that gave permission for the autopsy. Against Einstein\u2019s final wishes to be cremated whole, Einstein\u2019s eyes were removed (they remain somewhere in a safe deposit box in New York City) and Harvey also removed his brain, which he allegedly kept for 50 years.\n\nHe inspired the look of Yoda\n\nStar Wars fans would be delighted to know that the green, 4 ft. tall Jedi Master\u2019s face was inspired by Albert Einstein\u2019s own unique look. Special effects artist Nick Maley says he had a picture of Einstein in his office and chose to incorporate Yoda\u2019s wrinkles and white hair to resemble the scientist.\n\nHe didn\u2019t believe in God\n\nOne of Einstein\u2019s most famous quotes has encouraged people to think he believed in God: \u2018God does not play dice with the universe.\u2019 He wrote in 1954 that he did not \u2018believe in a personal God\u2019 but likened his \u2018unbounded admiration for the structure of the world\u2019 to a religious worship. In the famous quote, Einstein was referring to subatomic particles and their unpredictable nature. \u2018God\u2019 and \u2018dice\u2019 were simply elegant metaphors.\n\nHe declined life-saving surgery\n\nWhen Einstein died in on 17 April 1955, the world mourned his loss. Experiencing internal bleeding due to the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurism, Einstein\u2019s statement in his refusal of surgery showcases his stubborn yet profound and philosophical nature: \u2018I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\u2019",

Curse of Otzi\n\nIn 1991, a group of climbers went to conquer one of the Alpine peaks in the Otztal Valley, found in the ice half vmerzshie human remains. Deciding that it was one of the victims of avalanches and blizzards, climbers have learned body with ice axes and sent to the morgue. Examining the corpse, pathologists concluded: the man was a resident of the Bronze Age and lay in the mountains at least 5300 years.\n\nIce prisoner named Otzi, and scientists came to the conclusion that he was killed by a blow to the head, which caused him to unknown pursuers, and, when found, Otzi still clutched in the hands of a flint knife.\n\nAfter some time, the people involved in this incident, suddenly began to die: Rainer Henn, the medical examiner who examined the body, was killed in a car accident a year after the events shortly thereafter avalanche claimed the life of Kurt Fritz \u2013 a guide who led the transportation of the body. Mountaineer Helmut Simon, first discovered Otzi died in 2004, roughly in the same area, fell into the abyss.\n\nAlmost immediately after the funeral of Simon, died of a heart attack, the head of the rescue team, look for it \u2013 Dieter Warnecke. In April 2005, died of a stroke, Professor Konrad Spindler of Innsbruck University, who led the team of scientists who have examined the ECR.\n\nCan be regarded as a series of deaths coincidence, but in general, if we consider that this story had a ratio of hundreds of people in the death of several of them for 20 years cannot be anything supernatural.\n\n2. Curse of the Pharaohs\n\nAccording to some reports, at the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun was found a stone with the inscription Death on swift wings overtake the one who disturbed the peace of the Pharaoh, but possessed Egyptologists Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon that did not stop: in 1922 it was officially announced the sensational discovery . Shortly visited the tomb began to die one after another.\n\nLord Carnarvon died from the bite of a mosquito that caused blood poisoning and pneumonia, four months after he first entered the crypt. I must say, in the last months of his life he did not differ good health. A few hours after his death in England, yelp, gave up the ghost pet dog Lord \u2013 Susie.\n\nAmerican financier George Gould, who visited the tomb, caught a fever and died six months after his visit to the Tutankhamen.

Just a few days after the death of Lord Carnarvon was poisoned with arsenic member of the archaeological team Carter Arthur Mace. Not escaped death and personal secretary to Carter, who was found strangled in his bed in 1929.\n\nWhatever it was, many of the members of the expedition Carter opened the tomb lived a long and happy life, and a number of possible causes of death of the other scientists called toxic mold and bacteria that lived in the tomb for thousands of years before the archaeologists have violated their privacy.\n\n3. The Curse of Tamerlane\n\nThe legendary Central Asian conqueror Tamerlane and commander (Timur) was the initiator of the military campaigns, which killed a total of about 17 million.

Everyone knows what happened next \u2013 June 22, Adolf Hitler\u2019s army invaded the Soviet Union.\n\nBy the way, when in 1942, Stalin ordered to return the remains of the tomb of Tamerlane and buried with all due rites, German forces surrendered at Stalingrad, which was one of the turning points in World War II.\n\n4.

The postman who delivered the package to the museum with a stone, was hit by a truck, but survived, but died soon after his wife and beloved dog, and the house burned down the postman.\n\nCoincidence? Curse? Unknown\u2026\n\n5. Curse of Tippecanoe\n\nXIX-th century in American history is marked by numerous conflicts and clashes with government forces the indigenous Indian population.\n\nIn one of the largest local wars of this kind was killed Shawnee chieftain Tecumseh. Dying, the proud son of Indian people cursed future US presidents, who are elected or re-elected in a year divisible by 20. Tecumseh foretold that the rulers of the United States will die or be killed before the end of the presidential term.\n\nArgued that the curse acted to the seventh generation. The first victim was the leader of the posthumous wishes of President William Henry Harrison, elected in 1840 \u2013 he died of pneumonia a month after the inauguration. It was Harrison, being the first governor of Indiana, defeated the troops of Tecumseh in Battle of Tippecanoe, which became fatal for the Indians.\n\nAnother damned became Abraham Lincoln was elected to his first term in 1860, re-elected in 1864, and he was killed in 1865 shot in the head.\n\nThird in the black list Tecumseh was destined to become James A. Garfield: elected in 1880, the year after his inauguration in March 1881 he stayed in office less than six months, died from complications after being shot in the back, made a psychopath Charles Guiteau.\n\nFourth proved William McKinley, who became president in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.

One of the games, Cubs even came nephew Billy Sam Sianis, of course, taking with him a goat, but it did not give results.\n\nThe story of the goat, he took from baseball club success, seen by many as a joke, but true fans of baseball\u2019s no laughing matter.

        "text":"Weird History How Firing Squads Have Worked Throughout History\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAaron Edwards\n169.1k\u00a0views 21 items\n\nAs soon as mankind learned to shoot, it figured out how to use that power to kill. The history of shooting squads is very long, though\u00a0the practice is quickly becoming a relic of the past. If you're wondering \"when did shooting squads start?\" or \"how did shooting squads start?\", hold your horses, that information is coming, along with a number of other fascinating facts and anecdotes about the history of firing squads.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe invention of gunpowder (and\u00a0the firearms that use\u00a0it) was\u00a0the catalyst for firing squads\u00a0becoming\u00a0the standard method of execution for militaries across\u00a0centuries. Many traitors, spies, and war criminals\u00a0met their end to\u00a0men with rifles, and are memorialized in the annals of shooting squads in history.\n\nEven though guns are more lethal than ever in the 21st century, firing squads are\u00a0out of fashion. Many countries have banned them, and the countries where firing squads are\u00a0still legal are slowly becoming disinterested in them as a form of execution. However, you can always count on one aggressive or militant nation to carry on the tradition (in the event you want the tradition carried on). If you\u2019re curious what firing squads have been like across history, check out the list below.\n\nHow Traditional Firing Squads Work\n\nHow Traditional Firing Squads ... is listed (or ranked) 1 on the list How Firing Squads Have Worked Throughout History\nPhoto:\u00a0Photographer Unknown\/Public Domain\n\nA traditional firing squad is a basic set up, one you've surely\u00a0seen in movies, paintings, or historical photographs. The condemned stands before a surface from which bullets won't ricochet ( a wall, a hill, a mound, sandbags), is sometimes tied to a post\u00a0or restrained in another way, is more often than not blindfolded, and faces a line of armed men or women\u00a0who mow the condemned down in a fusillade of lead. If the condemned doesn't die in the initial hail of bullets, the commanding officer of the squad may shoot him or her in the head with a pistol.\u00a0\n\nFiring squads typically use rifles, though in some cases pistols have been used. All members of a firing squad are ordered to fire simultaneously, to avoid singling out a shooter as the one who fired the fatal shot. The firing squad generally targets the chest, both to avoid unnecessary damage to the head and face (for burial purposes), and because the chest is a larger, easier target than the head. In some places, there's a tradition of carrying out execution by firing squad at dawn, hence the phrase \"shot at dawn.\"\n\nThe Blindfold Serves Two Primary Purposes\n\nThe Blindfold Serves Two Prima... is listed (or ranked) 2 on the list How Firing Squads Have Worked Throughout History\nPhoto:\u00a0USHMM\/Public Domain\n\nThe hood worn by prisoners during\u00a0execution by firing squad serves two primary purposes. It dehumanizes the condemned, making it easier for the firing squad to perform its function without an\u00a0emotional response. The target on the chest further reinforces the notion\u00a0that the firing squad isn't\u00a0killing a human being, but merely aiming at a target and firing. Secondly, it prevents the condemned from witnessing his or her own death, saving the individual, in his or her final moments, from looking into the faces and down the barrels of the guns that will bring about imminent demise. However, it's not unheard of for a prisoner to request to go without a hood or blindfold; to look death in the face.\u00a0\n\nDeath by Firing Squad Is Typically a Military Execution\n\nDeath by Firing Squad Is Typic... is listed (or ranked) 3 on the list How Firing Squads Have Worked Throughout History\nPhoto:\u00a0US Army\/Public Domain\n\nSure, there are\u00a0hangings and beheadings in the annals of military executions, but firing squads have been\u00a0the\u00a0go-to method of dispatching soldiers\u00a0for a few centuries,\u00a0chiefly for symbolic and disciplinary reasons.\u00a0Using a firing squad makes\u00a0punishment a communal event. The offender is killed by his or her\u00a0peers, using weapons the soldiers\u00a0all use in combat. It also reinforces the idea of the community (the firing squad) over and against the\u00a0individual (the offender).\u00a0\n\nExecutioners Sometimes Get Guns Filled with Blanks\n\nExecutioners Sometimes Get Gun... is listed (or ranked) 4 on the list How Firing Squads Have Worked Throughout History\nPhoto:\u00a0Artist Unknown\/Public Domain\n\nEven if\u00a0executing a soldier for desertion or treason,\u00a0you might\u00a0get a little emotional when pulling the trigger. After\u00a0all, you might be killing someone with whom you served, whose family you know well. Or maybe you\u00a0don\u2019t want to live with the guilt of killing\u00a0an\u00a0unarmed man. Hence\u00a0the custom of at least one member of a firing squad receiving\u00a0a gun loaded with blanks.\u00a0No one on the squad\u00a0knows which gun is loaded with blanks, so it's impossible to know who fired the shot that killed the condemned.",

But Atlantis is almost certainly a myth invented by some Greek dude named Plato. (Who the hell names their kid after a planet?) And yet scientists still debate the existence of Atlantis more than 10,000 years after the city supposedly sank to the ocean floor. Why? Because\u00a0people are fascinated by the thought of an entire civilization wiped out by a disaster.

Since its inception in 1945, UNESCO has positively impacted the world in a number of ways.\n\nUNESCO Building\n\nSource: Noticias Sin\n\nOne of UNESCO\u2019s goals is to recognize and protect valuable places with either physical or cultural significance. There are currently 1007 UNESCO World Heritage Sites representing countries from all over the world. Each site is listed as either a cultural, natural or mixed site, depending on the nature of the location. From impressive monuments to precious religious shrines to incredible national parks, these UNESCO World Heritage Sites are both culturally important and undeniably intriguing.\n\nAmazing UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ilulissat Icefjord\n\nThe Ilulissat Icefjord is the sea mouth of Sermeq Kujalleq, one of the world\u2019s fastest moving and most active glaciers. Located on the west coast of Greenland, the Ilulissat Icefjord joined the ranks of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2004.\n\nSermeq Kujalleq calves over 35 cubic kilometers of ice each year, which accounts for a staggering 10 percent of Greenland\u2019s calf ice. Visitors who tour the Ilulissat Icefjord will encounter seals, whales, seabirds and endless amounts of\u2014you guessed it\u2014ice.\n\n\nTiwanaku, Bolivia was once the capital city of a culturally rich pre-Hispanic empire that stretched over much of the southern Andes. Reaching its height between 500 and 900 A.D., the city was once an important political and religious site with an advanced underground drainage system. Ruins from the original city still stand in protected archeological zones, where visitors can see two carved monoliths, an open temple and various stone carvings. The ancient city was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\nStone Wall at Tiwanaku\n\nSource: Historvius\n\nTiwanaku Bolivia\n\nSource: Wikimedia\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites Bolivia\n\nSource: Tripomatic\n\nAll That's Interesting\nYour curiosity knows no bounds.

This was a disaster that could have even caused a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nAfter the terrible tragedy, the food was reported to have raised radiation levels in some local food and water supplies. Within minutes of the earthquake, the tsunami waves were just as a threatening gas a horror movie.\n\nIt was reported that tsunami waves that touched JAPAN were as high as 23.6 m, approximately 77ft.\u00a0\n\nWe do offer consolations to the ones who faced their deaths. The arena is much worse for people who survived. There is the devastating family and loss of homes.\n\nThe cost of cleanup and reconstruction is mind-boggling. It appears that the more the planet goes around, the more disaster strikes. Be prepared as possible as you can\u00a0\n\nWhich disaster has shook your soul? What precautions have you taken to face such calamities? Remember to have a local radio. You can even lend a helping hand to the sufferers.\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.",

George Washington (the nation\u2019s first president) has his adjutant general issue an order barring any further Blacks from joining the Continental Army. The decision would be confirmed by the Continental Congress in November of 1775. The fear was that Blacks who fought for America\u2019s independence would be justified in demanding an end to slavery. And slave owners, including Washington, did not want that.\n\n1927\u2014David Dinkins, the first Black man elected mayor of New York City, is born on this day in 1927. He was born in Trenton, N.J., and served as New York City mayor from 1989 to 1993.\n\n\n1943\u2014Tennis sensation Arthur Ashe was born on this day in Richmond, Va. He would become the first Black male to win the Wimbledon men\u2019s singles championship by defeating Jimmy Connors in 1975. Ashe would receive a contaminated blood transfusion and die of AIDS in February 1993.\n\n1972\u2014The Democratic Party holds its presidential convention in Miami, Fla. New York Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the first Black person to actively seek the party\u2019s presidential nomination, received 151.95 votes on the first ballot. Senator George McGovern would eventually be nominated. Chisholm had been the first Black woman elected to the United States Congress, achieving the distinction in 1968. She was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., to a Barbadian mother and a Guyanese father. Chisholm\u2019s signature phrase was \u201cUn-bought and un-bossed.\u201d She died in January 2005.\n\nJuly 11\n\n1905\u2014The Niagara Movement (forerunner of the NAACP) is founded during a meeting near Niagara Falls, N.Y. Among the most prominent Blacks at the meeting were intellectual and activist W.E.B. DuBois and newspaper publishers William Monroe Trotter and Ida B. Wells Barnett.\n\n1915\u2014Mifflin Wistar Gibbs dies. Gibbs had worked on the Underground Railroad helping Blacks escape from slavery along with Frederick Douglas. He would later become publisher of Mirror of the Times\u2014the first Black newspaper in California. He was also the first African-American elected to a municipal judgeship in the state.\n\n2010\u2014Gospel legend Bishop Walter Hawkins dies. The Grammy award-winning Hawkins died at his home in Ripon, Calif. Hawkins was part of the influential Hawkins family.

        "text":"The most fascinating images from the New York Public Library\u2019s release of 180,000 copyright-free materials\n\n\nCopyright law is a thorny thing, and it prevents a lot of people from making new works and having fun.\n\nBut every once in a while, enough time passes, a lawsuit changes the game, or a big, old institution opens up and dusts off once-restricted or hidden material and lets it out into the public domain.\n\nThe New York Public Library joins the restriction-free party this week by making 180,000 non-copyright images from its collection available for high-res download. It\u2019s also giving access to its collections\u2019 metadata and making updates to its API to encourage playful games and visualizations.\n\nIts trove of old stereoscopic images make great gifs, which you can try for yourself:\n\nGIF made with the NYPL Labs Stereogranimator - view more at http:\/\/stereo.nypl.org\/gallery\/index\n\nNYPL Labs, the library\u2019s digitization and innovation arm, is the team behind these experiments. As Shana Kimball, manager of the labs\u2019 public programs and outreach, tells Quartz:\n\n\u201cOur thesis is, while it\u2019s great to put in front of the public some really large number of things that are freely available, we also know it\u2019s hard to get your head around it. Our visualization tool was one way people could have a serendipitous experience of what\u2019s really compelling to them, especially if you\u2019re not going in with a particular research question in mind.\u201d\n\nA representative from NYPL tells Quartz that four staff members decide what goes into the public domain, which ends up being about a third of the total images that have been digitized\u2014itself a \u201cvery, very, very small fraction\u201d of the library\u2019s total collections. Still, 180,000 images is nothing to scoff at\u2014and certainly enough for a day-long rabbit hole.\n\nSearchability can be a bit of an issue, though, even within the library\u2019s visualization tool, so to get you started, here are some of the most fascinating categories and examples in the trove.\n\nHistorical oddities\n\nThe historic Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan printed a message to guests from American president to-be Herbert Hoover, encouraging food thriftiness in wartime. Among his advice was \u201ceat more lobster and seafood.\u201d\n\nAdvice from Herbert Hoover, Waldorf-Astoria, New York, 1917 (From the New York Public Library)\n\nOld photos of beloved places\n\nPopular tourist cities like New York and Tokyo stand today in stark contrast to their turn-of-the-century counterparts, unlike Paris and London, which haven\u2019t changed much by comparison. A host of photos of pre-Imperial Japan show a very different place from what you might expect.\n\nPhoto of the Sens\u014dji temple complex in Asakusa, Tokyo, 1880-1890 (From the New York Public Library)\nPhoto of the New York Public Library\u2019s main building on 42nd Street, 1907 (From the New York Public Library)\n\nPrints of gnarly sea creatures\n\nThe newly released images contain detailed illustrations and engravings of plant and animal life. The zoophytes are especially of note.\n\nIllustrations of sea cucumbers and their anatomy, 1830 \u2013 1833 (From the New York Public Library)\nIllustration of a piper gurnard, 1785 \u2013 1797 (From the New York Public Library)\n\nBaffling keepsakes of old popular music\n\nA popular song from the early 20th century was about a kleptomaniac named Mamie.\n\nThe sheet music cover for \u201cMamie (don\u2019t you feel ashamie),\u201d 1901 (From the New York Public Library)\n\nAnd of course no history of American music would be complete without very hard-to-stomach racism, so keep that troubling aspect in mind while exploring the sheet music collection.\n\nGods and goddesses that pop\n\nOne collection worth getting lost in is a set of Egyptian gods and goddesses depicted by a French artist in the early 1800s. The colors pop like they were made today.\n\nIllustration of Egyptian goddess Sekhmet, c. 1823 (From the New York Public Library)\n\nElaborate dress for Old World nobility\n\nA London-based collection from the late 1700s depicts traditional and then-contemporary dress from around the world.\n\nThe Duke of Venice in the 1500s, 1757 \u2013 1772 (From the New York Public Library)\nA black sultana in 1749, 1757-1772 (From the New York Public Library)\n\nPhotos of huge, obsolete tech\n\nThe newly released collection contains more than 40,000 stereoscopic images\u2014two similar photographs shown side by side to create the appearance of depth when examined through a stereoscope. Most of these are landscapes, but a small handful are of huge steam and hydraulic systems.\n\nPhoto of a Corliss steam engine, Philadelphia, 1876 (From the New York Public Library)\n\nAnd if you\u2019re inspired to explore the jungle on your own, be sure to check the little public-domain box that appears when you type into the collection\u2019s search bar.\n\nhome our picks popular latest obsessions search",
