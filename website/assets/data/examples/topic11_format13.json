However, there are slightly different dates depending on your region.\n\nThe dates aren't vastly different, but it won't be a simultaneous release like Final Fantasy XV.

(PRE-ORDER HERE)\n\nIf you haven't done so already, you will want to check out the new trailer for World of Final Fantasy. It's almost three minutes long and features plenty of recognisable Final Fantasy characters from a wide range of games.\n\nDarryl was playing Final Fantasy before he was even born - quite a feat! Often very opinionated on the Final Fantasy franchise, you will often find him musing about small details. Feel free to follow him on Twitter.\n\nBe Social With Us!",

Free Yourself is a 2D, physics-based puzzle game set in a colourful universe of crazy robots who have captured the player. The most unique feature of Free Yourself is the ability for gamers to use a camera to capture their own face and truly become the star of the game.\n\n\"Something special happens when controlling an avatar that looks just like you,\" said Mel Georgiou, co-designer and programmer of Fire Tap Games. \"We've found that If the main character literally has your own face, it gives you that extra motivation to want to solve puzzles and free yourself!!\"\n\nFree Yourself has a simple premise; robots have taken the player captive and they must find a way to get free. Players will toggle switches, cause explosions, move platforms, teleport through portals and even flip gravity upside down in order to outsmart those pesky Bots. Gamers will have their minds challenged over 3 worlds and 72 exciting, brain teasing puzzles.\n\n\"We designed the visuals to be fun, eye catching and exciting\", said Simon Duong, lead artist of Free Yourself. \"At the same time, we wanted players to really have to use their minds to figure out some of these puzzles!\"\n\nThe game will be ad-supported and require an internet connection. An optional IAP for the iOS version to remove ads and play offline will also be available. Free Yourself will be free to download on the App Store, Google Play and Amazon App Store on December 6th, 2017.\n\nFire Tap Games is a division of Hell Tap Entertainment LTD, a small but ambitious indie studio dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what mobile gaming can achieve.

Players can also upgrade their hunting gear with authentically branded real life equipment.\n\n\u201cI commend Activision for their commitment to simulating the outdoor sports in a challenging, fun and exciting format,\u201d said Bryan Stave of Cabela's.\u201cCabela\u2019s Outdoor Adventures gives real enthusiasts their fix when they can\u2019t be in a forest or on a lake.\u201d\n\nBrand new to the franchise is an all-new shooting system known as VITALS (Visually Integrated Targeting and Lock-on System) that allows the player to focus on delivering an accurate shot to the prey\u2019s vitals, while also creating a closer and more personal view of the animals as they react realistically to being hunted. Even better, you can create your trophy buck - customize your deer\u2019s rack, body and color.

This year the event was well and truly stocked with game enthusiasts of all ages; among them was game server provider Pingperfect, sniffing out the next must have games. Whilst many games caught our eye, I have cherry picked four that Pingperfect will be looking to include in there massive library of dedicated game servers very soon.\n\n\nFor fans of Minecraft and games alike, Staxel is definitely the dark horse to watch. In Staxel you are given a farm to tend to and welcomed into village life where you can interact with NPCs or collaborate with friends on a server. This still developing sandbox RPG allows gamers the freedom to create at ease with a build system that Big Builds reportedly claimed is \u201cmore intuitive than Minecraft and easier to use\u201d. To complement the beautiful graphics, textures and gameplay Staxel offers is the incredibly immersive ambience music provided by Curtis Schweitzer who also composed for Starbound.\n\nThis is a fantastic game to buy a game server for, there is something to please everybody and whilst it is set for final product release later this year, you should definitely find a reason to buy it sooner!\n\nBattalion 1944\n\nBattalion suitably harks back to WW2 with gaming trends seeming to shift from futuristic shooters back to the more traditional gritty, and is set to lead the way for FPS games going forward. Without overpowered abilities and items to unlock in Battalion 1944, players will need to rely on their skill with a rifle alone \u2013 and possibly the quality of their surround sound. The gameplay is addictive and refreshing whilst also being slightly nostalgic for some of the more seasoned gamers. Having watched James Lyon(company director) play it at the event, I certainly know what to buy him the next time I want a day off!\n\nThe game is still early access with no official date yet however I for one expect the server list to be filled as soon as possible, so make sure to get your own dedicated game server with your best server host Pingperfect!\n\n\nDean Hall creator of DayZ revealed Stationeers and we were damned if we missed it! Stationeers is a project Dean has been passionately developing with a team of 6 and dedicating the majority of his time to. The meticulous attention to detail in the game, in which you manage all aspects of your space station from construction to agriculture and even gravity, captures the attention of the gamer and can hold it for hours on end. In the game you will also travel away from your space station on away missions which might be to an asteroid, planet or a derelict craft during which you may encounter hostiles or something might happen to your space station! Trust me, the dishes will not get washed up with this one!\n\nAfter touching base with Will Overgard and early access only two to three months away, hopefully it won\u2019t be long before I order my quality gaming server and be in serious need of a dishwasher!\n\nDay of infamy\n\nDay of infamy started out as the most popular mod for Insurgency and is now a standalone game of its own right. The game is filled with realistic action and encourages team work using squad based role systems and a local VOIP system in game which the enemy will hear if they get close enough! With workshop support, Day of infamy is sure to see lots of custom content and character skins for your avatar personalisation.\n\nDay of infamy promises to be value for money at a quick \u00a314.99 available on steam now!\n\nKeep an eye out for our online game servers for these great new finds and more on our Pingperfect website and follow our Twitter for the latest top deals on the best game servers around!\n\nBack to Blogs",

        "text":"Eden Games Utilizes Luxology's modo on Recently Released Test Drive Unlimited 2\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nFeb. 28, 2011\n\nGDC - SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - Feb. 28, 2011 - French game development studio, Eden Games, has recently used modo\u00ae, Luxology's\u00ae 3D modeling, painting and rendering software, to help the company transform the multiplayer driving game genre with the company's newest innovative and highly anticipated title. Eden Games turned to the company's dedicated Car Team - where modo is used exclusively - to design the highly realistic vehicles that are prominently featured in the action-packed release of Test Drive Unlimited 2 ( TDU2).\n\nThe sequel to the popular original Test Drive Unlimited , TDU2 is a massively open online racing (MOOR) game set on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza with over 2,000 miles of roadway and back roads. The experts on Eden Games' Car Team knew they needed to provide players with new and cutting-edge details and content. The game's luxury cars are a crucial part of the experience of playing TDU2 and needed to be just as beautiful as the real thing, which is why these experts turned to modo.\n\n\"Each car we modeled for TDU2 was a challenge because we only had 30,000 vertices to model the interior and exterior of the entire car,\" said Jonathan Marole, lead car artist at Eden Games. \"Thankfully, with modo, we are able to easily model very detailed cars due to the software's advanced optimization techniques.\"\n\nAlthough most artists within Eden Games use a variety of software programs, the Car Team uses modo exclusively due to its power, ease of use and advanced modeling toolsets. The team appreciates features like the reflection render, which is a great aid in controlling the normality of the mesh in order to perfect the reflection on the car and is vital when creating luxury cars on this caliber. The team also continually utilizes the multiple viewports and versatile work views provided in modo as they allow them to modify the shape of a car on the orthogonal viewport of one screen and immediately see the result in the rendered perspective of the second screen.\n\n\"Rotating and moving the views and working with objects was never so simple than with modo,\" said Cl\u00e9ment Dieu, car artist at Eden Games. \"Rotating the views is very important in car modeling to ensure the right shape of the car and modo is the only software I've found that does it so elegantly.\"\n\n\"modo is so versatile that it's like having my hands directly on the metal or the wood, just like a sculptor,\" said Dieu. \"I started using modo in 2007 when I arrived at Eden Games and it showed me a completely new way of modeling and rendering. I have not used another 3D software program since!\"\n\nTest Drive Unlimited 2 is available now for Xbox 360\u00ae video game and entertainment system from Microsoft, PlayStation\u00ae3 computer entertainment system, and the PC. For more information, please visit the official site at http:\/\/www.testdriveunlimited2.com.\n\nAbout modo\n\nmodo is an innovative 3D modeling, painting and rendering software designed to accelerate the creation of world-class models, associated color and normal maps, and ultra high-quality renderings. modo's modern workflow and advanced toolset easily deliver enhanced productivity for 3D artists working in game development, design visualization, package design, film visual effects, video production and graphic arts.

        "text":"Workshops of the Earth Charter Game\n\nPatricia Abuhab and Guilherme Blauth, founders of Instituto Harmonia na Terra and creators of the Earth Charter Game, presented the game at Guanajuato and conducted educational workshops. University students from different courses, teachers of the University of Guanajuato, members of the Mexican government and from the International Earth Charter Council had the opportunity to be connected through this game, which is and educational tool to work the contents of the Earth Charter in a collaborative, vivid and joyful way.\n\nIn total, 40 people\u00a0from different parts of the world experienced this methodology.\u00a0 The Earth Charter Game is an initiative of the Harmonia na Terra Institute and Coopera Brasil NGO.\u00a0\n\nSome of the comments of the participants were as follows:\n\u201cI liked the Earth Charter Game very much.\u00a0 It is very innovative as well as dynamic, apart from entertaining, and as a friend mentioned that day, it brings the physical contact into the game.\u00a0 This is something that we don\u2019t have very often nowadays and I believe it is a fundamental part of communication and understanding among living beings.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt is a game where the main objective is not to win but to learn more about the Earth Charter and cooperation among colleagues.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt is an amusing and different way of learning about the Earth Charter, for those who don\u2019t know it, but at the same time a new way of seeing it for those who are already familiar with it.\u00a0 I wish it could be commercialized here in Mexico because I am eager to play it again!\n\nJorge Garc\u00eda\n\n\u201cI really liked the game very much, it is above all educational and funny.\u00a0 It has a very good design and I liked the fact that it does not promote \u201cegos\u201d or envy.\u00a0 This is to say that as few, this game promotes sharing,\u00a0either all participants win or all loose if a person gets a card of mass destruction.\u00a0\u00a0 I also liked the fact that it is a game based on the Earth Charter and that apart from promoting peace, union, a better and less contaminated world, the game helps you with life.\u00a0 I believe that it could help openning minds around the world, apart from promoting the Earth Charter document.\u201d\n\nJackson Sote\n\n\u201cThe game has\u00a0been a memorable experience which I want to repeat.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFrancisco Vega\n\n\u201cIt was a nice experience because it opens your mind towards what is happening in the world within the theme of environment.\u00a0 I liked it very much.\u00a0 You can exchange ideas and open debates about this same topic and obtain ideas from other participants. I think this game is a good idea to promote care towards our ecosystem which is the whole world.\u201d\n\nEmiliano Castrej\u00f3n\n\nEarth Charter Game Workshop, Guanajuato\/Mexico: Patricia Abuhab photo",
