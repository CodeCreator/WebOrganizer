        "text":"Can I Still Recover Compensation If I Am Partially at Fault for the Accident?\n\nYes, you can still recover compensation even when you are partially at fault for your personal injury. However, your percentage of fault will reduce the amount that you'll be able to recover. For example, for 40% negligence, your damages decrease by 40%.\n\nPersonal injury cases cover a broad range of potential events. According to the law, individuals can be held responsible if their negligence or reckless behavior caused another person's injury. Theoretically, that sounds simple. However, accidents are often the result of several factors and injured individuals may share some amount of responsibility.\n\nFlorida is a no-fault state and a comparative negligence state, meaning that in a Miami car accident, even if one driver was\u00a0partially at fault for the\u00a0crash, they can still receive a certain amount of monetary compensation, but it can vary considerably.\n\nOnce the percent of fault is established, the total compensation the plaintiff could recover will be reduced by the percentage of fault.\u00a0For example, if you were\u00a0involved in a car accident in\u00a0Miami with another driver who was under the influence of alcohol, but you were driving over the speed limit, a judge might decide that you are 40% at fault for the accident. In that case, you can still recover 60% of your damages. Of course, if the other driver suffered losses as well, you or your insurance company will have to cover 40% of his damages.\n\nFlorida\u2019s No-Fault Car Insurance Laws\n\nUnder Florida Statute section 627.736, medical, surgical, funeral, and disability benefits are available after car accidents as part of a personal injury protection plan without regard to fault. These compensatory benefits include:\n\n  \u2022 Medical benefits: \"80% of all reasonable expenses for medically necessary medical, surgical, X-ray, dental, and rehabilitative services, including prosthetic devices and medically necessary ambulance, hospital, and nursing services\"\n  \u2022 Disability benefits: \"60% of any loss of gross income and loss of earning capacity per individual from the inability to work proximately caused by the injury sustained by the injured person\"\n  \u2022 Death benefits: \"Death benefits of $5,000 per individual. Death benefits are in addition to the medical and disability benefits provided under the insurance policy.\"\n\nFor more detailed information, please consult the Florida Statute 627.736.\n\nCommon Car Accident Scenarios Where Both Drivers Share Liability\n\nThere are many situations in which the driver that was hit could also be responsible.\u00a0One common event is when the driver in front of you suddenly hits the breaks and you rear-end his car. You might need the testimony of a witness to hold the other person responsible, otherwise, you might be at fault for following too close.\n\nThe driver that was hit could also be responsible in one of the following cases:\n\n  \u2022 They were backing up out of a parking space or down the street\n  \u2022 The car was pulling out of a driveway into oncoming traffic\n  \u2022 the driver in front slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting a person, an animal, or another vehicle\n  \u2022 The driver slammed on the brakes in a road rage situation\n\nThe amount recovered will depend on the percentage of fault each driver had. A court assigns percentages of blame in awarding damages stemming from a car accident lawsuit. What this means is that you need to present evidence that the other driver was at fault. If you were partially at fault, your awarded damages would be reduced by any percentage that the court deems you were at fault for.\n\nIf you were involved in a car accident in Miami that was partially your fault, it is important to know that you can still file a claim to preserve your chances of compensation.\n\nSteps to Take Immediately After the Car Accident\n\n  \u2022 It is imperative to make sure an accident report is filed.\n\nIf the police arrive at the scene, make sure you give a statement and sign it.\n\n  \u2022 Document the scene of the accident and take pictures of the scene, the damages of your car, and your injuries.\n\nDo not forget to write down the license number and the name of the other driver's insurance company as well as contact details of potential witnesses. You should also contact your insurance company and inform them about the accident, but avoid signing any statement or agreement.\n\n  \u2022 Immediately after the crash, make sure you receive a medical check-up and that you keep the medical report and any bills you might have paid.\n\nIt is important to present evidence such as a police report when suing an at-fault driver for damages in Florida. In addition to your medical records, a police report could include a description of the injuries you suffered as a result of the accident. Because Florida is a no-fault state regarding car insurance, you must prove that your injuries are sufficiently serious as to justify leaving the no-fault system. Only by leaving the no-fault system can you reject the settlement offer made by your car insurance provider and go after the at-fault driver and his or her insurer for adequate compensation.\n\nIf the other driver received a ticket, there is consistent evidence they were at fault for the accident. If no ticket was given, the best option is to contact our personal injury attorney in Miami, who can investigate the details of the crash and gather evidence that supports your case.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that the information provided on this site is not formal legal advice, also the site does not allow you to form an attorney-client relationship.",

        "text":"Get information that is essential for all newcomers to Canada\n\nViewed 4456 Times 0 Comments\n\nYour foreign driver\u2019s licence may be valid for only three to six months after you arrive in Canada. So it is wise to get an international driver\u2019s license before you leave your home country. Regardless, you will eventually need to take a driving test to obtain a Canadian driver\u2019s licence.\n\nLicences are issued by the province or territory in which you live. In order to receive a licence, you must pass several tests: a vision test, a written examination and a road test. In some provinces, a minimum of 30 days is required between writing the knowledge test and taking a road test.\n\nI drove in my homeland for 24 years and yet I still flunked the knowledge test and barely passed the road test here, so I\u2019d recommend studying for your test and taking some driving lessons again. It will make the process easier.\n\nAlso, you must be at least 16 years old before you can be tested for a driver\u2019s licence in Canada. Some provinces have a graduated licensing system whereby young drivers can be restricted to driving only in daylight hours during their probation period.\n\nWhen applying for a driver\u2019s licence, the following documents may be necessary for proof of name, signature and address: \u00a6A passport \u00a6A Permanent Resident (PR) Card \u00a6Proof of address (bank statement or other public office received mail) \u00a6A driver\u2019s licence from your home country, but an international driver\u2019s licence is best\n\nIncidentally, a driver\u2019s licence is one of the best pieces of identification you can have, since it shows your photograph, signature and address.\n\nWas this answer helpful ?

        "text":"Publication Details\n\nPhiladelphia Tax Alert\n\nTo Our Clients and Friends:\n\n\u00a0Fineman Krekstein and Harris, P.C. is the premier law firm helping Philadelphia real estate owners avoid onerous and inaccurate City of Philadelphia taxes.\u00a0 We are proud of our recognized record of achievement.\n\n\u00a0Over the last year, there has been uncertainty regarding Philadelphia real estate taxes for tax-year 2013.\u00a0 Recently enacted state legislation along with unsettled and shifting budget discussions at Philadelphia City Council have added to the confusion. Accordingly, we have summarized below some frequently asked questions, along with some recommended actions:\n\n1.\u00a0What should I do to protect my real estate interests?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0As a result of the recession, the City\u2019s assessment of your property\/properties may be overvalued.\u00a0 You should carefully review the market value of any property subject to Philadelphia taxes.\u00a0 To determine the City\u2019s current assessed value of any property, go to the Office of Property Assessment (\u201cOPA\u201d) website (, or the information may be found on your tax bill.\u00a0 If you believe the City\u2019s assessment overvalued your property, assemble documentation of income and expenses along with any recent appraisals and contact David Fineman (215-893-8701) or Gary Krimstock (215-893-8722) at our office.\u00a0 They can review and evaluate your case for a potential tax appeal before the October 1, 2012 filing deadline.\n\n\u00a02.\u00a0What is the current status of the Philadelphia real estate tax system?\nPrior to 2012, the state-established ratio of tax assessment to market value had been set at 32%.\u00a0 The State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) lowered the Common Level Ratio for Philadelphia for tax-year 2012 to 25.2%.\u00a0 For the 2012 tax-year, only those properties for which an appeal had already been filed were eligible to seek the 25.2% ratio. The City is contesting all of those appeals in Court.\u00a0 As a result of recently enacted state legislation, the ratio will return to 32% beginning for the 2013 tax-year, the same ratio that was applied to all properties in Philadelphia for the 2011 tax-year.\u00a0\n\n\u00a03.\u00a0Will I see an increase in my assessed value?\n\u00a0The City is committed to implementing the Actual Value Initiative (AVI). AVI is a uniform property tax method that assesses properties at actual fair market value.\u00a0 Obviously, depending on the tax rate that the City applies, those properties that have historically been significantly undervalued may suffer a dramatic tax increase in tax-year 2014.\u00a0 Most commercial properties in Philadelphia, and residential properties in the greater Center City area, as well as certain other neighborhoods, are undervalued for tax assessment purposes.\u00a0 We do not expect these changes to occur for the 2013 tax-year, the AVI is likely to be implemented for tax year 2014.\n\n\u00a04.\u00a0How do these changes affect my primary residence?\n\u00a0As a result of recently enacted state legislation, the Homestead Exemption will not be phased in until the actual value initiative is established in the 2014 tax-year.\u00a0 There has been notice from many sources, encouraging property owners to file for the Homestead Exemption for principal residences in Philadelphia.\u00a0 Filing details and requirements will be announced when they have been finalized, and including the amount of the Exemption.",

Have you ever asked yourself, \u201cwhen am I ever going to need to know this, or why do I need to learn that\u201d? The objective of the SAF is to relate subject matter and basic principles of education to how anglers use them out on the water every day. Also, the SAF is aimed at getting students off the couch and back into the great outdoors by promoting the formation of fishing clubs and outdoor activities within the school. A byproduct of SAF efforts is the creation of competitive fishing in club tournaments and events between neighboring schools.\n\nHow can your school get started?\n\nThe process is pretty simple.
