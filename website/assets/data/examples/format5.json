        "text":"Infectious Disease in Illinois\n\nQuestions and Answers about Cronobacter sakazakii (formerly Enterobacter sakazakki) and the Use of Powdered Infant Formula (PIF)\n\nIf you are concerned about your infant\u2019s health or the infant is experiencing symptoms of meningitis or septicemia, which include fever, fussiness, vomiting, lethargy, not eating, listlessness or spine arching, immediately contact your pediatrician or local health care provider.\n\n  \u2022 What is Cronobacter sakazakii? What diseases can the bacteria cause?\n\nCronobacter sakazakii, formerly known as Enterobacter sakazakii, is a bacterium. Illness from this organism is rare, but infection can cause meningitis and septicemia in infants. The infection can be fatal or result in long-term complications.\n\n  \u2022 Where does the bacterium come from? Where can it be found?\n\nThe bacteria are everywhere in the environment and have been found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals. Ingestion of food contaminated with the bacteria or the presence of the bacterium on surfaces, such as kitchen countertops, does not always result in illness.\n\n  \u2022 How does powdered infant formula get contaminated with Cronobacter sakazakii? Can it be found in other foods?\n\nThe way powdered infant formula becomes contaminated with these bacteria is not well understood. Contamination can occur from the raw ingredients used in the formula, during the manufacturing process or during the preparation\/reconstitution process. Contamination also may occur through blenders, feeding bottles and utensils used to cleanse feeding bottles. Contamination may be more likely when reconstituted formula is kept at improper temperatures prior to use or for a longer duration than suggested by manufacturers. The organism has been found in other foods, but only powdered infant formula has been linked to disease outbreaks.\n\n  \u2022 Who is at risk for getting this infection?\n\nThose at elevated risk for infection are premature and low birth-weight infants, infants with immune system problems or babies born to mothers with immune system problems.\n\n  \u2022 How can this risk be minimized or reduced?\n\nCommercially sterile liquid formula is less frequently associated with illness and can be used in instead of powdered infant formula, where possible. If powdered infant formula is chosen, remember it is not a sterile product and the use of boiled water can reduce the risk of infection. This includes tap water, bottled water or water specifically indicated for use in infant care.\n\nPowdered infant formula should be prepared\/reconstituted immediately before feeding time, according to package instructions and cooled appropriately before giving to the infant.\n\nAdditional tips to reduce infection risk\n\nClean utensils\n\n  \u2022 Wash hands, forearms and fingernails thoroughly before handling any feeding materials or preparing formula.\n  \u2022 All bottles, nipples, caps and rings should be washed in hot, soapy water with thorough rinsing.\n\nPreparing formula\n\n  \u2022 Before use, powdered formula should be kept dry in an airtight container with a firm cap or lid and stored in a cool, dark area. Make sure the expiration date has not passed.\n  \u2022 During formula preparation, bring water to a bubbling boil for two minutes and allow the water to cool before mixing.\n  \u2022 Avoid reheating formula and do not use a microwave oven to warm the formula.\n\nStoring formula\n\n  \u2022 Formula should be prepared in small amounts immediately before feeding time to minimize the need for storing prepared\/reconstituted formula.\n  \u2022 Prepared\/reconstituted formula should not be stored at room temperature for more than one hour or more than four hours in the refrigerator.\n  \u2022 Throw out any formula left in a bottle after feeding.\n\nAdditional information for the best practices in infant formula preparation can be found at:\n\nIllinois Department of Human Services:\nWorld Health Organization (WHO):\n\nidph online home\nIllinois Department of Public Health\n535 West Jefferson Street\nSpringfield, Illinois 62761\nPhone 217-782-4977\nFax 217-782-3987\nTTY 800-547-0466\nQuestions or Comments",

However, all Indiana attorneys are required to annually certify their IOLTA status to the appellate clerk's office according to Indiana Admission and Discipline Rule 2(f).\n\nFor more information about the IOLTA program, see the following resources:\n\nWhat are the fees for annual attorney registration?\n\nAttorney annual registration fees (including late fee penalties) are as follows:\n\n\nPaid 8\/1-10\/1\n\nPaid 10\/2-10\/15\n\nPaid 10\/16-12\/31\n\nPaid after 12\/31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFees\/Penalties based on attorney's status as of 10\/1\n\nCan I mail a check?\n\nYes, you can mail your annual fee payment in the form of a paper check, but it must be accompanied by a printed Payment Acknowledgment.\u00a0Your payment acknowledgement is created after you review and submit your online registration information through the portal, then choose \"Paper Check \/ Cash\" as your payment method, and confirm the payment method. The payment acknowledgement also includes a Confirmation # that you should write on the Memo line of your check.

        "text":"Why must propane cylinders be stored in an upright position?\nPropane cylinders have a safety valve that prevents them from bursting in case of a fire. In order for the valve to work properly, the cylinder must be kept in an upright position both during use and storage.\n\nHow do I know how much gas is left in a propane cylinder?\nYou will find out how much gas is left in the cylinder by weighing the cylinder. The cylinder is marked with the cylinder\u2019s own weight, i.e. the tare weight. This is subtracted from the total weight. The difference is the amount of gas remaining in the cylinder. Composite cylinders are transparent, so you will be able to simply see how much gas remains in the cylinder.\n\nHow much propane does 1 kW equal?\nOne kilogramme of propane contains 12.8 kWh of energy. 1 kW is 78.125 g of propane per hour.\n\nCan I keep propane cylinders in outdoor storage during the winter?\nYes, you can. Propane only freezes when the temperature reaches -187 \u00b0C.\n\nWhere can I exchange the aluminium cylinders?\nAt any AGA service point selling industrial gases. Find your nearest sales outlet\u00a0using the Dealer Finder.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t there a refundable deposit on propane cylinders?\nIn accordance with public authority rules and regulations, the ownership of a propane cylinder is transferred in full to the consumer at the point of purchase. There is therefore no refundable deposit on the cylinders and they will not be redeemed. Check the price of propane cylinders with an AGA dealer.\n\nCan I transport propane cylinders in my own car?\nYou can transport propane cylinders in your car as long as the cylinders are kept in an upright position and they are well secured, for example, with a strap.\n\nWhy is propane more expensive in composite cylinders than in steel cylinders?\nThe purchase price of a composite cylinder is several times that of a steel or aluminium cylinder. In addition, composite cylinders are more expensive to fill and maintain. The higher\u00a0purchase and maintenance costs are partly included in the price of the actual cylinder and partly in the price of the gas. Composite cylinders have, however, many advantages over steel cylinders: they weigh only about half as much as those made of steel, and they are transparent allowing you to see at a glance how much gas you have left.\n\nCan I store propane underneath the kitchen sink?\nPropane cylinders should be primarily stored outdoors, but they may also be stored in other well-ventilated areas.\n\n\n\nHow can I flavour the carbonated water?\nAQVIA flavours are available in soda and cider concentrates. All AQVIA flavours are made from natural ingredients, without artificial sweeteners. You can also make your own drink mixes - Try, for example, a slice of lime, lemon or cucumber. Check the current selection on the AQVIA Drink Concentrates page.\n\nWhere can I buy flavours for my AQVIA machine?\nMany dealers selling AQVIA carbonated water machines also sell AQVIA flavours. Find your nearest dealer here.\n\nThe base plate of the AQVIA PET bottles sometimes comes loose. Is this normal?\nThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be. The base plate of the PET bottles is detachable, making the bottles easier to clean.\n\nCan I wash the PET bottles in the dishwasher?\nNo. If you wash the bottles in the dishwasher, they will lose their shape. PET bottles only withstand temperatures of up to 40 \u00b0C, and therefore dishwasher temperatures are too high for them.\n\nShould I add the flavours into the PET bottle before I carbonate the water?\nNo. The flavours are always added after the water has been carbonated.",

Do you think I will qualify?\nAnswered on Tuesday, May 23rd, 2017 by\nAmy Miller\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had a chance to establish your credit, a secured credit card is a good option to do so. And Skypass secured card is not an exception. Like any other secured credit card, this card is designed for someone with no credit or bad credit history. The card requires a security deposit, and the minimum deposit is pretty high \u2013 $300. It is possible to find secured credit cards with a lower minimum deposit.\n\nThe Skypass secured card will allow you to earn miles on eligible purchases. If you manage your card responsibly for a year, you may be able to move to an unsecured credit account. The Skypass secured card is not the only secured credit card that offer rewards. There are other secured cards that allow to earn rewards on all credit card purchases. Upgrades are also available, and with some issuers you don\u2019t have to wait a year to upgrade to an unsecured account.\n\nOther Popular Secured Credit Card FAQs\n\nIn order to get your deposit back you need to close your credit card account and pay your card balance in full. After you paid your card off, contact the credit card issuer to request a refund of your security deposit.\n\nContinue \u00bb\n\nA secured card may be a great option though for getting a credit card and rebuilding your credit as secured cards are usually reported to the credit bureaus \u2013 Experian, TransUnion or Equifax.

Sips or Structural Insulated Panels are a form of timber frame construction, made up of two sheets of sheathing (usually OSB3) bonded to a rigid insulation core (urethane foam or eps) the panels form the load bearing Structural skin of the buildings walls and roof.\n\nQ. Is Sip Construction a new technology?\nA. No: Sip panels have been used in the UK for around 20 years, however, they have been used in other parts of the world since the early 50\u2019s. The first Sips Panels were invented in Madison, Wisconsin by engineers at the Forest Products Laboratory in 1930\u2019s.\n\nQ. If Sips have been around for decades, why is there so much interest now?\nA. With the current trends of high energy prices and new legislation regarding the performance of new housing stock, Sips are being recognised as the most cost effective way to achieve a premium insulated building. They are simple to use, versatile in design application and very fast to erect to a weather tight shell.\n\nQ. Are Sips more expensive to use than conventional building techniques?\nA. No. When compared to conventional brick and block, building Sips appear to be more expensive, however, the performance of Sips as standard if far higher than current building regs achieved by conventional build. If you were to build with brick and block to the same performance with additional insulation, the cost would actually be higher than that of the Sips method.\n\nQ. Do Sips require any specialist building knowledge or skills to use?\nA. No. Anyone with good carpentry skills\/tools can use Sips with a little training. All internal & external finishes\/linings are installed in the same manner as conventional building techniques.\n\nQ. Are Sips safe to use?\nA. Yes. Sips have undergone vigorous testing for structural and insulation performance, they have been tested in relation to fire performance and have obtained all necessary accreditation which is supported by BBA approval download copy BBA approval.\n\nfaq 2Q. Can I get a mortgage or insure my house if built from Sips.\nA. Sips have been used for some years in the UK and are recognised as a main-stream form of construction. Kingspan Tek panels have approval from all of the major home warranty suppliers and the council of mortgage lenders, so there is no issue in obtaining a mortgage or insurance for your property. Advise on self build mortgages can be found at www.buildstore.co.uk.\n\nQ. What footings are required?\nA. There are no special requirements for footing details. All standard type footings are compatible with Sip construction, the only requirements are that a load bearing skin of block work is taken up to the DPC level to support the soleplate and this should have a level tolerance of +\/- 5-10mm maximum\n\nQ. What finishes can I use with Sips?\nA. Sips are a very versatile form of construction and can be used with nearly all finishes from a brick skin to timber rain screen and render finishes. Internally they can be lined with normal gypsum boards, being dry lined or wet plaster finished.\n\nQ. How much quicker is building with Sip?\nA. Sip building systems can be erected in a matter of days to a weather tight shell, this is done by one set of tradesmen, so there are no delays in the programme. The nature of the system means that the on site time for the construction of the shell, is reduced by 30-70% depending on the size and complexity of the build\n\nQ. How soon can you be on site?\nA. Typically we could be on site with your panels within 6-12 weeks from placement of order and a design freeze. This time varies again based upon size and complexity of the build.\n\nQ. What is the level of sound proofing?\nA. Sip panels give a dB reduction of 40dB for a single panel lined with 15mm gyproc board. This exceeds current requirements.\n\nQ. How do I get a quote?\nA. Just follow the link to quote request fill in the details and we will get back to you as soon as possible.",
