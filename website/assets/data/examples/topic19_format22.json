The DNA will be extracted using the basic biochemical techniques for isolating, purifying, and digesting DNA molecules. The drug test will be completed using various testers. A blood typing kit will be used for the blood tests.\n\n\nCellular Biology and Location of DNA\n\nDNA is the blueprint of life and is found in almost all living organisms. These organisms can be as simple as a single-celled bacteria or as complex as a multi-celled human: the human body contains approximately 50 trillion cells. There are two different types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. An example of prokaryotic organism is bacteria. Prokaryotic cells do not contain a nuclear membrane and so do not have a distinct nucleus. Only eukaryotic cells, which make up plants and animals, will be considered in this lab. Eukaryotic cells have a distinct, membrane-bound nucleus that isolates the DNA from the rest of the cell. The structure of plant cells is different from those of animal cells in structure and cellular contents. Only plant cells will be used in this experiment.\n\nFigure 1: Cell membrane.\n\nPlant cells are surrounded by a cell wall. It has high mechanical strength and protects the cell. Directly beneath the cell wall lies the plasma membrane (Figure 1), which contains the cytosol. The various cell organelles, including the nucleus, are found within the cytosol. The nucleus houses the DNA in the form of chromatin.\n\nFigure 2: Cell nucleus.\n\nChromatin is the active form of DNA in the cell when it is not preparing for cell division. It is comprised of DNA wrapped around protein particles called histones.\n\nFigure 3: Cell structure.\n\nDNA Extraction Technique\n\nIn this experiment, a goal is to extract the DNA from a fruit sample. Some knowledge of the scientific background behind DNA extraction is needed to do this.\n\nThe DNA extraction process is a fairly simple biochemical procedure that can be divided into three major steps: breaking open the cell (lysis), destroying membranes within the cell, and precipitating the DNA out of the solution.\n\nThe following sections describe how each step relates to the physical and biochemical properties of DNA.\n\nCell Lysis (Breaking Open the Cell Wall and Membranes)\n\nPlant cells have a very rigid external structure \u2014 the cell wall \u2014 which protects it. To get to the DNA, the very first step would be to break open that wall.\n\nThe cell wall is the first barrier in that must be broken to extract the DNA molecule inside the cell. It is very rigid and acts as a protector and filter. It is made of cellulose, and is responsible for making wood hard and durable. To destroy the cell wall, a mechanical method is used to break apart the cellulose molecules. In this experiment, the fruit sample is mashed manually.\n\nDestroying Membranes Within the Cell\n\nThe cell's plasma membrane is made of phospholipid bilayers; they are made of fat. To disrupt them, that mesh of fat molecules is broken up with soap. The structure of soap is very similar to that of fat and grease.\n\nFigure 4: Soap micelle.\n\nA soap molecule has two parts: a head and a tail. The head is polar and is attracted to water while the tail is non-polar and is attracted to oil and fat. When soap molecules are in water, they group themselves into micelles \u2014 a roughly spherical structure in which all the polar heads point outwards (in contact with water) and all the non-polar tails point inwards at the center of the sphere (away from the water). They can effectively trap the fat molecule inside the micelle and dissolve the cell membranes. How does this micelle break down the phospholipid bilayer? The molecules in the phospholipid bilayer (Figure 5) also contain molecules that are made up of a hydrophobic head and a hydrophilic tail. The soap molecules orient themselves so that their head associates with the tail of the phospholipid bilayer. In this way, the soap is able to break up the bilayer molecule by molecule.\n\nFigure 5: Phospholipid bilayer.\n\nPrecipitating the DNA\n\nWhen the membrane is successfully disrupted, the DNA is released from the cells into the solution along with protein molecules and other cellular miscellanea.\n\nThe DNA molecule is a double-helical polymer consisting of a sugar-phosphate backbone with nitrogenous bases running perpendicular to the backbone. These bases, often represented by letters \u2014 A (adenine), G (guanine), C (cytosine), and T (thymine) \u2014 are the elementary components making up the coded genetic information (Figure 7). The base sequence acts as the instruction manual of the cell, directing it on how to make proteins and other important molecules that an organism needs to survive and function.\n\nWith the cell's contents mixed into a solution, the DNA is separated from the rest; this process is called precipitation. Salt is used because it disrupts the structure of the proteins and carbohydrates found in the solution. Also, the salt provides a favorable environment to extract the DNA by contributing positively charged sodium ions that neutralize the negative charge of DNA. After the addition of salt and soap, the manner by which the DNA is being extracted out of the solution cannot be seen as it is too small to distinguish from the rest of the solution. To aid in precipitating the DNA, alcohol is added since it cannot dissolve DNA. A translucent white substance will begin to form at the top; this is DNA. Once it is thick enough, it can be spooled out. This simple procedure is a rough extraction process that needs further purification before it can be successfully run on a gel for analysis.\n\nFigure 6: Extracted DNA.\n\n\nOften times, larger fragments of DNA are cut, or restricted, to extract a particular fragment. This is made possible by the action of restriction enzymes, which are used by bacteria to cut up foreign or enemy DNA. Restriction enzymes are catalytic proteins that recognize specific palindromic DNA sequences and cut the double-stranded DNA at particular sites. The sites that the restriction enzymes recognize are called restriction sites. There are many different types of restriction enzymes. Each type recognizes a different restriction site. In this lab, Lambda DNA, which is a commercially available DNA normally found in a virus called Phage Lambda, will be restricted with the restriction enzyme BamH1.\n\nFigure 7: Nitrogenous bases of DNA.\nFigure 8: Restriction enzymes.\nEnzyme Source Recognition Sequence Cut\nBamH1 Bacillus amyloliquefaciens\nEcoRI Escherichia coli\nHindIII Haemophilus influenzae\n\nGel Electrophoresis\n\nFigure 9: Agarose gel.\n\nThe technique of DNA electrophoresis (Figure 10), will be performed on uncut and cut Lambda DNA, a commercially available DNA on an agarose gel, to visualize the characteristic banding patterns that differentiate between different DNA fragments. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used for separating molecules based on their charge and molecular weight. The sample is loaded in a gel matrix and an electric field is applied across it. The electric field enables the DNA, which is negatively charged to migrate to the end, which is positively charged. Opposites attract and so the negatively charged DNA is attracted to the positive end of the gel. Lighter molecules will migrate to the opposite end of the gel faster than heavier molecules.\n\nFigure 10: Gel electrophoresis.\n\nThe following is a gel after the samples have been run. Each column is referred to as a lane, representing one sample each. The individual bands (Figure 11) contain fragments of DNA that are identical in weight.\n\nFigure 11: DNA banding pattern following gel electrophoresis.\n\n\nFingerprints are unique patterns, made by friction ridges (raised) and furrows (recessed), which appear on the pads of the fingers and thumbs. Prints from palms, toes and feet are also unique; however, these are used less often for identification, so this guide focuses on prints from the fingers and thumbs.\n\nThe fingerprint pattern, such as the print left when an inked finger is pressed onto paper, is that of the friction ridges on that particular finger. Friction ridge patterns are grouped into three distinct types\u2014loops, whorls, and arches\u2014each with unique variations, depending on the shape and relationship of the ridges:\n\nLoops are prints that recurve back on themselves to form a loop shape. Divided into radial loops (pointing toward the radius bone, or thumb) and ulnar loops (pointing toward the ulna bone, or pinky), loops account for approximately 60 percent of pattern types.\n\nFigure 12: A looped fingerprint.\n\nWhorls form circular or spiral patterns, like tiny whirlpools. There are four groups of whorls: plain (concentric circles), central pocket loop (a lo... (truncated)",

        "text":"How to avoid getting your hand caught in the I\/O Blender\n\nThe I\/O blender, the computing term for describing input\/output, is the commonly used phrase for describing performance in virtualised environments. Over the years, virtualisation has continued to grow. In fact, today about 70-80% of workloads are virtualised and that number is only expected to increase in the coming years.\n\nPrior to the widespread adoption of virtualisation in enterprise environments, storage was \"predictable.\" System and storage admins could easily describe what the I\/O patterns looked like at the server, fabric and storage levels.\n\nHowever, that is no longer true in today's virtualised reality. Picture what the contents of a blender look like when you push the pulse button. The contents are mixed up and jumping around, hardly resembling what was there before. I\/O is no longer predictable \u2013 rather, it looks like it has gone through an I\/O Blender.\n\nToday, businesses rely on virtual machines to run critical databases, enterprise applications, private clouds and host thousands of desktop computers and mobile devices. When any of these processes fail to perform well, the business also fails, reaffirming the importance of having visibility and control over virtual environments.\n\nProblems caused by the I\/O Blender effect\n\nThe I\/O Blender effect can impact a number of infrastructure components and can have a negative impact on system performance such as:\n\n\u2022 Insufficient controller cache: Storage controllers are configured with specific amounts of cache that help give breathing room and some level of workspace for incoming\/outgoing data. The unpredictable nature of I\/O Blender patterns and concurrent access to the same resources can overwhelm controller caches and result in degraded performance with added read\/write latencies.\n\n\u2022 Read\/write scheduling in arrays: Storage controllers are responsible for coordinating read and write operations to the arrays. Depending on the disk configuration and array configuration, scheduling and performing these operations can have a significant impact on performance \u2013 especially if large amounts of requests from disparate systems are realised.\n\n\u2022 VMDK file locking in block storage: In VMware-based environments that utilise block storage, a mechanism is in place to lock VMDK files prior to accessing them for I\/O operations. In a highly active environment, such as those impacted by the I\/O Blender effect, the hypervisor spends much time and effort locking and unlocking files. Plus, the SAN needs to perform multiple operations from cues by the hypervisor. All of the locking and unlocking can take a heavy toll on SAN and environmental performance.\n\n\u2022 LUN Alignment: Operating system disk access relies upon placing data in blocks\/clusters on disk. SAN storage relies upon placing data on blocks in the array of disks. A condition exists wherein the block sizes of the OS do not match (by some factor) with the block sizes on SAN storage. This LUN misalignment can have serious impact on performance.\n\nMinimising the I\/O Blender effect\n\nBy now it is clear that virtualisation is only going to continue to grow in enterprise environments. Compounded with trends like VDI and big data, the effect will only worsen if companies don't act now and plan ahead for the future. Steps companies can take include:\n\n\u2022 Adjust organisation of VMs for like workloads: This may involve different SAN configurations to ensure like workloads are organised rather than providing a single array of disks. Like workloads are more predictable and can be planned for.\n\n\u2022 Utilise storage offloading functions: Hypervisor vendors have been working hard with storage vendors to offload many storage functions from the hypervisor to the storage controllers. This allows the storage system to more efficiently handle the operation, reduces pressure on the hypervisor and helps reduce congestion on any storage connections (local, fibre or network).\n\n\u2022 Understand the workload: Understanding the workload will help system admins and storage admins ensure proper grouping of like workload types. Being able to proactively plan where workloads are going to be placed will ensure optimal performance will be maintained and identification of capacity constraints before they occur.\n\n\u2022 Expand and extend storage systems: Being able to expand a storage system in some fashion ensures the decisions you make now can be adapted, adjusted and enhanced to meet the needs of today and tomorrow.\n\n\u2022 Utilise up-to-date infrastructure: The I\/O Blender effect has a way of highlighting the bottlenecks in your virtualisation environment. By staying up to date with infrastructure technologies, the bottlenecks can be reduced or eliminated.\n\nAs virtualisation continues to become more and more widespread in enterprise environments, it is even more critical that companies understand the cause, impacts and ways to minimise the I\/O blender effect.\n\nWhile virtualisation brought efficiency and simplicity to the compute side, it has only made things worse for storage. Utilising \"smart storage\" that sees, learns and adapts, not only helps effectively manage the virtual environment, but also provides more efficiency and productivity to the businesses overall.\n\n  \u2022 Kieran Harty is the Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Tintri",

        "text":"7.6 kg to lbs - 7.6 kilograms into pounds\n\n\n7.6 kg to lbs\n\nDo you need to know how much is 7.6 kg equal to lbs and how to convert 7.6 kg to lbs? You are in the right place. This whole article is dedicated to kilogram to pound conversion - theoretical and also practical. It is also needed\/We also want to highlight that whole this article is dedicated to a specific amount of kilograms - this is one kilogram. So if you need to know more about 7.6 kg to pound conversion - keep reading.\n\nBefore we move on to the more practical part - this is 7.6 kg how much lbs conversion - we want to tell you a little bit of theoretical information about these two units - kilograms and pounds. So let\u2019s move on.\n\n7.6 kgs in pounds\n\nWe will begin with the kilogram. The kilogram is a unit of mass. It is a base unit in a metric system, in formal International System of Units (in short form SI).\n\nSometimes the kilogram can be written as kilogramme. The symbol of the kilogram is kg.\n\nFirstly the kilogram was defined in 1795. The kilogram was described as the mass of one liter of water. This definition was not complicated but impractical to use.\n\nLater, in 1889 the kilogram was described by the International Prototype of the Kilogram (in short form IPK). The International Prototype of the Kilogram was prepared of 90% platinum and 10 % iridium. The International Prototype of the Kilogram was in use until 2019, when it was switched by another definition.\n\nThe new definition of the kilogram is build on physical constants, especially Planck constant. The official definition is: \u201cThe kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015\u00d710\u221234 when expressed in the unit J\u22c5s, which is equal to kg\u22c5m2\u22c5s\u22121, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of c and \u0394\u03bdCs.\u201d\n\nOne kilogram is exactly 0.001 tonne. It could be also divided into 100 decagrams and 1000 grams.\n\n7.6 kilogram to pounds\n\nYou learned a little about kilogram, so now we can go to the pound. The pound is also a unit of mass. It is needed to highlight that there are more than one kind of pound. What does it mean? For instance, there are also pound-force. In this article we are going to to concentrate only on pound-mass.\n\nThe pound is in use in the Imperial and United States customary systems of measurements. To be honest, this unit is used also in other systems. The symbol of this unit is lb or \u201c.\n\nThere is no descriptive definition of the international avoirdupois pound. It is defined as 0.45359237 kilograms. One avoirdupois pound can be divided to 16 avoirdupois ounces and 7000 grains.\n\nThe avoirdupois pound was enforced in the Weights and Measures Act 1963. The definition of this unit was written in first section of this act: \u201cThe yard or the metre shall be the unit of measurement of length and the pound or the kilogram shall be the unit of measurement of mass by reference to which any measurement involving a measurement of length or mass shall be made in the United Kingdom; and- (a) the yard shall be 0.9144 metre exactly; (b) the pound shall be 0.45359237 kilogram exactly.\u201d\n\n7.6 kg in lbs\n\nTheoretical section is already behind us. In this part we are going to tell you how much is 7.6 kg to lbs. Now you know that 7.6 kg = x lbs. So it is time to know the answer. Just look:\n\n7.6 kilogram = 16.755131912 pounds.\n\nThis is a correct outcome of how much 7.6 kg to pound. It is possible to also round it off. After rounding off your outcome is exactly: 7.6 kg = 16.72 lbs.\n\nYou learned 7.6 kg is how many lbs, so have a look how many kg 7.6 lbs: 7.6 pound = 0.45359237 kilograms.\n\nOf course, this time you can also round off the result. After rounding off your result is as following: 7.6 lb = 0.45 kgs.\n\nWe are also going to show you 7.6 kg to how many pounds and 7.6 pound how many kg results in charts. See:\n\nWe want to begin with a table for how much is 7.6 kg equal to pound.\n\nKilograms Pounds Pounds (rounded off to two decimal places)\n7.6 16.755131912 16.720\nNow look at a table for how many kilograms 7.6 pounds.\n\nPounds Kilograms Kilograms (rounded off to two decimal places\n7.6 0.45359237 0.45\n\nNow you learned how many 7.6 kg to lbs and how many kilograms 7.6 pound, so it is time to move on to the 7.6 kg to lbs formula.\n\n7.6 kg to pounds\n\nTo convert 7.6 kg to us lbs you need a formula. We are going to show you a formula in two different versions. Let\u2019s begin with the first one:\n\nNumber of kilograms * 2.20462262 = the 16.755131912 outcome in pounds\n\nThe first formula give you the most correct result. Sometimes even the smallest difference can be significant. So if you need an exact outcome - this version of a formula will be the best solution to convert how many pounds are equivalent to 7.6 kilogram.\n\nSo let\u2019s move on to the shorer version of a formula, which also enables calculations to know how much 7.6 kilogram in pounds.\n\n7.6 pound to kg\n\nThe second version of a formula is down below, have a look:\n\nAmount of kilograms * 2.2 = the result in pounds\n\nAs you see, the second formula is simpler. It could be better option if you need to make a conversion of 7.6 kilogram to pounds in fast way, for instance, during shopping. You only have to remember that final result will be not so exact.\n\nNow we want to show you these two versions of a formula in practice. But before we will make a conversion of 7.6 kg to lbs we are going to show you easier way to know 7.6 kg to how many lbs totally effortless.\n\n7.6 kg to lbs converter\n\nAnother way to know what is 7.6 kilogram equal to in pounds is to use 7.6 kg lbs calculator. What is a kg to lb converter?\n\nCalculator is an application. Converter is based on first version of a formula which we showed you above. Thanks to 7.6 kg pound calculator you can quickly convert 7.6 kg to lbs. You only have to enter amount of kilograms which you want to convert and click \u2018calculate\u2019 button. The result will be shown in a flash.\n\nSo let\u2019s try to convert 7.6 kg into lbs using 7.6 kg vs pound converter. We entered 7.6 as an amount of kilograms. Here is the result: 7.6 kilogram = 16.755131912 pounds.\n\nAs you see, our 7.6 kg vs lbs converter is so simply to use.\n\nNow we are going to our primary issue - how to convert 7.6 kilograms to pounds on your own.\n\n7.6 kg to lbs conversion\n\nWe are going to start 7.6 kilogram equals to how many pounds calculation with the first version of a formula to get the most correct result. A quick reminder of a formula:\n\nNumber of kilograms * 2.20462262 = 16.755131912 the result in pounds\n\nSo what need you do to know how many pounds equal to 7.6 kilogram? Just multiply number of kilograms, this time 7.6, by 2.20462262. It gives 16.755131912. So 7.6 kilogram is equal 16.755131912.\n\nYou can also round it off, for instance, to two decimal places. It is equal 2.20. So 7.6 kilogram = 16.720 pounds.\n\nIt is high time for an example from everyday life. Let\u2019s calculate 7.6 kg gold in pounds. So 7.6 kg equal to how many lbs? As in the previous example - multiply 7.6 by 2.20462262. It is exactly 16.755131912. So equivalent of 7.6 kilograms to pounds, when it comes to gold, is exactly 16.755131912.\n\nIn this example you can also round off the result. It is the result after rounding off, this time to one decimal place - 7.6 kilogram 16.72 pounds.\n\nNow let\u2019s move on to examples calculated using short formula.\n\nHow many 7.6 kg to lbs\n\nBefore we show you an example - a quick reminder of shorter formula:\n\nAmount of kilograms * 2.2 = 16.72 the result in pounds\n\nSo 7.6 kg equal to how much lbs? As in the previous example you need to multiply number of kilogram, this time 7.6, by 2.2. Look: 7.6 * 2.2 = 16.72. So 7.6 kilogram is 2.2 pounds.\n\nLet\u2019s do another conversion using shorer formula. Now calculate something from everyday life, for instance, 7.6 kg to lbs weight of strawberries.\n\nSo let\u2019s convert - 7.6 kilogram of strawberries * 2.2 = 16.72 pounds of strawberries. So 7.6 kg to pound mass is 16.72.\n\nIf you know how much is 7.6 kilogram weight in pounds and are able to calculate it with use of two different versions of a formula, let\u2019s move on. Now we are going to show you all results in tables.\n\nConvert 7.6 kilogram to pounds\n\nWe know that results shown in tables are so much clearer for most of you. We understand it, so we gathered all these results in tables for your convenience. Due to this you can easily make a comparison 7.6 kg equivalent to lbs outcomes.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a 7.6 kg equals lbs table for the first formula:\n\nKilograms Pounds Pounds (after rounding off to two decimal places)\n7.6 16.755131912 16.720\n\nAnd now see 7.6 kg equal pound table for the second version of a formula:\n\nKilograms Pounds\n7.6 16.72\n\nAs you see, after rounding off, if it comes to how much 7.6 kilogram equals pounds, the outcomes are not different. The bigger number the more significant difference. Please note it when you need to do bigger amount than 7.6 kilograms pounds conversion.\n\nHow many kilograms 7.6 pound\n\nNow you know how to calculate 7.6 kilograms how much pounds but we will show you something more. Are you curious what it is? What about 7.6 kilogram to pounds and ounces conversion?\n\nWe are going to show you how you can convert it little by little. Begin. How much is 7.6 kg in lbs and oz?\n\nFirst things first - you need to multiply number of kilograms, this time 7.6, by 2.20462262. So 7.6 * 2.20462262 = 16.755131912. One kilogram is 2.20462262 pounds.\n\nThe integer part is number of pounds. So in this example there are 2 pounds.\n\nTo check how much 7.6 kilogram is equal to pounds and ounces you need to multiply fraction part by 16. So multiply 20462262 by 16. It gives 327396192 ounces.\n\nSo your outcome is 2 pounds and 327396192 ounces. It is also possible to round off ounces, for instance, to two places. Then your outcome will be equal 2 pounds and 33 ounces.\n\nAs you can see, conversion 7.6 kilogram in pounds and ounces is not complicated.\n\nThe last calculation which we are going to show yo...

        "text":"\n\nChemistry - Everywhere Around the House\n\n  \u2022 Susan K. Stewart Contributing Writer\n  \u2022 2005 30 Mar\nChemistry - Everywhere Around the House\n\nThe laughter died down, John continued his tales of being a teenaged science geek. Again, he delighted everyone with stories of blowing up something in the basement and setting it on fire. Twenty years after the fact, it evokes laughter and John is an engineer for NASA developing new sub-space aircraft. To home educators, these stories bring trepidation about teaching laboratory science in general and chemistry in particular at home.\n\nChemistry textbooks are also fearsome, because they appear to be written in a foreign language. Often these books are written for science majors rather than for general science knowledge. And, our own understanding of the subject is discouraging. We were baffled in high school and we feel even more baffled now.\n\nIf the idea of a chemistry lab in your kitchen seems unrealistic, remember each time you cook a meal; you are applying principles of chemistry.\n\nWhat Exactly is Chemistry?\n\nChemistry is the scientific study of the substances that make up the universe. Chemists investigate the characteristics of these substances, how they behave under different conditions, and seek to understand chemical changes.\u00a0 Basic chemistry, then, is about kinds of substances, composition, structure, properties, and interaction of material substances.\n\nHow Chemistry is Studied?\n\nThe chemist investigates. Meaning the study of chemistry is active and is best studied through experimentation. Most experimentation involves taking substances, making changes, and recording the reaction.\n\nExperimentation, or testing, is used to prove statements that have been made about a substance. The statement iron will rust in water can be made. Then the statement is tested to be proven true or false. Many of the lab projects in high school chemistry books are these kinds of test.\n\nSome statements are not practical to test. They just need to be accepted because of the expense or danger to test. Acceptance of science statements can lead to a discussion about faith in God. Not all things can be proven, but can be accepted.\n\nBasic mathematics is necessary. Your student should know simple algebra and be familiar with the metric system. If you are using common household measurements, teach your student how to make conversions. Most chemistry books include a short chapter on these formulas. Study guides, such as Cliff Notes, will also have the formulas needed.\n\nChemistry Things Around the House\n\nA medium-sized chemistry set purchased at a toy store will provide many of the items needed to teach a well-rounded chemistry course including chemicals required in your chem lab books. The chemicals are relatively safe when directions are followed. A lab book is generally included with sequential projects and can be the basis for a general chemistry course.\n\nYou will need a source of gas fire.\u00a0 Temperatures can\u2019t be regulated with electric heat sources. Some experiments can be done on a regular gas-cooking stove.\n\nYou may be more comfortable with experiments that use a candle or micro-burner. In most case any small candle will work for a micro-burner. Micro-burners are available at school supply companies.\n\nAny laboratory brings to mind test tubes, beakers, culture dishes, and graduated cylinders. That\u2019s because chemicals should be mixed in glass utensils. Household glassware will often fill the bill.\n\nPyrex\u00ae custard dishes are great for growing cultures. Small juice glass can be used for mixing.\n\nTest tubes are in the chemistry set purchased at a toy store.\n\nA cooking thermometer works in most cases where temperature changes are being recorded. A glass Celsius thermometer will help your student begin thinking as a scientist.\n\nEye droppers are used to transfer small amounts of chemicals. I save glass dropper bottles that come with medication. Although these are getting harder to come by, you can ask a pharmacist.\n\nDon't use plastic in the place of glass. First, glass is neutral and won\u2019t react with the chemicals. Plastic gives off molecules that can alter the reaction of your experiment. Second, the chemical mixture can melt the plastic, making a mess to be cleaned up. Third, glass can be boiled to assure that you are using clean equipment.\n\nStore all of your science glass items away from the kitchen. You don\u2019t want to use a \u201cculture\u201d dish for pudding.\n\nKitchen Chemicals\n\nThe very word \u201cchemicals\u201d can bring fear to the heart of the most stalwart home educator. Actually most chemicals used in high school labs are already in your home.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to spend a lot of money or use anything that concerns you. If you look at a lab and are uncomfortable with what is used or the outcome, don't do it.\n\nThis list of chemicals, along with their common names, is taken from chemistry textbooks.\n\nSodium bicarbonate - baking soda\nH4Al2Si2O9 - cement\nAcetic acid (HC2H3O2) - vinegar\nNH4OH - ammonia\nH2O2 - hydrogen peroxide\nSodium chloride - salt\nCitric acid - lemon juice\nSodium hydroxide - lye (Drano)\nCarbon dioxide - soda pop\nMagnesium hydroxide - milk of magnesium\nNa4 B4 O7 - borax\nBoric acid\n\nAny of these chemicals can be purchased at drug stores or grocery stores.\n\nChemistry at Home\n\nCareful reading of the instructions by you and your students is the starting point of chemistry labs. If expected results are given, you can assess any danger. Remember that it\u2019s not necessary to do every experiment in the textbook.\n\nModels illustrate the unseen. A model of an atom or molecule will teach the basic structure and demonstrate how atoms join together to form molecules. Or, some students prefer to draw the atoms and molecules.\n\nTo test how chemicals react, they need to be mixed. Mixtures can be made with items you have at home.\n\nRemember the volcano that we built in elementary school? The lava flow can be the foundation for testing. We know mixing baking soda with vinegar makes the lava flow. Your student can test other concoctions to make a lava flow.\n\nBegin by learning why baking soda and vinegar react the way they do. With this information, your student can make an educated guess, a hypothesis, about other chemicals that may react the same way.\n\nMy sons often used the \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens\u201d method. They\u2019d state a hypothesis such as \u201cCola mixed with baking soda will create a lava flow.\u201d (Although not an educated guess, it was a guess.)\n\nWhen this hypothesis didn\u2019t work quite right, they then studied the vinegar and baking soda chemical reaction, including the chemical make-up of vinegar and cola. With this knowledge they were able change to \u201cchemicals\u201d that were similar to vinegar and test the reactions.\n\nMy boys learned the chemical make-up of various substances, how they react to each other and under what conditions, and some chemical formulas used to design further tests.\n\nSome household chemicals mixtures can be dangerous, so only mix combinations that you know the outcome. For example: bleach and ammonia mixed create a poisonous gas.\n\nChemistry is an everyday science. With a little adventurous sprit, some common sense, and a few household items, you too can teach chemistry in your kitchen.\n\nSusan K.
