        "text":"Sunset Cliffs Best Solar Companies In\n\nSo, what exactly is involved in calculating solar panels cost in Sunset Cliffs? When thinking about solar power very few people know the way the cost of solar panel systems is actually measured. Or even, for that matter, do we automatically grasp the connection relating to the cost of solar power and the value of solar power. We all know that gasoline prices are in dollars per gallon. We likewise are all aware of approximately how far we\u2019ll be able to drive after spending 40 bucks for a tank of gas. In contrast to a tank of gas, the value of which can be consumed pretty much instantly, solar panels deliver their value across a period of time.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost To Install A Solar Panel\n\nSunset Cliffs\u00a03 Undervalued Solar Leaders\n\nSolar Panel image by kuhar from Although it comes with a steep price tag, building your own solar energy system comes with many benefits. Depending on how much installation you do yourself, your payback period can be dramatically reduced. Building your own system requires advanced knowledge of home-improvement techniques, including electrical, circuitry and roofing. This project may take four to five full days of work, depending on how large of a system you are installing. Things You'll Need Pen Paper Solar panel kit Mounts Silicone with caulking gun Power drill Heat gun Charge controller Deep cycle batteries Insulated electrical wire AC inverter Wire strippers Soldering iron Adhesive-lined heat shrink tubing Electrical tape Write down on a sheet of paper the appliances that you are desiring to operate with solar power. Write out the total amp rating of each appliance as well as the number of hours that each appliance will operate throughout the day. Multiply the the amp rating for each appliance by the number of hours you plan to operate it. This number will indicate the total amp hours that you need to provide through your solar power system. Generally, the total amp hours from your appliances should equal no more than 50 percent of the total capacity of your battery bank. For example, if you plan to use your appliances for 200 amp hours on a daily basis, your battery bank should a charge up to 400 amp hours. This will help to determine the number of batteries that you need, however, the amperage on deep cycle batteries vary depending on which product you purchase for your system. Mount the solar panels on the south-facing portion of your roof-top by using a power drill and the mounting kits provided with the solar panels. Solar panels should be angled so that they match the latitude of your location, plus or minus 15 degrees depending on seasonal adjustments for the height of the sun. For example, if you live at a location where the latitudinal coordinate is 30 degrees, the panels should be mounted 30 degrees from horizontal. If your kit includes the ability to change the angle at which the solar panels are mounted, you should add an additional 15 degrees during summer months and subtract 15 degrees in the winter, when the sun's height is lower in the sky for a shorter duration of time. Solder 12 gauge electrical wiring to the two output terminals found on the side of the solar panel. The black 12 gauge wire should continue from the positive terminal of the solar panel and the white wire should connect with the negative terminal. Use the green wire to connect to the solar panel's frame as a way to ground the wire. Expose at least one inch of the copper wire by stripping the sheath of the two wires you are joining together. Twist the two wires being joined together into an \"X,\" wrapping the first wire's end along the length of the second wire until the first wire's end is completely wrapped around the second wire. Repeat the same process for the second wire. Heat the joint by holding the soldering iron beneath the wire joint. Apply the soldering iron and solder to the top part of the joint, adding more of the soldering wire until the joint is completely covered with solder and the exposed wires are no longer visible. Wrap adhesive-lined heat shrink tubing around the newly soldered joint, heating it tubing with a heat gun until it covers the solder. Connect the ends of the extended wiring coming from the solar panels to a charge controller, which has screw-on connections for input wires. The charge controller prevents the deep-cycle batteries from becoming overloaded, thus reducing the maintenance and cost of your solar power system. The charge controller should also be stored adjacent to the batteries. Wire the deep-cycle batteries together so that they form a circuit by using either a parallel or series pattern. Use 8-gauge wire to connect the batteries. To connect the batteries into a series circuit, which doubles the voltage of the system, wire the negative terminal of one battery to the positive terminal of its adjacent battery. Continue this pattern until all terminals are connected. To connect the batteries into a parallel circuit (which doubles the amperage of the system) connect the positive terminal of one battery to the positive terminal of its adjacent battery. Do the same for the negative terminals on your deep-cycle batteries as well. Install the input wires from the AC inverter, which are equipped with screw-on joints to mate with the battery terminals. The inverter will change the Direct Current from the batteries to Alternating Current, which is a usable form of electricity that home appliances utilize. Connect the ends output cables of the charge controller to the deep-cycle battery circuit. The charge controller's output cables, black for negative and red for positive, also screw onto the battery terminals with a screwdriver.

Tips & Warnings Currently, the 3-stage charge controller is the industry standard, however, using a Maximum Power Point Tracking controller will provide greater efficiency, especially if you are installing a larger system. Although a solar system is quite complicated to build, thinking of it in terms of \"layers\" may be helpful. The sun powers the solar cells, which are connected to a charge controller, which connect to the batteries, which connect to an inverter.

Solar Electricity System\n\n3 Undervalued Solar Leaders\n\nsolar cell research image by Albert Lozano from If you go camping or hunting, or simply want to reduce your electricity bill, then a solar panel might make a good investment for you. Solar panels can charge batteries and run tools and appliances, all for free. They require no fuel, and because they have no moving parts, they need very little in the way of repair and maintenance. The only cost associated with solar panels is the up-front purchase cost. Even this can be reduced by making your own solar panels at home. Things You'll Need Solar cells Sheet of plywood Saw Narrow wooden strips Electrically conductive glue Spool of wire Wire cutters with wire-stripping attachments Silicone caulk Calculate the number of solar cells you will need to make your solar panel. Different cells provide different voltages. Divide the voltage you want your panel to produce by the voltage rating of your solar cells. This will give you the number of cells you need to produce 12 volts. Add a couple volts' worth of cells to this number to eliminate the danger of backcharging, which can damage your solar panel. Cut the plywood into a size just large enough to hold all the cells you need for your panel. Glue the narrow wooden strips all around the perimeter of the plywood you have cut. After your cell is assembled, these will hold up the Plexiglas cover to protect your panel from damage. Leave a small gap between two of the strips to run the wires out of the panel. Attach the solar cells to the panel of plywood, using the electrically conductive glue. Leave a small amount of this glue peeking above the top of each cell in order to form an electric link to the terminals on the bottoms of the cells. This edge of glue will be referred to as the \"negative terminal\" of each cell. Cut 6-inch lengths of wire from your spool of wire, using the wire cutters. Make as many short wires as there are cells in your panel, minus one. Remove 1 inch of insulation from one end of each wire, and 3 inches from the other ends, using the wire cutters. Glue the 3-inch-bare ends of these wires to the tops of the solar cells. Do not let any glue run from the top of the cell and touch the negative terminal of that cell. Do not let any bare wire touch the negative terminals of the cells. Leave the final cell without a short wire on top. Glue each of these wires to the exposed glue peeking over the edge of the cell next to it, after having allowed the glue on the other ends to dry. Allow this glue to ... (truncated)",

So let's remind ourselves what an ANOVA actually is. In lots of tests, we want to compare three or more population means. And we want to see if there's a significant difference between the means.\n\nAnd the procedure for comparing three or more population means is called Analysis of Variance, also called ANIVA. So this would be a situation that would give rise to an ANOVA test. Suppose that we had some 10 point cleanliness scale that we were ranking detergents on.\n\nSo based on this one factor, detergent, we are trying to see how clean the clothes get on average. Now, it's worth noting that this is not enough information to actually run an ANOVA test. You would need more information than just this, but this is a situation which would lead you to an ANOVA test.\n\nBecause we're only looking at the one factor of detergent affecting cleanliness, in this case, this is called a one way ANOVA. Now, suppose that we included water temperature. It's possible that some of these detergents do better in different-- a better job of cleaning in different temperatures of water.\n\nAnd so now that we have all of this additional information, now we're actually looking at 12 treatments for detergents and three water temperatures for each detergent. Now there are 12 treatments. There are two factors that are factoring into the cleanliness score.\n\nIt's the water temperature and the type of detergent. Because there are two factors that are affecting the cleanliness score, we can still do an ANOVA test. But this time, it's called a two way ANOVA. Again, there's not enough information here to actually run the test.\n\nBut this is a situation that would give rise to a two way ANOVA. So to recap, in one way Analysis of Variance, we can consider population means that are based on just one characteristic. In our example, that was detergent, or one factor.\n\nIn two way ANOVA, we considered the comparisons based on multiple characteristics or factors. So in our example, that was the detergents and the water temperatures. So we talked about one way ANOVA versus a two ANOVA. Good luck and we'll see you next time.\n\nAdditional Practice Problems\n\nFull Screen\n  \u2022 One-Way ANOVA\n\n    A hypothesis test that compares three or more population means with respect to a single characteristic or factor.\n\n  \u2022 Two-Way ANOVA\n\n    A hypothesis test that compares three or more population means with respect to multiple characteristics or factors.",

Students will develop the abilities necessary to do basic scientific inquiry:\n\n      \u2022 Ask questions about objects, organisms, and events in the environment.\n\n      \u2022 Plan and conduct a simple investigation.\n\n      \u2022 Employ simple equipment and tools to gather data and extend the senses.\n\n      \u2022 Use data to construct a reasonable explanation.\n\n      \u2022 Communicate investigations and explanations.\n\n    1. Students will understand basic ideas related to scientific inquiry:\n\n      \u2022 Scientific investigations involve asking and answering a question and comparing the answer with what scientists already know about the world.\n\n      \u2022 Scientists use different kinds of investigations depending on the questions they are trying to answer.\n\n      \u2022 Simple instruments provide more information than scientists can obtain using only their senses.\n\n      \u2022 Scientists develop explanations using observations and what is already known about the world; good explanations are based on evidence from investigations.\n\n      \u2022 Scientists make the results of their investigations public, describing it in a way that allows others to repeat the investigation.\n\n      \u2022 Scientists review and ask questions about the results of other scientists' work.\n\n  \u2022 Life Science (K-4) -- Content Standard C:\n\n    1. Students will learn about the life cycles of organisms:\n\n      \u2022 Organisms have life cycles that include different stages. The details are different for different organisms.\n\n    1. Students will learn that organisms cause changes in the environments where they live:\n\n      \u2022 All organisms cause changes in the environment where they live. Some are harmful to the organism, while others are beneficial. Humans change environments in ways that can be either beneficial or detrimental for themselves and other organisms.\n\n  \u2022 Science in Personal and Social Perspectives (K-4) -- Content Standard F:\n\n      \u2022 Students will develop an understanding of changes in environments:\n\n      \u2022 Environments are the space, conditions, and factors that affect an individual's and a population's ability to survive and their quality of life.\n\n      \u2022 Changes in environments can be natural or influenced by humans.\n\n      \u2022 Some environmental changes occur slowly, and others occur rapidly.\n\nConcepts, Skills, Attitudes \/ Habits of Mind Emphasized:\n\nMajor Concepts:\n\n  1. Life Cycle Changes:\n\n    1. Decomposers are a vital link in the natural cycle of life and death.\n\n    2. Through decomposition, minerals and nutrients, once useful to their plant or animal hosts, are released and recycled.\n\n  2. Interdependence:\n\n    1. Every organism in a population has a niche in the ecosystem (producer, decomposer, consumer).\n\n    2. Organisms may interact with one another in several different ways: predator\/prey, producer\/consumer, parasite\/host; one organism may scavenge or decompose another.\nKey Science Skills:\n\n  1. Asking questions about objects, organisms, and events in the environment\n\n  2. Planning and conducting simple investigations\n\n  3. Communicating investigations and explanations\n\nKey Science Attitudes \/ Habits of Mind:\n\n  \u2022 Curiosity\n\n  \u2022 Respect for evidence and reasoning\n\n  \u2022 Interest in and respect for the natural world\n\nKey Science Content:\n\n  \u2022 Decomposition is the natural breaking down of organic materials. It is the main way that nutrients are recycled into the soil.\n\n  \u2022 In the process of decomposition, complex molecules are reduced to simple molecules.\n\n  \u2022 The decomposition of organic matter begins with large organisms in the soil such as earthworms, beetles, and slugs. These organisms break down the organic matter into smaller pieces that smaller organisms like fungi and bacteria can further decompose.\n\n  \u2022 As decomposers break down organic materials, they release the nutrients back to the soil to be used by the next generation of plants, and the cycle begins again. Over time, the organic materials will actually become part of the soil, enriching it in the process.\n\nEmbedded Assessment Techniques -- Tools to Assess Science Skills:\n\n  1. Summary of Evidence. This is a narrative summary, written by the teacher and based on teacher observations and review of student work. It is used to evaluate students' questioning and observation skills as well as content understanding. Students' work will be collected from their individual science journals. Work reviewed will include sketches, investigation plans, data collections, observations, and questions. The teacher should look for expressions of attitudes and feelings, evidence of conceptual knowledge, indications that the student has achieved skills in using equipment, and indications that the student has carried out scientific processes.\n\n  2. Scale\/Rubric. Use to describe students' progress in communicating their ideas and explanations.\n\nMaterials and Resources Needed:\n\n\nscience journals\ndrawing, writing, and graph paper\nsoil thermometers\nbug boxes\nplastic bags\nplant debris\nfruit peels\ngrass clippings\nempty 2-liter bottles\nmeasuring cups\nother materials as requested by students\n\n\nPeople\/Experts: naturalist from a state park; National Gardening Association staff member. You may of course substitute other experts.\n\nWeb sites: Soil Organic Matter Decomposition and Nutrient Cycling http:\/\/www.geog.ouc.bc.ca\/physgeog\/contents\/9q.html\n\nLessons Prior to Unit:\n\n(Lesson plan adapted from \"Fungus Among Us,\" GROWING ACTIVITIES FOR GROWING MINDS, the National Gardening Association.)\n\n  \u2022 Week One: Work with students to gather samples of soil from schoolyard and dissect the soil -- looking for and listing ingredients. Help students to note the importance of recording location and conditions when samples are taken.\n\n  \u2022 Week Two: Work with students on sketching observations in nature and on using descriptive language. Discuss the importance of capturing detail in sketches and words. Relate this to work of naturalists.\n\nThe Teaching Cycle:\n\n  1. Laying the groundwork (how to inspire interest and find out what students already know)\n\n    Objective: Students to observe and begin to understand the process of decomposition.\n\n    \u2022 Week Three\/First Week of Decomposition Unit:\n\n      1. Students observe that teacher has gathered decomposing materials in plastic bags. Students predict and record changes in the contents of the plastic bags (over one-week period).\n\n      2. Class Discussion: How did the changes compare with predictions? Where have you noticed this kind of change before? What do you think might be causing this change? Where have you seen examples of once-living things changing and decomposing in the environment? If leaves, twigs, old plant stems, and other natural materials are constantly dying and falling to the ground, why do you think we're not buried under them?\n\n        Explain to students that the same type of changes occurring in the bags constantly occur outdoors. Once-living materials are broken down by millions of microscopic bacteria, fungi, and other decomposers.\n\n      3. Prepare for field exploration by discussing some do's and don'ts of field work.\n\n    \u2022 Week Four:\n\n      1. Prior to boarding the bus, prepare for field exploration. Ask: \"What could we see that would tell us if decomposition is occurring? Where do you think will be the best spots to look for decomposition? When picking up samples, why might it be important not to touch the item with your bare hand? What do you think will be important information to record in your journals?\"\n\n      2. Using the list generated the previous week, review with students how scientists behave while doing research. (It might include: handling equipment with care, using time wisely in our outdoor classroom, not damaging plants, staying inside boundaries, not putting anything in our mouths, not throwing things or chasing animals, working quietly so as not to scare off wildlife, and not touching dead animals.)\n\n      3. Students undertake field exploration to look for examples of decomposition in the environment and for signs of decomposers. (This trip could also take place after the students have set up their explorations and are waiting for results before making connections.)\n\n      4. Back in the classroom: journal entries on the topic \"The best part about doing field work is . . . \"\n\n      5. Review students' previous explorations of soil, focusing on the parts of soil and the importance of living and once-living matter in soils. Ask students: \"Based on what you saw in the plastic bags and on the field exploration, how do you think microorganisms might help create more soil? How could we explore this?\"\n\n  2. Exploration (how questions for exploration will be chosen, investigations managed, and students grouped)\n\n    Objective: Students to understand that soil hastens decomposition of living matter, which, in turn, becomes part of the soil.\n\n    \u2022 Week Five:\n\n      1. Ask: \"How could we set up an investigation to examine whether soil helps once-living things decompose?\"\n\n      2. Students work in small groups to design investigations. You could use the Research Proposal form from ECO-INQUIRY, pages 230 and 231, as a guide. (See ECO-INQUIRY: A GUIDE TO ECOLOGICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES FOR THE UPPER ELEMENTARY\/MIDDLE GRADES, by Kathleen Hogan, Kendall\/Hunt Publishing Company, 1994.)\n\n      3. Students meet with teacher to discuss small-group plans.\n\n      4. Whole-class discussion of plans for observation and care. Develop recording sheets. (Data collection could include measurable changes in weight, height, and temperature, and observable changes in smell and appearance.)\n\n      5. Make \"decomposition columns\" from 2-liter bottles and materials provided -- lettuce, twigs, leaves, fruit peels, etc. (A decomposition c... (truncated)",

This process includes the following steps: the question or purpose of the experiment, research, a hypothesis, the experiment, analysis, and finally the conclusion.\n\nScientists and students alike use the scientific method because it is an organized way to figure something out.\n\nFirst, there must be a purpose or question. This is the question that is being asking or is asked. It is the thing that is being checked on or to learn about.\n\nAfter settling on a question, the next step is research. Before starting an experiment, one must learn as much information about the subject as possible.\n\nOnce a topic is thoroughly researched, one can then decide on the hypothesis. The hypothesis is an educated guess. What does one predict will happen? What is the answer to the question proposed? Hypotheses statements tend to be the \"If..., then...\" form. For example, \"If I mix red food coloring with blue food coloring, then the color will turn to purple.\"\n\nAfter the hypothesis comes the experiment. First decide on a test or procedure to conduct that will allow an answer to the hypothesis. Within the experiment, there will likely be an independent variable, the part that will be tested or change, and a dependent variable, the part that will not be tested. The dependent variable is the variable that will respond or not respond to the changing independent variable.\n\nWhen finishing the experiment, the next step is the analysis. This is data or information. In the analysis, write down everything that happened during the experiment, the things that changed and the things that did not change.\n\nThe final step is the conclusion. This is when it's determined if the hypothesis was correct or not. Check to see if the data recorded supports the hypothesis.",

In other words, the only factors of a prime are the trivial factor and the improper factor.\n\nA number that has a nontrivial proper factor is said to be composite.\n\nThe number 1, therefore, is neither a prime nor a composite. All other numbers which are not prime are composite. The number 2 is the smallest prime.\n\n\n6 is composite, as 6 = 2\u00d73.

Set the first sieve prime = 2.\n  2. Cross out all multiples of the current sieve prime.\n  3. Look for the next larger, not crossed-out number. It will become the new sieve prime.\n  4. Repeat this process from 2. as long as the sieve prime is not larger that the square root of M.\n\nWe demonstrate the process with numbers less than 50.\n\nLet p =\n\n\nFind all primes between 50 and 100.

When doing this the first thing that you want to do is put the mixed numbers into a improper fraction form. From this step you can simplify the numbers based on what you are using. In this case you can take out the 3 and 21 and simplify it to 1 and 7 respectively. From here you do the basic multiplication to get one improper fraction. Then turn this number back into a mixed fraction to complete your problem.\n\nWant to master Microsoft Excel and take your work-from-home job prospects to the next level?

Most people know the common materials that can be recycled, including glass, plastic, cardboard and newspapers. However, you can also recycle less common items, such as water filters. When you participate in recycling, you help renew our resources and protect the planet. You can feel good about what you're doing, and once you know where to go and what to do, recycling takes very minimal time and effort.\n\nCheck the brand of your water filters. If you have a Brita or TerraFlo filter, you can send the old water filters back to the company to be recycled. These companies have recycling programs in place to make recycling your water filter a quick and process.\n\nCheck what type of plastic of which your filter is made. If it's #5 plastic, you can recycle it at your local Whole Foods grocery store. You may also be able to take it to your local recycling centre.\n\nCall your local Whole Foods and recycling centre to find out if other types of plastic can be dropped off for recycling. If your filter isn't a #5 filter, you may still be able to recycle it at these locations.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\n  \u2022 Old water filter\nbibliography-icon icon for annotation tool Cite this Article\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJ.

These tests will show if delays and cost overruns are arising for one or two reasons. The first could be because the components of the product don\u2019t interface with each other as a system. This is analogous to putting together a child\u2019s bike. If the parts in the box don\u2019t fit, then you won\u2019t have something that looks like a bike. The second could be due to incomplete requirements that went into building the components, which would result in a system not functioning as expected. In the bike example, even if the parts do fit, the bike may not work as intended. For instance, the bike doesn\u2019t stop properly because the brakes don\u2019t have proper contact with the wheels.",

        "text":"DC Current Measurement Using Shunt Resistor\n\nDC Current Measurement Using Shunt Resistor\n\nThe method we are going to discuss in this portion is by using \u201cshunt resistor\u201d but this method has limitations itself. The biggest one is we cannot measure the high currents through this method.\n\nIn this method we apply a resistor in the series of load so that whole current should flow through the resistor and the voltage drop across the resistor will be directly proportional to current.\n\nI\u2019ll illustrate this example with 8 watt load. The measurement will be done through the ATmega8 micro-controller which displays the results on computer through serial communication.\n\n\nTo study about serial communication click the link below:\n\nSerial Communication through Atmel AVR Micro-controllers\n\nThe resistors in markets are available in different wattages like \u00bc watt, 2 watts, 5 watts etc which tells us the current bearing capacity of resistor. In DC voltage Measurement we can use any wattage of resistors for measurement because we apply resistor in parallel with load. But in current measurements we apply resistor in series and if apply a resistor of 2 watts and passed the 3 Amps with 12 volts, it will fry the resistor. So, you should carefully take care of wattage of the shunt resistor according to your load.\n\nSome persons still prefer the use of shunt resistor in current measurement due to its low cost. But it is not a good choice because things get pretty messy and heat up at high currents.\n\nDC current Measurement\nFigure 1: Complete Circuit Diagram of Ammeter\n\nThe whole circuit diagram of the project is shown in the figure 1. There are two shunt resistors present in the circuit. The reason behind using two resistors is to increase the wattage and decrease the resistance of the shunt. Both resistors are of 0.1 ohm. If we apply resistor parallel formula then we will get 0.05 ohms. At a load of 1 ampere according to ohms law:-\n\nV = I * R\n\u00a0V = 1amp * 0.05 ohms\n\u00a0V = 0.05 volts\n\n0.05volts is basically the voltage drop across the shunt which can easily neglect. I used ATmega8 for the coding which I\u2019ll explain later.\u00a0 We will get 0.05 volts at 1 ampere but at milli-amperes even more less voltage drop will occur. This much less voltage is not possible to detect through the micro-controller. So I applied a difference amplifier to amplify the voltage as shown in the figure1. The variable resistor R1 is present here to set the reference voltage of the amplifier. It should be set in such a way that a reasonable voltage will generate at the output of the amplifier.\n\n\nComponents for DC Current Measurment\nFigure 2: Components needed for the project\n\nI used a 4Ah 12 volt battery as a voltage source and the load is two LED bulb of rating 3 watts and 5 watts. As my total load is 8 watts so I used two 5 watt shunt resistors in parallel which gave me 10 watts range for the load.\n\nBreadboard Implementation of DC current Measurement\nFigure 3: Implementation on bread board\n\n\nComplete Setting for DC current Measurement\nFigure 4: Whole System\n\nCoding part:\n\nAs I told before that we will display our results on computer so I used UART registers of ATmega8.\u00a0 To learn that how to communicate your micro-controller with computer study the links below:\n\nWe will not get much voltage at the output of amplifier due to small load so I used the internal reference voltage of the ADC which is 2.56 volts.\n\n\/\/ initialize adc\nvoid adc_init()\nADMUX = (1<<REFS0) | (1<<REFS1);\u00a0 \/\/ To use the internal reference voltage 2.56volts\nADCSRA = (1<<ADEN)|(1<<ADPS2)|(1<<ADPS1)|(1<<ADPS0); \/\/Enabling ADC and setting prescalar\n\nThe function mentioned above is to initialize the ADC of micro-controller. ADMUX register is used to set the reference voltage. We have option to set externally the reference voltage which should be maximum of 5v.\n\n\/\/ 10 Samples per second\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nfor (int j=0; j <= 9; j++) {\n\u00a0v[i] = adc_read(0);\n\u00a0volt = volt + v[i];\n\nvolt = volt \/10; \/\/ to take the average of voltage\nconv = (double)volt * 2.56\/1024; \/\/to convert the sample into voltage\n\/\/ here 2.56 is the reference voltage\n\nstring_transmit(\"Current = \"); \/\/ Transmitting to the computer\n\nThe above code is to get the 10 samples\u00a0 of voltage at the output of the amplifier.\n\nResults on Putty\nFigure 5: Final results on putty\n\nTo download the whole code click the button below:\n\nComplete Code\n\n\n\nIf you need any help regarding code or circuit feel free to contact us and don't forget to like our facebook page \ud83d\ude42\n\nWant something more to learn?\n\nIsmail Sarwar\n\nElectrical engineering is my profession, my hobby and my passion.
