In this paper, we show how to use the recently developed firefly algorithm to solve non-linear design problems. For the standard pressure vessel design optimisation, the optimal solution found by FA is far better than the best solution obtained previously in the literature. In addition, we also propose a few new test functions with either singularity or stochastic components but with known global optimality and thus they can be used to validate new optimisation algorithms. Possible topics for further research are also discussed.\n\n\nis only available to individual subscribers or to users at subscribing institutions.\n\nExisting subscribers:\nGo to Inderscience Online Journals to access the Full Text of this article.\n\nPay per view:\nIf you are not a subscriber and you just want to read the full contents of this article, buy online access here.\n\nComplimentary Subscribers, Editors or Members of the Editorial Board of the International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation (IJBIC):\nLogin with your Inderscience username and password:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Username:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Password:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nForgotten your password?\n\nWant to subscribe?\nA subscription gives you complete access to all articles in the current issue, as well as to all articles in the previous three years (where applicable).
