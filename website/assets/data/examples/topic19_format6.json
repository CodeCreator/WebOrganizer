        "text":"Weathering-induced iron dissolution and precipitation in rock masses lead to reduction in shear strength of discontinuities, amongst others, while precipitation leads to an increase, and precipitated iron may reduce the susceptibility to future weathering. This effect is investigated in fieldwork campaigns with detailed rock mass characterization and chemical analyses in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. Many cut slopes in this area consist of different zones in which iron in various forms is either dissolved or precipitated. Iron-coated and -cemented discontinuities have a marked higher shear friction, while staining has little influence on friction. Discontinuities with iron-coating and -cementing reduce the susceptibility to weathering of a rock mass as weathered material is less easily eroded and underlying material is protected from further weathering. On the other hand, dissolution zones, which are mostly found below the precipitation zones, have considerably lower rock mass quality. In engineering works the latter are invisible before excavation. Just assuming the continuation downward of the surface rock mass with precipitated iron, or, worse than this, assuming a less weathered rock mass with better characteristics, may be very erroneous. This study emphasizes that forecasting the susceptibility to weathering should include the influence of morphology, environment and climate.\n\nYou do not currently have access to this article.",

We are including the first couple of paragraphs and a link to the complete article.\n\nHow the Salton Sea Became an Eco Wasteland\n\nSalton Sea Homes\n\nCalifornia\u2019s largest inland lake, the Salton Sea, lies in the Imperial and Coachella valleys. The lake, which is more than 50 percent saltier than the Pacific Ocean, is becoming more salt than water because it\u2019s essentially evaporating. The lake and the area that surrounds it \u2014 once hotspots for tourism and wildlife\u00a0\u2014 have essentially become ghost towns.\n\nBut while people no longer visit, the lake\u2019s evaporation still has consequences for both humans and animals. Rates of asthma there are disproportionately high and are thought to be caused by dust blown up from the dry lakebed. Meanwhile fish populations are plummeting as are populations of migratory birds. So, what is happening at the Salton Sea and is anything being done about it?\n\nWhat Is the Salton Sea?\n\nFirst, a little backstory. The Salton Sea has existed in many forms over millennia, depending on changing flows of water from the nearby Colorado River. It\u2019s located in the Salton Basin near the Mexican border, and geologic evidence shows it has alternated between mostly freshwater, mostly saltwater and nearly dry.\n\nThe sea was in a dry phase when in 1905, the Colorado River overflowed, and, due to human error, breached its levees, flooding the desert valley for two years. This created the 400-square-mile (1,036-square-kilometer) inland lake, which was larger than Lake Tahoe.\n\nIn the 1920s, locals decided to divert agricultural irrigation runoff to the lake, which kept it alive longer than it probably would have on its own, given it\u2019s located in a desert where temperatures frequently soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).\n\nContinue reading the article by clicking here.",

However, the unknown is favored in science since scientists use well-defined ignorance to direct their research. With each problem solved unsolved problems and thus new horizons regarding the unknown become visible. Answers do not simply resolve questions, they provoke new ones. In an alleged post-truth world and an era of alternative facts, it seems important to analyze ever new unknowns in order to better understand why and when ignorance in the media, in everyday life, or in science and engineering may have certain effects towards decision making and the construction of \u201cfacts.\u201d In this way, I will discuss some categories on how to analyze nonknowledge in order to raise awareness of its normality and to illuminate ignorance as regular rather than deviant. After all, it appears to be the ignorance of ignorance that is the biggest barrier to new knowledge.\n\n\nTags: frias\nKategorien: FRIAS, Lunch Lectures\n\nProf. Dr. Matthias Gro\u00df (Department of Urban and Environmental Sociology Helmholtz Centre\u00a0for Environmental Research - UFZ\u00a0Leipzig)\n\nZeige mehr\n\nMehr Medien in \"Lunch Lectures\"",
