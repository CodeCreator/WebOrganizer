        "text":"Join the Meeting Place for Moms!\nTalk to other moms, share advice, and have fun!\n\n(minimum 6 characters)\n\n1 Bump\n\nDo you think it's a reasonable decision to cut a family member out of your life if they are toxic?\n\nIf so, what do you do about other family members who you love and cherish and don't want to hurt in the process? I have been bullied by my Sister for 40 years now and I just don't want to deal with it anymore. My husband understands where I'm coming from, but says it's not Christian of me to do it, but she is the one who is not treating others in a Christian way. Has anyone been through this? What did you do?\n\n\nAsked by Anonymous at 9:23 AM on Mar. 22, 2011 in Relationships\n\nThis question is closed.\nAnswers (27)\n  \u2022 \"Christian\"??? \u00a0I must have missed the part of the bible that tells people to be doormats, and to intentionally put them self in the position of being bullied. \u00a0Perhaps your hubby should go talk to the priest, minister, etc... and get a bit more perspective.\n\n    Yes, if she is THAT toxic then you cut her out... but your not mean, rude, or hurtful... you just end ties. \u00a0Be polite to the other family and simply explain that you have had a parting of ways and you will not be discussing it or involving ANYone else in your decision.\n\n\n    Answer by Anonymous at 9:27 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 I would cut that person out and refrain from attending any family functions where that person may attend. I don't know if I have cut a person out per say, but I have drastically cut the amount of interaction that we have. My sister is toxic and I cant stand the way she treats others especially her child.\n\n    Answer by coala at 9:26 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 I have issues with my uncle and his wife. Similar, but what i think is best to do is speak to her one last time, and say, this is what needs to happen, if it doesn't, for the sake of my sanity, i will need to cut you out of my life for awhile! Never make it permanent and always be casual for your family's sake at holiday events, but otherwise keep your distance. Good luck!\n\n    Answer by JenzAmomOf2 at 9:26 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 Yes if they are not good for you cut them out. Now since it's your sister I'm sure there will be times where you have no choice but to be around her. Like holidays and family functions and such. So just be civil. Don't go out of your way to not speak or be a butt. You don't have to answer to anyone and if she doesn't add to your life in some way. By supporting you or whatever then no I don't feel you need her.\n\n    Answer by StefInfection at 9:27 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 My father and his side of my family where out of my life until I was an adult and found them. it took the 3 months for me to realize why my mother didn't want me around them. Now I chat once in a while with siblings online but keep it at that. I don't talk to my father. sometimes family is bad for you. if cutting her out isn't for you then limit the contact.\n\n    Answer by Liamsmom09 at 9:28 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 My husband made a decision to cut his own father out of his life. Its been 13 years and he hasnt spoken to him since. If you love someone you understand why they do the things they do. So if people dont respect you and the reason you want to do it , who cares. Your doing this for YOU!\n\n    Answer by jmgblair10 at 9:28 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 Absolutely!! I made this decision on New Year's 2009, and DO NOT REGRET IT!!! It has made my life much easier, and the stress level has dropped to a managable level for me and my family. I'm sorry that things like this happen to people, but sometimes, you need to think of how your relationships with your siblings, or other family members affect you, your children and SO. The toxic family members in my life almost cost me my marriage, and my son couldn't handle all the fighting and negativity.\n\n    Answer by Robsmommy at 9:28 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 I'm going through something similar. I've decided to avoid all get togethers where my older sister will be present. It's become far too emotionally intense for me to deal with this anymore. My mom understands that it's what I need to do...although it's somewhat upsetting as the cousins rarely see each other as it is. But, I can't let myself be subject to my sisters mental instabilities.\n\n    Answer by Acid at 9:28 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 its not so much about being christian with about haveing healthy relationships with loved ones and keeping a healthy state of mind. toxic relationships are not good to have and can have very bad effects on a person. i have cut out several toxic people in my life and yes i do feel guilty but my life is much better now and all the negative drama has come to a stop. it was to the point that it was not only effecting me but it was effecting my whole family so i had to put a stop to it. gl i wish you the best.\n\n    Answer by laura970 at 9:30 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\n  \u2022 I have also a sister like this and she doesn't even realize that she does this. I have cut the time spent with her but it hurts because that means I see less of her kids. I put up with the drama so I can see them and for social events like holidays, parties and weddings, etc. I just had an encounter with her the other day and every time, she makes my opinions seem worthless. You can tell her how she makes you feel but beware, she may act the victim and turn it around. Well, at least in my case, she does.\n\n    Answer by Philly247 at 9:33 AM on Mar. 22, 2011\n\nclose Join now to connect to\nother members!\nConnect with Facebook or Sign Up Using Email\n\nAlready Joined?

We both take Amrit and I told him that you are not allowed to do that but still he is going and he is not wearing his kirpan. What can I do I don't understand he told me that he want to quit that but he said he can't do that because now he is addictive can anyone tell me what can I do to recover him coz I don't wanna leave him in this situation I love him so much he need help please tell me what can I do\n\n\nedit retag flag offensive close merge delete\n\n3 answers\n\nSort by \u00bb oldest newest most voted\n\nanswered 2017-02-10 22:16:01 -0600\n\nstrongKaur gravatar image\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your situation. I don\u2019t know if any of this advice will help, but here\u2019s some ideas. Firstly, he needs to recognize his problem. It sounds like he does because he wants to quit, but perhaps he might not realize the full extent of his problem and the impact its having on your relationship and it sounds like your wellbeing as well. It sounds like he started gambling a year ago and has stopped wearing his kirpan, etc. What changed in this year for him? What is driving this change? Try to help him figure that out for himself. Is he depressed? Is he stressed out? Ultimately I mean it\u2019s his problem and he really needs to have the motivation to be able to make this change to work on his problem, but you can try to help by having those conversations with him. Gambling can go really really bad- like he could start stealing if he runs out of money to gamble with, or when you get married he could use up all of your money\/savings, and you could lose your house, etc. If he wants to get over this he needs to have some support, but also target where this is coming from. If he\u2019s depressed for example he needs to learn other ways of coping. He might benefit from counseling. He can surround himself with sangat that uplifts him, and supports him in staying away from this. He can give up using his credit cards and have someone help with finances.\n\nI think you seriously need to think about this before you get married!! Remember, you have the right to choose to delay your wedding or to walk away at all times. You don\u2019t want to be trapped and unhappy. You need to focus on what you need and the life ahead of you.\n\nedit flag offensive delete link more\n\nanswered 2017-02-13 09:34:11 -0600\n\nSingh2000 gravatar image\n\nwaheguru ji ka khalsa waheguruji ki fateh\n\nJagmeet Kaur Ji, I am fully agree with Strong Kaur.

You can't \"recover him.\" He has to realize his situation and truly want to come out of it. It has to come from within him. If he sincerely does not want to stop, then nothing you do will make him stop. If he truly wants to get out of it, then he should contact Gambler's Anonymous There is also support for families and loved ones in relationship with gamblers at Gam-Anon.\n\nEven though you are engaged, you may want to put off marriage until this situation is completely resolved.\n\nedit flag offensive delete link more\n\nYour Answer\n\nPlease start posting anonymously - your entry will be published after you log in or create a new account.\n\nAdd Answer\n\n[hide preview]\n\nQuestion Tools\n\n1 follower\n\n\nAsked: 2017-02-09 18:59:49 -0600\n\nSeen: 47 times\n\nLast updated: Feb 13",

        "text":"Is there something going on between my wife and her ex?\n\nI think there is something brewing between my wife of 15 years and an old friend of mine Peter. Peter and my wife were fuck buddies back in college and I met her through him. Recently they started commenting on FB about how each other looked so good etc. This got me irritated so I asked my wife what was up. She told me I was delusional.\n\nThen she left her FB open on the family computer and I see that she has send a string of emojis to him in a private message. I mean who private messages a string of emojis to an ex sex partner aka [a truly 'great' friend], it's like a school girl flirting. I brought this up during our marriage counseling session and a like always a big fight broke out. After our session my wife gets home 45 minutes after I do [we left in separate cars from the same place]. Then a few minutes after she gets back my old pal Peter posts a picture of him and I back in the day with the caption \"One of my favorites!\". I haven't had any communication with this guy in 15years, no calls, no emails, no FB post comments, nothing. Then to top it off exactly 1 hour after he posted the picture he adds the comment \"I'm guessing no comment from Jim\". Am I to believe that this is a coincident, that after our marriage counseling session I get those messages - am I being paranoid or is he trying to 'feel me out'.\n  \u2022 Yes Something is up!\n    Vote A\n  \u2022 No you're seeing things!\n    Vote B\nSelect age and gender to cast your vote:\nI'm a GirlI'm a Guy\nI forgot to mention she insisted I drop Peter as a friend as soon as we got married. Then earlier this year when I complained how I never see my old friends she told me how Peter tried to get in her pants after we got married\n\n\nMost Helpful Guy\n\n  \u2022 Yeah there is something going on. Maybe not something physical or anything but they already have past history and seem like they are engaging in inappropriate flirting and reliving past things.Since you are already in marriage counseling before this there is already a deep strain on the relationship and old friend Peter seems to be the \"shoulder to lean on for support\", it is also not a coincidence at all that he popped up on FB. She ran and told him right away what happen at your session.\n\n    \u2022 Exactly what I was thinking. Definitely in Emotional Affair mode, you agree?\n\n    \u2022 Yeah I think so. Reminiscing of old times how time where before and then flirting a bit I think is happening. It is poor in taste and a slap in the face to you and your marriage for her to associate with him especially during this delicate part in your marriage.\n\nRecommended Questions\n\nHave an opinion?\n\nWhat Girls Said 2\n\n  \u2022 Definitely sounds like something is up.\n\n    Also, if your wife tells you to stop being friends with someone, then she's a shitty wife. Why would you marry someone, who wants to control who you're allowed to be friends with?\n\n    I like how at first she didn't want you to do anything with Peter and is now messaging him all the time and then he posts that pic and tags you with sweet talk after no contact for 15 years. Hmm...\n\n    Yeah, you married a hoe. Sorry, brah.\n\n    \u2022 No my dear, I'm the one who's sorry!\n\n    \u2022 I think it's time to corner her.\n\n      Tell her you know everything. Most people break under that sort of pressure and confess. Just ask leading on questions, she'll make up her own verdict.\n\n      \"So... I've just found out. When were you going to tell me?\"\n      \"I know everything now, . Please don't lie to me. Or should I go ahead and ask him instead?\"\n\n  \u2022 I don't think your friend Peter is a genuine loyal friend. I think he may have feelings for her if he started a conversation first with your wife on Facebook...I don't know though but the situation isn't good. Rocky waters. The flirtaciousness between them is not good especially if it's excessive and\/or she lies to you about talking with him or acts extra nervous when you bring up Peter.\n\n\nWhat Guys Said 3\n\n  \u2022 ...Why would you even marry a girl who was fuck buddies with your friend in the first place?\n\n  \u2022 I would get all the best divorce lawyers on retainer ASAP, bro. She's up to no good for sure.\n\n    \u2022 Sounds like the pic was to try to make you feel more at ease with whatever they're doing\/planning.\n\n    \u2022 After the divorce, do yourself a favour. Date someone way younger and hotter and don't get married again lol.\n\n  \u2022 methinks the lady doth protest too much.\n\n\nRecommended myTakes",

My hubby was convinced that traditional marriage wasn't for us despite the misgivings I had and he's right. For me love is not something I can deny nor do I want to deny. Being open has allowed both of us to be ourselves, truly ourselves with no reservations. Our relationship still has it's ups and downs. We both deal with stronger emotions than what I'd expect in traditional marriage. The level of commitment is higher I feel because we've eliminated the biggest divorce reason off the table.

        "text":"How to stop missing someone who doesn't miss you?\n\nIt's a terrible conundrum, one that makes no sense and is self-defacing. Yet, I can't help it. What should I do?\n\nWhat's Your Opinion?\n\n\nMost Helpful Opinion\n\n  \u2022 i know what you mean, its been years for me and I still miss him but don't contact him or anything I feel like its his call to do that because he dumped me. Anyways, time and distance helps, get rid of everything that reminds you of her, stop going places that you went with her, just distract yourself whenever you think of her, focus in school go out with friends, find that one friend you can let it out to and talk with about it, music helps a lot, I love going for a nice jog hearing music its so relaxing. Music helps me get my mind off of things and makes me think of other scenery in my head...a lot of people say to start dating other people and meet new girls, but only do it when you are emotionally ready to give some other girl a chance, without being rebound, and without thinking she will be better or will be similar to the last have to have an open mind and realize everyone is different and you won't find a perfect match because no one is perfect, you have to get to know a girls imperfections and her inner beauty in order to realize she just might be 'perfect' for you after all...its tough I won't lie. I don't even think we'll ever forget these people, the only difference though when it comes to successfully moving on, is not wanting to be with them anymore, and being indifferent about their existence.\n\nWhat Girls Said 5\n\n  \u2022 Find another activity. Focus on yourself, go out with your buddies, go to the gym, and if your ready meet new people. I find that the best way to get over someone is by taking care of yourself, because then it gives you reassurance. You came into this world without them, you can make it without them. There's too many fish in the sea. I know this is not easy but take it step by step. You should always be OK with yourself, before making anybody happy. That includes knowing you can live without them and can move on.\n\n  \u2022 there is no way you can stop missing someone (temporarily). no matter what you do it will keep coming back. just give it time. as long as you don't see that person anymore, the feeling of missing her will just go away (I hope :) )\n\n  \u2022 i know its hard but with time things will be better as time is the only healer..\n\n  \u2022 you find someone who loves you as much as you love them. it's hard to do, I know. but it'll happen\n\n  \u2022 I find the only solution is to find someone else. At first it serves to distract you from your moping, and then if you're really getting out there and meeting peeps, lo and behold you meet someone else special and that first person doesn't seem to matter anymore.\n\nWhat Guys Said 8\n\n  \u2022 You and I are in the same boat!\n\n  \u2022 In the same position as you mate. I have that every time I think about her I go for a run, play some xbox or watch a film. Takes your mind off of it. Good Luck!\n\n  \u2022 Same problem as you bro :( you just gotta stop thinkin about her. It's hard but it's the only solution\n\n  \u2022 I have had this problem a lot recently, especially seeing as the few girls I've dated, have all come back with boyfriends over our respective breaks and we never manage to keep in touch, no matter the circumstance, so I speak from experience.The best thing is to assure yourself that things aren't always for certain and that these things happen to many other people, all over the world. It's perfectly normal to miss someone and its okay to miss them, but not forever. I give myself 3 days to figure things out and to stop missing them and move on. If they're not paying attention to me, then I shouldn't waste my time on them, when I could be living life and building better things for myself.Thing is, I don't usually meet terribly many new people that way, cause I'm still brooding,to a degree haha, but I keep myself occupied. Work and school don't let me rest often enough to allow me to focus on it too much. Instead, that way, I have more of a balance. Simply eating right also helps improve my mood and presents a whole new outlook on my life and makes me more intellectually deep :P Or at least feel like it.Hope it helps and good luck!\n\n  \u2022 Take the time to hang out with friends or get a hobby to get your mind off things. Also try seeing other people and find another girl that loves you and deserves your feelings.\n\n  \u2022 Dont make someone a priority who only see's you as an option. This includes missing them, like you say they don't miss you so why miss them ? If its a girl your missing then go out and meet new ones, never compare new girls to her though. I did this after my break up with my ex and I was never happy, I only started being happy when I took her of the pedestal and looked at new girls and what I liked about them not what was better than the ex. Another thing that helped me was philosophy, looking at the life and the bigger picture makes you realize how insignificant things like these are on the whole and it helps you put a perspective on life, helps you move on and make the most of your life. Life is short, don't linger on what you can't change, be happy, treat people well and enjoy your life. Don't hold grudges and don't look back in anger (great song for moving on as it happens) like I say life is too short !\n\n  \u2022 Learn to control your mind.\n\n  \u2022 Call of Duty : Black Ops",

        "text":"Question: Is Texting Someone Everyday Annoying?\n\nHow do you know if a girl is not interested in you through text?\n\nTotally Not InterestedThere is little to no response and also the communication isn\u2019t super enthused.She sends you a message to stop texting her .\n\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t ask questions to keep the conversation rolling.She never invites you to see her in person or with friends.She doesn\u2019t know who you are when you text her.More items\u2026\u2022.\n\nWhy did he stop texting?\n\nHe could be feeling overwhelmed from all the texting you did for weeks without a break. Ensure that the guy gets enough space to start missing you. Have some self-control and refrain from texting him. If he happens to start texting you from nowhere, do not ask him why he was silent or reply immediately.\n\nShould I stop texting her everyday?\n\nTexting her every day is a waste of your time and attention that could go to someone else, maybe even \u201cthe one.\u201d Don\u2019t have to stop being her friend. Just go out and meet new people, and text her only when necessary.\n\nDo guys like it when girls text first?\n\nTexting a Guy First Can Actually Be a Turn-On. Believe it or not, many guys really like it when girls text first. \u2026 Unless you\u2019re sending slews of unanswered messages at a time, consistently sending the first text can actually be a big turn-on for guys. It shows that you\u2019re interested and you know what you want.\n\nIs K rude in texting?\n\nAccording to the first page of Google results about \u2018texting K\u2019, society views receiving this message as akin to a one-letter insult.

But if he\u2019s texting back right away, it probably means he can\u2019t hold back. Even though he has other things on his schedule, he\u2019s taking the time to reply to you. \u2026 It also means he likes texting you, and wants to keep the conversation going.\n\nShould you stop texting a girl who never texts first?\n\nYou need to stop texting her first. She never texts first because you don\u2019t give her a chance to. And then she gets in the habit of getting texts from you all the time.\n\nHow do I stop being annoying Texter?\n\nPractice self awareness if you notice your texts are a little long, edit them, and stop yourself from annoying people with this texting tendency. Do not text someone you know multiple times everyday to ask about their life, unless you are really good friends.\n\nAre long texts annoying?\n\nSending Long Conversations Through Text Sending long texts can be annoying to the people on the receiving end, especially if they\u2019re busy at work or trying to complete a project. That being said, there are circumstances in which more in-depth conversations can be had over text.\n\nIs texting someone cheating?\n\nFor some people, it could be a case of simply texting an ex or \u201csliding into their DMs\u201d, explains dating coach Madeleine Mason. \u201cBecause people have different boundaries, someone may think flirting is fine, while for someone else it\u2019s considered emotional cheating,\u201d she told The Independent.\n\nHow do u make a girl miss u?\n\nHow to make her miss you: 13 tips to make her want you more2) Do things without her.

Ask her why and then explain to her that we all are not perfectand that before we want to replace someone, we should go talk to them first. Get all the information from her first then go to talk to you DH before she comes to him so he'll have the heads up. Then encourage her to go ask dad to connect with her more and I'm sure it will go away. I'm sure she just likes your friend because he's more attentive and playful towards her when he visits than your DH is.\n\n\n    Answer by SylviaNCali at 8:37 PM on Oct. 9, 2010\n\n  \u2022 I'd ask why, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's a case of 'he lets me do what I want' or the like.\n\n    Answer by ItsMe89 at 9:17 PM on Oct. 9, 2010\n\n  \u2022 Kids often percieve or have the fantasy of someone who is fun, takes them places, plays with them all the time as being a \"better\" parent than the one they have. I used to love my aunt like that when I was little and secretly wished she was my Mom. But kids grow out of it, at that age they don't have long attention spans. But if your DH isn't paying attention to your child at all, maybe the two of you need to have a talk about that.\n\n    Answer by SophiaofLight at 5:44 AM on Oct. 10, 2010\n\nJoin CafeMom now to contribute your answer and become part of our community.

I have been with only one man for the last two years, and he is the only man I have ever had intercourse with.\n\nI had a serious talk with him today, and he told me that before we started dating, he got tested for every STI, and they all came back negative. I'm so confused because from what I have read online, the initial outbreak usually happens within two to four weeks of contraction, but we have been together for more than two years! Did he cheat? Has this infection laid dormant in him for years? I am scared and confused. Any advice would be a great comfort to me right now. \u2014 Taken Aback Abbie\n\nTo see DearSugar's answer,\n\n\nDear Taken Aback Abbie,\n\nYou are right, the first outbreak of genital herpes usually happens within two weeks after it's contracted, so I'm a little wary of your boyfriend's honesty. It is possible for someone not to know he has the infection \u2014 sores can often be present in places where they can't easily be seen \u2014 but if he was tested two years ago and got a negative result, it's pretty obvious that he's contracted this STI since then; in other words, he most likely did cheat on you.\n\nUnfortunately, what's done is done, and I'm terribly sorry that you've been put in this situation, but now you have to decide how to proceed. Obviously you need to have another serious talk with your boyfriend, but I also suggest you get tested for other STIs and talk to you doctor about medication and treatment options for the herpes you do have.\n\nI know that you're scared right now, and I wouldn't be surprised if you start to experience feelings of betrayal and sadness too, so turn to your loved ones for support. Good luck to you.\n\n\nLatest Love",

You nedd someone who wants to grow and better their life with you and your child. He sounds like he isn't ready for the family life or responsibilities. I know it's sad and hard to be alone but and end is a new begining and I promise if you don't put up with his crap and you move on you will find someone that will love you and respect you.

I can turn to my mom, but money wasn't the only reason we moved in. Mom had a stroke, her spine is deteriorating (I know the sp is wrong, sorry), she had Fibro Mialgia, and Sleep Apnea. We did move in to save money, but also to take care of her. She is FABULOUS!!! I can turn to her for support, but I have to be very careful about the amount of stress I put on her.\n\n    Answer by Anonymous at 11:47 PM on Jun. 27, 2009\n\n  \u2022 You are living with your mom, obviously she is willing to help you out. Forget about the SO, he isn't ready to be a grown up. Worry about your self and your child. Help your mom out, even if it means getting a job. You can even go to the public assistance office and see if you can be paid to take care of your mother. I believe it is called Kinship. It sounds like your mother could use the extra help.\n\n    Answer by tyfry7496 at 11:55 PM on Jun. 27, 2009\n\n  \u2022 First off you need to get a job.\n\n    Answer by Chrissy629 at 9:42 AM on Jun. 28, 2009\n\nJoin CafeMom now to contribute your answer and become part of our community.

Now the child is afraid to go to sleep at night, and the parent doesn\u2019t know what to do. What do you think she can do?\n\nMOM: Well, I would handle it somewhat differently. While I understand that she was trying to appeal to the more \u201cgrown up\u201d side of the child, actually I think in this instance it wasn\u2019t helpful. I think it would have been more helpful to lie down with the child for a few minutes and reassure him.\u00a0 That way he gets to feel comforted. At three, he\u2019s scared of the violence of the storm. As an adult, just to hold his hand and lie down with him for a few moments will help him recalibrate internally and settle his anxiety down. Then he knows that somebody is there for him; there\u2019s somebody between him and the storm, so to speak. This is a big part of giving reassurance to a child.\n\nMOLLY: That he knows that you\u2019re there for him?\n\nMOM: Right, and that he\u2019s protected. That he doesn\u2019t have to face this violent storm alone \u2013I\u2019ll use that as a metaphor, too.\n\nMOLLY: From not doing that, not giving him reassurance in the storm, what do you think happened? Why is the child now having trouble sleeping even when there is not a thunderstorm?\n\nMOM: I think it caused him some anxiety which is translating into scared to sleep at night. This is obviously a change of behavior for the child and the fearful incident has become generalized to other situations.\n\nMOLLY: What can the Mom do now? How can she fix it?\n\nMOM: Once she recognizes that that might not have been the best way to handle it, she can address it directly with the child. If she doesn\u2019t address it with him, the anxiety can take on a life of its own and can become a very long term problem that, after a while, no one remembers where it came from. In therapy, we talk about this type of anxiety as developing a life of its own, and then it becomes much more difficult to address.\n\nFor this mom, she might say something during the daytime and not necessarily at night. She want\u2019s to engage him when he\u2019s fully functioning emotionally and not tired or hungry or about to go to bed.\n\nShe might say, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking about what happened the other night. Do you remember what happened during that terrible storm that we had? It was raining really loudly and there was a lot of thunder and lightening. You asked me to lie down with you and I said, oh be a big boy, you can manage this. Do you remember that? You know, I\u2019ve thought about it and that wasn\u2019t very nice of me not to stay with you for a bit while you were scared.\u201d\n\nThen she can say, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I didn\u2019t stay with you during the thunderstorm, but the next time something scary happens, you let me know and I promise I\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard to do, and the child then feels understood.\n\nMOLLY: And that will solve the problem?\n\nMOM: Usually, but the kid will most likely test her out. Something will come up soon, it\u2019s almost guaranteed. He\u2019ll want to know that Mom\u2019s response is for real.\n\nMOLLY: She\u2019ll have to make sure she follows through.\n\nMOM: Yes, as a parent you have to make sure you do something if you say you will. If you don\u2019t do it after saying that you will do it, there will be problems.\n\nMOLLY: Then he might have trouble trusting you? It\u2019s hard to go back to a place of trust at that point.\n\nMOM: The development of trust is so important, but you can go back. You can go back and \u201cclean it up\u201d so to speak.\n\nMOLLY: So as a parent, you might make these mistakes, but you can go back and change things in your relationship with your child?\n\nMOM: Right. The closer to the time of the actual event, the better. The rule of thumb is: if you can respond to the child\u2019s need, then that allows him to move on from there. An unresolved need can result in a child getting stuck in that stage of development.\n\nComment below if you\u2019ve had success using other strategies to help your child deal with their fears at bedtime. Or Contact Us if you have a parenting question you\u2019d like to see addressed.\n\nding 3 comments on \u201cHelp! My Child is Afraid to Go to Sleep at Night\n\n  1. We\u2019ve had similar issues with storms, shadows, etc, and have always let the kids crawl into bed with us. At first I was worried about developing bad habits but as it turned out, they just wanted comfort in those moments and didn\u2019t turn it into a nightly event. As a parent, you learn to weed out the times when they are actually in need vs. times when they just don\u2019t want to go to bed. We always try to err on the side of caution but a child\u2019s tummy can only hurt so many nights in a row before you realize they just want to watch hockey with Daddy ;D\n\n  2. I giggled out loud when I read about your comment about \u201cwanting to watch hockey with Daddy\u201d. We\u2019ve had that same dilemma\u2026what\u2019s real and what\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d so I can avoid going to bed. I guess once it starts becoming a habit than you have your answer and have to do figure out what to do about it!\n\n  3. It was nice to read such a sharing and contributing conversation between a mother and child, and not merely good advice for parents but great example of how parents and children can relate as they grow older. Thanks!\n    I have one comment to add, and that is our young children are \u201creading\u201d our parental concerns and non-concerns all the time. Just being with a child who is afraid, and letting them experience you as you are experiencing a thunder storm (or a stranger, a new environment, etc.) gives them a way to tell whether something is safe or not and how to relate to it. Talking about a thunderstorm as \u201cscary\u201d probably is not as valuable as being physically close and talking together about having been scared or being scared during a thunderstorm. I think it\u2019s good for our children to \u201csee\u201d how to deal with things when they are afraid, and they can learn empowering ways to do that from us at many levels. No teaching required, just honest sharing and comforting.\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"GIrls, do you always feel like you settled when you're dating someone?\n\nIt seems like girls usually feel like they're above guys in the social hierarchy, like they're the prizes and guys are the paupers hoping to win them. It seems like my female friends believe that most guys aren't up to their standards. That, and every guy who dates one of them or one of their friends is \"lucky\" to be with her. This gives the impression that girls believe they usually settle for a guy in dating. Is this how y'all really feel?\n\n\nMost Helpful Girl\n\n  \u2022 Your \"friends\" sound weird.\n\n    I'd never date someone I'm not 100% happy with. Otherwise I'm wasting my time.\n\n    \u2022 As far as my friends being weird, I think it's a pretty common sentiment among girls.\n\n    \u2022 Show All\n    \u2022 Same can be said about guys. I see them also focusing on the same hot girls all the time.\n\n    \u2022 Some do, but guys tend to be more realistic because we know that if we hold out for supermodels, we'll never get sex! More than that, a lot of guys get to college never really having had gfs, so we're eager to finally jump in and experience relationships with girls for the first time. Girls seems a lot less eager to be in relationships. They want to be in relationships, mind you, but only if it's with a guy who meets all criteria on their lists.\n\nHave an opinion?\n\n\nSend It!\n\nWhat Girls Said 1\n\n  \u2022 Your friend doesn't sound very nice, i've only dated guys that i've truly loved, i don't settle for anyone.\n\n\nWhat Guys Said 1\n\n  \u2022 A lot of girls do settle for guys. What happens is they'll spend their twenties having more pricks than a second hand dart board, when they enter their thirties and everything starts sagging, their looks start to fade and they struggle to compete with younger women in their early twenties then they settle down with those Steady Eddie's who offer them a financial safety net to cling on to. I mean what's a woman without the latest fashion accessory from Prada?",

We had a good relationship and I love her a lot. She wanted to marry me and gave me an ultimatum that if I didn\u2019t marry her she was going to the west coast to work for her family. I told her that I loved her but the marriage thing scares me. She has been out there for six months now. I want her back so bad now and told her about a month ago that I want to marry her, but she says that the things she wanted in life have changed and she needs to further her self in life. I told her I made a huge mistake and I will do anything. I have a good job and have been with the same company for 20 years but I don\u2019t know if living out west has made her see bigger and better things. I am not a cheater. I work hard but was just scared to get married again after a failed marriage seven years ago. I have never felt this way before about a woman. I told her how I feel about her and even called her mother. Do I now give her, her space? We use to talk almost every day. I don\u2019t know what I should do. She tells me I\u2019m too late. She struggled here with jobs and maybe I should have helped her with that more. She said to me that everyone thought she would fail out there but she is still there. What can I do? It\u2019s hard not to cry when I talk to her. She said she doesn\u2019t need to start a relationship. I have never seen her act this way before and be so cold.\n\n  \u2022 It sounds like your ex-girlfriend is focusing on getting herself together and doesn\u2019t want to rush back into a relationship with you based on the POSSIBILITY that you are ready now.\u00a0 You said that it was hard for her to find good work back at home and that nobody thought she would make it out west.\u00a0 Now she has found good work and is making it on her own, you want to come back into the picture. Even though she has moved on with her life, you want her to move back home to be with you because you are NOW ready to get married.\u00a0 That\u2019s a hard decision for her to make.\u00a0 There is nothing wrong with being hesitant to remarry after a failed marriage, but from her perspective, you weren\u2019t ready and since nothing great was keeping her at home, she moved away and started a new life.\u00a0 Now that she is happy and successful where she is, you are asking her to give all of that up on the CHANCE that you are now ready to marry her.\u00a0 You want her to give up her new life and career and she is thinking that you should have said all of this before she left town.\u00a0 If she was struggling living at home before, she may fear that she will struggle again if she moves back.\n\n    If you are serious about her being \u201cthe one,\u201d maybe you should consider moving out west and joining her.\u00a0 Can you get a transfer at your job?\u00a0 Interested in making a change after all these years?\u00a0 In your mind it makes the most sense for you to stay at your job because you\u2019ve been there for so long and for her to come home because that is where you both started.\u00a0 But in her mind she may feel that if you want her: 1)you have to prove it; 2) you have to win back her trust and confidence in you and your relationship; and 3) you have to accept her desire to have her own life, goals and aspirations.\u00a0 You keep asking her to get on YOUR program: to get married when YOU want and to move to where YOU live.\u00a0 There are no guarantees, but if you want to show her that you are really serious, you may have to make some moves toward getting on HER program.\u00a0 And I have to be real with you, six months away from you coupled with the fact that she doesn\u2019t act too excited about you anymore could mean that she isn\u2019t just upset about what happened, it could mean that she is in fact over you.\u00a0 So you have a big risk to take, figuring out how far to go to try to win her back, realizing that she may already be gone and no sacrifice, no matter how big, will change her mind.\n\n    Give it some more time.\u00a0 She needs time to see that you are serious and that this isn\u2019t just a good mood you are in right now.\u00a0 And you need time to see if she is interesting in getting back together with you, before you go and do something drastic to prove your love to her.\n\n    I wish you all the best!\n\n    Dr. Michelle\n\nMy friend has stopped being there for me, what should I do?\n\n  \u2022 I need some advice. I have a friend who when I need someone to talk to seems as if she\u2019s never there. While talking to her on the phone she either talks to others in the background, doesn\u2019t respond back, or says \u201cWhat did you say again?\u201d I am very hurt by this because recently when I called her to talk, I was very upset about a dying family member and she did the same things. But meanwhile, when she\u2019s having man problems she calls me day or night and I give her my undivided attention. What should I do?\n\n  \u2022 I know that it can be difficult confronting someone, but there is only one way around this situation and that is for you to tell your \u201cfriend\u201d how her behavior makes you feel.\u00a0 You don\u2019t want to attack her or jump down her throat\u2013just wait for a calm moment when you can peacefully, yet honestly, tell her how it makes you feel when she doesn\u2019t give you her full attention when the two of you are talking.\u00a0 The example of needing her attention when you were trying to discuss your feelings about your dying family member is a perfect example to bring up.\u00a0 It\u2019s okay to tell her that you value her friendship enough to pay close attention when she is talking to you and that you need her to pay attention to you when you need help as well.\n\n    Although we both know how rude she has acted, if this is the first time you have mentioned your feelings to her, you have to understand that she may not have realized how rude she\u2019s been acting, so give her a chance to make some changes.\u00a0 If she does it again in the future, remind her right then and there that she is doing it again.\u00a0 If she doesn\u2019t stop, then you need to find someone else to talk to and depend on. What\u2019s the point of talking to her if she isn\u2019t listening anyway?\u00a0 That is enough to make your mood go from bad to worse and it\u2019s a sign that you need to find another friend to confide in and share your feelings with.\u00a0 Maybe when she notices that you, the person who always gave her your undivided attention, are now becoming friends with someone who cares about listening to your life, she might wake up and smell the coffee.\n\n    Good luck!\n\n    Dr. Michelle\n\nHow can I convince my girlfriend not to marry her Ex?\n\n  \u2022 I\u2019ve been dating this girl for the past year and a half, on and off, but I\u2019ve known her almost 3 years now. When we first met, I was married and she was involved with her long time boyfriend. We fell for each other and became madly in love. She promised me she was going to leave him, and she did. She has very strict parents. In the last couple months she decides to get back with her boyfriend. There is no love there. She tells me she has feelings for two guys, and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. I still see her to this day but her boyfriend doesn\u2019t know. She told me the other day that they are getting married this year. I can\u2019t let her do this\u2013she is making a big mistake. She even told me the other day that her boyfriend doesn\u2019t do half the things I do for her. I don\u2019t get it. All I did was make her happy, and she says I did nothing wrong and that it\u2019s her. I know her family really likes him and they haven\u2019t really met me. Is this a family issue? She wants to be with me. How can I convince her to come back to me? I want to be with her! I really love her!!!! Please help me\u2026\n\n  \u2022 I wish I could tell you that this is just a \u201cfamily\u201d issue but I don\u2019t think that it is.\u00a0 Even if her parents are strict and seem to like the other guy, you already said that they haven\u2019t really met you yet, so I\u2019m not convinced that they are against you. I put this squarely on your ex\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0 She is clearly giving you mixed messages.\u00a0 First, she tells you that she has feelings for both of you, but then she said that there is no love there.\u00a0 Well, which one is it?\u00a0 It sounds like you are fighting against her feelings for her ex who she has been dating for almost a whole decade\u2014that\u2019s a long time and clearly she doesn\u2019t have him out of her system yet.\n\n    It can\u2019t be entirely her family\u2019s fault because if she left him in the first place, she could have stayed broken up with him and just moved on with you.\u00a0 But she made the choice to go ba...

In healthy relationships, people don\u2019t want their partners to be excessively dependent; they encourage their partner\u2019s autonomy.\n\nHow can you tell you\u2019re being used?\n\n\u201cThe basic yardstick for telling whether you are being used or not is to take a good look at how you are being treated,\u201d Aimee says. \u201c\u2026if you find that they are disrespectful, don\u2019t treat you well, and you don\u2019t feel good with the person then chances are you might be being used.\u201d",
