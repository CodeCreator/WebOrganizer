        "text":"\nHow can we help?\n\n\n    Columbus Workers\u2019 Compensation Lawyer\n\n    Many workplaces require their employees to perform dangerous activities. But even in fairly mundane workplaces, there is a potential for people to get injured on the job. Whether an injury happens on a factory floor, in an office building, or on the road, if a person is injured while performing their work duties, they have the right to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\n\n    Oftentimes, an insurance company may deny payment, or issue payment that is insufficient for the injuries suffered. In these situations, a worker has the right to appeal the decision to the State Board of Workers\u2019 Compensation with the help of a skilled personal injury attorney. Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyers represent individuals in these hearings to argue for the fair benefits that they deserve for their injuries.\n\n    Defining the Employee Insurance Program\n\n    Workers\u2019 compensation is an insurance program that all employers with more than three employees are required to procure. This program protects both employees, by providing payments in the event of injury, and employers, since people hurt on the job cannot sue their employers for damages.\n\n    The program pays any worker who was hurt on the job for almost any reason. The only exceptions include if the worker was fighting, was drunk, or on drugs at the time of the incident. Short of these situations, all injuries are eligible for the program.\n\n    Workers\u2019 Compensation Process\n\n    The first thing a\u00a0Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyer is seeking is emergency treatment. Safety is the most important thing. After this, the injured worker has 30 days to report the injury to their supervisor. This will allow the employer to investigate the claim and to refer the worker to a list of approved doctors for treatment. All employers are required to list no fewer than six doctors that can be visited for treatment.\n\n    This doctor will be responsible to both return the worker to health and provide an opinion as to that employee\u2019s ability to return to work. Taking this opinion, the insurance provider will issue payments. If the worker accepts the insurance company\u2019s findings, the case is over and payments will be issued. It is when the payments are insufficient, or denied entirely, that the process becomes more complicated.\n\n    What are the Potential Benefits?\n\n    The types of benefits that may be issued change with the severity of the injury. All medical costs associated with treating the injury will be paid by the insurance company as long as the worker visits the approved doctors. In order for any cash benefits to be paid, a person must miss more than seven days of work.\n\n    This payment will only be issued if a person misses more than 21 consecutive days of work. This is paid at a rate of two-thirds of the average weekly wage. These are known as Temporary Total Disability benefits. Other potential benefits include temporary partial disability, permanent partial disability, and death benefits. Temporary partial disability is issued when a person returns to work but at a limited capacity. Benefits are paid at two-thirds of the difference between prior wages and current wages.\n\n    Permanent partial disability is a lump sum benefits paid because of a permanent reduction in workability. Death benefits are for cases where the worker dies as a result of the accident, all payments are issued to their surviving family. This is paid at two-thirds the average weekly wage. Additionally, funeral expenses are also compensated.\n\n    Compensation Denial Cases\n\n    Most workers\u2019 compensation claims are accepted by all people involved and payments are issued. However, an employee always has the right to appeal the insurance company\u2019s findings with the help of a Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyer. The State of Georgia maintains the State Board of Workers\u2019 Compensation that hears all appeals of benefits.\n\n    In order to initiate this appeal, a worker must file the necessary paperwork within one year of the accident. At these hearings, the Board will hear the case from both the employee\u2019s and insurance company\u2019s perspective. In addition, all workers have the right to be represented by an attorney at these hearings, but in no situation, will one be provided for them.\n\n    Assistance From Columbus Workers\u2019 Compensation Attorneys\n\n    Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyers represent workers in these hearings to argue their cases and fight for the full compensation warranted by their injuries. If you have been injured on the job and denied workers\u2019 compensation benefits or the benefits offered are too low for the severity of the injury, contact today for help.",

Being charged with a crime is a stressful experience, and the consequences of a criminal record can be life-changing. Therefore, it is critical that you seek legal guidance from an established Huntington Beach criminal defense attorney with a track record of successful case outcomes defending cases comparable to yours. Both managing partners at Takakjian & Sitkoff, LLP are top rated criminal defense lawyers in Orange County who are recognized by Super Lawyers, Martindale-Hubbell, and the Criminal Law Section of the California Board of Legal Specialization. If you have been arrested for a crime or a DUI charge in Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, Westminster, Garden Grove, or Fountain Valley, call our OC criminal defense firm today at (714) 200-1446 for a FREE CONSULTATION to learn how we can best defend you.\n\nOver 3 Decades Of Experience Protecting Clients Against Misdemeanor And Felony Charges\n\nSince 1987, we have achieved great success defending virtually every possible felony and misdemeanor criminal charge. A staunch legal defense must be established early on in your case. Therefore, an experienced criminal attorney with the knowledge base to anticipate police and prosecutors\u2019 tactics before they are even acted upon can serve as a crucial factor into improving your chances of receiving reduced sentencing or avoiding a criminal conviction entirely. HB criminal lawyers Paul Takakjian and Stephen Sitkoff have prevailed on numerous occasions in Westminster Court on the criminal cases involving the following California criminal charges:\n\nDUI \u2013 Also referred to as \u201cdrunk driving,\u201d any driver who operates a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol level above 0.08 can be arrested for a misdemeanor DUI under CA Vehicle Code 23152(b). Also, to mandatory court-imposed punishments, a DUI conviction can also result in a driver\u2019s license suspension levied by the DMV.\n\nDrug Crimes \u2013 To reduce overcrowded prison and jail populations, the decriminalization measure, Prop. 47 was passed into law in 2014. The biggest effect was the modification of drug possession crimes involving certain controlled substances such as Cocaine, Heroin, or Concentrated Cannabis being reclassified from felony drug charges to misdemeanor drug charges. Possession of a controlled substance, otherwise known as \u201csimple possession,\u201d are misdemeanor drug crimes which can be dismissed through drug diversion programs if you qualify.\n\nTheft Crimes \u2013 Property crimes involving theft can range in degree seriousness depending on the amount of the theft, your prior criminal history, and the sophistication of the theft act. Although a first offense misdemeanor petty theft or shoplifting charge in Huntington Beach will rarely result in jail time, more serious felony theft crimes in HB such as embezzlement, burglary, and grand theft auto can result in jail or prison even as a 1st offense if prosecutors allege aggravating circumstances. Theft related offenses are prosecuted aggressively in Orange County, and the West Justice Center is no different. Punishments can include jail time, probation, substantial fines and penalty assessments, and community labor. However, the most devastating consequence is the impact a theft or shoplifting criminal record can have on your career and if applicable, citizenship.\n\nSex Crimes \u2013 Among the most harshly punished crimes in Huntington Beach, felony sex offenses carry the permanent penalty of lifetime sex offender registration. Sex crime defense is one of the most complex areas of legal practice, and the consequence of ineffective legal representation can permanently ruin your life. If you find yourself accused of sexual assault, rape, child molestation, indecent exposure, or possession of child porn, it is imperative that you are represented by an Orange County sex crime defense expert.\n\nViolent Crimes \u2013 Criminal charges involving allegations of battery, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and domestic violence are a few examples of crimes of violence. In addition, a violent crime does not require an injury or even physical contact, as assault, criminal threats, and stalking is categorized as crimes involving violence. Violent crime penalties can include jail, anger management counseling, probation, restraining orders, and fines.\n\nTake The First Step Toward A Positive Case Outcome And Call Our Huntington Beach Criminal Defense Lawyers Today\n\nOur experience and reputation in complex criminal defense litigation in Huntington Beach are unparalleled.

Losing a loved one is never easy and the pain from this type of emotional and financial suffering can take never be erased.\n\nHowever, with the help of a passionate attorney, you may be able to obtain justice for your loved one and the financial compensation your family needs to survive. Nothing can replace your lost loved one, but there are ways an Albany wrongful death lawyer to hold the person responsible for his death accountable legally and financially.\n\nEstablishing a Wrongful Death Case\n\nAn Albany wrongful death lawyer will need to be able to prove certain elements are present to have a successful claim. Under most circumstances, the following elements must be present in a wrongful death case:\n\n  \u2022 A person died\n  \u2022 The death of the person in question was caused by the negligence or malice of another person\n  \u2022 Surviving family members are suffering financially because of the death of their loved one\n  \u2022 The person filing the wrongful death suit is a representative of the deceased person\u2019s estate\n\nSurviving family members may be able to file a suit if their loved one is killed in some type of accident or by criminal behavior. They may also be able to file suit if their loved one died due to a healthcare professional\u2019s negligence.\n\nRecovering Financial Damages in Albany\n\nDuring a wrongful death suit, surviving family members will attempt to recover damages for pecuniary injuries. These injuries cause the survivors to suffer financially due to the loss of income resulting from the death of their loved one. They may also be able to obtain damages for funeral expenses, medical bills and loss of personal support.\n\nWhen calculating pecuniary loss, most courts will take the earning potential, age, and physical health of the deceased individual into consideration. Consult with an Albany wrongful death lawyer for help in recovering financial damages.\n\nStatute of Limitations\n\nMost states, including Georgia, give representatives a limited amount of time to file their wrongful death suit and if they fail to file within the legal timeframe, the court may refrain from hearing the case altogether.\n\nGeorgia law gives surviving family members a total of two years to file suit starting from the date of the death of their loved one. Surviving family members and estate representatives should work closely with their lawyers to file suit in a timely manner.\n\nLet an Albany Wrongful Death Attorney Help\n\nDuring a time of mourning, the idea of filing a lawsuit and going to court may sound overwhelming. This is understandable, and the immense pain of losing your loved one can make everything in life more difficult. However, by working with the right devoted attorneys, you can seek justice for your loved one and recover the financial damages your family needs to survive.

        "text":"C-9788 Without Rule of Law: Advanced Skills to Help You Survive\n\n\nWARNING: This book contains material that may be offensive to some readers. It is an instructional guide covering tactical actions and capabilities which should only be executed in last-resort survival situations.\nThis book was written for non-military readers who believe in self-reliance and wish to develop advanced, just-in-case capabilities for themselves and their families. It leads the reader through progressively more complex preparations and activities.\nWritten by Joe Nobody, author of the bestselling HOLDING YOUR GROUND series of books, this work addresses skills that may be necessary to survive if a breakdown of society or government should occur.\nThe work covers topics such as camouflage, breaching, hiding, stalking, looting, scavenging, infiltration and disguise. The book includes numerous examples, special equipment, exercises and instructional text on how to plan, equip and execute these actions in a potentially hostile, post-SHTF environment. It takes the reader through various scenarios and provides guidance should TEOTWAWKI occur and extreme measures are required to survive.\n\nFrom the Author:\nI didn't want to write this book. It goes against my grain. I am a positive, optimistic person, and the subject matter of this work is dark and foreboding.\n\nIt speaks of a time when my meticulous preparations fail, and I have to resort to the very behavior that I have campaigned to eradicate. It advocates and teaches skills and actions that I despise in others. Yet, the very creed of self-reliance is preparing---for whatever may happen. Are we so confident that the proverbial S will HTF only one time? Where is it written that society will immediately bounce back, returning civilization quickly to its pre-SHTF state? Is there no such thing as TEOTWAWKI II? What happens when my preparations are not enough?\n\nOur forefathers possessed skills that we respect, in which they lived valuable lives without the advantages of electricity and other modern conveniences. Despite all of their self-reliance, skills, and knowledge, disaster still struck. Drought, Indian raids, war, and even weather that destroyed crops endangered their lives. They often struggled to survive, despite all of their preparations. In a post-SHTF society, there will likely be no resources for an already starving population if disaster strikes - again.\n\nWithout Rule of Law assumes that such a time arrives when anarchy is pervasive, and the remnants of humanity are struggling to re-establish civilization. Governmental resources are thin or nonexistent. Do you have a plan for this contingency? What additional skills or means would you need on hand to prepare for this? I hope this work helps in your preparations and generates a thought process allowing you to address this threat.\n\nPaperback: 190 pages\nLanguage: English\nProduct Dimensions: 10 x 8 x 0.4 inches\nShipping Weight: 1 pounds\nSKU: C-9788\n\nThe Author:\nJoe Nobody (pen name for the author who wishes to keep his identity confidential) has provided systems, consulting and training for the U.S. Army, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Naval Research, United States Border Patrol as well as several private firms and government agencies which cannot be disclosed.\n\nHe is currently active in this area and for the security of his family and ongoing business, wishes to remain anonymous.\n\nHe has over 30 years of competitive shooting experience, including IPSC, NRA, and other related organizations. He has been a firearms instructor and consultant for over 30 years and holds the rights to a United States Patent for a firearms modification.\n\nJoe initially became involved in helping private citizens \"prepare\" at the request of his students and clients. A conscientious instructor, he would always inquire as to why they wanted to learn certain skills or techniques and often the response was to prepare for more than just simple home invasion or self-defense. If you ask Joe what his greatest attribute is, he will tell you he is a \"problem solver\" and uses his formal education in Systems Engineering to this end.\n\n\"As the economy worsens, world tensions rise, and the modern media propagates bad news faster than ever before, more and more people want to prepare. I wrote HOLDING because it allows me to reach more of the good folks who are concerned about their security. I want them to sleep better at night knowing they have a plan of defense should the 'Event' ever occur.\"",

        "text":"Small-Town Attention to Big-City Problems\n\nContractors Beware \u2013 Minnesota\u2019s Contractor Theft Law Carries Stiff Penalties\n\nContractors who don\u2019t use payments received from customers on real property construction projects, resulting in subcontractors not being paid, expose themselves to criminal and civil liability under Minnesota\u2019s contractor theft statute (\u00a7 514.02, Minn. Stat.). Those who violate the statute can face criminal prosecution for theft of proceeds pursuant to section 609.52, Minn. Stat. Not only can violation of the statute result in a monetary penalty, but it can also result in imprisonment, though this more extreme enforcement option is rarely implemented by county prosecutors.\n\nThe teeth behind the civil component of the statute, which is more commonly pursued than the criminal option, is two-fold. First, it allows owners to go after individual shareholders, officers, directors, and agents of the company who knowingly received the proceeds that should have gone to subcontractors, and received those proceeds as salary, dividends, loan repayments, capital contributions, or otherwise. Second, the statute allows for attorney fee recovery should the owner prevail at trial, which is a really big deal because attorney fees are otherwise not recoverable to a prevailing party in Minnesota absent a specific statute or contractual provision that provides for recovery.\n\nFrom a contractor\u2019s perspective, this highlights the importance of only using client funds for costs associated with that client\u2019s project. Although the statute doesn\u2019t require contractors to segregate funds received from clients in separate accounts given the impracticability of this requirement, contractors should maintain solid bookkeeping to ensure that client funds are appropriately earmarked for expenses related to that project.\n\nOwners, to minimize the risk of contractor fund mismanagement, should to the extent possible, insist that the written construction contract include a provision that the contractor provides, upon request, an updated summary of who the contractor has paid and in what amounts, to make certain that payments are going where they should and are tracking with the actual work performed as of the payment date. Owners also have the right under Minnesota law to condition the tender of payments on subcontractor written lien waivers, which reduces the risk of subcontractors going unpaid and filing mechanic\u2019s liens against the property. Nothing can sour a project more from an owner\u2019s perspective than having to pay twice for the same work.\n\nIt is critical that contractors and owners have a working knowledge of this important statute, especially contractors, as ignorance of the statute\u2019s requirements can have dire consequences.\n\nSchedule A Free Consultation Today\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a qualified and trusted Minneapolis\/St. Paul attorney, please call Mr. Kelsch at 763-398-1676 or send him an email.\n\nThis website features educational information based on general legal principles in Minnesota. \u00a0Specific legal advice is contingent upon the unique facts of each case. \u00a0Therefore, you should not rely only on this information for your particular legal issue. \u00a0Contact an attorney to obtain advice specific to your legal situation.",

The property owners, managers and maintenance people must ensure the safety of people as they move throughout their property. Houses and buildings must be free of broken stairs, stairways, and steps, and those responsible for the premises, must make sure that they are free of defects that could cause someone to slip\/trip and fall, or otherwise get injured, including making sure stairways, steps, and adjoining building and street areas are not cracked, broken, or in some way, defective. Places with stairways, where pedestrians are invited to walk, no matter what type of area it is, whether it be a stairway in a shopping mall, a parking garage, office building, private home, and all other areas where invited pedestrians utilize stairs, must be free from slippery and\/or wet substances which must be immediately adequately marked and cleaned. Included in these areas to be maintained by the establishment\u2019s owners and managers, are the stairs and stairways, which must remain free of clutter, and stairways must be well-lit, secure, and properly maintained.\n\nWhen any pedestrian stairway\/staircase on a property is not properly built or it is not maintained in a safe condition, the property owner is responsible for the injuries sustained by anyone who slip\/trips and falls or otherwise gets injured and sustain a serious personal injury, whatever the cause, such as missing, improperly laid, or damaged carpet. Each personal injury lawyer at Birzon and Associates, is an expert in stairway accident liability law, and they will gather your accident and injury information to investigate your personal injury claim, and then build and support those claims on your behalf or on behalf of a loved one \u2014 whether the accident occurred, while you were walking on public, private, commercial or government owned and operated property.\n\nOur law firm has represented pedestrians in all types of accidents, including accidents that may in some way be connected to a construction site \u2013 or that happened, while you were a walking in an airport, public transit center, bus stop, or train\/subway station. Pedestrian accidents are often the result of slipping and falling on icy steps or on a wet or greasy spot or area on a store staircase. Common types of stairs and step related injuries often occur when a person who is lawfully climbing a stairs at a premises, is caused to trip over uneven steps built at improper heights, damaged carpets, and\/or damaged flooring and steps.\n\nIt is well known that Stairway\/stair fall accidents are one of the most common causes of serious injury among the elderly who, often, with their fragile bones, break their hips and sustain other serious injuries, often requiring surgery. If you or a loved one has been seriously injured due to stairway related accident, due to the negligence of the property owners and managers, in not meeting their legal obligations to ensure your safety while a pedestrian at their premises, by failing to properly design, maintain and\/or repair any building or other property defects that could cause hazards to those walking around the premises using the stairs. In stairway and step accident cases, those in charge of the premises, could be liable for your damages, if they knew of the negligent condition(s), or by exercising due diligence, they should have known that a dangerous condition and\/or defect existed, and that their failure to properly repair it in a timely manner, make they liable for your injuries that you sustained as a result of your stairway fall or other injury.
