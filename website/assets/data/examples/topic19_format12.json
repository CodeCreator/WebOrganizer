Founded by the University of Leuven (K.U. Leuven), supported by European Commission FP7 and leading a unique PAN European Private partnership that interacts with Public Institutions, LSEC connects security industry experts, research institutes and universities, government agencies, end users, funding bodies and technical experts who are driving national and European research agendas. LSEC activities aim to raise cyber security awareness, support innovation and competitiveness of the European IT- Security market and promote the visibility of its members.\n\n%AM, %05 %041 %2014 %00:%Jun\n\nLSEC, the European ICT Security Cluster\n\nLSEC is the European ICT Security Cluster. Started in 2012 in Belgium, the cluster is now active in different countries in Europe supporting its members and the development of the cyber security and network and information security market in Europe and beyond.\u00a0\n\nIn July 2014, the lsec.be website was transformed into a new platform and this migration resulted in a future grade information security knowledge system, and a networking hub.\u00a0\nSome information which was published on the previous platforrm is still under the process of being tranformed, while latest and newest items are being added on a daily basis.\n\nLSEC is a cluster bringing together SME's, large companies, knowledge institutions, entrepeneurs and security professionals in a community.\u00a0\n\nWe are a cluster to support the direct link between internationalisation and increased\u00a0performance of SMEs. International activities reinforce growth, enhance competitiveness\u00a0and support the long-term sustainability of companies. SMEs need to find the right\u00a0partners to develop and produce globally competitive products and services. This calls\u00a0for new forms of international cooperation that are often difficult for individual SMEs to\u00a0manage on their own.\n\nClusters can act as real \"springboards\" for SMEs to help them getting access to global\u00a0value chains and develop long-term strategic partnerships. SMEs benefit from specialised\u00a0\nbusiness support services of cluster organisations, such as through the organisation of\u00a0international study visits, partnering or \u201cmatchmaking\u201d missions that facilitate finding\u00a0\nnew partners outside their own region for research and prototyping as well as for\u00a0bringing products and services to the market.\n\nCluster organisations can help\u00a0enterprises, and in particular SMEs, to find international cooperation partners, raise their\u00a0excellence, innovation capacity and their overall competitiveness.\n\nThe LSEC cluster has activities supporting these developments, and a series of reference cases with its members.\u00a0\n\nGet in touch and join the cluster as an individual member, a corporate member or a core ict security member.\n\n\nLast modified on %AM, %26 %379 %2015 %08:%Mar\nMore in this category: Cloud Security & SaaSification \u00bb\n\nRelated Expertises\n\nRelated Experts\n\nRelated Documents\n\n\n  \u2022 2017-01-19_11-12-42.png\n  \u2022 ACDCLogo_v4_Verde_150x79.png\n  \u2022 agoria.png\n  \u2022 APWGEU.png\n  \u2022 arc_logo.png\n  \u2022 b-hive.png\n  \u2022 beltug.jpg\n  \u2022 bronzecluster.jpg\n  \u2022 centrodecyberseguridad.png\n  \u2022 computable-logo-be-small.png\n  \u2022 csc.png\n  \u2022 dgconnect.jpg\n  \u2022 dspvalley.jpg\n  \u2022 fisc.png\n  \u2022 heliview.png\n  \u2022 infosecurity_belgium.png\n  \u2022 isaca.png\n  \u2022 jaarbeurs.png\n  \u2022 logo-ecso.gif\n  \u2022 nsmc.png\n  \u2022 polescs.jpg\n  \u2022 sirris.png\n  \u2022 stopthinkconnect.png\n  \u2022 teletrust-logo.gif\n  \u2022 UKCSFlogo.png\n  \u2022 VLAIO.png\n  \u2022 voka.png\n\nLSEC for Security Professionals\n\n\nLSEC for Security Companies\n\n\nLSEC for enterprise & government\n\n\nLSEC for academia & research institutes\n\n\nRequest information about LSEC Membership\n\nClick here\n\nSign up for our newsletter\n\nClick here\n\nLearn more about current projects & industry collaborations\n\nClick here\n\nContact us\n\nClick here\n\n\nPrivacy | Disclaimer | Responsible Disclosure Copyright\u00a0LSEC - Leaders In Security 2002 - 2017 - Kasteelpark 10, 3001 Heverlee - Leuven | tel. +",

The Internet has brought vulnerability to consumers through their use of computers, and to nations through the automation of their infrastructures. Attacks are launched from around the world and there is pessimism among experts that these attacks can be blocked. Today, citizens across the United States are inundated with junk mail and many are being robbed by invisible hands. As networked computing becomes deeply embedded in national infrastructures and critical services, so the risk of national disaster becomes an inescapable concern.\n\nMuch of the present problem stems from insecure host software, or from computer users who do not have adequate training to operate their computers securely. This has led some people to blame the users rather than the network. However, a country cannot expect its citizens to deploy consumer products with military grade security. Nor can it expect consumer products to be manufactured with military standards. A more reasonable solution begins with a network which diminishes the risk to its users by itself being robust. Follow that with a service delivery method that can easily be deployed by ordinary citizens.",

Although funding of the Programme has finished, its Directors; Professor Jim Hall, Professor Myles Allen, Professor Kathy Willis and Professor Steve Rayner remain actively involved with the School within other active research programmes.\n\nWhat are we doing?\u00a0\nWe are working across the sciences, social sciences and humanities to radically rethink global resource stewardship. We aim to deliver a framework, accountable to future generations, that will create actionable input on critical global issues such as freshwater resources, land-use and atmosphere.\n\nWhy is it important?\nFreshwater, land, atmosphere and biodiversity are universally vital resources subject to both cumulative and systemic pressures arising from human activities, which put them under threat of severe degradation and even depletion. Around the world these key resources are subject to a wide range of property rights and management regimes, the environmental efficacy and social equity of which are subject to competing ideological claims and disciplinary critiques. \u00a0\n\nHow are we different?\nWe have gathered an interdisciplinary team of philosophers, anthropologists, economists, modellers and environmental scientists to rethink how we monitor, manage, maintain and allocate globally important resources. Our aim is to work through understandings of individual and collective behaviour\u00a0and current institutional practice,\u00a0with a focus on how technical information is used in decision-making, to deliver a new framework for stewardship that will ensure that the world\u2019s essential resources remain available for generations to come.\n\nResearch Themes\n\nFundamental principles of resource stewardship\n\nThe tragedy of the commons, where the actions of individuals or small groups lead to a disastrous depletion of finite resources, is an ethical problem related to the values and behaviour of consumers and polluters. To avoid the irreversible loss of globally shared resources, we need to change common sense morality. This project brings together social scientists, modellers and philosophers to study the nature of moral limitation, and how that causes us to fail to co-operate in the global stewardship of shared resources.\nHow can science inform resource stewardship?\nWhat can we learn from mismatches, failures and successes in the use of scientific information in resource stewardship? How can information be used effectively, despite varying levels of uncertainty and risk in the reliability, accuracy and reputation of science, modelling and forecasting efforts? By asking and answering these questions, we aim gain an understanding of the impact of different information types on decision-making.\u00a0\nResource stewardship: a multi-scale, multi-dimensional problem\nA lack of understanding of the way in which impacts propagate across scales of resource management has been one of the reasons for chronic resource degradation. This project takes a multi-scale approach to analysis, embedded within the context of multiple drivers of global change.\u00a0With a focus on land and water resources, the aim is the development of a global assessment tool that will help identify different options for local land use anywhere in the world. Ultimately, the project aims to develop effective pathways for long term global resource stewardship.",

The founding father of the Section in the years of 1934-1936 was Loren C. Perry, then of Cornell University. Paleobotanical contributions at the Botanical Society of America's meetings had customarily been presented before the General Section. Professor Perry initiated discussions of forming a formal organization of the Paleobotany Section. The idea was enhanced by the visit to the U.S.A. of Dr. H. Hamshaw Thomas during the Pittsburgh meeting of the Botanical Society.\n\nThe Botanical Society Council minutes for the 30th Annual Meeting, at Washington University, St. Louis, December 31, 1935 - January 2, 1936, include an item: 'The Secretary reported a movement on the part of several of the younger members interested in paleobotany to ask for the formation of a paleobotanical section. The Council informally expressed its hearty approval of such action.' The minutes for the corresponding meeting at Atlantic City, December 29-31, 1936, include an item:'The Secretary reported plans for the organization of a Paleobotanical Section of the Society.

This requires knowledge of the interdependent components that together constitute the \"environment\", as well as a commitment to protect this environment by improving the manner in which water, land and energy are utilized by humans.\nThe Department's research activities have several general areas of activities. One focuses on water and includes hydrology, geochemistry, land-plant-atmosphere interactions and oceanography. A second activity is in the use of stable isotopes for reconstructions of paleoclimatic and of biosphere-atmosphere dynamics, and a third is in the area of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and cloud physics. A fourth area of research is in planetary sciences. \u00a0The Department is distinguished by the interactions among scientists from different backgrounds and expertise, which is critical to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the global environment. We also promote international collaboration based on short- and long-term visits for research and training by scientists who complement existing activities in the Department. The interdisciplinary nature of the Department is well reflected in the academic training of the research students. Their backgrounds vary enormously from physics and mathematics through geology to biology. We encourage the participation of students who are interested in not only investigating in depth a specific subject, but who are also interested in a broader, more integrative approach to science.\n\nScientistsShow details\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Brian Berkowitz\n\n    Prof. Brian Berkowitz\n\n    Development of chemical methods for remediation of water polluted by organic compounds and heavy metals.\n    Fluid flow and chemical transport in groundwater systems.\n    Percolation, scaling and statistical physics models of structural and dynamic processes in geological formations.\n    Experimental and theoretical analysis of reactive transport and precipitation\/dissolution patterns in porous media.\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Dr. Itay Halevy\n\n    Dr. Itay Halevy\n\n    The co-evolution of planetary climate and geochemistry on multiple timescales\n    The geological and geochemical history of Earth, planets and satellites\n    Global biogeochemical cycles and their interaction with the climate system\n    Drivers and consequences of episodes of global climatic and geochemical change\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Jacob Karni\n\n    Prof. Jacob Karni\n\n    Carbon dioxide dissociation using concentrated solar energy\n    Development of directly irradiated solar receivers.\n    Energy transport in particles seeded flows at high temperature.\n    Development of alternative fuels and their production methods using solar energy\n    Carbon dioxide dissociation using concentrated solar energy\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Dr. Yohai Kaspi\n\n    Dr. Yohai Kaspi\n\n    Geophysical fluid dynamics\n    Atmospheric dynamics on Earth and other planets\n    Storm track dynamics\n    Geostrophic turbulence\n    Climate dynamics\n    Planetary interiors\n    Gravitational signature of internal dynamics on giant planets\n    Jets on giant planets\n    Internal tides\n    The Juno mission to Jupiter\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Ilan Koren\n\n    Prof. Ilan Koren\n\n    The twilight zone - convective clouds and their interaction with the free atmosphere\n    Collaboration with:\u00a0 NOAA-ESRL Boulder CO.\n    Anthropogenic Effects on Clouds and Precipitation and the Derived Climate Forcing\n    Collaboration with:\u00a0 NASA-GSFC, UMBC\n    Cloud microphysics and dynamics\n    Cloud classification and cloud textures and morphology\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Yinon Rudich\n\n    Prof. Yinon Rudich\n\n    Health effects of atmospheric particulate matter\n    Ice nucleation by atmospheric particles\n    The transport of microorganisms in the atmosphere and their possible biogeochemical effects\n    Optical properties of atmospheric organic aerosols\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Dan Yakir\n\n    Prof. Dan Yakir\n\n    Developing the use of stable isotopes (in particular, 13C, 18O, 15N, 2H) as tracers of biogeochemical cycles on land.\n    Environmental and climatic influence on the exchange of trace gases and energy between plants, soil and the atmosphere.\n    Climatic influence on the natural abundance of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in CO2, O2, H2O and organic matter.",

        "text":"Skip Navigation LinksPurdue Agriculture > Entomology > Research Facilities\n\n\u00a0Research Facilities\n\nCampus Facilities\n\nThe Department of Entomology is housed in Smith Hall (SMTH), Whistler Agricultural Research Building (WSLR), and the Entomology Environmental Laboratory (EEL). The Center for Environmental and Regulatory Information Systems (CERIS) program and staff are located in a rented office suite off-campus. SMTH houses the teaching faculty, a student resource room, two dedicated entomology laboratory classrooms, the Boiler Bug Barn outreach center, most extension staff and applied research programs, the biological control program, the turf pest management program, the aquatic entomology program, the landscape ecology program, the Indiana CAPS program, the USDA APHIS Nuisance Wildlife program, the USDA APHIS Insect Identifier Unit, the Purdue Entomological Research Collection, and the administrative office suite. Entomology staff in WSLR are those individuals and programs that require specialized physiology, toxicology, biochemistry and molecular genetics and genomics laboratory facilities. EEL has lab and office space for the nematology program, host plant resistance program, growth chambers, and serves as the head house for the attached greenhouses.\n\nOff Campus Facilities\n\nThe Entomology Field Operations Building (EFOB) is located on a 6-acre tract with a Butler type building 1.5 miles west of campus. This facility is used for field plot equipment storage, applying pesticides in laboratory experiments, and as a general workshop for the department. The apiary is located at this site and the building provides support facilities for our honey bee research activities led by Greg Hunt. The fumigation laboratory used by the post harvest and forensic science programs is also located at EFOB. This laboratory consists of three temperature controlled fumigation chambers that provide the ability to test gas concentrations during fumigations. This is one of two such facilities in the nation. A second Butler-type building in this area serves as the bait mixing station for the USDA APHIS Nuisance Wildlife program. There are also three specially constructed outdoor rodent pens designed to restrict non-avian wildlife from moving into or out of the plots. The forensic science group is currently using these pens for replicated field work concerning animal cadavers and insect time of entry experiments. Entomology has a compartment in the Crop Protection Laboratory located at the Agronomy Research Center for storage and mixing of pesticides. The Agronomy Center For Research and Education is also the site of the Post Harvest Research and Education Center (PHERC). The PHERC is one of three facilities in the nation (the others are in Kansas and Oklahoma) with replicated research bins. Other field research is conducted at Purdue Agronomy, Horticulture, Post Harvest and Turf Centers, and with cooperators across the state.\n\nResearch Collections\n\nPurdue Entomological Research Collections (PERC)\nThe Purdue Entomological Research Collections are an integral and invaluable part of the entomological program at Purdue in that they represent the diversity and distribution of those organisms that are in essence the subject of entomological study. PERC is staffed by W. P. McCafferty (director), A. V. Provonsha (curator), and part-time student help. The collections and associated labs and offices are housed in the east basement of SMTH. The primary functions of PERC are: 1) to provide a reference source for implementing the accurate and timely identification of insects (for teaching, research, and extension); 2) to serve as a database for systematic research at Purdue and by specialists throughout the world (a large number of loans and visitations are made annually); 3) to serve as a repository for voucher specimens used in field and laboratory research; and 4) to provide a facility for maintaining representatives of the entomofauna of Indiana habitats and surrounding regions.\n\nApproximately 1,800,000 specimens are held, representing more than 140,000 species. Through collecting, donations, and exchanges, more than 540,000 specimens have been added to the collections since 1972 when the current coordinator and curator were hired, with 192,710 specimens added since the last departmental review in 2002. The majority of specimens are pinned in standard USNM style drawers. However, a large and rapidly growing collection of alcohol-preserved material is also maintained and a sizable number of specimens or parts thereof are preserved on microscope slides.\n\nAlthough taxa are broadly represented geographically, approximately 60% of the specimens are from Indiana, and PERC is by far the single most important resource center for the insects of Indiana. It is one of our long-term goals to acquire as complete as possible a representation of the Indiana insect fauna. PERC is recognized internationally as a primary resource in four areas: 1) the type collection of over 5,839 type specimens, 2) the Ephemeroptera collection of approximately 400,000 specimens, and over 2,000 species, which ranks as the most complete, diverse, and taxonomically important collection of mayflies in the world, 3) the Blatchley collection of Coleoptera, and 4) the general aquatic insect collections, which are becoming one of the most important in North America.\n\nPurdue Nematode Collection\nThe Purdue Nematode Collection, curated by V. R. Ferris, is comprised of two parts: 1) the traditional collection of Cobb slide mounts (especially of type specimens); and 2) the frozen and\/or alcohol-preserved collection of nematodes used for DNA research.\n\nThe traditional collection at one time was a major resource containing more than 200,000 permanent specimens mounted on aluminum Cobb slides in glycerin and catalogued (paper records only) at least to genus. Primarily, the collection includes soil and freshwater nematodes from diverse habitats of North America. Holdings are 60% Adenophorea and 40% Secernentea. The \"permanent\" Cobb metal slide mounts are stored in boxes in fireproof safes housed in EEL near the nematology compound microscopes. The systematics reference collection of more than 5,000 reprints, books and monographs is stored near the safes. At one time, curatorial maintenance was provided by the department, but this is no longer the case. Grants to the curator for maintenance of a small and isolated collection (although pursued for many years) are no longer feasible. This results in neglect of the collection, which ideally should be frequently monitored and specimens remounted if they show signs of drying. Occasional requests for specimen loans are handled by the Curator as her time permits.\n\nThe materials used for DNA research are mainly stored frozen (in buffer) in boxes (80 samples\/box) at \u201320o C with (paper) records maintained as to storage location, source, etc. Similar records are kept for alcohol-preserved specimens, although differences in container sizes make the physical storage of these specimens awkward. The curator attempts to replenish alcohol as it evaporates.\n\nNematode systematics research increasingly relies on molecular data, as young researchers seek to eliminate the need for laborious microscopic examination of museum specimens. This tendency may or may not change in future years, and we continue to maintain both collections as best we can.",

We have focused on preserving key high quality natural areas in the Lower Fox and La Salle County, in addition to Kendall County, has its fair share of spectacular places. Among these is the 253-acre Dayton Bluffs, which we purchased in 2013. Our continued focus in the near future will be on preserving other lands along the Lower Fox River in accordance with our Lower Fox River Strategic Land Conservation Plan.\u00a0 Our Fox River Initiative has also begun in this area to help citizens become more aware of and enjoy the Fox River in the hopes that they will then feel inspired to protect and improve it.\u00a0 Click here to learn more about the Fox River Initiative.\n\nOur involvement thus far in De Kalb County is assisting the De Kalb County Forest Preserve District acquire land for more forest preserves. Since, 2006, we have helped De Kalb County pass an open space referendum and acquire three properties totaling more than 250 acres. In addition, we hold a conservation easement on 35 acres of high quality wetland and prairie near Leland. The Big Rock Creek watershed is an important stream to us and part of its headwaters are located in De Kalb County.\n\nGrundy County has been less active for us but there is great opportunity here. TCF has been very active in the lower half of the Aux Sable Creek watershed. Although its origins and most of the watershed is located in Kendall County, the Aux Sable Creek is a high quality stream system and we don\u2019t ignore it when it crosses into Grundy County. In fact, we partnered with the City of Minooka in helping to preserve a 10-acre parcel along the creek as part of a planned greenway.\n\nTCF\u2019s involvement in other Northeast Illinois counties is limited to partnering, mentoring and providing value added services to other land conservation organizations located there. We partner with and assist similar organizations such as Conserve Lake County, Land Conservancy of McHenry County, and the Barrington Area Conservation Trust in Northwest Cook County.",
