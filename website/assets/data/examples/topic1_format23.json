        "text":"International Piano\n\nI have a long ingrained loathing for jugglers \u2013 if it is a near impossibility to spin eight plates simultaneously, that\u2019s probably because plates were designed to be stationary household items from which you eat your dinner. And listening to Christopher White\u2019s solo piano Mahler 10 \u2013 surely the strangest recorded artefact likely to emerge from this Mahler anniversary year \u2013 I heard someone juggling the impossible. Some aspects of White\u2019s athleticism and dexterousness are undeniably impressive, but I wonder if this performance really does Mahler any favours.\n\nReviews elsewhere have questioned why White didn\u2019t pick on earlier Mahler symphonies, perhaps no. 5 for which Mahler\u2019s piano rolls might set a precedent. That misses the point: White\u2019s transcriptions of movements two to five where designed to complement Ronald Stevenson\u2019s existing transcription of the first movement and, to be fair, neither man claims this as \u201cauthentic\u201d Mahler; the form of words White has concocted suggest a \u2018piano commentary\u2019 on the \u2018performing draft (by Deryck Cooke) of the uncompleted Tenth Symphony\u2019.\n\nBut the concept quickly wears thin. The inner complexities of Mahler\u2019s Tenth bust through conventional orchestral boundaries and, inevitably, leaves the piano wanting \u2013 the nine-note expressionist screech in the first movement translates into a series of weightless tremolos, and the bass drum strikes that herald the last movement becomes hollow, tinny clusters. There just aren\u2019t enough strikingly diverse timbres to tell Mahler\u2019s story, a situation not helped by a needlessly, one-dimensional recording environment.\n\n\u2014Philip Clark",

Kelsey took my son\u2019s pictures almost 5 years ago and when my daughter was born we drove 4 hours just to have Kelsey take her pictures. Kelsey is the best in business and I would never think of using anyone else. Her props and studio are the absolute best! She has something for everyone and will cater to your style and wishes. Her soft and gentle demeanor is just what a new baby (and mama!) needs. You just show up with a sleepy baby and Kelsey works her magic! I highly recommend her to all expecting mamas!!\n\n- Mika H\n\n\nKelsey is the upmost professional and takes extra steps to ensure both the parent(s) and baby are comfortable. She is always coming up with new ideas and keeps each session unique and personal. Highly recommended for newborn sessions. You will not regret it!\n\n-Jammie W\n\n\n\u00a0I was so excited to have you capture these precious perfect moments! You really are the best in town. So thankful, we will be returning when we have our next baby.\u00a0 Your studio is beautiful, organized cozy and warm.

Feel like turning your ideas into amazing stories? And ever wish you could make your creations come alive with incredible artwork?\n\nIf any of these things sounded cool to you, then How to Make Awesome Comics is the perfect book to help you on your way to comics\/cartooning genius. Let Professor Panels and Art Monkey take you through every step you'll need to be on your way!\n\nFrom the very basics (coming up with your stories and characters, learning how to draw) to more advanced levels (making art and text work together well, what makes a good villain, creating your own books from paper), How to Make Awesome Comics is a comprehensive and can't-put-down guide for every burgeoning artist, all from the mind of accomplished comic book-maker Neill Cameron.\n\nMy Take on the Book\nIf you know someone that loves to draw, and even more so loves drawing comics, this book is perfect! The book is easy to read and understand and truly lays out everything that you need to be able to draw some very cool comics. While I cannot say that I am the best artist, this book did offer me some additional insights and skills when it came to being able to create some wonderful drawings. My daughters, who are more artistically inclined than I also agreed and loved this book and have come up with some fun comics of their own becauase of this too!\n\nNew to the Divadom\u00a0or to Dad of Divas Reviews?\nPlease Subscribe to my RSS Feed!

        "text":"Juliana M., Breckenridge Colorado\n\nI met John at the Summit County Home & Garden Show. He was easy to talk to and very easy-going; a good quality for a landscape architect. I chose him as my landscape architect for all of my clients, because he seemed very easy to work with and seemed to have a passion for garden design. His talents were extremely beneficial to me because his designs are not only lovely to look at, but easy to install as well. My clients are always pleased with the results, they love the gardens he designs. He rates a 10 on a scale of 10 and I hope to keep working with him for years to come. I won a 2009 ALCC Excellence in Landscape Award for his design on the Susan Propper residence in Breckenridge.\n\nRolf and Joanie S., Big Canoe, Georgia\n\nWiggins\/Soderberg Residences\n\nWe hired John because he was personable and enthusiastic.

He was even enthusiastic about our proliferation of huge rocks.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nDixie A., Silverthorne, Colorado\n\nAgnew Residence\n\nWe found out about John through his regular column he writes for the Summit Daily News.

He went beyond the limits of my specific needs in the short term and conveyed how the project could be completed in phases. John was delightful to work with and I appreciate his knowledge, experience and willingness to go the extra mile to answer my questions. I would absolutely use his services again.\u00a0\n\nPhil C., Big Canoe, Georgia\n\nCarlock Residence\n\nI heard about John because he had designed the original landscape and hardscape for the previous owner of our home, and we liked what was in place and we wanted to add more. John\u2019s services were beneficial to us because he had a good sense of what we wanted to accomplish and had the ability to both design and manage the implementation of his design. I feel very good about my experience with John and would recommend him highly. He was conscious of our needs and worked well with our budget.\n\nSue and Howard C., Silverthorne, Colorado\n\nCarver Residence\n\nI first heard about John through an article in the Summit Daily News and liked what I read.

        "text":"Marie created a recognizable logo that was an instant hit and a boost to catwalk fundraising. She expanded on her initial creation and produced a series of print and electronic pieces that focused attention on our goal and produced dramatic results. We exceeded our million dollar goal on time thanks in large part to the positive image that Marie built for us.\n\nPat McGinnis\nCity Manager, Grand Haven\n\nI have had the opportunity to work with Marie Kar over the last few years. As a graphic designer and business woman, she has been wonderful. Her ability to understand my needs and put them in action has been outstanding. I have a product call \u201cBenson\u2019s Bottom Paint\u201d which we have been trying to market since 1988. It has gone up and done in sales due to a number of reasons. Since I started working with Marie, to come up with a new look and consistent message to try and market my product, she has used her resources to bring in other people who have worked as a team to help me achieve my goals. My new label design for the product is fresh and eye catching. My sales, even though they are small have been increasing. Marie has been a true professional to work with on this project. I\u2019ve appreciated Marie\u2019s fresh ideas with the design on the \u201cBenson\u2019s Bottom Paint\u201d paint can project. Truly unique.\n\nRandy Dahlquist R.Ph.\nBenson\u2019s Bottom Paint, Inc.\n\nMarie (Redframe Creative) is the epitome of a user friendly and professional company. Marie answers emails and phone calls almost before the request is made. Marie works to the satisfaction of the client. She isn\u2019t happy unless the client is happy. Prices are reasonable and the product is usually beyond expectations. If you contract with Marie you will not be disappointed. She is friendly, competent, thorough, timely, and puts the client first. I would not hesitate to give her the highest praise and to recommend her to anyone seeking the highest quality.\n\nRichard L. Baldwin\nButtonwood Press\n\nWhen we decided to build a new building we started thinking about branding and re-imaging the company. One of the first things we knew we needed was a logo so\nWe turned to Redframe Creative. Marie made it easy by asking the right questions about our vision and she came back with our vision as well as concepts that were variations of it. She made it fast and affordable. Thanks Redframe!\n\nJames J. Willison Sr.\nTri City Auto Repair\n\nMarie is a rare and oh-so-talented blend of advanced technological and graphics skill, creative artistry, and \u201cold school\u201d values, commitment and self discipline. I will never use another graphics design professional for my books besides her, and trust her implicitly. She sets the bar high for her work and follows through with amazing reliability.\n\nGarrett L. Turke, Ph.D.\n\nI am very happy with the work Marie has done for my business. She is very easy to communicate with and is very talented at her work! I would highly recommend Red Frame Creative!\n\nCarrie Anne Engels\nWhat a Gem Jewelry\n\nWorking with Marie and Redframe Creative was lots of fun\u2014pure pleasure; in fact, in some ways I hate to see it end. I think that\u2019s because the process was a true collaboration, which is what made this experience so enjoyable. Marie provided a creative design framework that allowed each of us to bring our own sensibilities to the project. The finished product reflects that synergy\u2014not only of the four of us, but of the four thought leaders and the eight practitioners. You can sense everyone\u2019s part in the booklets!\n\nDaryl Fischer\n\nWe so appreciated your ability to grasp the meaning behind the content and really bring it to life through the combination of design, our images, and stock photos. This was particularly impressive since you were hitting it \u201ccold.\u201d In addition, we very much appreciated your responsiveness to multiple reviewers and comments, your own lively intelligence brought to review of the two booklets and your focus on getting it right! It was a pleasure to work with you.\n\nRandy Roberts and Rachel Tooker,\nCrocker Art Museum, Sacramento, CA",
