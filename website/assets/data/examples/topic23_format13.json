We cannot promise anything yet as many of the 2016 rental contracts do not renew until the end of the current season.

        "text":"New! Greek Gulet Cruises\n\nLately Turkey has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The\u00a0troubles\u00a0are a long long way from our part of the country. Still, we know that some people are nervous about visiting\u00a0here at the moment. Gulet cruises are a Turkish tradition, but what if it was possible to take a gulet cruise in a different country?\n\nWell the good news is, we now offer gulet cruises in Greece! You can easily fly to the Greek island of\u00a0Rhodes (which is well-served by international flights), meet us at Rhodes marina, and enjoy a gulet cruise among the Dodecanese islands of Greece. With a three day cruise, we can sail around\u00a0Symi and Tilos, both islands barely touched by the modern world. If you have the time for a longer cruise, we can travel further,\u00a0to islands such as Nisiros, Kos, Pserimos, Kalymnos, Telendos, Leros, Lipsi, Arki, all the way up to Patmos. We also offer private day trips up to\u00a0three days around tiny Kastellorizo, which lies just a short distance from our home port of Ka\u015f.\n\nIn fact\u00a0the Greek islands are not new to us. We have always offered the option of visiting Kastellorizo or Rhodes, which lie a short distance offshore from the Lycian coast. In the summer of 2016, Osman went a step further, taking two long exploratory cruises to each of the Dodecanese islands, and making Greek friends and contacts along the way. With our local shipping agent in Rhodes taking care of immigration and other paperwork,\u00a0it\u2019s a smooth and hassle-free trip for our guests. Plain sailing, you might say.\n\nOver the next few weeks we\u2019ll be adding more sample itineraries to our Greek island cruises section. But as always, nothing is set in stone and every cruise is a custom one. Contact us today to discuss your Greek gulet cruise\u00a0in the Dodecanese, and escape the madding crowds in 2017 with a truly memorable island holiday.",

The all-suite, 100-guest ship touched water for the first time on December 30, 2019, and Silversea has commenced the countdown for the vessel\u2019s inaugural season. When Silver Origin welcomes travelers in the Galapagos Islands from July 18, 2020, she will be the most elegant ship to ever sail the region.\n\n\"This is an important milestone for our cruise line; it takes us one step closer to strengthening our industry-leading offering in the Galapagos further still,\u201d says Roberto Martinoli, Silversea\u2019s President and CEO. \u201cWhen Silver Origin welcomes guests in July 2020, the ship will be the most elegant vessel to ever sail in the Galapagos region. While completing the final stages of Silver Origin's construction, ensuring that the ship surpasses Silversea\u2019s trademark level of comfort, we are also readying our Expedition Team, who will deliver an enriching and memorable expedition experience for our guests.\"\n\n\nGuests traveling on Silver Origin will enjoy the highest crew-to-guest ratio in the Galapagos. Part of the ship\u2019s crew, a team of expedition experts will lead immersive shore experiences for guests. In addition to guided Zodiac excursions, hikes, and nature walks ashore\u2014all of which are included in the fare\u2014these passionate and knowledgeable professionals will offer onboard lectures, discussions and recaps in Silver Origin's innovative Basecamp. Silversea takes the opportunity to introduce some of the Expedition Team who will welcome guests aboard Silver Origin from July 2020*:\n\nAura Banda, Environmental Manager & Naturalist Guide\n\nBanda's first camera was a piece of wood cut by her grandfather on Floreana Island, Galapagos, where she first dreamed of communicating the fragility of nature through images. To achieve this goal, she studied photographic arts, languages (French and Italian) and natural sciences, earning a degree in environmental management. In 2005, she settled back home in the Galapagos and began her work as a naturalist guide and photo instructor.\n\nPaulina Aguirre, Biologist & Naturalist Guide\n\nAguirre was raised in Quito, Ecuador, where she received her university degree in education. Following a stint working as a crew member on yachts sailing across the globe, she moved to the Galapagos, where she had often vacationed with family who resided in the islands, and trained to start a new career as a naturalist and guide. Since then, she has been guiding and living on the islands, together with her daughter and husband, who is also a naturalist guide.\n\nNicolai B\u00f8lling, Biologist & Naturalist Guide\n\nBorn in Norway, B\u00f8lling was skiing with his father through the forest before he had even learned to walk. Since then, he has continued to love exploring wild nature. He studied biology and earned a master's degree focused on the environmental health of the North Sea, which allowed him to spend time on a research ship. While visiting the Galapagos, he was injured and a local girl helped him to recover. Six years later they married, and today both work for Silversea.\n\nBernardo Galvez, Architect & Naturalist Guide\n\nGalvez grew up in Guayaquil, Ecuador, a city located within mangrove estuaries. The dichotomy between natural and built environments were apparent to him at an early age and made for a unique setting in which to appreciate nature. After pursuing studies in architecture and urbanism at Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, he divided his time between Germany and Ecuador. Now a resident of the Galapagos, he still looks to nature for inspiration for his designs while he walks the trails and dives under the waters of the islands as a naturalist guide.\n\nLeandro Vaca, Biologist & Naturalist Guide\n\nVaca lives in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, the capital of Galapagos Province, situated on the island of San Crist\u00f3bal. During his childhood he had the privilege of being surrounded by nature and soon fell in love with it. He studied biology at the Universidad de Guayaquil, where he focused his undergraduate thesis on the various fish species of the Galapagos. After 10 years, he took his experience and biology degree back home to Galapagos, where he worked to develop his skills as a naturalist and interpreter of wildlife.\n\nJason Heilmann, Naturalist Guide\n\nGrowing up in northern California, Heilmann was surrounded by the incomparable nature of the Pacific Northwest. While pursuing a higher education there, he met his future wife, an Ecuadorian woman who set him on his path to eventually living in one of the most revered natural environments on earth, the Galapagos. After being certified as a naturalist guide by the Galapagos National Park, he also spent time working as a naturalist in Alaska, British Columbia, and Cuba. He currently resides in Ecuador and on the Galapagos Islands with his wife and son.\n\nJeffo Marquez, Naturalist Guide\n\nBorn and raised in the Galapagos Islands, Marquez was inspired by his father's job as a Galapagos herpetologist, which afforded him opportunities to participate in several field trips, working with Galapagos reptiles alongside his father. This certified Galapagos naturalist guide, with a background in environmental management, has also worked as a naturalist and professional photo instructor in such wildlife-rich places as Costa Rica, Antarctica, the Falklands, South Georgia, Baja California and the upper Amazon.\n\n\nTravelers who reserve a Galapagos voyage with Silversea receive round-trip flights between Ecuador and the Galapagos; a two-night, pre-cruise hotel stay in Quito; transfers between airport, hotel and ship; and an immersive \"Quito by Night\" tour.\n\nTravelers who book by January 31, 2020, can take advantage of free round-trip economy air from select U.S. and Canadian gateways for travel to Ecuador on select Galapagos expeditions.\n\nGuests traveling aboard Silver Origin will journey in a luxurious enclave of ocean-view suites, sumptuous cuisine, and the personalized service of a butler. Enriching the experience are such all-inclusive amenities as complimentary select wines, premium spirits and soft drinks served throughout the ship; in-suite minibar stocked with local snacks; 24-hour room service and in-suite dining; complimentary Wi-Fi; and complimentary expedition gear that includes a waterproof backpack, raincoat and premium metallic water bottle.\n\nSilver Origin will continue the award-winning legacy of the retiring Silver Galapagos by alternating two Saturday-to-Saturday, seven-day itineraries between Baltra and San Crist\u00f3bal. On both itineraries, guests will spend their days exploring Darwin's \"Living Laboratory of Evolution,\" where they might spot rare giant tortoises, marine iguanas, Blue-footed Boobies and sea lions.\n\nNot only will Silver Origin be the most elegant ship to ever sail the pristine archipelago, but she will also excel in environmental friendliness. Purpose-built with the environment in mind, the innovative new ship will feature a dynamic positioning system, which will be used when the ship is positioned over delicate seabed ecosystems to prevent the anchor from causing damage; incorporate in-suite freshwater purification systems that drastically reduce the use of plastic on board; and meet the highest standards of energy efficiency in the segment.\n\nFor more information about Silver Origin:\n\n\nFeatured Posts\nRecent Posts",

        "text":"Prev Next\n\nJan 10, 2012\n\nCruise for Gold Qualifiers\u2014MaryDawn and Sheldon Hatch\n\nCongratulations to MaryDawn and Sheldon Hatch from Olivia, Minnesota, on qualifying for the Cruise for Gold trip! Here's what they had to say about qualifying for the cruise\u2026\n\n\"Qualifying for the Cruise for Gold is such an exciting venture for my husband and me. I can't believe we really pulled it off! This is such a great opportunity to be around likeminded people and learn so much from other Cruise for Gold qualifiers as well as Jeff Graham.\n\n\"My friend from high school (and now sponsor) Leslie Faris was very excited about getting started with Monavie. She invited me to her house for a tasting party in Texas. I had heard of MonaVie in my small town in rural Minnesota because someone was selling it in a small coffee shop in the town where I live. My daughter Torrie, who is now a distributor, told me to buy a couple of bottles. She had heard it was really good for you. I did, and my whole family loved it. But when I went back for more, they were out. That was three years ago.\n\n\"One day last year, Leslie called and asked me, 'Do you know what Byron Moles does for a living?' Byron and I had gone to high school together as well, and we were now Facebook friends. Byron's status updates always sounded so fun with his travels and motivational updates. I told Leslie, 'I don't know what he is doing, but he certainly took the right path in life!' That is when Leslie told me about his success with MonaVie. So, I took Leslie up on her invite to Texas. I signed up as a distributor on October 16, 2011, and I have been on a whirlwind of fun ever since!\n\n\"I have never worked with such helpful and motivated people as Byron and Leslie. I am brand new to community commerce, and I was told by a fellow distributor that it takes a good, strong upline to have a good, strong downline. I believe that to be true! When I returned to Minnesota, I was no longer surrounded by the excitement that had been created in Texas. I was in a small town and needed to create my own excitement quickly because Byron had told me about the Cruise for Gold, and I was determined to be on it!\n\n\"I sat down and made two lists just as Todd Hartog had done. One was a list of people who I thought would be interested, and one was a list of people I was going to wave to from my Mercedes. I began listening to the conference calls and watched at least two Black Diamond documentaries a night. Byron, Leslie, and I text like crazy. I watched MonaVie University. I needed to learn as much as I could because I was alone here in the middle of small-town, rural Minnesota.\n\n\"I signed up four people in the first two weeks, and from there I told them that I would talk to anyone they wanted me too. All they had to do was set up the meeting place and time. I was offering a case of juice to anyone who had a tasting party. Leslie was offering to match the orders people made, and Byron would offer bottles\/cases of juice depending on how much PV was purchased. This was an idea we had received from another couple who qualified for the cruise using techniques like these. It was crazy, fun, and it worked! I was having so much fun. Being a MonaVie distributor is the perfect job for me.\n\n\"My husband is now on board with me, and he sets me up with so many people to meet. Because he saw what MonaVie did for me, he started drinking it and feels so much better. I put a sign up in his shop that says 'ASK SHELDON WHY HE IS FEELING BETTER THAN HE HAS IN YEARS!' And, people do ask him constantly.\n\n\"I cannot wait to escape from the Minnesota winter and head to the Bahamas with my husband and all the others who share the MonaVie difference. My goal now is to help my downline get to Maui in September! Let's do it! I want to give special thanks to Byron, Leslie, and Shannon Rothmeier. They are a wonderful support system who contact me nearly every day to keep the excitement going strong. Every person who I have shared MonaVie with has his or her own wonderful story about how their lives have improved. I am passionate about MonaVie and love sharing the MORE Project. We are proud to say that we are MonaVie!\"\n\nPrev Next",

The objectives of the meeting are to further educate tourism stakeholders on the Zika virus and to encourage stakeholders to take preventive measures to mitigate the spread of Zika.\n\nMinister of Tourism Obie Wilchcombe said the ministry continues to be proactive in the fight against the virus.\n\n\u201cThe primary focus of our meeting on Monday is to discuss precautions that we can take to combat the Zika virus and ensure that our visitors have a safe and healthy experience in our islands,\u201d Wilchcombe said.\n\n\u201cThe Bahamas remains a safe destination and we will continue to be. We have a lot of confidence in the work the Ministry of Health is doing to manage Zika and mitigate further cases.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Health Ministry Dr. Perry Gomez said that there are now eight confirmed cases of Zika on the island of New Providence.\n\nHealth officials continue to fog on New Providence and the family of islands.\n\nThe Zika virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. However, the virus is also spread from mother to baby during pregnancy and during sexual intercourse.\n\nHealth Officials advise anyone travelling to The Bahamas who feel they may have symptoms of the virus to contact the National Disease Surveillance Unit at 502-4776, 502-4790, 376-3809 or 376-4705.\n\nVisitors to The Bahamas receive educational pamphlets about the virus at all ports of entry. The pamphlet includes symptoms, prevention tips and contact information for the Ministry of Health.\n\nHotels and guest properties throughout The Islands of The Bahamas are also continuing their proactive measures.\n\nProactive measures include:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Providing staff and guests with information on Zika so that they are aware of the signs and symptoms, how Zika is transmitted and how it can be prevented.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Having insect repellant available to visitors.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Avoiding storing water in outdoor containers to prevent them from becoming mosquito-breeding sites.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Covering water tanks or reservoirs so that mosquitoes do not get in.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Avoiding the build-up of garbage, which can act as a breeding site for mosquitoes. Putting garbage in closed plastic bags and keep it in closed containers.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Uncovering and unblocking gutters and drains to release stagnant water.\n\nAll travelers are advised to:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Stay informed about the Zika situation in countries they are travelling to.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Use insect repellents on exposed skin. Insect repellents that contain DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or IR3535 are the most effective and safe when used according to the label. If also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Where possible, wear light colored long-sleeved shirts and long pants, socks and shoes to minimize exposed skin.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When indoors use air conditioning and keep the doors and windows closed, unless they are screened, to keep out mosquitoes. If this is not possible, sleep under mosquito nets to prevent bites.\n\nWhat should you do if you feel sick and think you may have Zika?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Consult a healthcare professional if you are feeling ill, especially if you have a fever. If you have returned home, make sure to tell them about your travel.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Use acetaminophen or paracetamol to treat fever and pain.\n\nGet lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A person infected with Zika will have the virus in their blood for the first week of infection. The virus can be passed on to other mosquitoes if they bite you while you are carrying the virus. Therefore, be especially careful to prevent mosquito bites during the first week to avoid spreading the disease.\n\nTravelers are encouraged to visit Bahamas.com\/pressroom for any updates on Zika.\n\nComment on this Article:\n\nTime limit is exhausted.

Similar to its hotel, attractions and city sections, TripAdvisor's new restaurant section gathers online articles, guidebooks and web postings about a given restaurant, allowing travel consumers to review and compare multiple points of view on the quality and value of that restaurant. TripAdvisor is the first travel search engine of its kind to combine unbiased information from around the web on hotels, destinations, attractions and now restaurants to give consumers a comprehensive set of research tools for planning and booking all of the most important aspects of a vacation.\n\nStarting this month, consumers visiting can access restaurant listings for more than 40,000 restaurants across the United States. Each listing will feature restaurant reviews from an array of sources: articles from top periodicals and guidebooks as well as net comments and user reviews from patrons who have actually dined at the establishments.\n\nJust as TripAdvisor ranks the top hotels with its proprietary Hotel Popularity Index, TripAdvisor now ranks the top restaurants for a given city based on the quantity and quality of information available about that restaurant on the web. With this ranking of the most popular restaurants, TripAdvisor users can now reduce the risk of making a bad decision when faced with the daunting task of choosing a high-quality, enjoyable restaurant during their vacation. Launching first in the United States, restaurant coverage will expand in the coming months to various locations around the globe.\n\nWith the addition of restaurants, TripAdvisor now offers a much more robust suite of vacation research tools. So, for example, when planning a trip to New York City, consumers can access information about the city at: City_New_York-Vacations.html.\n\nHere, they can view travel information on vacation packages, most popular hotels and top attractions. Now, in addition, users will be able to see the most popular restaurants in that city and access information about each by clicking on the Dining tab: New_York.html\n\nRestaurants are dynamically ranked by popularity based on the most current information available on the web.\n\n\"Whether to celebrate a special occasion or simply to sample the local flavor, enjoying a meal at a well-chosen restaurant can be a priceless part of a vacation,\" said Steve Kaufer, CEO of TripAdvisor. \"Just as our consumers want to know they're choosing a high-quality hotel, many want to plan ahead to ensure that their dining experience will meet all of their needs. By adding restaurants to our site, we've given consumers one place to find all of the unbiased opinions important to their travel planning. We'll continue to add features like restaurants to our site to make TripAdvisor the most comprehensive travel research engine for smarter vacation purchases.\"\n\nAbout TripAdvisor\n\nTripAdvisor, Inc. provides a comprehensive travel search engine and directory that helps consumers research their travel plans via the web. is the 7th most popular travel website worldwide, according to comScore Media Metrix (May, 2004), and has won dozens of awards, including PC Magazine's Top 100 Web Sites and Forbes Best of the Web.

        "text":"World Tourism Forum Lucerne Announces Finalists of the Start-Up Innovation Camp\n\nWorld Tourism Forum Lucerne Announces Finalists of the Start-Up Innovation Camp\n\nLucerne, Switzerland, March 12, 2021 \/ TRAVELINDEX \/ World Tourism Forum Lucerne (WTFL) has in recent years worked on bringing together talented young founders and investors, as well as enabling important decision-makers to access a unique network of start-ups. This year is no exception, and WTFL appealed to the tourism-related start-up scene to apply for the Start-Up Innovation Camp at the end of April. From over 400 applications received from more than 90 countries, 15 finalists were chosen. During the digital Start-Up Innovation Camp, they will receive exclusive input and coaching from industry experts and the unique opportunity to pitch their business model to interested investors. The recently developed Dealflow Tool will allow start-ups and investors to be matched even more easily in the future.\n\nLast November, World Tourism Forum Lucerne launched a call to the founders of tourism-related start-ups around the world inviting them to apply to this year\u2019s Start-Up Innovation Camp. Over 400 applications were received from more than 90 countries, covering a broad spectrum ranging from digital solutions and gastro-guides to mattress rental. The scale of innovation and creativity is vast. This proves that innovative spirit is alive and well, despite the ongoing global pandemic. That\u2019s why it is more important than ever to connect the driving forces behind it with established sources of knowledge and expertise, in order to shape the future of tourism together.\n\nStart-ups benefit from exclusive expert knowledge\n\nFrom all applicants, three finalists were selected from each of the five categories \u00abRecovering\u00bb (Covid-19), \u00abLiving\u00bb (Hospitality), \u00abExploring\u00bb (Mobility & Destination), \u00abSavoring\u00bb (Gastronomy), \u00abImpacting\u00bb (Social Impact & Sustainability). At the end of April, the finalists will receive the golden opportunity to spend four days interacting with experts and investors.\n\nThe WTFL Start-Up Innovation Camp will be a digital event and is part of the Innovation Camp taking place this year in Andermatt, Switzerland. The Innovation Camp has been made possible thanks to the support of its Innovation Partners Accenture, Les Roches, Innosuisse and its Start-Up Partners TTC, Lakestar and Hapimag. As Innovation Partner, Accenture\u00a0will give the finalists valuable input about relevant topics, such as strategy and funding. Furthermore, Accenture will offer guidance to participants, together with the other partners, via individual coaching sessions. On the final day, the start-ups will pitch their business model in front of investors and a jury of experts. The winning teams from the five categories will each receive a cash prize of 5000 Swiss Francs.\n\nThe new Dealflow Tool makes it even easier for start-ups to connect with investors\n\nIn its continual search for start-ups with novel and promising concepts for the tourism industry, WTFL has held many regional, national and international Start-Up Innovation Camps since 2015. Over the years, WTFL has therefore built up a unique network of start-ups. The Innovation Camps are based on the four cornerstones: \u00abbusiness optimization\u00bb, \u00abbusiness expansion\u00bb, \u00abpitching\u00bb and \u00abnetworking\u00bb, and provide the participants a valuable opportunity to connect with investors.\n\nWTFL is convinced that innovative business models, agile thinking and strong partnerships positively influence the future of the entire tourism industry. Both sides benefit from a mutual exchange of ideas between established and fledgling businesses. However, WTFL doesn\u2019t just match start-ups with potential investors, it also gives a voice to small businesses that want to actively shape the travel, tourism and hospitality industry. To further enable these connections outside of the Innovation Camps themselves, WTFL has been working on the development of a new Dealflow Tool for the past two years (see below).\n\nDealflow Tool:\u00a0The Dealflow Tool connects the world\u2019s best start-ups with the right investors. The new digital platform is an extension of the overall WTFL concept, which for over 10 years has offered international start-ups, experts and investors a platform for the exchange of ideas. Used in partnership with the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) the tool can also benefit tourism destinations, enabling them to create, support and foster a start-up community that brings in new, future-oriented and disruptive ideas.\n\nStart-Up Innovation Camp:\u00a0Since 2015, WTFL has been organizing regional, national and international Start-Up Innovation Camps. In them, tourism-related start-ups are invited to an event lasting several days, where they can participate in workshops, benefit from expert-led coaching sessions on various subjects, and network with investors. This year\u2019s Start-Up Innovation Camp will be held purely digitally.\n\nFind out more about the 15 finalists at\n\nInnovation Festival 2021:\u00a0At the inaugural hybrid Innovation Festival leading personalities from the tourism industry and politics, as well as investors and start-ups will come together at the end of April to discuss the brightest new approaches. World Tourism Forum Lucerne is closely observing the pandemic situation and reserves the right to make changes to the date and programme.",
