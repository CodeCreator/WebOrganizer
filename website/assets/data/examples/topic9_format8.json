Because this Policy only applies to the LNAA Website itself and not linked websites, you should examine the privacy policy of any other websites that you access from the LNAA Website.\n\nPlease carefully read this Policy before submitting any personal information (including your e-mail address) for notification of service updates, initiating an online transaction, providing information with respect to employment opportunities, or for any other reason. Please note that this Policy may change from time to time without special notice to you, so please check back to review the most recent version of this Policy.\n\nFor purposes of this Policy, \u201cpersonal information\u201d means any information concerning an individual person, which, because of a name, number, symbol, mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify that person. The LNAA only collects personal information about you when you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail, initiating an online transaction, or submitting information for employment purposes. The information that is available to us from your visit to the LNAA Website depends upon which sections of the Website you visit and what actions you take during such visit.\n\nInformation Collected Automatically When You Visit the LNAA\u00a0Website:\n\nThe LNAA monitors LNAA Website user traffic and patterns, and automatically collects certain non-personal information about your visit such as the Internet domain name from which you access the LNAA Website, the type of browser and operating system you use, the date and time of your visit, the pages you visit, and the referring website address, if any. This information is used to improve the content of the LNAA Website and to help the LNAA understand how users are interacting with the LNAA Website. This information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and the LNAA will not sell or otherwise disclose this information for commercial marketing purposes.\n\nHow the LNAA Collects Your Personal Information:\n\nThe LNAA does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to the LNAA Website unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail or initiating an online transaction such as filling out a registration form or completing an order form, or for purposes of employment. You may choose not to send us an e-mail, register online for a service, complete an online order form, or submit information for employment purposes. While your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to receive specific services or products through the LNAA Website, it will not prevent you from requesting services or products from the LNAA by other means and will normally not have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of the LNAA Website, including browsing or downloading most publicly available information.\n\nThe LNAA does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through the LNAA Website. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in an e-mail or through an online transaction will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted by federal or state law, be subject to public access. The LNAA strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children\u2019s Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are requested to provide personal information online, or otherwise have the opportunity to provide such information online.\n\nSpecific ways that LNAA collects personal information may include, but is not limited to the following:\n\nWhat We Do with the Information We Collect:\n\nThe LNAA will only collect personal information through the LNAA Website or disclose personal information collected through the LNAA Website if the user has consented to the collection or disclosure of such personal information, or under the circumstances described below. The voluntary disclosure of personal information to the LNAA by the user, including participation in an online transaction, whether solicited or unsolicited, constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by the LNAA for the purposes reasonably ascertainable from the nature and terms of the disclosure.\n\nThe LNAA may periodically send promotional emails with information we think you may find interesting using the e-mail address which you have provided in one of the above ways.\n\nThe LNAA will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties, with the exception of our affiliates. The LNAA may share your information with select partners for their own direct marketing purposes. The LNAA will otherwise never release your information to third parties outside of the LNAA network. To learn more about the LNAA\u2019s affiliates, you may contact the LNAA at the address provided in this Policy.\n\nHow We Use Cookies, Online Advertising and Other Tracking Technologies:\n\nThe LNAA uses common Internet technologies, such as cookies, website statistics tracking through Google Analytics, display and pay-per-click advertising (including remarketing) through Google Ads, and through other digital advertising opportunities. These technologies may be in place and active on our website, LNAA\u2019s official social media profiles, and any related websites, applications or services owned by LNAA or our affiliates.\n\nA cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer\u2019s hard drive. If you allow cookies to be installed through your web browser, the cookie will analyze your web traffic to better personalize your Internet experience. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. Cookies and other technology may be used to collect information about visitors to our website, use of our online services, and interactions with our emails, advertisements and other marketing content.\u00a0 A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. Collected information may include, but not be limited to, browser type, operating system and IP address. This data may be merged with your behavior and interaction data, such as what pages you viewed or links you clicked.\n\nYou can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.\n\nDisclosure and Retention of Information Collected Through the LNAA Website:\n\nThe disclosure of information, including personal information, collected through the LNAA Website is subject to the provisions of the Pennsylvania RTKL.\n\nThe information collected through the LNAA Website is retained by the LNAA in accordance with the applicable records retention and disposition requirements of Pennsylvania law. Information concerning these records retention and disposition schedules may be obtained at\u00a0\n\nConfidentiality and Integrity of Personal Information Collected Through the LNAA Website:\n\nThe LNAA takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.\n\nWherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for \u201chttps\u201d at the beginning of the address of the web page.\n\nWhile we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.\n\nThe LNAA is strongly committed to protecting personal information collected through the LNAA Website against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Consequently, the LNAA limits employee access to personal information collected through the LNAA Website to only those employees who need access to the information in the performance of their official duties. Employees who have access to this information are required to maintain its confidentiality and disclose it only as permitted under this Policy.\n\nIn addition, the LNAA has implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of our information technology assets, including, but not limited to, authenticating, monitoring, auditing, and encrypting. Security procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of the LNAA Website as part of our continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of information.\n\nL...

RRG also may conduct user surveys on the Web, which usually are intended to provide RRG with information on a number of areas, such as user identity, user viewing habits, whether or not users found what they were searching for, whether the Site content is relevant to user needs, and the like.
