(Picture of the necklaces at the bottom). \u00a0Please leave a comment and email to enter).\n\nBlushing At My Computer Screen:\n\nRomance and erotic romance authors have a rare opportunity to live out fantasies we may never dreamed possible.\u00a0 In our minds we can make love to a werewolf, or travel in time for a romantic rendezvous.\u00a0 It really is an amazing job for someone who likes to live in his or her head!\n\nHowever, along with this type of writing fun comes certain situations where even I have blushed at my computer screen:\n\nHere are my top five blushable moments:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first time I wrote the word nipples -\u00a0 Not peaks, not tight apex, but nipples.\u00a0 It was my first foray into learning how not to use euphemisms for everything.\u00a0 I actually turned away from my monitor as I typed the word, but I also crossed over the threshold into being a real author who doesn't use purple prose.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dealing with the condom - \u00a0Unless we are writing historical or paranormal, safe sex is important, and many publishing houses require it.\u00a0 Somehow putting the condom on gives me no trouble, but the whole disposing of it seems to perplex me.\u00a0 It is not something that you want to spend a lot of time talking about, or at least I don't. \u00a0\u00a0I finally resorted to researching proper condom etiquette.\u00a0 FYI the rule is that the man is responsible or dealing with his own\u2026 disposal.\u00a0 For my story that was just released, Hands On Me, I managed to turn this once awkward scene, into something that helped move the plot along.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shaving and grooming \u2013 I never really discussed this at length, but then I had a critique that asked me to describe my hero's \"situation.\" Every generation seems to have their own standards for handling their grooming.\u00a0 Right now the trend is for little to no pubic hair.\u00a0 I know use this to show something about my character.\u00a0 Is my hero male a metrosexual who keeps everything perfect?\u00a0 Or do I have a man who doesn't care about following the crowd?\u00a0 In a upcoming story I actually used this, not only as comic relief, but to show how my hero changes once he's in love.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Double Penetration \u2013 Anyone who writes sex scenes knows that it has to be more than an instruction sheet, but somehow my first double penetration scene gave me tons of trouble and lots of deep blushes.\u00a0 There were just so many parts and pieces to fit together correctly, and I had to make sure my readers would understand what I meant.\u00a0 I wrote the scene first as an outline making sure I had everything in the right place, and then came back and added in the plot, etc.\u00a0 However, in a m\u00e9nage romance, this scene can be one of the most emotional.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pushing My Own Limits \u2013There have been many times where I have been lying in bed thinking about a sexy scene, it may push the boundaries, or sound a little left of center, but I have found that one hundred percent of the time when I go with my gut, push past my own boundaries and write the scene as I envisioned, it turns out much better.\u00a0 For my upcoming story, The Promise, I was curious as to what would happen if my heroine was denied her orgasm, I went at it full-throttle, and it goes down as one of my favorite scenes I have ever written.\u00a0\n\nOne thing I have learned from writing erotic romance is that if it turns me on, it has a better chance of doing the same to my readers.\u00a0 At the end of the day, isn't that what we all want?\u00a0\n\nI wish you all happy and sexy reading!\n\nHands on Me\nKim Carmichael\nAgent Gwen Fredricks is a living target.\u00a0 Captured after a failed mission, the code to crack a safe has literally been permanently hidden on her.\u00a0 To free herself, she must retrieve a final key.\u00a0\u00a0 All\nAgent Colin Alexander has to do to avoid a desk job is get a code said to be on an enemy agent.\u00a0\u00a0 He never dreamed it would actually be on the agent, especially Gwen.\nThe simple shoot-and-swoop mission takes a turn for these two sometime-lovers and full-time rivals when they call a truce to give into their desire.\u00a0 Now with the promise to keep both hands on each other at all times, they share a night together.\u00a0 Loyalties are tested when Gwen manages to swipe the key away, and Colin discovers the code carefully embedded into Gwen's tramp stamp tattoo in a glow of UV light.\u00a0 When morning comes they must decide if what they feel for each other is worth betraying their agencies.\n\nAbout the Author:\nKim Carmichael began writing eight years ago when her love of happy endings inspired her to create her own.\u00a0 She has a weakness for bad boys and techno geeks, and married her own computer whiz after he proved he could keep all her gadgets running.\u00a0 When not writing, she can usually be found slathered in sunscreen trolling Los Angeles and helping top doctors build their practices.\n\n\"Stop!\" A man yelled.\nThe barrel of another gun met her inches from her face. She tensed, not from the gun, but from the familiar inflection in his voice. The position of both their weapons hid the man's face.\n\"Get in and lower your gun, or we'll both lose.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Back up and lower yours, or you won't have a hand left.\" No one told her what to do, not ever again. The click of her cocking her weapon echoed around them.\nHe stepped back. \"Get in and close the door.\"\nWith her gun still raised, she stepped and waited for her opponent to flinch first.\n\"Now.\" He moved a fraction of an inch.\nShe did the same, and with the silent acknowledgement they would both comply, they lowered their guns in unison. She almost shot herself in the foot at the sight of the man who greeted her. Before she made a mistake, she de-cocked her gun and shook her head. \"Colin?\" Her body betrayed her by trembling. Was this her punishment?\n\"Gwen.\" He shoved the gun in his waistband. \"You're the one. I would have never guessed.\"\nThink. She screamed at herself to remember her training, and not allow him to best her or distract her. She glanced around the room, giving her time to not look at him. Agents were supposed to be everyday people and blend in, but Colin Alexander stood out. From the moment she quite literally fell into his lap through a two-story ceiling three years ago, she wasn't sure why his agency chose such a standout. She supposed his combed-back black hair and golden eyes were some bizarre form of female torture.\n\nWednesday, September 12, 2012\n\nDemon Mine is here! 9-12-12\n\nI am so excited to share with you all the release of Demon Mine. It's my pride and joy and I was so happy when I received the acceptance letter from Evernight Publishing saying that they wanted it. Evernight was who I wanted this story to go to from the beginning. They didn't disappoint me at all with their hard work, the most excellent cover art and getting me through edits.\n\nFor your chance to win a free copy, please comment on this post and also leave your email if you wish to be entered into the giveaway!\n\nEvernight Publishing:\nHere's the blurb and an excerpt:\n\nSamael is a fallen angel doomed to repeat his life and love for Lilianna Jackson over and over again.

        "text":"Friday, May 16, 2014\n\nBlog Tour - REFLECTION & GUEST BLOG by Elene Sallinger\n\n(The Chrysalis Series #2)\nby Elene Sallinger\nReleased: May 6, 2014, Sourcebooks Casablanca  Amazon.UK  Amazon.AUS\n Kobo  iTunes  Barnes&Noble\n\n\nThe moment Bridget Ross and Connor Reynolds run into each other on the street \u2013 quite literally while out on a run \u2013 tempers flare. But when the two get together for an apology coffee date, it\u2019s clear that the coffee isn\u2019t the only thing steaming.\n\nConnor is a charming artist without purpose. His own tragic pas prevents him from putting down roots or committing to anything. Bridget is feisty but guarded. She\u2019s aching to fill a void in her life but is wracked with guilt over her past and denies herself true pleasure. Can this gorgeous man tempt Bridget to finally succumb to her desires?\n\n(The Chrysalis Series #2)\nby Elene Sallinger\nARC Review\nReleased: May 6, 2014, Sourcebooks Casablanca\n\nMy rating:\u00a04 of 5\u00a0\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nBridget Ross appears to have her life together. Professor at a small college, good friends, nice dog and plenty of social interaction. But underneath that polished and slightly reserved exterior she hides a traumatic history that has left such an impact, it has changed the way she sees the world and more importantly, how she sees herself.\n\nConnor Reynolds has perfect balance in his life. Or so he tells himself. He works to take care of his immediate needs, he uses his camera as a creative outlet and he paints to feed his soul. On top of that he knows exactly who he is. But when an innocent tangle of dogs in the park brings him to his knees in front of a beautiful woman, he feels his world tilting.\n\nCharmed, but also a little apprehensive, Bridget tries to resist the persistent attentions of the much younger Connor, but with his gentle persuasion he manages to convince her to take a chance on him. But will Connor be able to release the fire Bridget is keeping so tightly contained inside?\n\n\nAnother fabulous book in the Chrysalis Series by Elene Sallinger!! A standalone novel with characters from the first book making their appearance, but this is a story all in itself.\u00a0\n\nI found REFLECTION to have a bit less of an edge than AWAKING, in that the plot was more predictable, there was less darkness in the build-up, less tension. The overall result was a very emotional journey for both main characters, actually. Although Connor's need for \"reflection\" did not become obvious - to him at least - until the final chapters of the book.\n\nBridget has reprogrammed her sensual development after a traumatic experience gave her a negative association, resulting in rather stunted and unfulfilling emotional and sexual relationships. Not to mention some massive trust issues she has still not been able to work through. And by my calculations, this event was more than half her life-time ago. That counts for a lot of years of damaging inner dialogue, without any apparent proper counseling to mitigate the effects. No wonder this woman cannot open herself up after simply unloading her past as if that is a magic healing.\u00a0\n\nConnor faces a similar emotional damaging pattern, except that for him it doesn't affect something inside him, but something that he can control - or thinks he can control - externally, painting. Of course the control is something Connor craves, something he would like to explore with Bridget. The dom in him is torn between knowing what she needs and honoring what she wants. He is so focused on her, that he loses sight of his own responsibilities and shortcomings.\n\nAn ironic parallel, not seen by either of the main characters, but needed to be put in focus by a third party. I guess Bridget did see at some point, but Connor needed to be told, which was a bit of a disappointment in all honesty.\u00a0\n\nI enjoyed this couple together, I liked Connor's irreverent nature and the way Bridget could let go when she wanted to. The chemistry was there, the heat was there, but I feel we never got to the point where we see them truly reach all their potential until the very last. I would've enjoyed more exploration.\n\nElene Sallinger's writing is excellent, her style is flowing and sharp. Not necessarily 'easy reading' but not too complex either, simply writing with some substance. A good author to choose if you are looking for some literary bite on your erotica!\n\n\u2728A careful and sensual exposure..\u2728\n\n**Copy provided in return for an honest review.**\n\nThe Heart of the BDSM Power Exchange\nby Elene Sallinger\n\nWhen asked to write a guest post, I was asked to expound upon why I thought people would be drawn to the power exchange of BDSM. It is my personal opinion, that the reasons are so varied as to be impossible to narrow them down into a cogent post. However, what can be discussed is the nature of the power exchange itself.\u00a0To put it as simply as possible, I believe that the power exchange in D\/s-M\/s is really symbiotic and synergistic and not an either\/or, you vs. me scenario. And, it is this symbiosis to which I believe people are drawn.\n\nSymbiosis was a concept I struggled with when I was first introduced to it in high school biology. I was raised in a highly competitive environment where my sisters and I were encouraged to compete against each other for parental approval. As such, I didn\u2019t grow up with a point of reference for a relationship that by its very nature is synergistic. And, for me, those two words define a\u00a0healthy\u00a0D\/s-M\/s relationship \u2013 symbiotic and synergistic.\n\nIn a symbiotic relationship, two or more individuals are inter-dependent upon one another for the relationship to succeed. D\/s-M\/s relationships are obviously symbiotic, but they take this a step further than vanilla relationships because of the negotiated role. There is no Master without a slave and a Dominant can\u2019t dominate without a submissive. Therefore, both parties are necessary to the relationship for it to even exist.\n\nYou could take a broad stroke and say that every relationship is symbiotic and I think that is a fair statement, but why I think it is particularly important in D\/s-M\/s is because of the roles involved and the relinquishment of authority. Trust, compassion and consideration are required in exponentially higher quantities in D\/s-M\/s, simply because of the overt potential for harm to one\u2019s psyche and person.\n\nWhat I believe is beautiful about D\/s-M\/s is the synergism that results when the relationship is handled the right way. In a healthy relationship, both parties become something greater than themselves and\u00a0the relationship itself\u00a0is the engine that drives their growth. The specific definition of synergy is \u201ctwo or more things functioning together to produce a result not independently obtainable.\u201d I think these types of relationship do exactly that. A submissive has a need to submit. There are things they may not do of their own volition for whatever reason. The desire to please along with the trust they have for their Dom or Master gives them the incentive and courage to try something they may not otherwise do. Without their Dom or Master they would not achieve this.\n\nA healthy vanilla relationship can be synergistic, but I don\u2019t believe it is an inherent quality of vanilla relationships because of the live and let live principle. I may encourage or suggest things to my partner and he does not have to comply. Therefore, something that may be of true benefit to him may never be experienced because I don\u2019t have the authority to compel him to try it and vice versa. I can say conclusively that there are things my partner has recommended that I didn\u2019t do because he couldn\u2019t compel me to that I've come to regret immensely. I now live with a lot of what ifs.\nOkay, so my next words are might raise an uproar, but I see a leader, any leader, as the ultimate servant. Therefore, I see the Dominant or Master as serving the relationship. Does this mean they are submissive? No.\u00a0A submissive serves by yielding\u00a0to their Dom\/Master. Does it mean they are serving their submissive\/slave? Yes, insofar as it is required in order to fulfill the needs of the sub\/slave because\u00a0a Dom\/Master serves by\u00a0leading. But, what is service really. Merriam-Webster has the definition, \u201ccontribution to the welfare of others.\u201d Is this not what the Dom\/Master does? I would say whole heartedly they contribute to the welfare of their sub\/slave.\n\nThere are two great quotes that I love around this topic:\n\n\"To help others become something that they could never on their own become, is putting value into that other person.\" ~ Unknown\n\n\"A person who is worthy of being a leader wants power not for himself, but in order to be of service.\" ~ US Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr.\n\nThe latter sums up my feelings on what a Dom\/Master\u2019s responsibility is \u2026 to fulfill the needs of the sub\/slave and\u00a0by virtue of that, serve their own. You see, my belief is that the Dom\/Master is a caretaker first and foremost. They have an inherent need to take care of and elevate their sub\/slave. Because of the nature of the submissive\/slave, they often must take a hard line and be firm. So, in my opinion, what distinguishes the Dom\/Master is the\u00a0will to act.\n\nAll of this is a very long way of saying that I believe that all D\/s-M\/s relationships whether poly or not, are inherently symbiotic because the role of each person cannot exist without the other and they are synergistic because, by fulfilling these roles successfully, the resulting dynamic for all parties is greater than what any one of the individuals could achieve on their own.\n\nI'll also state for the record that my comments pertain to\u00a0healthy\u00a0relationships and not abusive ones where a sub has abdicated all personal responsibility and is really more of a parasite or ones where the Dom\/Master is really just looking for a punching bag whether physically or emotionally. I don't believe those are true D\/s-M\/s relationships.\n\nHailing from Washington, D.C.,\u00a0Elene Sallinger\u00a0first caught the writing bug in 2004 after writing and illustrating sev...

        "text":"Mischif no Snark: Good-ol\u2019 Sperm Dick\n\nFor those of you who were hoping for a new Onii-Chan Theatre, it must suck to be you right now. For everyone else, welcome back to another installment of Mischif no Snark! I know I said I would change the name, but then I got to thinking, and I realized that slight as it may be, there\u2019s still some brand equity in the name, and it would be foolish of me to just discard it. And I can\u2019t think up witty titles to save my life. Anyway, I know it\u2019s been a while, which is why I\u2019m coming back with a three-fer of some of the most awfulsome doujins I\u2019ve seen yet. Now, ON TO THE SNARK:\n\nWe begin with The Love Is Forbidden Swimming Club, where we find the protagonist getting chewed out by the swim club captain for a girl having the audacity to step out of the kitchen and ask him out. The captain decides that the best way to rectify this situation is to give him a blowjob. Neither I nor the protagonist are entirely sure what this is supposed to accomplish, but he\u2019s getting his dick sucked so I don\u2019t really think he cares.\n\nShe makes him cum and swallows like a champ, and he squeezes her clit till she comes in reciprocation. He flips her over and jams it in, and when he asks if he can come inside her she gives the okay because this time is \u201cspecial\u201d.\n\nFuck noises ensue and we are treated to a cumshot that looks like a water balloon being filled with expired milk.\n\nHe pulls out and starts fingerblasting her, which makes his fingers look like they\u2019re covered in wallpaper paste:\n\nAnd we find out that this apparently turns him on, as he gets in her for the next round. More fuck noises follow, and we find out that he has a name for fucking a chick after giving her a creampie:\n\nApparently sperm-dick becomes her new word-of-the-day, as it\u2019s damn near the only thing she talks about until the end.\n\nHe blows another load, and afterwards finally decides to reject the random female\u2019s advances. Who knew all it took was to be fucked by one girl to not care about another? Anyway, she suggests that if he just has to have a girlfriend, she can step up for the position. But she forgot, love is forbidden in the swimming club.\n\nRight, that\u2019s one load down, on to the next! Up now is Proper Exchange!!, a strange doujin that begins strangely enough with a female protagonist, Makoto. She keeps trying to get a look at the lead male Yuuki\u2019s phone, but he won\u2019t let her. She keeps harassing him to let her look at the phone until he slips and falls down some stairs and brings her with him. True gentleman. He breaks his phone on the way down, which apparently had a 100,000-volt battery because they both get zapped with a couple bolts of lightning.\n\nThey pull themselves together afterwards, but something\u2019s different:\n\n\nThey retire to one of their rooms, where Yuuki-now-in-Makoto\u2019s-body is flipping out, but Makoto-now-in-Yuuki\u2019s-body is strangely nonchalant about the whole matter.\n\nI\u2019m not too surprised about that, if you have a dick you seem to be golden in Japan. In addition, it is also at this juncture that we find pretty much everyone in Japan\u2019s a bit of a rapist, but you apparently need a dick to want to do something about it.\n\nMakoto-now-Yuuki decides to tease Yuuki-now-Makoto (henceforth referred to as male and female, respectively), and basically comes to the conclusion that fucking will make everything better. Why am I not surprised.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t be surprised that she decides to go along with it either, since apparently she\u2019s an emo little bitch. Some groping, nipple-tweaking and ass-grabbing ensues, followed by a finger-bang for good measure. She gets all \u201care you gonna have sex with me\u201d girly on him, and he jams it in in reply. He apparently got the hang of those balls pretty quick.\n\nHe tells her he\u2019ll go slow, but he doesn\u2019t know how long that\u2019ll last since he\u2019s a guy now. Wow, he\u2019s more of a guy than he thinks. She comes ahead of him, but apparently they\u2019re still stuck in each other\u2019s bodies. She comes to the conclusion that they weren\u2019t fucking hard enough, and gets on top for round two. More fuck noises ensue, and they both come with the same result. In the end, he decides it\u2019s fine to be stuck like this, since she now looks so super-cute. And there\u2019s the fact that he has a dick now, that\u2019s a plus.\n\nAnd finally we come to Yamauchi-San To Yamauchi-Kun, a manga whose name made me originally think it was incest but was apparently just coincidental. We open with the woman Eriko being trounced in the rankings yet again by her rival Takayuki. He\u2019s apparently a prodigy or some shit, but she thinks he has some sort of secret that by God she will discover. After asking to study together in the most harmful way possible after the tests have ended\n\n\u2026when he finally agrees and they\u2019re in his room she goes snooping around as he steps out to get more tea. And of course, like she would if she snooped in any boy\u2019s room, she managed to find his porn.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think she expected to find porn with her face on it.\n\nHe comes back in the room, they turn into rabbids, and of course in the ensuing struggle they somehow manage to fall on the bed.\n\nHe declares his undying love for her in the most annoying and slightly creepy way he can, and whips her tits out.\n\nWe find out that as smart as he is he can easily mistake \u201cfuck-me eyes\u201d for \u201cmurder eyes\u201d\u2026\n\n\u2026and when she tries to get away from him, he rides her like a horse and forces her to agree to stop being \u201ctsun\u201d and start being \u201cdere\u201d. She agrees, and he commits what is not only the cardinal sin of essentially raping someone, but of dealing with women in general.\n\nYou do not EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER let a woman with eyes like that have access to any body part you wish to retain ownership of. EVER. EVER. He may be book smart but he must\u2019ve failed the shit out of Man School, or not even have shown up because that\u2019s like the first lesson.\n\nAmazingly she doesn\u2019t immediately bite his dick off, but gives him a handjob that is so boring he starts to fall asleep. Of course not making him come now would be dishonoring her family, so she switches to a blowjob that in contrast is apparently so good he has to hold her head down to make her swallow his baby batter. To apologize for humping her face 30 seconds ago he fingers her until she comes and just jams it in, again a bit surpring since she was a virgin as well and she doesn\u2019t seem to be in any pain. Fuck noises are made, and a creampie is baked for everyone to enjoy. Mmmm.\n\nIn the end he manages to convince her to come over every day to \u201cstudy\u201d, and at the end of the final exams she\u2019s dropped from second right behind Takayuki to 44th. He tells her if she undergoes \u201cspecial training\u201d she\u2019ll rise back to second place behind him, and\u2026she doesn\u2019t take it well.\n\nAnd so we wrap up my triumphant return to Mischif no Snark!

I am working on another fap roulette, but we'll see when it's done.\n\nThis is the first thing I've specifically created for this blog, so enjoy! Note: I do not condone illegally feeding hormone replacement drugs to other people (...much).\n\nAlso, not to be a comment whore (maybe a different kind of whore...), but feel free to leave a reaction or a comment. Be as critical or demanding as you like; it encourages me not to hoard my creations and will probably improve the quality of material here. Plus you'll be more likely to get topics you enjoy - you dirty slut.\n\nOf course, if you're just here to fap try not to waste a drop :D",

        "text":"What is Going to a Brothel Like?\n\nA kid in a candy shop\n\nMany of you have probably never visited a brothel and are curious what it is like. Well let me start by saying it is like being a kid in a candy shop. The feeling of excitement and joy you experience is like nothing else. First things first, if it\u2019s your first time going to a brothel, I\u2019d strongly suggest you take a viagra pill one hour before going. That way if you feel a bit nervous, it won\u2019t affect your erection. Second point is, I would strongly recommend you to go with a guy who has already been there, otherwise if it\u2019s your first time, they will most likely overcharge you. An experienced guy can negotiate good prices for you.\n\nSo you walk in, and there will be like 5 or 10 girls standing there. YOU get to decide which woman you want to fuck. That\u2019s the literal opposite of western feminist culture, where the WOMAN does all the choosing. So you get to choose which woman sexually arouses you the most, and then you pay her the money. Generally it should be like 30 to 40 dollars for 30 minutes. That is the going rate for brothels in Europe, Asia, South America, and so on.\n\nThen you and her go into one of the private rooms, and she\u2019ll give you a blowjob, and then you\u2019ll put on the condom and get on top of her and bang her hard. Can you imagine banging a hot woman for only 30 dollars? In America, you would NEVER find that kind of deal. America is the most sexually repressed country on earth.",

Ultimate Verdict: Aside from a distracting music track inside the film I watched, the procedure on I Love Thai Pussy was great. They prepare a simple smoothie, much such as the one I should have had for breakfast instead of chocolate cupcakes, and then have it gently poured into their rear end, exclusively to squirt it out again.\nStatus OK.",
