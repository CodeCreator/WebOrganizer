It's called the Cowpoke (sort of like the reverse cowgirl position).\n\nThe position, which is intended to give maximum comfort and pleasure for the woman, has the woman on top \u2013 and the man on the bottom \u2013 with his legsup.\n\nBecause the man is in a legs-up\/submissive position, some men are not comfortable getting in this position.\n\nWhat do you think ladies, would you try this with your man??\n\nThe 'Reverse Cowgirl' position",

The bus was crowded as usual. I was a bit angry with the way things had turned out that day and thinking about a million ways to torture those shitheads when\u2026\u2026..A boy about my age..he was standing in front of me\u2026started vomitting\u2026he suddenly fell to the floor..\nAnd by God..not a single heartless shit eating trash talking crap filled worthless asshole came to his aid.. As I bent down by his side, took him by the hand and held his head up from the vomit on which it was resting, I looked around and got damn angry. Not even the women had a kind word for him. In fact those whores got up from the seats, covered their noses with their sarees and moved away..(well..fuk u..u whores with rotten hair ridden cunts\u2026his vomit probably smells better than ur 100 foot ass and a lot better than ur shit filled hearts.) And on top of all this, one guy started scoldin the poor boy.

I made the boy sit there and asked him what his problem was. He told me that he\u2019d gone to work pretty early in the morning and hadn\u2019t eaten since then. He told me that he was fine and he\u2019d grab a meal as soon as he got home. His stop came.. I asked him if he needed any money or whether I should get down along with him and take him home.. He graciously refused and said he\u2019d do ok. He got up and just stumbled along..Hope he made it home..\n\nWhat\u2019s the whole damn world comin to??? X-(",

        "text":"High Growth W4W Sugar Sisters & Affairs\n\nMore Women are Being Curious\n\nThere has been this growing sub community in the affair & sugar world. For those of you interested in the sugar bowl, i.e. those seeking sugar daddies \/ sugar babies \/ sugar mommas, you have this growing community of sugar sisters. In a sense, its a growing number of women looking to connect with women in the sugar bowl. The term sugar sisters allows women new and old to the sugar world to connect in a way without the drama. Essentially, it provides an outlet for women (single and married) to discuss all aspects of the sugar world in a very discreet way. A growing percentage of these women are forming friendships that is so discreet that it\u2019s not spoken about with their closest friends. Some go the intimate route, but most provide that outlet that women can\u2019t find through their friends or lovers\n\nAnother high growth sub community are married women looking to discuss what\u2019s missing in their life with other like minded women. Some are coined the term lesbians, but many are simply looking for an emotional and sexual outlet that does NOT involve men. Part exploration, but finding that ultimate connection that allows the emotional & sexual connection is key.\n\nI\u2019ve always believed these two sub communities are ones that the media will never cover. The media doesn\u2019t understand \u00a0the sugar bowl and they certainly don\u2019t understand affairs \u2013 other than the headlines that are full of eyeballs and page views. When it comes down to it, understanding the female point of view is lost. Sure, you\u2019ll see interviews of women in the midst of an affair (whether they are cheating or being cheated on), but you\u2019ll never see a story where a married woman is having some sort of affair \/ connection with a woman outside of the marriage.\n\nI\u2019m seeing this first hand in real life through close and distant friends, in one way shape or form. So I know it exists & experimented myself. There\u2019s just something about the topic that is incredibly taboo for the public to discuss. Instead of trying to fight it, I\u2019m ok with this topic being close knit. If anything, it makes me want to work harder to build a community of women that are looking for these sort of encounters. It doesn\u2019t need to be this mainstream \/ trendy topic that gets the attention of Buzzfeed. At the end of the day, it needs to be a private community of women that want to engage with similar like minded women.\n\nHigh Growth W4W Sugar Sisters & Affairs\nArticle Name\nHigh Growth W4W Sugar Sisters & Affairs\nWomen seeking sugar sisters and affairs with like minded women are on the rise, but finding these communities can be tough.\nPublisher Name\nDiscreet Network\nPublisher Logo",

I have dated a lot of hot girls all over the places, but I can wait to get back to London. The girls back home in Dubai are okay, but they are not as exciting as the girls in London. As a matter of fact, I would say that no hot babes around the world can beat the way I feel about London escorts. They are my little pearls and girls that I simple can\u2019t get enough of.\n\ndelights of London\ndelights of London\n\nWe do have escorts in Dubai as well, but coming back to London date hot babes like https:\/\/cityofeve.com\/, is just so much better. I love every minute the hot babes of London make me feel. The girls back in Dubai are not as liberated or as much fun to be with. It is a joy to come back to the UK and fill my life with the sexy companionship of delightful escorts. I have always been able to enjoy the best of female company, but the girls that I have met in London have been without exception. They have never failed to please or to stimulate parts of my imagination.\n\nI couldn\u2019t really tell you when I became hooked on dating London escorts. It was not that sort of thing that happened straight away. Rather it seemed to have been a more gradual process until I suddenly realized that they were the only girls for me. I was dating other escorts around London at the time, but one day something just clicked. Every date I have had since that day have been wonderful, and I will never give up on my London girls. They are simply the best of the best.\n\nThe truth is that there are so many escorts agencies in London, that it can be difficult to know which agency to choose from. I love all of the dates that I have had, but I do think that London escorts stand out. The services are on par with many of the top agencies in places like Mayfair and Knightsbridge. But, like I keep saying to my friends, I think that all of the girls that I have met in London go that extra mile. London escorts are that little special and I am pretty sure that I am not the only gent who feels that way.\n\nDating escorts in London almost seems to be an acceptable practice now, and I know that so many gents do it on a regular basis. It is true that you can have a lot of adult fun in London in many different ways. Dating London escorts is only one way of having fun, but you can also enjoy things like lap dancing clubs and pole dancing. I love all of the fun adult things that you can do in London, and the way London society is so open about it. It makes such a change from being in Dubai.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"Your Partner\u2019s Role in Effective Butt Plug Use\n\nThe external sphincter of the anus is a ring structure consisting of striated muscles surrounding the anal canal. One of the two sphincters of the anus. It is arbitrary, that is, it can be controlled by consciousness. The internal sphincter of the anus, in contrast to the external, consists of smooth muscle tissue and is involuntary. The external sphincter of the anus has a length of 8 to 10 cm, and in its widest part, opposite the anus, is about 2.5 cm thick. The sphincter\u2019s striated muscles are a continuation of the pubis-rectus muscle.\n\n  \u2022 The muscular complex of the external sphincter of the anus is divided into three layers: the subcutaneous portion, which is an annular musculature; the surface part, which is an elliptical muscle attached to the tailbone; deep part closely related to pubic rectus muscle.\n  \u2022 The muscle fibers of the external sphincter of the anus encircle the lower part of the internal sphincter of the anus. Although the sphincters are in contact with each other, there is a clearly defined border between them. You will need to know how to deal with stuck buttplug? What to do??\n\nAnd actually what are we? The anus is generally one of the brightest and strongest erogenous zones of a woman, and with the right approach, the satisfaction with anal games can be many times higher than even from clitoral stimulation. Men in the same way will receive extraordinary pleasure and health benefits from anal sex. The muscles of the external and internal sphincter are very strong, it functions very simply, the rectal reflex leads to the compression of the muscles of the external sphincter of the anus. To reduce pain or discomfort during anal sex it is necessary:\n\n  \u2022 To reduce the conscious compression of muscles so that the consciousness calms down and allows you to open the external sphincter (for calm and pleasant anal sex just do an enema)\n  \u2022 To relax the rings of the internal sphincter, be sure to use a lubricant with a relaxing effect, which are sold in sex shops, sex shops.\n\nHow to do an enema?\n\nYou will need only 0.5 liters of warm boiled water. Tip enemas (special kits for intimate hygiene are sold in sex shops and sex shops) lubricate baby cream. Choose the most comfortable posture and slowly insert the tip to eight or ten centimeters. All \u2013 now you have no reason to worry that anal sex will be dirty and unpleasant.\n\nRead the article about Enema Administration: Basics.\n\nHow to enter a member or toys in the anus?\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to choose the correct position in which the penetration is the most painless: for example, it can be a pose on the left side, and the legs are tucked in to the tummy. Breathing also helps relieve soreness \u2013 breathe deeply with the tummy. Relaxation of the sphincter: shrunk \u2013 unclenched, with a frequency of several seconds. And, of course, more anal lubricant. Here are the basic principles of successful anal sex. \u201c\n\nRecommendations from the life: before you let a member of your partner into yourself, practice the muscles of the anus with anal toys. Let\u2019s discuss the feelings that they will give:\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most common \u2013 anal plugs (plugs), there are a great many anal plugs, in a large assortment presented in sex shops and sex shops of Yaroslavl, as a rule, they are all divided into plugs with vibration and without it, with the effect of expansion, plugs come in different diameters and forms made of hypoallergenic materials, safe and even glamorous) Acquire traffic jams only in sex shops and sex shops of Yaroslavl, do not experiment with foreign objects!\n\n  \u2022 Butt plug creates a feeling of fullness in the anus and has a certain effect on the sensitive areas, allowing you to achieve a more saturated orgasm. Both women and men can use anal plug.\n  \u2022 Applying a plug to expand and relax the anus will help solve the problem of comfortable penetration during anal sex. It is also possible to use the anal plug to constrict the vagina, for example, in the case of muscle weakness in women after childbirth. Curved plugs provide high-quality prostate massage.\n  \u2022 Options for using this sex toy are very diverse. Someone prefers to use the anal plug only during sex, someone walks with her around the house, and someone expands the range of sexual sensations, going out with a plug in the anus on the street.\n  \u2022 If before this your anus did not have dating with sex toys, then it is better to start with a small traffic jam. For comfortable and painless penetration during the first anal practice, it is better to choose a product made of soft silicone or latex.\n\nBefore using the anal plug, you must maximally relax the anus. This can be done by a partner with the help of stroking and caressing the tongue. It is worth remembering about high-quality moisturizing, because the anus does not emit a natural lubricant. Therefore, the cork must be lubricated in sufficient quantities with a water-based lubricant. .\n\nIntroducing a cork should be smooth, neat and gradual, controlling sensations. It is necessary to avoid sudden movements and the introduction of the tube at once for the entire length. Butt plugs are not designed to make progressive movements, like a dildo. The toy is recommended to be placed in the anus and enjoy the feeling of completeness. If the butt plug is used to expand the anus before anal sex, then you needs to hold it for a while, get used to the feeling of having an object inside. It is also possible to use the anal plug with vaginal contact. Finding a stopper in the anus while simultaneously inserting the penis into the vagina will enhance sexual sensations.\n\nAnother not less popular\n\nAnal balls\n\nThe ability to use anal chains and balls was considered one of the most important for priestesses of love in eastern countries. With the help of these amazing intimate toys, they brought their partners to indescribable delights, gave joy and opened new facets of sensuality. At the same time, they also received incredible pleasure from the use of these accessories, which immensely pleased their lovers. Today, every woman who wishes can learn this art.\n\nAnal balls are specially created for very gentle and pleasant caresses of anus. They are first placed inside the body, and then carefully removed outside. The process does not require haste, very sensual and very exciting. Such affection is difficult to compare with the vaginal and the feeling they often surpass them.\n\nAnal balls?\n\nIn part, this may seem crazy, but these special balls are designed just to feel the pleasant sensations that appear when your muscles shrink around a number of small round beads. This is especially nice during orgasm. If you have not tried this sex toy, do not waste time \u2013 you should definitely get to know the joys of anal games and diversify your sex life.\n\nPicture Anal balls (chain) \u2013A series of small round beads, which are evenly spaced along the cord. Some beads are the same in size, while others gradually increase in diameter. They can be of all colors and sizes, on a rigid or flexible coupling, so that everyone can choose a toy to their liking, in our sex shop. There are even anal balls with a built-in vibrator, which will further excite you from the inside.\n\nExploring BDSM Positions with Sex Toys\n\nYou are fascinated by the BDSM practices of the hard sex of domination and obedience, but do not know how to start? First of all, you have to admit yourself that it incites the thought of this type of sex and then confess to your partner your hidden sexual desires. But, to put them into practice, you have to make sure that everything happens in complete safety. Here\u2019s how a beginner can do in the hard sex secrets with different types of anal toys!\n\nSearch the BDSM domain\n\nAn essential first step in initiating the BDSM is prior information. Do not get yourself into a job you know nothing about. Scout! Read about the rough sex practices, the methods used, the \u201cutensils\u201d used, the benefits, the dangers, and the testimonials of those who practice it. Before you get along the way of hard sex, it\u2019s good to know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nIt also takes into account that there are two sides of the BDSM. The partners are either the ones who dominate the sex game, or those who are left behind. Sometimes I can do it in turn, depending on sexual preferences. At this point, ask yourself: Am I willing to be tied up with a scarf? Am I willing to be bound to bed? Am I willing to get my boyfriend a neck strap? Do I have enough strength to \u201cwhip\u201d my beloved belt while having sex? Only after answering these questions is it advisable to follow the next steps.\n\nIf you have seen 50 shades of Grey, that is just a small part of real BDSM. Read this article to know more!\n\nYou need a trusted partner\n\nTough sex does not work with anyone. Man or woman, any man who ventures in this way must have confidence in his or her sexual partner. You cannot squeeze someone with the whip on your back without knowing you will not react negatively.\n\nMoreover, partners need to know the limit of pain, and this is gradually obtained by the actual practice, making small steps from one method to another. Do not tie the strap to a woman\u2019s neck directly without having tried it first with a soft scarf, not a very tight neck! For all this, you need a partner to talk openly about what you want and what to do with you.\n\nMake a list of \u201cyes, no, maybe\u201d\n\nTo make sure that you and your partner are on the same wavelength, conceive together a list of what you are willing to do together, what you do not want to try at all with what you want to try, but you are not sure it will hold. It is only when all of them are listed that you begin to know your own limits, but especially the limits of your partner. Together, you do not want to wake up for shouting \u201cStop!\u201d Fixed in the middle of the game, after your partner tried something that he did not know you did not like.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve created the list, start experimenting. ...

        "text":"Pornography for Couples by Violet Blue\n\nAs someone who has been reviewing porn for a long time, it\u2019s amusing to watch the SoCal porn industry begin to change its tune about porn made \u201cfor couples\u201d. Until recently, the at-large attitude of the industry for fare directed at heterosexual couples who want to watch films together has been, frankly, insulting. Still, even in the industry magazines you\u2019ll hear filmmakers and writers referring to couples\u2019 fare as though it were lighter, weaker, for wussies. Or, more appropriately, for pussies.\n\nThat\u2019s because it is. Made for the owners of pussies \u2014 women \u2014 and also for guys who are watching it with them. I don\u2019t think the assumption on the part of the porn industry is that the guys are weaker for wanting to watch it with their gals, I think that they believe couples\u2019 tastes to be weaker and need to be more watered-down because of the addition of a woman to the viewership.\n\nHow insulting.\n\nThese assumptions miss the mark entirely. Women get off watching explicit imagery just as much as their male counterparts. It doesn\u2019t need to be any less powerful \u2014 or dirty \u2014 to do the job. But it does need to be different in one concrete way, different than the stuff that\u2019s been churned out for the masses of male viewers: it needs to be believable. If you bother with a plot, make it a real one. And make the sex hot, real, with women really getting off, and people who genuinely want to have intense, no-holds-barred passionate sex with each other. And this isn\u2019t to say that men don\u2019t want these things in their porn \u2014 they do. They\u2019ve just had to settle for less.\n\nCouples have been buying and watching porn at least since the Cannes and big-screen debut of Deep Throat in 1972. So why has this market been largely ignored? Good question \u2014 and the skyrocketing sales of porn purchased and watched by couples only underscores confusion around the issue. I can only guess that the reasons are similar to the sexist sentiments from the industry echoed above, but I am just as equally baffled by the situation as I am excited to see better films being made \u2014 films that are made by people who realize that they\u2019re making films. And when I say excited, well, you know what I mean.\n\nCertain directors have set a delicious pace for high-quality porn that is great for couples to watch together. Films by Tristan Taormino (like her Chemistry series) and Eon McKai always top my list for couples to watch together, but especially when one of you is new to porn. Before you watch an adult movie for the first time, read the article, \u201cI Was a Porn Virgin: A First-Timer\u2019s Guide to Watching Porn.\u201d Candida Royalle\u2018s films have high production values \u2014 meaning good writing, excellent cinematography, great acting and hot sex. She brings a unique edge to porn with her strong emphasis on woman-centered sexual encounters and her own personal experience as a former actress from porn\u2019s golden age. Her films are complete films, with narrative and girl-powered storyline, sometimes plot-driven and sometimes character-driven.\n\nThe \u201cclassics\u201d (pre-1980) are also a great place to find porn that doesn\u2019t play by the industry\u2019s current standards of surgical enhancements, medical-grade closeups, or going-through-the-motions sex. But then again, there\u2019s all the hair, and the big earrings and the mustaches. Still, films from porn\u2019s golden age have a refreshing sense of fun about them, are filmed well (for low budget movies), and were written with a wry intelligence difficult to find even in modern mainstream movies. Two great examples with really great sex are The Opening of Misty Beethoven and Outlaw Ladies. Misty Beethoven is a smart and funny take on My Fair Lady, in which an author working on a novel about a reluctant prostitute finds one in a Paris brothel and, with the help of his decadent friends, educates her in the arts of sexual passion and enthusiasm. The film culminates in a fantastic male anal penetration scene with two women \u2014 a \u201clove sandwich.\u201d Outlaw Ladies gets a five-star rating in every one of my categories, following the exploits of sexually rapacious housewives who make every man crossing their path into their own personal sex toy. This film is also infamous for showing Veronica Hart\u2019s first anal penetration (ever!) \u2014 the scene is riveting, to say the least.\n\nDon\u2019t care about plot? Watch scenes from John Leslie\u2019s Voyeur films. They have no plot, just the premise that the viewer (camera) is the voyeur, watching through windows, sneaking into houses, or watching in rearview mirrors. Sometimes Leslie breaks the spell by directing during the action, but the sex is so incendiary (and Leslie recognizes that a starlet\u2019s authentic orgasmic shudders are just as arousing as an in-out close-up) that you won\u2019t care. The cinematography is fantastic, the lighting and sound are all natural, and so are all the actors \u2014 lots of beautiful women and men, all free of surgical enhancement. There\u2019s lots of hot sex, never a dull moment in a Leslie film. My pick to get you started is Voyeur 13.\n\nEnjoy watching porn with your sweetie \u2014 it\u2019s a terrific sex toy. But I\u2019ll bet that once you put the tape in, you won\u2019t be watching the screen for long. Porn comes in many forms, and the definition lies in the eye of the beholder. Finding good adult fare is tough, and a satisfying experience can only happen when you know what you\u2019re looking for. Read more about how to find what you both want to see in my book, The Smart Girl\u2019s Guide to Porn (it\u2019s not just for girls, after all).",

        "text":"Wednesday, May 20, 2009\n\n\nLately I have found that I bristle at the words 'submissive' and 'submission'. I think the reason they get to me is because I find them totally inadequate to describe the process that I am going through as a slave. 'Surrender' is a beautiful word. It holds the idea of following one's Master so completely that there isn't a thought about following his direction. His will and one's action follow as effortlessly as a breath in and a breath out. The fact that he wills something almost in itself creates one's obedience because you only have to know what he wants for you to obey. 'Submission' holds the implication that one thought about whether or not she should follow a command and that there was some possibility, however small, of it not being followed. It implies that there was a choice on one's part as to whether or not she would obey. It is the breath taken in with the idea that it might never be released.\n\nTuesday, May 19, 2009\n\n\nCross-posted from a Fetlife Group...\n\nI know how annoying labels and definitions are, but after railing against them for years I have discovered that they can actually be helpful because it means that everybody is on the same page when discussion things.\n\nI'm not suggesting that we adopt definitions for terms for this group, but after posting in more than a couple of threads and being told things like 'that isn't what a babygirl is!' I thought that I might take the time to explain MY definitions of certain labels used in the BDSM and D\/s realm.\n\nOnce again, to make things clear... these are my definitions and I am not proposing that they be held by the group.\n\nBDSM - Bondage, Discipline, Sadism and Masochism.\u00a0I don't agree that the DS in the center of the acronym stands for Dominant and submissive as well as sadism and masochism.\n\n\nT\/b - Top and bottom.\u00a0I believe that this is a relationship that is based on kink play alone. There is no aspect of Dominance and submission outside of the scene. I don't think that this makes a Top and bottom any 'less' than a D\/s or M\/s scenario, it just makes it different. And there is nothing wrong with knowing exactly what you want and going after that with someone compatible. The drama starts when people who are T\/b feel like they have to be\u00a0more\u00a0to be accepted into the kink society. I believe that it is a good thing for both a Top and bottom to have soft limits, hard limits and safe-words, all of which to have been explained to the other party before any sort of interaction takes place.\n\n\nD\/s - Dominance and submission.\u00a0I believe that the Dominant actually holds a position over the submissive and that she is not 'his equal who just has a different job.' I believe that the submissive begs the Dominant for the opportunity to submit to him, and that being a submissive she has the rights afforded to any human being - including the right to disagree or to say 'no', although I can't imagine that someone truly interested in submitting would use that word easily and would first have put all of her effort and energy into finding out how to turn it into a 'yes'. I believe that it is fair for a submissive to have a few limits, but that she should be prepared for these to be stretched and possibly broken by her Dominant. Some submissives like the feeling of safety that a safe-word provides, personally I think that the Dominant should know his submissive well enough to not need one.\n\n\nM\/s - Master and slave.\u00a0I believe that this is the next step deeper into the lifestyle. Once again, M\/s isn't\u00a0better\u00a0than D\/s or T\/b, it is just different. I believe that a Master needs a certain amount of training and mentoring to build an understanding of the true tenants of D\/s and the self-discipline to be able to follow and honour these. I believe that a true Master does\u00a0submit, he submits to the ideal of D\/s and does so with an open and vulnerable heart ready to be taught. I believe that his slave has no rights aside from those gracefully handed her by her Master, that she doesn't have the rights afforded to a human being because she is no longer one now that she has become a slave. I believe that she becomes property and like any sort of property it is up to the owner as to whether she will be cherished and used well or misused, broken and thrown away.\u00a0I believe that this is the danger of being a slave and that if more people understood this there would be a lot fewer with the word 'slave' marked on their profile.\u00a0I believe that it is the Master's prerogative to keep his slave in whatever way he sees fit, whether it is tied to the bedpost and sleeping on a cold hardwood floor, or being allowed to curl up by his feet on a cushion while he reads. And I believe that she has no place to complain and no place to deny him anything. I do not believe that a slave should have any limits set other than those given her by her Master.\n\n\nNow, this is where things get controversial...\n\nDD\/bg - DaddyDom and babygirl.\u00a0I believe that DaddyDom and babygirl is a sacred archetype that exists in the kink world. I think that it is primal and dates back to a prehistoric era where when a female was born into a family group she would have to endear herself to the Father in that group in order to receive the care and protection that she needed. Male children were useful, they would grow up to be hunters and protectors, female children were another mouth to feed, and all that they would grow up to be is another womb to fill - and it has long since been recognised by science that there is a primal push for the male of the species to propagate as much of his seed as possible, so as she became of age there was another belly to fill with the child of the groups lead figure (the Father) and the child had been trying to endear herself to him so that she would receive protection and food when it was scarce.\n\nI believe that the Daddydom offers safety to his babygirl in a way that Dominants and Masters do not - that he offers her the room to be herself, to be that babygirl without fear of reprise. This is not to say that he offers her space to be a brat, and bratting is something that is entirely different. A Daddy offers interest when his girl shows him a picture that she has drawn and a lap to curl up into when she is sleepy and just wants to be held. He offers her the opportunity to discover and enjoy a childhood that she may not have never experienced. I also believe that being a babygirl is a highly submissive role.\n\n\nThe other aspect to DD\/bg to consider is that while it is something we act out\u00a0(I do not condone incest or sexual contact with underage people), in the archetype of the relationship a bg was truly owned by her Daddy - to such an extent that not only was she born for him, but she was born\u00a0from\u00a0him - she truly belongs to him.\n\n\nD\/lg - Daddy and little girl.\u00a0This is where a lot of the issues within the misunderstandings of my posts have lain over the last couple of days. There is avast\u00a0difference between a DaddyDom\/babygirl relationship and a Daddy\/little girl. D\/lg is more a level of play that is directed by the little girl. There have been posts in response to things that I've said on threads here that have pointed out to me that just because someone is a little girl it doesn't mean that she is a submissive - and I totally agree (although, I would go as far as pointing out that these posts talking about little girls and whether they were submissive were posted in the DaddyDom and babygirl group on\n\n\nAs far as I can see, the D\/lg dynamic has a large brattiness factor to it, it involves the pouting and stamping of feet when she doesn't get her way, the begging and playing nicely to Daddy so that he will give into what she wants and other 'Princess' like behaviours. I am not condemning this dynamic, if this is what does it for you, and you have found a partner that shares your fantasies and preferences then more power to you. However, I do ask that you remember that you are a little girl, and not a babygirl... and I will show the same respect by remembering that I am a babygirl and not a little girl.\n\nI think that safe words are a good thing to have in a D\/lg scenario, and that hard and soft limits should be set, and I have found when talking to little girls that it tends to be them who set the limits and the Daddies who follow them.\n\n\nThere was SO much more that I wanted to write about... like my ideas on the definitions of discipline and my views on submission 'as a gift'... perhaps at another time in another thread.\n\nIf anyone has actually sat down and read through all of my ramblings - thank you.\n\nWednesday, May 13, 2009\n\n\nI think that it is an amazing thing to be able to know in yourself that nothing other than your Master's will is important. The ability to not only serve through action, but to be right-minded. To be totally content to wait upon his pleasure.I've been thinking about humility as well, and working through what it is in real terms.\n\nI think that the idea of a submissive being worthless.. of making no claims on herself or her own time is vital. And it is through this knowledge that she is worthless, that she is nothing.. that she becomes precious to him. Not because she deserves it or has earnt it, but because he wishes to hold her precious. It is simply his choosing to find pleasure in her that gives her the worth that she has.\n\nIn the same way that money is just paper and ink until we subscribe a worth to it, a submissive is worthless until she is found precious by her Master choosing to take pleasure in her. And in that she achieves the reason for her existence... she is of service to him... because he has chosen for it to be like this, not because she has done anything.\n\nI have no precious time at all to spend, Nor services to do, till you require.\n\n\nHe speaks to me\u00a0\nin words and silences\u00a0\nthat take me places\u00a0\nI have never imagined.\u00a0\n\nPlaces where I am happy\u00a0\nand carefree. \u00a0 Places where\u00a0\nI respond to his words\u00a0\nwithout thought and without need. \u00a0...

        "text":"ORGASMIC: passport to the big\u00a0O\n\nJan 28 11, The Booksmith\n\n(Maureen Blennerhassett)\n\nWho better to spend a Friday evening with than the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of women\u2019s erotica? Sounds orgasmic, right?\n\nWell, dear hedonists, that\u2019s exactly the company I was in on January 28. Erotic editor extraordinaire\u00a0Rachel Kramer Bussel hosted a reading from Orgasmic: Erotica for Women at the Booksmith. It felt dirty and forbidden to be listening among the stacks of children\u2019s nonfiction, self-help, and cookbooks, to steamy stories about role-playing, big black dildos, and bondage fetishes. Despite the audience giggles, the excerpts that were shared exceeded the realm of clit-lit masturbation fodder.\n\nOrgasmic is a compilation of almost every kinky insight into the female orgasm. The authors use humor, sensuous imagery, poetic prose, Shakespearean dialogue and even technical science lingo. Their objects of desire range from a hammer to Charlie Sheen. They are speaking to you: the unfaithful married man, the gender queer with dick envy, the desperate housewife looking for marital rejuvenation. You: the voyeur and indulger of pleasure.\n\nSusie Hara started the night off with \u201cFixing the Pipes,\u201d (anthologized in Orgasmic). It\u2019s a story about Bobbie and Scott\u2014a tired marriage clich\u00e9 until Bobbie meets Rick, a hammer wielding plumber sent to fix Bobbie\u2019s pipes.\n\n[NOTE: These videos are for devirginized ears only!]\n\nDonna George prefaces her Orgasmic contribution with an article that the narrator reads, entitled, \u201cThe Sexercise Prescription: A Stronger, Secret You in Six Weeks.\u201d This story is perhaps the hottest, most sensuous, and may I add\u2014accurate\u2014description of a female orgasm that I\u2019ve heard!\n\nViolet Blue (nonfiction sex writer and sexpert who has been featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show \u2026 and to leave it at that is really selling her short) engaged the crowd with a hilarious account of a tattooed goth chick named Ducky who reads up on BDSM and performs it on her gay BFF Oscar, an aspiring leather boy. \u201cThe Fugly Ducky,\u201d written by \u00a0Thomas Roche, had everyone laughing along with Ducky\u2019s socially unacceptable misadventures.\n\nRachel Kramer Bussel travelled through the snow from New York City to regale the hungry audience with \u201cEspionage,\u201d dedicated to anyone who has fallen for someone unavailable. She speaks in the voice of a spy, infiltrating the homes and hotel rooms of the married, the serial \u201cother woman,\u201d desperate and in denial. The two passages Bussel reads are hauntingly poetic and secretly sexy. In one scene, the lovers are in a closet. She remembers that the human heart is the size of a human fist and wonders, as he is fisting her, if she is receiving a part of his heart.\u00a0Hmmm, listen for yourself!\n\nTo finish it off, Dusty Horn gave us \u201cShare\u201d (included in Orgasmic). It\u2019s a fantastic take on queer sex and the importance of the G-Spot. She introspectively shared a scene in which the narrator uses a strap-on to \u201cmanifest her love\u201d for her partner. Horn gets into the psyche of a 21st century queer alpha female easily and beautifully. The climax: \u201cYou are wailing a single note. And too bad I don\u2019t have perfect pitch or I would sing in that key.\u201d\n\nThese women can also be found in several female erotica anthologies like Best Women\u2019s Erotica, X: The Erotic Treasury, and Hot Women\u2019s Erotica.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"What is one thing you regret doing?\n\nThere are many regrets actually !\n\n1st :\n\nI was about to become a prostitute , yes you read it right !\n\nIt is about a year ago . The lust in me made me crave for sex as I am 20 and I have never been in relationships i.e I have been single and I am single now. And it is quite natural to have such feelings but It was different for me as I decided to have sex as soon as possible. I searched for girls on almost all dating , marriage and social site. Plus I don\u2019t wanted to pay for these sites so I joined only free sites . But it didn\u2019t work out at all. Then I started joining different dating groups from my city on facebook. After searching for days I finally found a guy(Mr.X) who could help me get laid though his contacts . Meanwhile I also found some good contacts on classified sites.I used to chat with all these contacts using whatsapp. What they all asked me in the first place were some of my details but Mr.X was the one who gave me some of the details of this business in return which actually built some trust in me for him and I thought that he is the one ! Plus he told me about my job in detail and salary structure. It was like a dream job for me to get paid for pleasuring myself. But he wanted me to register first and give medical reports to make sure that I am free from AIDS and STDs by paying some amount in the given bank account details. This way he earned more trust from me(As it looked genuine). For some days I stopped chatting to him(Mr.X). After a while I started receiving calls from him in order to get me registered but I used to give excuses to get some time to think about it as I don\u2019t wanted to waste my pocket money(Basically whole year savings) for nothing . Then one fine day my parents were out of town and I called him that I have deposited the money in your bank account . Then I messaged him on whatsapp regarding further procedures , he said I will get my first service within 4 hours . I was eagerly waiting for my first time that day doing all the research on internet on what should i be doing after 4 hours . 4 Hours passed and I messaged him again asking about my service . He replied \u201c Jald Milegi\u201d (Very Soon) . Maybe he broke his SIM after that. He deleted his facebook account too. Now I was searching on how can I get my money back from his bank account(Stupid me ). Well I still have that bank slip and I will keep it until I get my money back with interest. I will try to get a job in bank to get all the details associated with that account number.\n\nPS: I will write about other regrets some other day.\n\nSource :\n\nFacebook Comments",

Short\u00a0of wearing spurs I\u2019d love\u00a0any appliance that let me ride shotgun. With this in mind my\u00a0quest began through sex shops high and low for the perfect \u201cfacilitator.\u201d The Liberator Shapes looked like..pillows? The\u00a0Monkey Rocker\u00a0was a\u00a0love match but it\u2019s $800 price tag left it out of my clutches and they don\u2019t rent to own. The Sex Swing intrigued me but what I was\u00a0really looking for was something that would provide me with a \u201creverse cowgirl fuck-frenzy\u201d at a bargain\u00a0price. Then I\u00a0discovered Pipedream\u2019s Fetish Fantasy Sex Stool.\n\nCould it be?\n\n\n\"Sweet mystery of life I've finally found youuuuu..\"\n\nIt\u2019s as if\u00a0the\u00a0liner notes\u00a0were written especially for me.\n\n\u201cWeightless sex!\u201d Check.\n\n\u00a0\u201cLess thigh strain.\u201d Talk to me.\n\n\u201cBounce up and down!\u201d Yes Lord.\n\n\u201cOnly $75\u201d It is written.\n\nIn no time I was\u00a0ready to rock on down to Monkey Town. When I got it home I tore\u00a0into the box to find something inside not unlike your standard hunting stool. Indeed, its lightweight design and low profile made it seem ideal for hunting and capturing the wily trouser snake. The only difference was the nylon webbing had been replaced with two thick sheets of plastic that Pipedream calls \u201cTPR.\u201d You\u2019d think this substance\u00a0would have\u00a0some kind of elasticity or \u201cspring.\u201d You\u2019d think. (Hey Kids, this literary device is called \u201cforeshadowing.\u201d) My date was set to arrive in an hour so I decided to give it a test run.\n\n\nI plopped down on it enthusiastically\u00a0to realize my terrible mistake too late. There was no bounce. NO BOUNCE. The clear butt-flaps spread apart and I fell through it, arms flailing like a panicked turd unwilling to go to its final destination. Clearly a metaphor for my life.*\n\ngoodbye cruel world\n\nNot my fetish fantasy.\n\nWith legs akimbo and\u00a0the cold tile floor against my\u00a0ass\u00a0I contemplated\u00a0my\u00a0embarrassing reality. I couldn\u2019t get out.\u00a0What kind of tomfuckery was this? I decided this\u00a0had to\u00a0be some kind of practical joke. The president of Pipedream\u00a0was twiddling his waxed mustachio and cackling maniacally as he stared into a hidden webcam of me squatting miserably like\u00a0an\u00a0x-rated\u00a0hermit crab. Was this assault on my dignity payback for some shitty review? After all, they do produce my favorite vibrating bullet. Should\u00a0I just mend my ways and start writing unironic, sarcasm-free\u00a0product descriptions\u00a0for Sky Mall?\n\n\nGimmy Sum-O!\n\n\u00a0On second thought- Fuck you, Pipedream.\n\nUpdate!\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve been informed by Sleeping Dreamer\u00a0that I may have gotten a defective model.\u00a0\u00a0(She loves hers.) That said, I am going to see if I can exchange mine\u00a0so I can\u00a0re-evaluate my opinion. Stay tuned for more tomfuckery.\n\n* As Tyler Durden says, \u201cYou are not a unique snowflake.

I\u2019ve had it for months now and it has never failed me, in fact, it\u2019s held up to my poundage (both lbs and horrendously crazy sexing)- I would write the company because the TPU panels should not have spread apart so easily- in fact, even my much thinner friend (whose thighs are not nearly the size of mine) sat on this and they never spread apart on her to the point where she fell through. Yours sounds defective. \ud83d\ude26\n\n    \u2022 October 17, 2009 at 3:51 pm\n\n      Seriously? I definitely don\u2019t weight 10 pounds so I wonder if mine was defective or the store sold me their stretched-out floor model. It\u2019s almost like a very heavy guy stood on top of it.\n\n  1.

        "text":"Jennifer and Murielle\u2019s film collaboration to premiere at feminist festival\n\nPosted on September 10, 2009\n\nBy Jennifer Lyon Bell\n\nJennifer and friend\/collaborator Murielle Scherre (La Fille D'O) have been invited by the Stout(ste) Dromen Feminist Festival to come up with a creative erotic short film that will premiere at the festival. They are very excited to see what they come up with together.\n\nAntwerp\u2019s excellent feminist organization FC Poppesnor is planning a feminist festival around female sexuality: Stout(ste) Dromen. [Translation: Daring Dreams\/Naughty Dreams.] With live music, performances, erotic readings, intriguing films, and debate, Stoutste Dromen will bring together local and international female artists to create a day and evening that\u2019s fun, inspiring, thought-provoking, and humorous.\n\n\nThe organizers have officially asked Jennifer and Murielle Scherre (Belgium) to collaborate on an all-new, sexy, explicit short erotic movie to premiere at the festival on October 10, and they are honored to accept.\n\n\nThis is the first time that Jennifer and Murielle have worked together, though they\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to do exactly that. Murielle Scherre is a modern erotic celebrity. She\u2019s the inventor\/designer of the high-end lingerie line La Fille D\u2019O, she\u2019s a DJ, and she\u2019s also a sex-memoir author. Her first art-porn film \u201cJ\u2019Fais du Porno et J\u2019Aime \u00c7a\u201d was a huge hit. It was released in September 2009 in limited edition and instantly became a sold-out collector\u2019s item.\n\n\nJennifer and Murielle are looking for the perfect woman\/man\/couple to star in the film. Interested in participating? See our casting call for the full scoop.

Recently her pioneering efforts in business and sex tech has gained recognition with her addition as a female founder to Women of Sex Tech.\n\n\u201cThe nominations are all from my peers and it really means a lot to me that they nominated me for Businesswoman of the Year. There are many incredible women in our industry and I am honored to be counted among them.\u201d\n\nThis is Lauren\u2019s 4th nomination by Xbiz.

Xbiz is the number one source for adult industry news and networking. It is the go to source for the who\u2019s who in the adult entertainment industry. To be recognized in such a way was a huge honor. I have just been given a wonderful\u00a0professional recommendation by my peers and I will continue to strive to work and innovate in social media marketing.\n\nA huge thank you to the staff at Xbiz for the recognition and the wonderful article about me. \u00a0It is also pretty exciting to see my face sandwiched between James Deen and Stephen Winyard!\n\nA review by of the Social Marketing Panel\n\nHere is a great write up of the social media panel by\n\nThe Social Marketing session on day one of the Xbiz Summit covered profiting from alternative traffic sources like Myspace, Twitter and Facebook. The panel was Moderated by Peter Housley CEO of Naughty Tweet Network. The panel included Kelly Shibari from The PRSM Group, Lauren MacEwen from 7 Veils Media , Joanne Cachapero Membership Director at Free Speech Coalition, Christophe Peyras aka Frenchie from Streamate, Sam from, and Paige Little from\n\nThe session started with suggestions on how to be successful on Twitter. Kelly Shibari suggests that you be personal, reply to tweets @ you and post news and videos that you find interesting. Joanne Cachapero agreed that you need to show off your personality as well as posting videos and news. She also felt Myspace is considered to be dead pretty much at this point. Lauren MacEwen suggests you access your end users through twitter and that customers like being able to tweet you. She suggests you build sales by making connections through Twitter and if your customers like you they will tell their friends. Sam suggests you have contests and give things away to your Twitter followers.\n\n\nTo read the rest of this review please go to\n\nPhotos from Xbiz Chicago\n\nThe Xbiz Summit in Chicago was great. I was on the social media panel with Sexy Little Paige, Streamate, MyPornProfile, Free Speech Coalition, Kelly Shibari and Pete Housely from Porn Star Tweet moderating. It was a great panel with a lot of highly valuable information.\u00a0 The show overall was a lot of fun. Great to see everyone and spend time eating, drinking and talking porn!\n\nXbiz awards, no props to tweets\n\n, ,\nMuscle Barbie dressed like a school girl writing on a chalk board\n\nFriday Feature Photo: The beautiful, and very fit, Muscle Barbie\n\nDuring Wednesday night\u2019s\u00a0Xbiz Award show, Twitter was flooded with pics and commentary from the red carpet.\u00a0 Stars posted tweets ranging from getting ready for the event to comments on the happenings. \u00a0The next day\u2019s tweets were even more overwhelming.\u00a0 All the photos that were taken started flooding the twitterverse.\u00a0 More comments and talk about the previous night\u2019s activities were the trending topic for adult tweets. Though Twitter gave a nod to Xbiz, Xbiz did not give a nod to Twitter.\n\nFirst thing Thursday morning the list of winners was posted. Those of us who were not yet in the know ran to the site to see who won awards. \u00a0Consummate tech geek that I am, I checked the tech section first. \u00a0I am curious to see who won best website and best web services, but I am more interested in the topics.\u00a0 As the internet plays a deeper and more integral role in porn (reaffirmed by Pink Visual launching their cloud site), the categories for Web\/Tech are becoming more significant.\n\nSadly, there was no category for social media. No category for Twitter. No category for innovative social media networks. Nada.\u00a0 I am sure organizations like Adult Talent Registry would like a chance for recognition. What about twitter campaigns that companies like Adult Trading Card Company have launched? It is unusual to be on social media and not have heard their names. \u00a0Then you have the tweet aggregating powerhouse, Pornstar Tweets. And who is kidding who here, the porn stars would love a chance to get some recognition for their tweeting prowess!\n\nSo although the Xbiz awards did not recognize the social media muscle that the adult industry is flexing, efforts are not going unnoticed.\n\nCongratulations to all the winners of real categories from Xbiz. Maybe I should create my own social media porn award. What do you think?\n\nFeature Photo Friday: I met Wendy Rider, aka. Muscle Barbie, on Twitter.\u00a0 I saw one of the pictures she posted and was blown away. Not only is she beautiful, but she is fabulously fit! \u00a0 She is a WBFF Pro Figure competitor, Playboy model, International Fitness Model, and personal trainer. Yup, she is the whole package.\u00a0 Her site is not only pictures and cam, you can get live fitness training from Ms. Muscle Barbie herself!\n\nCheck out her website:\n\nFollow her on Twitter: @musclebarbie\n\nFollowing up from Xbiz\n\nSexy teacher showing tops of her garters, retro pencil drawn image\n\nToday's Lesson: Follow up! Follow up! Follow Up!\n\nWe last talked about the business card strategy to help you remember who you have met. Now it is time to hit the follow-up. This may be the most important part of your conference experience. \u00a0A good follow-up can actually be more important than a good first impression.\n\nAt conferences you meet hundreds of people.\u00a0 It is likely that a good first impression will get you the next conversation; when you reconnect, will the person really remember that first impression? Chances are they won\u2019t \u2013 at least not in any great detail.\u00a0 Your follow-up needs to be strong, because this is the impression that lasts.\n\nWhen you get done with Xbiz, email every person you received a business card from within 4 days.\u00a0 Give people a day after the conference to get their bearings and take care of business \u2013 but don\u2019t wait too long. People have short memories; strike while the iron is hot and take that initial connection and try to turn it into something more.\n\nYou might ask, what about those who I don\u2019t think will be beneficial? Maybe they are not in your industry, or they don\u2019t have services that you find useful, but that doesn\u2019t matter. You need to connect with everyone. You never know who will be\u00a0a good connection. Maybe they know someone you want to meet; perhaps they will give you a referral some day. \u00a0It does not cost you anything to send them an email that says \u201cHi! It was great meeting you.\u201d\n\nWhen you send the email try to reference something from your conversation.\u00a0Remember those notes\u00a0you made? They are going to come in handy right about now.\u00a0 If you can even remember a tidbit of the conversation, by mentioning it you are telling the person that you were invested enough in the conversation to pay attention to what was talked about. They will appreciate the reminder, which will serve to jog their memory.\u00a0 It also opens up an opportunity to continue the conversation you started, and develop a potentially beneficial connection.\n\nThe biggest difference I notice between people who are successful and people who are trying to become successful is how they operate their business. It sounds so simple, but successful people ta... (truncated)",
