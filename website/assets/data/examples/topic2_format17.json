Most of the standard utilities do this when piping or redirecting to a file. They typically only switch to line-buffered mode when outputting directly to the terminal.\n\nYou can use the stdbuf utility to force grep to do line buffering of its output:\n\ntail -f \/var\/log\/msg | stdbuf -oL grep 'error' >> logfile\n\nAs an easily observable demonstration of this effect, you can try the following two commands:\n\nfor ((i=0;;i++)); do echo $i; sleep 0.001; done | grep . | cat\n\n\nfor ((i=0;;i++)); do echo $i; sleep 0.001; done | stdbuf -oL grep . | cat\n\nIn the first command, the output from grep . (i.e. match all lines) be buffered going into the pipe to cat. On mine the buffer appears to be about 4k. You will see the ascending numbers output in chunks as the buffer gets filled and then flushed.\n\nIn the second command, grep's output into the pipe to cat is line-buffered, so you should see terminal output for every line, i.e. more-or-less continuous output.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nthank you very mush for you answer. i think you are right. it is grep that plays the trick. it does not use buffer only when stdout is terminal. \u2013\u00a0 ruanhao Feb 21 '14 at 16:18\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

We may not be able to provide all of the answers for these kinds of things, but when targeted to specific items like you\u2019ve done here, we usually can. An important thing to note is that we are a self-managed provider, which typically means that the answer to everything is that we technically have physical access (though we do not want to look inside of your droplet), and that all responsibility for what occurs inside of the droplet is the customer\u2019s responsibility.\n\nLet me try to address these:\n\n1, 2, and 3. We technically have access, we manage the back-end software, and we do not have any relevant report. We have no interest in diving in to your data, this is a trust based relationship.\n4. We technically have access and manage the back-end software that manages the volumes, but you still manage any software that runs on them, including any encryption that you do to the data stored on them. We do not have any relevant report for this.\n5. We have physical access to hypervisors, which means that it is physically possible for us to access your servers. We do not access your servers, this is a trust based relationship. You are fully responsible for managing all software, we're just providing you with a shortcut to create a droplet with some of your software preinstalled. We do not have any report relevant to this.\n\nHope that helps :)\n\n\nSubmit an Answer",

It looks like it uses only the file extension, but is there a way to force a particular language?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n3 Answers\n\nI asked support@github.com; this is their reply:\n\nWe use Pygments (http:\/\/pygments.org\/) to do syntax highlighting and determine which lexer to use based on each file's extension. So unfortunately, it doesn't look like there's a way to get C++ highlighting without renaming the files from *.c -> *.cpp and *.h -> *.hpp.\n\nYou can do this without losing git history of a file by using the git mv command.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nGitHub's language detection is done by the Linguist module, which is conveniently open source. It relies primarily on the file extension to detect the language, although it can be a bit clever to detect ambiguous files (such as .h files). As you can see from the configuration file, .c is firmly defined as a C file. Given the number of files that have to be assessed on GitHub, efficiency is a key requirement, if at the cost of some accuracy.\n\nIt looks like per repo configurations have been ruled out by the developer, so the only way you could make files syntax highlight as C++ would be to use C++ extensions. To keep those extensions and have highlighting you may have to try another service, or host the code somewhere yourself.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nFor files with a Shebang, the Shebang is considered when determining the language but seems to be evenly weighted against other tokens. This seems to be a big error because the Shebang should definitively define the language of the file. This can cause issues with highlighting.\n\nAs a workaround you can add dummy tokens in the form of a comment to \"tip the scales\" in favor of the correct language. This is experimental but I have had luck with it.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Run the unit test and make sure it passes\n  3. Refactor the code and check that the unit test still passes\n\nThis seems like a good idea to start using a TDD approach to this refactoring process, although my biggest concern is that I'm writing unit tests after the existing code (instead of writing the code after the unit tests).\n\nSince I'm writing unit tests AFTER the code, should I first refactor, do my own regression tests, then continue using the TDD steps (write failing test, write passing code, refactor, repeat)?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n4 Answers 4\n\nup vote 22 down vote accepted\n\nThere are 2 books I recommend reading as they will help with moving legacy code to TDD:\n\nWorking Effectively with Legacy Code and\nBrownfield Application Development in .Net (newer book, but .NET based).\n\nSince I'm writing unit tests AFTER the code, should I first refactor, do my own regression tests, then continue using the TDD steps (write failing test, write passing code, refactor, repeat)?\n\nWrite the tests before you refactor. The tests will be more of a specification (the code does X) before you start modifying it. This way, when you refactor the code, the test matches the existing code, so if your refactoring breaks something, it will make existing customers unhappy.\n\nThe above 2 books will give you more ideas of how to decide where to break things up into smaller (and more manageable) pieces, and when to leave things alone.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n+1 - the Feathers book is pure gold \u2013\u00a0 Alan Jun 7 '11 at 3:47\n+1 - again for Working Effectively with Legacy Code book \u2013\u00a0 stuartf Jun 7 '11 at 10:56\nExcellent, thanks I will consider buying that book. \u2013\u00a0 sooprise Jun 7 '11 at 13:39\n+1 for both books. \u2013\u00a0 famousgarkin Dec 23 '11 at 9:33\n\nYou NEED a test to show that the refactoring didn't break anything.\n\nI am a big fan of the A B theory based test that @Squirrel described.\n\nI am also a big fan of characterization tests from (working w\/legacy code) via Michael Feathers.\n\nPersonally, this is the technique I use in 90% of my work with legacy code (it's a variation of characterization tests).\n\n  1. reduce to functional\n  2. run\n  3. capture the result with an approval test ( www.approvaltests.com )\n\nStep 1 Imagine you were refactoring a bunch of functional code. This means; All used parameters are passed in, No side effects, always deterministic (pure); all useful results are returned.\n\nfor example you have a method string Foo(int a, boolean b)\n\nthis would be easy to test, just throw in some data, and follow steps 2&3 and you'd end up with nice characterization test.\n\nof course this isn't the real world. in the real world I would get something like\n\nvoid Foo()\n\nso 1st I would figure out what it's side effects are. They are probably some combination of 1. change global variables 2. change database 3. change files 4. make web api calls\n\nso then I would log all those changes:\n\n\n\nNow I can think of the function as\n\nLog Foo()\n\nthen run it and see what happens, it probably isn't deterministic, because you haven't passed in any variables, as you start to see what is occurring, you can start to see what needs to be passed in. Let's say it's a database. then you need to effectively do a rollback.\n\n\nlog = LogToString()\n\n\n\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nI think Stacy calls it 'Branching by Abstraction'\n\nFor legacy code the best approch I've found is to find pinch points in your code where it's easy to insert an interface covering the inputs and outputs.\n\nCopy your first implementation, refactor, and then have a regression implementation that runs the old way and the new way and stops dead as soon as any difference is found.\n\nDoing this we've managed to replace some things seamlessly that my gut told me however hard I tried we'd land up in trouble, but it worked without a problem.\n\n(* watch out for non-functional differences like performance though!)\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nIMO you should go ahead and write the unit tests for passing statements before doing any refactoring. The reason is because you want to be in a known state before making changes.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAgreed. This is the sweet spot for automated tests: the interface isn't changing, the implementation is, and the code should behave as it did before. \u2013\u00a0 user246 Jul 3 '11 at 22:24\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"Quickie on how OclHashcat+ works\nHi. I would like to know if cl: 8 in oclhashcat+ means that 1 password of length 8 is being processed or a group of passwords of length 8 is processed? If it is the latter, how many? Thanks.\nthe reason behind that is that some kernels require all plaintexts to be of the same length to process them efficiently. brute-force crackers usually do not have this problem because the length of the generated plaintext is always the same. but not so in wordlists. usually the words in wordlists are not sorted by their length. so my idea was oclHashcat+ caches all the loaded words and stores them into multiple buffers while it loads them. each length has one unqiue buffer. so if a word has the length 8 i put it into buffer 8. now for example if buffer 8's threshold is reached it processes them and clears it afterwards. so cl:8 means oclHashcat+ processes now all cached words with length 8. this is why it looks a bit random but it is not. hint: you can optimize your wordlists for oclhashcat+ usage. you just need to sort them by their length. i recommend you to generate seperate wordlists sorted by their length. latest hashcat-utils package ships with a tool \"splitlen\" which was written exactly for this task.\ni should add two things\n\na) if a wordlist ends, all the buffers that still have data to process are executed one after another. thats why oclhc+ usually processes cl:1-15 at the end.\n\nb) the size of the buffer depends on your gpu and the -n multiplier value. it is: $num_sp * 256 * $-n_val",

Is Perl Y2K co\n\n\n\nJan\u00a019,\u00a02001,\u00a02:41\u00a0PM\n\nPost #1 of 1 (4589 views)\nDoes Perl have a year 2000 problem? Is Perl Y2K co Can't Post\n\n(From the Perl FAQ)\n\nDoes Perl have a year 2000 problem? Is Perl Y2K compliant?\n\nShort answer: No, Perl does not have a Year 2000 problem. Yes, Perl is Y2K compliant. The programmers you're hired to use it, however, probably are not.\n\nLong answer: Perl is just as Y2K compliant as your pencil--no more, and no less. The date and time functions supplied with perl (gmtime and localtime) supply adequate information to determine the year well beyond 2000 (2038 is when trouble strikes for 32-bit machines). The year returned by these functions when used in an array context is the year minus 1900. For years between 1910 and 1999 this happens to be a 2-digit decimal number. To avoid the year 2000 problem simply do not treat the year as a 2-digit number. It isn't.\n\nWhen gmtime() and localtime() are used in scalar context they return a timestamp string that contains a fully-expanded year. For example, $timestamp = gmtime(1005613200) sets $timestamp to ``Tue Nov 13 01:00:00 2001''. There's no year 2000 problem here.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Perl can't be used to create non-Y2K compliant programs. It can. But so can your pencil. It's the fault of the user, not the language. At the risk of inflaming the NRA: ``Perl doesn't break Y2K, people do.''
