Set the include_directories variable in CMake to provide the headers path to the IDE. More details on CMake configuration can be found in our Quick CMake Tutorial.\n\nSince CLion 1.5 EAP there is also a new feature\u00a0\u2018Mark Directory As\u2019 that allows to mark directories as:\n\n  \u2022 Excluded\n  \u2022 Libraries\n  \u2022 Project sources and headers\n\nRead more about use cases and details in our blog.\n\n\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.6)\n\n\n#Set your directories.

When I change that to\u00a0\n\n#include \"module.h\"\n\nit does work as the .cpp file is in the same folder as the header. But I'm not allowed to use \"\".\u00a0How do I make CLion find my headers included with #include <> ? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nI have the same issue: my header files are included as #include <xxx.h> and they are not recognised and all my struct definitions are red\n\nI have included\u00a0\n\ninclude_directories( .\/src\/include )\nwhich is where my header files are\n\nWe can't reproduce the\u00a0problem on our side.\u00a0Could you please file a bug report and attach an isolated sample project?\n\nThanks in\u00a0advance.\n\n\nI have a project which builds inside an \"SDK\" in chroot environment. Project CMake build system is designed to be used from inside the SDK. I managed to build the project by specifying CMake from inside the SDK in CLion->Settings->Build,->Toolchains.\n\nProblem is that build is working now, but proper indexing is not. CMake cache contains paths to includes relative to the SDK root. It makes make happy, but CLion can't resolve them.\n\nQuestion is if there is any CLion configuration file where I can specify include paths for indexing?\n\n\nV Krikun, could you please describe your configuration (and\u00a0if possible, attach the generated\u00a0cmake files) in\u00a0CPP-2519?\n\n\n\nPlease sign in to leave a comment.\n\nHave more questions?\n\nSubmit a request",

This new\ndatabase server will have a new name for SharePoint to reference.

Then all you would need to do is move the physical databases\nand change which server the alias was pointing to. That's why its normally\na best practice to always use SQL aliases when doing a SharePoint install.\nSince it appears that you didn't use aliases, it's a little more difficult.\nMoving your content databases is fairly easy. You can just detach them,\nback them up, restore them to the new server and then re-attach them using\nthe new location. But you can't do that with the configuration database.\nTake a look at the following blog post for more info.\n\n\nAnswer #2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Renata Burt \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nUnfortunately when this farm was originally configured the db alias option was\noverlooked or not literally recommended at the time 3 years ago. I'm the one\nwho set up this farm originally, I reviewed MS documentation available at the\ntime and do not see a reference to using a db alias during installation. Oh\nwell, that is water under the bridge.\n\nI will review the link you sent. I also was referred to this link:\n\n\nIt's a newer procedure, but still does not give an example that is like my\nrequirement. I may have to create a hybrid solution.\n\nHopefully I can come up with a solution that includes a db alias.\n\nAnswer #3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Lazaro Rutledge \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nIt is a newer link, but you'll notice that step 11 requires creation of a\nSQL alias that uses the same name as the existing SQL server. This will\nonly work if you are deactivating the existing server when moving the\ndatabase. So you will be physically moving the databases, but all the\nnaming will remain exactly the same as it is now.\n\nAnswer #4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Karin Kerr \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nI noticed that as well. Since in this solution I will not be changing the db\nserver name configuration in SharePoint, I have other concerns.\n\nThe current database server configuration is \"ds1prodmoss\\moss,1437\". Will this\nformat convert to an alias name. My concern is whether I can use a '\\'\ncharacter in the alias name and also indicate the port number as part of the\nalias name? Does the alias point directly to the instance or does the instance\nget appended to the alias name? And the same with the port number. Will an\nalias name such as this be invalid?\n\nAnswer #5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Vinod Kumar \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nYou'll have to try it. I normally use an alias so that I don't have to\ninclude the instance name, since that can cause some issues in SharePoint\n2010. Whichever way you go I don't think you would use the port number as\npart of the alias.\n\nAnswer #6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered By: Jeffery Hayes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answered On: Sep 17\n\nI've successfully aliased a named instance before.

You may have to wait for them to get around to doing it, and then update your copy of the theme to the latest version after.\n\nThe fastest is to do it yourself: overwrite the section shortcode by creating a shortcode at yoursite\/layouts\/shortcodes\/section.html. Copy the contents of the theme\u2019s theme\/layout\/shortcodes\/section.html, and add\n\n{{ $_hugo_config := `{ \"version\": 1 }` }}\n\nto the beginning, as discussed in the relnotes I linked to above.\n\n\nFor future reference, this is what I did to fix this (until the reveal creators update the theme).\n\n$ cp .\/themes\/reveal-hugo\/layouts\/shortcodes\/section.html .\/layouts\/shortcodes\n\n$ tree layouts\/\n`-- shortcodes\n    `-- section.html\n\n1 directory, 1 file\n\nEdit that section.html to give it the following contents:\n\n$ cat layouts\/shortcodes\/section.html\n{{ $_hugo_config := `{ \"version\": 1 }` }}\n<section data-shortcode-section>\n{{ .Inner }}\n\nAnd now the section code works as I expected it from following previous (now out of date) tutorial matter.",

Nominate new content that should later be of type 'course'.\n\nAll nominations should be listed somewhere.\n\nWhat's the best way to do this?\n\nFor 1. I thought about using the Flag module and then just make a view where all nodes with nomination flag are listed.\n\nFor 2. I'm not sure, maybe I use webforms and the admin has to transfer it into a node of type 'course'. But how do I get a list of new AND existing nominated content?\n\n\nHow about using modules Node_convert, and Flag (which is obviously a must have for what you're looking for)? About Node convert (from it's project page):\n\nadds a menu tab \"Convert\" on the node view page, i.e. node\/1\/convert, which gives the ability to convert the node from its current node type to another node type. The module provides the means to transfer all the field values of the current node type into fields on the destination node type, or discard them.\n\nI'm using Node_convert already for long time, works great. It allows for implementing a lifecycle (or workflow?) to start from a node that is only just something like an idea (or suggestion, question, issue, abstract, etc). Those ideas that get the highest votings, are the ones that seem to make sense to handle with highest priority. Compare it to a 'Question' with a lot of votes, but with hardly any (or no) answers.\n\nWhen the node's content evolves (read: the more effort\/details added to it), I convert its content type to finished products like (eg) a recipe, a redbook (already from my Drupal 6 days a few years ago).\n\nBy combining it with some type of access module (related to either taxonomy or content type) I can make it more restrictive to give access to it. E.g. public to start from, then \"authenticated\", and in the end only for roles such as \"subscribers\", \"students\", etc.\n\nMaybe you also want to consider Fivestar and\/or Voting API (I have the impression that \"Voting\" is a kind of synomym of what you mean with \"Nominate\").\n\nAnd of course: use Views as you are considering already. To continue my samples above: using some basics Views reports, you can easily massage it all in a todo list also.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 thanks for your input, sadly node_convert does not support all of the field types I need (e.g. paragraphs) but I keep this one in mind for another project. \u2013\u00a0scar May 18 '15 at 14:45\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
