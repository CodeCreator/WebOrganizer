        "text":"Calling all heroes\n\nThe word \u201chero\u201d can bring to mind anyone from law enforcement officers keeping communities safe to emergency responders saving lives to the firefighters working to contain the Funny River Road wildfire.\n\n\nBut the Summer of Heroes program, developed through a partnership between Alaska Communications and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Alaska, looks to recognize the young heroes of Alaska.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just recognizing a youth in the community (who have) done good,\u201d said Heather Schloeman, executive director of Boys and Girls Clubs of the Kenai Peninsula.\n\nA panel of judges will select five winners from nominated kids this summer to receive a $1,500 scholarship and a trip to the Alaska State Fair in Palmer where they will be recognized for their heroism.\n\nJennifer Brown, director of marketing and public relations for Boys and Girls Clubs of Alaska, said the Summer of Heroes program has grown with more nominees since its debut four years ago. Brown had sat on the judging panel and said selecting five winners is not an easy process.\n\n\u201cI want to pick them all because they\u2019re all just really good kids that need to be recognized,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown said the program has received nominees of all ages from throughout the state.\n\nChance Haller, a 17 year old from Seldovia, was selected as a hero last summer. Haller has been volunteering in the community as a firefighter since 2011.\n\n\u201cMy dad stepped up and became fire chief and kind of dragged me along with him,\u201d Haller said.\n\nIn 2012, Haller put in 250 volunteer hours for the fire department. He is studying toward his Firefighter I certificate, but no one in Seldovia is certified to do the training for it.\n\n\u201cEverything (in Seldovia) is volunteer, so we\u2019re not certified to go into houses or any of that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re certified to hold a hose and put the fire out.\u201d\n\nHaller is also a certified emergency trauma technician. When he\u2019s 18, Haller plans on becoming an emergency medical technician.\n\nHaller will be a high school senior next year and plans to attend Kenai Peninsula College for computer science. While working toward a degree, Haller also wants to continue firefighting. After college, he wants to attend the Alaska State Trooper academy.\n\nNearly a year after finding out he won, Haller still doesn\u2019t know who nominated him.\n\n\u201cHe is kind of an all-around outstanding kid,\u201d said Hannah Blankenship with Alaska Communications.\n\nIn 2012, Courtney Stroh of Kenai and Shaylee Rizzo, a Nikiski teen, received Summer of Heroes scholarships for their community work. Stroh founded a team to clean up fish waste during dipnet season in Kenai. Rizzo raised awareness about vehicle and moose accidents by writing a kid\u2019s book and educating elementary students.\n\nAlaskans are asked to nominate youth ages 6-18 who make a difference in their community whether it\u2019s raising money for a cause, volunteering or contributing in other ways. Nominations can be made through July15 online at alaskacommunications.com\/summerofheroes or forms can be picked up at Alaska Communications stores or Boys and Girls Clubs.\n\nFor every Alaska Communications smartphone purchased before July 15, the company will donate $25 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Alaska.\n\nClarion file material was used in this article.\n\nKaylee Osowski can be reached at kaylee.osowski@peninsulaclarion.com\n\n\nMon, 04\/23\/2018 - 21:03\n\nFarmers look to attract tourists",

In an industry that shuns public relationships, their story is practically unheard of!\n\n| @hyojong_1994\/Instagram\n\nIn a recent behind the scenes video for HyunA\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Not Cool\u201d music video, DAWN shared practical advice on how to make your significant other feel loved. It must be one of the reasons why their relationship is still going strong!\n\n| @hyojong_1994\/Instagram\n\nAt one point during the video, HyunA complained about the pain she felt on her feet because of the cold floor. It didn\u2019t help that there were beads scattered all over, making dancing even more difficult for her.\n\nMy toes are so frozen, I can\u2019t dance. It hurts, and there are beads at the bottom so it hurts even more. Dancing barefoot is no joke.\n\n\u2014 HyunA\n\nAlthough he couldn\u2019t do anything about the floor, DAWN made sure that HyunA was at least hydrated by fetching a bottle of water. Surprisingly, however, he passed\u00a0it to a staff member to hand it to her in his stead!\n\nShe happily drank the bottled water without knowing that DAWN was behind the thoughtful gesture.\n\nDAWN explained that he didn\u2019t give it himself because he doesn\u2019t like grand gestures. Rather, he believes that the secret is to show love through the little things.\n\nThe key is to not be showy. Gotta let her know through the little things that you care\u2014for real.\n\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder these two have such a strong relationship!\n\nWatch the full video below to see more of HyunA and DAWN.\n\nSource: YouTube",

        "text":"Panther Service Day offers new sites,\u00a0collaborations\n\nKalyn Hayslett, Editor-in-Chief\n\nHang on for a minute...we're trying to find some more stories you might like.\n\nEmail This Story\n\nStudents can volunteer sooner and at new locations for the 15th Annual Panther Service Day April 1, which will kick-start Greek Week.\n\nBeth Gillespie, director of the civic engagement and volunteerism office, said making Panther Service Day a part of Greek Week is something new the office is trying this year.\n\n\u201cIn the past Panther Service Day is typically later in April, and we do have Greek participation. But by building it into Greek Week, we are hopeful that we will have more students go out, both from the Greek community and not,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nIndividuals and groups will receive free T-shirts if they register to volunteer by Thursday. Students can register online by going to the Panther Service Day tab on the Civic Engagement and Volunteerism Office homepage.\n\nIf students are a part of a fraternity, sorority or registered student organization with more than five people volunteering, they will need to complete a group registration form. Individual registration forms are also available.\n\nGreek Week lasts from March 31 to April 9. Airband performances, Panther Service Day and Greek Sing will all take place the first weekend.\n\nCrystal Brown, assistant director for the civic engagement and volunteerism office, said the Greek Week volunteer committee came up with idea in the hopes of engaging more Greek members.\n\nCommittee member Catie Witt said the Panhellenic Council requires its fraternities and sororities to have 15 percent of their members participate.\n\n\u201cThey came to (the volunteerism office) about doing a service project on that Saturday, and we discussed it here and with them. We thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we move Panther Service Day and make it a collaborative effort and a larger event?\u2019\u201d Brown said.\n\nCheck-in will be at 9 a.m. April 1 in the University Ballroom of the Martin Luther King Jr. Union. Participants can have bagel and cream cheese in the morning and will be dismissed based on site location. Students are responsible for providing their own lunch, Gillespie said.\n\nStudents can choose from volunteer sites that have been offered during Panther Service Day for years including HOPE, Douglas Heart Nature Center, Standing Stone Community Center, Five Mile House and First Fruits Homestead.\n\nThey can also choose sites typically offered during different times of the year including a mobile food pantry, a car wash fundraiser and community aid in Ashmore.\n\nGillespie said this year is the first time students can volunteer for Choices for Pregnancy, where they can help clean up the agency\u2019s thrift store, stock the shelves and organize the merchandise.\n\n\u201cThey help women with education during pregnancy (and) help with education about parenting in terms of techniques, physical and emotional health of babies after birth. They support the mother and baby until the baby is 2 to 3 years old. They do it for free,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nChoices for Pregnancy only has one employee and relies on volunteers to help maintain the educational services they provide all year, Gillespie said.\n\n\u201cWe like them because they support mothers who have low income, may be struggling or who are trying to be a different kind of parent then they have experienced \u2014 and they do this in a judgment-free supportive environment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe car wash fundraiser will be held in the Auto Zone parking lot, and the goal is to raise $250, which will be donated to One Stop Community Christmas, Gillespie said.\n\nVolunteers will make signs in the morning to recruit community members, Brown said.\n\nThe Eastern Illinois Food Bank will organize the mobile food pantry sites. The volunteers will travel to Georgetown, Illinois, approximately an hour away, so students will meet in the Union and carpool to the location.\n\n\u201cJust due to the nature of the program, it will take place from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. which is a little longer than the time of the rest of the projects,\u201d Brown said.\n\nEvery location will have student government representatives and executive board members to serve as site leaders.\n\nGillespie said the student government representatives will help answer questions and make sure everyone is having fun and knows what they need to do.\n\n\u201cWe are going to act as those Prowl leaders for Panther Service Day. We don\u2019t have a volunteer requirement for student government, but we always try to do our best to volunteer together,\u201d Witt said.\n\nSince 2003, student government has co-sponsored the service day and helped supply the free T-shirts.\n\n\u201cWe are really grateful for the partnership; we are glad that it has continued, and we think it offers the senators from student government another chance to be a leader for those who put them in office,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cTo go out and spend time doing good together is a powerful experience and for those in student government who are wanting to be leaders on campus we think it\u2019s a great way for them to do just that.\u201d\n\nWitt said the current student senators are not shy and will use this time to meet new people.\n\n\u201cThis gives them a chance to branch out and potentially meet new people and maybe learn a perspective they originally did not hear before,\u201d Witt said.\n\nKalyn Hayslett can be reached at 581-2812 or [email\u00a0protected]",

The school partners with Assisting the Homeless, an organization started by Hinshaw, to put on the event, which raised $5,400 as of Sunday night. Hinshaw expects that number to increase, because he\u2019s still receiving donations.\n\nThe event first took place in Hinshaw\u2019s backyard after friends told him they\u2019d pay 10 or 20 bucks if he shaved his head. (He then donated the money.) After several years, Hinshaw partnered with the school to create a fundraiser that doubles as an end of the school year party with an inflatable obstacle course, face painting, dunk tank and other games.\u00a0\n\nThe highlight, though, is the head-shaving. Last year, 78 people had their heads shaved, including four girls. Girls who want to keep their hair can participate by receiving feathers or extensions. Shaving help comes from employees from three local salons \u2013 Hair Cuttery, Olivia Jean and Baci.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a fun, tangible way that the kids can get involved,\u201d said Tina Rounds, executive director of BEDS Plus, who will be at the event.\u00a0\n\nOn May 10, a group of students from the school visited BEDS Plus to learn about homelessness and serve lunch at the organization\u2019s support center.\u00a0\n\nBEDS shelters have served 211 people since July 2012, twice as many as it served the previous year. Rounds attributes the increase to the organization\u2019s additional outreach and effects of the recession that started in 2008.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all just a couple tragedies \u2026 away from being in a position where we could be [homeless],\u201d Rounds said.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to the La Grange Highlands fundraiser, Hinshaw is trying a new event called Buzzapalooza to get high school students involved. Buzzapalooza will be from noon to 4 p.m. Sunday at Denning Park. The event is open to everyone and will feature music, food and an iPad Mini raffle in addition to head shaving.\u00a0\n\nDonations to Assisting the Homeless can be made online at\n\nLoading more",
