The true meaning of Christmas.\u201d\n\nAnd Jules Farley said: \u201cWhat a wonderful thing to do. Well done Wellsprings.\u201d\n\nThe owners of The Wellsprings, Zak and Catherine Marhraoui, have reserved a table for six on Christmas Day for local senior citizens.\n\nZak said: \u201cWe are fully booked up for Christmas Day, but a lady phoned up wanting to book, and said it was just for herself. This got us thinking that there are probably other people who will be facing Christmas alone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d never really thought about this before but are now thinking that we should do this every year.\u201d\n\nThe taxi company that the couple regularly use for customers \u2013 Saf Cabs \u2013 subsequently offered its services.\n\nThere are currently four spaces left for any elderly person who will be alone on Christmas Day, and to reserve a place call The Wellsprings on 01200 427722.\n\nSince August, The Wellsprings has suffered a significant down turn in trade after work started to build a roundabout at the junction of Clitheroe\u2019s Pendle Road on to the A59.\n\nZak said: \u201cPeople just don\u2019t think they can get to us because of the road closure and it\u2019s been really bad for business. We\u2019ve had to cut the hours of members of staff as during the week it has just been dead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they shouldn\u2019t build the roundabout, but we\u2019re still paying \u00a31,200 a month in business rates and getting nothing in return.

Apparently, he and his team scraped 10,000 status updates for the phrases \"break up\" and \"broken up,\" and made the following discoveries: 1). A ton of people break up before social occasions like Spring Break and the summer, 2). Mondays aren't just the start of the work week \u2014 there're the end of many a relationship, 3). People have the decency not to dump their significant others on Christmas Day.\n\nThe above chart is just another addition to a growing canon of information depicting both Facebook's effect on \u2014 and role in \u2014 the dating realm. In the past, we have explored the negative effects of Facebook on one's romantic life, as well as how some people use the social networking site to end things.\n\nWhat effect \u2014 if any \u2014 has Facebook had on your dating life?\n\n(via Mathias Mikkelsen)\n\nImage courtesy of iStockphoto, A1Stock",

Page Hilltop Principal Fred Deppe was very pleased with this event and its turnout. \"The PTO Winter Ball is one of our most popular annual events. It affords our Page Hilltop dads (and male designees) the opportunity to spend some special one-on-one time with their girls beyond the usual realm of homework help and sports coaching. For all of the grades K-5 girls, it is their night to dress up and be treated like a princess. The girls also get to introduce their special escorts to all of their friends and share a memorable evening together.\"\n\nFrom 7 to 9 p.m., more than 300 attendees danced to the musical selections of DJ Jim Bean. The Ayer-Shirley High School cafeteria was transformed into a winter wonderland, with festive balloons, snowflakes and twinkly lights for all to enjoy.\n\nIn between dancing cheek to cheek, kicking their heels up to the \"Cha Cha Slide\" and enjoying refreshments, every \"couple\" was able to get their pictures taken by Stephen Dillard of O'Connor Studios. \"Every year, we have such a good time. It's one of our best nights of the year,\" Paul Marshall said.\n\n\nMarshall and his daughter, Mackenzie, have attended each year she has been at Page Hilltop, but this year is her last before she moves over to the middle school in the fall.\n\nSenate Construction sponsored the evening and the PTO is extremely thankful for the support owners Jan and Bob France have given to this event. \"My husband has always been very supportive of the schools and he is always very happy to be a part of this eventful night,\" Jan France said.\n\nPinard's Florist also played an important part at the dance. \"We love being a part of this very special annual event,\" Lisa Richard, of Pinard's, said. Richard made many of the corsages and boutonnieres that were worn that evening. \"We are always so happy and honored to be even a small part of this event that enables dads and their daughters to create magical memories that they will hopefully never forget,\" Richard said. Pinard's also donated a centerpiece to be raffled off at the end of the evening.\n\nThe dance committee had additional help to make the evening as successful as it was. Special thanks go out to Ayer-Shirley High School students Samantha Clark-Young, Hannah Grise, Maddie Norton, Krista Prehl and Tori Smiraglia, Page Hilltop teachers Beth Lewis and Jan France, Principal Fred Deppe and Assistant Principal Karen DeWitt, and parents Ann Reeves, Linda Harrington, Carolyn Piwowar, Dana Bresnahan, Julie Staraitis, Kimberly Hoffman, Lynne Fish, Dawn Barr, Charisse Murphy and Tammy Valliere.",

Jamie turns 12 on 12\/12\/12.\n\nFor some, today\u2019s date is only a nifty numerical event, a repeating lineup of 1s and 2s crowding a calendar square.\n\nFor others, it\u2019s a wedding day, a chance to pick lucky lottery numbers, or a reason to run 12 kilometers.\n\nFor Jamie Poignon, Dec. 12, 2012, is pretty much the coolest day ever to turn 12. Jamie, a Bedford Junior High School sixth grader from Temperance, will celebrate the day she\u2019s long awaited with a family gathering today and a party with friends this weekend.\n\n\u201cMy family members always said stuff about it. I don\u2019t think it really sank in until a couple of years ago,\u201d she said.\n\nJamie\u2019s mother gave birth at Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center on Dec. 12, 2000, several days after her Dec. 7 due date. Wendy Poignon said her daughter\u2019s birthday celebration will include cake and decorations in keeping with the once-in-a-lifetime, triple-dozen date. \u201cWe\u2019ve been planning this for years. We\u2019ve been excited,\u201d she said. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s her lucky day. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to buy some lottery tickets and some scratch-offs, and we\u2019ll see if anything comes of it.\u201d\n\nThe Poignons aren\u2019t the only ones with that idea. The Ohio Lottery\u00a0reported the numbers 1, 2, 1, 2 sold out for Tuesday and today's\u00a0midday and evening drawings. The lottery has a liability limit \u2014 the\u00a0highest amount it will pay out on a winning combination of numbers.\u00a0Players no longer can pick those numbers once the liability is\u00a0reached. Lottery spokesman Danielle Frizzi-Babb said it\u2019s common for\u00a0numbers to sell out whenever there\u2019s a \u201csignificant\u201d or repeating\u00a0date.\n\nThe numbers motivated runners, too. More than 300 people registered for a just-for-kicks 12\/12\/12K run, scheduled to start at 12:12 a.m. today. By the time most of the Toledo area wakes up this morning, hundreds of runners should have made the multiple-loop run on roads around Levis Commons in Perrysburg.\n\nRace director Ed O\u2019Reilly of the Toledo Roadrunners Club also organized a 10K run on Oct. 10, 2010, and an 11K on Nov. 11, 2011. He called it \u201cthe end of the world series,\u201d a wink and nod to Apocalypse predictions some base on the Mayan calendar. Second Sole running store helped with the race registration, and the Perrysburg store also was to serve at the race\u2019s start and finish place, general manager Matt Folk said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there will be a lot of hard-core, competitive runners,\u201d he said, adding the emphasis remained on the \u201cunique, fun, social\u201d aspect of night running on a special date.\n\nTo commemorate the event, race participants could buy a glow-in-the-dark shirt. Louann Cummings, a University of Findlay professor, hoped to wear that shirt today during a noon final she\u2019s scheduled to give to an accounting class. She runs regularly with an early rising group that meets at 5:15 a.m.\n\n\u201cThis is just a little bit earlier,\u201d she said, noting she won\u2019t have a chance to run on a repeating date again.\n\nAt the Lucas County Courthouse, officials prepared for an uptick in marriages on the special date. The Rev. Sandra Frost performs courthouse ceremonies and will be on hand today to marry couples. She said the date\u2019s rarity and the ease of remembering the anniversary are two reasons some choose repeating dates to wed.\n\nProbate Court Administrator Charles Shaffer anticipated today\u2019s marriage activity to be more than a normal Wednesday\u2019s but less than Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cIt will be busy; they aren\u2019t going to be lined up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people that ... get married on these certain dates, and this is the last one [in our lifetime] you are going to see.\u201d\n\nContact Vanessa McCray at: vmccray@theblade.com or 419-724-6065.",

Vendor tables are still available.\n\nThe festival will feature a one-of-a-kind fashion show with a wedding theme, workshops on adoption, civil unions, health and career as well as LGBT-friendly exhibitors, promoting their businesses.\n\nEntertainment will also feature give-aways and possible raffles.

We are thankful for the contribution, \u201d he said.\n\nThe cheque was handed over by The Star\u2019s Johor bureau chief Nelson Benjamin during a simple ceremony at the home in Taman Bukit Rinting, Pasir Gudang.\n\nThhm, who founded the shelter 17 years ago, said during the MCO period, the kids started using Facebook Live to hold cooking shows as well as to sell pastries and kaya made by themselves.\n\nThe home currently has 28 residents aged between two and 25. They are mostly orphans or abandoned children as well as those from poor single-parent families.\n\nThhm said the home initially aimed to raise RM1.8mil to build its Green Smile Nature Farm in Kota Tinggi, which can provide shelter to about 80 underprivileged children.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the 0.89ha nature farm has reached about 50% progress and is due to be completed by early next year, \u201d he said.\n\n\u201dSome generous donors contributed construction materials for the project which covered a majority of the cost, but we still need about RM800,000.\n\n\u201cOnce completed, we hope to provide the necessary education and skills training so that the residents can be independent and make it on their own, \u201d he said.\n\nThhm hopes to expand the farm into an agro-tourism facility to achieve the home\u2019s ultimate mission of becoming self-sustaining without having to rely heavily on donations in future.\n\nStar Foundation is the charitable arm of Star Media Group that aims to support impactful initiatives to help a diverse group of beneficiaries.\n\nVisit starfoundation.com.my for more information.\n\nArticle type: free\nUser access status:\n\nCare Haven home , orphans , Star Foundation\n\n\nDid you find this article insightful?\n\n\n75% readers found this article insightful\n\nAcross the site",

        "text":"Housing Homeless Youth Takes Trust, Love\n\nTaking care of the homeless is an ongoing problem in Alaska and it\u2019s not limited to adults. There is also a large, and less visible, population of homeless kids. During the day they might be in school, indistinguishable from other students. But at night, they\u2019re couch surfers. These kids may be avoiding an unsafe situation at home, or they\u2019re over 18 \u2014 between childhood and adulthood \u2014 and simply have no options.\n\nKCAW visits with a family in Sitka who participates in a host home program \u2014 the only one in Alaska, and one of very few in the nation. They take in kids from ages 16 through 21 who have no place to go and give them a home.\n\nThere\u2019s this family in Sitka that has homeless teenagers living in their house. It might make some people nervous \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to raise a teenager or being one for that matter \u2014 especially when dealing with all the problems that come with being homeless. The family, a longtime married couple, looks past what the kids might seem like on the outside and look inside for who they really are.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had children in our home that people are just dumbfounded that we let them into our home,\u201d the host dad says. \u201cTheir jaw drops. My response is, I don\u2019t know this person you\u2019re talking about. Kids make mistakes. If they make mistakes in a different environment, that\u2019s a different deal.\u201d\n\nThe couple is part of a program run by the nonprofit Youth Advocates of Sitka, or YAS. It places homeless youth with families in the community. We\u2019ve been asked to keep the resource parents\u2019 names confidential to protect the identities of the homeless teens they\u2019ve hosted.\n\nThe resource dad says most of the people they invite into their home have really become part of the family.\n\n\u201cI call them all my children,\u201d he said. \u201cLong after they\u2019re gone, many of them have grown up, and have bought their own homes and their own cars, have their own families, and have moved to different parts of the United States. For us it\u2019s about family. We wanted to have a large family and sometimes things don\u2019t turn out the way you think, but it\u2019s been a blessing for us because now we can still have a large family.\u201d\n\nClients can be 16 through 21 years old and are able to stay in a home for up to 18 months. The program is funded by a federal grant and is the only one of its kind in Alaska.\n\nThe couple has hosted more than a dozen youth over the five-year life of the program. They also take younger foster care kids. Since they always wanted a big family, they\u2019re committed to having the same dynamic in their house.\n\n\u201cI have five sisters and three brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s the oldest of 7. So we\u2019re very comfortable with large families. We know what it\u2019s like to share food and do dishes and have to think of others\u2026we encourage family dinners. Every night. That\u2019s really important. We both come from families where everybody, no matter what your schedule was, you had to be home at a certain time.\u201d\n\nCultivating healthy relationships can be really hard, especially if trust has been broken in the past like it has been for many of these youth. And the host mom believes that to have a healthy relationship, love isn\u2019t necessarily required.\n\n\u201cA big thing is communication and trust,\u201d said the host mom. \u201cTrust is a huge thing. A lot of times, we\u2019ve had conversations with our kids or with each other about what matters most, love or trust? You know, you don\u2019t need to have both to have a healthy relationship. But having trust is so much bigger.\u201d\n\nLove is unconditional; trust is not. They say that to cultivate and keep trust, you have to avoid so-called \u201cdeal breakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you violate emotional, physical, spiritual\u2026those kinds of things are deal breakers.\u201d It usually comes down to physical abuse or emotional abuse.\u201d\n\nOther deal breakers are using alcohol, pot and other substances that might play a large role in some of the lives of these kids. This is a clean home \u2013 they don\u2019t even drink a glass of wine at dinner.\n\n\u201cSo, they\u2019re able to see that kind of a lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little different for them to experience that, and to learn how that kind of lifestyle is and to know that it\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0accepted into their home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to create is an environment where they have to be dishonest with us,\u201d\u2018 said the host dad. \u201cSo, we really try to foster dialogue and an environment where they\u2019re going to feel safe to talk with us. Some can\u2019t handle it. Their substances are very important to them, so have to leave the house.\u201d\n\nAnd the program has some deal breakers, too. In order for the youth to qualify for the program, they have to be willing to set some goals of their own and work toward becoming independent.\n\nJessica Clark is the family resource center program manager of YAS. She meets with clients to make an individual plan. She says just setting goals helps a lot of people get on their feet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard people say, I would like to be a rockstar,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working with youth, it\u2019s really easy to be like, come on now, you\u2019re homeless and you wanna be a rockstar. Let\u2019s talk about reality. The reality is, if you start listing what you need to have in line and do to be a rockstar, you\u2019ll find out that it\u2019s a lot of the same job skills that you might need, minus maybe the music part.\u201d\n\nJust as each person\u2019s life plan is individualized, so is the home placement. All different types of families take part in the program, and a lot of care is put into matching up the family and youth in a situation that they all feel good in.\n\n\u201cWe always keep in touch with them,\u201d said the host dad. \u201cThey call us up, they still come over. Even years later, the kids do. To say hello, wish us happy birthday. It\u2019s like having older kids when you\u2019re\u2026I feel like an old man, because I\u2019m going to my kid\u2019s house\u2026\u201d\n\nListen to the full story\n\nDownload Audio",

The \u2018Write to Ride\u2019 initiative will have the kids in the program writing their very own newsletter.\n\nFor a fee, you can access a regularly-scheduled newsletter featuring short stories, poems, a skateboarding lingo dictionary, profiles of the kids, coaches, sponsors, and more. The fundraiser, and the foundation itself, is the brainchild of Devin Publikover.\n\nMr. Publikover says this new initiative will allow the kids to hone their writing skills while helping contribute to the organization. The kids are \u201cpretty excited\u201d about the newsletter, he said.\n\nSo far, Rite to Ride has been running well, though the founder admits it has been a mountain of work to get to this point for the fledgling foundation.\n\n\u201cI eat, sleep, and dream Rite to Ride. It\u2019s all coming to fruition.\u201d\n\nRite to Ride is a new not-for-profit launched by Mr. Publikover earlier this year. The goals of the Rite to Ride Foundation are to provide a safe environment for children to participate and excel in snowboarding, skateboarding and community involvement, to give them opportunities to learn skills in leadership, community outreach, and fundraising, to provide assistance to snowboarders and skateboarders in the organization with equipment to aid in skill progression, and to provide children with outstanding teachers, instructors, coaches and friends.\n\n\u201cMy goal is not to make the next Olympic level skateboarder or snowboarder. My goal is to make them a well-rounded individual where they can choose whatever path they decide to take, as long as it\u2019s with a smile on their face and general well-being of those around them in hand,\u201d Mr. Publikover said.\n\nRite to Ride has been focused on a pilot group of children so far, though there is opportunity for other kids to join in at the skatepark. As he explained on the group\u2019s Facebook page recently: \u201cWe have been meeting up on Saturdays, and we generally spend half of the time in the skatepark, and half in the community. Any and all are welcome to attend and join @ the skatepark, however only the \u201cPilot group\u201d can partake in the community aspect, and the main reason being, there is only one coach right now on Saturdays and 8 children out on the streets is a handful, albeit a wonderful handful haha. Once school concludes, our July and August format will be much more abundant!\u201d\n\nMr. Publikover has plans to open up the program to other kids for a summer camp. The newsletter will be $5 for a digital copy, $10 for a hard copy, with the first newsletter set to launch at the end of June.

You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others.\" Share love by donating socks through Socks for Seniors in their 10th annual Sock Drive, now through December 23.\n\nCommunity leaders, volunteers, and dedicated families have been involved with Socks for Seniors for ten years, watching it become a nationwide network. Since 2002, over 250 communities worldwide have teamed up with Socks for Seniors, opening their hearts to volunteering, sock distributions, and sponsoring sock hops.\n\nOrganization founder Kitty Coyne said, \"We have one priority this season and that is to bring holiday cheer along with a new pair of socks to warm the hearts and cover the cold feet of our elderly seniors.\"\n\nThe Socks for Seniors Program encourages individuals to not only personally donate socks, but to become involved in a sock drive. It all starts with one person, a box, and a location. The socks will stay in the local Fremont area. If volunteers have a nursing home, assisted living center or other senior community in mind for distribution, that is great news. If not, Socks for Seniors will help connect those eager volunteers with a local senior community for distributing the socks at the end of the sock drive.\n\nProgram area coordinators are encouraged to create a theme for their sock drive as well as take pictures of their decorated sock boxes and event sites. \"It is fun to collect the funkier, holiday style socks you can find, along with traditional tube socks as well,\" Coyne said.\n\nThe holidays can be a bittersweet time for seniors who feel lonesome, so bring joy to their hearts and uplift their spirits with a kind donation of socks.\n\nFor more information or to register local churches, senior centers or civic groups in a sock drive, visit\n\nHome\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Protective Services Classifieds\u00a0\u00a0 Community Resources\u00a0\u00a0 Archived Issues\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout Us\u00a0\u00a0 Advertising\u00a0\u00a0 Comments\u00a0\u00a0 Subscribe\u00a0\u00a0 TCV Store\u00a0\u00a0 Contact\n\nTri Cities Voice What's Happening - click to return to home page\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Tri-City Voice",

Award-winning actress Dawn Zulueta, women and youth issues advocate Sen. Pia Cayetano, socialite and columnist Tessa Prieto-Valdez, and sought-after celebrity mom Carmina Villaroel \u2013 the fab quad who lead today\u2019s \u201csige moms\u201d \u2013 agree that kids will always be kids and part of it is getting literally dirty.\n\n\u201cParents nowadays get paranoid when their kids play outside. They want to keep them indoors but at the same time you don\u2019t want to compromise the opportunity for the children to learn and experience the things we experienced as kids,\u201d states Dawn. \u201cI encourage my son to play outdoors and be physically active. It does not only build his immune system but it also allows him to meet other kids. That\u2019s why we are moving from a condominium to a house of our own very soon so he can have more space to move around.\u201d\n\nThe artist in Tessa, on the other hand, echoes in the way she let her kids have their way in expressing their inclinations. \u201cIt\u2019s fun being a mom and having kids,\u201d shares Tessa, whose children were born practically decades apart, which, incidentally, allowed her to spend as much time for each of her kid. Despite the age gap and different preferences, her kids all had their share of being outdoors and pursuing their own interests. They also go to the beach during most weekends because her children are so much into wakeboarding.\n\n\nThough their thoughts were somehow clouded over the amount of dirt frolicking in the playground or going to the beach may bring, these women can now kiss their worries goodbye. There is now an all-new laundry detergent that is set to change the perception of moms on their kids exploring the world around them and dealing with the least liked household chore.\n\nBreeze with ActivBleach was developed with moms and their growing kids in mind. The global brand is now in the Philippines to help moms say goodbye to stubborn stains and at the same time increase the number of \u201csige moms\u201d such as Dawn, Sen. Pia, Tessa and Carmina.\n\n\u201cMy twins are very active. I want them to have the kind of childhood that I had. Laking kalye ako, hindi lang halata,\u201d Carmina beams. \u201cI practically let them do what they want \u2013 play with their friends, ride a bike, go swimming, play badminton. They even play with our dogs.\n\n\u201cOf course there was a time when I didn\u2019t allow them to go outdoors. That was when they were still little. Like typical moms I would say, \u2018Wag kasi madumi,\u2019 but after a while I let them be. And they also need to learn. They also need to experience na madapa o masugatan because that\u2019s how they learn,\u201d she adds.\n\nSen. Pia couldn\u2019t agree more. Known as an outdoor person, the lady solon couldn\u2019t hide the fact that her kids got her penchant for the active lifestyle. \u201cMy two girls play football in school so they really get dirty and my youngest, who is only two years old, seems following the footsteps of her ate\u2019s,\u201d she says.\n\u201cHangga\u2019t kaya, gusto ko nakakalaro talaga sa labas ang mga anak ko because they need to explore. I don\u2019t mind them getting dirty, not at all. And I think they will miss out so much on their childhood kapag masyadong maraming bawal.\u201d\n\nInspired by the findings of child development experts stating that children learn best through experience rather than through instructions, Breeze with ActivBleach is packed with a superior formulation to help moms cope with the toughest stains due to their children\u2019s various activities. It uses a 4-enzyme technology that removes more stains, and a patented whitening agent that brings perceivable whiteness right after the first wash. This fast-acting ingredient works right on target, freeing moms from worrying about stains and dirt. Breeze gives better results not just on laundry needs but also on what moms look for in a detergent that will allow them to focus more on allowing their kids learn from life experiences.\n\nA unique AD system was also added for better \u201cbula\u201d, while special melamine encaps ensure better fragrance delivery and keep laundry smelling fresh and clean.\n\nWith these technological advancements in a laundry detergent, moms can now let their kids enjoy life to the fullest through their experiential activities. The business of dealing with tough stains is now a thing of the past and just like Dawn, Sen. Pia, Tessa and Carmina, they can all say \u201cSige sa Mantsa!\u201d by simply welcoming Breeze into their homes.

        "text":"Tens of thousands of people showed up on the beach for Pride Fort Lauderdale\u2019s event on Sunday, exceeding expectations for the new venue. In fact so many showed up, the crowd threatened to overwhelm organizers \u2013 the bars ran out of liquor twice and shuttle service slowed to a crawl.\n\nDespite those minor problems most people declared the event a tremendous success. The crowd ended up being the largest in the festival\u2019s 40-year history.\n\n\u201cPeople really enjoyed the venue and the concept of what we went for,\u201d said Miik Martorell, president of Pride Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe annual LGBT celebration moved from its previous location in Holiday Park to the beach where vendors, organizations and entertainers gathered to show their rainbow colors. Because it was a free and non-ticketed event, crowd estimates were hard to figure. Organizer\u2019s though believe more than 40,000 showed up.\n\nThe destination, Martorell said, drove the masses.\n\n\u201cThe concept was to create an event that you can\u2019t get anywhere in the world,\u201d Martorell said.\n\n\u201cWe have incredible beaches and amazing weather.\u201d\n\nOf the entertainers, Martorell said Erika Jayne out did herself.\n\n\u201cShe performed\u00ad\u00ad like she really wanted to be here,\u201d Martorell said.\n\nNaturally, there were a few \u201chiccups,\u201d Martorell said. Traffic was heavy slowing the shuttle service to a crawl. The bars, likewise, were overwhelmed by the throngs of people, dressed in beach wear and swim suits.\n\n16998144 10155086976370850 1191490716455887996 n\n\n\u201cWe underestimated attendance,\u201d Martorell admitted. \u201cWe ran out of liquor twice and we have to make the event easier to get to. No one likes sitting in traffic.\u201d\n\nMartorell said volunteers from nine different Pride organizations from across America assisted with the Fort Lauderdale production.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Pride is about,\u201d Martorell said. \u201cWorking together and being proud of who we are and where we come from.\u201d\n\nOther performers throughout the day included disco-era DJ Wendy Hunt, country singer Ty Herndon, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d finalist Brian Justin Crum and local transgender teen activist Jazz Jennings, star of TLC\u2019s \u201cI Am Jazz.\u201d\n\nPride Fort Lauderdale did not take place in 2016 with the last festival being held in October of 2015, after several setbacks that delayed the event. This year the event returned to its traditional February schedule.\n\nOrganizers are already looking ahead.\n\n\u201cNext year will be bigger and even better,\u201d Martorell said.\u00a0\n\n\nCheck out Pride Fort Lauderdale Photos here.",
