        "text":"\n\nRight now, customers can only buy the Surface RT tablet at Microsoft Stores\n\nReports on Microsoft's Surface tablet have been a mixed bag lately, but All Things D is pretty clear about its position: the demand and sales just aren't there.\n\nAll Things D recently spoke with Boston-based brokerage firm Detwiler Fenton about Microsoft's Surface RT tablet. The verdict? Microsoft better get its tablet out in other stores or it's going to sink.\n\n\"Lack of distribution is killing the product,\" said Detwiler Fenton. \"Mixed reviews and a [$499] starting price tag certainly don't help, but lack of retail exposure at Best Buy and others is severely depressing sales.\"\n\nRight now, customers can only buy the Surface RT tablet at Microsoft Stores. The problem with this is that there's only 31 of them, with another 34 smaller Microsoft kiosks around the U.S.\n\nDue to this lack of presence in major retailers, Detwiler Fenton estimates that Microsoft will only sell 500,000 to 600,000 Surface RTs in the December quarter. This is a strong hit to previous estimates of 1 million to 2 million.\n\nRecently, a pair of reports from both CNET and The Seattle Times showed differing views on how Windows 8-based touchscreen tablets, convertibles and laptops are faring. CNET spoke with IDC and IHS iSuppli analysts, who said retailers were having trouble keeping them on shelves due to high demand. However, The Seattle Times begged to differ, echoing Detwiler Fenton's concerns: there just aren't very many Windows 8 tablets out yet, and those that are are impossible to find. However, other Windows 8 tablets are sold in major retailers like Best Buy; not just Microsoft Stores.\n\nMicrosoft's Surface Pro is expected to be released in January, which will feature the Windows 8 Pro operating system instead of Windows RT for ARM-based tablets.\n\nSource: All Things D\n\nComments \u00a0 \u00a0 Threshold\n\nThis article is over a month old, voting and posting comments is disabled\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy augiem on 12\/8\/2012 4:10:34 PM , Rating: 2\n*MS isn't Apple* and doesn't want to be Apple\n\nThey most certainly do want to be Apple, and VERY badly. Just about every decision they've made since Gates left has been to try to make the company and the products more and more like Apple. (LOL at the Microsoft Store KIRF. Can't you at least TRY to design something yourself??) Even years before Gates left, you could see the same trends in the evolution of Windows. Now far more than ever, MS just plays \"me too\" to Apple's game, though now they're trying to even push ahead of Apple on the course they laid out bu unifying their OSs into a tablet-centric, walled-garden console model with a software distribution monopoly. It's really sad. MS = Apple, Jr.\n\nBallmer and all these analysts are fools to think that with 30 years of multi-billion dollar profits every year, they need to completely reinvent the company to imitate Apple's short-lived, but glorious 5-year success story. Apple is in the entertainment and fashion business, which is an inherantly unstable and fickle market.\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy TakinYourPoints on 12\/8\/2012 4:53:36 PM , Rating: 3\nMicrosoft has been playing \"me too\" to Apple for about thirty years, this is nothing new. The main difference here is that they're finally playing catch-up to new markets (portable integrated devices and high end laptops) that are far more profitable than the old desktop model that has sustained them for so long.\n\nThe execution with Windows 8 may be flawed but their thinking is sound, given the explosion in portable devices.\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy inighthawki on 12\/8\/2012 6:56:01 PM , Rating: 3\n30 years? Microsoft may have more or less stolen some ideas from them early on, but market share of PCs shows that for a huge chunk of the middle of that time, Apple has clearly been playing catchup with MS. Only recently with the iPhone and iPad have they really done anything that has caught on.\n\nBy TakinYourPoints on 12\/8\/2012 11:37:08 PM , Rating: 5\nThere is a difference between catching up on sales and catching up on execution. I only have about ten years experience with Macs compared to over twenty years with Microsoft operating systems, but in the time waiting for Vista there were many changes that happened in OS X (10.3 and 10.4 in particular) that Microsoft were clearly inspired by when it came to Vista and Windows 7.\n\nYou don't even need to look at the products (Windows, Zune, Surface), they were clearly paying attention based on internal email:\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy Argon18 on 12\/10\/2012 3:18:07 PM , Rating: 1\nApple playing catch-up to MS? Hardly. Microsoft is criticized for being late to market (i.e. playing \"catch up\") in nearly every market they enter. Tablets, Phones, heck even entering the browser market, Microsoft was mocked for being late to release Internet Explorer.\n\nAnd when it comes to Operating Systems, Apple has leapfrogged Microsoft altogether. OSX is vastly superior to Windows because it's based on UNIX. The old OS9 and prior were crap - Apple had the wisdom to realize that. Rather than try to hack it together, they tossed the whole thing in the trash and started anew with OSX. It's light years ahead of the antiquated Windows OS model.\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy wordsworm on 12\/8\/2012 11:52:25 PM , Rating: 2\nI don't agree. Microsoft has been about giving power to the consumer. The consumer has always had the choice of buying software from anyone who wants to make it. Apple has a process. Microsoft made, and still makes, an OS that runs on any adequate machine. Apple does not.\n\nI do not like Windows mobile. I am sure the next phone I have will have an Intel\/W8 (desktop version) combination. I can run BlueStacks if I want to run Android apps, while having a real operating system at my disposal. I'd like to see one of those on the menu of a major telecom in Canada.\n\nI haven't tried a W8 phone yet, so maybe it's better than W7? I do believe W8 is hands down their best desktop OS. It is simply the best OS I have ever had. It's fast, all the things that bugged me early on I've adapted to. I don't know if the naysayers to W8 have really given it a fair shake.\n\nmy 2c.\n\nJust to add: I do see MS emulating Apple. They are going from the open garden that has served them well to the closed garden. I hope they will take a cue from Google and realize that it's the open garden concept which is the most popular now, not Apple's closed garden.\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy MadMan007 on 12\/9\/2012 1:11:43 AM , Rating: 2\nWindows 8 will never get a fair shot from the enthusiast community, but its slightly tweaked successor will be the 'best OS ever!'

Hardware enthusiasts don't always upgrade to bleeding edge technology.\n\nIt's common to do so with something like a CPU or GPU, because this years model is just the same thing with a 5% speed bump over last years model across the board. As soon as hardware changes, that's not always the case.\n\nLook at the switch from HDD to SSD. SSDs at the time only provided a few benefits, but often had horrible random reads\/writes, could be unstable, and would cost a fortune.\n\nIf suddenly hardware had a bunch of changes that changed the way we used it, it would have the same impact. Imagine everyone switched from x86 to a new proprietary architecture. Maybe it's faster clock for clock and more efficient or something - objective better than x86 in every way, but it can't run the software you want, it might be harder to develop for, etc. Not even the biggest enthusiasts are going to buy it because it's \"new and better\" if it requires such a large change.\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy Cheesew1z69 on 12\/9\/2012 3:52:27 PM , Rating: 2\nA lot of people were (and some still are) hesitant to actually make use of their 64-bit processor by installing a 64-bit build of windows due to various reasons (Higher memory requirement, and there still exist a couple compatibility issues),\n64 bit does not have a \"higher memory requirement\"...\n\nRE: sigh, brokers and analysts\nBy inighthawki on 12\/9\/2012 4:43:38 PM , Rating: 2\n64-bit windows uses more memory than 32-bit due to larger binaries and extra binaries loaded for things like WOW64.

I connected up the VDD and GND to a bench power supply as others have noted that these chips need quite a bit of power. I also needed to connect the CH_PD pin to 3.3V to enable the chip. Just on standby, the chip consumes about 70mA.\u00a0\n\n    I connected the TX and RX lines to my Sparkfun FTDI Basic and fired up Putty\u00a0just to test out some commands before I hook it up to a chipKIT. I have to talk to the chip over 115200 Baud, and 57600\u00a0does not work. I received READY in my Putty terminal and sent AT+RST. The chip spit out a bunch of boot up text which I will include later when I write a post showing the response of all of the commands. I sent AT+CWLAP and nothing... at first I received ERROR. I sent it a couple more times and actually got the chip to list the access points! I tried connecting to my wifi router, but I entered the password wrong and still received OK. I tried sending the inquiry if I was connected and the chip hung up and any command I sent after that said it was busy. All further attempts to send AT+CWLAP hang up the chip.\n\n    So I would say so far, the chip isn't as easy to use out of the box as others have stated. I will investigate further and send some more commands and write up a post detailing how the chip responds.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Work still in progress...\n\n    bafeigum09\/11\/2014 at 17:04 1 comment\n\n    I am still awaiting the arrival of the modules I ordered from AliExpress.

Peter has been active in the comments and has successfully sent TCP data.\u00a0\n\n    I will provide another update when I receive the modules and being work on the library. I was originally going to write the library for the MSP430 microcontrollers, but it looks like many people who have received their modules are using the Arduino. I might create the library for the Arduino first so that I can get the most amount of people debugging the library. I will eventually port the library to both platforms.\n\n  \u2022 More AT Command Information Found\n\n    bafeigum08\/29\/2014 at 02:28 0 comments\n\n    So looking around on this German forum post about the ESP8266\n\n\n    I saw that somebody translated the Chinese AT command pdf (into German which google than translated into English for me). The translation this person posted had much more information about the chip than I had seen before! I had assumed that the Nurdspace page everybody is probably already very familiar with\n\n\n    was translated from the same document and was all the information we had so I didn't bother taking a look at the actual document in Chinese. It seemed like it would be just BARELY enough to get a good library going, however a lot of information was missing like possible return values and the returned data format. It wouldn't have been impossible to figure this stuff out after getting the chip, but it would have taken longer just poking around.\n\n    Read on to see the translated document and what to expect from the List Access Points Command.\n\n    Read more \u00bb\n\n  \u2022 Two ESP8266 Modules Ordered\n\n    bafeigum08\/27\/2014 at 17:56 0 comments\n\n    I just placed an order for two ESP8266 Modules from AliExpress for $9.50 including free shipping.

        "text":"Memory Configuration (continued)\n\nOur benchmarks in Part 1 were consistent with the configuration recommendations in the Intel White Papers for Memory Configuration of the 875 and 865 chipsets. We concluded with the following performance charts based on our testing and the information provided by Intel. We differ from the Intel White Paper charts only in the first and second positions for the Intel 865 chipset. When Intel published their White Papers, we doubt that they had any notion that most of the 865 motherboards being sold would have some version of PAT (Performance Acceleration Technology) on board. Our testing of the ASUS, AOpen, and DFI PAT-enabled boards shows that the PAT 865 boards behave more like 875 boards. We have confirmed that the first and second positions on PAT-enabled 865 boards are, as we report, below \u2014 with four DS DIMMs performing faster than two DS DIMMs.\n\nDDR400 (1:1) Performance DIMM Configuration Single-Channel or Dual-Channel\n1 4 DS Dual Channel\n2 2 DS or 4 SS Dual Channel\n3 2 SS Dual Channel\n4 4 SS\/DS\nMixed Matched Pairs\nDual Channel\n5 Any DS Single Channel\n6 Any SS Single Channel\n\nDDR333\/266 Performance DIMM Configuration Single-Channel or Dual-Channel\n1 2 DS or 4 SS Dual Channel\n2 2 SS Dual Channel\n3 4 DS Dual Channel\n4 4 SS\/DS\nMixed Matched Pairs\nDual Channel\n5 Any 1 or 2 DS or SS\n(1 DIMM or 1 in each Channel)\nSingle Channel\n6 Any 1 SS Single Channel\n\nWhile SiSoft Sandra UNBuffered Memory Test results demonstrated real differences in performance among these memory configurations, many of you asked what we might see in real-world performance differences with these different memory configurations.\n\nSome of the configurations were easier to test than others. Kingston had provided us with four Single-Bank (single-sided) DDR500 DIMMs that allowed us to look at performance differences in two SS DIMMs versus four SS DIMMs. We looked at performance of 1000FSB\/DDR500 at 3-4-4-7-1 memory timings at 2.65V.\n\n1000FSB (3.0GHz)\/DDR500 Performance \u2014 Kingston PC4000\n2 x 256 MB SS DIMMs vs. 4 x 256 MB SS DIMMs\nNumber of Single-Bank DIMMs Quake3\nSandra UNBuffered Sandra Standard\nSuper PI 2M places\n(time in sec)\n2 386.30 INT 2821\nFLT 2786\nINT 5830\nFLT 5748\n4 394.57 INT 3218\nFLT 3195\nINT 5841\nFLT 5818\n\nWhile the differences in Quake3 frame rate and Super PI times are small, keep in mind that the only change here is using four SS DIMMs instead of two SS DIMMs. As predicted by Sandra UNBuffered Memory Test, the four SS DIMMs perform better than two SS DIMMs.\n\nComparing two SS DIMMs to two DS DIMMs was done using 2 x 256 MB SS OCZ PC4000 and 2 x 512 MB DS PC4000 at timings of 2.5-3-4-6 at 2.65V. It is almost impossible to keep DIMM capacity the same, which would be the most accurate test, as none of the samples using the same memory chips would have the same exact capacity in SS and DS configurations.\n\n1000FSB (3.0GHz)\/DDR500 Performance \u2014 OCZ PC4000\n2 x 256 MB SS DIMMs vs. 2 x 512 MB DS DIMMs\nNumber of DIMMs & Configuration Quake3\nSandra UNBuffered Sandra Standard\nSuper PI\n2M places\n(time in sec)\n2 SS 392.30 INT 2918\nFLT 2926\nINT 5761\nFLT 5868\n2 DS 400.10 INT 3282\nFLT 3324\nINT 5965\nFLT 5934\n\nAgain, the differences are small but real in Quake3 and Super PI, but with 2 DS DIMMs performing better as we had demonstrated in Part 1 with the Sandra UNBuffered Memory Test.\n\nThe fastest configuration should be 4 Double-Bank DIMMs on the Intel 875 chipset motherboard. Our first efforts to test this configuration, with 4 x 256 DS OCZ 3700 GOLD modules did not show 4 DS DIMMs any faster than 2 DS DIMMs on the ASUS P4C800-E. This was a real puzzle considering that other predicted configurations were easily verified with Quake3, Super PI and other benchmarks. When we looked deeper, the problem became clear. In every configuration that we had tested with the ASUS P4C800-E, the Performance Mode showed \u201cenabled\u201d but with 4 DS DIMMs at any FSB speed faster than 800, CPU-Z 1.18C shows Performance Mode \u201cdisabled\u201d. Our trial was failing here because we were comparing 2 DS DIMMs with PAT on to 4 DS DIMMs with PAT off. We have asked ASUS for the reason behind why PAT appears to be disabled at 4 DS DIMMs above 800FSB.\n\nSince we were mainly concerned with comparing 2 DS with 4 DS DIMMs under the same conditions, we ran 2 DS vs. 4 DS tests at 800FSB\/DDR400, so that PAT was enabled in both two and four DIMM setups. We compared prototypes of high-speed PC3700 memory that we tested, looking specifically at the performance of 2 x 512 MB DS to 4 x 512 MB DS at DDR400. Timings were 2-2-4-8 at 2.75V.\n\n800FSB (2.4GHz)\/DDR400 Performance\n2 x 512 DS vs. 4 x 512 DS\nNumber of DS DIMMs Quake3\nFlyby fps\nBotmatch fps\nSandra UNBuffered Sandra Standard\nSuper PI 2M places (time in sec)\n2 321.4 196.30 68.31 INT 2683\nFLT 2722\nINT 4704\nFLT 4691\n4 324.5 197.60 69.38 INT 2830\nFLT 2923\nINT 4678\nFLT 4717\n\nWhile the differences here are quite small, they still show 4 DS modules performing better than 2 DS modules. We suspect that we would see larger differences at higher speed, as we have in our other comparisons.\n\nWe have confirmed with game benchmarks and a number-crunching benchmark that the best 875\/865 memory configurations can also be seen in real-world benchmarks. Because memory performance is only one component of game performance and overall system bandwidth, the effect on these benchmarks is, as expected, smaller than the variation seen in benchmarks that measure only memory performance, like Sandra UNBuffered Memory Test.\n\nDoes Memory Speed really matter in the Real World?

Unfortunately it has not performed to its specification. Can you tell me if there is a special part number I should look for to get their special 'reviewers golden sample' ?\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous User - Saturday, August 30, 2003 - link\n\n    I think if you have a cpu that will do 250 FSB and you purchase memory based on this article and you get within 98% of the results posted in this article, you owe Wesley $10.00. If 20% of the people with favorable results donated, there would be no more need to advertise. Now for the people who did not purchase ram based on this article and are bitching about it being bias, what are you bitching for?. This article has not cost you a cent.\n\n    Thanks Wesley, you saved me a $100 on ram. I almost got caught up in all the hype about 4000 and 4200.\n\n  \u2022 Anonymous User - Saturday, August 30, 2003 - link\n\n    This article goes part way to answering the question of what memory configuration is fastest but I was disappointed that there was no variation in ratio.\n\n    I would like to see a review that tests agressive timings against high frequency to see what produces the best results.\n\n    Also a test of all P4C chips running @ 3.6Ghz to see whether there's any benefit in buying the fastest chip.\n\n    With most motherboards easily hitting 1Ghz are we likely to be seeing a P4D which supports a 1066Mhz FSB?\n  \u2022 Anonymous User - Friday, August 29, 2003 - link\n\n    I think the way to do these reviews is to tell the manufacturer you'd like to include them in a review, purchase the memory from a store you trust, and then get re-imbursed by the manufacturer. That way, there'd be no selected modules and you would know what you were going to put into the review (4 ss vs 2 ds).\n\n    So, when do we get that part 2 of the 865\/875 mobo roundup ?\n  \u2022 retrospooty - Friday, August 29, 2003 - link\n\n\n    I have run these tests myself on an IC7G at 200 , 230 250 and 280 FSB and found that 5:4 2-2-2 always beats 1:1 at 2.5-4-4, even 2.5 4-3 ... However SOME motherboards arent as efficient at 5:4 with some types of ram as others... If you try the same test on several different mobo's I think you will find that 5:4 2-2-2 is quite a bit faster in non-synthetic mem test benchmarks.\n\n    Oldfart # 64, you are right about the reviewers and using the synthetic tests to boost sales. good point.\n  \u2022 Anonymous User - Friday, August 29, 2003 - link\n\n    If your not going to overclock, get low latency pc 3200 or 3500, the PC4000 wont help you at all\n\n    even IF you ARE going to overclock, the PC4000 will not likely get you better performance.\n  \u2022 Anonymous User - Friday, August 29, 2003 - link\n\n    #67 I'm not an expert by any means but here is how I understand this discussion:\n    If you are planning to use one of the faster processors such as the 3.0C you won't be able to achieve a big overclock because the multiplier for that processor is 15. If you want to use a higher speed processor such as the 2.8C or the 3.0c, you really dont need to spend the money on faster memory such as the PC4000 because you probably won't be able to overclock to a point that you will be able to reach a front side bus speed of 250mhz which is the lowest rated speed (x2=ddr500) of the memory module. So as the article has explained,you would be better off with\n    slower ram that has faster timings. However, if you have a slower processor such as the 2.4C or the 2.6C, you should be able to achieve a higher overclock because these processors have l... (truncated)",

You still won't have an absolute picture but you'll have a better clue as to how good the game is. I agree that you really need to wait untill actual end users have the game in hand and report on their experiences.\n\nI found the same problem with a lot of hardware reviews (thank Beaver I found this site) when I started looking into buying the parts for my first rig. According to the reviews I read the nvidia 650 boards were the 2nd coming and I almost went that route. Then I checked out some forums and ditched that idea fast.\n\nA lot of reviews are nothing more than the slightly re-worded OEM press release IMO (not here). For games, beleave the gamers not the advertizers.\nASUS P5Q-E - E8400 (4GHz) - Corsair TX650W - 2xHIS HD 4850 IceQ Turbo - 2x2GB Mushkin Ascent 8000 - 2xWD 500GB - TRUE 120 - Antec 1200 - ASUS Xonar DX - Big Smile\nReply With Quote",
