        "text":"Snow Emergencies\n\nSnow Plowing\n\nStreets are plowed based on priority. That is, major thoroughfares (such as Main Street or Wenger Road) are plowed first. Fire routes (side streets, etc.) are second priority. The final priority is cul de sacs and dead end roads.\n\nTo protect the environment and reduce the use of road salt, the City of Englewood employs a method of pre-treating roadways prior to predicted weather events using salt brine and\/or beet juice. These substances inhibit ice from forming on the roads, thereby reducing the amount of road salt used during and after the weather event. Less salt usage means less salt residue getting into the storm drains which empty directly into the creeks and river.\n\nSnow Emergency Ordinance\n\nSection 404.09 - Removal of Vehicles From Streets During Periods of Emergency\n\nPer Section 404.09 of the City of Englewood \"Codified Ordinances\" (Removal of Vehicles From Streets During Periods of Emergency), whenever, in the opinion of the City Manager, there is an actual or threatened local emergency, such as a riot, fire, flood, excessive snowfall, other Acts of God, common disaster or acts of the enemy, the City Manager may require the removal of motor vehicles parked upon the affected street(s) of the City. Snowfall in Excess of Three (3) Inches in a Twenty-Four (24) Hour Period is Considered Excessive. Vehicles Shall Be Removed From All Streets for at Least Forty-Eight (48) Hours After a Snow Emergency is Declared. The City Manager shall inform the public of the aforementioned conditions through reasonable and usual methods of communication. If the owner or operator of the vehicles does not remove it within a reasonable time, the vehicles may be removed by the Police Department at the owner's expense. (Ordinance 79-09 Passed 2\/14\/79)\n\nSection 412.07 - Placement of Snow or Ice in Public Right-of-Ways\n\n(A) No privately operated snow removal service shall place or leave any snow or ice in the public right-of-way of any dedicated street or ally in the City.\n(B) No individual shall cause snow to be shoveled, plowed, pushed or otherwise be placed upon any public right-of-way creating a traffic or pedestrian obstruction once it has been cleared or removed by City forces.

(LHSA), has filed a verified notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1150.31 for the acquisition of approximately 24.74 miles of rail line from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), in Wayne and Pike Counties, PA. The line, known as the Honesdale Branch, extends from milepost 110.26, in Lackawaxen, PA, to milepost 135.00, in Honesdale, PA. The Honesdale Branch was conveyed by PennDOT to LHSA on January 31, 2003.[1] Due to lack of familiarity with the Board's regulatory requirements, LHSA failed to obtain acquisition authority on an exemption for the transaction. Accordingly, to rectify that omission, LHSA files this notice of exemption from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10901.\n\nLHSA certifies that its projected revenues as a result of the transaction will not result in LHSA becoming a Class II or Class I rail carrier.\n\nThe exemption became effective on June 21, 2006 (7 days after the exemption was filed).\n\nIf the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction.\n\nAn original and 10 copies of all pleadings, referring to STB Finance Docket No. 34891, must be filed with the Surface Transportation Board, 1925 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20423-0001.

This new law provides new tools that are intended to improve project delivery by enabling the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and its modal agencies, other Federal departments and agencies, and the States to expedite important infrastructure projects without sacrificing quality.\n\nAs the President has recognized in Executive Order 13604, entitled Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects (March 22, 2012), our Federal permitting and review processes must provide a transparent, consistent, and predictable path for both project sponsors and affected communities. Our goal in implementing this law and this Administration's permitting reforms is to provide demonstrable improvements in the performance of Federal infrastructure permitting and review processes, including more timely and efficient decisions. Most importantly, we seek to use the environmental review process to deliver better and more sustainable projects that result in a healthier and cleaner environment.\n\nIn implementing this law, we will adhere to the following principles:\n\n  1. DOT will implement MAP-21 in a way that utilizes the National Environmental Policy Act and other Federal environmental statutes to promote better environmental outcomes, improve transparency, and support informed decision-making.\n  2. DOT will promote environmental stewardship, transparency, and early inter-agency consultation and collaboration as it carries out all of the new mandates included in MAP-21.\n  3. DOT will encourage early collaboration among agencies, project sponsors, affected stakeholders and the public, both in the transportation planning process and in project development, to avoid adverse impacts to communities and the environment, minimize or mitigate impacts that may occur, and avoid project delay.\n  4. For greater transparency and accountability, DOT will utilize cost-effective information technology to collect and disseminate information about individual projects and agency performance and to fully consider the priorities and concerns of affected communities.\n  5. In developing schedules for projects, DOT will ensure that the timing for decisionmaking regarding any required actions, such as permits and licenses, must be consistent with applicable regulations governing coordinating with cooperating agencies.\n  6. DOT will encourage planning and project development procedures that avoid disputes and resolve any that do arise early in the process, avoiding unnecessary elevation wherever possible.\n\nWe appreciate the engagement and help that you and your staff have provided already to help us meet tight deadlines while producing better projects and better environmental results. We look forward to continuing our relationship while working to implement this Act.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRay LaHood\n\nDownload a PDF of the signed letter: principles.pdf (831 KB)\n\nTo view PDF files, you can use the Acrobat\u00ae Reader\u00ae.\n\nPage last modified on September 12, 2013.\nFederal Highway Administration | 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE | Washington, DC 20590 | 202-366-4000",

The PTCSP describes UP's I-ETMS implementation and the associated I-ETMS safety processes, safety analyses, and test, validation, and verification processes used during development of I-ETMS. The PTCSP also contains UP's operational and support requirements and procedures.\n\nUP's PTCSP and the accompanying request for approval and system certification are available for review online at (Docket No. FRA-2010-0061) and in person at the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Docket Operations Facility, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., W12-140, Washington, DC 20590.

See 49 CFR 236.1011(e). During its review of the PTCSP, FRA will consider any comments or data submitted. However, FRA may elect not to respond to any particular comment and, under 49 CFR 236.1009(d)(3), FRA maintains the authority to approve or disapprove the PTCSP at its sole discretion. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing regarding UP's PTCSP because the circumstances do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, the party should notify FRA in writing before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for his or her request.\n\nPrivacy Act Notice\n\nAnyone can search the electronic form of any written communications and comments received into any of our dockets by the name of the individual submitting the comment (or signing the document, if submitted on behalf of an association, business, labor union, etc.).
