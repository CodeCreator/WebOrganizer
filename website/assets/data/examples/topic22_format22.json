        "text":"The Simple Guide To Buying The Perfect Used Car\n\nused cars, cars, tips, buying\n\nBuying a car is a big step for any driver to take. Whether it\u2019s your first vehicle or one to replace your current motor, the sense of excitement is unrivaled. However, the process also comes with great responsibility.\n\nAfter all, this is probably the biggest financial purchase you\u2019ll make all year. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative that you make the right decision. That pressure can make the procedure feel daunting. But the growth of the used car market means you\u2019ve got a better chance than ever of finding the perfect match.\n\nNevertheless, buying previously owned cars comes with its own set of issues. Here is how you can ensure that you don\u2019t get taken for a ride.\n\nFind The Right Motor The first step to ensuring that you find the right car is to find the perfect model. Shopping on the used market will open up your options greatly, which should give you a far better chance of finding the one for you.\n\nThere\u2019s a world of information at your fingertips. Researching the possibilities is a must if you want to make the right choice. If you\u2019ve settled for a manufacturer but haven\u2019t pinpointed an exact model, it could be worth speaking to an expert. A Mercedes dealership, for example, can give you far better insight into their different options.\n\nThis is not a decision that can be rushed. Patience is vital.\n\nDon\u2019t Buy Private \u2013 It can be tempting to buy a car from Gumtree to get a slightly cheaper price. But for peace of mind alone, it\u2019s always worth choosing a trusted dealership.\n\nBuying privately could leave you vulnerable to being left with an inadequate vehicle. Using a dealer will give you a far greater sense of security. Besides, you\u2019ll also be able to take other models for a test drive to see if any of them are more suited to your needs.\n\nMany dealers offer greater financial options too. Choosing the most suitable package can make the whole process far less stressful.\n\nCheck Paperwork \u2013 Buying a used car brings many benefits over the brand new market. However, the one major downside is that you can never be sure how it has been treated by previous owners.\n\nTherefore, a full service history is extremely advantageous. Not having it shouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent a purchase, but major gaps are a cause for concern. Again, buying from a dealer can take away some of the associated fears.\n\nIf you are still having serious doubts, don\u2019t be afraid to look around for another car. The last thing you want is to make a decision that you\u2019ll later regret.\n\nLook After It \u2013 Even if the car is in great condition, it will require love and affection if you are to keep it in great health. In truth, you should want to take care of it anyway.\n\nAs well as encouraging better performance, you want to consider depreciation. Knowing how to help the car retain its value could make a huge impact later down the line. If nothing else, it should encourage you to keep the car in good general health too.\n\nThere\u2019s not much point in buying the car if you aren\u2019t going to look after it. Employ good habits from the start and it will soon become second nature.\n\n\nOne Comment Add yours\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"A Guide to Gifting, Assigning or Selling a Private Number Plate\n\nShare this article:\n\nThere are some that don't give a second thought to their car's registration number. To them, it's just a random combination of letters and numbers. To others, a number plate is a way to\u00a0express individuality. Personalised Plates can be used to reflect things like a driver's name, profession, or hobbies.\n\nIt could be possible that you have a combination of letters and numbers that another person wants or maybe you're tired of yours and want to sell it to get another one. Here is a guide to selling a private number plate and how to assign it to another person.\n\n\n1. Finding out How Much Your Plate is Worth\n\nIf you decide on selling a private number plate, then chances are you're probably going to contact a dealer to get a quote.\n\nMost dealers can give you a quote online and others will have to post it to you, but it will work pretty much the same. For some automated\u00a0online systems, sometimes they won't recognise the significance a plate has. If that happens, you shouldn't get angry, just contact the dealer to explain.\n\nThe quote you receive will be the money that comes back to you once a buyer for the plate is found. It's a pretty simple process that you should do before jumping in and selling your plate. It's good to know if the price will be worth the hassle.\n\n\n2. Selling Your Private Number\n\nYou can use a private number to either sell your plate yourself or go through a dealer. Just make sure that you don't scan or share a photograph of the V750 or V778. This will leave an opening for someone other than the buyer to use it and put the private number on another vehicle.\n\nSelling Yourself\n\nAfter you find a buyer you will need to assign your number to their vehicle yourself. That sounds like it might be annoying but it's actually a pretty simple process. If you want the power to get everything done placed in your hands then you might want to go this route.\n\nGoing Through a Dealer\n\nMost dealers will find a buyer, arrange the payment, and assign the number to the buyer's vehicle for you. It's a pretty convenient process.\n\nMany dealers actually won't even charge you to sell your plate through their website unless you sign up for a premium package. Once it's listed on the website the buyer will pay you, pay commission for the dealer, and the price for the transfer.\n\nThis option is good if you just want to post your number up and then forget about it until there's money\u00a0in your hand. It might be a bad option if you were wanting a little more control in the matter.\n\n\n3. What Happens When a Buyer Has Found Your Number Plate\n\nIf a buyer is found and a deal is reached, then you will get a written confirmation about the procedure.\n\nThe dealer will ask you for your\u00a0V5C registration Certificate\u00a0(log book). If your registration is on a certificate, your V778 (Retention Certificate) or your V750 (Certificate of Entitlement). On top of one of these, you will also be asked for the authorisation to administer the certificate.\n\nThe dealer should always be holding cleared funds from the buyer before proceeding with the transfer and will clearly state when you should receive the payment. The dealer will also check and submit all relevant documents to DVLA. Please keep in mind that a reputable dealer like ourselves will explain the entire process to you.\n\n\n4. Assigning Your Number to Someone Else\n\nYou can put your private number on someone else's vehicle via online or through post. Either way,\u00a0the DVLA\u00a0will send you a replacement logbook for the vehicle but with a new private number shown on\u00a0it.\n\n\nTo assign your private number online, all you have to do is get details from the other vehicle's log book (V5C), and your V778, or V750. After you have that, just plug in the information accordingly.\n\nBy Post\n\nIf you want to send it by post then you need to send the DLVA a little bit of paperwork.\n\nThey will need your V778 or V750 form- Fill out sections 1 and 2 and sign it. They will also need the V5C of the vehicle you want to put the private number on. The address for the DLVA can be found on these forms.\n\n\n5. What To Do If You're in a Hurry To Sell\n\nIf you're desperate in selling a private number plate in a hurry then there is a possible option for you. Keep in mind that it's probably the one that will bring you the least amount of money.\n\nYou can contact a dealer and ask if they would be interested in buying it into stock\u00a0for quick cash.\n\nAlso, if you're sitting on a really rare plate that you don't want to sell yet then a pawn loan might be another\u00a0option for you. You'll be able to pawn your number plate and then get it back once you're able to pay the loan off.\n\n\nAll You Need to Know About Selling a Private Number Plate\n\nThis is all you need to know about selling a private number plate. You can go through a dealer or sell it yourself. A dealer makes things a little easier because they do everything for you. If you have the right paperwork you can sell right away and make some pretty quick cash once a buyer is found.\n\nIf you're ready to sell your number plate today,\u00a0contact us\u00a0to see how we can help you.",

Ensuring that your car\u2019s wheels are correctly aligned is one of the important checks that is done when you have your annual vehicle service. Wheels can easily become misaligned if you hit a kerb or pothole, or due to wear on your steering and suspension components.\n\nGetting To Know Wheel Alignment \u2013 What are the effects of misaligned wheels?\n\nIf you feel your car pulling to the side or strong vibrations can be felt through in the steering wheel, then it could mean the wheel alignment is out. Tyres wearing unevenly is another common symptom.\n\nGetting To Know Wheel Alignment \u2013 How does wheel alignment work?\n\nAll four wheels are usually aligned together using high-definition sensors that measure the position and angle of each wheel. A computer analyses 12 or more angles and compares them to the data specified by the manufacturer.\n\nGetting To Know Wheel Alignment \u2013 What do the wheel alignment terms mean?\n\nSome terms associated with wheel alignment are:\n\n\u201cCamber\u201d \u2013 the inward or outward tilt of the wheel. The amount is measured in degrees from vertical.\n\n\u201cPositive camber\u201d \u2013 when the wheels tilt outwards at the top. Too much will result in extra wear on the outside of the tyres and can damage suspension components.\n\n\u201cNegative camber\u201d \u2013 when the top of the wheel tilts inwards. Too much negative camber results in premature wear on the inside of a tyre.\n\n\u201cToe\u201d \u2013 this refers to whether the fronts of the tyres are closer or further apart than the rears. The purpose is to make the wheels roll parallel to one another. Positive toe means the wheels are turned in; negative to is when the wheels are turned out. The actual amount of toe is only a fraction of a degree normally.\n\nGetting To Know Wheel Alignment \u2013 What does the wheel alignment print out mean?\n\nAfter the wheel alignment has been done, you receive a printed report showing the measurements before and after. All the boxes should be green, meaning that the angles now meet the manufacturer\u2019s specification. If anything is red, they do not. A black arrow above each box shows how close the angle is to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parameters.\n\nFor a free\u00a0Ellesmere Port car repairs,Ellesmere Port wheel alignment or Ellesmere Port wheel balancing quote just give us a call on 0151 339 0101 or pop in so we can re-adjust your tracking to ensure it is correct, thus prolonging the life of your Ellesmere Port tyres.",

Feel free to link to this page as you feel necessary.\n\nThis page was originally designed at the following URL: http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/fordf150p0171p0174fix\/Home\/\n\nContact Information\n\nI enjoyed working on this project, and I think I understand the frustration that other V6 F150 owners feel. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, clarifications, or additions, please contact me.\n\nMy email address is wchong4 [at] gmail [dot] com. (Sorry, but spammers are just too smart nowadays.)\n\nUpdate [3\/12\/2009]\n\nWell, I am glad to report that 1.5 months later and over 3,000 miles after this fix, I have not had any check engine lights appear. We have had weather fluctuations from below freezing to mid 80s, and it appears that the new isolator bolts are holding strong and nothing has warped. My driving conditions are about 70% city, 30% highway, which I think is a common ratio for most of us. If anything, more city driving means more stress on the engine, so the fix is definitely holding up.\n\nI have had the pleasure of talking with some of you who have performed this procedure, so it seems that word is getting around. Please continue to refer your friends to this page if they come across the dreaded code. These are great trucks, so it would be a shame for someone to get rid of theirs because they could never get the code fixed.\n\n\n\nUpdate [6\/17\/2009]\n\nIt has now been almost half a year since I did this procedure and I can confidently say that I have NOT had the P0171\/P0174 codes come up. (or any other codes, either)\n\nI have received lots of feedback regarding this article, which I really do appreciate.\n\nKeep on truckin'\n\n\nUpdate [1\/8\/2012]\n\nWell folks, it has been 3 years and still no codes! The truck is still running as well as the day it was repaired back in 2008. Since that time I've had the opportunity to become aware of how to keep the engine running in factory new condition. Based on my experiences, the following help the most:\n\n  \u2022 Stick with OEM Motorcraft for anything powertrain related. In particular, I've found that Motorcraft spark plug wires and spark plugs do an excellent job of keeping the engine running smooth. The cost difference nowadays is very minimal against aftermarket parts. The Motorcraft spark plugs come pre-gapped at .054\" and that seems to work the best.\n\n  \u2022 Replace the fuel filter often! I've been replacing mine yearly, at a cost of about $12 for a Motorcraft fuel filter. You can't even change the oil for this cheap.\n\n  \u2022 Replace the belt drive idler pulleys if you notice any noise. I battled this one for a year or so and found that Motorcraft idler pulleys (2 of them, one is on the tensioner (which is bolted on using a reverse-threaded bolt!)) and a Motorcraft serpentine belt made everything very quiet again.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\n\nIf you've stumbled upon this site\n, you probably own a 2001-2004 Ford F150 with the 4.2 liter V6 engine. Anyone who owns\/drives one of these trucks is very likely to come across the dreaded P0171\/P0174 service engine soon light. A Google search for either of those terms will return thousands of pages since OBDII codes can be ridiculously vague, so drivers are left wandering in circles searching for a solution.\n\nForemost, if your F150 recently threw one of these codes for the first time, do not view the procedure shown here as your first fix. Again, OBDII codes are just stupidly vague, and your code could be due to a leaking vacuum tube or a million other things. I recommend that you perform the procedure listed here (http:\/\/www.aa1car.com\/library\/ford_lean_codes.htm) for cleaning the MAF since that is a very cheap fix. Other fixes include new O2 sensors, EGR valve replacement, PCV valve replacement, and so forth.. Ultimately it is your money, so you have to decide how to spend it.\n\nBefore we get to the actual procedure, I think it is important that we find out why these codes pop up on these trucks. Ford Windstar owners who have the 3.8 liter V6 engine have been victim of these codes for just about as long as us F150 owners, but because of the way that Ford handles TSB (technical service bulletin a.k.a database of common problems that dealerships can check to find repair information) information, Windstar owners had a TSB that actually states OBDII codes P0171\/P0174 (http:\/\/leckemby.net\/windstar\/windstar01.html). The reason why the Windstar throws these codes is twofold:\n\n  1. First, a poorly designed valve cover allows excessive oil to be sucked into the intake manifold via the PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve.\n  2. Second, the intake plenum uses \"isolator bolts\" to hold it down to the intake manifold. These isolator bolts have a sleeve that is essentially designed to allow the bolts to retain tension (keeping the plenum stuck to the manifold) and to block off any debris or oil that would enter the intake manifold via the PCV system. The original \"black isolator bolts\" that Ford put into millions of Windstars were not oil resistant and actually would harden after constant exposure. So, the badly designed valve cover allows oil to be sucked into the PCV system, which then introduces oil into the intake plenum, where it settles on these isolator bolts and weakens the sleeves and reduces the bolt tension.\nOK, so why are we discussing the Windstar minivan? Well, the 3.8L V6 in the Windstar shares engineering with the 4.2L V6 in the F150. It just happens to be that the 4.2L V6 uses the SAME isolator bolts (8 of them) and the PCV system on these trucks allows a measurable amount of oil to enter the intake manifold. Unfortunately, this wasn't really caught by Ford, in the sense that they issued a TSB that addresses OBDII codes P0171 and P0174. Instead, they have a TSB that addresses OBDII codes P1131 and P1151 (http:\/\/www.justanswer.com\/questions\/1nslx-2003-f-150-4-2-4x4-codes). The procedure it mentions to fix these codes is to replace the intake plenum port gaskets and isolator bolts.\n\nThis is where I draw my own conclusions. Since my truck threw the P0174 code in August 2008, I have searched the ends of the internet for a fix. Only recently (February 2009) did I realize the similarities between the Windstar's P0171\/P0174 and the V6 F150's P0171\/P0174. I can't recall how many internet discussions I read where F150 owners had these codes and didn't know what to do. Some just went on living with the code, as you really aren't going to notice any driveability issues. Others went to the dealership and paid $500-$700 to have a technician diagnose and repair the problem. My truck did not seem noticeably different after driving around for nearly half a year with the codes, but I'm not one to pay dealership cost for repairs and I refuse to simply \"live with\" something that could be fixed.\n\nSo, I decided that I would attempt to replace the isolator bolts and intake plenum port gaskets on my F150. The total cost was less than $100 and the procedure doesn't require any special tools or even a 2nd person to help out.\n\nRefer to the following procedure on how to replace the isolator bolts and intake plenum port gaskets on your V6 F150. I have added my tidbits of wisdom so that you can have a streamlined repair and not make some of the mistakes I did.\n\nGetting Started\n\nHere are the parts and tools you will need to complete this job:\n\nFirst, the replacement gaskets and new isolator bolts.

        "text":"Vehicle Registration and Auto Tag Information\n\nVehicle registration must take place within 45 days after you move to Myrtle Beach if you are bringing a motor vehicle into the state. This is really pretty generous considering many states only allow 30 days before you risk getting a ticket or fined.\n\nThere are several things you must do before trotting down to the DMV to get your auto tag. First you need to show you are a permanent resident by either renting or buying property in the area. Once you have a permanent address, you can get your South Carolina drivers license and register your car.\n\nVehicle Registration How To\n\nYou will need to complete Form 400, Application for Certificate of Title\/Registration, which you can download from the SCDMV website.\u00a0 Fill in the form and then take it with you to the DMV.\n\nYou will also need to show proof of insurance for South Carolina. If your insurance company can operate in the state, be sure to change your address with them before applying for South Carolina registration. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to obtain auto insurance from a company that is registered in South Carolina. There is no car inspection necessary as South Carolina does not require any smog or emission inspections on vehicles.\n\nAll cars, RVs, motorcycles, and trailers must be registered with the South Carolina DMV.\n\nWhen you go to the DMV office, be sure and have with you the vehicle title and registration from the state you have moved from, the completed Form 400, and your receipt from the Horry County tax collector that you have paid the personal property tax on your vehicle.\n\nFees vary for the type of vehicle you have, you age, and so on. It\u2019s best to check with the SCDMV here for fees that they charge.\n\nSC DMV Locations\n\nThere are four South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicle offices in Horry County. All of them issue both drivers licenses and auto tags. If you need to call ahead, each DMV phone number is listed below for that office.

        "text":"How to Fix Stalling and Other Issues After Replacing the Battery\n\nStephen Fogel\nMay 2, 2018\n\nReplacing your battery is part of every car owner\u2019s life. Every few years, you\u2019ll need a new one. But sometimes fixing one problem can cause another.\n\nReplacing the battery on some vehicles may simply be plug-and-play \u2014 just remove the old one, put in the new one, and you\u2019re on your way. But some cars can react differently when you disconnect and then reconnect the primary source of power. You may introduce a serious stalling problem along with your new battery, or at least encounter some electrical issues.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how and why this happens, how to deal with it if it happens to you, and how to prevent this situation from occurring.\n\nWhy can a new battery cause stalling?\n\nOver the past several decades, our vehicles have evolved into electronically managed mechanical devices. What were once simple, easy-to-understandters automotive systems are now controlled by sophisticated computers.\u00a0\n\nThese computers rely on a consistent power supply for optimal performance. They also require power to retain the correct memory settings that they have \u201clearned\u201d over time. These settings are saved in what is known as volatile random access memory, or VRAM.\n\nBut by disconnecting your battery when you replace it with a new one, you cut the flow of power to your vehicle\u2019s computers, if only for a short time. If the power is disconnected for too long, these computers can lose their VRAM settings, including the engine idle settings. Once those are lost, you may experience a stalling problem.\n\nIf the memory of the car\u2019s computer is erased, it will revert to default settings. These defaults are ideal for a new vehicle. But over time, your car ages and wears, and crud builds up in certain key places. Your engine computer notices these tiny, gradual changes and compensates for them.\n\nAs a driver, you don\u2019t notice these small changes, but they keep your vehicle idling smoothly as the miles pile up. By going back to the default settings, your engine can no longer idle properly. You have a problem.\n\nGet it diagnosed by a professional\n\nFixing a stalling problem after replacing your battery\n\nFortunately, your engine\u2019s computer is fully capable of relearning the correct settings. Start by making sure that your vehicle is parked on level ground with the parking brake set. The engine should be cold. All power accessories should be off, including the heat, air conditioning, audio system and interior lights. All the doors should be closed. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nStep 1: Start the car. If it feels like it\u2019s going to stall, give it some gas to maintain the idle speed. Continue to do this until your vehicle is fully warmed up (watch your temperature gauge).\u00a0\n\nStep 2A: If it\u2019s idling smoothly on its own, turn on the air conditioning to see if it still idles smoothly. This will tell you if the engine computer is compensating for the additional load from the A\/C. Use your foot to maintain the idle speed if necessary.\n\nStep 2B: If it\u2019s not idling smoothly after it warms up, take your vehicle for a 15- to 20-minute drive on the nearest open road. You may have to drive with two feet if you need to brake to slow down and use the gas to keep it idling, so don\u2019t do this in a congested area.\u00a0\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t solve the problem, call your mechanic. You may have a more complex problem than just a computer with amnesia.\n\nSevere cases of stalling after replacing the battery may require that your throttle body or your idle air control valve\u00a0be cleaned out. Over time, a large amount of carbon can build up inside these parts, pushing them beyond the limit that the computer can adapt to. Cleaning these items returns them to their original condition, and can make a big difference in how your vehicle idles and runs. Ask your mechanic if this makes sense in your situation.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Get an estimate for your car repair\n\nHow to avoid losing your memory settings\n\nEven if your car doesn\u2019t stall after a battery replacement, it may lose other settings. But there\u2019s a simple way to prevent all of these problems. A \u201cmemory saver\u201d device, when used correctly, will retain the computer memory, clock, radio presets, power seat position and many other settings.\u00a0\n\nThis device provides enough power to your system to maintain its settings when the battery is removed. Memory savers can either connect through your dashboard cigarette lighter or power port, or connect through your OBD-II diagnostic port under the dash.\n\nThe power sources used can vary, too. Some use a simple 9-volt battery to energize your system, some use their own rechargeable batteries, some use the battery of a second vehicle to provide power, and some use a wall outlet adapter.\n\nWhich type of memory saver should you use?\n\nThe first thing to check is whether your dashboard cigarette lighter or power port has power when your vehicle is turned off. If it does, you can use a memory saver with a lighter plug adaptor. If it does not, you must use the kind that connects to your OBD-II diagnostic port.\n\nWhichever type you use, read and follow all instructions, and always use the manufacturer\u2019s recommended replacement battery type and voltage.\n\nHow to use a memory saver\n\nStep 1: Turn off your vehicle.\n\nStep 2:\u00a0Connect the battery saver, following the instructions carefully.\n\nStep 3:\u00a0Disconnect the old vehicle battery and remove it.\n\nStep 4:\u00a0Insert the new vehicle battery, use a battery brush to clean the cable ends and battery posts, connect and tighten the cables, and make sure the battery is secured in place.\n\nStep 5:\u00a0Disconnect the memory saver immediately, before starting the car. You are done.\u00a0\n\nDuring this process, don\u2019t turn anything on or attempt to operate any power device such as a power window. Doing so will blow the fuse in the memory saver, and you\u2019ll have to start over.\n\nOnce you\u2019re done, your car should run and idle just like it used to \u2014 maybe even better, if your battery was in poor shape.\u00a0\n\nSafety tip: There is no other use for a memory saver\n\nThe memory saver should only be used for saving settings when replacing the battery, and nothing else. Supplying power to your vehicle when it\u2019s otherwise shut off could result in serious damage to the car and potential injury to you, especially if you\u2019re tinkering around at the time. You don\u2019t want your airbags suddenly going off without warning.\u00a0\n\nStephen Fogel\n\nAbout the Author\n\nStephen has been an automotive enthusiast since childhood, owning some of his vehicles for as long as 40 years, and has raced open-wheel formula cars.

My '02 Camry just exhibited the exact problems described here. I'd just add the following for a *manual transmission* that worked for me: 1) Warm the engine 2) Hold in the clutch and press the gas until the engine goes to about ~3k rpms 3) Keeping the clutch in, take your foot off the gas so that the rpms drop*. 4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the idle is correct again. (Each time you do step 3, the idle will stay higher until it is back to normal.) * The first time I did this, the engine stalled and I restarted it. The second and third times, it almost stalled. I don't know if it helps to add a little gas to keep that from happening, but you can try that if all else fails. Hope that helps someone else running into this problem!\nBy , January 20, 2011\nWorked for me with an 03 Camry with 167,000 miles. Thanks.\nBy , February 10, 2011\nyes cleaning the throttle body did the trick no more stalling . i spraed throttle body\/carb cleaner into it . dont be afraid to use some .than i took a rag and a screw driver to push the rag inti the throttle body to clean out all of the black stuff make sure you look in side to seeif it is all gone .also make sure you clean all around the throttle palte .so far so good 3 days strong . thank you.\nBy , June 10, 2017\nI started to panic wasn't sure what was going on motor broken, timing belt jumped cleaning out intake and letting car idle for a couple minutes worked on my 2006 camry now runs like a champ again thanks for all the recommendations you saved the day\nBy , June 24, 2018\nAnother Camry story..03 Camry. Yesterday, replaced the battery. Having that idling problem\/stalling. Will try what others have done. Thanks.\nBy , December 26, 2018\nI went to Auto Zone in Winston Salem to get a new Battery for my car. I let the car parked on the top of Slope in on the store parking. The technician installed the new battery and left. I start the car immediately but the car didn't start at all. The whole deck was dark and not gear of wheel was working. I stop and start the car again. this time the car stalled again but it rolled backward. Nothing works, Because at the position the car was when the technician installed the battery, the car went backward because of the gravity force. Thank God, an electricity Pole saved my life, otherwise I could have ended on a visit street down the Slope. The people in AutoZone didn't know that they put a new battery in a car that was in an unsafe position.",

These issues could be because you don\u2019t have a US phone number or a US address to store your packages, or because the vendor doesn\u2019t ship internationally. Sometimes the retailers do ship internationally, but their shipping prices for international destinations are high.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone and in this blog we will guide you to avoid these issues by getting free storage in USA. International consumers use this method to hold their packages to wait for the next deal to arrive. After that, they grab those deals and ship both parcels together by using the package consolidation service. Getting packages shipped like this can reduce your shipping costs from 45% to 80% off.\n\nWe have listed several companies in the USA that offer free storage in USA for multiple days, and some even provide it for several months. Also, we discuss their prices for when the package exceeds the time limit for free storage. Ultimately, you can choose your desired free storage companies.\n\nTable Of Content:\u00a0\n\n  1. Stackry\n  2. Planet Express\n  3. MyUS\n  4. Global Shopaholics LLC\n  5. Conclusion\n\n\nStackry offers its customers a free US address and a personalized locker to store their packages. This locker can be used for 45 days for free. After those 45 days, Stackry will contact you to know if they should forward your parcels to your final destinations. If you like to continue to store your packages, Stackry will charge $1 per pound for that storage.\n\nPlanet Express\n\nPlanet Express also offers a tax-free US address to their customers. However, those who want to store their packages in their warehouse need to know that they provide two storage plans. The first is a free mailbox plan that can be used for 10 days, and the second is a Premium Mail Box plan with 45 days of free storage. After that, Planet Express will charge $0.01\/lbs on a package for each day.\u00a0\n\n\nMyUS offers a free US forwarding address to their business and premium members for 30 days, along with free storage. After that, they will charge accordingly. So if you want to store your package, you need to know their prices for storage if your storage limit exceeds 30 days. Their storage plans are as follows:\n\n  \u2022 You don\u2019t need to pay anything if you store your package for 30 days.\u00a0\n  \u2022 If your parcel exceeds 30 days, you have to pay $1 for under oversized packages and $1.50 for large boxes until the 60 days of storage.\n  \u2022 When your package storage exceeds 60 days, you will have to pay $2 for under oversized packages, and for large boxes, you have to pay $3. These conditions only apply when your parcel is stored in under 90 days.\n  \u2022 After 90 days, the storage fee will be $3 for non-oversized packages. For large boxes, your storage fee will be $6.\n\nGlobal Shopaholics LLC\n\nGlobal Shopaholics is one of the best storage companies in the USA that provides free storage for 180 days and a tax-free US shipping address. Their membership is free as well. After exceeding the 180 days of package storage, your packages will be charged $1 for 30 days. After that, your parcel will be destroyed and will not be shipped.\n\n\nFor those who don\u2019t have a US address or a particular address in the USA to store packages, the best option is to get free storage in the USA for several months provided by the package forwarding companies. Then, grab multiple offers from the USA and consolidate your package to ship at the lowest shipping rates.\n\nNews & Updates\n\nPackage Forwarding Latest News\n\n\nDetailed Walk-throughs & Guides\n\n\nSubscribe for Monthly Newsletter!",

Take the passenger headset and remove the earmuff pad from one side of the headset. Place your lav mic head between the foam and the speaker. Tape the lav head to the speaker. Put the padded ring back on to the headset. Press both earmuffs together and wrap gaff tape around the headset to squeeze it together. I never had a problem with this method plus the pilot will be glad when you don\u2019t have to \u201ctamper\u201d with his comm system.\n\nOne comment\n\n  1. Bridgette says:\n\n    I\u2019ve used a similar method to interview pilots in-flight. Everyone in the aircraft (me, pilot and reporter) were wearing headsets so we could communicate during the flight. I stuck the lav in the headset I was wearing and recorded the reporter\/pilot interview that way as they talked to each other over the comm system. The space inside the earmuff was large enough for me to do this comfortably and get pretty decent audio. It still sounded like an airplane comm system but it definitely made the interview much more interesting than interviewing the pilot on the runway.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

In early April they ran their second hands on seminar where 140 sailors took the help during crew overboard exercises with a real person in the water, shot off flares and fire extinguishers, inflated life rafts and climbed in from the water in full foul weather gear with life jackets on and more. UK Sailmakers was proud to be on of the sponsors who helped make this event happen.\n\nTo help educate sailors who did not make it to the seminar, UK Sailmakers Sailmakers video taped some of the session and we will continue to post new clips in our Safety at Sea online library. The latest video covers fighting shipboard fires. Brook West, a life long sailor, volunteer fire fighter and staff member of Landfall (formerly Landfall Navigation) is was the main presenter during this session.\n\nBrook\u2019s main advice, stay calm, get your crew on deck ready to abandon ship if the fire gets out of control, keep the fire from getting behind you and always have a way out of the boat. If possible have some help you get combustibles like sails, cushions, and crew gear away from the fire. When you use the fire extinguisher remember PASS: Pull the safety pin, Aim at the base of the flames, Squeeze the trigger handle and Sweep the spray across the base of the flame.

        "text":"Leasing a Bike vs Taking a Loan to Buy a Bike\n\nCovid-19 has put brakes on ambitions of car-sharing (Ola, Uber) and bike-sharing apps (Bounce). With the need for social distancing, the prospects of these companies remain circumspect even after the lockdown is lifted. The businesses must quickly figure out alternative revenue streams. And some of these companies already are.\n\nBounce (Bike-sharing app) has launched lease rental plans, where you can lease the bike for up to two years and eventually own the bike by making additional payment at the end of the lease term. Here are the various leasing options from Bounce website:\n\n\nBy the way, instead of going for this lease-rental plan, you could have simply taken an two-wheeler loan to own the bike. Which is better?\n\nHow Does the Lease Rental Plan Work?\n\nTo get the Honda Activa scooter on lease, you must first make a refundable security deposit of Rs 12,000 for a new scooter. In addition, you must pay a processing fee of Rs 1,500. GST will apply on this fee. Rent for the first month is collected in advance. Thereafter, you must pay Rs 3,250 each month for the next 24 months (for 24-month lease). After 24 months, you can simply return the scooter to Bounce (the leasing company). Alternatively, if you want to buy the scooter and retain it, you must pay them Rs 19,872. Your security deposit will be adjusted against the amount.\n\nHow much do you pay in total? You pay the refundable deposit of Rs 12,000. You pay a processing fee of Rs 1,500 (plus GST).\u00a0 In the two years when you have leased the scooter, you pay 24 X 3,250 = 78,000.\u00a0If you want to own the same bike you pay another Rs 19,872 (your security deposit will be adjusted against this).\n\nTo own the scooter after leasing for 2 years, you need to pay Rs 1,770 + 78,000 + 19,872 = Rs 99,642.\n\nBy the way, to own the scooter after leasing for 1 year, you need to pay Rs 1,770 + 12*4249+ 38,006= Rs 90,824\n\nNote: I am not sure if the lease rental will attract GST or if the prices mentioned are inclusive of the GST. This can change the equation completely. Before you sign up for this deal, you must figure this out.\n\nWhat If I Go for a Regular Two-Wheeler Loan?\n\nThe on-road price (including registration, road tax and insurance) for Honda Activa in Bangalore will range from Rs 82,000 to Rs 84,000, depending on the model. Let us work with Rs 82,000.\n\nFor a proper comparison, let us assume you make a down-payment for the amount you would have paid upfront for the bike rental. Rs 12,000 + 1500 +18% GST + 3,250 (First month rent) =Rs 17,020\n\nIf you make a down-payment of Rs 17,020, you will have to take loan of Rs 64,980. I assume you do not have to pay any processing or ancillary charges. An two-wheeler loan for this amount for 2 years (in line with lease rent period) at 10% p.a. will have an EMI of Rs 2,999.\n\nTotal amount paid to own the scooter = Rs 17,020 + 24 X 2999 = 88,983\n\nIf you add everything up, you will have to shell out Rs 88,983 over the 2 years to own the scooter.\n\nClearly, the amount paid will be higher if you take out a loan for 3 years.\n\nWhich Is Better?\n\nTo own the scooter after two years, Rs 99,642 for the lease rental or Rs 88,983 under a regular two-wheeler loan?\n\nThis is not complete.\n\nRs 99,642 (lease rental) includes insurance for both first and second years.\n\nRs 88,983 (regular loan) includes insurance only for the first year. Add some cost (Rs 3,000-5,000) for the insurance.\n\nUnder the lease rental plan, when you decide to buy the plan outright, there might be additional costs. There is not much difference. If I had to pick one, I would pick a regular two-wheeler loan.\n\nLeasing a Bike Offers Flexibility and Convenience\n\nYes, and that might be important.\u00a0You might be in the city for only a year or a couple of years. You do not want the trouble of selling your bike or transporting it to another city. Leasing is comfortable that way. I have only considered a new bike. You could have gone for an old bike where the cost is much lower. This facility allows you to test a bike before owning it.\n\nThe Usual Caveats\n\nUnder the lease, you can ride for only 1,500 kms per month. Anything beyond 1,500 kms shall be charged at Rs 0.5 per km.\n\nWhat if you take a 1-year and then want to shift to 2-year lease?\n\nHere is what the FAQs mention:\n\nYou may choose from our 12 months or 24 months plan. The monthly subscription fees will vary based on the chosen plan. And if you wish to move from one plan to another during the term of your subscription, we\u2019ll adjust your monthly fee according to your new plan and you can start paying the new amount every month.\n\nAfter 6 months, you want to shift to a 2-year lease. Simple. You must pay rent for 2-year lease from next month. However, it is a bad deal since you have a high rent for the first 6 months. If you had started with a 2-year lease, you would have saved some money, but you do not always know upfront.\n\nWhat if you take a 2-year and then want to shift to 1-year lease?\n\nNow, this is a bit confusing. Copying text from FAQs:\n\nPlease note: If you switch from a longer subscription plan to a shorter one, a processing fee of 2% of the original annualized monthly subscription fees shall be charged and the monthly rental will be charged as per the new plan.\n\nI am not sure if I am reading this right. Let us consider an example.\n\nI want to rent a bike for 1 year. I will opt for a 2-year lease, where I pay Rs 1,000 less every month. In the 11th month, I convert to 1-year lease by paying only Rs 1019 (Rs 4249X 12*2%). This will save me a lot of money (10X 1,000 \u2013 1019). I doubt Bounce will be comfortable with this.\n\nI think what they mean is that, if you shift from the longer subscription to the shorter subscription, you will have to pay the monthly difference for the current subscription, in addition to the processing fee.\n\nWhat if you take a 1-year lease (or 2-year lease) and want to cancel in between?\n\nFAQs are silent on this. Will there be a penalty? Will the security deposit be forfeited? You must find out before signing up.\n\n\u00a0Additional Reading\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"How-to Guides\n\nHow to Transfer a Number Plate from a Car to a Retention Certificate\n\nIf you have a personalised registration number on your car and you are in the process of changing that car then you may need to know how to transfer a number plate from a car to retention. This is always the best option to take if you have a new car on order as it makes the transfer of the registration number so much easier and smoother for both you and the car dealer. The last thing you want is to find that your new car is ready at the dealership, yet your valuable private number plate is still attached to your old car and is going to take 3 weeks or more to remove!\n\nThe form that you need to complete in order to transfer a number plate from a car to retention is called a V317. Just as if you were going to transfer to another car, you will need to complete the V317 transfer form on the left hand side on the front section as the current registered keeper and sign it at the bottom. Then, just turn it over and complete section 4 where it asks if you wish to be the named Grantee (Owner) of the registration number. If not, then there is a section to add the name of the person you wish to have appointed as the grantee.\n\nThere is also an area to add a nominee name. This is a handy option if you are selling the registration number to someone else. By adding a nominee, you can keep control of the certificate for the registration until you are paid. It then just needs to be signed by the Grantee (current owner) and posted to the new owner so that they can apply to have it transferred by DVLA.\n\nThis is what you need to include in your application to DVLA.\n\n  1. A completed V317 retention form.\n  2. The V5 registration document for the vehicle.\n  3. The MoT Certificate if the vehicle is over 3years old.\n  4. A cheque for \u00a380.00 payable to DVLA.\n\nYou should wait approximately 3 weeks for the application to transfer a number plate from a vehicle to a retention to be completed by DVLA.\n\nTransfer a Number Plate from a Car to Retention helpline.\n\nThe DVLA quote the retention time as 4-6 weeks although in our experience it generally takes about 3 weeks to receive the new documents. If you are still confused, we offer a check and send service for just \u00a325.00 plus VAT whereby we can arrange the application over the phone in most cases. Call us on 01639 888833 for details.",
