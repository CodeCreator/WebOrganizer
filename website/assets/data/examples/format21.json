        "text":"Great Canadian Aboriginal Stone Age Tools - 14, BC - 1600\n\nAxe grinding stone British Columbia\n\nAxes \/ May 15, 2016\n\nBefore the provincial election, Todd Stone had been only a face inside audience of B.C. Liberals hoping to get chosen despite daunting polls.\n\nHe previously some insider credentials in B.C. politics. He and Premier Christy Clark knew each other as teenagers rattling around in university-level politics. Mr. rock struggled to obtain a long period as an executive associate to Gordon Campbell as he was leader associated with formal opposition.\n\nNevertheless the election vaulted the 40-year-old founder for the tech company iCompass to the big leagues whenever rookie MLA for Kamloops-South Thompson became B.C.\u2019s brand new transportation minister.\n\nMr. Stone will deal with files offering a referendum on TransLink financing choices, working with Lower Mainland calls for such projects as a $2.8-billion Broadway rapid-transit range and different connectors, replacing the Massey Tunnel, and liquefied propane terminals into the Prince Rupert area, plus analysis the Insurance Corporation of B.C.\n\nIn a job interview because of the world and Mail, Mr. rock talks about exactly how he plans to handle all of it.\n\nAre you currently marketed prematurely?\n\nThat\u2019s a question, perhaps, when it comes to Premier. Im honoured she has expected us to assume this part. There\u2019s no concern there are numerous areas of the ministry that are very complex, but every thing I\u2019ve done in my entire life is about using difficulties head-on.\n\nYou think it\u2019s a power or responsibility ahead at Lower Mainland dilemmas from the perspective of a politician from outside of the location?\n\nIt\u2019s an energy. I've no axe to work in Lower Mainland. I'm the Minister of Transportation for several Brit Columbians, and there is a large number of transportation and infrastructure tasks under means or will likely to be on books quickly. I guess if you were someone from Indoor, you could ask issue to somebody through the Lower Mainland: How could you deem yourself to be fit becoming a good transport minister whenever you\u2019re from the Lower Mainland?\n\nExactly what are you planning do to win over people who oppose less Mainland referendum on transit capital?\n\nOur commitment to holding a referendum on transportation investment is ironclad. That said, I have a track record running a business to be good at bringing folks collectively. I will be looking forward to satisfying the mayors\u2019 council among others through the Lower Mainland to hear their concerns, and, moreover, their particular recommended solutions and ideas.\n\nAs some body created, raised and located in landlocked Kamloops, what have you figured out about B.C. Ferries?\n\nI did so inhabit Victoria for almost eight years, so I had been a frequent user associated with the ferry system at that time. Definitely, my goal is to bring the vitality and some ideas I have to the table assure we do everything we can as a government to make sure B.C. Ferries is lasting.\n\nHow will you feel about tolls and paying to utilize roadways?\n\nThere is nothing free within province. The taxpayers understand that. As soon as we view addressing traffic congestion and look at improvements to your highways system, we view all options to fund those improvements.\n\nWhenever ended up being the past time you took an extended trip on the SkyTrain or perhaps the Canada Line?\n\nAs somebody with several conferences in downtown Vancouver, I was on that Canada Line a few times monthly for the better the main last four years. It\u2019s a very good system. SkyTrain? We probably need to return back a few much more years.\n\nVancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson points to obstruction in the 99B coach as reason for a multibillion-dollar Broadway Line. Whenever had been the very last time you rode that bus?\n\nWe haven\u2019t ridden the 99B coach, thus I look forward to doing that soon.\n\nYou may not want to give it a go to see just what he\u2019s dealing with?\n\nHey. It\u2019s all about calling stakeholders. Anyone who understands me from my amount of time in company knows that i shall go beyond the call of task to stay straight down with every stakeholder I possibly can. Day 3 on the job here but many options will afford by themselves inside coming weeks.\n\nYou were a new Liberal at 16. Exactly what draws someone that young into politics and keeps them there?\n\nMaybe a flawed gene. I've been passionate about public-service and I can\u2019t help myself. From the age 16 on, i have already been on all sorts of different boards and neighborhood organizations through the United method to Friends for the Kamloops Airport to Thompson streams University.\n\nThis meeting was modified and condensed.\n\nReport Typo\/Error",

        "text":"We Asked Survivor Contestant Ziggy, Everything You\u2019ve Ever Wanted To Know About The Show\u2026 And Boy Did She\u00a0Deliver!\u200b\n\nI am a huge fan of Australian Survivor! I love it, but I also have a lot of questions about it. At least five times an episode I turn to my husband with a question that he, of course, does not have the answer too. Determined to have these questions answered I reached out to my favourite past contestant,\u00a0Nicola \u2018Ziggy\u2019 Zagame.\n\nZiggy winning immunity on Australian Survivor\nNicola \u2018Ziggy\u2019 Zagame and Australian Survivor host Jonathan LaPaglia.\n\nZiggy entered Australian Survivor Season 2 in 2017 and was a contender right from the get-go. Being a former Olympian meant that she possessed the physical and mental ability to go all the way to the end. Her gameplay was strong, winning individual immunity twice and spending a gruelling two hours searching through mangroves in the dark to find a super idol. All of these epic wins proved that Ziggy was a huge threat so as the game goes, she was voted out, coming in at 6th place, and earning a coveted spot on the Jury.\n\nTWN: You and Henry were my favourite contestants last year. I thought for sure you were going to win, especially when you got your hands on that super idol. Were you scared while you were in the mangroves looking for it?\u00a0\n\nZiggy:\u00a0I wasn\u2019t really scared in the sense of the water etc., I was scared that I wasn\u2019t going to find anything and that I\u2019d\u00a0have to go back to camp with nothing, and that would not be believable at all!\n\nTWN: What happens when contestants get their period on the show?\u00a0\n\nZiggy: Tampons are allowed, but these are kept at camp and are just as exposed as anything else on the island. Let\u2019s just say that that time of the month wasn\u2019t great.\n\nTWN: Why do the female contestants seem to have no body hair this far into the show?\n\nZiggy: I had laser hair removal about 7 years ago now, so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t have hair myself and I know a few of the girls in my season had it too. I think maybe the girls with hair just hide it quite well and it isn\u2019t shown as much on TV as viewers would think. There were certainly some hairy pits out there but I\u00a0never noticed it watching the episodes myself.\n\nZiggy and Luke celebrating on Australian Survivor\nZiggy and fellow contestant Luke Toki.\n\nTWN:\u00a0What was the hardest thing to go without?\u00a0\n\nZiggy: The hardest thing I thought was going without a roof. Honestly, it rained a lot and the simple comfort of having somewhere which was guaranteed\u00a0to stay dry was something I missed. Our clothes, shoes, bags etc., were constantly wet and it was really hard just having no escape from the weather.\n\nTWN:\u00a0How many outfits are you allowed to take in?\n\nZiggy: You are allowed to take the clothes you are wearing, plus 5 extra items. So that in total accounts for about 11 items of clothing.\n\nTWN:\u00a0Are there toilets for the contestants?\n\nZiggy:\u00a0There is no \u2018toilet\u2019 but there is an area that you go to, to do your business, more like a hole in the ground I would say. But in the middle of the night, it is sooooo dark out there that you\u2019d never find this location so anywhere has to do haha.\n\nTWN:\u00a0Do you get inductions before challenges so that you don\u2019t hurt yourselves?\u00a0And was injuring yourself something that you were concerned about, considering that you are an Olympian?\u00a0\n\nZiggy:\u00a0You get the challenge rules explained to you in a bit more depth and some of those rules were set for safety reasons.\u00a0I was not concerned about being injured at all, I love the rough and tough of challenges and putting your body on the line!\n\n\u201cI love the rough and tough of challenges and putting your body on the line!\u201d\n\nTWN:\u00a0How long does it take to film Tribal Council?\u00a0\n\nZiggy:\u00a0Soooo long\u2026 we have no concept of time as we never see any watches or clocks. It\u2019s especially long if there\u2019s a re-vote or something, then tribal can certainly take over an hour or two, and the rocks we sit on are soooo uncomfortable!\n\nTWN:\u00a0When you got to the Jury Villa did you get to contact your family and did you get your phone back?\n\nZiggy:\u00a0No we didn\u2019t get to contact our family until after the final tribal council and we were only allowed\u00a0a 3-minute phone call to one person, so I chose my now husband but the call was so quick.\u00a0We didn\u2019t have our phones, internet, TV, radio or anything which connected us to real life in the Jury Villa at all, as we were still in the game and no outside influences\u00a0were allowed. We got our phones when we were on the plane flying home!\n\nTWN:\u00a0How long is it between filming ends on the island and the actual Winner Reveal?\n\nZiggy:\u00a0There was about 3.5 months in between\u2026 a very long time for the final two to have to wait.\n\nTWN:\u00a0What was the first meal you had when you got home?\u00a0\n\nZiggy:\u00a0When I landed my boyfriend had a fresh\u00a0cheeseymite scroll for me which was incredible, and I landed in the morning so then met my parents out for brunch at my favourite cafe\u2026 der\u2026 haha typical me, I had a coffee, smashed avo, halloumi and bacon.\u00a0[If you follow Ziggy on Instagram you will know that she is a BIG fan of Brunch]\n\nLife after Australian Survivor\nZiggy enjoying a post Survivor brunch with fellow contestant Michelle.\n\nTWN:\u00a0Does everyone get really sick after food rewards?\n\nZiggy:\u00a0Yes.\n\nTWN:\u00a0Did you ever feel anxious around the time of eliminations? Did you take things to heart or were you just in the mindset of, \u201cit\u2019s just a game?\u201d\n\nZiggy: The game really plays with your head as you are living in that world and can\u2019t escape it. I would get nervous but really excited before tribal council. It was a weird limbo\/surreal\u00a0kind of feeling. I never took anything to heart as we certainly celebrated good gameplay and blindsides, but I was definitely in it to win it,\u00a0so I was nervous going into tribal as I didn\u2019t want to be blindsided.\n\nTWN:\u00a0Aside from missing the outside world, what was the hardest thing about being on the show?\u00a0\n\nZiggy:\u00a0I think the physical discomfort was the hardest part. Infected mosquito bites, being cold,\u00a0wet and hungry constantly was tough\n\nTWN:\u00a0I saw that there were quite a few contestants at your wedding earlier in the year. Are the friendships the most important thing that you took away from the experience?\n\nZiggy: Yes definitely! The bonds you form with other contestants are quite special as we have an experience in common that no one else will truly\u00a0understand. I have made some great lifelong friends, and even those who I may not stay in heaps of contact with I know we will have that bond for life. I also just have great memories from the time on the island\u2026 waking up on a beautiful beach as the sun is rising and living off the land was so so incredible. The stars at night time were amazing too. So many awesome memories!\n\nPeter, Jarrad, Henry dancing with Ziggy at her wedding after Australian Survivor\nPeter, Jarrad and Henry dancing with Ziggy at her wedding.\nFellow contestants Lachlan, Mark, Michelle, Samantha and Henry join Ziggy at Coogee Beach after Australian Survivor\nFellow contestants Lachlan, Mark, Michelle, Samantha and Henry join Ziggy at Coogee Beach.\n\nTWN: Who would you like to see win this year?\u00a0\n\nZiggy:\u00a0I would like to see Sharn win this year. She has nearly been eliminated so many times but her communication skills and acting non-threatening is impressive.\n\nTWN:\u00a0Finally, what have you been doing since the show ended? Have you gone back to fulltime training or has the show taken you down a new path?\u00a0\n\nZiggy:\u00a0I actually retired from\u00a0competitive\u00a0water polo after the Rio Olympics in 2016 so when\u00a0I applied for Survivor I was no longer playing in the National Team. I haven\u2019t\u00a0really changed my life at all after Survivor. I love my life, so my intention to go on the show wasn\u2019t\u00a0for fame or to open up doors for anything in particular. I have gone back to work and am doing normal everyday stuff again\u00a0and love it!

        "text":"Skip to main content\njump to navigation\nThe Official Site of Minor League Baseball\nBelow is an advertisement.\nQ&A With Top Marlins Prospect Andrew Heaney\nHeaney Finished 2013 in Jacksonville\n02\/03\/2014 4:25 PM ET\nFormer Sun Andrew Heaney is listed as the top left-handed pitching prospect in baseball according to entering the 2014 season.\nFormer Sun Andrew Heaney is listed as the top left-handed pitching prospect in baseball according to entering the 2014 season.\u00a0(AP)\n\nJACKSONVILLE - Left-handed pitcher Andrew Heaney enters the 2014 season as the Miami Marlins No. 1 prospect according to Baseball America, as well as the top left-handed pitching prospect in baseball according to\n\nHeaney began 2013 in High-A Jupiter where he went 5-2 with a 0.88 ERA in 12 starts before finishing the season in Jacksonville, going 4-1 with a 2.94 ERA in six starts for the Suns. The southpaw also shined in the Arizona Fall League, with a 2-1 record and a 1.95 ERA in seven starts and 27 and two-thirds innings pitched.\n\nDespite the lofty expectations going into his third year in the Marlins organization, the 2012 first round selection out of Oklahoma State is focused on improving in 2014, regardless where he begins the year.\n\nAs he prepares for spring training, Heaney spoke with Suns broadcaster Roger Hoover to review his 2013 campaign, his busy offseason, and his expectations for the year ahead.\n\nHoover: First of all how has the offseason gone for you and what have you been working on?\n\nHeaney: Well I got home in the middle of November, took about three days off. Then I worked out, started doing baseball stuff again. Then I had Thanksgiving with the family and then really got going after that. I'm working on being in better cardio shape, really working on flexibility and trying to really stay healthy. Being healthy is a key for me this year, I was pretty disappointed that I started the season off hurt last year. So now I'm throwing bullpens and just getting ready to go.\n\nHoover: You got drafted in June 2012, then finished the season seeing some time with the GCL Marlins and Greensboro, was there an adjustment in 2013 going through a full season as a professional pitcher?\n\nHeaney: I felt more comfortable. I knew faces in the organization, knew how things worked, just some of the do's and don'ts of Minor League Baseball. I think I did a good job of not screwing up too much in my first year, but it was nice to have some guys that I knew, some friendly faces. Playing-wise, I got a good introduction when I went to Greensboro my first year. I feel like from then on out I've had a good grasp on how to approach the game.\n\nHoover: You suffered a strain lat muscle during last year's spring training, how frustrating was it for you to start the regular season on the disabled list and then how did you get things going when you made it to the Hammerheads in May?\n\nHeaney: It was really frustrating because I've never been hurt before. I've never had a pulled hamstring, sore bicep, I've never had to miss a game before. So it's a different deal to figure out how to deal with that and how to approach rehab with the same intensity that you approach pitching in a game. So that was frustrating to really want to have a good first season and set the bar for myself and then to get out of the gates and get hurt, it was like I'm already behind the 8-ball. I'm glad though with Gene Basham and all the guys in the rehab, they did a really good job of making sure I pace myself. Every day I was like 'hey I want to throw this far, I want to do this and this,' and they did a good job of telling me no. They told me I wasn't in a race with anybody. I think that really showed when I got back to Jupiter, I felt like it took me 2-3 weeks to really get adjusted to the game and pitching again. I really think that's a lot of credit to them and making sure I was 100 percent healthy and not running me out there too quick.\n\nHoover: What was the transition like going from the Hammerheads to the Suns and getting your first taste of Double-A baseball at the end of the season?\n\nHeaney: It was awesome. Anthony DeSclafani had been moved up, and so had Justin Nicolino before me, so it was nice to get there and the first day I was there they helped me figure out where to go for things and they made it so much easier. I'm kind of a self-conscious guy so in transitions I don't want to be that guy that does something stupid or steps on toes or anything like that. So it was nice to have those guys to hang out with, bounce some ideas off of and stuff. And then with Andy Barkett and all the rest of the staff, I mean they're just cool as hell. They just accept you for who you are and they let you go play and they love you for it. I really enjoyed playing for them too.\n\nHoover: What did you like about your pitching coach John Duffy and what do you feel like he helped you with at the end of the year?\n\nHeaney: I think with Duff, you can tell that guy wants to compete more than anything. If you want to do towel drills for two hours, he'll stand there and talk with you about doing a towel drill for two hours. Some guys hate it, some guys love it, but you can't question that the guy wants what's best for you and wants you to succeed. For me we worked on a lot of going out of the stretch, being a little quicker to the plate, working on my move to first. I still have a ways to go, I've been working on it this year but I really think we figured out how to do it. That's instead of a lot of coaches telling you to do it this way, and if that didn't work for me he really sat down and worked with me on figuring out what's the best way to do it that's comfortable for me that didn't affect how I pitch. I really appreciated that.\n\nHoover: Then once the Suns season was over, you got to go to Arizona to pitch in the Arizona Fall League. How do you feel you performed there, especially getting to go against some of the top hitting prospects in baseball?\n\nHeaney: I felt really good. I wasn't nervous but I was anxious to get out there and see what the competition was like and see how it stacked up to some of the Double-A competition I've faced. There were some really good players out there, we had good players on our team. So it was really fun to go out there and really test yourself against the best in the minor leagues. I felt like I did well, I was really happy, I walked away with no regrets.\n\nHoover: Where there any other AFL prospects that stood out or guys that proved to be a tough out for you?\n\nHeaney: There were a lot of good guys there. A guy on our team named Alex Meyer, pitcher for the Twins organization, I charted him pretty much every time he threw. And he was just unbelievable. He's out there throwing 97-100 miles per hour every single time with his fastball. A nasty curveball, he's a 6-8 righty, you can't ask for anything more out of a pitcher. So he was unbelievable. The other thing that struck me that I thought was pretty crazy was the amount of hitters in the Chicago Cubs organization. They had Kris Bryant who they just drafted, Jorge Soler, Albert Almora, they had all of these guys on their team in Mesa. So every time we faced them I was just like, 'man this Cubs organization just runs out position players that are just really good hitters.'\n\nHoover: Also talking about your offseason we understand that you got married in January and had a lot of Suns and Marlins organization teammates there to celebrate the big day with you.\n\nHeaney: It was awesome to have a lot of guys from the Suns come out. We had a great time and it really showed me how good of friends we were that those guys would be willing to come from Florida, New Jersey, Indiana or Texas, they just came from everywhere in the middle of winter to Oklahoma. The fact that they would come out and support myself and my wife like that it just made me really happy. So that was really awesome to have the feeling being so loved by those guys, it was great.\n\nHoover: How would you describe your pitching repertoire and what you're trying to do with each pitch?\n\nHeaney: I throw a four-seam fastball, I get some good run and a little bit of sink on it. I throw pretty much four-seamers every time, never really throw two-seam fastballs. My second pitch I usually go to would be slider. I started throwing that in the summer between my sophomore and junior year at the Cape Cod League. And my junior year at Oklahoma State I really finally got a real good feel for it. So I'm confident getting that as a putout pitch. And then mixing in changeups when I'm behind in the count or in a hitters count I can be confident throwing that for strikes, getting some off-balance swings or ground balls early in the count. So I'm just really working on being able to throw everything for a strike and keeping sliders away from bats when I really need a strikeout or swing-and-a-miss.\n\nHoover: You're heading down to Jupiter soon to get going with Spring Training. What's your mindset going into spring and where do you hope to start the season?\n\nHeaney: I'm going in there hoping that I can stand out and I can go out there and pitch well and make them consider putting me on the roster to start the season. Whether that happens or not, it's in my control in terms of how I play but that's not my decision to make. My goal is to just go out there and pitch as well as I can, obviously stay healthy and not be hurt. That's a minor goal for me. And then to be able to pitch in a big league spring training game would be really great. So I have some minor goals and some major goals but I just want to go out there and play the best I can.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor the latest Suns news this offseason, fans are encouraged to visit and can keep up with the Jacksonville Suns on the club's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram social media platforms, as well as the \"Tales from Bragan Field\" blog:\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues or its clubs.

There are so many exciting developments in organics and natural skin care that are exceeding the capabilities of petrochemical based products.\n\nIs there a team behind the process and what do you do?\n\nOur product development team includes a Chemist, Biochemist, Laboratory Technicians, Marketing Specialists plus a Graphic and Product Designer. My role within the team is to coordinate and manage each aspect of the product development from visualisation to implementation.\n\nIs it difficult to develop a new product?\n\nIt was a massive challenge for our team to create a natural and certified organic skin care range that was more effective than the mainstream chemical-based products. It was made possible by extensive research, applying the latest science, rigorous testing and feedback.\n\nOur new Vita-Bright\u2122 Radiance Serum has been my favourite project to date. I can say with confidence that we have developed the highest quality serum using the latest technological advancements; it\u2019s scientifically designed to improve the appearance of skin. Our product development processes ensures that we deliver the most effective and superior products to our consumers every time.\n\nPlease explain the process you undertake to ensure that you develop products that customers need?\n\nKey to our success is to understand the customers\u2019 specific skin concerns and developing a product that will deliver the required results. Serums are concentrated formulations that deliver actives deep into the skin, it was very important that we focused on what skin concerns we should address. The primary feedback from our customers was they required an anti-ageing serum that would also maintain a youthful glowing complexion.\n\nWhat specifically were their key concerns?\n\nWell, in the harsh Australian climate, sun exposure and melanin synthesis is responsible for premature ageing of the skin and general poor skin health, including winkles, fine lines, pigmentation, dark spots and uneven skin tone. Protection and repair functioning are therefore critical to ensuring healthy skin.\n\nIn addition, the busy modern lifestyle and diet are deficient in essential vitamins and minerals required for excellent skin condition. Key to a youthful appearance is firm; glowing and radiant skin. To achieve this requires nutrients that support healthy skin functioning and cellular repair.\n\nHow do you formulate a product that addresses these skin concerns?\n\nExtensive research is critical. It is important to understand the key skin deficiencies that contribute to skin ageing and develop a formulation that will supplement and support skin health based on the key considerations.\n\nOur team established that a concentrated serum packed full of superior active ingredients Vitamin A, C, E and antioxidants will improve the health of skin for the appearance of glowing, radiant and a more youthful complexion.\n\nWe continually are searching for the latest technologies and ingredients that will improve the efficacy of our products. It\u2019s everything from my subscription to leading chemistry publications to regularly attending leading global raw material conferences. When selecting ingredients and formulating our Vita-Bright\u2122 Radiance Serum it was imperative that it was potent and proven to perform. Each ingredient is extensively researched and the clinical data analysed to ensure that consumers will see and feel results immediately.\n\nCan you tell us about the ingredients contained in Organic Islands Vita-Bright\u2122 Radiance Serum and why they are so beneficial to the skin?\n\nWe wanted to include vitamin A or Retinol; it\u2019s used to treat photo damaged skin from UV exposure, including typical symptoms of fine and course wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, dark spots and uneven skin tone. Vitamin A is a benchmark for anti-ageing treatments and is proven to increase cellular renewal, is vital to the regulation of keratinisation, stimulates DNA synthesis and improves collagen synthesis.The primary concern was that Vitamin A can increase sensitivity to the sun and irritate sensitive skin.\n\nThrough extensive research we were able to source a safe alternative to retinol, Clinically proven Vit-A-Like\u2122 is a natural alternative to retinol that does not increase skin sensitivity and outperforms other ingredients on the market.\n\nAnother hero ingredient is Maritech\u00ae Bright; it\u2019s derived from seaweed and is a highly effective natural brightening active, enhancing radiance, visibly reducing age spots and pigmentation. A superior antioxidant, it\u2019s clinically proven to inhibit enzymes known to accelerate the visible signs of ageing. It\u2019s a really powerful ingredient that protects skin against external stresses, including UV damage and the effects of free radicals.\n\nAustralia due to its harsh climate has a number of resilient native actives that in recent studies have excelled in their suitability for cosmetic application. Kakadu Plum is the highest natural concentration of vitamin C. A powerful anti-ageing antioxidant, Kakadu Plum stimulates the growth of collagen to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Significantly improves skin hydration, decreases pigmentation and inflammation for a smoother and brighter skin complexion.\n\nWhat happens after the research stage is completed?\n\nPrior to launching a product our team spends an extensive period of formulation and rigorous testing until we produce a product that we are completely satisfied with. The samples that make it to our blind testing have been reformulated hundreds of times and scientifically tested for safety and efficacy. We then undertake several rounds of testing using a controlled group to ensure that the outcome of the testing is accurate. This focus group will be the decider of the final formulation, the scent, the texture and absorption. Each sample is analysed and perfected based on the focus groups direction and feedback.\n\nHow do you decide on the packaging design?\n\nThe packaging design is really important. Our focus is on packaging that is ethical and environmentally friendly. The product packaging is also about functionality and intelligent design; it must protect the integrity of our formulations and maintain shelf life. We need to ensure that when our customer purchases their Organic Island product that they are getting a 100% quality product guaranteed every time. It needs to be as fresh as the day that it was bottled.\n\nIn terms of the design, it\u2019s all about creating a unique looking product that reflects Organic Islands brand message and our attention to detail. We have just revamped our range, to bring it in line with our brands journey. It is actually one of the most difficult parts of the process for our design team to communicate all the hard work and research that went into the product in such a small space.\n\nOrganic Islands Vita-Bright\u2122 Radiance Serum launches next January 2018.",

        "text":"Share On Facebook\nShare On Twitter\nShare On Google Plus\nShare On Pinterest\nShare On Youtube\nAyatollah Khamenei, in an unprecedented direct outreach to the Western citizens, penned a letter addressed to the youths in Europe and North America, and asked them not to believe the stereotypical, dogmatic portrayal of Islam by the corporate media and instead try to gain a firsthand, original knowledge of this divine religion through such sources as the Holy Quran and the life of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). He also urged the youths in the West not to consider the terrorists recruited by militant organizations in the Middle East with the backing of global powers as Muslims, because the teachings of Islam condemn violence and never allow the Muslims to kill the innocent people.\n\n\nTiziana Ciavardini is a cultural anthropologist and journalist. She was a researcher at the Department of Anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She spent more than 23 years travelling, living for many years in Middle East, Asia and Southeast Asia. She is a President of Ancis Anthropology Forum, a cultural association for the dialogue of religions and culture. Ciavardini has lived in Iran for more than 10 years and has published several articles, essays and books.\n\n\nHere is an interview\u00a0to Dr. Tiziana Ciavardini about the growth of Islamophobia in the West and the global impacts of the Supreme Leader\u2019s open letter on the public opinion.\n\n\nQ: You are an anthropologist and have studied different cultures and religions. Why do you think there are a number of public figures, politicians and media organizations in the West who cheer on fomenting anti-Islamic sentiments and fanning the flames of discord between the Muslims and the Western public? Is it that they benefit from the continued hostility and antagonism between the Muslims and the people in the West?\n\n\nA: Most of the people you are talking about are politician who are trying their best to make Western people have a bad opinion about Islam. They want an \u2018enemy\u2019to justify their bad actions. In the past, enemy was a man with a name and a surname and they recognized that removing just a man was not enough, so they created another enemy. \u2018Enemy\u2019 is too difficult to eliminate: now the enemy is called Islam. For several decades, anything [negative] that has happened is Islam\u2019s fault. Not enough, now that they realize that Islam is spreading fast in the West, they have created Islamophobia.\n\n\nMy anthropological studies have given me the opportunity to search deeply the situation and I will not give up until I understand the truth. We, as people, should investigate what benefits they take from this situation, and recognize who is really behind all of this, and is interested to convince us to avoid Islam.\n\n\nIn my opinion, lack of responsibility, some kind of modern nihilism and mental anarchism, lack of knowledge about history, especially the history of crusade wars, recurrence to the past, adventurism, and making false tumult to receive popularity, and increasing the circulation of newspapers and magazines may be the reasons. For example some nearly-broken weekly French magazines as Charlie Hebdo with a low circulation \u2013 between 14,000 to 30,000 copies \u2013 after the incident, achieved a million copies circulation and everybody was curious to see what was published in this magazine.\n\n\nAs the period of tabloids such as \u201cNews of the Day\u201d idiomatically published to entertain waiters and waitresses comes to an end, now the media is using some other methods to receive popularity and false high circulation.\n\n\nBy creating a fear of Islam and introducing it as an enemy, some will benefit to organize more conflicts and strategic ways to fight against a religion that has many supporters in many countries.\nFortunately, many intellectuals and Islam experts are now trying to explain the real pacific nature of Islam to the people through their books, conferences and articles, but there is still a deliberately big propaganda against it.\n\n\nQ: The recent terrorist attack on the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine was immediately attributed to what the West calls \u201cMuslim terrorists\u201d and the social networking media, only a few minutes following the shooting spree, began featuring headlines claiming that Muslims had raided the office of the French satirical magazine in Paris and killed 12 people. It seems that there\u2019s a spontaneous inclination in the West to associate every act of terrorism on the European or North American soil to the Muslims, even when there\u2019s no sufficient information available about the incident. What\u2019s your take on that?\n\n\nA: Police and Interpol investigations will continue, but such barbaric actions may be attributed to ISIS because it was said that a caricature of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was to be published on this magazine. ISIS is a dangerous terrorist group that attributes itself to Islam while it dishonours Muslim men and women and children, sells them in the market as slaves, and executes them in masses.\n\n\nIn respect of the human lives lost in Charlie Hebdo, I don\u2019t like to pursue the theory of a plot, but it seems very strange to me that some people were ready to capture the attack on their mobiles and from a well-placed videographer. Just from the video published in all media and televisions, it was clear that the masked gunmen were consequently identified by French authorities as Cherif Kouachi, Said Kouachi, and Hamid Mourad, and they say in the video that the attack was a revenge against those who had \u201cinsulted\u201d Prophet Muhammad. But the media seems to have forgotten the victims and are more interested to create more confusion between Islam and terrorism. As I have already mentioned, the so-called \u2018Islamic State\u2019 is spreading terror and fear all over the world and even among Muslims, too. My point since the first appearance of this group is to discover who is really behind it. It is impossible that in the name of a religion they commit such terrifying crimes.\n\n\nQ: What do you think the letter issued by Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei to the young Westerners entails for the global public following the Paris attacks? Why has he decided to address the young European and North American citizens directly and challenge them to study the original and genuine sources of Islam instead of relying upon the mass media for getting a clear understanding of the Islamic lifestyle and philosophy?\n\n\nA: The letter was a great initiative. Ayatollah Khamenei drew aside the curtains of ambiguity that some international media use to cover the real entity of Islam. These media who are mostly fed by anti-Islamic sources want to introduce the people of one of the most ancient regions in the world as chaotic and aggressive.\n\n\nWe don\u2019t need to be Muslim to understand the sincere words of Ayatollah Khamenei which bear profound significance. I define this letter as \u2018historical\u2019 since the message will remain in the history forever. I wish many people will read the letter since it is an example of humanity.\n\n\nI really believe that the people who do not understand the power and the meaning of Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s words will find it out in near future. First of all, I am honored to comment about the words of such an important person not only for the international Muslim community but also for many people around the world who recognize the power and the holiness of the Supreme Leader. The fact that he chose the letter instead of using other means to communicate with the people was because the letter is more personal than a newspaper, I guess. I myself am a journalist, but my opinion about newspapers is not always very good, since sometimes they report what they don\u2019t want the real truth and make people confused instead of giving them the facts so they can make their own opinions.\n\n\nQ: How do you see the global reactions to the Supreme Leader\u2019s letter to the Western youths? I think it has prompted a debate in the intellectual circles regarding the roots of anti-Islamic sentiments and the unprecedented rise of Islamophobic attacks against the Muslims, their community centers and mosques in the West. Do you think this debate will lead to the emergence of a clearer, more lucid and realistic understanding of Islam?\n\n\nA: Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader talked to the Western youth directly through internet and informed not only the youth but all internet users of an innocent message sent from the Islamic Republic of Iran. His message was honest and pleasant and very effective on the mentality of not only the youth but also the people of the world.\n\n\nI think the global reaction should be evaluated by statistical institutes, but as far as I have witnessed and heard, it has been quite effective and proves that Ayatollah Khamenei is not only the Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic of Iran but also a mentor and kind personality with good intentions about humanity.\n\n\nQ: Iran is a major regional power, with a government established on the basis of theological democracy. So, it\u2019s important that its supreme political and religious authority shows concern for the rise of anti-Islamic prejudice and propaganda. In this light, why are the rest of the Muslim leaders silent and indifferent towards the growth of anti-Islamic bigotry, fuelled by the recent attacks on the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine? Is it that the Muslim leaders are ignoring the cause of Islam and it makes no difference to them when Islam is denigrated and belittled?\n\n\nA: This question was also asked by some media in Italy. Where are the Muslim communities right now? Someone said, maybe they are not showing up since they are also afraid of the Islamic State. This \u2018fear\u2019 is also a witness to what we just said. If the Muslim communities themselves are afraid of Islamic State, it means that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam. We need to go further and get over the obstacle of ignorance and help the people open their mind to the knowledge. Ignorance always bring... (truncated)",

Interview with Mr. Kenta Watanabe\n\nInterview with Mr. Kenta Watanabe\n\nThe younger generation contributes to the future of space activities\n\nThe Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) was established in 1999 in support of the United Nations Program on Space Applications. It is a global non-governmental, non-profit organization and network that aims to present the views of university students and young space professionals aged 18-35 at the United Nations, space agencies, industry, and academia. SGAC holds Permanent Observer status at the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) and regularly takes part in the annual meetings.\n\nSince 2014, Asia-Pacific Space Generation Workshops (AP-SGW) has been held annually as side events of APRSAF annual meetings. A workshop was held in Nagoya on November 23 and 24, 2019. Following this workshop, a representative from SGAC participated as one of the panelists in the \u201cHOA \u00d7 Young Generation Session\u201d during the APRSAF-26 plenary. The APRSAF secretariat interviewed Mr. Kenta Watanabe, the event manager of AP-SGW this year, and asked him how the younger generation can contribute to space activities in Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nAPRSAF Secretariat\n\nWhy did you decide to work in the space field?\n\nMr. Kenta Watanabe\n\nMy major was material science when I was in university, so my background was not directly related to space industry. However, I had a chance to come into space industry when I was sophomore, so called \u201cSpace Job Hunting\u201d which is a job hunting event for university students to come across the workers in space industry. Ever since then I have been interested in space industry. After that event, a friend of mine in SGAC introduced SGAC to me and invited me to participate in the Space Generation Congress (SGC) which is an annual meeting of SGAC held in Toronto, Canada in 2014. At the SGC, I was really impressed to realize that participants from various backgrounds had deep knowledge and discussed a lot of matters actively about space development, policy, education and so on. This experience inspired me to pursue the space field further.\n\nAfter graduation with master\u2019s degree of engineering, I have joined a private company in Japan which supports the operation of the Japanese experiment module \u201cKibo\u201d on the International Space Station. Since then, I have started working as a flight controller of Kibo.\n\nMy work as a flight controller is totally amazing. I had dreamed about working with astronauts and now my dream came true. Thanks to the experience and network of SGAC, I could cope with international partners without problems. I\u2019m pretty sure that SGAC members from various fields have broadened my horizons.\n\n\nHow was this year\u2019s AP-SGW?\n\nMr. Kenta Watanabe\n\nWe had largest number of the participants ever! We also had extremely excellent lecturers and sponsors. I was in charge of an event manager of the workshop. And as the event manager, I was very pleased and satisfied. The success was also thanks to the organizing team with its diverse staff. We had staff from overseas countries this time, and held discussions with SGAC\u2019s Asia representative. I had exciting days and learned a lot. The preparation was all about solving challenges without exact answers, such as determination of discussion topics, gathering sponsors, management of schedule, arranging visas, promoting applications by the participants, which made me tougher, while my daily work was mainly arranging usual matters.\n\n\nHow active are SGAC members in Asian-Pacific countries?\n\nMr. Kenta Watanabe\n\nThis year, we had 82 participants from Asian-Pacific countries at AP-SGW, including 42 registered attendees. But the participants are only selected members allowed to join AP-SGW and there are over 100 active members in the Asia-Pacific area including National Point of Contact (NPoC), who is a representative of each country, per two people at most in each country.\nCurrently, we have over 15,000 SGAC members in the world from over 150 countries. We have around 100 participants at the annual Space Generation Congress (SGC) which is the largest conference hosted by SGAC as an official side event of International Astronautical Congress (IAC). So the number of AP-SGW this year was quite near that. We\u2019re willing to promote AP-SGW further, by, for example, increasing our scholarship activities to attract more participants.\n\n\nSo this is a great chance for you and SGAC?\n\nMr. Kenta Watanabe\n\nUntil last year, SGAC AP-SGW was an independent \u201cside event\u201d of APRSAF. But surprisingly, we had an opportunity to participate in APRSAF plenary session as one of the panelists thanks to the tremendous cooperation by APRSAF secretariats. This was a valuable opportunity to share SGAC\u2019s input being put together in AP-SGW 2019 with the stakeholders. I would like to brush up and increase the number of these inputs to APRSAF continuously. In addition, as we don\u2019t have so many participants from the Asian-Pacific region in SGAC, we would like to promote the outputs of our activities. It is highly valuable for us to participate in APRSAF, where high-level participants from space agencies and industries are in attendance. We would like to present our activities at the plenary session continuously as a representative of young generation.\n\n\nNews Mails\n\nVisit the archive of APRSAF's previous mail magazine.\n\n\nLatest issue of APRSAF Newsletter\n> No.31 <March 2020>",

In the following excerpt, RVD explains how he feels about his latest run in WWE so far: What\u2019s it like being back in WWE?\n\nRob Van Dam: It\u2019s awesome. I predicted that this return to WWE might be the most impactful part of my entire career. It has a lot to do with timing, and a lot to do with being RVD because I have so many years of experience. But it\u2019s all positive. All the time I\u2019ve spent. There\u2019s no downside. I don\u2019t have that a.g.e. factor that seems to affect a lot of other people. Honestly, my body feels as good as it ever did. Sometimes my back bothers a little bit, but it bothered me even more when I was 23. Sometimes my knee bothers me a little bit. It bothered me even more when I was 30. I feel great. And obviously it shows when I\u2019m in the ring. And the fan response has been off the hook. And, by the way, my position in the company, considering the other wrestlers that are there, versus the wrestlers that were there before, again, works in my favor because all the other guys that were ahead of me that were getting all the attention, all the TV time, well they\u2019ve dropped off, they\u2019re outta the scene; a good time to be the whole damn show.\n\nClick here to read the full interview.\n\nThe JBL & Cole Show\n\nEpisode #38 of The JBL & Cole Show is online at this link.

Aired 6:30-7a ET\n\nAired April 6, 2017 - 06:30 \u00a0 ET\n\n\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: What did you think of that?\n\nMAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I noticed the absence. Mostly just because when there are so many people in the room, you start looking at when the vice president is staffing an interview with the president, you notice who is not there.\n\n[06:30:04] I wouldn't over-read it. Bannon often comes in and out of meetings that he wants to be in or doesn't want to be in. I'm not really sure this is one, candidly, he wanted to be in.\n\nBut, you know, there is no -- it is no secret that he and Gary Cohn are not exactly brothers in arms on issues. Infrastructure is Gary Cohn's.\n\nALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: But the timing of it, you know, we heard yesterday that Steve Bannon, some would say, had sort of a demotion and that hadn't happened yet when you were there or did you talk about this with the president?\n\nHABERMAN: No, it literally happened five minutes after -- broke five minutes after.\n\nCUOMO: You had reported on the speculation about it some weeks ago.\n\nHABERMAN: We had. My colleague Peter Baker and I had an assisting role in this, had reported that there were discussions going on about a revamp and a change to that executive order that had done the shift in terms of -- including restoring the downgraded seats. It was not clear at the time what would happen with Bannon, but that change was actually expected, I think, a week after that initial report. That was four weeks ago.\n\nIt's really worth remembering, the president has been chewing on some form of this, of a change and back to older order on the NSC almost since the moment he signed the initial executive order. That first weekend, there were two. There was that executive order about the NSC, and then there was the one about immigration, and the travel ban, and he was more upset about the blowback over the NSC order than he was about the fall-out from the executive order and immigration, at least initially. CAMEROTA: But, David Gregory, do we think that Steve Bannon has been\n\n\nDAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, appropriately sidelined from the National Security Council. I can tell you from my conversations that H.R. McMaster was very concerned about how there were people excluded, including the DNI, and how Steve Bannon was included in the national security principals meeting.\n\nAgain, you know, this sounds like a lot of process, but this is vitally important in terms of bringing in all the strains of information, for decision-making on national security. There is still concern by McMaster and outside allies of his about the fact that Bannon and Jared Kushner have this innovation group that can bleed into national security and foreign policy, working kind of on a parallel track on nationalist or other national security policies.\n\nSo, I don't think this story is over, but this was certainly a restoration of order. You know, it's a good sign, I think, that the president realized, look, I got to listen to some of these folks I have put in place who want the system to work properly.\n\nCUOMO: David Sanger, final word from what you think we should expect today coming out of China. Do you think it will meet up to the hype and expectation of some type of result?\n\nDAVID SANGER, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES: Well, one quick thing on David's point there. You now have a National Security Council that looks like the institution has traditionally looked like. You got all these people coming in to blow up old institutions or change them, and what you ended up with was something more like Brent Scowcroft's National Security Council. He was the national security advisor, of course, with George H.W. Bush.\n\nOn the Chinese, I think day one is going to be inconclusive. I think you'll see the Chinese come in and offer a lot to the U.S., including probably investments in the U.S., figuring that that's the way to get on President Trump's good side. I'm not sure you're going to see very much result, but it is just a first meeting in a very long relationship.\n\nCAMEROTA: Yes. David Sanger, David Gregory, Maggie Haberman -- thank you for sharing all of the reporting with us this morning.\n\nCUOMO: All right. We've been talking about Syria because of this latest tragic event. CNN is on the frontlines of what is a brutal civil war, talking to survivors of a chemical attack that killed more than 80 people. The victims in their own words, next.\n\n\n[06:37:26] CAMEROTA: Now to the horror in Syria. The Trump administration facing a critical international crisis in the wake of that chemical attack that killed more than 80 people, at least 20 of those victims were children. CNN's Ben Wedeman spoke with survivors of this attack as they were\n\nbeing treated across the border in Turkey. We want to warn you, these images are very difficult to watch.\n\n\nBEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was the latest of a long series of horrors that is the war in Syria. Early Tuesday morning, the town of Khan Sheikhoun was rocked by explosions. And, suddenly, there was pandemonium.\n\nHundreds, including many children, struggling for breath, foaming at the mouth.\n\nWhat exactly happened Tuesday morning isn't clear. The result, however, is.\n\nFor the lucky who survived, like 55-year-old Aisha Tilawi (ph), now in a Turkish hospital, the memories return.\n\n\"There was an airstrike,\" she says. I saw yellow and blue. We felt dizzy and fainted.\"\n\nAkhmed Abdul Rahim (ph) still has trouble breathing or reconciling Tuesday's events.\n\n\"I don't know what happened to my children,\" he says.\n\nTurkish teams in full chemical suits are deployed in no man's land to wash down those coming to Turkey for treatment. While a Turkish mobile lab for nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons detection heads across the border.\n\nThirteen-year-old Masin Youssef (ph), Aisha's grandson, is back on his feet at the hospital, but the trauma has seared his soul.\n\n\"I saw the explosion in front of my grandfather's house,\" he recalls. \"I ran to their house bare foot. I saw my grandfather sitting like this, suffocated. Then I became dizzy.\"\n\nHow many of his relatives were killed? \"Nineteen,\" he responds.\n\n(on camera): The Syrian civil war is now into its seventh year. It's left hundreds of thousands of people dead. This was not the first chemical attack, and it probably won't be the last. All these years, diplomats and politicians have talked and talked, but people continue to die.\n\n[06:40:07] I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, on the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\n\nCUOMO: All right. So, anybody with eyes and a heart knows that this is wrong, but it's important to hear the first line of Ben's piece. This is the latest in a long line of attacks just like this. The last one in 2013 had so many more victims that looked and felt just like the ones you just saw, and it led to nothing by anyone in the international community that had any meaningful impact of change. So, it leads to the same question today. What can be done?\n\nLet's discuss this right now. We have our CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour.\n\nAnd the context matters here. Everybody is feeling it right now. We felt it back then. Nothing happened.\n\nIn your opinion, what are the legitimate options on the table for something to be different this time?\n\nCHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, everybody has been waiting to see how an immediate foreign policy crisis would affect the Trump administration.\n\nAnd President Trump showed how it affected him to the world yesterday at the Rose Garden, talking about these babies, talking about these children, the women, the civilians who were killed in this horrific manner that he said was an affront to civilization and an affront to us all, calling it a heinous crime. And basically saying that he had done a 180 on Syria and Assad, talking about lines that had been crossed, many, many lines, including beyond a red line.\n\nHe kept doubling down on his outrage. He didn't back down when people asked him about it. He just kept going on about how bad this was.\n\nAnd that in conjunction with what his U.N. ambassador has said at the Security Council that we might have to do something ourselves if the U.N. won't, what his vice president said that all options are on the table, what his secretary of state said that we believe that there is no doubt that Assad did perpetrate this, and the Turks now have said that the autopsies, along with the U.N.'s WHO, prove that this was a chemical weapons attack.\n\nSo, Chris, it is true that we've seen this before, but the one in 2013 was the biggest one. In the interim, there's been lots of chemical weapons attacks and things like that. Nothing like this one, again, four years later --\n\nCUOMO: Right.\n\nAMANPOUR: -- which is a nerve gas.\n\nAnd so, there are options that are being suggested for a punitive limited measure taken against Assad. Not a regime change. Not an invasion. But for instance, taking out airfields, disabling the planes, they are the only people who fly these planes and drop these barrel bombs full of this stuff.\n\nAnd so, there are options. Israel has shown it has conducted these kinds of options when its own interest are being threaten by Assad during this war, and other people have believed that unless some punitive measure is taken, yes, this will happen again.\n\nCAMEROTA: So, Christiane, is there a sense that the international community, the leaders who have spoken out about this in the U.K., in France, in Israel, the U.S. now, that they will come together and do something this time?\n\nAMANPOUR: Look, we just don't know. We see the president of the United States was very moved and very angry an... (truncated)",

        "text":"Rising Star Interview: Ruchi Aswal\n\nPosted: 08\/21\/2019 - 23:29\n\nThis October, the\u00a0Future of Sourcing Awards\u00a0will celebrate individuals newer to the industry whose thought leadership and expertise have shown promise that is likely to have a lasting impact on the industry. Below, read about Rising Star Finalist Ruchi Aswal who\u00a0leads customer engagement and product management for SAP Ariba Supplier Risk solutions that assess, monitor and mitigate supplier risks throughout the sourcing and procurement processes.\n\nHow did you get into this field \u2013 was it purposeful or by accident?\n\nIt was by accident. \u00a0\u00a0\nI studied engineering and entered the industry as a Quality Assurance (QA) engineer. I worked as an engineer for a couple of year before I realized I wanted to be more directly involved in solving user problems and overall product development and delivery. I decided to transition from my role as a QA engineer for the sourcing and contract management solutions to a product manager role for supplier risk solutions. Four years later, I now lead the product management team for Supplier Risk and Sustainability solutions. \u00a0\n\nIn what ways do you hope to influence or transform the industry?\n\nWe recently built a third-party risk management system that introduces a risk control framework to identify, assess and mitigate risk in trading partner engagements. We still have some work to do there, but I can already see how it\u2019s bringing a transformational change in our customers\u2019 risk practices and more transparency across categories and departments. \u00a0\nThe other area where I hope to transform the industry is sustainable procurement. I would like to build solutions that bring social and environment sustainability to the core of procurement. \u00a0\n\nWho are the mentors or role models who have guided you in your career?\n\nPadmini Ranganathan has been my mentor for some years now and has helped me navigate my professional journey. She is a visionary and has helped me realize what I am capable of achieving regardless of the challenges. \u00a0\n\nLooking ahead, what trends do you think will emerge in the sourcing and procurement space?\n\nI see two important trends emerging: sustainable procurement and intelligent spend management.\nA. Sustainable procurement\nEarlier this year SAP Ariba conducted a multi-country consumer study with Reputation Institute (of the global 100) covering 10,000 consumers:\u00a0\n  \u2022 On average, 53% of millennials would be willing to pay more for brands that build more visibility into their purchasing practices.\n  \u2022 In emerging markets, 80% of consumers would be willing to pay a premium for products from an industry that actively works to reduce its environmental footprint. \u00a0\n  \u2022 52% of consumers (and 67% of millennials) prefer buying from companies that are open and transparent in their operations. \u00a0\n\nThis and other studies like it demonstrate that being sustainable can be profitable in long run. We already see the shift happening. \u00a0\n\nAt SAP Ariba, we are working with several partners who have valuable data that once embedded into a procurement system can help procurement professionals make better, more informed decisions. \u00a0\n\nB. Intelligent Spend Management\u00a0\u00a0\nIntelligent spend management is about managing all categories of spend from a single platform, automating repetitive processes and infusing the process with intelligence that delivers actionable insights.\u00a0\n\nWhat is something you wish more people knew about the sourcing and procurement industry?\n\nWe know consumers vote with their dollars and increasingly people are making more socially conscious purchase decisions. But even before consumers make those decisions, it\u2019s the sourcing and procurement professionals who decide on who, where, what, how to buy the materials that go into the products consumers buy. To effect real and sustainable change, start with the sourcing and procurement industry. While cost cutting may be what these professional are most well-known for, understand that these professionals are making decisions every day that impact people and the planet. \u00a0\n\nWhat advice do you have for those who are considering a career in sourcing or procurement?\n\nI would suggest networking with like-minded people and finding the opportunities that excite you. Say yes often and bring your passion to every project \u2013 no matter how small it may seem. \u00a0\n\nAbout The Author\n\nRuchi Aswal's picture\n\nRuchi Aswal leads customer engagement and product management for SAP Ariba Supplier Risk solutions that assess, monitor and mitigate supplier risks throughout the sourcing and procurement processes. Ruchi is responsible for maintaining and delivering Supplier Risk product roadmap, gaining consistent praises from customers, partners and industry peers alike. Ruchi\u2019s perspective on customer challenges and how to solve them has been instrumental in building the product. She has led the team through complete product lifecycle -- including customer workshops, building requirements, functional specifications, UX wireframes, quality assurance and roll-out. Ruchi has an engineering degree in Information Technology. Previous work experiences include the role of QA analyst for investment banking applications.",

        "text":"The Picture Book Buzz\n\nThe Picture Book Buzz: Interview with Anna Forrester\n\nI chose Anna Forrester and her debut picture book, Bat Count: A Citizen Science Story, to kick off a new portion of my blog - The Picture Book Buzz. My goal for 2017 is to post interviews with authors at least once a month, on Mondays.\n\nMany organizations use citizen scientists to help them gather information, to assist in the conservation and preservation of our world. I have participated in the Great Backyard Bird Count (December) and the Project Feeder Watch (November- April) with The Cornell Lab of Ornithology. for many years.\n\nIn her debut picture book, Anna Forrester explores a family's participation in a citizen science project - the bat count. See my Perfect Picture Book Friday, #PPBF post on January 20, 2017, for a review of Anna's book.\n\nME: Tell us a little about yourself. (Who was your biggest inspiration as a child? Where\/when do you write? How long have you been writing? What is your favorite type of book to write?)\n\nANNA: I grew up in the Midwest \u2013 in Missouri \u2013 and was the youngest of four kids. The first story I ever remember writing was in second grade and was about a girl who had no bones. I think I illustrated it too: in my memory, she wore a big, sunny, yellow dress with green spots\n\nRight out of college I became a teacher in New York City \u2013 kindergarten and second grade \u2013 and I went to graduate school for education. That was when I wrote my first children\u2019s book. But I couldn\u2019t handle the uncertainty of being a writer, so I started working with schools that were building gardens, and then went back to school again and became a landscape architect. I still do landscape design work \u2013 as a consultant focusing on play and kid's spaces \u2013 but a few years ago I returned to writing and quickly began to focus more on that. The uncertainty feels much more manageable this time around.\n\nWhat is something no one (or few) knows about you?\n\nWhen I was just out of college and living in New York City, I caught a hamster running across a terrace in the West Village, right outside this place called The James Beard House. I took him back to my apartment, built a cage out of two plastic milk crates and named him James Beard. His squeaky wheel kept me up at night, but otherwise he was an okay pet.\n\nWhat was your inspiration for Bat Count?\n\nMy family does bat counts every summer in central Pennsylvania. I struggle with feeling helpless about the ecological crises that we are living through now, and I worry that kids who are growing up with constant news about climate change and all sorts of extinctions may experience similar feelings. BAT COUNT captures some of that distress and tries to offer a little hope.\n\nWhat was the hardest portion to write or part to research for this book? (Or both)\n\nI found the writing much harder than the research \u2013 especially the ending. But I really do believe in this idea that we leave ourselves clues in our writing. So, in grappling with the ending, I eventually fixed on the fact that, for no particular reason, I had given Jojo twin brothers. In those twins \u2013 whose birth had forced Jojo to grow up faster and had turned her into an older sibling with a lot of responsibility \u2013 I found a solution. The parallel of the bat mama having twins provides Jojo with concrete hope, and it also gives Jojo a chance to connect with her mom and get some needed love and validation. Hope, love, and validation \u2013 what could be more important?\n\nDid you ever think about writing this from a third person POV and making it a nonfiction PB? Why did you chose first person POV?\n\nI never thought about non-fiction, probably because the story \u2013 for me \u2013 is as much about struggling with feelings of ecological hopelessness as it is about the facts of bat life cycles and white nose syndrome. As for third person: I looked back through my drafts and it was always in first person! Which isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing (It\u2019s always good to experiment with different perspectives). But I think first person makes Jojo\u2019s struggle immediate and relatable.\n\nME: I agree with you, Anna. The 1st person POV places the reader squarely into the emotions of Jojo and her mother regarding the diminishing numbers of the bats in their barn and their joy at the end. The reader's connection with Jojo and her family is part of what makes this book such a jewel.\n\nWhat one thing do you hope your readers take away from Bat Count?\n\nThe idea that they can make a difference \u2013 that they can get involved, through citizen science, and help scientists work towards solutions to environmental and ecological problems. (You can find all sorts of great projects on line at: scistarter.org; www.zooniverse.org; and http:\/\/www.birds.cornell.edu\/page.aspx?pid=1664)\n\nME: It may feel like a small, inconsequential thing to count bats or birds. But citizen scientists have allowed The Cornell Lab of Ornithology to track the migration pattern changes of birds around the world. These results help them argue for climate change and try to preventing further extinctions. Check out how you, too, can help.\n\nWhat do you know about writing or publishing now, that you wish you had known when you started writing?\n\nSo, I always imagined myself publishing trade books. And I still hope to. But I really thought that trade publishing was somehow \u2018better\u2019 than educational publishing. Which isn\u2019t true at all \u2013 the two are just different.\n\nI have been SO happy with the process of publishing this first book in the education market. Because the book has the kind of content it does, when I talk about it I have all of this stuff to talk about \u2013 bats, white nose syndrome, citizen science -- in addition to the characters and the writing and the story. And for whatever reason, that feels super comfortable for me and is really satisfying.\n\nWhat is your favorite animal? Why?\n\nMy latest obsession is with this little creature called a fairy shrimp -- although I have yet to actually see one in real life! Fairy shrimp only live in vernal pools, and last spring I visited a LOT of vernal pools looking for fairy shrimp, but I never saw a single one. This spring I will keep looking.\n\nFairy shrimp are close cousins of Sea Monkeys, and triops (which some kids may know), and they have been around for 400 million years. They truly are \u2018living fossils\u2019.\n\nGood luck, Anna, in finding your elusive fairy shrimp. I hope you continue counting bats and that scientists find a way to combat the white-nose syndrome. Thank you for stopping by and discussing your amazing book and yourself.

        "text":"Dialogue: Ken Burns\n\n\nFor nearly three decades, documentarian Ken Burns has tackled subjects with an unmistakably American flavor. The Brooklyn-born helmer has used his signature narration-over-photos technique to tell the rich history of baseball, jazz and America's Civil War. Once again, the Oscar-nominated director has turned his lens toward war -- this time World War II. Throughout the 14-hour-plus film, simply titled \"The War,\" Burns debunks the myth of a heroic conflict and instead brings to life the destruction wrought. Despite its decidedly American point of view, international audiences, particularly the French, are embracing the film, which will unspool here and air on PBS in September. Burns spoke about his relationship with Hollywood, the French and his decision to return to the battlefront.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter:\nWhat was the genesis of this film?\n\nKen Burns: It was 17 years ago, and we had just finished the Civil War project. We had decided not to go to war again because of how emotionally devastating it was. Even as far removed as those old sepia photographs were, we really had been touched to the bone by it. We kept turning away colleagues and folks from around the world who were like, 'You've got to do World War II,' but we said, 'Nope, sorry.' But toward the end of 1992, I heard a statistic that we were losing 1,000 veterans a day from the second World War. I'm in the memory business, and this was a hemorrhage too devastating to deal with. And then I heard a lot of kids think we fought with the Germans against the Russians in the second World War.\n\nTHR: You tackle the subject in an interesting way -- looking at four towns affected by the war. What made you choose that tactic to tell this mammoth story?\n\nBurns: We weren't going to dive in to just one single moment, one battle. We weren't going to do this overarching thing that is distracted by celebrity generals and politicians, strategy and tactics, weapons and armaments and all things Nazi. Instead, we picked four geographically distributed American towns and got to know the towns, got to know the movie palaces where they saw the newsreels, saw who was left behind. Then followed these boys off to hell. Not the good war of our imaginations and subsequent PR but the worst war ever. We wanted to tell it from the bottom up, uninterested in experts.\n\nTHR: Why was it the worst war ever?\n\nBurns: Fifty million to 60 million people died. There has been nothing bigger in the history of humankind, and yet we wrap it with this gallant, bloodless myth. We wanted to remind people (of the war's horrors). You spend 75% of this film in battle, undistracted by generals and tactics. It's just people you might have spent Thanksgiving with.\n\nTHR: What kind of response have you received?\n\nBurns: It's been so overwhelming across the spectrum internationally. I've shown it to a standing ovation to 1,100 cadets at West Point, showing them horrible things their own army did. I've shown it to a sold-out crowd at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. We've been selected for Cannes. It's unprecedented to be showing 14 hours in the festival.\n\nTHR: This is your first Cannes festival. As someone who makes movies about quintessentially American topics, were you surprised to be so embraced by the French?\n\nBurns: The French have been so amazing. I never in a million years would have thought I would be invited. We showed one episode last year at the Telluride Film Festival, and the groundswell of interest has been unbelievable. Next thing they were calling from Cannes saying, \"We want you.\" It's just a thrilling affirmation of nearly seven years of work.\n\nTHR: You decided to do this film before the current war in Iraq. And yet the timing seems eerily appropriate.\n\nBurns: This film, which doesn't have a political bone in its body, nevertheless resonates with all wars and the horrible truth of war. So when you watch it, an interviewee might be saying, \"There's no such thing as a good war, only a necessary war.\" And you're thinking, \"My God, he must be talking about Iraq,\" when in fact we interviewed him years before Iraq. I don't want to say it's a political film. It's not. I bet if you could resurrect some Greek soldier from the Peloponnesian War, he'd say the same thing: \"War is hell,\" just as Sherman said during our Civil War documentary.\n\nTHR: The film and its narrative structure seem, in some ways, simple. You tackle the war chronologically and focus on just a few people to bring to life the scope of the war. Was it easy?\n\nBurns: It was the most complicated film I've ever done. But each day of editing, you realized the reward was ... for the first time, the larger picture of the second World War was coming clear. There is an increased intimacy. Of the 40 people on camera, more than 30 of them are what I would call secondary characters. It's really a handful of living people carrying the film. Another five to 10 people didn't survive to provide their voices, but we were able to use Tom Hanks, Josh Lucas, Samuel L. Jackson, Bobby Cannavale, Eli Wallach and Adam Arkin to make these people come alive.\n\nTHR: You obviously know how to tell a story cinematically. Have you ever considered crossing over to make narrative features?\n\nBurns: I've flirted with Hollywood. I have some things in development, but I keep coming back to documentaries because I am in the history business and I've always found that truth is much more interesting than fiction.\n\n\nNationality: American (born in Brooklyn); born: July 29, 1953\n\nSelected filmography: \"Brooklyn Bridge\" (1981), \"The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God\" (1984), \"The Statue of Liberty\" (1985), \"Huey Long\" (1985), \"The Congress\" (1988), \"Thomas Hart Benton\" (1988), \"The Civil War\" (1990), \"Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio\" (1991), \"Baseball\" (1994), \"The West\" (1996), \"Thomas Jefferson\" (1997), \"Lewis & Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery\" (1997), \"Frank Lloyd Wright\" (1998), \"Not for Ourselves Alone: Elizabeth Cady Stanton & Susan B.

The mission is to empower member banks to diversify prudently into high-quality loans that meet all commercial and regulatory standards \u2013 without changing the nature of the community bank.\n\nBrian\u2019s team initially focused on large commercial loans. Then, in February of this year, they expanded to consumer credit with the announcements that BancAlliance would partner with Lending Club to enable member banks to offer co-branded personal loans to their customers through Lending Club\u2019s online platform. The program gives community banks and their customers access to the benefits of the Lending Club\u2019s low cost of operations, paired with the banks\u2019 low cost of capital, to help drive down the cost of credit for consumers., The Wall Street Journal noted that, even after Lending Club\u2019s partnerships with Alibaba and Google, the arrangement with BancAlliance might be its \u201cbiggest one yet.\u201d CEO of Lending Club, Renaud Laplanche (whom I interviewed in Episode 5), said, \u201cCommunity banks are the lifeblood of American communities. This program will help them level the playing field with national banks by offering affordable, consumer-friendly loans to their customers. We\u2019re excited to make Lending Club\u2019s low cost of operations available to community banks, for the greater benefit of their customers.\u201d\n\nBancAlliance\u2019s network includes over 200 banks in 39 states, with assets ranging from $200 million to $10 billion. In aggregate, BancAlliance would rank fourth in branch count among all U.S. banks and 14th in assets.\n\nI have been a longtime optimist about the future of community banks, until the last few years. Small banks today face the twin challenges of innovative technology and regulatory burden squeezing the industry\u2019s business model from two directions at once. Brian\u2019s vision offers a potential model for addressing both.\n\nIn our conversation, Brian makes the case for the value of community banks; offers advice to them for thriving through technological disruption; and makes suggestions for regulators (including on \u201csuitability). He also describes a proposed new \u201cbill of rights\u201d for small business borrowers \u2013 he\u2019s been involved with a coalition working on this with the Aspen Institute.\n\nBrian also offers insights into how technology, after decades of favoring consolidation and large players, is suddenly creating advantages for small ones, through the unbundling of tech solutions and through unexpected developments like Square, transforming the small business lending market.\n\nBrian was previously a partner at Blue Ridge Capital Management, held various leadership positions at CapitalSource and Fannie Mae, and served in the government and investment-banking sectors. He holds a graduate degree from Harvard College and an MBA from Stanford University.\n\nIt was a pleasure to host him at my former abode in Washington, DC -- the day before I began packing up to move to Boston for my new fellowship on Regulation Innovation at Harvard! It was a very fitting finale for my Washington days and a launch into my \u201cyear at the frontier\u201d of fintech innovation.\n\nEnjoy the conversation, and as a bonus, click the following for The Small Borrowers\u2019 Bill of Rights and an argument from the Aspen Institute on why we need one.\n\nAlso, remember to watch my website for the Regulation Innovation video briefings on these same topics, coming soon!\n\nPlease subscribe to the podcast by opening your favorite podcast app and searching for \"Jo Ann Barefoot\", or in iTunes.",

        "text":"Parties \u00bb After Hours \u00bb Parties \u00bb Jennifer Lawrence's New York Hunger Games Premiere\n\nJennifer Lawrence's New York Hunger Games Premiere\n\nJennifer Lawrence's New York Hunger Games Premiere\n\nThe lobby of the School of Visual Arts Theatre in Chelsea looked like the setting of Take Your Children to Work Tuesday evening, what with all the young girls in cardigans and flouncy dresses and boys in Justin Bieber-style kicks running around. But it was more like Take Your Children to Premiere night, specifically a Cinema Society and Calvin Klein-hosted screening of The Hunger Games. As the likes of Zoe Kravitz (whose dad, Lenny, plays costume designer Cinna in the film), Melanie Laurent, Irina Shayk and Gayle King milled around and the male leads Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth took their turn on the step and repeat, I caught up with Jennifer Lawrence, aka Katniss Everdeen, in a curve hugging deep green Calvin Klein dress, to chat bows and arrows and dealing with the hype.\n\nblog-jennifer-lawrence-hunger-games-permiere-01.jpgJennifer Lawrence\n\nYou must have picked up some mad archery skills while playing Katniss. Are you a killshot now?\nJennifer Lawrence: Well, I honestly haven\u2019t done it since we wrapped. I kept telling myself I would and that\u2019s why there are arrows in the back of my car, but I haven\u2019t really had time to get back. But I do love it. I\u2019m really happy I picked it up.\n\nI heard the shoot in North Carolina was 105 degrees. Were you dying in those costumes?\nIt was pretty hot. Just grin and bear it.\n\nWas it like Method acting?\nYeah, well it is easier when you don\u2019t have to fake the elements.\n\nDid the training for Hunger Games help prepare you for the media circus that you\u2019ve been going through?\nI don\u2019t think anything could have helped me for the media circus!\n\nWhich was easier: training for the Hunger Games or this non-stop press gauntlet?\nThe training was a lot easier because it\u2019s just like, do this, this many times and you\u2019re done. But the press, there\u2019s no right or wrong, it\u2019s just like I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s this complicated, never-ending circus that I\u2019ll never understand.\n\nYou famously wore that stunning red Calvin Klein dress as a nominee at last year\u2019s Oscars and you\u2019re in another Calvin dress now in a very different scenario. I\u2019m wondering what you were feeling then versus now, how your mindset has changed between these two moments?\nMentally, I haven\u2019t changed. I keep waiting to because everyone keeps asking, \u201cDo you feel different?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t really feel different, I just feel overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nAnd this is obviously going to be a defining role for your career beyond all the future work you do. Is that something you\u2019ve come to terms with?\nYeah, it was one of the first things I gripped because it\u2019s a big thing to understand when you do something like that. But this is a character that I admire and I love and a story I\u2019m really proud of and feel really strongly about, so I wouldn\u2019t have done any franchise if it weren\u2019t this one. This is something that I\u2019d be proud to go back to for years and talk about for years.\n\nPhoto: Patrick McMullan\n\nSee More After Hours",

        "text":"How I Write: \u2018The Tragedy of Arthur\u2019 by Arthur Phillips\n\nArthur Phillips, the author of The Tragedy of Arthur says he would like to take Shakespeare to the movie Anonymous, which claimed the Bard didn\u2019t write any of the plays and that the real author was Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford.\n\n08.22.12 2:15 PM ET\n\nWhere did you grow up?\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nWhere and what did you study?\nMedieval history at Harvard. Jazz saxophone at Berklee.\n\nWhere do you live and why?\nBrooklyn. Close to friends and family, and publishing. And a dog park.\n\nDescribe your morning routine.\nWake obscenely early, empty the dogs, exercise, breakfast with kids, see off everyone to school, then go to write.\n\nWhat is a distinctive habit or affectation of yours?\u00a0\nI am notorious for always having two beagles with me, in any and all circumstances.\n\nPlease recommend three books (not your own) to your readers.\nI just finished reading the stunningly good The Vanishers by Heidi Julavits. Can't rave enough about it. I am seriously considering re-reading all 12 volumes of Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time, even though it's only been a few years since I read it the first time. I recently blurbed Jennifer DuBois's A Partial History of Lost Causes, a book which completely disarmed me.\n\nWhat\u2019s your routine when conceiving of a book?\nJust walk the dogs. The rest will fall into place. I just go to a cafe. I've gone to a cafe for 3-6 hours every day, nearly every single day, for the last 15 years. That seems to be working.\n\nIs there anything distinctive or unusual about your work space?\nI like the window seats. Nothing distinctive, except the constant flow of tea and pastry.\n\nWhat do you do when you are stuck or have temporary writer\u2019s block?\u00a0\nSo far, no troubles on that front. That may just be because I have a low bar for what passes as a \"productive\" day. I need only to have sat in place, in front of my notebook, for a couple hours, and not have been distracted by anything else. As long as I gave the time over to my writing, it doesn't matter whether I actually wrote any words or not.\n\nWhat is your favorite snack?\nMadeleines dipped in linden tea,\u00a0of course.\n\nIf you could bring back to life one person, who would it be?\nI admit I would be curious to spend a day with Shakespeare. I have some questions for him about his methods, approaches, attitudes. We could go see Anonymous together; I wonder if it would piss him off?\n\nWhat is the story behind the publication of your first book?\nI wrote it for four years, and then a friend of a friend was becoming an agent. She had time, read it, liked it, called me. Everything went smoothly. Actually, that's a great story, only because it went exactly the way you hope it will. In short, I got incredibly lucky.\n\nWas there a specific moment when you felt you had \u201cmade it\u201d as an author?\u00a0\nGoing into a publishing house to meet an editor who might want to buy your book?\u00a0That pretty much does it.\n\nWhat would you do for work, if you were not a writer?\u00a0\nI'd go back and write something else, I suppose. Ads, press releases, speeches. All the things I wrote before I was published.\n\nWhat advice would you give to an aspiring author?\nWrite. Enjoy writing. Then, and only then, worry about the business end of it. Start loving your hobby, and then you can't go too wrong.\n\nWhat would you like carved onto your tombstone?\u00a0\nAs long as they spell your name right...\n\nWhat is your next project?\u00a0\nA TV pilot for HBO, and a\u00a0book of stories that I'm just now sketching out. I'm trying to do both at once, and feeling very uncertain how that trick is done.",

Sturges, a Massachusetts soldier serving on the United States Navy steamer \u201cMount Vernon,\u201d to an unidentified friend.\n\nAt the time of the letter, the \u201cMount Vernon\u201d was operating in the waters near Wilmington, N.C. Sturges sends his condolences to his friend, due to the loss of the friend\u2019s child, he comments on his personal religious beliefs, and also details several skirmishes near Fort Caswell.\n\n[Transcription available below images.]\n\nItem citation: From the Federal Soldiers\u2019 Letters #3185, Unit #40, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nItem transcription:\n\nUS Steamer \u201cMount Vernon\u201d\noff Wilmington N.C.\nFebry 20th 1862\n\nDear Friend\n\nYour kind regards of 23rd ult. came to hand Jnry 13th it affords me much pleasure to hear from you but it makes my heart sad to hear of the death of your child I can deeply sympathize with you by haveing had to pass through those trying moments myself. But its the Lord that giveth and taketh and all we can say is his Holy will be done. We can always feel happy to know that they are with Jesus, and are awaiting to welcome us home to that happy happy shore where trials and troubles are o[v]er. Oh what great inducements are held out to us to reach that Heavenly home, Christ is there. dear friends are there. Blessings are there. and I trust that we will be there, I pray that Jesus will not forsake us but will give us the full assurance that we are accepted of him. I can but say precious Jesus thou art mine, its hard work for me to write my feelings, if I was only with you in person I could then unfold the love to my dear dear Jesus from a sailors heart. pray for me dear Brother and Christ will reward you openly.\n\nOwing to our sailing so soon from Hampton Roads I did not get the package of Books, but trust I shall get them when we go back wich will be about 11th March. I should like to have been at the dedication, it dont seem to me as I can ever give up the Old South Church it will appear strange to me to pass by it. One thing I got clear of hearing, and, that was your letter of resignation. I do hope and pray that you will not leave Bridgeport if you do the South Church, I cannot hear the idea of parting from one who has done me so much good. do try and hold on somehow. I am well aware of youre troubles. but still I cannot let you go.\n\nWe was cheated in our expectation to join the Burnside Expedition. I\u2019ve never detailed for that purpose but on examination we found that our ship\u2019s draft of water was about five feet too much, so you may well judge our feelings. within a few days we have had two little skirmishes with the rebels. we opened the Balls on both occasions and fired the last shot. we do it to draw their fire and test the size and quality of their guns, we are satisfied that they have no rifled guns on \u201cFort Caswell,\u201d we can easily tell when a shell comes from a rifled gun as it comes whistling all sort of tunes. it makes a fellow feel streaked when the shell begin to burst around him at first, but after a few shots we go at it like sawing logs and think nothing about danger.\n\nBy the appearance of things ashore they must expect an attack as they are reinforcing the Fort, and placing obstructions in the Channell. We lay anchored about three miles from the town of Smithville and if the Department would allow us we could knock it all to pieces in three hours, it is a small town of about 200 Houses and about 1200 inhabitants. we have positive orders not to molest it. it will be a very easy fort to take. these Forts at the entrance of Wilmington and at Beaufort N.C. The rebel flag has been hoisted about nine hours during the last seventy days on Fort Caswell. we know they have one and think they cannot feel very proud of it or they would show it more. I think you must be getting tired of reading my letter. but there is nothing else to write about just now.\n\nPlease remember me to [inquiring?] friends and accept those with my best wishes for youre future welfare.\n\nYours truly\nHenry L.

        "text":"Monday, November 14, 2011\n\nExcerpt and Interview with Aubrie Dionne, from Paradise 21\n\nHello my naughty little readers!!\u00a0 Today I have a special sneak peek inside Aubrie's new novel Paradise 21.\u00a0 I love the cover :), but as you know I'm big into sexy covers and that\u00a0hot guy's mouth is just about at the right spot...LOL!! Lets take a little looksie inside....\n\u201cMight as well stay here and make camp for the night.\u201d\n\nHis casual tone stung her composure. How could he talk of such mundane things when\u00a0they\u2019d almost been captured, when she\u2019d touched him so tenderly?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let them get farther away,\u201d Striker explained, reasonable as always. \u201cWe\u2019re going\u00a0in their direction tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe sting of rejection grew, burning a hole in her heart.\u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy what?\u201d\n\nHer lips trembled. \u201cWhy not kiss me like you did before?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He shook his head, and the air cooled between them; so much so, Aries\u00a0wondered if the desert had turned into deep space.\n\nHe\u2019d teased her with such affection before, it was cruel to take it away. \u201cI don\u2019t\u00a0understand,\u201d she said, wishing she didn\u2019t care, wishing she could stop all the emotions he\u2019d\u00a0started in her heart.\n\nAries caught a glimpse of pain etched in the wrinkles around his eyes. Striker turned\u00a0away and started pulling supplies out of his backpack. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\nStriker shook his head and Aries prompted, \u201cCan\u2019t kiss me, can\u2019t trust me? What?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t allow myself to get tangled up with someone. Not again.\u201d\n\nThe thoughts of Striker with another woman confused her. On the New Dawn, everyone\u00a0had one lifemate and that was it. \u201cYou mean you loved someone before?\u201d\n\nStriker\u2019s hand tightened on the backpack. \u201cI trusted someone a long time ago, allowed\u00a0myself to love, if you will. She hurt me so much I lost my entire life and ended up here. I can\u2019t\u00a0experience that kind of pain again.\u201d\n\nAries clasped her hand over her heart. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nHe waved her apology off as if it meant nothing. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough world, Aries. And it\u2019s\u00a0dangerous to love. If I were you, I\u2019d keep my heart well-guarded, because you never know when\u00a0it will affect your decisions, when it will make you weak.\u201d\n\nAries couldn\u2019t take his advice. Watching him talk about his past made her realize she\u2019d\u00a0already given up her heart.\n\nHe had it.\n\nHow old were you when you first realized you wanted to write?\n\nI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. My first poem (maybe about 4th grade) was about how I wanted to see a unicorn but since they weren\u2019t real I would never get my wish. (Really, I was a happy child, though.)\n\nI began writing seriously about six years ago when I couldn\u2019t find books with the right balance of fantasy, science fiction, romance, and action for my tastes. Then, I realized just how hard it is to write!\n\nLOL...I'm quite sure it is hard!\u00a0Most authors have an unusual story or way that they come up with their ideas for books\u2026Do you have one?\n\nI used to come up with all sorts of ideas while sitting in orchestra. (I\u2019m a professional flutist). Flute players have to rest a lot (sometimes 60 measures at a time), so I\u2019d make up stories to go along with the music.\n\nNow, I get a lot of ideas while commuting to work. One of my jobs is an hour and ten minutes away, so I have a lot of time to think!\n\nWow...That is a big commute! What was your biggest influence that steered you towards writing?\n\nThe Star Wars movies. They sparked my imagination throughout my childhood. I used to act each scene out with my sister. Our swing set was a spaceship, and we\u2019d swing to power it. We used to fight over who got to be princess Leia!\n\nI have to ask, what are the hardest scenes \u00a0for you to write?\n\nThe male point of view scenes are hard for me, because I\u2019m such a pink, frilly, girly girl. It took me a long time to figure out how to talk and act like a male romance hero should. They don\u2019t talk as much, and they don\u2019t notice the same things women do.\n\nThat's actually a new answer, most writers say sex scenes. Do you see yourself writing in another genre?\n\nI love science fiction and fantasy. I also tried horror, but my stories weren\u2019t very scary. I\u2019m not sure why. I love horror movies.\n\nHas your family been supportive?\n\nYes, they all came to my recent book signing at Barnes and Noble!\u00a0\n\nThat's awesome :) Are any of your characters reflective of you?\n\nThey all have a piece of me in them, even the bad guys. It\u2019s really scary to recognize that, but I\u2019m coming to terms with it.\n\nHey..bad guys can be cool! What do you like to do when you're not writing?\n\nI play flute at people\u2019s weddings and other special events, and I\u2019m on the sub list for a number of orchestras. My next concert is very special to me because I\u2019m playing flute with my old teacher, someone very dear to my heart.\n\nWho is your favorite book heroine?\n\nI love Jane Eyre. She\u2019s so strong despite her circumstances, and she sticks to her ideals. She didn\u2019t become Rochester\u2019s mistress as much as she loved him.\n\nWhat is your favorite mystical creature?\n\nI love unicorns. So. Much. My favorite books growing up were the Secret of the Unicorn Series. I\u2019d love to write about unicorns, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what people like to read about nowadays.\n\nOHH!!\u00a0 One of my favorite movies was The Last Unicorn! Where are your books available?\n\nOn Amazon:\n\nOn Barnes and Noble:\n\nWhat can we expect from you in the future?\n\nTundra 37, the sequel to the New Dawn series comes out in January. I\u2019m so excited about it. I think I love it even more than Paradise 21. It has alien mammoths, cyber women, tragic love, sweet romance, and lots of laser fights.\n\nWhere can we reach you and become informed of updates?\n\n\nMy blog:\n\nMy website:\n\nAubrie's next few\u00a0stops on her tour are:\nNov 15: Coffee Beans & Love Scenes (Giveaway\/Interview)\n\nNov 16: Reviews By Molly (Giveaway\/Excerpt)\nNov 17: My Devotional Thoughts (Review\/Giveaway)\nNov 18: The Magic Attic (Giveaway\/Excerpt)\nNov 19: Coffee Beans & Love Scenes (Giveaway\/Excerpt)\nNov 20: Sara Trimble (Interview\/Review)\nWell this just sounds yummy!!!\u00a0I had the pleasure of getting to know Aubrie a little better.\u00a0 She agreed to answer some questions about herself and her writing.\u00a0 And\u00a0the trailer!!!\n\n\nAubrie said...\n\nThanks for hosting me today!\n\nNora Weston said...\n\nGreat interview! You are a musician I also thought it was funny what you said about writing horror. :) And Jane Eyre? Yes! She is one tough lady. I like her as well. Paradise 21 sounds fantastic!\n\nKathryn Merkel said...\n\nI agree with Nikki, your answer about it being hard to write from the hero's POV is unusual. If I was writing, I think that would be hard for me too. Really makes me wonder how the ladies who write M\/M books get it right, or do they?\n\ndrainbamaged.gyzmo at\n\nDisqus for Close Encounters with the NIght Kind\n\n\nCopyright Text",

        "text":"The Model Railway Show \u2013 Episode 0049\n\nThis episode of The Model Railway Show is made possible with the support of the National Model Railroad Association.\n\nWater, Trees and All That\n\nIn this episode\u2026\n\nDave Frary, author.\nGordon Gravett, author.\n\nFrom Thatcher\u2019s Inlet to Nantucket\n\nDave Frary needs no introduction \u2013 especially not to narrow gauge enthusiasts who look to the eastern seaboard for inspiration.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dave and his friend Bob Hayden introduced many hobbyists to the charms of HOn30 with their influential, four-part Thatcher\u2019s Inlet series for Railroad Model Craftsman magazine. (If you missed it the first time around, that series can be found online at the HOn30 Home Depot as a 22-page PDF.) Dave has also penned a number of books (including the go-to guide for scenery, How to Build Realistic Model Railroad Scenery) and hosts a series of DVDs and downloadable videos \u2013 all available through his Blue Ribbon Models website.\n\nDave has built a number of professional projects for others in his workshop, including a 28-foot long, On30 layout for the Whaling Museum of the Nantucket Historical Association. (This layout was the cover story in the May-June 2011 issue of the Narrow Gauge and Short Line Gazette, and a 10-page PDF that describes the layout may be downloaded from Dave\u2019s website.)\n\nDave joins Jim to discuss the demands of building a layout for a museum, his long-time friendship with Bob, how the scenery book came about, and the aspect of scenery-building that scares modelers the most.\n\nBuilding Better Trees\n\nThis is a model. Seriously.\n\nThe trees in that photograph can be found on Pempoul, a French meter gauge exhibition layout built by Gordon Gravett in 1:50 scale. Have a look at more of Gordon\u2019s work.\n\nGoogle \u201cGordon Gravett Pempoul\u201d and you\u2019ll find more images, such as theseand theseand these. You\u2019ll even find some video (we like this one).\n\nWhile all of Gordon\u2019s modeling is of exceptional quality, what you\u2019re likely to remember most are the trees. Gordon builds some of the most realistic trees ever seen on a model railway \u2013 and, so that you can too, he has written two books that describe his techniques. They\u2019re called Modelling Trees Volume 1 (Broadleaf) and Modelling Trees Volume 2 (Conifers), both available from Wild Swan Publications in the UK.\n\nGordon joins Trevor (who was fighting a nasty cold at the time) to discuss why he feels it\u2019s important to model trees correctly on a layout and how his techniques evolved. He also discusses why he looked across the English Channel to Brittany to pick a French meter gauge subject for his layout, and why he built Pempoul in the unusual scale of 1:50.\n\n(NOTE: Wild Swan does not have a web site or email, but contact information is listed in the ads linked above.
