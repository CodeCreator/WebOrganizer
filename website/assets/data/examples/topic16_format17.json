Neither seems appropriate here.\n\nSo, what type of adverbs \"still\" is here?\n\n\nThe adverb came from the Old English adjective stille, meaning not moving. It is used in so many different contexts that to call it an adverb of time may not always seem helpful. But if you can see how the word's meaning evolved from 'not moving' to 'unchanged' to 'as before' its connection with time becomes clear. Your sentence means, roughly, \"Everyone can, as they could before, get what I refer to.\"\n\nYou might like to study the first four subheadings here. All those examples are of its usage as a 'time adverb'. The other subheadings describe its other usages: still has a great many! When it is used like consequently or besides to join two clauses, it can be called a 'connecting adverb'.\n\n  \u2022 Thanks.

        "text":"The free dictionary gives this definition for rip on:\n\ngive someone a hard time; to hassle someone\n\nand this one for pick on:\n\nto harass or bother someone or something, usually unfairly\n\nIt sounds pretty much the same to me, but maybe there's a slight difference I don't catch?\n\n  \u2022 2\n    Could be a generation gap here but I think of bullying when I hear \"picked on\" and to me, \"rip on\" is something guys do to tease each other but it is in a joking manner, not hostile or serious. \u2013\u00a0Kristina Lopez Aug 28 '13 at 17:32\n  \u2022 I've never heard rip on. The dictionaries seem to suggest this is solely US slang. \u2013\u00a0TrevorD Aug 28 '13 at 18:36\n  \u2022 Trevor, I haven't heard it either. It is probably limited to American English. \u2013\u00a0Tristan Aug 28 '13 at 20:30\n  \u2022 I think it is fairly new here, too. It may be in another 10 years it will land at Heathrow and become part of the culture there, too. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 22:11\n\nPicking on someone implies merely bullying -- unfairly making fun of or harrassing someone because of something they can't help, such as their physical appearance or mannerisms. An example would be a short person being harrassed because of their physical size, or a person with a mole on their face being harrassed or made fun of because of the disfigurement. Or because of their religion or nationality, etc.\n\nRipping on someone involves severely criticizing their actions or their political positions, or even their work, such as your boss ripping on you for your bad job performance. Ripping may be fair or unfair, but it is generally directed at actions or attitudes.\n\n  \u2022 Right. They're different metaphors. Pick on is childish bullying, whereas rip on is verbal abuse (rip a new one). Both themes are perfectly coherent in practically any mix. \u2013\u00a0John Lawler Aug 28 '13 at 16:55\n  \u2022 I've found that one who is 'picked on' isn't always 'picked on' for a particular reason. There is often a given reason by the pick-er, but it is equally likely to occur for little to no reason at all, just that the individual they are 'picking on' is a preferred target. \u2013\u00a0Zibbobz Aug 28 '13 at 16:58\n  \u2022 That was my experience as well, @Zibbobz. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 17:01\n  \u2022 @Charles, you didn't need to delete your answer just because you thought mine was better -- there's always room for differing interpretations and points of view. In StackExchange, even the answers not Accepted can provide valuable insight. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 17:03\n\n\"Ripping On\" is a verbal exchange or a mocking behavior of someone, deriding them for the way they act. Specifically, to put down or belittle their way of acting.\n\n\"Picking On\" someone means to bully or harass someone. It can be that the person picking on someone else chooses to do so for the reason that they see fault in the way a person acts or behaves, but is not always the case.\n\n\"Picking On\" can also include physical violence, where \"Ripping On\" usually does not.\n\n  \u2022 In middle school (used to be called Junior High School where I lived then) I used to get picked on because I looked nerdy. The \"pickers\" never ripped on me. I got ripped on much later when my performance in Army Basic Training didn't match the Drill Sergeant's demands and expectations. \u2013\u00a0Cyberherbalist Aug 28 '13 at 16:59\n  \u2022 Picking On also doesn't have to included any form of Ripping On, though it can. As a particular example, in the movie \"Back to the Future\", the villian Biff Tannen most definitely picks on the lead character's father George McFly, and at the same time rips on him for his behavior. \u2013\u00a0Zibbobz Aug 28 '13 at 17:08\n\n\"Picked on\" can also imply something ongoing, or just a general climate of bullying or of being outcast. \"I was picked on in school\" could mean all through my school years, I was constantly the victim of bullying. (It could also mean \"I was picked on in school today.\") \"Ripped on\" is usually confined to describing a particular occurrence.\n\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

All I know is I keep thinking about it off-and-on but the actual title eludes me. I believe I read in the late 1990s or early 2000s, although the book may have been published before that time. It was dystopian, coming of age theme. The basic plot that I can remember is that a virus killed off all adults leaving the children behind.\n\nDetails I do remember:\n1. The protagonist was a girl on the verge of puberty.\n2. She was taking care of her younger brother and the book focused on her journey to survive.\n3. She learned how to drive a car (I think her parent's car).\n4. With her newfound ability to slowly drive, she found a warehouse where she would replenish supplies,\n5. She and her brother did befriend\/band up with other children.\n6, The ending focused on the question of her incoming puberty and if the virus was still around\/would kill her too once she became an adult.\n\nHopefully these are enough details to produce an answer!

But thank you for telling me how it's actually done! Jul 16 at 12:02\n\n1 Answer 1\n\n\nThink of \u8a9e as a suffix similar to -ese (as in Japanese and Cantonese). Unlike English -ese, it can attach to almost any noun, but you're basically coining a new word that refers to a unique language by doing so. On the other hand, A\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e is a phrase that are made of several words and means \"language of A\" or \"language spoken by A\".\n\n\u72ac\u8a9e (\"dogese\") is not a word listed in a dictionary, but it can be a valid expression if dogs in your fictional work form a community and speak a distinct language. If dogs speak English and can communicate with humans using English, \u72ac\u8a9e\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u3060 (\"Dogese is English\") makes no sense, and you have to say something like \u3053\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u72ac\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u3060 (\"The language of dogs in this world is English\") instead. \u672c\u8a9e (\"bookese\") may be valid if you're thinking of a fantasy world where books have a mouth and speak to one anther using a special language, but I personally have never seen a setting like this.\n\n(I also feel \u9752\u3044\u4eba is probably not what you want as the name for a specific tribe\/species, but it's a different story. You may be interested in this question.)\n\n  \u2022 That was a well-rounded answer to my question. It explained a lot.

You are Kamala and no one else, and within you there is a stillness and sanctuary to which you can retreat any time and be yourself, just as I can. Few people have that capacity and yet everyone could have it.\"\n\nSiddhartha goes through Kamala's garden as a gateway to giving these material possessions up later. \u00a0He must know what sex and money are before he becomes an ascetic. \u00a0Otherwise, they are mere abstractions, not real sources of temptation.\n\nAlso, Siddhartha sees his future in this chapter: he crosses the river with the aid of the ferryman. \u00a0He too will become a ferryman; it is the perfect job for him: in nature, by the river, helping others, humbling physical labor. \u00a0This chapter, the middle of the book, foreshadows his attaining nirvana by the river at the end.",

        "text":"I recently left an unnecessary comment because I could not resist telling a bad joke. That made me wonder: What would be a good (classical) Latin word for a bad quality joke? The joke can be any kind of short joke, wordplay or similar, but it has to be of terrible quality.\n\nIt is entirely possible that there is no single word for this purpose. A suggestion or two with an explanation of how they fit the bill would be great. For those who know Finnish, I am more or less looking for a translation of \"puujalkavitsi\" (literally \"peg leg joke\"). I do not know of a comparable expression in English; I would simply say that a joke or pun is terrible or corny. I am looking for an idiomatic expression for a bad joke, preferably in classical Latin.\n\n(To make this easier to find, let me repeat the key question in Finnish: Miten sanotaan \"puujalkavitsi\" latinaksi?)\n\n  \u2022 I'm not sure I understand this question. Do you want a Latin idiom to translate a Finnish idiom? Do you want a Classical Latin word or phrase, or can it be from any era? \u2013\u00a0cmw Jan 19 '17 at 6:07\n  \u2022 @C.M.Weimer I edited the question slightly in an attempt to clarify. I prefer the classical era, but good suggestions from other eras are welcome. I am looking for something similar to the Finnish idiom if any such thing exists in Latin. So yes, I am looking for a translation of the Finnish idiom, but I hope I explained my intentions clearly in English, too. \u2013\u00a0Joonas Ilmavirta Jan 19 '17 at 13:09\n  \u2022 In English, we sometimes call a bad joke a lame joke. Is this the sense behind a peg leg joke? Because someone with a peg leg would be lame! \u2013\u00a0Penelope Jan 19 '17 at 13:24\n  \u2022 @Penelope I think that's pretty close to the Finnish idiom, and certainly good for the purposes of this question. I think the point of a peg leg joke is that it limps; limping is a common figure of speech in Finnish for any kind of badly working narrative. \u2013\u00a0Joonas Ilmavirta Jan 20 '17 at 0:16\n  \u2022 1\n    The best translation into English for this Finnish word is a \"Dad Joke.\" It refers to the tendency of Dads to tell terrible corny jokes. \u2013\u00a0Nickimite Oct 7 '19 at 18:55\n\nFrigidus \/ cold can be used metaphorically to describe any kind of speech that seems flat and lifeless, whether it was an attempt at humour or not. But here we see it being applied specifically to bad jokes:\n\nHaec aut frigida sunt, aut tum salsa, cum aliud est exspectatum.\n\nThese [jokes] either fall flat, or are funny only when something else was expected.\n\nCicero, De Oratore, 2.64.260\n\nIn this quote, Cicero explicitly contrasts frigidus with salsus \/ salty, an adjective often used in a metaphorical sense for funny or witty. As an example of this, Cicero says elsewhere that he found much that was funny and witty among the Greeks:\n\nInveni autem ridicula et salsa multa Graecorum\nDe Oratore, 2.217\n\nSuetonius also uses frigidus to describe Claudius\u2019 jokes which are both bad and far-fetched:\n\nad hilaritatem homines provocaret \u2026 immixtis interdum frigidis et arcessitis iocis\n\ncalling the men to merriment \u2026 now and then mixing in bad and far-fetched jokes\n\nLives of the Caesars \u2013 Claudius, 5.21.7\n\nWhile Quintilian warns the would-be orator to avoid jokes that rely on word-play as they are often bad, even if sometimes acceptable:\n\nFiunt et adiecta et detracta adspiratione et divisis coniunctisque verbis similiter saepius frigida, aliquando tamen recipienda\n\nSimilar jokes made by adding or removing an aspirate or dividing and joining words are often bad, although sometimes acceptable\n\nOrator\u2019s Education, 6.3.55\n\n\nFollowing Cic. de orat. 2,218, I would think about two words describing this particular verborum lusus for which you are asking for: cum duo genera sint facetiarum, alterum aequabiliter in omni sermone fusum, alterum peracutum et breve, illa a veteribus superior cavillatio, haec altera dicacitas nominata est.\n\nThe first word, cavillatio (from cavilla [or cavillum], which in some cases means \"double sense\": Plaut. Aul. 638 aufer cavillam, non ego nunc nugas ago; Apul. met. 1,7 allubentia proclivis est sermonis et ioci et scitum et cavillum et iam dicacitas tinnula; is often referred in the sens of irrisio, iocus and, for quote an example, is intended as a \"bad joke\" addressed to a roman knight by the emperor Tiberius in Suet. Tib. 57:\n\nNec multo post in senatu Pompeio cuidam equiti R. quiddam perneganti, dum uincula minatur, affirmauit fore ut ex Pompeio Pompeianus fieret, acerba cauillatione simul hominis nomen incessens ueteremque partium fortunam\n\nThe second word, dicacitas, comes from dicax, which means \"quick-witted\", \"witty\", and is mainly used to define the mordaciter dicta of the rhetors (e.g. Quint. inst. 6,3,42 : in narrando ... Cicero consistere facetias putat, dictationem in iaciendo), I only found an example of the sense you mean in Aug. op. imperf. 5,15:\n\nde ferramentis agricolarum ad impraegnandas feminas adhibendis, quae tibi festivissima dicacitate sonare videbantur, cum vanitate ineptissima dicerentur\n\nWhere Augustine alludes to a coarse pun made by Julianus blaming him for the inappropriate comparison.\n\n\n  \u2022 O.

        "text":"The first mnemonic for Latin case ending I learnt was that for neuter words, the accusative form is always identical to the nominative form. This applies even to exotic word endings like animal or id, and so far I am not aware of any counterexample to this.\n\nThis always struck me to be an odd rule. Thus, I am curious:\n\n  \u2022 Do we have any idea why this is the case?\n  \u2022 And related: How strong is this rule? Are there any known exceptions?\n\nRelated question on Linguistics SE: Why do neuter nominative and accusative always agree in IE languages?\n\n\nI believe there are no exceptions to this rule. That's what I have always read, and I have never encountered any, neither in Greek nor in Latin, nor even in German.\n\nThere is an hypothesis about the cause of this phenomenon. Neuter words were historically limited to inanimate objects or things that cannot act. In a basic sentence, it was rarely or never the neuter thing that acted, and therefore you didn't need case to distinguish between agent and patient\/theme (between \"acting\" and \"being acted upon\"). So, if you just have a transitive verb and a neuter word, there is only one possibility: the neuter thing is acted upon. With an intransitive verb, there is no object, so it is even less necessary. So semantics make case redundant for neuter words.\n\nThis hypothesis is inspired by our knowledge of ergative\u2013absolutive languages, in which the 'subject' of an 'intransitive' verb and the 'object' of a 'transitive' verb take the same case (the absolutive case), as opposed to the 'subject' of a 'transitive' verb (ergative case, from ergon \"work, deed, action\", related to work). In other words, the primary complement of a verb is the thing that does not act; and only some verbs have a secondary complement, which is a thing that acts.\n\n(This contrasts with nominative\u2013accusative languages, such as the main European languages, in which the subject of an intransitive verb takes the nominative, but the object of a transitive verb takes the accusative case. Our primary complement is the subject, which often acts; and only some verbs have a secondary complement, the direct object.)\n\nOf course this is an hypothesis, so take it with a grain of salt. But it's the only one I've ever heard.\n\n  \u2022 4\n    There is a singular exception to the rule that nom. and acc. neuter plurals in Latin end in -a. The relative pronoun qui, quae, quod has quae \u2014 but it is NOT an exception to the rule under discussion! \u2013\u00a0Tom Cotton Jan 15 '17 at 16:25\n  \u2022 4\n    @TomCotton: Ah, good point. And haec. It could be argued that those are contractions of qua and ha with deictic particles -e [i] and -c(ce), which would not be part of the ending. Cf. Greek -i after some forms of houtos. \u2013\u00a0Cerberus Jan 15 '17 at 17:43\n\nTo answer your second question, this rule is completely exceptionless, not only in Latin but in all Indo-European languages (that is, those that have a neuter gender at all).\n\nneuter gender always had identical nominative, accusative and vocative forms in all three numbers\n\nWiki link\n\nArchaic Syntax in Indo-European\n\n  \u2022 13\n    Sources for this statement (which I believe is correct) would be helpful. \u2013\u00a0brianpck Feb 23 '16 at 19:04\n  \u2022 1\n    @aper I rejected your edit because it was in conflict with what TKR wrote.

Hittite is an indo-european language for which the rule of neuters doesn't hold: the nominative of a neuter noun for a transitive verb is different from the accusative. The source given 'Archaic Syntax in Indo-European' by Brigitte Bauer refers to proto-indo-european, not to its derivatives, latin, russian, hittite, etc \u2013\u00a0aper Mar 13 '18 at 7:32\n\nFor the sake of completeness, it seems worth noting that there's one odd exception.\n\nThe gerund is a noun derived from a verb, representing an action (for example, vol\u0101ndum \"flying\"). For the most part it acts as a regular second-declension neuter.\n\nHowever, the gerund lacks a regular nominative, and instead uses the regular present active infinitive of the verb (vol\u0101re, \"to fly\").\n\nSo in this one particular case, vol\u0101re is nominative, and vol\u0101ndum accusative.\n\n  \u2022 4\n    To be more precise, I would add that also volare can be the accusative. It depends on whether a preposition is used. This answer relies on the combination of infinitive and gerund being treated as a single noun, which it kind of semantically is. From another perspective, one could argue it isn't. Either way, this is a very worthwhile remark. \u2013\u00a0Joonas Ilmavirta Jul 4 '18 at 3:28\n\nFeels a little cheap as an answer here, but the auto-generated Related Links suggests to me the excellent Was \u201cPascha\u201d ever used as a neuter first-declension noun? which provides a possible example of an exception here. Absolutely none of this answer is original research, I am merely reporting what I see in that question and its answers.\n\nNotably, the question notes the issue of neuter nominative\/accusative agreement, and quotes Richard Haynes as citing Pascha as possibly the only exception to this rule. The querent, on the other hand, seems to feel the existence of Pascham instead suggests that the word is actually feminine and not neuter in the first place.\n\nAs Pascha means \u201cPassover,\u201d it is of course Ecclesiastic Latin and not Classical Latin. The question there goes into a lot of detail about its history and etymology, and the word seems to simultaneously exist as a 1st-declension neuter word, a 1st-declension feminine word, and a 3rd-declension neuter word (Pascha, Paschatis).\n\nThe answers to that question provide a number of examples showing its use as a first-declension neuter word, in agreement with neuter adjectives (e.g. sancti Paschae in the genitive). It also includes examples of the Pascham accusative form being used\u2014but in agreement with feminine adjectives (e.g. totam Pascham). None of the examples show Pascham being in agreement with a neuter adjective in the accusative.\n\nFinally, at least one source (in the question) states that the accusative form of Pascha is, in fact, Pascha, despite otherwise describing first-declension inflection. This would, of course, be an excellent example in the reverse\u2014even in this exceptional case of a first-declension neuter noun, at least some authors still felt the need to maintain this rule over the need to maintain the usual declension of first-declension nouns, and so an otherwise-unused \u201cfirst-declension neuter\u201d inflection was invented.\n\nSince none of the examples there show Pascham being used as a clearly-neuter word, however, additional research on this topic would be appropriate. Unfortunately, I\u2019m completely unequipped to do so.\n\n\nThis rule applies to Russian, Germanic languages, Latin and ancient Greek as far as I know. So I suspect that it's a feature of the proto-IE language.\n\n  \u2022 Welcome to the site! This is indeed a reasonable thing to suspect. Do you happen to know of any sources that give more details on this? \u2013\u00a0Joonas Ilmavirta Oct 5 '19 at 4:40\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

This doesn't mean that the story needs to be over at that point but most of the times it more or less asks for a new chapter.\n\nMany times I could expand them as I often just basically \"explain\" a science fiction idea (e.g. by examination\/experience of an object\/phenomena) where it probably should rather be an exploration of the idea. But not always and often I'm not sure how. At the same time I aim to have the story be as non-vacuous as possible.\n\n  \u2022 This is a very broad \"question\", or rather a collection of questions that could all have very different answers. Have you searched for questions similar before posting this? I've seen a lot of questions similar to the ones you include here, which have gotten very good answers. You should check if you can find your answers in existing questions. Also, writing classes should still allow you to \"do your own style\".

(as explained further in the question) I found writers.stackexchange.com\/questions\/5894\/\u2026 which is similar and has some answers also useful here \u2013\u00a0mYnDstrEAm Mar 31 '17 at 11:46\n  \u2022 Im guessing this is similar in relative terms to the Black Mirror series on Netflix? \u2013\u00a0Kyle Li Apr 1 '17 at 13:52\n  \u2022 I would like more info on what you have. Are your short stories all with the same characters or just the same \"world\" or theme? When you say stitch them together, it sounds like you want to put them end-to-end to make something longer, but a novel isn't just a series of stories. There would be story and character arcs that should be longer, There is usually the main plot and subplots, etc. \u2013\u00a0Terri Simon Apr 7 '17 at 20:21\n\nA story must always be a story, which is to say that it must have a story arc. The arc of a story is fundamentally built around desire and the things people will or will not do to achieve their desire. Thus the crux of a story is always a choice the protagonist must make about the price they are willing to pay (or not willing to pay) to achieve their desire.\n\nDifferent genres are defined both by the types of choices they deal with and by the settings in which they are told. The \"science fiction idea\" at the heart of some science fiction stories (not all SF has an original idea by any means) functions as catalyst for the character's desire or the character's choice.\n\nIf your \"story\" is little more than the examination of the science fiction idea itself, it is not yet a story. And while length is not strictly germane to story, it is likely that it would take you much longer to tell the story of someone whose desires or choices are impacted by the SF idea than it would to describe the idea itself.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 This was much my thought when reading the question: Nowhere does it mention characters. It sounds like further character development is needed, to the point where the characters' choices are obvious to the writer. The story should flow naturally out of that. \u2013\u00a0Goodbye Stack Exchange Apr 1 '17 at 15:45\n  \u2022 @NeilFein Well I asked about character development etc earlier but it was removed from the question. \u2013\u00a0mYnDstrEAm Apr 21 '17 at 14:00\n\nDon't try to expand your story into something larger. If your story works at its shorter length then trying to blow it up into something longer will end up with superfluous action and characters. If you like the world depicted, try to find some other characters and events in that world that could play out over a longer timespan. If you like the characters, look at what happened before, after or around the events of the short story, or put them into something that will take longer to resolve.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Only one per section will be discussed.\n\nSection I\n\nEmily\u2019s funeral is attended by everyone in town.\u00a0 The women wanted to get inside her house to snoop and the men to pay their respects.\u00a0\n\nColonel Sartoris intended for Emily never to pay taxes.\u00a0 After his death, the new council began to hound Emily to pay her taxes.\u00a0 A taskforce is sent to her house to further emphasize that she owed money. The group is quickly dismissed by Emily.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSee Colonel Sartoris. I have no taxes in Jefferson.\u201d\n\nSection II\n\nIn this section, the neighbors complain to the mayor about a smell emanating from Emily\u2019s property. After more complaints, a covert group of men sneak to her house at night and sniff out the smell\u2019s location and place lime everywhere possible.\n\nAlthough the town pitied Emily, they thought that the Grierson family was arrogant.\u00a0 According to Emily\u2019s father, none of the young men in town were good enough for her; consequently, he doomed Emily to a spinster\u2019s life. The town was not pleased that Emily was alone but felt justified.\n\nWhen her father died, the house was all that was left to her; and people were glad. At last they could pity Miss Emily.\n\nSection III\n\nWhen Homer Barron came to town, Emily and he begin a courtship; yet, Homer had specified that he liked men.\u00a0 Rumors run rampant when the pair was seen riding around in a carriage every Sunday.\u00a0\n\nThe town comments on the events of the courtship:\n\n  \u2022 Glad that she had an interest\n  \u2022 Never marry a northerner\n  \u2022 Losing her reputation\n  \u2022 Need family to intercede\n  \u2022 Poor Emily\n  \u2022 Whispering about what the pair was doing in the carriage\n  \u2022 Fallen woman\n\nEmily buys poison from the druggist.\n\nSection IV\n\nThe town thought that Emily would use the poison to kill herself. It is suggested that she would marry Homer. Some women felt that Emily was setting a bad example for the young girls.\u00a0 The women took action and sent for her cousins to watch over her.\n\nThe narrator comments that the town waited for what was going to happen next.\n\nEmily ordered a lot of things with H.

        "text":"The Good Earth: Essay Q&A\n\nAverage Overall Rating: 5\nTotal Votes: 126\n\nEssay Q&A\n\n1. Does foot-binding play an important role in the novel? What was the reason for this practice in Chinese society?\nFoot-binding plays a role in the novel since it shows how the practice was associated with wealth and social class. In general, the poorer classes in Chinese society did not practice foot-binding, so in the novel, O-lan does not have her feet bound. As a slave, she needed to be able to do whatever work was required of her, rather than being almost crippled with deformed feet, which was the result of the practice of foot-binding. The wealthy classes, in contrast, could afford to have non-productive female family members.\nWhen Wang Lung becomes prosperous he complains to his wife about her big feet, which are a tell-tale sign of her humble origins. He now thinks he deserves better. As a result, O-lan promises she will bind the feet of their second daughter, which will make her more attractive and more marriageable.\nFor some reason that no one has been able to explain satisfactorily, the tiny, three-inch-long feet that resulted from the extremely painful practice of foot-binding were considered not only attractive but erotic. Men even thought that a tiny foot meant that the woman had enhanced sexual energy. When in the novel Wang Lung meets the prostitute Lotus, one of the things he likes most about her is her tiny feet.\nThe author does not condemn outright the practice of foot-binding, but she does show how it is associated with finding a marriage partner. For a girl from a certain social class in China, not having bound feet would make it very difficult for her to find a suitable husband.\nThe practice also shows the unequal power relations between men and women. Women were culturally conditioned to believe that they had to undergo the pain of foot-binding in order to be pleasing to men. And for men, having a wife with bound feet was a way of ensuring subservience and fidelity, since she could not move around easily and was confined to the house.\n2. What role does religion play in the novel, and what attitude does Wang Lung have to it?\nThe village where Wang Lung lives seems to have a religion that worships the kind of agricultural deities that are found in many ancient and traditional societies. Such deities are worshiped as a way of honoring the capacity of the earth to be fruitful.\nWang Lung's attitude to the gods changes during the course of the novel. When he first brings his bride home, he goes straight to the small temple in the village. It is called the temple to the earth and was built by Wang Lung's grandfather. Inside, there are two earthen figures, depicting the unnamed \"gods of the earth,\" the male god and his female consort. The gods wear robes of red and gilt paper, which are renewed by the villagers as part of each New Year celebration. All the people in the neighborhood worship these gods, and Wang Lung appears to be no exception. He takes incense to the temple and burns it before the gods in gratitude. After the birth of his first child, he again burns incense in the temple, and feels protected by the power of the gods.\nBut during and after the famine his attitude undergoes a drastic change. This time he goes to the temple only to spit on the statues of the gods and accuse God himself of desiring misfortune for men: \"Oh, you are too wicked, you Old Man in Heaven!\" he says (p. 66). When he returns from the city, after the drought and famine are over, he finds the statues in the temple looking bedraggled. No one has paid them any attention during the famine. \"Thus it is with gods who do evil to men!\" he says (p. 124).\nThis hostility to the gods, or to the supreme God, becomes stronger in Wang Lung as he gets older. He repeats these sentiments to Ching, when Ching informs him of the approaching flood (Chapter 28). Wang Lung appears to believe that the \"old man in heaven\" enjoys the sight of human suffering.\nBut it also appears that he cannot completely shake off his religious beliefs or his observance of religious customs. When his grandson is about to be born, he ensures that incense is offered to the gods in the temple in the town, which is a more elaborate temple dedicated to the \"goddess of mercy\" in a \"gilded alcove\" (p. 257). Then he goes to the country temple and does the same thing-just as he did when he was first married, and when he was expecting his first child. So it seems that Wang Lung, despite his anger at the gods, remains to a certain extent within the framework of beliefs and customs that are normative for his society.\n3. Why does O-lan kill her infant daughter? Is it an act of mercy or a crime?\nThe incident in which O-lan appears to kill her daughter, probably by strangulation, comes in chapter 9. The context is the famine the village is enduring, which is reaching its worst point. There is no food for anyone, and there are rumors that in the village, people are even eating human flesh in order to survive.\nThe narrative does not state explicitly that O-lan killed the baby, but it is strongly implied. Wang Lung heard the baby cry, so it was born alive. But when he enters O-lan's room, he finds the baby dead on the floor, and he notices \"two dark, bruised spots\" on its neck (p. 71).\nThere is no doubt that O-lan regards her deed as an act of mercy. Throughout the novel she is presented as a good mother; she would not have destroyed her own offspring had she not believed it was for the best. Was she correct in her belief? Whether this was an act of mercy or a crime depends on one's own beliefs about when it is permissible to take life and when it is not. But it would perhaps be a hard heart that condemned a starving woman who ended the life of a tiny malnourished infant (\"a wisp of bone and skin\") perhaps a few more hours or days than it would otherwise have endured. This is certainly the conclusion that Wang Lung reaches. After he has buried the dead baby, he mutters to himself, \"it is better as it is\" (p.72).\nHowever, there is another side to the question. It may be significant that the baby was a girl. In the society depicted in the novel, a baby girl was not considered cause for great rejoicing, even in good times. When O-lan gives birth to her first daughter, she refers to it as a slave, \"not worth mentioning\" (p. 56). Would O-lan have been so quick to snuff out the life of her child, even in the midst of a terrible famine, if the child had been a boy? It seems unlikely. It was easier for her to kill the infant girl, given the lower value that the society in which she lived placed on women's lives. Had the baby been a boy, she might have felt a stronger need to try to preserve his life, hoping against hope that he would survive.\n4. Describe the relationship between Wang Lung and his uncle. Why does Wang Lung allow himself to be exploited by the uncle?\nWang Lung is contrasted at every point with his uncle. Whereas Wang Lung is industrious and thrives as a result, his uncle is lazy. He does not cultivate his land, preferring to spend his time gambling or living off the generosity of others, including Wang Lung. He blames his troubles on bad luck. When he sees how prosperous Wang Lung has become, he simply moves himself and his family into Wang Lung's house and expects to be taken care of.\nWang Lung allows this situation to go on for two reasons. First, he is a decent man who is very aware of how things should be done in his culture. Respect of elders is ingrained into his mind. Once, early in the novel, he forgets himself and expresses anger at his uncle for asking for money. The uncle is quick to exploit the situation, playing on what he knows is Wang Lung's respect for tradition: \"Have you no religion, no morals, that you are so lacking in filial conduct? Have you not heard it said that in the Sacred Edicts it is commanded that a man is never to correct an elder?\" (p. 55). The uncle cunningly exploits Wang Lung in this way throughout the novel, knowing that his cousin will be extremely reluctant to rebuke an elder, who also happens to be a family member.\nThe second reason Wang Lung allows the abuse to go on is because the uncle reveals that he is a member, and perhaps even in charge, of the dreaded criminal gang known as the Redbeards. Wang Lung fears that if he crosses his uncle, the uncle will arrange for the gang to attack and rob his house. His uncle encourages him in this belief.\nSome critics have pointed out how unlikely it is that a lazy, ineffectual good-for-nothing like Wang Lung's uncle would also be a ruthless gangster, with other cut-throats and robbers at his beck and call. The two roles do not seem to fit together. It is possible that the author introduced the notion of the uncle as gang leader to reinforce the reasons Wang Lung has for not throwing him out, and also to explain why the notorious robber gang never touches Wang Lung's house.\n5. In chapter 14, what picture is presented of Christian missionaries?\nPearl Buck was the daughter of Christian missionaries to China, but the picture she presents of such missionaries in this one short passage in The Good Earth is hardly a flattering one. It shows Christianity from Wang Lung's point of view, who knows nothing at all about it. He encounters the missionary while he is in the big southern city of Kiangsu. The missionary, as Wang Lung sees him, is not an attractive figure. He is a tall and lean foreigner, bearded, with eyes \"as blue as ice\" (suggesting coldness) and a big nose. Wang Lung is frightened of the man's \"strange eyes and fearful nose.\" The missionary hands Wang Lung a piece of paper, on which is pictured the crucified Christ. Wang Lung sees only a white-skinned man, apparently dead, hanging nearly naked \"upon a crosspiece of wood.\" Blood streams from his side.\nWang Lung is horrified at the picture. He shows it to one of his neighbors, who offers the opinion that the man must have done great evil to have been ... (truncated)",

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nI was wondering if there were any difference between these two verbs, especially in their usual respective contexts.\n\nBonus point for pointing out differences between Argentina and Spain as well (if any!).\n\nshare|improve this question\ndo you mean that one word is rather used in Spain and the other in Argentina ? \u2013\u00a0 Stephane Rolland Aug 23 '12 at 5:42\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 7 down vote accepted\n\nIn the same context, both words mean almost the same. The relevant definitions from the RAE are:\n\nExtra\u00f1ar: 4. tr. Echar de menos a alguien o algo, sentir su falta.\n\nA\u00f1orar 1. tr. Recordar con pena la ausencia, privaci\u00f3n o p\u00e9rdida de alguien o algo muy querido.\n\n'Extra\u00f1ar' is more generic, it just means that you miss something or someone. For example, if I move to UK, I will find driving in the left side of the road a bit weird because I'm used to drive in the right side, so \"yo extra\u00f1ar\u00e9 conducir por la derecha\". Usually 'extra\u00f1ar' means just a change in your habits, and the new situation will not bother you for too long.\n\n'A\u00f1orar' is more about feelings. If I move overseas, I will miss my family, because I love them. It is not a temporary situation, something I will get used to; I will miss them forever.\n\nFor completness: 'echar de menos' is an idiom that holds both nuances, and in my opionion, it's more used than 'extra\u00f1ar' or 'a\u00f1orar'.\n\nNote: This answer is about Spain. I don't know if they use the words in the same way in Argentina.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nNice answer! In Argentina a\u00f1orar is not used colloquially. And extra\u00f1ar is more usual than echar de menos, although both are common. For a nice usage of a\u00f1orar see youtube.com\/watch?v=IQFcpuYi8L4. Alfredo Le Pera was a very good poet. \"Sue\u00f1o con el pasado que a\u00f1oro, el tiempo viejo que lloro y que nunca volver\u00e1.\" \u2013\u00a0 belisarius Aug 23 '12 at 12:02\nthanks, I understood. \u2013\u00a0 Sebas Aug 24 '12 at 0:55\nA\u00f1orar is more formal and not used colloquially. \u2013\u00a0 DeStrangis Jan 25 '13 at 14:16\n\na\u00f1orar - To yearn for, to long for\n\nextra\u00f1ar - To miss\n\nshare|improve this answer\nWelcome to Spanish.SE! I'm wondering if you might be able to expand on this answer a little, to be more than just simple definitions. \u2013\u00a0 Flimzy Aug 23 '12 at 6:24\nNow I have to open a question in the english.stackexchange forum to ask the differences between yearn for and to miss... :D \u2013\u00a0 Sebas Aug 24 '12 at 0:55\n\nEste es el lugar ideal para que me corrijan. Yo si veo una diferencia significativa.\n\nExtra\u00f1ar siempre se refiere a algo que ya tuvistes. Sin embargo se puede a\u00f1orar un sueno, un objetivo, ...es un deseo \"intimo\".\n\nSer\u00e1 incorrecto?\n\nI see a major difference: Extra\u00f1ar allways bind with something you have had. But a\u00f1orar could also refer to something you just want to achieve. One can \"miss\" a dream, a goal, a desire.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nI am writing a story in the 3rd person and i would like to switch the narrator for one of the main characters half way through so that the reader can read how he perceives the story. does anybody have any suggestions on how this can be done without confusing the reader (about who the narrator is)?\n\nshare|improve this question\nStephen King did it in Christine. See what he did and learn from that. \u2013\u00a0 Lauren Ipsum Jun 6 '11 at 11:16\nTo see this done well, I suggest reading Tom Robbins' Another Roadside Attraction, which starts with an omniscient narrator who at a point in the book actually becomes the first-person narrator, actually made flesh as a character in the book. It is a kind of god-the-father\/god-the-son parallel, and very funny in context. A great use of voice and POV shift. \u2013\u00a0 Robusto Jun 6 '11 at 14:18\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nSome options to consider:\n\n  \u2022 As Shan suggests, try linking the previous chapter\/segment that's written in the third person to the one that's in the first person.\n  \u2022 If switching to the first person is something you want to do regularly, establish a switch in viewpoint early on, so that the reader knows that you plan on doing this switch on occasion. By establishing this convention early, it makes it much easier for the reader to follow the story, especially if the first person narration is always from one particular character.\n  \u2022 If you are only going to switch narration to first person this once (and then switch back to third person), then I would say you should question whether or not it's actually necessary to use this switch. Changes in narration should have fairly strong justifications for doing so, so you should ask what you achieve from the switch, and whether or not you could achieve the same from the style you've been using. If you're doing third-person semi-omniscient narration, then there is no reason why you cannot show how that character perceives the story by sticking with that narration style, rather than switching to first person.\n\n\n  \u2022 Another option you could try is to use some trait\/feature of the character to immediately indicate who is speaking in the first person. For example, maybe you showed that the character has a wooden leg, and so you could open the first-person narration with the character saying something like, \"My wooden leg was chafing horribly.\" Or maybe he suffers from hay-fever, so you could have him moaning about that ... use anything that is unique to that particular character that the reader should already know.\nshare|improve this answer\n\nI'm not quite sure why you think a switch is necessary. Or exactly what kind of switch you're proposing. The title of your question mentions switching from 3rd to 1st, but then the text of your question is more about POV characters, and you can have different POV characters without switching from third to first.\n\nGiven that you're mentioning a narrator as if there's an independent voice, I assume that most of the story is written in omniscient third? It's quite possible to 'zoom in' from omniscient to close third (see the Harry Potter stories for an example of someone doing this quite effectively), and you can zoom in to different characters at different times. If you want to make it clear that you're zooming in on someone new, I think the best way to do that is to zoom back out for a little omniscient narration, and then zoom in on your new target.\n\nA VERY rough example:\n\nJane carefully returned the goblet to the table. There was obviously more going on here than she was aware of, and she didn't want to take any chances until she had it all figured out. [close third POV, zoomed on Jane]\n\nShe wasn't the only one looking for more information, although her intentions were certainly more innocent than those of others. While Jane was handling antiques and old ladies, her nemesis was still dealing with Banshees and Necromancers. [omniscient third - and also, total drivel!]\n\n\"Get the corpses into the boxes, now!\" Dorfman was not a patient man, and one more iteration of the idea that the dead were in no hurry was going to be enough to make him start adding new corpses to the waiting pile. [close third POV, zoomed on Dorfman]\n\nThis example is a bit heavy-handed (the modern equivalent of 'meanwhile, back at the ranch'), but hopefully it gives you the idea, and as I said, you can find more subtle examples in Harry Potter and elsewhere.\n\nIs this what you're asking, though? It's a way to switch POV characters, but it doesn't switch to first person. I just don't think it's generally necessary to make that sort of change...\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nI assume you want to move from 3rd to 1st person. Is this correct?\n\nYou could have an incident in the 3rd person, like the hero goes to a bank to check his balance and later meet his girlfriend Suzy. Briefly have the hero making plans about this in the 3rd person:\n\n\"He was thinking of going to the bank, so he could withdraw some money to take his girlfriend out to that fancy 5 star hotel.\"\n\nThen you could switch to 1st person in the next chapter:\n\n\"I walked into the bank. It wasnt too busy, which was great, as it meant I could spend more time with Suzy later\"\n\nThis way the reader will know you are talking about the same character, you have just moved from 3rd to 1st person.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Were those names common at the time of Bunyan or was he the first to use them as a proper name?\n\nshare|improve this question\nHere is at least one instance which seems to predate Pilgrim's progress by ~3 centuries. Christian of Oliva. There also appear to be several Kings of Denmark with the name Christian. See: en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Christian_(name). \u2013\u00a0 Zoredache Jan 12 '12 at 19:03\nNot sure that would make sense since Christian isn't an English name. \u2013\u00a0 Zoredache Jan 12 '12 at 19:50\n@Zor you mean it's not an English name since you think it was imported from Denmark almost a millennium before Bunyan? What give a name its national character anyway? \u2013\u00a0 Peter Turner Jan 13 '12 at 14:14\nWell, Christian Fletcher was English, and born in 1764. \u2013\u00a0 kiamlaluno Jan 13 '12 at 16:38\nUhm, no the name isn't natively Danish either. As that wikipedia article I linked to it is based on the Latin word Christianus (Christ follower). Given that the Roman Catholic was both widespread and performed a large portion of their services in Latin, it is unsurprising that the word was used, just like the names of many other biblical characters. \u2013\u00a0 Zoredache Jan 14 '12 at 3:29\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nup vote 5 down vote accepted\n\nBehind The Name says it was in use in the Middle Ages, but didn't become popular until the 17th century, so the rise in popularity could conceivably be tied to Pilgrim's Progress.\n\nThere were also 10 Danish kings with the name Christian, the first born in 1426. So definitely the use of the name predates Bunyan.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
