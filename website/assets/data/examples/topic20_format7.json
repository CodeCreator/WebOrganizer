You Don't have to be alone!\n\nAccount (in computer networking)\n\nA set of credentials for participating in a network. In a typical network, each user needs an account to access resources on the network, such as shared folders, printers, or applications. Accounts provide a way of identifying users on a network and are the foundation for network security. An administrator or another user with high security privileges typically creates accounts.\n\nAccounts are generally used in server-based networks where a central computer such as a Microsoft Windows NT domain controller keeps track of each user\u2019s account and grants or denies access to the network based on the credentials entered by the user at logon.\n\nAccounts are used less frequently in peer-to-peer networks or workgroups because the security requirements are usually much less stringent.\n\nA Windows NT or Windows 2000 network contains three kinds of accounts:\n\n  \u2022 User account:\n    Identifies users who belong to the domain by storing their names, passwords, the groups they belong to, and the permissions they have for accessing system resources\n\n\n  \u2022 Group account:\n    Identifies a specific group of users and is used to assign permissions to them\n\n\n  \u2022 Computer account:\n    Identifies machines that belong to the domain\n\nUser Account\n\nEach user account on a multi-user system typically has a home directory, in which to store files pertaining exclusively to that user's activities, which is protected from access by other users (though a system administrator may have access).\n\nUser accounts often contain a public user profile, which contains basic information provided by the account's owner. The files stored in the home directory (and all other directories in the system) have file system permissions which are inspected by the operating system to determine which users are granted access to read or execute a file, or to store a new file in that directory.\n\nWhile systems expect most user accounts to be used by only a single person, many systems have a special account intended to allow anyone to use the system, such as the username \u00abanonymous\u00bb for anonymous FTP and the username \u00abguest\u00bb for a guest account.\n\nUsername format\n\nIn Windows environments the username format is User Principal Name (UPN) format example:\nDown-Level Logon Name format example: DOMAIN\\accountName",

        "text":"Open main menu\n\nWikipedia \u03b2\n\nHost-based intrusion detection system\n\nA host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is an intrusion detection system that is capable of monitoring and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces, similar to the way a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) operates.[1] This was the first type of intrusion detection software to have been designed, with the original target system being the mainframe computer where outside interaction was infrequent.[2]\n\n\n\nA host-based IDS is capable of monitoring all or parts of the dynamic behavior and the state of a computer system, based on how it is configured. Besides such activities as dynamically inspecting network packets targeted at this specific host (optional component with most software solutions commercially available), a HIDS might detect which program accesses what resources and discover that, for example, a word-processor has suddenly and inexplicably started modifying the system password database. Similarly a HIDS might look at the state of a system, its stored information, whether in RAM, in the file system, log files or elsewhere; and check that the contents of these appear as expected, e.g. have not been changed by intruders.[3]\n\nOne can think of a HIDS as an agent that monitors whether anything or anyone, whether internal or external, has circumvented the system's security policy.\n\nMonitoring dynamic behaviorEdit\n\nMany computer users have encountered tools that monitor dynamic system behaviour in the form of anti-virus (AV) packages. While AV programs often also monitor system state, they do spend a lot of their time looking at who is doing what inside a computer \u2013 and whether a given program should or should not have access to particular system resources. The lines become blurred here, as many of the tools overlap in functionality.\n\nIntrusion prevention systems are a type of HIDS software that protects against buffer overflow attacks on system memory and can enforce security policy.[4]\n\nMonitoring stateEdit\n\nThe principle operation of a HIDS depends on the fact that successful intruders (hackers) will generally leave a trace of their activities. In fact, such intruders often want to own the computer they have attacked, and will establish their \"ownership\" by installing software that will grant the intruders future access to carry out whatever activity (keystroke logging, identity theft, spamming, botnet activity, spyware-usage etc.) they envisage.\n\nIn theory, a computer user has the ability to detect any such modifications, and the HIDS attempts to do just that and reports its findings.\n\nIdeally a HIDS works in conjunction with a NIDS, such that a HIDS finds anything that slips past the NIDS. Commercially available software solutions often do correlate the findings from NIDS and HIDS in order to find out about whether a network intruder has been successful or not at the targeted host.\n\nMost successful intruders, on entering a target machine, immediately apply best-practice security techniques to secure the system which they have infiltrated, leaving only their own backdoor open, so that other intruders can not take over their computers.\n\n\nIn general a HIDS uses a database (object-database) of system objects it should monitor \u2013 usually (but not necessarily) file system objects. A HIDS could also check that appropriate regions of memory have not been modified \u2013 for example, the system call table for Linux, and various vtable structures in Microsoft Windows.\n\nDuring the communication establishment phase and while transferring the data requested by the client, the host's server and the client exchanges a passphrase to verify their identity. The server uses the same passphrase all the time for this purpose. Based upon that an object is created.\n\nFor each object in question a HIDS will usually remember its attributes (permissions, size, modifications dates) and create a checksum of some kind (an MD5, SHA1 hash or similar) for the contents, if any. This information gets stored in a secure database for later comparison (checksum database).\n\nAn alternate method to HIDS would be to provide NIDS type functionality at the network interface (NIC) level of an end-point (either server, workstation or other end device). Providing HIDS at the network layer has the advantage of providing more detailed logging of the source (IP address) of the attack and attack details, such as packet data, neither of which a dynamic behavioral monitoring approach could see.\n\n\nAt installation time \u2013 and whenever any of the monitored objects change legitimately \u2013 a HIDS must initialize its checksum-database by scanning the relevant objects. Persons in charge of computer security need to control this process tightly in order to prevent intruders making un-authorized changes to the database(s). Such initialization thus generally takes a long time and involves cryptographically locking each monitored object and the checksum databases or worse. Because of this, manufacturers of HIDS usually construct the object-database in such a way that makes frequent updates to the checksum database unnecessary.\n\nComputer systems generally have many dynamic (frequently changing) objects which intruders want to modify \u2013 and which a HIDS thus should monitor \u2013 but their dynamic nature makes them unsuitable for the checksum technique. To overcome this problem, HIDS employ various other detection techniques: monitoring changing file-attributes, log-files that decreased in size since last checked, and numerous other means to detect unusual events.\n\nOnce a system administrator has constructed a suitable object-database \u2013 ideally with help and advice from the HIDS installation tools \u2013 and initialized the checksum-database, the HIDS has all it requires to scan the monitored objects regularly and to report on anything that may appear to have gone wrong. Reports can take the form of logs, e-mails or similar.\n\nProtecting the HIDSEdit\n\nA HIDS will usually go to great lengths to prevent the object-database, checksum-database and its reports from any form of tampering. After all, if intruders succeed in modifying any of the objects the HIDS monitors, nothing can stop such intruders from modifying the HIDS itself \u2013 unless security administrators take appropriate precautions. Many worms and viruses will try to disable anti-virus tools, for example.\n\nApart from crypto-techniques, HIDS might allow administrators to store the databases on a CD-ROM or on other read-only memory devices (another factor militating for infrequent updates...) or storing them in some off-system memory. Similarly, a HIDS will often send its logs off-system immediately \u2013 typically using VPN channels to some central management system.\n\nOne could argue that the trusted platform module comprises a type of HIDS. Although its scope differs in many ways from that of a HIDS, fundamentally it provides a means to identify whether anything\/anyone has tampered with a portion of a computer. Architecturally this provides the ultimate (at least at this point in time) host-based intrusion detection, as depends on hardware external to the CPU itself, thus making it that much harder for an intruder to corrupt its object and checksum databases.\n\n\nInfoworld states that host-based intrusion-detection system software is a useful way for network managers to find malware, and suggest they run it on every server, not just critical servers.[5]\n\nSee alsoEdit\n\n\n  1. ^ Newman, Robert C.

        "text":"Email spoofing\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\u00a0\u00a0(Redirected from E-mail spoofing)\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nEmail spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address - something which is simple to do because the core protocols do no authentication. Spam and phishing emails typically use such spoofing to mislead the recipient about the origin of the message.[1]\n\nA number of measures to address spoofing are available including: SPF, Sender ID, DKIM, and DMARC. Although their use is increasing, it is likely that almost half of all domains still do not have such measures in place.[2][3] However, as of 2013, 60% of consumer mailboxes worldwide use DMARC to protect themselves against direct domain spoofing[4] and only 8.6% of emails have no form of domain authentication.[5]\n\nTechnical detail[edit]\n\nWhen an SMTP email is sent, the initial connection provides two pieces of address information:\n\n  \u2022 MAIL FROM: - generally presented to the recipient as the Return-path: header but not normally visible to the end user,[6] and by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address.\n  \u2022 RCPT TO: - specifies which email address the email is delivered to, is not normally visible to the end user but may be present in the headers as part of the \"Received:\" header.\n\nTogether these are sometimes referred to as the \"envelope\" addressing, by analogy with a traditional paper envelope.[7]\n\nOnce the receiving mail server signals that it accepted these two items, the sending system sends the \"DATA\" command, and typically sends several header items, including:\n\n  \u2022 From: Joe Q Doe <> - the address visible to the recipient; but again, by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address.\n  \u2022 Reply-to: Jane Roe <> - similarly not checked\n\nThe result is that the email recipient sees the email as having come from the address in the From: header; they may sometimes be able to find the MAIL FROM address; and if they reply to the email it will go to either the address presented in the MAIL FROM: or Reply-to: header - but none of these addresses are typically reliable,[8] so automated bounce messages may generate backscatter.\n\nUse by spam and worms[edit]\n\nMalware such as Klez and Sober and many more modern examples often search for email addresses within the computer they have infected, and use those addresses both as targets for email, but also to create credible forged From fields in the emails that they send, so that these emails are more likely to be opened. For example:\n\nAlice is sent an infected email which she opens, running the worm code.\nThe worm code searches Alice's address book and finds the addresses of Bob and Charlie.\nFrom Alice's computer, the worm sends an infected email to Bob, but forged to appear to have been sent by Charlie.\n\nIn this case, even if Bob's system detects the incoming mail as containing malware, he sees the source as being Charlie - while Alice remains unaware of the actual infection.\n\nFooling media[edit]\n\nIt has happened that the media printed false stories based on spoofed e-mails.\n\n  \u2022 In October 2013, an e-mail which looked like it was from the Swedish company Fingerprint Cards was sent to a news agency, saying that Samsung offered to purchase the company. The news spread and the stock exchange rate surged by 50%. But the e-mail was from someone else.[9]\n  \u2022 It has also happened that people and companies have been scandalized by spoofed e-mail to newspapers.\n\nHistorical legitimate use[edit]\n\nIn the early Internet, \"legitimately spoofed\" email was common. For example, a visiting user might use the local organization's SMTP server to send email from the user's foreign address. Since most servers were configured as \"open relays\", this was a common practice. As spam email became an annoying problem, these sorts of \"legitimate\" uses fell out of favor.\n\nThe effect on mailservers[edit]\n\nTraditionally, mail servers could accept a mail item, then later send a Non-Delivery Report or \"bounce\" message if it couldn't be delivered or had been quarantined for any reason. These would be sent to the \"MAIL FROM:\" aka \"Return Path\" address. With the massive rise in forged addresses, Best Practice is now to not generate NDRs for detected spam, viruses etc. [10] but to reject the email during the SMTP transaction. When mail administrators fail to take this approach, their systems are guilty of sending \"backscatter\" emails to innocent parties - in itself a form of spam - or being used to perform \"Joe job\" attacks.\n\nMail administrators may be able to enable SSL\/TLS in their mail transfer software. Using certificates in this manner increases the amount of authentication performed when sending mail.[11]\n\nIdentifying the source of the email[edit]\n\nAlthough email spoofing is often effective in forging the sender's real email address, the IP address source computer sending the mail can generally be identified from the \"Received:\" lines in the email header.[12] In many cases this is likely to be an innocent third party infected by malware that is sending the email without the owner's knowledge.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nExternal links and references[edit]",

        "text":"Difference Between Similar Terms and Objects\n\nDifference Between SFTP and SCP\n\ncomputerSFTP vs. SCP\n\nSSH File Transfer Protocol (also simply known as Secure File Transfer Protocol or SFTP) is a network protocol. It provides file access, file transfer, and file management functions over a trusted data stream. It was specifically designed as an extension of the Secure Shell Protocol (or SSH), version 2.0. As an extension, it is primarily used to provide secure file transfer capability; however, it is also intended to be usable with other protocols. The Internet Engineering Task Force (or IETF) has defined \u2013through the Internet Draft\u2013 that SFTP is described within the context of the SSH-2 protocol; however, SFTP is general and independent of the rest of the SSH-2 protocol suite. It has the ability to be used in a variety of applications, including a secure file transfer over Transport Layer Security (or TLS) and the transfer of management information in VPN applications. It assumes that it will be run over a secure channel (like SSH) that has a previously authenticated client \u2013the identity of whom is available to the protocol.\n\nSecure Channel Protocol (or SCP) is a network protocol. It provides a means of transferring data that can withstand or is completely impermeable to interception and tampering. Though it is meant to be a way to keep information transfer completely safe, there is no completely secure channel in the real world, just ways in which insecure networks can become less insecure and transfer information more safely \u2013that is, someone may be able to see or hear the message but has no means of altering the information that is exchanged over the server.\n\nSFTP protocol allows for a plethora of operations on remote files. It has more in common with the remote file system protocol than its predecessor, the SCP protocol. As a part of the extended features of the SFTP protocol, a client is able to resume interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. As a result, it is relatively easy to implement GUI SFTP client in comparison to a GUI SCP client. SFTP attempts to be a more platform independent protocol than its predecessor \u2013SFTP avoids having wildcard expansion specified by the client be up to the server. Also, SFTP servers are available on most all platforms. It is a completely new protocol not related to the SSH \u2013which is run over FTP. SFTP does not provide authentication or security; rather it expects the underlying protocol to secure both. As it is, SFTP is used mostly as a subsystem of SSH protocol, version 2 implementations (as it was designed in the same work group). It is possible, however, to run SFTP over SSH-1 or other data streams.\n\n\n1. SFTP is a network protocol that provides file access, transfer, and management functions over a trusted data stream; SCP is a network protocol providing data transfer that is impermeable to interception and tampering.\n\nSearch DifferenceBetween.net :\n\nCustom Search\n\nHelp us improve.

        "text":"The center for all Wikitravel images!\n\nWikitravel Shared:Mapmaking Expedition\n\nFrom Wikitravel Shared\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe Mapmaking Expedition is a Wikitravel Expedition to organize and standardize the maps used in Wikitravel.\n\n\nThe old dull saw says that a picture is worth a thousand words, but when a traveller is trying to find their way around a new city, it's more like a million. A clear and simple map can save hours or even days of hassle.\n\nAs with other parts of Wikitravel, we think that having a coherent map policy will make each map in Wikitravel more useful. Once a traveller has understood the symbols and conventions of one Wikitravel map, they can quickly understand a new one.\n\n\nThe Mapmaking Expedition has the following goals:\n\n  \u2022 To define preferred map file formats\n  \u2022 To outline a map-making collaboration procedure\n  \u2022 To enumerate different types of maps\n  \u2022 To suggest guidelines for including maps in articles\n  \u2022 To create a common map image layout and symbol vocabulary\n  \u2022 To provide map templates for quickly making new maps\n  \u2022 To collect mapmaking resources, that is, software tools and information sources\n\nFile formats[edit]\n\nThere are two major categories of image file formats: bitmap formats and vector formats. A bitmap format treats an image as a width-by-height array of pixels, each of which has a color. A vector format keeps information about individual parts of the image -- lines, shapes, text, etc. Vector formats tend to be best for computer-generated images -- like Wikitravel maps. They're also much easier to use for collaborative development -- it's much easier to move a line, a symbol, or some text around in a vector format than in a bitmap format.\n\nThere are any number of good vector graphics file formats, and some that are pretty standard for cartography. No vector graphics format, however, is widely supported for Web use. For this reason, we need to maintain two versions of map images: a source version in vector file format, and an output version in a Web-standard bitmap format.\n\nThere is one file format that's making serious inroads for Web usage: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Because SVG provides an upward compatibility path to allow us to remove the source-output dichotomy, we prefer SVG as the source format for map files. In case SVG is not available, encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files are a secondary source format.\n\nFor on-screen and printed output of maps, the lossless compression of PNG files is preferable. PNG map files are sharp and don't have compression artifacts like JPEG files do.\n\nIn short: SVG for source, PNG for output. (Yes, it's a long-winded explanation just to come up with 6 letters.)\n\nMapmaking procedure[edit]\n\nA Wikitravel mapmaker can and should create maps with whatever drawing tools they have available. When uploading a map, however, two files should be uploaded: the source version in SVG format, and the output version in PNG format. If the mapmaker's drawing tool doesn't support SVG as an output format, they should upload whatever source vector file format they can -- preferably Encapsulated PostScript, or (if necessary) Adobe Illustrator. Other Wikitravellers with better tools can download the source file, convert it to SVG, and upload that.\n\nThe Image page for the output file should have a link to the source file.\n\nWikitravellers editing an existing map really, really should work with the source SVG file if possible. After editing the file, they should produce an output PNG file, and upload both files to Wikitravel.\n\nSee also: Wikitravel:How to draw a map\n\nTypes of maps[edit]\n\nThere are several different types of maps that are useful to travellers. Among these are:\n\n  \u2022 City street maps. These are simplified maps of the main streets, landmarks, and other important parts of a city, as well as restaurants, bars, and other places listed in the Wikitravel article for a city.\n  \u2022 District street maps and District maps. For large cities, it might be useful to split up city street maps into district street maps, and then use a city area map to show how major parts of the city relate to each other.\n  \u2022 Country or regional railway\/road maps. This kind of map gives an overview of passenger railways, other public transport, and\/or major roads and thoroughfares between cities or large travel sites.\n  \u2022 Site maps. These are maps of individual tourist destinations, like archeological or historical places (temple complexes, castles) or large museums.\n  \u2022 Region maps. These are maps of a country that show the Wikitravel-defined regions of the country. There could also be region maps showing regions within a region. And so on.\n\nOther kinds of maps may be useful for Wikitravel; we'll try and list them here as we think of them.\n\nIncluding maps in articles[edit]\n\nSome maps -- such as small city street maps and site maps -- are small enough to be included in a Wikitravel article. These should be added in to articles directly. Most maps, though, will be too big to be shown as an article; they should be linked to instead of included. See How to add an image for more info on including or linking images.\n\nMap layout[edit]\n\n\nMap symbols[edit]\n\nOne thing that will make our maps more uniform -- and therefore easier to create, update, and use -- is a library of common map symbols. We have a page with the common map symbols available.\n\nThe map symbols should all be SVG files. This makes it easier to incorporate them into maps.\n\nMap templates[edit]\n\n\n\nWhen created, Wikitravel maps will be released under a Creative Commons copyright licence. This will mean that any map put on to Wikitravel will be able to be used freely and possibly changed by a later contributor. This means that most maps will either need to be sourced from public domain sources or sources with a compatable copyright release.\n\nMost map producers and suppliers will take strong exception to their work being copied. Although maps are usually copyrighted, the facts and ideas that maps represent are not copyrightable. If you use an existing copyrighted map as a reference source to make your own maps, be sure that you only use it to extract location data. Your data should be compared to maps from other sources too, as some map makers draw their maps with imperfections, meaning that simply copying a map, even if just tracing it by hand, will also include those imperfections and be able to be shown to be a copyright violation.\n\nAt the scale most maps are drawn, even tiny lines represent broad brush strokes over the landscape. Commercial city street maps may overstate the size of roadways and most road maps will overstate a road size. If you are drawing a map it may be more appropriate to simplify and stylise the map rather than make it an exact reproduction of a landscape. This will also lessen the chance of being accused of a copyright violation. If more detail is needed, people can always purchase a detailed map.\n\nSee the Talk page for discussion on this issue.\n\nMap-making resources[edit]\n\nPublic domain map sources[edit]\n\n  \u2022 DEMIS World Map Server. Absolutely amazing online service for generating maps of any point on the globe in realtime. License: With this statement DEMIS BV grants you permission to freely copy the PNG images returned by our server and use them for your own purposes, including web pages. We would appreciate a reference to our server but such a reference is not required, nor do we take responsibility for the accuracy or quality of the maps.\n  \u2022 The United States Census Bureau makes their TigerLine map data of the United States available to the public domain. Note that this is raw database information that needs to be manipulated a bit to be of use.\n\nGraphics tools[edit]\n\nThis section lists some tools for making and editing maps in Wikitravel's preferred formats. There's a full list of graphics programs that support SVG on the SVG standard site.\n\n  \u2022 Sodipodi. An excellent SVG editor for GNOME. Downloads are also available for MS Windows 95\/98\/ME\/2000\/XP users.\n  \u2022 Inkscape. A fork from the Sodipodi project, powerful SVG-compliant SVG editor. Produces excellent output in .png, Postscript or EPS. This tool is available for Linux (and other Unix variants), Mac OS X, and Windows.\n  \u2022 h n . o r g triggers WikiTravel's spam detector.

        "text":"Commons:Category inclusion criteria\n\nFrom Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nCommons, like Wikipedia, shouldn't have an indiscriminate number of categories. Most of those listed at Wikipedia:Overcategorization apply here apart from SHAREDNAME since topic categories function in a similar way to Wikipedia articles. For this reason on a disambiguation page a category for the surname will be included such as Category:Lincoln includes Category:Lincoln (surname) where people with that surname can be found.\n\nMost of the time, if you think a topic category shouldn't exist this is because the topic isn't notable. If this is the case then you should probably first nominate the files in the category for deletion; then if the category is emptied as a result it can simply be deleted as empty.\n\nSince many \"set\" categories shouldn't directly contain any (or many) images directly it is generally not helpful, for example (per SMALLCAT), to have a category for \"X in Y\" when there are only a few Xs in Y. For example, there are only 2 cities in Devon and since any images should be added directly to those categories (unless possibly files discussing both as cities but that's unlikely and those could still probably simply be added to both individual categories instead) a Category:Cities in Devon wouldn't be helpful. That said, topic categories can and often do only currently contain a few images such as Category:Brosdale Island, currently (as of May 2020) containing only 2 images but anyone could upload dozens of images about the island and all could be added to the category and suddenly it would have hundreds of images. Similarly, a category for \"Churches in X\" is probably not a good idea of X only has 1 (or a few churches). Since churches usually are taken as notable, any images for them should be added to the topic categories for them. However a category for \"Buildings in X\" probably is a good idea since X probably has hundreds of buildings and some might not be considered notable enough to have separate categories here.\n\nGeneral criteria[edit]\n\nGenerally, a category is appropriate for Commons if any of the following hold:\n\n  \u2022 The category contains a reasonably large number of images or other pages (use 10 as a rule of thumb, but there is not yet a consensus on this matter).\n  \u2022 The category has a subcategory.\n  \u2022 The category has a Wikipedia article and\/or clearly meets Wikipedia's notability criteria.\n  \u2022 The category is part of a diffusion scheme, and at least one of its sibling categories meets any of the other criteria above.\n\nThese apply to topic categories, the Wikipedia guideline mainly focuses on set categories. Sometimes these might be excluded by reasons on the Wikipedia guideline such as arbitrary inclusion criteria even though they have a Wikipedia article, for example Category:North Britain was deleted at Commons:Categories for discussion\/2018\/06\/Category:North Britain even though w:North Britain still has an article because \"North Britain\" doesn't have a definite meaning and thus different parts of Britain could be added to it depending on the editor's view on what is northern. However as noted the category could be re created if we have media specifically discussing the idea of what \"North Britain\" is.\n\nUnlike Wikipedia, which attempts to determine prima facie notability based on coverage in external sources, the decision to subcategorize on Commons is often driven by the needs of Commons itself. For widely photographed locations such as national parks, it may make sense to have a category for each attraction even though they might not be notable enough for individual Wikipedia articles. If a parent category is a very widely photographed object, such as the Eiffel Tower, it may make sense to subcategorize by decade or even by year. But please do not do this for every subject, only those that need diffusion; use editorial discretion.\n\nAn example of a diffusion scheme is Category:Water reflections of clouds in the United States by state. Clearly, Category:Water reflections of clouds in New York (state) has enough images to warrant a category, so Category:Water reflections of clouds in Iowa is appropriate despite having only one image in it.\n\nSee also[edit]",

Originally developed by Syntrillium as Cool Edit, the program was distributed as crippleware for Windows computers. The full version was useful and flexible, particularly for its time. Syntrillium later released Cool Edit Pro, which added the capability to work with multiple tracks, as well as other features. Audio processing, however, was done in a destructive manner (at the time, most computers were not powerful enough in terms of processor performance and memory capacity to perform non-destructive operations in real time). Cool Edit Pro v2 added support for real-time non-destructive processing, and v2.1 added support for surround sound mixing and unlimited simultaneous tracks (up to the limit imposed by the actual computer hardware). Cool Edit also included plugins such as noise reduction and FFT equalization.\n\nAdobe purchased Cool Edit Pro from Syntrillium Software in May 2003 for $16.5 million[2] as well as a large loop library called \"Loopology\". Adobe then changed the name of Cool Edit Pro to \"Adobe Audition\".\n\n\nVersion 1\n\nAdobe Audition was released on 18 August 2003. It had bug fixes but no new features, and was essentially a more polished Cool Edit Pro 2.1 under a different name. Adobe then released Audition v1.5 in May 2004; major improvements over v1 included pitch correction, frequency space editing, a CD project view, basic video editing and integration with Adobe Premiere, as well as several other enhancements.\n\nVersion 2\n\nAdobe Audition 2 was released on 17 January 2006. With this release, Audition (which the music recording industry had once seen as a value-oriented home studio application, although it has long been used for editing by radio stations) entered the professional Digital Audio Workstation market. The current version included two sections. Multitrack View supported up to 128 digital audio mono or stereo tracks at up to 32-bit resolution. In the Track Controls section one could select the input and output for each track (the program supported multiple multi-channel sound cards), select Record, Solo and Mute, and access the effects rack. New features included ASIO (Audio stream input output) support, VST (Virtual Studio Technology) support, new mastering tools (many provided by iZotope), and a redesigned UI. Adobe also included Audition 2.0 as part of its Adobe Production Studio bundle.\n\nVersion 3\n\nAdobe Audition 3 was released on 8 November 2007. New features included VSTi (virtual instrument) support, enhanced spectral editing, a redesigned multi-track interface, new effects, and a collection of royalty-free loops.\n\nCS2 activation servers' shutdown: Adobe Audition 3, with some other CS2 products, was released with an official serial number, due to the technical glitch in Adobe's CS2 activation servers (see Creative Suite 1 & 2)\n\nVersion 4 (CS5.5)\n\nAudition 4, also known as Audition CS5.5, was released on April 11, 2011 as part of Adobe Creative Suite. Audition 4 was shipped as part of the Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Master Collection and Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Production Premium, replacing the discontinued Adobe Soundbooth. Audition 4 was also made available as a standalone product. Enhanced integration with Adobe Premiere Pro allowed editing of multitrack Premiere projects, and users of third-party software were served by the introduction of OMF- and XML-based import\/export functions. Other new features included improved 5.1 multichannel support, new effects (DeHummer, DeEsser, Speech Volume Leveler, and Surround Reverb), a History panel, faster and fully supported realtime FFT analysis and a new audio engine (more reliable and faster) for non-ASIO devices.\n\nAccording to Adobe,[3] Audition CS5.5 was rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of parallel\/batch processing for performance and make it a platform-agnostic product. Audition CS5.5 now works on Windows and Mac platforms. Over 15 years of C++ code was analyzed, and many, but not all, features of the previous Audition 3 were ported and\/or enhanced. Notable features that were present in Audition 3, but removed for CS5.5 include VSTi support and MIDI sequencing. Unlike all the previous versions, this is the first version to be available as a Mac version as well as a Windows version.\n\nVersion 5 (CS6)\n\nAdobe showed a sneak preview of Audition CS6[4] in March 2012 highlighting clip grouping and automatic speech alignment (which had its technology previewed[5] in September 2011). Audition CS6 was released on April 23, 2012, as part of both Creative Suite 6 Master Collection and Creative Suite 6 Production Premium. It included faster and more precise editing, real-time clip stretching, automatic speech alignment, EUCON and Mackie control surface support, parameter automation, more powerful pitch correction, HD video playback, new effects; and more features.\n\nVersion 6 (CC)\n\nAdobe Audition 6, also more commonly known as Audition CC, was released on 17 June 2013. It is the first in the Audition line to be part of the Adobe Creative Cloud. Also, Audition CC is now the first 64-bit[6] application in the Audition line. This can provide faster processing time when compared to Audition CS6. New features include sound remover, preview editor and pitch bender.[7]\n\nVersion 7 (CC 2014)\n\nAdobe Audition 7 was released on June 2014 with the name Adobe Audition CC 2014.\n\nVersion 8 (CC 2015)\n\nAdobe Audition 8 was released on June 2015 with the name Adobe Audition CC 2015.\n\nSee also\n\n\n  1. ^ [1] 2015 release of Adobe Audition CC now available\n  2. ^ [2] United States SEC Form 10-Q, Adobe Systems, Inc., May 30, 2003\n  3. ^ [3] Adobe Forums: Audition CS5.5 and the future of Audition\n  4. ^ [4] Adobe Audition CS6 Sneak Peek\n  5. ^ [5] MAX 2011 Sneak Peek - RubbaDub\n  6. ^\n  7. ^\n\nExternal links\n\n  \u2022 Official website\n  \u2022 Adobe Audition on Adobe Labs\nThis article was sourced from Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.
