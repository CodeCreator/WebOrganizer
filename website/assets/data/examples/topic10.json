        "text":"\n\nI just want to focus more on the foods eaten by different Nigerian tribes, I have seen countless numbers of email from white ladies that are married to Nigerian men, questions about what to make for dinner if you are married to a Nigerian man, \u201cI am married to Igbo man, what do I make for breakfast?\u201d stuff like that.\n\nI listed the most popular and generally accepted Nigerian foods at the very top of our home page and here I just want to focus on what Igbo people (men, women and children) like to eat. In case you are dating or married to a Nigerian man or you are friends with people from Igbo, here are some of their favorite recipes\n\nOf course they would accept almost any deliciously made Nigerian foods but a surprise treat would indeed surprise them.\n\nI would go along to list them and then drop a link to the individual pages where you can learn more about what to serve an Igbo man. I have written a page about all kinds of soups eaten in Nigeria but I am going to separate them right here, I want to start with different kind of Igbo soups then I will talk about other Igbo recipes at the bottom of the page.\n\nHere is my list of Igbo foods\n\nThe first on my list of Igbo foods is a combination of fufu and uha soup. Oh, how I love this Igbo delicacy! As a matter of fact there were days I eat fufu like five times in a week, it is a very heavy food and very scarce in this part of the world where I now live.\n\nLike I said, it is a very heavy food and the best time to enjoy this would be in the afternoon or four hours before you go to bed, although we never cared about all this while in the village, then we were young and we eat whatever we feel like eating but now the case is slightly different.\n\nClick on the Image above to learn more about Uha Soup and Fufu.\n\nFufu can also go with Nigerian bitter leaf soup, this soup can be made into different recipes, the Igbo like to make this soup with cocoyam (ofe ede), it is one of the popular Igbo soups \u2013 Ofe Onugbu, we have a detailed instruction on making Igbo Bitter Leaf Soup, you will also find a video on the page.\n\nAnother popular Igbo food (soup) is Okra soup. This is actually one of the easiest and cheapest Nigerian soup, I remember we used to make a very small pot of okra soup with just about two hundred and fifty Naira (250), more like a one dollar soup. I like to make this soup with fresh fish, it is very delicious. Learn more here about Making Okra Soup\n\nIgbo Popular Desserts\n\nHere are my two most popular Igbo deserts, of course you will also find them on the page About All Desserts Eaten in Nigeria, this two in particular is very special to the people of Igbo, they are African salad and nkwobi, I like them too.\n\nOver the past few months I have gotten lots of questions about how to make Nkwobi, a favorite dessert of the people of Igbo, here you will find a very comprehensive guide. We made Nkwobi chicken as almost any kind of meat now could be used in making this Igbo delicacy. Learn How We Made Nkwobi In The Nigerian Kitchen\n\nThe second is an African salad (Abacha, Ugba, jakwu), we call it different names. I never liked this desserts neither have I considered it one of Igbo foods until my mum made a very delicious recipe, On this page I did it the exact way as my mum, we the Igbo girls learn how to cook foods from our mothers. Here is a great tip on Making African Salad(Jakwu, Abacha), I even included a video, Enjoy!\n\nOther Igbo Foods\n\nThere are several other Igbo recipes, I will include them on this page as I remember them or as they are discovered. The last food I would be talking about here would be African breadfruit (ukwa), most people keep asking the question \u201cwhat is African breadfruit?\u201d I tried to answer that question comprehensively on this page that is dedicated to it, I made a video too for this Igbo recipe.\n\nOther Nigerian Delicious Foods\n\nSubscribe To Improve Your Cooking!\n\nFrom Igbo Recipes \u2013 Other Nigerian foods\nIf you have a question or comment use the box below, thanks\n\n\n  1. petti \u00a0June 25, 2013\n\n    I am married to an igbo man and would really love to learn about all the igbo recipes, I made jollof rice a couple of days back and it was very tasty, he loved it!

I want to learn how to create meals he will be familiar with but everything sounds so exotic. I am a very good cook in America. I can cook American, Italian, Chinese, and some Irish meals but I want his family not to be disappointed in me. We have enough strikes against us as it is. I\u2019m older and white. He is younger and black. We don\u2019t care but not to be able to cook even a simple Igbo meal might be a reason for them not to attend our wedding. I wish your videos told how to pronounce the different meals and the different items that go in them. Any help would be appreciated. I will be buying your cookbook at the end of the month.\n\n  16. Adekusibe Adelayo \u00a0August 18, 2014\n\n    Helo Mrs chy, I need a copy of the Nigerian cook book, I reside in mowe-ogun state. Can it be delivered to me? N will I pay before or after delivery?

Highlights a number of great hops in both flavor and aroma. Very common of a northwest IPA and nice to see a bold IPA in the northeast. The bottle I had was 20 days old, so still fresh and relatively young.\n\nA little more malt body or higher lovibond would give more balance and tone down the hops and make it a better transition IPA while still focusing on the hop profile.\n\nOverall this is a very hop forward IPA and very good for what I expect for the style\n\nPhoto of StoutHunter\n4.02\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +12%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nI got a bottle of City Steam's Innocence Ale last week in a trade with @Motozappa, Thanks a lot! I've never heard of this brewery till Motozappa mentioned it and I'm interested to see what this beer is all about, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.\n\nA- The label looks really nice, it's got a nice design to it with a provocative librarian in the middle and they even recommend it to librarians, I think it's pretty eye catching, I know if I saw this on the shelf it would catch my eye. It poured a orange color that took on slightly golden hue and it took on more of a darker orange color when held to the light with two fingers worth of dense looking off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and left a good amount of spotty and patchy lacing behind. This was a very nice looking beer, I really liked the color and the head and lacing weren't bad at all.\n\nS- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness and it's followed by the hops being the first to show up and they impart some light floral and light piney hops aromas with the citrus and fruit hops sticking out the most with some nice grapefruit and citrus rind aroma with a nice and slightly lighter juicy aspect in the background. Up next comes the malts which impart some caramel malt and bread crust like aromas with some lighter sweet malt aromas in the background along with a very light amount of doughy yeast. This beer had a pretty good aroma, the hop profile was nice and it had good balance to it.\n\nT- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness followed by the malts being the first to show up this time and they impart some nice caramel malt and bread crust flavor with a slight grainy flavor in the background along with a very light amount of doughy yeast. Up next comes the hops which impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma, but there's also a light spicy hop aspect and the citrus rind hops seem to stick out the most, but not by much. On the finish there's a slightly higher amount of medium bitterness with a grainy, caramel malt and citrus rind hop aftertaste. This was a pretty good tasting beer, it had nice balance to it and it wasn't overly bitter.\n\nM- Smooth, clean, a little crisp, on the slightly thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it was true to style and it worked well with this beer.\n\nOverall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of an IPA, the description on Beeradvocate says that this is a traditional and old school IPA and I think it fits in to the category well, instead of fancy hops it relies on balance and I like that. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, not too filing and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, if I had another one I would drink it and I think two or three of these would be the prefect amount for me. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, it was pretty much perfect and neither aspect was too overpowering. What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't any aspect that was lacking. I would buy this beer if I ever had the chance and I would recommend it to people who like simple and drinkable IPA's. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it pretty much delvered everything that It said it would, but I'm not sure this one will be the talk of the librarian community. This beer made for a good first impression of this brewery and I hope I can try some more of their beers. Good job guys, this was a very solid IPA and I hope to try some more of your beers in the future.\n\nPhoto of mttaylor1066\n3.92\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +9.2%\nlook: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nI see that others have rated this lower than I do. Not sure why. I think this is a robust IPA with only a small deficiency on the nose.\n\nI like the substantial body on this beer and the color is right in the IPA range. There isn't a lot of hoppy fragrance on the nose. But, on the other hand, the Czech hops don't make much of an appearance in this brew.\n\n\nPhoto of tigg924\n2.93\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -18.4%\nlook: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.5\n\nAppearance: high carbonation, 1 inch head, hazy, amber in color\n\nSmell: pine and citrus hops with light caramel\n\nTaste: grapefruity citrus hops dominate with piney and earthy hops along with bready caramel\n\nMouthfeel: Bitter with light sweetness and a dry bitter aftertaste, light body, high carbonation\n\nOverall: An average IPA that is on the bitter side but true to style. Not bad, but nothing distinguishes this one from countless other IPAs I have had. I will pass on this in the future.\n\nPhoto of Flounder57\n3.78\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +5.3%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75\n\n12 oz bottle was poured into a pint glass.\n\nAppearance: This beer poured a one finger head that reduced to a thin layer. It is a hazy copper amber color with a little bit of clarity and bubbles seen coming up through the glass. Nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank.\n\nSmell: Citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, caramel, and grassy hops.\n\nTaste: Tangerine, grapefruit, orange, grassy, and lemon\/lime hops followed by caramel malts and mild hop bitterness.\n\nMouthfeel: Smooth, a little bitter, a little creamy, medium bodied, and medium carbonation.\n\nOverall: Pretty nice IPA from Hartford. A new reason to stop there when driving on 84.\n\nPhoto of johnnnniee\n3.74\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +4.2%\nlook: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75\n\nOn tap at the source.\nComes to the table a solid golden amber with a decent head that leaves lots of lace on the way down. Smells of bitter citrus and earth with lots of caramel maltiness to back it up. Old school aroma reminds me of Harpoon. The flavor follows the aroma with lots of grapefruit and lemon pith with hints of pine and a bit of caramel and brown bread to back it up. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Nice old school IPA I enjoyed it.\n\nPhoto of Thads324\n2.63\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -26.7%\nlook: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 2.5\n\nFreshest keg on tap at the brewery:\n\nPours a lovely deep amber with copper hues. Pillowy white head that never dissipates fully. Solid lacing.\nAromas of super sweet caramel and toffee. Some grassy floral hops and a very small hint of pine and citrus.\nTaste starts watery, then very sweet. Lots of caramel and toasty toffee. Very sweet sugary flavor. The hops start in the middle, solid bitterness but no discerning flavors really. Very muddled. Too much going on for one hop to shine through. Just not good at all.\nMouthfeel is medium, heavily car... (truncated)",

        "text":"Advertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nRecipe courtesy of Susan Spicer's cookbook, \"Crescent City Cooking\"\n\n\nServes 4\nPrep time: about 45 minutes\n\n\n3 ounces fresh goat cheese, at room temperature\n\n1\/4 pound pancetta, diced and cooked until crisp\n\n2 tablespoons diced marinated sun-dried tomatoes\n\n1 teaspoon herbes de Provence or fresh herbs of your choice (such as rosemary, thyme, and\/or basil)\n\n1 garlic clove, minced\n\nThis filling can be made one day in advance. Using a fork, combine the goat cheese, pancetta, tomatoes, herbs, and garlic in a small bowl. Chill the mixture for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld. When ready to use it, let the cheese mixture soften slightly at room temperature.\n\n\n1 cup Zinfandel or full-flavored red wine\n\n1 medium shallot, finely minced\n\n2 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary, or a combination\n\n2 cups lamb stock (or substitute rich Chicken Stock [see book for recipe])\n\n2 tablespoons butter, cut in four pieces\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nPlace the wine, shallot, and herb in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the stock, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer until reduced to 1\/2 cup of liquid. Remove the herb sprigs.\n\nWhisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time. The sauce should be glossy and slightly syrupy (but not so thick that it sticks your lips together; add a tablespoon or two of hot water if it gets too thick). Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n\n1 1\/2 pounds boneless lamb loin, cut into 4 (6-ounce) portions\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\nGoat Cheese Filling\n\nZinfandel Sauce\n\nSeason the lamb with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Sear the lamb on both sides for a minute or so, to brown, and then reduce the heat and cook each side 3\u20134 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and let rest. You may serve the loins whole or sliced, with equal portions of the goat cheese mixture crumbled along the top and Zinfandel sauce spooned over it.\n\nPenelope Makes the Lamb\n\nHere's what to serve at your next (small) dinner party. I used store-bought organic chicken stock for the Zinfandel sauce, but otherwise hewed exactly to Spicer's instructions. The bang-per-buck ratio was enormous: The goat cheese dressing and silky, deep purple Zin sauce were gorgeous-looking and -tasting, and took so little time and brain power that I felt quite cheflike and preened for hours afterwards \u2014 causing much eye-rolling in my family. There's something about a sauce....\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text":"Saturday, December 26, 2009\n\nFish Bones @ Chelmsford, MA\n\n\u00a0FishBonesWhen our friends, Siaw Lay and Alan was in town, we brought them to our favorite seafood restaurant in Chelmsford. Fish Bones offer a selection of fresh and yummy seafood dishes as well as a selection of fresh & raw seafood. Yes, it\u2019s got a little fish market inside! It probably felt weird to some, eating at the fish market\u2026.but hey just imagine that\u2019s a whole display of desserts! Haha!\n\nThe first time we were there, the place was small, tables were limited and it was quite a wait during dinner time. They have expanded since and offer more seating within the premises. We brought our guests there during lunch on a week day. There weren\u2019t much patrons, hence we were seated immediately. The interior was quite tastefully decorated and the new wing even had a gorgeous (faux?) fireplace.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what we ordered that day:\n\n1) Seafood Chowder (Bottom Left) @ $3.99\/per cup. I ordered this yummy creamy cup of satisfaction which was the soup of the day! I believe the soup was a cream base, filled with chunks of scallops, clams?, fish and shrimp. I would definitely order this the next time I\u2019m there!\n\n2) Clam Chowder (Bottom Right) @ $3.99\/per cup. Hubby and Alan ordered this. It was filled with clams and potatoes. I did not like this very much as I think they added a lil\u2019 too much dill (I assume)in the soup. The dill was a bit overpowering.\n\n\n3) Calamari Basket (Bottom Left) @ $8.99. Point Judith Calamari, deep fried to golden brown served with a side of their spicy Chipotle sauce. This was very good! The calamari were very fresh and lightly coated in the batter, which was fried to a golden perfection. I forgot how the Citpotle sauce tasted, though. Not sure if I even had it. I might have eaten the fried calamari plain.\n\n4) Lobster Roll (Bottom Right) @ $14.99. A toasted roll filled with lobster salad, served with fries and coleslaw. The price was quite decent for a lobster roll plus 2 sides. I\u2019ve seen lobster rolls (no sides, nothing) being priced at $14.99. Alan ordered this dish and commented that it was decent and the lobster meat was chopped a bit too finely. I think he said that wasn\u2019t the best lobster roll he had.\n\n\n5) Maryland Crab Cake Sandwich (Bottom Left) @ $11.99. Two homemade Maryland style crab cakes served on a freshly made Brioche burger roll with lettuce, tomato, pickles, fries and homemade coleslaw. Siaw Lay ordered this and I forgot what was her comment on it. They surely looked delicious! It was however, one of my first? time seeing a deep fried crab cake. I\u2019ve usually eaten crab cakes, pan fried style only.\n\n6) Luncheon Grill Mix (Bottom Right) @ $10.99. Grilled swordfish tips, tuna tips and two large shrimp served over a bed of rice pilaf with grilled assorted vegetables. Hubby ordere this and he loved it! He cleaned the plate so fast!!!\n\n\u00a0FishBones8 FishBones9\n\n7) Sesame Steak Tuna Sandwich (Bottom) @ $9.99. Grilled Sushi Grade #1 yellow fin tuna, marinated in sesame oil and coated in sesame seeds and grilled to temperature, served on a freshly baked brioche burger roll with seaweed salad, lettuce, tomato, pickles, homemade coleslaw and fries. This was mine, mine, MINE!! I ordered the tuna cooked rare, but it came to me almost like medium rare. I was surely disappointed as I prefer my tuna just lightly seared on the outside and very very rare in the inside. The tuna however was surprisingly still very moist and flavorful in the inside\u00a0 and I still enjoyed it despite the tuna being \u201covercooked\u201d to me. When the waitress came around and asked how was everyone\u2019s food, I told her about mine. She was nice to apologize and mentioned she could bring us a dessert on the house (which was a nice gesture). She also said to order the tuna steak sandwich, sushi style so that it will be cooked rare to my preference. Tips, noted!\n\n\nWe unfortunately did not have any room left in our tummy\u2026\u2026.So, we actually had to pass on the free dessert!! Haha! Service and food were all good!!! And that was why it\u2019s one of our favorite seafood places!\n\nIf you\u2019re in town, or if you\u2019re willing to drive to Chelmsford\u2026.give Fish Bones a try! Lunch would probably be less busy and you most likely need not wait. There are plenty of parking behind the premises\u2026you would have to drive slower as you approach the address as you might miss the entrance into the parking lots. During the summer, Fish Bones also offer some outdoor seating for those who want to get a bit of sunshine. And if you want to see the chefs busy in action, there are also some bar seats overlooking the kitchen!\n\nCheck out Fish Bone\u2019s restaurant HERE and their Fish Market HERE.\n\nNo comments:\n\nRelated Posts with Thumbnails",

All Indian festivities and events are celebrated and decorated with authentic and unique cooking and food dishes particular to that event. The placement of the Indian-sub continent, external and internal cultural influences has shaped a particular style of Indian recipes and positioned India in the culinary history of the world. Indian cuisine, Indian cooking, Indian recipes are as diverse as India is, full of striking contrasts.\n\nEveryone is wanting to know what kinds of food Indian people eat, and look for authentic Indian curry recipes and easy Indian recipes, but majority of Indian recipes are in fact straightforward to cook. Authenticity of recipes does depend on the Indian region the Indian cooking and Indian food recipe comes from.\n\nNow Indian food is popular all over the world and Indian food, Indin cooking and Indian recipes are well sought after around the world. Authentic Indian curry recipes are especially a treat. From lavish Chicken Recipes and meat dishes to simple mango chutney and Indian fry bread recipes\n\nHistory of Indian Food\n\nIndian cuisine - In the history of Indian food the Mughal Empire brought great influences from the Middle East and Afghanistan, bringing exotic spices and dried fruits and nuts, combining with milk and cream to create rich Indian Mughlai dishes. The Mughals later adapted the cooking to their own style, delicately flavoured, rich smooth sauces; include kormas, pasandas and wonderfully fragrant biryanis and pilaus, all of which have become extremely popular in and outside of India.\n\nRelated Indian Categories\n\nIndian Foods cultures and Indian Recipes\n\nIndia adapted to the rich culture, and made their own particular contribution to the Indian cuisine. Foods of India - Kashmiris from the north used saffron and other rare condiments, giving Indian recipes, especially sweets and puddings a festive touch.\nEach Indian region used herbs and spices that were found growing locally. This resulted in housewives being compelled to experiment the same ingredients, but using different cooking methods. The same ingredients cooked differently, gave dishes its unique and diverse taste, colour, and textures which resulted in the same Indian recipes having quite a number of variations. Hence popular Indian vegetarian recipes are vastly available.\n\nTraditional Indian Recipes\n\nTraditional Indian recipes, Indian food and Indian cooking includes Biryani recipes and Indian Curry recipes that has a spicy and aromatic sauce with it, Tandoori chicken, which is spicy and full of aroma, chutney and of course Indian bread.

        "text":"Dining out involves grappling with\u00a0countless variables before you even order. Is your reservation at a civilized hour?\u00a0Do you have a desirable table next to attractive patrons who aren\u2019t talking about finance or constantly photographing their food? Are you located in what you consider to be a prime location of the restaurant, preferably in view of the main entrance (but not so close that you get a chill, mind)?\n\nThen the menu arrives, with its list of small plates, and a hovering waiter eager to explain it. This is all unwelcome, of course, but there is one thing everybody wants to know:\u00a0What\u00a0is the chef\u2019s signature dish? You probably know this ahead of time. The\u00a0Times\u00a0and\u00a0New York\u00a0magazine and the rest of the reviews conveniently put it in a box, with equally pressing information like the address, phone number, and whether or not they take American Express.\n\nEvery so often, there is one item on a menu that\u2019s so out of place that it catches your eye: What is that doing there?\n\nThe signature dish rules all; it\u2019s the coin of the realm. We want to bask in the chef\u2019s expertise\u2014the beef-cheek ravioli that you can\u2019t live without, the carrot that\u2019s \u201cInstagrammable,\u201d the piece of meat with a gigantic bone sticking out of it. Menus are built around famous dishes. Some receive names burnished with legend, like French Laundry\u2019s \u201cOysters and Pearls.\u201d At the soon to be shuttered\u00a0wd~50, there was a tasting menu devoted to Wylie Dufresne\u2019s greatest hits, like shrimp cannelloni with chorizo and Thai basil\u2014proof of patrons\u2019 ongoing devotion\u00a0to the avant-garde classics.\u00a0Even if you know better, you feel like you should play to the chef\u2019s most famous strength. When somebody asks if you\u2019ve had the cote de boeuf at Minetta Tavern, you want to be able to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve had it, but, to be honest, I prefer the one at Blanca.\u201d\n\nsiberia_lugersThe menu at Peter Luger leaves no ambiguity\u00a0about what the signature dish is. (Photo: Michaelgallagher\/Flickr)\u00a0\n\nSome restaurants signal\u00a0an important dish by adorning it with hard-to-miss graphic flourishes. On Rotisserie Georgette\u2019s lunch menu, the highly recommended\u00a0poulet frites\u00a0is surrounded by a tall ellipsis. At Peter Luger, if you even bother to look at a menu, you\u2019ll find a large box that says Steak for Two, Steak for Three, and so on. Traditionally, most menus have had their own internal logic\u2014you progress from light to heavy, from fish to fowl and on to beef. There are rarely surprises. But every so often, there is one item on a menu that\u2019s so out of place that it catches your eye: What is\u00a0that\u00a0doing there?\n\nIt\u2019s either a woeful miscalculation or something so incongruous it must be truly inspired. Not the three-pound lobster at a steak restaurant, or a token gluten-free choice. No, this is a dish with some thought behind\u00a0it, but one that still seems out of place. Like a comic actor playing Hamlet, it\u2019s either a poor gimmick or truly visionary. Think of it as ordering Siberia.\n\nThis thought occurred to me when numerous friends mentioned that the burger at Lure, the Soho seafood\u00a0restaurant, was surprisingly good. If you go to a restaurant that serves sushi, chances are you\u2019re not going to progress to the burger. But like those people who go to a concert to\u00a0see the opening act, there is a knowing circle of aficionados that\u00a0goes to Lure just for the beef.\n\nsiberia_lureburgerDespite specializing in seafood, Lure Fishbar has a devoted following for its burger. (Photo: Lure Fishbar)\n\nThe dish that\u2019s always surprised me most is the duck at Le Bernardin. The only meat on a menu entirely devoted to seafood, it\u2019s under the mercurial menu category \u201cUpon Request,\u201d as if it should be ordered in a whisper. Just what happens when you make this request? Does the waiter raise an eyebrow? Are you discretely escorted from the dining room? Does Eric Ripert come out of the kitchen and explain the premise\u00a0of the entire restaurant?\n\nSo I went to Le Bernardin with the perverse intention of\u00a0not even ordering fish.\u00a0This struck me as downright devious\u2014in the four-star dining sense, as incongruous as buying a painting by Bob Dylan. The no-fish plan was quickly dashed when the kitchen brought out its\u00a0wonderful salmon rillette to start. Then I enjoyed a finely sliced artichoke with a light vegetable risotto\u00a0in\u00a0lemon broth. Delightful.\n\nOne of the conditions of ordering Siberia is that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into\u2014it\u2019s necessarily unexpected..\n\nThe main course was crispy duck breast, slightly salted, quite rare, garnished with snow peas and finished with a sour cherry sauce. Was it good? Of course it was good; everything at Le Bernardin is beautifully executed. I drank red wine. I\u2019ve never had red wine at Le Bernardin before. Then I thought a moment. Eric Ripert, and his chefs, are clearly inspired by fish\u2014that\u2019s what drives them, what animates their cooking. That\u2019s what they dream about, why the restaurant exists, and, ultimately, why it excels. My meal was lovely, but it wasn\u2019t transporting in the way other meals I\u2019ve had there were. Le Bernardin makes it seem like they\u2019ve invented every fish they serve\u2014each preparation\u00a0feels like the first time you\u2019re truly\u00a0tasting something. This duck experience felt more earthbound. And the fault was certainly not theirs\u2014I ordered the meal. They didn\u2019t misrepresent themselves; I did that myself.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. At Le Grand Vefour, the two-star Michelin restaurant on the Palais Royal in Paris, the historic room is remarkably elegant. Colette ate there, as\u00a0did Fragonard. There\u2019s a dish that neither would recognize at the bottom of chef Guy Martin\u2019s otherwise reassuring menu: The last of the desserts is an artichoke tart. It\u2019s a compelling suggestion. It turns out to be neither sweet nor savory, a thin layer of\u00a0cr\u00e8me brulee\u00a0combined with artichokes, and covered with candied vegetables. It\u2019s masterful.\n\n\nCr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e aux artichauts at Le Grand Vefor (photo: Saundra Austoni\/L\u2019esprit Sud Magazine)\n\nOne of the conditions of ordering Siberia is that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into\u2014it\u2019s necessarily unexpected. There\u2019s a\u00a0backstory you\u2019re eager to learn, like when a\u00a0mysterious guest shows up at a party. The Monte Carlo, in my hometown Minneapolis, serves steak, chops, and fried chicken in a classic midcentury room. They also offer beef liver. I asked once what that was doing there, and the owner said he tried to take it off the menu, but a small, vocal minority came in to order just that, and they would be damned if it was going to go away.\n\nOne suspects that\u2019s what chicken hash is still doing at the \u201921\u2019 Club\u2014that it got grandfathered in, and that there are devotees who insisted on its presence. And that\u2019s the beauty of ordering Siberia. It\u2019s a reminder that traditions can\u2019t be predicted, and that every unexpected dish was new once, hoping to become a standby with its own devoted following.",

        "text":"Food Safety Culture Becoming the Law\n\nFood Safety Culture Becoming the Law\n\nThe European Commission has proposed some addition to the regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs (Regulation 852\/2004). One aspect of the changes to the regulation will be a requirement for the adoption of the concept of a \u201cfood safety culture\u201d within all food businesses. This concept has gained momentum in recent years and was adopted by Codex Alimentarius. The idea is that a food safety culture within a food business enhances food safety, by increasing the awareness and improving behaviour of employees in food businesses. The implementation of the food safety culture will take account of the nature and size of the food business.\n\nThe proposed addition to the regulation will require food businesses to establish, maintain and provide evidence of an appropriate food safety culture by fulfilling the following requirements:\n\n  \u2022 commitment of the management and all employees to the safe production and distribution of food\n  \u2022 leadership towards the production of safe food and to engage all employees in food safety practices\n  \u2022 awareness of food safety hazards and of the importance of food safety and hygiene by all employees in the food business\n  \u2022 open and clear communication between all employees in the food business, within an activity and between consecutive activities, including communication of deviations and expectations\n  \u2022 availability of sufficient resources to ensure the safe and hygienic handling of food.\n\nManagement commitment shall include:\n\n  \u2022 ensuring that roles and responsibilities are clearly communicated within each activity of the food business\n  \u2022 maintaining the integrity of the food hygiene system when changes are planned and implemented\n  \u2022 verifying that controls are being performed timely and efficiently and documentation is up to date\n  \u2022 ensuring that the appropriate training and supervision are in place for personnel\n  \u2022 ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory requirements\n  \u2022 encouraging continual improvement of the food safety management system of the food business, where appropriate, taking into account developments in science, technology and best practices.\n\nThe proposal for the addition has been agreed, however is not published yet and the date for publication is not known at this time. The FSAI will share the addition once it is published.",

        "text":"\n\nLife as a Mom, A Homesteader, A Blogger and A Wife.\n\nGluten Free For a Day\n\nWhen we agreed to welcome a young friend to visit for the day we realized we had a little work to do, as our pal cannot eat gluten. We have become accustomed to our milk\/egg\/tree nut\/agave free kitchen but gluten can be tricky! I turned to the internet and planned a gluten free AND kid-friendly menu. Here is what we came up with:\n\nAnnie's Gluten Free Mac and Cheese\n\nI found this at the local Whole Foods and paid about $3 for a box. I generally pay around $1 for a traditional boxed Mac And Cheese but for gluten free this seemed reasonable.\n\nOur Thoughts: We were surprised at how yummy this was. Abby couldn't have it because of the cheese but everyone else (especially our visitor) loved it. It was kid friendly and had great texture. I found it a nice option for gluten free but not what I would expect for Mac and Cheese.\n\nWe paired our lunch with some nice watermelon and carrots as both are blissfully celiac approved!\n\nAfter lunch I made sure to have something sweet on hand. It turns out one of our Abby-friendly vegan desserts is also sans gluten. We ALWAYS keep some Zen Brand Vegan Pudding on hand. Fortunately, it is also a safe option for our visitor.\n\nOur Thoughts: This was clearly a win! We always have a least one 4-pack in our fridge at all times. I pay between $2.50 and $3.50 for a four pack. It is Abby's absolute favorite and the chocolate would please even a picky non-vegan gluten eater.\n\nOur play date went perfectly and the food seemed like any other day with a house full of kids. We are learning more and more about this gluten free lifestyle and thankfully there are more and more wonderful recipes and options for the gluten free family!\n\n\n\n\nAbout this blog\n\nOver 8 years we have struggled through 3 IUI's, 6 rounds of IVF, several RE's, hundreds of appointments and the loss of three little angels. Now we find ourselves the proud parents of two perfect little girls and a wonderful little boy!!\n\nBoth of our girls struggle with some disabilities but that won't keep us down. Each day has it's own brand of insanity but we love it. Most days I am more monkey wrangler than mother but I do the best I can. Todays goal - getting to tomorrow.\n\nSearch This Blog\n\nFollow us through pictures!\n\nFollow us through pictures!\n\nGFAF Blogger\n\nGFAF Blogger\n\n\nBlog Archive\n\nThere was an error in this gadget\n\u00a9 2006\u20132015.
