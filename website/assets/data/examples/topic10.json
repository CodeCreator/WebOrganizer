        "text":"Brunching at Lindey\u2019s\n\n{by alexis}\u2013The best part about hosting out-of-towners is that I get to play tour guide, and usher them to see (and eat!) the best Columbus has to offer. You may remember my good friends Suzanne and Nick from my first blog post ever. This time, they jetted in from Boston to catch the Virginia Tech game (Suze is a dedicated hokie), and after all that football (and maybe a few tears), we were ready for an extravagant brunch the next day. Lindey\u2019s was really the only choice.\n\nWe rolled ourselves out of bed late \u2014 even Indiana Bones slept in! \u2014 and headed out the door. I love surprising guests: they are always shocked to learn we\u2019re walking to the fancy brunch place! Yes, we in Ohio have walking neighborhoods, too!\n\n\nTheir building is the picture of charm, don\u2019t you think? The windows, the awning \u2014 it all works together. I love the design so much, that I actually used their font as inspiration for our wedding invitations! True story!\n\nI love Lindey\u2019s, but know they cater to a particular crowd. We were hustled out of the waiting area so the host could cheerily sit some of his regulars. Just be aware.\n\nAs hungry and tired as we were, we opted to skip the wait and eat in the dining room. The patio is beautiful, but after being exposed to the elements for most of the previous day, I was happy to soak in a little a\/c and get out of the sun. We started where you should always start at brunch: Carpaccio. capraccioI\u2019ve had it before here, and I\u2019d be happy to make this a meal on its own. Everything about this dish is a win: the portabella strips are an earthy pairing, the chipotle aioli has an unexpected kick, and the arugula is the perfect crunch and bitter balance. Honestly, I\u2019d like to wrap all this up like a burrito and eat it, but I have a feeling that might be frowned upon.\n\nSuzanne and Nick chose an heirloom tomato flatbread, which was magnificent in its dollops of cheese and delicate vegetable slices. The flatbread is crispy, light, and makes a perfect appetizer. lindey'sOur main dishes were next up, and they did not disappoint. Suzanne went for this beautiful salmon salad, and reported back that the fish was cooked well, with lots of flavor. lindey'sWe all had a bit of a fight over who got to order the huevos rancheros, but lucky Nick won. He loved the pork belly, citing its crispy texture. I love pork belly, but have had more than a few super fatty pieces, but not here! Nick assured me that this was not one of those incidents.\n\nlindey'sJoe went for the classic benedict. Honestly, the man is a sucker for hollandaise, and can you blame him? Hot butter and egg? I mean. Don\u2019t fight it. lindey'sI ordered the crab & eggs, and it arrived in its own charming, little skillet. The potatoes were perfection: not too salty, and not bland, and the egg was cooked to perfection. And the crab was delightful. It\u2019s rich and sweet and why don\u2019t we always have this at breakfast? Mine came with its own generous helping of hollandaise which took the decadence up an extra notch or two. lindey'sFull and happy, we rolled ourselves home. I\u2019m pretty sure I convinced Suzanne and Nick that fine dining exists outside of the East coast, and so do tree-lined cobblestone streets. Lindey\u2019s is a reliable and beautiful neighborhood gem. Just don\u2019t miss the carpaccio.\n\nLindey\u2019s is located at 169 E. Beck Street. Sun-Thurs, 11am-10pm; Fri-Sat 11am-11pm.\n\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cBrunching at Lindey\u2019s\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.
