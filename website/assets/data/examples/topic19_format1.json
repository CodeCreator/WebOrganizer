And yes, it\u2019s named after the Greek God of lightening.\n\nThe Zeus laser (I am inclined to say cannon for all you Final Fantasy fans out there) possesses a range of 300 meters (just shy of 1,000 feet) and has been successfully used in Iraq. Although they only possess one Humvee equipped with the laser, plans are in effect to make more.\n\nWhy is the military laser-crazy?\n\nLasers are the dream weapon for the military. You can fire them from incredible distances with pinpoint accuracy and have the potential to be a game-changer in any battle. Advanced lasers could be used to detonate RPGs or missiles before they get to the target, they can punch through walls, and could potentially blow up ICBMs before they get too far off the ground (Reagan\u2019s infamous Star Wars plan). There\u2019s no ammunition concerns, just power, and despite being totally un-serviceable in the field, the lack of moving parts makes the possibility of breaking very slim.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nDARPA Not Satisfied With Regular Submarine, Wants a Flying One\n\nNovember 24 2008 \/ by John Heylin \/ In association with Future Blogger.net\nCategory: Gadgets \u00a0 Year: 2015 \u00a0 Rating: 4 Hot\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) wants to develop a plane capable of flight as well as submerging underwater. \u201cThe objectives issued by DARPA are for a vehicle that would have an airborne tactical radius of 1,000 nautical miles, a low-level flight radius of 100 nautical miles (which may leverage surface effects), and a submerged tactical radius of 12 nautical miles.\u201d The hope is that it could carry up to eight people and a 2,000 pound payload (check out their full proposal here).\n\nThe problem with developing a submersible aircraft is that air flows around structures differently than water. Developing a body that is efficient through the air as well as water will be incredibly difficult. It may be so daunting that the cost of developing and building working prototypes would render it un-obtainable. The funny thing is, the Navy has wanted something like this for over 60 years. \u201cThe U.S. Navy had begun contemplating the merger of aviation and submarine technologies into a single vehicle as early as 1946.\u201d Even the Russians tried to dabble in submersible airplanes (video after the jump).\n\nContinue Reading\n\nPicking Apart the Pickens Plan - 5 Big Challenges\n\nNovember 13 2008 \/ by Garry Golden\nCategory: Energy \u00a0 Year: 2017 \u00a0 Rating: 10 Hot\n\nBig Plans are susceptible to changes in the world around us, and even bold visionaries can have wrong assumptions about the future.\n\nAfter blanketing the media landscape over the summer with The Pickens Plan, T Boone Pickens has announced that he is slowing down his plans to build a massive wind farm in West Texas. Pickens\u2019 $2 billion order of GE wind turbines has not been affected, but scaling up of the project is likely to happen more slowly than originally hoped.\n\nA changing world or wrong assumptions?\nPickens has certainly felt the pains of shifts in the market where money is now in short supply and the global economic slowdown has battered his energy intensive hedge fund. But there have always been flaws to his core assumptions that support the vision that have somehow escaped widespread critical thought or media scrutiny. Pickens deserves credit for his willingness to advance the energy conversation in the US, but it does not free his Plan from closer examination:\n\n#1 Utilities won\u2019t evolve without regulatory changes\n#2 Wind needs storage to evolve\n#3 Natural Gas is a globally integrated industry, no breaking \u2018foreign\u2019 dependency there!\n#4 The Auto Industry\u2019s problem is not oil, it\u2019s the combustion engine.\n#5 Building transmission lines in my backyard or ranch?!

Meant to take out chemical weapons labs or underground bunkers, these fireballs burn up anything located inside the structure without blowing it up. \u201cThese are hollow spheres, made of rubberized rocket fuel; when ignited, they propel themselves around at random at high speed, bouncing off the walls and breaking through doors, turning the entire building into an inferno.\u201d If there\u2019s one thing that could ruin a persons day, it\u2019s a bunch of solid rocket-fuel fireballs bouncing around in a small area.\n\nDue to the secretive nature of the new weapon, not much is being said, but Wired, who initially reported the story, says that it\u2019s quite possible the fireballs (named \u201cCrashPAD\u201d and \u201cShredder\u201d) have been put into some sort of low-rate production. One wonders if this was the secret military weapon Bob Woodward was talking about a few months ago.\n\nDoes this have a future in the US Military?\n\nContinue Reading\n\nCredit Card Has Touchpad, Three Year Battery Life\n\nNovember 11 2008 \/ by John Heylin \/ In association with Future Blogger.net\nCategory: Gadgets \u00a0 Year: 2010 \u00a0 Rating: 5 Hot\n\nVisa Europe is working hard for your money, and in doing so they have come up with a credit card capable of switching around your security code everytime you enter your PIN on its touchpad. \u201cAn alpha-numeric display and keypad is built directly into the card. When making a transaction online, customers type their PIN into the card, which creates a one-time security code.\u201d Visa is working with four major banks, including Bank of America in the UK, to develop this card. Videos of how it works can be found here and here.\n\nThis is quite amazing. Having a touchpad on your credit card ensures that the code on the back of your card (that little number, usually three digits, on the back) could never be compromised without a thief knowing your PIN number. I wonder though if the numbers you press would look worn, making it easy for the thief to determine what you PIN is.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s kind of unnerving to think that your credit card has a battery life, the fact that it can run for three years could help boost confidence. You could possibly even charge it at your local bank every year on a simple flat tray. Of course, someone hacking into it within a few days is possible but by then hopefully you\u2019d have canceled it. All we need now is a credit card that can take your fingerprint.\n\nCheck out more at ITPRO\n\nvia Gizmodo\n\nUK Doing its Best to Become Dystopian with Mobile Fingerprint Scanners\n\nOctober 27 2008 \/ by John Heylin \/ In association with Future Blogger.net\nCategory: Security \u00a0 Year: 2010 \u00a0 Rating: 5 Hot\n\nThe UK police are implementing a new policy which has civil liberty groups in an uproar. Called Project Midas, it aims to put small Blackberry-like fingerprint scanners in the hands of police within the next two years. This will allow police to confirm the identity (7.5 million prints on record and climbing) of people they detain.\n\nOfficials claim that the fingerprint records will only be used for identification and all fingerprints obtained by the device will be erased. But after reading about the British bomb-sniffing laundromat I have my doubts.\n\nIn fact, the UK Police are notorious for invading the civil liberties of their people. With an estimated 1.5 million security cameras around London alone (along with a probable 4.2 million country-wide), it\u2019s no wonder the British people are feeling a little perturbed.\n\nContinue Reading\n\n1.7 Million GM Cars Will Be Equipped With OnStar's \"Stolen Vehicle Slowdown\" Software in 2009\n\nOctober 23 2008 \/ by Alvis Brigis \/ In association with Future Blogger.net\nCategory: Security \u00a0 Year: 2009 \u00a0 Rating: 9 Hot\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) and OnStar have successfully demonstrated a prototype technology called Stolen Vehicle Slowdown, which does exactly that \u2013 it allows OnStar advisors working with law enforcement to send a signal to a subscriber\u2019s stolen vehicle to reduce engine power, slowing the vehicle down gradually.\n\nThe exact process for Stolen Vehicle Slowdown (at right) goes as follows:\n\n- Once the vehicle has been reported stolen to law enforcement, the subscriber can call OnStar and request Stolen Vehicle Assistance. OnStar will confirm the subscriber has not opted out of the Stolen Vehicle Slowdown service.\n\n- OnStar uses real-time GPS technology to attempt to pinpoint the exact location of the stolen vehicle and provide this information to law enforcement to help them recover the vehicle.\n\n- When law enforcement has established a clear line of sight of the stolen vehicle, law enforcement may request OnStar to slow it down remotely.\n\n- OnStar then sends a remote signal to the vehicle that interacts with the Powertrain system to reduce engine power which will slow the vehicle down gradually.\n\nWorried that the wrong car might be targeted? OnStar insists that \u201cSafeguards will be in place to ensure that the correct vehicle is slowed down.\u201d\n\nStolen Vehicle Slowdown comes along just as more people are installing automobile kill switches to protect th...

Changes to Australian patent law aim to help researchers and innovators achieve success in their own country.\n\nIn broad terms, scientific innovation in Australia depends on a strong scientific research community and the development of new ideas that can be commercially exploited. A key factor to scientific innovations is the ability for scientists to make money from their research so that they can conduct further research and development.\n\nFive Major Trends\n\nBy Mark R. Anderson\n\nA surprisingly small number of major trends are serving as primary drivers of the world today. Two of these are new, and two more have not yet been properly defined, but all are remarkable in their impact.\n\nPrivacy vs Lunacy: More Destruction, Lower Cost\n\nOne of the great, and perhaps most tragic, trends driving world events today is the increasing ability of the small and misguided to create ever larger amounts of destruction and death. While many people focus on the appropriately frightening spread of nuclear weapons, this is only the tip of the techno-terror iceberg, as many recent events have proven.\n\nNever before have so few been able to kill so many. We have now also crossed a line beyond which we will never, as a species, return.\n\nIntellectual Property: Protecting Your Valuable Assets\n\nBy Joanna Jones\n\nThe first step to protecting your creative and intellectual effort is to identify and classify your intellectual property to determine the most appropriate way to protect it.\n\nBroadly speaking, intellectual property (IP) is a term for a group of rights provided for by law that affords protection for \u201ccreative and intellectual effort\u201d. Intellectual property rights fall into two primary categories: registrable and non-registrable rights.\n\nSustainable Productivity: Options for a World Running out of Resources\n\nBy Ian A. Maxwell\n\nThe legacy of two historical megatrends \u2013 the industrial revolution and the Enlightenment \u2013 is another megatrend: the emerging crisis in the supply of humanity's key resources.\n\nRecently I had the pleasure of sitting through a seminar given by former US\u2008Vice-President Al Gore in which he outlined the categories of challenges facing humans. Gore is a student of history, and he believes that while humans have always faced challenges, the enormity of the situation facing us today is unprecedented because our very existence on this planet is potentially under threat \u2013 and that this threat is of our own doing.",

        "text":"Sustainable Development and the Global South\n\nCollaboration with Glasgow School of Art\n\nFuture Experiences: Sustainable Development and the Global South\n\nIn 2019-2020, the SFA Network collaborated with the Glasgow School of Arts \u2013 Product Design on a project entitled the Future Experiences: Sustainable Development and the Global South. You can read more about it here.\n\nThe SFA Network is very pleased to announce that the\u00a0project\u00a0dataset collection is now live! The record is public and can be accessed here. Many SFA Members took part to the project and we would like to thank everyone for their contribution. They are included as an author on this dataset\/project.\n\nWe recommend looking at the\u00a0 \u2018Project Journey Map\u2019 and the fantastic \u2018Future Experiences Book\u2019 in order to get a feel for what is there. But don\u2019t stop there \u2013 this is a tremendously rich resource of output and know-how.\u00a0 This collaboration with the future designers from the Glasgow School of Art was truly inspiring and refreshing for the SFA team. The impact of this project and the engagement with designers is translating into the recent research applications submitted by the Network.\n\nWe encourage you to use and share the material from this project.\n\nDOI:\u00a010.5525\/gla.researchdata.1019\n\nExhibition Video - Future Experiences\n\nBy Prof Nicol Keith, Institute of Cancer Sciences\n\nThe Future Experiences: Sustainable Development & The Global South project is a joint venture with the Innovation School at Glasgow School of Art (GSA) and the UofG Sustainable Futures in Africa (SFA) Network.\n\nThis has been led and coordinated by Mia Perry at UofG along with Kirsty Ross at GSA. It\u2019s a final year honours project for the Design students at GSA.\n\nThis project asks the students to consider what happens in this global landscape ten years from now where Sustainable Development has evolved to the extent that new forms of work and communities of practice transform how people engage, learn and interact with each other, with stakeholders and with the global community around them.\n\nTopics addressed are health, energy, mobility, economies, societal structures and the environment.\n\nThe project takes a human-centered approach, rather than simply a user-centered perspective, to exploring the topic in partnership between the GSA & SFA. This brief offers the opportunity to explore the underlying complexities regarding sustainable futures, the post-colonial dynamic between \u2018norths\u2019 and \u2018souths\u2019, post-capitalism and human agency, to envision a future world context, develop it as an experiential exhibit, and produce the designed products, services and experiences for the people who might live and work within it.\n\nThe project is collaborative in nature, requiring the students to work, learn and interact with experts from for academia, civic and government organisations and NGOs from across the SFA community.\n\nThis project is still ongoing but this short video captures the essence of the project and the work-in-progress exhibition.\u00a0 The exhibition also features a second future-focused project from the final year Master of European Design (MEDes) students. The Collaborative Futures project partnered Glasgow School of Art with Glasgow City Council to explore how data could shape the experiences of Glasgow\u2019s citizens in 2030 and envisage what a well governed city might look like moving forwards.\n\nTogether, the two projects span the local to the global; exploring themes ranging from sustainable citizenship, to community participation and the value of collaborative creativity in defining how people might live and work together in the near future.\n\nA Call for Funding in Botswana\n\nBy Goitsemang Mmeko\n\nIn 2017, the Botswana SFA Hub explored the issue of human-wildlife interaction in the Mmadinare area in Botswana. The study was titled Unearthing the Dynamics of Human and Wildlife Interactions: The Case of Mmadinare Community in the Central Region of Botswana. Human-wildlife interaction is a topical issue that affects the development of grassroots livelihood, the tourism industry, food production and wildlife management. In this study, the hub explored human-wildlife conflict between the Mmadinare community and the elephant rampages that destroy crops and equipment in the ploughing fields. The findings of the study revealed the significant need for Sustainable Community Partnership in addressing human-wildlife conflict in Mmadinare. Therefore, a stakeholder dissemination workshop was held in Mmadinare on 14 August 2018 with the aim of creating sustainable partnerships to address socio-economic issues, such as human-wildlife conflict.\n\nFrom the local community\u2019s perspective, an educational game park was the best strategy to tackle the problem of human-wildlife conflict. While this idea may sound feasible, it requires a lot of resources, including an in-depth needs assessment involving experts on the environment, wildlife and natural resources as well as education. Since sufficient funds are not available, the idea was halted.\n\nThen, on 22 March 2019, The SFA Botswana research team revisited the community of Mmadinare to look into the community assets that are unexploited and can be used to help alleviate the effects of the challenges posed by wildlife on the community\u2019s livelihoods. The following community assets and resources were identified:\n\n\u2022 Lehokojwe and Makome hills\n\u2022 Matlotla-historic monuments\/buildings\n\u2022 Eco-lodge\n\u2022 Fish hatchery unit\n\u2022 Leased land\/plots\n\u2022 Letsibogo Dam\n\u2022 Dikgathong Dam\n\nTo maximize the use of these assets to benefit the residents, community asset training would be ideal in order to help locals learn how to best utilize their resources and assets for their own benefit (income, job creation, etc.). However, although a plan has been arrived at to create a reserve in the area, the lack of funds remains a major constraint. The team would welcome assistance from any donor or friend of the SFA Network.\n\nReporting on: Future Experiences | Glasgow School of Art (Expert Day 2)\n\nBy Vanessa Duclos, Research Manager of the SFA Network\n\nToday (Nov 7th, 2019) was the second opportunity for the emerging designers to engage with the experts in Sustainable Development & the Global South. For more information about the project itself, please read this post.\nThe students presented the concept scenario they had developed as a team, as well as their individual direction which is a specific aspect of the future world they have created. These individual parts will lead to the design of distinct, imaginative and interrelated products, services and experiences. While designing, the students must keep in mind who they are designing for \u2013 future workers\/future citizens \u2013 with consideration for how Sustainable Development work might evolve to enable\/afford\/alter the dynamics of people, process and practice in the Global South.\n\nAs most of them have never travelled to a destination in the Global South, they largely rely on the experts\u2019 lived-experiences to grasp the reality of those living in developing countries. I was pleased to realise that as the emerging designers broaden their research and interact\/interview the experts, they also start integrating what working across difference means, that there is more than often no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d, \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus\u201d, which are too easy and simplistic labels used to describe the disparity between the North and the South. I notice that they all felt more comfortable exploring the grey zone between both worlds where ideas and concepts can emerge, instead of stagnating in a criticism loop. While they learn from our experience, we also greatly learn from their creativity, flexibility, and open-mindedness which are skills that requires time and exposure to develop but which seem to be well built-in and natural for this group.\n\nReporting on: Future Experiences | Glasgow School of Art (Expert Day 1)\n\nBy Vanessa Duclos, lead Research Administrator of the SFA Network\nDavid Gerow, SFA Intern and PhD student\n\nThis fall, the Sustainable Futures in Africa Network is collaborating with the Glasgow School of Art\u2019s (GSA) Innovation School. Over the semester, the 4th\u00a0year product design students will work on a project on the theme of \u201cFuture Experiences: Sustainable Development & the Global South\u201d. During this 8-week project, the cohort will investigate future forms and functions of sustainable development work in relation to the Global South, ultimately developing a future scenario and designing the artefacts, services and experiences associated with it 10 years from now.\n\nToday, contemporary product design is not only an industrial or production-focused occupation; rather, it is becoming an epistemological practice, which explores the future, generates new knowledge and formulates hypotheses about how people may live or work in the years to come. Whether they are designing an artefact, service or experience, it is fundamental for a designer to know\u00a0how\u00a0to understand what drives people,\u00a0what\u00a0their needs are and\u00a0why.\n\nDr Mia Perry worked with Dr Kirsty Ross, lecturer at the GSA and final year coordinator, to build the structure of this project. Over the last couple of weeks, the students split into seven groups worked together to conduct research in the domains of Health, Energy, Mobility, Economies, Education, Societal Structures and Environment. Each of these domains was examined through various lenses: Social, Technological, Economic, Ethical, Educational, Values, Political, Legal and Ecological. Then, based on this research, the students mapped societal shifts and identified emerging themes or scenarios.\n\nThis morning, the students shared their initial future scenarios with \u201cthe experts\u201d: academics and professionals working within the field of sustainable development in the Global South, and members of the SFA Network. By sharing their work, the students had the opportunity to validate certain aspects of their research, as well as the chance to ask ... (truncated)",
