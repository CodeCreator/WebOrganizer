But to most people, it's all just trash.\n\nFinding a New Way to Go\n\nThe flush toilet was a transformative invention, but experts say its time may be past and are pioneering ways to recover energy and nutrients from human waste.\n\n\nWater Reclamation Going Green\n\nWastewater treatment plants are revamping themselves as resource recovery operations, saving\u2014and even producing\u2014energy and polluting less in the process.\n\n\nA Better Way to Denitrify Wastewater\n\nAnammox bacteria, which convert ammonia into nitrogen gas in the absence of oxygen, could dramatically improve methods of removing ammonia from wastewater streams.\n\nSave Pave the World\n\nCarbon dioxide may be the ultimate industrial waste product. Could tropical corals provide a trick for locking it away in our highways?\n\nGetting Minds Out of the Sewer\n\nThe aversion to excrement, which is deeply rooted in the human psyche, gets in the way of sensible solutions to recycling wastewater.\n\nWorld of Waste\n\nwaste infographic\nInsights into where the world's waste is coming from, where it is going, and how waste streams are changing.\n\nReviews, Perspectives, & Editorials\n\n\nConversion of Wastes into Bioelectricity and Chemicals by Using Microbial Electrochemical Technologies\n\nElectrogenic microorganisms can add value to wastewater by converting organic matter into electricity.\n\nValorization of Biomass: Deriving More Value from Waste\n\nAgricultural and food waste can potentially displace petroleum feedstocks to make organic compounds on an industrial scale.\n\nTaking the \"Waste\" Out of \"Wastewater\" for Human Water Security and Ecosystem Sustainability\n\nWastewater at various stages of treatment can supplement freshwater and thereby increase global water productivity..\n\n\nChallenges in Metal Recyling\n\nImproving waste collection, processing technologies, and product design would make metal recycling more efficient.\n\nRecycling of the #5 Polymer\n\nThe outlook is improving for recycling the common plastic polypropylene.\n\nThe Challenges of Reusing Mining and Mineral-Processing Wastes\n\nWaste materials from mining activities comprise one of the largest global waste streams by mass.\n\nAn End to Waste?\n\nAn end to waste requires we reassess our patterns of production and consumption.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nArticles in Science\n\nExternal Resources",

Continuing the planet\u2019s long-term warming trend, global temperatures in 2021 were 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or 0.85 degrees Celsius) above the... Read More\nWe answers six questions to help you understand the GISS global surface temperature analysis, what it shows about 2021 and how NASA makes sense of the data.\nClimate researchers from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will release their annual assessments of global temperatures and discuss the major climate trends of 2021 during a media teleconference at 11 a.m. EST Thursday, Jan. 13.\nNASA will launch four Earth science missions in 2022 to provide scientists with more information about fundamental climate systems.\nNASA has the world\u2019s largest Earth observing fleet and has an uninterrupted record and observed evidence of climate change. Increased greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Trapped atmospheric greenhouse gases warm the planet \u2013 our land, ocean, and atmosphere. Most of the global... Read More\nObservations from research aircraft show that the Southern Ocean absorbs much more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases, confirming it is a very strong carbon sink and an important buffer for the effects of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new, NASA-supported study.\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere reacted in surprising ways to the lowering of emissions during the pandemic, showing how closely climate warming and air pollution are linked.\nDid you know active volcanoes lie beneath the ocean\u2019s surface? The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III on the International Space Station (ISS) instrument spotted remnants of the Fukutoku-Okanoba undersea volcanic 2021 eruption in Earth\u2019s stratosphere.\nLike so many glaciers in Greenland, Kjer has retreated significantly in recent decades and now flows more rapidly toward the ocean.\nNASA is participating in the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, which began Oct. 31, and runs through Friday, Nov. 12.\nThe urgency of Earth science and climate studies took the spotlight Friday as Vice President Kamala Harris visited NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nNASA has selected a new Earth science mission that will study the behavior of tropical storms and thunderstorms, including their impacts on weather and climate models.\nVice President Kamala Harris will visit NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland today, Nov. 5, to get a firsthand look at the agency\u2019s work to combat the climate crisis and protect vulnerable communities.\nClear skies between storm systems gave satellites a cloud-free view from the Coast Mountains in British Columbia to the Rockies in western Alberta.",
