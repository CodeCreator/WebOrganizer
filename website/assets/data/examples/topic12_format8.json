We are committed to protecting your health information. We create a record of the care and services you receive at the facility, as well as records regarding payment for those services. We need these records to provide care for you and to comply with certain legal requirements. This notice applies to the records of your care generated or maintained by the facility, whether made by facility personnel or other healthcare providers. Your personal doctor may have different policies or notices regarding the doctor\u2019s use and disclosure of your PHI created in the doctor\u2019s office or clinic.\n\nThis notice will tell you about the ways in which we may use and disclose medical information about you. We also describe your rights and certain obligations that we have regarding the use and disclosure of medical information.\n\nWe are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of your PHI; to give you this notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to PHI about you; and to follow the terms of the notice currently in effect.\n\nHow We May Use and Disclose Health Information About You.We may use or disclose your health information in one of the following ways: (1) when permitted by law; (2) when required by law; (3) pursuant to your verbal agreement (for use in our facility directory or to discuss your health with family or friends who are involved in your care); and\/or (4) pursuant to your written authorization, when we are required to obtain it.\n\nThe following categories describe different ways that we use and disclose health information. For each category of uses or disclosures, we will explain what we mean and give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall into one of the categories.\n\nUses and Disclosures Relating to Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations do not Require Your Prior Authorization.\nFor Treatment: We may use health information about you to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, healthcare providers, healthcare students, or other facility personnel who are involved in taking care of you at the facility.

For example, we may release information about the care and services you received to your insurance company to receive payment.\nFor Health Care Operations: We may use and disclose medical information about you for health care operations. For example, we may use healthcare information to review care and services and to evaluate the effectiveness of programs or systems of care. There are some services provided in our organization through contracts with business associates. When we contract for these services, we may disclose your health information so that our business associates can perform the job we have asked them to do. To protect your health information, however, we require the business associate to appropriately safeguard your information. Unless you object, we will include certain limited information about you in the facility directory while you are a resident at the facility. This information may include your name, location in the facility, your general condition (e.g., fair, stable, etc.) and your religious affiliation. The directory information, except for your religious affiliation, may be released to people who ask for you by name. Your religious affiliation may be given to a member of the clergy, even if they do not ask for you by name. This is so your family, friends and clergy can visit you in the facility and generally know how you are doing. We will place a nametag on your door and take a photograph of you for identification. In order to recognize your birthday, we may post your name (with month and day of your birth) on a bulletin board (standard and\/or digital) and include this same information in our newsletter.\u00a0 In addition, pictures taken during activity programs may be posted on the bulletin boards. Please let us know if you object.\n\n  \u2022 For Health Information Organizations\/Exchanges: We may use a Health Information Organization\/Exchange to communicate your health information to other providers for treatment, payment or healthcare operations.

When abuse or neglect is suspected, we may also be required to release information. We may also disclose PHI about you in response to a court order, but only after making the effort to inform you of the request, giving you the right to object.

In addition, students who engage in active transport to and from school, recess, physical activity breaks, high-quality physical education, and extracurricular activities do better academically.\n\nThis policy outlines the District\u2019s approach to ensuring environments and opportunities for all students to practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors throughout the school day while minimizing commercial distractions.\u00a0 Specifically, this policy establishes goals and procedures to ensure that:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The District should coordinate the wellness policy with other aspects of school management, including the District\u2019s School Improvement Plan\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students in the District have access to healthy foods throughout the school day\u2014both through reimbursable school meals and other foods available throughout the school campus\u2014in accordance with Federal and state nutrition standards\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students receive quality nutrition education that helps them develop lifelong healthy eating behaviors\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students have opportunities to be physically active before, during, and after school\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Schools engage in nutrition and physical activity promotion and other activities that promote student wellness\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 School staff are encouraged and supported to practice healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors in and out of school\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The community is engaged in supporting the work of the District in creating continuity between school and other settings for students and staff to practice lifelong healthy habits\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The District establishes and maintains an infrastructure for management, oversight, implementation, communication about, and monitoring of the policy and its established goals and objectives\n\nFollow us on:\nCollege Station Independent School District\n1812 Welsh College Station, TX 77840 Phone: (979) 764-5400 Fax:\nDisclaimer & Legal\nPowered by Edlio",
