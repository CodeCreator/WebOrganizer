As more and more security-critical tasks are moved to the TEE, the complexity and thus risk of vulnerabilities increases as well. By now it are small operating systems running trusted applications and having a system call interface exposing drivers and other services.\n\nIn this talk we present a fuzzing framework for OP-TEE using an unmodified version of AFL with coverage tracking integrated in the TEE kernel using compile-time injected hooks. This framework can be used to test any code running in the kernel such as the interface exposed to the non-secure the world, as well as trusted applications embedded in the kernel and the system call interface by providing the coverage data to the non-secure world.\n\nWe discuss the challenges of fuzzing a (trusted) operating system running nonvirtualized on an actual device as well as our approach that allows using an unmodified version of AFL running as Linux application in the non-secure world. Additionally, we discuss how we created a useful set of initial inputs to seed AFL. The approach discussed in this talk is not limited to OP-TEE but could be used for any (trusted) operating system.\n\nLast, we discuss some of the latest improvements to the framework, making it more efficient and some of the issues found by fuzzing OP-TEE.\n\navatar for Martijn Bogaard\n\nMartijn Bogaard\n\nSenior Security Analyst at Riscure, Riscure\nMartijn Bogaard is a Senior Security Analyst at Riscure where he focuses most of his time on analyzing the security of low-level embedded software (bootloaders, operating systems) and is slowly expanding into embedded hardware security.

Have you mapped your workflow on your board, and are you applying WIP (Work In Progress) limits?\u2019 To which the answer repeatedly is \u2018No, we just use a Kanban board\u2019.\n\nWhat follows next is that I am asked to explain the difference between Scrum and Kanban. Which is when I normally get the question: \u2018Should we use Scrum orKanban?\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the possible deciding factors.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Two Sides Of Agile\n\nI\u2019ve been carrying this bit of paper around in my bag for about six months.

        "text":"How to Document and Configure SQL Server Instance Settings\n\nOccasionally, when you install identical databases on two different SQL Server instances, they will behave in surprisingly different ways. Why? Most likely, it is down to different configuration settings. There are around seventy of these settings and the DBA needs to be aware of the effect that many of them have. Brad McGehee explains them all in enough detail to help with most common configuration problems, and suggests some best practices.\u2026 Read more\n\nDatabase Properties Health Check\n\nWithin an instance of SQL Server, the database settings can have a direct effect on the database's behavior, performance and availability. Sometimes, it is difficult to tie a symptom to a cause, so it is wise to routinely check and record these settings. Before you change the current setting, it pays to understand exactly what it means and the implications of any change.\u2026 Read more\n\nRebuilding Indexes using the SSMS Database Maintenance Wizard\n\nIndex fragmentation can cause problems with query performance. Indexes therefore need to be occasionally rebuilt. the Rebuild Index task of the SSMS Database Maintenance Wizard drops and rebuilds every index in a database. It is effective but an off-line activity that is resource-intensive, so it not always the best way of avoiding index fragmentation in a production database. Brad explains...\u2026 Read more\n\nAutomate and Improve Your Database Maintenance Using Ola Hallengren\u2019s Free Script\n\nIf you ever feel uneasy when you set about handcrafting database maintenance jobs for SQL Server, it may be the voice of your conscience saying 'Ola, Ola!'. Follow your conscience. Ola Hallengren has already crafted a superb set of routines to do this for you. Why reinvent something that does it all, safely and well. Brad McGehee explains....\u2026 Read more\n\nA Code of Conduct for DBAs\n\nDespite the fact DBAs are protectors of an organization's knowledge, and privy to much confidential information, there is no clearly defined set of rules and standards to help govern and guide their ethical conduct. Brad McGehee, in an article based on a chapter from the second edition of his book 'How to Become an Exceptional DBA', discusses a Code of Conduct for DBAs. He advises on why such a code is required, the sort of topics it should contain, and how it might be enforced. Much of this article has relevance for any IT professional.\u2026 Read more",
