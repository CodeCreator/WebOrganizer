It costs the company about $30 more per pair but Milt says it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly improving,\u201d he says about the products he stocks. His job not only includes warehousing and distributing equipment but shopping for the best gear at the best price.\n\nThe new hiking books are waterproof and insultated to well below zero. Combined with a pair of NEOS overshoes, students\u2019 feet not only stay dry but they also stay warm.\n\nMilt\u00a0took shoe improvements an additional step. He shopped for, and found, camp sandals without holes in the uppers.\u00a0Students typically change into these \u201cCroc\u201d-like shoes at night as they gather around the fire.\u00a0\u201cNo holes means\u00a0stockings stay dry at night. That makes a big difference in whether or not feet stay warm,\u201d Milt says.\u00a0\n\nTherapy is hard work but Milt and the rest of the RedCliff Ascent staff work hard to make sure students stay safe, warm and dry as they re-build family relationships.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
