        "text":"The Carlington Summit\n\nOttawa's Spring Action Trampoline Club had a very successful weekend at the 1st Ontario Trampoline Qualifying Competition on November 13 and 14. The competition was held in conjunction with the Canadian Living Parents & Kids Show at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. This was the first trampoline competition of the season and the first competition ever for five of the young Spring Action Team members. Thirteen year-old Alex Adcock made an impressive d\u00e9but in the sport of trampoline, winning a Gold medal in the Provincial 1 Boys level. Alex comes to trampoline from a background in freestyle skiing.\n\nMatthew Patry, age 15, took the Gold medal in the Provincial Open category with a performance that also qualified him to represent the Eastern Region at the Ontario Winter Games which will be held in Sault Ste. Marie in March, 2000. Nicholas Rizewiski of Spring Action will be the alternate for the Ontario Winter Games Eastern Region Team. Rizewiski received a bronze medal in Level 2 Boys competition, with team-mate Jonathon Keon close behind in 4th place. Eleven year-old Kelly Vertes placed 4th in the Provincial 1 Junior Girls Category.\n\nOttawa also showed strong results at the National level with four silver medal performances. Kathleen Lane took silver in the Novice Women's category and Geoff McGill missed the gold by only 0.1 points in Novice Men's. Canadian Team member, Heather McManus, also from Spring Action, received the other two Silver medals for her performances in the Senior Women's Synchronized competition with partner Brenna Casey, and in the Two Trick Spectacular event where she was second to future Olympian, Karen Cockburn!\n\nTrampoline is a new Olympic sport. Competitions consist of a compulsory routine which is judged for style and execution (similar to diving or gymnastics), and an optional routine which is judged for both execution and difficulty. Each routine has ten skills which must be performed consecutively. Karen Cockburn and Matthew Turgeon of Richmond Hill will be representing Canada at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.\n\n[graphic] [graphic]\n\nAll photos by SportsWatch\n\n\nSpring Action Trampoline Team: (back) Sean McManus, Heather McManus, Eric McGill, Alex Adcock, Yolande Usher, Geoff McGill, Kelly Vertes, Kathleen Lane, Giacomo Trottier, Lynn Ashdown, Karine Halpenny.

Newall will share the circuit with fellow British drivers Don Boyack, Mark de Rozarieux and Oliver White. White is here for his second outing Down Under, after winning the Historic Formula Ford races in support of the 2018\u00a0Hi-Tec Oils Bathurst 6 Hour last year.\n\nNew Zealander Henry Kircher will be the only Kiwi racing at the Island this\u00a0year,\u00a0after a big contingent crossed the Tasman to race at Phillip Island in 2018. Kircher's car has been living in Australia ever since and the Kiwi is planning on doing more racing in Australia in 2019.\n\nLast but not least is Melbourne-based American competitor George Thornton. George will be steering his Australian-based RF86 Van Diemen.\n\nThis event will be all about celebrating the long history of the category in Australia. Cole Spender will be participating in the event aboard a Spender Lynx that his father, Phil Spender, built in New Zealand in 1971. Phil will also have a steer of his old car during the Regularity events at Phillip Island.\n\nAmong the Aussies, a few names will ring a bell to the general public.\n\nRichard Davison, son of the late Lex Davison and father of Will and Alex, will be racing his RF89 Van Diemen, alongside his niece Claire Greig, who will be the only woman in the field aboard her Reynard FF84.\n\nFormer Australian Formula Ford Champions David Roberts and Tim Blanchard will join the 50+ car field aboard a Swift FB89 and an RF88 Van Diemen, respectively. Tim, who's now retired from his full-time Supercars career, is expected to race at various Formula Ford events this year. The Blanchard family is a strong supporter of the category, with Tim's brother Harri racing in another RF88 Van Diemen over the weekend at Phillip Island.\n\nThis year the VHRR (promoter of the event) have allocated more track time to Formula Fords, with a parade lap and a longer, \"trophy race\", to be held on Sunday afternoon.\n\nVarious cars will be presented during the parade lap, with John Bowe, Larry and Terry Perkins, Tim Blanchard and David Roberts confirmed to take part in the parade.\n\nThe trophy race on Sunday will mark the beginning of a new perpetual trophy, the \"Perkins Cup\". Both Larry and Terry Perkins won the TAA Formula Ford Driver To Europe Series in the 1970s and will be at Phillip Island on Sunday to award the winner of the final race with the trophy.\n\nThe weekend celebrations will kick off on Friday with qualifying and race one, followed by another four races on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nGeneral public admission prices:\nFriday $30.00\nSaturday $35.00\nSunday $45.00\n2-day (Fri\/Sat) $50.00\n2-day (Sat\/Sun) $70.00\nWeekend (3-day) $95.00\nPensioner concession $5.00 off each of above fees\n\nFor any further information regarding this event, please feel free to contact our\u00a0VHRR category representative.\n\nFormula Ford schedule for the weekend:\n\nQualifying - 11:05AM\nRace 1 - 3:05PM\n\nRace 2 - 10:50AM\nRace 3 -2:35PM\n\nRace 4 -9:10AM\nTrophy race \"Perkins Cup\" -\u00a012:25PM\n\nFormula Ford Entry List:\n\n#1 Andy Newall (UK) - Palliser\n#2 Andrew McInness (Vic) - Van Diemen RF89\n#3 Richard Davison (Vic) - Van Diemen RF89\n#4 John Greig (Vic) - Reynard FF82\n#6 Todd Willing (Vic) - Reynard FF82\n#7 Jeremy Mantello (Vic) - Van Diemen RF86\n#8 David Roberts (QLD) - Swift FB89\n#10 Henry Thomas-Kircher (NZ) - Ray FF87\n#12 Ian Edgar (Vic) - Lola T642A\n#13 Paul McMahon (WA) - Van Diemen RF88\n#14 Steve Willing (Vic) - Swift FB89\n#17 Adam Berryman (Vic) - Van Diemen RF86\n#18 Lyndon Arnel (Vic) - Lola T440\n#21 Tim Blanchard (Vic) - Van Diemen RF88\n#22 Norm Vesty (NSW) - Zink Z10\n#22 Glen Woodforde (SA) - Reynard FF83\n#23 Bo Jensen (SA) Van Diemen RF89\n#26 George Thornton (US) - Van Diemen RF86\n#30 Andrew Lamrock (Vic) - Reynard\n#32 Jacob Bonisch (Vic) - Crossle 32F\n#33 Claire Greig (Vic) - Reynard FF84\n#35 Warwick Foletta (Vic) - Van Diemen RF75\n#36 Don Boyack (UK) - Van Diemen RF89\n#39 Mark Brunning (Vic) - Elfin 620B\n#41 Neil Richardson (SA) - Van Diemen RF89\n#42 Harrison Blanchard (Vic) - Van Diemen RF88\n#46 Phil Oaks (NSW) - Elfin 600\n#47 Adrian Wilkinson (Vic) - Van Diemen RF89\n#48 Patrick Mullins (SA) - Van Diemen RF86\n#49 Eric Bellamy (Vic) - Wren 3\n#50 David Grant (NSW) - Reynard\n#51 Jonathan Miles (Vic) - Van Diemen RF89\n#53 Nicholas Bennett (Vic) - Elfin 600\n#55 Raymond Stubber (WA) - Royale RP31M\n#57 Cole Spender (Vic) - Spender Lynx\n#58 Mark de Rozarieux (UK) - Van Diemen RF88\n#60 John Van Leeuwen (WA) - Van Diemen RF80\n#65 Robert Surman (SA) - Van Diemen RF87\n#70 Phil Marrinon (Vic) - Galloway HG5\n#72 Anthony Mann (Vic) - Van Diemen RF86\n#73 Graeme Degotardi (Vic) - Bowin P6F\n#80 Ewan Geals (Vic) - Lola T644\n#81 Simon Matthews (WA) - Royale RP29\n#87 Jeffrey Sorensen (NSW) - Streaker Ford FF01\n#88 Andrew Nethercote (Vic) - Reynard FF87\n#94 Paul Faulkner (Vic) - Crossle 32F\n#95 Will Faulkner (Vic) - Van Diemen RF86\n#100 Daniel Holihan (NSW) - Swift DB1\n#117 Craig Degotardi (Vic) - Elfin 600\n#177 Oliver White (UK) - Reynard FF89\n#188 David Brennan (Vic) - Van Diemen Piper\n#221 Frederick Frech (NSW) - Crossle 32F\n#330 Frank Harris (Vic) - Van Diemen RF86\n#342 Kevin Kosa (Vic) - Lola 340\/342\n#416 Andrew Barron (Vic) - Van Diemen RF73\n#783 John Flint (Vic) - Lola T440\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nPlease reload\n\nRecent Posts\nPlease reload",

To have another forty-plus women on the court in early December playing under the NBL banner is incredibly important to what we are trying to build for the players.\u201d\n\nThe D-League competition will see two games played on Friday 4 December, four games on Saturday 5 December, and then a Grand Final on Sunday 6 December.\n\nAll games will be played during the day ahead of the evening\u2019s NBL game, and entry for all fans will be free.\n\nIn another coup for the NBL, the D-League Grand Final will be broadcast live on Sky Sport Select (2:30pm, Sunday December 6) as a curtain raiser to the 18IN18 Grand Final which tips off at 5pm that day.\n\n\u201cAll going well, a return to a normal season in 2021 will see more than a hundred players participating in our women\u2019s NBL and D-League competitions.

The Bears placed second overall at Kaplan Arena on Friday, trailing only first-place North Carolina (194.775) and finishing ahead of William and Mary (193.425) and Rutgers (193.375).\n\nFollowing a then-school record 194.125 in last Sunday's quad meet, the Bears raised the bar once again on the strength of Morant's personal best 9.825 on beam and 9.800 on floor to claim first place in both events. Senior Michelle Shnayder (Lincolnshire, Ill.) matched Morant's 9.800 on floor to round out a trio of first-place honors for the Bears. Sophomore Diana Walters (Austin, Texas) tied for second on beam after a career-high 9.800 and took third on bars with a 9.775, while Chretien nabbed second on bars to give Brown a total of six top-three finishes.\n\nBrown sprinted out of the gate with a meet-best 48.625 on bars, driven by Chretien's inspired 9.875 that wrote her name in the Brown record books. Walters took hold of third place (9.775), Morant placed fourth (9.725) and freshman Jorden Mitchell (Indianapolis, Ind.) finished fifth (9.700) in an exceptionally strong bars field. The Bears slightly trailed William and Mary for first place after the Tribe went for a 48.725 on vault in the first rotation.\n\nBrown's elevated performance continued on beam with Morant's event-winning career-best 9.825 and Walters' personal-record 9.800, lifting the Bears to a 48.550 event score. Despite being on pace to set another program record, Brown's 97.175 was outpaced by the Tarheels, who snuck into first place with a 97.275 total after floor and vault.\u00a0\n\nMorant and Shnayder teamed up to shine on the floor exercise, tying for first place with matching 9.800 scores. Walters (9.700) took fifth and freshman Brooke Williams (Clyde Hill, Wash.) placed sixth (9.675) to contribute to Brown's 48.575 team mark.\n\nThe Bears concluded with vault and saw Shnayder and senior Rebecca Freedman (Plainview, N.Y.) tie for fourth place with 9.750. Brown reeled in a 48.475 total to secure a 194.225 for a new school team score record. North Carolina proved just strong enough to run away with the victory, however, using an outstanding 49.050 on bars to seal a 194.775 and first place.\n\nIn all-around, Morant's best score of her young career (39.025) earned second place, while Walters (38.925) took fourth and Shnayder checked in at fifth (38.700).\n\nThe quad meet concludes regular season competition for the Bears and the back-to-back Ivy Classic Champions will return to action at the ECAC Championships at Temple University on March 22.",

        "text":"Friday, March 22, 2019\n\nKewash Half Marathon\n\nThis week at Rotary Teri Hartzler and Amy Schulte invited Michelle Driscoll to talk to the group about the Kewash Half Marathon. The run started in 2014 with about 70 participants and has grown over the past 5 years with over 240 participants from 10 different states last year. Last year, over $8000 was raised, with part of the funds being returned to different organizations and clubs in the community, including 2 youth running groups in Washington, and the high school cross country team.\nThis year, the race will be held on Saturday, April 20th, and will start and finish outside JPs 207. The route goes through some of the more beautiful and historic parts of Washington, before heading west out of town onto the Kewash Nature Trail. There is a half marathon, a 10K and a 5K. New additions to the race this year include pacers for those trying to set new personal records, or who just want to run with a group of people for extra encouragement. Organizers are also hoping to have cheering sections set along the route to give runners an extra nudge to keep going. There will be a group of local firefighters who are going to run the half marathon as a relay, with each one running 1 mile in full fire gear.\nThe organizers are asking for volunteers to come out the Saturday before, April 13th, at 9 am to meet at the trail entrance near Sunset Park to help with trash clean-up. The flyer for the clean-up is pictured below, and you may contact Teri Hartzler if you are interested in helping.\n\nTeri also spoke briefly about a new program the Y is hosting for community members with special abilities. Each Tuesday afternoon in the month of April from 3-5, they Y will host The Social Scene. A new activity will be offered each Tuesday for participants to expand their skill sets and try out some new things. The flyer is pictured below with more information.\n\nUpcoming Events:\nMarch 28: Lynn Koch\nApril 4: Connie Larson\nApril 11: Willie Stone\nApril 18: Emory Van Gerpen (Holy Week)\nApril 25: Bob Lamb",

I have. I just picked up my grandson from pre-school. Jack Jack and I made a stop at McDonald's before we came home. However there are people around us who have not eaten well today. There are still many people who will go hungry, not just in Africa or Bangladesh but in the good ol' US of A.\n\nAt next week's GEICO Motorcycle AMA Pro Racing event at NOLA Motorsports Park, we shall have the opportunity to do something about hunger in one of the cities that hosts our racing. New Orleans is a city where due to poverty and weather related problems, many of the people within its influence are hungry. The Second Harvest Food Bank of New Orleans serves the hungry of the lower 22 parishes (counties) in Louisiana. We are going to have a food drive to support this food bank and we are inviting racers, teams, families, officials and fans to participate by brings containers of non-perishable foods to drop in the collection bins which will be all over the paddock and fan areas of the track. Since this is the last race of the 2012 season, we are asking teams to donate leftover food. There is a real chance to make a real difference in the lives of hungry and needy people in and around New Orleans. We are also asking racers to participate in a Wednesday work day at the food bank prior to move in day at the track. Cameron Gray and the good folks at M1 Motorsports are helping to organize this workday. If you are interested in joining the workday contact Cameron at M1. We have several riders lined up and could use more.\n\nThanks for your help and participation!\n\nTim Burleson, Chaplain GEICO Motorcycle AMA Pro Road Racing",

Picture a rising sun glistening behind the bright red barn.\n\nThat is the concept behind the 2016 Atlantic League All-Star jerseys, unveiled today by the Lancaster Barnstormers and Atlantic League (ALPB) officials. The design is in accordance with the incorporation of Lancaster County agriculture as the theme of the All-Star event.\n\nLancaster Barnstormers 2016 All-Star Game Unis Unveiled\n\nThe home Freedom Division squad will wear red, the primary color of the host Lancaster Barnstormers since the club\u2019s inception in 2005. For the visiting Liberty Division squad, the jerseys will be a bright, sunny yellow, in line with that Lancaster County clear morning.\n\nOn both sets of jersey, a Lancaster County \u201cfarmscape\u201d is imprinted on the back. This \u201cfarmscape\u201d runs consistently with the logo for the 2016 ALPB All-Star Game as does the font for the numerals and the \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cFreedom\u201d lettering on the two sets of uniform tops.\n\nThe 22 members of each All-Star Squad plus the respective coaching staffs will be dressed in these festive, one-time only jerseys, provided by TeamGear and manufactured by Alleson Athletic, the official uniform of the Atlantic League.\n\nCaps maintain the color scheme with red bills on the Freedom Division caps and buttons, while the Liberty Division will sport yellow bills and buttons on its caps. Both sets will contain the 2016 ALPB All-Star logo. Headwear for the 2016 ALPB All-Star Game is provided by OC Sports, the Atlantic League\u2019s exclusive headwear partner.\n\nThe Barnstormers partnered with Skye Design Studios ( to develop the 2016 Atlantic League All-Star Game logo and uniforms. SDS is a brand identity and design firm based in the greater New York City area with a satellite location in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of the All-Star Game is to celebrate and showcase the host area and the league. Lancaster itself is a vibrant region, so we wanted the look and feel of the All-Star Game to reflect those same qualities,\u201d said Dillon.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted the jersey to represent the uniqueness of Lancaster County,\u201d said Bob Zuckerman, one of the partners in the Barnstormers. \u201cThe All-Star logo does a tremendous job in reflecting this area, and we were able to translate that to the uniforms.\u201d\n\nLeave a comment\n\nFiled under Branding & Marketing, Conference & Events, Merchandising\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"March 1-5, 2017 : Las Vegas, NV\n\n\u201cThe storied history of the Mint is steeped in celebrity, drama and excitement as the city of Las Vegas itself. The Mint 400 has held the title of the toughest, most spectacular off-road race in North America since 1968 when it was first run. The race was created by Norm Johnson who was race director through 1974 and a participant from 69 to 82. Initially the race was a public relations event promoting the Mint Hotel\u2019s annual deer hunt, but what started out as hotel promotion soon grew into a legitimate desert race.\n\nThe Mint 400 race ended in 1988 after the sale of the Mint however the story continued in 2008 when the Great American Off-Road Race was revived. Bigger badder and better than ever, the Mint 400 is everything that is was and a whole lot more. Given the advances in off-road technology and the ever changing landscape of Las Vegas, the Mint has grown but all the classic elements are still in place.\u201d *\n\nThe Buggy Whip\u00ae Inc. Team shares in the enjoyment and excitement for this epic off road event. The Porter family\u2019s history and love of off road racing stretches back across 3 generations, when George Porter, founder of Buggy Whip Inc., raced in The Mint 400 for many years. Running alongside famed drivers and celebrities across the history of the race, makes for sharing some awesome memories. Our passion for engineering the highest quality safety and visibility products sparks from this heritage.\n\nCheck Out all that is going on this week in Vegas on the Mint 400 Website\n\nBuggy Whip\u00ae Inc. wishes each driver the best of luck! Have fun and watch your favorite driver tear up this epic course!\n\n(Photo Credit: the Mint 400 website *)\n\nThe Buggy Whip name and Logo are trademarks of Buggy Whip, Inc. All Rights Reserved.",
