Dense sound constructed from complex layered guitar poliphonies, developed vocal lines and grand piano as the main and leading instrument were to become Sunrise Black\u2019s trademarks.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the band collaborated with keyboardist \u0141ukasz Radecki (in 2009) and drummer Bartosz Borzeszkowski (in 2011), who didn\u2019t become full-fledged members. In late 2011 the project\u2019s line up was completed by multi-instrumentalist Pawe\u0142 \u201cFiosaiche\u201d Kucypera, who properly fitted the band\u2019s music esthetics.

Fischoff and\u00a0fellow members of the South Bend Chamber Music Society sought an innovative way of encouraging young people to pursue chamber music study and performance.\u00a0The idea of a competition arose, and that first year, six ensembles participated.\u00a0\n\nLittle did the society members know how their idea would grow.\u00a0Today, still at home in South Bend, Indiana, the Fischoff Competition is the largest chamber music competition in the nation and the world.\u00a0Each year, an average of 125 ensembles, representing 22 nationalities, enter in either the wind or string categories of three to six performers.\u00a0Fischoff is the only national chamber music competition with both senior divisions (ages 18-35) and a junior division (age 18 and younger). Since its founding, more than 6,600 musicians have participated, many of whom have gone on to distinguished careers in music performance and education.\n\nCommitted to music education, the Fischoff uniquely partners with competition alumni to bring free, innovative music programs directly to children in their own schools and community centers.\u00a0Known as the Fischoff Arts-in-Education Residency, these programs have served more than 61,600 community children since 1995 and reach more than 5,700 underserved and at-risk young people every year.\u00a0Additionally, Fischoff offers several programs to support and encourage area high school-aged musicians.\u00a0\n\n\nWebsite by Internet Business Solutions",

        "text":"A mixture of rock riffs and punk sensibilities, catchy hooks and melodic anthems, As A Rival are fast becoming one of the most hard-working, explosive live bands on the Australian punk rock scene. Continuing to deliver upon their unrelenting live shows, with precision and intent.\n\nComprising of Pete Cerni (vox\/guitar), Nathan Wheatley (drums\/vox) and Johnny Beech (guitar\/vox), 2016 saw the tech-punk outfit rise in stature releasing their debut album, \u2018By Design\u2019, supported by 2 national tours and gaining their first major support slot, playing at 170 Russell.\n\n2017 sees no change in pace as the juggernaut rolls on. Heading into the studio to record their 2nd album at \u2018The Studios In The City\u2019, produced by Tom Larkin (Shihad) & Sam Sproull. \u2018Griefers\u2019, tackles themes of betrayal, deceit and defiance and sees a maturity in song writing, fine-tuning their song craft into a driven, sonic deluge. From the gallop of lead single, \u2018Bring Out The Dead\u2019, to the hook of \u2018Atmosphere\u2019, the soar of \u2018Head in the Clouds\u2019 to the punk punch of \u2018Orbital\u2019, \u2018Griefers\u2019 is unrelenting from start to finish and shows a clear intent by the band launching head first into 2018.\n\nTheir debut album, By Design, recorded and co-produced by Tom Read (Bodyjar) and mixed by Grammy Award winning producer Adam Kasper (Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age), saw a coming of age in their songwriting, surpassing the promise and expectations built from previous releases, packed with energy and drive.\n\nDropping the music video for single \u2018Obsolete\u2019, a punk infused anthem that tackles fighting the reality of ageing and fear of irrelevance that comes with it. The clip was well received, achieving their debut appearance of ABC\u2019s RAGE music program, where it stayed on rotation for 5 straight weeks. By years end, As A Rival had played over 30 shows across 6 states around Australia, building upon their fan base and growing their live show reputation.\n\nBeginning from an accumulation of bedroom demos, the premise for As A Rival was to be challenged musically and become a rival to what was on offer. The year 2011 saw the release of the Reminder Designer single, which was followed by the acclaimed Concerning Trends EP in 2013. Playing live is where the band feels most at home, touring across Australia, both metro and regional since their inception and stamping a claim as one of Australia\u2019s most entertaining live bands.\n\nAs A Rival will make their return February 2018 playing shows across Australia as they celebrate the release of their latest single, 'Bring Out The Dead'\n\nAs A Rival Facebook As A Rival Twitter As A Rival Instagram As A Rival YouTube As A Rival iTunes As A Rival BandCamp As A Rival Soundcloud\nAs A Rival Obsolete Tour\n\nAs A Rival Merch\n\nAs A Rival \u00a9 2013.
