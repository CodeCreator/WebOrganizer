We gather annually to build the relationships, leadership practices, ideas and inspiration we need to transform ourselves, our organisations and the systems in which we operate.\n\nThe Performance Theatre Foundation is a non-profit foundation headquartered in Oslo, Norway.

        "text":"About Us\n\nPretending to be at the Oscars\nBill and Carol\n\nBill and Carol Cote ARE BC Studio. We welcome folks into our studio as if it were our home\u2026which it is. But its also a professional space which is a full service video production studio. Bill, previously managed Studio 39 on East 39th Street and has over 30 years experience in film and video production. Seen above are Bill and Carol, pretending to be at the Oscars. Isn\u2019t green screen wonderful?\n\nOur space is perfect for all types of projects including interviews, feature films, documentaries, product demonstrations and even cooking demonstrations in the working kitchen. We believe your shoot should be conducted in a comfortable environment. Our\u00a0sound stage has been used to great effect from hosting cable shows, to fairly large room sets. We are conveniently located in the Chelsea neighborhood, near Penn Station, B+H Photo and Adoroma Camera rental. Clients often take advantage of the many props at hand, including our couches, lamps, dinning room table and chairs, drapes, books, vases and many other items to create a homey, lived-in look, and not just a plain white room.\n\nGreen screen studio services may include:\n\n\u25cf Interviews\u2014Green screen is a great background for compositing images, but we also offer a selection of seamless backdrops in popular colors like white, black, light grey and dark grey. The widows can be used as natural light, or completely blacked out with floor-to-ceiling sound blankets available as part of the sound-stage package. We feel a sound stage should be quiet, so In addition to the sound blankets, a large grey curtain\u00a0can enclose the shooting area around the green screen set, for even more sound control.\n\n\u25cf Still Shoots\u2014Many photographers have utilized BC Green Screen Studio for their still shoots,\u00a0using green screen as well as traditional backgrounds. Recently a clothing catalogue was photographed with models standing in front of our workbench: an antique oak piece with toolbox and hand tools spread out to create a realistic environment. Its even possible to get a long, telephoto compression shot (which I love) by moving the camera back 25 feet or more!\n\n\u25cf Television\u2014Several television pilots have been taped at our green screen facility, and a few shows for Bravo have created a standing set for weekly taping sessions. Anything is possible at BC Green Screen Studio.\n\nThere is no limit to the wonders that green screen videography can achieve. Ask how we can help on your next project. Our video studio \/ sound stage is in Manhattan, in the Chelsea district in West Midtown. Contact today to book your time with us.",

From day one, we\u2019ve fought to tear down the walls erected by the music industry. And we won. Each day, we strive to give independent artists and labels access to the marketplace so they can compete on equal footing and build the lives they deserve.\n\nOur mission is to be heroes for DIY musicians and independent record labels around the world. We want to make it easy for everyone to sell, manage, protect, and monetize their music. If you\u2019re financially sustainable, you\u2019ll make more music. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nmusic startup in brainstorming session\n\n\nTeam Members\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Members\n\nBy musicians, for musicians\n\n20 years ago, we were electronic musicians starting our own record label. After finding our own way as artists, we founded iMusician to help our friends easily maneuver the music industry. Over the last 20 years, we fought for artists\u2019 rights and our dream evolved into a thriving community of more than 200,000 DIY artists and independent record labels.\n\nOur evolution happened as physical record sales were plummeting and digital stores and streaming platforms started to pop up. We grew with it, and now we\u2019re well equipped to navigate the music industry and whatever comes next.\n\n\nAs successful artist Greed, Tobi Wirz founds dance music imprint SOGrecords at the height of the Progressive House craze.\n\n\nIn the US, industry sales of CDs peak with 942.5 million units sold. (source)\n\n\nShigs Amemiya joins SOGrecords as a label manager.\n\n\nFrom a windowless attic studio, SOGrecords doubles output and branches into publishing, booking, and management. Apple launches iTunes store; Beatport opens digital store focused on dance music.\n\n\nYouTube, Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music spring up.\n\n\nShigs Amemiya and Tobias Wirz launch iMusician in English, French, and German to give independent artists and labels equal access. Majors start blocking iMD from The Official Swiss Charts.\n\n\niMusician leads a class action \"anti-competition case\" against the IFPI and the Majors in Switzerland. In 2012, we win, with the court forcing the IFPI to open the charts to all independents.\n\n\niMusician jumps from 10,000 to 25,000 members, rolls out YouTube Monetization, launches in Spanish and Italian, and opens an office in Berlin, Germany.\n\n\niMusician launches in Brazil and Portugal, quietly reaches 100,000 members. CD sales hit all-time low with only 46.5 million units sold globally. In the US, streaming takes 80% of digital sales.\n\n\niMusician reaches 200,000 members and launches Instant Mastering.\n\nOur values\n\nWe grow with you\n\nWe know that it\u2019s hard for musicians to find the information and access they need; the music industry creates veils of mystery. But we want to help you move forward. It doesn\u2019t matter if you went to Music School or have an MBA; anyone can have a successful and sustainable music career.\n\nWe walk the walk\n\nWe know that financial sustainability in the music doesn\u2019t happen overnight; dreams are paved with a lot of hard work and consistent steps towards goals, one release at a time. We want to help artists and labels meet their goals by giving them solutions they can use every day and advice they can apply towards their own path. We are solution-oriented, aware of the changes that have happened to the industry, and offer realistic and up-to-date advice.\n\nWe cut the hype\n\nWe know that the music industry uses hype to create illusion, fantasy, dreams, and failure. We lift the veils to give musicians what they need to make a living from their music. Our team is made up of musicians, record labels managers, DJs, tour managers, and more. We use this experience to create services that make it easier for DIY musicians and independent labels can use to build a sustainable business.\n\nWe are a global community\n\nAt iMusician, we believe in the power of a unified global community. We share our knowledge so that we can lift each other up. We\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs and only want the very best for one another.\n\nWe\u2019re one of you\n\nWe\u2019re a team of DIY musicians and label owners. It\u2019s a part of us and in our DNA. We\u2019re a part of the same community and understand the obstacles and problems that musicians face every day.
