        "text":"What to expect\n\nScheduling Your Session\n\nI recommend that you schedule your newborn session PRIOR to your baby\u2019s birth to ensure a spot on the calendar. Contact me during your second trimester and I\u2019ll pencil you in. Then, contact me via email (charmariephotography@gmail.com) or call 704-454-2367 soon after you deliver so we can arrange a time for the session. The BEST time is between 6-21 days after baby\u2019s arrival. I'll be moving them around and scrunching them into those sweet sleepy newborn images, so I want to make sure they\u2019re sleepy enough to allow me to handle them. If you have a baby boy, I recommend scheduling the session before circumcision, or 5 days afterwards.\n\nWhere Will the Session Take Place?\n\nNewborn sessions are typically taken at my home studio in Charlotte, NC. All the props are easily assessable, I can keep the room warm enough for our session, and everything is set up and ready to go! However, in-home sessions are available at an additional charge of $100.00.\n\nPreparing for Your Session\n\nWe want a sleepy baby to get those cute newborn poses. We\u2019ll want to do everything possible to help the baby sleep.\n\nBelow are some suggestions:\n\nInteract with your baby to try to keep him\/her awake 1-2 hours before our session. It\u2019s ideal to schedule the baby\u2019s feeding about 2-3 hours before arriving so they can feed again just before the session starts. A tired baby with a full tummy is a very sleepy, cooperative baby! If baby is bottle feeding, please bring extra bottles and milk (formula or breast milk). For nursing Moms, be careful with what you eat for about a day leading up to the session. Spicy foods can make the baby uncomfortable or upset their tummy. The studio will be very warm. Babies are very sensitive and because some poses will be in the nude, it\u2019s best to keep them comfortable. The room temperature will be 80+ degrees to keep the baby happy. I suggest that parents come to the session dressed in layers so that they can comfortably remove some clothing if they feel the room is too warm. Baby should have on loose clothing that won\u2019t leave marks in the skin, their diaper should also be on loosely and no socks so it doesn\u2019t leave wrinkles in the skin.\n\n\nNewborn sessions can last anywhere from 2-3 hours. It all depends on baby\u2019s mood and willingness to sleep. A newborn session is nothing like a regular session. It can take up to twenty minutes or more to pose a newborn into a certain position. I will try to get as many photos as I can with the diaper on but some outfits are best with diaper off (less bulky). It is entirely normal and natural for your baby to urinate or have bowel movements during the photo session. Please do not feel embarrassed or feel inclined to \u201crush in\u201d and clean up. I have precautions in place (and lots of wet wipes). It is our job to take care of this. It is your job to sit back, relax, and have a nice time. I will work through a certain amount of set and prop changes. I have lots of ideas and are always flexible based on the personality and demeanor of your newborn.\n\n\nI have a collection of bowls, baskets, blankets, knit hats and headbands that we can use for our session. You are also welcome to use any of your own props. Looks for items with texture and color to help make your images unique. \u00a0If you have any family heirlooms, toys, hats, props, etc. that you would like me to use be sure bring them to your session.\u00a0 We may not get the chance to use ALL the items, but we\u2019ll look through them with you to determine what will work best.\n\n\u00a0What to Wear\n\nSolid, neutral colors photograph best. For parent pictures, a neutral bone color backdrop, gray, or black is typically used. To keep the portraits elegant and classy it is recommended that you choose color tones that are neutral.\u00a0 Simple black or white shirts or earthy tones will work best.\u00a0 This also goes for siblings. Try to stay away from bright colors and any logos on shirts. Also, bring an extra set of clothes for yourself since it is normal and natural for your baby to urinate or have bowel movements during the photo session, this could possibly happen on you.\n\n\nThe safety of your newborn is the most important thing to me. I am willing to make any accommodations for your baby that may be necessary for its safety and well-being. If you have any special needs, please feel free to talk to me about them when booking your session and I will be sure to do my best to accommodate. Thankfully, I can provide stunning and creative photos of your newborn while being sure that both you and your newborn are comfortable and safe the whole time.\n\nThank you for trusting me to capture these memories for you!",
