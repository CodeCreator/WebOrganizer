        "text":"The Legislative Branch\n\nEstablished by Article I of the Constitution, the Legislative Branch consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which together form the United States Congress. The Constitution grants Congress the sole authority to enact legislation and declare war, the right to confirm or reject many Presidential appointments, and substantial investigative powers.\n\nThe House of Representatives is made up of 435 elected members, divided among the 50 states in proportion to their total population. In addition, there are 6 non-voting members, representing the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and four other territories of the United States. The presiding officer of the chamber is the Speaker of the House, elected by the Representatives. He or she is third in the line of succession to the Presidency.\n\nMembers of the House are elected every two years and must be 25 years of age, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and a resident of the state (but not necessarily the district) they represent.\n\nThe House has several powers assigned exclusively to it, including the power to initiate revenue bills, impeach federal officials, and elect the President in the case of an electoral college tie.\n\nThe Senate is composed of 100 Senators, 2 for each state. Until the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913, Senators were chosen by state legislatures, not by popular vote. Since then, they have been elected to six-year terms by the people of each state. Senator's terms are staggered so that about one-third of the Senate is up for reelection every two years. Senators must be 30 years of age, U.S. citizens for at least nine years, and residents of the state they represent.\n\nThe Vice President of the United States serves as President of the Senate and may cast the decisive vote in the event of a tie in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate has the sole power to confirm those of the President's appointments that require consent, and to ratify treaties. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule: the House must also approve appointments to the Vice Presidency and any treaty that involves foreign trade. The Senate also tries impeachment cases for federal officials referred to it by the House.\n\nIn order to pass legislation and send it to the President for his signature, both the House and the Senate must pass the same bill by majority vote. If the President vetoes a bill, they may override his veto by passing the bill again in each chamber with at least two-thirds of each body voting in favor.\n\nThe Legislative Process\n\nThe first step in the legislative process is the introduction of a bill to Congress. Anyone can write it, but only members of Congress can introduce legislation. Some important bills are traditionally introduced at the request of the President, such as the annual federal budget. During the legislative process, however, the initial bill can undergo drastic changes.\n\nAfter being introduced, a bill is referred to the appropriate committee for review. There are 17 Senate committees, with 70 subcommittees, and 23 House committees, with 104 subcommittees. The committees are not set in stone, but change in number and form with each new Congress as required for the efficient consideration of legislation. Each committee oversees a specific policy area, and the subcommittees take on more specialized policy areas. For example, the House Committee on Ways and Means includes subcommittees on Social Security and Trade.\n\nA bill is first considered in a subcommittee, where it may be accepted, amended, or rejected entirely. If the members of the subcommittee agree to move a bill forward, it is reported to the full committee, where the process is repeated again. Throughout this stage of the process, the committees and subcommittees call hearings to investigate the merits and flaws of the bill. They invite experts, advocates, and opponents to appear before the committee and provide testimony, and can compel people to appear using subpoena power if necessary.\n\nIf the full committee votes to approve the bill, it is reported to the floor of the House or Senate, and the majority party leadership decides when to place the bill on the calendar for consideration. If a bill is particularly pressing, it may be considered right away. Others may wait for months or never be scheduled at all.\n\nWhen the bill comes up for consideration, the House has a very structured debate process. Each member who wishes to speak only has a few minutes, and the number and kind of amendments are usually limited. In the Senate, debate on most bills is unlimited \u2014 Senators may speak to issues other than the bill under consideration during their speeches, and any amendment can be introduced. Senators can use this to filibuster bills under consideration, a procedure by which a Senator delays a vote on a bill \u2014 and by extension its passage \u2014 by refusing to stand down. A supermajority of 60 Senators can break a filibuster by invoking cloture, or\n\nthe cession of debate on the bill, and forcing a vote. Once debate is over, the votes of a simple majority passes the bill.\n\nA bill must pass both houses of Congress before it goes to the President for consideration. Though the Constitution requires that the two bills have the exact same wording, this rarely happens in practice. To bring the bills into alignment, a Conference Committee is convened, consisting of members from both chambers. The members of the committee produce a conference report, intended as the final version of the bill. Each chamber then votes again to approve the conference report. Depending on where the bill originated, the final text is then enrolled by either the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate, and presented to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate for their signatures. The bill is then sent to the President.\n\nWhen receiving a bill from Congress, the President has several options. If the President agrees substantially with the bill, he or she may sign it into law, and the bill is then printed in the Statutes at Large. If the President believes the law to be bad policy, he may veto it and send it back to Congress. Congress may override the veto with a two-thirds vote of each chamber, at which point the bill becomes law and is printed.\n\nThere are two other options that the President may exercise. If Congress is in session and the President takes no action within 10 days, the bill becomes law. If Congress adjourns before 10 days are up and the President takes no action, then the bill dies and Congress may not vote to override. This is called a pocket veto, and if Congress still wants to pass the legislation, they must begin the entire process anew.\n\nPowers of Congress\n\nCongress, as one of the three coequal branches of government, is ascribed significant powers by the Constitution. All legislative power in the government is vested in Congress, meaning that it is the only part of the government that can make new laws or change existing laws. Executive Branch agencies issue regulations with the full force of law, but these are only under the authority of laws enacted by Congress. The President may veto bills Congress passes, but Congress may also override a veto by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nArticle I of the Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress and the specific areas in which it may legislate. Congress is also empowered to enact laws deemed \"necessary and proper\" for the execution of the powers given to any part of the government under the Constitution.\n\nPart of Congress's exercise of legislative authority is the establishment of an annual budget for the government. To this end, Congress levies taxes and tariffs to provide funding for essential government services. If enough money cannot be raised to fund the government, then Congress may also authorize borrowing to make up the difference. Congress can also mandate spending on specific items: legislatively directed spending, commonly known as \"earmarks,\" specifies funds for a particular project, rather than for a government agency.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress have extensive investigative powers, and may compel the production of evidence or testimony toward whatever end they deem necessary. Members of Congress spend much of their time holding hearings and investigations in committee. Refusal to cooperate with a Congressional subpoena can result in charges of contempt of Congress, which could result in a prison term.\n\nThe Senate maintains several powers to itself: It ratifies treaties by a two-thirds supermajority vote and confirms the appointments of the President by a majority vote. The consent of the House of Representatives is also necessary for the ratification of trade agreements and the confirmation of the Vice President.\n\nCongress also holds the sole power to declare war.\n\nGovernment Oversight\n\nOversight of the executive branch is an important Congressional check on the President's power and a balance against his discretion in implementing laws and making regulations.\n\nA major way that Congress conducts oversight is through hearings. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs are both devoted to overseeing and reforming government operations, and each committee conducts oversight in its policy area.\n\nCongress also maintains an investigative organization, the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Founded in 1921 as the General Accounting Office, its original mission was to audit the budgets and financial statements sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Today, the GAO audits and generates reports on every aspect of the government, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent with the effectiveness and efficiency that the American people deserve.\n\nThe executive branch also polices itself: ...

        "text":"Traian B\u0103sescu Biography\n\nPresident of Romania\n\nBorn November 4, 1951, in Basarabi, Romania; married Maria. Education: Graduated from the Navy Institute of Constan[H6031]a, 1976.\n\nAddresses: Office \u2014Palatul Cotroceni, Strada Geniului nr. 1-3, Sector 5\u2014Bucuresti, Romania 060116.\n\n\nMerchant marine officer, Navrom, 1976-81; oil tanker captain, Navrom, 1981-87; headed the Navrom office in Antwerp, Belgium, 1987-89; general manager of the State Inspectorate for the Civil Navigation within the Romanian Ministry of Transportation, 1989-90; Undersecretary of State, Chief of the Shipping Department within the Ministry of Transportation, 1990-91; elected to Romanian parliament on the Democratic Party ticket, 1992; transportation minister, 1991-92, and 1996-2000; elected mayor of Bucharest, 2000; elected president of Romania on the Alian[H6031]a DA slate, December, 2004.\n\n\nIn a surprising turn of political events, Traian Ba\u0208sescu became president of Romania in December of 2004. Romanians and international observers alike declared his victory a sign of the genuine end of Romania's communist era some 15 years after what turned out to be its merely symbolic finish back in 1989. While the Eastern European nation's human-rights record had improved considerably in the interim, the political life in this nation of 23 million continued to be dominated by the former Communists,\n\nmunists, who led new political parties. Ba\u0208sescu rose to prominence as an opponent of the corruption and cronyism of that post-Communist aftermath.\n\nBorn in November of 1951, Ba\u0208sescu spent his earliest years in a village called Basarabi, not far from Constan[H6031]a, Romania's Black Sea port. He graduated from the Navy Institute of Constan[H6031]a in 1976, and joined Navrom, the state-owned shipping company, as a merchant marine officer. Romania during the first four decades of Ba\u0208sescu's life was a tightly controlled socialist state under longtime president Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu, in power since 1965. The Romanian Communist Party (PCR) dominated life in the country, which enjoyed a relatively high standard of living until the 1980s, when Ceau\u015fescu's grandiose building projects resulted in drastic food rationing rules and fuel shortages.\n\nBa\u0208sescu joined the PCR, a move essential for any career advancement in Romania during the Ceau\u015f-escu era. He spent five years as an officer, and in 1981 was made captain of an oil tanker, the Birun [H6031] a , that was the largest vessel in the Romanian fleet. In 1987, he was posted to Antwerp, Belgium, to run Navrom's foreign office in this North Sea-linked port city. He remained there until year that the Ceau\u015fescu regime came to a violent 1989, the same year that the Ceausescu regime came to a violent but relatively swift end: in December of that year, the army fired on protesters in Timi\u015foara, and Ceau\u015fescu condemned the uprising as the work of foreign agents. A planned pro-Ceau\u015fescu demonstration in Bucharest quickly erupted into an anti-government one; the military and Securitate (secret police) abandoned Ceau\u015fescu, who was executed with his wife after a sham trial on Christmas Day.\n\nA new political organization, the Frontul Salva\u0208rii Na[H6031]ionale (National Salvation Front, or FSN), arose to fill the power vacuum, and Ba\u0208sescu soon joined it. During that first year, he held a management position in the Romanian Ministry of Transportation, and in 1990 was named undersecretary of state in the Ministry's shipping department. In 1992, the FSN split in two, and one of the parties that came out of its ashes was the Social Democratic Party (PSD) of Romania. The PSD was led by Ion Iliescu, a high-ranking Communist official who had fallen out with the Ceau\u015fescu regime some years earlier. Ba\u0208sescu joined the other party that emerged from the split, the Democratic Party (PD) of Romania. In 1991 he became the country's Minister of Transportation, but it was a time when Romania was busy selling off its merchant fleet, and there were charges that Ba\u0208sescu may have personally benefited from the sales he helped to arrange. He served in the cabinet until 1992, but was elected to Romania's parliament that same year.\n\nThe Dosarul Flota (Fleet Affair) became an increasingly prominent story in Romania's press in the mid-1990s, and an official investigation began. Ba\u0208sescu took the unusual step of formally renouncing his parliamentary immunity in 1996. This meant that he could be fully investigated for his former role as Minister of Transportation, and was a clear effort to vindicate his name before the public. He was the first member of Romania's parliament ever to renounce his immunity. Re-elected that same year, he was named Minister for Transportation once again, a cabinet post he held for the next four years. In 2000, he entered the Bucharest mayor's race, and won by a narrow margin. He went on to achieve a number of notable reforms within the capital city, and improve the standard of living for its two million residents over the next four years. One of the city's more bizarre problems was a large stray-dog population that was estimated to be at least 150, 000 and perhaps as high as 300, 000 when he took office; some 1, 500 dog bites were reported daily. Ba\u0208sescu enacted strong measures to reduce the population, but animal-rights activists, including 1950s French film star Brigitte Bardot, objected; he dismissed their complaints with the retort, \"I am elected by the people of Bucharest, not the dogs, \" according to Times correspondent Adam LeBor.\n\nBa\u0208sescu was elected his party's president in 2001, and two years later was instrumental in forming the Alian [H6031] aDA (Justice and Truth Alliance) with another of Romania's political parties to oppose the PSD, which had been in power for much of the post-Communist era but was largely made up of former Communist elites. In 2004, he became the presidential candidate on the Alian[H6031]a DA ticket, and ran a campaign that urged voters to oust the former Communists. In the run-up to the election, Ba\u0208sescu lagged in opinion polls, and his opponent Adrian Na\u0208stase\u2014PSD leader as well as incumbent prime minister\u2014took the first round of balloting. International observers, however, found multiple instances of vote fraud. A second round of voting was held on December 12 and judged by the monitors to have been more fairly conducted, and Ba\u0208sescu won the presidency.\n\nWith his victory at the polls, Ba\u0208sescu became the leader of the country's first genuinely truly non-Communist government since the World War II era. During his first months in office, he enacted a new flat tax in an attempt to curb Romania's thriving black-market economy, and met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President George W. Bush. With Romania scheduled to become a member of the European Union (EU) in 2007, there were several drastic reforms\u2014some in the realm of justice and human rights, others economic\u2014that the country would have to enact before formal entry into the EU, but Ba\u0208sescu reassured Romanians and the rest of the world that he was ready to lead. \"I've been the sea captain of large oil tankers, \" a Newsweek International report from Andrei Postelnicu and Michael Meyer quoted him as saying, \"and I always reach my destination.\"\n\n\n\nBusinessWeek , December 17, 2001, p. 4.\n\nGuardian (London, England), December 14, 2004, p. 13; December 15, 2004, p. 16.\n\nNew Statesman , January 31, 2005, p. 11.\n\nNewsweek International , March 21, 2005, p. 20.\n\nTimes (London, England), December 14, 2004, p. 26.\n\n\n\"Biography: Traian Ba\u0208sescu, \" President of Romania,\u2026id= 4\u2026lang=en (October 12, 2005).\n\nCarol Brennan\n\nUser Contributions:\n\nComment about this article, ask questions, or add new information about this topic:",

Before its approval,\u00a0the Plan was submitted for public consultations, which involved non-governmental organizations promoting the role of women in the security sector.\u00a0With the adoption of the NAP, Poland joined the group of more than 80 countries who actively participate in the implementation of the ten resolutions and the WPS Agenda.\u00a0\n\nThe Polish National Implementation Plan\u00a0sets a conceptual framework\u00a0for the implementation of the provisions of ten UN Security Council resolutions\u00a0on WPS. The main postulates presented in the Plan are as follows: the need to increase women\u2019s participation in peace processes and in missions and peacekeeping operations, greater involvement of women in decision-making processes related to peace,\u00a0as well as the\u00a0protection and support for women and children\u00a0during and after armed conflict.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Plan sets four main outcomes for the years 2018-2021:\u00a0\n\n  1. Meaningful participation of women in conflict prevention and peacekeeping;\u00a0\n  2. Implementation of the WPS\u00a0agenda through the Polish humanitarian and development aid;\u00a0\n  3. Protection and support of the victims of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence;\u00a0\n  4. Promotion and development of the WPS agenda in Poland and in the framework of international cooperation.\u00a0\n\nThe implementation of the objectives of the NAP is carried out in 18 areas\u00a0that include inter alia: participation of women in missions and peacekeeping operations, increasing the share of women in uniformed formations\u00a0and foreign service,\u00a0support for victims of sexual violence in armed conflicts, training on the WPS agenda and\u00a0activities aiming at\u00a0involvement of Polish scientists and students\u00a0in the implementation of the agenda.\u00a0\n\nThe institutions implementing the NAP are\u00a0the Ministry of\u00a0Defence, Ministry of\u00a0the Interior and Administration, the National Police, the Border Guard, the Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration. They\u00a0are responsible for regular monitoring of the implementation progress and its annual evaluation within their ministries and services. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is tasked with coordinating the overall assessment of the implementation of the NAP.",

He continued by saying that the right to privacy and freedom of expression have become major themes with reference to private companies which control and operate on the Internet and the wider digital environment (see note 3). He also referred to a recent survey carried out by The Economist (see note 4) which highlighted that many businesses have started to view themselves as important actors in respecting human rights.\n\nWhile it is the task of governments to secure for everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, there is now wide recognition that businesses should respect human rights. This is confirmed by the Committee of Ministers in a Declaration in 2014 (see note 5) and a Recommendation in 2016 (see note 6).\n\nThe Internet enables the exercise of these rights and freedoms. At the same time, the fast pace of technological change coupled with the cross-border delivery of Internet service makes it a challenge to protect and enforce these rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, the Internet has also become an instrument of choice for terrorists spreading propaganda, the recruitment of terrorists and the development of terrorist operations. Cybercrime is rapidly increasing. There can be confusion regarding the choice of law and jurisdiction to apply when securing evidence in the cloud. More broadly, the protection of personal data and the right to privacy online are at odds with the very nature of the Internet which is to facilitate the free flow of data in an open environment. There are many other concerns, such as hate speech, abusive forms of expression online, and the blocking, filtering and takedown of Internet content a comparative law study on which has been commissioned by the Secretary General.\n\nConsidering these challenges, there is an important need for governments and Internet companies to meet and discuss these challenges and to see together what they should do to address them. The Council of Europe seeks to offer a unique setting to foster co-operation between governments and business in order to protect Internet users and promote the Internet as one trusted space for all.\n\n\n  1. For example no hate speech online, privacy, child safety, mass surveillance, trans-border data flows, cybersecurity, \u2018Internet of Things\u2019, law enforcement access to data across borders, human rights for Internet users.\n  2. The Terms of Service and Human Rights Project by the Center for Technology and Society at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas Law School in Rio de Janeiro developed a methodology to analyse the degree of protection of privacy, freedom of expression and due process offered by the Terms of Service (ToS) of a variety of online platforms. The standards identified as a basis for the methodology derive from existing international human rights documents, notably including the Council of Europe's Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users. The Project has analysed the policies of a corpus of 50 platforms in a pilot experience aimed at enhancing the methodology and identifying the main practices adopted by platform providers. Some of the main goals of the project are to: (i) trigger international debate on the role of online platforms\u2019 providers as cyber-regulators and fulfil their responsibility to respect human rights; (ii) produce evidence on the impact of ToS on individuals\u2019 human rights; and (iii) put forward concrete policy recommendations to enhance the respect of users\u2019 rights.\n  3.

The Conservatives were dumbfounded that Winston Churchill, held in such heroic status, had been so comprehensively rejected. It was generally felt that under Atlee, Labour offered a new Jerusalem of full employment, a National Health Service, a solution to the housing problem and the pursuit of Keynesian economic policies. The results were not announced until 26 July because votes had to be transported back to England from servicemen and women serving abroad.\n\nIn Leeds Labour gained Leeds Central, Leeds West and Leeds North East where Alice Bacon became the first woman to win a Parliamentary seat in the city. In Leeds South, Hugh Gaitskell, a future Labour Party leader, was elected. The Conservatives won only one seat and that the safe one of Leeds North. However, Osbert Peake\u2019s majority dropped from 16,844 to 128 and that after a recount. The declaration of the poll in the city, made from a specially erected platform in front of the Art Gallery, was witnessed by only about 500 people, mostly Labour supporters but later more gathered in front of the Town Hall steps to hear the victory speeches.",

        "text":"Federal Government\/Federal Power\n\nFor many on the left, the federal government is a (cautiously) trusted entity crucial to the well-being of Americans on many levels. From this perspective, the federal government deserves to have the power it needs to govern effectively and do the right thing. \u00a0For instance, if reducing carbon emissions is essential to the well-being of the planet, then the federal government needs the regulatory authority to regulate emissions in every state.\n\nFor many on both the right and the left, the federal government has come to be seen as a large, bloated entity that has long exceeded its appropriate constitutional role - e.g. regulate commerce with foreign nations and between States, immigration, coin money, declare war, raise an army, etc. Compared to this relatively small set of functions, conservatives see the federal government in its current stature and scope as leading to waste and illegitimate coercion that harms the economy and interferes with local communities.\n\nIndeed, most on the right see the gradual growth in the power of the federal government (apart from the military), and consequent reduction in the power of the states, as a violation of both the letter and spirit of the US Constitution. Many on the left also decry the ever-increasing size and power of the federal government (including the military), seeing in it one half of a dangerously anti-democratic crony capitalist collusion with Big Business. The libertarian right is particularly outraged by a long string of Supreme Court decisions throughout the 20th century which centralized power. \u00a0For instance, in Wickard v. Filburn (1942) the court decided that a farmer growing wheat on his own land for his own consumption constituted \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d on the grounds that he thereby reduced the demand for wheat nationally. \u00a0The right regards this as an illegitimate expansion of federal power.\n\nIssues such as marijuana legalization create strange bedfellows with respect to federalism. \u00a0Many progressives join with libertarians in supporting the right of states to craft their own policies. \u00a0Meanwhile conservatives often want to use the authority of the federal government to shut down state-level marijuana initiatives.\n\n\n\nMichael Strong\n\nThere is currently no content classified with this term.",

        "text":"\nReturn to the Article List Return to the Article List\n\nPolitical History\n\nIn 1960, British Prime Minister Sir Harold Macmillan, made the World famous \"Wind of Change\" declaration in which he acknowledged the inevitability of granting independence to all colonized people. Following this, the new Secretary of Colonies, Mr. Ian McLeod, convened the historical Lancaster House constitutional conference in London that was the first constitutional meeting to map out the future of Kenya.\n\nThe struggle for independence culminated in the Mau Mau uprising and labour movement protests. This led to the declaration of emergency in 1952 and the arrest of several leaders, including Jomo Kenyatta, who was later to become Kenya's first President.\n\nJomo Kenyatta was released from detention in 1961 and he joined the Kenya African National Union (KANU) in August, that year.\n\nIn February 1962, the second Lancaster House constitutional conference was held and chaired by Secretary of State for Colonies, Reginald Maulding. The conference created the Upper House or Senate to safeguard white settler interests and granting of independence modalities. The 41 Member Senate with limited powers occupied what is today the County Hall. The Lower House represented the people's voices.\n\nA general election was held between May 18 and May 25, 1963. KANU led by Mzee Jomo Kenyatta won against Ronald Ngala's KADU and the African People's Party led by Paul Ngei. On June 1, 1963 internal self-government was granted and the day came to be known as Madaraka day.\n\nOn December 12, 1963, Kenya attained independence (Uhuru) with Mzee Jomo Kenyatta as the first Prime Minister. The day was named Uhuru Day.\n\nOn December 12, 1964, Kenya became a Republic with Mzee Kenyatta as the first President, heading a cabinet of 18 Ministers. Uhuru day was renamed Jamhuri (Republic) Day.\n\nThe first Vice-President, Oginga Odinga, resigned on April 14, 1966 and formed the Kenya People's Union reintroducing the multiparty status. Joseph Anthony Murumbi, then Minister for Foreign Affairs succeeded Odinga as Vice-President on May 13, 1966.\n\nAt the end of 1966, the Upper House, or the Senate, and the Lower House or the House of Representatives, were amalgamated to form the National Assembly.\n\nMurumbi resigned as Vice-President and Daniel arap Moi was appointed to the post on January 3, 1967.\n\nThe third general elections were held on November 11, 1974 upon the dissolution of the second parliament on September 8, 1974.\n\nDuring the Third Parliament, a group of Members of Parliament popularly known as the \"change the constitution\" group, tried unsuccessfully to amend the Constitution so that the Vice-President would not automatically assume the Presidency on the death of the President.\n\nIt was seen by some observers as an attempt to prevent the then Vice-President Daniel arap Moi from assuming Presidency in the event of President Kenyatta's death.\n\nKenyatta died on 22nd August 1978 and was succeeded as President by Daniel Toroitich arap Moi who dissolved the Third Parliament on September 20, 1979. The subsequent general elections held on November 8, 1979, saw a half of the members of the Third Parliament lose their seats.\n\nKenya became a one party state by law in June 1982 during the fourth parliament, which was dissolved, on July 22, 1983. KANU then became the only legal political party.\n\nThe fifth general elections were conducted on September 26, 1983, and the Fifth Parliament was dissolved on February 5, 1988. Elections for the Sixth Parliament preceded by queue voting were held on March 21, 1988.\n\nThe Sixth Parliament was dissolved on October 28, 1992 and subsequent elections held in December 1992 ushered in Multi partyism after the repeal of section 2(a) and a volatile seventh parliament. In the December 29, 1992 elections, members of parliament were from the following political parties: KANU, the opposition Ford-Kenya, Democratic Party of Kenya, Kenya Social Congress, Kenya National Congress and the Party of Independent Candidates of Kenya.\n\nThe elections for the Eighth Parliament were held on December 29, 1997 and out of the 210 elected Members of Parliament and 12 nominated members, there was a margin of four seats between KANU and the combined opposition.\n\nMwai Kibaki was Moi's Vice-President between 1978 to 1988 and was succeeded by the late Dr. Josephat Karanja (1988-89), and Professor George Saitoti (1989 - August 2002). Musalia Mudavadi was appointed Vice-President in November 2002.\n\nThe eighth Parliament initiated in 2001 a comprehensive review of the constitution.\n\nPresident Moi retired on 30th December 2002 after having been in office for 24 years.\n\nPresident Mwai Kibaki took oath of office on the same day after his party, the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) won the elections.\n\nPost your comment\n\nYou must be registered to post comments.\n\nLogin or register for an account so you can leave your feedback.\n\nNo comments found!\n\nWhy not be the first to add a comment?",

The number of visitors and students visiting Canada has been steadily growing over the past several years, with an average of 6000 permanent resident visas issued to Algerians each year.

Canada and Algeria signed a Protocol of Understanding, paving the way for a new era of cooperation between the two countries. In addition, Canadian Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean travelled to Algeria in November 2006 as part of an African tour.\n\nAlgeria is a major regional player in the global fight against terrorism. Recognizing Algeria\u2019s unique role, Canada is committed to strengthening its cooperation with Algeria to work towards building a safe and secure region. In September 2011, Canada participated in an international conference hosted by Algeria to explore ways to improve cooperation to combat terrorism in the region. That same month, Algeria and Canada participated in the launch of the Global Counter Terrorism Forum (GCTF), within which the two states co-chair the Sahel Working Group.\n\nAlgeria has supported various international initiatives spearheaded by Canada. Algeria signed and ratified the\u00a0Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines, and has been active in promoting the New Economic Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), particularly within the African Peer Review Mechanism. Although not a member of La Francophonie, Algeria is the second largest French-speaking country in the world, and has participated in Francophonie summits, including the 2008 Quebec City Summit.\u00a0Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika also participated in the 2010 G8 summit in Muskoka in the context of the G8 Africa Partnership, and his representatives have played an active role in the G8 Africa Personal Representative Process (APR).\u00a0\n\nCanada is represented in Algeria by the\u00a0Embassy of Canada in Algiers, while Algeria is represented in Canada by an Embassy in Ottawa and a consulate in Montreal.\n\nCommercial Relations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCanada and Algeria enjoy a dynamic commercial relationship, with bilateral trade valued at C$3.7\u00a0billion in\u00a02013. The activities of Canadian companies doing business in Algeria span from basic foodstuffs to hydrocarbons to aeronautics. Algeria offers trade opportunities that merit Canada\u2019s interest in the infrastructure, education, aerospace and agricultural sectors. Algeria was the second largest supplier of crude oil to Canada in\u00a02013, and was Canada\u2019s 18th largest bilateral trading partner that same year. Canada and Algeria also share cultural and academic ties, including a range of research and teaching agreements between universities.\u00a0\n\nJune 2014\n\n* If you require a plug-in or a third-party software to view this file, please visit the alternative formats section of our help page .\n\n\nDate Modified:",

Journalists are prohibited from insulting the head of state or foreign leaders, and those charged with press offenses may be prosecuted in a special publications court.\n  \u2022 Most court cases launched against journalists in previous years were not pursued during 2008, and there were no developments in the appeal filed by Al-Mustaqbal editor in chief Tawfiq Khattab and staff reporter Fares Khashan; authorities had fined them 50 million pounds (US$33,000) each for libel and damaging the reputation of then president Emile Lahoud in 2006. In a positive move in November, a criminal court in Beirut dismissed slander charges against Muhamad Mugraby, a prominent lawyer and human rights activist. The charges stemmed from a speech he gave in 2003, in which criticized the government and condemned the use of torture to coerce confessions from suspects.\n  \u2022 The Directorate of General Security (SG) is authorized to censor all foreign magazines, books, and films before they are distributed, as well as pornography and political or religious material deemed a threat to the national security of either Lebanon or Syria. Throughout the year the SG banned or delayed the release of several films, including the Oscar-nominated Persepolis. The SG also tore two pages from the French newspaper Le Monde in October before allowing its distribution in Lebanon.\n  \u2022 Political violence continued to threaten journalists\u2019 safety, and impunity for past attacks contributed to intimidation and self-censorship among journalists. Particularly troubling were the events of May 2008, which included physical attacks on journalists and photographers, the forced cessation of both television and radio broadcasts, and the destruction of studio property. On May 9, for instance, fighters led by the Shiite Islamist group Hezbollah closed four media outlets affiliated with the Future Movement, part of the governing coalition. The radio station, daily newspaper, and two television stations were allowed to resume operations five days later.\n  \u2022 Lebanon hosts hundreds of periodicals and nearly a dozen daily newspapers. All national daily newspapers are privately owned, as are most television and radio stations, including six television and satellite stations and nearly three dozen radio stations. Access to satellite television has grown substantially over the last decade.\n  \u2022 Some 26.6 percent of the population regularly accesses the internet. The government did not restrict such access in 2008, and there were no reports of government monitoring of websites or e-mail. In January, four university students were jailed for one week without trial on charges of slander, libel, and public insult due to comments they posted on the social-networking site Facebook.",

Belgian politician who served as prime minister of Belgium (1999\u20132008).\n\nVerhofstadt received his law degree in 1975 and practiced law in Ghent, Belg. At that time he also became active in the Association of Liberal Flemish Students. In 1979 he was elected president of the youth section of the Flemish Liberal Party (PVV). In 1982 he was elected president of the PVV with 85 percent of the vote. At age 29, he became the youngest president of a political party in Belgian history.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1988 he served as vice prime minister and minister of budget in the coalition government of Christian Democrat Wilifried Marten. In 1991 Verhofstadt changed the name of the PVV to the Liberal and Democratic Flemish Party (VLD) in hopes of attracting more centrist voters. In 1997 he was reelected as president of the VLD. In elections in 1999 the VLD defeated Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene\u2019s centre-left coalition, and Verhofstadt became the first liberal prime minister of Belgium in 61 years. Verhofstadt was reelected in 2003. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to replace Romano Prodi as president of the European Commission in 2004. Under Verhofstadt\u2019s government Belgium legalized same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and the private use of marijuana.\n\nIn elections in June 2007 Verhofstadt\u2019s party was defeated by the Christian Democrats, led by Yves Leterme. For the next six months Verhofstadt served as caretaker prime minister while Leterme tried unsuccessfully to form a governing coalition. In December, Belgium\u2019s King Albert II asked Verhofstadt to form an interim government to restore political stability to the country.

He also is known for serving as editor of the scholarly journal Journal of Palestine Studies.\n\nFamily, education and career\n\nKhalidi was born in New York City, New York. Khalidi is the son of Ismail Khalidi and the nephew of Husayin al-Khalidi.[2] He is the father of playwright Ismail Khalidi and activist\/attorney, Dima Khalidi. He grew up in New York City, where his father, a Saudi citizen[2] of Palestinian origins who was born in Jerusalem,[3] worked for the United Nations.[2][4] Khalidi's mother, a Lebanese-American born in the United States, was an interior decorator. Khalidi attended the United Nations International School.[3]\n\nIn 1970, Khalidi received a B.A. from Yale University,[5] where he was a member of the Wolf's Head Society.[6] He then received a D. Phil. from Oxford University in 1974.[1] Between 1976 and 1983, Khalidi \"was teaching full time as an Assistant Professor in the Political Studies and Public Administration Dept. at the American University of Beirut, published two books and several articles, and also was a research fellow at the independent Institute for Palestine Studies\".[7] He has also taught at the Lebanese University.[5]\n\nKhalidi became politically active in Beirut, where he resided through the 1982 Lebanon War. \"I was deeply involved in politics in Beirut\" in the 1970s, he said in an interview.[8] Khalidi was cited in the media during this period, sometimes as an official with the Palestinian News Service, Wafa, or directly with the Palestinian Liberation Organization.[9] However, Khalidi has denied that he was a PLO spokesman,[10] stating that he \"often spoke to journalists in Beirut, who usually cited me without attribution as a well-informed Palestinian source. If some misidentified me at the time, I am not aware of it.\"[7] Subsequently sources disagreed as to the nature or existence of Khalidi's official relationship with the organization.[11]\n\nReturning to America, Khalidi spent two years teaching at Columbia University before joining the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1987, where he spent eight years as a professor and director of both the Center for Middle Eastern Studies and the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago.[12] During the Gulf War, while teaching at Chicago, Khalidi emerged \"as one of the most influential commentators from within Middle Eastern Studies\".[13] In 2003 he joined the faculty of Columbia University, where he currently serves as the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies. He has also taught at Georgetown University.[5]\n\nKhalidi is married to Mona Khalidi, who is the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and the Assistant Director of Graduate Studies of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.[14] He is a member of the National Advisory Committee of the U.S. Interreligious Committee for Peace in the Middle East, which describes itself as \"a national organization of Jews, Christians and Muslims dedicated to dialogue, education and advocacy for peace based on the deepest teachings of the three religious traditions\".\n\nHe is member of the Board of Sponsors of The Palestine\u2013Israel Journal, a publication founded by Ziad Abuzayyad and Victor Cygielman, prominent Palestinian and Israeli journalists.[15] He is founding trustee of The Center for Palestine Research and Studies.[16] He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn October 2010, Khalidi delivered the annual Edward Said memorial lecture at the Palestine Center in Washington.[17]\n\nAcademic work\n\nKhalidi's research covers primarily the history of the modern Middle East. He focuses on the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean, with an eye to the emergence of various national identities and the role played by external powers in their development. He also researches the impact of the press on forming new senses of community, the role of education in the construction of political identity, and in the way narratives have developed over the past centuries in the region.[1][not in citation given] Michael C. Hudson, director of the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown, describes Khalidi as \"preeminent in his field\".[18] He served as president of the Middle East Studies Association of North America in 1994 and is currently the editor of the Journal of Palestine Studies.[19]\n\nMuch of Khalidi's scholarly work in the 1990s focused on the historical construction of nationalism in the Arab world. Drawing on the work of theorist Benedict Anderson who described nations as \"imagined communities\", he does not posit primordial national identities, but argues that these nations have legitimacy and rights. In Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness (1997), he places the emergence of Palestinian national identity in the context of Ottoman and British colonialism as well as the early Zionist effort in the Levant. Palestinian Identity won the Middle East Studies Association's top honor, the Albert Hourani Book Award as best book of 1997.[20]\n\nHis dating of the emergence of Palestinian nationalism to the early 20th century and his tracing of its contours provide a rejoinder to Israeli nationalist claims that Palestinians had no collective claims prior to the 1948 creation of Israel. His signature work, Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness (Columbia University Press, 1997), argues that Arabs living in Palestine began to regard themselves as a distinct people decades before 1948, \"and that the struggle against Zionism does not by itself sufficiently explain Palestinian nationalism\".[21]\n\nIn it, Khalidi also describes the late development, failings and internal divisions within the various elements of the Palestinian nationalist movement.\n\nIn Resurrecting Empire: Western Footprints and America's Perilous Path in the Middle East (2004), Khalidi takes readers on a historical tour of Western involvement in the Middle East, and argues that these interactions continue to have a colonialist nature that is both morally unacceptable and likely to backfire. Khalidi's book, Sowing Crisis, places the United States approach to the Middle East in historical context. He is sharply critical of U.S. policies during the Cold War, writing that Cold War policies \"formulated to oppose the Soviets, consistently undermined democracy and exacerbated tensions in the Middle East\".[22]\n\nKhalidi has written, \"It may seem hard to believe today, but for decades the United States was in fact a major patron, indeed in some respects the major patron, of earlier incarnations\" of radical, militant Islam, in order to use all possible resources in waging the Cold War. He adds, \"The Cold War was over, but its tragic sequels, its toxic debris, and its unexploded mines continued to cause great harm, in ways largely unrecognized in American discourse.\"[23]\n\nHistorian and Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren has stated that \"Khalidi is mainstream\" because \"the stream itself has changed. The criteria for scholarship have become very political.\"[24]\n\nPalestinian Identity\n\nPalestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness (1997), is Khalidi's most influential and most widely cited book. In Palestinian Identity, Khalidi demonstrates that a Palestinian national consciousness had it origins near the beginning of the twentieth century. Khalidi describes the Arab population of British Mandatory Palestine as having \"overlapping identities\", with some or many expressing loyalties to villages, regions, a projected nation of Palestine, an alternative of inclusion in a Greater Syria, an Arab national project, as well as to Islam.[25] Nevertheless, Palestinian Identity was the first to demonstrate substantive Palestinian nationalism in the early Mandatory period. Khalidi writes, \"Local patriotism could not yet be described as nation-state nationalism.\"[26]\n\nKhalidi emphasized in his work that the Palestinian identity had been fundamentally fluid and changing, woven from multiple \"narratives\" due to individual and family experiences. He described the identity as organically developed due to the challenges of peasants forced from their homes due to Zionist immigrant pressure, but with Palestinian nationalism also being far more complex than merely an anti-Zionist reaction. Praise for his book appeared in the journal Foreign Affairs, with reviewer William B. Quandt viewing the work as \"a major contribution to historical understanding of Palestinian nationalism.\"[27]\n\nKhalidi also documents active opposition by the Arab press to Zionism in the 1880s.[28]\n\nResponse to The Iron Cage\n\n\nIn a review of Khalidi's The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood, for Middle East Policy, Philip Wilcox praised \"Khalidi's brilliant inquiry into why Palestinians have failed to win a state of their own\" calling the book \"a welcome antidote to the propaganda and mythology that still dominate American discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\"[29] Writing in The Guardian, Ian Black said the book \"brilliantly ...

Street demonstrations quickly grew into a national revolutionary movement that in 18 days removed Mubarak and his National Democratic Party (NDP) from power. In the beginning of the uprising, mass demonstrations in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, and the occupation of Cairo's central Tahrir (Liberation) Square were met with repression and violence by police and supporters of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). But Egyptians broke through the wall of fear and fought back in street battles. On Jan. 27 the government shut down the Internet and mobile service providers complied with government requests to suspend service. Still the uprising continued, and the army made the decision ultimately not to act against the protesters. Mubarak's weak concessions --appointing intelligence Omar Suleiman as vice president on Jan. 29; installing a new cabinet on Jan. 31; conceding that he wouldn't run again for president nor would his son Gamal after he finished his term in Sept. 2011 -- failed to appease the Egyptian people\u2019s demands.

Bush submitted (as is customary for a president to do so) a budget request to the U.S. Congress for fiscal year (FY) 2009. It would amount to $3.1 trillion in federal spending, and trim spending on several domestic programs while eliminating others. In addition, his proposal would make permanent the tax cuts passed during his first term and increase defense spending by 5 percent.[1]\n\n\nFunding for the government is provided by Congress under Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution. This is the \"purse strings power\" and there are no exceptions to it. Absent appropriations made by law, no operations by the government may take place: government employees may not work without pay and those who would contract with the government may not \"volunteer\" their goods or services.\n\nFunding for government employees salaries and wages(including the President) is provided in \"one year\" funds which expire at the end of a fiscal year. While Congress may pass \"continuing resolutions\" providing some interim funding where appropriations are not timely enacted, in the absence of such continuing resolutions no government employee may work.\n\nCurrent status\n\nFY 2009 Appropriations Bills [2]\nAppropriations House Approvals Senate Approvals Conference Approvals Public Law\nCommittee Report Comm.

A prominent proto-fascist figure is Gabriele d'Annunzio, the Italian nationalist whose politics influenced Benito Mussolini and Italian Fascism. Proto-fascist political movements include the Italian Nationalist Association (ANI), the German National Association of Commercial Employees (DHV) and the German National People's Party (DNVP).\n\nPrecedence to modern fascism can be seen in the culture and government of older nations based heavily in high culture and law and order, such as the Roman Empire and the ancien regimes of Europe.\n\n\n\nDon't forget! that as one of our early users, you are eligible to receive the 1,000 point bonus as soon as you have created five (5) acceptable piglix.",
