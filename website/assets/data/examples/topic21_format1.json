Padres Game\n\nFrom Gregg Doyle @ CBS SPORTS:\n\nTwo items of note for which one can draw his one conclusion:\n\n1. Earlier in the game, Padres starter\u00a0Jason Marquis\u00a0threw one up and in on Dodgers starMatt Kemp.\n\n2. Greinke\u2019s pitch that hit Quentin came on a 3-2 count in a 2-1 game.\n\nMy conclusion is that there was no way that Greinke hit Quentin intentionally, nor do I think Marquis\u2019 pitch earlier had any ill intent.\n\nI now see people on Twitter saying there\u2019s history between Greinke and Quentin. Uh, that was the 116th time in Quentin\u2019s career he has been hit by a pitch. He led the majors in HBP each of the last two seasons. He has history with lots of people. Oh, and Greinke had hit him twice before Thursday night.

He took out Nico Rosberg, but he was the wrong driver. I think he would have preferred to have taken out Alonso or Hamilton\u2019. Berger said\n\nWritten by Formula One Addict\n\nOctober 28th, 2010 at 6:08 am\n\nKimi Raikonnen not keen to return to Formula One\n\n\nIn a style which almost reminds us of compatriot Mika Hakkinen\u2019s exit from formula one , Kimi Raikkonen too has hinted he doesn\u2019t want to get back into a formula one car. The Finn had joined the World Rally championship after leaving formula one last year.\n\nWhen asked about his return to formula one, he said :\n\n\u201cI would have the opportunity to go to F1, but I think I\u2019ve seen off that career.\u201d\n\nNow that is going to leave a lot of fans unhappy and disappointed. The statement shows that he is least bit enthusiastic about F1.\n\nIt was being rumoured that he would join Renault for the 2011 formula one season. Earlier he has raced with McLaren Mercedes and the Ferrari F1 team. Ferrari had last year released him 1 year prior to the expiry of his contract.\n\nWritten by Formula One Addict\n\nAugust 21st, 2010 at 12:10 pm\n\nFerrari extends Felipe Massa\u2019s contract till 2012\n\nleave a comment\n\n\nFerrari today announced that Felipe Massa\u2019s contract has been extended till the end of the 2012 formula one season. the Brazillian has been with the team for 10 seasons now.
