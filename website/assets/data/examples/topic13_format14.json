He is the author of \u201cGold Tried in the Fire: The Prophet TheaurauJohn Tany and the English Revolution\u201d (2007), as well as the co-editor of several collections of essays. Hessayon has also written extensively on a variety of early modern topics: anti-scripturism, book burning, communism, environmentalism, esotericism, extra-canonical texts, heresy, crypto-Jews, Judaizing, millenarianism, mysticism, prophecy and religious radicalism.\nSocial Contacts\n\nA Brief History of Women\u2019s Football\n\nWith the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in full swing, Ariel Hessayon reflects on women\u2019s surprisingly long involvement with football. While medieval girls and women played and were entertained by a variety of bat and ball games, the earliest specific association I know of comes from a mid-15th century poem. This was a satire by the prolific East Anglian monk John Lydgate. In it the poet enlarged...

English history is full of myths. That shouldn\u2019t surprise us, because a large part of modern English national identity is based on what we collectively believe happened in the past, rather than on what actually did\u2014at least, as far as we can tell. The job of historians becomes harder...

What historians chose to write about is often informed not just by their intellectual interests, but also by present-day concerns. Sometimes those connections are drawn subtly. But on occasion they are blatant. Whether it\u2019s the link between the study of women in the past and the...

Another game, another\u00a0bite. That\u2019s the allegation against Uruguayan Luis Suarez, anyway, who has been accused of sinking his teeth into an opposition player. For the\u00a0third\u00a0time. But a mid-game nibble on an Italian player\u2019s shoulder is nothing compared to football\u2019s...

With the FIFA World Cup underway, there are many out there who have no idea about the history of this long-loved sport. If you love football, you\u2019re probably only aware of its history from recent times. But football has a long, gruesomely violent and hugely interesting past. And so begins a tale of...

Since more than 20 years I have organised and participated in many national and international workshops and conferences (e.g. Vilnius, Gdansk, Bratislava, Krakow, Lille, Munich, Berlin, Potsdam, etc) according to these projects.\n\n  \u2022 Concrete challenges I am facing in my \u201cdealing with the past\u201d-related work:\n\n    The main challenge is to find contemporary ways of expressing the past and making it understandable for young people and for future generations. It is also important to preserve authentic relicts and remnants of this past without generating nostalgia. The understanding of the past should become an integrated part of present day life.\n\n  \u2022 My personal link to\/interest for the topic of \u201cdealing with difficult pasts\u201d:\n    In my opinion the understanding of the difficult past is vital for the understanding of actual developments here in Germany and in Europe., since Germany was divided due to the Nationalsocialistic period between 1933 and 1945. Elementary civil values like democracy and human rights can only be practised and renewed by understanding and analyzing this background. Besides that I am privately engaged since 20 years in the \u201cAssociation for the exploration of lives and works of German Jewish architects\u201d (Board member).",

        "text":"About Co Leis Thu?\n\nWhen Bill Lawson began to collect information of the families of the Outer Hebrides he was faced with the challenge of how to preserve the information he was gathering. There was also the problem of differentiating between the large numbers of persons of the same name. His solution was to begin a saturation coverage of all the families of the Islands, and to record them in family chart form.\n\nThe database he took was the 1851 census \u2013 the earliest reliable resource for all the islands \u2013 and use the data there to commence a family chart page for each family, each with a unique reference. Information from civil registers and later census returns was then added, with every marriage entry cross-referred to the wife\u2019s page.\n\nInformation from Church Registers and estate records was then used to take the trees farther back, and information from oral tradition used to enhance and in many cases correct the data, to take most family charts back to the 1750s, and many much farther.\n\nFor families who left the islands before 1851 similar charts has been constructed, but in most cases less information is available, although there may well be a cross-reference to a family chart in one of the emigration areas.\n\nSo far, between the Outer Hebrides and the main emigrant areas, Bill has compiled some 27000 family charts!\n\nA typical family chart will commence with the family in 1851, expanded sideways and backwards as far as possible, and brought down usually to the mid 1950s. How much information will appear on the chart will depend on how many male children the head of house in 1851 had, how many male children his sons had, etc, and whether they remained on the islands. (This is not a case of male chauvinism but recognition that it is in the male line that the surname is usually transmitted!) If children had their own households in 1851 the cross-reference will be shown, as in all cases of marriage within the islands.\n\nAll pages are in Bill Lawson\u2019s own handwriting, but how much is shown on a particular page depends, not on him, but on the extent of proliferation of the 1851 family!",

As many said: \"The only thing in the war that wasn't rationed was entertainment, and that's what Blackpool was all about.\"\n\nThe Day War Broke Out Death in Combat\nBeing Frightened Evacuees\nBest of Days Food\nBlack Market Propaganda\nBombing Strangers\nCall Up Work\n\n\n\nThe Day War Broke Out\n\nBeing Frightened\n\nBest of Days\n\nBlack Market\n\n\nCall Up\n\nDeath in Combat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm here to solve your problems.\n\nI'm an easy guy to work with, I enjoy what I do and give everything 100% effort, passion and commitment.\n\nAlan Howarth\n\nSubscribe to\nAlan Howarth's\n\nFollow Alan Howarth's Blog\n\nFollow Alan Howarth on Twitter\n\nAlan Howarth - happy producing corporate interviews on the Web & in the Real World\n\nAlan Howarth: Corporate Photographer, Corporate Video Producer and Corporate Writer based near Blackpool, Preston & Lancaster, Lancashire in the North West of the UK, I frequently work in Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham and I spend 50% of my time working in London. within the M25, I travel throughout the UK and often work in mainland Europe, with work published throughout the world.

Those were fine. I went in to research the line a bit further, and found some more information for you, as well.\n\nBy the way I noticed your maiden name is Hitchcock. I am related to the Hitchcocks of Farmington, Maine. (Richard Hitchcock was originally from Damariscotta, I think.)\nAdded by Tree Leaf on Mar 23, 2015 9:02 PM\nNancy Wilson Hainey\nPicture for Mary Ann Jones Ellis at Arvonia\nThank you so much for the wonderful picture you took of this headstone. I don't know how you did it, but it is much clearer and more legible than it is in person!\nAdded by Nancy Wilson Hainey on Mar 18, 2015 9:50 AM\nChris Z.\nDear Nancy,\nFirst I'd like to thank you and your husband for posting such valuable genealogical information and photos on Find A Grave. I am particularly amazed at some of the information I'm finding on the Clewell line. I just accessed your record for Abraham Clewell telling the story of the men bringing guns to the cemetery for fear of Indians. I was also viewing your record for Joseph Clewell which is extensive. It appears that your husband and I share the same ancestors. George Craft Clewell and Anna Marie Keuchle\/Keuchley are my 5th great-grandparents and Abraham and Joseph would be my 5th great uncles. Would you be willing to share your sources for some of your information such as the story about the fear of Indians at Abraham's funeral. I'm fascinated! I probably don't have nearly as much information to share with you, but I do have some and I'd be more than willing to share what I do have. Either way, thank you very much for not only compiling, but being so willing to share the fantastic information you have posted online. I can't wait to finish dinner and get back to searching thru your records! Sincerely, Christine Z.\nAdded by Chris Z. on Mar 04, 2015 6:06 PM\nRE: Musselman\nHi Nancy,\nYes, I am related. My Great-Grandmother was Gertrude Musselman Fox. Henry would have been her Great-Grandfather. I got on Ancestry and did some searching and it looks like most people have Henry's father as also a Henry born in Lancaster County in 1737. The older Henry was the brother of David Henry and Christian, both of who appear to have served in the Revolutionary War. I am originally from Kansas where several of the Musselman's moved to after the Civil War but Moved to Texas in high school and have been here since except for a couple of years in the army.\n\nTroy Jenkins\nGrand Prairie, TX\nAdded by troyj on Mar 04, 2015 4:33 PM\nPatricia R Delaney\nRE: Charles A. Donley \/ Lena Ladd\nMy grandmother was Anna Mina Goyen; her father William Frances 1850; grandfather was Frances Goyen III 1820 so we are related lets see, Thomas William and William Frances were brothers I believe. Thanks for all the genealogy work you have done and do. I love learning all the history; recently was able to add my great-grandfather on the Goyen\/Slattery branch that we have never known before.\nAdded by Patricia R Delaney on Mar 01, 2015 7:43 AM\n[View all messages...]\n\nPrivacy Statement and Terms of Service",

Aguilar, MD, is one of the few physicians outside the government ever permitted to examine the still-restricted photographs and X-rays taken during President Kennedy\u2019s autopsy.\u00a0 He has published widely on the medical evidence in professional journals, books and on-line.\u00a0 He has\u00a0 lectured before academic medical, academic medico-legal, and non-professional public audiences on the subject. He is currently Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology, U.C. San Francisco, and the head of ophthalmology and the Vice Chief of Staff at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco.\n\nTuesday, 15 October 1996 22:28\n\nThe Files Fiasco\n\nGary Aguilar details his unfortunate personal experience with the producer of a current video entitled \"The Murder of JFK: Confession of an Assassin\". Gary traces back its auspices to Joe West and the Roscoe White interlude that also purported to solve the case.\n\nThursday, 20 October 2016 23:38\n\nHoward Willens and The American Scholar\n\nThis essay on [Willens' and Mosk's] work for the Warren Commission they served on is more notable for what they omit from the official record than what they include, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\nWe here publish two letters written by Gary Aguilar and Cyril Wecht to the editors of the the journal of the Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners concerning the ludicrous claims made by PBS' program on the JFK assassination.\n\nFlip de Mey\u2019s well written and entertaining book makes valuable contributions. But in the end it must be said it is far from completely satisfactory. However, there is great material in the book and students are encouraged to read it, and then decide for themselves, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\n\n\nLine after line, paragraph after paragraph, page after page, McAdams trudges tirelessly onward, selectively using testimony to reach a particular conclusion. Though readers may find that it\u2019s perhaps a bit short on fact, and a tad thin on logic, JFK Assassination Logic more than compensates by being wonderfully long on misguided patriotism, concludes Gary Aguilar.\n\nNot only did neither [Gerald Posner nor Vincent Bugliosi] address Dr. Perry's inconsistencies, neither ever mentioned the official HSCA memo to counsel Robert Tanenbaum concerning the plausible explanation Mr. Gochenaur gave for the doctor's flip-flopping, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\nThe book's use also lies in demonstrating that it may not be possible for one person to fully master, or give a fair accounting of, this impossibly tangled mess of a case, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\n[Holland's] analysis ... is fated to be washed away under a tsunami of recent scholarship ... Rooted in documents declassified in the wake of the public's reaction to Oliver Stone's film JFK, academics and researchers have discovered that the real JFK, despite his considerable flaws, was worlds away from the hawkish clown of Holland's (and Cockburn's) imagination, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\nWhy Russo's work is viewed negatively by both the defenders and critics of the Warren Commission.\n\nFind Us On ...\n\n\nPlease publish modules in offcanvas position.",

I am currently working on a cultural history of modern France (a sort of companion to my book, The German Genius), which will be delivered to the publisher at the end of September 2020, and published \u2013 all being well \u2013 about a year after that. Meanwhile, here is a new feature for my website. If you have got in touch with me because you have read one or another of my books, the chances are that our interests overlap or coincide, in particular in regard to the history of ideas.\n\nTitles reviewed in this edition\n\n  \u2022 Things Come Together: Africans Achieving Greatness in the Twenty-First Century, by Robert Rotberg\n  \u2022 The Beauty and the Terror: An Alternative History of the Italian Renaissance, by Catherine Fletcher\n  \u2022 History Has Begun: The Birth of a New America, by Bruno Ma\u00e7\u00e3es\n  \u2022 Substate Dictatorship: Network, Loyalty, and Institutional Change in the Soviet Union, by Yoram Gorlizki and Oleg Khlevniuk\n  \u2022 Fire: A Very Short Introduction, by Andrew C.

He was united in marriage to Betty Jane Raymond on June 29, 1956, and to this union three sons were born. He retired from a career in auto body repair and dairy farming. He loved to hunt, fish and be with his family. His grandchildren will always have special memories of time spent with \"Pa Bill\". He was preceded in death by his parents. He is survived by his wife; one sister, Jo Jackson and husband, Howard Jr., of Marionville; one uncle, Rod Hilton and wife, Beverly, of Republic; one nephew, Alan Wolf, of Republic; sons, Tim and wife, Brenda, of Marionville, Greg and wife, Susie, of Hurley, Mark and wife, Naomi, of Hurley; grandchildren, Trisha Henry, David Henry and wife, Hannah, Adria Marcum and husband, Jason, Krista Henry, Alicia Henry, Jessica Flood and husband, Bobby, Austin Henry and Billy Henry; great-grandchildren, Bryceton Henry, Collin Henry, Dean Marcum, Olivia Marcum, Jace Henry and Landon Flood; and many other family members and friends. He was a member of Hurley Baptist Church. Funeral services will be 2 p.m. Friday, September 28, 2007, in the Hurley Baptist Church, with Revs. Jerry Wilson and Larry Winfree officiating under the direction of Meadors Funeral Home Republic.

Burns\nSarah McKee Dillon\nSarah \"Sally\" McKee Dillon Find A Grave Memorial# 28254947\n\nMarla, I am assuming that you are related to Sally. If so, would you please contact me as I was looking at her stone today that is posted on her Find A Grave page. This is deplorable.\n\nI would like to start a drive to replace this stone with a new one.\n\nAfter having done this before with other family members, I have found that the ones that lay flat on the ground last longer. Vandals can't knock it over which eliminates a lot of the problems. One of these can be purchased for less than $300.00.\n\nWould you be willing to assist me on a drive to collect funds for a new monument? Your help would be invaluable as I am sure you know more of the family members that I do.\n\nAdded by John V.

I'm down to cleaning and shooting the annex section and the photography end will be done. I talked to Jennifer and she said she isn't interested in Jackson anymore. I made a promise and I'll keep it.

Unfortunately, I cannot find Darius (or any other Nance family members) in the transcription in this cemetery. I am wondering if an error was made when Darius was placed in this cemetery. It is understandable because his wife is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Greene Co., MO. Good luck, Jenean\nAdded by Jenean Hamilton on Aug 03, 2014 12:36 PM\n[View all messages...]\n\nPrivacy Statement and Terms of Service",
