Thanks to Find a Grave I am able to plan my trips accordingly. As the National Chaplain for the Disabled American Veterans 1.2 million member organization, I like helping those who cannot visit their family members in person by taking pictures for them in the area in which I live. I post veteran memorials on Find a Grave to pay tribute to their service, a way of honoring them for the sacrifice made to this country. If you have more information to post to a memorial I have created, send it to me and I'll add it or I'll transfer the memorial page.

I can not see it, unless I have to rule out someone I have proved IS my ancestor- and we all know DNA knows, just not sure Ancestry has it right! Especially since from I understand, it only proves my female ancestors.\nBut since they say he is mine, I am researching him--- SO may I use your Pictures? I have gotten permission many times in the past- so I know it is OK, but just thought I would update my blanket permission!!

I have always loved Ireland, ever since I was four years old and learned a little about my geneology. I dreamed of someday visiting Ireland and used to spend hours pouring over maps and travel guides planning my perfect trip. In 1994, I was introduced to the SCA and found out that I could live the life of an Irish noblewoman. Sort of. This page reflects my interests and research into my Irish persona, Ciar inghean ui Fhothaidh, a 16th Irish woman from County Galway, as well as her various ancestresses of the same name. In other words, I am enamored with all the ages of Ireland and my research reflects that. Please visit my Projects page, to see the progress I have made on my Irish costumes.

It runs the National Monument dedicated to the memory of the of the divided city and the victims of Communist tyranny, the Open-Air-Exhibition with the Window of Remembrance on the former border strip along BernauerStrasse and the adjacent Documentation and Visitors Centre.\n\n  \u2022 Examples of concrete activities I have organized\/am organizing in the field of \u201cdealing with the past\u201d:\n\n    I am responsible for the extension of the Berlin Wall Memorial, and all related planning, construction, and financial management issues. Between 1996 and 2005 I was the planning and construction manager for the Memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin\u2019s centre. Since more than 20 years I have organised and participated in many national and international workshops and conferences (e.g. Vilnius, Gdansk, Bratislava, Krakow, Lille, Munich, Berlin, Potsdam, etc) according to these projects.\n\n  \u2022 Concrete challenges I am facing in my \u201cdealing with the past\u201d-related work:\n\n    The main challenge is to find contemporary ways of expressing the past and making it understandable for young people and for future generations. It is also important to preserve authentic relicts and remnants of this past without generating nostalgia. The understanding of the past should become an integrated part of present day life.\n\n  \u2022 My personal link to\/interest for the topic of \u201cdealing with difficult pasts\u201d:\n    In my opinion the understanding of the difficult past is vital for the understanding of actual developments here in Germany and in Europe., since Germany was divided due to the Nationalsocialistic period between 1933 and 1945. Elementary civil values like democracy and human rights can only be practised and renewed by understanding and analyzing this background. Besides that I am privately engaged since 20 years in the \u201cAssociation for the exploration of lives and works of German Jewish architects\u201d (Board member).",

Aguilar, MD, is one of the few physicians outside the government ever permitted to examine the still-restricted photographs and X-rays taken during President Kennedy\u2019s autopsy.\u00a0 He has published widely on the medical evidence in professional journals, books and on-line.\u00a0 He has\u00a0 lectured before academic medical, academic medico-legal, and non-professional public audiences on the subject. He is currently Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology, U.C. San Francisco, and the head of ophthalmology and the Vice Chief of Staff at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco.\n\nTuesday, 15 October 1996 22:28\n\nThe Files Fiasco\n\nGary Aguilar details his unfortunate personal experience with the producer of a current video entitled \"The Murder of JFK: Confession of an Assassin\". Gary traces back its auspices to Joe West and the Roscoe White interlude that also purported to solve the case.\n\nThursday, 20 October 2016 23:38\n\nHoward Willens and The American Scholar\n\nThis essay on [Willens' and Mosk's] work for the Warren Commission they served on is more notable for what they omit from the official record than what they include, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\nWe here publish two letters written by Gary Aguilar and Cyril Wecht to the editors of the the journal of the Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners concerning the ludicrous claims made by PBS' program on the JFK assassination.\n\nFlip de Mey\u2019s well written and entertaining book makes valuable contributions. But in the end it must be said it is far from completely satisfactory. However, there is great material in the book and students are encouraged to read it, and then decide for themselves, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\n\n\nLine after line, paragraph after paragraph, page after page, McAdams trudges tirelessly onward, selectively using testimony to reach a particular conclusion. Though readers may find that it\u2019s perhaps a bit short on fact, and a tad thin on logic, JFK Assassination Logic more than compensates by being wonderfully long on misguided patriotism, concludes Gary Aguilar.\n\nNot only did neither [Gerald Posner nor Vincent Bugliosi] address Dr. Perry's inconsistencies, neither ever mentioned the official HSCA memo to counsel Robert Tanenbaum concerning the plausible explanation Mr. Gochenaur gave for the doctor's flip-flopping, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\nThe book's use also lies in demonstrating that it may not be possible for one person to fully master, or give a fair accounting of, this impossibly tangled mess of a case, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\n[Holland's] analysis ... is fated to be washed away under a tsunami of recent scholarship ... Rooted in documents declassified in the wake of the public's reaction to Oliver Stone's film JFK, academics and researchers have discovered that the real JFK, despite his considerable flaws, was worlds away from the hawkish clown of Holland's (and Cockburn's) imagination, writes Gary Aguilar.\n\nWhy Russo's work is viewed negatively by both the defenders and critics of the Warren Commission.\n\nFind Us On ...\n\n\nPlease publish modules in offcanvas position.",
