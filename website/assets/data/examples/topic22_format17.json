Does anyone know what could be the issue?\n\nUsually the transmission needs to be rebuilt in that situation. It's a very common problem if that's the famous automatic overdrive transmsission. AOD I have had three trucks that have done that. It usually starts by shuttering when it shifts and than finally goes out. Sometimes the Lucas transmission treatment gives you a little more time, but it sounds too late for yours. From what I understand (mechanic told me) that when the overdrive goes out, it takes third gear with it. If you drive in hilly areas, that overdrive is shifting in and out all the time as you go up and down hills and wears it out. My Dad had that hapen on his F150 and he replaced his transmission with a junk yard transmission that turned out to have the same problem. I had that transmission replaced with a Jasper rebuilt and it worked great. I think it was $1300 for the rebuilt trans with the old one core trade in. I think when 3rd gear goes out, you can only go about 45mph without over reving the engine. I saw that same problem with a Ford Crown vic with that same transmission and 302 engine that my neighbor had.\nDid your third gear just go out all of a sudden or were you getting like a shuttering or kind of a grinding sound when it shifted?\n\nAug 05, 2011 | 1998 Ford F150 Regular Cab\n\n1 Answer\n\n2003 Started reving high in 2nd when trying to shift to 3rd gear.

The heater\/airconditioner's fan blows across it and the hot air comes out of the vents. This is why the heater doesn't work right away when you first start the car. It usually won't work until the hot\/cold needle in the gauges is starting to rise up.\n\nIf your mechanic recently replaced the thermostat, its possible that there is air in the system which will result in less antifreeze in the car than it should be. If this is not the case, the heater core is probably stopping up and will require expensive replacement if it cannot be flushed clean.\n\nCheck to make sure the car is full of antifreeze IN THE RADIATOR, AND THE OVERFLOW JUG. Please be very sure there is NO AIR in the cooling system as well.\n\n\nJan 22, 2013 | 1998 Ford Expedition\n\n2 Answers\n\nAir conditioner suddenly stops blowing cold and starts blowing heated air.

I do some car repairs myself. Could you help me know what to do?\n\nYou may be able to spot the leak by performing a cooling system pressure test.
