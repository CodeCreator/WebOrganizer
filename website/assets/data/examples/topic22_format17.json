This valve will not operate until the engine is warm.\n\ncheck also the engine coolant temp sensor (ECT). This sensor tells the engine computer that the engine has warmed up, so if it is faulty, it could be sending wrong information to the computer. If the sensor is disconnected, wires to it broken, or faulty in full cold mode, it will tell the computer that the engine is very cold, like -40F. The computer will schedule fuel for cold conditions. This is usually way too much fuel for a warm engine and it will rich misfire, idle rough, and be difficult to start warm.\n\nThe ECT has two wires going to it and is dedicated to sending information to the engine computer. It has nothing to do with your dash gauge that shows coolant temp. That sender has only one wire and is dedicated to the coolant temp gauge.\n\nFeb 21, 2011 | 1993 Jeep Wrangler\n\n2 Answers\n\n2001 Dodge 1500 4x4 fault code PO 108\n\nlook for vacuum leak at air filter to throttle body ..all along the snorkel use carb cleaner while running and waft areas described til motor changes personalitly\n\nJan 13, 2009 | 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 Truck 2WD\n\n2 Answers\n\nPo 108\n\nif there is not a vacuum leak it seems that the signal wire to the MAP is either open or shorted to 5 volt reference wire. if not either of those may be the PCM\n\nJan 09, 2009 | 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 Truck 2WD\n\nNot finding what you are looking for?\nCars & Trucks Logo\n\n512 people viewed this question\n\nAsk a Question\n\nUsually answered in minutes!\n\nTop Dodge Experts\n\n\nLevel 3 Expert\n\n66563 Answers\n\nColin Stickland\nColin Stickland\n\nLevel 3 Expert\n\n21990 Answers\n\nJeff Turcotte\nJeff Turcotte\n\nLevel 3 Expert\n\n6812 Answers\n\nAre you a Dodge Expert?

This is the switch that talks to the cars computer and the fan relays. (It is NOT the same as the separate coolant temperature sender which is what sends the temperature to the coolant temp gauge on the dash instruments.) If the engine coolant temp switch is stuck open or in the cool mode, it may not trigger the fan relays. Meanwhile, your coolant temp on the dash gauge will look normal.\n\nJan 18, 2011 | 1992 Honda Accord\n\n2 Answers\n\nI just had a new radiator and thermostat put on my 1996 Nissan Altima.

As long as it's still in the normal range and stays at a new \"normal\" level, I'd say you're OK.

My questions is, can I install the stock radio from a 2002 Chevrolet Suburban into my 94 Saturn, what type of wiring harness would I need and will I need to modify the dash?\nThanks in advance.\n\n5 Answers\n\n\nYou shouldn't need to modify the dash.. I believe the Suburban is a GM fit radio and not a double din so it should fit in a saturn no problem... Just buy a wiring harness for your Saturn and follow the wiring diagram below to figure out which wire goes where 2002 Chevrolet Suburban Car Stereo Radio Wiring Diagram Car Radio Constant 12v+ Wire: Orange Car Radio Switched 12v+ Wire: Yellow Car Radio Ground Wire: Black Car Radio Illumination Wire: Gray Car Stereo Dimmer Wire: Brown Car Stereo Antenna Trigger: N\/A Car Stereo Amp Trigger Wire: Pink Car Stereo Amplifier Location: Front Passenger Footwell Front Speakers Size: N\/A Front Speakers Location: N\/A Left Front Speaker Positive Wire (+): Tan Left Front Speaker Negative Wire (-): Gray Right Front Speaker Positive Wire (+): Light Green Right Front Speaker Negative Wire (-): Dark Green Rear Speakers Size: N\/A Rear Speakers Location: N\/A Left Rear Speaker Positive Wire (+): Brown Left Rear Speaker Negative Wire (-): Yellow Right Rear Speaker Positive Wire (+): Dark Blue Right Rear Speaker Negative Wire (-): Light Blue Source:\n\n\nIf I remember right, these were the same size radios. You can always check places like crutchfield to see if they use the same sizes. Some places also make a wiring harness to connect factory radios to other cars. You will probably have to buy both harnesses and connect the ends with solder or solderless connectors.\n\n\nActually, I went to a local Audio Installer and asked since I was there. The Chevrolet Suburban stock radio mounted right up, I didn't need to use a wiring harness at all. I just took off the front part of the dash, unplugged the Saturn radio and plugged in the Suburban radio, no modifications. All is great now, thanks for the assistance.\n\nThe harness should stay the same but the dash would need modification my best suggestion would be to check all relays and fuses and trace all wires because usually the radio cutting on and off would be a problem with wiring or a security system. so before you get into modifing the dash check the wires or take it to your local chevy dealer and they can check it out for you for a price of around $140.00.\n\nI have a question i have 2002 saturn sl1 im putting a radio in it witch wires goes wher can spmeone help me plz\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nLooking for a Used S-Series in your area?\n\nCarGurus has 597 nationwide S-Series listings and the tools to find you a great deal.\n\n\nSaturn S-Series Experts\n\n  \u2022 #1\n    Alex Nazarian\n  \u2022 #2\n  \u2022 #3\nView All\n\nRelated Models For Sale\n\nUsed Honda Accord\n858 Great Deals out of 88,772 listings starting at $1,444\nUsed Honda Civic\n641 Great Deals out of 54,519 listings starting at $1,500\nUsed Ford Escort\n240 listings\nUsed Chevrolet Cavalier\n759 listings starting at $800\nUsed Toyota Corolla\n926 Great Deals out of 70,852 listings starting at $1,479\nUsed Chevrolet Impala\n507 Great Deals out of 32,641 listings starting at $1,000\n\nContent submitted by Users is not endorsed by CarGurus, does not express the opinions of CarGurus, and should not be considered reviewed, screened, or approved by CarGurus.

        "text":"Tuesday, March 4, 2008\n\nQ&A: Drivetrain clunk, bicycle noises\n\nQ: I have a 94 Bianchi with the Shimano 105 group. When I pedal it feels\nlike there is something loose, kinda like a clunk from both crankarms. I\nremoved the crankarms and reinstalled them they are tight, the pedals are\ntight, I took apart the cassette cluster and cleaned it up. The spindle does\nnot seem to have any play it. I also took the chain rings off cleaned them\nand reinstalled. Still the clunk. The only thing I didn't touch was the\nsealed crank bearings because there wasn't any play in the spindle. What do\nyou think?\n\n\nA: Hi Al,\nI think the bottom bracket cartridge is loose in the frame - the cups aren't\ntight enough so it's moving under pressure. I would remove the crankarms\nagain and using the correct bottom bracket tool, I would first make sure the\nright-side (chainring side) cup was nice and tight in the frame (turn\ncounterclockwise to tighten) and then I would check the right side (turn\nclockwise to tighten). Usually, when there's a clunk like this, it's from\nthe whole BB moving and that should fix it. If you have some blue locktite,\nit would be a good idea to put a couple of drops on the threads before\ntightening to make sure the cups stay tight, but that's not mandatory.\n\nHope that helps quiet your bike, and note that I have a huge story on\nkeeping bikes quiet on my site with a zillion more bicycle noises and how to\nshut them up here: http:\/\/www.jimlangley.net\/wrench\/keepitquiet.html\n\nNo comments:",

A cable lock to the towing eye (if fitted) on the car is a good idea, and even if not there's often a suitable hole under the car. D-locking the 2-3 bikes together can make removal a time-consuming task (hard to get a straps to undo\/cut). Not suitable for overnight use outside a motel perhaps, but fuel\/food stops should be no problem. \u2013\u00a0 Chris H Jul 17 '14 at 14:07\n@ChrisH Always? Down the road you are going to let a cable\/ulock rub\/bang on your bikes. \u2013\u00a0 Frisbee Jul 17 '14 at 14:37\n@Blam yes always. Then you don't forget when you stop. If you're worried put a sleeve round the lock\/frame or strap the lock to the bikes so it doesn't move. I have a msaterlock cable lock that cinches tight so acts as an extra strap, and is plastic covered so it doesn't mark the bikes (it really doesn't). Using this is a habit from carrying kayaks where an extra fixing can be of benefit if a strap loosens between stops. My d-lock is also plastic covered and in practice doesn't damage painted alloy when the lock body points down. The bikes in the Q were rentals and may be scuffed anyway. \u2013\u00a0 Chris H Jul 17 '14 at 14:43\n@ChrisH You can let your bikes get rubbed and banged but I an not doing that to mine.

Residue from fuel additives and\/or carbon deposits that result from normal fuel combustion can accumulate on the throttle body and\/or upper combustion chamber over time. Dirty throttle bodies can cause a variety of vehicle drivability concerns and may result in MIL illumination under certain circumstances.\nWhen the engine is started, the incoming air sometimes carries residue back to the throttle body and deposits it just behind the throttle plate because of the sudden drop in air pressure behind the plate.\nWhen the engine is running, crankcase vapors enter through the PCV system and work their way into the intake system. These vapors carry with them residue which accumulates on the idle passages and throttle plate. This build-up eventually blocks the air gap between the throttle plate and throttle body bore, causing less airflow while the throttle plate is closed. Over time, the computer compensates for the reduced airflow with fuel trim adaptive logic adjustments, as it becomes more difficult for the computer to control the idle, especially when coming to a stop or when the throttle is \" snapped\". Do NOT replace the throttle body before the throttle plates are cleaned for any condition related to fuel trim values.\nFig. 1: Identifying Throttle Plate Cleaner\nRemove the intake duct hose that is connected to the throttle body.\nWARNING: Make sure the application straw is securely attached to the throttle plate cleaner nozzle. Failure to do so may result in a straw that has come off and is now stuck in the intake manifold assembly.\n\nFig. 2: Throttle Body\nUsing throttle plate or equivalent cleaner, open the throttle to the Wide-Open-Throttle (WOT) position. Clean out the throttle body bore and throttle plate using a small soft metallic (brass) or stiff bristled brush as necessary.\nFig. 3: Cleaning Throttle Body Bore\nAfter the cleaning is complete, reinstall air intake duct hose. Be sure all throttle cables are routed correctly then, start the engine. The engine will run rough until all the throttle plate cleaner is burned off from the internal vacuum circuits. Shut engine off.\nRemove the ECM memory fuse for 10 seconds and then re-install. This will reset the fuel trim adaptive values. Not all models use the scan tool to clear the adaptive fuel trim values.\nNOTE: Removing the ECU memory fuse will not affect the loss of voltage to other control modules requiring the windows to be initialized, ETS, sunroof, overhead displays, radio station presets.\n\nECM Memory fuses are as follows: ECM MEMORY FUSES\nModel\/MYECM Memory Fuses\n2001 2005 Rio10 Amp Underhood ECU Fuse\n1998 2004 Sephia\/Spectra (1.8L Engine)10 Amp Underhood ECU 2 Fuse\n2004 2005 Spectra (2.0L Engine)30 Amp Underhood ECU 2 Fuse\n2001 05 Optima10 Amp Underhood ECU Fuse\n2004 05 Amanti10 Amp Underhood ECU Fuse\n2002 05 Sedona10 Amp Underhood Powertrain Fuse\n2003 05 Sorento10 Amp Underhood Powertrain Fuse\n2005 Sportage30 Amp Underhood ECM Fuse\n\nRoad test the vehicle approximately 2-3 miles before returning the vehicle to the customer.\n\n\n\nMay, 10, 2010 AT 4:52 PM\n\nHi Dave,\n\nThanks, the throttle body cleaning definitely improved the low idle. Also, I did clean the flag on the crankshaft pulley. Unfortunately, the P0303 code came back, even after clearing it. With the improved idle, I can now definitely hear the misfire from the tailpipe, so it is absolutely real. Any other suggestions on what to check or replace? I tried a new plug, wire, and coil again over the weekend. Third time for each. I also swapped injectors, second time. I threw in a new throttle position sensor when I cleaned the throttle body. I'm out of ideas. Would a bad O2 sensor cause just one cylinder to misfire? Is cylinder #3 the third cylinder from the passenger side (third from the left when looking at the car head on?) Any help that you could offer would be appreciated.\n\n\nDave H\n\nMay, 11, 2010 AT 3:08 AM\n\n\nArrowed is the timing belt side of engine !\n\n\nA bad 02 sensor should not cause one cylinder to misfire .. could you please check for any vacuum leaks on vacuum lines and check the PCV is functioning correctly ... also check compression on all cylinders !\n\n\nPlease login or register to post a reply.\n\nOxygen Sensor Replacement Dodge Stratus\nCrankshaft Position Sensor Replace Chevrolet\nOxygen Sensor Replacement Honda Civic 1996-20",

Please reopen! $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Peter K\u00e4mpf Feb 10 '16 at 21:50\n\nMark is right when he says that there is no induced drag at supersonic speeds, but it is an invitation for misunderstandings. Induced drag is replaced by lift wave drag, and all what happens is that aerodynamicists choose to use two different names for basically the same effect: Air gets pushed down.\n\nAs usual when I post a long answer, I was not quite happy with the existing answer(s). Now I have some time and try to give a better answer.\n\nFirst, why does the straight wing work better only at very high Mach numbers (> 2.0)? Because at lower supersonic speed a swept wing gives overall better performance. The sweep angle $\\varphi_0$ must be high enough to allow for a subsonic leading edge (Mach < $\\frac{1}{cos\\varphi_0}$). Then the flow around the leading edge is subsonic and creates a suction area when accelerating around the nose contour. This suction helps to reduce drag - after all, this same suction is why a subsonic airfoil in inviscid flow has no drag. Edward C. Polhamus did a lot of research on this at NACA Langley and published several papers with equations for calculating the suction force.\n\nOnce you fly faster than Mach 2, the sweep angle for a subsonic leading edge rapidly gets too high for acceptable subsonic flight, and an unswept wing becomes the better alternative since you need to accept a supersonic leading edge. Examples are the wing of the F-104 or the canard of the XB-70.\n\nNow for the airfoil drag at supersonic speed. Because it is easiest to explain, I select a rhombic cross section: Rhombic airfoil in symmetric supersonic flow\n\nRhombic airfoil in supersonic flow at zero angle of attack (own work). The plus sign denotes higher pressure, the minus sign lower pressure than ambient. By selecting a rhombic airfoil, the flow is very easy to determine because the pressure only changes when the local contour gradient changes. The two compression shocks create the typical sonic boom when arriving at the ground. Note that this airfoil already creates pressure drag even at zero lift. Any airfoil thickness greater than zero and any airfoil camber will cause this type of drag where the forward-facing areas see higher pressure and the rear-facing areas experience suction. This type of drag is called wave drag. It can only be minimized by minimizing the relative thickness of whatever is supposed fly at supersonic speed.\n\nWhen the angle of attack is increased, this airfoil begins to create lift. Now the compression by the lower forward shock becomes stronger and that by the upper forward shock becomes weaker. The expansion fan is the same again on both sides, so the upper rear half experiences less pressure than the lower rear half. I tried to symbolize this by the amount of plus and minus signs: Rhombic airfoil in supersonic flow at an angle\n\nNote that the pressure difference is constant over chord, so the center of pressure is at 50% of chord length. Note also that the lift vector is perpendicular to the chord line. Since lift is defined as the force perpendicular to the direction of the undisturbed air, supersonic lift always carries a drag component which is proportional to the angle of attack - there is no suction at the nose to alleviate this! The wave drag of the airfoil at zero angle of attack still comes on top, so we have a shape-dependent wave drag and a lift-dependent wave drag component. This lift-dependent wave drag replaces the induced drag of subsonic speeds. If we compare the magnitude of both, we find:\n\nSubsonic: $c_{Di} = \\frac{c^2_L}{\\pi\\cdot AR\\cdot\\epsilon}$\n\nSupersonic formula for 2D flow: $c_{{DW}_L} = c_L\\cdot\\alpha$\n\nThis doesn't look so similar, so let's now express the angle of attack $\\alpha$ by the lift coefficient divided by the lift curve slope:\n\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{c_L}{c_{L\\alpha}} = \\frac{c_L}{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{Ma^2-1}}\\cdot\\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\cdot AR\\cdot\\sqrt{Ma^2-1}}\\right)}$$\n\nand the lift wave drag component becomes $c_{{DW}_L} = \\frac{c^2_L}{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{Ma^2-1}}\\cdot\\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\cdot AR\\cdot\\sqrt{Ma^2-1}}\\right)}$\n\nNow let's compare the F-104 wing, which has an aspect ratio $AR$ of 2.45 and a taper ratio $\\lambda$ of 0.385: If we plug in the parameters and adjust $\\epsilon$ such that both sub- and supersonic lift-dependent drag coefficients agree, $\\epsilon$ would need to be 0.89 at Mach 1.2, 0.58 at Mach 1.4 and 0.31 at Mach 2.0. The dramatic rise of lift wave drag over Mach is caused by the reduction in the lift curve slope over Mach.\n\nFor slender bodies the lift curve slope is $c_{L\\alpha} = \\frac{\\pi\\cdot AR}{2}$ and the lift wave drag component becomes $c_{{DW}_L} = 2\\cdot\\frac{c^2_L}{\\pi\\cdot AR}$. For slender bodies the supersonic $\\epsilon$ is 0.5, regardless of Mach.\n\nThe important conclusions from this for wing selection are:\n\n  \u2022 Sweep does no longer help once the leading edge is supersonic.\n  \u2022 Lift wave drag continues where induced drag drops off. Lift always causes drag.\n  \u2022 For a supersonic wing the aspect ratio is of minor importance.\n\nNow back to the original question: Once the leading edge is supersonic, sweep is no longer helpful. Now the best wing is straight, because it will need the lowest wing area to create the required lift at subsonic speed. At supersonic speed its lower area will translate into lower friction drag, making it better than comparable delta or swept wings.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ I really like the clarity of your illustrations. Do you have any links for further readings (and if not, I think you should publish a book compiling your answers)? $\\endgroup$ \u2013\u00a0Manu H Feb 26 '17 at 8:52\n\nFor a given lift coefficient, boundary layer drag is smaller for the straight wing configuration, and lift-induced drag is larger for straight wing. These conflicting effects may give an advantage to straight wing at low subsonic speeds.\n\nAt speeds of about Mach 0.8 you begin to get wave drag because the flow over the wing is not uniform, and in some regions you have supersonic flow. The wave drag is much less for swept wings, roughly in proportion to the aspect ratio. So when you are trying to push the plane to Mach 1, swept wings make your job easier.\n\nAt Mach 1 and a bit higher more and more of the wing region experiences supersonic flow, and the shock drag is dominant. Again, swept wings have a huge drag advantage (not to mention a control advantage).\n\nBut pretty soon, certainly by Mach 2, both wings have the same amount of wave drag, and the shock drag becomes less important as the region near Mach 1 disappears. And now we come to our first observation, about boundary layer and lift-induced drag roughly balancing. Except --\n\nAt supersonic flow there is no lift-induced drag\n\nThis is because the \"wake cannot be felt upstream.\" More accurately, the penalty associated with turning the flow to generate lift is captured over the wing surface and what happens downstream of the wing cannot affect the flow over the wing because \"knowledge\" of what happens downstream propagates at the speed of sound.\n\nSo we have to remove, from our calculations for each type of wing, the lift-induced drag, which had been greater in the straight wing. And this makes the straight wing drag coefficient lower at moderately high supersonic speeds, compared to the swept wing.\n\nI may be wrong here because fluid dynamics is famous for introducing subtle effects that nobody would have anticipated, but I believe this issue is understood and the trade-off mentioned is the heuristic reason.\n\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

The serpentine belt is on and working fine and the pulley that I think is connected to the water pump seems to be okay.\n\nAsked by for the 2003 Buick LeSabre\nIf the car overheated and the belt is fine, then the water pump is not the problem if you don't hear any noise coming from it AND if you don't have coolant leaking. More than likely, the thermostat is the culprit.\n\nYou HAVE checked to ensure that the coolant level is correct?\n\nYou weren't stuck in traffic, were you?\n\nAnswer #3 is correct in the approximate location - passenger side of the engine.
