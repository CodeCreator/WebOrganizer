        "text":"Infectious Disease in Illinois\n\nQuestions and Answers about Cronobacter sakazakii (formerly Enterobacter sakazakki) and the Use of Powdered Infant Formula (PIF)\n\nIf you are concerned about your infant\u2019s health or the infant is experiencing symptoms of meningitis or septicemia, which include fever, fussiness, vomiting, lethargy, not eating, listlessness or spine arching, immediately contact your pediatrician or local health care provider.\n\n  \u2022 What is Cronobacter sakazakii? What diseases can the bacteria cause?\n\nCronobacter sakazakii, formerly known as Enterobacter sakazakii, is a bacterium. Illness from this organism is rare, but infection can cause meningitis and septicemia in infants. The infection can be fatal or result in long-term complications.\n\n  \u2022 Where does the bacterium come from? Where can it be found?\n\nThe bacteria are everywhere in the environment and have been found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals. Ingestion of food contaminated with the bacteria or the presence of the bacterium on surfaces, such as kitchen countertops, does not always result in illness.\n\n  \u2022 How does powdered infant formula get contaminated with Cronobacter sakazakii? Can it be found in other foods?\n\nThe way powdered infant formula becomes contaminated with these bacteria is not well understood. Contamination can occur from the raw ingredients used in the formula, during the manufacturing process or during the preparation\/reconstitution process. Contamination also may occur through blenders, feeding bottles and utensils used to cleanse feeding bottles. Contamination may be more likely when reconstituted formula is kept at improper temperatures prior to use or for a longer duration than suggested by manufacturers. The organism has been found in other foods, but only powdered infant formula has been linked to disease outbreaks.\n\n  \u2022 Who is at risk for getting this infection?\n\nThose at elevated risk for infection are premature and low birth-weight infants, infants with immune system problems or babies born to mothers with immune system problems.\n\n  \u2022 How can this risk be minimized or reduced?\n\nCommercially sterile liquid formula is less frequently associated with illness and can be used in instead of powdered infant formula, where possible. If powdered infant formula is chosen, remember it is not a sterile product and the use of boiled water can reduce the risk of infection. This includes tap water, bottled water or water specifically indicated for use in infant care.\n\nPowdered infant formula should be prepared\/reconstituted immediately before feeding time, according to package instructions and cooled appropriately before giving to the infant.\n\nAdditional tips to reduce infection risk\n\nClean utensils\n\n  \u2022 Wash hands, forearms and fingernails thoroughly before handling any feeding materials or preparing formula.\n  \u2022 All bottles, nipples, caps and rings should be washed in hot, soapy water with thorough rinsing.\n\nPreparing formula\n\n  \u2022 Before use, powdered formula should be kept dry in an airtight container with a firm cap or lid and stored in a cool, dark area. Make sure the expiration date has not passed.\n  \u2022 During formula preparation, bring water to a bubbling boil for two minutes and allow the water to cool before mixing.\n  \u2022 Avoid reheating formula and do not use a microwave oven to warm the formula.\n\nStoring formula\n\n  \u2022 Formula should be prepared in small amounts immediately before feeding time to minimize the need for storing prepared\/reconstituted formula.\n  \u2022 Prepared\/reconstituted formula should not be stored at room temperature for more than one hour or more than four hours in the refrigerator.\n  \u2022 Throw out any formula left in a bottle after feeding.\n\nAdditional information for the best practices in infant formula preparation can be found at:\n\nIllinois Department of Human Services:\nWorld Health Organization (WHO):\n\nidph online home\nIllinois Department of Public Health\n535 West Jefferson Street\nSpringfield, Illinois 62761\nPhone 217-782-4977\nFax 217-782-3987\nTTY 800-547-0466\nQuestions or Comments",

        "text":"Here are answers to some common questions about bellyaches\n\nHow can I tell if my child is faking a bellyache?\nAssume the bellyache is real.\n\nHow is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder different from a disease?\nIn this context, pain associated with disease is caused by anatomic abnormalities, inflammation, and\/or tissue destruction.\n\nFunctional pains are caused by an altered way in which the body is working.\n\nIf my child has symptoms, but the tests are negative, does it mean it is all in my child\u2019s head?\nNo. Functional pains are influenced by a combination of mental (mind) and medical (physical) factors \u2013 a brain-gut interaction. The gastrointestinal tract is connected to the brain by millions of nerves, and each system influences the other.\n\nIf symptoms persist, does my child need more tests?\nAsking this question means you either do not accept the concept of functional disorders, have not accepted your child\u2019s diagnosis, or have fears related to the child\u2019s health that have not yet been addressed.\n\nIf you've taken the child to other physicians who may not have come to a symptom-based diagnosis, trust in a functional diagnosis might not come easily.\n\nA knowledgeable physician can diagnose a functional GI disorder by careful review of the child\u2019s symptoms and a physical examination. If any selected diagnostic procedures are performed, they are often limited to a few basic tests.\n\nFunctional GI disorders are not dangerous, and we know how to manage them. Talk to your physician if you have questions or if you observe a change in symptoms.\n\nHow can you be sure there is no disease?\nWorries about the child\u2019s health are normal. Repeated explanations may be necessary because the concept of functional symptoms may be new.\n\nThere are no tests for diagnosis of a functional gastrointestinal disorder, but there are symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Functional GI disorders are common; diseases are unusual. If your child\u2019s symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for a functional GI disorder, there's no need to worry that it is something else.\n\nAsk your physician to reevaluate the child promptly if the symptoms change.\n\nHow do you treat the pain in functional disorders?\nConceptually, functional abdominal pain may be treated:\n\n  1. with education\n  2. from the top down (learning)\n  3. from the bottom up (medicines), or\n  4. with any combination of these.\n\nSometimes getting a diagnosis and learning about a functional disorder is enough to reduce the worries a family has about the health of their child. All parents ask the same four questions when they see a clinician:\n\n  1. What is wrong?\n  2. Is it dangerous?\n  3. Will it go away?\n  4. What can we do about it?\n\nIn the case of a functional bellyache the answers are:\n\n  1. It\u2019s a functional bellyache.\n  2. It's not dangerous.\n  3. It comes and goes.\n  4. There are several ways to treat it.\n\nIf the answers satisfy and the child is not disabled by pain in any way, further treatment may be unnecessary. The goal is to help the child cope with symptoms so that they don\u2019t miss daily obligations and activities.\n\nTop down treatment \u2013 Children can learn to use the thinking parts of their brains to reduce pain.\n\nResearch has proven that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and hypnosis can be just as good as medicine in relieving functional GI symptoms.\n\nCBT is a series of lessons that teach a child (or adult) how to use the thinking part of their brain to reduce pain from functional disorders. Usually a psychologist teaches these lessons for an hour each week for about ten weeks. It is the child\u2019s responsibility to practice the techniques at home every day, so CBT requires active participation in the treatment.\n\nA second top-down treatment is hypnosis. In carefully designed research, hypnosis was as good as medicine in treating irritable bowel syndrome after a few weeks.\n\nIf these top-down methods are available, they have several advantages:\n\n  \u2022 They teach the child the skills needed to reduce pain without medication.\n  \u2022 They add to the child\u2019s skills at coping with other kinds of adversity and stress, like taking tests at school or hiking up a mountain.\n  \u2022 If practiced regularly, the skills are a permanent improvement in coping with life\u2019s stress.\n\nBottom up treatment \u2013 Children may benefit from small doses of chronic pain medicines, or medicine to take away acid or intestinal muscle spasm. These medications are safe and effective in most, but not all, children.\n\nChoice of treatments depends on how disabling the pain is to daily activities, and the availability of the treatments.\n\n  \u2022 If the pain does not disrupt daily activities, then education and reassurance may be all that is needed.\n  \u2022 If pain is changing the child\u2019s behavior or disrupting the family, then CBT, hypnosis, or medicine may be advisable.\n  \u2022 If a functional bellyache prevents school attendance or normal eating, than a combination of top down, bottom up treatments may work best.\n\nIs dietary fiber important?\nIn large population-based studies, fiber seems to have some long-term advantages.\n\nIn the short term, increasing fiber in your child\u2019s diet may not be worth the fuss. In toddlers, getting them to eat anything regularly becomes a struggle, because it is developmentally appropriate for them to be testing their ability to control their environment. The same thing goes for adolescents.\n\nIn addition, fiber is often associated with an increase in intestinal gas production, and may increase abdominal cramps and flatulence. Flatulence is especially embarrassing to the school-age child.\n\nSoft stools and painless defecation are most often achieved with daily oral polyethelene glycol, as directed by your child's physician.\n\nLearn More about Kids & Dietary Fiber\n\nIs diet an important factor?\nDiet is very important, but each child is different. It is important to eat a well-balanced diet. If it is possible to identify foods that trigger symptoms, those foods can be reduced or eliminated from the diet. Many people with IBS - working with a knowledgeable dietitian - improve on a low FODMAP diet. FODMAP stands for \"Fermentable Oligo-saccharides, Di-saccharides, Mono-saccharides, And Polyols.\" Present in many foods, FODMAPs are smll molecules that are converted to gas by bacteria in the intestines.\n\nLearn More about\u00a0the Low FODMAP Diet\n\nHow do you know when a non-verbal child has a bellyache?\nChronic pain makes a child change behavior. Infants and toddlers will not eat when it hurts to eat or they fear it will hurt to eat. Infants and toddlers will stop pooping if they experience pain when they poop. Refusal to eat and refusal to poop are two symptoms that indicate it is time for a visit to the doctor. Crying or fussiness alone is not always a symptom of pain.\n\nShould I keep my child home because of an early morning bellyache?\nNot if there are no warning signs of disease. As a parent you can help your child learn to cope with a functional disorder. Remind the child that the functional bellyache is not dangerous, and that the pain will not differ at home or in school, so the child may as well go to school and learn.\n\nA few children and adolescents have diarrhea and pain from irritable bowel that comes every morning and lasts several hours. A few more children and adolescents experience intense upper abdominal nausea and vomiting for several hours each morning. These early morning functional symptoms may be treated successfully with bedtime low-dose amitriptyline.\n\nDid This Article Help You?\nIFFGD is a nonprofit education and research organization.

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Who comes for counselling\/psychotherapy?\n\nThe simplistic answer is just about anyone and you do not necessarily need to be in a period of crisis in your life. There may be a few specific areas you wish to address, personal development opportunities or there may be more far reaching issues that require longer term psychotherapy\n\n  \u2022 How long do sessions continue?\n\nThis depends very much in part to the individual seeking counselling. Some people require just a few sessions to talk through one or more specific areas, others may require more in depth exploration of issues and this will take the form of more longer term therapy. Whatever the requirement, confidential sessions are held in a safe environment and provided on a tailor made basis to suite each individuals' needs.\n\n  \u2022 What counselling models are used?\n\nCounsellors are fully accredited by the Counselling Society and in some cases are members of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). They use an integrative approach combining elements based upon Person Centred, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Transactional Analysis (TA) and Solution Focused Therapies.\n\nCounsellors attend regular training to ensure they are up to date with current techniques and research.\n\nCounsellors also receive regular BACP Accredited Supervision and hold professional liability insurance. Each counsellor is fully Criminal Reference Bureau (CRB) checked allowing them to work with young people and children.\n\n  \u2022 When can appointments be made?\n\nAppointments are available daily during working hours on Monday and Friday. Evening appointments run from 6.00 p.m. - 9.00 p.m. and Saturday mornings from 9.00 a.m. - 1.00 p.m. We can also provide some mobile counselling appointments depending upon location and a telephone counselling service if requested.\n\n  \u2022 How much do the consultations cost?\n\nA pricing schedule and details of prices for all therapies are available on the \"Therapies\" page of this website. Reduced rates are offered for those on lower income, senior citizens, students and children. Couple counselling is charged at the flat rate of \u00a330.00 for a 60 minute consultation or \u00a345.00 for a 90 minute consultation.\n\nDuring the initial consultation, therapy will be scoped and structured. The initial session gives an opportunity for client and therapist to consider working together. Should more specialist assistance be required then a referral system is in operation.

        "text":"Serving Sioux Falls, SD\n\nLane Family Chiropractic - Logo\n\n\"Complete Chiropractic Care For You and Your Entire Family\"\n\nIn simplest terms, a subluxation (a.k.a. Vertebral Subluxation) is when one or more of the bones of your spine (vertebrae) stop moving and create pressure on, or irritates spinal nerves. Spinal nerves are the nerves that come out from between each of the bones in your spine. This pressure or irritation on the nerves then causes those nerves to malfunction and interfere with the signals traveling over those nerves.\n\n\nHow does this affect you? Your nervous system controls and coordinates all the functions of your body. If you interfere with the signals traveling over nerves, parts of your body will not get the proper nerve messages and will not be able to function at 100% of their innate abilities. In other words, some part of your body will not be working properly. It is the responsibility of the doctor of chiropractic to locate subluxations, and reduce or correct them. This is done through a series of chiropractic adjustments specifically designed to correct the vertebral subluxations in your spine. Chiropractors are the only professionals who undergo years of training to be the experts at correcting subluxations.\n\nWho can benefit from chiropractic?\n\nEveryone can benefit from chiropractic, newborns to the elderly. If treatment is indicated, chiropractic care is very beneficial to your health. For some, chiropractic care could mean freedom from pain without the use of drugs or surgery. For everyone treatment could mean that they perform, work, live and function on a higher level. Chiropractic is drugless, non-invasive, and safe. The most common side effect of chiropractic is not a side effect at all, but rather the effect of feeling clearer, more balanced, and better as a whole. For many this often means living pain free. Children, young adults, adults and the elderly may all benefit from a properly functioning nervous system. Life is stressful both physically and mentally, and we are all affected. We all want to live happy, healthy lives that are as productive and comfortable as possible. Chiropractic is available to all, to serve you both preventively and to heal your ailing systems. It is often said that good health is priceless, and yet we often ignore the health of the nervous system that controls our body. Everyone, young and old should be evaluated and treated when clinically indicated by a chiropractic physician.\n\nTo learn more about our chiropractic services,\n\ngive us a call at:\n\n\nRead Our Frequently Asked Questions\n\nOur team at Lane Family Chiropractic is family-owned and operated. We're located in Sioux Falls, SD. You can count on us for a wide variety of chiropractic services. Enclosed below are some frequently asked questions for your easy reference.\n\nWhat is a subluxation?\n\nHelping you with top-notch chiropractic treatments for the last 10 years!\n\nWhat can I expect from my first visit?\n\nYour first visit to Lane Family Chiropractic will give you an opportunity if chiropractic can help you. The doctor will perform a thorough history of your present complaints as well as your past history. The doctor will then perform a thorough examination on the area of complaint as well as corresponding areas and make recommendations accordingly. X-rays may be needed to give the doctor more information to help treat you. There is not an x-ray machine on site, but Lane Family Chiropractic has a facility nearby where x-rays can be taken. If x-rays are needed, the doctor will go over them with you and explain what she feels is causing your symptoms. If further tests are needed, they will be discussed at that time. Each patient will also be adjusted that same day unless otherwise contraindicated. If any questions arise during the visit, do not hesitate to ask the doctor. Your first visit will last from 30-45 minutes, but other visits following will take about 20-25 minutes.\n\nCan I be adjusted if I am pregnant?\n\nOf course, yes. Chiropractic is very safe for both the mother and the child. In fact, chiropractic can be very beneficial for pregnant women suffering from low back pain. The tables that chiropractors use can be adjusted to accommodate the growing belly of a pregnant woman. The tables allow the pregnant woman to lie on her stomach so the doctor is able to evaluate their lower back. The doctor's technique is modified, but the technique is safe and beneficial. If you are pregnant or think that you are pregnant, please inform your doctor immediately, because there are some therapies that cannot be performed in the area of a pregnant uterus.\n\nWhy should I go keep going to the chiropractor if I am feeling ok?\n\nPeople usually only go the chiropractor when they feel pain in their neck, low back, or even suffer from a debilitating headache. This then causes a person to visit the chiropractor more frequently to get rid of their pain. As soon as their pain is gone, they often stop going to the chiropractor. You may feel fine, but the joints in your body may not be moving correctly and are not to the point of causing pain. Even though you may feel fine, regular visits to the chiropractor have been shown to decrease, even sometimes prevent exacerbations of pain that bring you to the chiropractor. Regular wellness adjustments can decrease the exacerbations of pain and in turn decrease your visits to the chiropractor. Regular adjustments have also been shown to decrease the number of illnesses that one experiences throughout the year.\n\nChiropractor Chiropractor",

        "text":"2843 Hartland Road, suite 100\nFalls Church, VA 22043\n\nHow much do braces hurt?\n\nThe actual process of having the braces placed on your teeth is nearly painless; however, your body\u2019s response and adjustment to the braces in the days and weeks that follow the procedure can be uncomfortable and mildly achy. The vast majority of the patients become accustomed to braces in less than two weeks.\n\nWhat can I eat while I have braces?\n\nYou can eat almost any food as long as they are not too hard or sticky. Once treatment begins, we will explain the complete instructions and provide a comprehensive list of foods to avoid. Some of those foods include: ice, hard candy, raw vegetables and all sticky foods (i.e. caramel and taffy). You can avoid most emergency appointments to repair broken or damaged braces by carefully following our instructions.\n\nDo I need to brush my teeth more often if I have braces?\n\nWith braces, you should brush your teeth at least three times a day to keep your teeth, gums, and mouth healthy and clean. Brushing regularly will help remove any food that may be caught between the braces. You should also floss daily to get in between your braces where your brush isn\u2019t able to reach. Your orthodontist can show you how to properly brush and floss once your braces are placed.\n\nWill my braces interfere with my school activities like sports, playing an instrument, or singing?\n\nPlaying an instrument or a contact sport may require some adjustment when you first get your braces, but wearing braces will not stop you from participating in any of your school activities. If you play a contact sport, it is recommended that you wear a mouth-guard to protect your braces or appliance.\n\nHow often do I need to come in for appointments?\n\nPatients are usually seen every 4-8 week intervals.\n\nDo I still need dental checkups every six months when I\u2019m being seen by the orthodontist?\n\nYes! In fact, it\u2019s even more important that patients receiving orthodontic treatment visit their dentist regularly. With braces, food may be caught in places that your toothbrush can\u2019t reach. This causes bacteria to build up that can lead to cavities, gingivitis, and gum disease. Your dentist will work closely with your orthodontist to make sure that your teeth stay clean and healthy while wearing braces.\n\nCan orthodontic correction occur while a child has baby teeth?\n\nYes. Some orthodontic problems are significant enough to require early intervention. However, if a patient is not yet ready for treatment, we will follow that patient\u2019s growth and development until the time is right for treatment to begin.\n\nCan I get Invisalign?\n\nInvisalign has made important advances since their introduction in the \u201880\u2019s to improve their effectiveness. Despite their popularity and vast demand from advertisements, clear aligners still pose major challenges for certain types of orthodontic cases. Not all patients are recommended for Invisalign. Upon examination, Dr. Jones\u00a0may discuss this exciting treatment option with you.\n\nWhy should I choose an orthodontic specialist?\n\nTeeth, and sometimes entire facial structures, are permanently changed by orthodontic treatment. It is important that the treatment be appropriate and properly completed. Orthodontic specialists have extensive and specialized training that enables them to provide their patients with professional, personalized treatments.",

Some foods, such as tea and seafood, have high levels of fluoride. Bottled water or beverages can contain fluoride from public water. Mineral water may also have high levels. In the case of natural waters, the variation in the fluoride content from region to region is dependent upon such factors as the source of water, type of geological formation and the amount of rainfall. (Dry regions tend to have higher fluoride.) Surface waters generally have low fluoride while ground waters typically contain more. Certain dental care products have fluoride added, and your dentist can advise you on which formulation may be beneficial to you or your child.\n\nShow All Answers\n\n1.

We can answer all of your questions about treating eye problems for those who are diabetic. Here are some FAQs about a diabetic eye exam.\n\nWoman getting a Diabetic Eye Exam in West Los Angeles.\n\nWhat is Diabetic Retinopathy?\n\nIf you have diabetes, the main reason we encourage you to have regular eye exams is so we can look for changes the blood vessels of your retinas. Such changes can be indicators of diabetic retinopathy, a condition that occurs due to extended exposure to high blood pressure. This can cause the walls of blood vessels in one\u2019s eyes to weaken. The longer a person has diabetes and the greater their exposure to high blood glucose, the greater their risk of having Diabetic Retinopathy.\n\nWhat are Some Signs of this Condition?\n\nThe earliest signs of diabetic retinopathy may be small white or red spots (microaneurysms) on one or both retinas. \u00a0These spots are actually tiny pouches of blood that often can only be seen by your eye doctor.\n\nIf these pouches leak, blurring of vision may occur requiring immediate treatment.\n\nShould diabetic retinopathy cause damage near the macula, it often swells much like a bug bite. The swelling, or macular edema, is the most common reason for impaired vision in diabetic retinopathy.\n\nIs Diabetic Retinopathy Permanent?\n\nIn its early stages, retinopathy is often temporary. If left unchecked the risks of abnormal blood vessels proliferating increases greatly. These new blood vessels are so fragile that they can rupture at a sneeze, a cough, or even while during your sleep. Scar tissue forms and tug at the retina adding to the potential for retinal detachment.\n\nHow is Diabetic Retinopathy\u00a0Treated?\n\nDiabetic retinopathy once led to blindness but now can be controlled through laser treatment that preserves vision in the macula, the most important part of the retina.\n\nSometimes a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy is indicated.\n\nMedicine like ranibizumab and aflibercept are also often effective in treating diabetic retinopathy for people with diabetic macular edema.\n\nWho Should Have a Diabetic Eye Exam?\n\nThe American Diabetes Association recommends that anyone over 10 years old who has Type 1 diabetes have a comprehensive eye examination within at least five years after they are diagnosed. People with Type 2 diabetes should have the same exam at least annually.\n\nYou can reach one of our many locations in Los Angeles, CA by calling us at (310) 670-1888.

        "text":"How many hours of sleep are enough for good health?\n\nAnswer From Eric J. Olson, M.D.\n\nThe amount of sleep you need depends on various factors \u2014 especially your age. While sleep needs vary significantly among individuals, consider these general guidelines for different age groups:\n\nAge group Recommended amount of sleep\nNewborns 14 to 17 hours a day\n12 months About 10 hours at night, plus 4 hours of naps\n2 years About 11 to 12 hours at night, plus a 1- to 2-hour afternoon nap\n3 to 5 years 10 to 13 hours\n6 to 13 years 9 to 11 hours\n14 to 17 years 8 to 10 hours\nAdults 7 to 9 hours\n\nIn addition to age, other factors can affect how many hours of sleep you need. For example:\n\n  \u2022 Pregnancy. Changes in the body during early pregnancy can increase the need for sleep.\n  \u2022 Aging. Older adults need about the same amount of sleep as younger adults. As you get older, however, your sleeping patterns might change. Older adults tend to sleep more lightly and for shorter time spans than do younger adults.\n  \u2022 Previous sleep deprivation. If you're sleep deprived, the amount of sleep you need increases.\n  \u2022 Sleep quality. If your sleep is frequently interrupted, you're not getting quality sleep. The quality of your sleep is just as important as the quantity.\n\nSome people claim to feel rested on just a few hours of sleep a night, but their performance is likely affected. Research shows that people who sleep so little over many nights don't perform as well on complex mental tasks as do people who get closer to seven hours of sleep a night.\n\n\nEric J.

        "text":"FAQ \u2013 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome [ CTS ]\n\nIntracell Technology\u2122 \u2013 an overview in cumulative trauma disorders\n\n  \u2022 It is not only the rate of muscle fatigue that reveals the problem, but the rate of muscle recovery as well.\n  \u2022 Muscle recovery is dependent on a nutrient rich and oxygen laden blood supply.\n  \u2022 Restricted blood flow occurs in generalized muscle tightness as well as localized muscle bundle shortening.\n  \u2022 Stretching procedures address generalized muscle tightness but fail to inactivate the segmental, ischemic muscle bundle.\n  \u2022 This shortened muscle bundle [or knot] is the reflex mechanism of a barrier trigger point.\n  \u2022 The INTRACELL\u00ae Stick\u00ae provides painless non-invasive myofascial release, which inactivates trigger points and muscle tightness.\n  \u2022 This biomechanical release calms the reflex mechanism which allows relaxation of the myofascia.\n  \u2022 The return of non-restricted blood flow physiologically promotes healing and elevates both quality and quantity of motion.\n\nFAQs . . .\n\nQ: What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome [ CTS ]?\n\nA: CTS means there is a painful pressure against the median nerve which runs through a tunnel formed by wrist bones. No local etiology for nerve compression is commonly detectable.\n\nQ: Why is it called \u201ccarpal tunnel\u2019?\n\nA: Anatomically, the tunnel is formed by the carpal bones of the wrist, which is deepened by the tubercles of the scaphoid and trapezium on the radial side and by the pisiform and hook of the hammate on the ulnar side. This concavity is converted into a tunnel by the tough flexor retinaculum which stretches between the tubercle of the scaphoid and ulnar styloid.\n\nQ: What passes through the tunnel?\n\nA: The eight flexor tendons of the fingers, the long flexor tendon of the thumb, and the median nerve all share space in the tunnel.\n\nQ: Who is the primary target?\n\nA: Although CTS affects people in many fields \u2013 it is common among drivers, draftsmen, secretaries, meat cutters, musicians, assembly workers, tennis players, canoe paddlers, carpenters, needlepoint stitchers and others. It is best known for its effect on users of computer keyboards.\n\nQ: Do other conditions contribute to CTS?\n\nA: According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, \u201cOther conditions associated with CTS include arthritis, diabetes, pregnancy and hormonal changes that occur during menopause.\u201d\n\nQ: What is the prevalence of CTS in the general population?\n\nA: According to an article in The Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA], \u201cSymptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the hands are common in the general population, suggesting that one in five people who report these symptoms may have carpal tunnel syndrome [CTS].\u201d\n\nQ: Who are the risk takers?\n\nA: According to a recent report form Purdue University, \u201cWhen a person increases the amount of time spent at the keyboard form one hour to four hours a day, they also increase the probability of acquiring CTS from 45% to 92%.\n\nQ: What is the earliest sign?\n\nA: According to Barbara Guse, PT, an authority in cumulative trauma, \u201cThe first symptom is muscle fatigue. Later there is intermittent achiness or burning sensations in the muscles.\u201d Muscle weakness is an early sign in most any soft tissue lesion.\n\nQ: Is CTS a condition of \u201coveruse\u201d?\n\nA: Although it is classified as an overuse injury, Intracell Technology likes to think of it as a failure to recover. A study at the University of Michigan, sponsored by NIOSH, suggested that, \u201cIt is the repetition of tasks without adequate recovery time that causes the inflammation.\u201d\n\nQ: Is hand position a factor?\n\nA: Working with hands bent upward at the wrists or frequently bending the wrists sideways exaggerates the amount of friction inside the carpal passage, requiring longer recovery time.\n\nQ: What limb is most vulnerable?\n\nA: The extremity of dominant use is usually involved. When bilateral, the extremity of dominant use is commonly involved first and is more severe.\n\nQ: How is the diagnosis confirmed?\n\nA: Although a standard criteria for diagnosing the syndrome has not been established, the definitive diagnostic procedure is electrodiagnostic studies of the median nerve. These studies may confirm CTS accurately in most cases, however, false positive tests can and do occur.\n\nQ: What are the cardinal nerve symptoms?\n\nA: Pain, tingling & numbness in the thumb and first 3 fingers.\n\nQ: Does pain and weakness of the fingers and hand always mean CTS?\n\nA: NO \u2013 It has been estimated that fewer than 6% of those reporting symptoms have true CTS.\n\nQ: What is the early treatment?\n\nA: Stabilizing the wrist joint with cock-up splints is a common practice. The Center for Carpal Tunnel Studies in Paradise Valley, AZ, however, reports about 70% improvement of symptoms with myofascial release.\n\nQ: What abut rest periods at work?\n\nA: Russian studies have shown that muscle recovers faster with massage than with rest. This finding is substantiated by Intracell Technology.\n\nQ: Is on the job stretching helpful?\n\nA: When muscle tires it shortens. The goal of traditional stretching is to return muscle to it natural length. Segmental stretching, however, is much more helpful because muscle does not uniformly shorten.\n\nQ: What is segmental stretching?\n\nA: Intracell Technology explains segmental stretching as, \u201cThe art of biomechanically extinguishing barrier trigger points prior to and during traditional stretching.\u201d\n\nQ: How can CTS be avoided?\n\nA: Variation of hand use, which encourages muscle recovery, is a key factor in avoidance. Muscle recovers best with a copious, nutrient-rich blood supply.\n\nScroll to top",

Before you consent, it is essential to have a conversation with the physician (or other provider) who is recommending and\/or performing the procedure so you can fully understand what is involved and have all of your questions answered.\n\nWhat should I know before I give permission for my child's procedure?\n\n  \u2022 What is my child's medical problem?\n  \u2022 What is the proposed procedure, test, or surgery?\n  \u2022 Why is the procedure recommended? How will it help my child?\n  \u2022 What are the serious and common risks of this procedure?\n  \u2022 What will the recovery be like?\n  \u2022 What are the alternatives? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives?\n  \u2022 What would the doctor recommend if I say \"no\" to this procedure?\n  \u2022 What is likely to happen if we do nothing?\n\nIs the procedure guaranteed to work?\n\n  \u2022 No. It is impossible to guarantee the outcome or to eliminate every risk. However, the doctor has recommended the procedure because he\/she thinks the advantages to your child outweigh the risks.\n\nWill my doctor work alone?\n\n  \u2022 Many procedures require more than one pair of hands. Your doctor may be helped by other fully trained doctors, doctors in training, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other healthcare providers. Sometimes the team who assists your doctor will change during the procedure.\n  \u2022 No one can assist your doctor unless they are legally allowed to do so here at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nWho will watch the procedure?\n\n  \u2022 In most cases, nobody will watch except the care team.\n  \u2022 Sometimes there are other observers. The only people who are allowed to watch are medical students on approved training rotations and others who have formal guest privileges at Children's. For example, surgeons from around the world often visit to watch our teams at work.\n\nWhat if I don't want anyone to watch my child's procedure?\n\n  \u2022 Please tell us and we will respect your wishes.\u00a0\n  \u2022 However, please consider that by allowing students and others to watch your child's procedure, you will be helping us train those who will care for the next generation of children.\n\nWhat is \"teach back\"?\n\n  \u2022 The doctor will ask you to explain the procedure back to him\/her to make sure we have done a good job of explaining things to you. We want you to be able to tell us your understanding of:\n    \u2022 what is being done for your child\n    \u2022 the major advantages, and\n    \u2022 any important risks of the procedure.\n\nThe consent form says the doctor may change the plan during the procedure. Is that common?\n\n  \u2022 It is rare for the doctor to change the plan during a procedure. In most cases, the doctor would contact you in the family waiting area before making a major change in plan.\n  \u2022 Sometimes doctors will find something they were not expecting and need to change the plan.\n  \u2022 In an emergency, the doctors will respond immediately, and may not have time to contact you first.\n  \u2022 Emergencies are rare. However, our job is to prepare for any event, no matter how uncommon\n\nWhy would my child need blood or blood products? What are the risks?\nBlood and blood products are given to improve the oxygen supply to the body. They help to correct bleeding problems and can be life-saving.\n  \u2022 Sometimes blood is donated by the patient in advance of a procedure for his\/her own need, but usually blood is given by healthy volunteer donors. Donated blood is tested for many diseases including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), viruses that cause hepatitis (Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus), West Nile Virus, and syphilis. This screening and testing means that the chance of catching a disease from blood is extremely low.\u00a0\n  \u2022 There is a small chance of developing other reactions from transfusions, such as allergies, fevers, complications from too much fluid in the bloodstream, lung injury, and reactions from receiving incompatible blood. These reactions are generally treatable and patients almost always recover quickly and completely. However, in rare cases, patients can die from a complication from a blood transfusion.\n  \u2022 You have the right to refuse a blood transfusion. Refusing a blood transfusion may be risky because it may limit the kind of treatment that your child can safely receive. If you are considering refusing a transfusion, please discuss with your doctor what that would mean for your child's health and treatment.\n\nWhat does it mean that my child's tissues will be tested?\n\n  \u2022 Tissues that are removed during surgery are tested and examined by a special physician (pathologist) to ensure there are no unexpected problems. This examination is an essential part of your child's care.\n\nWhat does it mean that my child's tissues may be used for research?\n\n  \u2022 Boston Children's Hospital, like other research hospitals, may use tissue (that would otherwise be disposed of) for research into causes and cures for disease or for teaching purposes. Any tissue that we use for research will be de-identified, which means that we can not identify which patient it came from.\n\nWhat does it mean that pictures or video may be taken?\n\n  \u2022 In many procedures, pictures or video records of the findings are considered \"standard\" and are needed for best care. For example, doctors may need pictures to tell if your child's condition has changed over time.\n  \u2022 Pictures and video are used only to care for your child, or to teach others. When they are used for teaching purposes, all identifying information (such as names and addresses) is removed.\n\nI don't agree with some parts of the consent. What should I do?\n\n  \u2022 Tell your doctor. Some parts may be crossed out before you sign. Other parts (such as permission for my doctor to change the plan if he\/she finds other problems during the procedure) cannot be removed.\n\nWho should sign the consent form?\n\n  \u2022 If the patient is over 18 and legally competent (able to understand), the patient should sign.\n  \u2022 If the patient is too young to understand, the parent\/guardian should sign.\n  \u2022 If the patient is old enough to understand (often about age 12), but under 18, it is usually best for both the patient and the parent\/guardian to sign.\n  \u2022 Are there any special circumstances determining who should sign the consent form?\n  \u2022 If the parent does not have legal custody of a child for any reason, the legal guardian should sign.\n  \u2022 If the patient is over 18, but is not competent to understand, a court order may be needed to appoint a guardian who can sign on the patient's behalf.\nIf the patient is a \"mature\" or \"emancipated\" minor, he\/she may have legal authority to consent without the parent or guardian's knowledge.\n\nTo download a copy of this document, please click\u00a0here.
