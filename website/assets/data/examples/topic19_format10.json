        "text":"Ocean Action Hub\n\n25 Sept 2019 -\u00a0Growing coastal flooding is inevitable, and damage to corals and other marine life has already been unleashed. But scientists say the world still has time to avert even more severe consequences.\n\nClimate change is already having staggering effects on oceans and ice-filled regions that encompass 80 percent of the Earth, and future damage from rising seas and melting glaciers is now all but certain, according to a\u00a0sobering new report\u00a0from the United Nations.\n\nThe warming climate is killing coral reefs, supercharging monster storms, and fueling deadly marine heat waves and record losses of sea ice. And Wednesday\u2019s report on the world\u2019s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked.\n\nGiven current emissions levels, a number of serious effects are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nHundred-year floods will become an annual occurrence by 2050 in some cities and small island nations, according to the IPCC. Several of those cities are in the United States, including its second largest, Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWhat more evidence do we need?\" said Eric Garcetti, LA\u2019s mayor, in response to the report. \"These are our streets flooding, these are our homes burning, and in cities, we know this is real, and this is not just about resilience, it\u2019s about adaptability.\u201d\n\nIf emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century \u2014 about 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries.\n\n\u201cAs a result of excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ocean today is higher, warmer, more acidic, less productive and holds less oxygen,\u201d said Jane Lubchenco, a former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \u201cThe conclusion is inescapable: The impacts of climate change on the ocean are well underway. Unless we take very serious action very soon, these impacts will get worse \u2014 much, much worse.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report by the IPCC, which comes on the heels of several other warnings the group has issued recently. Last fall, the IPCC said the world must make rapid, far-reaching changes to energy, transportation and other systems to hold warming below an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, a key threshold in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nCONTINUE READING:\u00a0https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/climate-environment\/2019\/09\/25\/new-un-climate-report-massive-change-already-here-worlds-oceans-frozen-regions\/\n\nNo votes yet\nPublication date:\u00a0\nPublication Organisation:\u00a0\nThe Washington Post\nPublication Author:\u00a0\nChris Mooney and Brady Dennis",

He discovered the female during the first night of Wimmera Catchment Management Authority surveys in the MacKenzie River with a hair tie wrapped around her neck.\n\nJosh says if they hadn't removed the hair tie, she would have died in the next couple of weeks.\nJosh and Queensland PhD student Tamielle Blunt spent three nights in the Grampians for the CMA's annual monitoring of a small, fragile platypus population in late April. The monitoring is part of measuring the impacts of environmental flows which are released into the river.\n\"She had quite a deep wound from where the tie had been rubbing, and was showing signs of poor condition as a result.\n\n\"She was a new juvenile, probably around six months old, so we were thankful to have captured her and get the opportunity to remove the hair tie. She swam off happily when we released her back into the river.\"\n\nJosh says although they often discover rubbish items tangled around platypus around Melbourne, it is the first time they'd ever seen anything like this in the Wimmera surveys.\n\n\"Being a more isolated area, we don't find a lot of rubbish in the MacKenzie River. This shows how something so simple like a hair tie washing into a waterway can impact on our precious wildlife.\"\nJosh discovered another female platypus they hadn't caught before during his second night of surveys.\u00a0\nLocal identity Paul Carracher and his daughter Maddie were there to witness this capture and Josh named the new platypus Maddie.\n\nHeavy rain washed out the surveys on the third night.\n\nWimmera CMA chief executive David Brennan says results are encouraging, with the discovery of two new female platypuses indicating flows in the upper section of the MacKenzie River are having a positive impact.\n\n\"We have all become attached to this small and fragile platypus population, and we have given them names including Dusty, Amber, Ted, Max and Kenzie and now Maddie. It's especially exciting when we discover new females who will be able to breed and further grow this small population.\n\n\"Environmental flows we target to this area will play an important role in maintaining habitat during dry conditions to help keep this population going.\"\n\nJosh also took eDNA samples in the lower section of the MacKenzie River where natural flows from rain last winter and spring, combined with environmental flows, have improved conditions.\n\n\"This section of the river is looking in really good condition at the moment and we're hoping the eDNA results will show that the platypus population has moved further downstream,\" Josh says. \"We haven't captured platypus in this section of the river before via our survey nets, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The eDNA test is highly sensitive and is a much more efficient method for discovering platypus.\"\nEnvironmental water releases in the MacKenzie River are prioritised as part of the Victorian Environmental Water Holder's Seasonal Watering Plan 2016-17 , which aims to improve river and wetland health across the state.\n\nPhotos by Paul Carracher, The Weekly Advertiser\n\nFurther Information\n\nWimmera CMA\nTel: 03 5382 1544\n\nMore News\n\n  \u2022 Vinifera floodplain\n\n    Water for Vinifera\n\n    Water for the environment is being delivered to Vinifera during April and May to support the many waterbirds, microbats, frogs, sugar gliders and wallabies that live on or visit the floodplain.\n\n  \u2022 Working together to bring water to the Moorabool River\n\n    To help combat dry conditions and improve river health and habitat for native fish, the Victorian Environmental Water Holder has secured an additional one-off volume of water for the environment for the Moorabool River.\n\n  \u2022 Update - Water sale in northern Victoria\n\n    The VEWH announced the sale of up to 10 gigalitres of allocation in northern Victoria on 15 March 2019.

The problem, however, is that the Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-4 satellite doesn't even work at all. And it's tumbling about in orbit, on a trajectory to burn-up in orbit. And smash into the Earth.\n\n\n\n\nThe US Department of Defense and other agencies around the world have analyzed the orbital object and have determined that it's in an unstable orbit, and absolutely incapable of functioning in any useful way. Other than as a proof of concept.\n\n\nOf course officials from various countries and the U.N. Security Council are worried that this test is a display of their technological prowess and a secretive way to test technologies that could evolve into better intercontinental ballistic missiles, or even spy satellites.\n\n\nSouth Korea has managed to analyze wreckage from previous failed launches and determined that they used very old technology that was highly unreliable. Around 270 pieces of debris from this current launch are currently being analyzed by the South Korean Defense Ministry.\n\n\nRelated Tags\n\nGot an opinion on this news? Post a comment below!",

        "text":"Vampire bats' secret method of hunting for the best blood uncovered by scientists\n\nTheir reputation for accurately targeting the jugular has earned them legendary status in horror stories.\n\nNow vampire bats\u2019 ability to go straight to the best spots for blood has been explained by science \u2013 they use infrared sensors.\n\nResearchers found the nocturnal creatures, which need to feast on blood almost every day, are guided by a heat-detecting molecule called TRPV1 covering nerve-endings on their noses.\n\nBlood sucker: Vampire bats have infra-red sensors which detect exactly where to bite to extract the largest amount of blood\n\nBlood sucker: Vampire bats have infra-red sensors which detect exactly where to bite to extract the largest amount of blood\n\nThis leads them to areas where blood is flowing close to the skin.\n\nTRPV1 is present in many animals and in humans, allowing them to sense extreme heat.\n\nBut bats have evolved a much more sensitive form,\u00a0 which they can use to detect temperatures from just 30c (86f).\n\nThis allows them to home in on blood vessels from up to 20cm away.\n\nDr David Julius, of the University of California and the study\u2019s author, said: \u2018Vampire bats feed on blood, and it\u2019s useful for them to have an infrared detector to be able to find the circulation.\u2019\n\nElena Gracheva, co-author of a study of Venezuelan bats published yesterday in the journal Nature, said: \u2018Without this adaptation the bats probably wouldn\u2019t survive as a species.\u2019\n\nDr Julius added that because nerve fibres are associated with pain sensation, drug companies were looking at TRPV1 from bats in painkiller development.\n\nHungry bat: They can gorge themselves on half their body weight in blood in just a few minutes\n\nHungry bat: They can gorge themselves on half their body weight in blood in just a few minutes\n\nHe said: \u2018There is a double-edged sword with pain. Pain is necessary as a warning system to let us know when we are in danger of injury but, at the same time, pain can outlive its usefulness as a warning system when it fails to resolve and becomes chronic and debilitating.\n\n\n  \u2022 Their bizarre diet is thought to be evolutionary - at some point their regular food source may have been wiped out and their bodies have adapted to an entirely liquid diet which fascinates experts.\n  \u2022 A typical bat weighs 40g and can consume over 20g of blood (2 fluid ounce) in a 20-minute feed. As they feast on large animals, their attacks on animals are not usually fatal.\n  \u2022 Dozens if not hundreds of people have been killed by their bites in South America but they die from rabies not blood loss. They bite humans when their usual livestock such as cattle are taken away.\n  \u2022 Despite their scary reputation vampire bats are one of the most caring and social creatures - doting on their young and unlike other bats, even taking in and feeding orphans so they don\u2019t die.\n  \u2022 A 2003 study found an anti-coagulant drug derived from bat saliva called desmoteplase can help stroke patients.\n  \u2022 Despite the association with Dracula, there are no vampire bats in Europe, only in the Americas.\n  \u2022 Vampire bats live in groups of up to 1,000 in dark places such as caves and mineshafts and their communities involve a few males and a harem of around 25 females each.\n  \u2022 They live around nine years in the wild, but without blood can starve to death in as little as 48 hours.\n\n'There is a lot of stuff in our environment that we want to stay away from.\u2019\n\nOnce locked on to their prey, the bats can gorge themselves on half their body weight in blood in just a few minutes.\n\nAnd as the only creatures to survive purely on blood, it explains how they have evolved to be such efficient hunters.\n\nThey feed only at night and because their teeth have no enamel, they are razor-sharp and can delicately cut through the skin of their prey \u2013 usually sleeping cows or goats \u2013 without waking them.\n\nLike other types of bats they have excellent night vision, and acute hearing, as well as an ability to emit high-pitched sounds which helps them navigate.\n\nBut it was not previously known that they could effectively \u2018see\u2019 veins by heat-sensing them, Dr Julius explained.\n\nHe and his fellow researchers looked at wild vampire bats in Venezuela where they are common, as well as in most of South and Central America.\n\nOnce they have located a vein and made an incision, their saliva is injected into the victim, as it contains anti-coagulants which stop the blood clotting around the wound.\u00a0\n\nThey have grooves in their tongue which draw up the blood through capillary action and it passes through their system at lightning speed to allow them to fly away immediately.\n\nPrevious studies have shown vampire bats are genetically more similar to mammals such as cows, horses and dogs than they are to rodents, although they look rather like rats with wings.\n\nThey can fly but unlike other bats they have strong hind legs and often land and gallop towards their prey at speeds of up to 5miles an hour.\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nWho is this week's top commenter?

The gigantic fish is over 5.5 meters long and as thick as an average male adult! Miss Santana found the herring king on the sandy seabed during her snorkeling session. Now the diving instructor is the local celebrity, since no fish of such tremendous size has ever been found either by scientists or by local fishermen.\n\nEnormous herring king is the largest specimen ever found in California\n\nIt took 15 men to carry the herring king ashore. Later on, the fish was transported to the local Sea Instutute. The head of the research group was specifically astonished by the size of the specimen. After a short examination the herring king will be preserved at a local national history museum. By the way, the herring king is not related to real herring by any means. It acquired its name from the fishermen who often trauled these fish along with the herring schools.",

They reveal a highly classified program codenamed Bullrun, which according to the reports relied on a combination of \"supercomputers, technical trickery, court orders, and behind-the-scenes persuasion\" to undermine basic staples of Internet privacy, including virtual private networks (VPNs) and the widely used secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) protocols.\n\n\"For the past decade, NSA has led an aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption technologies,\" the NYT reported, quoting a 2010 memo describing a briefing of NSA capabilities to employees of the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ. \"Cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming online. Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable.\"\n\nWhen British analysts were briefed on the success, according to another memo, \"those not already briefed were gobsmacked!\" the NYT added.\n\nThe newly aired documents underscore the difficult balancing act that intelligence agencies must perform when monitoring terrorists and other state enemies. While officials say the ability to decode communications intercepted from suspects is crucial to national security, critics warn that the undermining of widely used encryption technologies could have an unintended boomerang effect that harms US companies and citizens.\n\n\"The risk is that when you build a backdoor into systems, you're not the only one to exploit it,\" Matt Green, a Johns Hopkins professor specializing in cryptography, told the NYT. \"Those backdoors could work against US communications, too.\"\n\nBruce Schneier, an encryption specialist and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, told The Guardian,\u00a0\"Cryptography forms the basis for trust online. By deliberately undermining online security in a short-sighted effort to eavesdrop, the NSA is undermining the very fabric of the Internet.\"\n\nNeither report made clear exactly how the intelligence agencies are bypassing VPNs, SSL, and TLS, which are all presumed to provide nearly impenetrable cryptographic assurance when used correctly. But the NYT specifically mentions all three\u2014as well as an unspecified protection used in 4G smartphones\u2014as being the focus of the NSA's most intensive efforts.\n\nSimilarly, for three years, the GCHQ looked into ways to decode encrypted traffic from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Yahoo. By 2012, the British agency developed \"new access opportunities\" into Google systems, the paper reported. By 2010, a GCHQ counterencryption program, dubbed Edgehill, aspired or was able\u2014the NYT and The Guardian seem to disagree on this point\u2014to decode VPN traffic for 30 targets and set a goal of an additional 300 by 2015.\n\nThe reports also discuss the intelligence agencies working to get Internet companies' help in decrypted traffic by eliciting their voluntary cooperation, forcing their cooperation through court orders, or hacking into their networks to steal encryption keys or surreptitiously alter their software or hardware. Documents provided by Snowden said the NSA spends $250 million per year on a Sigint Enabling Project that \"actively engages the US and foreign IT industries to covertly influence and\/or overtly leverage their commercial products' designs\" to make them exploitable. Earlier this year, the program found ways inside \"some of the encryption chips\" used by businesses and governments, either by working with chipmakers to insert backdoors or by surreptitiously exploiting existing security flaws, the NYT said.\n\nThe paper went on to describe the covert hand NSA agents played in \"deliberately weakening the international encryption standards adopted by developers.\" It cited a goal in a 2013 budget request to \"influence policies, standards, and specifications for commercial public key technologies. The report\u2014written by Nicole Perlroth, Jeff Larson, and Scott Shane\u2014said, \"Cryptographers have long suspected that the agency planted vulnerabilities in a standard adopted in 2006 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States\u2019 encryption standards body, and later by the International Organization for Standardization, which has 163 countries as members.\"\n\nExpand full story\n\nYou must to comment.",

Choose Mackerel Over Shrimp\n\nA fisherman pulls a basket filled with anchovies aboard a fishing boat off of Peru's northern port of Chimbote, in 2012. Peru is the world's top fishmeal exporter, producing about a third of worldwide supply.\nA fisherman pulls a basket filled with anchovies aboard a fishing boat off of Peru's northern port of Chimbote, in 2012. Peru is the world's top fishmeal exporter, producing about a third of worldwide supply.\n\nSmall fatty fish like mackerel, herring, sardines and anchovies are high in omega-3s, vitamin D and low on the food chain.\n\nThose shining attributes have earned them plenty of nods from doctors and environmentalists alike, as we've reported. They're not among the most popular seafoods in the U.S., though, partly because of their fishy taste.\n\nBut if you knew that eating these fish would mean shrinking your carbon footprint a wee bit, would that convince you to buy them over say, that bag of frozen shrimp you just mindlessly threw into your grocery cart?\n\nRobert Parker is betting that if you care about eating greener, you'll want to know about how much fuel it takes to catch your favorite fish. He's a Ph.D. candidate from Nova Scotia, studying the fishing industry at the University of Tasmania in Australia.\n\nParker and Peter Tyedmers, who directs the School for Resource and Environmental Studies at Dalhousie University in Halifax, recently published an analysis of a fishing industry fuel use database Tyedmers developed. Their analysis finds that fisheries producing the small fish \u2013 sardines, mackerel, and anchovies \u2014 are \"among the most energy and carbon-efficient forms of protein production.\" The paper appeared in the journal Fish and Fisheries on July 4.\n\nThey also found that fishing for shrimp and lobster are almost as fuel-intensive as raising livestock. As we've reported, raising livestock has more of an impact on the environment than any other food we eat.\n\nFor example, Parker says, to catch a metric ton (about 2,200 pounds) of sardines or anchovies, it takes about 5 gallons of fuel.\n\nIn contrast, to get the same amount of lobster or shrimp, you'd burn an average of 2,100 to 2,600 gallons of fuel.\n\nNow, U.S. and Canadian lobster outfits \"are a bit more efficient because of the higher lobster biomass in the ocean,\" he says. But they are still burning close to 264 gallons of fuel to catch those 2,200 pounds of crustacean.\n\nSo why is all this fuel getting burned? As the fishing industry has evolved in the last century from throwing out a few lines over the local dock to industrialized operations, we've been able to fish in more parts of the ocean and freeze our catch right on the boats.\n\nBut \"a consequence of many of these advancements has been the increased reliance of fisheries on larger vessels, the motorization of fishing fleets with more powerful engines and the increased demand by fisheries for fossil fuels to power everything from propulsion and gear operation to on-board processing, refrigeration and ancillary services such as navigational aids,\" the paper says.\n\nAnd the boats \u2013 not the packing plants or trucks transporting fish to the store \u2014 are where the bulk of the burn comes from, Parker says. The energy needed to get fish to the dock accounts for 60 to 90 percent of the fishing industry's total energy use and emissions.\n\n\"Fuel is the second biggest cost\" in fish production, says Parker, and labor is first, so to encourage more efficient fisheries \u2013 and fewer greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 we should be \"implementing measures shown to decrease fuel consumption.\"\n\nAnd what people do with the fish is inefficient, too. Much of the mackerel, sardines and anchovies get turned to livestock and aquaculture feed, rather than going right to hungry humans. So we're \"taking an efficient system and making it part of an average or inefficient system,\" he says.\n\nBut getting more people to eat these fish is a tough sell, at least on this side of the Atlantic. Parker himself admits that he wasn't always a herring fan, but on a trip to Denmark, that's what was served at the hotel breakfast, so he gave it a try.\n\nNow, he's a believer. \"If you have pickled herring, it's one of the most delicious things,\" he says.\n\nParker acknowledges that his fuel and fishing study has some limitations. For starters, its largely built from fisheries data from Europe and Australia, where the best records are kept, as well as some from North America. The databasedoes not have much data on fuel use and fishing in the developing world \u2014 yet.\n\nAlso, he notes, fisheries are not generally giant offenders when it comes to the food system's carbon emissions. \"Fisheries in general have a relatively low carbon footprint when it comes to food ... they don't have [the] methane associated with cows, and feed costs,\" he says.\n\nBut they hope their work goes beyond emissions. \"We're looking at all the different factors now \u2013 we need to feed people, we need to support rural communities, we need to provide healthy and high quality food to people \u2013 one niche issue is the role of fisheries in fuel consumption.\"\n\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

But they say that in the future, the worms could be manipulated to produce flesh-coloured or reddish silk.\n\nIn nature, silkworm cocoon colours vary from white, yellow, straw, salmon, pink to green.\n\nThe colours in the silk are from natural pigments absorbed when the silkworms eat mulberry leaves.\n\nAnd the genetics behind this ability to extract natural pigments is crucial, the scientists say.\n\nFor instance, a gene known as 'yellow blood' or Y gene enables silkworms to extract carotenoids, yellow-coloured compounds, from mulberry leaves.\n\nAnd worms that have a mutated Y gene, where a segment of DNA is deleted, cannot do this so produce white silk.\n\nInsects with this mutation produce a non-functional form of the carotenoid-binding protein (CBP), known to aid pigment uptake.\n\nUsing genetic engineering techniques, the researchers introduced pristine Y genes into the mutant insects.\n\nThe engineered worms produced working CBP and yellow-coloured cocoons.\n\nThe yellow colour became more vivid after rounds of crossbreeding, the researchers say.\n\nTags: genetics",

        "text":"Hundreds of millions of miles away, in the orbit of Saturn, on the surface of Titan, the planet\u2019s largest moon, rests a piece of human-made technology. Huygens, a nine-foot-wide, saucer-shaped probe, was dropped by the passing Cassini spacecraft and parachuted down to the surface in 2005. For a precious 72 minutes after it landed, Huygens transmitted data back to Earth, including image after image of its surroundings. There they were\u2014gullies, the kind that on Earth are etched into rocky terrain by flowing water. Scientists watched, enthralled, as views of an alien land flashed across computer screens, marking humanity\u2019s first look at the surface of a moon that wasn\u2019t their own.\n\nThen Huygens, out of battery power, went dead; its demise was, as grim as it seems, part of the plan. Huygens remains in the spot where it landed, a dusty monument to the desire to glimpse, even briefly, the worlds in our solar system.\n\nBut a new piece of technology may be on its way. Not to land on Titan, but to hover\u2014getting just close enough to reveal secrets.\n\nA mission to send a drone-like spacecraft to study Titan received approval and funding from NASA Wednesday. Dragonfly, a dual-quadcopter, would launch in the mid-2020s and, upon arrival, hop from one spot over Titan\u2019s surface to the next, searching for signs of life.\n\nThe funding comes from NASA\u2019s New Frontiers program, a competition for exploration proposals that has produced several well-known and successful robotic missions in the solar system: New Horizons, which flew past Pluto in 2015; Juno, which currently orbits Jupiter; and OSIRIS-REx, which is on its way to an asteroid called Bennu, where it will carve out some surface material and return the sample back to Earth. The Dragonfly mission, led by Elizabeth Turtle, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory, now has $4 million and one year to complete its concept. So does the second mission NASA approved today, the Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return (CAESAR) that would target a comet that approaches the sun about every six-and-a-half years. But only one of these missions will actually launch\u2014NASA will choose between them in 2019.\n\nTitan, the largest of Saturn\u2019s moons, has long mystified scientists. The moon is wrapped in a dense, planetlike atmosphere mostly made of nitrogen. Spacecraft like Voyager 1 and Cassini have detected a plethora of complex and organic molecules in the atmosphere that are also found on Earth. Robotic missions have also revealed Titan has a similar liquid process to the water cycle on Earth, but with a different chemical compound: methane, the main ingredient of natural gas. On Titan, methane clouds release methane rains that feed methane lakes and seas and streams that can erode the rocky landscapes. This makes Titan, like Earth, an ocean world. All together, these features mean Titan is one of the best candidates for life in our solar system.\n\nBut, aside from Huygens, the imaging instruments on spacecraft that have visited Saturn\u2019s orbit have been unable to penetrate Titan\u2019s hazy atmosphere, and the composition of its surface remains largely unknown.\n\nDragonfly, should it take flight, will carry equipment capable of identifying chemical components important to biological processes. It will search for signatures of hydrocarbon-based life-forms and water and check for signs of progress in prebiotic chemistry\u2014the transformation of simple molecules into complex life. It will carry cameras that will help the copter choose future landing sites and, of course, send home potentially beautiful, high-resolution images. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly looking for five-legged creatures running around or something like that,\u201d Peter Bedini, the program manager for Dragonfly, said during a talk in July. \u201cAlthough if we did confront one of those, we\u2019d be sure to take a selfie and send it home.\u201d\n\nThe support for the Dragonfly mission is a boon to astrobiologists seeking signs of life on other ocean worlds, like Enceladus, another Saturnian moon, and Europa, a moon of Jupiter. On these moons, potential oceans lurk under thick crusts of ice, perhaps teeming with microbes and other life-forms.\n\nThe drone-like design of Dragonfly is unusual given the previous roster of robots sent to explore the solar system, like the suite of landers and rovers that have traveled to Mars since the 1970s. But \u201cthe dense, calm atmosphere and low gravity [of Titan] make flying an ideal means to travel to different areas of the moon,\u201d the Dragonfly team explains. Aerial probes can cover more ground than rovers. Mars rovers like Curiosity and Opportunity have a top speed of less than one mile per hour, and are not built to maneuver over particularly rough terrain. After five years on Mars, Curiosity\u2019s wheels show some significant damage from crunching over rock. As NASA pushes forward with the exploration of worlds whose surfaces are less understood than that of Mars, scientists and engineers may need to rethink the hardware best suited for exploration.\n\n\u201cIn just a few flights, Dragonfly will be able to go farther than the Opportunity rover on Mars has in the last 12 years,\u201d Bedini said.",
