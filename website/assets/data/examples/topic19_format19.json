Either of the two points on the celestial sphere where the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun) crosses the celestial equator. \u25c7 The point at which the Sun's path crosses the celestial equator moving from south to north is called the vernal equinox. The vernal equinox marks the zero point in both the equatorial and ecliptic coordinate systems; horizontal angular distances (right ascension in the equatorial system and celestial longitude in the ecliptic system) are measured eastward from this point. The vernal equinox is also known as the first point of Aries because when first devised some 2,000 years ago this point occurred at the beginning of Aries in the zodiac. Because of the westward precession of the equinoxes, the vernal equinox is now located at the beginning of Pisces. \u25c7 The point at which the Sun's path crosses the celestial equator moving from north to south is called the autumnal equinox.\n\n  2. Either of the two corresponding moments of the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator. The vernal equinox occurs on March 20 or 21 and the autumnal equinox on September 22 or 23, marking the beginning of spring and autumn, respectively, in the Northern Hemisphere (and the reverse in the Southern Hemisphere).

S.), which conducted research documenting the toque macaque of Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. The research was mostly performed by Research Associate Wolfgang P. J. Dittus, Director of the Smithsonian Primate Biology Program in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. The present folder contains research forms showing trap data for the group of studied macaques called \"troop CF\". The forms show ID initials and number, sex, weight, date trapped, date released, time processed, time trapped, time released, time bled, initial dose, subsequent doses, data on age and reproductive state, medical and dental data from samples and blood tests, fat folds, scars and wounds, with additional remarks and examinations, including on parasites. The forms are dated from July 27 to 28, 1987.\n\nDate Range\n\n\nStart Date\n\nJul 27, 1987\n\nEnd Date\n\nJul 28, 1987\n\nAccess Information\n\nMany of SIA's holdings are located off-site, and advance notice is recommended to consult a collection.
