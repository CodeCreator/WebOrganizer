Competitors come from 45 states and 47 countries, with more than 400,000 visitors and $560,000 in prizes. The art, both indoors and out, covers about 3 square miles of Grand Rapids.\n\nTwo artists who were finalists for May's Cincinnati Pitch Night prize will create versions of the installations they designed for the pitch:\n\nCatherine Richards' \"Valance\" is one of two works that will be installed on Blue Bridge, a popular Grand Rapids pedestrian bridge. Richards, an architect and artist, has designed an circular, interactive structure. The exterior is created from laser-etched plexiglass mirrors and a highly-engineered internal support structure will feature lighting that will allow the experience to change at night.\n\nShe will reinstall the structure in a Solway Gallery space after ArtPrize. Richards is raising money via Kickstarter to fund her project. Search Kickstarter Valance.\n\nJenny Ustick has been invited to install her \"Metanoia: You Are Here\" at Ah-Nab-Awen Park, a green space on the west side of the Grand River adjacent to the Gerald R.

        "text":"AN extravaganza in marble modernism, the Goelet Building at the southwest corner of 49th Street and Fifth Avenue, has had architectural pilgrims gaping since it was built in 1932. The Landmarks Preservation Commission has proposed the building, now known as the Swiss Center, for designation, but the owner, Sarah Korein, objects, saying she wants to add six floors.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the Goelet family had become prominent merchants and soon emerged as second only to the Astors as landowners, according to an article on the family by Brooks Peters in Quest magazine of March 1989.\n\nIn 1882, Ogden Goelet built a mansion at 608 Fifth Avenue at the southwest corner of 49th. He died in 1897 but the house remained standing until the death of his widow in 1929. The Goelets rarely sold land and in 1930 the family chose to erect a new structure on the site adaptable for use as offices, a single department store or small shops, largely because the pending development of Rockefeller Center made it difficult to forecast the most desirable use.\n\nThe columns on the first floor were set in to allow uninterrupted show-window space and the second floor was hung from the third to increase head room in the first-floor area. But it is the styling of 608 Fifth Avenue that sets it apart -- way apart.\n\nPerhaps the term \"geometric moderne\" is fairly close, but it still doesn't do justice to what the marble trade magazine Through The Ages called \"a modernist's dream\" in 1932.\n\nThe building is one giant Art Moderne cigarette case of marble -- Dover white at the floor levels; deeply veined verde antique green at the store levels, the crown and in vertical strips, and Yule Colorado golden at the door, all accented by aluminum trim. The bronze doorway was designed after the Goelet family coat of arms and was said to have cost $14,000.\n\nInside, the lobby is an explosion of zig-zag modernism and different marbles -- aurora rossa, samosa golden, American pavonazzo, bleu belge, numidian red and Belgian black, under an aluminum ceiling. It's a key stop on the walking tours given by the geologist Sidney Horenstein, architecturally both exhilarating and exhausting.\n\nThe design of the building is subject to competing claims. Roy Clinton Morris, an architect who did other Art Moderne work, actually filed the building application for the Goelet family. But he did so as an agent for Edward H. Faile, an engineer who subsequently did other work for the family. Mr. Faile is also known for his 270 Broadway office building of 1930, unusually austere on the outside but with a highly decorative lobby.\n\nBut the article in Through The Ages credits only the architect Victor L.S. Hafner, making no mention of Mr. Faile or Mr. Morris. Charles Savage, an architectural historian at the Landmarks Preservation Commission, has determined that Mr. Faile, a Cornell graduate, began his practice in 1925 and employed Mr. Hafner for a year and a half.\n\nJust how \"modern\" was the Goelet building in its own time?\n\nLewis Mumford considered it absurd, sarcastingly calling it \"an excellent period reproduction -- Modernique, 1925\" in his New Yorker column in 1931. He considered it a retardataire holdover of the Art Deco of the 1920's. Indeed, there is an awkward, ungainly quality to the massing and in the restless conflict between the vertical and horizontal elements of the design; the rich facade does not compliment the structure itself.\n\nBUT with the advantage of hindsight it is possible to see something of the emerging Bauhaus style in the design. In his guidebook \"The City Observed: New York,\" Paul Goldberger calls it \"A real marvel -- New York's real early modern gem.\" But its flashy luxury still sets it outside of the early modern movement, which was dominated by a spartan, intellectual elitism.\n\nPeriod photographs show that the ground floor was at first leased out to small shops, but by the 1960's most had been taken by John David, a men's store. In 1966, the architect Lester Tichy added a bronze screen to the storefronts, but the building's exterior is otherwise largely intact, as is the lobby.\n\nIn 1985, the landmarks agency calendered the building but did not designate it and a new hearing was held this year. Mrs. Korein, the owner, says she objects to the designation because the lease of the Swiss Center, which rents the entire building, will expire in six years and she wants to be able to build an additional six floors, which she says is permitted under current zoning.\n\nThe commission has held as many as three separate hearings on some structures, so for the Goelet Building the second time around is no guarantee of any resolution.\n\nPhoto: The Goelet Building on Fifth Avenue at 49th Street in 1931.

        "text":"Picasso painting, Giacometti sculpture could break auction records\n\nEmployees of Christie's auction house stand by the Picasso painting titled \"Les Femmes d'Algers\" in Hong Kong on April 1, 2015. The painting was shown ahead of its May 11, 2015 sale in to be held in New York which could see it fetch the world record for any work of art ever sold at auction.\n\n\nNEW YORK -- With collectors' appetite for masterpieces of impressionist, modern and contemporary art seemingly unbounded, two works are poised to challenge world auction records on Monday.\n\nPicasso's \"Women of Algiers (Version O),\" a vibrant, multi-hued painting featuring a scantily attired female amid smaller nudes, could sell for more than $140 million, becoming the most expensive work of art at auction, according to Christie's. The evening sale also features Alberto Giacometti's life-size sculpture \"Pointing Man\" for an estimated $130 million. That could earn it the title of most expensive sculpture sold at auction.\n\nExperts say the once unthinkable prices are driven by artworks' investment value and by wealthy new and established collectors seeking out the very best works.\n\n\"I don't really see an end to it, unless interest rates drop sharply, which I don't see happening in the near future,\" Manhattan dealer Richard Feigen said.\n\nImpressionist and modern artworks continue to corner the market because \"they are beautiful, accessible and a proven value. ... Prices for works from these periods only seen to go up each auction cycle and the reputations of the artists become further enshrined ... Today the works epitomize the conservative, moneyed establishment.\" added Sarah Lichtman, professor of design history and curatorial studies at The New School.\n\n\"I think we will continue to see the financiers seeking these works out as they would a blue chip company that pays reliable dividends for years to come.\"\n\nThe Picasso and Giacometti are among two dozen blue chip pieces from the 20th century that Christie's is offering in a curated sale titled \"Looking Forward to the Past.\"\n\n\"Women of Algiers,\" once owned by the American collectors Victor and Sally Ganz, was inspired by Picasso's fascination with the 19th-century French artist Eugene Delacroix. It is part of a 15-work series Picasso created in 1954-1955 designated with the letters A through O. It has appeared in several major museum retrospectives of the artist.\n\nThe most expensive art work sold at auction currently is held by Francis Bacon's \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud,\" which Christie's sold for $142.4 million in 2013.\n\n\"Pointing Man,\" depicting a skinny 5-foot-high bronze figure with extended arms, has been in the same private collection for 45 years. Giacometti, who died in 1966, made six casts of the work; four are in museums, the others are in private hands and a foundation collection. His \"Walking Man I\" holds the auction record for a sculpture. It sold in 2010 for $104.3 million.\n\nAmong other highlights at Christie's is Peter Doig's \"Swamped,\" a 1990 painting of a solitary canoe in a moonlit lagoon that could set a record for the British artist. It is estimated to fetch around $20 million. The current record is $18 million.\n\nMonet's \"The Houses of Parliament, At Sunset,\" a lush painting of rich blues and magenta created in 1900-1901, is estimated to bring $35 million to $45 million. The current Monet auction record is his 1919 \"Water Lily Pond,\" which sold for $80.5 million in 2008.\n\nChristie's also has a Rothko for sale. \"No. 36 (Black Stripe),\" which has never appeared at auction, is estimated to sell for $30 million to $50 million. The 1958 work is being sold by the German collector Frieder Burda, who exhibited it in his museum in Baden-Baden for several years.\n\nLast year, Christie said its global sales of impressionist and modern art was $1.2 billion, an increase of 19 percent over the previous year.\n\nIn November, CBS MoneyWatch reported that a recent Sotheby's auction earned $422.1 million in sales, the highest total in the 248-year-old auction house's history. Longtime rival Christie's sold $165.6 million worth of Impressionist and modern art during another recent auction.\n\n\"The strength of the stock market has some effect on the art market as it does every market,\" according to a Christie's statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch in November. \"However, to a larger degree, the confidence we are seeing in art investment is due to the consistently strong auction results we are seeing season after season, and a growing interest in owning important objects and works of art.\"",

        "text":"Banksy just made two incredible new murals in London\n\nIn honour of American street artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, Banksy has unveiled two new murals near London\u2019s Barbican Centre, an area known to be graffiti-free (or at least now it used to be).\n\nThe elusive artist\u2019s works were spotted in a tunnel close to the city\u2019s biggest performing arts venue. Both mark the opening of an exhibition dedicated to Basquiat, who died at age 27 in 1988 from a suspected drug overdose.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Banksy confirmed that the murals are his, and that the pieces are part of an \u201c(unofficial) collaboration\u201d between the two artists.\n\nHis first post features a Ferris wheel with Baquiat\u2019s trademark crowns adorning it. The caption reads: \u201cMajor new Basquiat show opens at the Barbican \u2013 a place that is normally very keen to clean any graffiti from its walls.\u201d\n\nThe second post shows an artwork inspired by Basquiat\u2019s 1982 work Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump. The caption reads: \u201cPortrait of Basquiat being welcomed by the Metropolitan Police \u2013 an (unofficial) collaboration with the new Basquiat show.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition, which comes nearly 30 years since Basquiat passed away, will have more than 100 works from different creatives. The event, taking place from September 21, will be the biggest ever UK celebration on the artist.",

        "text":"UMMA spring shows stitch together craft and fine art\n\nBy Aislinn Sarnacki, BDN Staff\nPosted April 05, 2012, at 4:37 p.m.\n\nA battle between craft and contemporary art is being waged at the University of Maine Museum of Art in Bangor this spring with exhibits by Maine sculptor Jemma Gascoine and New York artist Ruth Marshall. Both shows shun categorization and raise questions about societal value of functional craft.\n\nA third spring exhibit, a provocative and mysterious retrospective show by Boston-based photographer John Goodman, further shakes things up. All three shows, including a rotation of the museum\u2019s permanent collection, run through June 9.\n\nEnter the tigers\u2019 den\n\nDouble glass doors close with a decisive thud, and visitors are in a poacher\u2019s lair. Wildcat pelts, spotted and striped, rise up, stretched across bamboo frames, replacing the pristine museum walls. Surrounded with the exotic skins of endangered species, visitors may at first be startled, disgusted even, but upon closer examination, the \u201cpelts\u201d are actually made of wool yarn.\n\n\u201cI really want people to understand how beautiful these animals are, and I also want them to understand how endangerment and violence is part of the display. It\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d said Australian-born Marshall, creator of the meticulously knitted life-size displays. She arrived Monday in Maine to install her work.\n\nStory continues below advertisement.\n\n\u201cVanished into Stitches,\u201d an installation of 14 replicated skins of tigers, leopards and jaguars, is much more than first meets the eye.\n\nEach piece is a near exact replica of a specific animal. Wild cats have unique asymmetrical patterns of spots and stripes. Marshall was granted special access to the mammal collection at the American Museum of Natural History so she could base her works on the markings of specific skins. She spent days researching and mapping out freehand drawings of the aged specimens, tucked away in metal drawers.\n\n\u201cThese tigers were hunted and killed for exhibit displays or to be placed in zoos,\u201d she said. \u201cI like the whole loop in the story \u2014 what we have done with these animals in the past and what we are still doing today.\u201d\n\nMarshall\u2019s love for animals grew as she befriended the inhabitants of the Bronx Zoo, where she worked as an exhibit artist from 1995 to 2009, after receiving a master\u2019s of fine art in sculpture from the Pratt Institute in New York City.\n\n\u201cI did everything from sculpting a rock to cover an ugly drain, to creating a tree with scratches in it to show how lemurs mark their territory, to making toys for tigers to play with,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the zoo she typically worked with a variety of metals, plastics and paint, but as an artist, she learned that these materials didn\u2019t suit her style. Within the past decade, Marshall rediscovered her passion for knitting, a practice from her childhood. Now she aims to stretch its boundaries.\n\nThe African Gaboon Viper \u2014 the snake with the longest fangs and highest venom yield in the world \u2014 was her first animal knitting project. She then knit every species of coral snake \u2014 70-plus snakes of differing patterns.\n\nMarshall\u2019s obsession with detail, both in pattern and hue, made her first cat skin \u2014 one of her housecat, Rocky the tabby, which is now owned by a London-based art collector \u2014 a three-year project. And she plans to continue to expand the collection, though each pelt takes at least three months to complete.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always envisioned a room full of pelts,\u201d she said. \u201cI was never going to just do one tiger. I wanted a whole tribe of tigers to just overwhelm people and drive home the message.\u201d\n\nTiger numbers in the wild are thought to have plunged from 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to between 1,500 and 3,500 today, marking them as an endangered species. Marshall says that a recent report estimates 3,200 tigers existing in the wild.\n\n\u201cI want to talk about issues in art that\u2019s not about art,\u201d she said, \u201cthough I do admire art for art\u2019s sake. I always felt like I needed another layer.\u201d\n\nThe repetitive nature of knitting appeals to Marshall, as does the portability of yarn and needles. While studying Asian Tigers at the Berlin Zoo, she was about to start working on the first day of her residency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to take knitting as a craft and use that craft in a different way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not knitting tiger sweaters, I\u2019m knitting another museum specimen \u2026 I\u2019m trying to inject more meaning into the craft.\u201d\n\nHer works have been exhibited at the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C; Museum of Art and Design in NYC; Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art in Arizona and the San Jose Museum in California, but her collection of wildcat hides will be exhibited for the first time at UMMA.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, no one in Maine will have seen anything like this before,\u201d said UMMA Executive Director George Kinghorn. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s safe to say that no one in the U.S. will have seen anything like this before.\u201d\n\nDancing in the studio\n\nTo create a new body of work for her UMMA solo exhibit \u201cSlab Waltz,\u201d ceramic artist Jemma Gascoine sliced through her recently thrown pottery with wire and fused the pieces to clay slabs, forming contemporary wall art from once-functional objects.\n\n\u201cCraft is often deemed inferior to fine art,\u201d said Gascoine, who was born in England and moved to Maine in 2001. \u201cI\u2019m toying with the boundaries. Within pottery, there\u2019s a lot of tradition; so I\u2019m pushing outside those.\u201d\n\nHer pottery style, minimalist in color and form, doesn\u2019t disappear as she enters the realm of contemporary art. Embedded in clay tiles, her vessels can no longer hold sugar or flowers, but their Byzantine curves and glazed finish echo the functional vessels and bowls displayed on pedestals in the gallery.\n\nGascoine\u2019s works have been exhibited at the Center for Maine Contemporary Art, Susan Maasch Fine Art, North Light Gallery and Lake Hebron Artisans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed not doing functional work for a while,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t value functional work. In fact, at the moment, I\u2019m teaching [at the Piscataquis Valley Adult Education Cooperative] and we\u2019re making mugs.\u201d\n\nDuring the many months spent working on this project, Gascoine shifted back and forth between her potter\u2019s wheel and newly purchased slab roller in her Blanchard, Maine, studio. This movement she came to describe as a dance, a \u201cSlab Waltz.\u201d\n\nGascoine describes the exhibit as \u201ca marriage between art and craft\u201d rather than a battle.\n\n\u201cI hope that the tension between the fine art aspect and craft aspect is something people question,\u201d she said.\n\nFour decades in 40 moments\n\n\u201cMoments Abstracted,\u201d surveys John Goodman\u2019s career through 40 photographs, mostly black and white, which span from 1969-2007.\n\nGoodman has captured fleeting moments in Havana, Tuscany, Las Vegas, Nashville, Coney Island and Boston. And though these photographs are from drastically different places and times, they\u2019re linked by the photographer\u2019s desire and ability to capture mood and movement.\n\nThe works are selected from his acclaimed book \u201cThe Times Square Gym,\u201d of ghostly and grainy images of athletes from all walks of life. Several other works come from his \u201cCombat Zone\u201d series, photographs from Boston\u2019s notorious adult entertainment area in the \u201970.\n\nWhile Goodman\u2019s photography is included in permanent collections in top art museums across the country, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this is his first solo museum exhibition. He is on the faculty of the Art Institute of Boston and also an instructor at the Maine Media Workshops.\n\nAdmission to UMMA is free in 2012 thanks to Machias Savings Bank, in honor of Ted Leonard, who worked to bring the museum to downtown Bangor.

        "text":"Image Credit: Ryan Barrett\n\nOn Thursday, November 1, there was a reception for two new exhibitions that recently opened in the McIninch Art Gallery in Robert Frost Hall. The first is showcasing Modernism and its Legacy, while the second is a collection of works by Nikki Rosato titled Voyager. Missed it? Don\u2019t worry, they will be open for public viewing until December 15.\u00a0\n\nModernism and Its Legacy was curated by Joanna Flink but is being housed by Southern New Hampshire University. This gallery features artwork by Max Beckmann, Pablo Picasso and other contemporary artists that practiced the Modernism art style. Many of the pieces work in tandem with one another to show a sense of movement throughout the room. The goal of this gallery is to portray the vast impact Modernism had on art in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as how the Modernist movement is still impacting art to this day.\n\nThe Voyager series by Nikki Rosato is located right behind the barrier wall in the gallery. Rosato\u2019s unique technique consists of taking silhouettes and filling in the negative space within the image with road maps from different places. This unique and captivating design is meant to symbolize how people tend to define themselves by their own personal sense of place.\n\nBoth exhibitions provide a way for students to gain new understanding of both of these artistic techniques while still being captivated by the artwork.\n\nLeave a Reply",

The exhibit opened on Oct. 1 and will run through the end of the month. Over the past 15 months Lawrence has been shooting waterscapes and wildlife from a boat in the Potomac off of Riverbend Park. The images reflect the beauty of the river in different seasons and the variety of birds that either make the river their permanent home or just stop in for a seasonal visit. Lawrence said, \u201cI especially enjoy shooting birds in flight and as they take off or land. Some fly so fast, especially the smaller ducks, it\u2019s hard to capture the power and grace of their movements.\u201d But Lawrence continues to add to his collection and plans to go out on the river shooting from the Seneca Breaks (off the end of Seneca Road) down to the western tip of Conn Island. He is also hoping for some serious snow and ice this winter to add a new backdrop for the images and to see how the wildlife adapts to the different conditions.\n\nWhile the exhibit of Katie\u2019s Coffee represents only a small portion of his work, Lawrence will be participating in the upcoming Great Falls Studio Tour on Oct. 19 and 20, showing his entire collection at his studio in the Artists\u2019 Atelier located at 1144 Walker Road, Suite G in Great Falls.

He called a recent performance \u201cJe ne travaille jamais.\u201d But the ever-popular Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija (above, right) certainly seems busy \u2014 if not hard-working in the classic, capitalist, petit-bourgeois sense \u2014 during his week-long stay in L.A.\n\nHaving given a talk at Art Center earlier this week, the artist is giving\u00a0another talk next Tuesday at noon at USC.\u00a0And now he's working to finish the installation of his new exhibition at the gallery 1301 PE\u00a0in time for its opening Friday evening.\u00a0\n\nHe has wallpapered the downstairs space with images from his ongoing series of demonstration drawings (based on newspaper images of protests across the world) and carpeted the floors in orange (what gallery owner Brian Butler calls \u201ca Buddhist monk orange\u201d).The upstairs space has a collaboration between Tiravanija and the Belgian artist Nico Dockx, which features an LP playing the sound of making and then erasing (that would be the B side) a demonstration drawing.\n\nThe artist says the show's title, \"Murder and Mayhem,\" comes from a saying he\u2019s used on protest T-shirts in the past. \u201cMurder and mayhem was a description that the BBC used to describe the situation going on in Zimbabwe when Mugabe was refusing to go away after the election. It kind of stuck with me \u2014 because it\u2019s the image of everything going wrong in society.\u201d\n\nThe T-shirts have also spawned another idea, which will bring the artist back to town in October. He will be teaming up with musician-producer Arto Lindsay and public art impresario Emi Fontana of West of Rome to create a performance for the Getty-initiated event Pacific Standard Time. The idea is to stage a meta-protest parade through the streets of downtown L.A.\n\n\u201cIt will be a parade of T-shirts,\u201d says Tiravanija. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get other artists involved and also students \u2014 art students and high school students who could contribute texts for the shirts.\u201d\n\n-- Jori Finkel\n\n\n\nDrinking with Tom Marioni and friends\n\nPacific Standard Time expands\n\nImage: Nico Dockx and Rirkrit Tiravanija at 1301PE.

They were dreamed up by Stuart Sherman, a New York-based artist of national prominence who's in residence at MIT this month.\n\nA man for all media, with a minimal style and a wry sense of humor, Sherman moves easily from sculpture and assemblage to theater, film, and video. Visitors to the List Center can sample his movies and tapes, or see a performance of his latest stage project, ``Chekhov,'' to be given this evening. Sherman tells me it's based on no single Chekhov play but on his overall impression of the Russian author's work.\n\n``Chekhov'' is part of an evolving trilogy on classic playwrights. It will appear at the Performing Garage in New York this spring, and it is expected to have a European tour. Sherman also hopes his earlier ``Classical Trilogy'' -- Hamlet, Faust, and Oedipus -- will have a major New York appearance soon. Only the ``Hamlet'' portion has so far appeared there. Coming too is a major show of Sherman films next month at the Collective for Living Cinema in Manhattan.\n\nof 5 stories this month > Get unlimited stories\nYou've read 5 of 5 free stories\n\nOnly $1 for your first month.\n\nGet unlimited Monitor journalism.",

        "text":"News Briefs\nAugust 23, 2017\n\nStatues something new for Carving Studio\n\nWEST RUTLAND\u2014A statue of a man is taking shape in the Carving Studio and Sculpture Center, a marble worker from more than a century ago. Carol Driscoll, executive director for the Carving Studio, told the Rutland Herald that the statue differs from the type of work most frequently done at the West Rutland site. It\u2019s different because it is classically representational and also because it is a commissioned piece from start to finish.\n\nNamed \u201cStone Legacy,\u201d the work, commissioned by Mark Foley and Green Mountain Power, is anticipated to be first among a series of sculptures bound for downtown Rutland. New York sculptor Kellie Pereira said she studied old photographs of stone workers, observing how they stood and what they wore, including such detail as how they tucked in their shirts. She made a nude version of the sculpture so that she could cover it with clothing accurately.\n\nItalian sculptors Alessandro Lombardo and Andrea Ingrassi are replicating Pereira\u2019s original at three times its size, from what came into the studio as a 10-foot, 11-ton block out of Vermont Quarries in Danby and positioned by a crane.\n\nWest Rutland Town Manager Mary Ann Goulette and Rutland City Mayor David Allaire together unveiled the statue Aug. 17. Project supervisor Steve Shaheen said refinements will continue into late September, with the public encouraged to visit the Carving Studio to see its progress.\n\n\u201cStone Legacy\u201d may require a temporary home for the winter, before Center Street Alley reconstruction is complete enough for the figure\u2019s installation, said Steve Costello, GMP vice president of customer care.\n\nThe stone worker statue is not the only statue taking shape in the West Rutland studio. Sculptor Sean Williams is transforming a 1,500-pound block of marble into a tribute to Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d WCAX-TV reported. The completed sculpture will show the characters Kipling created rising from the pages of an open book. Like \u201cStone Legacy,\u201d Williams\u2019 statue is carved from Danby marble. Kipling wrote the beloved story of Mowgli\u2019s adventures while living in Dummerston, Vt. The work is scheduled to be installed in front of Phoenix Books in downtown Rutland.\n\nA third page from Vermont history is also coming to life in stone, this one depicting Revolutionary War widow, patriot and, briefly, Rutland resident Anne Story, Costello told the Herald. The initial artist design is already underway, with succeeding steps developing a budget and finding a sculptor, with carving to take place next summer, Costello outlined.\n\n Vermont Adaptive\/ Century Ride Banner\n\nShare This Article\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
