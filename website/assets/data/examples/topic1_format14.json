        "text":"Bruce GremoUSAMusic2003\n\n\"Rhythm Plateau\", 2003, screen shot\n\n\nMy stay at Civitella had the character of both a retreat, and of a communal experience with fellows from whom I learned and even collaborated. I accomplished much that I had planned to do. The stimulation that comes from such camaraderie, I had not anticipated. It was a great pleasure. I wrote three new interactive applications for computer and instrumentalist, revised an existing one and wrote a fourth one for a collaboration with a fellow resident, installation artist Charles Goldman. I had over a week of open studio performances in which I tested and tweaked the applications. Output is one measure of productivity, but doesn\u2019t indicate how the quality of the focused and supported time that one has here affects the work made. I would note three things about my own process. First, I spent time working at a level of detail and nuance that I am too frequently unable to address. Second, I was able to pursue musical materials that I had long thought about, but have never had the time to contemplate, listen to, prepare and implement. Third, I found myself designing acoustical space as much as composing and exploring musical material. This interest probably brought me into closer contact with Charles. It seemed natural at one point to make a collaborative installation in the castle. And so we culminated our residencies with a joint work, one that I believe will continue in the near future. In short, the process here was transformative and most welcome.",

        "text":"Roy Mangersnes is a trained behaviouralist and professional wildlife photographer living in Sandnes, southwestern Norway. Roy is a former\u00a0Nikon ambassador and is considered among the most influential nature photographers in Norway today. He has published several books, as well as won multiple international awards including BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2010 and 2011, European Wildlife Photographer of the Year (GDT) 2010, and 2009 and also Nature Best Awards 2012. Roy is working around the world and his images are being published in magazines and books all over. He is also an experienced speaker and has been presenting his work at several international photo festivals. Roy is also being used as a photography teacher on private expedition yachts.\n\nRoy is currently a 500px Brand Ambassador. See 500px profile for details and profile.\n\nRoy is one of the founding photographers of the Penguin World NGO, working to address conservation issues in our oceans, using penguins as ambassadors. As part of the photography team he will be\u00a0doing assignments\u00a0do document the magical world of penguins. Visit the Penguin World website to make a donation.\n\nBeing a conservationist by heart Roy has also been selected to be a photographer in some of the greatest conservation photography projects in the world, the Wild Wonders of China\u00a0and Photographers Against Wildlife Crime. He did an assignment with the VD of the Wild Wonders of China, Staffan Widstrand, to Dehong in Yunnan in April\/May 2017, and has been delivering images and stories to the upcoming book on wildlife crime.\n\nBesides his carer as a photographer Roy is partner and professional photographic host in WildPhoto Travel. He will be doing assignments around the world to destinations ranging from the Arctic to the Antarctic, also visiting destinations in Africa and the Galapagos Island. The company office is in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, where WildPhoto also have opened the northernmost fine-art gallery in the world.\n\n\nFor me nature photography is not all about pleasing my own need to create. Of course being happy with a picture is very important, but very often there is a story behind it that needs to be told. What separates a good image from the rest is when this story is being told to the viewer. If I succeed in telling the story I will be happy. A really good image needs to tell a story, and at best create a response from the receiver. If the image is living through the receiver, and not forgotten, I have really taken a good picture. I am always aware of the message sent through my photography, and consider my camera a very powerful weapon if used correctly. One picture tells more than a thousand words.\n\n\n2 Comments on \u201cAbout\n\n  1.

        "text":"skip to Main Content\n\nArtistic Statement\n\nIn his search for the purest expression, the Belgian photographer Dirk Lambrechts (\u00b0 1962) explores the limits of a formal simplification of an image through a slow work of introspection.\n\nDirk Lambrechts\u2019s photos are a reflection of art history and a personal reflection inspired by the currents that flowed through it.\u00a0An important aspect of Dirk Lambrechts\u2019 work is his quest for simplicity. This leads him to dive more and more into the main spirit of his images.\n\nThis result is conceivable according to him only if the realisation of a series is preceded by a long maturation. Between the birth of an idea and the first shot, the photographer takes the time to think, observe and conduct research to define the most important points of his project.\n\nThis meticulous work is prolonged during the execution by a critical analysis of his first tests that he renews until obtaining the desired result.\n\nFaced with what our eyes see, from time to time our brain chooses to retain only a part of reality. We discover lost details that I focus on, to the point of understanding the essence of their beauty.\n\nFrom this reality, graphic images of great purity are born\n\n\ninstagram \/ facebook\n\nBack To Top",

Most of White's sculptures are welded metal constructions comprised of hundreds of parts and actions. Using his knowledge of flowing water, White controls the splash and creates soothing sounds, which range from a bubbling brook to soft metallic tinkling to a spring rain.\n\nFountains often require several prototypes to perfect the design, with the desired water effect frequently dictating the shape of the sculpture. Charles White began designing with water in 1980 and it is a main concentration in his work today.\n\n  \u2022 Artwork\n  \u2022 Artist Videos",
