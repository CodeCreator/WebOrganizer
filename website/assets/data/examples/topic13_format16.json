The map depicts Alexander's conquests at their fullest extent covering from Alexander's homeland in Macedonia eastwards past Asia Minor and Persia as far as India and south to include Egypt and Arabia. Both the Caspian Sea (Mare Caspium or Hyrcanum) and the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus) are included. The map also notes the route for the march of Alexander, inland through Gedrosia. Alexander lost a huge number of soldiers and supplies during this march through the desert.\n\nThis map depicts the conquests of the Macedonian King Alexander III, called 'The Great,' conqueror of the Persian Empire and at just 30 years old, ruler of one of the largest empires in history. Alexander the Great was undefeated in battle and is considered one of the most successful military commanders of all time.\n\nThis map was created by William Hughes, printed by J. Bien and engraved by G.E. Sherman, for issued as plate 3 in Sheldon and Company's An Atlas of Classical Geography.\n\n\nWilliam Hughes (c. 1818 - May 21, 1876) was a cartographer, engraver, lithographer, printer, and publisher active in London during the middle part of the 19th century. Hughes enjoyed and long and varied cartographic career. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1838 and, from about 1840, taught geography and mapmaking at St. Johns College for Civil Engineers. He later taught the same at both Queens College and Kings College, London. For a time he was employed as a map librarian for the British Museum. Hughes began engraving maps around 1839 and worked with most of the prominent British map and atlas publishers of his era, including but not limited to Charles Knight, A. and C. Black, George Philip, William Cassell, and others.\n\nJoseph R. Bien was a topographer and an engineer working the later part of the 19th century. His name appears a number of state and regional atlases, including the important 1895 Atlas of New York. Most of Joseph Bien's work was published in conjunction with the New York Lithographing, Engraving & Printing Company, which was founded by Julius Bien. Joseph was almost certainly related to Julien, though whether he was a son, cousin, or brother, remains unknown.\n\nSherman and Smith (fl. c. 1829 - 1855), sometimes working as Stiles, Sherman & Smith, were American engravers active in New York City during the middle part of the 19th century. The firm including John Calvin Smith (surveyor and engraver), George Sherman, and sometimes, Samuel Stiles. Their work primarily focused on government publications, including the maps and engravings prepared to illustrate the official records of the 1838-42 United States Exploring Expedition (U.S. Ex. Ex.), maps issued for the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, and various U.S. Coast Survey Charts. They also engraved privately for Thomas Bradford and John Disturnell, among others. Sherman and Smith maintained offices at the corner of Broadway and Liberty Street in New York City and were highly regarded as the finest cartographic engravers in the city. Their non-cartographic legacies include George Inness, who apprenticed with them for two years before going on to become a well regarding American landscape painter of the Hudson River School.\n\n\nSheldon and Company, An Atlas of Classical Geography constructed by William Hughes and edited by George Long, (New York) 1867. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nVery good.

Harris\n\nPractices of Archaeological Stratigraphy brings together a number of examples which illustrate the development and use of the Harris Matrix in describing and interpreting archaeological sites. This matrix, the theory of which is described in two editions of the previous book by Harris, Principles of Archaeological Stratigaphy, made possible for the first time a simple diagramatic representation of the strategraphic sequence of a site, no matter how complex. The Harris Matrix, by showing in one diagram all three linear dimensions, plus time, represents a quantum leap over the older methods which relied on sample sections only.\nIn this book 17 essays present a sample of new work demonstrating the strengths and uses of the Harris Matrix, the first ever published collection of papers devoted solely to stratigraphy in archaeology. The crucial relationships between the Harris methods, open-area excavation techniques, the interpretation of interfaces, and the use of single-context plans and recording sheets, is clarified by reference to specific sites. These sites range from medieval Europe, through Mayan civilizations to Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.\nThis book will be of great value to all those involved in excavating and recording archaeological sites and should help to ensure that the maximum amount of stratigraphic information can be gathered from future investigations.\n\n* Presents case studies which illuminate the Harris matrix method, invented by Edward C.

Sweet\n\n320 pp., 6.125 x 9.25, 16 illus., 5 maps, 4 tables, notes, bibl., index\n\n  \u2022 Paperback ISBN: 978-0-8078-5482-2\n    Published: September 2003\n  \u2022 eBook ISBN: 978-0-8078-6234-6\n    Published: July 2004\n\nBuy this Book\n\nFor Professors:\nFree E-Exam Copies\n\nAwards & distinctions\n\n2004 Wesley-Logan Prize, American Historical Association\n\nFinalist, 2004 Frederick Douglass Book Prize, Gilder Lehrman Center\n\nExploring the cultural lives of African slaves in the early colonial Portuguese world, with an emphasis on the more than one million Central Africans who survived the journey to Brazil, James Sweet lifts a curtain on their lives as Africans rather than as incipient Brazilians. Focusing first on the cultures of Central Africa from which the slaves came--Ndembu, Imbangala, Kongo, and others--Sweet identifies specific cultural rites and beliefs that survived their transplantation to the African-Portuguese diaspora, arguing that they did not give way to immediate creolization in the New World but remained distinctly African for some time.\n\nSlaves transferred many cultural practices from their homelands to Brazil, including kinship structures, divination rituals, judicial ordeals, ritual burials, dietary restrictions, and secret societies. Sweet demonstrates that the structures of many of these practices remained constant during this early period, although the meanings of the rituals were often transformed as slaves coped with their new environment and status. Religious rituals in particular became potent forms of protest against the institution of slavery and its hardships. In addition, Sweet examines how certain African beliefs and customs challenged and ultimately influenced Brazilian Catholicism.\n\nSweet's analysis sheds new light on African culture in Brazil's slave society while also enriching our understanding of the complex process of creolization and cultural survival.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJames H. Sweet is assistant professor of history at the University of Wisconsin.\nFor more information about James H. Sweet, visit the Author Page.\n\n\n\"A fascinating collection of evidence.\"--The Americas\n\n\"A fascinating book . . . of considerable importance. It not only contributes to a continuing debate about the nature of slavery, but is a powerful example of Atlantic history as it shows that the societies on both sides of the South Atlantic lived in a kind of spiritual intimacy that was not severed by the infamous middle passage.\"--History\n\n\"Given its scope, conceptual claims, and the depth of archival research, this project warrants the broadest conceivable audience. . . . After reading this richly layered study, the critical importance of Central Africans in Latin America and the African diaspora will be more clear.\"--American Historical Review\n\n\"[Sweet] examines his material from an original point of view--perceptive, sensitive, and supported by a solid bibliographic discussion. The result is a fine book.\"--African Studies Review\n\n\"Among the best of the recent works on Africans in the Atlantic.\"--International Journal of African Historical Studies\n\n\"Sweet has uncovered rich gems from the Inquisition records of the Luso-Atlantic world that are essential to historical reconstructions of Central African religious traditions in Brazil before 1770. He also creates vivid portraits of individual Africans living in Angola, Portugal, and Brazil. This important book includes outstanding narratives of slave religious practices in colonial Brazil that I have seen nowhere else. They are especially significant because they enable historians to document continuities over time with contemporary Afro-Brazilian religions. Highly recommended to all students of the African diaspora.\"--Mary Karasch, Oakland University",

He looks at when and how workers secured their first jobs, schools and work, apprenticeship programs, unions, the role of firms in structuring work opportunities, the state as employer and as shaper of employment conditions, and the problem of losing work. Licht also examines the disparate labor market experiences of men and women and the effects of race, ethnicity, age, and social standing on employment.\n\nWalter Licht is Professor of History and Associate Dean at the University of Pennsylvania.

Through extensive research and restoration efforts, dedicated conservationists and the ASI have made every possible attempt to restore the lost brilliance of the Vijayanagara Empire. The splendid rocks and large boulders, together with the awe-inspiring royal architecture, confer on Hampi the rare accolade of being declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its natural beauty as well. Indeed, with the turbulent Tungabhadra river flowing on one side and rocks and boulders poised in an amazing balancing act, Hampi presents a sight to behold.\n\n\nIn Vijayanagara Empire acclaimed photographer Raghu Rai, through his passionate response to the site, takes the reader on a visual experience akin to being transported into the world the way it must have existed centuries ago. His photographs have an archival and ancient feel to them, and yet succinctly capture not only the depths and details of the ruins but also fleeting experiences. Though the grandeur evaporated some four hundred years ago, Raghu Rai's photographs and Usha Rai's words breathe life into the silent stones of history.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\nRaghu Rai has been a Magnum photographer since 1977, when he was nominated to the world\u2019s most prestigious photographers\u2019 cooperative by the legendary photographer Henri Carier-Bresson. His work has appeared in international publications such as Time, The New York Times, Sunday Times, National Geographic, Geo, The New Yorker and others.\n\n\nFor the last thirty years, he has been exhibiting in major cities throughout the world and has won numerous awards. Twenty-five of his photographs are in the Nationale, Paris, while he was the first ever photographer to be honoured with the Padma Shri, one of India\u2019s highest civilian awards. He has also appeared on the jury for the World Press Photo Contest three times. Rai has published more than thirty books of his photographs, including his recent book Bangladesh: The Price of Freedom (Niyogi Books, 2013)\n\n\nSample Pages\n\nAdd a review\nHave A Question\n\nFor privacy concerns, please view our Privacy Policy",

But as Mario Pol\u00e8se argues in The Wealth and Poverty of Regions, geography will matter more than ever before in a world where distance is allegedly dead.\n\nThis provocative book surveys the globe, from London and Cape Town to New York and Beijing, contending that regions rise\u2014or fall\u2014due to their location, not only within nations but also on the world map. Pol\u00e8se reveals how concentrations of industries and populations in specific locales often result in minor advantages that accumulate over time, resulting in reduced prices, improved transportation networks, increased diversity, and not least of all, \u201cbuzz\u201d\u2014the excitement and vitality that attracts ambitious people. The Wealth and Poverty of Regions maps out how a heady mix of size, infrastructure, proximity, and cost will determine which urban centers become the thriving metropolises of the future, and which become the deserted cities of the past.

Whatman watermarked paper.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. With this Executive Order, he took a decisive stand on the most contentious issue in American history, redefined the Union\u2019s goals and strategy, and sounded the death knell for slavery.\n\nThe text of his proclamation reveals the major issues of the Civil War: slave labor as a Confederate resource; slavery as a central war issue; the status of African Americans who escaped to Union lines; courting border states; Constitutional and popular constraints on emancipation; hopes of reunion; questions of Northern acceptance of black soldiers; and America\u2019s place in a world moving toward abolition. The President took the action, \u201csincerely believed to be an act of justice,\u201d knowing that it might cost him the election.\n\nThis \u201cAuthorized Edition\u201d was created in 1864 to aid Union troops. It was signed by Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of State William Seward, and John Nicolay, the President\u2019s private secretary, to be sold at the Philadelphia Great Central Sanitary Fair. In Lincoln\u2019s words, the fairs raised money \u201cto relieve and comfort our brave soldiers.\u201d\n\nOf only 48 copies signed by Lincoln, 26 are known to survive; nearly all are in (or are expected to be donated to) institutions.\n\nCondition. Large, bold Abraham Lincoln signature. The signatures of William Seward and John Nicolay are fine, but as is typical, lighter than the President\u2019s. Conservator\u2019s condition report available on request.\n\nProvenance.

In less than four centuries, the culture, its language and traditions spread over 4,500 km across the Southwest Pacific, as far as Western Polynesia. Characterised by two key features \u2013 the introduction of Austronesian languages into the region by explorers and a very unique tradition of pottery with dotted designs \u2013 the Lapita culture has fascinated many generations of researchers. About 250 sites identified so far have revealed the production of pottery with decorations featuring geometric and anthropomorphic motifs.

        "text":"The First Battle of Moorefield: Early\u2019s Cavalry is Routed\n\nA Scholarly Monograph by Stephen G. Smith\n\n22 December 1997\n\nThe Papers of the Blue and Gray Education Society, Number 6\n\nConflicting Strategies\n\nIn the early morning light of August 7, 1864, gunfire broke the stillness of West Virginia\u2019s South Branch Valley of the Potomac; but the origins of the fighting and its significance lay in events far beyond the valley\u2019s walls. In Virginia, Petersburg was under siege, and Robert E. Lee\u2019s famed Army of Northern Virginia was fighting for its existence. To Ulysses S. Grant, who earlier in the year had been appointed to the rank of lieutenant-general in command of all Union forces, the destruction of Lee\u2019s army was essential in order to achieve victory in the long and devastating struggle. Throughout the spring and early summer of 1864, the Union and Rebel forces had rarely been out of direct contact because of Grant\u2019s stated objective to destroy Confederate armies.\n\nIn order for Grant to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia, he had to keep the other major armies of the Confederacy occupied so that they could not send troops to Lee. He also realized that he must apply overwhelming force directly against the Army of Northern Virginia by using all of the troops at his disposal. Finally, he had to find a way to stop food and other supplies from reaching the Confederate armies.\n\nBecause of poor execution, Union strategy failed to keep the other Confederate Armies occupied. General Nathaniel P. Banks\u2019 Army of the Gulf suffered reversals and had to abandon its campaign up the Red River. This distraction prevented the capture of the Confederate port of Mobile, Alabama. As a result of tactical blundering, General Benjamin Butler\u2019s Army of the James was \u201cbottled-up\u201d by a much smaller Confederate force at Bermuda Hundred and was unable to attack Richmond. Grant\u2019s major effort in the Shenandoah Valley was foiled when the General Franz Sigel was defeated at New Market, Virginia.\n\nSigel\u2019s failure created the immediate requirement to reprogram Grant\u2019s efforts in order to close that Confederate \u201cBreadbasket\u201d.\n\nSubsequently, Grant ordered Major General David Hunter to take command in the Shenandoah Valley. Hunter pursued his mission with a vengeance. He destroyed both private homes and public buildings, such as the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, thus earning the undying hatred of the citizens of the Valley and the troops who opposed him. Lee, realizing the significance of the Shenandoah to his position at Petersburg, ordered General Jubal Early to halt Hunter\u2019s advance and, if possible, drive him out of the Valley.\n\nIn a series of stubborn delaying movements, young Brigadier General John McCausland, an 1857 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, contested the advance of Hunter\u2019s 18,000 men. Felling trees, burning bridges and harassing the enemy force, McCausland bought time for the defenders of Lynchburg\u2013a critical transportation hub and the Federal objective. In appreciation for his defense of their homes, the citizens of Lynchburg awarded McCausland a pair of silver spurs, a new sword and the title \u201cSavior of Lynchburg.\u201d\n\nThanks to McCausland\u2019s effective delaying actions and the meticulously slow nature of Hunter\u2019s arsonist march, Early was able to reach Lynchburg before Union troops could attack the town. After a brief but sharp fight. Hunter fell back before the smaller Confederate force. By this time, the Federals were short of both food and ammunition. Since the path they had taken to Lynchburg, through Staunton and Lexington, was so thoroughly despoiled by the march southward, it was not a viable retreat route. Consequently, Hunter was forced to retire into the mountains of West Virginia. This move effectively took his force out of the war, leaving the Shenandoah Valley open to\n\nConfederate occupation and the north open to invasion. Jubal Early was just the man to exploit this opportunity.\n\nMajor General Jubal Anderson Early was a native of Franklin County, Virginia and a Class of 1837 graduate of West Paint. In the Mexican War, he served as a Major in the Virginia volunteers. Even though he had voted against secession in 1861, \u201cOld Jube\u201d became an ardent Confederate, supporting the South with his sword during the war and the \u201clost cause\u201d with his pen after it. Early acted immediately upon the opportunity which the flight of Hunter presented and moved northward, down the Shenandoah Valley. On July 9, 1864, Early\u2019s army met and defeated General Lew Wallace\u2019s troops in sharp fighting at Monocacy, Maryland. By July 11th, Early\u2019s troops were at the gates of Washington.6\n\nThe significance of Early\u2019s movement was quite apparent. The presence of Rebel troops at the defenses of Washington sent a signal to the battered Confederacy that the war was not yet over and that the South could still lash out at its Northern foes. It also meant that the Shenandoah Valley remained open and supplies would continue to flow to Lee\u2019s veterans in the trenches at Petersburg. Grant understood the serious nature of the Southern move in the Valley. In response to Early\u2019s offensive, Grant telegraphed Union Chief of Staff, Henry W. Halleck on July 4, 1864: \u201cUnder the circumstances, I think it advisable to hold all of the forces you can about Washington, Baltimore, Cumberland and Harpers Ferry ready to advance against any advance of the enemy.\u201d\n\nTo read the entire monograph, you may purchase it by downloading an order form or by contacting us.\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

This is mainly due to the status of the United States as one of one of the most significant nations in history. The American Flag is the 3rd oldest of the National Standards of the world \u2013 older compared to the Union Jack of Britain or the Tricolor of France.

In May 1776, so the tale goes, General Washington as well as 2 representatives from the Continental Congress visited Ross at her upholstery store and also showed her a sketch design of the flag. Washington initially preferred using a star with 6 points, Ross advocated for a five-pointed star, which might be cut with just one quick snip of the scissors, and the gentlemen were won over. Unfortunately, historians have not been able to confirm this variation of events.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn 1777, the Continental Congress passed an act that gave our country an official flag. In those days, the flag was not the like we know it today. Rather than the 50 white stars in the field of blue, there was a circle of 13 white stars to stand for the 13 colonies. The act stated, \u201cResolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and also white; that the Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue area, representing a new constellation.\u201d\n\nExactly what does the American Flag represent?\n\nThe flag initially rose over thirteen states along the Atlantic seaboard, with a populace of some three million people. Today it flies over fifty states, expanding throughout the continent, and over great islands of the two oceans; and also hundreds owe it allegiance. It has been given this happy position by love and sacrifice. People have progressed it as well as heroes have actually died for it.\n\nThe flag consists of 13 alternating red as well as white horizontal stripes representing the initial thirteen British colonies that stated self-reliance from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and also became the initial states in the US. This blue area of the flag is called the Union.\n\nThe symbolism of the Flag, as stated by Washington: \u201cWe take the stars from Heaven, the red from our mother country, dividing it by white stripes, hence revealing that we have actually separated from her, and also the white stripes shall drop to posterity representing Liberty.\u201d\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt incarnates for all mankind the spirit of liberty and the wonderful ideal of human freedom; not the liberty of unrestraint or the freedom of license, however a distinct ideal of equal opportunity permanently, freedom and also the pursuit of joy, safeguarded by the stern and lofty principles of duty, of integrity and of justice, and obtainable by obedience to self-imposed laws.\n\nTwo times told tales of nationwide honor as well as splendor collection thickly about it. It bears witness to the enormous growth of our nationwide limits, the growth of our natural sources, and also the superb structure of our civilization. It prophesises the triumph of prominent federal government, of civic and religious liberty and also of national decency throughout the globe.\n\nWhy is the American Flag vital to American society?\n\nThe American flag is crucial because it represents the independent government as explained under the United States Constitution. Contribute to that, it likewise represents the background, beliefs and also principles of its residents. As a democratic nation, its individuals adhere to all-important values such as liberty, justice as well as equal rights. In addition, the flag additionally represents the different successes of the country in addition to the pride of its individuals.\n\nThis national icon reminds individuals, not just in the state of Vermont, but throughout the whole USA concerning the various vital facets of the Declaration of Independence. It is not just a simple icon, which represents the freedom and also rights of Americans. Drifting from the soaring pinnacle of American idealism, it is a sign of sustaining hope.\n\nIt is the indication made visible of the solid spirit that has actually brought freedom and also success to the people of America.

Maybe even more upsetting is that during 2001, in the wave of patriotism that spread over America after 9\/11, Americans acquired $52 million US dollars in imported flags. The flag ought to signify the blood, sweat, and tears of American people that brought this country into existence, not our debt to China and the death of the American production sector.\n\nThe flag symbolizes nationwide freedom as well as popular sovereignty. It is not the flag of a ruling family or royal house, yet of the thousands free people welded right into a nation, one and also inseparable, unified not only by community of interest, yet by vital unity of view and also purpose; a country identified for the clear individual perception of its citizens alike of their obligations as well as their advantages, their responsibilities and also their civil liberties.\n\nHave a little pride, cough up a few more money, and also get an American flag made by Americans in the United States of America.\n\nProctor ZIP codes we serve: 05765",
