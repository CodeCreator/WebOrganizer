Planning a medieval or Renaissance wedding does require some extra thought and preparation. If you want to throw a 16th-century wedding that your guests will never forget, you should focus on finding a good venue, crafting a traditional medieval menu, decorating for the time period, and dressing the part.\n\nPart 1\nChoosing a Venue\n\n  1. 1\n    Have an outdoor wedding to save money. Planning an outdoor wedding will open up your venue options and save you money, and you can use the natural landscape to create a medieval forest vibe on a budget.\n    \u2022 Look for local gardens or parks that offer wedding packages. If a family member or friend has a large yard, ask if you can have the wedding there to save even more money.\n    \u2022 If you\u2019re planning a fall or winter wedding, check the weather before booking an outdoor venue. If there\u2019s a chance of snow or bad weather, have the wedding indoors or plan accordingly.[1]\n  2. 2\n    Have a castle wedding to amaze your guests. Look for museums, bed and breakfasts, or historical landmarks that operate out of old castles. Call and ask if they do weddings. Your medieval celebration will be beautiful and authentic with a castle backdrop.\n    \u2022 If renting out part of a castle is too expensive for you, look for smaller historic buildings that still offer a medieval-like atmosphere.\n  3. 3\n    Have the wedding at a cathedral. The sprawling stone interior, stained-glass windows, and high vaulted ceilings will go perfectly with a medieval or Renaissance theme. Most cathedrals already have ornate interiors so you\u2019ll save money on decorations.\n  4. 4\n    Choose a Renaissance festival as your venue to save yourself time. Many Renaissance festivals offer themed wedding packages that include traditional medieval food, music, and decor. Call your local Renaissance festival and inquire about their wedding deals if you're interested in an authentic medieval wedding ceremony without the hassle of organizing it yourself.\n\nPart 2\nCreating a Medieval Menu\n\n  1. 1\n    Have a multiple-course feast. Offer guests an array of meats, vegetables, dried fruits, and desserts so they feel like they\u2019re attending a royal wedding.\n  2. 2\n    Serve traditional medieval foods. Opt for old-fashioned meats like venison and duck instead of chicken and fish for your entree. Serve the meat with common medieval vegetables like carrots, cabbage, and onion.[2]\n  3. 3\n    Season the food with authentic medieval spices. Use black pepper, saffron, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to make your dishes taste like they would have in the middle ages. Use honey in place of sugar when you can.[3]\n  4. 4\n    Serve wine and ale along with other popular Renaissance drinks. Offer tea and cider as non-alcoholic options. Serve guests their drinks in chalices for an extra medieval touch.[4]\n    \u2022 If you want to offer guests a Renaissance-themed cocktail, make a rose soda using sugar, honey, water, and rose petals and mix in a spirit like vodka.[5]\n  5. 5\n    Serve multiple desserts. Offer guests a variety of tarts, puddings, and custards with fruits like strawberries and figs. Serve dessert at the same time you serve the rest of your menu for a truly authentic medieval feast.[6]\n  6. 6\n    Order a medieval-themed wedding cake. Ask the baker to put a dragon or a crown on top, or ask that the entire cake be in the shape of a castle. Cut the cake using a miniature sword instead of a knife.\n\nPart 3\nChoosing Decorations\n\n  1. 1\n    Use banquet-style tables. Cover them with white or cream colored table cloths or use table runners to create the appearance of a royal feast. Sprinkle flower petals on the tables for an extra romantic touch. Have the wedding party share a table, with the wedded couple seated in the middle. You can also seat the wedded couple at their own, separate table that\u2019s positioned so they can look out at all of their guests like a king and queen would.\n  2. 2\n    Decorate the venue with candles. Candles will help create the pre-electricity, medieval vibe you\u2019re going for. Use candelabras as part of your centerpieces or opt for smaller tea light candles and scatter them throughout your venue. Make sure the candles aren\u2019t a fire hazard by placing them where guests won\u2019t bump into them or knock them over.\n  3. 3\n    Go with simple flower arrangements. Use flowers that are earthy romantic colors like white, red, green, and pink. Make fresh floral table runners for your banquet tables. If you\u2019re having a buffet-style feast, use some simple flower bouquets to enhance the presentation of the food tables.\n    \u2022 Pink carnations symbolized marriage in medieval times. Use pink carnations in your flower arrangements to make your Renaissance wedding more authentic.[7]\n  4. 4\n    Send out wedding invitations that inform guests about your theme. Print your invitations on a scroll or parchment paper. Use a calligraphy pen with ink to give your invitations a genuine medieval look. Write your invitations using words that would have been used during the Middle Ages.\n    \u2022 For example, instead of writing \u201cYou\u2019re invited to our wedding\u201d on the invitations, write \u201cWe request the honor of your presence as we celebrate our forever uniting in marriage.\u201d\n    \u2022 Make your invitations announcements of a royal engagement. For example, you could write \u201cYou and the rest of the kingdom are invited to this once-in-a-lifetime royal wedding celebration.\u201d\n\nPart 4\nDressing for the Wedding\n\n  1. 1\n    Choose a wedding dress. Find a long gown with a fitted bodice that is green or blue, and avoid wearing white. White was the color of mourning in medieval times. [8]\n    \u2022 Accessorize the bride with a flower crown or a tiara.\n    \u2022 Look online for a Renaissance-themed wedding dress if you\u2019re having trouble finding one in stores.\n  2. 2\n    Choose a royal suit for the groom. Find a high-collared jacket that goes to the knees and cinch it at the waist with a belt. Have the groom wear tights or tight-fitting pants with tall leather boots.\n    \u2022 Accessorize the groom with a crown, cape, or faux fur jacket.\n    \u2022 Grooms going for a medieval knight look can wear armor and a chain-mail shirt and pants. Attach a sword at the waist to complete the outfit.\n  3. 3\n    Have the bridesmaids dress in medieval attire. Dress them in long, ruffled dresses with puffed up sleeves. Make sure their dresses are a different color than the brides. Have them wear flower crowns and carry bouquets with matching flowers.\n  4. 4\n    Dress the groomsmen as a band of knights or swordsmen. Have them wear matching tunics cinched at the waist with rope or a belt. Give them swords and matching leather boots.\n  5. 5\n    Have your guests dress for the theme too. On the wedding invitations, add a note about dressing up that says something like \"Wear your finest medieval fashions.\" Check in with your guests before the wedding to make sure they understand the theme.\n    \u2022 If you\u2019re worried about guests not dressing up, have some spare costume items at the wedding just in case. Fill a box with flower crowns, swords, capes, and other medieval-themed props and leave it at the venue entrance so guests can pick something up as they arrive.\n\nAdditional Wedding Resources\n\nCommunity Q&A\n\nAsk a Question\n200 characters left\nInclude your email address to get a message when this question is answered.\n\n    Article Info\n\n    Categories: Wedding Themes\n\n    Thanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 26,436 times.\n\n    Did this article help you?",

        "text":"Mr. Consistency\n\nHow To Effectively Discipline A Toddler Or Child\n\nHaving a new kid is a bit like Jurassic Park. It\u2019s all oohs and ahhs until the mutants break free from their cages \u2014 then it\u2019s all running, screaming, and biting. As babies become toddlers, the methods and manners of their misbehaving only get more complex (clever girl), but if a shoeshine boy from Pawnee, Indiana can tame dinosaurs, you can figure out how to discipline a child. And you\u2019ll have\u00a0to\u00a0because every young velociraptor eventually jumps the fence.\n\nWhile there are as many styles of discipline as their are parents, experts seem to agree on most of the broad strokes: You need to consistently express love and confidence in your kid while clearly communicating your expectations and being flexible and collaborative in achieving them. Simple, right?\n\nHow To Discipline A Child\n\nAccording to parenting coach Dr. Erica Reischer, there are 3 reasons parents become inconsistent in these situations:\n\n  1. You\u2019re not paying attention, so you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re responding differently than last time.\n  2. You don\u2019t want to enforce whatever consequences you meant to establish.\n  3. You actually can\u2019t enforce the consequences due to timing or context.\n\nInconsistency is a signal to your kid that maybe the next time they fling the tater tot across the kitchen, your reaction will be different. If you always react the same way, they\u2019ll learn to act differently. Here\u2019s how you can get there:\n\n  \u2022 Reinforce good behavior. Obvious but effective, as this incentivizes more of the good stuff.\n  \u2022 Leverage natural consequences of bad behavior. Within reason, of course. \u201cDon\u2019t run over there or you\u2019ll fall off that cliff\u201d is not a reasonable natural consequence. \u201cPut your pants on or you don\u2019t get to go out for ice cream\u201d is perfectly reasonable. Consequences are how kids learn.\n  \u2022 Be respectful. Of your kid, even when they\u2019re acting like a genetic experiment gone horribly wrong, and of yourself when you blow it. Because you will blow it. Again, consistency is key.\n\nHow To Discipline A Toddler\n\n\nA word here on spanking: Getting smacked upside the head doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cnatural consequence of bad behavior.\u201d The data backs this up. Spanking can make kids more aggressive, teach them it\u2019s okay to hit someone you love, and quickly turn into something much worse when you\u2019re heated.\n\nYour kids will test your patience and temper, and, at times, your sanity. Maintaining consistency in the face of that is daunting, but it\u2019s your job. They\u2019re only acting on instinct as part of their natural learning process. Life finds a way, after all.",

        "text":"What would you like to know?\nShare this Story\n\nThe key to successful relationships\n\nRelationships can be the most difficult and joyful part of your life. You cannot avoid them unless you never get out of bed in the morning and sometimes not even then. You will find yourself interfacing with others almost immediately each day.\nDue to the complex multiple roles you have in your life this can be plentiful. On an average day you could be talking to your husband, wife, co-workers, children, siblings, friends, parents, our children teachers, your significant other, your boss, the grocery clerk and at the end of the day it could be a telecommunication caller.\n\nOne of the most important skills that you need in any and all of these relationships is listening. Better listening skills will allow you to create a more harmonious relationship where respect and cooperation are more likely to occur.\n\nSo ask yourself now... How well do I really listen to others? How well do I listen to myself? Can I be still and quiet enough to really listen? Or do I feel restless when there is silence and so I start talking right away? Here are some tips on developing better listening skills.\n\n1. Listen with concern and a desire to understand. Do not pretend to be listening or give only part of your attention if you are distracted. If you need and it is possible, ask the person to wait until you can be more attentive.\n\n2. Let the other person talk without interrupting. Avoid quickly giving advice interrupting or making assumptions as to what you think they are going to say. Pause and breathe staying present and silent until he\/she is finished.\n\n3. Do not prepare your answer while they are talking. Try to stay only in the listening mode. Once you have all the information you will be more prepared to respond.\n\n4. Do not engage in selective listening. Listen to the words, facts and overall content of the person \u2122s story. Do not just pay attention to what you find interesting.\n\n5. While you are listening observe their facial expressions, gestures, eye movement and body posture. This will give you information as to what they might be feeling about their conversation, more information to help you understand.\n\nThe second part of the skill is learning to reflect back what you heard the person saying. Paraphrasing and repeating back what you heard allows the person to know you have been listening. It keeps clarity in conversation and allows for overall better communication. This is also a skill that requires some practice. Here are a few tips.\n\n  \u2022 Try to briefly summarize what you heard them say and repeat it back to them.\n\n  \u2022 Ask them is this is what they were trying to tell you. If not, try again to summarize or ask them to repeat part of what you did not understand.\n\n  \u2022 Do not immediately respond with your belief, opinion or advise before you have clarified their position. Only give advice if they are asking for it.\n\n  \u2022 Use empathy in your response instead of being judgmental. Be neutral and clarify what you heard their feelings, thoughts or opinions are. Do not yell, argue or criticize. Ask more questions. Try asking why, when, where or who questions. This gives you more information.\n\n  \u2022 Determine what they need from you. Would they like you just to listen and say nothing, give feedback, provide advice, help them problem solve a situation. Of course, if you are talking to young children you may have to interrupt this yourself and offer what your intuition feels they need.\n\nWhether you are in contact with your children, boss, husband, or wife or significant others these tools are valuable. For the next week or so try to exercise these new skills. Observe what happens when you listen and respond in an empathic manner instead of with advise, opinion or judgments. Make a note of the new interaction and compare it with your old way of listening or not listening. Observe their manner; are they calmer, more appreciate? What do you notice?\n\nWe all have a need to be listened to and understood. Most of us grew up with not enough of the focused attention we need. As a result we are all a little deprived, that is why so many of us want to talk and talk and talk and listening is something that we just don \u2122t know how to do. In fact we are uncomfortable with being quiet and still.\n\nI suggest to you that if you practice you will benefit in many ways. All your relationships will dramatically improve. You will find that you will gain a greater ability to listen to yourself and you may find that others more readily give you time and attention. What we need from others we must be willing to give to them as well. Be patient, praise yourself for your efforts (don \u2122t wait for others to praise you), and watch your skill grow.\n\nNew in Love\n\nAnd you'll see personalized content just for you whenever you click the My Feed .\n\nSheKnows is making some changes!",

        "text":"Have you ever thought that someday you would want to be a foster parent? Maybe your someday begins today. This shouldn\u2019t be a haphazard decision but a well-thought-out, life-changing decision. Research. Ask questions. Then make the call. It all begins with a decision.\n\nDeciding to Become a Foster Parent\n\nOnce you have made a decision to learn more about the foster care system, look up the information for your state\u2019s department of human services or any local foster care agency. Write down a list of questions you have prior to making the initial phone call. You may even want to reach out to other foster families in your area before choosing a specific foster care agency. Just be cautious as you seek out where your foster children will be coming from. It is advisable to choose an agency outside of your neighborhood or town if you can. Issues can arise with taking in a foster child that has recently been taken away from his or her family and that family lives nearby. Choose somewhere that fits you.\n\nTaking the Required Classes\n\nIn the classes, you will learn everything you need to know to make your decisions from there on out. Each state is different; however, in many states, the classes take around 30 hours. Classes are typically offered in the evenings and weekends. Within the classes, you will learn about the licensing process, the potential fostering to adopt process, the rules and laws to abide by when you have a foster child in your care, and many situational stories and videos in order for you to get a feel of what you are getting licensed to do. Once the hours are complete, you will be placed with a licensing worker.\n\nYour Licensing Worker\n\nNow, the not-so-fun part that will directly lead you to the fun part: Your licensing worker will help you complete all of the necessary requirement to obtain your license. All adults in your home will need a background check and fingerprints. Everyone needs to submit a current physical and TB testing. If you have a family pet(s), the vet and shot records have to be submitted. This will lead you to the home inspections. During a home inspection, they are looking that you have ample space for the foster child(ren) and that your home is safe. The licensing worker will be looking for up-to-date smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers. They will be looking for things such as your water heater to make sure the temperature could not burn a child. Before you are approved for licensure, they will need income verifications and letters of reference.\n\nDoes that sound\u00a0daunting? It may sound like a lot of items to check off your list, but typically you already have most of those items in place. While you were in your classes, they probably had you start to think about what ages of foster children you would like to be placed with. The final step with your licensing worker is declaring what type of child you see fitting in your home. They will need to know if you can take children with special needs and if you would do respite for other children. They need to know the age range you prefer and if a boy or a girl would fit best within your family. They need to know your plans, such as short-term or long-term foster care or adoption. Once this step is complete, you wait (and wait and wait).\n\nGetting the Call\n\nOnce your license goes through, more than likely, it will not be too long before you get a call. Caseworkers will pair a child or children that seem like a good match. Do not hesitate to say no. Ask a lot of questions about your potential placement. You need to feel comfortable in order to best help the children involved. Just be honest and open with your agency so that they can find children that are right for your family. Be flexible with the agency. You will need to meet with the caseworker before the child comes into your care. Once you say yes, you can arrange for the final step along with transfer\/pick-up of your new foster child to love. How exciting! \u00a0\n\nNow that you have a new family member, learn and grow with that child. You will need to give her plenty of love and be sure to have plenty of patience as she adjusts to your home. Your new foster child is probably not as excited about the process as you are. Give him time. Devote your time to getting to know him. Show him you care. You were meant to come into her life.\n\nBe excited! Learn from your experiences as a foster parent. Your life will change in an amazing way. Cherish every minute.\n\n\nMy name is Gina Francis. I am a single mom of two adopted, almost teenage, children named Mireya and Christopher. Our adoption story is one of those \u201cmeant to be\u201d situations. My very first foster placement was for one beautiful little 4-year-old girl and one big-eyed, tiny 2-year-old boy. Both of whom were supposed to stay with me for two months. Nine years later, here we are now as an adoptive family of three! I am also a fourth grade teacher. We live in Central Illinois and are big fans of the St. Louis Cardinals. We even named our little Yorkipoo puppy, Yadi! The kids keep me pretty busy with all of their activities and sports; however, our favorite thing to do together is travel. One goal of mine is to see all 50 states with Mireya and Christopher before they are too old to take a trip with their mom. (But if I am paying, I am guessing they will be up for the trip at any age!) As adventurous as we are as a family, I am very excited to begin this new journey as a writer.",

Designate a Stage Manager. We\u2019ve all seen those shows where the bride is running herself ragged running her own rehearsal (and trying to run the ceremony).\u00a0 Name a friend or relative to give directions and to stand in the back and say \"walk\" if no one on your vendor team can do so.\n2.

Just use the panel on this page to access the photo profiles of nice men online in your area looking for friendship or love\u2026\n\nOur advice is below, but first a couple of related resources that are well worth visiting. In How To Attract a Man we have an article by a relationship expert which asks \u201cWhen do you know if he\u2019s right\u201d \u2013 well worth checking out and there\u2019s an associated ebook and course. On a related note Men Made Easy is an ebook, work book and MP3 audio package about how to have a good relationship with your man. By the way, if you\u2019ve come to this page by mistake and you\u2019re actually interested in knowing how to attract a nice woman then go here: How to Attract a Single Woman.\n\nHere\u2019s today\u2019s \u2018how to attract a man you like\u201d advice:\n\nAttracting a great guy, a nice guy who will treat you well and isn\u2019t self-obsessed has to begin at the basics of how you present yourself. Naturally you will make an effort to present yourself at your best and a big part of this is the clothes and make-up you use. Most guys like natural-looking make-up on a woman, or as natural-looking as possible. Don\u2019t hide behind heavy mascara and a \u2018painted-on\u2019 look. This will look as if you are trying to hide something, or as if you are very unconfident, both which could be turn-offs for a guy.\n\nNext, pay attention to your clothes. If you want to attract a man you are going to like rather than attracting a creep, then you have to ask yourself what kind of image are you trying to project to guys through the clothes you choose to wear.\n\nFor example, if you wear something very revealing then some men could interpret this as you offering more than you probably want to. This is potentially a controversial area, but it should be obvious that you are giving out a different kind of message about what kind of person you are if you wear something very skimpy indeed as compared with something a little figure-hugging but not too revealing.\n\nTo say this is not the same as saying that in a situation where a man takes advantage of a woman that the woman is to blame. In this circumstance the woman would not be to blame no matter how she was dressed. My point is though that if you want to attract nice guys then you have to dress in a way that presents you as a nice girl.\n\nOK, what next? If you are looking at a man you like on the other side of a room then you can smile at him when your eyes meet, then wait for him to make the first move. Does he smile back? Is he interested? Try to read his movements and body language to see.\n\nWhen he comes over to talk to you be friendly and confident. Act in a mature way and don\u2019t \u2018throw yourself at him\u2019. Speak to him as to a friend but don\u2019t start telling him your life-story. Be natural and not artificial in your conversation so that he will come to appreciate you as an interesting person worth getting to know.\n\nIf you can find things you have in common during your conversation then you will be forming the basis for a continuing friendship. Relationships of whatever kind and whatever level depend on having things in common and shared goals. So look for interests that you might share, outlooks on life and attitudes towards things that you have in common.\n\nIf you like him be prepared to take an interest in other things he likes that are new to you and expect the same of him, for a good relationship should be equal.\n\nHow To Attract A Man Online \u2013 Want to find and attract a man?

        "text":"Tips Of Planning An Event Or Party In New York City\n\nWhether you got stuck with the task of throwing one for your business or you are a professional planner, knowing how to schedule a corporate event or party in NYC can be overwhelming. Especially now in December, when the city is full of holiday celebrations! From the atmosphere, location, to food and more, the correct event takes effort and planning to come off seamlessly. Are you interested in planning an event or party in New York City? Then check out the rest of this article. It will help you discover some useful hints for planning an event or party in New York City.\n\nConceptualize Your Big Idea\/Theme:\n\nChoosing a theme for your party sets the tone of the event, whether you are doing a company\u2019s picnic or a workshop or a private party in NYC. You will be able to get started with picking your decor, music, food and more. Ensure that your theme correspond to the crowd for which you are planning. To get started you can find a large variety of theme ideas online.\n\nSet A Preliminary Budget:\n\nIt is always important to set a budget. This will help to determine how much you can spend invitations, room rental, entertainment, food, and any other additions. Keep in mind that the budget you set should also cover extra expenses that you didn\u2019t anticipate for the event.\u00a0 (there are always extra!)\n\n\nStart Making Appointments To View Venue Locations And Meet Different Vendors:\n\nAt this point, you will have to start discussing room rental costs and know all that is entailed in their fees. Make sure to check the hours and availability of the venues that you are interested in. If nobody else has booked the space, then go ahead and start negotiations. Once you have agreed upon a price and booked the venue, it is time to set it up. Decide what your arrangement for the room will be, and take some time to set it up and decorate. Find out if the venue will be offering food service or any other assistance and supplies. If there is no such service, then go on to bring your own napkins, plates, linens and silverware.\n\nIn case you are to bring in your own caterer, start contacting potential vendors to look at their menus and prices. Sometimes, parties in NYC can get out of control. You can ask if bringing outside security for the event is allowed. It will help to keep outsiders from crashing your private party and protect you from any liability in the event that something happens.\n\nNow, what party can exist without a great bartender? If your facility cannot provide one, look to hire a licensed one from a private company. Choose the drinks based on the type of party. For the corporate parties, keep it classy with a few high-end cocktails, expensive wine, and premium beers. For the wilder and larger parties, stick to the basics. Beer and well drinks.\n\nCheck to see if the venue or location can offer party supplies or if you have to bring along your own. Some services have a gamut of items that you can make use of such as glass jars, mirrors, candles, tables and just to mention a few. You will save more money by taking advantage of anything being offered for free by the venue.\n\nDetermine Your Menu With The Selected Caterer:\n\nThe menu will vary depending on the manner and timing of serving the food. Determine if it will be a sit-down plated meal or a buffet style. Also, you should be considering a dessert bar later in the evening or doing appetizers ahead of time, since most people who are also drinking will require a little extra food. Iron out the timing and exact details with the caterer so that your visitors do not go hungry at any point. And if they do have to wait, improvise with an impromptu toast or even a fun drinking game!\n\nMake It Official:\n\nAt this juncture, you can start signing contracts with your vendors. Ensure that they provide you with a copy to avoid any future problems and alleviate any unwanted litigation down the road. Once everything has been done, you can start buying your decorations to suit the theme of the event. Go ahead to design and send your invitations over electronically or use traditional mail.\n\nMake Yourself A To-do List Timeline:\n\nMake sure to create a countdown checklist that lists all of the little details that remain before your big party or event. Chances are you will still be running around the a wild-animal hours before the event, but having things planned out beforehand will prevent too many last minute crises.\n\n\nNew York is probably the best city in the world when it comes to parties \u2013 but no one thinks about the people who actually put them on! With the comprehensive explanation in this article, you will agree that making a good plan can help your corporate event or private party in NYC a smashing success. Make sure that you taken the proper legal steps for gathering insurance, licenses, etc. so that you can have fun without worrying about the consequences (well, there is always a hangover!). If, for any reason, you want to hire your own party planner or event planner in NYC, I highly suggest Birthdays & Bottles \u2013\n\nTis the Season to Watch Holiday Movies\n\nTis the season indeed. It is hard to get away from jingle bells on the radio or XMAS movies on tv, so we might as well embrace it right? Afterall, most holiday movies (or at least the best ones) are shot around New York. Here is a list of my favorites:\n\n\nHome Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992)\n\nYes, it is hard not to love the bratty, but adorable Kevin McCallister as he goes up against the sticky bandits all alone in the big city. This movie has everything, from action, to heartbreak, laughter to tears. Definitely on the top of my list.\n\n\n\nMiracle On 34th Street (1947)\n\nThis classic holiday movie is truly timeless. No matter how many times I have watched it on TV, I still just love it (even more!). Getting to see how New York was in the 40s is a treat on its own, but this movie is most likely the best XMAS movie made ever.\n\n\nSerendipity (2001)\n\nJohn Cusack is almost always great. Put him together with the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, in a heartwarming holiday romantic comedy\u00a0shot in NYC and you have a winning combination. Get the popcorn and tissues ready for this feel good XMAS movie, because you\u2019ll need it.\n\nSo what will you be watching this year?\n\nNew York City in December\n\nIt is no surprise that New York City, a place that is pretty much awesome all year round, is even more amazing during the holiday season. Whether you are young or old, rich or poor, chances are you are going to find something for you. If you like the brisk outdoor cold, then you can go ice skating at Rockefeller Center. If you are in the mood for latkes and Chanukkah candles, then head on down to Crown Heights. If you are in the mood to party, then have no fear, there are plenty of holiday parties, big and small, happening this month in NYC.\n\nWhere can you find what\u2019s good you ask?\n\nWell the first place I check is Time Out New York\u2019s calendar \u2013\u00a0then I like to check NYC.COM\u2019s list of upcoming events which can be found here \u2013\n\nJust remember whatever it is you do. If you drink, don\u2019t drive. Be safe this holiday season. Take a cab or subway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nxmas in nyc\n\n\nHappy Holidays New York!",

        "text":"How To Prevent Conflicts?\n\nWhen you fight with people it can be exhausting and upsetting. Everybody will fight with their friends, family and sometimes even strangers. If you do not want to fight with others then you must prevent it. Most fights can be stopped if everybody just takes a minute to breathe however this normally does not happen because one or both parties are too angry to even try and calm down. If you want to prevent conflicts then you must stop getting angry with other people.\n\nDo not fight with strangers\n\nThere are lots of times when people find themselves fighting with complete strangers. They may fight with strangers because they are drunk, because of incidents that may occur when their angry or if they feel that they have been offended in some way. Traffic management will reduce traffic and this can help prevent people from getting angry. This will involve having truck detour routes, identifying the public areas that are affected and communicating with the relevant parties in order to reduce the traffic.\n\nA traffic controller company may have to be hired when someone is having a private event. When there is concrete pumping and pouring being done they will also need to be hired. Choose a company that plans well and will also respond properly when there is an emergency.\n\nYou must think before you act\n\nYou must learn to control your temper if you want to prevent conflicts from happening. If you are angry with another person do not fight with them. You should talk to them calmly and discuss with them why you are angry. This way you can solve your problem by talking and then you will not have to fight with anybody. It is good to discuss your problems with other people first because you may jump to conclusions and pick a fight with somebody for no reason at all.\n\nYou should use humor\n\nIf you are in a heated discussion with somebody you can use humor to break the tension. When people discuss something they are passionate about they can become emotional and if the conversation is not going their way they can start to get angry. When you feel like you or the person you are arguing with is getting angry you should use humor so that your anger will go away and you will not have any conflicts.\n\nBe a good listener\n\nWhen you listen to others you can hear their point of view and this way you will see where they are coming from. When you understand them you will find it harder to fight with them.",

        "text":"A Guide to Letting Your Child Rule\u2026\n\n\u2026Or What\u2019s So Special About Special Time?\n\nDoesn\u2019t it seem like children these days are just itching to gain power over you, all the time? If \u201cGive me milk,\u201d and \u201cI want it now!\u201d are fairly common in your home, you\u2019ll know just what we mean.\n\nWell at Hand in Hand, we say, \u201cHand it over grown up! Give the kids a chance at running the show.\u201d\n\nHave we lost all sense of reality? Not at all.\n\nReady to let her rule?\n\nLet Your Children Rule!\n\nWe talk a lot about the concept of Special Time \u2013 that time set aside with a child, where a timer is set, all attention is focused on them and they get to choose exactly what the two of you will do. In fact, Special Time is a cornerstone strategy outlined in founder Patty Wipfler\u2019s upcoming book Listen: Five Simple Tools to Meet Your Everyday Parenting Challenges.\n\nSpecial Time doesn\u2019t exist to \u2018let kids loose\u2019 or wreak havoc in your life. Quite the opposite. Patty says that Special Time is a simple way to let your child absorb your love and attention and that the sense of safety it gives fosters co-operation. This eases the stresses they feel and allows them the safety to explore their fears and uncertainties.\n\nWho could argue with these enthusiastic responses from parents that already love Special Time and the closeness it brings.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely amazed at the powerful effects that Special Time has on my relationship with my daughter, and also in helping her address things that are bothering her,\u201d says one happy mom.\n\n\u201cI cannot praise the genius of Special Time enough! It\u2019s clear that it makes a difference in my child\u2019s life but what makes it equally rewarding is noticing it makes my life as a parent so much lighter and more fun,\u201d says another, Lisa Orr.\n\nSpecial Time is the moment where children, finally, can make the rules. You set a timer. You tell them its Special Time (or whatever you choose to call it \u2013 for more on this, read on.) You outline any safety rules. Then they are off.\n\nSpecial Time timerThey lead Special Time and are totally in charge \u2013 which can take you anywhere from sparkly manicures to playing spray hose, right up until the timer you set goes \u201cping.\u201d\n\nDo not be tempted to make suggestions on what to do, and if they are slow to have ideas, just be with them while they chat and ponder or wander around.\n\nSome children get imaginative. Each of Hand in Hand Instructor Abigail Wald\u2019s children had her climb into a tub of ice water \u2013 with her clothes on \u2013 over\u00a0two sessions of Special Time. \u201cI shrieked in true horror as I did it, but when I got out they each sweetly wrapped me in a towel. Thank goodness for small favors,\u201d she says.\n\nYet\u00a0Special Time hardly ever looks so zany. Many children happily opt to have ten minutes to sit and color with their adult. Bike rides and ball games are requested. Card games, snuggles, and play in the \u2018den\u2019 under the table can all be Special Time. Sometimes it feels best to have mom sit and block build or dad braid a favorite doll\u2019s hair, other times its bouncing for ten minutes on the trampoline.\n\nHonor what he or she decides and the time. When Special Time is on phone calls, emails, the front door, the washing machine, or any other usual household distraction is set on hold while you two enjoy this golden moment.\n\nBenefits of Letting your Children Take Charge\n\nChildren are rarely really listened to. Normally, it's them begging for our attention or their turn. All day long they are told what to do, by parents, caregivers, teachers, and family members. After they have been listened to they tend be more cooperative when you do make requests and days run more smoothly. This is why the concept of Special Time can be so impactful for the whole family.\n\nBenefits aren't just for the\u00a0children. Try Special Time for a week and see if you don\u2019t feel some of these transformative effects:\n\n  \u2022 A closer bond between you and your children.\n  \u2022 A sense of relief and contentment\n  \u2022 A greater sense of fun and playfulness\n  \u2022 Greater ability to deal with any tantrums that do come up\n  \u2022 Less guilt about the time you spend on other tasks\u00a0\n\nWhen to Try Special Time\n\nParents have said that five minutes of Special Time when children wake up can make getting up, eating breakfast, and getting out the door all run smoother with less arguments and resistance. After school squabbles can be fixed with a few moments of Special Time, and a Special Time session before homework or nerve-inducing new experiences, from a class to meeting relatives, can help ease stress and upset.\n\nHow Long is Long Enough?\n\nWe hear you! Special Time can sound daunting. It can be hard to let go of your agenda, it can be hard to follow your little one, and yes, it can be hard to play. But even five minutes of Special Time, once or twice a week will be enough for you to feel the difference. From there, you\u2019ll feel confident setting your timer for longer and longer sessions.\n\nSet up Special Time\n\nReady to jump in and let your children have their moment? Here\u2019s how to set up Special Time in 4 quick steps.\n\nName it: It can be \u201cPaul\u2019s Special Time,\u201d \u201cPaul\u2019s Power Moment,\u201d or simply \u201cSpecial Time,\u201d but do make the distinction so that they can take ownership.\n\nPlan it: Announce that you\u2019d like to spend some Special Time. Say when it will be \u2013 whether it\u2019s later that day or coming up this weekend \u2013 and for how long it will run.\n\nEnjoy it: Choose a time frame that isn\u2019t stressful to you, set a timer and then let your sole focus be on your child and how he or she sees the world right now.\n\nEnd it: When the timer rings, tell your child how much you enjoyed the time and set the limit to stop. It\u2019s quite possible your child will demand more, but promise more soon and stick to the limit. As they become accustomed to Special Time, they\u2019ll trust in it and look forward to the moment that they take charge.\n\nAnd so will you \u2013 we promise!\n\nGive Special Time a go and let us know how you like it.

        "text":"Why it is important to do a wedding venue viewing\n\nOne of the things I do insist on doing with my wedding couple is a wedding venue viewing. Many couples feel that this is not a necessary step until they do it so I thought it was worth writing down some of the advantages.\n\nwedding venue viewing\nthe venue is chosen for a reason \u2013 be sure to photograph it accordingly\n\nThe wedding venue was chosen for a reason\n\nThis reflects your personal style and taste for your big day. The photographer needs to capture the essence of the venue to be able to tell the story in full. By meeting with the wedding couple before the big day you can go over why they chose that venue and what draws you as a couple to it. There may be certain visual elements that really capture your imagination.\n\nwedding venue viewing\nbridal suite preparation \u2013 no clutter\n\nSeeing the bridal suite\n\nWhere the bride will get ready is important. you need to see the lighting and space\u00a0available\u00a0here as well as establish how many people will be in the room. Prepping the bride to make sure it stays clear of clutter etc and where to hang the dress etc ready will also save time on the big day and make sure things run more smoothly.\n\n\nwedding venue viewing\nring ceremony \u2013 showing the bridal couple how to put on the ring for a good shot is important\n\nThe ceremony area\n\nThis is by far one of the most imperative. You cannot stop the ceremony halfway through to get a better shot. So for me as the photographer i really need to know where the officiant will stand, where the couple will stand, will he face you to the crowd? Will your bridesmaids and groomsmen stand or be seated? is there enough space for me and the videographer if there is one? Is it possible to create more space? what is the lighting like? if its an outdoor ceremony this needs to be seen at the same time of day as the ceremony will be . Because shadows and lights at that time of day\u00a0can be very challenging and may affect your photos so we need to see how we can work around it. In addition \u2013 How will everyone walk down the aisle? timing of this is also important to make sure each individual has a photo walking down the aisle especially with lots of bridesmaids and groomsmen. Finally coaching is needed for putting on the ring to get the right shot and the final kiss- well lets just make sure its a long one \ud83d\ude42\n\nwedding venue viewing\nwedding venue viewing \u2013 use whats important to the bride and groom\n\nscouting out an area for the family photos and couple photos\n\nAgain lighting is important here. But more essentially it gives me a sense of what backdrops and scenery there is around. As well as textures and elements that can create great shots. If I can see this before the wedding it really allows me to plan what shots i want to do and helps this process flow better on the day. After all you only have about half an hour as you dont want to keep your guests waiting so this really needs to be done timeously and without any delays. The more prepared I can be the less time wasted and the better quality photos you will get out of it. Its also important to incorporate what the couple wants \u2013 I may have a different vision and can discuss this with them, but if they want something different we can discuss this beforehand and make sure they are getting the photos and backdrops they want. It is after all their wedding.\n\nThe reception hall\n\nIt is again important to see lighting and space in this area. It is also important to know where the bridal couple will enter, and where the speeches will be so that i can set up lighting beforehand and cause minimal distraction on the day.\n\nActual Venue Location\n\nFinally If i have not been to the venue before it is very important to get the location right.There is no time to get lost on the day. So by going to the venue beforehand you can make sure you have the right location, you know exactly where the bridal suite, ceremony, reception etc will be held (some venues have multiple receptions etc) And I do not need to phone the bride or groom with more issues when they already may be quite stressed out . I can quietly and routinely go through my shots and make sure I am getting everything we have discussed in our pre wedding meeting and venue viewing.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nI hope this helps clear the air as many people do not feel this is a necessary step . I for one think this is definitely a must. I dont charge for my time for a venue viewing only the travel. it may cost a bit extra but when you are already investing money into your wedding photos this is a very small amount to make sure you are getting the greatest \u201creturn\u201d on your investment.\n\nwedding venue viewing\nsee where the best light is , textures and elements\n\n\n    Leave a Comment\n\n    error: Content is protected !!",

(Source: Getty Images)\n\nShuchita Dua Dullu\n\nChances are that at some point your child will meet a child who has special needs or have a classmate who is differently-abled. Though children are less likely to be apprehensive about making friends \u2013 they may still need our guidance on how they can befriend other children who may have special needs. Here are a few tips on how to teach your child to be more compassionate & understanding while interacting with children who have special needs.\n\nDon\u2019t treat them differently because of their condition\n\nTheir condition may be new to you, but to the child, it\u2019s a fact of life and thus should be treated as such. There\u2019s no need to get nervous, fussy or antsy about their condition.\n\nRead| Special needs kids: How can parents secure their children\u2019s future?\n\n\nChildren with special needs are often left out of birthday parties or other activities outside of school. Encourage your child to invite them. Also, make sure that the activities planned for the event are such that everyone can participate and not feel left out.\n\n\nIt is possible that children with special needs may think and play differently, so ensure that you have a conversation about this with your child so that they know what to expect. Sometimes, they do things more slowly than others in a group. Teach your child how to engage in parallel play, which involves playing side-by-side without much interaction.\n\nRead| Do not ignore signs of special education needs in children. Intervene early\n\nAvoid making assumptions\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to ask questions if you\u2019re unsure. If you\u2019re well-meaning and ask politely they are likely to be willing to talk or share their experiences. Additionally, it\u2019s not wise to assume that someone with a developmental condition is intellectually disabled. Treat them in an age-appropriate way.\n\nTalk to them the same way you\u2019d talk to another child their age\n\nIt is best not to patronise or talk to them in a manner that may suggest they are not viewed as equal or capable. Use a tone and body language that conveys respect for them.\n\n\nAcceptance is the key to building a close bond with a child who has special needs. Encourage your child to get to know and understand them as an individual first, and be more open to learning about their condition and the challenges they face without making judgements.\n\nSee the person and the disability\n\nThey want to be seen as a person first, with their own individual characteristics and capabilities acknowledged \u2013 while also having their limits and challenges respected. Encourage your child to keep this mind and accommodate their needs, recognise their strengths, and listen to them.\n\nMore parents and children should be encouraged to acknowledge the potential of a kid with special needs. The idea is not just to treat them with compassion when circumstances bring us closer together, but to try and form a bond with them and recognize them as someone with the potential to become a real friend!\n\n(The author is senior child psychologist, Mom\u2019s Belief)\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

In the past, finding a partner for international ladies was often a long and annoying process. You had to travel foreign and wish that the potential suitor was positioned in a place conducive to dating. Now, you can just use the Internet and key in keywords such as \u201cpless dating\u201d or \u201cbarbaric romantic endeavors. \u201d Soon, you will be linked to pages incorporating potential matches for you and your prospective husband-to-be.\n\nJust be attentive of the ladies that you just choose. Do not forget that there are always scams out there. Whenever someone guarantees you the moon, there is always the danger that they are merely trying to get as much money out of you as possible.\n\nOne method you can use to determine the reliability of a potential date is to see if she has her site. Generally, overseas women who are curious about dating guys will sign-up their labels on well-known dating Internet sites. This way, any information that they post will appear in the screen of each and every computer that they log onto. Be cautious of women who also are leaving a comment information about themselves that could only be seen by members for the web page.\n\nWhen you have noticed the woman who interests you, avoid jump in the online dating community too quickly. Start with sending her e-mails at the original convenience. At the start, she will probably be rather impressed by the fact that you\u2019ve taken the problem to contact her. Try to require a little affinity for her environment and her habits. Concentrate, whether the girl seems happy or not, whether the woman seems friendly and extroverted or otherwise.\n\nTend assume that she\u2019ll automatically adore you in the first working day you meet her. If your woman does acknowledge you, keep in mind that women are different than traditional western men. They might take longer to realize that they just like a guy whom treats associated with respect. In the event you treat her badly, the girl may not give back your feelings.\n\nA possibility to know for certain is usually to meet in person. However , undoubtedly one simple approach to eliminate every doubt from your mind before you at any time meet her. If your woman doesn\u2019t appear too forward, try to find out why. Luxury ? going on a prolonged trip or perhaps is she making the effort00 at a new place? It certainly is a good idea to fulfill somewhere community. That way, you can get a gauge on her disposition before you provide her house.\n\nA lot of foreign dating sites allow associates from everywhere to register. This provides you with you the possibility to see if there exists a common blended. If there is, in that case you\u2019re off to a terrific starting point. If there is not, then you can often choose another site that does accept affiliates from that region. Just make sure that you use the discretion when ever selecting your particular date.\n\nWhile it\u2019s wise to use careful attention when getting together with foreign women, you must do not forget that you\u2019re working with people in whose cultures differ from yours. You have to keep in mind that they might interpret factors differently than you might. If you come around as being too pushy or perhaps too clingy, you will probably end up being turned off from the beginning. Always keep in mind that object is always to simply have thrilling learn more about someone else. If you can accomplish that, will probably be a positive experience.\n\nCrucial keep in mind that a great number of ladies usually do not like to consider orders from anyone. When you ask them to resolve something or perhaps go shopping just for something, then you could find yourself sitting on the sidelines on the transaction mainly because they aren\u2019t interested. Foreign women are generally self-sufficient. They want to look for the best deal for themselves, and if you make an effort to dictate exactly what they want, then you might turn them off.\n\nAmong the worst mistakes you could ever make should be to make the methodology of requesting her away right.

She needs to know that most likely just looking to be a pleasant guy and present her a likelihood. If you pressure her to consider an immediate solution, then your lady might get afraid off and refuse to go after you.\n\nIn terms of dating foreign ladies, you must treat these people like queens. They need the best treatment at all times. They are not expecting to be remedied like trash. Don\u2019t such as you can do while not giving them the full interest. You should always be willing to give her the full interest, but you need to be careful about it.

        "text":"How Your Communication Can Help Reduce Relationship Tension\n\nby Joe Tabers, CSP\n\nWhen ineffective communication or communication style between two or more people becomes a reoccurring issue, it can create unnecessary tension in relationships. This tension between individuals not only can take some of the enjoyment out of a task or project; if it continues; it can negatively affect team performance and results.In your past interactions with people at work as well as home, it is likely you have observed or even encountered some bad communication and relationship experiences. If you\u2019re like me, you must have noticed how consistently this added tension can \u201ceat away\u201d at interpersonal trust, and reduce or even kill team spirit.\n\nThere Is Hope\n\nThe good news is that this relationship tension can often be reduced or even eliminated by making a sincere effort at adjusting\/adapting our own style of communicating to better \u201cmatch\u201d the other person\u2019s style of communicating. The purpose of this article is to share you two types of communication adjustments for you to consider practicing for more easily connecting with your coworkers, clients, customers or family members.\n\nThe two types of communication adjustments I am referring to are your pace and priority when communicating with others. For clarification;\u00a0Pace\u00a0relates to\u00a0how quickly\u00a0you\u00a0or\u00a0they\u00a0prefer to communicate (speak, listen and respond). Priority\u00a0relates to your or their\u00a0need for socializing\u00a0(relationship oriented)\u00a0versus getting down to business\u00a0(task oriented). See illustation.\n\nThere is an old saying that seems to fit well here\u00a0\u201cHe who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened\u201d.\u00a0Lao-tzu 531 B.C.. If so, then I believe that\u2026 \u201che who knows and controls himself is even better off than enlightened\u201d.\u00a0Joe Tabers,CSP 2003.\n\nSo How Can We Help Improve Communication?\n\nOur first communication challenge\u00a0then is to recognize our own natural style or tendencies when communicating with others.\u00a0\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a psychologist to do this for yourself (or even to observe it in others). Simply ask yourself these two questions:\n\n  \u2022 Eighty percent of the time when I\u2019m communicating with others do I tend to have a naturally slower or naturally faster pace? or. .(is their pace naturally slower or faster?)\n  \u2022 Am I naturally more task driven more relationship driven? or\u2026(are they more task driven or relationship driven?)\n\nFor example: if my natural style is usually more fast-paced and relationship oriented I have what is often referred to as an influencing or expressive style. Another example would be if my natural style is usually more slower paced and task driven I have what might be referred to as more of an analyzing or thinking style. ( See illustration again).\n\nOur second challenge\u00a0is to recognize that our own natural strengths under stress or carried to the extreme can often come across or be perceived by others as sources of irritation or communication weaknesses.\n\nTip # 1:\u00a0 slowing down your rate of delivery and responding if you are naturally fast-paced or speeding up if you are naturally slow-paced can really help here. Likewise being patient with others with a naturally slower delivery or appreciating the energy of others with a naturally fast-paced delivery also helps here.\n\nTip # 2:\u00a0 controlling your need to socialize or relate to others i.e. excessive small talk or controlling your tenancy to get down to business and cut communication short can really help here. Likewise increasing your tolerance for other\u2019s needs to either \u201crelate\u201d more emotion or details to you or to respect other\u2019s needs to \u201cget down to business\u201d with little or no small talk \u2026 can help you increase rapport in this relationship area.\n\nA willingness on your part\u00a0to adjust your style of communicating according to the style of those who you are dealing with can go a long way to help building healthier relationships while improving teamwork.\u00a0Hint:\u00a0Don\u2019t wait for others to adjust their style to yours\u2026Take the initiative make the effort to\u00a0adapt your style to theirs.\n\nThink about it\u2026When we visit a foreign country or even when we\u2019re a guest someone else\u2019s home we usually make an effort to adapt to their culture, language, dining style or norms. If we don\u2019t, we risk comming across as unpleasant or a source of irritation for them. Conversely if you had guests in your home you would probably find it irritating if they were critical of the way you did things and you wouldn\u2019t want them telling you how or what to cook!\n\nSo during your next meeting or interactions with other people within your organization, department or family\u2026consider this reminder.\u00a0Watch for opportunities to control your natural strengths\/tendencies when communicating and look for opportunities to be more flexible with their natural strengths\/communication tendencies.\u00a0In doing this\u00a0you too will help in the easing of relationship tensions. What is the benefit for your efforts? How about greater respect, results and cooperation from others. Not bad for a little extra effort!\n\nJoe Tabers, CSP\u00a0is a certified speaking professional, senior consultant and one of our most requested communication skill-building specialists.

        "text":"By: Jalynn Johnson, CSW\n\nWelcome back! This is Part 2 of 3 on Dr. Dan Siegel\u2019s book, No Drama Discipline. If you missed Part 1, go and check it out! We covered how we can change our discipline philosophy to parent from an intentional place, rather than from a place of reactivity. We also learned about how our child\u2019s brain is growing and developing, and how that needs to be taken into consideration as we parent and redirect our children. These next chapters will address how to help our child move from having a tantrum to a more calm and teachable state. To carry that further, the next chapter gives information on steps parents can take to really put this No-drama parenting into action.\n\nConnection is the tool that is addressed in this chapter. It is the tool that can help our children regulate. It can help a child move from reactivity to receptivity. Throughout a meltdown or outburst, it is important that we stay emotionally connected to our child. We stay connected by staying near them, or in the same room, we provide empathic words such as: \u201cThat would make me upset too!\u201d and we offer physical touch, such as sitting close, holding a hand, rocking, etc. This connection will deepen your relationship with your child. They may know that you will be there for them through the good (at their performances, snuggling reading a book) but now you will show them that you will also stick around for the bad. Work hard to make connection your first response.\n\nConnection Principle #1: Turn Down the Shark Music\nWhen we parent out of fear and on past experiences that don\u2019t apply to the current situation we miss out on what is actually happening and do not cater to the child\u2019s needs in the current moment. We still need to pay attention to patterns of behavior over time. We cannot get trapped in a state of denial and give excuses for our kid\u2019s behaviors. Sometimes we do need to expect more of them and have them take more responsibility. This is always done wisely when parenting intentionally and in the moment.\n\nConnection Principle #2: Chase the Why\nBe a curious parent, chase the why. I wonder why my child did that? What is she wanting here? Is she asking something? What is she communicating? Remember, do not ASK the why, CHASE the why. Ask these questions to yourself. A lot of times children don\u2019t understand why they did something, they don\u2019t have the proper language to express it. That is why you as a parent, who is higher functioning, need to be curious, open, and empathic to the child and figure out what could be behind the behaviors.\n\nConnection Principle #3: Think About the How\nWhat we say is just as important as HOW we say it. What is your tone of voice? Is it shaming? An example: \u201cGet in bed now or you won\u2019t get any stories\u201d vs. \u201cIf you get in bed now, we\u2019ll have time to read. But if you don\u2019t get in bed right away, we\u2019ll run out of time and have to skip reading.\u201d What a difference!\n\nNo-Drama Connection Cycle\n\nStrategy #1: Communicate comfort\nWords are helpful to help calm a child, but what is even more important are the non-verbals of nurturing, mainly touch.\n\nStrategy #2: Validate, validate, validate\nWe need to let our kids know that we hear them, that we\u2019re with them in the middle of all those big feelings and we\u2019ll always be there, even if they\u2019re at their worst. When we tell our kids how to feel or how to not feel we invalidate their experience. We can first identify the emotion for them and then connect with it.\n\nStrategy #3: Stop Talking and Listen\nA child isn\u2019t capable of responding to logic when in a heightened emotional state. Sometimes talking a lot can make it worse, it floods the child and leads to more dysregulation. Instead, sit with your child and listen to them. Give them time to express themselves.\n\nStrategy #4: Reflect What You Hear\nStep back and reflect to your child what they\u2019ve said, communicating to them that they\u2019ve been heard. Let them know you understand their experience, you can help soothe their big emotions, calm their inner chaos, and lead them to use their upstairs brain.",

        "text":"Conversation Starters With Girls\n\n\nConversation starters with girls don\u2019t have to be fancy or complicated. And contrary to popular belief, you definitely do not need to see sparks flying during your first conversation to land a first date with a girl! In addition to these conversation starters, remember to be yourself, show confidence and relax! Conversations with girls are fun, after all!\n\n\nStart with a compliment. A compliment is an excellent conversation starter with girls. It\u2019s a fact that girls love compliments! However, make sure your compliment is genuine, not creepy. And keep sexual innuendo out of the conversation. Something simple like \u201cYou have beautiful eyes\u201d will do the trick just fine.\n\n\nTry a little humor. Humorous lines can work wonders when starting a conversation with a girl. But be careful. Your humor should be cute, playful, funny and perhaps even a little corny. These types of humor work much better than sexually suggestion language. That\u2019s not to imply you shouldn\u2019t imply a romantic relationship. Try something like \u201cWhat are you going as for Halloween? This year, I\u2019m going as your boyfriend!\u201d\n\n\nTalk about her. One of the all time best ways to start a conversation with a \u00a0girl is to ask about her! Girls love to talk about themselves almost as much as they love compliments. Asking sincere questions about her is sure to get the conversation going. When you first meet, say something along the lines of \u201cYou have the look of a country girl. Where are you from?\u201d\n\nwhat she's doing.jpg\n\nAsk about what she\u2019s doing. A more advanced strategy to starting a conversation with a girl is to ask not about her life, but about what she\u2019s doing now. Is she reading a book? Having a drink? Working out? Wherever you meet a girl, she\u2019s bound to be doing something, and asking her about it will strike up a great conversation!\n\nshow comments\n\nWhat Others Are Reading Right Now.",
