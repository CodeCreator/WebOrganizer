        "text":"Get Connected\n\nWith RadioShack gone \ud83d\ude25 I have had to find a way to get the connectors I need to get the many builds properly assembled; enter Amazon. I am a prime member (I\u2019m sure they hate me for it) so I get free, 2 day shipping on just about everything. This is key when you run across a need and your project is at a stopping point because of it.\u00a0\n\nFinding good connectors is a pain. Most are Chinese cheapo\u2019s, but now-a-days; there isn\u2019t much else. So you spend as much in trial and error on buying sight unseen connectors as you do installing them. Below are the ones I have found that have held up.\n\n3 Different Types of Connections\n\nGetting something easily in\/out for transport, repairs or upgrades is key. Especially as your project grows you may need to reconfigure to get more features into your project. In my mind there are 3 different types of connections: Quick, semi-permanent and permanent\n\nQuick Connectors\n\nThere are a few different quick connectors that I use that I have found work well. For most of what my box pulls, low amp, 12 volt wires and connections work fine. In fact, may be a must. (see later article on wire gauges) Sometimes you need to get creative when you have multiple related accessories that need to get plugged in. For those I am using a modified Ethernet cable and in the past I have used a old computer serial cable. I will get more info about those as we go. For batteries and other 2 wire connections like the smoke machines I use 18awg wire barrel quick connects.\n\nIf this retailer doesn\u2019t have them, there are dozens on amazon and Ebay that do. These support 5amp current well and I have spiked to 10amp on the 2 main power supplies and I have seen them work just fine (although it exceeds the manufacturer speccs)\n\nSemi Permanent Connectors\n\nSemi-permanent connectors are those that need to be able to be removed, but not very often.\n\nThese Screw Terminal Strip Blocks not only allow for semi-permanent connections but help you keep things clean and organized inside your project.\n\nOnce you get everything mapped out and wired you can take a picture of it, put in in MS Powerpoint and add labels to remember what is what.\n\nAdditionally you can use blue painters tape to label the post important wires. The little red #6 fork is ideal for the small gauge wire you will use.\n\nPermanent Connectors\n\nPermanent connectors are connections that need to be soldered in place or direct wired. I will admit I started off using permanent techniques and quickly switch over the frustration to quick and semi-permanent connections, but there\u00a0 are connections at certain points where this will be necessary. Components that have motorized parts and vibrate should be soldered. Close, closed or small areas that don\u2019t have the room for connectors should be soldered.\n\nNote: You should always use some form of connection. Just running a bare with through an eyelet connector is just an event of failure waiting to happen. I ONLY use electrical take as a temporary fix.\n\nSoldering kits these days are pretty cheap. I use a large kit I purchased from Radioshack before they closed. Cheap however doesn\u2019t mean good. For the soldering iron cheap ones only last for 30 hours or so of use. For a project guy that is about a year.\n\nHere is a cheap starter kit.",

For more information about LiFePO4 and the other cells please search on internet get more message. The other blog is why LiFePO4 battery is not common use on ebike and ebike kits.\n\nFirst we list the common sells we normally use.\n\nSamsungModel\u00a0NO\u00a0CapacityDischarge rate\nChina\u00a0cells186502200mAh5C\n\nThose are common use Li-Mon2 cells for electric bike and electric bike conversion kit. But it not means don't more capacity use.\u00a0\n\nAs we know 18650 cells voltage is 3.7v, capacity as sheet show. And you could also see that discharge rate 2c \/3c \/5c. 2c battery mainly use on low wattage motor ebike and ebike kit. 3c \/ 5c is better use on larger wattage motor e bike and e bike kit.\n\nWhat is 2c \/ 3c \/ 5c ?\n\nThe general charge and discharge current size of the commonly used charge and discharge magnification to that,\n\nThat is: charge and discharge rate = charge and discharge current \/ rated capacity; For example: rated capacity of 100Ah battery with 20A discharge, the discharge rate of 0.2C. Battery discharge rate C, 1C, 2C, 0.2C is the battery discharge rate: a measure of the speed of discharge. The capacity of 1 hour discharge is completed, known as 1C discharge; 5 hours discharge is completed, it is called 1\/5 = 0.2C discharge. The discharge capacity of the battery can generally be detected by a different discharge current. For the 24AH battery, the 2C discharge current is 48A and the 0.5C discharge current is 12A.\n\nSo before order battery we match the right discharge rate.\nMatch 250w hub motor electric bike and electric bike conversion kit Samsung 2600mah\u00a0cells, and panasonic 3400mah cells. The other wattage for example 350w 500w 750w 1000w and 1500w it is better use 3c and 5c cells.\n\nAbout battery voltage and capacity:\n\nEach of 18650 cells voltage is 3.7v, when you need a\n36v battery pack, you should\u00a0series 10 cells together, 10x 3.7v =37v\n48v battery pack, will 13s =13 x 3.7v =48.1v\n\nCapacity is different, for example when your want a 10.4Ah Samsung 2600mah cells battery pack.\nIt is 4 Pcs cells\u00a04 in parallel together = 4 x 2.6Ah = 10.4Ah\n14.5Ah Samsung 2900mah cells will be 5s\u00a0 \u00a05 x 2.9Ah = 14.5Ah\n\nSo when you need a\n36v 10.4Ah Samsung cells battery pack, it is 10s x 4p = 40 Pcs Samsung 2600mah 18650 cells.\n48v 14.5Ah Samsung cells battery pack, it is 13s x 5p = 65 Pcs Samsung 2900mah 18650 cells.\n\n3 users like this.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"I know there's been some previous threads discussing these type of cameras before, but I thought I would add one that's specific to a Blackvue dashcam install in the W205. Below is an illustrated story line of how I did mine .. hope it helps.\u00a0\n\nEquipment as follows: (I won't repeat specs since Google has that side of things well and truly covered)\n\n  \u2022 Blackvue DR600GW\n  \u2022 Power Magic Pro (also from Blackvue; This unit will allow the camera to keep recording once the car is turned off and it also prevents the battery from being drained)\n\nWhat you need:\n\n  \u2022 Fuse taps (Blade type; x2)\n  \u2022 Wire rimpers\n  \u2022 Thin plastic spatula (even credit card will do)\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Mount the camera\n  \u2022 Run the cable through the top of the headliner and then out towards the side. Using a small plastic card to gently open the edge is all that's needed. Once you're on the side near the door you can follow the rubber lining (red dotted line is where I've run the wire)\n  \u2022 Keep following the roof lining all the way to the back. The joiner near the B-Pillar is easy to open up enough for the cable to pass through; there's no need to undo any clips or lining completely.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Once at the back, follow the upper line of the C-Pillar. I found that the lower segment where the air bag meets the seat was too tightly clipped joined so I just ran it along the upper part all the way to the back screen and then back around towards the seat where the rear speaker is on the shelf.\u00a0\n  \u2022 From there it's an easy path along the lower edge of the seats into the trunk. The blackvue ran out of cable about 3\/4 along the rear seats but that's not an issue. The PowerMagic has plenty of cable length to make up for the shortfall. The 12V socket to plug in the unit can hide under the lower edge of the seat (I used some adhesive tape to secure it from rattling around within the seat cavity.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Now remove the rear liner covering the fuse box. You need to make three connections with the PowerMagic Pro:\u00a0\n    - Yellow wire goes to a permanent batter 12V connection. I found this on one of the lower right fuse points that were unused.\u00a0\n    - Red wire goes to an Accessory switched 12V connection. I found this in position 445 (labelled Socket 12V in trunk)\n    - Black wire goes to ground; I used an M8 chassis bolt located near the upper right corner of the fuse assembly.\n\nTidy up your wires, set the PowerMagic timing dip switches as desired and plug it all in. Done! ..",

And\nWe can use it single(four amplifier) or bridge Mode.\n\nThe gain of each amplifier is fixed at 20 dB (26 dB in BTL).\n\nA special feature of this device is:\nMute\/standby switch\n\u2022 low stand-by current (< 100 \u00b5A)\n\u2022 low mute\/stand-by switching current (low-cost supply switch)\n\u2022 mute facility\n\nPins list\u00a0\n1 NINV1 non-inverting input 1\n2 INV1 inverting input 1\n3 GND ground (signal)\n4 RR supply voltage ripple rejection\n5 VP1 positive supply voltage 1\n6 OUT1 output 1\n7 GND1 power ground 1 (substrate)\n8 OUT2 output 2\n9 n.c. not connected\n10 OUT3 output 3\n11 GND2 power ground 2 (substrate)\n12 OUT4 output 4\n13 VP2 positive supply voltage 2\n14 M\/SS mute\/stand-by switch\n15 n.c. not connected\n16 INV2 inverting input 2\n17 NINV2 non-inverting input 2\n\n\u00a0Basic block diagram inside TDA1554 Amplifier\n\nSee below it is basic block diagram inside circuit.\n\nThen look at the circuit real using below.\n\n4 Channel Home Audio Amplifier 11 watt using TDA1554\n\nThis amplifier circuit is easy to build. Just use a single IC, but it has 4 channels, 11 watts per channel.\n\nWhich it is Philip TDA1554 number. It is suitable for listening at home or in any vehicle.\n\nJust use the power supply 12-15 volt or will be used to increase any home theater sound system.\n\nIn first 2-channel amplifier is front speakers. And 2 channel back can be surround sound speakers, too.\n\nHow it works\n\nSee the circuit diagram below.\n\n4 Channel Home Audio Amplifier 11 watt using IC TDA1554\n\n4 Channel Home Audio Amplifier 11 watt using IC TDA1554\n\nThis circuit requires a power supply, 12 volts to 18 volts at Power consumption at 5A.\n\nIt has 4 inputs, pins 1, 2, 17, and 16. They are divided into 2 channels non-inverting (Pin 1, 17) and 2 channels inverting inputs (pins 2, 16).\n\nWhich we can pick usage as want the output as in-phase or out-of-phase.\n\nThe output will be 4 channels on pin 6, 8, 12, and 10. And, C7 through C10 serves to increase the low-frequency stability better before going to the speaker.\n\nThe switch S1 is the mute button. By pressing S1 will be closed sound system circuit in Mute mode. But if Release the switch S1 standby ready to work.\n\nThe C5 and C6 will filter light to smooth out and eliminate interference.\n\nStereo amplifier 22 watts using TDA1554\n\nThis circuit has a moderate wattage, 22 watts + 22 watts. It is perfect for listening at home or in any car.\n\nAlso, it is a simple circuit, Use small pieces of equipment.\n\nAnd more importantly, it uses only one IC, TDA1554Q. Inside it has a short-circuit protection circuit with the output.\n\nHow it works\n\nSee in the circuit. Here is the principle of the circuit.\n\n22W+22W Stereo Power Amplifier with Single Chip IC using TDA1554\n\n22W+22W Stereo Power Amplifier with Single Chip TDA1554\n\nThe circuit will receive an input signal on each channel through C1 and C2. They will be signal coupling or filter a just AC signal only.\n\nAnd the left channel input signal works the same as the right channel.\n\nSo, I explained just left alone.\n\nThe signal via from C1 to the pin1 and pin 2 of IC1.\n\nWhich the pin1 is position of non-inverter input. It will amplify the signal in no reverse phase to output pin 6.\n\nAnd, pin 2 is inverting input in reverse phase to output pin 8.\n\nWhich it will be seen that both outputs pin 6 and Pin 8 are phase signals the opposite. So it will provide power increases itself.\n\nPower consumption in use max up about 5 A at 12V. The speaker will be a 4-ohm speaker. So the power of sound is 22 watts.\n\nBut if you use any 8-ohms speaker. The power is lower.\n\nWhile the circuit works. The IC will generate heat up. So, you should enough heatsink.\n\nBuy TDA1554\n\n\nTA8225 BTL Amplifiers circuit\n\nDatasheet Pinout\n\nTA8225\u2019s PCB. But I not have it. Thus I search on internet.

There are a lot of choices for you. A transistor is good, but the IC also well. Today I suggest you try to test HA13118. It is 18 W BTL Audio Power Amplifier for Hitachi. I like the AC motor for Hitachi. It is very durable. Good quality, even a brand from Japan. Of course, an audio IC is the same.\n\nWhy should use it\n\nThe HA13118 is a class AB amplifier integrated circuit. Hitachi designs them for component car stereo amplifiers. At the power supply voltage of 13.2V and 4 \u2126 load speaker.\n\nPackage of HA13118 BTL amplifier\n\nThis power IC provides an output power of 18W with 10% distortion. In general, we use it in the bridge amplifier in a car. They have basic features as follows.\n\n  \u2022 You can use it anywhere. Because It requires a wide voltage supply of 8V to 18V in single voltage. At the current of 1A to 2A.\n  \u2022 Output current Io (peak) 4 A\n  \u2022 Power dissipation PT 15 W\n  \u2022 But max voltage is 26V\n  \u2022 Typical gain rates up to 55 dB.\n  \u2022 Less than 0.2% distortion at 1W\n  \u2022 Response frequencies from 30 Hz-30 kHz.\n  \u2022 Operating temperature\u00a0 \u201330 to +80 \u00b0C\n  \u2022 Small outline package, easy to mount\n  \u2022 Internal each protection circuits\n    \u2022 Surge protection circuit\n    \u2022 Thermal shut-down circuit\n    \u2022 The ground fault protection circuit\n    \u2022 Power supply fault protection circuit\n\nRead more datasheet\n\nHow does it work\n\nHA13118 18W Bridge Amplifier circuit\n\nSee in the circuit above.\n\nEnter a power supply circuit, 12V. And then, enter an audio signal into the input. The signal flows through VR1. To adjust the level of the audio signal. Next, the C1 passeses the coupling signal to the input of IC1. And, the C2 eliminate the noises. After that, the audio signal gets into pin 3 of IC1. This is a bridge amplifier form(BTL). If you love Car amplifier circuit. You always see the BTL amplifier. Because it gives high power in the same voltage. See circuit inside the IC has Left and right channel. We connect both amplifiers together. To increase more power wattage. We can observe from the pin 15(left channel) connects one wire of the speaker. And pin 8(right channel) connects to another wire of the same speaker. Which the C7 and C8 will feedback a signal to be frequency response better. And, The C9, C10, R1, and R2 will reduce the noise signal. We hear a lower annoying hum in the background of power amplifiers. Because we add C11 and C12. If you increase C12-2200uF electrolytic more. It will reduce the ripple voltage of the voltage power supply.\n\nParts you will need\n\nIC1: HA13118 18 W BTL Audio Power Amplifier\nR1, R2: 2.2ohms 0.25W resistor\nVR1: Potentiometer 10K\n\nElectrolytic capacitor\n\nC1: 2.2uF 50V\nC3, C4, C6, C7, C8: 100uF 25V\nC5: 10uF 50V\nC12: 2,200uF 25V\n\nCeramic capacitors\nC2: 100pF 50V\nC9, C10, C11: 0.1uF 50V\nSpeaker 4 to 8 ohms\n\nPower supply 8V to 18V at 2A.\n\n\nI always try to make Electronics Learning Easy.\n\n5 thoughts on \u201cHow to use TDA1554, TA8225, HA13118 audio bridge amplifier circuits\u201d\n\n  1. What type of switch(push or normal) should I use in the tda1554 circuit and also can I use 10watts 4ohm speaker to the tda1554q amplifier circuit?\n\n    \u2022 Hello Kishok,\n\n      Thanks for your question. I like it.\n\n      In truth, I have never built it. But I believe you can do it.\n      I think you are a person who likes to learn new things.\n\n      As its symbolism, it is probably the most common normal on\/off type.\n\n      And yes you can use 10 watts 8 ohms speaker.\n      In 4 Channel Home Audio Amplifier 11 watt using TDA1554.\n      It is an OTL amplifier mode.

Dear twam:\n\n    Thank you for your wonderfull articles about alix.3d3 board. I am working in a project in Voyage Linux for this board, and I am very pleased of how everything works with release 0.6.5. Very small bugs with a very good functionallity. I have readed your articles about LEDS, GPIO, etc... and they helped much. The problem I have, as I readed in one of your articles is that I want to use the gpio24 for a switch and I have asked about it and If I don't want to compile the kernell (I hate that) I can now use and load with modprobe the cs5535 as this:\n\n    voyage:~# modprobe cs5535_gpio\n\n    voyage:~# dmesg | grep gpio\n    [ 14.847516] cs5535_gpio: base=0x6100 mask=0xb003c66 major=253\n\n    voyage:~# lsmod | grep gpio\n    cs5535_gpio 3744 0\n\n    voyage:~# ls -l \/dev\/cs5535*\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 1 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio1\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 10 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio10\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 11 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio11\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 12 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio12\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 13 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio13\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 2 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio2\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 24 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio24\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 25 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio25\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 27 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio27\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 5 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio5\n    crw-rw---- 1 root root 253, 6 Jun 6 21:37 \/dev\/cs5535_gpio6\n\n    And it's very easy and is ok. But just a stupid question. How can I read when I want or as is changed the value of the switch: 0\/1? Can you help me?\n\n    Thank you\n\n\n  2. Hi twam, thank you for your help. Leds trough gpio are working ok but I have questions about modeswitch: is it safe to use it as output for another led? I see that its buffer type is smb and not gp24 as the ones for leds?\n\n  3. @Bula\n    I think you could use the modeswitch GPIO Port for an LED if you connect to thru a resistor to 3V. But I would recommend to use an I\u00b2C Port Extender if you need more GPIO Pins.\n\n  4. For now I need only one LED so - do you mean to connect diode thru pull-up resistor on external 3V or directly on 3.3V that I get on the modeswitch pins?\n\n  5. OK thanks, it is what I was thinking but I was not sure cause of difference in buffer types between modeswitch and leds GPIO ports. Only thing I need now is external 3V \ud83d\ude42\n\n  6. Hi twam, thanks for your tutorial. It's very best...:)\n    But I have a question, in fact I have a problem. I built a power supply from use as battery, this system send a\n    electric signal on CTS pin of the COM1, but this PIN is not enabled on CS5536 (alix6e2), I read this on the manual.\n    I had an idea reading your tutorial, but I need help.\n    Can I send a electric signal on the switch, and can I read the change status...???\n    Also what would be the ideal power of the electrical signal...???\n\n    Can you help me, please...???\n\n\n\n  7. @Marco\n    As far as I know, there is no support for pin change notifications in the GPIO interface yet. So your programm would need to poll the pin very often and your signal must be long enough.\n\n  8. @twam\n\n    I've been working with the Alix.3d3 for a while now but only lately I had the need to use external interrupts.\n    I can understand that by polling one of the GPIO pins frequently enough, it could \"almost\" work as an interrupt. However, in my case, a \"real\" interrupt is necessary because I'm trying to connect a GPS PPS signal to this board (which in turn gives me precision for message time-stamping purposes). Do you know of any way to use the already \"visible\" pins on this board and make them interrupt inputs?\n\n    Thanks a lot\n\n  9. @twam\n    thanks for the prompt answer\n    So I have no idea what to do now with this, as unfortunately the included Geode doesn't even support the serial port handshake signals (for the PPS people often use the DCD signal). If you have any suggestion (other than polling some port), it would be really welcome!\n\n\nLeave a Reply to twam Cancel reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"A+ Certification: Part 3 \u2013 Hardware: Upgrades, Troubleshooting and Preventative Maintenance\n\nSection Objectives\n\nAfter you complete this section you will:\n\nUnderstand the troubleshooting process.\n\nUnderstand what POST is.\n\nUnderstand the different POST error codes.\n\nTroubleshooting Issues and Problems\n\nAs an IT support person, you will need to work with customers throughout your career. Most often, you will hear from your customers when something isn\u2019t working for them, and often times, they can be irate. As we used to say, \u201cThey never call the cable company when it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nProviding good customer service is extremely important in building a good relationship with your customers. Unfortunately, your troubleshooting job requires getting information from the customer who may not be in the frame of mind to provide it.\n\nWhat problem are you experiencing?\n\nFirst, you need to determine the user\u2019s problem in their own words. Though you may know it is not as they are explaining it, allowing the customer to explain the problem will help in the process of solving and calming them down.\n\nOne of the principles I learned in support was that the user was never at fault. Most often, the problem occurred because of some action taken by the user, though when you are discussing the issue with them, you need to keep the mindset that it is not their fault. This helps prevent their egos from being hurt because of something they may have done.\n\nMy first job in IT support provided a great deal of experience and taught me a lot about support. On my first day of work there, I arrived a few minutes early. An employee in a different department came over and found me and told me she had a problem. I was, of course, gung ho about solving my first issue. She explained that her laptop would not turn on. I proceeded to plug the power supply in for her. She was so embarrassed, I explained that it happens all the time and not to worry!\n\nIs it software or hardware related?\n\nAfter you determine the user\u2019s problem and ask some questions to understand it, determine at this point if it is a hardware or software issue. If it is a hardware issue, you will either need to send a tech or look at it yourself. If it is a software issue, many of these can be handled over the phone.\n\nDetermine More Information\n\nFind out if the user has experienced any error codes, beeps at bootup, or anything unusual. This can help in your troubleshooting when you have the equipment.\n\nAlso find out any symptoms the user may have been experiencing, or even more valuable, anything the user was doing when the computer started malfunctioning.\n\nI once received a help desk ticket for a vice president who\u2019s laptop stopped functioning. I picked it up from him to find out what the problem was. The computer would not turn on. I started removing components and coffee started dripped from the battery slot and hard drive. I called him and he explained that he \u201cspilled a cup of coffee into the laptop and it stopped working then and he forgot to tell me.\u201d\n\n\nPOST, or Power On Self Test is your first source of troubleshooting a problem. POST automatically runs when your computer is turned on and tests several components of your PC.\n\nThe Processor \u2013 if the test fails for the CPU, the system stops usually with no error code.\n\nROMs \u2013 POST checks the BIOS ROMs. If there is a problem, the system will stop, usually with no error code.\n\nDMA Controller \u2013 if there are any problems with the DMA controller, the system will stop.\n\nInterrupt Controller \u2013 if POST detects problems with the Interrupt Controller the system will give an audible error signal of one long beep then one short beep then the system stops.\n\nSystem Timing Chip \u2013 this chip provides timing signals for the bus and processor. Any errors will produce an audible error signal of one long beep and one short beep then the system stops.\n\nVideo Card \u2013 if the Video Card fails, there will be one long beep then two short beeps then the system halts.\n\nRAM \u2013 any RAM errors will generate a \u201c201: Memory Error\u201d message on the screen. Any error codes beginning with 2 indicate a memory error.\n\nKeyboard \u2013 a problem with the keyboard will result in a \u201c301: Keyboard Failure\u201d error message followed by a short beep. System may halt or may ignore the error.\n\nFloppy Drives \u2013 any problems will result i\nn a \u201c601: Floppy Disk\u201d error code appearing on the screen.\n\nOther Devices \u2013 POST checks the other ports and components of the computer, beeps, then continues. It also checks the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the hard drive. If it cannot find the MBR, it will freeze and not continue loading, otherwise it hands control over to the MBR (or DOS Boot Record (DBR) if it is booting from a floppy).\n\nSummary of POST error codes:\n\nError Code Problem Description\n1xx System Board problem\n161 CMOS Battery Failure\n164 Memory System Size error\n2xx Memory related problem\n3xx Keyboard problem\n4xx Monochrome video problem\n5xx Color video problems\n6xx Floppy Disk problem\n17xx Hard disk problem\n\nAfter studying this section you should:\n\nUnderstand the troubleshooting process.\n\nIdentify the problem with your customer. Is it hardware or software? Are they experiencing any error codes or indications? What were they doing when the problem started occuring?\n\nUnderstand what POST is.\n\nPOST, or Power On Self Test is the test the computer runs when you power it on. It checks components and peripherals for problems and reports a problem using beeps or an error message.\n\n> Understand the different POST error codes.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

These are all types of speaker enclosures or boxes, and all of these enclosure types are \"direct radiator\" enclosures. They are called this because the sound is produced directly from the \"radiator\" (the driver or speaker) without the assistance of a contrivance such as a horn. Other types such as, Bandpass, and Coupled Cavity enclosures are similar, but more complex.\n\nCardinal Rules for Enclosure Building\n\n1. Build only for the internal volume size recommended by the woofer manufacturer.\n\n2. Make the construction (sealed or ported) air-tight.\n\n3. It is invariably more advantageous to buy, rather than build, both economically and to assure quality of construction. If you are an experienced cabinet maker with the proper tools, it will make a good project, otherwise....\n\nNote, that enclosures exist solely for the purpose of accommodating the woofer. Tweeters and midranges do not have to be enclosed at all, though for the sake of convenience they are often mounted in enclosures along with the woofer. To help you decide which type is best for your purposes, we offer below some detailed explanations and illustrations of each type, along with information on the types of materials used in their construction and a few suggestions.\n\nwoofer box diagram\n\nAcoustic Suspension Enclosure\n\nThe simplest direct-radiator system. The rear of the driver is in a sealed enclosure, and none of the rear output of the driver contributes to the sound output. Depending upon how stiff the mechanical suspension is Vs how stiff the enclosed air in the enclosure is (and that's a function of the size of the box), you can have one of two enclosure types: either an Infinite Baffle enclosure, in which the mechanical suspension is the dominant source of system stiffness and the box is large; or an Acoustic Suspension enclosure, where the air in the box is the dominating stiffness and the box is small. Sealed boxes tend to be among the lowest efficiency systems for a given box size and bass cutoff frequency. They are however quite good at reproducing a fairly broad range with little deviation or distortion.\n\nVented Enclosure\n\nAlso the same as Bass Reflex, Ported, or Passive Radiator. Here, an aperture or port in the box provides a means for the rear output of the cone to contribute to the total output of the system. However, it only contributes over a very narrow range of frequencies. In fact, in a properly designed system, the front output of the cone is reduced at the same time the output of the port increases. Consequently the port does not re-enforce the output of the woofer; it REPLACES the output of the woofer at these frequencies. If done properly, this can significantly reduce distortion and increase power handling at very low frequencies, a region that can be difficult for drivers. A vented system can be up to 3 dB more efficient at certain frequencies than a sealed box system that has the same bass cutoff frequency and size.\n\nBandpass Enclosure\n\nThese are compound systems in that they have at least two enclosures: one on the front and one on the rear of the driver. The enclosure on the front, which looks remarkably like a vented box (because it is), acts as a low pass filter and can couple the output of the woofer more efficiently to the outside. They have several useful advantages. For example, the front enclosure can be used as a very effective acoustic crossover, filtering out mechanical noises generated by the woofer, something no electronic crossover can do. For very low frequencies, such an acoustic crossover can be far less expensive and more easily designed than an equivalent electronic crossover. They are called \"Bandpass\" because the combination of the rear enclosure and the driver form the high pass portion while the front enclosure forms the low pass section. Making the bandwidth of the system narrower raises the efficiency of the system.\n\nMulti-chamber Enclosure\n\nA variation of Bandpass and vented systems, the coupled cavity enclosure is the result of attempts by designers to solve specific problems. These enclosures consist of two or more rear enclosures, each coupled to the next by a vent. Each enclosure\/vent combination is another resonant system, and the combination is, essentially, a high order, multi-tuned resonant system. Generally, these systems have quite complex response and are difficult to design. No comprehensive theory on their operation exists like that for sealed, vented and Bandpass systems.\n\n\nMany builders and users like to take advantage of the power advantages of operating the amplifier in bridged or mono mode. To do so however, means that the impedance requirement of the drivers be taken into account when designing a proper circuit. For this purpose, we have provided an impedance calculator\n\nWhat is the best material to make speaker boxes? An ideal speaker cabinet material would be very stiff, so that it would tend to be stable with variations in box air pressure. It would also be very well damped, so that if it ever does deflect from air pressure, it will come back to the original position without resonating.\nIn addition, it would have a very high resonant frequency (supersonic), so that low frequency box air pressure would not cause it to resonate. An attractive material is preferred, and additional credit is given for a material that is easy to cut, glue, and finish. A great material would be cheap, too. Finally, it would be nice if the material were light, because we all have to move our speakers sometimes, and it's hard to appreciate good speakers with a sore back.\n\nWith all of those attributes, it would seem that no material is perfect. However, there are many materials that have enough of the above good attributes to make excellent speaker cabinets. Each, however, has advantages and disadvantages. In the list of good speaker box materials below, the following code letters are used to indicate which attributes the material possesses:\n\nS = Stiff - D = Damped - H = High Resonance\nA = Attractive - M = Malleable\nC = Cheap - L = Light\n\nCode: SDMC\n\nThis is the most practical material for quality speaker enclosures. It's extremely rigid and resistant to sympathetic vibrations in thicknesses over half an inch. It cuts very nicely and has a smooth surface. It takes veneer very well. However, bring a helper when you pick the stuff up; one sheet is very heavy. MDF is harder on tools than common wood, but easier than particle board. This is the material that many great speaker makers use. Approximately $45 for a 4'x8'x1\" sheet. Density: 50-lbs.\/Cu. ft.\n\nCode: DMA\n\nA clear or solid-color polycarbonate box can look strikingly good. However, this is not a cheap material. To locate it, look in the classified directory under PLASTICS. Approximately $400 for a 4'x8'x0.5\" sheet. Density: 75-lbs.\/Cu. ft. Acrylic (Plexiglas) is cheaper than Polycarbonate, but weaker and not as well damped (not recommended as a main construction material, but used for \"windows\" in Bandpass enclosures).\n\n\n(Not a good choice for Car stereo because of weight issues)\nIf you have time on your hands and want a great impractical box, try this. Make a simple box out of common plywood. Then glue cleats on the outside of the box to space the outside plywood from the common plywood. Glue hardwood-veneered plywood to the cleats and pour sand or lead shot into the spaces between the cleats. It won't be light, but with the filler, it will be extremely well damped. In addition, if you use strong cleats and glue well, the box will be extremely stiff. One designer was known to use different size Sonotubes as an alternative to plywood, and filled the space between them with sand. Be sure to sterilize the sand in your oven before putting it in the box.\n\nC... (truncated)",

        "text":"How to Build a Computer - Group 5 IT 3rd\n\n\n\n\nThis instructable will show you how to build a computer from scratch. Building your own computer is important because the components you need will vary depending on what type of computer you are making and selecting the components yourself can save money. For instance, if you want a computer for gaming, you will want powerful components that can handle the stress that you will put on it. Another type of computer you could make is a business computer, which requires a powerful processor, high end video card, and good RAM. It is a handy skill to be able to build your own computer because if you know what each component does, you can replace the component rather than replace the entire computer, which will save you time and money. This guide will work for most if not all computer builds.\n\nThe list of components\/parts needed are as followed:\n\n1. Case\n\n2. Power supply\n\n3. CPU and its heatsink\n\n4. Motherboard\n\n5. RAM\n\n6. Graphics Card\n\n7. Hard Drive\/Optical Drive\n\nTeacher Notes\n\nTeachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom?\nAdd a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.\n\nStep 1: Gather and Set Out All Components\n\nGather all the components of the computer you are going to build and set them out. Make sure nothing is visibly damaged and you have everything you need.\n\nStep 2: Place the Processor in the Motherboard\n\nTo place the processor in the motherboard, lift the arm that is on the big square with a lot of holes in the middle of the motherboard. If there are triangles on the processor and the socket for the processor, line those up and it should fit right in. If there are no triangles like there are in the pictures, look at the pins of the processor and line up the spots with no pins on the processor with the spots with no pins on the socket. Once the processor is in the socket, lower the arm to secure the processor.\n\nStep 3: Place the Heatsink on the Processor\n\nBefore you place the heatsink (or fan) on the processor, you need to check to see if any thermal paste is needed. If the processor or heatsink looks used like in the pictures above, place a small amount of thermal paste on the processor. Once the paste is on the processor, you can place your heatsink.\n\nTo place the heatsink, line up the latches with the small arms on the edges of the processor socket. Latch the heatsink to the arms and pull the latch to secure the heatsink.\n\nPlug in the heatsink to the pins that are labeled CPU_FAN. If it is not plugging in do not force it, it may not be positioned right. If it is positioned right it should plug in without requiring a lot of force.\n\nStep 4: Insert the RAM\n\nTo add the RAM, locate the DIMM slots on the motherboard (they are the long strips and are usually in groups). The slots for the RAM are split up into two different sized parts. The shorter end and the longer end of the slot should line up with the shorter and longer parts of the RAM connecters.\n\nUnlatch the two ends of the slot so the RAM can be placed. Line up the RAM with the slot and push down. This may take a little force to get it to go into the slot, so don't be nervous to push down a little harder if it is not going in (unless it's the wrong slot then I would suggest not pushing any harder to avoid damaging something).\n\nStep 5: Insert the Video Card\n\nThe slot for the video card should have a really short end and a long end. Line up the short part of the video card with the short part of the slot or have it so the ports on the video card are on the same side as the ports on the motherboard. This should not take as much force to put in the slot as the RAM. It is not a problem if the video card seems like it is not very secure, since it will be screwed into the case later.\n\nStep 6: Add the Speaker\n\nThere is a place to plug the speaker in the motherboard that should be labeled. Put the speaker there.\n\nStep 7: Hook Up the Power Supply\n\nSince we have to test what we have done so far to make sure it works, the power supply needs to be hooked up to the motherboard. There should be a 24 and a 4 pin connector coming from the power supply. Hook those up to the motherboard in the correct locations.\n\nStep 8: Hook Up the Motherboard to the Monitor and the Power Supply to a Power Source\n\nConnect a monitor to the video card using a VGA cable. Then connect your power supply to a power source and turn it on.\n\nStep 9: Testing the Motherboard and Components\n\nOnce the power supply is powered and on, what we have done so far can be tested. There is a set of pins on the motherboard labeled \"Power\" or something similar. Touch those two pins at the same time with a screwdriver large enough to touch both at once and see if it powers on. It may take a few tries but it should work if done correctly. If everything works the speaker should beep once and video be displayed on the monitor. Once you confirm everything is working disconnect the power supply form the motherboard.\n\nIf there is an error, listen for beeps because it can indicate the problem. Common beep codes are shown in a picture above.\n\nStep 10: Opening the Case\n\nTo open the computer case unscrew the sides and take them off. In the case of the case shown, the screws were on the back of the case.\n\nStep 11: Placing the Motherboard in the Case\n\nTo install the motherboard into the case, you first need to put in stand off screws. These screws are there to prevent the components from breaking since the motherboard would be touching the metal case while being powered. On the case above, there were already stand off screws in the case. To know where to put the stand off screws, look on the case to see if there is a legend (like the case above) that tells you where to put the screws based off of the type of motherboard you have. The motherboard used in this build is a Micro ATX, so the screw holes labeled with an \"M\" are the ones that could be used depending on the shape of the motherboard. Not all the holes were needed for the motherboard in this demonstration.\n\nOnce all the stand off screws are in place, the motherboard can be put in. Put the motherboard in the case so the ports are sticking out of the case (there should be holes for the ports to go into). After that the motherboard can be screwed into the stand off screws with normal screws. The video card also needs to be screwed onto the case to keep it stable.\n\nStep 12: Installing the Power Supply\n\nThere should be a spot for the power supply to go. Place it there and screw it onto the case to secure it. Once you do that, connect it to the motherboard like you did when you tested the motherboard.\n\nStep 13: Plugging in the Motherboard to the Case\n\nThere are cables in the case that need to be connected to the motherboard. They are labeled like the motherboard so use those as a guide to plugging in everything.\n\nStep 14: Adding the Hard Drive\n\nLocate the hard drive slot for your hard drive. In the case above, the holes needed to line up so it could be secured. Once the hard drive is secured, you can hook it up to the motherboard using a SATA cable.\n\nStep 15: Put the Case Back Together\n\nPut the case back together once everything inside is installed and secure.\n\nStep 16: Plug It In\n\nPlace the computer in the desired location and then hook up the power cord and VGA cable in the same ports that you used to test the motherboard and components earlier.\n\nStep 17: Test\n\nTest the computer to see if it works, if there are problems look back at what you have done that may have been wrong and make sure everything is plugged in.\n\n\n\n    \u2022 Indoor Lighting Contest\n\n      Indoor Lighting Contest\n    \u2022 Make It Fly Challenge\n\n      Make It Fly Challenge\n    \u2022 Growing Beyond Earth Maker Contest\n\n      Growing Beyond Earth Maker Contest\n\n    5 Discussions\n\n    Teenage Kicks\n\n    3 years ago\n\n    Whilst this is a very simplistic guide, and building a computer is simple, you really should mention risks of static shocks, always make sure you ground yourself before touching any component as you could kill it very easily if you shock the component.\n\n    also, always use thermal paste, better safe than buggered\n\n    3 replies\n    OmnitusTeenage Kicks\n\n    Reply 3 years ago\n\n    So, I am getting ready to build a computer sometime soon for the first time. What would you recommend is the best way to keep grounded? I can't afford wasting a part like that.\n\n    ryanwootenTeenage Kicks\n\n    Reply 3 years ago\n\n    Thank you for the constructive comment. It is important to take precautions while building a computer and I could have mentioned it in the guide.

        "text":"Fuse Electrical Parameters Explanation\n\nFuse is a very simple electrical part and yet needs to be properly selected. Its role in the circuit is very important actually.\u00a0Selecting a right fuse starts with a good understanding on fuse electrical parameters.\u00a0There are some important fuse electrical parameters to consider. These are the Current Rating, Ampere Square Seconds, Breaking Capacity and Voltage Rating.\n\nFuse Electrical Parameters\u00a0Explanation\n\n1. Nominal Current Rating\n\nWe will start with the current rating. This is an obvious specification of a fuse. This is defined as the rated current carrying capacity of a fuse which is normally measured at nominal operating conditions and ambient temperature of mostly 25\u00baC. This rating will change with higher temperature so be careful to avoid issues on your design. This rating must not be fully utilized in the circuit. A good rule of thumb is to set the circuit typical current to 75% of this rating only. Mathematically,\n\nFuse Electrical Parameters\n\nExample 1\n\nA particular circuit has a nominal current of 10A.\u00a0Determine the typical current rating of the fuse to be used.\n\n\nFuse electrical parameters\n\nIn the above rule of thumb, it is obvious that the current that will flow to the circuit devices is higher than the nominal current in the event of abnormality. Be sure that the circuit components are able to withstand the excess current before the fuse act its role. In other words, you need to ensure that the components in series with the fuse have a current rating higher than the melting point of the fuse. So, every time there is sudden increase in current, only the fuse will blow.\n\n2. I2t Rating (Melting point)\n\nThe second fuse electrical parameter to talk with is the I2t rating. Circuits involving large capacitance will have likely a very high current during start up (the time the capacitor is charging). This is called inrush current in other terminology. The current rating discussed above is only valid for steady state condition and cannot cover this phenomenon. Thus I2t is introduced by manufacturers. In some people or books\/writeups, this is called as the melting current. In short, this fuse rating is designed for transient conditions. To avoid abnormal tripping of the fuse every time there is high inrush current, the I2t of the fuse must be higher than the I2t of the circuit. Mathematically,\n\nfuse electrical parameters\n\nExample 2\n\nIf a particular fuse has an I2t of 100A2seconds, what should be the maximum allowable inrush current of the circuit if the permitted transient period is 1 second?\n\n\nFuse electrical parameters\n\n3. Voltage Rating\n\nThe third fuse electrical parameter to consider is the voltage rating. This rating is often underestimated and misunderstood by many\u00a0circuit designers. Their argument is that fuse is connected in series to the circuit and has a very small resistance so why voltage rating is relevant?\u2026In the event of a fuse melting or simply when a fuse open up, when the open circuit voltage is higher than the voltage capability of the fuse, explosion may occur and might trigger fire. This rating is more on safety reason not only for the circuit right functionality. Say if an open circuit voltage (when fuse blows) is 120V, therefore the rating of the fuse should be greater than this value. Mathematically,\n\nfuse electrical parameters\n\n4. Temperature Variation\n\nThe last fuse electrical parameter to tackle with is the temperature variation. In electronics circuit design, temperature is one of the big enemies to withstand. The current carrying capacity of a fuse will be greatly affected by the variation of the operating temperature. When the operating temperature is high, the current capability will decrease and the fuse will open earlier as it is designed at nominal conditions. All fuse manufacturers provided a graph in their datasheets which contains the current versus operating temperature. If there is no data like this in the fuse you are using, request one from the manufacturer. To site an example, see below.\n\nFuse Current Capacity Versus Temperature\n\nAbove illustration is taken from the datasheet of a certain fuse. As you notice, at 25\u00baC ambient temperature the current carrying capacity of a three types of fuse is in the fullest, at 100%. However beyond this temperature you can observe that the current carrying capacity starts to decrease. For example, a slow blow fuse current carrying capacity will decrease to approximately 82% at 65\u00baC operating ambient temperature.\n\nTo summarize, the purpose of the fuse is to protect the circuit in the event of high current. However, the fuse should not also over reactive with the short duration currents that it will open in unspecified condition. By considering all these fuse electrical parameters you can be sure that the fuse will operate as expected.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"How to connect laptop to TV without HDMI\n\nRCA and S-video\n\nThese types of connections are common and are equated to the same group, largely due to the fact that they are rarely used. At the same time, such interfaces are a relic of the past, however, if you have old technology, then they may well work today.\n\nNotebooks with rca and s-video output recently went out of circulation, and today they are practically not used. Therefore, connecting a laptop in this way is a last resort when other measures and capabilities are simply not available. In order to connect your TV to a laptop using such interfaces, you must use the convectors and adapters specially provided for this.\n\nThe main advantage is the fact that the method of such a connection can revive even old equipment and broadcast information from a laptop on it.\n\nThe disadvantage is the quality of the transmitted image, as well as the almost complete absence of laptops with a similar interface.\n\nSuch wires are known to us under the name \u201ctulips\u201d, once, at the beginning of the 2000s, special game consoles were connected to TVs in this way, as well as video players that reproduce images from cassettes.\n\nHowever, if you do not know how to transfer a movie from a laptop to a TV, which, by the way, is more than 10 years old, then this adapter will certainly come in handy for you. As a rule, tulips are painted in special colors that need to be inserted into connectors painted in the same shades.\n\nHowever, be prepared for the fact that this method does not promise you a high quality image transmission, therefore, you cannot count on a good resolution. This method is only necessary in desperate situations when you no longer have to choose.\n\nMost often, this opportunity is realized thanks to the Micro Card Video system. At the same time, the laptop must run on the latest generation intel platform. Unfortunately, no other platforms are currently supported.\n\nAlso, it remains possible to connect two devices via bluetooth, but only on condition that the devices are equipped with such technology. You can familiarize yourself with this function in detail in the instructions for the devices.\n\nFeatures of connecting a laptop to TV\n\nWhy is it necessary to connect a laptop to a TV? There are many reasons for this.\n\n  \u2022 Now you can display images and video files on the big screen.\n  \u2022 It is necessary to connect a laptop to a TV to organize a presentation.\n  \u2022 For communication via Skype, as well as other video communication services.\n  \u2022 Most often, a TV is required in order to play video from a laptop on a large screen and with a good resolution. This makes watching movies a real pleasure.\n\nBut how do you sync your laptop with a large screen? Is it possible to just buy a TV equipped with Smart TV right away? Or purchase a special Android set-top box that will broadcast the materials you need?\n\nIn fact, all these methods are fundamental, and if you need to connect two devices here and now, there are only a few ways. Despite the complexity of the technological process, it is quite simple to make the connection, however, it is necessary to assess in advance which interfaces and functionality of the devices are available to you.\n\nconnect, laptop, hdmi\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of the digital interface is its absolute versatility. Fortunately, the SCART connector is found on older TVs and laptops as well as brand new formats. The output will provide not only high-quality image transmission, but also sound. However, in order to use this type of connection, you will need a special adapter cable, since laptops will not be equipped with such a connector.\n\n  \u2022 These include versatility.\n  \u2022 At the same time, the audio cord will be included in the basic package.\n\nAll ways to connect a laptop to a TV\n\nWe are witnesses of how computer technology is developing rapidly and purposefully. There are more and more new devices that make it easier for us to obtain information, as well as improve the quality of its presentation and processing.\n\nIf we look at a modern laptop, we will be surprised how many functions this device combines. In addition, it has a sufficient number of connectors, which means it can easily integrate with other devices. How to connect laptop to TV? This question is asked by many people who want to display media files from a laptop to a TV. In this article we will try to answer this question.\n\nDVI adapter\n\nThis cable is also not much different from HDMI. The DVI interface is a modern digital connector that also provides good audio and video quality. However, there are problems with this method. Unfortunately, not every TV, and also not every laptop has a corresponding connector. Therefore, it is likely that you will have to purchase a special adapter adapter.\n\nThe advantage of this method is the simplest possible connection.\n\nAbility to view images in Full HD quality.\n\nThe disadvantage is a connector that is rarely found on laptops.\n\nWhen a laptop is connected, the user can watch video content, the resolution of which will be Full HD 1920 x 1080 pixels.\n\nIn this case, the specifics of the connection will not change depending on the manufacturer of the equipment.
