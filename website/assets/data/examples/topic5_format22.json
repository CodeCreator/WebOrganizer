        "text":"How to unlock Huawei nova 5 free\n\nOk, so let me see now, you want to unlock your Huawei nova 5 device at no costs! That\u2019s right, you can do that, and we\u2019re here to help you.\n\nIn the article below I am going to reveal by far the most ideal strategy to get your device unlocked at no additional cost via an IMEI number. You will use our code-unlocking tool to achieve this, so far, so good, huh?\n\nYeah, I know how impossible it seems to get another SIM card set up if your initial carrier has locked the phone. When a Huawei nova 5 is purchased from Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, etc the phone is locked, preventing you from using it with a different carrier unless you request to have it unlocked. But guess what? Your request will be declined.\nCarriers usually do so, and of course, they did it cause they want to keep their customers sign up to them \u2013 it\u2019s quite logical! IT IS POSSIBLE to unlock a Huawei nova 5 for free, though!\n\nNO extra costs, as promised!\nHOWEVER, let me say it anyway: there are services that charge about $40 or more for a code to unlock your Huawei nova 5. We provide that for free, keep that in mind. Moreover, it is the simplest way to unlock your devise. Why? Because:\n  \u2022 Quick and effective unlocking tool to set your device;\n  \u2022 No need to install any app on your device;\n  \u2022 No cables to be plugged in, you can also use the computer;\n  \u2022 No specialized understanding needed;\n\nAnd remember!!! You can be in whatever country as long as you are on this planet and YOU CAN still get your device unlocked.\n\nI will go over the whole process of getting a Huawei nova 5 device unlocked, and tell you how to get the best value you can during a sale (since you\u2019ll get a cheaper price on a smartphone that is unlocked).\n\nONE MORE thing, be aware that unlocking a Huawei nova 5 sim card won\u2019t void your contract or warranty no changes will be made to the package you\u2019re currently paying your provider for, either \u2013 this process is completely legal. GOOD NEWS is that even if your mobile device has a balance owing, your phone can still be unlocked!\n\nBest Approach: Using IMEI to Have Your Huawei nova 5 Unlocked\n\nLet me put it this way: The IMEI approach is the easiest way to unlock your device, however there are other tactics that can be used via software and hardware, but it can ruin your phone. So let\u2019s just stick with this one. So, there we go, let\u2019s proceed now: 3 simple steps\n\n  \u2022 First step: enter your IMEI number.\nThe most optimal approach to locating your one-of-a-kind IMEI number is by dialing *#06#. Once you do, your phone\u2019s screen will display a 15-digit IMEI number. Enter that one and Submit!\n\n  \u2022 Second step: Select country and provider\nHowever, if you are unable to locate your network, or are unsure about which one to choose, simply contact us. It\u2019s our job to assist you.\n\n  \u2022 Third step: Get unlock code and instructions\nOur application will produce a one-of-a-kind unlocking code for the Huawei nova 5 device within minutes, accordingly to carrier details, country, and IMEI information submitted.\n\nOnce the button is clicked, you\u2019ll be redirected to the page of the smartphone unlocker. As soon as you are on it, you will see instructions to stick with so you are able to unlock your phone effectively.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"How to Replace Memory for Asus Eee PC 1000HE\n\nI helped a user with his Eee PC 1000HE and the first thing I did is to replace the memory. The 1000HE comes with 1GB of memory and it has only one slot. Therefore, you cannot just add memory to it, you have to replace the old one. The memory I added is a OCZ 2 GB PC2-5400 667 MHz DDR2 memory. Here are the steps to install it.\n\n  1. Turn off the computer and remove the battery.\n  2. Turn the computer bottom side up and place it on a soft surface.\n  3. Use a screw driver to remove the two screws.\n  4. Now it\u2019s the scary part. Gently remove the cover. The cover is secured by two tabs around the mid section. You need to apply a bit of force to get it open.\n  5. Before you touch any components inside the computer, touch any metal in your surrounding to discharge statics on you or put on an anti-static wrist strap. Gently pull out the clips from the side of the memory. The memory would pop up. Remove it.\n  6. Insert the new memory into the slot at an angle. Note that there is a notch on the memory, make sure the orientation is alright. If you have problems inserting the memory, the orientation is probably wrong.\n  7. Push down the memory so it locks in place.\n  8. Put back the cover and screws.\n\nYou have saved $50.00 by doing this yourself. \ud83d\ude42\n\n  \u2022 It\u2019s really easy, you do have to be careful unscrewing the back though. You don\u2019t want add too much pressure and poke something.\n\n    I upgraded to the CORSAIR 2GB but going right clicking properties on my computer still shows .99gb of ram.\n\n  \u2022 BB\n\n    Thank you for posting!\n    I was stalled at the scary forcibly-remove-the-door step. It saved me \u00a52000 and 30 minutes according to PC Depot. I had actually removed 2 additional screws thinking it was still locked down. Hope I haven\u2019t unhinged anything.\n    I am now planning to install the Ubuntu 9.04 Netbook Remix (UNR) after taking a peek in Windows XP NihonnGo-ban to see if the memory is recognized.\n\n  \u2022 BB\n\n\n  \u2022 sebastiaan\n\n    also, thank you for posting, it was quite helpfull. nice to have people like you around on the web.\n\n  \u2022 grin\n\n    I just installed 2gb of corsair ram and in my system it still shows .99gb of ram as well. any answers? please email me at akagrin at yahoo dot com thanks a bunch.\n\n  \u2022 grin\n\n    ok I just searched for cpuz, and it shows my correct ram of 2gb. very useful program as well, not just for ram. no install required. (.exe)\n\n  \u2022 Ben\n\n    I had the same issue others reported. I installed a 2gb corsair ram and the my computer properties still shows as .99 gm of ram. I havn\u2019t had this issue with any other computer I\u2019ve upgraded the ram in before. Any ideas why this is and what (if anything) should be done about it?\n\n  \u2022 Peter\n\n    If it still shows 1gb in System after you installed a 2gb ram , you need to restart, press F2 and then press F10.\n\n  \u2022 bodydetox\n\n    i love the Asus Eee PC, it is very light, cheap and portable. I also bought another unit for my girlfriend and she really likes it.\n\n  \u2022 Kim\n\n    Asus Eee is very convenient to carry. It is my walkaround laptop wherever i go. The battery life could have been better though\n\n  \u2022 Acnegal\n\n    Asus Eee is perfect for ladies who does not want to carry a very heavy laptop. i like the Asus Eee because it is very compact and easy to carry anywhere.\n\n  \u2022 Brad Fallon\n\n    I am planning to buy a high end graphics card( Nvidia 8400 GT 256 or 512 MB)\n    I need to change my motherboard so i can plug in my new graphics card(PCIE slot req.)And i need to buy DDr2 RAM.\n    Do i have to change my processor and what other essentials do i have to replace or change??Can i keep my hard drive as i have windows vista running on it and a lot of Data on it.\n\n    Please Help.

I assume we all know that Tecno H6 is of two versions or type, the old version with build number\u00a0H6-G325-20140923 \u00a0but has 2GB allocated free space for use and also the new version with build number\u00a0H6-G325-20150122S\u00a0 which comes with 5GB free space for use, yes you read me well, 5GB free storage for user use. Anyway, I can say I\u2019m so dissapointed at Tecno for not making the new H6 version with 5gb free space to be an OTA update or upgrade for the users of old version to just update or upgrade it using their device or flash via sp flashtools. Instead they decided to make a new H6 version with 5gb free space & selling it in the market, thereby leaving the users of old version with 2gb free space in darknes.\n\nAnyway, back to the main point of this post, to the users of old version of H6, I have come up with a reliable & trusted way to help you guys switch from the old version firmware to the new version firmware so as to enjoy 5gb free internal space for usage & other changes instead of 2gb.
