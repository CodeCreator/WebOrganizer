        "text":"LyricWiki:Page Names\n\nRedirected from LyricWiki:Page names\n\n1,754,751pages on\nthis wiki\n\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to have pagenames that are as uniform as possible. LyricWikia is a site that has songs, artists, and users from many different nations, which have rules for capitalization that may vary. (At times, the Artist may creatively change capitalization as well.) By breaking the capitalization rules of every nation, it is hoped that the creation of multiple variations of a page will be minimized. This way, the site won't have one group of editors working on one variation, while another group works on another and work can be more collaborative. Also, because LyricWikia is incorporated into other projects, a uniform method of creating pagenames is also necessary for coding purposes.\n\nExample Titles\n\n\nAll words, regardless of whether the artist capitalize that letter or the language's grammar says it should be lower case, must have their initial letter capitalized.\n  \u2022 ABBA, instead of Abba\nThe artist's name in this example is kept all in capitals, because that is the closest to the original's format as per the Swedish and English Wikipedias.\n  \u2022 K.d. Lang instead of k.d. lang or K.D. Lang\nIn this example, the K and L are capitalized for LyricWikia's purposes, but the remainder of the artist's name remains in its official format. So, if an album was named OdDly CaPiTaLIzeD, the name should be capitalized exactly as shown, not changed to Oddly Capitalized.\nIf an album lists a song as being in all capitals, it is often the case that it shouldn't be placed under a page name with all capitals, although exceptions are likely to exist. This is very common with Japanese artists (such as Abingdon Boys School) who will use all capitals for those songs with English titles, such as with the example. The page name should follow the normal initial letter capitalization, followed by the capitalization that the word would normally have. (So MCDONALDS should be McDonalds, for example.) The display portion of the link, however, can follow the capitalization used on the album. (Example: # '''[[Abingdon Boys School:Strength.|STRENGTH.]]''' would display as STRENGTH., although it links to the correct page name.)\nE and A in the above example are still initial letters of their respective words, even though those words now form part of contractions and are not preceded by whitespace.\n\nNames Beginning With An Article\n\nArticles such that would normally follow a name in an index (A, An, and The) should remain at the beginning of the artist's name.\n\nPunctuation And Symbols\n\nIn this example, the quotation marks are used because this is the punctuation that the artist officially uses (following the official artist website).\nWords should not be substituted with their equivalent symbols if the word is an official part of the name (& for And, @ for At, etc.).\nSymbols should also not be substituted with their word-equivalent if the symbol is an official part of the name. (A few exceptions exist, see Technical Restrictions below for more information.)\nStylized artist names should be kept where possible.\nKeep apostrophes in contractions such as, ain't, don't, can't, won't, etc. (unless the official spelling of the artist\/album\/song omits them as well).\n\nNon-Latin Character Sets\n\nFor Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and other languages written in non-latin based scripts, artist names should have the romanized version of the name added in parenthesis (with given name first and family name last), with a single space between the native name and the opening parenthesis.\nThe album and song parts of page names should use only the title written in the native script, with no romanized version of the title added. The romanized version and the translation of the title can be provided by adding the {{TransTitle}} template to the top of the page.\n\nStage Name Vs. Real Name\n\nArtist names should be the popular ones, those the artists refer to themselves on album covers or the official websites.\n\nCommon Misspellings\/Incorrect Tagging\n\n  \u2022 When you think that an artist or band will be searched for under a technically incorrect name, (ELO or E.L.O. instead of Electric Light Orchestra, for example) you may create a redirect to point to the correct name. A redirect is created by adding #REDIRECT [[Correct Artist Name]] to a blank page.\n  \u2022 When you find an artist page to be under an incorrect name, you may move it by using the Move tab at the top of the page.\n    \u2022 If the artist page contains subpages (such as album and\/or song pages) please do not move it yourself: this would be a lot of work since all subpages would have to be moved manually and would likely break a lot of links. Instead, add {{move|to=Correct page name|reason=Reason for moving}} to the page source by using the Edit tab at the top.\n  \u2022 These same conventions hold for Album and Song names.\n\nArtist Pages\n\nOn occasion, there will be more than one artist with the same name. Whichever artist has the most of LW-relevant releases listed on Kingnee - Musicbrainz MusicBrainz should keep the primary location, with no parenthetical add-on used. If you are not sure about this, please contact an administrator.\n\nFor all other artists add a distinguishing notation to the page title in parentheses. Use the following:\n  \u2022 The 2-letter country ISO codes Wikipedia16, e.g. (AR) for Argentina, (SE) for Sweden. For the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland always use (UK).\n  \u2022 For multiple artists from the same country add the code for the principal subdivision (state or province) with a hyphen, e.g. (US-CA) for California. The same goes for all countries, respectively.\n  \u2022 Use the primary genre for artists from the same country and state, e.g. (US-CA Rap) or (US-CA Metal) \u2013 as brief as possible.\n\nNOTE: This only applies to the artist page, not the artist's albums and songs, which should keep the unchanged artist name as prefix. For details see the homonymous artists help page.\n\nA {{WrongPage}} template should be placed at the top of all similarly-named Artist pages with a link to the disambiguation page.\n\nAlbum Pages\n\nAlbum pages should be named as follows: Artist:Album (release). For example: Green Day:American Idiot (2004). Notice that a space should be placed in between the album's title and the release year inside the parentheses.\n\nAdding the release year should always be done, but is especially important when the album contains a song by the same name, for example: The Corrs:Forgiven, Not Forgotten (1996) (album page) vs. The Corrs:Forgiven Not Forgotten (song page). If the release year is unknown, four question marks should be substituted for the year: (????).\n\nOn a rare occasion, an additional parenthetical notation such as (EP) or (Demo) may be necessary to differentiate between two albums. For this to be necessary, the two albums must have the same name and have been released in the same year. This is mostly due to an identically-titled demo album or EP being released in the same year as a full-sized album release. An add-on should not be used, however, for releases from different countries. Any album differences due to various regional releases, deluxe editions, or limited editions are best noted on the regular album page.\n\nSong Pages\n\nSong pages should be named in the same way: Artist:Song.\n\n  \u2022 Added song notations (such as featured artists, live performances, bonus tracks, hidden tracks, etc.) that are not part of the song's title should be left off of the song's name whenever possible, and added parenthetically after the link.\nEXAMPLE: Fergie:Fergalicious (featuring instead of Fergie:Fergalicious (Featuring\n  \u2022 A song may use an added notation to distinguish a version that has different lyrics from the original.\nEXAMPLE: Fergie:Fergalicious (Radio Edit) and the original Fergie:Fergalicious\n\nTechnical Restrictions\n\nIf a page name would contain a character that is impossible to use due to technical restrictions (for example, a # symbol) replace it by a suitable equivalent (whatever the symbol represents when the item would be said aloud) and use the {{WrongTitle}} template (or a more specific wrong-title template).\n\nFull List of Restrictions\n\n  1. # should be \"Number \" (notice the space at the end) or \" Sharp\" (however, in the case with albums or songs that start with a Twitter hashtag, the number part should be removed completely since it doesn't refer to a number in this case)\n  2. < should be \"Less Than\"\n  3. > should be \"Greater Than\"\n  4. [ and ] (square brackets) should be ( and )\n  5. { and } (curly brackets) should be ( and )\n  6. \u00bb and \u00ab (double guillemets) should both be \"\n  7. | (pipe) and \u00a6 (broken pipe) should both be \/\n  8. (pilcrow) should be P\n  9. \\n (the actual sequence backslash-n, not the newline character) should be \/n\n  10. : and \/ are only problematic as first character of the page name and should be omitted only in those cases\n\nAround Wikia's network\n\nRandom Wiki",
