She's looking for her cellphone everywhere! WHILE SHE'S TALKING ON IT!' My dad and I imitated the old lady on TV, using our hands as phones, taking the cushions off the sofa, and looking underneath the TV set. Every few seconds, we would ask each other, 'Where could that cellphone have gone? It's not like it has feet.' After our little show ended, we turned to the front of the TV and continued to watch funny video clips while my mom persuaded my sister, Eunbi, to solve yet another problem set in her practice booklet. She had her science test the next day. With merely a sigh, Eunbi opened her booklet and began to answer some questions. As a soon to be first grader, I thought, 'Well, that is her duty. She should be studying right now.'\n\n'Trrrr....' The last bell of December rang at exactly two thirty. Everyone yelled out 'Winter Break!!' Echoes of closing binders and desk drums filled the room. In less than a minute, everyone emptied the classrooms that had encaged them daily for an hour and five minutes. I, on the other hand, moved slowly, with no hurry. For once, I did not have to run home, turn on the computer, and write an extensive lab report, a ten page research paper, or finish odd problems in the math textbook.\n\nI walked down the second floor hallway and opened locker 402. Happy faces, shining star stickers, a bright pink strawberry yogurt stain, and Korean movie star pictures ripped from magazines welcomed me for one last time in the year 2007. One binder, one notebook at a time, I gathered my homework materials and waved goodbye to the sophomore hall.\n\nIn the high school office, hosting a Christmas tree decorated with hand-made paper stars and red and white canes, Eunbi waited for me to go home. Saying goodbye to the office staff, we walked toward the bus stop and headed to our home in the yellow striped 622 route.\n\nOnce we arrived, Eunbi and I went separate ways. As I entered my room to turn on the TV, Eunbi entered hers to study for her upcoming SAT. Watching her reach out for her bluebook and her word smart, I thought, 'She has to be studying for the SAT. She's taking it next month.'\n\nAs a younger sister, I have always believed that Eunbi had to be busier and work harder than I did. I believed that it was Eunbi's responsibility to study for her science test and SAT. Nevertheless, when I entered third and tenth grade, as Eunbi had two years ago, I still looked at Eunbi and focused on why she had to do this and that in fifth grade or as a senior. I have never remembered my responsibilities. I have taken the role of a bystander. Now that the reality of the frightening SAT and AP approaches me, I will have to break the character that I have molded myself into for so many years and begin to take the role of an independent worker.\n\nSimilar Articles\n\n\nThis article has 0 comments.",

        "text":"My teacher and I\n\nSurbhi Nigam works with kids in the pre-primary section in Bluebells School International. She loves to paint, read, and write short stories for children. She believes that life is god\u2019s gift to us and therefore we have to live it to its fullest.\n\nOur English teacher was absent that day and we had a free period. I was in class four. Everybody was happy that they were getting an unexpected free period. There was a lot of noise in the class when suddenly we saw someone standing at the door. Pin drop silence followed. Ms. Calender taught the higher classes. She was one of the nicest teachers in school and yet for some reason everyone was on their guard when she was around.\n\nThis was 25 years ago but I remember it like yesterday. She walked into class and asked us to take turns and read aloud from our reading books. I had always been a \u201cback bencher\u201d and was not very confident of my reading skills. My heart was racing.\n\nWhen it was my turn to read, everything around me started moving, my vision blurred. Butterflies were flying about in my stomach. It was with extreme difficulty that I finished reading my bit.\n\nThe next day three students from my class were called to see Ms. Calender. I was one of the three. Why was I being called? What did I do? Did I read so badly yesterday? My mind choking with these thoughts.\n\nIn the staff room, Ms. Calender gave each of us a paper to read. We made mistakes while reading and I the most. My pronunciation was not very refined. We were asked to take the paper home, practice reading and come prepared the next day.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep that night. I was afraid of the task that was awaiting me the next day and I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself in front of Ms. Calender. I stayed up all night practicing my reading. The next morning we read from the paper in front of Ms. Calender. Imagine my surprise and dread when she announced that I was chosen to participate in a competition, which was to be judged by an external jury. I had 15 days before the competition. I wanted to cry, run away, fall on my knees, and beg her to spare me. She saw the fear in my eyes and said, \u201cI know you can do it.\u201d\n\nI was speechless for no teacher had ever shown her trust and faith in me. My classmates and even some of my teachers were surprised that I had been chosen. I could hear my classmates giggling and talking behind me. Later in the day, Ms. Calender gave me the topic I was to speak on \u2013 patience.\n\nMs. Calender met me everyday, briefed me on the topic, asked me to think and make notes. She discouraged any ideas I may have had of copying. She corrected my mistakes and made me practice speaking using the correct words, grammar, and punctuation.\n\nEvery time I wanted to tell her that I couldn\u2019t do it, that I wasn\u2019t the right choice, that I didn\u2019t fit in, I remembered her trust in me. I wanted to run away but I couldn\u2019t.\n\nI spent a sleepless night before the competition. When D-day arrived, my heart was pounding and I felt that the whole world could hear it. My turn came and for a second the world around me started shaking. I wanted to run away. My mind was blank and I was speechless. And then I saw someone \u2013 someone who trusted me and believed in my potential. She nodded her head, gave me a thumps up and I heard the words, \u201cI know you can do it,\u201d in my mind.\n\nI took a deep breath and started. After three seconds, I was in full swing. I spoke with all the courage and enthusiasm that my teacher had instilled in me. I spoke for my teacher \u2013 Ms. Calender.\n\nThe results were announced and guess what? I got the second prize. It was a moment to celebrate but I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I received the prize with shaking hands and looked at my teacher. It was more her victory than mine. She found me before I could get lost. Thank you ma\u2019am.",

It was an extremely dark Friday night in early December, but the sky was clear and littered with small, sparkling stars. A gigantic silver full moon shone out from the south on to a deserted road. That was until a brand new, shiny, metallic silver soft-top Peugeot 206 zoomed out of the shadows with music blaring out from the radio. Two men inside were still in hysterics over a joke that was told over 15 minutes ago. The men, both in their twenties, mended televisions together in a small Welsh town 10 miles from Cardiff. The pair were on their way to a well-known pub in the large Welsh city. The silver soft-top came to a halt at a stop sign. The mammoth moon reflected brightly into the car's rear view mirrors and the engine hummed as the driver looked left and right at the junction. A long key scratch pierced the right-hand side of the car from the bonnet to the boot. The driver was David Franks. David was a 23-year-old from East London. He had a shaven head, but from the hair that was left behind, you could see it was brown. His skin was tanned and had a look about him that made you wonder if he was of mixed race. His dark brown eyebrows were very distinguished. His grey blue eyes almost disappeared when he laughed because his plump cheeks rose up to counterbalance the enormous cheeky grin in a typical sized jaw. His eyes searched for distant headlights as he pushed his foot down on the accelerator pedal. ...read more.\n\n\nThe pair burst into hysterics all over again. The orange glowing streetlights beamed down on the silvery Peugeot, which was still the only car on the road. In the near distance, a white figure was standing at the roadside. As the car got closer, the duo saw that the white figure was a beautiful pale young woman with thin, long, straight, blonde hair shivering by the edge of the road. David braked, then reversed the car up to stop alongside the girl. Neil wound his window down again and asked the girl if she wanted a lift. She had very, very pale, almost white skin. It looked as soft as white silk. Her eyes were small and were an extreme blue colour. It was almost as if the blue of the sky in countries like the Caribbean Islands, where the sky is bluer than you can imagine, was stolen and put in her eyes to shine out to everyone she met. She had a small stubby nose and very defined cheek-bones. Her lips were light pink tinged with a faint blue colour. Her bright white teeth were chattering. The peculiar girl was wearing a white, floaty, almost translucent long-sleeved top, and long, tight, white flared trousers that swathed her white, high-heeled open toe sandals. She had a small white bag over her left shoulder. She was wearing small silver flower-shaped earrings with tiny pink stones in the middle and a silver cross necklace. The small girl was extremely thin. Neil and David thought she was mad to be wearing what she was in early December, as the temperature outside was extremely cold. ...read more.\n\n\nWe asked if she wanted a lift. She gave us this;\" Neil handed the paper that Susan gave David just over 12 hours ago. Mrs. Marsh read through the paper and confirmed that that was Susan's handwriting. David carried on the account of what happened. \"Susan looked cold, so Neil,\" he pointed to his best mate standing next to him, \"gave her his jacket. It had his phone and his keys in the pockets.\" The two men still didn't believe that the girl, who had seemed so real, was actually dead. Mrs. Marsh decided to show them her daughter's grave. Neil helped her into the silver convertible and then went to sit in the back, behind the driver. He curled his large body into the small space. The elderly woman told David where to drive and where to stop. When they reached the small cemetery, David helped the woman out of the car and she took them over to a shady corner away from the other graves. A large headstone stuck out from the ground. As they neared, Neil, David, and Mrs. Marsh could see something on top of the headstone. They got even closer. Neil could see it was his jacket, neatly folded on top the ageing headstone. He checked the pockets to see if his phone, keys, cigarettes, and his lighter were still there. They were. There was also a small piece of paper folded up in the left-hand pocket. He opened it up. It said: \"THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE AND THE LENDING OF YOUR JACKET. SEE YOU IN THE AFTERLIFE! S.S.M\" On the headstone of Susan's grave you could just make out the words: Susan Marsh Aged 19, died of multiple injuries after an accident involving a car. 1986.
