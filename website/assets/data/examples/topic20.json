        "text":"Facebook has announced today in a blog post that the much-anticipated Messenger 4 update for mobile is rolling out today. The revamp focuses on simplifying the messaging experience by removing some of the clutter users have complained about in the past.\n\nMessenger 4 has simplified its navigation, revamping the entire bottom tab menu. It starts with one-to-one and group conversations, which are now combined into a single Chats tab. The company is also adding a new Camera button on the top right of this menu to let users easily share photos and videos to your friends and family.\u00a0You\u2019ll also have revamped People and Discover tabs which are self-explanatory.\n\nIn a recent Messenger study, 7 out of 10 (71%) people told us simplicity is the top priority for them in a messaging app.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all, Messenger 4 will also bring in new ways to personalize conversations with custom nicknames, emojis, and chat colors. This includes the ability to create a really incredible OLED dark mode with custom chat bubble colors. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to apply this app-wide, but just to the specific chat you\u2019re in. You can, however, manually theme every chat with the dark mode.\n\nWhile Messenger 4 is all about simpler and easier-to-use messaging, we\u2019re still keeping all of the features that help you connect with the people you care about. Whether you want to poll your friends on which movie to see, split the bill for last night\u2019s dinner, share your live location to find friends at a music festival, challenge them to your favorite games, or catch up in a group video chat, we aren\u2019t changing anything about what you\u2019ve always loved about Messenger.\n\nThe new update will be rolling out globally in the coming weeks. Learn more about the update here.\n\nMessenger is a free download from the App Store.\n\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

But this\nis not, as some people and media reports would have you believe, a new Internet\n\u2013 rather, it is a decades-old promise finally coming true.\n\nMore than a year ago I said that 2006 would be the year that\nblogging passes from novelty into utility, and it did \u2013 blogs are not only\nmainstream media themselves, but they are a staple of traditional media news\nsites. The same shift is now happening with social networks, albeit with a significant\n\nBlogs were something new, a powerful self-publishing tool\nthat opened the door to a \u201cread-write\u201d web. Moreover, blogs will always be a\npart of the web, not the web in its entirety.\n\nBut social networks \u2013\nor to be more exact, technologies that allow people to interact and share ideas\nand content instantaneously \u2013 are becoming the Web\n. Eventually, the\nInternet itself will be one, giant, global social network, created by and for\n\nThe First Wave \u2013\nGated Communities\n\nYou can\u2019t scratch the Internet today without finding the\nword \u201csocial.\u201d Instead of building static web sites, corporations are now\nbuilding their own \u201csocial networks.\u201d Cisco Systems, which owns a social\nnetwork development company, is purchasing Tribe.Net\u2019s technology so it can\nbuild networks for corporate customers.\n\nNike has a social network. So do Carnival Cruises and\nSheraton hotels. There are hundreds of social networks with more going online all\nthe time \u2013 and while acting as separate membership communities, almost all have\nthe same \u201csocial\u201d features like blogs, audio and video sharing, messaging and\nfriends lists.\n\nThese types of social networks \u2013 led by the likes of\npowerhouses MySpace and Facebook, Bebo and Gather \u2013 represent the first wave. They\ngive members freedom but within certain parameters and interfaces. They are not\nso much closed communities but \u201cgated\u201d ones, where members must act and express\nthemselves in certain ways or discuss defined topics. Think of it as being part\nof a homeowner\u2019s association that allows everyone to have a garage as long as\nit\u2019s painted one of five pre-approved colors (sounds strange, but I live in Orange County, Calif., where this really happens.)\n\nThe Second Wave \u2013 An\nInternet Built With Bridges\n\nBut if Internet users hate anything, they hate constraint. A\nsecond wave of social networks promises to remove all constraint \u2013 in effect,\nto disband the homeowner\u2019s association and let people paint their garages\nwhatever color they want.\n\nThese networks \u2013 networks like Second Life and Ning, the\nlatest brainchild from Netscape founder Marc Andreessen \u2013 aim to turn the\nInternet into a tabula rasa where customization is king. According to a recent\nNew York Times article, Ning allows \u201canyone to set up a community on any\ntopic\u2026Ning users choose the features they want to include, like videos, photos,\ndiscussion forums or blogs. Their sites can appear like MySpace, YouTube or the\nphoto sharing site Flickr \u2013 or something singular.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, standards like OpenID hope to make identity\ntransferable from community to community. Just think \u2013 an Internet of true\nimagination, entire worlds that people build themselves. An Internet built not\nwith walls or gates, but with bridges.\n\nPeople Make It Social,\nNot Technology\n\nFor this to happen we need to do our part, too:\n\n  \u2022 We need to change our thinking of the Internet as something that includes social networks to something that is a social network.\n  \u2022 Technology allows media to be shared, but technology alone doesn\u2019t make blogs or RSS feeds or tagging \u201csocial.\u201d Only people can do that. In other words, a blog is \u201csharable\u201d media \u2013 media that is easily shared with others anywhere, that can be updated quickly and with which we can interact \u2013 but it\u2019s how people engage with the blog that determines whether it is also \u201csocial\" media.\n\nNevertheless, the next wave is here. Social networks and social\nmedia are disappearing into the fabric of the Web. The promise of Compuserve\nand \u201cWeb 1.0\u201d sites is here.\n\nAnd as for what comes next? Well, that responsibility now appears\nto lie with us.\n\nThis entry was posted in Popular Culture, PR & Marketing, Technology. Bookmark the permalink.\n\nOne Response to Redefining the Social Network and Social\u00a0Media\n\n  1. Interesting prediction, Gary.\n    I wonder if you could make a parallel to how civilization grew to how the WWW has evolved: clans\/tribes, then villages, towns, cities, connected regions, countries, etc. All growing and interacting via bridges (or, rather roads and modes of transportation). But, as you describe, the modes will be digital.\n    It\u2019s almost human nature to *want* to come together in larger communities (that sense of belonging).\n    A blog from the U of Maryland had a fascinating post that sort of echoes your comments. It focuses on testimony from Tim Berners-Lee before a U.S. House subcommittee. In part, he states:\n    \u201cThe good news is that a number of technical innovations\u2026along with more openness in information sharing practices are moving the World Wide Web toward what we call the Semantic Web\u2026.The Semantic Web will enable better data integration by allowing everyone who puts individual items of data on the Web to link them with other pieces of data using standard formats.\u201d\n    You can find that post here:\n    \u2014 Mike\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

All \"domains\" given out by \"\" were in fact sub domains to the domain - and this is where the problem started.\n\nAll blogs and websites, published to a \"\" subdomain, were aggregated by the search engines as the \"\" domain. As the number of registered scammy and spammy websites increased, their search engine reputation dropped. Non spammy blogs and websites either went out of business, or were transferred to legally registered domains, because of the low reputation and lower search engine originated traffic.\n\nFinally, the owners of - supposedly \"JONG SUNG, KIM\" of \"GOYANG,GYEOUNGGI\" - realised that their run was over, and that they could no longer hide their scams and spams behind legitimate blogs and websites. Apparently, they have now shut their doors.\n\nThe old adage comes to mind.\nYou don't get something for nothing.\n\nIf you registered your custom domain using - and your blog is now offline - you're going to have to publish the blog back to BlogSpot, to get it online again. If you want to use a domain URL, you have to repeat the custom domain setup process - starting with a new, properly paid for, domain URL.\n(Update 2015\/02): We now have more of the same, from \"\".\n\nDude, hit me with a comment!\n\nJan said...\n\nHey I don't think they actually shut it down. It was too profitable a business, little overheard. I read that their domain was closed down by the feds over all the abuse of the domains for phishing and scams.\n\nThey lost the domains all together!",

        "text":"Edit Article\n\nHow to Use 7Zip to Create Multiple Compressed Folders in One Go\n\nCommunity Q&A\n\nThis article will show you how to use the free software 7zip to create multiple compressed folders in one go. This may come in handy for times when you are backing up your computer files or for whenever you need to compress a lot of file folders in general. This method involves using 7zip in a Windows batch file.\n\nFor this tutorial, let's say that you have a some folders from your music collection that you want to compress so you can back them up on an external hard drive. These folders are contained inside a 'larger' folder named 'My Music.'\n\n\n  1. 1\n    Install 7zip. If you let it install in its default setting it should typically be in \"C:\\Program Files\\7-zip\\7z.exe.\"\n  2. 2\n    Fire up Notepad. You won't need to use 7zip's graphical user interface, so no need to run it after installing.\n  3. 3\n    In Notepad, insert this single line of code: for \/d\u00a0%%X in (*) do \"c:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7z.exe\" a \"%%X.7z\" \"%%X\\\"\n  4. 4\n    Note: If you'd like to output to .ZIP files, change the \"%%X.7z\" to \"%%X.zip\"\n  5. 5\n  6. 6\n    Browse to the location of the folders you want to compress. In our example it is in C:\\My Music.\n  7. 7\n    Create your very own batch file by setting 'Save as type' to 'All files' and naming it something like 'foldertomultiple7z.bat'. Take note of the file extension, which is .bat. Be sure not to set the file type as 'Text Documents' too.\n  8. 8\n    Click Save.\n  9. 9\n    Close Notepad and navigate to your 'My Music' folder. Notice that the batch file is at the same directory level as the folders that need to be compressed.\n  10. 10\n    Run the batch file by double-clicking on your bat file within your 'My Music' folder. DO NOT run as Administrator (option appears in right-click menu) - running as Administrator will compress the files in windows\/system32. After you double-click on the bat file, the windows command prompt appears and 7zip begins to do its thing.\n\n  11. 11\n    Verify the validity of your compressed folders. To do this, highlight them all and click the right mouse button. If you installed 7zip in its default setting, you'll have its menu incorporated in the Windows shell. Navigate to it and click 'Test Archive.'\n\nCommunity Q&A\n\nUnanswered Questions\nShow more unanswered questions\nAsk a Question\n200 characters left\n    If this question (or a similar one) is answered twice in this section, please click here to let us know.\n\n\n    \u2022 Changing the code in Notepad so that the resulting file extension is .cbz (instead of .zip) will enable this to work well for people using this batch file to show up in comic book readers.\n    \u2022 Keep your batch file for future use. The next time you need to compress multiple folders just Copy\/Paste it to the main directory where the said folders reside and run it.\n    \u2022 DO NOT run as administrator. This will compress the files in windows\/system32. Just double-click from within target folder will do the job.\n    \u2022 If 7-zip is installed somewhere else in your system, find its location and replace it in the code.\n    \u2022 You can use the batch file to compress any folder, not just music folders.\n    \u2022 You can name the .bat file to friendly name like 7z-all.bat and put it inside Windows folder, so it will be accessible for the whole system. After that to use, In Windows 7 and 8.x, click with the right mouse button in the blank space of a folder holding the Shift key, an option Open Command Window Here will appear. Clicking that will open a command line window for the current folder. Then just type the 7z-all (no need for the .bat extension) and it will start to compress all the folders inside that one.\n\n    Things You'll Need\n\n    \u2022 A computer with the Windows operating system.\n    \u2022 7zip, which you can download from here.\n    \u2022 A text editor for creating the batch file, Windows Notepad is enough.\n\n    Article Info\n\n    Categories: File Manipulation\n\n    In other languages:\n\n    Espa\u00f1ol:\u00a0usar 7Zip para crear m\u00faltiples carpetas comprimidas en un solo procedimiento,\u00a0Portugu\u00eas:\u00a0Usar o 7Zip para Criar M\u00faltiplas Pastas Comprimidas de Uma Vez,\u00a0Italiano:\u00a0Usare 7zip per Creare Pi\u00f9 Cartelle Compresse in una Sola Volta,\u00a0\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439:\u00a0\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c\u044e 7zip \u0441\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043a,\u00a0\u4e2d\u6587:\u00a0\u4f7f\u75287zip\u4e00\u6b21\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u538b\u7f29\u6587\u4ef6\u5939,\u00a0Fran\u00e7ais:\u00a0utiliser 7zip pour cr\u00e9er des dossiers multiples compress\u00e9s en une seule passe,\u00a0Deutsch:\u00a0Mehrere komprimierte Ordner mit 7Zip auf einmal erstellen,\u00a0Bahasa Indonesia:\u00a0Menggunakan 7Zip untuk Membuat Multipel Berkas yang Dipadatkan\n\n    Thanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 202,646 times.\n\n    Did this article help you?",

(That is, any user who has more than one set of permissions to a site is only counted once).\n\nProperties USER TOTALS\n\n\u00b7Total Users with Permissions includes: \u00a0\n\n\u00a7Web application Service Accounts\n\n\u00a7Users granted permissions through Web application policies\n\n\u00a7Site Collection Administrators\n\n\u00a7Users within Active Directory groups to which the ControlPoint Service Account has access (that is, within the same domain or forest, in a different domain\/forest for which with a two-way trust exists, or in a different domain\/forest with a one-way outgoing trust that ControlPoint can authenticate via the ControlPoint Manage Forest Access feature. \u00a0Disabled Active Directory accounts are included in this total. \u00a0If an Active Directory user has been renamed but still has permissions in SharePoint under the old name, each name will be counted as a separate user.\n\n\u00b7Excluded from this total are built-in groups and special accounts, such as nt authority\\authenticated users (or any account that begins with \"nt authority\") and sharepoint\\system, and users granted permissions via augmented Claims or alternate authentication providers.\n\nNOTE: \u00a0Total Users with Permissions uses data recorded in the ControlPoint Service Database (xcAdmin), and is current as of the last Discovery run.

display a subset of columns; display columns that are not included in the default view; add a calculated column; display column totals.\n\n\u00b7Example: \u00a0Site Collection Statistics with calculated columns to track size and storage utilization.\n\n\n\nSC Statistics CUSTOM\n\n\n\u00b7Example: \u00a0Farm Statistics filtered to show only \"high priority\" metrics.\n\n\nFarm Stats CUSTOM\n\nTo configure the Web Statistics KPI\/Status List (SharePoint 2007 and 2010):\n\nREMINDER: \u00a0To use KPI lists and Web Parts, you must have an Enterprise-based environment \u00a0with Enterprise Site Features activated on the ControlPoint Configuration root site. \u00a0This list type has been deprecated as of SharePoint 2013.\n\n1Create a new Status list (or KPI list \u00a0as it is known in SharePoint 2007) entitled \"Web Statistics KPI\" (or another name of your choosing).\n\n2Create indicators for the Web Statistics KPI List as follows:\n\na)In the ControlPoint Configuration root site, open the Web Statistics KPI List.\n\n\n\u00a7New > Indicator using data in SharePoint list (SharePoint 2007)\n\n\n\u00a7New > SharePoint List based Status Indicator (SharePoint 2010)\n\nDashboard KPI LIST\n\nc)Complete the appropriate fields on the New Item page (including the List URL of the list containing the statistic for which you want to create an indicator). \u00a0Consult your SharePoint documentation for complete instructions.\n\nDashboard KPI CREATE\n\nd)Complete substeps b and c for each indicator you want to create.\n\nOnce the list has been set up, add a KPI Web Part to the dashboard, specifying the Web Statistics KPI List as the Indicator List.\n\nDashboard KPI\n\n\nSetting Object Properties\n\nYou can use ControlPoint to set properties for site collections, sites, and lists.\n\nIn a multi-farm ...

For example, individual vulnerabilities can be exploited to remotely execute malicious code.\n\nTherefore, we recommend that you immediately install any and all Windows updates that are currently available. This applies to both servers and desktop PCs running Windows. Microsoft has already made various security updates available on the current Patch Tuesday.\n\nOn Windows desktop, the update installation is usually performed automatically.
