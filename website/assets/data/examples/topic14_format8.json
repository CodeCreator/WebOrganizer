        "text":"Rental Policies in Stockton, CA and the surrounding areas\n\n1. We are an equal opportunity housing provider. We fully comply with the Federal Fair Housing Act. We do not discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. We also comply with all state and local fair housing laws.\n2. Housing availability policy. Rental units become available when they are ready to rent. A vacant unit will not be deemed available until it has been cleaned, and prepared for a new resident. We update our list of available rental units as each unit becomes available. A rental unit that was unavailable in the morning may become available later that same day.\n3. Occupancy guidelines. To prevent overcrowding and undue stress on plumbing and other building systems, we restrict the number of people who may reside in a unit. In determining these restrictions, we adhere to all applicable fair housing laws. We allow two persons per bedroom per rental unit. For example, a two bedroom rental unit could house four people, and a three bedroom rental unit could house as many as six people.\n4. Application process. We evaluate every application in the following manner. You must submit a rental application and answer all questions on the form. All adults living in the rental unit must complete an application and meet qualification requirements. You must pay the $35 (for an individual), nonrefundable application fee. An additional $35 application fee will be charged for each co-tenant. We will determine whether, from your responses to the application questions, you qualify for the unit you are applying for. If you do not, we will reject your application. If you do, we will check your credit report, criminal history, and employment and rental references to confirm that they meet our rental criteria. If you meet our criteria, we will approve your application. This process takes 24 to 48 hours. We process only one application at a time for any of our rental units. If you are interested in renting a property that has an application pending on it, we can accept back-up applications. You will not be asked to pay an application fee if you submit a back-up application. If the first application is rejected, we will call the person(s) who submitted the first back-up and give them an opportunity to apply and at that time collect the fee.\n5. Rental criteria. To qualify for a unit at PME, you must meet the following criteria:\na. Income. Your combined monthly income should be at least two and a half times the monthly rent and must be verifiable. If you have been a full-time student at any time within the past year, we may require you to have your lease guaranteed. If you are unemployed, you must provide proof of a source of income.\nb. Rental history. You must have satisfactory rental references from at least two prior landlords or for at least the last two years. If you have ever been evicted or sued for any lease violation, we may reject your application.\nc. Credit history. Your credit record must currently be satisfactory. If your credit history shows any unpaid debts, we may reject your application.\nd. Guarantors. If you do not meet one or more of the above criteria, you may be able to qualify for the rental unit if you can get a third party to guarantee your lease. The guarantor must pass the same application and screening process that you must pass, except that we will deduct the guarantor's own housing costs before applying his or her income to our income standard. A guarantor must make a minimum of four times the rent to qualify. The fee for an individual guarantor (co-signor) is $35.00.\ne. Criminal history. If you have ever been convicted of a felony, we may reject your application. If you have been convicted of a misdemeanor involving dishonesty or violence within the past five years, we may reject your application.\n6. The first month of rent and the security deposit must be paid before tenant(s) can take possession of the unit.\n\nSend email to rental@pmerents.com",

        "text":"Tree Policy\n\nTree PolicyTree Policy\nWhen Garden Wood estate was built, the developers and the Residents Co planted many new trees to supplement the existing ones. These have now matured and the estate is well endowed with trees large and small. There are no plans to plant any more but requests from residents for new trees will be considered.\n\nThe company may decide to replace trees that have we have had to remove. Much will depend on the location and financial constraints. Generally we will not replace trees on very small plots. Some of the small plots that we maintain are actually owned by WSCC. These plots are normally between the road and the footpath. We will not replace any trees lost on these plots.\n\nThe company is committed to maintain existing trees and ensure that the estate remains a 'Garden Wood'. Many of the trees are now quite large and the maintenance costs are increasing. It would be possible to spend significant amounts of money on tree maintenance but the directors try to keep maintenance charges low so an annual budget is allocated for tree work. We have commissioned Madgewicks Tree Surgeons a long established company to carry out this work.\n\nThe company cuts back and prunes trees within its budgetary constraints but does not remove trees unless they are dead, there is a safety issue or they are causing significant problems. Occasionally residents request a tree to be removed. Such requests will be considered but are unlikely to be granted unless there is a clear safety issue.\n\nThe company has a duty of care so we occasionally have to remove trees for health and safety reasons. If the company has no option but to remove a tree then we do not generally consult or advise local residents. If there is an option then we will try to contact residents living close to the area of the tree.\n\nWe comply with the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. We do our best to avoid disturbing wild bords or their nests during the breeding season.\n\nWhere a resident requests\/insists that the company removes a tree because they believe it is causing or may cause damage to their property the company reserves the right to ask the resident to produce a report from a professional to confirm that this is the case. The cost of obtaining this report shall be borne by the resident.\n\nIt is recognized that removing a tree can aggravate structural damage through heave or root shrinkage. If the company does remove a tree at a resident\u2019s request then the company will not accept responsibility for any subsequent damage.\n\nPlease contact us if you have any questions about trees on our land.\n\nJune 2021",

Members are advised to search the Trade Mark Database on the IPAustralia website to dertmine the status of any rose before listing them for sale. NOTE: A trade mark and a PBR are separate titles and the non-existence of a PBR does not necessarily mean the non-existence of a trade mark and it is the sole responsibility of RT members to determine the status of each.\n\nC.

        "text":"Company Information\nThank you for taking the time for reviewing our online catalog. Our products are made by Amish folk, who prefer to live the simple life. Kilmer's was formed in 1999 and began to sell online in January 2000 (which makes us \"middle age\" in internet years). The Amish craftesmen are friends of ours, whom we have known for years. We at Kilmer's started as a hobby trying to sell a few swings for an Amish friend - the hobby got a bit out of hand.\n\nOur Amish crafted outdoor furniture\u00a0is made in\u00a0an Amish communities located outside of St. Ignatius in Western Montana. All our products are made in Amish owned, Amish run shops, and all the workmanship is done with an eye towards quality. A great deal of pride and workmanship truly goes in each piece that is produced. The woodworkers who produce our furniture & gazebos come from a long line of hard working, simple folk, who strive to produce quality affordable furniture. We stress the workmanship as Amish crafted, as this truely means quality. We do not sell any items that are not Amish crafted. Everything we sell is made in the USA.\n\nThe most frequently asked question is \"why are our prices affordable?\" Frankly, we buy the cedar directly from a local cedar mill, and our products comes directly from Amish workshops to you - our products aren't warehoused and shipped 2 or 3 times in the process. The prices are a not set to gouge our buyers, but at fair market value.\nEmail: It is always best to contact us by email at through the Amazon network. Our office hours are very limited , emailing is prefered\n\nDamaged Orders ?\u00a0Please email us through the Amazon network for the best response. Please include a brief description of what is wrong, so that we can promptly fix the problem or attach a photo. We do need to document for Amazon what is wrong or right, which is why we are stressing email notification. Amazon offers 24\/7 customer service through their help tab on the top of Amazon's front page.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards are made through the Amazon network. Payment can also be made by mail to the Kilmer Creek - please send only Money Orders or Checks. Checks need to be cleared (which can take 7-10 days) before any product will be shipped.\u00a0\n\nSALES TAX: Effective July 1, 2008 - Washington State Residents pay Sales Tax based on their delivery address. The maximum is currently 9.6 %. Under current federal law, internet sales are currently exempt from sales tax, unless the business has a physical presence in the state in which they must collect tax (we are based in Washington State).\u00a0\nOur office mailing address: Kilmer Creek LLC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a015021 Manor Way\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Lynnwood, WA 98087\nWe do not warehouse items at our office.\nAll products are shipped directly from Montana.\nGUARANTEE: We guarantee all of our workmanship and will replace any piece that is damaged during shipping. Our items are hand crafted, not mass produced. All our items are produced in the USA by Amish craftsmen.\n\nFURNITURE SHIPPING and INSURANCE: We ship UPS ground, and all of our furniture is therefore covered by UPS insurance.\u00a0WE SHIP ONLY IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES - not to Alaska, Hawaii nor outlying US territories. We do not export our products.\u00a0Claims will be handled promptly.\n\nPlease be advised that it may take up to 5 days before an order is shipped. Most of our furniture products are shipped within 2 business days. UPS ground normally takes takes an additonal 4-6 business days to reach most of the continental US - which means that on weekends there is no business activity.\n\nGAZEBO SHIPPING and INSURANCE: Our gazebos are shipped by common carrier (a trucking company) and fully insured. OUR PRICES INCLUDE SHIPPING. We make every effort to ship our the gazebos as soon as possible and will give our customers a fairly accurate timeframe. We strive to get the gazebos out of our shops within 3 weeks, but at peak times we may need up to 6 weeks (including delivery) before you will receive the gazebo. You the customer are always informed of our current timeline - please email a request.\n\nWE SHIP ONLY IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES - not to Alaska, Hawaii nor outlying US territories. We do not export our products.\n\nRETURNS: Unfortunately, as all items come directly out of private workshops, we will only replace damaged items or componets due to shipping. The Amish never return any item because they don't like the color or style, but will make it a thoughtful gift to another. Shipping is relatively expensive, making returns impractical. We will also replace slats or componets if the buyer believes something isn't quite right when he receives their order. If you really do not like the item, and have not assembled it - we will accept a return, but you (the buyer) must pay for the shipping.\n\nKilmer Creek website: copywrite 2003-2008.

(Amended October 10, 2007)\n\n\nIn 2007, MLS\u00ae Committee and the Board of Directors took into consideration the fact that the MLS\u00ae System is a Member-to-Member System, for the exchange and co-operation of listing information and is not an advertising medium.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTherefore, any Virtual Tour that appears on the MLS\u00ae System shall only contain images of the subject property and shall not contain the Listing Brokerage or Salespeople\u2019s names, phone numbers, logos etc.\u00a0 As well, the Virtual Tour company shall not be indicated.\u00a0\n\nFor a complete reading of the TREB MLS\u00ae Rules and Policies, please click here.\n\n\nTagged with:\u00a0treb rules\u00a0virtual tours\u00a0permitted information\u00a0contraventions\n| | Share\n\nPowered by Lone Wolf Real Estate Technologies (CMS6)",
