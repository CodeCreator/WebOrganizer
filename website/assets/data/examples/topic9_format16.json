The best thing about scrap gold is that gold retains its value, regardless of whether it is broken or not, due to its malleability and its ability to be melted down and refined into new products. Scrap gold is usually gold that is broken, out of fashion or is sitting at the bottom of a jewellery box somewhere simply collecting dust. Why not sell that unwanted scrap gold and earn some extra money? It is a quick, reliable and safe way to get cash for gold.\n\nGold buyers\n\nThere are many gold buyers that buy gold, however it can often be a very tiring process trying to finding the best gold buyers to sell your gold scrap to.
