        "text":"Fears over adult-only service for mobiles\n\nBy Bridie Smith\nConsumer Affairs Reporter\n\nOctober 9, 2004\n\nMobile phone users could be able to download pornography, violent video games and gambling sites under a program soon to be available to Optus subscribers.\n\nThe company is likely to join Hutchison Telecommunications and introduce restricted-access services for its mobile customers, despite consumer group fears.\n\nExpected to be known as Optus Zoo Adult, the service would allow subscribers aged 18 and over to download adult services to their mobile phone.\n\nHowever, Optus acting director of mobile partners Chris Lane would not confirm speculation the carrier was about to expand its presence in the lucrative premium services market.\n\nOptus launched Zoo Arcade, which includes ring tones, news and sport updates for subscribers, on Thursday. Games cost up to $15 to download. But an Optus spokeswoman said the carrier was not prepared to comment on plans to introduce age-restricted content.\n\n\"We are waiting for the regulations to come through from the Australian Communications Authority,\" she said.\n\nConsumer Law Centre director Chris Field said talk of introducing adult services was alarming, as the industry was still largely self-regulated, and it would be difficult to ensure children were not exposed to the adult-only content.\n\nIn April, Hutchison Telecommunications' carrier 3 introduced Playboy pictures and videos that can be downloaded to a mobile.\n\nIn May, the Federal Government told the Australian Communications Authority to develop measures to restrict access to adult services delivered by SMS and multi-media messaging. ACA manager of mobile content Vince Humphries said controls could be in place early next year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement",

Photographer: Amanda Gordon\/Bloomberg\n\nApril 2 (Bloomberg) -- \u201cI want to know how he got all those girls naked,\u201d said artist Kenny Scharf over dinner last night at the Waverly Inn, nodding to photographer Sante D\u2019Orazio.\n\nEarlier in the evening, Scharf, Salman Rushdie and John Phelan, co-founder of MSD Capital LP, attended an opening for D\u2019Orazio at Christie\u2019s. Titled \u201cOther Graces,\u201d the exhibition features his large-scale images of Stephanie Seymour, Pamela Anderson and Cindy Crawford, all in the buff.\n\nThe show is the first photography exhibition organized by Christie\u2019s private-sales group, with prices ranging from $60,000 to $90,000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no vulgarity in any of this nudity,\u201d said Inga Rubenstein, a collector and co-host of the dinner, which drew Lisa Dennison, chairman of Sotheby\u2019s North and South America, the shoe designer Brian Atwood and writer Carole Radziwill. \u201cThat\u2019s why we all go for it.\u201d\n\nRubenstein posed for D\u2019Orazio in nothing but Graff jewelry and Jimmy Choo stilettos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trust thing,\u201d said Julius Poole, who has helped D\u2019Orazio with casting and production on photo shoots with Diana Ross and Kim Cattrall. \u201cSante wants everyone to have a fun time. Then the shirts come off, the panties come off and they are rolling naked in the grass.\u201d\n\nChampagne helps.\n\n\u201cWhen we started the shoot at 8 a.m. I was 50 percent dressed,\u201d Rubenstein said. \u201cEight hours and a bottle of champagne later, he gave me a choice: in lingerie or naked. Of course I took it all off.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s D\u2019Orazio\u2019s secret to getting women naked?\n\n\u201cI just smile like my mother has told me,\u201d he said.\n\nMom\u2019s Cooking\n\nAs for the fully clothed subjects, like Brooke Shields, she gave up a different secret: his mom\u2019s cooking. Maria D\u2019Orazio, 90, is still serving up calzoni, pasta and biscotti from her kitchen in Brooklyn, where Sante was raised.\n\n\u201cOh my god, she\u2019s the best cook,\u201d Shields said. As for Sante: \u201cHe absolutely adores his subjects. He makes you feel at your most appealing, beautiful and expressive.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also male eye candy in the show: Johnny Depp in what looks like a towel, Axl Rose with only a strategically placed skull. But some of the most striking photographs star male artists dressed in priestly robes. Edward J. Minskoff, New York-based real-estate developer, has one of Ed Ruscha. It hangs in a colleague\u2019s office \u201cto watch over him,\u201d Minskoff said. \u201cHe oversees construction.\u201d\n\n(Katya Kazakina is a reporter and Amanda Gordon is a writer and photographer for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News.

The Vine is no longer available on Twitter, but there's a photo of him posing with the box afterward:\n\n\nEmboldened by the attention his antics were receiving on social media, he decided to up the ante. He told his followers he\u2019d have sex with a Hot Pocket if he received a minimum number of retweets:\n\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, @VERSACEPOPTARTS reached his goal.\n\nHe posted the video on Vine eight hours later with the hashtag #FoodPorn. Though the clip was deleted shortly afterward, he continued gloating about his achievement on Twitter, telling his followers he\u2019d follow up the Hot Pocket stunt by doing the same with a donut, then a bowl of Jello.\n\n\nHis post-intercourse reverie, however, was short-lived. Two days ago, the folks at Vine abruptly threw a wrench in his plans, suspending his account. (We reached out to Vine and @VERSACEPOPTARTS for comment, and we\u2019ll update if we hear back.)\n\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d indeed.\n\nThen Hot Pockets\u2019 Twitter account blocked him:\n\nNow @VERSACEPOPTARTS is fighting back with the support of his loyal followers. In fact, he seems to have garnered some sort of bizarre sex appeal, with many of his followers tweeting him to ask if they can be his \u201cown personal Hot Pocket.\u201d\n\nHe also shows no signs of slowing down in his quest for Vine food-porn domination. In one of his most recent messages, he told his followers he\u2019d make love to a rotisserie chicken if he received 200 tweets (at the time of this writing, he\u2019s already gotten 411).\n\nSo is Thot Pocket a sex-positive Vine folk hero, or is he just a socially maladroit teenager desperate for follows? That\u2019s up for debate. This much, however, is certain:\n\n\nUpdate:\u00a0As of 6:50pm ET Wednesday, @VERSACEPOPTARTS has been suspended from Twitter, too.\n\nScreengrabs via @VersacePopTarts\/Twitter | Photo by rwentechaney\/Flickr (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)",

The end came after she was taken off life support.\n\nPage\u2019s S&M-tinged photos created a sensation in the 1950s, and gave many a man \u2013 young and old \u2013 wet dreams.\n\nBut even when lashed to a chair, chains around her ankles and a gag over her mouth, there was something innocent and perky about her.\n\nThat look is still there a half-century after the photos were taken.\n\nBack in the 1950s, however, public perception of Page was different.\n\nShe was an underground sensation on the covers of pulp magazines such as Wink, Beauty Parade, Black Nylon and Titter. And her body graced the Christmas-issue centerfold of a then-new magazine called Playboy.\n\nBut that was during the uptight Eisenhower years, and those photos landed her in the hot seat of a nationally televised Senate hearing on pornography.\n\nThings are different now. Her image is considered so harmless that it can be found on kitschy trinkets like lunchboxes, drink coasters and key chains \u2013 even air fresheners. She is considered a style icon.\n\nHer once scandalous bondage flicks, \u201cTeaserama\u201d and \u201cStriporama,\u201d are readily available on DVD. And a few years back, Reni 1\/2e Zellweger appeared on the cover of W magazine in Page-like bangs and black hair.\n\nPage disappeared from the public eye for decades, during which she fought mental illness and became a born-again Christian.\n\nInterest in her career was reignited in the late \u201970s, when bound volumes of her photos introduced her to a new generation. For six years in the 1980s, she was idolized in a fanzine called the Betty Pages (her name was sometimes misspelled).\n\nGretchen Mol portrayed Page in the 2005 movie \u201cThe Notorious Bettie Page,\u201d which the then-fragile old lady got to see at the Playboy Mansion. She enjoyed the movie, but was uneasy that she was referred to as notorious.\n\n\u201cBeing in the nude isn\u2019t a disgrace unless you\u2019re promiscuous about it,\u201d Page said in a rare interview several years ago.\n\n\u201cAfter all, when God created Adam and Eve, they were stark naked. And in the Garden of Eden, God was probably naked as a jaybird, too.\u201d",

They own more vibrators than any other town and were second for bondage items and sexy role play outfits.\n\nAccording to figures Batley ranked 724th for the number of vibrators, 725th for bondage, and 724th for sexual role play.\n\nOther towns propping up the bottom of the list include Salford in Greater Manchester, Barrow in Furness, Cumbria and West Bromwich.\n\nThe map allows users to search search a city, town or county to discover just how sexy where they live really is.\n\nBritain's least kinky towns\n\n1 Batley, West Yorkshire\n\n2 Birkenhead - Merseyside\n\n3 Battle - East Sussex\n\n4 West Bromwich - West Midlands\n\n5 Sale - Greater Manchester\n\n6 Salford - Greater Manchester\n\n7 Barrow-in-Furness - Cumbria\n\n8 Swanscombe - Kent\n\n9 Rayleigh - Essex\n\n10 Mayfield - East Sussex\n\n11 Bexleyheath - South London\n\n12 Esher - Surrey\n\n13 Wirral - Merseyside\n\n14 Kingswinford - West Midlands\n\n15 Ilford - Essex\n\n16 Smethwick - West Midlands\n\n17 Jarrow - Tyne and Wear\n\n18 Walton-on-the-Naze - Essex\n\n19 Bradford - West Yorkshire\n\n20 Rowley Regis - West Midlands\n\nSouthsea in Hampshire was the second sexiest town and came top for bondage. Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire was the third sexiest town and was top for role play - dressing in fantasy costumes during passion. The map shows that sex in the suburbs is booming with the top 20 dominated by commuter towns in the South East.\n\nBathgate in West Lothian, ninth in the UK table, was Scotland\u2019s sexiest town and the Welsh winner was Haverfordwest in Ceredigion - 36th in the UK listings.\n\nLovehoney product director Bonny Hall said: \u201cResidents of Dagenham own more sex toys than anywhere else and they came second for bondage items and sexy role play outfits.\n\n\u201cAll our data shows that couples with great sex lives enjoy higher overall levels of happiness, so head to Dagenham if you want to be part of the UK\u2019s most sexually happy town!\n\n\u201cThe table also shows that sex in the suburbs is booming with lots of commuter towns in the South East featuring in the top 20.\n\nBritain's sexiest towns\n\n1 Dagenham, East London\n\n2 Southsea, Hampshire\n\n3 Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire\n\n4 Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk\n\n5 Sidcup, Kent\n\n6 Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire\n\n7 Romford, Essex\n\n8 Ely, Cambridgeshire\n\n9 Bathgate, West Lothian\n\n10 Sheerness, Kent\n\n11 Woodbridge, Suffolk\n\n12 Chichester, West Sussex\n\n13 Durham, County Durham\n\n14 Newark, Nottinghamshire\n\n15 Uxbridge, West London\n\n16 Newton Abbot, Devon\n\n17 Salisbury, Wiltshire\n\n18 Littleborough, Greater Manchester\n\n19 Cheadle, Greater Manchester\n\n20 Blandford Forum, Dorset\n\n\u201cCouples who have been in settled relationships for years are looking for new ways to spice things up and they are increasingly choosing to experiment together with sex toys for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe map allows you to look up anywhere in the UK, so you can see how sexy your town is, or other towns in your locality or even further afield.\u201d\n\nThe figures are based on Lovehoney\u2019s extensive data on the UK\u2019s sexual behaviour.\n\nLovehoney, the UK\u2019s biggest sex toy retailer, is booming with sales of more than \u00a3100 million annually.\n\nThe Bath-based firm received the Queen\u2019s Award for Enterprise for boosting UK exports.\n\nOwners Richard Longhurst and Neal Slateford met the Queen and Prince Philip at an official reception at Buckingham Palace.",

Come on girls, what would Jenny McCarthy do?\n\nIncidentally, these bare-knuckle beauties were cuffed and stuffed and charged with assault. Court documents not only reveal that this was not the sisters\u2019 first run in with the law, but they also indicate that the two girls are claiming indigence, which essential means that they are too broke to afford legal council. They are scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on December 13.\n\nThe good news is the women\u2019s prison calendar is looking forward to having the sisters on board next year.\n\nMan Arrested For Flashing Breast Implants\n\nBest of B102.7\n\nRecommended for You\n\nBest of the Web\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nIt appears that you already have an account created within our VIP network of sites on .

Net income in the quarter stood at USD 850 million, driven primarily by strong top-line growth.\nThe total company-enabled commerce volume increased 22 per cent in the fourth quarter to USD 61 billion.\nBoth Marketplaces and PayPal achieved record mobile results in 2013, each exceeding USD 20 billion.\nMobile users represented 40 per cent of eBay\u2019s 36 million new users and accounts in 2013, contributing USD 35 billion to commerce volumes.
