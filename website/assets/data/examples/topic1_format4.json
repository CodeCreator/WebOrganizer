I am back this afternoon to share the card I made for this week's Magnolia Down Under Challenge! The challenge is\u00a0Metal\u00a0Mania!!! I hope you can join us this week! The MDUC DT have gorgeous creations to inspire you this week so please stop by the MDU Challenge blog and have a peek and leave them some love!!!\n\nI used more Hello\u00a0Luscious\u00a0paper and I coloured up this absolutely adorable Tilda with Flower Pot,\u00a0from the Butterfly Dreams collection,\u00a0with my Copics!\u00a0I just love her to bits....sooooo cute!!!! I stamped a Magnolia sentiment on a tag cut with a QuicKutz die and I also used one of my CatsLife Press seal stamps,\u00a0Officially\u00a0Spring. I used two Making Memories metal butterflies to comply with this week's challenge to use some metal....I thought\u00a0they\u00a0were the perfect little\u00a0embellishment\u00a0too and I even bent up the wings a bit to add some dimension. To finish it off I add some gorgeous satin ribbon, green half pearls and some Stickles.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHere is the inside...pretty simple, as always. I used a\u00a0sentiment\u00a0from the My Favorite Things More Essential Sentiments set and I used a MFT die-namics die\n\nWell, thanks for stopping by again today to have a wee peek at my Magnolia Down Under Challenges card! Hope you can join the challenge!\n\n\n\nKirsty said...\n\nHi Wow she is so sweet and she pops right out of the page with your bright colours. Love the spring sentiment too.

I competed in the Off the Wall Craftiness blog challenge for Week 42. If you all haven't visited this blog - it is just great! There is a fun challenge posted each week. There are also cute stamps by Wilson Designs for sale - I used the Ride Away with Me stamp set for the challenge.\n\nHere are the inspiration photo and challenge colors: orange, white, and teal.\n\nHere is my card. In keeping with my latest vintage \"craze\", I used the challenge colors, but gave them a vintage feel. The DARLING typewriter stamp is from Wilson Designs. I also used stamps from Papertrey Ink, Stampin Up, Crafty Secrets and 7 Gypsies. The patterned paper is from my Cricut Imagine and DCWV. Hope you like it!\n\nSupplies used:\nWilson Designs Ride Away with Me stamp set (typewriter)\nCricut Imagine Elise pattern cartridge\nCricut Paper Lace cartridge\nStampin' Up!

Crash! Landen Says:\n\n    Thanks Sean C! Comments always welcomed\u2026. There are more errors than just the one you pointed out actually (although I would argue that you CAN put your foot in that position. I just stood up and did it).\n\n    This was just a quick drawing to complete the \u2018one a day\u2019 obligation that I had agreed to. I might even go far as to say that this was a \u2018throwaway\u2019. It was just meant to be a fun thing.\n\n    I\u2019m a bit sloppy anyway, though. I practice the \u2018Dirty Mop\u2019 style of Kung Fu (gong sounds)\n\n  2. Sean C Says:\n\n    Really late reply, I know. But I have to say that I really enjoy your artwork, really vibrant and bold. But I feel I have to comment on this artwork. The problem with this piece is his right foot, from our point of view the left, the ankle and foot cannot bend that way when the knee is facing us. Either adjust the position of the foot, or adjust the leg and the knee. A bit of reference might help here, whether it is a muscle mag or a photo of yourself making the pose.\n\n    I really like the character, but I just feel that this should be pointed out. It\u2019s a shame to see one tiny element take away from a strong piece.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"Saturday, October 9, 2010\n\nWinners for Challenge 18--Monochromatic\n\nI can't tell you how much I enjoyed ALL the creations you talented stampers made this week! My heart was going aflutter at all the beauty! Some of you said you struggled with monochromatic colors, others said you'd never tried it or rarely used them, so I was glad I challenged you to stamp outside your comfort zone, and I hope you use that theme more often!\n\nHere are our designers' picks this week for the Cut Aboves:\n\nNance's choice: Linda Callahan\n\nFor all it's dark, gothic elegance I had to choose this stunning card from Linda Callahan. I love the starkness of the candelabra and spider web against all the rich designer papers and the Black Raven lace is just the perfect touch on a beautiful card...congratulations, Linda!\n\nJaydee's Pick: Rose's Vintage Santa\n\nThere were so many great cards this week, but this Christmas creation from Rose just stole my heart. I love the fact that Rose mixed the vintage feel paper with the crisp white of the more modern santa and the top note die. The ribbon and button are gorgeous! This card made me smile!\n\nLesley's Pick: Vicki Burdick\nI chose Vicki's cute paper pads and matching cards in the \"In Colours\". The sweet little paper clips with the flowers and pearls really caught my eye! The \"In Colour\" designer paper looks amazing with this project!\n\nAnn's Pick: Anne Marie HileWith all of the fabulous cards submitted this week, I found it difficult to select just one! However, I adored this stunning creation by Anne Marie Hile. I loved how the swirls on the embossed background complimented the swirls of the tree. From the shimmer paint to the rhinestones, the \"bling\" was glorious, resulting in a card that anyone would love to receive!\n\nAnd my choice for the Headliner is:\n\nThe minute I saw this stunning gift bag that Ann made, I was head over heels!!! The unique color she used for a winter scene caught my eye right away, but the coloring, the attention to details and the fussy-cutting of her skaters put it over the top! I love the layout as well, and she even made a card to go with it! Congratulations, Ann, for being our Headliner of the Week!\n\n\n  1. How exciting!!! You've made my day - thanks so much for the Headliner of the week award and I'm so glad you liked my gift bag. I loved the challenge and am looking forward to participating in more.\n\n  2. Such beautiful cards - I am honored to be among them! Thanks Nance for the pick and all of your kind words - I'm still smiling :) And thanks LeAnne for the challenge - looking forward to more!\n\n  3. Sucha gorgeous cards - congratulations to Ann - so well deserved my friend - I can't wait to see more! {{{hugs}}}\n\n  4. Great challenge this week! Such great inspiration from everyone. Monochromatic is where it's at!\n\n    Congrats to Ann, your bag is just stunning. I also want to say a special thank you to Ann S. for the recognition on my card. It is a huge honor coming from an artist who's work I admire so much. You made my day! :)\n\n  5. Congrats, Ladies! I think all of these creations are lovely :)\n\n  6. oh those cards are just totally gorgeous.\n    Ann xxx\n\n\nWe love reading your comments! Thank you!",

        "text":"Portfolio critic\n\nHey all,\n\nWould love your views on my current portfolio.\n\n\nSep 22, 17 3:00 pm\n\nHello, I\u00a0looked at it. Now I\u00a0am going to go get two books. The number of times I have hired someone based on a portfolio = zero. The one person I collab with, I\u00a0met that person at a firm so I got to see how she works.\n\nMaybe do a video of you working on something?\n\nCheers. DC\n\nSep 22, 17 4:07 pm\n\nI would recommend making it a GIF so it plays and loops automatically on all devices.\n\n\nHey David, Thanks\n\n\nSo much text yet your contribution to those projects remains unclear to me. Also can't really tell the difference between academic work or professional, it never really goes deep enough or becomes concrete enough. Is URBANFRAME perhaps just the name under which you do some competitions by yourself? The only workplace where you describe your personal tasks and role more precise was your internship, but you don't show any worksamples of the work you did, why? Also, your CV is unnecessary long for this stage of your career. Most often the CV should fit on one portrait page, max. two, so you can send it as a separate file and is easy to print.\n\nSep 23, 17 2:11 am\n\nHey randomized, Thanks for your valuable feedback.\n\n\nThey're more questions than feedback but you're welcome I guess, good luck with the job hunt or commission hunt!\n\nSo.. I agree myself as its a test run I thought let's give it a shot with text to explain the whole process. But clearly it's not helping.\n\nAnd yes..Mentioning of specific roles and responsibilities...Going in right now.\u00a0 So as this portfolio is specifically towards job applications..The idea was to show previews of what all varieties I have worked on and for interviews I have a 2nd detailed portfolio which I use to go in deeper into the projects. Urbanframe is a new name of the firm I work for as we are re-branding it, in addition to that I founded a platform where multiple events take place where by opening the office on a city level engagement.\n\nas for CV, well thats a perspective , i dont entirely agree with the point \"unnecessary long for this stage of your career\". But thanks anyways. hope now i answered your questions. :)\n\nBlock this user\n\nAre you sure you want to block this user and hide all related comments throughout the site?\n\n  \u2022 \u00d7Search in:",
