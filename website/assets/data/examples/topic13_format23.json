Findlay, Author University of California Press $50 (394p) ISBN 978-0-520-07703-4\nReviewed on: 09\/28\/1992\nRelease date: 10\/01\/1992\nThe four planned cityscapes examined in Findlay's arresting study had an impact on urban design and architecture across the United States. Disneyland, with its theme-park concept, influenced shopping malls, Main Streets and historic districts. Stanford Industrial Park in Palo Alto, Calif., a research center which became ``downtown'' for Silicon Valley, blended elements of the suburbs and the campus into an unprecedented site for industry. The retirement community of Sun City, Ariz.--outside Phoenix and tailored to its affluent members' tastes and needs--demonstrated how to keep the city at bay. The Seattle Center, a civic complex built on the site of the 1962 World's Fair, brought suburbia to the central city. These and other ``magic kingdoms'' were designed to insulate people from urban chaos, yet paradoxically, argues Findlay, they reinforced social divisions, increased environmental problems and accentuated urban sprawl. This provocative study rethinks the meaning of urbanization in the American West. Findlay is associate professor of history at the University of Washington. Photos.

        "text":"Wednesday, September 17, 2014\n\nVillage of Secrets: Defying the Nazis in Vichy France\n\n\nToday\u2019s nonfiction post is on Village of Secrets: Defying the Nazis in Vichy France by Caroline Moorehead. It is 384 pages long including notes and a bibliography. The cover is a picture of village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. The intended reader is someone who is interested in War World 2 history and hopeful, real life bravery. There is no sex, no language, and the violence is just talked about. The story is told from third person close with letters and interviews added in for depth. There Be Spoilers Ahead.\n\nFrom the back of the book- Le Chambon-sur-Lignonis a small village of scattered houses high in the mountains of the Ardeche, one of the most remote and inaccessible parts of eastern France. During the Second World War, the inhabitants of this tiny mountain village and its parishes saved thousands wanted by the Gestapo: resisters, Freemasons, communists, OSS and SOE agents, and Jews. Many of those they protected were orphaned children and babies whose parents had been deported to concentration camps.\nWith unprecedented access to newly opened archives in France, Britain, and Germany, and interviews with some of the villagers from the period who are still alive, Caroline Moorehead pains an inspiring portrait of courage and determination: of what was accomplished when a small group of people banded together to oppose their Nazi occupiers. A thrilling and atmospheric tale of silence and complicity, Village of Secrets reveals how every one of the inhabitants of Chambon remained silent in a country infamous for collaboration. Yet it is also a story about mythmaking, and the fallibility of memory.\nA major contribution to WWII history, illustrated with black-and-white photo, Village of Secrets sets the record straight about the events in Chambon, and pays tribute to a group of heroic individuals, most of them women, for whom saving others became more important their own lives.\n\nReview- I found this to be a very inspiring story. One group of people led by both their local leaders and their own sense of right decided that no one was going to the Germans. This village was truly something unique. Over the course of the occupation only 12 people were taken from Le Chambon-sur-Lignonis. They hid at least 883 people and if you count all the people who hid there for a short time or just passed through to get documents the numbers become staggering. The writing is approachable. The story is moving and the real people are interesting. Moorehead wants to try and set the record straight about this little village and the province that it is in. The people who live and lived there value silence so there has been rumor with little to no fact checking but Moorehead was able to get more information. With archives opening up, interviews with children who lived there and through the war, and just plain old research she wants to lift the veil on this story. I think she did but I knew nothing about this place and its people before reading this book. I am going to be doing some personal research into this now to see for myself.\n\nI give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I was given this book by HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review.",

I was able to find the date of death of their relative and track down which cemetery he now lies in. By then\u00a0accessing the battalion war diary for his unit it was possible\u00a0to find that only one man from this unit had died on 31.8.15 and therefore it was him! (see note below)\n\nHere is the war diary for the end of August 1915 \u2013 the only report of OR casualties is a man killed by a sniper on the 31-8-1915. This is one of the War Diary\u2019s briefer periods describing events.\n\nThis has now enabled a tour to be planned in the near future which will follow Clarke\u2019s travels in France, his transfer from the Notts and Derbys to the Northants regiment, the place of his death whilst working in no mans land and a visit to the cemetery in which he now rests.\n\n  \u2022 War Record\n\nJonathan, you are a friend indeed!\u00a0 Once again, this is probably all I would need to know about Cpl.

        "text":"Jeffers on Hammon, 'My Father, Daniel Boone: The Draper Interviews with Nathan Boone'\n\nNeal O. Hammon, ed.\nJoshua J. Jeffers\n\nNeal O. Hammon, ed. My Father, Daniel Boone: The Draper Interviews with Nathan Boone. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2012. xi + 180 pp. $17.95 (paper), ISBN 978-0-8131-3465-9; $50.00 (cloth), ISBN 978-0-8131-2103-1.\n\nReviewed by Joshua J. Jeffers (purdue university)\nPublished on H-Kentucky (December, 2012)\nCommissioned by Richard C. Smoot\n\nLyman C. Draper is easily one of the most prolific collectors of documentary and oral history that America has ever produced. As secretary of the Wisconsin Historical Society, Draper spent nearly forty years as a diligent archivist amassing one of the most extensive collections in the world of materials relating to trans-Appalachian frontier history. Long before any historian had ever heard the term \u201cfrontier history,\u201d he was compiling oral histories and collecting family records in an attempt to preserve the heroic exploits of the early West that he found so fascinating. In doing so, he established a standard for historical conservation and preserved a window into a time in the American past that has profoundly shaped American identity. Thus, the publication of Draper\u2019s interviews with Nathan and Olive Boone highlights the lives of two great pioneers: one a frontiersman who led American settlers into the territory of hostile Native Americans, wrested from them the land of Kentucky, and became a legend in his own lifetime; the other a far lesser-known figure, \u201cfrail, scarcely five feet tall, weighing around one hundred pounds\u201d and suffering from \u201ca number of health problems, some real some imagined,\u201d but a visionary nonetheless--a frontiersman of the past and a pioneer of historical record keeping (p. 2).\n\nDuring the 1830s, Draper began to correspond with a number of survivors or relatives of survivors of the early trans-Appalachian West with the intention of writing biographies of the great frontiersmen. In 1840, after many descendants complained of errors in existing publications, he set out to write the first--a biography of Daniel Boone. In 1851, just prior to receiving his appointment at the Wisconsin Historical Society, Draper interviewed the youngest son of Boone, Nathan Boone, and his wife Olive, the last surviving son and daughter-in-law of the famous pioneer. Draper compiled more than three hundred pages of notes, comments, and dialogue in this interview alone. Though Draper\u2019s Boone biography was never completed (the incomplete manuscript was published in 1998), the resources that he collected enabled numerous later scholars, most recently, John Mack Faragher (Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer [1992]), Michael Lofaro (Daniel Boone: An American Life\u00a0[2003]), Robert Morgan (Boone: A Biography [2007]), and Meredith Mason Brown (Frontiersman: Daniel Boone and the Making of America\u00a0[2008]), to put together well-informed and extensively detailed biographies. And by editing and publishing these interviews, these scholars would no doubt agree, Neal O. Hammon has performed an important service. Prior to the 1999 publication of these interviews in hardback, these valuable accounts were available only in manuscript form or on microfilm. Now rereleased in paperback, Hammon\u2019s engaging presentation of this ihistorical account is even more accessible to students, scholars, and the general public interested in the history of the early West and the life and times of this remarkable historical figure.\n\nDraper\u2019s record constitutes the clearest window that we have into the personal character, motives, and personality of Daniel Boone, which makes it invaluable for historians of the early West. Moreover, anyone who has used the Draper manuscripts will recognize and appreciate the effort that went into this publication. Hammon\u2019s organization condenses Draper\u2019s three hundred pages of narrative dialogue, annotated with extensive margin notes, corrections, and personal opinions, into a chronological and highly readable document that reads more like a narrative history of Boone\u2019s life than an oral interview with his seventy-year-old son and sixty-eight-year-old daughter-in-law. What is more, the profound level of detail that the Boones were able to recall about Daniel Boone\u2019s life attests to the vitality of their oral tradition. Thus, Draper\u2019s record of the family history preserved by that oral tradition makes this publication valuable not only for the details that it makes available regarding Boone\u2019s life, but also for the window it provides into the importance and value of oral evidence.\n\nHammon\u2019s representation of this material is honest and interesting, and the tact with which he organizes the information, complete with relevant and informative contextual footnotes, may have even met the expectations of the meticulous Draper. Hammon does, however, take some liberties for the sake of readability that could prove troubling for historical researchers. For example, he alters Draper\u2019s third person voice to an imagined first person so that the dialogue reads like a verbatim transcription of the interview. While not particularly problematic with regard to the content, this editorial choice, as reviewers of the hardback edition have suggested, undermines the integrity of the text for purposes of quotation in historical writing, though Hammon does cite the page numbers of Draper\u2019s notes so that it is easier to correlate with the original. Moreover, there are a few factual, or perhaps typographical, errors in the text that Hammon fails to mention in the footnotes. For example, Dr. Thomas Walker visited Kentucky in 1750, not 1760, and Nathan Boone acted as guide for William Clark in 1805, not 1808 (pp. 15, 126). But such concerns are minor in relation to the value and expediency of having such a notable source in an inexpensive format. As an example of both historical research and the difficulties of doing history, as well as presenting the history of westward expansion and frontier life, this book would be an excellent addition to an American history survey course, a possibility made more feasible with the publication of a paperback edition.\n\nThis edition also includes genealogical information on the Boone, Bryan, Calloway, and Van Bibber families, and incorporates a revealing postscript that discusses some of the discrepancies in the Boones\u2019s accounts, which are as revealing as they are intriguing. For example, it appears that Nathan Boone intentionally skewed some details of his account in order to disguise his own less than honest attempt to profit from his father\u2019s name. Filled with great insight into pioneer life in the trans-Appalachian West, this book certainly fires one\u2019s imagination. The history of this famous individual\u2019s life and the times and places in which he lived strikes a nostalgic chord, which makes the unfortunate loss of Daniel Boone\u2019s own dictated memoir in a canoeing accident in 1813, and the subsequent disappearance of its replacement in 1842, all the more regrettable. Nevertheless, it is these losses that make Draper\u2019s interview with the Boones even more gripping and important. Thus, we are indeed fortunate to have such a highly readable account of this valuable interview in such a convenient and accessible format.\n\nPrintable Version:\n\nCitation: Joshua J. Jeffers.

        "text":"Friday, June 15, 2018\n\nBook Review: The Royal Art of Poison\n\nAuthor: Eleanor Herman\nPublication Date: June 12, 2018\nPublisher: St. Martin\u2019s Press\n\nHugely entertaining, a work of pop history that traces the use of poison as a political\u2015and cosmetic\u2015tool in the royal courts of Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the Kremlin today\n\nThe story of poison is the story of power. For centuries, royal families have feared the gut-roiling, vomit-inducing agony of a little something added to their food or wine by an enemy. To avoid poison, they depended on tasters, unicorn horns, and antidotes tested on condemned prisoners. Servants licked the royal family\u2019s spoons, tried on their underpants and tested their chamber pots.\n\nIronically, royals terrified of poison were unknowingly poisoning themselves daily with their cosmetics, medications, and filthy living conditions. Women wore makeup made with mercury and lead. Men rubbed turds on their bald spots. Physicians prescribed mercury enemas, arsenic skin cream, drinks of lead filings, and potions of human fat and skull, fresh from the executioner. The most gorgeous palaces were little better than filthy latrines. Gazing at gorgeous portraits of centuries past, we don\u2019t see what lies beneath the royal robes and the stench of unwashed bodies; the lice feasting on private parts; and worms nesting in the intestines.\n\nIn The Royal Art of Poison, Eleanor Herman combines her unique access to royal archives with cutting-edge forensic discoveries to tell the true story of Europe\u2019s glittering palaces: one of medical bafflement, poisonous cosmetics, ever-present excrement, festering natural illness, and, sometimes, murder.\n\nThis book is a fascinating look at poison, as you might have guessed from the title. However, this book looks at more than just death by poison, but also accidental poisoning, poisons in medical treatments, and poisons in skin care, what was used for makeup, and even in clothing. I was so enthralled by the history I learned about here. Herman\u2019s voice and writing is witty and many parts of this book were laugh out loud hysterical. Things that sound common sense and second nature to us today were not so easily understandable years ago. Many famous deaths are categorized throughout the pages \u2013 showing how poison was used purposefully and not so purposefully cause death. Herman\u2019s writing was enrapturing, her facts are ones I would have never been able to find out on my own, and her voice caused this book to not feel like a history lesson, but a stirring, rousing thriller with a killer ending.\n\nImagine a king casting his gaze over a feast of roasted meats, rich sauces, glazed honey cakes, and fine wine. Even though his stomach rumbles with hunger, he might lose his appetite when considering that on the table could, in fact, cause him to die horribly over the next few hours.\n\nOver the centuries, royal courts developed methods for detecting poison or, if poison had been consumed, for reversing its fatal effects. Most such methods were both medically useless and extraordinary silly, yet they were trusted by some of the most powerful and educated people in Europe.\n\nLooking around our Ikea-filled apartments, many of us might utter a soul-deep sigh as we ponder the marble floors, gilt ceilings, and finely carved furniture of European palaces in centuries past. We would be less envious, perhaps, if we remembered that the most magnificent chambers were befouled by parasites, bacteria, viruses, and environmental poisons that carried far more victims to the grave than arsenic ever did.\n\nPalaces were, in fact, a dominion of dung. Inside those lacquered cabinets were chamber pots brimming with a stinking view of human waste. The contents of chamber pots were thrown down latrines, open holes with wooden seats and a straight shot down either into the castle moat, which frequently featured floating turds, or into the palace basement, which was only cleaned \u2013 and that must have been quite a job \u2013 when full to bursting. The human waste below Henry VIII\u2019s Great House of Easement, a two-story deluxe toilet facility at Hampton Court with twenty-eight holes, rose head-high before it was cleaned out.\n\nThis would be the perfect beach read \u2013 of course, you might get some weird looks if you chose to read it anywhere in public. I forgot that what I was reading was non-fiction more times than one. Some of my favorite parts of this book were reading about famous deaths like Mozart and Napoleon Bonaparte. I learned more in this book than I ever could have in a history class. Such a entertaining, clever read!\n\n***A free copy of this book was provided to me by the publishers at St. Martin\u2019s Press in exchange for my honest review***\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Slavery on trial in the oregon territory\n\nOverland Journal: Reviews from the Trail\n\nBy Roger Blair\n\nIn the span of a year, three Oregon authors wrote books about Oregon Trail pioneers who brought slaves to Oregon and the efforts of those slaves to gain freedom for themselves or their loved ones.\n\nTwo of those books, Jane Kirkpatrick\u2019s A Light in the Wilderness (2014) and Phillip Margolin\u2019s Worthy Brown\u2019s Daughter (2014), are fiction based upon actual events.\n\nThe third, R. Gregory Nokes\u2019s Breaking Chains (2013), is non-fiction and discusses the events fictionalized in the other two. Nokes carefully discusses the background leading up to the 1852 trial of Nathaniel Ford\u2019s slave Robin Holmes versus Ford to gain the promised, but unfulfilled, freedom of Holmes\u2019s children. This background includes the history of Oregon\u2019s lure; the land laws and laws against blacks in Oregon whether free or slaves; and other black history in Oregon before 1852. Using previously published\u00a0sources and Ford family history, the author describes Ford\u2019s 1844 wagon train over the Oregon Trail. He then goes on to cover Ford\u2019s and Holmes\u2019s settlement in Polk County, and Ford\u2019s involvement in establishing the Applegate Trail, also called the Southern Route.\n\nThe bulk of the book covers the unique trial in 1852 when Holmes sued for and won the freedom of his children, whom Ford had refused to surrender as promised. The trial is detailed from actual court records, the only slavery case to be decided in an Oregon court.\n\nNokes goes on to discuss the stories of other blacks in Oregon during the Oregon Trail era, including one person brought over by his ancestors. The author states that his interest in this story started with a mention of slaves in his own family genealogy. He is a direct descendant of 1853 emigrants, including one who brought a slave to Oregon from Kentucky. Nokes, of West Linn, Oregon, was a reporter for the Associated Press and editor of The Oregonian newspaper. Nokes includes two quotes in his prologue to explain the purpose of writing this book. The first, from Darrell Millner, professor of black studies at Portland State University, says \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t necessarily apply today\u2019s standards to events of the past. But we shouldn\u2019t hide our past either.\u201d\n\nThe second, from Nokes, says \u201cIf I were in school again, I would want to understand the real history of our state, not a sanitized version that misleads us into myths and misplaced self-satisfaction. We can learn from our past. We should.\u201d This reviewer very much agrees.",

Williams, Special Education Teacher\n\n\u201cMichele and her mother, Joyce Stokes Jones, have spent many of hours, days, weeks and years to bring to all the life and legacy of Harriet Tubman\u2019 past and now the future. Sitting at the grave site to celebrate the life of the long lost relative, great-grandfather Thomas Elliott and the history that it holds makes one think of their own ancestors and the struggles that they had.\u00a0 It was great to have my grandson there to share with him firsthand the struggles of our ancestors.\u00a0 We have only heard and read about the life of Harriet Tubman of the past, but this book will bring a different, exciting light on Harriet\u2019s life that continues on today through Michele and Joyce.\u201d\n\nSite by Ashtian Holmes",
