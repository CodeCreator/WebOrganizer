        "text":"Wednesday, September 17, 2014\n\nVillage of Secrets: Defying the Nazis in Vichy France\n\n\nToday\u2019s nonfiction post is on Village of Secrets: Defying the Nazis in Vichy France by Caroline Moorehead. It is 384 pages long including notes and a bibliography. The cover is a picture of village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. The intended reader is someone who is interested in War World 2 history and hopeful, real life bravery. There is no sex, no language, and the violence is just talked about. The story is told from third person close with letters and interviews added in for depth. There Be Spoilers Ahead.\n\nFrom the back of the book- Le Chambon-sur-Lignonis a small village of scattered houses high in the mountains of the Ardeche, one of the most remote and inaccessible parts of eastern France. During the Second World War, the inhabitants of this tiny mountain village and its parishes saved thousands wanted by the Gestapo: resisters, Freemasons, communists, OSS and SOE agents, and Jews. Many of those they protected were orphaned children and babies whose parents had been deported to concentration camps.\nWith unprecedented access to newly opened archives in France, Britain, and Germany, and interviews with some of the villagers from the period who are still alive, Caroline Moorehead pains an inspiring portrait of courage and determination: of what was accomplished when a small group of people banded together to oppose their Nazi occupiers. A thrilling and atmospheric tale of silence and complicity, Village of Secrets reveals how every one of the inhabitants of Chambon remained silent in a country infamous for collaboration. Yet it is also a story about mythmaking, and the fallibility of memory.\nA major contribution to WWII history, illustrated with black-and-white photo, Village of Secrets sets the record straight about the events in Chambon, and pays tribute to a group of heroic individuals, most of them women, for whom saving others became more important their own lives.\n\nReview- I found this to be a very inspiring story. One group of people led by both their local leaders and their own sense of right decided that no one was going to the Germans. This village was truly something unique. Over the course of the occupation only 12 people were taken from Le Chambon-sur-Lignonis. They hid at least 883 people and if you count all the people who hid there for a short time or just passed through to get documents the numbers become staggering. The writing is approachable. The story is moving and the real people are interesting. Moorehead wants to try and set the record straight about this little village and the province that it is in. The people who live and lived there value silence so there has been rumor with little to no fact checking but Moorehead was able to get more information. With archives opening up, interviews with children who lived there and through the war, and just plain old research she wants to lift the veil on this story. I think she did but I knew nothing about this place and its people before reading this book. I am going to be doing some personal research into this now to see for myself.\n\nI give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I was given this book by HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review.",

I was able to find the date of death of their relative and track down which cemetery he now lies in. By then\u00a0accessing the battalion war diary for his unit it was possible\u00a0to find that only one man from this unit had died on 31.8.15 and therefore it was him! (see note below)\n\nHere is the war diary for the end of August 1915 \u2013 the only report of OR casualties is a man killed by a sniper on the 31-8-1915. This is one of the War Diary\u2019s briefer periods describing events.\n\nThis has now enabled a tour to be planned in the near future which will follow Clarke\u2019s travels in France, his transfer from the Notts and Derbys to the Northants regiment, the place of his death whilst working in no mans land and a visit to the cemetery in which he now rests.\n\n  \u2022 War Record\n\nJonathan, you are a friend indeed!\u00a0 Once again, this is probably all I would need to know about Cpl.

I\u2019ve been researching my family history since Christmas and Sidneys story has been very sad. I know all about his life (unless there\u2019s more poverty and sadness to uncover!) his dad disappears with another woman and marries another woman, fairly sure he\u2019s committed bigamy. His mother turns to prostitution. Sidney is arrested for wandering at 11 1\/2 years old in a poor condition. Before this he has moved to six different schools around London.\n\nJade \u2013 Manchester \u2013 Mar 2017\n\n\nHi Jonathan,\n\nThank you so much for the information that you have researched so efficiently and speedily, with respect to my Grandfathers experience during the 1st World War.\n\nTony D, Lancs \u2013 Jan\/Feb 2017\n\n\nHi Jonathan,\n\nCan\u2019t wait for the grandchildren to get older so I can pass all the information and photos on.

Thank you.\n\n  \u2022 I know that Uncle Reg was riding a Shire Horse when he met my grandfather on the Somme Battlefield, going in the opposite direction. He told me this himself, and said \u201cHello, Harry, what are you doing down there?\u201d to which my grandfather said,\u201dHello, Reg. What are you doing up there?\u201d by which time their respective columns had moved past each other\u2026\u2026.. So that would back up the Royal Horse Artillery element of the card, I think.Best wishesDavid\n  \u2022 Jan 2014\n\n\nHi Jonathan\n\nThanks for your prompt reply; even the info about the medals adds to my knowledge.\n\nI know that Corney settled in the Worksop area after the war so this tends to support your theory about his unit.\u00a0 I have attached the only photo that I have of him in uniform \u2013 you may be able to enlarge it and identify his unit badges.\u00a0 He was fortunate to be able to return to his wife and they had about 5 children and he survived into his sixties.\u00a0 His original occupation was a horseman and he told his relatives that that was why the army wanted him; not for his soldiering skills.Many thanks for your interest and support,\n\nChas P. Sept 2013\n\n\nHi Jonathan,\n\nI visited the exhibition at Christ\u2019s Hospital School yesterday and you very kindly found a certificate relating to the death of my uncle, aged 24 years, on the Burma Railway. \u00a0There was also a picture of the cemetery where he is buried near the border with Thailand. \u00a0If possible, could you forward me this information. \u00a0I am more than happy to reimburse you any costs that you might incur downloading the documents. \u00a0I am undecided at the moment whether to pursue the matter any further but I will discuss it with my brother as he holds what papers we have relating to the death. \u00a0I would also like to thank you for the kindness you showed me yesterday, it was very much appreciated.\n\n\nLinda P.\u00a0 (Sept 2013)\n\n\nJust seen the books that you have for sale\u2026 excellent prices! I am willing to take these books\u2026\n\nTom L, Birmingham. Sept 2013\n\n\nHi Jonathan\n\nI really appreciate this you don\u2019t realise how much finding this out really means as this is the first\u00a0 real look into my dad\u2019s side of family as I lost contact with the only living relatives when my dad died and i was very young.\n\nEddie K \u2013 May 2013\n\n\nDear Jonathan\n\nThank you again for your commitment to our endeavours on the Normandy beaches and beyond. It was a fantastic trip for everyone involved there was so much emotion and fun which I have already said to Yvonne has left our hearts full of warm recollections and our heads full of the D-day legacy! Whilst the weather was a little challenging at times we have to keep in mind it was February, thanks for persevering with it, having maps and papers\u00a0laminated was an inspiration.\n\n\nRobert T \u2013 March 2013\n\n\nDear Jonathan\n\nWe would like to say a big thankyou to you for making this trip informative , interesting & enjoyable . You put such a lot of effort in to researching \u00a0facts & itinerary .\n\nIt was great that we all got on so well & had a bit of fun along the way ! Shame about the weather !\n\nI must admit that some moments were quite emotional for Mon & I .

        "text":"Polar Book Review\n\n\nBook Reviews\nChildren's Books\nDVDs & Videos\nHow to contact us\nAbout us\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\n\n'Don't go looking for Antarctica without this book.' - Susan Solomon\n\n\n\n\nBritish Polar Exploration and Research: A Historical and medallic record with biographies 1818\u20131999\n\nby Lieutenant Colonel Neville W. Poulsom and Rear Admiral J.A.L. Myres, CB\nSavannah Publications, 2000, 742 pp\nISBN: 1-902366-05-0\nPrice: \u00a380.00 hardback\n\n\n\nAs a longtime researcher and collector of polar medals, an updated and revised edition of Lieut.-Col. Poulsom's 1968 work The White Ribbon had been anticipated for several years. The result is a book three times the length of its predecessor, and though it may seem expensive at \u00a380, one should bear in mind that scarce used copies of the original White Ribbon sell for \u00a350\u201360.\n\nRegarding descriptions of the primary medals concerned (Arctic 1818\u201355, Arctic 1875\u201376 and 1904 Polar Medals) and related expedition histories, the text of the new work was essentially taken directly from The White Ribbon. Additions and corrections were made, most notably much additional information on the Hudson's Bay Company recipients.\n\nGlancing at the early Antarctic scene, the reviewer notes that Ross did request an Arctic 1818\u20131855 Medal (First Arctic) for his crews, but it was refused by the Admiralty. As several of these men also participated in Arctic voyages which qualified for the award, it's a pity that a full listing of these \u201cnorth and south men\u201d was not included in the book.\n\nThe heart of this reference work lies in the biographical and medallic information. There is no doubt that there has been a wealth of data added since the publication of The White Ribbon, and that this information will benefit collectors and researchers for years to come. However, I am mystified by the minefield of errors and omissions due to the severe underutilization of published data and original research made available to the authors.\n\nSome 250 pages contain in alphabetical listing of persons eligible for the First Arctic Medal, along with varying amounts of biographical information, whether or not the medal was issued to the individual or next of kin, and if a named\/attributable medal is known to exist. The award was issued with a plain edge, though several recipients\/family members had it engraved with individual details. Though this section has many biographical details, much of what is currently in print has been left untouched.\n\nWhether or not the First Arctic Medal was issued to an individual or his next of kin is supposedly indicated on the original roll in a column titled \u201cWhen delivered or sent. Remarks &c.\u201d I write supposedly indicated because medal rolls are known to contain inaccuracies and omissions. When Poulsom has \u201cNo medal issued.\u201d by a man\u2019s name, he is assuming the blank in the Remarks column means a medal was never issued for that individual. I asked a longtime medal researcher about this, and he replied: \u201cI agree that the lack of positive information is an insecure basis to decide categorically whether or not a medal has or has not been issued.\u201d\n\nThe third point, named\/attributed medals known to exist, is of particular concern to collectors, since Poulsom rarely gives naming details, the question of provenance rears its head in no small way. The omission of documents and artefacts accompanying medals is frequent throughout the book, and thus a golden opportunity to highlight the historical integrity\/dubious provenance of such items was lost.\n\nOne section of the book that I was particularly keen on seeing covers the Arctic 1875\u201376 Medal (Second Arctic). The medal was issued named in a distinct style, and a wealth of information exists in published sources alone regarding both officers and other ranks. However, a mere 14 pages are devoted to the 155 recipients of HMS Alert and Discovery, and the private vessel Pandora. Oddly, there is no mention that the Pandora was purchased and renamed Jeannette, and used in the tragic 1879\u201382 American Arctic expedition. Yet, the medal issued for this venture is described in the book.\n\nChapter 2\u2019s narrative of the 1875\u201376 expedition mentions that a Greenland native named Hans Hendrik (Hans Henry on the medal roll, and also spelled Hendrick\/Henri\/Heindrich in various sources) joined the Discovery at Proven, Greenland. His full name was Hans Christian Hendrik, and his prominence during Arctic exploration over 20 years is not even hinted at in the text. He served as a dog sledge driver and hunter on four expeditions: Kane\/1853\u201354, Hayes\/1860\u201361, Hall\/1871\u201373, and during the 1875\u201376 venture. Hendrik\u2019s participation in the Kane Expedition qualified him for the First Arctic Medal. His name never made it on the official medal roll, and therefore he missed out on being one of possibly only four men entitled to both First and Second Arctic issues. [In 2008, I discovered that five men appear entitled to both medals, but evidently only four actually received both awards.\u2014 GMS] Poulsom treats the Hans Christian for 1853\u201354 and the Hans Henry for 1875\u201376 as two different individuals.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why two well known books about the 1875\u201376 voyage were not consulted (at least, they are not listed in the bibliography): Nares\u2019 Narrative of a Voyage to the Polar Sea (two volumes\/1878) and Markham\u2019s The Great Frozen Sea (1894). These works would have at least allowed for a far fuller picture of sledging activities. In addition, Nares\u2019 book identifies each sailor\u2019s rating, allowing several men to escape the bland rank descriptions of Petty Officer 1st or 2nd Class found in Poulsom and Myres.\n\nTwo glaring errors regarding the Northern Sledge Party need to be addressed. In describing this party\u2019s rescue, it is stated that \u201c... they were all recovered.\u201d Yet, under Gunner Porter's entry is written, \u201cDied of scurvy on June 8, 1876 at 27 years of age whilst returning with the Northern Sledge Party with HM Sledge Victoria.\" Equally inexplicable is the information under Feilden\u2014\u201c\u2026he was in the Northern Sledge Party towards the North Pole.\u201d Feilden, a naturalist with the expedition, never served with the Northern Sledge Party.\n\nPoulsom indicates a survival rate of over 45% for Second Arctic Medals, yet several additional medals have survived [and were noted in this review when originally published in 2001. Afterward, Poulsom and Myres' Addenda and Corrigenda Sheet No. 2 showed a survival rate of 49%.]\n\nTurning to the 1904 Polar Medal, which is still issued today, it is pleasing to see many details under the recipients' biographies. Unfortunately, mention is not always made of polar services for which no medal\/clasp was awarded to the individuals. In addition, it is worthy to note that some recipients were awarded military campaign medals for scientific work in vastly different climes. The particularly frustrating thing about the biographies concerns the listing and handling of recipients' medals and artefacts, which in several cases are not mentioned at all.\n\nOddly, the style of noting individuals' awards changed from the First and Second Arctic Medals to the Polar Medal. In the former, the existence of medals is stated in the text, but in the latter, individuals' entitlements are simply noted in the vast majority of cases. Again, as with the Arctic Medals, it would have been so much more meaningful, from a collector's and researcher's point of view, to include various artefacts and documents accompanying the Polar Medals. The omission of this information also damaged the provenance of the items, as does the lack of naming details and styles. There have been excellent published articles on the latter. Finally, the medal rolls do not differentiate clasp only awards (except in one instance) to men who already possessed a Polar Medal.\n\nI have written much about omitted information throughout this review, and in fact, there is wasted space in the book's design, which would have allowed for more information if more thought had been put into this area. For example, in a large number of cases, the information of name, rank\/rate, ship, years served and whether or not the First Arctic Medal was issued, could have been placed on one line and not three lines. Surely abbreviations for ratings could have been made in the medal roll, and the same for clasp entitlements, and silver\/bronze issues for Polar Medal biographies. Also, it was repetitious to print the various Gazette entries, and other authorities, three times\u2014in the section's introduction, the Polar Medal rolls and the biographical listings. The Discovery Investigations' Bronze awards (1925\u201339) could have been condensed down to a couple of pages, with years of service included in brackets after the men's names.\n\nThe next area of concern is the chapter titled \u201cOther Medals and Medallions\u201d. The RGS medallic information is enhanced by a list of recipients of Royal Medals, but remarkably, descriptions of the RGS Special Medals lack any naming data. For medals issued by the United States government, some were issued officially named, but this is only noted in one case. In describing the reverse of the Jeannette Arctic Expedition Medal, the following misleading words appear, \u201c... towards the top, is a space for the recipient's name to be engraved.\u201d, leading one to believe the awards were issued unnamed. The latter is not the case, and I have noted at least two styles of naming for the medal.\n\nTwo notable medals which are mentioned among the First Arctic medal roll biographies are strangely missing from this chapter. They are the Sea Gallantry Medal (Foreign Services) and the Grinnell Medal. Poulsom incorrectly describes the former, under Jefferson Temple Baker's heading, simply as a Sea Gallantry Medal (SGM)\u2014still issued today as a British award for lifesaving, as opposed to the SGM (Foreign Services), which is issued to foreigners for humanity and lifesaving involving British subjects. A special SGM (Foreign Services) was gi... (truncated)",

Beginning with the scrawny, long-horned cattle brought to Mexico by Cortez to feed his soldiers, the herds gradually spread over the grasslands vacated by the buffalo from Texas to Alberta, as well as into British Columbia's Cariboo district and, in recent decades, into the remote Chilcotin region west of Williams Lake.\n\nDudley Witney, while taking photographs for his book with Brendan Gill, Summer Places (McClelland, 1978), became fascinated with the immensity and sculptured beauty of these rangelands. He spent three years visiting many ranches, from the vast Douglas Lake Cattle Company in the Nicola valley of British Columbia to the Buckley family ranch in its lovely Powder River canyon in Wyoming.\n\nIn 108 distinctive colour photographs (fourteen of them double-spreads) and over a hundred black and white, he explores every facet of ranch life. His photographs are of exceptional quality, giving an illusion of texture and depth and great distances, and their arrangement on the pages is interestingly varied.\n\nMoira Johnston, whose reporting expertise has produced feature stories in publications such as National Geographic as well as two books provides the text. A visitor to the Bonaparte Ranch in the Cariboo for over twenty-five years, Johnston extended her background knowledge of ranching with first-hand research. Approximately following Witney's route, she traced by car the old cattle trails from California through Texas and north to Alberta, and finally west to the Chilcotin. By reducing her research to a few representative ranches and personalities, she has sketched the complex history of western ranching up to the present in sixty pages of effortless reading (not counting the informative captions that accompany all the photographs).\n\nThis is a beautiful book, a masterpiece easily worth the price. It has sturdy binding, paper of unusually good quality, and clear, large type, but not so large as to suggest a book for beginning readers. I highly recommend it for public libraries, for pleasure reading in schools, for coffee tables, and for special gift-giving. It is a book that even reluctant readers and people with failing eyesight will enjoy.\n\nGudrun Wight, Faculty of Education, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB.\nline indexes\n\n\n1971-1979 | 1980-1985 | 1986-1990 | 1991-1995\n\n\nThe materials in this archive are copyright \u00a9 The Manitoba Library Association.

        "text":"GANDHI & CHURCHILL by Arthur Herman\n\n\nThe Epic Rivalry That Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age\nEmail this review\n\n\nVeteran historian Herman (To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World, 2004, etc.) offers an ambitious, reasoned joint biography of two great men.\n\nEach was a late-Victorian political figure who continued to lead into the mid-20th century. Each held an exemplary vision for his country that initially and spectacularly prevailed, but ultimately collided with new modern realities. Born to a well-to-do Hindu family in the western province of Gujarati, Mohandas Gandhi (1869\u20131948) was groomed in the English educational system to be a barrister and spent a formative period studying in London. His first experience of racial discrimination was in South Africa, where he worked for the enfranchisement of indentured servants. Winston Churchill (1874\u20131965), son of an aristocrat who was briefly secretary of state for India, inherited his father Randolph\u2019s unshakeable belief in Britain\u2019s imperial mission to the subcontinent. While both Gandhi and Churchill had absorbed the idea of empire as \u201ca moral force, an institution of order and civilization,\u201d Gandhi\u2019s view would change drastically. He gradually repudiated Britain for its criminal subjugation and tyranny, fashioning a new spiritual creed from his deep philosophical readings, during his many jail stints, of Tolstoy, Ruskin and the Bhagavad Gita. Churchill rejected Gandhi\u2019s brand of religious \u201cfanaticism,\u201d which he believed threatened to engulf the civilized Christian world in paganism and darkness. When Gandhi returned to India and joined national politics, he developed his belief in ahimsa (nonviolence) to embrace methods of satyagraha (passive resistance) in order to challenge the Raj\u2019s paternalistic, restrictive policies. Churchill opposed him at every step, passionately rejecting, for example, Viceroy Lord Irwin\u2019s advocacy of\u00a0dominion status for India in 1929. Herman\u2019s measured portrait of each man conveys his entire worldview, shaped by class, history and education. Each proved great and flawed in different ways.\n\nA well-wrought historical narrative that adds significantly to our understanding of both figures.\n\nPub Date:\u00a0May 6th, 2008\nISBN:\u00a0978-0-553-80463-8\nPage count:\u00a0704pp\nPublisher:\u00a0Bantam\nReview Posted Online:\nKirkus Reviews Issue: March\u00a01st,\u00a02008\n\n\nNonfictionINDIA BECOMING by Akash Kapur\nby Akash Kapur\nNonfictionINDIA by Diana L.

        "text":"Kirkus Reviews QR Code\nTHE ROMAN EMPIRE by Martyn Whittock\n\n\nby Martyn Whittock\n\nAge Range: 8 - 12\n\nPub Date: Sept. 1st, 1996\nISBN: 0-87226-118-2\n\n\u0007 This entry in the Biographical History series covers aspects of the beginning and end of the Roman Empire, along with information about daily life when it was at its height. Every two-page spread covers one topic, with a few paragraphs of information, sidebars of primary source material, and a box containing a biography of a related figure. Whittock's excellent introduction is blessed with an intelligent design and layout, and, unlike other books on the subject, has two unusual points to recommend it. First, it takes a thoughtful approach to sources: The first section is an extended explanation of archeological and primary and secondary literary sources. Every section thereafter not only includes photos of and quotes from these sources, along with information about them, but often points out when they are in conflict. Second, the brief biographies give tantalizing glimpses of a large variety of important people. A great start on a complex subject.

Large paperback, 356 pages, $34.95. Please support by buying this program from our Christian Book Distributors link.\n\nBilling itself as \"a complete geography resource for grades K-12,\" The Ultimate Geography and Timeline Guide is a huge compendium of information designed as a parents or teachers guide to make geography interesting and fun. While both authors are homeschooling parents, this resource guide frequently addresses classroom situations but almost all of the activities can be easily adapted for home use.\n\nThe authors begin with a friendly introduction of tips and commonly asked questions followed by a \"yearly guide for the less than confident,\" recommended pages to complete based upon the childs age. Six units follow.\n\n\"Just the Basics, Please!\" is the first unit. \"Planning Your Destination,\" chapter one, includes some information about how to go about unit studies, learning styles, and some of the supplies needed (maps, globes, atlases, etc.) for geography studies. The authors discuss in detail the importance of a student-created notebook and the impact this technique can have on the learning process. In chapter 2, \"Packing Your Bags: A Refresher Course,\" the authors provide a concise, yet detailed, overview of terms and concepts of not only physical geography but also the less frequently considered \"human geography\" that concerns itself with races, languages, religion, culture, and the like. This chapter ends with a discussion of the five themes of geography (location, place, relationships, movement, regions) and how they make geography much more than simply where places are located. In the final chapter of this unit, \"Finding Your Way with Maps,\" facts about maps and different types of maps are explained.\n\nThe next unit is called \"Taking in the Sights: Fun and Games.\" Creative ways to get started or to add interest to geography studies are introduced. Foreign stamps and money, foreign exchange students, and pen pals are some of the ideas. Numerous home-made games are suggested along with cooking activities and an archaeological dig in the form of cookies with nuts and raisins.\n\nUnit three, \"Across the Great Divide, Geography Through the Curriculum,\" includes suggestions for integrating geography with the other subjects of science, math, history, computer (via the internet), and literature. A complete unit study for learning about Holland using Hans Brinker or The Silver Skates by Mary Mapes Dodge illustrates how to bring geography into literature study.\n\n\"Just Geography,\" unit four, contains material for students to \"conquer the continents.\" One chapter offers a survey of all the continents with mapping exercises and questions for late elementary and middle school aged children, while the following chapter has a somewhat more rigorous survey of the continents for high schoolers.\n\nReproducibles are available in unit five. Eighteen maps of continents, the world, ancient civilizations, and more are included along with fifteen activity sheets and several planning sheets for the teacher. Flash cards with geography terms and small blocks of \"stuff to know by heart\" such as longest rivers, largest islands, and most populous countries, are also in this section.\n\nUnit six, \"Tour Through Time: Timelines,\" begins with an explanation of how helpful timelines can be in gaining an understanding of when events occurred. Many different activities and methods for making timelines are suggested. A reproducible notebook page for the timeline and over 300 timeline figures are provided. \"Who Am I?\" game cards may also be reproduced to create an interesting quiz on events, people, and landmarks in history. About 150 cards are included, and several blanks are provided so that the family may make more.\n\nThe appendix has a glossary, the answer key, a chronological listing of timeline figures, an index of the timeline figures and \"Who Am I?\" cards, and an index for the book.\n\nRecommendation: The Ultimate Geography and Timeline Guide is an incredible resource of materials for teaching geography. While it does not provide day by day guidance for the teacher, it is full of ideas to make geography interesting and FUN. (See the review of Trail Guide to World Geography if you are seeking a more structured program.) A creative homeschooling parent who enjoys planning her own activities will find this book to be invaluable. resources related to this review:'s Geography Section for interesting ideas and resources!\nReview of Geography Songs\nReview of Geography Through Art\nReview of Trail Guide to World Geography\nReview of Hands-On Geography\nReview of Eat Your Way Geography Cookbook Series\nReview of Uncle Josh's Outline Maps\nReview of A Child's Geography\nReview of Hold That Thought Note booking and timeline products\n\nFind more helpful reviews on's Review Page Index!\n\nReviews represent the opinions of the authors rather than the views of",

        "text":"Joan of Arc\n\nJoan of Arc: A Spiritual Biography\n\u00a9 1998 Siobhan Nash-Marshall\n176 pages\n\nIn 1429, France in her darkest hour was startled by the sudden appearance of a shining star \u2014 a teenage girl from a minor village, wielding a standard and claiming that God had ordered her to \u00a0lead the nation to victory. The Hundred Years War, \u00a0the long struggle between the French and English nobility over Guyenne, Normandy, and the French crown, had left France seemingly nothing but a lost dream. \u00a0France had no leader; her last king had gone mad, his queen denounced the heir, and now civil war between the Dukes of Orleans and Valois paved the way for English triumph. But Joan answered the call, raised an army, and within twenty years the war was over. She is one of the most remarkable characters in European history, and this brief biography is a highly complimentary if slightly restrained story of her life. \u00a0Though it avoids being too mythical \u2014 the author discounts stories of animals sounding off in happiness at her birth, and does not attempt to make her out to be a poor peasant girl when her father was a fairly well-established landowner \u2014 \u00a0it avoids being critical as well. The voices and the miracles attributed to Joan \u2014 her foresight in ordering men to move a bit to the left so they wouldn\u2019t be stricken by a cannonball, her raising an infant to life long enough to be baptized so its wee soul would be saved, and not linger in limbo \u2014 are repeated here, without either affirmation or skepticism. \u00a0[Author]\u2019s focus is on Joan\u2019s drive and intelligence, \u00a0whpch imparted courage to the French people and struck a blow to build a victory upon. Even when in the custody of her enemies, assailed and jeered at by a hostile court, she maintained \u00a0the presence \u00a0of mind and the strength of spirit to deliver enigmatic answers that mocked their wrath \u2014 \u00a0the fury of a band of warriors, priests, and kings focused on a teenage girl. \u00a0[Author] provides solid context, however, demonstrating how the Hundred Years War was less an English invasion of France, and more of a French civil war, and an exercise of feudal peculiarities in which the English king was a vassal to the French king, despite legitimately controlling more of France (through inheritance and marriage) than le roi himself. \u00a0It\u2019s not the strongest of biographies, but delivers a feeling of Joan that is saintly, strong, and sweet.\n\nJoan of Arc: Legend and Reality, Frances Gies\n\nAbout smellincoffee\n\nCitizen, librarian, reader with a boundless wonder for the world and a curiosity about all the beings inside it.\nThis entry was posted in history, Reviews and tagged , , , , , .

Through deft depictions of personalities, clearly explained events, and colorful sidelights, this excellent history paints a vivid picture of U.S. Navy officer Matthew Perry's historic diplomatic mission.\n\n\nIs it any good?\n\nRhoda Blumberg's lucid writing, immediate in tone and easily accessible to bright youngsters, springs from deep knowledge and research.\u00a0Had they landed on another planet in 1853, Americans could scarcely have encountered a culture more alien to their own than that of 19th century feudal Japan.\u00a0Blumberg brings this strangeness to life, spelled out in such details as banquet menus, table manners, and jarringly different social customs. Blumberg has produced a thorough treatment of a little-known but pivotal event in world history.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, the grace of her approach is undermined by the book's poor picture quality. Although the pictures are well chosen and fascinating, they often are poorly reproduced. Even so, beguiled by tales of samurais excitedly riding a toy railroad bestowed by the Americans, of Dutchmen made to jump and dance to amuse the shogun's court, of the Japanese fashion for black-painted teeth, young history hounds will eagerly gobble up this excellent account.\n\nTalk to your kids about ...\n\n  \u2022 Families can talk about unfamiliar cultures.

        "text":"Review | The Origins of Great Ancient Civilizations \u2013 Kenneth W. Harl\n\nAbout the Book\n\nLocales like Mesopotamia or the Indus Valley, peoples like the Hittites or Assyrians, or rulers like Sargon, Hammurabi, and Darius are part of a long-dead antiquity, so shrouded with dust that we might be tempted to skip over them entirely, preferring to race forward along history\u2019s timeline in search of the riches we know will be found in our studies of Greece and Rome.\n\nBut, according to Professor Harl, these civilizations, \u201cact as the cultural basis for many of the civilizations that will emerge on the Eurasian landmass and will dictate the destinies of many of the people living today on the globe.\u201d These remote, ancient civilizations stand behind the traditions of Greece, so it is critical to understand these great societies in order to better understand those that would come later \u2013 including our own.\n\nThese 12 fast-paced lectures cover many civilizations that may only receive a few lines of cursory discussion in the average Western civilization textbook. Beginning in the Bronze Age and the emergence of urban-based literate civilizations, the story continues through the demise of Persia\u2019s great empire at the hands of the Greeks.\n\nAlong the way, you\u2019ll examine advances such as the invention and evolution of writing, the development of vast empires dependent not only on military might but on laws and administration, the growth of trade, and the contributions of the Hebrews to the religious and ethical future of Western civilization.\n\nHistory lovers will appreciate this course for its deep insights and its rock-solid foundation for deeper exploration.\u00a0\n\nThe lectures you get are:\u00a0\n\nCradles of civilization\nFirst cities of Sumer\nMesopotamian kings and scribes\nHammurabi\u2019s Babylon\nEgypt in the pyramid age\nThe Middle Kingdom\nImperial Egypt\nNew peoples of the Bronze Age\nThe collapse of the Bronze Age\u00a0\nFrom Hebrews to Jews\nImperial Assyria\nThe Persian Empire\n\nCheck out the Great Courses Plus here\nLecture on Audible here\n\nI don\u2019t know a whole lot about ancient civilizations. In fact, I\u2019d say I mostly just know the highlights and like, pyramids and stuff. It isn\u2019t that this isn\u2019t an interesting topic, but I\u2019ve never really found it that accessible and so I\u2019ve always avoided it. I think I tend to gravitate toward more modern era things because they are easier for me to understand and I can see the direct impacts playing out on the world stage even now.\u00a0\n\nSo, yeah. Ancient civilizations have never been my bag. However, I recently jumped on a Great Courses Plus sale, and I saw this lecture series and thought, \u201cwhy not.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve heard a lot about Kenneth W. Harl, and his courses seem to have good ratings, so I figured this might be a good place for me to start. Now, this really is just an overview. There are twelve lectures, and a whole lot is covered in those twelve lectures. It worked for me, because it broke down important civilizations and developments and got my feet wet so I knew what I wanted to read as further research later. It also put me on a complete and absolute ancient history bing-fest with my books, so that\u2019s a mark in its favour.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t typically enjoy overviews, but for something like this, I actually really appreciated it. Adding the video to these lectures was a really great thing to do, as it helped me to see the maps of trade routes in Sumer, for example, and movements in Egypt and the rise and fall of other dynasties and peoples who didn\u2019t really make sense to me unless I saw their rough locations on a map. It also helped to see some of the artwork and examples of writing and what have you as he was talking. Learning about cuneiform is one thing, but seeing cuneiform while you learn about it is quite another.\u00a0\n\nThis lecture series is available on Audible, but unless you\u2019re terribly familiar with terms and locations and etc, then you will probably want to google maps and etc as you listen. I also think the Audible lectures come with PDFs, so that might be a good option as well.\u00a0\n\nYour mileage may vary as you listen to this lecture series. People who are more familiar with this topic and time period will likely find a lot of information they already know, and not much that is new. Also, he doesn\u2019t really have enough time to deep dive into any of the civilizations and dynasties he covers, so if you aren\u2019t one who enjoys summaries of important facts and events, then this might frustrate you more than enlighten you.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, this was basically exactly what I needed: an overview of important events, and a ton of new information delivered in a succinct way, by a professor who is intensely familiar with the topic in which he is teaching. Were their parts I wished he\u2019d spent more time on? Yes. However, he gave me the foundation I needed to know what books I wanted to read to learn even more, and he taught me a whole lot that I didn\u2019t know, or had forgotten since my art history days in college.\u00a0\n\nI think my favorite parts of this were the parts touching on ancient Sumerians and their early cities, specifically the hows and whys of how writing came to be, and the first social stratification and the rise of kings and the like. Talk about something I literally knew less than nothing about, the lectures on that area and that period of time blew me away and now I\u2019ve got a whole bunch of books loaded up on my kindle that cover ancient Mesopotamian civilizations. I found the parts on Egypt to be where my mind wandered the most, and I really currently want to know a lot more about the Bronze Age and the Persian Empire.\n\nSo while I do think that your mileage may vary depending on how interested you are in this topic and how much you already know, for me, this was exactly what I was looking for. I appreciated the professor\u2019s knowledgeable delivery of information, and his ability to present succinct overviews without making me feel like I was just getting the highlights. Perhaps the highest mark of favor I could give this lecture series, is the fact that it\u2019s made me want to learn more.\u00a0\n\nThe only real thing that keeps me from giving this a full five stars is the fact that this series is kind of dated, and I almost wish he\u2019d made an updated series of lectures. I do wonder what new information has been found, if any.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of ancient history, and the Great Courses, you should really check this one out.\u00a0\n\n4\/5 stars\n\n2 Responses\n\n  \u2022 I think the trouble I would have listening to history lectures is that they remind me of those audio tours you get when you visit a castle. I always tune out after the first three minutes and that\u2019s when I\u2019m standing in a frickin\u2019 castle.\n\n    I think you\u2019re probably right that an overview is a good way to whet your appetite and then you can delve into deeper research yourself if you are intrigued, but there is such a variety of topics here that it feels like you\u2019d never settle down to one era being you had moved on to the next.\n\n  \u2022 Astra\n\n    I love Kenneth Harl. I\u2019ve listened to all of his lectures. He definitely goes into more detail on many of the others.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

        "text":"Driven: A Photobiography of Henry Ford\n\nDriven: A Photobiography of Henry Ford\n\nBy: Don Mitchell\nPublisher: National Geographic Children's Books\nPublication Date: May 2010\nISBN: 978-1426301551\nReviewed by: Deb Fowler\nReview Date: June 15, 2010\n\nHenry Ford was one of those youngsters who was fascinated by anything that ticked. He was obsessed by the mechanical workings of pocket watches and windup toys and his brothers and sisters had to be on the lookout or he would have them apart trying to figure out how they worked. There was one thing that separated him from most in that he \"usually could put them back together again.\" The obsession with anything mechanical never waned. Not long after his mother was lost in childbirth, a devastating loss for such a young man, twelve-year-old Henry spotted \"A steam engine [that] was traveling along the road under its own power.\" This amazing sight was more than enough to capture his imagination for a lifetime.\n\nLater, when he invented his quadricycle, people simply considered him to be an odd duck and called him \"Crazy Henry.\" He was far from crazy and many others were amazed by his talents. He was having trouble breaking into the automobile industry, but while others were experimenting with an electrical \"horseless carriage,\" he was experimenting with a gas-powered vehicle. When this was pointed out to Thomas Edison, a lifetime friendship was born when he shouted out, \"Young man, that's the thing: you have it. Keep at it . . . Your car is self-contained--it carries its own power plant--no fire, no boiler, no smoke and no steam. You have the thing. Keep at it.\" And that he did.\n\nIn this book you will get a glimpse at the life of a man who was determined that the automobile would shift from being a \"luxury item for the well-to-do to a necessity for the average American.\" You'll learn about his family life, the formation of his company, the manufacture of the Model T, the creation of the innovative assembly line, how he shared his good fortune with his employees (the $5.00 day), you'll learn about his \"Peace Ship,\" his brief political career, his commitment to the \"broader community,\" his pacifism, his biases, and much more. Did you know that he hired African Americans during \"a time of great racial discrimination\"?\n\nThis is an excellent photobiography of Henry Ford, a man who \"believed in equal opportunity\" long before it was popular. It will not take long for the reader to become totally immersed in this excellent biography. There are numerous photographs, many that I've never seen, that simply speak for themselves. The amazing advances in technology began with the likes of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, two close friends who challenged each other with their work. This biography not only gives an overview of Henry's \"automobile\" life, but also gives the reader a feel for his personality. In the back of the book is an index and additional recommended book and web site resources to explore.\n\nQuill says:\u00a0Driven: A Photobiography of Henry Ford\u00a0is an excellent resource for the pre-teen (ages 9-12) reader.\n\nFeathered Quill\n\nDisclosure in Accordance with FTC Guidelines 16 CFR Part 255\n\nCopyrights \u00a9 2020 Feathered Quill Reviews All Rights Reserved. | Designed & Developed by",

        "text":"\u201cOur family was very pleased with how extremely detailed the genealogy report was and how it was broken down into segments and backed up by reliable documentation.\u00a0 The information obtained by \u201cOld Bones Genealogy\u201d \u00a0has spurred us on to follow up on some detective work of our own. \u00a0Additionally the information collected gave an insight into a side of the family that we never knew and that was the best part of our discovery.\u201d\n\nDennis F., Maryland\n\n\u201cA friend of mine, an older woman who is a \u201cshut-in,\u201d asked me to help her with some questions she had about her grandparents, and great-grand parents. All she knew were their names (with some uncertainty) and general geographic locations. She wanted to find out more about their lives, livelihood and parentage, and where they might be buried.\n\u201cI went to Eileen for help. When Eileen was done, I was able to give my friend, as a Christmas present, a presentation grade, well organized, binder that completely answered her questions and filled in other information that she and her brother never knew about their family. It was a professional effort that my friend has told me numerous times is a source of much pleasure and satisfaction. According to her, it is now a family treasure. We were also able to visit her grandparents\u2019 graves as she had so hoped to do.\u201d\nJohn M. Davidson\n\n\n\u201cWhen investigating our genealogical history I believe most of us hope for a bit of a surprise. Something we don\u2019t know and haven\u2019t guessed about our heritage. The key to these discoveries is diligent research and analysis. In these areas Old Bones Genealogy excels. For me, I was presented with several interesting surprises. Things that the casual researcher would not have discovered. The final package I received contained all that I requested (and surprises) and included the proof and critical documentation, in a well-organized, easy to reference package. I had an altogether rewarding experience with Old Bones Genealogy. And that too, was a pleasant surprise.\u201d\n\nWilliam L., Baltimore, MD\n\n\n\u201cThe William Elder Descendants Association has used the services of Old Bones Genealogy in the past and will do so in the future. Eileen Souza\u2019s work is timely, accurate, and done with great passion. Having met with Eileen on a number of occasions she is also knowledgeable, insightful, and diligent. Her transcription work for us was first rate, careful and beautifully presented.\u201d\n\nTim Gallagher President\nThe William Elder of Maryland Descendants Association, Inc.\n\nClick here to view the areas that we specialize in\n\nProfessional Genealogy Areas We Specialize In:\n\n  \u2022 Baltimore City Genealogy Services\n  \u2022 Baltimore County Genealogy Services: Catonsville (21228), Cockeysville (21030), Homeland (21212), Lutherville (21093), Monkton (21111), Mount Washington (21209), Owings Mills (21117), Parkton (21120), Phoenix (21131), Pikesville (21208), Randalstown (21133), Reisterstown (21136), Roland Park (21210), Ruxton (21204), Timonium (21204), Towson (21204, 21286), Upperco (21155), Woodstock (21163).\n  \u2022 Carroll County Genealogy Services: Eldersburg (21784), Finksburg (21048), Hampstead (21074), Marriottsville (21104), Mount Airy (21771), New Windsor (21776), Sykesville (21784), Union Bridge (21791), Westminster (21157, 21158), Woodbine (21797)\n  \u2022 Frederick County Genealogy Services: Adamstown (21710), Ballenger Creek (21703), Braddock Heights (21714), Brunswick (21716), Buckeystown (21717), Burkittsville (21718), Clover Hill (21702), Discovery-Spring Garden (21793), Emmitsburg (21727), Frederick, Graceham (21788), Green Valley (21770), Ijamsville (21754), Jefferson (21755), Konxville (21758), Ladiesburg (21759), Lewistown (21701), Libertytown (21762), Lake Linganore (21774), Linganore-Bartonsville (21774, 21704), Middletown (21769), Monrovia (21770), Mt Airy (21771), Myersville (21773), New Market (21774), New Midway(21775), Petersville, Point of Rocks (21777), Rocky Ridge (21778), Rosemont (21758), Savillasville(21780), Sunny Side, Thurmont (21788), Tuscarora (21790), Urbana (21704), Utica, Walkersville (21793), Wolfsville (21773), Woodsboro (21798)\n  \u2022 Howard County Genealogy Services: Columbia (21044, 21045, 21046), Clarksville (21029), Cooksville (21723), Dayton (21036), Ellicott City (21042, 21043), Fulton (20759), Glenelg (21737), Glenwood (21738), Highland (20777), Marriottsville (21104), West Friendship (21784), Woodbine (21797).",

        "text":"Slavery on trial in the oregon territory\n\nOverland Journal: Reviews from the Trail\n\nBy Roger Blair\n\nIn the span of a year, three Oregon authors wrote books about Oregon Trail pioneers who brought slaves to Oregon and the efforts of those slaves to gain freedom for themselves or their loved ones.\n\nTwo of those books, Jane Kirkpatrick\u2019s A Light in the Wilderness (2014) and Phillip Margolin\u2019s Worthy Brown\u2019s Daughter (2014), are fiction based upon actual events.\n\nThe third, R. Gregory Nokes\u2019s Breaking Chains (2013), is non-fiction and discusses the events fictionalized in the other two. Nokes carefully discusses the background leading up to the 1852 trial of Nathaniel Ford\u2019s slave Robin Holmes versus Ford to gain the promised, but unfulfilled, freedom of Holmes\u2019s children. This background includes the history of Oregon\u2019s lure; the land laws and laws against blacks in Oregon whether free or slaves; and other black history in Oregon before 1852. Using previously published\u00a0sources and Ford family history, the author describes Ford\u2019s 1844 wagon train over the Oregon Trail. He then goes on to cover Ford\u2019s and Holmes\u2019s settlement in Polk County, and Ford\u2019s involvement in establishing the Applegate Trail, also called the Southern Route.\n\nThe bulk of the book covers the unique trial in 1852 when Holmes sued for and won the freedom of his children, whom Ford had refused to surrender as promised. The trial is detailed from actual court records, the only slavery case to be decided in an Oregon court.\n\nNokes goes on to discuss the stories of other blacks in Oregon during the Oregon Trail era, including one person brought over by his ancestors. The author states that his interest in this story started with a mention of slaves in his own family genealogy. He is a direct descendant of 1853 emigrants, including one who brought a slave to Oregon from Kentucky. Nokes, of West Linn, Oregon, was a reporter for the Associated Press and editor of The Oregonian newspaper. Nokes includes two quotes in his prologue to explain the purpose of writing this book. The first, from Darrell Millner, professor of black studies at Portland State University, says \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t necessarily apply today\u2019s standards to events of the past. But we shouldn\u2019t hide our past either.\u201d\n\nThe second, from Nokes, says \u201cIf I were in school again, I would want to understand the real history of our state, not a sanitized version that misleads us into myths and misplaced self-satisfaction. We can learn from our past. We should.\u201d This reviewer very much agrees.",

But its careful and exhaustive research makes the book an excellent reference for historians and those seeking specific information on the history of the Irish in the West.\u00a0\n\nBy Phil Dougherty,\u00a0May 15, 2011\n\nSubmitted: 5\/14\/2011\n\nLicensing: This essay is licensed under a Creative Commons license that encourages reproduction with attribution.
