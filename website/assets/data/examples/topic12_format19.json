Arthroplasty consists in disconnecting the joint extremities, modeling new joint surfaces, and placing between them layers of the patient\u2019s tissue (skin or fascia). Caps of cartilage or fetal membrane (amnion) are also used. Preserved joint extremities (homohemijoints) or whole joints (homojoints) taken from corpses, artificial joint heads of plastic or metal (for example, the head of the femur in arthroplasty of the hip joint), and artificial joints (for example, metallic prostheses of the hip joint or of finger joints) are widely used.
