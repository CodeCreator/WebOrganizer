        "text":"Endophenotype, Molecular Genetic Study on Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder\n\nThe recruitment status of this study is unknown because the information has not been verified recently.\nVerified December 2009 by National Taiwan University Hospital.\nRecruitment status was\u00a0 Recruiting\nNational Science Council, Taiwan\nInformation provided by:\nNational Taiwan University Hospital\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:\nFirst received: September 13, 2007\nLast updated: December 14, 2009\nLast verified: December 2009\n\nThe ultimate goals of this study are to identify patterns of familial aggregation with regards to categorical and dimensional approaches of ADHD and neuropsychological measures, to validate the phenotypes and endophenotypes that are close to biological expression of genders underlying ADHD, and to identify the genetic variants close to the etiological genes of ADHD in Taiwanese sample. We propose to replicate the analysis of the candidate genes identified by previous genetic studies on ADHD using the candidate gene association study design (family-based case control study using parental controls) to validate the findings from other research groups. With the accomplishment of these goals, this study will resolve controversies over inconsistent findings in previous genetic studies and contribute to the literature on the validity of ASD using clinical and genetic data.\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n\nStudy Type: Observational\nStudy Design: Observational\u00a0Model:\u00a0Family-Based\nOfficial Title: Endophenotype, Molecular Genetic Study on Attention-deficit\/ Hyperactivity Disorder\n\nResource links provided by NLM:\n\nFurther study details as provided by National Taiwan University Hospital:\n\nBiospecimen Retention: \u00a0 Samples With DNA\n\nThe subjects will receive blood withdrawal. The blood sample will be used for establishing lymphoblastoid cell lines, which will be used for molecular genetic experiments\n\nEstimated Enrollment: 200\nStudy Start Date: August 2007\nEstimated Study Completion Date: August 2010\nDetailed Description:\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, is an early onset, highly heritable, clinically heterogeneous, long-term impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies. It affects 5-10% of school-aged children worldwide (7.5% in Taiwan) and 2-4% of adults. Neuropsychological deficits related to executive functions, state regulation, and delay aversion show heritability, replicated association with ADHD, and familial-genetic overlap with ADHD, are suitable for biomarkers for ADHD. Despite the abundance of molecular genetic studies on ADHD, the genetic etiologies of ADHD have been non-conclusive, and there is limited information about the expressions, endophenotypes, and genetic variants for ADHD in Chinese population. This polite study, a family-based parental control association study, aims to identify the genetic markers for ADHD using the dichotomous categorization of affected and non-affected, quantitative phenotypes (symptoms dimension and severity of ADHD) and endophenotype (neuropsychological measures) as well.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\n  1. to determine the components of ADHD and neuropsychological deficit with the greatest familial recurrence risks;\n  2. to replicate studies with positive genetic findings from literature by performing candidate gene analysis such as DRD4, DAT1, DRD5, HTR1B, SNPA-25, 5-HTT, DBH, CHRNA4, CHRNA7 etc;\n  3. to identify the potential genetic variants using haplotype tag SNPs for the following candidate genes, CHRNA4 and CHRNA7 and any updated genetic findings.\n\nWe will recruit 200 probands with ADHD, aged 7-18, and their parents (n = 400) and siblings (n= 150) in three years (50, 100, and 50 families with ADHD in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year, respectively). The measures include (1) interviews for psychopathology (K-SADS-E) and social functioning (SAICA), (2) self-administered questionnaires to measures ADHD symptoms (CPRS-R:S, CTRS-R:S, SNAP-IV and Adult ADHD rating scale) and comorbid conditions (ASRI and CBCL), and (3) Neuropsychological tests: WISC-III, CPT, CANTAB, and Time Perception Tasks. The DNA will be collected and analyzed. The transmission\/disequilibrium test (TDT) and quantitative TDT will be used in data analysis.\n\nWe anticipate the establishment of clinical, neuropsychological, and genetic database of 200 ADHD families, completion of the screening of several candidate genes, and identification of potential genetic variants for ADHD, and determination of their association with ADHD diagnosis and symptoms and its endophenotype in a Taiwanese sample. The long-term objectives are to identify the behavioral phenotypes and endophenotypes that are close to the biological expression of genes underlying ADHD. The findings of different approaches to identify the genetic etiologies for ADHD in this pilot study should help us to determine the most promising approach for future molecular genetic study on ADHD.\n\n\nAges Eligible for Study: \u00a0 7 Years to 18 Years\nGenders Eligible for Study: \u00a0 Both\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers: \u00a0 No\nSampling Method: \u00a0 Non-Probability Sample\nStudy Population\n\nThe sample will consist of 200 children and adolescents with ADHD, aged 7-18.\n\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nThe inclusion criteria for the proband subjects are\n\n  \u2022 (1) that subjects have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD, or Hyperkinetic Disorder (HD) defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10, respectively, which was made by a full-time board-certificated child psychiatrist at the first visit and following visits;\n  \u2022 (2) their ages range from 7 to 18 when we conduct the study;\n  \u2022 (3) subjects have at least one biological parent;\n  \u2022 (4) both parents are Han Chinese; and\n  \u2022 (5) subjects and their biological parents (and siblings if any) consent to participate in this study for complete phenotype assessments and blood withdraw or saliva collection for genetic study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n  \u2022 The proband subjects will be excluded from the study if they currently meet criteria or have a history of the following condition as defined by DSM-IV:\n  \u2022 Shizophrenia,\n  \u2022 Schizoaffective Disorder,\n  \u2022 Organic Psychosis, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder.\n  \u2022 Moreover, the subjects will also be excluded from the study if they completely cannot cooperate with blood withdrawal, collection of saliva, or buccal swabs.\n\u00a0 Contacts and Locations\nChoosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Have you ever had a mammogram?\" and \"How long has it been since you had your last mammogram?\"\n  \u2022 \u00a0In 2011, two methodological refinements were made to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The first was to expand the sample to include data received from cell phone users. This change was made to reflect the population better. The second change was to modify the statistical method to weight BRFSS survey data. The new approach simultaneously adjusts survey respondent data to known proportions of demographics such as age, race and ethnicity, and gender. Prior to 2011, the weighting method was post stratification, while in 2011 it is raking. Raking is better able to account for more demographic characteristics and multiple sampling frames. Because of these changes, data collected in 2011 and later cannot be appropriately compared to previous data, although new results should better reflect the health status of the United States (see {link:60739}).\n\n    In order to create multi-year estimates, two changes were made to the new data. First, respondents who only have cell phones were removed. Second, weights were created specifically for this purpose using the post stratification method. Those two changes make the 2011 data similar to the pre-2011 data and allowed multi-year estimates to be created, even though these estimates will not be as representative of the U.S. population as the single-year estimates using 2011 data without these changes.\n\n    Efforts to create a new small area estimate methodology that will allow use all of the improvements instigated with the 2011 data are currently taking place.

The survey was established in 1984. Data are collected monthly in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin islands, and Guam.\n\n    MethodologyData collection is conducted separately by each state. The design uses state-level, random digit dialed probability samples of the adult (aged 18 and older) population. All projects use a disproportionate stratified sample design except for Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands who use a simple random sample design. The questionnaire consists of three parts: (1) a core component of questions used by all states, which includes questions on demographics, and current health-related conditions and behaviors; (2) optional CDC modules on specific topics (e.g., cardiovascular disease, arthritis), that states may elect to use; and (3) state-added questions, developed by states for their own use. The state-added questions are not edited or evaluated by CDC. Interviews are generally conducted using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) systems. Data are weighted for noncoverage and nonresponse.\n\n\nDriving Walking\/Biking Public Transit \u00a0Get Directions",
