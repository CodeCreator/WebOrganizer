It won't be a surprise that Chinese Yuan would start its globalization process, as indicated by the bond issuance this August in Hong Kong. It will be an important issue to discuss whether the\u00a0 Chinese Yuan has its ability and capacity to be one of the world's main reserve currency, or even the world's leading currency. This essay will firstly discuss the development of the Chinese Yuan worldwide in the past few years, which would explain the temptation behind for the Chinese Yuan to be the world leading currency. Following this, further analysis would be implemented to demonstrate why it is not practical to replace the US Dollar to be the world's leading currency in the short-term. Finally, opportunities will be thoroughly analyzed to demonstrate the current situation that Beijing is facing. A dilemma would be disclosed, as the Chinese Yuan is facing its temptations, challenges and opportunities on the way to be the world's leading currency.\n\nFrom Chinese Yuan to World's currency: the temptation implicated in globalization\nThe first step of the Chinese Yuan's globalization has been made eventually, under the enormous temptation to go to the world. It is common for the China's Ministryof Finance to issue bonds in the mainland, but not common in Hong Kong, especially in its own currency, the Chinese Yuan. This event has been much notable for its size, which is nearly 20 billion Yuan. As another important remarkable event for Chinese Yuan, a notification was issued by the State Department of Commerce at October 15, which clearly marks that the Foreign Direct Investment in Chinese Yuan has been approved by the authorities. These two remarkable events have declared the globalization of the Chinese Yuan has been officially started. Hong Kong, the former colony of the British, has been assigned to be the first location to promote this ambitious program(Lingling Wei, 2011). After the Beijing Olympic Games, people worldwide have been some kind familiar with the Chinese people, as well as its currency. Now the subprime mortgage crisis hasn't been eliminated completely, the USD has been continuously weakening, so it is a chance to start the globalization of Chinese Yuan at this time. But the most important motivation for the Chinese Yuan to go to the world is the benefit from globalization. The globalization of a currency would ease the inflation pressure within its nation, and furthermore, would take advantage of the natural resources all over the world. That is exactly what the U.S. government has been doing for more than half century.\n\nChallenge the USD: mission impossible in the short term(\u8d23\u4efb\u7f16\u8f91\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed\u8bba\u6587\u4ee3\u5199)\n\nUK Thesis Base Contacts\n\nEurope \uff0824-hours\uff09\nchina \uff0824-hours\uff09\n\u5168\u5929\u501924\u5c0f\u65f6\u5728\u7ebf\u5ba2\u670d QQ:1455780998",

        "text":"Financial Regulation:\n\nA Framework for Crafting and Assessing Proposals to Modernize the Outdated U.S. Financial Regulatory System\n\nGAO-09-349T: Published: Feb 4, 2009. Publicly Released: Feb 4, 2009.\n\nAdditional Materials:\n\n\nOrice M. Williams\n(202) 512-5837\n\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n(202) 512-4800\n\nThis testimony discusses our January 8, 2009, report that provides a framework for modernizing the outdated U.S. financial regulatory system. We prepared this work under the authority of the Comptroller General to help policymakers weigh various regulatory reform proposals and consider ways in which the current regulatory system could be made more effective and efficient. This testimony is based on our report, which (1) describes how regulation has evolved in banking, securities, thrifts, credit unions, futures, insurance, secondary mortgage markets and other important areas; (2) describes several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades that have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system; and (3) presents an evaluation framework that can be used by Congress and others to shape potential regulatory reform efforts. On January 22, we released an update to our biennial High-Risk Series, which described high-risk areas in federal programs, including by focusing on the need for broad-based transformations to address major economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges. Based on recent economic events and our past work on financial regulatory reform, we added the need to modernize the outdated U.S. financial regulatory system as a new high-risk area this year.\n\nThe current U.S. financial regulatory system has relied on a fragmented and complex arrangement of federal and state regulators--put into place over the past 150 years--that has not kept pace with major developments in financial markets and products in recent decades. Today, almost a dozen federal regulatory agencies, numerous self-regulatory organizations, and hundreds of state financial regulatory agencies share responsibility for overseeing the financial services industry. As the nation finds itself in the midst of one of the worst financial crises ever, it has become apparent that the regulatory system is ill-suited to meet the nation's needs in the 21st century. Summary Several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system. First, regulators have struggled, and often failed, to mitigate the systemic risks posed by large and interconnected financial conglomerates and to ensure they adequately manage their risks. Second, regulators have had to address problems in financial markets resulting from the activities of large and sometimes less-regulated market participants--such as nonbank mortgage lenders, hedge funds, and credit rating agencies--some of which play significant roles in today's financial markets. Third, the increasing prevalence of new and more complex investment products has challenged regulators and investors, and consumers have faced difficulty understanding new and increasingly complex retail mortgage and credit products. Fourth, standard setters for accounting and financial regulators have faced growing challenges in ensuring that accounting and audit standards appropriately respond to financial market developments, and in addressing challenges arising from the global convergence of accounting and auditing standards. Finally, as financial markets have become increasingly global, the current fragmented U.S. regulatory structure has complicated some efforts to coordinate internationally with other regulators. These significant developments have outpaced a fragmented and outdated regulatory structure, and, as a result, significant reforms to the U.S. regulatory system are critically and urgently needed. The current system has significant weaknesses that, if not addressed, will continue to expose the nation's financial system to serious risks.\n\nFeb 15, 2018\n\nJan 31, 2018\n\nNov 16, 2017\n\nNov 15, 2017\n\nNov 9, 2017\n\nLooking for more?

Our model specification enables as to capture the unobserved dynamics of the systematic risk premia in the bond market. In order to estimate the dimensionality of the hidden risk factors jointly with the model parameters, we rely on a modified version of the iterated least squares method proposed by Bai, Kao, and Ng (2009). Our result confirms the presence of four common risk components affecting the U.S. corporate bonds during the period between September 2006 and March 2008. However, one single risk factor is sufficient to describe the data for all time periods prior to mid July 2007 when the subprime crisis was detected in the financial market. The dimensionality of the unobserved risk components therefore seems to reflect the degree of difficulty to diversify the individual bond risks.\nCorporate Bond\nCredit Spread\nSystematic Risk Premium\nPanel Data Model with Interactive Fixed Effects\nFactor Analysis\nDimensionality Criteria\nPanel Cointegration\nDocument Type:\u00a0\nWorking Paper\n\nFiles in This Item:\n\nItems in EconStor are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.",

Survival measure, which was first introduced by Schonbucher [12] in the framework of defaultable LMM, has the advantage of eliminating default indicator variable directly from the expectation by absorbing it into Randon-Nikodym density process. Survival measure approach was further extended by Collin-Duresne[4] to avoid calculating a troublesome jump in IBPR reduced-form model. This paper considers survival measure in \"HBPR\" model, i.e. default time is characterized by Cox construction, and studies the relevant drift changes and martingale representations. This paper also takes advantage of survival measure to solve the looping default problem in interacting intensity model with stochastic intensities. Guaranteed debt is priced under this model, as an application of survival measure and interacting intensity model. Detailed numerical analysis is performed in this paper to study influence of stochastic pre-default intensities and contagion on value of a two firms' bilateral guaranteed debt portfolio.\n\n    Download Info\n\n    If you experience problems downloading a file, check if you have the proper application to view it first.

The research design is built upon one important accounting intuition: as earnings are aggregated over longer intervals, the effect of earnings measurement error and the time lag between earnings recognition and market reaction slowly dwindles. Therefore, over time, we should observe an improving association between (aggregate) earnings and stock return. In this study, we first replicate the results of Easton, Harris, and Ohlson (1992) for the same period of 1968-1986 and find very similar results under refined correlation metrics. Second, we expand coverage to test US data from 1962 to 2011 and find that their prediction holds for the past 50 years in the US market. Third, our post-1992 China and US data generate the same pattern of rising earnings-return correlation as the return interval expands, despite China\u2019s immature stock market. Further comparison indicates that the earnings-return correlation in China is lower than that in the US market in the same period of 1992-2011. Finally, to make our results comparable to the original ones in Easton, Harris, and Ohlson (1992), we also report the 1992-2011 results under the original metrics, such as R2 and concordant pair percentage; we still reach the same conclusions. Overall, the empirical results support Easton, Harris, and Ohlson\u2019s theory in both the US market and the emerging China market, extending the external validity of their theory to the international capital market.\nISSN:\u00a02307-3055 (eISSN)\nDOI:\u00a010.7603\/s40570-014-0009-z\nRights:\u00a0\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.

So new products, new processes, new organizational methods, new services, and so on, are all part of innovation. Technological innovation transforms and improves the technical attributes and performance characteristics of products and processes, and through this introduces dynamic change and productivity growth into the economic system. For this reason, all theories of economic growth rest in one way or another on ides concerning innovation and technological change. In studying innovation, most modern research has focused on the sources, nature and characteristics of knowledge and learning. If innovation is novelty, then it must also involve learning (after all, if we already knew how to do something, it would not be an innovation). If we think of technology as forms of knowledge related to productive transformations, then innovative learning is the process that expands the existing knowledge base.\n\nItem Type: Book Section\nKeywords: innovation; learning; technology; knowledge; economic growth\nPublisher: Thomson\nPage Range: pp. 98-105\nDate Deposited: 03 Sep 2007\nLast Modified: 18 Nov 2014 03:19\nItem Statistics: View statistics for this item\n\nRepository Staff Only (login required)\n\nItem Control Page Item Control Page",
