        "text":"Why is my Honey Gold pending?\n\nHoney Gold transactions normally appear as pending in your Account Overview within 2-14 days of your purchase.\u00a0\n\nTransactions typically remain pending for\u00a060 days while the merchant confirms your purchase and verifies that items from your order haven\u2019t been returned or refunded.\u00a0If you do return part of your purchase, the amount of Honey Gold you earn will adjust accordingly.\n\nTravel reservations (e.g. purchases made at hotels, car rentals, or other travel sites) earn Honey Gold on a different timeline. The merchant requires you to complete the reservation before Honey Gold is credited or even listed as pending in your account. Even though you have already paid, there's still the possibility that you may cancel or modify your trip.\n\nThese pending periods are determined by the merchant. Once the merchant confirms the purchase\u00a0(after the return window has ended or in the case of a travel reservation, when the stay is completed) our system automatically posts Gold to your account.\n\nPlease\u00a0reach out to us if you have any questions about pending Gold on your transactions.\u00a0\n\nStill need help?

(if there are actual paper tickets at a specific location)\n\nEarly-Bird Discount Pricing\n\nThis feature allows you to set a discount price for ticket buyers if they purchase by an early date. After that date, you can set the ticket price to go up automatically.\n\nFor example, let's say today is April 1 and your event is on May 31. You want to charge a $45 \"discount\" price for purchases from April 1 to April 30. The following day (May 1) you want a \"regular\" price of $50 to take effect. The \"regular\" price will remain until May 31, the day the event takes place.\n\nHere's what you do:\n\nYou are going to want TWOticket options. Fill in Ticket #1 Details. Enter information for the \"discount\" or \"early-bird\" price. For\u00a0Begin Selling This Ticket On, enter April 1. For Stop Selling This Ticket On, enter May 1st. Then, click the link called Add Another Ticket Option.\n\nA new window called Ticket #2 Details will appear. This is where you enter information for the \"regular\" price. For Begin Selling This Ticket On, enter May 1. For Stop Selling This Ticket On, enter May 31.\n\nPromo Code\n\nUse this feature to offer a special ticket price to a select group. This allows you to set one price for members of the select group and another price for everyone else.\n\n  \u2022 Create a promo code (whatever you wish it to be). Decide the ticket price that members of the select group will pay. Send the promo code to members of the select group. When they enter the code you created, the ticket price is reduced automatically.\n  \u2022 You can add one or more promo codes at any time to your existing tickets.\n\nMultiple Ticket Options\n\nYou can offer as many ticket \"options\" as you wish. For Example:\n\n  \u2022 \"Admit One for Dinner Only\"\n  \u2022 \"Admit One for Dinner and Tasting\"\n  \u2022 \"Admit One Saturday\"\n  \u2022 \"Admit One Saturday and Sunday\", etc.\n\nWill-Call Pick-up Locations\n\nYou can have as many \"Pick-up\" locations as you need. In addition, you can place a separate email for each location so that each location is notified when a purchaser has selected that location for pick-up.\n\nTo Change Ticket Prices\n\nYou can easily change ticket prices as you need from My Account.\n\nAttendees' List\n\nAn Excel spreadsheet is created for each ticketed event and is available to you 24\/7 under \"My Account\". It is sortable in any way that you might need based on the criteria of each ticket option. The spreadsheet includes full purchaser information, i.e., Name, Email Address, Address, Phone, Type of ticket purchased, etc.\n\n\nUpon the purchase completion of a ticket, the purchaser receives an email confirmation that includes a unique confirmation number generated by our system. The email also reaffirms the event information and includes the hosts contact information for questions or concerns. The purchaser is instructed to print the email and bring it to the event.

However, if you are a contractor you are responsible for your own WorkCover or income protection insurance.\n\nWorkplace accidents\n\nWorkers may experience injuries whilst at work, especially during a tour of a physically demanding performance piece.\u00a0 Someone may need to seek physiotherapy treatment, modify the performance, or even cancel the planned performance. Any injuries, no matter how serious, need to be reported to the tour manager\/supervisor\/producer as soon as they happen so that the appropriate follow up actions can be taken.\n\nWhat to do after a workplace accident\n\nIt is all too common for WorkCover to be an after thought, often when the injured person has already visited the doctor, or sought physio treatment.\u00a0 But if you wish to lodge a claim, a medical certificate is required when you first seek treatment.\n\nThis flow chart provides a simple summary of recommended steps to take should a workplace injury occur.\n\nPlease note that WorkCover may not cover the full cost of treatments, for a full list of rates please visit WorkCover QLD.",

If you or your partner have savings of over \u00a316,000, you may not be eligible for either of these benefits.\n\n\nState Benefits\n\nIf you are getting Income Support, Income Based Jobseekers Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance Income Related,\u00a0or Pension Credit, we may already have evidence of this. If not, we are able to get it directly from the Benefits Agency or Pension Service.\n\nWhere you, your husband\/wife\/partner or your non-dependants are getting any other State benefit, you will need to provide evidence. This could be:\n\n  \u2022 Award notification letters that show the current rates of benefit.\n  \u2022 Bank statements showing the award being paid in\n\n\nIf you are employed we need to see evidence of your earnings and the earnings of your partner or any non-dependants. The evidence you provide must cover either the last 5 weeks (if paid weekly), 3 payments (if paid fortnightly) and 2 months (if paid monthly).\u00a0 The best kinds of evidence are either:\n\n  \u2022 Wage slips (not handwritten) or\n  \u2022 A certificate of earnings which has been\u00a0completed by the employer (these are provided with your claim form), or:\n  \u2022 A letter from the employer\n\nThe earnings evidence should show the:\n\n  \u2022 Name and address of the employer\n  \u2022 Number of hours worked and period covered\n  \u2022 Gross earnings in year to date\n  \u2022 Gross income for pay period\n  \u2022 Income Tax\/National Insurance\u00a0deducted\n  \u2022 Employees pension contributions\n  \u2022 Method of payment eg:\u00a0transfer to bank account etc.\nExclamation Mark Remember -\nwe need to see the original documents, not photocopies. If you do not provide the documents we need, your Benefit may be delayed.\n\nSelf Employment\n\nIf you, your husband\/wife\/partner or your non-dependants are Self-Employed, we will need to see either:\n\n  \u2022 The most recent accounts\u00a0for tax purposes, or\n  \u2022 An estimate of your earnings based on your income and expenditure. You will need to complete a form which you can get by contacting us.\n\nIt would also be helpful if you could send us your latest tax assessment.\u00a0 We may ask you provide evidence to support your claim.\u00a0 If any person is involved in more than one form of self-employment, we need to see separate evidence for each type of work.\n\nOther Income\n\nYou will need to provide evidence of all other income received by yourself, your partner or your non-dependants. The evidence that you can supply will depend on the type of income, e.g.\n\n  \u2022 Private\/work Pensions - Last payment slips or award letter\n\nThere are certain expenses which can be offset against your income for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Reduction purposes. These expenses are:\n\n  1. Child care costs. There are certain circumstances in which you can offset up to a maximum figure. You need only give details for this if your child\/children are under the age of 15, attend a registered Nursery, out of school scheme or childminder and you (and your partner) are in full time work (over 16 hours per week). If only one member of the couple work and the other is incapacitated you may\u00a0also qualify - contact the Housing Benefit office for more information.\n  2. Private Pension. If you pay into a private pension scheme, half of your contributions may be disregarded. You will need to provide original documentation to confirm the amount you pay.\n  3. Payment towards a student grant.\n\n\nBy 'capital' we mean all your money - not just what you would call \"savings\". Examples of Capital that you must tell us about include:\n\n  \u2022 Bank and Building Society Accounts (including current\/cheque accounts)\n  \u2022 Post Office accounts\n  \u2022 Premium Bonds\n  \u2022 Stocks and Shares\n  \u2022 Land or Property (but not the home you live in)\n  \u2022 Cash\n\nAcceptable forms of evidence include:\n\n  \u2022 Current Bank or Building Society statements or Post Office books which show credits and debits and the outstanding balance over a period of the last two months prior to the claim\n  \u2022 A letter from the bank or building society which shows the:\n  \u2022 type of account held\n  \u2022 account numbers\n  \u2022 balance outstanding (The letter must say whether the details reflect the account for the last two months and provide any information on regular amounts deposited into the account)\n  \u2022 Original documents showing proof of ownership e.g., dividend statements detailing assets for:\n  \u2022 certificates\n  \u2022 bonds\n  \u2022 unit trusts\n  \u2022 stocks and shares etc.\n\n\nIf you cannot provide proof for any reason, you should contact the Benefits office immediately who will advise you what to do, or arrange a visit if necessary.\nExclamation Mark Remember -\nwe need to see the original documents, not photocopies. If you do not provide the documents we need, your Benefit may be delayed.\n\nIf you are not of pensionable age\u00a0the first \u00a36,000 of your capital is disregarded (ie: not counted in the benefit calculation) but for every \u00a3250 above \u00a36,000, we\u00a0add \u00a31.00 to your weekly income when we work out your\u00a0benefit.\u00a0 If you are of qualifying age for state pension we disregard the first \u00a310,000, but for every \u00a3500 above this amount we add \u00a31 to your weekly income.\n\nUpdated: 18 Mar 2016\nPowered by GOSS iCM",

        "text":"Sky Cancellations: 0800 151 2747\n\nIf you\u2019e having second thoughts about the Sky TV or Broadband package that you\u2019ve recently signed up for, don\u2019t delay in calling the Sky Cancellations Helpline on 0800 151 2747 to speak to an advisor about cancelling your contract before it\u2019s too late.\n\nGiven how vast and wide ranging Sky\u2019s services are, it\u2019s inevitable that many customers will want to modify or cancel their packages. It could be because of a house move, because of pricing increases, because of technical problems or even a better deal seen offered by a competitor. Although Sky is forever striving to do the best to improve and vary its services, it\u2019s impossible for everybody to be satisfied with what they\u2019re paying for, hence the presence of a dedicated Sky department aimed directly at aiding those wanting to cancel.\n\nWhatever the reason, reaching Sky\u2019s cancellation line is simple. By calling 0800 151 2747 you\u2019ll be connected to the company\u2019s main switchboard. After selecting a couple of options you\u2019ll be routed directly to Sky\u2019s customer cancellations department. There the representative will walk you through the process step by step, setting an exact date on which your services will cease. At this point the staff member will probably ask you why you want to give Sky up. How best can you respond?\n\nSometimes, Sky\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction and happiness will lead the company to offer you a selection of promotional reductions on their packages. High paying, long term customers tend to receive top priority for these, but with the market so competitive Sky is often willing to make concessions flexibly, especially during a price war with one or more of its rivals. If you simply mention you\u2019ve worked out a better offer elsewhere, the advisor present might try to dissuade you from cancelling by offering a better deal on your existing contract!\n\nThe overall length of time for Sky TV and Broadband to discontinue varies, though packages generally end up fully cancelled at the end of a 30 day period. If you want to stop the cancellation process, it\u2019s a simple matter of calling Sky within the 30 day notice period you\u2019ve given them. If you violate this cooling off period, the firm may charge you for breaking your contract. Note that if you prevent your cancellation by calling back during this window of time there\u2019s no need to explain your change of mind: the agent you\u2019ll converse with will simply erase your cancellation request and you\u2019ll be considered an ordinary paying subscriber as before.\n\nGiven how most of us are having to save in a persistently slow economy, it is possible to simply book upgrades or individual channels for a short time. So if for instance a big event is happening in football, you can get a channel for one month and order it cancelled at the end of the month and the tourney. This arrangement has become a common one for cancellations, with the expert staff present experienced and able to give you what you need and activate the channels\/packages you want in just minutes.\n\nIn the scenario that you\u2019ve already applied to join for Sky but no longer wish for the installation to go ahead, you can call the cancellations department to abort the entire process. This is generally straightforward, with the customer service advisors simply requesting your details and then putting the cancellation through rather than asking questions regards your change of mind. Effectively, you can cancel quickly and with confidence.\n\nIf you\u2019re certain about your cancellation and want to discuss your decision with one of Sky\u2019s trained customer care representatives, simply phone the Cancellations team on the number below.\n\nWhy not call Sky on 0800 151 2747 to discuss your cancellation decision with one of Sky\u2019s keen customer care representatives?\n\nProducts: Sky TV (Digital)Sky Broadband (Internet)Sky Plus\n\nEnquiries: Join Sky (Sales)Customer ServiceTechnical SupportBilling (Accounts)ComplaintsCancellationsHead Office\n\nThe telephone directory and call routing service",
