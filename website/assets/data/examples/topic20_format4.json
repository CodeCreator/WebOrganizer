        "text":"[Feature Requests] Please Discuss & Add Your Thoughts\n\nAlexRAlexR Cape Town\nedited January 2013 in Need Help\nFeature 1: Extra 2 Columns With Verified to Submitted Ratio per Project Over Last 24 Hours AND Over Last Week\/All Time\nAdvantage:\u00a0Allows us to quickly see which projects need attention. I know it's not the best ratio, but a decreasing ratio shows us which projects to focus on. This would be a good signal that there is something that needs improving if the ratio drops.What might also be useful is to have submitted per project in last 24 hours.\u00a0\n\nFeature 2: Merge Projects (Feature Added). (Right click project, merge)\n\nFeature 3: Extra Column to Show Remaining Target URL's\nAdvantage: Quick overview to see which project you need to load some more URL's too. Much better than going in project by project as in it's current format, its never used (by me anyway at least). Too much hassle to go into every project across multiple VPS's. If it was in an optional column I could scan and see which project needs more URL's!\n\nFeature 4: Use Master Accounts for Reposting & Tickbox \"Only Use Existing Accounts\"\nAdvantage: I know you can import account data from another project, but having an option that allows you to manage your account data would be neat.So maybe a tickbox \"Only Use Existing Accounts\" and then an option to select an account file.\n\nFeature 5: List Management Improvements:\nInterim Solution Feature 1:\u00a0Allow us to save the verified, submitted and identified lists on a per project or per group basis.\u00a0\nThis way, we can start creating niche lists that we can use again and again.\nInterim Solution Feature 2:\u00a0Save the PR & OBL data into the list. Then give us the option to set this as initial filter when using lists.\u00a0\nThis way, we can select \"Use List filter\" and it will only submit to urls in list that past test. So it would only use the list entries that pass this \"List Filter Test\" and then get data for those. YES, PR & OBL do change, but this would be quicker than running PR & OBL on ALL list items and then rejecting the URL if it doesn't pass.\u00a0\nAdvantage:\u00a0Rather apply a PRE-Filter, so the chance of it passing are higher. Huge efficiency improvement!\n\nFeature 6: SE Improvements\nFeature 6.1: Measure SE Overlap.\u00a0\nI.e. allow us to enter a single keyword measure the % of duplicates each SE generates.\u00a0\nAdvantage: This will allow us to see which SE's generate new results, and saves us time from parsing duplicates.\nFeature 6.2: Measure Keywords Overlap\nAllow us to enter in a primary keyword. It parses all results on a selected SE (e.g. Yahoo or Google international). Then it allows us to import a list of keywords and for each keyword it parses the results and measures how many duplicates or unique %. Thus, we know which keywords are worth using and can reject keywords below x unique %.\u00a0\nAdvantage:\u00a0If you have 1000 keywords and they generate 80% similar results, you can improve efficiency by 80% by deselecting keywords that generate duplicate results.\u00a0\n\nFeature 7: More Natural Looking Articles\nAdvantage: Basically allows us to insert external authority links from a file, a set number of times, on a specific set of keywords, in random positions. This is to ensure articles look even more unique. The first thing Google must use is the link position, and where the links point to, to see if it's duplicate. You might have 1000, 95% unique articles, but if in each article the link is always in the same place and always to the same 10 sites, it's obvious their very similar. Here what I suggest is option to add in external links, so make it more diverse and natural.\u00a0\n\nFeature 8: Ensure Tiered Links Exist (Set Option To Reverify links xx days, with tiers)\nBasically, when you are running a tiered project, it takes previously verified links and build links to these links. Over time some these links die and disappear, so we spend resources building tiered links to links that don't exist!\nAdvantage: Improved resource usage. Only building links to links that exist!\nThese aren't critical features but would be very very nice to have. :-) I'm going to keep listing features that I think are good ideas in this thread, rather than place them one by one in all the individual threads. I've come up with a lot of ideas recently as I've spent over 2 weeks neatening and restructuring my VPS's.\u00a0\n\nFeature 9: Remove Duplicate Domains\/URL's\n1) Remove Duplicate Domains should select all platforms except Blogs, and remove duplicate URL's should only select blog platforms.\n2) We should have option to run this feature every xx days to keep the lists clean. Make it automated so we don't have to worry about it. I often forget to clean this up.\u00a0\n\nFeature 10: Average Number of Threads in Last 24 Hours\n1) Most users are just selecting max threads at xx. They assume that it is actually running at this level. I'd like to see a little status task at bottom, with average thread count over last 24 hours.\u00a0\nAdvantage: See if you have optimised GSA or need to edit some keywords, global lists, etc.\u00a0\n\nFeature 11: Using Private & Public Proxies\n(as per Ozz & Giorgos)\nI like the idea to have a fallback option with public proxies.\n- when the count of private proxies is below XX than search, test and add public proxies\n- when private proxies are below that number than retest them every XX minutes\n- when private proxies are in use than give a hint in the status bar (different color of the \"P:\" box for example)\n- give preference to private proxies.\nAdvantage: Better results and less downtime!\n\nFeature 12: In Proxy Test Offer Us A Few URL's and Strings from a Dropdown list\nAll strings that I use give different results...so would be useful to have a few preadded.\n\nFeature 13: Use Anchor & Secondary Anchor Text as Tags in Articles, instead of keywords\nKeywords are often unrelated, especially if you use scrape keywords from sites.\n\n\n\n  \u2022 +1 for Feature 1. Should be added to the Show Diagram\/Chart tool.\n\n    Also requested this today.....here: https:\/\/forum.gsa-online.de\/discussion\/1450\/show-diagramchart-submissions#Item_4\n  \u2022 ronron SERLists.com\n    Accepted Answer\n    +1 (again). I am worried that people don't understand how important this information is. They just love blasting links with no idea how many got created for each project.\n  \u2022 +1\n\n    List management first and foremost.\n\n  \u2022 +1 great suggestions\n  \u2022 AlexRAlexR Cape Town\n    @ron, @NocT, @GiorgosK - which feature request is most n.b. to you?\n  \u2022 @ron Some people have no need for all that info. I have no need to know how many links get created per project. The only thing i care for is that my site ranks.\n  \u2022 edited January 2013 Accepted Answer\n    The most important feture that i need is 'Pause project after XX links for XX minutes for XX DAY' . ..So I can create 1000 links spread over 10 days with 100 links per day :-)\n\n    \u00a0If we get XX Day, I can set up so many tier2\/tier1 links project and don't have to baby sit each project to pause\/stop it\n  \u2022 Accepted Answer\n    +1. Great ideas here. I especially love Feature 3 as I often use custom lists and it would be awesome to know when to \"reload\" projects with URLs.\n  \u2022 Accepted Answer\n    +1 for me particulary #1. Lets also not forget the automatic reverification of verified links after X days to ensure our tiers are current and we are building links to 'live' links.\n  \u2022 AlexRAlexR Cape Town\n    For me, Feature 7 is right up there with the most important.\u00a0\n\n    @takeachance - see Feature 8 (added it now) :-)\n  \u2022 AlexRAlexR Cape Town\n    Feature 10 Added.\u00a0\n  \u2022 @globalgoogler\n    if you think private and public proxies working together is important please add it to the list because it gets buried https:\/\/forum.gsa-online.de\/discussion\/1512\/private-and-public-proxies-together\n  \u2022 AlexRAlexR Cape Town\n    Feature 11 Added.\u00a0\n  \u2022 just request for a feature 8, i hope it will add soon....\n  \u2022 ronron SERLists.com\n\n    I love everything you said @GG, but I still would love to see #1 implemented.\n\n    There is no way of seeing if you are weak on your linkbuilding for each project unless you have a column that shows what you did in the last 24 hours.\n\n  \u2022 AlexRAlexR Cape Town\n    @ron - totally agree.\u00a0\n\n    I'd love to see Feature 7 first, as it's needed for all contextual link submissions....so has a huge impact!\u00a0\n  \u2022 AlexRAlexR Cape Town\n    @sven - can you comment on these features when you have a moment? Which ones are doable? Which are impossible, etc...\n  \u2022 SvenSven www.GSA-Online.de\n    Accepted Answer\n    I have bookmarked this for later review...I add things when I have time...sorry, can't comment on all. But thanks for editing this so I can work on it better.\n  \u2022 GiorgosKGiorgosK Greece\n    edited January 2013\n    @Sven this is worth to be sticky as others will see it an not post yet another SIMILAR feature request they will just comment on this thread\n\n    or if there is a mod for this board to allow voting on threads that after a threshold they become sticky ;-)\n\n    for more proxy discussion take a look here\n  \u2022 AlexRAlexR Cape Town\n    @sven - thanks. I've been restructuring everything and focussing on efficiency and quality. As a result I've been reviewing every aspect of my campaigns and GSA use for improving efficiency. (Like the way you write programs that are so resource efficient ;-) ) Stepping back and reassessing has been great and given me many great ideas. Also I read every post on this forum, I come across many great ideas in individual comments, so sometimes I incorporate some of the ideas into a group thread.\n\n    I hope it's ok, if I keep posting features\/ideas for improvement. I understand that you are super busy, but I wanted to consolidate them into 1 or 2 threads, to keep track of them.\n\n    Keep up the good work...this is a fantastic product!\n\n  \u2022 Thanks for making this @GlobalGoogler\n  \u2022 In regards to this thread (partially reprinted from CreditDoc)\n\n    \u2022 Can we get a report of what sites used recaptcha so we can optimize these lists with prox...

The screen will close, but the process still shows up in task manager. Also, if the computer has been idle for more than a few minutes, I cannot open the web browsers at all. When I try to access task manager by pressing ctrl alt del after this happens, I get an error message saying something like, \"Logon failed to create security options dialog\" and the only way to get the system working again is to hold the power button down to shut it off, then restart it, which risks damaging my hard drives.\nI am running Vista, with all the available updates on a Quad core I built myself with 1.5Tb hard drive space total, and 4Gigs of RAM, so memory isn't a problem. I have tried running several virus\/adware\/malware scans which found nothing unusual, and have even wiped my hard drives and reinstalled Vista. I posted a HJT log a month or two ago, right before I reinstalled, which appearantly didn't find any viruses or trojans. I was running ZoneAlarm and Avast, and have since switched anti-virus to AVG in the hopes that would help, but to no avail.\nI have also searched on the internet, and found many people with the same or similar problems, but no solutions, or at least none that have worked for me. I am hoping that there is still something I have missed, and that perhaps someone here can help me to fix this issue before my hard drives are damaged or I have to find a copy of XP to install.\nIf any of you have any ideas, I would greatly appreciate any advice.

Here we have it, as the rumour mill suggested, Google has released the On2 VP8 video codec as open source (royalty free, BSD-style), while also launching the WebM container format which combines a VP8 video stream with Vorbis audio. Support for WebM has been enabled on YouTube's HTML5 beta, and you can download patches against ffmpeg as well as DirectShow filters for Windows (Gstreamer plugins are labelled as \"coming soon\"). Mac users are out of luck for now; no QuickTime plugins have been announced yet. Update: The WebM blog is now open - and the list of partners is pretty decent already. It includes ARM, NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, and many others. Update II: VP8 will be baked into Flash.
