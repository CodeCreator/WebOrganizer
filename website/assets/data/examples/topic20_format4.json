I came to the conclusion that I had to delete everything and start again from scratch, Having now done this, I've lost my playlists...\n\n    Stupidly I thought they were backed up but it turns out they aren't. I dont have time machine and I've got an Ipod classic that has them all on, I dont want to connect it though and have it sync and automatically delete them from it as well! Which I presume it will do... Does anyone know anyway around this predicament?\n\n    Many thanks,\n\n\n  2. #2\n\n    mrplow's Avatar\n    Member Since\n    Oct 01, 2007\n    27\" iMac i7 (2011) 10.11, Mac Mini i5 (2014), iPhone7, Apple Watch, iPad Pro 9.7, AppleTV (4)\n    You can connect your iPod, and just cancel the sync (then stop it syncing sutomatically from the summary page) or just quit iTunes.\n\n    But you'll need an app like Senuti to recover the playlists from your iPod.\n    Not been around these parts for a while.

No since overpaying for more than you need.\n\nThread Information\n\nUsers Browsing this Thread\n\nThere are currently 1 users browsing this thread.

Why can't I\nview your site?\"\n>ME - \"Why do you do these things to yourself?\"\n\nWell Gail, I can tell you that many of us are extremely reluctant\nto have stuff happening which we have no control over! Call us\ncontrol freaks or paranoid if you will, but intrusive,\nuncontrolled poking around on our PCs, reading\/writing of files,\ncookies, self-executing files, automatic opening of files in\ninstalled programmes, etc. etc. is not our thing...\n\nWe have \"nothing to hide\" as it were, but do not enjoy the\nconcept of uncontrolled access to our hard-drives, especially\ngiven the capacity of hidden or secret reading\/writing by an\nunknown person or persons, including Mr. Gates... So in a bid to\nstop any \"unauthorised\" access we will use both appropriate and\ninappropriate methods according to our understanding, skills and\nknowledge levels.\n\nFor example, I was appalled that hitting a link to a M$.document\nfile on the internet using the M$ IE browser AUTOMATICALLY OPENS\nthat file in M$-Word!?! What a great way of accepting and\ninstalling malicious code... Just one embedded macro and away we\ngo...! OK there are few sites which would have or tolerate\ninfected files, but I have enough problems without the mere\nthreat, never mind should I be unlucky enough to actually hit on\none of the exceptions =B0!=B0\n\nI think you will find that most users have had problems with\n\"bells and whistles\" sites. They can crash, freeze and do stuff\nto one's PC\/iMac even with the most up to date programmes\ninstalled... Yes, most is not serious, being \"harmless\" and\nrepairable, but on the the other hand it is extremely irritating.\nMost of us are in the \"average user\" category, so we do not have\nthe solutions you professionals have at your finger-tips.\n\nNor IMO should we as \"honoured guests & visitors\" be expected to\ndo so or have to put up with what the pros know perfectly well is\nsimply not universally accessible and user-friendly! I would say\nthat all web sites should be cross-platform and browser friendly\nwith the minimum of reliance on \"extras\" like the Macromedia\npackages such as Flash, Shockwave, etc. Hell, it may be hard to\nbelieve for those who have the newest kit available, but some\npeople still do not have a graphic cards or speakers, let alone\nstate-of-the-art hardware and software!\n\nOffice work is considered a tedious time-waster for many who\nregard this medium as just another working tool or virtual\nextension to their library, so ADDITIONAL frustrations caused by\nsome sites can be the straw that breaks the camel's back. IMO it\nis the flashy sites, long download times and associated\nfrustrations that increasingly DISCOURAGE internet use, which is\nreally funny when you think about it... All the whizzo web\ndevelopers racing to make sites \"interesting\", \"visually\nexciting\" and \"interactive\" are shooting themselves in the foot,\nunless their target audience are into the same sort of thing.\n\nI know, I know... I am an old codger and simpleton easily amused\nby little animated gifs which are considered naff in many\ncircles... But when I go on-line, I am looking for INFORMATION,\nnot entertainment! I do not like jumping out of my skin at\nunexpected noises and simply hate having to wait an age for\nevidence of the site developers technical prowess. It is not that\nI am impatient either... We pay for every nano-second on-line as\ndo many in Europe and elsewhere, so until I win the lottery,\nsites which hold me up in any way will not be visited.\n\nI realise that it is extremely exciting to use the many options\nnow available and increasing by the day, but think it is\nimportant not to get too carried away by them. Just as you do not\nunderstand concerns already voiced by others, I do not understand\nwhy you do not appreciate their take on this whole issue?\n\nI for one also take the cautions, warnings and advice from other\nusers, magazine articles, web sites, newsgroups, books,\nnewsletters, etc. to heart. For example, I avoid using M$ IE and\nOE. At least Opera ASKS me whether I want to accept cookies and\ntells me which are illegal or dubious. Any file which is not HTML\nor HTM will prompt a question... What do I want to do with it...\nOpen or Save to file? And Calypso (now being marketed as Courier)\ndoes not open ANY attachments without my express permission, nor\nwill it display HTM\/HTML e-mail. Indeed it refuses to open .sci,\n.pif and all the predesignated \"banned\" file extensions. I have\nset it to be this way... Really neat features which have saved a\nlot of hassle in recent weeks...\n\nIt is not being paranoid... As you know, I have an amazing\nability to attract disaster all the time, so why increase the\nodds of it happening by \"importing\" potential problems? As long\nas M$ cannot get its act together on security issues, I will\nremain one of those who \"do it to myself\"... Indeed, like many\nother disillusioned M$ users, the day I switch to Linux is\ndrawing closer all the time...\n\n\nJanet Kaiser -- down to only 400 unread mails!?!

I'm doing a voluntary workshop for high school professors to teach them the basics of networks and managing networks on Linux. It's gonna be a two day workshop.\n\nTheir knowledge is, i quote: \"It is possible they might not know what routers are\"\n\nFirst day\nIntroduction to networks.\nOSI, TCP\/IP, network devices, protocols\n\nAnd at the end of the first day, they will have to conceptually configure the network in their school, just the needs and services.\n\nExample: \"We have 50 computers, 2x20 in two computer room, and 10 in the professors quarters. Computers in the computer room have to be able to share files locally, but not access computers outside...\"\n\nSecond day\nI want to make them a live cd\/usb which has Lubuntu, and installed and set of virtual machines (say 5-6 of them). One of the virtual machines would have multiple NIC-s and have a specialized Router\/Firewall distribution (didn't yet choose which). Other virtual machines would be clients.\n\nI'm planning on using KVM with libvirt\/virt-manager for virtualization.\n\nWe would then experiment, grouping the clients in different subnets and trying to set file sharing.\n\nMy questions to the community:\n  1. Do you think the idea is ok? Any advice will be listened to?\n  2. Which of the dedicated distribution would you advise to use? Id should be as friendly as possible, if they have to set iptables on their own, we'll lose them to Microsoft ;)\n  3. They are gonna have to have multiple opened terminals for virtual machines. Ssh-ing to them doesn't seem like a good idea since we will change the IPs often. Is there something as a nice VNS window manager, or similar?\n\ncpasqualini 09-18-2012 01:21 PM\n\ni'm theaching IT to post scholar-age guys, and make them learn tcp\/ip in one day... it just din't work out.\ni'm using ipcalc and the (simple) explanations from wikipedia [1], they have understanded that same day, but the next week they just didn't get it.\n\n\nOn the topic of the router distribution, please consider ipcop, i've used the old version (1.4.x) a few years ago, and had a very good experience.\nI did not yet used the new version (2.x), but these are very paranoid people, so the product shall be good enough.\n\ni'll be glad to see a report from you when this experience be completed. please post in this same tread about it!\n\nAll times are GMT -5.

I would now like to have a triple boot with all OS available, including the Windows XP image.\n\nI installed EasyBCD and launched, but it tells me it cannot find the boot file. I suppose this means that since Grub is handling boot, the Windows 7 boot file is not available.\n\nBut from here on in, I have not the faintest idea of what to do.\n\n- Does Grub have to be written to the Ubuntu partition and how to do that?\n- Do I have to re-create the Windows 7 bootloader and how to do that?\n- Once that is done, can I run Easy BCD and add en entry for Windows XP, or do I use NeoGrub?\n\nI welcome any information that can clear up my doubts and get me running. Thanks for your help.\n\n\n\nMostly Harmless\nStaff member\nJust manually select the BCD file from EasyBCD, then add the XP entry.",

(IE includes image\/gif, but not image\/png in its accept headers, so any descent content negotiation system will do that. e.g. Apache Multiviews)\n\n    \u2022 #2\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Thu 1 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 1927\n    Sebastian Redl wrote in to say...\n\n    I\u2019m not quite sure what your issue is. Your problem seems to be that the wrong background colour is saved in the PNG (silver-grey instead of black), causing IE to show that silver-grey, while other browsers correctly display transparency. Is that it?\n    If so, choosing black as the background colour before exporting the image in PS should suffice.\n    In other words, this image:\n    should work. But since I\u2019m running Linux right now, I can\u2019t test in IE. (It is transparent in Firefox.) I also can\u2019t tell you exactly how to do that in PS, as I did it in the Gimp 2.2.\n\n    \u2022 #3\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Thu 1 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 1936\n    Screwtape wrote in to say...\n\n    I don\u2019t know about Photoshop, but I just did it in about five minutes with the GIMP:\n\n    * Create a new image, RGB.\n    * Right-click on the background layer, \u201cAdd alpha to layer\u201d.\n    * Use the Eraser tool to draw a diamond shape.\n    * Set the background colour (you know the overlapping-rectangles foreground\/background colour widget) to black.\n    * File -> Save as PNG.\n    * In the PNG Options dialog that appears, I made sure \u201cInterlacing\u201d and \u201cSave background color\u201d were ticked, and everything else was unticked.\n    * Create test HTML page with the CSS rule body { background: red; } and an <img> tag that points to the PNG I just saved.\n    * Presto!

It seems like Photoshop will only consider layer transparency when making the PNG, not giving you the option to just pick an Alpha Channel to use for that transparency instead. (Which is lame because layer transparency is really just an alpha channel hidden from the user.) You should theoretically be able to have anything in your image data and anything in the alpha channel when making the PNG. Maybe there is a third-party plugin or software that lets you do it.\n\n    \u2022 #7\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Thu 1 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 2125\n    Steve Clay wrote in to say...\n\n    Start with your image in a layer. Delete the background layer if it exists. Make a layer of all white beneath the image. Select the image layer and use Select: Color range\u2026 Click on the black and pull the fuzziness all the way to the right. Click OK. Now select the all-white layer and hit delete. Now delete the image layer. It seems the only way to save variable opacity is via File: Save as.. and it saves as a 24-bit PNG. When I view this in IEwin, the middle isn\u2019t black, it\u2019s a light blue\u2026 One of my system colors? Macromedia needs to hook you up with Fireworks for better alpha PNGs. ;)\n\n    \u2022 #8\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Thu 1 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 2138\n    Anthony wrote in to say...\n\n    p.s. I just tried it in piece of high-end compositing software that would actually let me take a a version of your diamond file and with no transparency and set up an alpha channel which would be the only place it could get it\u2019s transparency. I exported the PNG from there and when I open in PS the black color information in the RGB channels is gone. It might be something about the PNG spec that make apps write it this way. (Though after seeing the \u201clight silver-gray\u201d effect in IE, I wonder if this isn\u2019t more about how IE is handling it, since it\u2019s actually not really ignoring the alpha, which is what you were hoping for I think. If it were, I don\u2019t know what would be there since there is no color information in RGB, but it does see the diamond somehow.)\n\n    \u2022 #9\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Thu 1 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 2234\n    Anonymous Coward wrote in to say...\n\n    Anthony may be right. From the spec:\n\n    The alpha channel can be regarded either as a mask that temporarily hides transparent parts of the image, or as a means for constructing a non-rectangular image. In the first case, the colour values of fully transparent pixels should be preserved for future use. In the second case, the transparent pixels carry no useful data and are simply there to fill out the rectangular image area required by PNG. In this case, fully transparent pixels should all be assigned the same colour value for best compression.\n\n    Maybe Photoshop just assumes the second case. Though we can\u2019t know for sure unless somebody tries to directly read off the different channels in the file.\n\n    \u2022 #10\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Thu 1 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 2253\n    hemebond wrote in to say...\n\n    There doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to add a bKGD in Photoshop.

I\u2019m not sure. :-)\n\n    Might also be working looking at the Photoshop SDK if it has info on how Save As PNG works, I don\u2019t know. Just a guess.\n\n    \u2022 #13\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Thu 1 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 2345\n    John wrote in to say...\n\n    I thought I\u2019d be clever and try this out in CS2 and ImageReady, but yeah, Photoshop does not seem to have good PNG support. SuperPNG, a plugin for Photoshop, also does not seem to directly support what you want, but I have yet to test it.\n\n    \u2022 #14\n    \u2022 Comment\n    \u2022 Fri 2 Sep 2005\n    \u2022 0117\n    Anonymous Coward from comment #9 wrote in to say...\n\n    Well, I guess I was wrong, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Photoshop\u2019s fault after all. Looking at how IE renders images with varying transparency like the W3C PNG test and the image used here, it\u2019s clear that IE first composites the PNG onto a grey background, then displays the whole thing as an opaque image. Serves me right for shooting my mouth off without knowing enough about the subject.\n\n    However, there is a solution, though you can\u2019t do it in Photoshop. If you use an 8-bit paletted RGBA image, IE renders only those parts which are 100% opaque, and anything below 100% opacity become transparent. Which will work for your diamond image, and you\u2019ll be able to switch its colours in IE as well. Fireworks can do this, or you can use pngquant to postprocess your PNGs. For an example, look at these toucans in IE and a better browser.\n\n    A disadva... (truncated)",

Somebody actually did it.\nCITIC, China\u2019s biggest conglomerate, has started redirecting its established .com domain to its new dot-brand gTLD, .citic.\nSpecifically, it\u2019s redirecting citic.com (go on, click it!) to limited.citic.\nAlmost everyone reading this post will agree that as a memorable, attractive domain it\u2019s a step backwards.\nBut CITIC does seem to be the first dot-brand to make the leap from .com to dot-brand with both feet, and it seems to have done so with little to no penalty to its Google ranking (at least as far as searches for its company name go).\nA Google search for \u201ccitic\u201d here returns limited.citic as the third result, behind Wikipedia and one of CITIC\u2019s sister companies.\nThe original citic.com doesn\u2019t appear in the top results.\nThe company also has ranking for group.citic, one of the five second-level names active in the .citic zone file right now.\nIt\u2019s not the first dot-brand to launch a web site at its new gTLD \u2014 destination.monash and annualreport.axa spring to mind \u2014 but it does seem to be the first to throw away its .com completely.\nCITIC does not appear to have activated its matching Chinese-script gTLD, .\u4e2d\u4fe1, in the same way, however. Only nic.\u4e2d\u4fe1 appears in search results for sites under that TLD.\nThanks to Jothan Frakes of NamesCon for the tip.\n\nTagged: , , ,\n\nComments (28)\n\n  1. Kassey says:\n\n    Two issues: (1) Wrong order. Should be citic.limited to correspond to the company name Citic Limited. Limited.citic is just difficult to remember. (2) There is no established convention yet on the entry point of .brand. .brand may work if the average consumer has a way to know how to access them, e.g. if all major brands agree to use \u201cvisit\u201d as the entry point, such as visit.citic, visit.axa, visit.hilton, then .brand may become popular. Otherwise, it just imposes too much work on the consumers.\n\n    \u2022 Kevin Murphy says:\n\n      Personally, I always thought www. would make a comeback.\n      http:\/\/www.axa, http:\/\/www.citic, http:\/\/www.google etc\n      I can see reasons why it might be confusing \u2014 people might automatically add an extra TLD \u2014 but it has the benefit of being a well-understood convention for denoting a URL in ad copy.\n\n      \u2022 Rubens Kuhl says:\n\n        http:\/\/www.citic is in their collision list. I\u2019m pretty sure they will change it to http:\/\/www.citic after controlled interruption is over in mid-November.\n\n        \u2022 Adrian Kinderis says:\n\n          Guys, I think you have this all wrong.\n          Adding http:\/\/www.tld is only going to confuse. www is an accepted convention and internet users expect to see http:\/\/www.blah.tld (that is a second level domain before the tld and after the www. You are asking them to learn more, not less\n          I believe www should make a comeback for a short period of time in order to facilitate the understanding of new tlds. Eventually it will not be required and when home.axa appears on a billboard it will be recognized as a URL by the dot separating the words alone.\n          A standardized convention across all brands would be helpful in the short term but certainly NOT www.\n\n    \u2022 Hmm \u2026\n      Even though I foresee dot Brands making headway, there\u2019s still something humorous in this phase we\u2019re in.\n      Basically, some companies will be abandoning a convention understood by everybody (\u201cCOM\u201d on the right) in favor of confusingly inconsistent longer strings (\u201cvisit\u201d, \u201chome\u201d, \u201climited\u201d, etc. on the left).\n      For now, the swap has clear disadvantages. In the future, maybe websites will arrive at a consistent left-side string to designate home pages \u2014 but probably nothing as regular or short as a .COM suffix.\n\n      \u2022 Kassey says:\n\n        If all major brands agree on using, for example, \u201cgo\u201d as the entry point to .brand, e.g. go.google, go.amazon, etc., then .brand may overtake .com as the top extension. \u201cgo\u201d is short enough to remember.\n\n        \u2022 Rubens Kuhl says:\n\n          go is subject to regulatory issues, due to being a 2-letter combination. One TLD already filed an RSEP for it. It would be easier to define a 1 letter like 1.google or g.google.\n\n          \u2022 I wonder if standardizing the SLD for dot-Brand home pages is even possible, given the fact that name collision lists rule out many of the most intuitive choices and also differ from TLD to TLD.\n\n      \u2022 Adrian Kinderis says:\n\n        Your logic hold up for as home page but what about every other page under that? running.nike, shoes.nike, charity.nike, 2014.nike, superbowl.nike?\n        .com does not support this convention. It tells no more information to the end user and as a signpost on the internet is inadequate and, because of tlds, antiquated.\n\n        \u2022 Home.brand is it. Everyone knows what \u201chome\u201d means. Easy!\n          I see no need in marketing for www and have not for awhile. I am sick of typing it, so don\u2019t and sick of seeing it take up valuable key messaging space.\n          As for how others line up under \u2013 that is the fun part isn\u2019t it.\n          So many moves here, what is the market strategy, first test and learn steps \u2026 brand motivation\/permission to innovate how they engage and deliver services to customers.\n          Brands have to think about a .brand registry as a network that interconnects as opposed to a web site. It\u2019s a different thing or can be.\n\n  2. friend says:\n\n    It would matter if they didnt have the .com.. but they do. And they won\u2019t sell it if you try to buy it.\n\n  3. Kassey says:\n\n    Why go back? We\u2019ve simplifying the naming convention over these years \u2014 getting rid of http:\/\/ then www. Now do I want to relearn the old way? I doubt.\n\n    \u2022 Kevin Murphy says:\n\n      In my comment above, WordPress automatically added the http:\/\/ to each of the three domains.\n      I didn\u2019t type it.\n      I think that\u2019s a new \u201cfeature\u201d of WordPress 4.0, released this week.\n      Perhaps we\u2019re not moving forward as fast as you think.\n\n      \u2022 Kevin-\n        This is a bit obtuse to the topic but more a focus on your comment regarding the http:\/\/ mojo in your comment\u2026\n        Pondering the http:\/\/ injection a bit\u2026 It represents some real Universal Acceptance (UA) wins and efforts.\n        Recognizing the links means that the TLDs are recognized for URLs. Skype and other software does not, so this I\u2019d file under \u201cWin\u201d.\n        Converting the links to contain http:\/\/ helps overcome some of the laggard browsers \/ OS combinations or other software issues that do not recognize nTLD URLs.\n        Matt Mullenweg of WordPress spoke at the NamesCon in January and he is fairly domain savvy (he owns MA.TT \u2013 and incedentally, he forwards matt.build there). Seems likely they did what they could to aid UA.\n\n        \u2022 Kevin Murphy says:\n\n          I disagree. I think WordPress added the http:\/\/ because of the \u201cwww.\u201d, not because of the TLDs.\n\n        \u2022 Kevin Murphy says:\n\n          Let\u2019s see what WordPress does to http:\/\/www.thisisntatld\n\n          \u2022 Kevin Murphy says:\n\n            Yep, WP added the http:\/\/ there too. This isn\u2019t a UA thing, it\u2019s a WordPress being shit thing.\n\n          \u2022 Justin says:\n\n            Instead of saying WordPress is a shit thing, you should appreciate that if not for WordPress, many people would not have started blogging and not got attracted to buy domains in the secondary market, but remain with the facebooks and\/or twitters and\/or the umpteen platforms. Anyway, we domainers, creating a non-existant industry, have always been disconnected from reality and the general public sentiment who are fed up with the exorbitant prices in secondary market, which resulted in these new gTLDs and .brands. Google will happily oblige the new gTLDs and .brands because it matches their own anti-domainer thinking. With the browser address bar having become an extension of the search engine, typeins are already a thing of the past. A domain name with the dot(s) anywhere within, is afterall just a more memorable sequence of alphanumeric characters representing a sequence of numbers identifying a website on the world wide web. It\u2019s the product or the content that matters in the end. Domaining is dead! Although I hate Bob Parsons for the elephant thing, I admire his business acumen \u2013 he entered and exited at the right times! Look around and you will see most big names who actually made money with domains have all exited quietly and smartly \ud83d\ude1b\n\n  4. Wrong heading.\n    Correct heading: First major idiot to move from .com to new extension.\n\n  5. Snoopy says:\n\n    Wasn\u2019t there prediction that a whole lots of companies would be doing this? Like most of the companies who applied? What happen to .google, .apple, .yahoo, .sony?\n    Instead of that we\u2019ve got one unheard of company trying it , and two other organisations using it for very minor sites. Is that it?\n\n  6. Moving from a .com to a .brand is a risky move at the outset, depending upon your business dependence on revenue run rates dependent upon SEO and other inherent market awareness of the .com site. That said for some businesses a forward will work just fine.\n    .BRAND is about better communicating key messages, engaging and delivering services to target audiences on a branded ecosystem.\n    My view: \u201chome.brand\u201d will emerge as the norm.\n    Precise and obvious and consistent with user knowledge of what a \u201chome page\u201d means.\n\n  7. Bean says:\n\n    Companies don\u2019t have to develope any new strategy whatsoever, what they have now ain\u2019t broken. Only domainers care for the awesomeness and potential these new tlds.\n    Most end user nowadays don\u2019t even look at the url address bar, they just care what result comes up in their search engine. In fact, there is quite a few people I know that have been using internet for years and had no idea you could actually type a direct address in the url bar!\n    Perhaps, if marketed properly, the general public might som...
