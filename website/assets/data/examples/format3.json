        "text":"System Requirements for SURFCAM and Part Modeler\n\nSupported Operating Systems\n\nWe recommend you install the latest service packs for the supported operating systems.\nSystem Type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor\n  \u2022 Microsoft Windows 7 Professional (SP1 required)\n  \u2022 Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise (SP1 required)\n  \u2022 Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate (SP1 required)\n  \u2022 Microsoft Windows 8 Professional\n  \u2022 Microsoft Windows 8 Enterprise\n  \u2022 Microsoft Windows 10 Professional\n  \u2022 Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise\n\nWhen installing:\nWe recommend that you update to the latest security key drivers (if a security key is fitted).\n\nYou may experience problems with the driver supplied by your graphics card manufacturer - check for the latest driver updates on the web site for your card.\n\n\n  \u2022 SURFCAM and Part Modeler will install and run on the 'home' editions of these operating systems. However this is not recommended and we cannot guarantee to fix any SURFCAM or Part Modeler issues specifically related to these operating systems.\n  \u2022 The Sentinel RMS license server runs as a system service on Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003 (32-bit and 64-bit), Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit), Server 2008 R2 (64-bit), Server 2012 (64-bit) and Windows 7. Sentinel RMS network licenses can be installed on virtual servers provided that they are locked to a Safenet Computer ID USB key. Standalone (single seat) Sentinel RMS licenses cannot be locked against the new keys for use on a virtual server.\n  \u2022 It is not recommended to have multiple SURFCAM versions installed on the same computer when the user has limited rights or UAC is ON as this may potentially cause problems with Simulator. ClosedMore info...\n  \u2022 Domain Controllers are not supported for ToolStore Server and SURFCAM due to SQL limitations.\n  \u2022 Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Vista are no longer supported by SURFCAM.\n  \u2022 Windows 8 RT is not supported by SURFCAM.\n  \u2022 SQL Express 2014 has a memory limit of 1 GB and a Database size limit of 10 GB. Performance issues may arise if the database is near this limit. To avoid these issues, if several job images are required, we recommend that they are not stored in the database. Job images can be extracted from the database using a command line option (tsadmin \/ExtractJim) which will extract the job images to the ToolStore support folder, JobImages. Please ensure that the server has enough memory to handle the database, if it is not an Express version.\n\nMinimum Specifications\n\n  \u2022 64-bit Intel Pentium 4 processor (2 GHz or faster), Intel Xeon, Intel Core, AMD Athlon 64, AMD Opteron, AMD Phenom or later, in single, dual or quad core versions\n  \u2022 4 GB of RAM\n  \u2022 10 GB free disk space for the SURFCAM installation\n  \u2022 17\" Colour monitor (1280 x 1024 screen resolution)\n  \u2022 Mouse including wheel (Intellimouse)\n  \u2022 SpaceMouse\/SpaceBall (optional)\n  \u2022 Network card\n  \u2022 Internet Explorer 8 or above\n  \u2022 Internet connection for license activation\/updates\n  \u2022 USB port for the SURFCAM security key (unless using keyless licensing)\n\nTo make the most of background processing and multi-threading, we recommend a 64-bit operating system and 2GB RAM for each processor as a minimum.\n\nGraphics cards\n\n  \u2022 NVIDIA Quadro range\n  \u2022 AMD Fire Pro range\n  \u2022 AMD Fire GL range\n  \u2022 Intel HD range \u2013 5000, 4400, 4200\n\nNote: Some older cards in the ranges above may no longer be supported. Please check the relevant supplier to see if an up to date driver is available for your operating system:\n\nThe ToolStore Server installer will install the following items if they are not already present on your system:\n  \u2022 .NET Framework version 3.5 SP1 (includes .NET Framework version 2.0)\n  \u2022 .NET Framework version 4\n  \u2022 Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Setup\n  \u2022 Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Setup\n  \u2022 Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Setup\n\nThe Live Job Reports Server does not support Windows XP or Windows Server 2003; only Vista \/ 7 \/ 8 and Server 2008 up to 2012 R2 are supported. The Live Job Reports client requires one of the following web browsers:\n\n  \u2022 Internet Explorer 10,\n  \u2022 Google Chrome 28,\n  \u2022 Firefox 22 or above.",

We would like Objectis to be used by international people. So it must be translated and adapted to several languages.\n\nNow this service is available in French, in English (or in something that is pretty close to English) and in Russian. German and Hebrew versions are under construction and will soon be finished. If you want to contribute to this service and translate it, please contact us. The credits of each version will thank the contributors and give some of their links. And, eventually, gigantic statues of these fellow partners will be erected in our office. That sounds cool, doesn't it?\n\nService administration\n\nIt is not an easy task to manage a service like Objectis. You may contribute in three ways:\n\n  \u2022 manage the language-specific content: responsibility of a space provider is important in France (where the site is hosted). We obviously do not want to give space for harmful content (racist or pornographic content, etc.). The opening of a site in a language that we do not know can only be possible if you help us.\n  \u2022 technical management: some help by Zope specialists will always be appreciated. We may open our CVS and the server ZMI to those who want to help on such things.\n  \u2022 monitor the system: space providing is a real-time activity. Help us to give you the greatest possible quality of service.\n\n\nYou want to associate your name with this initiative? Direct costs are numerous: bandwidth, dedicated server, etc. If you participate financially in this service, you may retain the attention of a lot of Zope developers and the whole open source community.",

Check the Applicable Products and Categories section of this article before starting these steps.\n\nThe writing functionality of the stylus (pen) for the Digital Paper System is disabled if the tip is pressed while connecting the USB cable to charge it. To re-enable functionality, reconnect then disconnect the stylus to the USB cable without pressing the tip.\n\nMake sure that your stylus is fully charged for optimal performance. You may experience slowness or lag during handwriting or annotations if it isn't sufficiently charged.\n\n\n  \u2022 Charging time is up to three hours using a USB connection to an active computer or to an AC adapter, such as a smartphone charger.\n  \u2022 The red indicator turns off when the stylus is fully charged.\n  \u2022 The average estimated battery life or usage time is approximately one month (based on writing usage of 60 minutes per day).\n\nOther Things to Check\n\nIf the issue still occurs, additional troubleshooting is available. Check if the stylus works after each step.\n\n  1. Re-calibrate the stylus (pen).\n    1. On your device, press the Home Home button button.\n    2. Tap Settings.\n    3. Tap System Settings.\n    4. Select Pen Calibration.\n      1. Select the variation that most resembles your own grip from the four variations displayed on how to hold the pen, then select Next.\n      2. Use the pen to trace the dotted lines as you would normally write.\n      3. Tap Next.\n      4. Tap the arrows that point up, down, left, and right to move the line that you drew and align it with the dotted line.\n      5. Tap Next when the lines are in basically the same position.\n        \u2022 The confirmation screen is displayed.\n      6. Trace the dotted line again, as you did in step 2.\n        \u2022 If the line that you drew appears displaced, tap Recalibrate to return to the previous screen. The line that you drew on the confirmation screen will be displayed, so correct the placement again, as you did in step 4. After you finish correcting the position, tap Next, and trace the dotted line on the confirmation screen again.\n      7. Tap Save when the dotted line and the line that you drew appear to line up.\n  2. Initialize your device to factory default settings.\n\n    WARNING! All files will be deleted. Back up important data on your computer.\n\n    1. Press the Home Home button button.\n    2. Tap Settings.\n    3. Tap System Settings.\n    4. Tap Initialize Digital Paper.",
