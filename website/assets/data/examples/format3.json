        "text":"Family Services\n\n\nTribal Operations & Family Services\n\nTribal Enrollment (Membership)\n\nCriteria for Membership: By the\u00a0Constitution Ratified Sept. 29, 1999:\n\n\nSECTION 1.

Membership by Council Vote\nA person of Wyandotte Nation ancestry who does not meet the requirements of Section 1 of this Article may be accepted for membership by a majority vote of the Nation Council.\n\nSECTION 3. Voluntarily Withdrawing Membership\nAny adult member voluntarily withdrawing his or her membership from the Wyandotte Nation does so forever. For purposes of this Section, voluntarily withdrawing membership shall include persons who lose their United States citizenship or who enroll in any other federally recognized tribe, nation, band, group or community after becoming a member of the Nation.\n\nSECTION 4. Rules Governing Membership\nThe Board of Directors will enact rules governing voluntary withdrawal of membership, termination of membership, the membership application process, provisions for appeal of denial of membership and adoptions.\n\nSECTION 5. Council Decision on Membership\nThe Board of Directors shall provide in the rules governing membership that the Nation\u2019s Council shall make final decision on the Nation\u2019s membership. The decision of the Nation\u2019s Council shall be final. There shall be no appeals.\n\n\nMembership Application Process:\nNew members are added one time a year during the Wyandotte Nation Annual Meeting.\u00a0 Completed applications must be received in the Enrollment office by August 15, 2016 in order to be considered for enrollment at the 2015 Annual Meeting.\n\n1. Log into the Members Only area to download an application or contact the Wyandotte Nation Family Services Department.\n2. The membership application must be completed and returned to this office with an ORIGINAL State Certified Birth Certificate.

Click here for a replacement citizenship card application.\n\nCertificate of Degree of Indian Blood card:\n\nWhat is a CDIB card? A Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood certified that an individual possesses a specific degree of Indian blood of a federally recognized Indian Tribe. There are some programs and services based upon your status as an American Indian, which require you to furnish this card before services are rendered. A CDIB card does Not establish membership in a federally recognized Indian Tribe, and it does not prevent an Indian Tribe from making a separate and independent determination of blood degree for tribal purposes. Prior to 1989 the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued these cards to Wyandotte Indians. After 1989, the Wyandotte Nation issued Tribal-issued CDIB cards.\n\nTo apply for a CDIB card:\n\n1.
