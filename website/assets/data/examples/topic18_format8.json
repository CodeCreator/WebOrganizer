        "text":"Hero is the one facing her fears, working on resolving her stories and moving on to new ones she will create with full consciousness.\n\nHero is the one honoring me with his trust and confidence that I can help him travel faster on his road to lighter living.\n\nHeros are the ones who face their obstacles with great courage and transform them into a source of wisdom and power.\n\nHeros are creators of their own destiny.\n\nHere are some Hero\u2019s guidelines to ensure that our journeys are safe:\n\n1.) I will only accept shamanic tracking requests from Heros asking about their own journey. I will not accept any shamanic tracking requests which concern other people. If shamanic tracking request concerns a relationship with another, my shamanic tracking will solely focus on the Hero\u2019s side in such a relationship. We can only be brave for ourselves, we cannot be brave for others.\n\n2.) Heroes requesting shamanic tracking must be 18 years old and older. For Heroes aged 14-18, I will ask parental (or primary caretaker) consent, and the parent (or primary caretaker) will also be informed of the shamanic tracking feedback. For Heroes younger than 14, I will accept parental (or primary caretaker) request for shamanic tracking on their behalf, but only with the young Hero\u2019s soul permission. I am the sole person to decide if such permission is granted.\n\n3.) For adult Heros who cannot care for themselves independently,\u00a0I will accept primary caretaker\u2019s request for shamanic tracking on their behalf, but only with the adult Hero\u2019s soul permission. I\u00a0am the sole person to decide if such permission is granted.\n\n4.) I will accept shamanic tracking requests for fellow Hero animals made by the Hero animal owner but only with the Hero animal\u2019s soul permission. I am the sole person to decide if such permission is granted.\n\n5.) Shamanic tracking consists of scanning your energy body for any disruptions in its natural energy flow, and then tracking for the origin of disruptions. I will do the tracking on any issue you state you would like to work on, whether it is of a physical, emotional or spiritual nature. Shamanic tracking does not always provide direct responses to your stated issue. I will track your story around the stated issue for the way it lives in your body, rather than how it happened in your life (or lives). Shamanic tracking focuses on the underlying energetic pattern and causes of your issue, not on how the issue manifests in your life. This is because you may end up working endlessly on the physical, emotional or spiritual manifestations of the underlying energetic pattern, unless you resolve it.\n\n6.) Shamanic tracking is not shamanic healing work. Shamanic tracking provides insights to you on your stated issue and forms the basis for further shamanic or non-shamanic healing work. I may recommend further healing work to you to help you on your path.\n\n7.) My one time shamanic tracking fee is $200. It includes shamanic tracking on your stated issue and one hour Skype or phone session. I will answer any questions you may have and nothing is off-limts. The phone or Skype contact will be at your own cost.\n\n8.) If I feel called, I may offer you a gift, such as poem or photography, in addition to our session. This will be a personalized and unique gift that will energetically be only yours, and will never be offered as dedicated gift to anybody else. I will keep and own the copyright to all the poems and photography.\n\n9.) If it seems like there are too many terms and conditions, it is only to keep you and me safe and on the same page. One\u00a0can do energy work efficiently as long as one is impeccable.\u00a0I am impeccable. So are you.\n\n45 thoughts on \u201cthe Hero\u2019s journey\n\n    \u2022 Thanks so much for your support! I feel very blessed with all the interest and encouragement I have received so far! And I loooooove my work, it\u2019s very magical and helps heal soooo much quicker. Blessings to you!\n\n  1. Yes. I\u2019ve started exploring Shamanism \u2013 I was Journeying before I knew it was a Shamanic practice! I have done one soul retrieval for myself. My only hope is to be able to develop the practice to be able to help others \u2013 but I haven\u2019t had proper training, nor am likely too \ud83d\ude26 Well, we each have our own journey, and I\u2019m just starting mine, so you never know. I look forward to reading your blogs x\n\n    \u2022 Yes, soul retrievals sometimes happen spontaneously and we heal miraculously.\n      Shamanic training is very demanding, physically, emotionally and spiritually. But you know what they say \u2018when the student is ready, the teacher will appear\u2019. There are also many alternative health practices today and various ways of helping others. Good luck and let me know if I can help in any way\n\n    \u2022 thanks so much! people often think that the most difficult part of shamanic work is seeing energy, but actually the most difficult is to always make sure that, as a shaman, one has clear and strong ethics and that her work is impeccable.\n\n  2. I\u2019m glad you are doing this work. It\u2019s not easy, and it consumes one\u2019s energy, but it is rewarding on a heart and soul level. I wish you love with this. You probably don\u2019t need it, but if you ever want to discuss an anonymous case with an \u2018old-timer\u2019 in this area, I\u2019d be happy to assist at no cost whatsoever. You can email me anytime. I don\u2019t do this work anymore, but have a lot of experience to draw on. It seems as if you are doing a good job.\n\n    \u2022 Thank you so much! This is very graceful of you and yes, I would be happy to learn from you and share with you! I really do not pretend to know it all (but I do know my limits \ud83d\ude42 And yes, I do have passion and love for this work and my clients.\n\n  3. Wow, interesting blog you have here, and such interesting\/helpful work! I have a friend who studied similar things to what you\u2019ve mentioned here. He loved(s) it, so transformational. I look forward to reading a bit more\u2013\n\n  4. I have very much to learn here, such an intriguing subject. There is so much beauty and power in nature \u201cwe\u201d do not understand, but there are gifted people in every culture that have the talent to tap into this\u2026 \u2018qi\u2019 masters in China\/Asia, Native Americans in the States Shamans\u2026 The Hero\u2019s Journey is a necessary one, to find and make our own path through life. Noble people we meet along the way will be there to assist, which is your calling \ud83d\ude42 Very nice.\n\n  5. Thank you for stopping by my blog. I find your field of activity very interesting and \u201cnew\u201d at the same time. I\u2019ve only read about shamanic healing so far, and had no idea such a shamanic tracking could be possible. Thank you for sharing your journey on WP!\n\n    \u2022 Hi and thanks for taking the time to visit my blog.\n      Every shamanic healing session starts with tracking\u2026 Shamans usually start tracking even before you come to see them \ud83d\ude42\n      I have decided to focus on shamanic tracking because it\u2019s natural to me and I am good at it. Also, I am able to provide sufficient information in just one tracking.\n      On the other hand, shamanic healing takes longer and asks for more sessions and more regular follow-up. But it is not a clear cut line and even when doing only tracking for clients, I often do other shamanic work as well \ud83d\ude42\n\n  6. I appreciate you checking out my poetry site, and may you continue your journey with the beauty way, impeccable with your words, wholeness and love.\n\n    \u2022 I loved your writing! And especially your Lessons from your 30s \ud83d\ude42 I really appreciate courageous souls who are able to make tough decisions and change things for themselves (and those around them\u2026) Following your blog xox\n\n      \u2022 We have different worldviews and I respect your openness to give ear to others\u2019. The mature and the wise grow that way. Wishing you all things good. Thanks for the warm support and\u2026will be in touch. Diana\n\n  7. hmmm\u2026you appeared today at my blog\u2026tracking me in a different kind of way\u2026.and today when I chose to reveal something\u2026\u2026\u2019Ponders meaning\u2019\n\n    \u2022 You are welcome! I have obviously heard of the book and might have had it\/read it at some point, but have to admit I am one of those who read fast and forget fast \ud83d\ude42 Ours is the world of too much info\u2026 But I tend to retain some great lessons without always remembering where they come from hahaha\n      Do you recommend it? Thanks for visiting my blog xox\n\n    \u2022 Hi, thanks for your comment. I will tell you something people do not always like to hear: stop thinking in terms of scarcity. And here\u2019s why. It creates a pattern and binds us to the life we are living (if you wish read my post All you need, all the time https:\/\/shamanictracking.com\/2013\/02\/27\/all-you-need-all-the-time\/). We actually all have much more to offer than we think.\n      And here\u2019s how. If you really feel like you absolutely need something but cannot afford it, start saving even if it\u2019s little by little, or think about an alternative you can afford, or dare offering something else than money in exchange. You would be surprised but very many of us need or appreciate other things than money\u2026\n      I have already offered five free trackings to the readers of my blog, and have received some great energy exchanges from it. And I am more than happy with that \ud83d\ude42\n      I do not do shamanic tracking for my clients out of curiosity but out of need, and I believe that if we are meant to be working together it will happen in one way or another.\n      And finally, like you said, I do feel like I offer a lot for my fee. I do my work from a great place (and that requires a huge work on its own), I spend time tracking even before the session, I am to the point, and I often do follow-ups free of charge (because I care that my clients take our work further and continue to grow). I also often offer poems or photography as a gift \u2013 you can view some on my blog.\n      I know this is a really looong reply, and thanks for being the one who mentioned the \u2018can\u2019t afford\u2019 openly! Hope it helped all of us \ud83d\ude42 Great luck to you too and much love xox\n\n    \u2022 I just had to sh... (truncated)",

        "text":"what we believe\n\nWe Believe in \u2026\n\nThe Scriptures Inspired\n\nLife Church Meridian accepts the Bible as the revealed will of God, the all-sufficient rule of faith and practice, and for the purpose of maintaining general unity of statements of faith. The Scriptures both Old and New Testament are the inspired, infallible revelation of God to man and the authority of faith and conduct.\n\n\nThe One True God\n\nThe one true God has revealed Himself as the \u201cI AM,\u201d the Creator, and Redeemer of mankind.\n\nThe Deity of Jesus\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God.\u00a0 The Scriptures declare His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, death and resurrection, and ascension to the right hand of God.\n\nThe Salvation of Man\n\nMan\u2019s only hope is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ.\u00a0 Salvation is by faith through grace and demonstrated in repentance.\n\n\nOrdinances of the Church\n\nWater Baptism - By full immersion in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\n\nHoly Communion - The Lord\u2019s Supper consisting of the Body and Blood represented in the fruit of the vine and bread.\n\n\nThe Baptism of the Holy Spirit\n\nAccording to Acts 1:8 and Acts 2:4 with one of the signs being speaking in other tongues along with other gifts.\n\n\nThe act of separation from that which is evil, and dedication unto God.\n\n\nThe Church and Its Mission\n\nThe church is the representative of Jesus on earth and is to carry out the Great Commission.\n\nThe Ministry\n\nA divinely called and scripturally ordained minister has been provided by God to lead the church in evangelization, worship, building the body, and general leadership of the church.\n\nDivine Healing\n\nIs provided for today by the Scriptures and included in the atonement for our sins.\n\n\nThe Blessed Hope\n\nThe resurrection of the just is the blessed hope of the body of Christ.\n\n\nThe Millennial Reign\n\nThe second coming of Christ includes the rapture and a return to earth by Christ with His saints for a thousand-year reign.\n\n\nThe Final Judgment\n\nThere will be a final judgment at which all men will be judged.\n\n\nThe New Heaven and Earth\n\nAll of God\u2019s children will reign forever in a new heaven and a new earth.\n\n\nStatement of Marriage\n\nWe believe that because God our Creator established marriage as a sacred institution between one man and one woman, the idea that marriage is a covenant only between one man and one woman has been the traditional definition of marriage for all of human history (\u201cTraditional Definition of Marriage\u201d). Because of the longstanding importance of the Traditional Definition of Marriage to humans and their relationships and communities, and, most importantly, the fact that God has ordained that marriage be between one man and one woman, as clearly conveyed in God\u2019s inerrant Scriptures, including for example in Matthew 19:4-6 where in speaking about marriage Jesus referred to the fact that \u201che which made them at the beginning made them male and female,\u201d the Church hereby creates this policy, which shall be known as the \u201cMarriage Policy.\u201d\n\nUnder this Church\u2019s Marriage Policy, the Traditional Definition of Marriage is the only definition of marriage that will be recognized or accepted. No elder, officer, employee, servant, agent, or any person, corporation, organization, or entity under the direction or control of this Church shall commit any act or omission, or make any decision whatever, that would be inconsistent with, or that could be perceived by any person to be inconsistent with, full support of this Church\u2019s Marriage Policy and strict adherence to the Traditional Definition of Marriage rather than any alternative to the Traditional Definition of Marriage.\n\nThis Church\u2019s Marriage Policy specifically prohibits acts or omissions including but not limited to permitting any Church assets or property, whether real property, personal property, intangible property, or any property or asset of any kind that is subject to the direction or control of the Church, to be used in any manner that would be or could be perceived by any person to be inconsistent with this Church\u2019s Marriage Policy or the Traditional Definition of Marriage, including but not limited to permitting any church facilities to be used by any person, organization, corporation, or group that would or might use such facilities to convey, intentionally or by implication, what might be perceived as a favorable impression about any definition of marriage other than the Traditional Definition of Marriage.\u00a0 Life Church Meridian Bylaws 5 of 24 .\n\nTraditional Marriages will be performed only for Life Church Meridian members after the couple has completed the Life Church Pre-Marital Counseling Program either through the Life Group Ministry or individual counseling.\n\nWe believe this Church\u2019s Marriage Policy is based upon God\u2019s will for human life as conveyed to us through the Holy Scriptures, upon which this Church has been founded and anchored, and this Marriage Policy shall not be subject to change through popular vote; referendum; prevailing opinion of members or the general public; influence of or interpretation by any government authority, agency, or official action; or legal developments on the local, state, or federal level.",

        "text":"1. The Word of God\n\nWe believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the inspired, inerrant and infallible Word of God, inerrant in the original writings, complete as the revelation of God\u2019s will for salvation, and the supreme and final authority in all matters to which they speak. \u00a0 (2 Peter 1:20-21: 2 Timothy 3:16-17)\n\n\n2. The Trinity\n\nWe believe in one God, Creator and Sustainer of all things, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; that these are equal and perfect in every divine attribute and that they execute distinct and harmonious offices in the work of creation, providence, and redemption. \u00a0(John 1:1-3; Mark 12:28-31; 2 Corinthians 13:14; 1 Peter 1:2; Matthew 28:18-20)\n\n\n3. God the Father\n\nWe believe in God the Father, an infinite, personal Spirit, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power, and love. He concerns Himself in the affairs of men and women, hears and answers prayer, and saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ. (John 4:23-24; Ephesians 1:3-14; John 3:16; 14:15-17)\n\n\n4. Jesus Christ\n\nWe believe that Jesus Christ is God\u2019s eternal Son, and fully possesses the same nature and attributes as God the Father and God the Holy Spirit.\u00a0 He is not only true God, but true Man, conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary.\u00a0 We believe in His sinless life, His substitutionary atonement, His bodily resurrection from the dead, His ascension into heaven, His priestly intercession on behalf of His people, and His personal, visible, pre-millennial return from heaven. (Luke 1:26-38; Colossians 2:9-10; Acts 2:32-33; 1 John 2:1-2; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18)\n\n\n5. Holy Spirit\n\nWe believe in the Holy Spirit, co-equal with the Father and the Son.\u00a0 We believe in His personality and His work in regeneration, sanctification, and preservation.His ministry is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, and implement Christ\u2019s work of redeeming the lost. He also empowers the believer for godly living and service through the giving of spiritual gifts. (Ephesians 2:19-22; Romans 8:9-11; John 16:7-11, 16:12-15; 1 John 2:27; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; Ephesians 1:13-14)\n\n\n6. Humanity\n\nWe believe God created humanity, male and female, in the image of God and free from sin.\u00a0 As a result of the fall, all persons are born in the image of Adam and sinners by nature and are, therefore, spiritually dead.\u00a0 We also believe that the Holy Spirit regenerates those who repent of rejecting Christ, and trust Him as Savior. (The Roman Road: 3:23; 6:23; 5:8; 10:13 is a Gospel presentation; Genesis 1:26-31; Titus 3:4-7; John 3:1-8; Ephesians 2:1-3; Colossians 2:13-14; Luke 18:18-19; Romans 1:18-32; 3:9-18)\n\n\n7. Salvation\n\nWe believe in salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.\u00a0 This salvation is based upon the sovereign grace of God, and was purchased by Christ on the cross, and received through faith by believing in His name, apart from any human merit, works, or ritual. (Ephesians 2:8-10; John 1:12).\n\n\n8. Sanctification\n\nWe believe salvation and sanctification are the work of God\u2019s sovereign grace.\u00a0 Sanctification is a state of separation unto God; all believers enter into this state when they are born of God.\u00a0 This is a once-for-ever separation, eternally unto God.\u00a0 It is an intricate part of our salvation, our connection with Christ.\u00a0 \u201cBut of Him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption\u201d (1 Corinthians 1:30).\u00a0 The mystery of sanctification is that the perfections of Jesus Christ are imparted to us, not gradually, but instantly.\u00a0 Sanctification is Christ in every believer. God has good works for every born-again child of His to do, which will glorify the Lord. We believe that rewards are promised according to the faithfulness of each believer in his service to God, and that these rewards will be given at the judgment seat of Christ. (Hebrews 10:10-14; 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24; 2 Corinthians 7:1; Ephesians 4:20-24; 2:8-10; Titus 2:11-14; 2 Peter 1:5-11; Galatians 5:16-26; 1 Timothy 6:17-19; James 2:18-26; 1 Corinthians 3:10-15; 9:24-27; 2 Corinthians 5:10)\n\n\n9. Eternal Security\n\nWe believe that because of God\u2019s unchanging purpose, saving grace, divine gift of eternal life, and the unending intercession of Christ, and the indwelling Holy Spirit, we and all true believers everywhere, once born again shall be kept saved forever.\u00a0 If God has saved you, then you cannot lose it. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian. (John 10:27-29; Romans 8:29-39; 2 Timothy 1:12; Jude 24-25; 1 Peter 1:3-5)\n\n\n10. The Church\n\nWe believe that the Church is the spiritual body of which Christ is the head, and composed of all persons who have saving faith in Jesus Christ.\u00a0 This body expresses itself in local churches comprised of believers in Christ.\u00a0 The ordinances of the local church are believer\u2019s baptism by immersion and the Lord\u2019s Supper.\u00a0 We believe that each local church is self-governing in function and free from interference.\u00a0\nWe believe that all believers (both men and women) have the privilege and right of direct access to God through Jesus Christ, and that all believers are directly\u00a0 responsible to God in matters of faith and life. Further, all believers (both men and women) are made in His image (see belief #6), are saved by grace through faith (see belief #7), are gifted for service (see belief #5), and are being conformed to the likeness of Christ (see belief #8). However, all believers do not have the same role in the church. Men and women differ, in that women are not to exercise authority over men, and women are specifically entrusted with the role of encouraging younger women. We believe that church leadership should be comprised of a plurality of spiritually qualified males, appointed by the congregation, some of whom may be ordained. (Ephesians 1:20-23; 4:1-6; Acts 2:41-47; Matthew 28:18-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26; 1 Timothy 2:5-8; Galatians 2:1-10; Acts 14:21-23; Acts 20:17-38; 1 Timothy 5:17-25; Colossians 3:14-17; Romans 14:10-12; 1 Timothy 3:10; 2:9-15; 1 Corinthians 11:2-12; 14:34-35; Titus 2:3-5)\n\n\n11. Eternal Things\n\nWe believe that Jesus Christ will personally come again in power and glory to receive the Church to Himself and to establish His millennial kingdom.\u00a0 We believe in the bodily resurrection of the saved and the lost, and that Jesus Christ will judge both living and the dead.\u00a0 We believe that the saved will live with Christ eternally in heaven, while the lost will be condemned to eternal punishment in hell. (Revelation 20:1-6; 20:11-15; 1 Corinthians 15:35-50; 15:51-58; 2 Thessalonians 1:3-10)\n\n\n12. Marriage, Gender, and Sexuality\n\nThe term \u201cmarriage\u201d has only one meaning: a covenant between one man and one woman, n a single exclusive union, by which their status changes from two individuals to one flesh as God joins them together.\u00a0This covenant creates a new family such that their lifelong primary human loyalty is now to one another before anyone else. It is an earthly covenant between one man and one woman that God created and sanctioned to image the unbreakable heavenly covenant between Christ and His Church, therefore intended not to be broken by anything but death. The authority of Scripture witnesses to the nature of biblical marriage as uniquely bound to the complementarity of man and woman. The Lord Jesus Himself said that marriage was created by God from the beginning, so no human institution has the authority to redefine marriage any more than a human institution has the authority to redefine the gospel, which marriage mysteriously reflects.\u00a0\u00a0\nRegarding gender, God wonderfully and immutably creates each person as male or female. These two distinct, complementary genders together reflect the image and nature of God. Rejection of one\u2019s biological gender is a rejection of the image of God within that person.\u00a0\nGod created sex as a gift to be enjoyed within the covenant of marriage. We believe that God intends sexual expression to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other. We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of this marriage covenant. We believe that the exercise of sexual expression outside the biblical definition of marriage in any manner, including but not limited to adultery, homosexuality, premarital sex, bisexual conduct, and use of pornography, is contradictory to God\u2019s design for sexuality and marriage.\nWe will uphold God\u2019s standards in marriage, gender, and sexuality, while also extending grace to those who have fallen in these areas and are repentant. (Genesis 1:26-27; Genesis 2:15-25; Psalm 139; Malachi 2:16; Matthew 5:27-32; Matthew 19:3-12; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 6:18; 7:2-5; Ephesians 5:21-33; Hebrews 13:4; 1 Timothy 1:10)",
