        "text":"Approved by the Elder Board on August 17, 2016\n\n\nThe purpose of this Statement of Position is to explain what we believe the Bible teaches about baptism by first answering some basic questions about baptism and then addressing other questions that people often have about baptism. We acknowledge that there are views about baptism other than the one described below held by other Christians; however, the view described below represents our view, which is sometimes referred to as \u201cbeliever baptism.\u201d\n\nBasic questions about baptism\n\nWhat is baptism?\n\nBaptism is a public act in which a believer is immersed in water in order to symbolize:\n\n  1. Their association (or identification) with Jesus\u2019 death, burial and resurrection (Romans 6:1-10);\n  2. Their repentance of their sins, and Jesus\u2019 forgiveness \u2013 or washing away \u2013 of their sins (Acts 2:38); and\n  3. Their desire to be a lifelong learner (i.e., disciple or follower) of Jesus (Matthew 28:18-20).\n\nWho should be baptized?\n\nOnly those who have placed their faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior should be baptized (Acts 2:38, 41; 8:12; 8:35-37; 9:6, 18; 10:47; 16:14-15; 16:31-33; 18:8). In other words, only believers should be baptized.\n\nWhy should a person be baptized?\n\nEvery believer should be baptized, because:\n\n\nOther questions about baptism\n\nDoes baptism save a person?\n\nBaptism does not save a person. Salvation comes by grace through faith in Jesus alone, apart from any merit or work; and apart from any ceremonies (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28; Romans 1:16; Titus 3:5-7; 1 Corinthians 1:14-17). We believe that the preponderance of Scripture teaches that baptism is a confirming symbol \u2013 as discussed above \u2013 for an individual who personally confesses faith in Jesus Christ (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Acts 2:38, 41; 8:12; 8:35-37; 9:18; 10:47; 16:14-15, 31-33; 18:8).\n\nIs baptism required at BACC to be a Ministry Partner (MP)?\n\nAt Bay Area, baptism is a requirement for Ministry Partnership. If a believer has never been baptized, then he\/she will need to be baptized in order to become a MP. If a person was baptized as an infant and has never been baptized as a believer, then we encourage him\/her to be baptized as a believer, but welcome him\/her as a MP provided he\/she rejects the notion that their baptism as an infant conferred merit with God or saving grace in the act itself. BACC does not perform infant baptisms.\n\nMust a believer have been immersed in water in order for their baptism to be accepted for MP purposes?\n\nThere are good arguments for three different modes of baptism: sprinkling, pouring and immersion. We practice immersion, because we think it best pictures our identification with Christ\u2019s death, burial and resurrection (Romans 6:1-11). However, we always want our emphasis to be on the heart attitude of those being baptized. If a believer was baptized in another church in which sprinkling or pouring was the mode of baptism used, we will accept that for MP purposes.\n\nWhat is \u201cSpirit Baptism\u201d or \u201cBaptism of the Holy Spirit\u201d?\n\nWe believe that at the moment a person expresses saving faith in Jesus, he\/she is baptized in the Holy Spirit and made a part of the universal body of Christ (His Church) \u2013 1 Corinthians 12:12-13; Ephesians 1:13; Ephesians 4:4-6; Galatians 3:27-29. This \u201cSpirit Baptism\u201d happens at the moment of belief and is invisible (i.e., we don\u2019t see it happen). \u201cSymbolic\/water baptism,\u201d on the other hand, as discussed above, is an act that is done after one comes to faith in Jesus and symbolizes this invisible truth of being placed into the body of Christ. Thus, we sometimes will say, [water] baptism is \u201can outward expression of an inward reality,\u201d meaning [water] baptism is a public act that symbolizes something that has already taken place inside a person \u2013 that they believe in Jesus and the Holy Spirit now lives inside them.",

        "text":"Daniel P. Barron\n\nStatement of Faith\n\n\nThis is a mirror of \"Statement of Faith\" by Darwin Fish.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all articles on atruechurch.info are written by Darwin Fish and all Scripture quotations are from the NKJV.\n\nFor a pdf of the pamphlet that we pass out, click here.\n\n\nHe who despises the word will be destroyed, but he who fears the commandment will be rewarded.\u00a0i\n\nWe believe whatever the Holy Bible says.\u00a0ii For how we do this, please see Our Hermeneutics and Judging. Scripture is our first and last and everything in between authority. The Word of God is our life and our salvation.\u00a0iii By it He has given us eternal life, and our hope is in His Word.\u00a0iv\n\nIf it can be shown from the Bible that we are wrong on something, we gladly, eagerly, and lovingly accept such correction.\u00a0v\n\nFor the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light; reproofs of instruction are the way of life.\u00a0vi\n\nHe who keeps instruction is in the way of life, but he who refuses correction goes astray.\u00a0vii\n\n31 The ear that hears the rebukes of life will abide among the wise.\n32 He who disdains instruction despises his own soul, but he who heeds rebuke gets understanding.\n33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom, and before honor is humility.\u00a0viii\n\nAnd if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.\u00a0ix\n\nMost who \"correct\" us do so with their own opinion, which is worthless.\n\nThe LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.\u00a0x\n\nOr, people \"correct\" us with man's religious tradition, like Catholic, or Protestant, or otherwise, which is also worthless and damning.\u00a0xi These things are not according to Christ,\u00a0xii and so we have no ear for them. If we did, we would be rejecting God's Truth, and we flatly refuse to do so;\u00a0xiii for that leads to nowhere but hell.\u00a0xiv But, Scripture is \"wholesome words\"\u00a0xv and makes a man \"complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.\"\u00a0xvi If we are found in error before the Word, by the grace of God we will repent.\u00a0xvii As it is written,\n\nHe who is of God hears God's words.\u00a0xvii\n\nFinally, this \"Statement of Faith\" is written so that you might know, in brief form, some of the particulars of what we believe, and that you too might believe His Word and be saved. Many claim to believe the Bible. Very very few actually do. And this is our first point.\n\nI. Few\n\nFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.\u00a0xviii\n\nWe believe the Bible predicts and warns about a massive false Christianity for the days in which we live. Matthew 7:13-27; 1 Timothy 4:1-3; 2 Timothy 3:1-5; 4:3-4; and 2 Peter 2:1-2 all warn of prevailing deceit within \"Christianity.\" Catholicism, Protestantism,\u00a0xix evangelicalism, and many other \"isms\" taking on the name of \"Christ,\" well exemplify the deceit of this age. The entire world is deceived by Satan.\u00a0xx Much of it is in the name of Christ. The result of this deception is illustrated in Jesus' words found in Luke 18:8:\n\nNevertheless, when the Son of the Man comes will He really find the faith upon the earth?\u00a0xxi\n\nJesus' words depict things are going to be very bad! He questions if the faith will even be on the planet! In Noah's day, it was only eight people out of the entire population of the earth that were saved.\u00a0xxii Jesus questioned whether there would be even one when He returns.\u00a0xxiii\n\nWe have seen this despair graphically before our own eyes both theologically\u00a0xxiv and practically.\u00a0xxv The truth is not embraced and lies are, as it is written,\n\nSatan, who deceives the whole world.\u00a0xxvi\n\nFor examples of some of this deception, please see our false teachers page.\n\nII. God\n\nOh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!\u00a0xxvii\n\n\"My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,\" says the LORD.\u00a0xxviii\n\nMuch of the deception comes via false teaching about God. The God of the Bible\u00a0xxiv is not taught in churches today.\u00a0xxix What is typically taught is a false God, a false Christ, and a false \"Trinity.\" We expose the false Trinity in point \"V. An Unholy Creed\" in our article entitled \"He Is Holy Gods\" from a literal translation of Joshua 24:19. We expose the false Christs in various articles on false teachers. The real Christ, the God of the Bible, is as follows:\n\nGood and upright is the LORD.\u201d\u00a0xxx He loves everyone,\u00a0xxxi for Jesus Is Love.\u00a0xxxii Yet, He also hates everyone.\u00a0xxxiii\n\nConversely, the false Jesus varies, but it is usually \"another Jesus\"\u00a0xlviii that is not the Scripture Himself.\u00a0xlix Typically, the false Jesus doesn't kill people,\u00a0xxxiv doesn't hate people,\u00a0l doesn't destine people to hell,\u00a0xli doesn't create people to destroy them,\u00a0xl doesn't prevent people from being saved,\u00a0li doesn't cause people to sin,\u00a0lii doesn't cause bad things to happen,\u00a0liii doesn't deceive people,\u00a0xxxvi didn't die for everyone,\u00a0liv etc., or some combination thereof. Yet, the real Jesus is the Scriptures,\u00a0lv has done and does all these things.\u00a0lvi\n\nBut, the false \"Jesus,\" typically taught, is also usually one that was not a human before John 1:14. Yet, the Jesus Christ of Scripture is, and always has been, God in the Flesh,\u00a0lvii \"slain from the foundation of the world.\"\u00a0lviii He was virgin born twice,\u00a0lix and everything was created by Him and for Him.\u00a0lx\n\nThe false Christ is also typically a false way, a theological broad way that accepts those who preach false gospels,\u00a0lxi like the false gospels of Calvinism and Arminianism. These gospels are different on five key points, yet \"Christians\" accept both kinds of \"brothers in Christ.\" In contrast, the real Christ is the theological narrow Way\u00a0lxii of \"the Truth.\" He only accepts people in the faith who walk in Truth and \"call on the Lord out of a pure heart.\"\u00a0lxiii Those who don't are those of whom Scripture commands,\n\nfrom such people turn away!\u00a0lxiv\n\nFurthermore, we believe Jesus, the one and only true God\u00a0lxv of the Bible, is eternally perfect,\u00a0lxvi and \"He is Holy Gods\" as Joshua explicitly stated in Joshua 24:19.\n\nFor in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.\u00a0lxvii\n\nFor more on that, please see our article \"He Is Holy Gods.\"\n\nIII. Miscellaneous Controversial Issues\n\n  \u2022 We believe drinking alcohol in moderation is not wrong.\u00a0lxxxv\n  \u2022 We believe those who commit suicide go to hell.\u00a0lxxxvi\n  \u2022 We believe gambling is not wrong, but to gamble, because you are not content and want more, is sin.\u00a0lxxxvii\n  \u2022 We believe Scriputure does not condemn masturbation. Although it is typically done in wickedness,\u00a0lxxxviii it can be done in godliness.\u00a0lxxxix\n  \u2022 We believe the Bible does not condemn slavery,\u00a0xc even though it is illegal in the USA.\u00a0xci\n  \u2022 We believe smoking is not condemned in Scripture, but addiction is.\u00a0xcii\n  \u2022 We believe most debt is ungodly.\u00a0xciii\n  \u2022 We believe the Bible does not condemn polygamy,\u00a0xciv even though it is illegal in the USA,\u00a0xci which illustrates America's idea of what is moral or not is quite twisted.\u00a0xcv\n  \u2022 We believe there are fire breathing dragons called Leviathan.\u00a0xcvi\n  \u2022 We believe during the 1000 year reign of Christ on earth,\u00a0xcvii God will bring back from the dead evil Levites of the past to serve in His temple.\u00a0xcviii\n  \u2022 We believe sexual intercourse during menstruation is an evil practice.\u00a0xcix\n  \u2022 We believe the answer to \"eternal security\" is both \"yes\" and \"no.\"\u00a0c\n\nIV. Salvation\n\nFor since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen any God besides You, Who acts for the one who waits for Him. You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, who remembers You in Your ways. You are indeed angry, for we have sinned - in these ways we continue; and we need to be saved.\u00a0ci\n\nEven though God has hated\u00a0l and predestined the majority of mankind to hell,\u00a0cii He nonetheless desires to have mercy on all people.\u00a0ciii This is why He has confined all of mankind under sin.\u00a0civ In other words, He has made everyone a sinner\u00a0cv with a desperately wicked heart,\u00a0cvi \"that He might have mercy on all.\"\u00a0xxxix\n\nEveryone needs to be saved,\u00a0cvii because God hates sinners.\u00a0xxxiii He burns them in hell forever,\u00a0cviii if they don't repent;\u00a0cix even though they can't repent, unless He grants them repentance.\u00a0cx Nevertheless, everyone is in need of God's mercy and is in great need of being saved from His wrath.\n\nThankfully, God is Love,\u00a0cxi and as the above stands true, so does John 3:16:\n\nFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\n\nThe only begotten Son is Jesus Christ, who is the Word of God, the Bible, the Scriptures.\u00a0cxii Therefore, only those who believe the Scriptures\u00a0cxiii have eternal life, as Revelation 21:8 explicitly states,\n\n\"the unbelieving . . . shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone.\"\n\nAnyone who does not believe what the Bible says, \"does not believe God\" and \"has made Him a liar\"\u00a0cxiv and provokes His wrath.\u00a0i For more on being saved, please see our article, \"What Must I Do To Be Saved?\" For our view of justification, please see our article entitled, \"MacArthur on Justification and Sanctification.\" For our view of works, please see \"Not By Works.\"\n\nV. One Way\n\nI have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.\u00a0cxv\n\nWe believe there is only one way to Heaven and it is through faith in God's Word, the Truth.\u00a0cxvi We believe there is only one true faith.\u00a0cxvii All other faiths, called Christian or otherwise, are false and lead to nowhere but hell. All who are in the one true faith have the same teacher\u00a0cxviii and believe the same things. They have the same theology, because they all truly believe whatever the Bi... (truncated)",

        "text":"Hero is the one facing her fears, working on resolving her stories and moving on to new ones she will create with full consciousness.\n\nHero is the one honoring me with his trust and confidence that I can help him travel faster on his road to lighter living.\n\nHeros are the ones who face their obstacles with great courage and transform them into a source of wisdom and power.\n\nHeros are creators of their own destiny.\n\nHere are some Hero\u2019s guidelines to ensure that our journeys are safe:\n\n1.) I will only accept shamanic tracking requests from Heros asking about their own journey. I will not accept any shamanic tracking requests which concern other people. If shamanic tracking request concerns a relationship with another, my shamanic tracking will solely focus on the Hero\u2019s side in such a relationship. We can only be brave for ourselves, we cannot be brave for others.\n\n2.) Heroes requesting shamanic tracking must be 18 years old and older. For Heroes aged 14-18, I will ask parental (or primary caretaker) consent, and the parent (or primary caretaker) will also be informed of the shamanic tracking feedback. For Heroes younger than 14, I will accept parental (or primary caretaker) request for shamanic tracking on their behalf, but only with the young Hero\u2019s soul permission. I am the sole person to decide if such permission is granted.\n\n3.) For adult Heros who cannot care for themselves independently,\u00a0I will accept primary caretaker\u2019s request for shamanic tracking on their behalf, but only with the adult Hero\u2019s soul permission. I\u00a0am the sole person to decide if such permission is granted.\n\n4.) I will accept shamanic tracking requests for fellow Hero animals made by the Hero animal owner but only with the Hero animal\u2019s soul permission. I am the sole person to decide if such permission is granted.\n\n5.) Shamanic tracking consists of scanning your energy body for any disruptions in its natural energy flow, and then tracking for the origin of disruptions. I will do the tracking on any issue you state you would like to work on, whether it is of a physical, emotional or spiritual nature. Shamanic tracking does not always provide direct responses to your stated issue. I will track your story around the stated issue for the way it lives in your body, rather than how it happened in your life (or lives). Shamanic tracking focuses on the underlying energetic pattern and causes of your issue, not on how the issue manifests in your life. This is because you may end up working endlessly on the physical, emotional or spiritual manifestations of the underlying energetic pattern, unless you resolve it.\n\n6.) Shamanic tracking is not shamanic healing work. Shamanic tracking provides insights to you on your stated issue and forms the basis for further shamanic or non-shamanic healing work. I may recommend further healing work to you to help you on your path.\n\n7.) My one time shamanic tracking fee is $200. It includes shamanic tracking on your stated issue and one hour Skype or phone session. I will answer any questions you may have and nothing is off-limts. The phone or Skype contact will be at your own cost.\n\n8.) If I feel called, I may offer you a gift, such as poem or photography, in addition to our session. This will be a personalized and unique gift that will energetically be only yours, and will never be offered as dedicated gift to anybody else. I will keep and own the copyright to all the poems and photography.\n\n9.) If it seems like there are too many terms and conditions, it is only to keep you and me safe and on the same page. One\u00a0can do energy work efficiently as long as one is impeccable.\u00a0I am impeccable. So are you.\n\n45 thoughts on \u201cthe Hero\u2019s journey\n\n    \u2022 Thanks so much for your support! I feel very blessed with all the interest and encouragement I have received so far! And I loooooove my work, it\u2019s very magical and helps heal soooo much quicker. Blessings to you!\n\n  1. Yes. I\u2019ve started exploring Shamanism \u2013 I was Journeying before I knew it was a Shamanic practice! I have done one soul retrieval for myself. My only hope is to be able to develop the practice to be able to help others \u2013 but I haven\u2019t had proper training, nor am likely too \ud83d\ude26 Well, we each have our own journey, and I\u2019m just starting mine, so you never know. I look forward to reading your blogs x\n\n    \u2022 Yes, soul retrievals sometimes happen spontaneously and we heal miraculously.\n      Shamanic training is very demanding, physically, emotionally and spiritually. But you know what they say \u2018when the student is ready, the teacher will appear\u2019. There are also many alternative health practices today and various ways of helping others. Good luck and let me know if I can help in any way\n\n    \u2022 thanks so much! people often think that the most difficult part of shamanic work is seeing energy, but actually the most difficult is to always make sure that, as a shaman, one has clear and strong ethics and that her work is impeccable.\n\n  2. I\u2019m glad you are doing this work. It\u2019s not easy, and it consumes one\u2019s energy, but it is rewarding on a heart and soul level. I wish you love with this. You probably don\u2019t need it, but if you ever want to discuss an anonymous case with an \u2018old-timer\u2019 in this area, I\u2019d be happy to assist at no cost whatsoever. You can email me anytime. I don\u2019t do this work anymore, but have a lot of experience to draw on. It seems as if you are doing a good job.\n\n    \u2022 Thank you so much! This is very graceful of you and yes, I would be happy to learn from you and share with you! I really do not pretend to know it all (but I do know my limits \ud83d\ude42 And yes, I do have passion and love for this work and my clients.\n\n  3. Wow, interesting blog you have here, and such interesting\/helpful work! I have a friend who studied similar things to what you\u2019ve mentioned here. He loved(s) it, so transformational. I look forward to reading a bit more\u2013\n\n  4. I have very much to learn here, such an intriguing subject. There is so much beauty and power in nature \u201cwe\u201d do not understand, but there are gifted people in every culture that have the talent to tap into this\u2026 \u2018qi\u2019 masters in China\/Asia, Native Americans in the States Shamans\u2026 The Hero\u2019s Journey is a necessary one, to find and make our own path through life. Noble people we meet along the way will be there to assist, which is your calling \ud83d\ude42 Very nice.\n\n  5. Thank you for stopping by my blog. I find your field of activity very interesting and \u201cnew\u201d at the same time. I\u2019ve only read about shamanic healing so far, and had no idea such a shamanic tracking could be possible. Thank you for sharing your journey on WP!\n\n    \u2022 Hi and thanks for taking the time to visit my blog.\n      Every shamanic healing session starts with tracking\u2026 Shamans usually start tracking even before you come to see them \ud83d\ude42\n      I have decided to focus on shamanic tracking because it\u2019s natural to me and I am good at it. Also, I am able to provide sufficient information in just one tracking.\n      On the other hand, shamanic healing takes longer and asks for more sessions and more regular follow-up. But it is not a clear cut line and even when doing only tracking for clients, I often do other shamanic work as well \ud83d\ude42\n\n  6. I appreciate you checking out my poetry site, and may you continue your journey with the beauty way, impeccable with your words, wholeness and love.\n\n    \u2022 I loved your writing! And especially your Lessons from your 30s \ud83d\ude42 I really appreciate courageous souls who are able to make tough decisions and change things for themselves (and those around them\u2026) Following your blog xox\n\n      \u2022 We have different worldviews and I respect your openness to give ear to others\u2019. The mature and the wise grow that way. Wishing you all things good. Thanks for the warm support and\u2026will be in touch. Diana\n\n  7. hmmm\u2026you appeared today at my blog\u2026tracking me in a different kind of way\u2026.and today when I chose to reveal something\u2026\u2026\u2019Ponders meaning\u2019\n\n    \u2022 You are welcome! I have obviously heard of the book and might have had it\/read it at some point, but have to admit I am one of those who read fast and forget fast \ud83d\ude42 Ours is the world of too much info\u2026 But I tend to retain some great lessons without always remembering where they come from hahaha\n      Do you recommend it? Thanks for visiting my blog xox\n\n    \u2022 Hi, thanks for your comment. I will tell you something people do not always like to hear: stop thinking in terms of scarcity. And here\u2019s why. It creates a pattern and binds us to the life we are living (if you wish read my post All you need, all the time https:\/\/shamanictracking.com\/2013\/02\/27\/all-you-need-all-the-time\/). We actually all have much more to offer than we think.\n      And here\u2019s how. If you really feel like you absolutely need something but cannot afford it, start saving even if it\u2019s little by little, or think about an alternative you can afford, or dare offering something else than money in exchange. You would be surprised but very many of us need or appreciate other things than money\u2026\n      I have already offered five free trackings to the readers of my blog, and have received some great energy exchanges from it. And I am more than happy with that \ud83d\ude42\n      I do not do shamanic tracking for my clients out of curiosity but out of need, and I believe that if we are meant to be working together it will happen in one way or another.\n      And finally, like you said, I do feel like I offer a lot for my fee. I do my work from a great place (and that requires a huge work on its own), I spend time tracking even before the session, I am to the point, and I often do follow-ups free of charge (because I care that my clients take our work further and continue to grow). I also often offer poems or photography as a gift \u2013 you can view some on my blog.\n      I know this is a really looong reply, and thanks for being the one who mentioned the \u2018can\u2019t afford\u2019 openly! Hope it helped all of us \ud83d\ude42 Great luck to you too and much love xox\n\n    \u2022 I just had to sh... (truncated)",

        "text":"Adapted from the New Hampshire Confession of Faith of 1833\n\n\nWe believe; Only the 66 books, consisting of the Old & New Testaments, in their original manuscripts, are the authoritative Words of God. Written by men divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:21) Sufficient for all we need for faith and practice. (2 Timothy 3:15-17) It has God for it\u2019s ultimate author. (2 Peter 1:21) Its theme is the glory of God in the person and work of Jesus Christ demonstrated through the plan of redemption as decreed by the triune God before the foundations of the world. (Luke 4:21) It\u2019s content is only truth without any mixture of error in the original manuscripts. (2 Timothy 3:15-17) It reveals the principles by which God will judge mankind. (Matthew 5-7) It is eternal. (Isa. 40:8, John 1:1-5) It is the true center of Christianity; union with God and fellowship with the saints. (1 John 1:3) It is the highest authority by which all human; conduct, creeds, and opinions should be measured. (Heb. 4:12)\n\n\nThere is only one true, infinite, and supremely holy God. (Gen. 1:1, Deut. 6:4) He is an intelligent Spirit. (John 1:1) In the unity of the singular God-Head there are three distinct persons; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; co-existent, co-eternal, consubstantial and equal in every divine perfection. (Gen. 1:1, Matthew 3:13-17) God, in the person of Jesus Christ is the Creator, Sustainer, and supreme Ruler of the universe. (Colossians 1:16-17, Matthew 5,6, & 7, Heb. 1:1-2) He is equally transcendent in nature and majesty, but immanent and close at hand to all, especially to his children. (Isaiah 55:8-9, John 8:23 \/ John 1:14, Philippians 2:6, Romans 1:20) He is worthy of all love, from which flows; obedience, honor, trust, and praise. (Psalm 145:3, 1 John, Deut. 6, Micah 6:8, Hosea 6:6) All things are accomplished according to the council of His own will. (Ephesians 1:11-12) He does all things for the ultimate purpose of manifesting His own glory. (Isaiah 48:9-11) Each member of this Trinity executes distinct and harmonious offices in the work of redemption.\n\n  1. Father: Designer \/ Director\n  2. Son: Creator \/ Redeemer \/ Judge\n  3. Spirit: Sealer \/ Teacher\n\n\nJesus is completely man and completely God. (John 1:14, Colossians 2:19) Jesus is the \u201cWord\u201d or \u201cLogos\u201d made flesh. (John 1:1-4) This Jesus is the long awaited Chosen One of God the Father to redeem His chosen people from their sin. (Hebrews 1:1-2) He is the \u201csecond-person\u201d of the God-head. (Matthew 3:17) Jesus eternally proceeds from the Father, meaning that Jesus never \u201cbecame\u201d the Son or was every created to be the Son. Rather, eternally Jesus has been coming forth from the Father as the Son; thus choosing to be subordinate to the Father. (John 5:18) Although He chose to be subordinate to the Father He is in no way lesser in stature or glory. (Rom. 11:36) Jesus\u2019 vicarious sinless and law-satisfying life won an eternally valuable righteousness that is imputed to those who repent and believe in Him alone. (2 Cor. 5:21) Jesus\u2019 vicarious death on the cross propitiated the wrath of God, and provides expiation of guilt and shame for those who repent and believe in Him alone for their rescue. (2 Cor. 5:21) Jesus\u2019 victorious resurrection from the dead, validates His person, His work, as well as His message. It furthermore promises to His children the reality of their ultimate resurrection and the sharing of the glory of God for all eternity with Jesus. (1 Cor. 15:17-19) He holds the offices of; Prophet, Priest, and King.\n\n  1. Being our Prophet, He is the authoritative herald of the Words of God.\n  2. Being our Priest, He is the one mediator that not only offers the sacrifice, but is the sacrifice for our transgression. He therefore intercedes for us with the Father, fulfilling the role of our High-Priest.\n  3. Being the King, He rules and reigns currently and will continue to do so forevermore.\n\n\nThe Spirit, with the Father and the Son, is eternal God. The Spirit was present at the beginning, before the universe was made. He was the power that hovered over the watery chaos and the One who, through the agency of the Son and according to the Father\u2019s plan, brought order and established all created things (John 1:3). Jesus promised to send to His people One distinct from both the Father and the Son. This One is \u201canother Helper,\u201d namely, the Holy Spirit. (John 14:16) The Spirit is distinct from the Father and the Son not because He possesses an inferior essence; rather, His distinction lies in His chosen procession from the Father and the Son. The Spirit brings conviction of sin and illumination to the eyes and hearts of those who are in need of salvation. (Phil. 1:6) The Spirit is the One who reveals Christ to the elect and seals them for the day of Judgement. (1 Cor. 2:10)\n\n\nHumanity was created perfectly as male and female and in complete compliance to the law of God. (Gen. 1:31) God continues to create both men and women through procreation and by virtue of His sovereign will God has predetermined the biological gender of all peoples therefore revealing His perfect will for our lives in this area through this general revelation. Therefore no one has the right to alter their gender from what God has biologically determined through conception and birth. (Genesis 5:2) God\u2019s great creation of mankind however, through voluntary transgression, fell from their original sinless condition in which He created them. (Gen. 3:1-7) Consequently, all of mankind are now dead in their trespasses and sins, not merely by constraint of their nature, but also by choice. (Genesis 3:7, Eph. 2:1, Rom. 5:14) Mankind\u2019s nature being utterly void of that holiness required by the law of God and positively inclined to evil, is therefore under just condemnation of God. (John 3:18) All people from the time of the fall until the end of the world, are then subjected to eternal and perpetual ruin, without defense or excuse. (Rom. 3:23) Furthermore their natural state is that of being totally depraved, which is to say that every part of man is depraved, not that man is utterly depraved. (Rom. 5:12, 19, Mark 7:21-23, John 8:34)\n\n\nSin is; any action, intention, or thought, that is not done in faith and devoid of the motive of love for God and mankind. (Gal. 5:19-21) Sin is a driving force within mankind established at the fall when Adam and his wife Eve ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. (Gen. 3:7) Those outside of Christ are slaves to sin, but when Jesus rescues a sinner, He releases them from the power of sin and frees them to walk in obedience through Christ\u2019s strength. (Eph 2:1-3, 4) Sin, also understood in the Scriptures as the \u201cflesh\u201d, still abides with the Christian producing a war among the members. (Romans 7:21-25) Upon death or rapture, sin will be eradicated from the life of the believer leaving only the new man that God, through the new birth, created. (1 Cor. 15:26)\n\n\nWe believe that the salvation of sinners is all of grace, through the mediatorial offices of Christ Jesus the Lord. (Eph. 2:8) By the appointment of the Father, Jesus retained complete Deity while freely and fully taking upon himself human nature, yet without sin. (Phil. 2:5-8) He honored the divine law by His personal obedience, and by His death made a full atonement for the sins of those who would believe. (2 Cor. 5:21) Having risen from the dead, He is now enthroned in heaven interceding on behalf of His people having both the tenderest sympathies and divine perfections. (Rom. 8:34) He is in every way qualified to be a suitable, compassionate, and an all-sufficient Saviour to any who will turn in repentance from their sins and trust solely upon His personhood and work for their rescue from God\u2019s just wrath. (Heb. 7:25-27, 2 Cor. 5:21)\n\n\nWe believe that, in order to be saved, sinners must be first be regenerated, or born again. (John 3:3, Titus 3:5) Regeneration consists of God granting new spiritual life to a spiritually dead person. (Romans 7:18, Col. 2:13) God grants instantly a new holy disposition of the mind which is effected in a way far above our comprehension by the power of the Holy Spirit. (2 Cor. 5:17) This regenerate mind and life, in connection with divine truth, secures our voluntary obedience to the gospel. (John 3:16) The evidence of true regeneration and subsequent voluntary obedience to the gospel appears in the fruits of repentance, and faith which are both equally gifts of the Spirit. (Eph. 2:8-9, Rom. 2:4, 2 Tim. 2:25, Acts 11:18) The sinner is then granted from that time on a newness of life. (Rom. 6:4)\n\n\nWe believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ secures for those who repent and believe in Him alone, forensic justification. Forensic justification is a judicial declaration of the sinner to be free from their guilt. (Rom. 4:3-4, Rom. 5:1-5) Justification by no way makes a sinner guiltless, but is rather the accounting of one who is truly guilty to no longer be so. (Rom. 3:21-26) It is bestowed, not in consideration of any works of righteousness which we have done, but solely through faith in the Redeemer\u2019s blood. (Titus 3:5) By virtue of the sovereign gift of faith, Christ\u2019s perfect righteousness is freely imputed to us by the Father. (2 Cor. 5:21) This grace brings us into a state of perfect peace and infinite favor with God. (Rom. 5:1) This judicial declaration is also what secures every other blessing needful for life today and eternity to come. (Eph. 1:3)\n\n\nWe believe that repentance and faith are necessary duties of the sinner in order to be saved. (Mark 1:15) They are also inseparable graces that cannot be experienced or expressed within man\u2019s own ability. (Rom. 9:16) They are brought about in the soul by the regenerating Spirit of God, whereby being supernaturally convinced of our guilt, danger, helplessness, and of the way of salvation through Christ alone, we turn to God with contrition, confession, and fervent pleas for mercy. At the same time the sinner is empowered to ... (truncated)",

        "text":"of Faith\n\nOur Statement of Faith is meant to unify and bring clarity to some of our core beliefs. The statement is not meant to be a comprehensive expression of everything that we believe as a church or as individuals. We require that all elders and pastors of Blue Ridge be in complete agreement with this statement. Church members are not required to agree with all aspects of it but are asked to not create division where their view might differ. The most essential elements of this statement of faith relate to the answer to the question asked by the Philippian jailer in Acts 16:30-31: \u201c\u2018Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\u2019\u201d It is our hope and prayer that everyone would ask that question, hear that answer, and believe in the Lord Jesus, and thus be saved.\n\n\n\nTHE BIBLE:\u00a0We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the verbally inspired Word of God, without error in the original writings, the complete revelation of His will, and the final authority for life and faith for all men. Thus we believe that the Bible is the inerrant, infallible, and inspired Word of God.\n\nGOD:\u00a0We believe in one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is Spirit, eternal, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, immutable, sovereign, holy, just, righteous, faithful, merciful, loving, good, and actively at work in the world and lives of men today.\n\nJESUS CHRIST: We believe that Jesus Christ is God the Son, eternally existing, who lived on earth as a real individual in history. He is true God and true man. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. He was tempted in every way, but yet was without sin. He died on the cross for the sins of all mankind. He rose bodily from the grave on the third day, ascended into heaven, where at the right hand of God the Father, He is now our High Priest, and Advocate. He is the One Mediator between God and man and the head of the church universal and this local body.\n\nTHE HOLY SPIRIT: The Holy Spirit is God, a person of the Trinity fully possessing all the attributes of God. His ministry is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the believing sinner, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living for service. Every believer is baptized with, sealed by, filled with, and given gifts by the Holy Spirit at salvation, although we may quench the Holy Spirit by disobedience subsequent to salvation. The Holy Spirit continues to fill us in relation to our obedience to God, empowers us towards wise living, gives us the ability to understand God\u2019s Word, serves as a constant reminder that we are the children of God, prays for us in our weakness, and gives us guidance to live in holiness. We believe that speaking in tongues is not now nor ever was the common or necessary sign of the baptism or of the filling of the Holy Spirit. No supposed gift of the Holy Spirit enables man to receive revelations which supersede or equal the written Word of God, although we do believe that the Holy Spirit enables believers to discover God\u2019s individual will and direction for each person\u2019s life.\n\nMAN: Man was created in the image of God with the spiritual purpose and ability to glorify God. Man possesses a body, soul, and spirit. Every man will exist eternally, either in everlasting life or in eternal punishment. Believing the entire Bible to be the infallible and inerrant Word of God, we believe the account of the creation and fall of Adam and Eve recorded in Genesis to be literally true. All men were \u201cin Adam\u201d when he sinned. Therefore, sin is imputed to all men and every man is born with a sin nature. Man is totally depraved, that is he is incapable of any work which will release him from the bondage or penalty of sin. Left to himself, man will never seek after God. However, despite his fallen nature, man\u2019s worth is not to be taken lightly for it was for fallen sinful men that Jesus Christ gave His own life. Only through salvation may man participate in the divine nature and escape corruption in the world caused by evil desires.\n\nSIN: Sin, which originated with Satan, entered into the human race through Adam. The penalty of sin is physical and spiritual death. Every man who has ever lived, except Jesus Christ, has personally committed sin. There are several types of sin including: a transgression or violation of God\u2019s law; iniquity, that is an act which is inherently evil; failing to do what is right; missing the mark; acting in accordance with self will rather than the will of God; rebellion against God; unbelief or a denial of the truth of God. The only cure for sin is salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nSALVATION: Salvation from the penalty and power of sin is obtainable exclusively though Jesus Christ. Salvation is bound up in the Gospel (Good News) of Jesus Christ, that is His death, burial, and resurrection, which paid the penalty for our sins. The shed blood of Jesus Christ was necessary for the forgiveness of our sin. Salvation is a free gift of God and can never be earned by any amount of good works. Man is saved by faith in Jesus Christ which includes repentance of his sin and acceptance of the work of Christ on the cross for forgiveness of sin. Saving faith must include an understanding of who Jesus is and what he has done for us, belief of these facts, and trust in the Person and work of Christ. Salvation, once obtained, is eternally secure.\n\nORDINANCES: We believe that the church is to observe two ordinances: believer\u2019s baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper. There is no redemptive power in either of these ordinances but we observe baptism and communion as signs of identification with and obedience to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We believe in baptism by immersion after a person has experienced personal saving faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nSECOND COMING: We believe in the literal return of Jesus Christ to the earth as He promised. We believe that this will occur prior to the millennium. We also believe that the church universal will be raptured, that is to be caught up together and meet the Lord in the air, and that this may happen at any moment. We believe in the bodily resurrection of believers who have died to join with those who are alive to meet Christ. We believe that subsequent to the rapture the earth will be gripped in seven years of intense tribulation after which Christ and his forces will return to earth, take dominion, and rule on earth for a thousand years. The Eternal Kingdom will be established in heaven subsequent to the Great White Throne judgment in which all unbelievers will be judged. Satan and all his forces will be defeated and cast into the Lake of Fire.\n\nFAMILY: Of the three human institutions ordained by God, the church, the family, and human government, the family was God\u2019s first and most fundamental institution. Beginning with the first family, God gives families the ability and responsibility to bear and raise children. God\u2019s pattern for families is for a man and wife to be united in a monogamous marriage for life to raise such children as the Lord gives. Husbands are to love their wives, express gentleness to them and give them honor. Wives are to love their husbands and to be submissive, which we do not understand to mean subservient, to their husbands. Children are to obey and honor their parents. Fathers are not to embitter their children. Parents, particularly fathers, are commanded by Scripture to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.\n\nTHE CHURCH: Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church universal and this local body. The church universal is the body of true believers throughout the earth. No single human organization comprises the church universal. This is a local church and is not subject to any higher human authority, but we remain the willing bondslaves and servants of Jesus Christ. A local church is to be governed by elders and deacons, and both groups are to be directly accountable to the body of believers as they are also accountable to Jesus Christ.\n\nHUMAN GOVERNMENT: Human government is ordained by God. Human government\u2019s purpose is to bear the sword against evil, to punish the doer of evil and to reward the doer of good. We do not believe that it is the purpose of human government to coerce men to express faith in God. We do believe that it is God\u2019s will, however, that human government should operate in accordance with God\u2019s principles and moral absolutes. The church is not to control human government, but to act as an encouragement to human government to establish laws which uphold righteous standards and execute the laws with justice. We believe that one of the highest purposes of human government is the protection of human life from conception until natural death. Human government should punish those who exploit the poor, widows, and orphans. Human government should allow and protect the freedom to worship God and to carry one\u2019s faith into action including the training of one\u2019s children and public expressions of one\u2019s faith. Human government should not attempt to take the place of God by acting as a sovereign or savior. Neither should human government take the place of the church or the family in the roles designated by God. Christians should pray for our rulers, honor them, and obey them except where to do so would cause us to sin against God. Christians have the duty, as the salt of the earth, to oppose moral corruption and to rebuke evil wherever it occurs including within human government.",
