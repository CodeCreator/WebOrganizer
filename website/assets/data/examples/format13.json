        "text":"Government of Canada\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\nMarch 18, 2013 11:00 ET\n\nHarper Government Kick-Starts Entrepreneurial and Innovative Business in Beaconsfield, Quebec\n\nBEACONSFIELD, QUEBEC--(Marketwire - March 18, 2013) - The Honourable Larry Smith, Senator, on behalf of the Honourable Rona Ambrose, Minister of Public Works and Government Services and Minister for Status of Women, is pleased to announce the awarding of two contracts totaling $635,347 to Adventure Lights Inc. for its pre-qualified innovations, the SMART Beacon and the Clustered Beacon System, through the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program (CICP).\n\n\"Our Government's top priority is the economy and we understand that helping Canadian businesses expand and succeed directly benefits Canadian workers and families by creating jobs and prosperity,\" said Minister Ambrose. \"We are proud to encourage Canada's entrepreneurial spirit by supporting Canadian businesses to get their innovative products and services from the lab to the marketplace.\"\n\n\"This announcement brings great news for Beaconsfield, and great news for the Canadian economy,\" said Senator Smith. \"Our Government's top priority is jobs, growth and long-term prosperity, and projects like the SMART Beacon System are key to driving that kind of growth.\"\n\nAdventure Light's pre-qualified innovation, the SMART Beacon, is a mesh networked wearable light beacon system that allows military and civil authorities to instantly identify friendly forces in contact situations. The SMART beacon system also allows for instant visual identification of people, places and objects for military, search and rescue, security and civil applications. A $313,919 contract for this innovation was awarded through the CICP.\n\nThe Clustered Beacon System is the world's smallest, most versatile runway lighting system for expeditionary airfields and first-responder helicopter landing zones. Small enough to be carried by a single person, this portable integrated beacon system allows an unprecedented variety of landing field configurations. This pre-qualified innovation was awarded a $321,428 contract through the CICP.\n\n\"Adventure Lights Inc. is very pleased to receive the support of the Government of Canada through this program. The CICP initiative will give our company further recognition and help support our innovative and unique products that have contributed to Canada's economy,\" said Tim Ford, President of Adventure Lights Inc.\n\nLaunched in 2010, the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program has already shown encouraging results, connecting Canadian companies with federal departments and agencies that have a need for innovative products and services. By selling to the federal government, businesses can demonstrate the value of their products and services, and potentially generate future sales to non-federal customers.\n\nTo build on the early success of this program, Economic Action Plan 2012 allocated an additional $95 million to it over three years, starting in 2013-14, and $40 million per year thereafter to make the Canadian Innovation Commercialization Program permanent. The program will include an added military procurement component.\n\nFor the complete list of the successful innovations, please refer to the CICP website.\n\nCe texte est \u00e9galement disponible en fran\u00e7ais.\n\nPWGSC news releases are also available on our Internet site at\n\nFollow us on Twitter at\n\nContact Information\n\n  \u2022 Amber Irwin\n    Office of the Honourable Rona Ambrose\n\n    Media Relations\n    Public Works and Government Services Canada",

The panel also explored how global standards could be established through public-private cooperation.\n\nAl Jaida said that the principle of Islamic finance embodies the concept of sustainable and inclusive growth. As this becomes a key priority within the economic growth agendas of governments and business entities, Islamic financing will progressively establish itself as the most equitable gateway to financial security.\n\nIslamic finance is a key focus area for both Qatar and QFC. This was reaffirmed in 2018, when Qatar launched the world\u2019s largest single country Islamic exchange traded fund with an initial asset value of US$120 million, and in QFC\u2019s new strategy, which aims to serve the US$2 trillion global Islamic finance market through three core markets \u2013 Turkey, Qatar, and Malaysia.\n\nAs we move towards achieving a sustainable and inclusive economy, QFC will also continue to participate in meaningful dialogues that create opportunities and collaborations in support of this goal.\u2019\n\nQFC is an onshore jurisdiction that allows registered companies to enjoy competitive benefits, such as working within a legal environment based on English common law, the right to trade in any currency, up to 100% foreign ownership, 100% repatriation of profits, 10% corporate tax on locally-sourced profits, and an extensive double taxation avoidance agreement network with over 70 countries.\n\nFor updates and more information about QFC, visit their website at",

Send in Your SNAP Letter to the Editor TODAY (April Action)\n\nAs Congress heads back to DC this week to finalize the 2016 budget, send them a strong message that any budget that puts SNAP cuts on the \u201cfast track\u201d is unacceptable. RESULTS volunteers have been doing an excellent job at using the media to push members of Congress to protect SNAP. In the last week, you\u2019ve had 14 media pieces about SNAP published! That kind of coverage makes a difference. Keep it up and do all you can to protect hungry families!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Take two minutes to send a letter to the editor telling your members of Congress by name to protect SNAP in the 2016 budget. Use our SNAP LTE alert to send your letter today. If you want to write your own letter, and use the April Action for talking points and background information. If you are looking to make a bigger impact, use our SNAP media brief to urge your local paper to write an editorial about protecting SNAP. Find media outlets to send your letter using our Media Guide. If you have questions or need help with letters, op-eds, or editorials, please contact Jos Linn ([email\u00a0protected]) for assistance.\n\nWe also encourage you to listen to the recording and review the slides from last Saturday\u2019s April U.S. Poverty National Meeting; guest speaker Rebecca Lenn provided some invaluable insights on how to respond to myths about SNAP in the media.\n\nGot Ten Minutes? Invite Young People to Apply for REAL Change\n\nWhile the immediate focus at RESULTS is on protecting nutrition programs and expanding economic mobility in America, we are also looking ahead at engaging the next generation of RESULTS activists. We have a fantastic network of volunteers, some of whom have been with RESULTS for decades. But we know that in order to survive and thrive, RESULTS always needs to be looking for new people, especially young people. Young people bring their unique strength, passion, and intelligence to any endeavor. Imagine what world we could create if the next generation of leaders started out as RESULTS advocates. We have a tool to make that happen.\n\nThe RESULTS REAL Change Fellowship is a year-long volunteer program working to train the next generation of anti-poverty advocates. It is a way for 18-28 year olds to get unique experience in lobbying, media advocacy, and organizing. It starts with a trip to the RESULTS International Conference and continues throughout the year, where Fellows put their ongoing training into practice in their community. It can be a wonderful experience for those who participate, just like PaHoua Vang from Minnesota. PaHoua recently wrote on the RESULTS Blog about how RESULTS and the REAL Change Fellowship has taught her the courage to advocate for the things she cares about. We want more people like PaHoua, and Sarah Miller, and Reba Carethers, and David Costello, and other Fellows who have completed the program. We are now accepting applications for the 2015-26 class and we need your help. If you know someone 18-28 years old who would make a great advocate, urge them to apply today. The deadline to apply is April 25.\n\nTAKE ACTION: Think you might know someone who wants to be a part of our REAL Change Fellowship? Take ten minutes and tell them to apply fast! We have already accepted over 50 REAL changers and applications are pouring in. REAL Changers work with RESULTS an average of six hours per week and attend webinar trainings every two weeks. They spend the year learning how to lobby, organize and work with local media. The application deadline is April 25, so please share with your local group and local contacts now. To learn more check out www.results.org\/realchange.\n\nGot Twenty Minutes?

If that weren\u2019t enough, you also get some of the best policy briefings and advocacy training around and then get to make your voice heard by taking your message of \u201cend poverty now\u201d straight up Capitol Hill to your members of Congress. Who would want to miss that?\n\nBut perhaps you\u2019re not sure about whether to come OR you\u2019re new to RESULTS and want to know more OR you are coming and just want to learn what\u2019s in store.

Rebecca Lenn, Director of Outreach for Media Matters, did a fabulous presentation on how to combat myths about SNAP in the media. For example, she taught us to \u201cminimize the myth, familiarize the fact.\u201d Too often, when we hear something negative about SNAP, our response is to repeat it and then try to negate it (\u201cSNAP does not have a high fraud rate!\u201d). While admirable, Rebecca explained that this simply reinforces the myth in the mind of the reader or listener. Instead, you want to retell it. Here\u2019s an alternative frame Rebecca provided:\n\nMyth: SNAP has a high rate of fraud and abuse.\n\nRetold Fact: SNAP is doing exactly what it is supposed do and what a democracy would ask of it. It is helping people who need help in hard times. Pundits and politicians who make this claim are turning a blind eye to not just the numbers that show that fraud and abuse are rare, but the seniors, children, and working families for whom SNAP is helping.\n\nAdvice like this is invaluable and only helps us to better educate lawmakers and the public about the truth. This is only one of the many tips Rebecca provided us during the meeting. The call also included shares from volunteers in Iowa, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Washington State about media successes and face-to-face meetings this month. If you were not on the call or want to review it again, please listen to the recording of the call and download the slides and summary of the call from our National Conference Calls page.\n\nRESULTS greatly appreciates Rebecca and Media Matters for appearing on our call. We look forward to working with them again in the future.\n\nQuick News: Invite Staffers to Witnesses Event; Learn Where Your Taxes Go\n\nInvite Congressional Staffers to Witnesses to Hunger Event.
