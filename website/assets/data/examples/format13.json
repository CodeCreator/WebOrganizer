But the sad fact is that while men are aware of their mental struggles, societal taboos and stigma lead to many suffering in silence.\n\nBy simply talking with one another, men can improve their mental health.\n\nThe LightOn mental health campaign\n\nThis week has been Men\u2019s Health Week, so we invited Andrew Coleman, one of the founders of the LightOn mental health campaign, to join us to explore how we can support ourselves, friends, family members and colleagues.\n\nLightOn is a mental wellbeing campaign by the people of Dorset, for Dorset. It gives men permission and an opportunity to talk about mental health.\n\nIn his open and honest presentation, Andrew talked about his own experiences with his mental health. He explained that one of the hardest steps we can take is to open up. But when you show vulnerability, it gives others permission to open up.\n\nHuman beings are instinctively community-based, and LightOn gives men that community \u2013 space \u2018beyond the banter\u2019 to share stories, experiences, information and support.\n\nYou can connect with the LightOn campaign through their website, on Twitter, Instagram (especially during their \u2018Talk More Tuesdays\u201d Insta-chats at 7pm on Tuesdays), LinkedIn and Facebook.\n\nYou can watch the recording of Andrew\u2019s presentation here:\n\nWhere to find help\n\nThis Here For Each Other staff wellbeing website has lots of resources you can use to manage feelings of anxiety and stress, or around things such as sleep problems and bereavement.\n\nBut you may feel that you would really benefit from some 1:1 support. Why not refer yourself into our staff wellbeing service? Referrals are straightforward \u2013 take a look at the referrals page for more information. Read more about our team and how the service works.\n\nMental health services\n\nUsing the Five Ways to Wellbeing\n\nThe Men\u2019s Health Forum (MHF) says that:\n\n\u201cEven before the pandemic, men\u2019s mental health was a cause for concern. There is a grave disparity in the high number of men who die from suicide and the low number of men who seek treatment for depression, anxiety and other mental health challenges.\u201d\n\nThe MHF has been promoting the Five Ways to Wellbeing \u2013 five things we can all do that are scientifically-proven to help us feel better \u2013 through its CAN DO Challenge:\n\n  \u2022 Connect \u2013 connect with other people (eg. call an old friend you haven\u2019t since before lockdown) #connectmonday\n  \u2022 (Be)\u00a0Active \u2013 move your body (eg. go for a run\/walk\/swim\/dance\/etc) #activetuesday\n  \u2022 Notice \u2013 take notice of the environment around you (eg. turn off your phone for an hour) #noticewednesday\n  \u2022 Discover \u2013 learn something new (eg. read a book you haven\u2019t read before) #discoverthursday\n  \u2022 Offer (or give) \u2013 do something for someone else (eg. volunteer for a local community group) #offerfriday\n\nFind out more about the Five Ways to Wellbeing\n\nAs well as our content about the Five Ways \u2013 Be active, Connect, Give back, Keep learning, Take notice (mindfulness) \u2013 colleagues from Live Well Dorset will be joining us in the next few weeks for two specific sessions on the Five Ways to Wellbeing:",

        "text":"Marketing Students Get a High-Level View on NYC Trip\n\nLeBow students Taylor Menser and Chandni Shah at SAP's New York City offices\n\nThe participants in the August trip to New York City, organized by LeBow\u2019s Undergraduate Career Services, came away with new perspectives. The students, nearly all marketing majors, gained insights on potential career paths and entering the workforce, courtesy of several Drexel alumni, and they, along with the faculty and staff members who came along, saw New York City in a new way: from more than 50 stories up.\n\nThat high-level view came from a site visit to SAP, the second stop on a day that started with a jaunt through the teeming, modern workspaces at Google. Jamie Blomquist, a Class of 2009 graduate and a 2010 MBA graduate, led the students\u2019 tour through Google\u2019s largest office in New York City; the company also has offices in the Chelsea Market building, which it owns. Blomquist detailed her path to Google \u2013 completing an MBA to wait out the worst of the global recession, starting out in real estate, then working at an advertising agency \u2013 and explained her day-to-day work in Google\u2019s Sales and Consulting division.\n\nAlong the insights from Blomquist and several other current Google employees, the big draw for students was the bells and whistles of the offices. Some employees use scooters to get around the building, a former New York Port Authority building near the High Line, which encompasses a full city block. The offices are filled with kitchens, breakrooms, exercise facilities and other perks that have made Google one of the most desirable places to work for young college graduates of all backgrounds and majors.\n\nAfter departing Google, it was a short bus ride north to the Hudson Yards complex on Manhattan\u2019s West Side for a tour of SAP\u2019s Leonardo Center, including the Next-Gen Lab, an incubator space for collaborators and community partners with the company\u2019s advanced technology offerings front and center.\n\nSAP was already familiar to a number of students on the trip who had previously worked on co-op at SAP\u2019s offices in Newtown Square, and the site visit also served as a preview of another Next-Gen Lab that will open this fall as part of LeBow\u2019s Center for Business Analytics.\n\nMark Santerian, a class of 2015 graduate and a senior account manager at SAP, detailed not only his path to his current job but also the importance of building connections through networking and co-op employment. Based in Philadelphia but with clients based all over the Northeast, Santerian hopes to build even stronger ties between his company and LeBow and among Drexel alumni working there.\n\nFor Stephanie Arredondo, a junior marketing and business analytics major, the highlight of the trip was the technology on display at SAP and learning about the ways it\u2019s being used to improve customer experience. \u201cIt was great to learn firsthand the innovative technologies SAP has developed utilizing machine learning, advanced analytics, VR and more,\u201d she says.\n\nThe tour of SAP transitioned into a networking event with Drexel alumni, with the outdoor terrace on the 52nd floor becoming a popular spot for photos. Some of those shots will soon grace students\u2019 LinkedIn profiles \u2013 another step in the networking and job-search process.\n\nIn This Story\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPutting Unique Talents to Work\n\nLeBow students were tasked with aiding SAP\u2019s implementation of Autism at Work \u2014 an initiative that aims to hire more than 600 people with autism spectrum disorder by 2020.\n\nMS Econ's Alexander Smith to Intern With NYC Office of Management and Budget\n\nAlexander Smith, a student in LeBow\u2019s School of Economics MS in Econ program, has landed a policy analyst internship with the City of New York.",

Canadians Take Responsibility When It Comes to Retirement Planning: RBC\n\nWho's Contributing to Your Nest Egg? Canadians Take Responsibility When It Comes to Retirement Planning: RBC\n\nFewer than one-third of North Americans confident they will have enough money for a secure retirement\n\nTORONTO, May 9, 2012 - When it comes to ensuring their financial security in retirement, Canadians overall believe that they are primarily responsible (59 per cent), with the rest of this duty falling to the government (19 per cent), their employer (10 per cent), another family member (eight per cent) and their financial advisor (five per cent), according to the latest RBC Canadian Consumer Outlook (RBC CCO).\n\n\"It's encouraging to see Canadians playing their part in planning for their retirement,\" said Amalia Costa, head, Retirement Strategies, RBC. \"This is a financial responsibility that you don't have to undertake alone. A financial advisor can assist you in getting started, understanding your options, incomes sources and determining what the best approach is for you.\"\n\nWhen it comes to looking at their prospects for retirement, consumers on both sides of the border share similar beliefs. Canadians (61 per cent) are more confident of their understanding of the retirement savings options available to them with almost half (45 per cent) of Americans saying the same. However, only 29 per cent of Americans and 36 per cent of Canadians are confident that they will have enough money to have a secure retirement.\n\nWhat is troubling, particularly given the aging populations, is that four-in-10 (42 per cent) of Americans and 37 per cent of Canadians are worried they won't have enough money saved to be financially secure. Consequently, more than one-in-four North Americans believe they will have to work past retirement age to make enough money to live, with slightly more Americans (29 per cent) than Canadians (26 per cent) believing this to be true. To address their concern about financial security in retirement, 34 per cent of Canadians and 36 per cent of Americans say they save a regular amount of money from each paycheque.\n\nIn Canada, more than half (54 per cent) said they didn't have enough money to take advantage of all the savings options available to them, and 15 per cent claim there are too many options available to make clear decisions on how to properly invest their money.\n\n\"With the volumes of financial and investment information available, awareness of the need to save is greater than ever before, and even for those who have retirement savings plans, meeting retirement goals can become a challenge,\" added Costa. \"If you are able to, there are catch-up strategies you could use to reach your retirement goals.\"\n\nTo catch up on retirement savings, Costa advises doing the following:\n\n  \u2022 Make regular contributions to your RRSP: Sometimes, people who are behind in their saving are reluctant to even explore strategies that could help them get back on track. Why? Because they think they can't afford it. One approach is to start slowly, setting aside small amounts. Consider an automatic RRSP contribution program to make these small steps a priority in your financial life.\n  \u2022 Invest your tax refund: If you receive a tax refund, take advantage of this new found money by investing it in your TFSA or RRSP. You will not only be growing your investment savings, you'll also be ahead in your contributions for that current tax year.\n  \u2022 Take out an RRSP loan: In certain situations, it makes sense to take out a loan to top up your RRSP. For example, if you have unused RRSP contribution room, you can borrow money to catch-up, and then use the tax savings to help repay the loan.\n  \u2022 Consider adjusting your current lifestyle: Making some lifestyle sacrifices now can help you retire with a higher standard of living.\n\nAbout RBC's savings and other financial advice and interactive tools\nCanadians can freely access savings advice and resources at In addition, all personal RBC online banking clients can use myFinanceTracker, a no-cost interactive financial management tool, to create a budget and track their spending habits. Whether Canadians want to get more from their day to day banking, protect what's important, save and invest, borrow with confidence or take care of their businesses, the RBC Advice Centre can help answer their questions. Interactive tools and calculators provide customized information covering many facets of personal finance. In addition, online advice videos are updated regularly to reflect current trends and to answer the questions that are top of mind with Canadians. With the guidance of RBC advisors who are available to chat live, Canadians have access to free, no-obligation professional advice about RBC products and services and personalized one-on-one service at\n\nAbout the RBC Canadian Consumer Outlook Index\nThe survey is conducted online via Ipsos Reid's national I-Say Consumer Panel to 3,398 Canadians (489 British Columbia, 481 Alberta, 539 Saskatchewan\/Manitoba, 778 Ontario, 525 Quebec, 586 Atlantic Canada). Weighting was then employed to balance demographics and ensure that the sample's composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. Data collection was April 2 to 9, 2012. A survey with an unweighted probability sample of this size and a 100 per cent response rate would have an estimated margin of error of \u00b11.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, of what the results would have been had the entire population of adults in Canada been polled.\n\nAbout the RBC U.S. Consumer Outlook Index\nThe RBC U.S. Consumer Outlook Index provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive outlook of U.S. consumers based on data collected from interviews with a nationally representative sample of more than 1,000 U.S. adults conducted over a multi-day polling period each month by Ipsos, the world's second-largest market and opinion research firm. The results in this news release reflect some of the findings of the Ipsos poll of 1,005 U.S. adults conducted on March 29- April 1, 2012. The RBC Consumer Outlook Index is released within 36 hours after the U.S. online panel members are interviewed. Weighting is employed to balance demographics and ensure that the survey sample's composition reflects that of the U.S. adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. Statistical margins of error are not applicable to online polls because they are based on samples drawn from opt-in online panels, not on random samples that mirror the population within a statistical probability ratio. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error.\n\n- 30 -\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nSuzanne Willers, RBC Corporate Communications,\n416 974-2727,\n\nCraig Christie, RBC Corporate Communications,\n416 974-8820,\n\n\nRelated Media\n\nProvincial Releases",

        "text":"Nachrichten zu den Komponisten bei Boosey & Hawkes\n\nSuche Katalog\n\n\nEnrico Chapela: electric cello concerto in Birmingham\n\n(March 2013)\n\nThe City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra plays host to the European premiere of Enrico Chapela's MAGNETAR, featuring Johannes Moser on electric cello.\n\nJohannes Moser is soloist in the European premiere of Mexican composer Enrico Chapela's electric cello concerto MAGNETAR at Symphony Hall in Birmingham on 28 March. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra is conducted by Diego Matheuz, one of the most exciting young conductors to emerge from the 'El Sistema' classical music training scheme in Venezuela. Enrico Chapela will be attending the performance and participating in a pre-concert talk at 6.15 pm in conversation with Simon Webb.\n\nMAGNETAR was written for the virtuosic skills of Johannes Moser and premiered by him in Los Angeles in 2011 with the LA Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel. The 25-minute concerto has since been performed by Moser in Brazil with the S\u00e3o Paulo Symphony Orchestra and Marin Alsop. Plans are underway for further performances at festivals this summer and on an Iberian tour with the Orquestra Sinf\u00f3nica do Porto Casa da M\u00fasica this autumn. The concerto was jointly commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Orquestra Sinf\u00f3nica do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n> Watch a video introduction to MAGNETAR\n\nThe title MAGNETAR relates to neutron stars which are the universe's most powerful magnets. This focus falls in line with other recent science-related compositions by Chapela, including Nanobots (2010) based on microscopic machines, and Private Alleles (2010) which takes inspiration from the Mexican Genome Diversity Project. As the electric cello produces sound via electromagnetism, Chapela decided to base his concerto on data from magnetars, translated into pitch sets. The electric cello part combines sounds from an effects patcher, including delay, granulation, and spectral freeze, to create its otherworldly soundscape.\n\nWhile the opening movement features a cadenza that represents for the composer a magnetar's \"quiet and peaceful times\" and the second movement \"falls into a cool jam\", the third movement, entitled Brutal \"bursts from nowhere into a fully distorted e-cello that leads into a violent riff, that gradually builds up to the giant final flare\".\n\nEnrico Chapela, born in Mexico City in 1974, studied guitar performance and composition at the CIEM academy in Mexico City, and electro-acoustic music and musicology at the University of Paris Saint-Denis. He has been commissioned to compose music for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Dresdner Sinfoniker, Carnegie Hall, Seattle Symphony, Britten Sinfonia, Wigmore Hall, and the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing. His musical style seeks to fuse different geographic traditions and musical soundworlds, so that contemporary techniques can happily coexist with minimalist, jazz or rock idioms. Orchestal works include \u00ednguesu, a musical recreation of a historic football match betweeen Mexico and Brazil, which has\u00a0been performed\u00a0widely including in Mexico, USA, Brazil, Germany, Poland and South Korea.\n\n> CBSO website\n> View MAGNETAR on our Online Scores website\n> Visit Chapela's website\n\n>\u00a0Weitere Informationen zum Werk: MAGNETAR\n\nPhoto: Johannes Moser, soloist in Chapela's MAGNETAR (Uwe Arens)\n\n>\u00a0Nachrichtensuche\n\n\nMelden Sie sich an\u00a0f\u00fcr Updates & Angebote per Mail\n\n\nOrchester- und B\u00fchnenwerke\n\nOnline Ansicht\n\nBl\u00e4ttern Sie online in \u00fcber 1000 Partituren!\n\nFAQ | Kontakt\/Impressum | Links | \u00dcber Uns | Shopverzeichnis | Stellen | AGB | RSS Index",

To RSVP, call 212.998.8693 or e-mail Subway Lines: A, B, C, D, E, F, M (West 4th Street); 1 (Christopher Street). Reporters interested in attending must RSVP to James Devitt, NYU\u2019s deputy director for media relations, at 212.998.6808 or\n\nMore than a year after the revolution that inspired an entire region to action, the Tunisian population now confronts intimidation and violence against their artists, cultural entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and higher education communities. The past few months have produced the harassment of eminent Tunisian intellectuals and the denunciation of various TV stations and media officials connected with the release of two movies said to degrade the sacred values of Islam. At the forefront of the political and social transformations underway throughout the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, analysts say Tunisia offers an important test case for interventions to strengthen local advocates of intellectual freedom and freedom of expression at this sensitive time.\n\nThe panel discussion will address the threat that censorship poses to Tunisian communities, specifically analyzing the nature and origin of the spreading violence that has been increasing over the past year. The discussion will be geared toward developing solutions to the current constitutional reform process in Tunisia, scheduled to conclude this fall.\n\nParticipants at the panel discussion will include: Fawzia Charfi, professor of physics, University of Tunis; Ikbal Gharbi, associate professor of anthropology, Higher Institute of Theology, Zaytuna University; Habib Kazdaghli, University Professor of Contemporary History and dean of the School of Letters, Arts, and Humanities, University of Tunis-Manouba; and Hamadi Redissi, University Professor of Political Science, School of Law and Political Sciences of Tunis, Al-Manar University. Mustapha Tlili, founder and director of the NYU Center for Dialogues: Islamic World-U.S.-The West, will moderate the discussion.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note:\nNew York University\u2019s Center for Dialogues: Islamic World-U.S.-The West emerged from the tragedy of September 11th, which highlighted the need for greater communication among and about the United States, Europe, and the Muslim world. The Center was founded as a forum for constructive debate among the various religious, intellectual, economic, and political sectors of American, European, and Islamic societies. It brings contentious issues between the Islamic world and the West into a more rational plane and promotes this approach to a wide audience, including important constituencies of policy and decision-makers, policy analysts, the media, and educational institutions.

Scholars at Risk members save lives by providing sanctuary to professors, lecturers, researchers and other intellectuals who suffer threats in their home country. Through temporary academic positions, SAR members help scholars to escape dangerous conditions and to continue their important work. In return, scholars contribute to their host campuses through teaching, research, lectures and other activities. Many scholars return to their home countries after their visit. When safe return is not possible, SAR works with scholars to identify opportunities to continue their work abroad. The benefits are clear: scholars are free to live and work without fear. SAR members gain talented academics and inspiring, courageous educators. The world benefits from solidarity among higher education institutions, greater awareness of current threats to academic freedom, and deeper appreciation of the vital role of higher education and scholarship in free societies. Scholars at Risk also educates the public about attacks on scholars and higher education communities through the SAR website, email bulletins, publications and events. The SAR Speaker Series brings threatened scholars to member campuses to engage directly with students, faculty, alumni and the community. SAR also advocates on behalf of imprisoned scholars and undertakes research aimed at promoting understanding and respect for academic freedom and related values.\n\nThis Press Release is in the following Topics:\nArts and Science, Around the Square, Events and Traditions\n\nType: Press Release\n\nNYU to Host \u201cCourage to Think: Intellectual Freedom in Tunisia and the Arab Spring\u201d\u2014April 9\n\nSearch News\n\nNYU In the News\n\nNYU Received a Record Number of Applications\n\nCapital New York reported NYU received a record 60,322 applications for the class of 2019, an increase of about 15 percent since last year.\n\nNYU Students Help City Crack Down on Hookah Bars\n\nCapital New York reported that NYU students helped New York City crack down on hookah bars that illegally include tobacco in their hookahs:\n\nRudin Center Study Says Mass Transit Helps Economic Mobility\n\nThe Wall Street Journal wrote about a report by Wagner\u2019s Rudin Center that showed that mass transit could be more important than education in determining economic mobility.\n\nBrennan Center Report Says Campaign Spending Has Jumped\n\nFrontline did a piece about a report by the Brennan Center for Justice that said that campaign spending by outside groups has more than doubled in the last five years.\n\nNYU\u2019s Dorms Ranked Among the Best in the Nation ranked NYU\u2019s student residences third in the country in its list of best college dorms.\n\n\nNYU Footer",
