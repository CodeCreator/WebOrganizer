Journal on Chain and Network Science, 12, 181-198. DOI: 10.3920\/jncs2012.x012\n\nIn this paper socio-demographic characteristics of sustainable food consumers are studied by using actual purchasing data of 4,412 households in a wide range of food products over a twenty week period in the months November 2008 till March 2009. Our results indicate that purchasing sustainable food products is still the exception rather than the rule. Socio-demographic characteristics are (weakly) related to the purchasing sustainable food items. Specifically, people with a higher education and those living in a more urban area are more likely to purchase sustainable products. Psychographic data on a subsample (n=1,112) show a weak relation between sustainability concerns and sustainable behaviour. Scales measuring people\u2019s sustainability concerns specific to purchasing products (e.g. Ethical orientation scale) are better predictors of people\u2019s sustainable consumption than scales measuring people\u2019s general sustainability concerns (e.g. Connectedness to Nature scale). Since consumer characteristics seem to be of little predictive value of sustainable consumption it may be wise to shift the focus from investigating who the sustainable consumer is to how to make sustainable products successful. In the discussion we offer some initial guiding principles.\nKeywords: sustainability, socio-demographic characteristics, consumption, fair trade, pro-environmental",

        "text":"Beer is a very popular alcoholic beverage, selling more than 133 billion liters per year. It is produced through the fermentation of starch-based material, commonly barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The beer brewing process comprises several steps. Malting is a process applied to cereal grains, in which the grains are made to germinate and then are quickly dried before the plant develops. Malting grains develops enzymes that are required to modify the grains starches into sugars. Barley is the most common malt because of its high amylase content. Mashing is the first phase of brewing, in which the malted grains are crushed and soaked in warm water in order to create a malt extract. During sparging, water is filtered through the mash to dissolve the sugars. The darker, sugar-heavy liquid is called the wort. The wort is boiled along with any remaining ingredients (excluding yeast), to remove excess water and kill microorganisms. The hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are added during boiling. The yeast is added and the beer is left for fermentation. Then, the beer is bottled and left for CO2 levels to increase. Because the ingredients and procedures used to make beer can differ, characteristics such as taste and colour may vary between different beers.\n\n\u00a0A common method of categorizing beer is by the type of yeast used in the fermentation process. In this method of categorizing, those beers with fast acting (top-fermenting) yeast, which leaves behind residual sugars, are termed \u2018ales\u2019. Beers with a slower and longer acting (bottom-fermenting) yeast, which removes most of the sugars leaving a clean and dry beer, are termed \u2018lagers\u2019. For Lambic beers wild yeasts are used, rather than cultivated ones. In terms of volume, most of today's beer is based on the pale-coloured lager first brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen (lager pilsner beer). Furthermore, dark beers, also called \u2018stout\u2019, exist in a sweet and in a bitter variant. Another more recent type of beer is alcohol-free beer. Alcohol is removed by (vacuum) distillation, vacuum evaporation, dialysis and reverse osmosis (37). In the food composition table, the beer types distinguished are regular beer (various lager and lager pilsner types of beer), dark beer, ale beer and alcohol free beer. Beer contains a wide variety of polyphenols and classes. However, content values for each of the single polyphenols are rather low. Nevertheless polyphenols play an important role in beer flavour (bitterness, astringency, harshness), colour and beer stability.\u00a0\n\nTotal polyphenol content in beer, as measured by the Folin-method, varies between 12 and 52 mg\/100 ml, depending on the beer type. Ale beer and dark beer are richer in polyphenols (52 and 42 mg\/100 ml respectively). Regular beer contains about 28 mg\/100 ml total polyphenols. Alcohol free beer contains about 12 mg\/100 ml polyphenols.\n\n\u00a0However, when comparing the total polyphenol value measured by Folin (28 mg\/100 ml for regular beer) with the total polyphenol value calculated from the sum of the individual polyphenols measured by chromatographic methods (4.04 mg\/100 ml for regular beer), the latter appears to be inferior. This could be explained in one part by the lack of data on beer polyphenols in the literature, and thus in the food composition table. It is difficult to measure proanthocyanidins by chromatographic methods, since higher oligomers (>trimer) tend to coelute as large unresolved peaks. Therefore proanthocyanidin contents measured by chromatography can be underestimated. Another explanation is the reactivity of the Folin assay with non-polyphenol reducing compounds, like Maillard products. The interference of Maillard reaction products present in beer can lead to an overestimation of total polyphenol values measured by Folin. Beer contains a variety of polyphenols belonging to the following classes: prenylated flavonoids, phenolic acids, simple phenols, flavanols, hydroxycoumarins, flavonols and flavones. Brewing materials such as barley and hop deliver polyphenols to the beer in the brewing process. Furthermore, polymerization and formation of polyphenols can occur during further processing and storage of beer.\n\nPrenylflavonoids (alkylchalcones, alkylflavanones and alkylmethoxyflavanones) in beer are derived from hops. Prenylflavonoids are phytoestrogens, and contribute to the estrogenicity of beer. Content values of prenylflavonoids in 13 different beer types have been found to range from 0 to 0.4 mg\/100 ml, depending on beer type and brewing processes (38). The prenylflavonoid patterns are similar in most beers, with isoxanthohumol, xanthohumol and 6-prenylnaringenin being most abundant (>95% of total prenylflavonoids). Minor amounts of 8-prenylnaringenin and 6-geranylnaringenin were also detected. Regular type beers have much lower contents of prenylflavonoids (0.05 mg\/100 ml) than the more bitter tasting ale and dark beers (0.26 and 0.20 mg\/100 ml respectively). Alcohol free beer contains only minor amounts of prenylflavonoids (0.01 mg\/100 ml). Beer is one of the most important dietary sources of prenylflavonoids, since these are rare in other plant foods often consumed. Phenolic acids are present in beer. Ferulic acid (0.84 mg\/ 100 ml), gallic acid (0.57 mg\/100 ml), vanillic acid (0.15 mg\/ 100 ml), p-coumaric acid (0.14 mg\/ 100 ml) and sinapic acid (0.03 mg\/ 100 ml) are most abundant, as measured after hydrolysis in regular beer. Ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapic acid are present in beer mainly as bound forms. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid are present mainly as free forms. Vanillic acid and syringic acid are present almost equally in the free and bound form (39, 40). During brewing, the cinnamic acids, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, are transformed into the flavour active volatile phenols 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol, either by thermal fragmentation or enzymatic activity of the yeast strains. Their ethyl-derivatives 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol can also be formed after refermentation (41). Contents of both 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol in dark beer are both 0.03 mg\/100 ml. Tyrosol is present in beer (0.32 mg\/100 ml in regular beer). Flavanol monomers and oligo- and polymers (proanthocyanidins) are of interest to brewers as they play a role in non-biological haze formation. Beer haze may be defined as an insoluble or semi soluble particulate matter formed by complexation of polyphenols and proteins, which gives a colloidal suspension in beer reducing the transparency of the beer (42, 43). Stabilization of beer to protect against haze formation can be achieved by decreasing the flavanol content and thereby limiting flavanol complexation with proteins. Often, this stabilization is achieved by treatment with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) which forms insoluble complexes with polyphenols and more particularly proanthocyanidins. Comparison of beers with and without PVPP treatment showed indeed much lower flavanol monomer and dimer concentrations in stabilized beer, and a delay of haze formation during storage (44, 45). Contents of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin in regular beer are 0.11 and 0.06 mg\/100 ml. Ale beer contains 0.33 mg\/100 ml (+)-catechin and 0.05 (-)-epicatechin. Proanthocyanidins are more abundant than catechins. Procyanidin dimer B3 and prodelphinidin dimer B3 contents are 0.15 and 0.18 mg\/100 ml in regular beer. Low contents of hydroxycoumarins have been described in beer. 4-Hydroxycoumarin and esculin are present in regular beer with respectively 0.11 mg\/100 ml and 0.02 mg\/100 ml. Umbelliferone is only found in traces. Some flavonols are also present in beer. Quercetin 3-O-rutinoside content is 0.09 mg\/100 ml in regular beer. After hydrolysis, however, no quercetin has been detected.\u00a0\n\nNext to the type of beer, and the treatment with PVPP, other factors responsible for the variability of polyphenol contents in beer are the ingredients and the processing, as well as aging or storage. Polyphenol contents in barley vary with variety and environmental conditions, and thus influence polyphenol contents in corresponding malts. Polyphenol contents in barleys are higher than in their corresponding malts (46). Flavanols are largely degraded during malting. The content of polyphenols in beer also depends on the extent of their extraction during mashing. Mashing of malt releases bound cinnamic acids. Furthermore, the extraction of polyphenols from malt into the wort depends on the malt-to-water ratios, where low ratios yield higher levels of polyphenols (7).\u00a0\n\nDuring the boiling step of beer brewing, hop is added to the wort. The contribution of hop polyphenols to boiled wort depends on the time of addition. Late addition allows the extraction, but limits their subsequent degradation upon oxidation (47). Ale beers are more hopped than lagers. A large proportion of flavonols is extracted from hop: 88% of the quercetin glycosides and 91% of the kaempferol glycosides present in the hop are extracted in the wort during the boiling process (48). During the fermentation step the content of flavonol glycosides is decreased, but storage of beer for up to two months produces no further losses in flavonols. This could mean that the content of flavonols in beer largely depends on the rates of hop addition to worts during the beer brewing process.\u00a0\n\nThe prenylated flavonoids in hops are predominantly of the chalcone type. Hops only contain minor quantities of prenylated flavanones. In contrast, beers contain much higher levels of prenylflavanones than prenylchalcones. During the boiling of hops with wort, prenylated chalcones undergo cyclization into their isomeric flavanones. Losses of prenylflavonoids during wort boiling occur due to incomplete extraction from the hop into the wort, adsorption to insoluble malt proteins, and adsorption to yeast cells during fermentation (49).\u00a0\n\nConcentrations of esterified ferulic acids were reported to be about 2 to 3-fold higher than the corre...

This film was an eye opener for most people but being that I am a sixth generation farmer I understand how the seed, meat, and poultry corporations work. This film discussed the problems with the food industry today, and what we need to do to change the future of how our food is made and processed. In the first section of this documentary they talked about the food industry as a whole and how most of the food industry is ran by four or five big industries.\n\nThis should not be how it is ran as off right now and today these companies are monopolies and run unsafe facilities not for just the people that work there but how the production process is ran. This documentary also covered the meat is being produced in unsafe and unnatural way. While feeding cattle corn is a great way to make them larger quicker, it still is not the right way to feed cattle because feeding them too much corn can cause them to die because of a disease called e-coli.\n\nWhen cattle get this disease it sometimes is not caught and the cow gets slaughtered and ends up on our dinner plate and then we receive the disease by eating the meat. This needs to change cows need to be fed grass and hay, and should not be on a corn only diet. This film also covered the poultry industry and how poultry is being grown at a very fast rate and how the chicken houses are not safe or very sanitary. The poultry houses are sealed with no sunlight. Chickens in these houses are bigger and grown at a faster rate which often leads to death and disease.\n\nDon't use plagiarized sources.

During this section they discussed how farmers were getting the short end of the stick with trying to battle with Monsanto, which is the largest seed producing company in America. It is bad that farmers only have one place to go for seed for crops and after Monsanto buys all the other seed companies in America where do farmers turn when they don\u2019t have the funds to keep running. Those farmers turn to banks for loans to buy the seed from this company and hopes that it will produce. If that seed doesn\u2019t produce a good crop farmers go bankrupt.\n\nThis documentary doesn\u2019t state but shows what America\u2019s food industry is turning into and is heading to a monopoly industry. The food industry is failing as a whole and America should take it back by growing and raising our own food. We should rely less on foods that are highly processed, and put more back to farmers to make a new food industry. Without farmers America would fail. It\u2019s like my Father always says \u201cfarmers built this country, and only a farmer can rebuild it\u201d.

        "text":"Prof. Michael Fuller,, St. Louis Community College\nSCA, Lord Michael of Safita\nBarony of Three Rivers within the Kingdom of Calontir\nExperimental Archaeology at Pennsic, Summer 2007.\n\nI conducted two open fire cooking experiments at Pennsic. The first experiment was cooking Tavche Gravche (Macedonian, beans in a pot) while the second experiment was to cook Mjaddarah (Arabic, traditional lentil dish) over an open fire.\n\nTavche Gravche is a dish that I prepared at Pennsic during 2006; I modified the experiment during 2007 by preparing the dish in a glazed, straight-wall casserole dish that I had purchased in the Khan El Khalili (Cairo's old market) during March 2007. I also modified the experiment by using dry herbs instead of fresh herbs.\n\nThe recipe and directions for Tavche Gravche were provided by Christopher Sulincevski (a native Skopje and international project supervisor for St. Louis Community College).\n\nRaw Ingredients: 6 heaping handfuls of white beans (soaked overnight), 4 minced cloves of garlic, olive oil, sweet paprika, and water. I used a heaping handful onions that had been commercially fried and dried.\n\nDried thyme and dried rosemary were used to season the stew. The red spice is paprika.\n\nThe cooking fire was made in a shallow earth pit.\n\nBeans, onions and spices waiting to be stirred.\n\nTavche Gravche stirred and placed near the edges of the coals.\n\nI used the base of a glazed Tajeen for a lid because the curbside pottery seller in Cairo did not have a lid large enough for the casserole. I had purchased the Tajeen in Morocco. The covered casserole came to a low boil and cooked for 5 hours. The beans were still not fully cooked because the heat level of the fire had not be maintained during the day. Undercooked beans can cause food poisoning, so I cooked the dish for another 2 hours over a more intense heat. The Tavche Gravche was delicious. It was actually easier to cook in the casserole than in the \"cooking pot\" that I used during Pennsic 2006. The glazed casserole was far easier to clean than the unglazed cooking pot used in 2006.\n\nThe second cooking experiments was with the SPCA (Stewpot Period Culinary Association).\n\nLentils were soaked for 6 hours, drained, then placed to cook in the Egyptian casserole with water and salt.\n\nThe second day of cooking experiments used a separate firepit to create coals for cooking.\n\nI used fresh onions for the Mjaddarah.\n\nOne and a half onions were chopped by hand for the dish and kept in a smaller Egyptian casserole.\n\nThe chopped onion was fried in a flat bottom frying pan made by Lynn McAdams (SCA Elaine Ladd from the Middle Kingdom). It took approximately 30 minutes to fry the onion in two batches. The frying pan was already hot becaused Lynn McAdams had fried onions in it for her bean dish. Olive oil was used in the frying.\n\nThe lentils and onions cooked in the covered casserole for 4 hours, then were removed from the coals to cool. The last step in the preparation was to add one cup of commercially produced sour cream, and stir. Normally, I would have preferred plain yoghurt, but it was not available. The sour cream was a perfect match for the lintels and fried onions. Several individuals at the resulting feast indicated that they would not have been able to eat the yoghurt (for medical reasons), but that the sour cream created no problems. The Mjaddarah was excellent and two individuals asked for the recipe.\n\nLynn McAdams (SCA Elaine Ladd from the Middle Kingdom) cooking a meal of beans, sausage and onions.\n\nLynn McAdams was very pleased to get a rolling boil in her cooking pot containing the beans, sausage and onions.\n\nAnother set of cookfire experiments included roasting a chick and a beef roast using string.\n\nOne problem with string roasting method is that the string can fail if the heat from the fire is too intense.\n\nThe heat from the burning wood eventually proved too hot for string roasting. The string roasting experiment was moved to the area above the cooking pots in the bed of coals. That heat level was perfect.\n\nA chicken was also prepared in a dutch oven made from cast iron.\n\nSeasoned leg of lamb prepared in a dutch oven made from cast iron.\n\nThe SPCA cooking experiment also included a dozen bluegil fish that were caught from Cooper Lake and immediately cleaned.\n\nThe fish were cooked in olive oil in a metal wok over the fire by Lord Stefan li Rous (Mark Harris). They had been salted and seasoned with Aunti Awren's Rusian Spice mix.\n\nLamb cut up and served in the smaller Egyptian casserole.\n\nDeboned chicken that was cooked in the dutch oven.\n\nThe SPCA cooking experiment was conducted in Flip's camp while a blacksmith student was creating a fire poker under the supervision of Flip.\nWebpage created 13 August 2007 `",

According to Celentano (2012): \u201cConsumers base their decisions on convenience, ambiance, budget, what their family wants, menu options, and the brand of restaurant \u201c. This means that all types of restaurants are trying to meet all or most of their customers\u2019 needs. There are even restaurants that meet these customer desires by serving sushi on a conveyor belt. There are few of these restaurants in the United States, but the idea has been introduced from Tokyo and the unique experience has received a positive response from consumers. Because food grade conveyor belts are already being used for industrial factories,...\ntracking img",

        "text":"Food security and food self sufficiency in Bhutan\n\nNicholas Minot, Nidup Pelijor\n\nFood security is defined as \u201cthe access for all people at all times to enough food for a health, active life\u201d (FAO, 1996). In contrast, food self-sufficiency is defined as being able to meet consumption needs (particularly for staple food crops) from own production rather than by buying or importing. There is a long-standing debate on whether food self-sufficiency is a useful strategy to achieve food security. Supporters of this proposition argue that relying on the market for to meet food needs is a risky strategy because of volatility in food prices and possible interruption in supplies. The opposing view is that it is costly for a household (or country) to focus on food self-sufficiency rather than producing according to its comparative advantage and purchasing some of its food requirements from the market. This debate is reflected in the evolution of food policy in Bhutan. Early Five-Year Plans (FYPs) called for self-sufficiency in staple foods, while more recent FYPs focus on the goal of food security. This paper examines three questions related to food security and food self-sufficiency in Bhutan.",

The content of nitrogen soluble in water (WSN), in 2% trichloroacetic acid (2% TCA-N), in 12% TCA (TCA-N) and in 5% phosphotungstic acid (5% PTA-N), and the pH and salt-in-moisture concentration were measured throughout the ripening period (sampling at 0, 7, 21 and 35 days) and the cheese-making season (sampling in November, February and May). Proteolysis in 35-day-old Serra cheese was quantitatively high [average values of 34.6% and 11.9% for WSN\/TN (total nitrogen) and 2% TCA-N\/TN, respectively], but qualitatively low (average values of 5.8% and 1.2% for 12% TCA-N\/TN and 5% PTA-N\/TN, respectively). The ratios WSN\/TN and 2% TCA-N\/TN were lowest for cheeses ripened in February, whereas the ratio 12% TCA-N\/TN was highest for cheeses ripened in November. By 35\u2005days of ripening, the average pH and salt-in-moisture concentration values were 5.2 and 4.8%, respectively. No correlation was found to occur between the measured pH or salt-in-moisture concentration and the values of soluble nitrogen fractions throughout the cheese-making season.\nPeer review:\u00a0yes\nURI:\u00a0http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10400.14\/6679\nVers\u00e3o do Editor:\u00a0The original publication is available at www.springerlink.com\nAparece nas colec\u00e7\u00f5es:ESB - Artigos em revistas internacionais com Arbitragem \/ Papers in international journals with Peer-review\n\nFicheiros deste registo:\nFicheiro Descri\u00e7\u00e3o TamanhoFormato\u00a0\nSecondary proteolysis .pdf895,72 kBAdobe PDFVer\/Abrir\n\nFacebookTwitterDeliciousLinkedInDiggGoogle BookmarksMySpace\nFormato BibTex\u00a0MendeleyEndnote\u00a0Degois\u00a0\n\nTodos os registos no reposit\u00f3rio est\u00e3o protegidos por leis de copyright, com todos os direitos reservados.",

It is something which takes place occasionally. This may be taken to suggest that eating out in the Nordic countries is primarily a leisure activity. However, while this is an accurate portrayal of Denmark and Norway, eating out in Finland and Sweden is somewhat more common and linked to work-life. This difference probably reflects contrasting historical-institutional paths: in Finland and Sweden a food culture emphasizing cooked lunches and dedicated public policies supporting the provisioning of lunches outside the home may have promoted eating out.Multivariate analysis revealed that eating out declines with age. An urbanization effect exists, as residence in a capital city increases the propensity to eat out. There were socio-economic differences in all countries. We hypothesized that education and status would not significantly explain eating out activity after people's gastronomic interest had been controlled for. However, education was statistically significant in Sweden and Norway, and surprisingly status was negatively associated with eating out in Sweden. As expected, eating out was positively associated with income, and it was more frequent among the higher salariat and the self-employed (although not in Norway).\n\nOriginal languageEnglish\nStateAccepted\/In press - 17 Jun 2017\n\n    Research areas\n\n  \u2022 Cross-country comparison, Eating out, Nordic countries, Questionnaire study, Social stratification, Status\n\nID: 180942611",

This paper conducts a factor and sequential typology analysis to identify groups of countries categorized according to five measures of food security\u2014consumption, production, imports, distribution, and agricultural potential\u2014by using indicators from 175 countries. The analysis first identifies five distinct food security groups, characterized by food intake, and then further splits these groups based on the various measures of food production, trade security, and agricultural potential. The results suggest that the general category of \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d is extremely heterogeneous and is not particularly useful if the focus is on issues of food security.

        "text":"The Difference Between Chinese Cusine and the Western Countres\n\nTopics: Nutrition, Culture, American Chinese cuisine Pages: 19 (7085 words) Published: April 27, 2013\n\nThis thesis explores the differences between Chinese and Western dietary culture. In the complex world culture spin, the dietary culture plays an extremely important role in the world culture. The differences between Chinese and Western culture created the differences between Chinese and Western dietary culture. Different countries have their own dietary cultural. Traditional Chinese culture is agricultural culture and land culture, while traditional western culture is animal husbandry culture and ocean culture. These two kinds of cultures reflect diverse life styles in which food is the most representative aspect. In variously cultural contexts, whether it is in concept, objects, kitchen ware, or tableware, these differences are obvious. But as development of the communication and integration of the international, Chinese and western dietary culture will be developed in common communication. This will play a significant role to promote the communication of culture in the world.\n\n\nDiet is not only the premise of social development, but also the paramount material base for human to survive with good health condition. In the early stage of barbarism, like other animals, looking for food to survive is just the instinct for human beings. But when man began to use fire to cook food and they entered the age of civilization, especially the time of cooking with the pottery, the food became the creation made by the human own wisdom and their technology. Then there is the essential difference in diet between human beings and animals that the diet has its cultural nature. Thus the history of human diet is to be this kind of history that human adapt to nature, conquer and reform nature to survive and develop in the nature, and the human dietary culture gradually comes into being in the course of this progress. As an important part of human culture, the dietary culture has a generalized meaning and a narrowed meaning. This thesis discuss the dietary culture in this narrow sense which is the total of material wealth and spirit wealth created and accumulated in the long-term progress of food consumption, and it is the knowledge about what to eat, how to eat and why to eat, including dietary object, dietary tableware and so on.\n\nChina has profound cultural heritage of dietary culture and diet play a foremost role in people\u2019s daily life so that dietary culture take a huge proportion in Chinese culture. Facing the dietary culture from other countries, we should accept or reject them based on ourselves condition. We can\u2019t only chase for enjoyment in taste, because it is harmful to our physical health if we eat too much foreign food which is belong to the high calories food. However, it is obvious that we shouldn\u2019t aimlessly reject all the new objects. Under the influence of entering the WTO and globalization, the international connection has become closer and closer so that the collision and fusion in the dietary culture always happen between Chinese and westerners. Granted, it takes a long time for two different cultures to merge and coexist and there must be an aspect that both sides can\u2019t adapt to each other. If this phenomenon occurs, we should try our best to understand, respect and tolerate another culture in right manner.\n\nA new kind of concept called Fusion Food has another name that is Global Cuisine and it has been popular in the fashionable diet circle in international cities, such as Paris, New York, London, Sydney. Now it is starting to come into China. The connotation of this Fusion Food is to merge the raw material, condiment and cooking skills together in a creative way from countries all over the world. Besides, it introduces the exoticism to the native diet by takes doctrine to discard the dross and select the essential. It is a cooking revolution flagged with fusion. Through the fusion of gourmet food, the thing it brings is not just the food, is more like the enjoyment of a variety...\nContinue Reading\n\nPlease join StudyMode to read the full document\n\nYou May Also Find These Documents Helpful\n\n  \u2022 Essay about The Differences and Reasons of Food Habit between Chinese and Western\n  \u2022 Essay about difference between Chinese and western medium\n  \u2022 The Differences Between Chinese and Western Food Essay\n  \u2022 Differences Between Chinese and Western Education Essay\n  \u2022 The Differences Between Chinese and Western Advertisement Essay\n  \u2022 On Differences Between Chinese and Western Dietary Cultures Essay\n  \u2022 Essay about Aesthetic Differences Between Chinese and Western Poetry\n  \u2022 Chinese and American Education Differences Essay\n\nBecome a StudyMode Member\n\nSign Up - It's Free",

Given the current low price of milk, a lot of producers have decided to process their milk into products with a higher added-value, including butter. However, all milks are not suitable to be transformed into butter. It would thus be useful to be able to predict milk processing properties.\n\nObjectives. The aim of this paper was to study the ability of milk to be processed into butter using infrared spectrophotometry.\n\nMethod. A normalized protocol for the production of butter was developed. Milk samples (n\u00a0=\u00a0110) collected between 2013 and 2016 were analyzed by near and medium infrared spectrometry (315 spectra). Butter samples were also analyzed by visible-near infrared spectrometry (220 spectra). Composition of the products was subsequently assessed using validated prediction equations. Principal components analyses were performed to discriminate samples.\n\nResults. Butter properties seemed to be influenced by seasons and feedings. Water content and color parameters could be predicted on the basis of butter infrared spectra.\n\nConclusions. It was possible to correlate butter characteristics with milk properties. However, it was not possible to predict butter characteristics on the basis of milk near infrared spectra. It could be interesting to try predictions from milk medium infrared spectra.\n\nKeywords : cow milk,\u00a0chemicophysical properties,\u00a0analytical chemistry,\u00a0butter,\u00a0infrared spectrophotometry\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1Milk is not always consumed as such. Indeed, milk can be transformed into various dairy products, including cheese, milk powder and butter (Holroyd, 2013). Butter is a one of the oldest dairy products worldwide (El-Hajjaji et al., 2019). Butter must be composed of at least 80% of milk fat, and of less than 16% of water (Codex Alimentarius, 2018). Conventional methods for analyzing the chemical composition of butter are slow, expensive, and require highly qualified workers (Hermida et al., 2001; Dvorak et al., 2016). Spectroscopic techniques are now widely used in the field of food control. They are often associated with chemometrics, defined by Massart et al. (1997) as a chemical discipline using mathematical and statistical methods to provide maximum chemical information by analyzing chemical data. Infrared (IR) spectrometry is widely used to predict the major components of milk and dairy products (Hermida et al., 2001; Fagan et al., 2009; Abbas et al., 2012; Baeten et al., 2014). Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopies are useful tools for quality control in the food industry (Karoui & De Baerdemaeker, 2007). Those are indeed faster than conventional methods, and require little or no sample pre-treatments (Hermida et al., 2001).\n\n2The dairy sector has faced a lot of changes since 1984, when milk quotas were established by the European Union (EU) in order to limit milk surplus. As a result, the total number of dairy farmers has dramatically decreased, falling from 47,000 in 1984 to 7,000 in 2018 in Belgium (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge de l\u2019Industrie laiti\u00e8re, 2019). Nevertheless, in March 2015, EU removed milk quotas. This evolution led to an increase in milk production and hence to a decrease in milk prices. In Belgium, 6,995 dairy farms are currently identified, with a milk production of around 4 billion liters per year (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge de l\u2019Industrie Laiti\u00e8re, 2019). An alternative for some farmers is to transform milk into dairy products with a higher added-value (Agence wallonne pour la Promotion d\u2019une Agriculture de Qualit\u00e9, 2021). This enables farmers to answer the price decrease by diversifying their sources of income and by favoring local food networks. More than 480 Walloon farmers and 260 Flemish farmers currently transform their milk into butter, yoghurts and cheeses (La Spina, 2016). For the year 2018, butter production in Belgium was 103.5 million kg, including industrial and artisanal butter (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration belge de l\u2019Industrie laiti\u00e8re, 2019). Annual data related to artisanal butter manufacture are not available.\n\n3On-farm transformation is not so easy. It requires technical qualification, as well as time and a thorough feasibility study (La Spina, 2016). It is known that milk processing depends on several factors, including animal age, lactation number and stage, season, diet composition, milk chemical composition and breed (Dal Zotto et al., 2008). In this context, it would be useful for farmers to predict when milk would not be suitable for butter manufacture. The development of easy and fast methods to analyze dairy products would also be of interest. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the processing of Walloon milk into butter, in order to identify the influence of milk properties on the processing and on the final butter characteristics using IR spectrometry techniques.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Milk samples\n\n4A total of 110 milk samples were collected from 10 farms in three Belgian provinces, namely Namur, Brabant Wallon and Hainaut, between 2013 and 2016 (Table\u00a01). The entire milk given by one cow during one milking was collected for 107 of these samples. The three remaining samples were taken from milk tank. Different breeds were considered, namely (a) Holstein (n\u00a0=\u00a089), (b) Jersey (n\u00a0= 12), (c) Holstein\u00a0x Jersey (Kiwi, n\u00a0= 6), (e) Brown Swiss (n\u00a0= 1), (f) dual purpose Belgian Blue (n\u00a0= 1) and (g) Kiwi\u00a0x Maine Anjou (n\u00a0= 1). Milk was collected separately during morning (65 samples) and evening (42 samples) milkings. Information about feedings is presented in table\u00a02. Milk was transported to the laboratory within 3\u00a0h in a 34\u00a0l plastic drum with screw lid closure (CurTec, Rijen, Netherlands) and directly transformed into butter.\n\nImage 100000000000030700000269B0FBE7EB0CD2917B.jpg\n\n2.2. Milk analyses\n\n5Before butter manufacture, each milk sample was characterized. Milk pH was measured using pH meter 340i (WTW, Weilheim, Germany) with electrode LoT406-M6-DXK-S7\/25 (Mettler Toledo, Colombus, OH, USA). Dornic acidity was analyzed in duplicate: 10\u00a0ml of milk were titrated by NaOH (0.111\u00a0M) in the presence of phenolphthalein. Dornic acidity was expressed in tenths of NaOH milliliters. The day of sampling, an aliquot of milk was mixed with 75\u00a0\u00b5L of a blend of Bronopol and methylene blue at the laboratory for further IR analyses. NIR spectra of milk were also obtained using FT-NIR spectrometer MPA (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany). Milk samples were transferred to the Comit\u00e9 du Lait (Battice, Belgium) for MIR analyses, using MIR MilkoScan FT6000 (FOSS, Hiller\u00d8d, Denmark). Mean analysis period was seven 7. On the basis of MIR spectra, the Comit\u00e9 du Lait laboratory provided the total nitrogen content and prediction equations, developed by Soyeurt et al. (2009; 2011), were used to determine milk composition. Predicted components included: minerals (Na, Ca, P, Mg) and fat (saturated fat, SFA; mono-unsaturated fatty acids, MUFA; poly-unsaturated fatty acids, PUFA; short-chain fatty acids, SCFA; medium-chain fatty acids, MCFA; long-chain fatty acids, LCFA).\n\n2.3. Butter manufacture\n\n6Each milk sample was used to manufacture butter in duplicate, following the process described in figure\u00a01. Milk was heated to 39\u00a0\u00b0C and skimmed using cream separator Model 125 (Elecrem, Fresnes, France). Cream collected from a milk sample was divided in order to manufacture two butter batches. Creams were heated to 82\u00a0\u00b0C before being directly dipped into iced water, in order to quickly drop the temperature to 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Creams were then seeded with Flora Danica MSP (CHR Hansen, H\u00d8... (truncated)",

Handlers are firms that produce, process, and distribute organic food. As the middlemen in the supply chain, organic handlers have been unable at times to provide as much of their final product as the market wants and have also found needed ingredients in short supply. A survey of certified organic handlers in the United States reveals that handlers widely use contracts as a means to not only procure needed ingredients but also to develop and maintain strong working relationships with their suppliers. Only a few organic handlers, however, have worked to assist farmers directly with farmers' transition to organic production.\n\nKeywords: organic handler, organic intermediaries, marketing organic food products, procurement, contracts, supplier-handler relationships, vertical coordination, transition to organic\n\nIn this publication...\n\nNeed help with PDFs?\n\nLast updated: Sunday, May 27, 2012\n\nFor more information contact: Carolyn Dimitri and Lydia Oberholtzer\n\nShare or Save this Page",

The complete story of the early cultivation of coffee in the old and new worlds is told in chapter II, which deals with the history of the propagation of the coffee plant.\n\nLa Roque[314] was the first to tell how the plant was cultivated and the berries prepared for market in Arabia, where it was brought from Abyssinia.\n\nThe Arabs raised it from seed grown in nurseries, transplanting it to plantations laid out in the foot-hills of the mountains, to which they conducted the mountain streams by ingeniously constructed small channels to water the roots. They built trenches three feet wide and five feet deep, lining them with pebbles to cause the water to sink deep into the earth with which the trenches were filled, to preserve the moisture from too rapid evaporation. These were so constructed that the water could be turned off into other channels when the fruit began to ripen. In plantations exposed to the south, a kind of poplar tree was planted along the trenches to supply needful shade.\n\nLa Roque noted that the coffee trees in Yemen were planted in lines, like the apple trees in Normandy; and that when they were much exposed to the sun, the shade poplars were regularly introduced between the rows.\n\nSuch cultivation as the plant received in early Abyssinia and Arabia was crude and primitive at best. Throughout the intervening centuries, there has been little improvement in Yemen; but modern cultural methods obtain in the Harar district in Abyssinia.\n\nLike the Arabs in Yemen, the Harari cultivated in small gardens, employing the same ingenious system of irrigation from mountain springs to water the roots of the plants at least once a week during the dry season. In Yemen and in Abyssinia the ripened berries were sun-dried on beaten-earth barbecues.\n\nThe European planters who carried the cultivation of the bean to the Far East and to America followed the best Arabian practise, changing, and sometimes improving it, in order to adapt it to local conditions.\nCoffee Cultivation in General\n\nToday the commercial growers of coffee on a large scale practise intensive cultivation methods, giving the same care to preparing their plantations and maintaining their trees as do other growers of grains and fruits. As in the more advanced methods of arboriculture, every effort is made to obtain the maximum production of quality coffee consistent with the smallest outlay of money and labor. Experimental stations in various parts of the world are constantly working to improve methods and[Pg 198]products, and to develop types that will resist disease and adverse climatic conditions.\n\nWhile cultivation methods in the different producing countries vary in detail of practise, the principles are unchanging. Where methods do differ, it is owing principally to local economic conditions, such as the supply and cost of labor, machinery, fertilizers, and similar essential factors.\n\nImplements Used in Early Arabian Coffee CultureImplements Used in Early Arabian Coffee Culture\n1, Plow. 2 and 3, Mattocks. 4, Hatchet and sickle. Top, Seeder Implement\n\nSoil.\u00a0Rocky ground that pulverizes easily\u2014and, if possible, of volcanic origin\u2014is best for coffee; also, soil rich in decomposed mold. In Brazil the best soil is known as\u00a0terra roxa, a topsoil of red clay three or four feet thick with a gravel subsoil.\n\nClimate.\u00a0The natural habitat of the coffee tree (all species) is tropical Africa, where the climate is hot and humid, and the soil rich and moist, yet sufficiently friable to furnish well drained seed beds. These conditions must be approximated when the tree is grown in other countries. Because the trees and fruit generally can not withstand frost, they are restricted to regions where the mean annual temperature is about 70\u00b0 F., with an average minimum about 55\u00b0, and an average maximum of about 80\u00b0. Where grown in regions subject to more or less frost, as in the northernmost parts of Brazil\u2019s coffee-producing district, which lie almost within the south temperate zone, the coffee trees are sometimes frosted, as was the case in 1918, when about forty percent of the S\u00e3o Paulo crop and trees suffered.\n\nGenerally speaking, the most suitable climate for coffee is a temperate one within the tropics; however, it has been successfully cultivated between latitudes 28\u00b0 north and 38\u00b0 south.\n\nRainfall.\u00a0Although able to grow satisfactorily only on well drained land, the coffee tree requires an abundance of water, about seventy inches of rainfall annually, and must have it supplied evenly throughout the year. Prolonged droughts are fatal; while, on the other hand, too great a supply of water tends to develop the wood of the tree at the expense of the flowers and fruit, especially in low-lying regions.\n\nAltitude.\u00a0Coffee is found growing in all altitudes, from sea-level up to the frost-line, which is about 6,000 feet in the tropics.\u00a0Robusta and\u00a0liberica varieties of coffee do best in regions from sea-level up to 3,000 feet, while\u00a0arabica flourishes better at the higher levels.\n\nCarvalho says that the coffee plant needs sun, but that a few hours daily exposure is sufficient. Hilly ground has the advantage of offering the choice of a suitable exposure, as the sun shines on it for only a part of the day. Whether it is the early morning or the afternoon sun that enables the plant to attain its optimum conditions is a question of locality.\n\nCross Section of Mountain Slope in Yemen, Arabia, Showing Coffee Terraces\nCross Section of Mountain Slope in Yemen, Arabia, Showing Coffee Terraces\nThese miniature plantations are found chiefly along the caravan route between Hodeida and Sanaa\n\n[Pg 199]\n\nClearing Virgin Forest for a Coffee Estate in MexicoClearing Virgin Forest for a Coffee Estate in Mexico\nCoffee Nursery Under a Bamboo Roof in ColombiaCoffee Nursery Under a Bamboo Roof in Colombia\n\n[Pg 200]\n\nIn Mexico, Romero tells us, the highlands of Soconusco have the advantage that the sun does not shine on the trees during the whole of the day. On the higher slopes of the Cordilleras\u2014from 2,500 feet above sea-level\u2014clouds prevail during the summer season, when the sun is hottest, and are frequently present in the other seasons, after ten o\u2019clock in the morning. These keep the trees from being exposed to the heat of the sun during the whole of the day. Perhaps to this circumstance is due the superior excellence of certain coffees grown in Mexico, Colombia, and Sumatra at an altitude of 3,000 feet to 4,000 feet above sea-level.\n\nRichard Spruce, the botanist, in his notes on South America, as quoted by Alfred Russel Wallace,[315] refers to \u201ca zone of the equatorial Andes ranging between 4,000 and 6,000 feet altitude, where the best flavored coffee is grown.\u201d\n\nPropagation.\u00a0Coffee trees are grown most generally from seeds selected from trees of known productivity and longevity; although in some parts of the world propagation is done from shoots or cuttings. The seed method is most general, however, the seeds being either propagated in nursery beds, or planted at once in the spot where the mature tree is to stand. In the latter case\u2014called planting at stake\u2014four or five seeds are planted, much as corn is sown; and after germination, all but the strongest plant are removed.\n\nWhere the nursery method is followed, the choicest land of the plantation is chosen for its site; and the seeds are planted in forcing beds, sometimes called cold-frames. When the plants are to be transplanted direct to the plantation, the seeds are generally sown six inches apart and in rows separated by the same distance, and are covered with only a slight sprinkling of earth. When the plants are to be transferred from the first bed to another, and then to the plantation, the seeds are sown more thickly; and the plants are \u201cpricked\u201d out as needed, and set out in another forcing bed.\n\nDuring the six to seven weeks required for the coffee seed to germinate, the soil must be kept moist and shaded and thoroughly weeded. If the trees are to be grown without shade, the young plants are gradually exposed to the sun, to harden them, before they begin their existence in the plantation proper.\n\nCoffee Tree Nursery, Panajabal, Pochuta, GuatemalaCoffee Tree Nursery, Panajabal, Pochuta, Guatemala\nDrying Grounds and Factory in the Preanger RegencyDrying Grounds and Factory in the Preanger Regency\nNative Transport, Field to Factory, at Dramaga, Near BuitenzorgNative Transport, Field to Factory, at Dramaga, Near Buitenzorg\n\n[Pg 201]\n\nConsiderable experimental work has been done in renewing trees by grafting, notably in Java; but practically all commercial planters follow the seed method.\n\nCoffee Growing Under Shade, Porto RicoCoffee Growing Under Shade, Porto Rico\n\nPreparing the Plantation.\u00a0Before transplanting time has come, the plantation itself has been made ready to receive the young plants.

The soil most suitable is friable, sandy, or even gravelly, with an abundance of rocks to keep the soil comparatively cool and well drained, as well as to supply a source of food by action of the weather.

Red Bull is an adaptation of the Thai energy drink Krating Daeng, which translates as \"Red Bull\". Based on market share, it is the most popular energy drink in the world. The company was founded by Thai national Chaleo Yoovidhya and Austrian national Dietrich Mateschitz. Red Bull's slogan is \"it gives you wings\" and the product is aggressively marketed through advertising, tournament sponsorship sports team ownerships (Red Bull Racing, Red Bull Salzburg, Red Bull NewYork) and celebrity endorsements. In 2009 it was discovered that RedBull Cola exported from Austria contained trace amounts of cocaine. Mateschitz adapted the product to Western tastes by diluting it, lowering the caffeine content, and adding carbonation. Red Bull essentially invented the functional energy\u00b4 beverage category in Western markets, named thus because the beverages were meant to be consumed for energy, not enjoyment purposes. Both the Thai version and Mateschitz\u2019s version of Red Bull contained the following energy-enhancing ingredients: caffeine, taurine, and glucuronolactone. These three ingredients, along with a variety of sugars and vitamins, contributed to the following properties claimed by Red Bull: Improves physical endurance, Stimulates metabolism and helps eliminates waste substances, Improves overall feeling of well-being, Improves reaction speed and concentration, Increases mental alertness. Red Bull did not define a specific demographic or psychographic segment as its target market. Rather, the company sought to reach a broad range of consumers based on their need for a stimulating drink. By not defining a narrow consumer target, Red Bull ensured that it could grow into numerous market segments. In mature markets, Red Bull achieved its highest penetration in the 14\u00b119 age range, followed by the 20\u00b129 range. On Product review, Red Bull is a sweet, caffeinated drink aimed to give consumers the high energy kick. Available only in rather expensive 250ml cans, 350ml bottles, with 4 packs and only two flavours (original or sugar-free). It contains caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins. Founded in 1984 by Austrian businessman Dietrich Mateschitz, Red Bull has become the world\u2019s leading energy drink, a staple in many young and active people\u2019s lives. For Competitors, big global companies such as Coca Cola and Pepsi have introduced their own energy drink versions to their product base. Mother (by Coca Cola), Amp (Pepsi), V, Battery, Red Eye and Bennu being just some in the ever-growing energy drink market. Competition also presents itself in original sports drinks, such as Gatorade (Pepsi) and Powerade (Coca Cola). Furthermore, premixed alcoholic drinks like the Smirnoff range form part of the competition. Red Bull has becoming hugely successful and operates within the global soft drink market place. Within the soft drink industry its niche is the energy drink market, of which Mateschitz was largely responsible for creating. Red Bull currently is the leading energy drink across the entire globe. It holds 70% of the market worldwide. Once the drink was passed by health ministries, Red Bull entered the Austrian market, soon thereafter then moved into Germany, United Kingdom and the USA by 1997.\n\nQuestion 1 (a)\nWhat created Red Bull\u2019s success? Where is the core franchise and benefit? Has the product\u2019s positioning changed over time?\n\nThe launch of Red Bull has been the most successful beverage launch of the last decade. It\u00b4s success is due to partnering a quality product with well-thought out original communication strategy. Which resulted in establishes Red Bull, not as fashion phenomenon, but as premium brand with continues growth. Red Bull\u00b4s real product benefits justified a premium price. It is by far the most expensive non-alcoholic drink on the market. Red Bull is 3 to 6 times more expensive than Coke.
