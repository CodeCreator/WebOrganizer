You are reminded of this by the salt refill indicator light on the control panel which will illuminate when the salt has finished. Important: The salt refill indicator light on the control panel can remain illuminated for 2-6 hours after the salt has been replenished, assuring the dishwasher remains on. If you are using salts that take longer to dissolve then this can take longer. The function of the dishwasher is not affected. 16 Caution: Only fill with salt just before starting one of the complete washing programmes (not the RINSE AND HOLD programme). This will prevent any grains of salt or salty water, which may have been spilled, remaining on the bottom of the machine for any period of time, which could cause corrosion. The rinse-aid The rinse-aid ensures brilliant crockery and also helps it to dry. The storage compartment built in to the in side of the door can hold about 110 ml of rinse-aid, which will be sufficient for between 16 and 40 dishwashing programmes, according to the dosage setting. Filling up the rinse-aid Open the container by turning the lid (A) anticlockwise (Fig. Pour the rinse-aid into the filler opening until the indicator (B) on the side of the cover turns completely dark (i. e. until the container is full) B m a x 6543 21 A BR01 BR03 Rinse aid replenishment indicator Top up with rinse aid when the rinse aid control light on the control panel flashes (approx. Clean up any rinse aid spilt during filling with an absorbent cloth to avoid excess foaming during the next wash. 17 Setting the rinse aid quantity to be added The correct dosage of the rinse-aid should be regulated on the basis of the shine and drying results. This makes it easier to remove small pieces of cutlery. 22 Important note!To prevent the full cutlery basket from inadvertently unfolding when being taken out, place your hand right round the two-piece handle and hold it firmly. \u00cb Place the cutlery basket on a firm support (table, worktop) and unfold both handle parts. UI20 UI25 \u00cb After unfolding, fold back both handle parts. Long bladed knives stored in an upright position are a potential hazard. Long and\/or sharp items of cutlery such as carving knives must be positioned horizontally in the upper basket. Take care when loading or unloading sharp items such as knives. 23 The upper basket The upper basket is designed for plates (dessert plates, saucers, dinner plates up to 24 cm in diameter), salad bowls, cups and glasses; these should be arranged as shown in the pictures. Glasses with long stems can be placed upside-down in the raised cup-racks US08 IEC 436 \/ DIN 44990 US07 The cup-rack on the left folds upwards to increase your loading flexibility. Before closing the door, ensure that the spray arms can rotate freely. 24 Adjusting the height of the upper basket If washing very large plates (over 27 cm and up to 31 cm in diameter) you can load them in the lower basket after moving the upper basket to the higher position as follows: Move the front runner stops (A) of the upper basket outward and slide the basket out. Refit the basket in the higher position and replace the stops (A) in their original position. A RC01 When the top basket is in the higher position it will only take plates up to 20 cm in diameter and you will not be able to use raised cup racks. 25 Operating instructions Set and start the programme Push the plug into the socket. The indicator lights corresponding to the programme and the phases of the programme will illuminate. The control lights of \"rinse aid\" and \"salt\" may also illuminate if refilling is necessary. Until the door is partially or totally opened you are still able to modify or change the setting of the programme; by simply pressing the on\/off pushbutton. After 5 seconds the selected programme will start (it is still possible to change the setting of the programme if you press the on\/off pushbutton within these 5 seconds). The lights corresponding to the phases of the cycle will turn off except the light of the phase under way. At the end of the programme The machine stops automatically. [. . . ] Note: The panel should be fitted before positioning the machine. For built-in appliances only Please consult the enclosed template with the installation instructions. Please note the following before installing: When the door is opened after the programme has ended, steam escapes from the machine as a normal operation feature and may cause nonwatertight bonded worktops to swell and warp.

The natural air circulation inside the appliance produces different temperature zones. It is recommended to set the appliance to the temperature of the drink which is to be stored at the coolest temperature. You can store wine on this level, as a higher serving temperature is recommended. The average temperature range is in the lowest area of the compartment. Practical tips for storing wine S Unpack bottles of wine do not leave in crates or cardboard boxes before storing in the refrigerator compartment. S The open bottle shelves are especially suitable because they do not interrupt the air circulation. As a result, the atmospheric humidity which condenses on the bottles quickly dries again. S Before the wine is drunk, it should be \"warmed up\" (chambr\u00e9): Place e. g. Sparkling wine and Champagne should be cooled in the refrigerator shortly before drinking. S Remember that wine should always be cooled slightly lower than the ideal serving temperature, as its temperature increases by 1 to 2 \u00b0C as soon as it is poured into a glass!

        "text":"Home Business Tenancy Agreement for Furnished Bedsit\n\nHome Business Tenancy \u2013 Furnished Bedsit (Rent Excl of Outgoings)\n\n\nThis Home Business Tenancy (AST) \u2013 Furnished Bedsit (Rent Exclusive of Outgoings) should be used where a landlord wishes to grant an assured shorthold tenancy (AST) of a furnished bedsit to a tenant who will be running a \u201chome business\u201d from the premises. Usually the tenancy will have a term of 6 or 12 months.\n\nThis document is modelled on the AST Furnished Bedsit (Exclusive Rent) template from our Assured Shorthold Tenancies subfolder. The AST templates in that subfolder prohibit the tenant from using the property for any business purposes. This template allows the tenant to operate a \u201chome business\u201d from the bedsit, but any other type of business use is not permitted.\n\nA home business is defined in Section 43ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 as \u201ca business of a kind which might reasonably be carried on at home\u201d but the definition excludes businesses involving the supply of alcohol for consumption at the premises. Further exclusions may be set out in regulations.\n\nThe concept of the home business tenancy was introduced in October 2015. A home business tenancy does not attract security of tenure as a business lease under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. This gives comfort and certainty to residential landlords, allowing them to let premises to tenants who will run a business from the premises without any risk that the letting will be deemed to be a business lease.\n\nThis agreement can either give blanket permission for home business use or can state that home business use is permitted at the bedsit subject to the tenant obtaining the landlord\u2019s prior written consent.\n\nA bedsit tends to be a self-contained unit comprising a living area and a sleeping area. The bedsit may include a small kitchen or kitchenette and\/or bathroom facilities. Alternatively, kitchen and\/or bathroom facilities may be shared with other occupiers of the house in which the bedsit is situated.\n\nThis document provides for the tenant to pay for outgoings, such as council tax, utilities charges, telephone and broadband and cleaning of the communal areas, in addition to the rent. If the rent is to include outgoings, please use the HBT Furnished Bedsit (Inclusive).\n\nAn Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) is the usual form of tenancy granted by private landlords. Unlike other forms of residential tenancy, a tenant under an AST has virtually no security of tenure. As long as the proper procedures are followed, a landlord can regain possession of the property after six months.\n\nAlthough the majority of private lettings are ASTs, there are some residential tenancies that cannot be assured shortholds. The main exclusions are lettings to companies or other non-natural persons (the tenant under an AST must be one or more individuals), high value properties (where the annual rent exceeds \u00a3100,000), lettings where the tenant does not occupy the property as his only or principal home (e.g. a second home) and resident landlords. Lettings such as these are contractual tenancies \u2013 see our Contractual Tenancy Agreements.\n\nThis document complies with the Housing Act 1988 (as amended) and the tenancy deposit legislation and takes account of the OFT\u2019s 2005 Guidance on unfair terms in tenancy agreements.\n\nIf the landlord requires a guarantor for the tenant, e.g. because the tenant does not have a satisfactory credit history or references, the Tenancy Agreement Guarantee should be used in addition.\n\nThis Home Business Tenancy (AST) \u2013 Furnished Bedsit (Rent Exclusive of Outgoings) sets out the main details at the beginning, being the parties\u2019 names, the address of the property, the term and the monthly rent. An Inventory should be completed and attached to the tenancy agreement to record the condition of the property and the furniture and contents.\n\nClause 1 is the grant of the tenancy. The tenant is given rights to use communal parts of the house, as specified by the landlord.\n\nClause 2 contains standard legal interpretation clauses.\n\nClause 3 deals with the tenancy deposit. The amount of the deposit should be inserted in clause 3.1. In clause 3.4 the landlord must specify whether the deposit will be protected in an insurance scheme or a custodial scheme. Please see the \u201cGuidance on Tenancy Deposit Protection for Assured Shorthold Tenancies\u201d for details of the different schemes and the procedural steps the landlord must take. Please note that this clause should not be used if the landlord is protecting the deposit in the Tenancy Deposit Scheme (one of the insurance schemes). That scheme has its own clause which should be substituted \u2013 please see the Prescribed Information and Clauses document on the TDS website http:\/\/www.tds.gb.com\/agents-and-landlords-documents-and-forms.html.\n\nClause 4 contains the tenant\u2019s covenants. These cover payment of rent and other outgoings (council tax and utilities), repair and maintenance, use (including reference to home business use), allowing the landlord access for inspections and end-of-tenancy arrangements. Clause 4 includes covenants requiring the tenant to observe the terms of the landlord\u2019s insurance policy and any title documents such as a superior lease. These covenants will only have effect if the landlord has given the tenant copies of the relevant documents.\n\nClause 5 provides for interest to be paid on overdue rent.\n\nClause 6 is the forfeiture clause. This allows the landlord to forfeit (i.e. bring to an end) the tenancy if the rent is at least 21 days overdue or if there has been a substantial breach of any of the tenant\u2019s obligations. Landlords should note that it will still be necessary to go to court in order to obtain possession of the property; the forfeiture clause does not have quite the effect it purports to have but it is important to have the clause in a tenancy agreement, otherwise the court will be unable to order possession during the fixed term of the tenancy.\n\nClause 7 contains the landlord\u2019s covenants. These cover quiet enjoyment (the right of the tenant to use the property without interference) and repair.\n\nClause 8 is an optional break clause for each party. Landlords should note that, as well as serving a notice to exercise the break, they must also serve a notice under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988. The break notice will only bring the fixed term of the tenancy to an end. A section 21 notice is needed in respect of the periodic tenancy which will automatically arise once the fixed term has ended.\n\nClause 9 will contain the parties\u2019 addresses for service of documents. Section 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 provides that rent is not lawfully due from a tenant unless the landlord has provided him with an address where notices are served. It is vital that the tenant is given an up to date address for the landlord.\n\nClause 10 is a jurisdiction clause.\n\nOptional phrases \/ clauses are enclosed in square brackets. These should be read carefully and selected so as to be compatible with one another. Unused options should be removed from the document.\n\nThis document is in open format. Either enter the requisite details in the highlighted fields or adjust the wording to suit your purposes.\u00a0\n\nOnce you have purchased access to the appropriate document folder click on the \u201cDownload Document\u201d button below.
