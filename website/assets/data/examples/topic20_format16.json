        "text":"ERROR 1: Invalid username and\/or password.\n\nThe Nature of the Virtual Private Server Hosting Business\n\nA VPS hosting server is a virtual private web hosting server configured on a physical machine, which allows people to acquire their own web hosting server to store content. It offers the best balance between price and performance, so it is frequently the favored option for resource-swallowing web pages that cannot be accommodated on a shared website hosting server. Since a number of individuals maintain their own VPS hosting server on the same machine, all system resources can be availed of, which decreases the fee per user. Each and every private virtual web server offers root privileges, which enables persons to install any software or script libraries that may be required for specific apps to function.\n\nStrong Sides of the Virtual Private Web Server Hosting Solution\n\nThe upside of keeping a virtual server is that it is absolutely autonomous from the remaining Virtual Private Server hosting accounts on the server. It can be restarted, updated, and can even offer a separate OS than those of the other VPS accounts on that physical machine. It is actually like a dedicated hosting server, but a VPS costs just a fraction of the cost of a dedicated web hosting server.\n\nLimitations of the Virtual Server Web Hosting Solution\n\nEach VPS hosting package includes certain web space, web traffic and CPU load restrictions. The website hosting companies are offering various packages so each user can pick the most relevant package for their necessities. A less advanced private virtual server may be utilized to store one single website, whereas a more advanced one would be a better environment for keeping a bunch of web sites and not bothering about resources. 100 Web Space is among the top web hosting companies that are offering a variety of VPS hosting plans.\n\nWebspace Hosting CP Alternatives: Hepsia, cPanel, DirectAdmin, etc.\n\nThe website content on a VPS web server is managed through a website hosting CP just like any other cheap shared web hosting package. This may be the site hosting Control Panel that the hosting corporation is furnishing, or any other webspace hosting CP that the client avails of - Hepsia, cPanel, DirectAdmin, Plesk, H-Sphere, and so on. All website files, email mailboxes, databases and domains can be administered via the hosting Control Panel, and given GUIs also offer various management levels - master reseller, reseller, user, and so on. This unlocks numerous options for business as the private virtual web hosting server owners can resell web hosting accounts or have resellers of their own. More experienced users can administer everything through an SSH console as well.\n\nParallels Virtuozzo Containers - A Server Virtualization Tool\n\nAll necessary web hosting server, FTP, MySQL, etc. software is pre-installed on the VPS web server by default, so there is no need to bother about that. Software updates, installations, restarting operations, etc. are all performed through a virtualization backend that allows the user to manage the VPS through a graphical user interface, which renders the handling of a virtual private web hosting server simpler and more intuitional. A suitable example of such a platform is Parallels Virtuozzo Containers. The administrator back-end is also used to set up and retrieve backups, thus saving you the time you'd otherwise have had to spend waiting for the provider's support team to accomplish these assignments.\n\nVPS Hosting - a Reasonably Priced and Reliable Service\n\nAn essential feature of the private virtual web server hosting package are the so-called \"burstable\" resources. If a particular site is producing high server load or nears the allowance at a certain moment, supplementary resources are allotted to this private virtual server in case they are available on the machine. This greatly helps to keep all web sites online and makes the VPS web hosting server a steady and reliable hosting environment.\n\nA Virtual Private Server - The Right Choice When You Need More Power\n\nA virtual server is a great choice for frequently visited web portals that need lots of resources. It is sufficiently powerful but simultaneously it is much more affordable than a dedicated server hosting. If the hosting distributor provides a number of diverse packages, upgrading from one to the other is also easy and no site transfer will be necessary, therefore there will be no downtime as far as the domains that are kept on the virtual private web hosting server are concerned. The administration is not much different than that of a shared web space hosting user account, but the performance is much stronger in terms of stability and speed.\n\nMonthly Charge\nWeb Server Space\nWebsite Traffic\nMemory (RAM)\nCPU Share\nDedicated IP Address\nService Uninterruptedness",

OpsCentral-on-Demand (OCOD) offers a complete browser-based experience without compromise. There are no special software to install and maintain. The promise of OCOD is the empowerment of the contact center to manage and administer all aspects of the operation as and when required \u2013 with zero downtime, no engineers needed. You will have real time statistics, updated every 5 seconds, to make critical decisions and make changes in real time. You will be able to easily change the IVR call flow and prompts, routing rules and agent skills on the fly \u2013 all without any downtime.\n\n100% Call Recording\n\nAll calls, in and out, will be automatically recorded by OpsCentral-on-Demand. Recorded calls can then be searched, retrieved and played back via the browser-based user interface \u2013 Again, no special software needed. Recorded calls are kept in the system for a minimal period of 3 months. Longer storage options or archiving services are available should you require.\n\nAwesome User Interface\n\nWe design our user interface (UI) to be clean and context sensitive, showing only what is necessary when it is necessary, without all that clutter. We also want a user interface familiar to most users so that training can be kept minimal. And what better UI to adopt than the ubiquitous web browser. OpsCentral-on-Demand is completely web browser based. All users \u2013 agents, supervisors, administrators, etc \u2013 login from a single URL to access all functions. With a browser based UI, OpsCentral-on-Demand can truly run anywhere. There are no applications to install. OCOD is not affected by most enterprise network restrictions or push-down install dependencies for updates.\n\nCampaign, Skill and VIP Routing\n\nIf you have multiple hotlines, you can create a campaign per hotline. Within a campaign, you can create IVR flow and route calls based on language (English, Mandarin\u2026) and product (Sales, Billing\u2026) chosen. Calls will be routed to the highest skilled agents. OpsCentral-on-Demand\u2019s SLA and Routing Engine is highly flexible, allowing you to define separate SLA and routing rules on per language per product basis. Priority routing is also in-built, where your VIP customers can bypass the IVR options by keying in their issued priority PIN. VIP customers can be configured to jump to the front of the queue so as to be served next by your best available agent.\n\nReal Time Monitoring\n\nWe are all very visual creatures. We interpret visual information at a much faster and effective rate than written words. In OpsCentral-on-Demand, we convert complex information regarding your centre into visualizations that are easier to understand and react to. Since our first version in 2001, we have always \u201cwow\u201d our customers and their customers on the rich, real time visualizations of the entire contact center operations.
