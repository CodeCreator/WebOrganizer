Was this article helpful?\n\nRacing Betting Rules\n\n\nThe following specific rules govern the end user's use of all the Operator\/Platform Provider's (the \"Operator\") interactive racing betting products and services offered on www.sbobet.com. They form part of the Operator's General Term & Conditions, which apply to all the interactive and wagering products and services the Operator offers to individuals who register for or are holders of a betting account (the \u201cEnd User\u201d) with the Operator. To the extent there is any inconsistency between the General Terms and Conditions and any of these Racing Betting Rules, the General Terms and Conditions shall prevail.\n\nThroughout these Racing Betting Rules, any reference to \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\" refers to the Operator, as noted in the General Terms and Conditions as providing the relevant services.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Ante post bets on horseracing are bets placed prior to the final declaration stage of a horse race (when the final field of runners is known).\n1.2 Ante post bets are placed on the basis of \u201call in\u201d meaning that if the horse does not run or participate in the race, the bet is a loser.\n1.3 Notwithstanding Rule 1.2 of this Horse Racing Rules above, if a horse race is postponed to another day:\n\n(a) Ante post bets placed before the entries have closed shall stand and shall only be made void if:\n(i) the race is abandoned or made void; or\n(ii) a horse is balloted out under the Jockey Club Rules of Racing; or\n(iii) the venue for the race is altered.\n(b) Ante post bets placed after the entries have closed will be void, except when:\n(i) the race is run at a later date at the same venue; or\n(ii) the entries are not re-opened.\n\n\n2.1 The Operator reserves the option to offer \u201cNon-runner, No Bet\u201d (\u201cNRNB\u201d) on the ante post horseracing markets prior to the final declaration stage.\n2.2 The decision to offer NRNB, and the timing as to when this offer is made, is at the sole discretion of the Operator.\n2.3 The Operator is under no obligation to offer NRNB at any time on any of its ante post horserace betting markets.\n2.4 The Operator will state on the relevant pages of the website http:\/\/www.sbobet.com\/ (the \u201cWebsite\u201d) when specific ante post markets have NRNB status.\n2.5 When the Operator declares NRNB on a specific ante post market offered by the Operator then:\n\n(a) all ante post bets placed after the declaration of NRNB by the Operator are no longer placed on an \u201call in\u201d basis for that market.\n(b) ante post bets placed on a horse after the Operator declares NRNB in a specific race will be refunded if:\n(i) that horse is not subsequently declared at the final declaration stage; or\n(ii) that horse is a non-runner.\n\n2.6 All ante post bets placed prior to the point at which the Operator declares NRNB on a specific race remain subject to Rules 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 of this Horse Racing Rules above.\n\n\n\nThe Operator offers pari-mutuel (Tote pool) betting on international horse racing. You agree that your use of the Operator\u2019s pari-mutuel betting service on the Website is at your sole risk.\n\n1.1 The Operator has agreements with the following totalisator operators (\u201cHost Tote\u201d) allowing the Operator to accept bets at Host Tote odds on horse racing:\n\n  \u2022 UK Tote\n  \u2022 Irish Tote\n  \u2022 South African Racing (including offering Singapore and Dubai racing pools operated by SAFTOTE)\n  \u2022 North and South American Racing operated by TSG Service UG\n\n1.2 By opening an account with the Operator you will be deemed to have read and accepted these Horse Racing Rules which constitute part of the Operator\u2019s General Terms and Conditions of use as the legally binding agreement between the Operator and you. It is your responsibility to be fully aware of the terms of these Horse Racing Rules before placing a bet.\n\n\n2.1 When you make a Tote bet on international racing through the Operator, the Operator is acting as counterparty to your bet. Customers\u2019 bets are placed with the Host Totes by the Operator and entered directly into the Host Totes\u2019 live pools (commingling).\n2.2 In this respect, you authorise the Operator:\n\n(a) to place the bet with the relevant Host Tote;\n(b) to take in any resulting winnings on your behalf;\n(c) to credit any winnings to your SBOBET betting account.\n\n2.3 Your bets are subject to the rules and regulations of the individual Host Totes as well as to these specific Horse Racing Rules for pari-mutuel betting and the Operator\u2019s General Terms and Conditions of use.\n2.4 The terms and conditions of the individual Host Totes can be found at the links below:\n\nThese Host Tote terms and conditions contain information on, amongst other topics:\n\n  \u2022 Pool deductions;\n  \u2022 Minimum stakes;\n  \u2022 Pool betting types and how they are settled;\n  \u2022 Conditions for void bets, non-runners, dead-heats.\n\n2.5 In the event of any bet not being transmitted to, received by, or otherwise accepted by a Host Tote for any reason, including but not limited to, mechanical, communication, human error or failure, no bet will have been placed, or be deemed to have been placed, on your behalf.\n2.6 Under no circumstances will the Operator take on the liability for the bet or otherwise be held responsible for the bet not being transmitted to, received by, or otherwise accepted by the Tote. The Operator will not be liable for any loss of winnings that would have been due had the bet been placed in the Host Tote\u2019s pool.\n2.7 If your bet does not reach the Host Tote\u2019s pool the bet amount will be returned to your betting account.\n2.8 The Operator assumes no responsibility for:\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0typing, transmission and\/or evaluation of errors in respect of any bets and shall be entitled (after the event, if necessary) to correct manifest errors relating to odds or the reporting of results and dividends;\n(b) the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of the information services provided (in particular but without limitation, for information provided by third parties).\n\n2.9 The Operator can only accept bet types that are made available by the relevant Host Tote and for which the appropriate betting pool has been opened by an individual Host Tote.\n2.10 All bets need to be confirmed as being accepted into the Host Tote\u2019s pool to be valid.\n2.11 Minimum stake amounts are determined by the Host Tote and will vary by Host Tote and bet type.\n2.12 The Operator reserves the right to impose a maximum stake per bet and a maximum stake amount per race per customer at its own discretion. In line with the Operator\u2019s racing betting rules, the Operator reserves the right not to accept bets at any time without prior notice or explanation.\n2.13 Once the Operator has accepted your offer to bet, you will not be allowed to change the terms of that bet or cancel or withdraw from that bet. Acceptance of an offer by the Operator concludes the bet.\n2.14 International Tote pools close when the 'off' of a race is announced. Any bets placed after the pool has closed will be void.\n\n\n3.1 Bets on horse racing are settled on the official result.\n3.2 Winning dividends are calculated by dividing the total amount of stakes entered into the Host Tote\u2019s pool (less Deductions) by the number of winning units. The percentage Deductions taken from each pool vary depending on the Host Tote and the country where the Host Tote operates.\n3.3 Where no winning dividend is declared settlement will be based on the rules of the relevant Host Tote where the pool is based.\n3.4 All odds and potential dividends advertised by the Operator on the Website before the pool closes are taken from the approximate odds indicator at the relevant Host Tote and, therefore, are for guidance and information purposes only.\n3.5 Settlement will be based on the Dividend declared for the official result by the Host Tote after the weigh-in.\n3.6 In the event that an objection is lodged against the result of a race, any payments on the result of the race shall be made in accordance with the decisions of the race meeting officials or stewards.\n3.7 Pari-mutuel horseracing bets placed through the Operator have a minimum guaranteed Dividend equal to the unit of the wager, for all pari-mutuel bet types.\n3.8 Bets are placed using the official racecard numbers. In the event of dispute relating to the horse name\/number then the number declared by the racecourse will take precedence.\n\n\n4.1 Commingling\nCommingling of pools is the process where one Tote combines its wagering pool with a pre-determined community of betting entities to create one common Dividend. Commingling is commonplace in many horserace betting organisations around the world.\n\n4.2 Coupled Entry\nIn North American races, bets on coupled entries are bets made on an owner or trainer. Should two or more runners either owned by the same owner or trained by the same trainer start in a given race, the odds provided by the Tote shall refer to all runners owned by that owner or trained by that trainer combined. These coupled entries are marked on the website with identical coloured numbers next to the name of the runners. The coupled entries are determined by the Tote and assigned in the offical racing report.\nA bet on one runner of a coupled entry is a bet on all. Runners coupled in betting as a coupled entry shall be considered part of a single betting interest for the purpose of price calculation and distribution of pools. In the event that a runner of a coupled entry is officially withdrawn or scratched, the remaining runners in that coupled entry shall remain valid betting interests and no refunds will be made. Bets shall only be refunded if all runners of a coupled entry are scratched.\nIn order to determine the payout, coupled entries shall be calculated as a single finisher, the best finishing position of the coupled entries shall be used to determine the order of placing. This shall apply to all circums... (truncated)",

If the action is repeated, all accounts will be banned. A member who gains money through extra accounts will be fined for the amount gained through those accounts, including both hearts and biscuits.\n\nEach member (player, user, person) is responsible for their own actions. Should a member conduct themselves in a poor manner or in a manner in which is not compliant with the Terms of Service, he or she will be dealt with accordingly. Members acknowledge that conducting themselves in a way that might be offensive or degrading to others results in these actions and may be fined, warned, or banned from further use of the site.

Should we find out you provided your information, you are held just as liable as the person who is completing the actions unless it is verified you sold or gave away the account.

So if the previous owner had warnings or fines, they may reflect negatively upon the current owner in any future situations, depending on the situation.\n\nThe re-distribution or sharing of illegal content or copyrighted material is not allowed. You are not allowed to plagiarize other individuals by claiming their work is your own whether in coding, writing, artwork, or any other media.

All images posted by a player must be from their own private image host.\n\nTotH is an english-speaking site and members are expected to speak English on our forums. You can use a translator to help you if it is not your native language. All content on TotH will be in English as well. If you do not understand how to use the site it is by no fault of our own. Vulgarities, obscenities, or anything offensive posted in other languages is not permitted.\n\nUse of our site is a privilege and not a right. You are not entitled to anything within the pages.

Purchasing is not a requirement of playing the game. Refunds for any purchase using real life currency are non-refundable. Should you choose to do a chargeback or force a refund, you may be restricted from accessing the website. Purchasing hearts will result in hearts being credited to your account. Purchasing hearts does not remove your responsibilities to adhere to the Terms of Service and players who purchase hearts will not receive special treatment.\n\nUsers are expected to treat other players as they would expect to be treated at all times. This includes the treatment of new members, older members, users of all ages, and staff.\n\nAny images you post, use, or provide on the site (whether for dogs, tags, avatars, or signatures) must belong to you.

They may edit or delete descriptions, images, posts, etc. that may violate the Terms of Service.

Failure to comply with the ToS or a moderator request will result in action being taken against your account.\n\nTotH is not associated with any other online website and is not held responsible for any other sites actions. That said, users who are found to be participating in hate, burn, or attack sites or blogs will be permanently ip banned from further use of our site.

Acronyms to get around filters on any other board will not be tolerated.\n\nImpersonating staff is not tolerated in any form. Users who have been demoted from staff are no longer part of staff and should not be turned to for problems. Users claiming to be staff (moderators, administrators, artists etc) who are not will be fined and possibly banned from further use of the site. This includes the act of mini-modding. Users who are not a part of the staff are not responsible for correcting other users and we expect those users to bring the issue to the attention of a mod rather than handling it themselves.\n\nUsers are prohibited from using excessive caps or bright colors on their forum posts, messages, profile, dog page, kennels, estate, or anywhere else on the site. The use of bright colors is damaging to the eyes and hard for other individuals to read. The use of caps signifies yelling and is rude.\n\nProviding personal information such as full name, address, birthdate, and other information is done so at the users discretion. Tails of the Heart will not be held liable for any repercussions caused by these actions.\n\nIf anything is against the rules on another site you are not permitted to come to HT and break those rules.

        "text":"Team Fortress Wiki:Policies\n\nFrom Team Fortress Wiki\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThis page documents accepted policies and guidelines in use on the Team Fortress Wiki.\n\nTerms of Use\n\nMain article: Team Fortress Wiki:Terms of Use\n\n\nUnreleased content\n\n\"Unreleased content\" here refers to content for which there is some expectation of pending Valve release, but has not been patched into the game and has not been made public in Community servers; examples being content Valve claims to be developing or content mentioned in an ongoing Update ARG. For Community Mod policy, see Mod notability.\n\n  \u2022 Generally, images or articles relating to expected but unreleased weapons, items, or other game content are not permitted until they are officially released. This is because until that point, what the content is, does, or looks like cannot be confirmed.\n  \u2022 The main purpose of this is to reduce unverified speculation or other ridiculous conjecture appearing as 'fact' on article pages.\n  \u2022 You are, however, free to start creating the article in your user space and have it moved back into the article space upon official release. Note: main space categories are generally not permitted on articles in user space.\n\nImages and media\n\nFor image licensing policy, see Team Fortress Wiki:Licensing images.\nFor guidelines on image quality, see Team Fortress Wiki:Images.\nFor placing images in articles, see Help:Images.\n\nLanguages and localization\n\nSee Help:Language translation for help and specific guidelines related to article translation.\n\nThe content on Team Fortress Wiki is multilingual, and every effort should be made to ensure that readers of other languages can access the same content in their own native language.\n\n  \u2022 Articles should have multiple language translations. Content related to the organisation of the project (i.e. pages in the Team Fortress Wiki and Help namespaces) should normally not be translated.\n  \u2022 Many articles are kept translated via translation switching templates. This allows consistent formatting across pages, and ensures that localized text and template code are kept in one single template.\n\nCommunity websites\n\nThe community website pages on this wiki have always been prone to abuse, and as time went on, concerns of bias and the usage of the wiki as a vehicle for product advertising became more pronounced. A lack of guidelines acceptable to all parties has also always been an issue, so as of 2014-05-12 the wiki is enacting a concrete policy of no site pages whatsoever in favor of more helpful and informative basic guides that document the features more generally. This should solve the concerns of advertising and bias, as well as giving a more concrete starting point for newcomers. The new guides are: Basic Market guide, Basic trading guide, and Basic inventory guide.\n\nMod notability\n\nBecause the Team Fortress Wiki is treated as a reliable source of information by players, all new page additions are reviewed by staff to ensure that they meet minimum quality standards. In the case of community content, certain notability requirements also have to be met, in order to maintain this standard of quality. Before creating a new page for a community mod, please ensure that it meets these requirements, and be prepared to show them to staff should the need arise (either via IRC prior to creating the page, or on the talk page for the mod after it has been created). Beware that if a mod is not deemed as notable, it may be summarily removed.\n\n  \u2022 Running on multiple servers: The mod in question must be shown to be in use on multiple servers, run by different entities (meaning that if there are a half-dozen servers being run by one group or person, it doesn't count). These servers also have to show a reasonable amount of player activity, and not simply be empty all the time. If a mod truly is notable in the community, then players will request that server admins run the mod and\/or plugin, and it will see reasonable activity in those servers.\n  \u2022 Discussion among the community: Discussion of the mod must extend beyond the thread announcing its creation and development. It must be shown that the mod is actively discussed by multiple users over multiple communities, in order to illustrate its popularity among players.\n  \u2022 Exposure via YouTube: A very good marker of popularity is if a prominent YouTuber uploads a video of gameplay of the mod, or a popular Twitch streamer plays it (with or without fans\/subscribers is acceptable). Simply showcasing the mod over the course of a few videos and a few personalities is proof enough of trending popularity, it does not have to be multiple videos over a consistent time period.\n\n\nFor basic help with wiki editing, see Help:Editing\nFor tips on style, see Help:Style guide\nFor a complete list of help pages, see Help:Contents\n\n\nUser content\n\n  \u2022 Images\n    Some images are permitted to be uploaded for personal use on user pages. However, users who abuse the right to upload decorative images may have them removed.\n    User images should follow these rules:\n    \u2022 They should have the user's name in the file name (e.g. File:User MyName Steam avatar.png)\n    \u2022 They should be placed in the category User images (place the code [[Category:User images]] into the upload box)\n    \u2022 User images should not be used in articles, or share categories with article images.\n  \u2022 Signatures\n    Custom signatures are allowed. However, we would prefer that more attention is paid to improving articles rather than your own signature. As with user images, misuse of signatures may result in you losing the right to have one.\n  \u2022 Pages\n    User pages should not be placed in any article category.\n\nElevated privileges\n\nSee Help:Group rights.\n\n\n\nSee also:\u00a0Wikipedia:Protection policy\n\nGenerally most pages are not protected to encourage new edits and additions to content. However, some pages and articles are deliberately locked against editing, mostly for the following reasons:\n\n  \u2022 If an edit war breaks out and involved parties refuse to stop;\n  \u2022 If the page is high-risk: this can include templates like {{lang}} that are transcluded heavily, or pages that are heavily trafficked like Main Page.\n    If a template needs protection and translation switching, consider making use of the Dictionary to allow translators to update strings.\n\n\n  \u2022 Users are only blocked from editing if they prove to be consistently disruptive to the wiki. Vandalism, ignoring your talk page, or spam are all good ways to get blocked.",

        "text":"Terms & Conditions\n\n  1. Introduction\n\n    The following Terms and Conditions are valid between you and the Swedish company Star Stable Entertainment AB, reg. no. 556819-8401, (hereinafter referred to as \u201cStar Stable\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d). The Terms and Conditions apply to your installation and use of the game Star Stable Online, which is a multiplayer online role-playing game based in a virtual world. If you have subscribed to become a Star Rider, these Terms and Conditions also apply to your Star Rider membership, which allows you to install and use the full version of the game. The Terms and Conditions also apply to any services provided to you by Star Stable relating to the game, for example the Star Stable website, mobile apps and Star Stable social media accounts (\u201cservices\u201d). The website www.starstable.com will, from now on, be referred to simply as the \u201cwebsite\u201d.\n\n    We kindly advise anyone who is younger than 18 years old, to get a parent or legal guardian to read and accept these terms and conditions on your behalf. It is also important that you get consent from a parent or legal guardian before you register on our website, install or use the game and make any purchases on our website. By accepting these terms and conditions, you confirm that you are 18 years or older, or that you have permission from your parent or legal guardian to install and use the game, and to subscribe for a Star Rider membership, if applicable.\n\n    Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before installing and using the game or subscribing for a Star Rider membership.\n\n    If there is anything that you do not understand, please contact us at http:\/\/www.starstable.com\/en\/support.\n\n    Star Stable reserves the right to revise the Terms and Conditions at any time. The date of the latest update is found in the final section of the Terms and Conditions. Users are responsible for keeping themselves updated with these changes. With the exception of spelling errors, Star Stable will notify players and parents of any changes to the Terms and Conditions.\n\n  2. Register for an account\n\n    To gain access and start playing the game, users are required to create an account by entering their email address, a password and date of birth on the website.\n\n    Here, you agree not to share your username and password (the \u201clogin information\u201d) that you have chosen, or your account details. You also accept sole responsibility for maintaining the confidential login information and for use of your account. If, at any point, you suspect that you have become a victim of a security breach, loss, theft or unauthorized access to this information, please contact our customer support team: http:\/\/www.starstable.com\/en\/support.\n\n  3. Requirements for installing the game software\n\n    Once you have created an Account, you will be able to download and install a game executable file by clicking on the button that says \u201cDownload and play\u201d. In order to play the Game you need to meet the minimum system requirements which can be found here;\n\n  4. The game\n\n    1. Playing the Game free of charge\n\n      Once you have created an account and downloaded the file, the game can be tried free of charge within the specialized area. Beyond the free trial area of the game is an area reserved for fee-paying subscription members (\u201cStar Riders\u201d).\n\n    2. Star Rider Membership\n\n      A Star Rider membership can be purchased on our website after logging in to your Star Stable account. You can either choose between a recurring 1 month or 3 months Star Rider subscription or purchase the 'pay once' Star Rider option that gives you unlimited access to the game for as long as Star Stable is operating.\n\n      For an ongoing subscription, you must choose one of the valid and accepted payment methods that we offer on our website, such as: (1) credit card payment, (2) PayPal, (3) Trustly, or (4) Paysafecard (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d). We will then bill the monthly or quarterly membership fee to your payment method. Please see further details under section 7 below.\n\n    3. Free Trials\n\n      From time to time, we may offer trials of the Star Rider membership for a specified period without payment. Star Stable reserves the right to determine who is eligible for a trial, and to withdraw or to modify a trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability. Free trials are for new members with registered accounts only.\n\n      In some instances, we will require you to provide your payment details before we start the trial. At the end of these trials, we will automatically start charging for the Star Rider membership. This happens on the first day following the end of the trial and continues on a recurring monthly basis. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the trial, you agree to this charge. If you do not wish to continue your Star Rider membership and do not want to be charged at the end of the trial, you will need to change your Star Stable \u201cmy account\u201d settings or contact our customer support before the trial period is up.\n\n      You will receive a reminder from Star Stable that your free trial period is ending between 48 to 72 hours prior to its scheduled end, and that we will start charging you unless you have changed your \u201cmy account\u201d settings or informed customer support that you do not wish to continue your Star Rider membership before the end of the trial period. You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun. Log in to your \u201cmy account\u201d page on the Star Stable website to find cancellation instructions. We will continue to charge your payment method on a monthly basis for your membership fee until you cancel.\n\n  5. Commencement of membership agreement and no Right of withdrawal\n\n    Your agreement with Star Stable regarding your Star Rider membership, which provides you with access to the full version of the game (and any services, if applicable), is concluded upon your first payment and Star Stable\u2019s confirmation notice to you. You hereby agree that the full version of the game (and any services, if applicable) will be immediately available to you for download and use upon such payment and confirmation notice, and you hereby waive your right to withdrawal under the Distance and Off-Premises Contracts Act (SFS 2005:59). Please note that this does not affect your right to cancel your membership in accordance with section 8 below.\n\n  6. Prices\n\n    Prices for Star Rider membership may vary by nation and\/or currency. The prices applicable to your membership appear on the website applicable to your country of residence. The prices shown on the website include VAT.\n\n    We reserve the right to adjust the subscription fee for the game or any components related to the game, in any manner, and at any time we may determine, at our own discretion. Star Stable shall, however, notify you by email of any price changes at least one month in advance. Please note that you are entitled to cancel your subscription at any time, in accordance with section 8 in these Terms and Conditions. Price changes will not apply to your current subscription period that you have already paid.\n\n    Please note that additional charges may be applicable depending on the payment method you choose. Please see further details regarding any additional charges related to your payment method.\n\n  7. Payments\n\n    1. Payments for Ongoing Star Rider Membership\n\n      By starting your Star Rider membership and designating a preferred payment method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly or quarterly membership fee at the then current rate.\n\n      The Star Rider membership fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each subsequent month or quarter thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. We will automatically bill you via the payment method you have chosen on the calendar day that your paid membership starts. In the event that your paid membership began on a day not contained in any given month, we may bill your payment method on another day in the month or another day we deem appropriate. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31, your next payment date is likely to be February 28, so your payment method would be billed on that date.\n\n      Membership fees are fully earned upon receipt of payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your payment attempt was not successful. As long as a valid subscription is still active, we also reserve the right to retry payment authorization. This may affect your renewal date due to changes in your Star Rider membership. Visit our website and login to the \u201cmy account\u201d page to see the next billing date for your particular renewal period. We may authorize your payment method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges. As used in these Terms and Conditions, \u201cbilling\u201d indicates a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your payment method.\n\n    2. No refunds\n\n      Payments are non-refundable and there are no credits or refunds given for partially used periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the game through to the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (\u201ccredits\u201d). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The receipt of credits in one instance does not entitle the user to credits in the future for similar occurrences, nor does it oblige us to provide credits under any other circumstances in the future.\n\n  8. Your cancellation for your star rider membership\n\n    You may cancel your Star Rider membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the game through to the end of your monthl...

The Casino is a member of the group of online Casinos proprietary to us (the \"Group\"). At any point in time the Group may offer Sign-Up Bonuses at any or all of its member Casinos.\n  2. All new players have 7 days from the date their account was opened to claim their new player sign-up bonus. Thereafter the Sign-Up bonus will be unavailable. Subsequent promotions will be available to the player but the Sign-Up bonus will be considered forfeited.\n  3. Please note that for the purposes hereof, a \u201cCurrency Unit\u201d is a unit of the currency nominated by the Player at the time of his\/her registration of his\/her Real Account to be the currency to be utilized by such Player when transacting with the Casino.\n  4. \u00a0For these promotions \u2018Desktop\u2019 refers to an application that runs stand alone in a desktop or laptop computer.\n  5. Contrast with \"software,\" which requires the Web browser to run and \u2018mobile\u2019 applications that run on HTML5 on smartphones and tablets.\n  6. The Welcome Bonus will automatically be credited to the Bonus Account upon a successful purchase of 10 currency units or more.\n  7. Where the Casino does not offer the primary Currency Unit in your country, you will be eligible to play and receive bonuses in any currency of your choosing.\n  8. If you open multiple accounts you will not be eligible for the Sign-Up Bonus on each account. This and any other Sign-Up Bonus\/es are only available once per Player and\/or per environment where computers are shared and\/or per email address. This offer is not transferable.\n  9. Once you have received a Sign-Up Bonus at any of the Group's member Casinos, you are required that to meet additional minimum Play Through Requirements before you are eligible for additional Sign-Up Bonuses at any of the other member Casinos.\n  10. If a Free Spins Offer is granted to you it must be played through 50 times (50x) before you will be able to withdraw any winnings made using the bonus money portion of your balance. (\"Play through Requirement\"). For example, if you deposit 100 and receive a 100 credit bonus, the Play through Requirement will be 50 x 100 = 5000. Any winnings attributed to the Cash portion of your balance can be withdrawn at any time, subject to meeting all of these terms and conditions. In the event that a Player has a positive cash balance after the 50x wagering requirement is complete and such Player attempts to make a withdrawal, the withdrawal of winnings derived from the Free Spins will be capped at 100 Casino Credits (in the Player\u2019s currency of play) and the remaining cash balance will be forfeited.\n  11. \u00a0The Bonus amount is subject to a minimum play through (wager) of 50 times (50x) by you before it can be transferred from your Bonus Balance to your Cash Balance (\"Play Through Requirement\").
