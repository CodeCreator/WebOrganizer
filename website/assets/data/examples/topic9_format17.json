What can I do?\n\n\n-Lou Longshot\n\nDear Lou,\u00a0\n\nThere are different types of liens that can be placed on a property. The Internal Revenue Service can place a tax lien on the property. Unpaid property taxes can also generate a lien on your property. Also, a contractor can place a mechanic's lien on it to ensure payment for work performed on the property. A judgment lien is created by a court ruling that gave a creditor the right to place a lien on your property for an unpaid debt. Even homeowners associations have been known to place a lien on a property for unpaid association fees.\n\nCompare Mortgage Rates in Your Area\n\nTo remove the lien, you need to settle the lien holder's claim on the property. They will then release the lean. How big a hassle this process is depends on the type of lien and the lien holder. Whether you need to work with an attorney to accomplish the release depends on the type of lien and your willingness and ability to satisfy the lien holder's claim on your property. Most mechanics liens and judgment liens won't result in foreclosure. But some liens, like those for unpaid property taxes, can trigger foreclosure.\n\nYou didn't mention whether the lien was part of a bankruptcy process. Bankrate's bankruptcy adviser Justin Harelik has written about getting liens released post-bankruptcy on debts that were discharged in bankruptcy. Also, Bankrate's tax adviser Judy O'Connor has written about the IRS treatment of tax liens.\n\nGet more news, money-saving tips and expert advice by signing up for a free Bankrate newsletter.\n\n\nAsk the adviser\n\nTo ask a question of Dr. Don, go to the \"Ask the Experts\" page and select one of these topics: \"Financing a home,\" \"Saving and Investing\" or \"Money.\" Read more Dr. Don columns for additional personal finance advice.\n\nBankrate's content, including the guidance of its advice-and-expert columns and this website, is intended only to assist you with financial decisions.

        "text":"Date and value of ICO transactions in tax report\n\n\nlast year I participated in an ICO, where I spent 500 USDC on April 13 and received the tokens on May 31. I imported the transactions and classified them as ICO, and when I log into Accointing it shows up correctly with an acquisition date of April 13.\n\nIn my tax report, the acquisition date is shown as May 31, and the acquisition price is based on that date as well.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n  \u2022 Shouldn\u2019t somehow the 500 USDC be used as a basis for the acquisition price? The price on the market both on April 13 as well as May 31 was a lot higher than what I paid through the ICO. In your taxation of transactions explanation it only says that the \u201cbuy information\u201d is relevant, but it is not specified whether that means the value of tokens used for the purchase, or value of the purchased tokens at time of receiving them (\n  \u2022 Why does the tax report not also correctly show April 13 as the acquisition date as well? Based on what I had read I thought this was the correct way.\n\nI hope my questions are clear. I would be very thankful for a response!\n\nEdit: It seems to have been a bug, because I unclassified and reclassified the transaction just a few minutes ago, and now the cost basis has changed and is close to the euro value of the 500 USDC I paid. The question of the date still remains :slight_smile:\n\nThank you very much, seems that your issue is resolved now?\n\nI will keep this is mind and see if any other user has this error :slight_smile:\n\nThe date in the tax report is still not correct, as it shows May 31 as purchase date instead of April 13.\n\nAs it is shown correctly online in the wallet I expect it to somehow be an issue of the report and not a general one. Luckily in this case it is not relevant for me personally, as I realised the gains before the 1 year holding period either way.\n\nWould you be willing to send us your data so that we can take a deeper look into this? If so, Submit a request here :slight_smile:\n\nIn the form please also leave a link to this post so that we have background context :slight_smile:\nThe reason we ask for your data is that we do not see your data, whatever you put in your Accointing account, is encrypted.\n\nThis topic was automatically closed after 18 days.

        "text":"Question: Which One Is Better Mclr Or RLLR?\n\nWhat is the current Mclr rate of SBI?\n\n6.65% to 7.30%Current MCLR rate of SBI ranges from 6.65% to 7.30% varying by reset frequency of the loan.\n\nSBI revises MCLR rates on a monthly basis and benchmark its interest rates for home loan and other loans to MCLR rates of different tenor..\n\nWhat is the purpose of Mclr announced by RBI?\n\nWhat is\/are the purpose\/purposes of the \u2018Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR)\u2019 announced by RBI? 1. These guidelines help to improve the transparency in the methodology followed by banks for determining the interest rates on advances.\n\nWhat is current Rplr of HDFC?\n\n16.20%Current PLR rate of HDFC is 16.20%, which the bank fixes periodically based on its internal cost of funds and the current interest rates in the economy. HDFC benchmarks its interest rates for home loan and other loans to PLR rates.\n\nWhy Mclr is different for different banks?\n\nDifference Between MCLR And Base Rate MCLR depends on factors like CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio), marginal cost of funds, tenor premium, and operating cost. It is dependent on the repo rate changes made by the RBI. Marginal cost of funds based lending rate can be different for different loan tenures.\n\nIs Mclr rate same for all banks?\n\nAll the banks required to review and publish their MCLR of different maturity every month on a pre-fixed date. The final lending rates should be based on by adding the spread to the MCLR. \u2026 Personal loans, auto loans, and fixed rate home loans, etc., will not be linked to MCLR.\n\nWho decides Mclr rate?\n\nThe marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) is the minimum interest rate that a bank can lend at. MCLR is a tenor-linked internal benchmark, which means the rate is determined internally by the bank depending on the period left for the repayment of a loan.\n\nHow base rate is calculated?\n\nBase rate calculation is done by taking a lot of factors into consideration. These include the cost of deposits, the administrative costs borne by the bank, the profitability of the bank in the previous financial year and the unallocated overhead costs among other things.\n\nShould I switch from Mclr to repo rate?\n\nBorrowers having MCLR or BLR linked loans, are likely to get the entire benefit of this repo rate cut in next 12 to 18 months as the repo rate reduction will take time to reflect in the bank\u2019s cost of funds, on which MCLR is based. Hence, it makes sense to switch your MCLR-, BLR-linked loans to repo-linked loans.\n\nWhat is RLLR rate?\n\nThe lending interest rate linked to repo rate is known as Repo Rate Linked Lending Rate (RLLR). RLLR is made up of RBI\u2019s repo rate plus spread or margin. RLLR = Repo rate + Margin charged by the bank. The Central Bank reviews the repo rate in every two months.\n\nIs Mclr same for all banks?\n\nMCLR, full form Marginal Cost of Fund based Lending Rate is the internal benchmark rate used by banks to fix the interest rate on floating rate loans. Starting from 1st April 2016, all banks in India are required to benchmark and price their loans to MCLR.\n\nHow Mclr will be calculated?\n\nMCLR is calculated based on the loan tenor, i.e., the amount of time a borrower has to repay the loan. \u2026 The bank determines the actual lending rates by adding the elements spread to this tool. The banks, then, publish their MCLR after careful inspection.",
