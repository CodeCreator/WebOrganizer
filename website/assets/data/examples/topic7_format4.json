        "text":"\n\n4yr old dd will only poo in nappies\n\n(52 Posts)\nmystified76 Mon 07-Jan-08 10:28:47\n\nMy dd1 is 4 in january, she has been dry in the day for a year, but still refuses to do a poo on the toilet.\nShe doesn't have any accidents at all in her pants, she can hold onto a poo for up to a week (i think 8 days is her record) and will then ask for a nappy and do an absolute huge poo. She totally refuses to go on the toilet for a poo but is fine for wees.\nWe have tried every bribe you can think of...chocolate, sticker charts etc etc... the latest bribe is a trip to euro disney but even that isn't working! Any ideas? i have said to dh,mil etc for ages that it will resolve itself in time but keep getting comments and now even my mum who is usually sooo supportive has made remarks sad\nWhat should i do next?\n\ncurlywurlywee Mon 04-Feb-08 10:53:11\n\nMy dd, now aged 5, had terrible constipation problems for about 2 years between age 2 and 4. She also would not poo on the loo but in her pull-ups. She was actually withholding her poo because she was frightened of letting it go in the toilet or potty.\n\nWe took her to see a Consultant who suggested that we encourage her to go on the toilet by making it fun??? We bought one of those TV dinner fold up wooden tables and put it in the loo, together with a stool that was high enough to support her legs. We then put her cars on the table and she sat there and played for sometimes up to half an hour. We never pressurised her to sit there but she was pleased to do it because of the novelty value of sitting on the loo and playing. By the way, we also put a soft seat on for her because she complained that her legs hurt. This worked a treat.\n\nBribery worked aswell. If she saw something in a shop that she really wanted, we told her we would buy it for her but she couldn't have it until she pooed on the loo. This sounds a bit harsh but the draw of the toy actually in the house was too much for her and she pooed on the loo for the first time. This worked the very first time we tried it.\n\nWe also bought a book from Amazon called \"constipation, withholding and your child\" or something like that and it had a story in it about Mr Poo coming out to play with Little Miss Wee in the toilet. This seemed to work really well too.\n\nI think the main thing is not to punish them for not sitting on the loo, but gentle encouragement and reward. After a while, the rewards bit died off and she just went to the toilet normally. Hope this helps.\n\nkatie5004 Mon 04-Feb-08 13:47:07\n\nGlad i am not alone,im getting so frustrated tho.Trying not to get mad at him when he poos in his pants but cant help him sometimes coz he knows he is doing it.Its making me not want to leave the house coz it can be three times a day and very embarrasing.Iv tried everthing,realy dont want this to go on much longer\n\ncurlywurlywee Mon 04-Feb-08 13:58:06\n\nKatie, it's really horrible living with a constipated child. I used to get angry sometimes - we are only human after all. How old is your lo? There is light at the end of the tunnel but I know this doesn't mean much to you at the moment. I remember that feeling of being trapped in the house because I couldn't cope with another embarrassing 'poo incident'.\n\nhifi Mon 04-Feb-08 14:36:11\n\ntook dd to paediatrician last week for something unrelated to poo, she asked to poo while we were in his office, she will only do it in a nappy. he got very angry with me for still letting her do it, shes 3.5. he has advised me to always make sure she does it in the bathroom,then eventually hold the nappy over the loo for her to do it on then take the nappy away.\n\ni did mention we knew older children who still pooed in nappys and he said as soon as they are dry they should be pooing in the toilet, i got a rught telling off \"shes running rings around you\".\n\namazonianwoman Mon 04-Feb-08 14:40:37\n\nHe sounds a bit harsh - I've tried EVERYTHING with DD for over a year. She'd just hold it in for ages if I don't give her a nappy, which becomes a vicious circle cos then it hurts when she eventually poos hmm\n\namazonianwoman Mon 04-Feb-08 14:40:39\n\nHe sounds a bit harsh - I've tried EVERYTHING with DD for over a year. She'd just hold it in for ages if I don't give her a nappy, which becomes a vicious circle cos then it hurts when she eventually poos hmm\n\namazonianwoman Mon 04-Feb-08 14:41:00\n\noops blush\n\nkatie5004 Mon 04-Feb-08 14:48:34\n\ncurlywurlywee- he is almost3.I dont want this to go on for years cant handle it,already had3 pooey pants today. I am under so much pressure to get him potty trained.just dont understand why he is doing this when he can wee on the toilet fine.sad\n\ncurlywurlywee Mon 04-Feb-08 19:31:49\n\nKatie, these problems around pooing on the toilet are very common and I promise you, it will sort itself out in time. Maybe you could try some of the stuff that I've posted above - it sorted out the problem for us although dd was a little bit older. I totally understand how you feel - for two years our lives centred around the pooing thing. I've just reread your thread above and am I right in saying that your ds is not actually constipated, just refusing to poo on the loo?\n\nTry making the toilet a fun place to be and make a big fuss if he poos on the loo - buy him something aswell. Bribery really worked for us.\n\nIt's a form of control that they can exercise over us mothers. They know it drives us crazy and that's part of the reason why they do it. Also, they can have a genuine fear of 'letting go' of their poo and so they withhold and only poo in a safe environment, ie the nappy\/pull-up.\n\nI promise you it will sort in time but I know that's not much help to you at the mo.\n\nThinking of you.\n\nabigaillockhart Mon 04-Feb-08 19:43:56\n\nLike you, I thought DS would NEVER manage to poo on the loo. I was upset as he was getting upset..\n\nThe main thing that worked for us was the 'big boy' card. I was annoyed about the poo thing one day when he happened to ask for a big boy bike - I very casually told him that you weren't allowed one until you did poos on the loo. I never brought it up with him but he mentioned it a couple of times. From then on we did a real 'oh it really doesn't matter' approach to the nappies but he never forgot about the bike. About two weeks later we had success.\n\n(A very young bloke served us in the bike shop and REALLY didn't understand why DS kept telling him that he poos in the loo!!)\n\nVery similar approach worked with getting him out of nappies at night. (Aged 3.4 - soon after the poo debarcle)\n\nkatie5004 Tue 05-Feb-08 10:28:48\n\nthanks! just bought him a toy which i know he will realy like,he knows where it is and what he has to do to get it.realy hope this will work.\n\nBettySpaghetti Tue 05-Feb-08 10:40:31\n\nFirst of all sorry I haven't read whole thread as I'm just on my way out the door but wanted to pass this on.\n\nA good friend's little boy (age 4) was like you described in your OP.\n\nFriend was beside herself as she tried all sorts. I did a search here on MN for tips and came across recommendations for this book. Its a funny childrens story that involves poo. I think it just helps in that it makes poo seem funny\/normal\/nothing to be scared of.\n\nI bought the book for my friends DS and he absolutely loved it. My friend swears blind that it was the start of his getting over his problem.\n\ncurlywurlywee Tue 05-Feb-08 13:02:02\n\nBetty, that book looks great. We bought one for our dd called \"Everyone Poops\" by Taro Gomi - got if off Amazon. She loved it and it made her realise that everyone and every animal eats and so has to poo. She found it very entertaining looking at all the different shapes of poo!!\n\nBetty, on a different note, how do you link a website page to your thread? I can't figure out how to do it.\n\nBettySpaghetti Tue 05-Feb-08 18:24:49\n\ncurlywurlywee -if you have a look at the bottom of this page (next to the box you type your message in) it explains how to do links under the smileys and emoticons.\n\nMaenad Tue 05-Feb-08 18:40:21\n\nI don't know if this is helpful or not, but my friend's little boy had a similar issue. She cracked it very gradually by having him sit on the potty in his nappy to do a poo, then when he was happy with that he would sit on an open nappy on the potty, and finally he would just poo in the potty. It seemed like a sensible approach I thought.\n\namazonianwoman Wed 06-Feb-08 14:12:53\n\n\nDD just did a poo on the potty rather than in a nappy, over a year after potty training grin smile grin\n\nAll it took in the end was the promise of a Stephanie (Lazytown) costume hmm Her friend was wearing one yesterday (present for giving up dummy) and I told her she could have one too if she did a poo on potty\/toilet. Came into the living room after lunch to find her sitting on potty, saying she was pooing for Stephanie hmm grin\n\nmystified76 Wed 13-Feb-08 15:43:39\n\nHi everyone\nsorry i havn't returned to this thread for ages.\nLast few weeks have been a nightmare - just got dd to the doing poo in nappy but in the bathroon stage, was edging her towards the idea of doing poo in nappy but on the toilet stage when WHAM! she gets poxy chicken pox! Not only did she not have a poo for a whopping 10 days, she also had nasty spots down there so we actually reverted to letting her do wees in her nappy because she was crying in agony when doing wees on the loo! Maybe she is a master of manipulation but i couldn't bare to see her suffer!!!!\nBack to normal now as in doing wees on loo and poos in nappy but in bathroom!! I'm glad so many more people have joined this thread it has made me fell better to know i'm not alone. smile\n\nmystified76 Wed 13-Feb-08 15:44:40\n\nfeel better!\n\ncallan Sun 24-Feb-08 18:06:17\n\nMy 3.5 yr old son has been toilet trained for 6 mths for wees but still poos in a pull up. Full time school starts in 6 wks and he simply MUST be able to poo in the toilet! He is so scared of pooing in the toilet and I don't know why. We've had crying and hysteria when he's been pleading and b... (truncated)",

        "text":"Saturday, August 12, 2006\n\n\nThe last few days of the last three years have brought home to me one of the big problems in grandparenting identical futago (twins; literally \u201ctwo-child\u201d), which is that you can't tell them apart without using a magic marker or something, and the older and more experienced and more familiar they get with this inadequacy of yours, the more they take advantage of it.\n\nThis is a problem because in order to assert full command with crafty toddlers you have to act fast, use names fast and accurately. Saying \"Miasa, stop that!\" to Mitsuki is not commanding at all, in fact it is downright wimpy and comical, and Mitsuki knows it. Or is that really Miasa.\n\nNeedless to say, both take advantage of it, whichever either one is, as is always the case in an intensely evolutionary situation such as grandparenting. So the way it goes is, you're wrong half the time with one twin and half the time with the other, which in Twin Mathematics, a special field I'm developing, adds up to 100%.\n\nFor example, I see Kaya and one twin downstairs and suddenly water starts dripping from the ceiling. I have to act fast, they don't carry IDs, I have to take a shot. Mitsuki! Stop pouring water on the floor! Mitsuki looks at me out of the corner of one eye and grins knowingly as she continues letting the air out of something I just put air into. I run upstairs to snatch the water bottle from the one who is in fact Miasa, at least for now, and with the delay has succeeded in getting all the water out. She is wearing the same subtle, non-provoking grin as her sister.\n\nYoung as they are (an ominous three this month) they know their world and its inhabitants. They could never pull this stuff on their mother, who can tell them apart faster than they can misbehave. So they enjoy being around me. I enjoy being around them too, but not for the same reason. Every time I finally figure out which is which without depending merely on who's wearing what - which is only good for a day anyway - they head back home up north, and when next I see them they're a few months older and have morphed to a confusing extent into each other's physiognomies. If I didn't know better, I'd say they planned it.\n\nTheir names have changed as well: \"No, this is Mitsuki. That's Miasa.\" Or vice-versa. I've thought maybe of different sounding bells or something while they're here, because crucial time is lost when you say \"Mitsuki, don't write on the window\" and Miasa doesn't even react, apart from the twitch about the lips indicating that you've named the grinning twin who's trying the scissors on something over there, and you know you've lost again.\n\nYet won at the same time, somehow.\n\n\nJoy Des Jardins said...\n\nI'm laughing! As a mother of identical twin girls, who was the only one who could tell them apart for a long time, I'm laughing....and I'm sorry Robert. Try as you may, they will confuse you with every adorable grin...AND it STILL could get worse. But, OH the fun they are. I WILL figure out who's who....eventually; because THEY'RE going to want YOU to know.\n\nRobert Brady said...\n\nThanks, joy; you give me hope.\n\nMaya's Granny said...\n\nI've said it before, I'll say it again. Anyone who raises twins has my admiration.\n\nMaya has twin aunts, Maya and Melissa. They aren't even identical, but when Julie would go to visit her father and I would call, I couldn't tell which one had answered the phone. Not just, was it Maya or Melissa, but was it MY child!\n\nPam said...\n\nIs there any chance you can call them both \"Mi-chan\" and get away with it?\n(Oh duh! I just now figured out what their names probably look like in Japanese. Is the \"Mi\" ?? I'm all set with the \"asa\" and \"tsuki\". That's cool!)\n\nTabor said...\n\nHave you tried temporary tattoos? Kids love those. You could put one on the right hand of one twin and the other on the left hand.\n\nMary Lou said...\n\nIt is a terrorist plot to drive grandfathers insane. Although lovingly! and of course Kaya wont help out either will she, being part of the conspiracy...She has told them already how easy you are to wrap around their little fingers! ;)",

        "text":"Thursday, June 11, 2009\n\nThankful Thursday\n\nOne of our early day trips last summer was to visit The Habitat for Humanity Global Community in Americus, Georgia.\n\nIt was an eye opener to walk through the village from the lean-to and shacks to the homes that can be available through the Habitat for Humanity Program.\n\nAfter walking through an area with at least 20 dwellings like those above, with the meager personal items people would own in homes such as these, we ventured into what is possible.\n\nAll the homes were still quite modest and humbling as we returned to our home with plenty of space.\nComing across these photos made me thankful again.\nThankful . . .\n- that this village is there so others can be reminded of needs of others.\n- for my home, my yard.\n- for walls, real walls. Real doors and real windows.\n- air conditioning and heating\n- flooring under my bare feet\n- running water\n- electricity\n- food. healthy food\n- appliances\n- even the pang of quilt for having so many possessions\n- an easy life\n- for TODAY!\n\n\nJan the crazy lady said...\n\nWe have so much to be grateful for. Glad you had the chance to really grasp those blessings.\n\nGayle said...\n\nWe do take so many things for granted. Thank you for the reminder.\n\nSniffles and Smiles said...\n\nSo, so much to be thankful for!!!! This is a beautiful post! Thank YOU!! ~Janine XO\n\nThe Muse said...\n\nOur blessings are often overlooked...thank you for bringing them to light...!\n\nFancyHorse said...\n\nIt's good to see what HfH is doing in other parts of the world.\n\niranutax: IRA new tax\n\nJane In The Jungle said...\n\n\nJules~ said...\n\nIt makes me sigh.....and that sigh is mixed with so many feelings.\nWe are blessed with so much and we still find things to complain about. (I mean we as in me in general.)\nThat was something I have noticed with all of Pippin's stories and pictures of Uganda. There is so little and yet they have a joy and sincerity that I have to think about looking for in myself.\nThank you for the reminder.\nBlessings to you today.",

        "text":"Friday, April 21, 2006\n\nthe millennials & the fourth turning\n\nTonight I heard a breathless paraphrase of the future as prophesized by William Strauss and Neil Howe, authors of The Fourth Turning and Millennials Rising, and it didn't quite add up to me. Especially the stuff about the Millennials, the generation born in 1980s and 1990s. The argument is that this is a generation that was highly nurtured in their childhood, and that they'll grow up and save the world.\n\nYet it was during the late 80s and early 90s when the crack epidemic decimated black communities, and nurturing was in short supply for the children who suffered through it. It's also spans the era when school desgregation failed and blacks and white children became even more isolated from one another than they had been before Brown v. Board.\n\nIt's funny how we whites think the world begins and ends with us.\n\n\ntrAcy said...\n\ntho, often when i encounter a child whose license says they are 16 to 26 or so years old, and that child is white, they don't seem at all like people who would save anything but their playstation\/cellphone\/etc., suped-up wanna-be-racer hondas and themselves.\n\ni am curious about that book you're citing. . .as when i hear \"very nurtured,\" i think \"spoiled (suburban) rotten.\" (see above.)\n\nevery day a friend of mine who fought in world war 2 and is now driving a school bus in the inner city (where he lives) for extra cash for a film project calls to update me on \"this generation.\"\n\nhe blames their disrespect on the Dr. (Benjamin) Spock childrearing theory that was popular when you and i were kids. . but it came out in 1946. i guess the \"blamed\" part is how spock discounted discipline in lieu of children's expressing themselves.\n\nkids \"these days\" don't respect authority, no. not even when it's warranted, but like you said, it's something you have to grow up with to understand.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nThe Millenials will save mankind. Interesting. That flies in the face of all sorts of anecdotal evidence that suggest our \"highly nurtured\" saviors are little more than unimaginative, overly sheltered, self-absorbed and horribly spoiled.\n\nEmployers are finding Millenials are unwilling and unable to take initiative, and they think they deserve praise for completing the most mundane tasks. A few months ago, the NY Times reported on students e-mailing college professors for classes. Much of the article focused on how the tone of these e-mails ranged from rude and demanding to outright helplessness. One student wanted to know what type of notebook was best for taking notes.\n\nThese kids are going to save us? God help us all.\n\njoe said...\n\nInteresting input. I must confess, I haven't been following the story. I just pick up little pieces here and there. I recall first hearing about it on a news show, and now that you mention it, I recall that a few frustrated employers were quoted. It's just funny to hear from my perspective, because most of the young folks in that age range who I know are black and poor and urban and their experiences don't correspond in any way with what the media has been hyping.",
