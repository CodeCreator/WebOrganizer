        "text":"Vonnegut\u2019s Slaughterhouse-Five, set for graphic novel translation in\u00a02020\n\nPublisher BOOM! Studios recently announced a brand new graphic novel adaptation for Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s American classic novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. The acclaimed anti-war novel interpretation will be full color, and set for September 2020, under its Archaia imprint.\n\nThis work will be a first in graphic novel for the work, and done by Eisner Award-winning writer Ryan North (How to Invent Everything: A Survival Guide for the Stranded Time Traveler) and Eisner Award-nominated artist Albert Monteys (Universe!) with color assistance by Ricard Zaplana, available.\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five, also known as The Children\u2019s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death was first published in 1969, and written by Kurt Vonnegut. The book follows the life of war vet Billy Pilgrim, from his early years to his time as an American soldier and chaplain\u2019s assistant during World War II, to his later years. There is some abstract science fiction involved as Billy time travels throughout. Much of the story focuses on his capture by the German Army and his survival of the Allied firebombing of Dresden as a prisoner-of-war. This reflects a personal experience by the author, having lived through that.\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five would eventually receive worldwide attention, and very timely in a time of rising anti-war protests. It would be nominated for multiple awards, and adapted into multiple other entertainment formats, including film, theater, and a radio play. It would also end up challenged for censorship, and banned in places for its adult and \u201canti-Christian\u201d content.\n\nRyan North is known for much current work, including Dinosaur Comics, the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning Adventure Time comic series, the bestselling anthology series Machine of Death and best-selling Eisner-Award winning Unbeatable Squirrel Girl comics published by Marvel. His latest book, How to Invent Everything, A Survival Guide for the Stranded Time Traveler is a humorous look at civilization, and worth checking out.\n\n\u201cLike most people, Kurt Vonnegut has been one of my favourite writers since I first read his books decades ago, and it\u2019s been such an honour\u2014and challenge\u2014to adapt his most famous work for a new medium. Slaughterhouse-Five is a deeply funny and deeply moving book, and my goal with this project was to keep all of that, while still making something that feels at home in this medium,\u201d said writer Ryan North. \u201cI picture it as a window into an alternate universe where Kurt (and Kilgore Trout) worked in comics instead of prose. Every medium can do things that others can\u2019t, I\u2019m beyond excited to share this new version of Slaughterhouse-Five with you very soon.\u201d\n\nAlbert Monteys is a Spanish graphic novelist and illustrator, best known for his work in El Jueves, a weekly satirical magazine that he directed from 2006 until 2011. Monteys also created the series Carlitos Fax for the children\u2019s magazine Mister K. In 2014, he founded a satirical monthly publication Orgullo y Satisfaccion (Pride and Satisfaction) with several other cartoonists, and began to publish a science fiction comic, \u00a1Universo! (Universe!) in Panel Syndicate, winning a 2017 Eisner Award nomination for Best Digital Comic.\n\n\u201cWhat a challenge, what an opportunity! When I was presented with the chance to collaborate in the graphic novel adaptation of Slaughterhouse-Five my first reaction was \u2018this is one of my favorite books and it can\u2019t be adapted.\u2019 That was until I read Ryan North\u2019s script, nodding enthusiastically at every great idea, every moving moment, every scene that made me want to grab my pencil right away.\u201d said artist Albert Monteys in a recent press release from BOOM! \u201cA good adaptation shines new light on the original, I hope we managed to do just that. I think we did, somewhat, in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore\u2014which is what comics are, after all.\u201d\n\nSlaughterhouse- Five will be available in print form, for sale in September 2020 at local comic book shops, and direct from Boom Studios webstore. Digital copies can be purchased from popular content providers, including comiXology, iBooks, Google Play, and Madefire.\n\nIn the meantime, here is 7-page preview, courtesy of BOOM Studios for its graphic novel release\u2026\n\nAbout StrangerWorlds Team (367 Articles)\nHopping across worlds, dedicated in seeking interesting creative science fiction and fantasy arts in all forms, reporting back at StrangerWorlds.com.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

He said: \"We did cut back our non-fiction radically over the last five years-then we were doing 20-odd titles a year, and now that is down to about six to eight titles a year.\n\n\"We are now beginning to feel that is too few and we want to do more and particularly more with international sales potential, both in rights and copies, but particularly copies as we have such a strong network of publishers, and some markets are growing, rather than the UK market.\"",

Among its maybe-they're-true, maybethey're-not tales is an account of the married Hemingway's nuptials to an 18-year-old African woman.\n\nPatrick Hemingway, who was with his father and stepmother on the safari, has said he does not believe Hemingway was involved with the woman, but cautioned that he might not have been privy to such knowledge.\n\n\"There's always going to be that lingering element of ambiguity, and I think Hemingway would have absolutely adored the joke,\" Scribner laughed. \"Hemingway loved tall stories. Who knows?\"\n\nScribner said it would be unfair to compare the incomplete, posthumously edited work to Hemingway greats like \"A Farewell to Arms\" or \"The Sun Also Rises.\"\n\nPatrick Hemingway pared the 850-page \"True at First Light\" manuscript by about half, and took the title from a line in the text. Scribner said the editor tried to stay as close as possible to his Nobel Prize-winning father's original intentions.\n\n\"In Africa a thing is true at first light and a lie by noon and you have no more respect for it than for the lovely, perfect weed-fringed lake you see across the sun-baked salt plain,\" one passage reads.\n\nScribner praised the \"fictional memoir\" as a \"rich, multifaceted work.\"\n\n\"This has the romance of Africa, ... (it) brings in reminiscences of Paris, of other writers, of relationships between husband and wife, of religion, of western civilization juxtaposed with African tribalism.\"\n\nSusan Beegel, editor of the semi-annual scholarly journal the Hemingway Review, said even the unedited version was far more readable than \"The Garden of Eden\" and \"Islands in the Stream,\" two Hemingway novels published since the author's 1961 suicide.\n\n\"It's much closer to a finished product,\" she said. \"It should be a much cleaner, easier read and ... less confusing for people.\"\n\nHemingway began work on the manuscript in 1954, when he returned from Africa to his home in Cuba. He put it aside two years later when he was interrupted by the filming of \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" Beegel said.\n\nPoor health and the demands of celebrity kept him from completing the work before he killed himself in July 1961.\n\nHemingway's widow, Mary, went to Havana to retrieve the papers later that year, after President Kennedy helped her get permission for the trip. In return for Kennedy's assistance, Mrs. Hemingway deeded her late husband's papers to the John F. Kennedy Library in the 1970s, said Stephen Plotkin, the collection's curator.\n\nThe family kept the manuscript sealed because they planned to publish it someday. Some scholars read another copy that had been deposited at Princeton University, but that was eventually closed too.\n\n\n\u00a9 2017. All Rights Reserved.\u00a0\u00a0| Contact Us",

        "text":"\nSave As PDF Print this page\n\nReading the World: What on Earth is Love?\n\nEileen Chang\n\nThe 29th edition of the Hong Kong Book Fair, which opens next Wednesday, celebrates not only a love of books, but also romantic literature\u00a0\u2013 with the tag line \u201cReading the World: What on Earth is Love?\u2019\n\nHong Kong\u2019s own history of romance literature will be on display during the fair with a special exhibition titled \u201cLove between the lines\u201d. Rare collections, including out-of-print novels and manuscripts, from 10 Hong Kong romance writers will be showcased at the fair\u2019s Art Gallery. A series of seminars will complement the exhibition, including an event featuring Roland Soong, the estate executor for renowned novelist Eileen Chang (photo above), and literary critic Tom Fung who will discuss the author\u2019s works.\n\nAnother event on romance literature focuses on Baroque-era love poetry and prose from the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n\u201cLove and romance are universal topics,\u201d said Diana Coronado, a Hong Kong-based Mexican author who is helping to organise the event. \u201cLove, the Spanish knew well, was not always sweetness and light. The \u2018Siglo de Oro\u2019, or the Century of Gold, gave the world not just Don Quixote but also Don Juan.\u201d\u00a0 The Century of Gold refers to the period of Spanish\u00a0literature\u00a0extending from the early 16th\u00a0century\u00a0to the late 17th\u00a0century, generally considered the high point in Spain's\u00a0literary\u00a0history.\n\nNashua Gallagher\n\nThe event will also feature local poet Nashua Gallagher, who recently published her first book of poetry All the Words a Stage with local publisher Chameleon Press. Ms Gallagher, who grew up attending the Book Fair as a student, said she is delighted to be participating in this year\u2019s fair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of three readers who will read [out] translations of some Baroque-era love poetry,\u201d said Ms Gallagher. \u201cThe Silver Way, a trading route discovered between Spanish America and China, has always been such an important trade partner. With trade, you get all sorts of unintentional interactions like the arts, and it\u2019s putting the spotlight on some of the things that come out of the Spanish-speaking world.\u201d\n\nMs Corondao agreed. \u201cThe incomparable accomplishments of writers and artists of the \u2018Siglo de Oro\u2019 were gilded in no small part by gold from Spain\u2019s territories in the New World. It was also Spanish America\u00a0\u2013 though it\u2019s silver rather than its gold \u2013 which from 1565 on tied the Spanish-speaking world to Asia. The flowering of Spanish arts and letters was paralleled by the tremendous growth of commerce along the \u2018ruta de la plata\u2019 or [the] \u2018Silver Way\u2019.\u201d\n\nInternational Writers\n\nThe Hong Kong Book Fair will also spotlight international authors at various seminars, including one that will be moderated by Ms Gallagher and featuring Singaporean author Balli Kauer Jaswal, whose latest novel, Erotic Stories for Punjab Widows, was recently selected for actress Reese Witherspoon\u2019s book club.\n\n\u201cReese Witherspoon's selection was a huge surprise! I was thrilled. I've been a fan of her book club for a while now, so I'm so happy to be in such great company with other female authors.\u201d Ms Jaswal said.\n\nMs Jaswal has published three novels and is currently working on a fourth titled The Unlikely Adventures of the Shergill Sisters, about three British-Indian sisters who travel to India to honour their late mother\u2019s wish. Having been to Hong Kong once before, Ms Jaswal is looking forward to participating in the Book Fair for the first time.\n\n\u201cI'll be discussing rebellious women in South Asian fiction, and how they are portrayed in immigrant narratives,\u201d she said. \u201cI'll be examining how female characters resist conforming to traditional roles as sisters, daughters and wives, and how the feminine identity is defined with more nuance with the emergence of a range of women's voices in South Asian diaspora literature.\u201d\n\nSharing Stories\n\nBalli Kaur Jaswal\n\nAnother author to be featured at this year\u2019s Book Fair is Sharlene Teo, who won the inaugural Deborah Rogers Writer\u2019s Award for her debut novel Ponti. She is currently completing a PhD in Creative and Critical Writing at the University of East Anglia, where she received the Booker Prize Foundation Scholarship and the David TK Wong Creative Writing award. At the fair, she will be discussing her book Ponti with Hong Kong writer Chip Tsao.\n\n\u201cI'll be talking about my novel Ponti and themes around it, including movies and filmmaking, film influences, Malay and Southeast Asian myths that influenced the story,\u201d Ms Teo said.\n\nSharlene Teo\n\nMs Teo first came up with the idea for her novel from a dream about a woman climbing out of a tree, with the writing process taking four years. For aspiring local writers, Ms Teo offered this advice: \u201cKeep reading and keep trying, the most important thing is to read widely and hold ideas for stories in your head and turn them over and over every day.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms Teo has previously been to Hong Kong, this will be her first time participating in the Book Fair. \u201cI have heard that it is spectacular and buzzing and I'm so honoured and excited to be a part of it this year!\u201d\n\nApart from featuring authors from both Hong Kong and around the world, the fair will present numerous other highlights, including an international publishing forum featuring leaders from the publishing industry, a number of children\u2019s events and an International Cultural Village exhibiting books and cultural products from different parts of the globe. More than 300 cultural events will be held across the city during the week-long exhibition, which will welcome a record number of 680 exhibitors from 37 different countries and regions.\n\nRelated Links\na Dash of Nash\nBalli Kauer Jaswal\nDiana Coronado\nHong Kong Book Fair\u00a0\n\nContent provided by Hong Kong Trade Development Council\nComments (0)\nShows local time in Hong Kong (GMT+8 hours)\n\nHKTDC welcomes your views.

        "text":"Arts & Life Books\n\n\nAuthor Larry McMurtry marries Ken Kesey\u2019s widow\n\nWhen it comes to Texas literature, no one comes closer to royalty than Larry McMurtry. And on the day the world was watching Will and Kate\u2019s very public royal spectacle in London, McMurtry was quietly tying the knot here in Texas, with the widow of a fellow literary king.\n\nMost people who live in McMurtry\u2019s hometown of Archer City \u2014 which inspired his novel and subsequent movie, The Last Picture Show \u2014 won\u2019t say anything on the record, but word is that the couple got married in a civil ceremony and that the no-longer-lonesome doves have left the area to enjoy their honeymoon.\n\nSo who\u2019s the lucky woman?\n\nAccording to Karren Winter, the county clerk in Archer County, the bride is Norma Faye Kesey. She is the widow of Ken Kesey, author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and other books. He died in 2001 at 66.\n\nThe bride is 76. McMurtry is 74. Winter confirmed that the couple married in Archer City on April 29.\n\nWinter says that like most folks in Archer City (pop., 1,791), she knows the McMurtry family and thus knew that \u201cFaye,\u201d as they call her, was Kesey\u2019s widow. Public records agree.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re truly happy, they\u2019re very sweet,\u201d Winter said Thursday. \u201cIt was really good to see Larry look so happy. They were just the sweetest couple coming in to get their marriage license.\u201d\n\nMcMurtry and Ken Kesey had connections beyond Jack Nicholson, who starred in movie versions of their novels (Cuckoo\u2019s Nest for Kesey, Terms of Endearment for McMurtry). As young writers, they became friends at Stanford University when they were co-recipients of a fellowship that allowed them to study under the great Wallace Stegner. McMurtry emerged from the program to produce his debut novel, Horseman, Pass By, which was published in 1961 and became the movie Hud, starring Paul Newman. He would later win the Pulitzer Prize for his novel Lonesome Dove.\n\nKesey debuted in 1962 with Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. He became a counterculture icon and the main character in Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test \u2014 in which McMurtry and \u201cFaye\u201d are each mentioned frequently. According to published accounts, she was Kesey\u2019s high-school sweetheart, with whom he eloped in 1956. Wolfe describes her as having \u201clong, sorrel-brown hair and is one of the prettiest, most beatific-looking women I ever saw.\u201d\n\nMcMurtry had married once before, in the 1950s.\n\nCalls to McMurtry\u2019s friends, family members and writing partner Diana Ossana, with whom he shares an Oscar for the Brokeback Mountain screenplay, were either not returned or answered with polite no-comments.\n\neditor picks\n\nWhat do you think of comments on Take our survey!\nTo learn more about how we can provide a better experience in our comment threads, we're asking interested commenters and readers to complete a survey about your experience on\n\nTo participate in the survey, click here.\nTo post a comment, log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Tadamichi Kuribayashi's Picture Letters From the Commander-in-Chief, the real-life inspiration for Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima, will ship in June. Miyuki Miyabe's Brave Story novel also inspired a movie (from GONZO) as well as a manga series before its July release in North America. July's Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence is the reverse, being Masaki Yamada's novelization based on Mamoru Oshii's movie sequel.\n\nAs previously announced, one novel, one Anime Profiles book, one color Movie Ani-Manga, and twelve manga volumes for Naruto will flood stores by year's end. The first of 16 Shana of the Blazing Eyes light novels that inspired the anime and manga series will publish in October.

He will be in Damariscotta from 10 a.m. until noon and in Boothbay Harbor from 1-3 p.m.\n\n    \u201cReturn to Moose River, In Search of the Spirit of the Great North Woods,\u201d released this summer by Down East Books, a division of Rowan and Littlefield, includes more than a dozen narrative non-fiction essays chronicling adventures across the breadth of Maine, from the iconic Moose River, to the top of Mount Katahdin in Baxter State Park, Telos, to the Appalachian Trails\u2019 100-Mile Wilderness, and Moosehead Lake, to the majestic St. Croix River on the border with New Brunswick. White-water canoeing, backpacking and snowmobiling adventures are all included.\n\n    The essays in \u201cReturn to Moose River,\u201d chronicle the semi-annual expeditions by a ragtag group of friends and family, that became known as the Moose River Camping Club, over more than three decades.\n\n    The very first \u201cMoose\u201d trip in 1986 was on the Moose River. It ended with a pledge to return there every ten years.\n\n    The first essay takes place ten years after that inaugural trip, after sons joined the group, and beards became tinged with gray. The last essay is ten years after that, when the group returns once again, this time bearing the ashes of the author\u2019s twin brother who had passed away tragically on a river trip the year before.\n\n    Each essay focuses on the featured area\u2019s natural and human history. For Brechlin, it is the spirits of those who have traveled Maine\u2019s woods and waters before, as much as anything, that give these areas special significance.\n\n    \u201cWe\u2019ve done such a great job of conserving land and water in Maine but we haven\u2019t done as well preserving the human history and legends that populate these places,\u201d Brechlin explains. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the native Americans, early settlers, explorers, loggers or others, you can\u2019t separate the people from the land or the land from the people and we need to do more to celebrate that,\u201d he adds.\n\n    Brechlin is the author of more than a dozen books including \u201cThe Adventure Guide to Maine,\u201d hiking, and paddling guides to Acadia National Park, and numerous volumes using antique postcards to share the history of Maine and New England. A former Maine Journalist of the Year, he worked for nearly 40 years in the state\u2019s newspaper industry and was the founding editor of the Mount Desert Islander. He is a regular columnist for \u201cIslandport Magazine\u201d and his work has appeared in the Boston Globe, \u201cNewsweek,\u201d \u201cDown East Magazine,\u201d The New York Times, \u201cChevy Outdoors,\u201d and the Maine Sportsman.\n\n    A graduate of the University of Maine Forestry School, Brechlin\u2019s family roots include Maine author Ruth Moore and lighthouse heroine Abbie Burgess. For several years, he operated a small independent bookstore in Bar Harbor featuring Maine authors and illustrators and writers who worked here.\n\n    \u201cReturn to Moose River is being celebrated by noted writers and pillars of Maine\u2019s outdoor community.\n\n    \u201cIf you are looking for authentic Maine, it lives in the heart and soul of Earl Brechlin and spills forth in this book, \"Return to Moose River,\u201d says retired Baxter State Park Superintendent Jensen Bissell. \u201cUsing his canoe as a needle and the rivers of Maine as thread, Brechlin weaves a beautiful tapestry of the Pine Tree State. I thought I knew Maine's Northwoods, but I learned a few things from Return to Moose River - what a great read! It makes me want to grab my paddle and get out on the water!\u201d\n\n    \u201cAlong with celebrating the grandeur and resilience of Maine\u2019s Great North Woods, \u2018Return to Moose River,\u2019 explores an unbreakable bond between brothers, the triumph of love over tragedy, and the power of a timeless landscape to inspire and heal the human spirit,\u201d says Christina Baker Kline, #1 New York Times bestselling author of \u201cOrphan Train\u201d and \u201cA Piece of the World.\u201d\n\n    Environmentalist and filmmaker Susan Cohn Rockefeller says, \u201cReturn to Moose River\u201d is a must read for anyone who loves Maine.

Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian Graham Turner\/Guardian\n\nSalman Rushdie is drawing the title of his new memoir from the alias he was forced to adopt during the decade he spent in hiding, Joseph Anton.\n\nAfter the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Rushdie on 14 February 1989, sentencing him to death because his novel The Satanic Verses was accused of being \"against Islam, the Prophet and the Qu'ran\", the author went underground, living under police protection for almost 10 years. Asked to choose an alias for police to call him by, Rushdie plucked a name from the combination of the first names of two writers he loved: Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov.\n\n\"I made it the title of the book because it always felt very strange to be asked to give up my name, I was always uncomfortable about it, and I thought it might help dramatise, for the reader, the deep strangeness and discomfort of those years,\" said Rushdie.\n\nJoseph Anton, out on 18 September, will tell of the years the author spent in hiding. \"He talks about the sometimes grim, sometimes comic realities of living with armed policemen, and of the close bonds he formed with his protectors; of his struggle for support and understanding from governments, intelligence chiefs, publishers, journalists, and fellow writers; and of how he regained his freedom,\" said his publisher Random House. \"How do a writer and his family live with the threat of murder for over nine years? How does he go on working? How does he fall in and out of love? How does despair shape his thoughts and actions, how and why does he stumble, how does he learn to fight back?\"\n\nFour years ago Rushdie received an apology in the high court from the author and publisher of a book about the time he spent under police protection, for false claims including that the author was locked in a room by his protection officers, with whom his relationship was claimed to be unfriendly. He has since been working with archivists at Emory University in Atlanta, where a collection of his papers is housed, to tell the story himself.\n\nHis publisher called Joseph Anton a book of \"exceptional frankness and honesty, compelling, provocative, moving, and of vital importance. Because what happened to Salman Rushdie was the first act of a drama that is still unfolding somewhere in the world every day.\"",

The Oct. 25 event is at Prestwick Country Club.

When I turned 3, I got a Golden book from the mail carrier, Mr. Gleason. His wife was the second grade teacher. They had no children ... the books were their way of giving back to the community.\u201d\n\nWillis doesn\u2019t know if the Gleasons of Alta Vista, Kan., gave books to all 3-year olds, or perhaps to those who might otherwise not have a book. She tells the story by way of explaining why \u201cThis is really a passion for me.\u201d\n\nFirst Book \u2014 Horry County in the past several months has awarded $22,300 to schools and organizations such as Freedom Readers and Kids Hope USA, a St. Stephens Episcopal Church mentoring program at Loris Elementary School. Freedom Readers is an after-school reading program. The two nonprofits received the most recent grants, totaling $8,300, as did Green Sea Floyds and South Conway Elementary schools. Other 2013-14 grants were to Horry County First Steps and Homewood (Conway) and Socastee schools.\n\nFirst Book is a national program with about 170 advisory boards such as First Book \u2014 Horry County, the only one in South Carolina, Willis says. Since 2000, the Horry organization has awarded more than $116,000 in grants that have helped more than 5,800 children. Schools receiving grants are Title I schools, meaning they have a high population of children from families below the poverty line. Two-thirds of Horry County Schools children are from such families. Schools and organizations apply for the grants.\n\nOnce awarded a grant, recipients access an Online account on First Book\u2019s Marketplace ( www.fbmarketplace.org ). The average price of a children\u2019s book on Marketplace is $2.50, so the $22,300 in 2013-14 grants buys 8,900 books. Nationally, First Book has pushed publishers of childrens books for low-cost books, Willis says, and for greater cultural diversity in children\u2019s books.\n\nThe books must go home with the children, so they can share with siblings and parents. Children receive a bookplate for their names.\n\nFirst Book \u2014 Horry County raises money through Author Luncheons, held two or three times a year. \u201cOur signature event,\u201d chairwoman Mona Prufer says of the luncheons. The upcoming event on Oct. 25 at Prestwick Country Club, will feature national television personality Cokie Roberts, author of \u201cFounding Mothers,\u201d now in a children\u2019s edition. An April 19 luncheon featured Charleston author Batt Humphries.\n\n\u201cWe would love a sponsor\u201d to underwrite the upcoming Fall Author\u2019s Luncheon, Prufer says. Having a sponsor underwrite the cost of the meal means ticket sale revenue goes to First Book. Prufer notes that \u201c97 percent of everything raised goes to the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cBooks, reading, literacy are what we\u2019re all about.\u201d\n\nMyrtle Beach Sun News is pleased to provide this opportunity to share information, experiences and observations about what's in the news.

She joins the British Women\u2019s Air Force and becomes an interpreter of aerial photographs, searching for bomb targets on the continent by scrutinizing the photos through a pair of stereo glasses.\n\n\u201cHistory books are generally written by men, so I thought it was important to tell the story of World War II through the eyes of a woman,\u201d explained author and former Pioneer publisher Elinor Florence, who found inspiration to write the novel from of an old black and white photo in a magazine of a woman in a British Air Force uniform bent over a set of aerial photographs.\n\n\u201cThere was no other way to find out what the Germans were up to except for spying on them from the sky,\u201d she said. Through a linear series of photos taken by spy planes, the photo interpreters \u2014 both men and women \u2014 were able to use stereo viewing glasses to see a three-dimensional view from an airplane\u2019s perspective.\n\nMs. Florence, who owned and published The Pioneer from 2004 to 2010, will see her first novel published by Toronto\u2019s Dundurn Press in Fall 2014.\n\n\u201cUnlike newspapers, the book publishing industry moves very slowly,\u201d she said. Prior to a release of wartime records by British Intelligence in 1995, there were only \u201csome very sketchy accounts of women in this role,\u201d said Ms. Florence, who began writing the book in 1997.\n\n\u201cI finished the first draft in 2000, although I was busy working and raising four children,\u201d Ms. Florence said. \u201cLike many first novels, it ended up in a shoebox. But last year I pulled it out again, revised it and sent it off.\u201d\n\nGiven time to re-read the draft over the winter, Ms. Florence opted to change her protagonist\u2019s view from third-person to first-person, bringing readers inside the mind of the young Women\u2019s Air Force member.\n\n\u201cI decided it was better in first person; I think that was a big improvement,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring her background research, she interviewed several area residents, including bomber pilot Ed Kluczny. Others have since passed away \u2013 pilots Leo Richer, Arthur Bradford, Duncan McIntosh and Art Wilks; and women\u2019s air force veterans Lou Marr and Nancy Tegart.\n\n\u201cMy whole family was very involved in the war effort,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father, who died in 2003, served in the Royal Canadian Air Force; and my mother June Florence, who lives here in Invermere, volunteered on the home front,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is Ms. Florence\u2019s first foray into fiction, after a journalism career that started at her hometown newspaper in North Battleford, then went on to the Western Producer in Saskatoon, the Red Deer Advocate, the Winnipeg Sun and the Vancouver Province (as it was then called) before moving to Invermere with her family in 1996. She was a regular writer for Reader\u2019s Digest from 1997 to 2004.\n\nThe Pioneer will follow up with a future article to inform readers when the book will become available. Those wishing to reach Ms. Florence in the meantime can email her at elinor1@telus.net .\n\n2 Responses to Local author pens World War II novel\n\n  1. April Sorensne says:\n\n    CONGRATS Elinor on the book!!!! Sure miss working with you at the Pioneer! Best of luck on your new ventures.\n\n  2. Lesley Starnes says:\n\n    Congratulations Elinor, we thought perhaps you had retired after you sold the Pioneer, but like many of us you still have projects!!! We will be looking forward to reading your book here in southwestern Ontario. We miss Invermere still and all of wonderful and amazingly artistic people in this small mountain paradise.\n\n    Lesley & Nick\n    retired (Blue Rooster Pottery)\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Korreck, Robert Vandermolen, Miriam Pederson, and David Landrum, will be on hand to share two or three of their poems and meet with members of the community.\n\nGreg Lewis, teen paraprofessional at the Kentwood branch of Kent District Library, organized the event after attending a reading for Song of the Owashtanong when it was first published this spring.\n\n\u201cI was taken aback by this magical evening, and I wanted to bring it out to the suburbs,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe poetry in the collection ranges from very deep and insightful poems to humorous works, Lewis said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a beautiful art medium, but it\u2019s also very casual and laid back and approachable,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re avidly into poetry or not really familiar with it, it\u2019s a great starting point to hear some poetry read.\u201d\n\nCope, who has been the poet laureate of Grand Rapids since 2011 and has published several books of poetry, said public readings give the larger community an opportunity to see and hear the poets in their midst.\n\n\u201cPoems should always be read aloud, in order to fully experience the musical syllables in the line and their relation to the sense and movement of the poem,\u201d he said. \u00a0\n\n\u201cPoetry is an art of eloquence with words and compassionate attentiveness to the world around us,\u201d he said. \u201cLocal poets give eloquent voice to the depths of experience to be found in a community, giving perspective on that experience.\u201d\n\nThe event is being sponsored by the Friends of the Kentwood Library. Copies of the book will be sold at the program for $10, and proceeds from sales of the anthology will go to help replenish the Grand Rapids poet laureate fund, helping to ensure that there will be future laureates after Cope\u2019s term expires in 2014.",

Singularity & Co. is having its opening party tonight, and should be open for business soon.\n\nIn addition to being a new place for you to go buy books and share your love of speculative fiction, Singularity & Co. is also on a mission to help save classics of the genre. The bookstore has launched the \"Save the Sci Fi\" project, which aims to bring one cult science fiction novel back into print every month, and also publish that novel online for free as an ebook. That project has already raised $52,000 on Kickstarter. (We covered this project before.)\n\nAs the Guardian's Damien Walter points out, this isn't the only new project that aims to bring classic SF texts back from \"out of print\" limbo \u2014 SF publisher Gollancz has also launched the \"Gateway SF\" project, aimed at reissuing some great older novels as ebooks.",
