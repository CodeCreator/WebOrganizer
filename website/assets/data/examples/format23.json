        "text":"Naim Mu-so and Mu-so Qb review: music to my ears\n\nVincent Nguyen - Nov 25, 2016\nNaim Mu-so and Mu-so Qb review: music to my ears\nEditors' Rating: 8\/10\n  \u2022 Excellent audio quality, loud output without breaking\n  \u2022 Minimal and sleek design, uncluttered ports\n  \u2022 Works great in tandem with up to 5 Mu-so Qb's\n  \u2022 Expensive price tag\n  \u2022 Lacks HDMI input\n\nThese days, the names of Harman Kardon and Bose are becoming more and more prevalent, especially in tech and in cars, but they are hardly the only trusted Hi-Fi names in the audio market. And while Sonos has had a good head start in the wireless Wi-Fi speaker market, it\u2019s hardly the only game in town. And depending on your audio proclivities, it might not even be the best. Naim\u2019s name holds just as much weight as the top players, especially in the UK, and while its first wireless system, the Mu-so, is almost two years old, it, together with the Mu-so Qb wireless speakers, remain one of the best sounding wireless audio systems money can buy.\n\nPrestigious pedigree\n\nDon\u2019t let the odd sounding name put you off. Naim has been in the industry for decades, tracing back its humble beginnings to power amplifiers before rising to become one of the UK\u2019s top hi-fi equipment manufacturers. And if you ever need proof of its quality and prestige, you need only look at its three Queen\u2019s Awards for Enterprise and its partnership with Bentley, a name that is also synonymous with luxury in cars.\n\nThe Mu-so is Naim\u2019s first entry into the then fledgling wireless speaker system industry, launched in the later parts of 2014. But less like most technologies and more like great wine, the Naim Mu-so\u2019s excellence hasn\u2019t become obsolete and has, in fact, aged gracefully. And even while the company has just recently launched its spiritual successor, the more compact Mu-so Qb, the Mu-so integrates perfectly with the newer hardware, a testament to the company\u2019s forward thinking and strategic planning.\n\nJust as good as its sounds\n\nWireless audio has received no small amount of flak for issues of quality and stability. So naturally, there was some apprehension when the Mu-so came out with a not so small price tag. Nonetheless, the wireless speaker proved naysayers and doubters wrong and delivered an audio quality unheard of, no pun intended, among its ilk.\n\nHands down, the Mu-so and Mu-so Qb are the best wireless speakers I\u2019ve tested. Together, they\u2019re pretty damn hard to beat with little compromises. Sound quality is rich, accurate from low frequencies up to heavy bass and treble. You get a sense of depth in whatever you happen to be listening to. Everything from Les Miserable to The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, and, yes, even TV sounds are utterly mind-blowing good.\n\n\nThe Mu-so really shines when you pump up the volume. It manages to fill the room without making you feel like your eardrums are going to burst. Whereas other speakers trip up and fail to keep up, the Mu-so handles all types of music, at all levels, like a boss. You get none of the noise you\u2019d hear with other audio systems at higher volumes, delivering bass that is full yet clear, though some might actually be put off by the thickness of it.\n\nAlbeit less than half in length, the Mu-so Qb is no less capable than its predecessor and larger partner. We were practically amazed at how powerful its output was for such a small speaker. Like the Mu-so itself, the bass is the Qb\u2019s strong point though not exclusively. And like the Mu-so as well, the rich and thick yet clear bass coming from the smaller box might not be to everyone\u2019s tastes. While the Qb does also fairly well on treble and mid-range, it does falter a bit on the latter. It didn\u2019t have the same subtle gradation that the larger speaker offered, a limitation of physics more than anything. Still, for a speaker with as small cabinet as this, the Mu-so Qb easily blasts the competition away, especially when it came to the bass.\n\nA work of art\n\nAlthough Naim is known for the excellence of its audio equipment, it is equally known for its exquisite taste in design. The two speakers, which look quite similar except in size, are so damn elegant that they look more like pieces of modern art in the living room rather than speakers. That is, until you look closer and see the volume and control dial on top.\n\n\nThat in itself, however, is also a work of art. Unlike the traditional volume controls you\u2019d see in most audio equipment, the Mu-so\u2019s, and the Qb\u2019s by extension, features a large dial with an illuminated display panel, rooted inside a carved section of the top surface. This is such an elegant design choice as well as timeless. Operating the dial is smooth and graceful, with the volume indicator light around the edge steadily increasing or decreasing, every notch fills the room ever-so rich with delight.\n\nEverything about the dial design oozes premium from the smooth brush aluminum to the ambient light that\u2019s so pleasing to the eyes. And everything down to the touch-sensitive keys on the display panel exudes simplicity to an extreme, and yet, at the same time, sacrifices neither functionality nor ease of use when switching between inputs.\n\n\nThose input sources, at least the wired ones, are all hidden, either to the side or at the back, out of sight and out of mind. On the Mu-so, USB port and a 3.5mm input jack are placed on the side, while the Ethernet port, optical digital audio input, as well as power cord plug are recessed under the belly of the unit.\n\nThe Mu-so Qb is like a smaller, cut-down version of the Mu-so. An 8-inch cube in place of a long rectangular box, the Qb bares the exact same design as its larger and older sibling, down to the same volume and controls dial. As for the ports, these are all located in a single row on the back side of the speaker.\n\nSome might see this as unceremoniously shoving aside precious connectivity for the sake of beauty, but in the case of the Mu-so anyway, it\u2019s all about connections made over the air.\n\nWe are family\n\nWhen the Mu-so first landed almost two years ago, it was Naim\u2019s sole entry into the wireless speaker market. Although designed to work flawlessly with other Mu-so speakers, the steep price may have prevented it from being utilized to that extent. Fast-forward two years later, the Mu-so Qb was born, giving audiophiles the chance, admittedly for a price, to setup their dream wireless home audio system.\n\nIt was almost as if Naim created the original Mu-so with the Qb in mind, seeing years into the future. That\u2019s because the two work so well together they might as well have been launched together. A single Mu-so can pair with up to five Mu-so Qb\u2019s set up all around the house for your listening pleasure. You can connect individually to each Qb or, if you\u2019re in a party mode, sync up with all of them at the same time. And since the Mu-so Qb delivers near equal performance as the larger Mu-so, you\u2019re assured of that same quality no matter where you are in the house.\n\nMu-so remote\n\nIn addition to the wired connections mentioned above, the Mu-so supports wireless standards such as uPnP, AirPlay, Spotify Connect, and Bluetooth. The one proverbial wart in the Mu-so\u2019s connectivity face is that it doesn\u2019t do HDMI. Curiously, neither does the more recent Qb.\n\n\nFrom the time I\u2019ve spent with the Mu-so the sound quality is \u201cmusic to my ears\u201d \u2013 a gift that keeps on giving, even after years of being in the market and being challenged by newcomers almost every quarter. For something that has outstanding audio quality, a sleek design, and all the bells and whistle of a wireless speaker system, a higher price tag may not be surprising. Even so, some might find the $1,500 cost of the Mu-so, plus the near-$1,000 of a single Qb, to be prohibitively expensive. For a lover of sound, however, it may well be worth the price.\n\nMu-so Qb\n\nAnd the savings might even add up to make up for the costs. I usually find myself working at a Starbucks when I\u2019m home, but ever since I\u2019ve gotten Mu-su setup in the house, I have every reason to stay planted at home.\n\n\nMust Read Bits & Bytes",

        "text":"Back Comments (2) Share:\nFacebook Button\n\n\nWith the bank threatening to take Ty Hackett\u2019s (Columbus Short) house away, leaving him and his brother Jimmy (Andre Kinney) homeless and penniless, Ty is left with no choice but to take up the offer from friend and work colleague Mike Cochrane (Matt Dillon) when he asks Ty to play a part in an inside job at their security firm.\n\nWith forty-two million in their security vans, the plan is a simple one. Make it look like a robbery, hide the money, and wait. That is until they are spotted by a hapless hobo in the warehouse they\u2019re stashing the money in and panic turns into murder. Having a flash change of heart and taking refuge in one of the locked vans, Ty only needs to wait it out for fifty-eight minutes until they miss a phone check in and the cops come. However, the rest of his team have other plans and if they get to Ty, he\u2019s in trouble.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a remake? Surely this has to be a remake? This feels like a remake of a seventies movie that probably wasn\u2019t that good then and they\u2019ve not made it much better now. I mean, the premise is a sound one, one honest guy in amongst a group of rogues, holed up in a locked security while they try to bash their way in to get him and the last of the money. This could and should be full of tension, but really Armored plays a little too broad for its own good and the writer takes routes that are just plain ridiculous.\n\nOutside of the atrocious dialogue, which is so clunky it\u2019s unreal, and the numerous scenes of unbelievably badly handled twists and turns in the heist gone bad (Matt Dillion\u2019s attempt at lying to sheriff deputy Jake Eckehart (Milo Ventimiglia) is laughable. \u201cOh there\u2019s no siren in there. No, you don\u2019t want to go in there, erm, err an old dog crawled in there and died erm, err\u201d)\n\nThere are glimmers of really wanting Ty to succeed, thanks in large part to Columbus Short\u2019s likable leading man performance. However, it\u2019s the utter stupidity of the story that flatlines the credibility of movie. For starters the fake suspense is laughable. When the team go to pick up their massive money shipment, it\u2019s played like they've already done something wrong, which is ridiculous. At this stage they are just doing their jobs\u2014loading up their van with money. Why is this being played like they have fake ID or are conning someone? This is actually their job. Even more so the amount of times Ty manages to get out of the van only to go back into again for no real reason is absolute insanity. I could swallow it the first time. He saved a cop (though getting back in the van seemed a lesser option to taking the cop out of the building and hiding), but when he sneaks out, goes to the roof to call the cops only to sneak back in again (as opposed to leaving the building to get some more immediate help) Ty\u2019s decision making blew a hole in my caring about what happened next.\n\nArmored is utter junk food with more than its fair share of actors slumming it. Jean Reno brings nothing to the movie, Fishburne has never felt more like he was acting, I\u2019ve never understood how Matt Dillon manages to keep playing the same role time and time again. Really, Armored just ends up another one of those \u201cmeh\u201d big glossy movies that all look and feel the same and are about as shallow as kiddies\u2019 paddling pool.\n\n\nNow the movie might be watchable guff, but thanks to the fantastic transfer it\u2019s a pretty looking load of guff. From the get go the level of detail is apparent. Stubble, shaved heads, skin textures (Laurence Fishburne was born for HD) and even the small things like seeing that Matt Dillion\u2019s ear has been pierced are all shown off with the movies bright warm lighting and sharpness.\n\nThe night shots are deep black and the use of shadow to show Dillon\u2019s dark side is also captured well. There\u2019s next to no grain thanks to the bright midday setting of the whole movie and while the action scenes are few and far between, they are pretty well shot and look great in the HD presentation.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, there\u2019s really only a couple of action scenes and it\u2019s only in these that the DTS-HD Master Audio track comes alive and quite effectively. Beyond that, it\u2019s just a case of strong dialogue, with Fishburne\u2019s voice booming harder than the rest, especially with his heavy laugh and the clanging of metal as the team try desperately to hammer out the pins in the armoured van\u2019s hinges.\n\nThe odd gunshot ups the volume a little and the score can sometimes get quite dynamic throughout the speakers but really the track is doing a fairly standard job without having the opportunity to bring any bells and whistles.\n\n\nThe commentary featuring Producer Dan Farah, Skeet Urich and Milo Ventimiglia is laid back and fairly loose. There are a few good moments (usually unrelated to the actual movie), but the three keep up the pace throughout the movie, offering up small nuggets of fun movie making tales and taking comedy pops at some of actors (and themselves) on screen.\n\nAs well as the usual Sony Blu-ray live and MovieIQ features, we have \u2018Planning the Heist: \u00a0Making Of\u2019 (15:19 HD) which is pretty straight forward stuff but gives a good insight from the writer James V. Simpson regarding his intentions with the story and Antal\u2019s approach to it.\n\n\u2018Armed and Underground: Production Design\u2019 (06:47 HD) looks at the abandoned factory setting as well as the lesser used locations and \u2019Crash Course: Stunts' (11:30 HD) focuses on the action moments of the movie.\n\nLastly there are trailers for \u2018 Blu-ray is High Definition\u2019, 2012 and Michael Jackson\u2019s This Is It.\n\n\n\nThis release is a fairly typical Sony affair, with a passable batch of features but a pretty great A\/V presentation. The movie itself is an okay watch once movie which I won\u2019t deny had the odd spike of guilty enjoyment. It\u2019s fairly well made and has a short enough run time not to outstay its welcome but it really misses the opportunity to take advantage of its strong cast and utterly failed to convince me why the hell Ty kept going back to that van.\n\n* Note: The above images are taken from the Blu-ray release and resized for the page.

This review is from doing a side by side with 08 and 11.\nThe beer pours a amber red color with the 08 being a duller and murkier color with the 11 vibrant and clear. They both have a light tan head that fades quickly and sticks to the glass.\nThe 11 smell like a cherry and clove bomb, spicy, honey and alcohol. The 08 smells amazing much more balanced then the 11 with the smell a bit candy like.\nThe taste follows suite to the nose on both beers, the 11 was dominated by belgian flavors with clove, cherry and alcohol. The 08 tastes fantastic, its sweet yet spicy, the clove has faded off a lot revealing a balanced cherry and honey to mesh with the belgian flavors.\nThey both have a medium body and good carbonation. The 08 in my opinion is leaps and bounds better then the 11, if I get anymore bottles this year I will be putting them away for awhile.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n11-13-2011 20:41:51\u00a0|\u00a0More by BdubleEdubleRUN\nPhoto of jmerloni\n\n\n4.9\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +26.9%\nlook: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5\n\nA - Mahogany to ruby in coloration, with a small but heavy cream-colored head that laces fairly lacklusterly. But this is one of the only beers whose color I haven't been able to quite describe. It's a color I've never seen and I guess it's special in that way.\n\nS - Incredible smell. Light, FRESH maltiness, dark fruits which you can already tell are perfectly acidic and perfectly sweet in all the perfect, balanced places.\n\nT - Off the charts delicious. Tastes like how an 11% beer should taste without all the alcohol. Achieves a very impressive flavor profile between malt and and hop. Really, really impressed by the flavors here. They're really pleasant. Cherries! Honey malts. Fresh, west coast IPA hops. An incredible mix. Almost just jawdropping.\n\nM - Medium to light bodied, not very carbonated. Incrediblly profession makeup of each sip in this beer, though.\n\nD - One of the only beers I've ever tried that is just unmistakably elite. And one of the only beers I've ever encountered where a brewery just set out to make it great. It doesn't fit any real description nor style. Troegs just set out to make a great, elite beer, and they have with Mad Elf, they absolutely have.

Smudged born date.\n\nPoured a lucid tea color or light ruby red. Slight head, dissipated quickly. No lacing to speak of.\n\nSmells of belgian yeast, bananas and a hint of cherry. Not well projected.\n\nTaste is a just slightly tart, effervescent blend of spiced fruit and honey. The balance between honeyed sweetness and cherried tart really is perfect here, and I can't believe that the blend works as well as it does though. I can see some however, potentially finding this a little bit like cough syrup. It stops just short of synthetic for me, but more sensitive palates or supertasters may have a hard time with this one. Plenty effervescent, lot of boozy cherry in on the background, as those tertiary flavors take off into the drydown.\n\nOverall, really a unique beer that stands alone next to a slew of dark, stouty winter seasonals. I started off not liking it initially, as it was just so vast different from anything that I was used to, but working my way through the bottle really had me enjoying it at the end.

        "text":"Garden Of The Gods \/ Keahiakawelo\n\n5 stars from 8 reviews\nAddress Polihua Rd, Lanai City, HI 96763\nA long, bumpy, 4x4-only trail is the only way to get here. Spectacular view all around once you do arrive.\n\n\u2022 General: Cost: Free \u2022 General: Photo Opportunity\n\u2022 Hiking: Hiking \u2022 Hiking: Nature Walk\n\u2022 Sightseeing: Great Views \u2022 Cultural & Historical: Heiau \/ Sacred Site\n\nMatt Anderson's Take\nKeahiakawelo, according to Hawaiian lore, is the result of a contest between two kahuna (priests) from Lana'i and Moloka'i. Each was challenged to keep a fire burning on their respective island longer than the other, and the winner's island would be rewarded with great abundance. The Lanai kahuna, Kawelo, used every piece of vegetation in Keahiakawelo to keep his fire burning, which is why this area is so barren today.\n\nSo that's the history of Keahiakawelo. But let's talk more about the present day reality of what the Garden of the Gods (as it's more commonly called today) actually is. It's a Mars-like landscape filled with all sort of rocks and boulders out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSeriously, that's what it actually is: a rock garden. If you were expecting some sort of lush garden you will be disappointed but that doesn't mean you should pass this up.\n\nIt's about 14 miles if you are driving from the Four Seasons Resort Lanai at Manele Bay and about 7 miles from the main town area and no matter how you go it's about 6 miles of pure off road trail driving. We're talking dusty, dirty, bumpy, 4x4 only offroading goodness (even if you can only do 5-10 miles per hour the whole time).\n\nSo while the rocks aren't really a destination in my opinion, the real treat is the scenic view you get once you make the trip. Because it's an amazing view all around, including great views of Moloka'i island. So bring a camera but also pack in some snacks and plenty of drinks because you will be out in the middle of nowhere and likely won't have a cell single in some parts.\n\nPack extra supplies to be safe, and consider bringing toilet paper too because there are no facilities of any kind out here (and also a plastic bag to pack out what you packed in). That's right, hiking rules are in play so also ready up on Hiking Safety & Essentials just to be, well, safe.\n\nThis is a neat place to see and if you are on Lana'i and have a rental car (4x4 only) it's worth the trip but don't expect anything beyond scenery because you won't find it here.\nShare This On\nMatt Anderson\nAdded by on\n\nMatt A\nJoined: Feb 2013\nReviews: 790\nLikes Received: 106\nA pretty amazing place to see and the journey is part of the adventure. Go slow and take it easy and enjoy the trip there and back. Sure, it's just a rock garden but it's probably the most spectacular rock garden you'll ever see.\nBrett D\nJoined: Mar 2017\nReviews: 56\nLikes Received: 1\nWhile vacationing here we decided to rent a 4x4 and check out the Garden of the Gods. Didn't think to much about it as it looked like it was going to be nothing but just a lot of rocks, but once we go there I was awestruck, the rocks were fantastic. I took so many pictures of the scenery and loved the feeling of being in a place of isolation almost like we were the only ones left on earth. It can be a little rough of a ride but well worth it.\nKim S\nJoined: Oct 2016\nReviews: 10\nLikes Received: 0\nI guess I can't review Lanai as a whole so I will review via 1\/2 day trip from Maui via Trilogy Excursions. This was not a cheap trip by any means. $500 for 3 people but it was a worthwhile experience. The Trilogy ferry trip was 50 minutes each way. No commentary or conversation from the crew; simply transport. It was a relatively smooth trip, though my son did get a little seasick. I chose to ride outside, where I can see the scenery to keep my mind occupied and less inclined to notice the waves.\n\nWe chose the 1\/2 day Trekker excursion. This is the ferry to the island, where you are met by a guide in a 4x4 and taken to various sites around the island. Depending on how many people are in your group, the sites may vary. My son was very interested in the history of the island and what will happen to it now that it has been nearly bought out by the CEO of Oracle.\n\nOur guide was a native Lanaian who went by Uncle Tommy. We got a little more history than requested as he showed us his old home and an area called \"Snob Hill\" which took time into our other stops. We didn't really get to see much of Shipwreck Beach because of the delays but it was interesting nonetheless.\n\nGarden of the Gods was awesome and worth the trip in itself. We had to laugh at all the tourists who thought they would save a buck by renting their own 4x4 and do the tour themselves. Most of them were up to their axles in red sand and needed to be pulled out. So much for saving a little. Another stop was the new Four Seasons Hotel, which is a big part of the Island's new ownership and is actually a good thing for it's people. Honestly, Garden of the Gods was so awesome that if I return, I may try renting my own 4x4 so I can spend a little time hiking there. From what the tour guide told us, whenever a scene in Hawaii Five-0 requires a remote setting, the crew often heads to Lanai. With the exception of the massive hotels, it is an island more or less lost in time.\nSue K\nJoined: Mar 2016\nReviews: 196\nLikes Received: 9\nI loved The Garden of the Gods! We hired a jeep and hit the red dirt track leading us to this amazing spot. The stunning, desolate landscape is wild and windswept. You can see Maui on the horizon. The boulders and rock formations are cool and the colors unbelievable. We had the place to ourselves, which made it even more special. Definitely worth the bumpy journey.\nTeresa a\nJoined: Jul 2016\nReviews: 10\nLikes Received: 0\nLook for the stables and then get on the dirt track to Garden of the Gods. It's a fun, bumpy drive there and we had the whole place to ourselves. With views of Maui, the rocks of all shapes and sizes formed the landscape. It had the feel of being on the moon with the exception of the blue skies. Fabulous.\nDawn G\nJoined: Mar 2016\nReviews: 26\nLikes Received: 0\nIf you are on Lanai this is something you really should take the time to do. It's a quick drive through sort of thing once you're there. It does feel other-worldly and is a cool backdrop for photographs. As others have mentioned it's a bit of a long drive on a two-track road but getting there is half the fun.\nDewei T\nJoined: Aug 2015\nReviews: 20\nLikes Received: 0\nIt's basically the closest I'll ever get to Mars! What a neat place to see. Very windy out here and no bathrooms for a long, long way. See what I'm getting at here? Mind the direction of the wind if you have to empty your bladder out here! The ride here is pretty long and bumpy but also tons of fun. Gas up and bring food and water for sure.\nJoined: Apr 2015\nReviews: 21\nLikes Received: 1\nOne of the most amazing places to see in my opinion. It's like entering another world. The views here are just incredible in every direction. It's a bumpy trail getting here so rent a Jeep, put it into 4 wheel drive, and blaze a trail.\nMore Top Rated Lanai Places",

We then headed to the Benares Historic House for pictures - it was a perfect fall day and a wonderful backdrop for our photography. We only had an hour for pictures before we had to rush over to the reception hall, which was Pavilion Royale (Dixie\/Matheson area). A few little bumps throughout the night, but overall we had a wonderful day. We hope our reviews help you to find some good vendors (and avoid a few not-so-good ones).\n\n\nVendors & Venues Reviews\n\nCustom Made Wedding Cakes\nMississauga, ON\n\nChristine Hasler is amazingly talented.

We received compliments about the food, and the cheesecake in particular. We were in the upstairs Starlight room. They will be undergoing renovations to update the place, which may correct some of our complaints - the dance floor was really dark which did not make it great for pictures (though we were told their would be lights operated by the DJ). We also ha an issue that we did not anticipate - there is no washroom on the same floor we were on, but one is located in between the two floors. We had some guests with walkers or canes that had a lot of difficulty walking. The washroom is not accessible by their service elevator. This was a real problem throughout the night and we ended up having some guests use the bridal suite. The staff were very helpful, particularly Francesca who helped us organize everything. One major complaint: I didn't find the place very clean (for example, the table skirting around the two head tables had stains and food left on it when we went to set up the day before). Other than that, we were quite happy. The price was very reasonable and the old fashioned look was very charming.\n\nView Pavilion Royale\nHilton Garden Inn\nMississauga, ON\n\nExplore More in Mississauga, ON, Canada\n\nVenues \/ Vendors Real Weddings Wedding Photos Wedding Q&A Change City\n\nTry Our Free Wedding Planning Tools\n\nClick on each tool to see a sample.\n\nSample wedding map small Wedding Map\nSample seating chart small Seating Chart\nSample wedding website small Wedding Website\n\nCreate an account to start using these tools and more!\n\nCreate An Account\n\nOr try out our world-famous wedding map without registering!\n(it works great on mobile phones as well)\n\nCreate A Wedding Map",
