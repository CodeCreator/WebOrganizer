Reyes initially stopped in the middle of the street but sped off as officers approached his car on foot. 23 seconds later, he made a sharp left turn on 97th Street, lost control, jumped the curb, and pinned Ariel and Gutierrez to the side of the building, police said.\n\nThe NYPD is investigating the pursuit, he added.\n\nReyes \u2014 a junior at the St. Agnes Boys High School on the Upper West Side \u2014 told police he panicked during a routine traffic stop en route to his last day of classes because he was driving\u00a0 with only a learner's permit and was supposed to have an adult in the vehicle.\u00a0\n\nThe SUV was a gift from Reyes' mother, law enforcement sources said.\n\nAriel was declared dead at the hospital and Gutierrez was in stable condition at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hospital Wednesday afternoon.\n\nReyes was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital for breathing problems and was arraigned late Wednesday on charges of second degree manslaughter and unlawfully fleeing a police officer, according to the criminal complaint.\u00a0\n\nA witness said his car appeared to be driving between 50 to 60 miles per hour before turning left onto West 97th Street before the crash, the complaint stated.\u00a0\n\n\"For some reason or other they put those lights on and they scared the wits out of him and he took off \u2014 when that happens and you\u2019ve never had that experience he just followed an impulse,\" said Schmukler Thursday.\u00a0\n\nSchmukler said he did not know where Reyes was being held and that bail had not been set and his client had not entered a plea.\u00a0\n\nWhen bail was set, Schmukler said he expected there to be \"plenty of support,\" for Reyes.\n\n\"This poor kid will have to live for the rest of his life knowing that innocent people died withhis actions.\u00a0It\u2019s a tragedy all the way around,\" said Schmukler.\n\nLaw enforcement sources said Reyes likely would have only gotten a reprimand from the cops who\u00a0stopped him, or they might have made him called his mother to come get the car.\u00a0\n\n\"I guess he did not want to tell his mother,\" the source added. \"Now he has a whole lot more trouble and a child's dead.\"\n\nAt Tuesday's press conference, Kelly described young people driving without licenses as an age-old problem.\n\n\u201cYoung people driving with just learners' permits is not a new problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know of any new solutions to come up with.''\n\nAriel and her grandmother were one block away from the Holy Name School, where she was enrolled in a Pre-k program.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, students from the school filed into the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus for a 9:30 a.m. memorial service in her honor, struggling to understand her loss.\n\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d said Diana Rivera, 40, a volunteer at the school. \u201cThe little ones don\u2019t know what happened but they know someone is missing. They ask questions like \u2018where is she?\u2019 and \u2018when is she coming back?\u2019 All we can say is she is with the angels.\u201d\n\nStudents in uniform and grieving adults filled the seats of the church. The school choir, dressed in golden robes, sang a few songs for Ariel.\n\nAida Fonseca, a teacher\u2019s aid at Holy Name, remembered Ariel as a cheerful girl who had many friends. The little girl was an energetic student who enjoyed to dance, paint and read, she said.\n\n\u201cShe was always smiling and carried her little doll everywhere she went,\u201d Fonseca said.\n\nAriel\u2019s family did not attend the service.\n\n\u201cThey are devastated,\u201d Ariel\u2019s grandfather, Paolo Russo, 71, said of the family Tuesday. \u201cThis was a tragedy, and we are all very sad. We\u2019re mourning her loss.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Aidan Gardiner, Trevor Kapp and Emily Frost.",

Fragoso, a bellhop at 244 South Figueroa.\u00a0 Fragoso arranged to sell $10 of a substance he referred to only as \"junk\" or \"stuff\" to Officer Manuel Gutierrez.\u00a0 The \"junk\" in question was nothing but headache powder twisted into small paper bindles.\u00a0 As the arrest took place on April 1, 1954, Fragoso missed his opportunity to declare the whole thing an April Fool, and was arrested.\n\nAt his trial, the public defender argued that Fragoso had never claimed to be selling heroin, as he never uttered the word; however, the judge was unmoved.\u00a0 In 1954, a conviction for selling a substance under the pretense that it was a narcotic substance carried a sentence of up to one year in the County Jail.",

        "text":"How to Stop Burglars from Targeting Your Home\n\nhow to stop burglars from targeting your homeHow to Stop Burglars from Targeting Your Home\n\nAs a home owner I am always aware that there is a possibility that my home may be burgled. My possessions could be stolen and my home could be ransacked.\n\nWhat, if anything, can you do to reduce the chances of your home being targeted by burglars?\n\nThere is obviously no way of totally guaranteeing that your home will not be targeted by burglars. There are however a number of basic safeguards that you can take that will reduce the chances of your home being burgled.\n\nIf you want to know \u201chow to stop burglars from targeting your home\u201d I think it is important to understand a little bit about burglars and burglary in general.\n\nDo Burglars plan their burglaries in advance?\n\nAccording to information I have found most burglaries are crimes of opportunity. It is apparantly quite rare for a burglar to plan the burglary a long time in advance. He (or she) mostly simply notices that a particular property appears to be vulnerable and sees that as an invitation to break in.\n\nIn a lot of cases the burglar will live within just a few miles of the target home. If this is the case it makes it easy to learn the family\u2019s routine and decide upon the best time to enter the house.\n\nStatistically a burglary occurs approximately every eighteen seconds of every day in the USA.\n\nWhen is a burglary most likely to occur?\n\nContrary to common belief the majority of burglaries occur during daylight hours. Usually between 6am and 6pm and most commonly between the hours of 10am and 3 pm.\n\nGenerally speaking this is the time when a property is most likely to be unoccupied. The householder is likely to be out at work, shopping or pursuing other activities away from home.\n\nA burglar will also look for signs that you may be away on vacation. Fliers or newspapers left in the letterbox for days on end generally signals that the house is empty.\n\nHow long does it take to burgle your home?\n\nBurglars target homes that they see as \u2018easy targets\u2019. They generally want to be in and out of the property in ten minutes or less. The longer they remain in the property the higher the risk of being caught.\n\nHow do Burglars Gain Access to the property?\n\nThe majority of burglars, approximately 30%, gain access to a property via the doors or windows. Ground floor windows and doors are particular favourites. It is surprising how many people go out for the day and actually leave their windows either unlocked or even open (particularly in the summer months).\n\nThese points of entry become even more appealing if there are hedges or overgrown vegetation to provide some degree of cover.\n\nWhat is the most likely things that a burglar will steal?\n\nMost burglars will steal virtually anything they can lay their hands on. The only requirement is that it can be carried away easily. The majority of burglars will arrive on foot so do not want to draw too much attention to themselves when they leave.\n\nThe most desirable item to steal from the perspective of a burglar is cash. The second most desirable items are things such as jewellery, mobile phones, and expensive watches. They fit comfortably in the pocket and are easy to sell on afterwards.\n\nDocuments such as passports and driving licences are also highly sought after.\n\nCar keys are also regularly taken. If the car is in the driveway the burglar may decide to drive away in it. If the car is not there having the keys provides the opportunity to return at a later date and steal it then.\n\nWhat is the average cost of items stolen in a burglary?\n\nThe average value of goods stolen from a residential property is in excess of $2,200 dollars.\n\nThe cost of being burgled cannot however simply be measured in terms of monetary value. There is a huge emotional and psychological cost that cannot be measured in terms of dollars.\n\nIs it only empty properties that get burgled?\n\nThe majority of burglaries are carried out on empty properties. Statistically however it would seem that almost thirty per cent of burglaries are carried out whilst the home owner is in the house. Obviously catching someone robbing your home is a very traumatic experience. It can also result in the burglary escalating into a violent crime being committed against the home owner.\n\nGarden Sheds and Garages are also Targets for a Burglar\n\nAlthough the primary target for a burglar is likely to be the dwelling house itself garden sheds and garages may also be targeted.\n\nMost people will have expensive tools and garden equipment stored in their sheds and garages. Although these items tend to be bulky they can often be worth several thousand dollars. Well worth stealing if the burglar does happen to have the means of transporting them.\n\nA garden shed or garage may also contain ladders that could provide access to first storey windows that would normally be out of reach of the burglar.\n\nHow to Stop Burglars from Targeting your home \u2013 Steps you can take!\n\nThere are a number of basic steps that you can take that will help to reduce the likelihood of being a victim of a burglary.\n\nAs stated above the majority of burglaries are crimes of opportunity. If you make your property less appealing to the burglar then you will reduce the likelihood of your house being targeted.\n\nMost of the steps you need to take are extremely simple and do not require you spend any money at all to implement them. It is simply a matter of applying a few simple checks and procedures.\n\nIf you wish to take additional security measures to improve your home security it may be necessary to spend a few dollars to make the changes you require.\n\nUpgrading your household security can however be achieved quite inexpensively. Most of the equipment you require can be bought reasonably cheaply and most of it can be installed by anyone with basic DIY skills.\n\nTen Tips that will help you to Make your Home Burglarproof\n\n1. Don\u2019t leave doors and windows open.\n\nMake sure that you always lock your doors and windows securely. It is essential to do so when you leave the property unattended. It is also a good idea to make sure that your home is secure even when you are in the house. Particularly if you are in the house alone.\n\nRemember that once you have locked your doors and windows to remove the keys and put them in a safe place and out of sight.\n\nIf the locks on your doors and windows are quite old it may be worth investing in new replacement locks that offer a higher level of security.\n\n2. If you do not already have one it is well worth considering installing an intruder \/ burglar alarm.\n\nMake sure that either the alarm, or a notice stating that your home is fitted with an alarm system, is visible from the road in front of your property.\n\nBurglars prefer easy targets and will usually choose properties to rob that do not have alarm systems over those that do.\n\nIf you want to buy a burglar alarm there is a huge range to choose from. You can have a specialist company come to your home and fit it for you if you wish.\n\nAlternatively there are lots of burglar alarm kits available that can be installed by most competent DIY enthusiasts.\n\nYou can choose between wireless burglar alarm kits or the more traditional wired burglar alarm kits.\n\nPrices for DIY Burglar Alarm Kits vary considerably depending on your exact requirement but, generally speaking, a basic system could cost you as little as $100.00.\n\n3. Always make sure that valuables and cash are not left in plain sight.\n\nValuables, cash and important personal documents should always be locked away safely.\n\nThe best way to protect your valuables, and personal papers, is by placing them in a safe. The safe should be securely attached to a wall or the floor of your property and should be situated out of plain sight.\n\nA Home Security Safe can be purchased from around about $80.00 and can be easily fitted by any home handyman.\n\n4. Make sure that all garages and sheds are locked securely.\n\nOutbuildings are often easy targets for burglars. Very often they have locks that are inferior to those used on the main dwelling.\n\nAlthough most burglars would probably prefer to target your house there can still be a lot of valuable items worth stealing in the average garden shed.\n\nThere are also likely to be tools and ladders that could be utilised by an enterprising burglar to help him gain access to your home.\n\nCheck that the lock you are using on your garden shed. If it is not there are lots of locks for sheds and garages available that offer outstanding security features.\n\n5. If you have trees or hedges growing at the front of your property make sure that it is not allowed to grow too thick or too high.\n\nHedges provide excellent cover for would be burglars wanting to gain access to your property undetected.\n\nSide and rear boundary fences or hedges should be kept high in order to restrict access from neighbouring properties.\n\n6. If you have gates at the front or side of your property always ensure that they remain locked if at all possible.\n\nSimply restricting Access to your garden and the front of your house may actually be enough to deter a burglar from targeting your home.\n\n7. Although the majority of burglaries take place during the daytime there are, nonetheless, also a large number that are committed after the hours of darkness.\n\nAny form of low level exterior lighting helps to deter a burglar from targeting your home. Dawn to Dusk lighting that uses low wattage bulbs will not be intrusive for you but will provide sufficient light to make a burglar think twice about targeting your home.\n\nIf you really do not want your home to illuminated throughout the night then there are also loads of motion sensor exterior lighting options available.\n\nMotion sensor lighting only operates when movement is detected by the photocell attached to the light. There are a number of options available including conventionally wired lights, battery operated, and solar powered ext... (truncated)",

According to a report in the New York Daily News, the driver of a late-model four-door silver sedan was southbound on Central Avenue in Bushwick when he struck the bicyclist who was eastbound on George Street. The driver failed to stop and render aid to the victim. The injured victim was then rushed to a local hospital where he remains in critical condition. Police are still attempting to locate the hit-and-run driver. The victim was apparently a construction worker, who was well known for the bicycles he built on the side.\n\nHit-and-Run Collisions\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) reports that one out of every 10 crashes (about 11 percent) reported to the police involves a hit-and-run driver. Also, most hit-and-run crashes result in catastrophic injuries or even fatalities. Between the years 1994 and 2003, 14,914 people were killed in hit-and-run collisions, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety reported.\n\nNew York Hit-and-Run Law\n\nUnder New York Statute 600.2: \u201cAny person operating a motor vehicle who, knowing or having cause to know that personal injury has been caused to another person, due to an incident involving the motor vehicle operated by such person shall, before leaving the place where the said personal injury occurred, stop, exchange information and contact the authorities.\u201d\n\nCompensation for Hit-and-Run Victims\n\nInjured victims of hit-and-run accidents are often left struggling to pay their medical bills and other expenses associated with their losses. When the hit-and-run driver is not found, victims can seek compensation through the uninsured motorist clause of their auto insurance policies or through a quasi-state agency if there is no motor vehicle in the victim\u2019s household. This applies even to cases where the at-fault driver is uninsured or underinsured. In some incidents, bicyclists or pedestrians may be able to file a claim against the city or governmental agency, if a dangerous or defective roadway is found to have caused or contributed to their injuries.\n\nIf you or a loved one has been injured or if you have lost a loved one in a hit-and-run accident, the experienced New York personal injury attorneys at the Law Offices of Kenneth A. Wilhelm can help you better understand your legal rights and options. We obtained $2,000,000 for a 6-year-old girl who was injured by a hit-and-run driver.

He wanted to get his poems out there, inspire people and help them. I felt his life had been cut short and I just finished that project for him.\n\n\"As a mother I am sad he wasn't able to do what he wanted to do. He wanted to inspire young people to be passionate about something and that is what the book is about.\"\n\nAlexander Paul and his mother Joanna Brown\n\nMs Brown said her son excelled at sports, he was a talented footballer who was spotted by Fulham Football Club\u2019s scouts.\n\nHowever, the path of a professional athlete was not the one for the reflective and charismatic young man, who devoured poetry, philosophy and music.\n\nAlexander expressed himself through poetry, filling his local church \u2013 Chatsworth Baptist, in West Norwood \u2013 as he read his work.\n\nAt Warwick University, where he went to study politics, his talent for verse and performance continued. He performed his work at home and abroad, even giving a reading in Amsterdam.\n\nWith dreams of changing the world though politics or connecting people through his poetry, Alexander suddenly collapsed on March 18, 2016. He had a fit and was put into an induced coma, although three days later he was \u201cnormal, fit and healthy\u201d.\n\nAs time and tests progressed it became clear that Alexander had glioblastinoma, a malignant tumour in his brain that would eventually cause his death a year later.\n\n\"He was always a writer and was a early developer,\" said Ms Brown, who works as a family lawyer.\n\nJoanna Brown with young Alexander and his brother Lamar and sister Christine\n\n\"I noticed from the age of about four he liked to read and at five he used to write short stories. He always wanted to learn new words from the dictionary and just loved literacy. He was writing poems from around 13 and just loved writing down his feelings and about life.\n\n\"There was a lot of of poetry about Gypsy Hill and its high percentage of crime and I was unaware of all of this until he passed away.\"\n\nAlexander made a deep impression on some of the most powerful people in the country when he made an impressive speech at a Conservative Party conference when he was just 18.\n\nHe spoke about stop and search and the \u201cstigma\u201d facing black youngsters \u2013 experiences he felt the \u201cinjustice of\u201d growing up as a bright and well-behaved schoolboy in Gipsy Hill.\n\nHis \u201cmagnetic personality\u201d even attracted the attention of former Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as Theresa May.\n\nMs Brown admits her son had the ability to touch people through his work, and believes it has and will continue to inspire those who read it.\n\n\"He realised there was a lot of young men who go through depression,\" she said. \"I could tell he went through a very low period himself and by reading his poems you can see that.\n\n\"He wanted to inspire people. It was really hard to read the poems as I felt the pain and love. It made me sad to think he may have felt like this for a long time.\"\n\nMore than a year has passed since Alexander's death, and Ms Brown admits she still struggles with grief.\n\n\"It's not been a long time and everyone keeps saying 'You are strong and you are brave' but I have thrown myself into the book project to keep busy,\" she said.\n\n\"It's still raw and I don't cry as much now but I do find it really difficult. There was a time where I would go to his graveside every day after his death but now I find it really hard to do that as the reality kicks in of him not being here.\n\n\"But it does feel like he is here because of the book. He is kept alive by the book and it makes me feel quite close to him, giving speeches about it.\n\n\"There are days you get overcome with grief and the sadness comes but I have a lot of support and care around me.\"\n\nMs Brown is holding a poetry event at Thornton Heath Library, on Brigstock Road, between 2.30 and 4.30pm on Wednesday (October 24).\n\nClimbing Clouds Catching Comets can be purchased online at Amazon or Waterstones. It can also be bought at a number of independent book shops around south London.\n\nRead one of Alexander's inspirational poems\n\nSince Alexander's death, many pieces of his work have been published by his mum.\n\nThe one below, called S.O.S: Scared Of Safety, was written in April 2015.\n\nS.O.S: Scared Of Safety\n\nWhy do they want to disgrace me? Do they hate me?\nThey stop and search me, supposedly, \\\nFor my own safety and the safety of others.\nI am not complaining alone because they search my brothers.\nI try not to be like my friends so I don't carry a knife\nBut what I do carry inside is foolish pride which longs for vengeance.\nHowever, if I retaliate with hate they can take my life away or give me a prison sentence.\nI want to strike.\nRevenge plagues my mind.\nThe only thing that stops me\nIs the fact that, freedom is so hard to find\nWhen it seems to hide, as you try to stay alive behind prison walls.\nA couple brothers are not here in attendance\nOn this Earth and that hurts.\nSo for what's it worth we pray for dead soldiers to show remembrance.\n\nI have seen it before, what is happening isn't new and this is true;\nMy mother has shown me the effects that have left our communities sore.\nI'm sure police brutality knows no limits. I fear the possibilities\nThey could put me in a hearse, my mother crying at my funeral for she is cursed,\nForever hurting as she carries the burden of outliving her only son.\nHow many people have been crippled with disabilities?\nDue to police overstepping their responsibilities?\nI fear it's more than one!\nWe will never- we will never know the true answer.\nNo wonder why I seem so miserable, I seldom smile,\nI see them stroll and every time I see them\nThe sense of freedom goes.\n\nLines can be blurred when agendas are just meaningless words.\nThe only difference between the police and criminals is the matter of legitimacy\nAnd although I am afraid of what they both can do,\nI know that only a certain few can get away with murder.\nI have seen many victims of society trapped in coffins that get forgotten by time\nOnly because they were killed by those who are meant to instil order.\nI can only murmur these thoughts of mine; I will never state my frustration\nAs they truly won't listen to a child of my age filled with rage.\nMy fear has taught me,\nIrrespective of the stereotypical view\nGangsters can be legal too.\n\nI have no trust in those that are meant to serve and protect!\nI hate them with a passion that I will surely regret,\nFor there will be a time, very soon\nWhere I will depend on them;\nOn these streets there are liars, cheats and heartless thieves\nAnd anything can happen.\nAnything can happen and I see death around the corner,\nI am ready to call the coroner\n\nI feel guilty before I have even called their line.\nTo them I am a delinquent, a criminal before I have committed any crime.\nI was born a statistic and I was born a threat\nThe multiple murders over the years do not help to defeat this stereotype\nBut they do not care.\nWe fight and die over land we do not own; strangers in our own home.\nWe make their jobs easier by making our lives harder.\nSo please tell me why would they save someone who is intent on dying?",
