I have been seeing a lot of comments saying sheer nude is acceptable.\n\nMiddleton-nude-hosiery.jpgA. My first preference would be to wear no hosiery since the weather is rather mild in September. However, if you are more comfortable in hosiery, you can try black hosiery or even a fashion-forward lace hosiery.\n\nThere is a lot of buzz lately about sheer nude hosiery, especially since Kate and Pippa Middleton have been seen wearing a lot of nude hosiery lately. In fact, according to New York Magazine and WWD , there is an increased demand in nude hose over the past year with an 85% increase in sales in the U.K. and 12% increase in the U.S. \u2014 largely credited to the Middleton sisters. Sarah Jessica Parker, Mischa Barton, and Hayden Panettiere have also been spotted wearing nude hose over the past few months.\n\nThe key to wearing nude hosiery is to find an ultra-sheer style that most closely matches your skin tone.

Our resident expert, The Makeup Diva, answers makeup and skin care questions sent in by readers just like you.\n\nQ: My hair is really wavy so I always wear it up. What styles could make my hair look straighter?\n\nA: Styling products, a round brush, and a blowdryer should be your new best friends if you want your hair straighter. Work a dollop of straightening gel (like my favorite Phytotherathrie Phytodefrisant Hair Straightening Balm $18; available at icon and into lightly towel dried hair, making sure to evenly distribute it and comb it through to the ends. There are many brands out there, but I like Phytotherathrie Phytodefrisant the best because it works and it's not sticky or stiff. Use a round brush, preferably natural bristle (like from, on sections of hair as you are drying. Take sections of hair from the root onto the brush and pull it straight as you aim the blowdryer on the hair (do it quickly so you don't expose the hair to too much heat). The straightening balm needs the heat of the dryer and the tension of the brush to help the hair straighten, so don't expect to just put the balm on and blowdry as usual. The more you use this method of drying your hair, the easier it will become. I style my hair like this every day and it takes only 5-10 minutes.\n\nIn terms of hair style and length, I also have wavy hair and I find that wearing it mostly all one length and medium to long in length, rather than short, helps weigh the hair down and makes it easier to control. Try a cut that is near or just past shoulder length.\n\nFinally, talk to your hairdresser about products and styling that she suggests for you. She knows your hair and can help you work with the texture.\n\nGet Ask The Makeup Diva Delivered to Your E-mail box Every Week!

How do you make your own hair\n\n~ Holly\n\nA: Your very welcome, and...\n\nI developed my own recipes from researching into herbology and basic\n'homemade' body care product recipes. From looking at the results of the\nrecipes and tweaked it to my own standards.\n\n\nA basic shampoo recipe is:\n\n~1\/2 cup of organic castile soap\n~ 10 drops of essential oils (your choice)\n~ 1 cup of water.\n\nI looked at that recipe and realized that it wouldn't have enough base\nor body for my kind of hair. So I researched into different types of\nplants that would give my hair nutrients, body, and keep it\n\nA great research starting point is...\n\n\"Beauty By Nature\" by Brigitte Mars\n\nShe teaches you details about how your body works and techniques on how\nto care for it. She also analyzes different herbs that are good for herbalist beginners (like, general herbs that you can find in grocery stores, local herb shops, etc). And shares some basic recipes.\n\nThe best hair care products that you could ever use, are ones that you make yourself from your own sun-infusing kitchen. Everyone has their own expectations on what a hair or body care product should do.\n\nBut here is another basic recipe:\n\n* Hair food:\n3\/4 cup shea butter\n10 drops of your choice of essential oils\nadd a cup of herbs (of your choice) to infuse into the oil mix. (then drain them before placing mixture in a container.\n\n(Melt butter on the lowest heat, until butter is liquefied. Add in\nessential oil. Then place mix in a container, put in fridge to harden)\n\nAt this time, I am not going to post up my recipes that I have been developing. But if you ever have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\n** Another tip, is to keep your products vegan and chemical-free for better results.\n\nOn a slightly other note...\n\nIf you are in the Seattle Area, in September.

        "text":"Your Hack For Frizz-Free Hair\n\n\nQ1) I have very frizzy long hair which I\u2019m not too happy with. I have been advised keratin treatment by my hair dresser as I don\u2019t want very straight hair. Would this damage my hair?\n\nAns: Keratin as the name suggests is an all-protein treatment. It will infuse protein into the hair cuticle and make the hair approximately fifty per cent straighter than its original texture but will remove the frizz completely giving a smooth and natural finish to your locks. It\u2019s a two-day procedure where keratin is applied on day one and sealed into the hair cuticle with a heated iron. The shampoo and deep conditioning procedure is done after 48 hours to finish the treatment and the home care thereafter is necessary but rather simple comprising of keratin shampoo, mask and argan oil. Keratin is a great technology to tame your mane with a fabulous natural effect but like all good things it does not last forever.\u00a0 You would have to repeat the treatment every six to eight months to maintain the beautiful healthy sheen and texture of your hair.\n\nQ2) My daughter has a few warts around her eyes and on the neck. ls there any cosmetic cure for this?\n\nAns: A dermatologist can remove warts with a very painless procedure and the best part is that there are no permanent marks left behind. A home remedy can work in certain cases where the warts have recently emerged so it is worth a try. Take some castor oil in a bowl and with a cotton bud dab it on the wart twice a day, do this consistently and regularly for a couple of months and soon you will see the wart shrink and fall off.\n\nQ3) The crow\u2019s-feet around my eyes are my problem, I do use a moisturiser regularly but these seem to get deeper day by day. Is there any solution?\n\nAns: Crow\u2019s-feet are a natural part of ageing and growing up. Many young people also have this problem, maybe due to excessive laughing or smiling so it shouldn\u2019t worry you too much. Keeping your skin hydrated and moisturised well, will give a smoother appearance to these lines so a good moisturiser and drinking plenty of water as a regular routine is excellent. Using a heavy moisturiser daily and applying under-eye cream both in the morning and night is a habit that will help enormously. A sea-weed eye mask especially formulated for undereyes should be applied for ten minutes daily around the eyes with an extra dab on the crow\u2019s-feet. Another trick to tackle this can be done with makeup where you can apply blusher tactfully more on your cheeks and not on the crow\u2019s feet to avoid emphasis on them thus taking away attention from the crow\u2019s feet which then will not be too prominent.\n\n\nFor more beauty questions and make up tips, click here.\nPrevious articleAnalysing Indo-China Air Power\nNext articleVistara Ramps Up New Services To Sharjah With Flights From Jan 20th\nRashmi Kapur Abrol has been in the beauty industry for the last 37 years, a columnist to the Times of India, official make-up therapist to the Miss World contestants and a soft skills trainer for Leading Hotels in the country and abroad.\n\n\nComments are closed.",
