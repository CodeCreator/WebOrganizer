        "text":"Your Hack For Frizz-Free Hair\n\n\nQ1) I have very frizzy long hair which I\u2019m not too happy with. I have been advised keratin treatment by my hair dresser as I don\u2019t want very straight hair. Would this damage my hair?\n\nAns: Keratin as the name suggests is an all-protein treatment. It will infuse protein into the hair cuticle and make the hair approximately fifty per cent straighter than its original texture but will remove the frizz completely giving a smooth and natural finish to your locks. It\u2019s a two-day procedure where keratin is applied on day one and sealed into the hair cuticle with a heated iron. The shampoo and deep conditioning procedure is done after 48 hours to finish the treatment and the home care thereafter is necessary but rather simple comprising of keratin shampoo, mask and argan oil. Keratin is a great technology to tame your mane with a fabulous natural effect but like all good things it does not last forever.\u00a0 You would have to repeat the treatment every six to eight months to maintain the beautiful healthy sheen and texture of your hair.\n\nQ2) My daughter has a few warts around her eyes and on the neck. ls there any cosmetic cure for this?\n\nAns: A dermatologist can remove warts with a very painless procedure and the best part is that there are no permanent marks left behind. A home remedy can work in certain cases where the warts have recently emerged so it is worth a try. Take some castor oil in a bowl and with a cotton bud dab it on the wart twice a day, do this consistently and regularly for a couple of months and soon you will see the wart shrink and fall off.\n\nQ3) The crow\u2019s-feet around my eyes are my problem, I do use a moisturiser regularly but these seem to get deeper day by day. Is there any solution?\n\nAns: Crow\u2019s-feet are a natural part of ageing and growing up. Many young people also have this problem, maybe due to excessive laughing or smiling so it shouldn\u2019t worry you too much. Keeping your skin hydrated and moisturised well, will give a smoother appearance to these lines so a good moisturiser and drinking plenty of water as a regular routine is excellent. Using a heavy moisturiser daily and applying under-eye cream both in the morning and night is a habit that will help enormously. A sea-weed eye mask especially formulated for undereyes should be applied for ten minutes daily around the eyes with an extra dab on the crow\u2019s-feet. Another trick to tackle this can be done with makeup where you can apply blusher tactfully more on your cheeks and not on the crow\u2019s feet to avoid emphasis on them thus taking away attention from the crow\u2019s feet which then will not be too prominent.\n\n\nFor more beauty questions and make up tips, click here.\nPrevious articleAnalysing Indo-China Air Power\nNext articleVistara Ramps Up New Services To Sharjah With Flights From Jan 20th\nRashmi Kapur Abrol has been in the beauty industry for the last 37 years, a columnist to the Times of India, official make-up therapist to the Miss World contestants and a soft skills trainer for Leading Hotels in the country and abroad.\n\n\nComments are closed.",

        "text":"Q: My daughter is 20, a college junior, and soon will be interviewing for internships in the medical field. She's about 5 feet tall, 100 pounds with fine bone structure, gold blond hair and big blue eyes. What should she wear to interviews that would make her look age-appropriate.\n\nSo far, everything she's tried either makes her look too juvenile or like a little girl playing dress-up in her mother's clothes. (She likes to wear boots, dresses, or jeans and sweaters, no ruffles, lace or pink.)\n\n\nTeri Agins describes the perfect interview outfit for a 20-something go-getter. Margarete Gockel\n\nA: Your daughter sounds lovely. She should channel actress Hope Lange in the 1959 drama, \"The Best of Everything,\" who played a delicate, ambitious blonde, straight out of Vassar, who began her career at a book publisher. Ignore the dated, white-glove fashions from that era. Ms. Lange's timeless sophistication had less to do what she wore and more to do with her mannerisms, including perfect posture, eye contact and a low-pitched voice, without chatter or giggles.\n\nYour daughter's clothes should play up her petite size, while making her look polished and grown-up preppy, like the models in Ralph Lauren ads. She can go for shorter (not mini) dresses and fitted clothes, including straight skirts and hip-stitch pleats. Or not-too tight skinny pants. What will give her interview gravitas: a well-cut, cropped jacket (perhaps a trendy motorcycle-style jacket in fabric or leather) over a fitted, boat-neck sweater or crisp shirt.\n\nI like her in black boots, flat or with heels, and always with black tights, to give her the taller, unbroken line. Her best colors: camel, navy, aubergine, dusty gray, as well as dark, small prints, such as leopard. Along with pink, she should ditch the other pastel shades and the debutante pearls.\n\nThe ideal business handbag is a midsize satchel with a top handle, or flat leather shopper-style tote. No collegiate backpacks or shoulder bags.\n\nHer hairdo is decidedly controlled and stays put. It could be a layered, shoulder grazing style, side parted. Or longer hair in a casual updo. When she's outdoors, sunglasses will impart an urbane edge.\n\nWrite to Teri Agins at askteri@wsj.com",

Over the summer of 2008, he served as an intern at VOGUE magazine, and this fall he can be seen in Gap ads on billboards across the country.

We have to wear suits to all our games, and last night I rocked this look and have to say I really liked it. There's something very nerdy and cool about it all in one.\n\n\nI recently read an article on about overcoats and such. And I did buy one. However, I have a question about the cuff labels. Are you supposed to remove them? I wanna make sure before I potentially damage the coat.\n\n-James H\n\nSo fellas, when you a buy a new overcoat and the sleeves have the designer label stitched onto it, you are supposed to remove it. I could tell you to remove it yourself, but ask the store or take it to a tailor.\n\nShould shirts (including T-shirts) be tucked into jeans?\u00a0 I have seen loads of other guys do this, and it looks loads better than having the shirt out loose. However, I am unsure of how baggy or fitted the jeans\/shirts should be and of what belt to wear to match. I think I am OK with tucking shirts into formal pants but please give some general tips on both.\u00a0\n\n\nI happen to really like shirts that are tucked into jeans. I don't, however, like T-shirts tucked in \u2014 there is something about it being OK when the shirt has a collar. I tend to wear a collared shirt tucked into jeans, and try to add a vest so it\u2019s not so obvious. Whatever you decide on, tucked or untucked, make sure that if you untuck, the shirt is hemmed so that you can see the pockets on your pants\/jeans.\n\nI want to buy a new winter jacket this year, but I\u2019m wondering if I should go for a something like a wool peacoat or if one of those puffy down-filled parkas is a better bet. It gets pretty cold where I live, so I\u2019m as concerned with function as I am with fashion. Please advise!\n\n-Northern Joe\n\nOn the case of deciding between a peacoat and down-filled parka, I guess it really comes down to how cold your climate is. A peacoat is more a fashion piece than a down-filled parka. The Moncler parkas are very warm and fashionable if worn right. I also feel the peacoat is on its way out.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a cologne\u2026 ideally something that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cteenage boy\u201d and that\u2019s subtle enough not to overpower my whole office. Any suggestions?\n\nThe cologne to buy right now is Bois Rouge by Tom Ford, but I will be honest \u2014 I wear my Old Spice aftershave as cologne more than the fancy stuff.

However, if you are more comfortable in hosiery, you can try black hosiery or even a fashion-forward lace hosiery.\n\nThere is a lot of buzz lately about sheer nude hosiery, especially since Kate and Pippa Middleton have been seen wearing a lot of nude hosiery lately. In fact, according to New York Magazine and WWD , there is an increased demand in nude hose over the past year with an 85% increase in sales in the U.K. and 12% increase in the U.S. \u2014 largely credited to the Middleton sisters. Sarah Jessica Parker, Mischa Barton, and Hayden Panettiere have also been spotted wearing nude hose over the past few months.\n\nThe key to wearing nude hosiery is to find an ultra-sheer style that most closely matches your skin tone.

        "text":"Guys Wearing Leggings?\n\nI get up at 5am everyday and have a dance class at 6:30 at college, pre my girlfriend asking me to take one. So since its a dance class I have to wear \"active\" clothes that are light and don't keep warm at all.. For the last week I have been trying to find a way to keep warm that early, I kept my mind open when out with friends and family and came to a thought yesterday. I decided to go to the store and buy a per of Leggings. While Its strange no doubt about it, It doesn't seem too bad in my opinion since I got them to keep warm not to be \"fashionable\" and will always have them under some type of other pants. All my friends think I am stupid for this but honestly, I find them rather comfortable. Is it well \"wrong\" that I wear them or are my friends just being immature.\n\nNote: all my friends that say that are girls, I don't have many guy friends.\n\n\nMost Helpful Girl\n\n  \u2022 i wouldn't worry about it,\n\n    there are many social norm exceptions.\n\n    we're raised in a culture where it's not\n\n    exactly acceptable for males to wear\n\n    what is classified as 'female' clothing.\n\n    it's like males aren't \"suppose\" to shave\n\n    their legs, but it's completely appropriate\n\n    when they're swimmers.\n\n    & guys straight males 'don't' touch other\n\n    straight males on the butt, but it's acceptable\n\n    when playing american football.\n\n    they're being used for a purpose,\n\n    it's not like you're creeping THAT\n\n    far out of your gender\/sexual norm.\n\n    wear them, be warm & don't listen to the others.\n\n    \u2022 That, is a beautiful, beautiful poem. Made me cry. :p. Great answer though ^^. I'd say exactly that but just would like to add that people WILL make fun, but don't listen to them because they ARE being immature and people wouldn't really care if they were mature about it, although some girls might be turned off because attraction can't be rationalised, so just bear that in mind. :)\n\n    \u2022 Show All\n    \u2022 Very good.\n\n      although it doesn't look like a poem to me? It doesn't rhyme at all, just looks like someone who pressed enter mid way through their sentences.\n\n    \u2022 Excellent There. That's pretty much how I was rationalizing it in my head. Thanks for reinforcing that theory :D\n\nHave an opinion?\n\n\nSend It!\n\nWhat Girls Said 6\n\n  \u2022 people tease to hide the fact that they aren't comfortable with their own sexuality. do what you want, and don't mind what others think! you know who you are.\n\n  \u2022 Well leggings *are* very comfortable, I don't blame you. I don't think you could get away with wearing them on their own, though. Not against androgynous guys or anything, it'll just be a challenge to hide 'dat bulge'. xD\n\n  \u2022 ur gunna come off as a homosexual if you announce that you wear leggings but if you want to then that's your biz. plus you got a girl so that should dispel the rumors. who cares? you know why your wearing leggings so f what people might say\n\n  \u2022 just wear some shorts over them or somethin\n\n  \u2022 go for it. do what you feel is comfortable\n\n  \u2022 It could be a little odd. But I see guys running in leggings all the time and I think it's fine. With them under another pair of pants, you should be fine. So, ignore your friends... just make sure the leggings are black :) By the way, have fun at the dance class! :)\n\n    \u2022 Yah, there black sadly they only had my size with zippers on the side haha. and I am having some fun. I was thinking go on that new dance show with Paula Abdul after I get good, ha!\n\n    \u2022 Where do you live? San Fransisco? Or the French Quarter? HAHAHAHAHA, OMG I didn't know TRANSVESTITES were that COMMON...\n\n    \u2022 Actually, no. I live in a running, college town. They're long spandex. It doesn't make you a transvestite. QA: god luck :) haha\n\nWhat Guys Said 2\n\n  \u2022 Why not buy a pair of long johns?\n\n  \u2022 ehh don't wear leggings",

I live across the street from a sallys beauty supply so i can get whta i need and money is no object :] thankss Yea that was helpfull but just a tiny bit confuseing~ okay not a tiny bit but alot of a bit lol\n\n\n\nmonmon says:\n\nPosted on 15 Jun 2009\n\nThings You'll NeedBW2 Clairol Bleaching Powder. This is the best one to use on dark hair.\n\nGoldwell 10p toner.\n\nArdell Lock in Blonde.\n\n30 Volume Creme Developer. It has to be the creamy white one, not the clear liquid one.\n\nHair coloring brush. It's a plastic 2 inch wide paint brush to dip and spread the bleach on your hair. Easily found at Sallys.\n\nHair blow Dryer\n\nProtective Eye Goggles\n\nShimmer Lights Shampoo for blonde and silver hair. It's basically a purple shampoo to tone your hair. Get a regular deep conditioner too like Pantene.\n\nPlastic or glass mixing bowl. NO METAL mixing bowls!\n\nClear or white grocery bag. It can't be a color bag or else your hair will take the color of the bag.\n\nAlternate Method-[edit] TipsCondition, Condition, Condition.\n\nI would also buy a hair serum\/polisher to add to my dry blond hair.\n\nMy favorite is Fantasia IC hair polisher. Costs about 5 dollars at any\n\nWalgreens, Sallys, or Rickys. It will make your hair GORGEOUS!\n\nAlso, buy another hair dye, a darker one, or the same as your previous hair colour. That way, if it turns out bad, you can return to the same colour.\n\nPour 3 ounces of creme developer into plastic mixing bowl along with 2 scoops of bleaching powder in a room with windows. This stuff is not healthy to breathe in a closed up room!\n\nPut on your Goggles. DO NOT forget the goggles, or if you have eyeglasses, add tape around them to protect your eyes.\n\nCommence mixing the bleach and developer mixture.\n\nPart your hair in 4 sections. Start at the back and DO NOT start at your roots or else you will come out with lighter roots and darker ends.\n\nAdd bleach all over your head, keeping 1 1\/2 inches away from your roots.\n\nPut the clear or white plastic bag over your head and tie it at the nape of your neck making sure all of your hair is tucked underneath the bag.\n\nLeave it like this for 40 minutes.\n\nAfter 40 min. make a hole in the bag large enough to fit the nozzle of your hair blow dryer and begin blowing hot air into the plastic bag. What we are doing here is activating the bleaching process by adding heat. #Keep blowing hot air for 10 or so minutes.\n\nDo not do the roots yet. After about an hour or so shampoo your hair with the shimmer lights toning shampoo and then DEEP condition it with Pantene hair conditioner.\n\nWash out and blow dry COMPLETELY.\n\nRepeat the process of adding bleach to your hair, heating with hot air, washing\/conditioning it, blowdrying again. Do this 6 times. This is a very painful process because now you will be doing your roots and it will sting.\n\nOn the 2nd repeat, do your root and say OUCH!\n\nNOTE: You do not want to leave bleach on your hair for over an hour. You will destroy your hair and you will not get dates. This is why you must repeat this process 6 times or until your hair is a deep blonde. ALWAYS condition in between! The goal for today is not to get it platinum blonde. Marylin Monroe was not born platinum blonde, silly. It took her time too! You want to go deep blonde because if you have black hair, you need to give it time to heal as well as your scalp for heavens sake!\n\nOk, so wait 24 hrs. or more. Your hair should now be a deep blonde or a reddish tone.\n\nNow, do some more bleaching, and heating until you get to your desired color blonde or platinum.\n\nWait another day before adding the toner.\n\nPUT GOGGLES ON...After 24hrs. or more, mix toner in plastic container with 30 volume creme developer (read directions on toner). Depending on how golden or platinum you want to be, add drops of Ardell's \"Lock in Blonde\". The more you add, the more golden blonde your hair will be. If you pass this, that's fine. Your hair will not be as crispy blonde. I personally like to add about 18 drops to give my hair a bit of color\/golden platinum feel to it.\n\nAfter 40 minutes,(read directions on toner) wash, condition and dry.\n\nWelcome to the club...You are now a bonafide blonde bombshell!!!\n\nI hope this help!\n\n\nbarbipixi says:\n\nPosted on 15 Jun 2009\n\nbleach is very dangerous so of course it'll be a bit confusing if you do it right.\n\n\nbarbipixi says:\n\nPosted on 15 Jun 2009\n\nbleach is very dangerous so of course it'll be a bit confusing if you do it right.\n\n\nkelly_goo says:\n\nPosted on 15 Jun 2009\n\nbest tip,\n\n\niv had bleach blond for ages now and its fucked my hair up big time\n\ni still have a chemical burn on my scalp from the first time :|\n\ngo to the salon tbh\n\n\namaay says:\n\nPosted on 15 Jun 2009\n\ni'd suggest you go to the salon, as they're professionals and know what they're doing. :]\n\n\n\ndominique says:\n\nPosted on 15 Jun 2009\n\nif u want to do it urself i would recommend the Beyond the zone bleaching kit. u can get it at sallys or prolly any beauty supply stores.\n\n\nxxmonotone says:\n\nPosted on 16 Jun 2009\n\nokay well i think its fine for you to do it yourself, you dont need to go pay a lot at a salon like most people suggest.\n\ni bleached my own hair for a while and have had it really really white before. i used bw bleach, it comes in a pretty big container so it will last you, use 40 volume developer. bleach it in layers to make sure you get all your hair, it would also be good to have somebody with you so they can check the back of your head to see if you got it all. leave it on for an hour to an hour and a half. shampoo it then once you rinse the shampoo put shimmer lights shampoo or the generic brand they sell at sallys(its a toner shampoo that gets rid of yellow if you get the purple kind or gets rid of orange if you get the blue kind) in your hair for like 5 minutes then rinse. it might have a little yellow and if you want it lighter then bleach it again in like a week or so, just dont leave it on as long and it will get white.\n\npeople are always scared their hair will break off but honestly hair is a lot stronger than people think!\n\nLogin To Answer",

        "text":"Hello Colm,\n\nI have been colouring my hair at home for many years, usually using a medium to dark brown as I\u2019ve always had a dark base. I\u2019m in my early 50\u2019s, so I have plenty of grey hair but the ends are black. I would like a nice warm brown. Can this be achieved?\n\nMary, City Centre\n\nHi Mary,\n\nYou obviously have a build up of home colour which is resulting in black ends. The first step would be to have this professionally lightened out, which involves using a colour remover and should only be done in a salon. Then I would use a warm brown shade from INOA Supreme from L\u2019Oreal Professional. This fantastic range of colour is specifically designed for people with 70% to 100% grey\/white hair.\n\nIts multi-tonal, which means the tones used are much softer and complimentary to ageing skin. This is probably a good time to have a look at the make-up you are wearing to see will it suit your new shade.\n\nAs the tones are softer, your regrowth can be a little less obvious also. INOA Supreme also contains a magic ingredient called Densilium R, which conditions your hair while also helping to create density and volume in limp, ageing hair. There is also home care called Age Supreme available in salon to manage that salon shine between visits.\n\nKeep your questions coming to colm@colmmorrissey.com\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
