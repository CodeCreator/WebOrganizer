        "text":"What is Cardio inCode\u00ae and how can it help reduce your cardiovascular risk?\n\n  \u2022 Do you have cardiovascular risk factors (high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, etc.) that may increase your chances of cardiovascular disease or a heart attack?\n  \u2022 Are you concerned that you might have heart attack symptoms ?\n  \u2022 Would you like to take control of your future health and any required medical prevention plan?\n  \u2022 Would you like to know your genetic predisposition towards having a heart attack?\n\nIf you answered YES to any of the above questions, you should be aware that 50% of the likelihood of suffering heart attack (myocardial infarction) depends on your genetics.\n\nIf you would like to gain a detailed risk and insight to whether you may suffer a heart attack, it is\u00a0essential to evaluate your genetics.\n\nClassic\u00a0cardiovascular risk factors such as age, smoking and eating habits are not sufficient on their own, as they only contribute by 50% of the likelihood of developing a severe cardiovascular problem. That is why it is necessary to combine information from both categories to accurately assess your level of risk.\n\nCardio incode test\n\nWith Cardio inCode\u00ae you can begin to understand your own genetics and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease!\n\n\nCardio inCode Score\u00ae is a patented genetic test validated in over 80,000 patients that analyses the 12 most important genetic variants in your DNA related to cardiovascular risk.\n\nCardio inCode\u00ae enables you to understand your true risk of suffering a heart attack empowering you to adopt cardiovascular prevention steps to reduce your risk of a cardiovascular event.\n\nCardio inCode\u00ae Check also informs on your predisposition to developing classical cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, hypertension, or diabetes in addition to advising on cardiovascular prevention measures and treatment pathways appropriate to your level of risk. Cardio inCode Check\u00ae analyses up to 158 genetic variants in your DNA.\n\nAs cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, priority should be given to the steps required to reduce your risk factors and in order to help improve your future health and lifestyle.\n\n\nCarrying Out A Cardio inCode\u00ae Test\n\nWith the help of your physician, you can easily carry out a Cardio inCode\u00ae test, following these steps:\n\n  \u2022 Order\n\n    Your physician orders the test and then receives our DNA collection kit\n\n  \u2022 Sample\n\n    A sample of your blood or saliva (mouth swab) is taken\n\n  \u2022 Analysis\n\n    The sample is analysed in our laboratory\n\n  \u2022 Results\n\n    We send the encrypted results to your physician, who will discuss the results and the next steps with you\n\nWhat are Cardio inCode cardiovascular prevention test users saying?\n\nThousands of individuals have already benefited from the Cardio inCode genetic test to reduce the risk of suffering a heart attack, and their cardiovascular risk in general.\n\n  \u2022 Dr. Romero\n    Dr. Romero Head of the Lipids Unit at Hospital Infanta Elena, Huelva.\n\n    \u201cEarly diagnosis of FH is essential to change the natural history of the disease, since it\u2019s genetic, and present from birth. It goes undetected through the first decades of life, and in many cases, is only diagnosed after an episode of cardiovascular disease. Genetic testing of individuals with suspected diagnoses and their family members gives us a head start of more than a decade over the natural course of events.\n    In our Lipids and Vascular Risk Unit, it has become an indispensable tool.\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Dr. Pedro Royo\n    Dr. Pedro Royo IVI RMA Pamplona\n\n    \u201cThrombo inCode is a product that\u2019s extremely useful in reproductive medicine. For patients who suffer implantation failure, recurrent pregnancy loss or those with backgrounds of thrombotic episodes, it provides information that is extremely useful in their clinical management, both for ovarian stimulation and preparation of embryo transfer.\u201d\n\n  \u2022 Dr. Joaqu\u00edn Garcia Ezquerro\n    Dr. Joaqu\u00edn Garcia Ezquerro CASA DE SALUD HOSPITAL.

Staffed by top-tier scientific professionals, they are forerunners in research at the national and international levels.\n\n\nCardio inCode\u00ae is backed by extensive scientific evidence. A sample of the publications:\n\nThese studies showthat the genetic risk score of Cardio inCode\u00ae\u00a0is associated with the risk of presenting a coronary accident. Therefore, the higher the genetic score, the greater the coronary risk. This way, genetics enables us to identify those individuals with coronary risk higher than it would be based only on their classical risk factors.\n\nFeatured In\n\nFor More Information\n\nComplete the following form, and we will contact you soon to provide more information, without any obligation on your part.\n\n    GENinCode shall respond to requests for information, products and \/ or services and registration to events, as well as send commercial and legal communications deemed appropriate to the client.

I have been a customer for several years and to date have no complains.\nDate published: 2016-04-25\nRated 5 out of 5 by from Good vitamins This product supplements the vitamins I take on a daily basis. The Puritan's Pride quality has always been good so I believe these vitamins are good value.\nDate published: 2015-04-23\nRated 5 out of 5 by from No more issues with this product like in the older reviews When I first bought this product many years ago I had the same issue as the older reviews where the caplets would crumble\/disintegrate after a little bit of time but that's not happening anymore with the more recent shipments. I'm not sure if it was humidity or some other factor that caused the issue but Puritan has addressed it. It's definitely a great value compared to the same product (L-Carnitine Tartrate) on other sites and works well for me. Also don't get this product confused with L-Carnitine Fumarate which is a different type of L-Carnitine.\nDate published: 2015-03-18\nRated 5 out of 5 by from Excellent products Great product and value! I highly recommend you to everyone I know.\nDate published: 2015-02-18\nRated 1 out of 5 by from Product should be good, quality poor from Puritan Pride I have the same issue as other customers. I have to throw away 2 bottles that I bought becuase it became as powder. I can't use the pills.\nDate published: 2015-01-20\nRated 5 out of 5 by from Excellent product I Have purchased L-Carnitine 500 mg mant times and I have always been very happy with it. Great product great price - great service\nDate published: 2014-10-10\nRated 5 out of 5 by from Bag it!! this is a great product, however humidity will affect the coating after opening the bottle. I found that storing the bottles in a ZipLock bag & I saved a few of the silica-gel pax that are in the bottles & placed them in the bag as well & have never had a meltdown issue...just a tip to save from loss of pills & $$.\nDate published: 2014-09-09\nRated 1 out of 5 by from Threw them all away!!! \/ Puritan Please put this product in a sealed capsul I have probably bought thousands of vitamins from Puritans pride, and have been satisfied with them all, except this product. I have had multiple shipments (batches) of this product over the years, and every shipment has been defective. All the bottles had exploded powdery messes in them, not capsules. The almost unrecognizable capsules were UN-usable and UN-swallowable. Even when the bottle is first opened, a single pill could not be removed without crumbling to dust in your fingers. Puritan L-Carnitine Tablets disintegrate in their factory sealed bottles. I you want L-Carnitine, buy it in liquid, or buy from a different supplier. I rate this product is so defective that it is useless. I hope Puritan will fix this product, protect the pills with a coating or capsule, and announce the product is fixed.\nDate published: 2014-05-26\n  \u2022 y_2020, m_8, d_4, h_15\n  \u2022 bvseo_bulk, prod_bvrr, vn_bulk_3.0.10\n  \u2022 cp_1, bvpage1\n  \u2022 co_hasreviews, tv_5, tr_13\n  \u2022 loc_en_US, sid_016830, prod, sort_[SortEntry(order=SUBMISSION_TIME, direction=DESCENDING)]\n  \u2022 clientName_puritanspride\n  \u2022 bvseo_sdk, net_sdk,\n  \u2022 CLOUD, getReviews, 11ms",

Between stressful days at work where time is spent sitting for hours and the daily wear and tear that we experience in our personal lives, it goes without saying that our muscles are tense more than they are relaxed. Massage therapy is known for it\u2019s ability to release tension and bring about a sense of relaxation. However, for muscles that hold lots of tension or require a deeper technique, we recommend a hot stone massage.\n\nA hot stone massage incorporates warm, smooth stones into the standard massage method. These stones act as an extension to the therapy provided by the massage therapist, in fact, the heat of the stone not only increases levels of relaxation, but they also loosen up the muscles allowing for the massage therapist to work deeply and release more tension. The stones used in hot stone massage are also great for increasing levels of energy throughout your body, so it\u2019s not unheard of to place them along the spine, in your hands or on the muscles that are especially tense.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a massage that gets deep into the tension that your muscles are holding, a hot stone massage is one of the best options! At Skin to Soul, you can count on the trained massage therapists to provide you with an enjoyable massage that will leave you feeling relaxed and relieved.

The skin is prepared and a solution, called Levulan, is topically applied to the skin. It is left on the skin for an incubation period. The solution is absorbed by the targeted lesions and a light then activates the solution which destroys the targeted cells. When used in conjunction with the blue light we can target the sebaceous glands and bacteria responsible for acne\n\nThe treatment takes approximately 60-90 minutes to complete and you can expect some redness, peeling and flaking of the skin for 3-4 days. While under the light source you will feel some warmth. It is important to know that you will need to stay indoors for 24 hours following the procedure. The solution applied to your skin remains active for this period of time.\n\nPhoto of Acne before\n\nAcne Before\n\nPhoto of Treatment with PDT\n\nTreatment with PDT\n\nPhoto of Acne After\n\nAcne After\n\nIf you are struggling with acne you must look at this new and exciting procedure offered to our Waterdown clients.

        "text":"Arne Gundersen, D.D.S. -  - Cosmetic Dentist\n\nGundersen Dental Care\n\nArne Gundersen, D.D.S.\n\nCosmetic Dentist & General Dentist located in Tumwater, WA\n\nVeneers Specialist\nVeneers are a popular dental tool that can be used to correct abnormalities and defects in the teeth. They can dramatically improve a person's smile, giving them more self-confidence and a renewed sense of well-being. At Gundersen Dental Care, Dr. Arne Gundersen and his staff offer veneers to his patients whose teeth are discolored or have structural abnormalities. He goes to great lengths to make sure his patients living in the Tumwater, Washington area and the surrounding communities including Olympia and Lacey, Washington, have bright smiles and the best dental care possible.\n\nVeneers Q & A\n\nWhat is a veneer?\n\nCosmetic dental veneers solve problems other dental treatments can\u2019t. A veneer is a thin piece of porcelain that is used to cover the surface of an existing tooth. They are made of a high-grade porcelain to look and feel just like a real tooth. They are formed to be the same size, shape, and color as other nearby teeth. This allows the mouth to look uniform and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nOnce the veneers are created in the proper size, shape, and color, Dr. Gundersen will prepare to permanently affix them to the surface of your teeth with a strong bonding agent. He will gently sand away your enamel to roughen the surface of your teeth. Once the veneer is bonded to the tooth, Dr. Gundersen will perform any cleaning or trimming necessary to complete the process.\n\nHow long does a veneer last?\n\nVeneers can last up to 15 years with good dental care. Once you have veneers you should avoid chewing on hard things like ice or hard candies.\n\nVeneers are permanently attached to the surface of your teeth and will need to be upgraded eventually. If a veneer becomes chipped or damaged in any way, Dr. Gundersen will remove it and replace it with a new one.\n\nVeneers are also considered to be permanent due to the fact that the abnormalities that they cover are ones that cannot be changed or altered unless your tooth is extracted. Smaller than normal teeth or ones that have been broken may not be able to be corrected due to the extent of the damage. Veneers create the look of a brand new tooth while using your old tooth as a foundation.\n\nWhat kind of issues can veneers correct?\n\nVeneers can correct several structural abnormalities, as well as various types of damage to your teeth. A few of the most common uses are:\n\n  \u2022 Teeth that are smaller than normal\n  \u2022 Broken or chipped teeth\n  \u2022 Discolored teeth\n  \u2022 Teeth that have an abnormal shape or that didn't form correctly\n  \u2022 Gaps and spaces between the teeth.\n\nA veneer can extend off of the tooth, closing small gaps and spaces that may not be able to be corrected through the use of conventional braces. This creates a more uniform appearance and makes your smile more visually appealing.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about the benefits of veneers and what options are available, you can make an appointment with Dr. Gundersen to learn how veneers can help you.\n\nAsk us\n\nFeel free to email us regarding any scheduling or general questions!\n\nFollow Us",

Good place!\n\nJason Barlow, 12 months ago\n\nCollin Coble, 1 year ago\n\nDFI is a great community resource! The therapists there are all either graduate students in their second year of their counseling programs or professionals in the field (as I was when I attended the program) who are seeking out further training in couples and family therapy. Individual therapy is also provided. All the therapists you would see are being taught courses and getting supervision from seasoned therapists and professors in the community. Sessions are provided at reduced rates because you are being seen by a therapist \"in training.\" Make no mistake about \"in training,\" as you are going to get high quality therapy services at DFI because all the therapists there are spending years of their time and money for this experience because they want to be as good as they can be at what they do.\n\nScott Kohner, 1 year ago\n\nMy daughter was 10 when the walls of life started falling in around her.

        "text":"Sedation Dentistry in Ascutney, VT 05030\n\nWhile most patients have a comfortable experience in our practice using only local anesthetic, for others even thinking about dental visits is stressful or traumatic.\n\nWith that in mind we\u2019ve done everything we can to make your visit to our office as comfortable as possible. \u00a0Beyond our many patient amenities, an additional offering we feature for very anxious patients (and sometimes just for long appointments) is oral sedation.\n\nOral sedation\u00a0Ascutney, VT 05030 involves taking a short course of medication (which is started either the night before or an hour before the appointment) that allows you to relax and in a sense \u201czone out\u201d for your visit. \u00a0Some patients who are typically fearful end up even falling asleep while we work and we gently wake them when we are through.\n\nIf this sounds like an option you\u2019d like, please mention it when you schedule your next appointment. \u00a0We will work with you (and your primary care physician, if necessary) to ensure that you have the safest, most comfortable experience possible!\n\nWays to Relieve Anxiety\n\nOral Sedation Ascutney, VT 05030\u00a0\u2014 Oral sedation (given by mouth) is a popular option for many people precisely because it does not require the use of needles. Oral sedatives are either swallowed whole in pill form or can be dissolved under the tongue. Both methods work in a matter of minutes. A variety of oral sedative and anxiolytic (anxiety-dissolving) medications have been developed through extensive research and testing to make your experience of dental treatment as comfortable and relaxing as possible. All have long safety records after decades of use, and several even have \u201camnesic\u201d properties, meaning you will remember little to nothing, even though you are conscious throughout the treatment. Commonly prescribed medications include Valium\u00ae, Halcion\u00ae, Sonata\u00ae, Ativan\u00ae, Vistaril\u00ae, and Versed\u00ae. To learn more, view our chart on\u00a0Types of Oral Sedatives\n\nInhalation Conscious Sedation\u00a0\u2014 Nitrous oxide, a sedative you inhale, has been used in dental offices for nearly 100 years. It is a relatively poor pain reliever but a very good anti-anxiety medication. It is administered through a nasal hood, which resembles a small cup that is placed over your nose. The oxygen mixed with nitrous oxide provides a light-headed or even euphoric feeling, which is quick to wear off so there is no \u201changover\u201d effect. All bodily functions remain essentially normal during the use of this sedative, which is very safe.\n\nIV Conscious Sedation\u00a0Ascutney, VT 05030 \u2014 Sedatives delivered directly into the bloodstream intravenously (into the vein) are more potent than when taken orally, and the amnesic effects may be more profound. Because IV sedation has an almost immediate effect on the body and its functions \u2014 including heart rate, blood pressure and breathing \u2014 there is a higher degree of risk associated with it than with other types of sedatives. There is also a higher level of training required for those who administer it. As with all sedation (except nitrous oxide), you must be monitored with specialized equipment throughout your IV sedation treatment. The main advantage is that drugs administered this way work immediately and the level of sedation can be adjusted more quickly and easily. And with most sedatives, you won\u2019t remember a thing about your dental procedure after the sedative wears off.\n\nPeople also ask\n\nAscutney-VT-05030-Sleep Dentist-Nitrous Oxide Dental Provider\nCornish-NH-03745-Sleep Dentist-Nitrous Oxide Dental Provider\nWindsor-VT-05089-Sleep Dentist-Nitrous Oxide Dental Provider\nPlainfield-NH-03781-Sleep Dentist-Laughing Gas Dentist\nCavendish-VT-05142-Sedation Dentistry-Nitrous Oxide Dental Provider\nSpringfield-VT-05156-Sleep Dentist-Laughing Gas Dentist\nReading-VT-05062-Sedation Dentistry-Laughing Gas Dentist\nMeriden-NH-03770-Sedation Dentistry-Nitrous Oxide Dental Provider\nCharlestown-NH-03603-Sleep Dentist-Laughing Gas Dentist\nClaremont-NH-03743-Sedation Dentistry-Laughing Gas Dentist",

        "text":"VigRX Plus Review \u2013 What Does It Have to Offer?\n\nThis VigRX Plus review is not aimed at cajoling you to buy this pill. Our focus is simply to provide an unbiased review of this male enhancement pill to help end users like you. Just like every drug, this pill has a downside. Other details that will form part of this review are where to buy the original pill, how to use it, how long it takes to work, undiluted customer reviews, the side effects if any and so on.\n\nWhat is VigRX Plus?\n\nVigRX Plus is a male enhancement supplement that claims to enhance sexual performance in men. It is believed to be made from natural ingredients that increase sexual urge. It was introduced into the market in 2001.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the ingredients.\n\n\nVigRx Plus active ingredientsThis pill is formulated with 9 natural herbs that are known to stimulate sexual appetite. These ingredients are natural herbs that help to relax the muscle and increase the amount of blood flowing to the penis. VigRX Plus contains testosterone boosters.\n\n  1. Epimedium \u2013 studies have shown that Epimedium has similar qualities like Viagra. Epimedium is a very strong PDE-5 inhibitor. This inhibitor helps the blood to circulate more to the penis.\n  2. Damiana Extract \u2013 this ingredient has been around since time immemorial. It helps in improving the supply of oxygen and blood to your nerve impulses. It also helps men suffering from diabetes fix their erection issues.\n  3. Hawthorn Berry \u2013 it contains antioxidants that prolong your erection. It has some quantity of Bioflavonoids that stimulate an increase in blood circulation to the penis.\n  4. Muira Puma \u2013 tribes in Brazil have been using Muira Puma for years to improve erection. It contains basic elements that will enhance your sexual vibes.\n  5. Asian Red Ginseng \u2013 this ingredient needs no introduction. It was discovered an aphrodisiac as far back as 3500 BC in China by Emperor Shen-Nung.\n  6. Ginkgo Biloba \u2013 it is a natural sexual stimulant that improves the quality of your erection. Ginkgo Biloba has been recognized by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine as a sexual enhancement herb.\n  7. Catuaba Bark Extract \u2013 Catuaba origin can be traced back to Brazil and Peru. It is used by men in these countries to improve their sexual desire.\n  8. Saw Palmetto Berry \u2013 Saw Palmetto improves the testosterone pathways. It has been used for a long time to treat sexual deficiencies\u2019.\n  9. Bioperine \u2013 This is a potent cocktail that enhances sexual performance on its own. Combining it with the other ingredients mentioned above will boost your sexual performance 40 percent more.\n\nHow do I use VigRX Plus pills?\n\nThe recommended dosage for VigRX Plus is one pill twice a day. You can take one in the morning after breakfast and the last one after dinner daily. Each box contains pills that will last for 30 days. If you want to get an optimal result, you can also get VigRX Oil. Please, don\u2019t use this pill more than the recommended dosage.\n\nWho is supposed to use VigRX Plus?\n\nVigRX for men is made to improve your sexual ability. It is believed that men suffering from severe erectile dysfunction can also use this pill too. Keep it away from children and store in safe a place.\n\nThis pill is not good for persons under 18 years. Although VigRX Plus is more of a supplement, caution is advised.\n\nHow long does it take to work?\n\nVigRX Plus is not your typical male enhancement pill that works within 60 minutes of taking it. Any review saying otherwise is only trying to sell the product to you.\n\nThe reason so many men prefer prescription drugs like Viagra and Cialis is because they crave for an instant result. Don\u2019t take VigRX Plus and expect an instant result especially if you are suffering from erectile dysfunction. This pill is made to give you results that will last a life\u2019s time.\n\nThe result starts manifesting after taking the pills for 30 to 60days. If you want the best results, take the pills as recommended.\n\nThe results before and after; does it give permanent results?\n\nIf you take this pill as recommended for at least 30 to 60 days, you are likely to get a permanent result. Other male enhancement pills don\u2019t provide you with a long term remedies, especially the blue pills. They only offer instant results with several side effects that could endanger your health.\n\nVigRX Plus builds your sexual prowess after some time; thereby restoring your confidence. Don\u2019t forget that this pill is a supplement and not your typical prescription. With this pill, you can have sex with your partner at any time. You don\u2019t need to take it 1 or 2 hours before sex.\n\nvigrx plus results users\n\nIs VigRX Plus safe to use? What is the side effect?\n\nIt\u2019s no news that male enhancement pills like Viagra, Cialis, etc. have a series of side effects. Although they give you hard and firm erections, the risk may not be worth it in the future. Instead of putting your body through so much danger with prescription drugs, why not go for a pill with zero side effects.\n\nVigRX Plus has been used all over the world by several men and as at the time of writing this review, there is no record of any negative side effects. Mind you, this supplement has been around for more than 15 years.\n\nFrom our findings, there is no known side effect. This product is made from natural ingredients, unlike other male enhancement pills. You can go through the list of ingredients to ensure that you are not allergic to any. Take the pills as recommended and you will be fine.\n\nWhere can I buy VigRX Plus?\n\nUnfortunately, some copycats are taking advantage of VigRX Plus popularity to produce counterfeit products.

        "text":"Home \/ Carb Blocker \/ Those Donuts Are Making You Look Old\n\nThose Donuts Are Making You Look Old\n\nsugar, donuts, carbsNot just the donuts, but any refined sugar or simple carbohydrate is contributing to wrinkles and other signs of aging. What we think of as \u201caging\u201d is actually a complex process between our genetics, our biology and the environment, including the food we eat. So if you have been in search of the legendary \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d, read on.\n\nYou know how some people seem to retain a glow of youth longer than others? It very well may be that their diet is higher in healthy fats, low-glycemic foods, adequate protein, and pure water as opposed to the soda, pastries, dairy and fast food laden diet now typically known as the \u201cAmerican Diet\u201d or \u201cWestern Diet\u201d.\u00a0 If Ponce de Leon had been searching for the Fountain of Youth today he would not be looking in the Americas.\n\nSugar and Carbs Cause Wrinkles, Lines and Sagging Skin\n\nHigh-glycemic carbohydrates such as breads, starches, potatoes, baked goods, pastas, desserts, soda, candies, etc. are quickly digested and converted to glucose. The excess sugar molecules in your bloodstream attach themselves to collagen fibers creating a sugar\/protein bonding called glycation. This causes cells to lose their strength and flexibility so the skin becomes less elastic and more vulnerable to sun damage, lines, and sagging.\n\nThe process of glycation leads to AGEs, Advanced Glycosylation End products.1\n\n  1. Sugar and simple carbs cause inflammation\n  2. Inflammation produces enzymes that break down collagen and elastin\n  3. Inflammation binds to collagen making the skin less elastic\n  4. The skin becomes more vulnerable to sun damage, lines, sagging and disease\n\nThis degenerative process in not limited to skin, it\u2019s involved in all age related diseases. Hardening of the arteries, atherosclerosis, the formation of cataracts, neurological impairment, diabetic complications, and even Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer are all impacted by glycation.\n\nAs well as increasing the effects of aging, glycation can make skin conditions like acne and rosacea worse.2 A diet high in simple carbs can lead to insulin resistance, which can create symptoms like excess hair growth and dark patches of skin on the neck and in body creases.\n\nSugar Suppresses White Blood Cell Activity\n\nWhite blood cells are involved in protecting the body against infectious disease and foreign invaders, in other words, they are your immune system. A diet high in sugar causes serious increase in inflammatory chemicals at a cellular level. Sugar\u2019s suppression of white blood cells can cause you to be more susceptible to colds, flu, other infectious diseases and even cancer.\n\nWhy do we love the things that are killing us? It\u2019s not your fault, we\u2019ve all been led astray by false information. Loving sweet food is as natural as the fruit that grows on trees. We simply need to redirect our sweet tooth back to what nature has provided; whole fruit and berries.\n\nThe Real Fountain of Youth is Real Food\n\nThese degenerative processes can be reversed if you\u2019re still young, or improved if your years are already advanced or you are suffering from disease. Eating a nutrient rich diet, choosing low-glycemic carbs, getting adequate Omega 3 fats and protein, and staying hydrated is your fountain of youth. If you can do this 90% of the time, then an occasional splurge at the ice cream parlor probably won\u2019t hurt.\n\nSugardown bottle 1Your body needs to be functioning at optimal levels most of the time to be able to process the occasional indulgence. The sugar will still cause inflammation and white blood cell suppression, but your body can recover more quickly when it\u2019s not chronically under the stress of dealing with high blood sugar.\u00a0SUGARDOWN\u00ae can help reduce the impact of the undesirable carbs you eat, and help to reduce your cravings.\n\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, are overweight or have other degenerative diseases the most important health choice you can make is to eliminate highly processed and high glycemic foods.\u00a0SUGARDOWN\u00ae is here to help you do that.\n\nSUGARDOWN\u00ae can help you kick the sugar habit and manage your carbs and weight.
