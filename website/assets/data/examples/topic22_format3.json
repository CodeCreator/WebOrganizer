        "text":"Dynon Aviation Data Advisory: KOAK (Oakland) Class C Airspace\n\nDate: April 23, 2012\n\nPilots Affected:\n\nThis Aviation Data Advisory only applies to SkyView-equipped aircraft that use the free Dynon-provided Aviation Data in or around the KOAK (Oakland International) class C airspace.\n\nAviation Data Affected:\n\nIssue is known to be present in the 5 April 2012 - 1 May 2012 cycle of FAA\/AeroNav aviation data (free US-only data) available from the Dynon Database Downloads Page.\n\nThis issue is likely to be present in earlier data cycles. Dynon does not know if or when AeroNAV\/FAA will correct the issue in future data cycles.\n\nDynon Avionics has notified the FAA\/AeroNav of the error in this data.\n\nDescription of Problem:\n\nThe Class C airspace altitudes for KOAK (Oakland International) are incorrect.\n\nThe paper sectional for this area depicts the ceilings for KOAK's class C airspace with a ceiling of \"T\" instead of a numerical altitude as is usually the case. A ceiling of \"T\" means that the class C airspace ends at the floor of the airspace immediately above it. In this case, this means that KOAK's class C ceiling is at SFO's class B floor in places. Since SFO's class B and KOAK's class C airspace are not perfectly aligned, KOAK class C has a variable ceiling.\n\nThe FAA\/AeroNav data that is available on SkyView contains numerical values for the KOAK airspace ceilings that are not \"cut up\" into enough areas to accurately represent the variable ceiling of the KOAK class C airspace. Therefore, the FAA\/AeroNav data that is distributed by Dynon can mislead the pilot into believing that the aircraft is not in class C or class B airspace when, in fact, the pilot remains in KOAK's class C airspace.\n\nDynon recommends that pilots use supplemental navigation data when transiting the KOAK airspace area.",

        "text":"Sign icon\n\nElectric vehicles\n\nLondon has dangerous levels of air pollution which impact our health and contributes to climate change.The majority of pollution in London comes from road transport.\n\nReplacing petrol and diesel vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs) will help to improve local air quality by reducing harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.\n\nWe are supporting Islington residents switching to electric vehicles providing an on-street charging infrastructure. We acknowledge the majority of residents in Islington lack off-street parking, and cannot charge an EV at home.\n\nDespite their environmental benefits, EVs are still motorised vehicles which contribute to road congestion and road safety issues. Therefore, public and active transport (e.g. walking and cycling) remain the Council\u2019s top transport priority.\n\nSee more about the charging points in Islington\n\nHow we identify charging locations\n\nThe process we follow depends on the network operator and type of charging point. When investigating locations for new charging points, there are a wide range of matters to consider such as:\n\n  \u2022 Electricity and BT availability\n  \u2022 Parking restrictions\n  \u2022 Footway clearance widths\n  \u2022 Heritage restrictions\n  \u2022 Local demand\n  \u2022 Visibility\n\n\nTo reward the switch to low emission vehicles; electric vehicles receive the cheapest residential parking permits. This is because they produce less air pollution.\n\nBusiness parking permits are also cheaper for electric vehicles.\n\nElectric vehicles can now use short stay paid for parking facilities at the reduced rate of 20p. Simply select the time period you wish to park for and the system will charge you the concessionary rate. Maximum stay and the 'no return within one hour' rules still apply - check signs in the parking area.\n\nUltra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)\n\nThe Ultra Low Emission Zone is expanding from 25 October 2021. Have you checked your vehicle? Go to the TfL website for full details.\n\nFrom 25 October 2021 the ULEZ is due to be expanded to the area bounded by the North and South Circular Roads (which cover all of Islington). Find out more about the ULEZ on the TfL website.\n\nTime it takes to charge an electric vehicle\n\n  \u2022 The time it takes to recharge an EV depends on various factors such as:\n  \u2022 the power output of the charging point\n  \u2022 the size of the EV battery\n\nA typical EV can be recharged in approximately one hour from a 50kW charger or roughly four hours from a 7kW charger.\u00a0\n\nWas this information helpful?\n\n  1.

        "text":"Air Conditioning controls\n\nThe air conditioning system in your Audi helps keep you comfortable and safe behind the wheel, and should be regularly serviced to maximize performance. From providing fresh, cool air in the summer months, to helping defrost or defog your windows in the winter, the air conditioning system is constantly at work. And much like an engine, your Audi air conditioning system should be routinely checked for condition and operation.\n\nWhen to Service Your Air Conditioning System\n\nRegularly servicing your air conditioning system will ensure consistent operation throughout the year, and can be done when regularly servicing your Audi. An AC repair should also be scheduled any time an issue arises. Some of the most common issues with air conditioning systems can include:\n\n  \u2022 Warm air coming from vents\n  \u2022 Little to no air coming from vents\n  \u2022 Windows will not defog or fog up quickly\n  \u2022 Interior air has a foul smell\n  \u2022 Whining or hissing noise from engine bay\n  \u2022 Engine bogs down when using AC\n  \u2022 Check engine light turns on when using AC\n\nService Center Hours\n\n  \u2022 Monday - Friday 7:00am-7:00pm\n  \u2022 Saturday 7:00am-5:00pm\n  \u2022 Sunday Closed\n\n\nAudi Peoria\n\n16900 N. 88th Drive\nDirections Peoria, AZ 85382\n\n  \u2022 Contact Us: 602-399-7002\n\nIf you are experiencing any of the above symptoms in your Audi, there is likely an issue with your air conditioning system, and it should be serviced quickly to prevent further issues. Now much like your vehicle's engine or transmission, any issue with the air conditioning system should be diagnosed by an expert technician. Being comprised of specialized pumps, belts, high-pressure lines, and refrigerant, the air conditioning system can be complicated to repair without specialized knowledge and tools.\n\nSchedule an Audi AC Service\n\nFortunately at Audi Peoria our in-house Audi AC service center is staffed by a team of expert factory-trained technicians, who can get your air conditioning system\u00a0performing at its best.
