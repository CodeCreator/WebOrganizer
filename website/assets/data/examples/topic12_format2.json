The last Nation Nutrition Cbd Oil group of people walked to the edge of the city and looked at the woods in front of them At the edge of the woods, you could see the land where the indigenous people guarded them. Go! Zhang Yang dragged Liu Best Cbd Oil Etracts Biao, who was still lying on the ground, and ran to the small bedroom behind Bec9me A Cbd Oil Distributor the old man who was sleeping. It was almost half past eight in the evening, when we were waiting impatiently, a heavy footstep slowly came up from below His steps were heavy, as if he was stomping heavily every step of the way. Seeing Song Chunlins wife go out, dc cbd reviews I asked Shes alone, wont you run around?

        "text":"The Nursing Crimes\n\nNurse's hat 03 50% JPG\n\n\n\nKiko sits among the crowded nurses all squeezed together, two to a seat and spilling off the ends of padded benches. Nurses being loud in a restrained and socially acceptable but savagely competitive way. Every nurse present is having the same conversation. All of them are the busiest nurse on the busiest ward and struggling, supernurse-style, with gargantuan levels of busyness which would crush lesser people \u2013 the ones they\u2019re talking to currently.\n\nEach nurse being informed of this, subtly, loudly or with increasing levels of politely shrill interruption, replies that she is not only busier but has left her helpless patients for a coffee break only because she was forced at gunpoint to do so. \u2018Honestly\u2019, they say, \u2018we\u2019re short-staffed. I\u2019ve had to admit seventy people, discharged two hundred, do fifty bed baths while performing two simultaneous resuscitations\u2019 and so on. It\u2019s difficult to take this sort of thing seriously as the wards only have beds for forty-two people.\n\nThe usual response is, \u2018Short-staffed? We\u2019re three down and the rest of us getting shorter. My poor feet are worn down to my pelvis and I can hardly reach the medicine trolley. God only knows how I\u2019ll cope\u2019.\n\nActually they don\u2019t say these exact words but the morning tea break\/lunch\/whatever battle is unremittingly tedious. Two nurses meeting at a party a million miles away will engage in this manner. They can\u2019t stop themselves.\n\nKiko, however, sits hunched and pale. She\u2019s small, legs wound around each other, hands gripped in her lap. Tense, lonely, she never looks happy. Other nurses call her Karen because she\u2019s foreign and Kiko is too difficult for them to pronounce.\n\nI feel for her. Why on earth she came to the UK to study nursing is not only beyond me but I suspect she started wondering too \u2013 about three seconds after she met us.\n\nShe and I are third year student nurses, which gives us the status of maggots in a five star restaurant. I\u2019m also male which demotes me to about the level of last month\u2019s potato peelings the restaurant rat ate and vomited. Some nurses are surprised I can actually talk and write.\n\nWelcome to King\u2019s College Hospital nurses\u2019 canteen and noise levels that can pop rivets from ships.\n\nThe only available space to sit is on the games machine. I\u2019m relieved to see Simon, another male nurse, already there. Simon\u2026 I\u2019ll need two cups of tea this morning because talking to him will involve spilling at least one. I also buy a wholemeal roll I can use as a weapon.\n\nActually his name isn\u2019t Simon. He\u2019s from Africa somewhere and I can\u2019t pronounce his real one. He fails every time with mine too so we merely find new names with which to offend each other.\n\nI weave my way between knobbly lines of black-stockinged knees like an insect in a millipedes\u2019 hosiery outlet and settle myself on the games console. \u201cGood morning, Simian. How\u2019s you?\u201d\n\nHe looks up through an eye-stinging cloud of cigarette smoke. \u201cIt\u2019s the smelly haggis bloke. Busy?\u201d\n\nThat word \u2026 that bastard question. I\u2019ve spilt some tea just as a result of being asked it.\n\nBusy? Me? Nah. Can\u2019t be arsed. Stupid patients, they\u2019re all \u2018Oh look at me I\u2019m sick\u2019. I tell them they should have thought about that before they came into the hospital. It\u2019s survival of the fittest here.\u201d\n\nAt least three nurses nearby have fallen into horrified silence. I\u2019ve blasphemed. Patients are sacred. Well no \u2013 they are the lowest level of life imaginable \u2013 but you don\u2019t ever say that.\n\nPatients don\u2019t even have real names. One is the hip in bed four, another the whinger in bed twelve who should be tied to the bed-rails with bandages and beaten silent with a steel bedpan \u2013 but never is.\n\nYou see, the only reason patients exist is to allow middle-class angels the chance to prove to the world they are the most perfect, caring and exemplary nurses ever born. \u2018Look at me being perfect and so\u00a0very,\u00a0very busy!\u2019. To suggest you don\u2019t care about the poor leg ulcer in bed nine is like \u2026 no, nothing compares.\n\nThe nurses sitting near us look in wide-eyed startlement at each other as if they\u2019ve misheard me \u2013 not that they were actively listening to someone else\u2019s conversation. Oh no, that was purely accidental. When they\u2019ve finished struggling to breathe they try the tight-lipped moral-high-ground death-stare at me which never works.\n\nAnyway,\u201d I say to Simon, \u201cYou\u2019re normally on second break. What brings you hither so precipitately?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t give me all that Scottish shite talk. I\u2019m here because I need to take both breaks so I can work something out.\u201d He frowns, waiting for his own blasphemy \u2018take both breaks\u2019 to silence more scandalised nurses. \u201cI was supposed to insert a nasogastric tube in a patient. Not sure if I got the right patient \u2013 or the right tube. It went into his nose OK but I think it\u2019s a urinary catheter. I couldn\u2019t work out if it even went into the right place. I inflated it as usual but one of his eyes swelled up and looks like a goldfish bowl now. I\u2019m not sure what to do so I\u2019m thinking it over. Do you know where I\u00a0can\u00a0get goldfish round here?\u201d He takes a sip of tea. \u201cAnyway, where\u2019ve you been the last few weeks? I heard you were suspended for switching all the cardiac monitors off.\u201d\n\nI appealed successfully. I\u2019m allergic to beeps and told the patients to call me if their hearts stopped.\u201d It\u2019s getting quieter in the canteen.\n\nSo where were you?\u201d\n\nSpecial clinic.\u201d He looks bemused so I explain. \u201cSexually transmitted diseases.\u201d\n\nFor so long? What on earth did you catch?\u201d\n\nFat chance of catching anything round here,\u201d I say, scanning the room. \u201cFemale nurses don\u2019t do sex \u2013 too unhygienic or something.\u201d\n\nHe nods, his deep voice reverberating in the spreading hush the word sex has caused. \u201cIt\u2019s true. See this lot? Most of these women look as if they never even go to the toilet.\u201d We are now the focus of so many death-stares that only the cockroach in my roll may make it out of here alive. He asks, \u201cAnd what did you learn in the special clinic?\u201d\n\nI saw a tiny wriggly thing under the microscope.\u201d\n\nYou actually found your penis at last?\u201d\n\nI tell you, there was one scrawny bloke, short thin and weedy. I told him to get it out and this thing kept unfolding and unfolding \u2026 and unfolding. No one needs one that long. I told him he could sell parts of it and still not miss out. I was wondering if he would lend me a bit.\u201d\n\nI scored! Simon actually snorted tea everywhere. He wipes his tunic in order to make it look like blood stains. \u201cAnything else interesting?\u201d\n\nYes. I saw a clitoris.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nA squidgy thing women have. Not sure what they\u2019re for.\u201d\n\nWhere do they keep them?\u201d\n\nDunno. Do you think it\u2019s important? I wasn\u2019t really concentrating. The registrar was going on about a test he\u2019d done on the clinic\u2019s toilet seats. He said no one uses them and they\u2019re the only sterile thing in the entire health service.\u201d\n\nBut Simon, once on the subject of sex, is not to be deflected. \u201cI take it you didn\u2019t score there.\u201d\n\nNo but we\u2019ve scored this morning, right here on this games console: today!\u201d Absolute silence pervades the canteen as ears strain to listen in a ladylike \u2018I\u2019m not listening but concentrating on how to selflessly save more lives. If I hear anything it won\u2019t be my fault\u2019 way.\n\nSimon smirks. \u201cThis cannot be related to my usage of the word \u2018score\u2019.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve scored all right. We\u2019ve silenced nearly a hundred battling tongues and made Kiko laugh. The entire world gasps in awe.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a9Gary Bonn, 2018\n\nMore Stories 03",

Enjoy!\n\nJenna climbed the stairs, flight after flight leading her into the sky. The sun was setting over the city. Below, a million busy people were swarming through the streets, going home from school or work, meeting their friends and collecting their kids.\nPausing for breath, Jenna leaned over the railing, watching. She wondered how many of them would notice if she were to drop dead on that rooftop. She wondered how long it would take for someone to find her, if anyone would even miss her.\nThey would notice her if she dropped out of the sky though. Not the quiet, plain girl in the corner any more. Just a mess on the pavement. She would make an impact then. Jenna closed her eyes and gripped the rail, lifting her leg to climb onto the edge.\n\nJenna jumped, hearing a voice behind her. Her foot slipped, losing purchase on the edge, keeping her on the rooftop. Her heart pounded as she turned around.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d A woman stood near the door.\nJenna scowled at her. \u201cYou a cop? Trying to stop me?\u201d\nThe woman shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not a cop.\u201d\nJenna turned away. \u201cThen leave me alone.\u201d\n\u201cWatch then. Whatever. I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nThe woman moved closer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt forever.\u201d\n\u201cLike you\u2019d know.\u201d Jenna snorted.\n\u201cTry me.\u201d The woman stood beside her, looking over the edge. \u201cI know more than you think.\u201d\nJenna shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll just come back tomorrow. Or wait for you to go home. You can\u2019t stay out here forever.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. About everything. You\u2019ve got so much ahead of you. And you can be anything you want to be \u2013 a vet, a model, an artist.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d\n\u201cI know more than you think, Jenna.\u201d\nJenna looked up. \u201cHave we met?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe a long time ago in a future that won\u2019t happen if you jump.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jenna stepped away from the edge, staring at the woman. She looked ordinary, more like a younger version of her own mother than a dangerous stalker.\n\u201cSomeone who needs you to live. Whatever they say, Jenna, you don\u2019t have to believe them. And you might not see it, but you\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re clever. And you\u2019re talented. You just need a little more time.\u201d The woman smiled. \u201cIf you jump, you\u2019ll miss it all. Your story will be short and sad. No first kiss. No career. You\u2019ll never meet the father of your children and your children will never be born.\u201d\n\u201cSo they\u2019ll never grow up to change the world. And neither will you. You\u2019re special, Jenna. And there is only one way to prove that.\u201d\nJenna took another step towards the door, both women reaching for it at the same time.\n\nThe woman smiled as she descended the stairs remembering the night twenty years earlier, when a woman she had never met decided to save her life.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Wellington Street\n\nIn which we take a stroll down a very strange stretch of road.\n\n\nRead Next\n\nSubject File 4 \"The Intruder\"\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, I would sometimes wake up late at night, unable to move or speak. I found out that I was suffering from a very rare form of sleep paralysis, one that affects only three percent of those who suffer from it. Although many of the symptoms easily explained, the doctors couldn't explain everything. I sometimes awoke to a figure sitting on top of me, looking into my eyes. The sensation of a malevolent presence is common, and known as \u201cthe intruder.\u201d But most of the time this isn't a visual manifestation, and never does it speak.\n\nIt began when I was around eight years old. Many people struggle to remember things from that far back, but it is hard to forget the first time it happened. I awoke suddenly in the dead of winter, the streetlamps failing to brighten my room because the shades were drawn. It was cold, and I realized that I needed to use the bathroom. Only I couldn't move at all, my eyelids refusing to close, my muscles refusing to stir. Time passed, and I began to become aware of my eyes burning, and the growing need to urinate. Minutes later I wet the bed for the first time in years. When I finally could move I began crying, screaming for my parents.My parents were horrified. My sister was fascinated.\n\nThe weeks that followed were filled with tests and doctors visits, my parents often visiting me throughout the night to make sure I was okay. Sometimes my sister would be with them. She seemed to worry about me a lot. Eventually I was given medicine as a preventative measure, but nothing was able to make it go away completely. Months passed, and though terrifying, I began to adjust to the infrequent episodes. Only one day wasn't like the others, and I awoke with a horrible sense of fear. But not like before. Instead, I felt as if someone was watching me.\n\nAt first I kept it to myself, but soon my terrors began to become more frequent. My parents had my medicine increased, and that seemed to do the trick for a while. But then my medicine began to disappear, a months supply going away as soon as my parents brought it home. At first it was simply replaced when we failed to find where it had gone. But soon my parents became upset at me, accusing me of purposefully throwing them away. I couldn't understand why they would think that, but soon I began to pretend that I was better, and that the episodes had stopped. They stopped needing to replace the medicine, but the incidents began to increase in number.\n\nThen one day, I awoke to the sensation that something was in the room with me. At first I was able to dismiss it as being part of my condition, and though I wanted desperately to have my medicine again I would endure it if it meant my parents wouldn't be upset at me. It was a child's sort of logic, and it lasted for a while. Then one day I awoke to a figure sitting over me. Even in the dark I could tell it was staring directly into my eyes. It just sat there, looking at me, only somehow I got a sense that there was something wrong with its eyes. They were bloodshot, and never blinked.\n\nRendering New Theme...",

though, Marlene's face did not really match the rest of her body in so much as, without a wider view, few would ever place her head atop a body anywhere nearly as fat as Marlene's.\u00a0\u00a0She had to swipe a lock of her fluffy brown hair off her eyes, revealing the entirety of a tender, sexy face almost completely unmarred by the fatness enveloping the rest of her body.\u00a0\u00a0Though Marlene was well aware of her face's powers of sexual attraction, the relative svelte smallness of her head was far more important to her; it made the rest of her body appear even more massive by comparison.\n\nBut her body needed no help from her head.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene was above average height, but her weight was far higher than could be explained by her bone structure.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene's fat body was a labor of love; namely, she loved her fat.\u00a0\u00a0More than anything else, Marlene loved her fat belly.\n\nThe same men who would so easily fall in love with her face might admit to themselves secretly that even her surprisingly big body might be hot if it were about two hundred pounds lighter.\u00a0\u00a0And, indeed, to Marlene's constant chagrin, she was shaped like an over-bloated classical hourglass.\u00a0\u00a0Her bust was magnificent; she sported flabby but well supported breasts, each nearly the size of her own head.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene did enjoy her breasts in a much more traditional sense than she enjoyed her face, but even their size and plush softness were pitiful conciliations for a girl who yearned for a massive, swollen glob of belly fat to hug and squeeze.\n\nUnfortunately for Marlene, her belly seemed dead set against cooperation.\u00a0\u00a0Even under so much fat, Marlene's waist was pinched strikingly, effectively cutting her belly fat in half and maintaining her busty, thick-hipped body type.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene's lower belly roll was thick and jiggly, but its impressive fatness was lost between her swooping hips.\n\nIn a gesture of animosity, Marlene gripped the monstrous hemispheres of her mortal enemy: her ass.\u00a0\u00a0She lifted and shook each cheek, sending waves of jiggling over her entire body, and she loosed a cry of frustration.\u00a0\u00a0Her ass was huge!\u00a0\u00a0Why-was-her-ass-so-HUGE?!\n\nMarlene's butt was actually just about as perfectly proportioned with the rest of her flaring curves as possible, but to Marlene, anything bigger than her belly was too big.\u00a0\u00a0By her reasoning, because her hips were wider, they almost certainly got more attention: they spread out more than her belly when she sat, they were a lot heavier than her precious gut, and her butt cheeks were almost as flabby as her fat belly.\u00a0\u00a0The very idea of it!\u00a0\u00a0Marlene shook her ass, swiveling in the mirror to find the non-existent magical angle that made it appear smaller.\u00a0\u00a0She huffed in indignation when none could be found.\n\nDesperate for some good news, Marlene pounded into the bathroom and stepped on the scale.\u00a0\u00a0The digital display cycled its \"calculating\" animation of dancing lines, and after five seconds 313.0 flashed out of the grey screen.\n\n\"Geez, I haven't been this unlucky since I weighed a hundred thirty,\" Marlene mumbled.\u00a0\u00a0That had been a long time ago.\u00a0\u00a0It had not been a happy time, either.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, any number that was bigger than before meant that at least some of the fat was going to her magnificent belly, even if Marlene wished that the increased padding were a little more selective.\n\nDredged out of her slump, Marlene hoisted up her pants and squeezed the button closed over her belly.\u00a0\u00a0Even though her waist was the skinniest part of her torso, her belly itched where the denim rubbed tightly against her tender skin.\u00a0\u00a0She knew that in only a few minutes there would be angry red marks that circled her entire waist.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene wished that she did not have to subject her delicate belly to such scarring torture-especially because she suspected that squeezing her belly in two every time she put on pants was contributing to its refusal to fill out properly-but it was very hard to find pants that fit properly, and most pairs she bought didn't last a month before they were too tight again, anyway.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene tugged down her shirt and unwrapped another snake cake.\u00a0\u00a0She stuffed it into her mouth as she hopped up onto her bed.\u00a0\u00a0Thinking with bliss about how full she was already, she reached for another one and swallowed it, too.\n\nMarlene had to continue the rest of her casual binge with her clothes on because she knew that her roommate, Claire, was due back from class any minute.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene had always been careful to never let Claire catch her with her pants down-literally-even though there was no way to hide the trash bags full of empty snack wrappers, flattened boxes of cookies, hollow ice cream cartons, and drained milk jugs from her roommate.\u00a0\u00a0Claire just seemed to accept that whenever she saw Marlene, she saw Marlene eating; that was who her roommate was.\u00a0\u00a0A fat girl who was always eating, and that was the way Marlene liked it.\n\nBut Marlene did not like everything about her lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0She did not like having to stop eating delicious treats once her stomach was stuffed full; she did not like that her ass was her dominant feature when she longed for nothing more than to have a gigantic, sexy belly.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene absentmindedly squeezed her bloated belly fat and dumped the last snack cake in the box into her hand.\u00a0\u00a0Before she ate it, she flipped the box over to read how many calories each cake had been worth, but she was distracted by the humorously ironic \"Better Life Through Fitness\" fun facts plastered all over the back of the box.\u00a0\u00a0A cartoon man and woman jogged along a winding park sidewalk and laughed while a boy played Frisbee with his dog in the background.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene read the colorful thought bubbles of information about living a healthy lifestyle as she chewed slowly on the last fattening cake.\n\nDid you know:\u00a0\u00a0You burn more calories standing than sitting!\n\n\"Yeah, no shit,\" Marlene chuckled, spluttering a little chocolate onto the white cardboard.\n\nNo time to go to the gym?\u00a0\u00a0You can firm your butt and thighs by walking every day!\n\nMarlene's eyes roved over the rest of the snippets of advice without really reading them, but she read over the one about thighs again before tossing the box away.\u00a0\u00a0Curious, she inspected the life-like pictures of the happy man and woman more closely than before.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, both of them were drawn with exceptionally well toned legs.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene noted with a touch of jealousy, there wasn't a woman alive who would call the female jogger's butt too big.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene looked back and forth between the box and her own fleshy thighs.\u00a0\u00a0Even restricted in her tight jeans, her thigh fat spread out like warm dough over her bed sheets, stretching the fabric of her pants to the limit.\n\nI do kind of just lie around all day, Marlene thought.\n\nBut that only helped her gain weight, right?\u00a0\u00a0Something about that stupid fitness advertisement, though, planted the seeds of a radical idea in her head.\u00a0\u00a0Marlene had spent most of her young adult life up to the present doing just about everything she could-which usually meant doing as little as possible-to pack ...

Wow: I\u2019ve turned up at 221b Baker Street and met Sherlock Holmes. \u00a0He\u2019s just taken a glance at me and\u2026I mean\u2026am not sitting with my feet tucked behind my ears or something.\n\n\u201cDo you have any stomach problems?\u201d He says. \u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, warming to one of my favourite topics. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m on pills for my constipation and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he says. \u00a0\u201cHyper mobile people often suffer from constipation. \u00a0So, why have you come to see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there a letter from my doctor?\u201d I say. \u00a0\u201cI thought they\u2019d written to you or\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOh, OK,\u201d I say. \u00a0\u201cWell \u2013 when I was about five I was diagnosed with allergies to house dust, house dust mites and feathers. \u00a0But during chemotherapy I became allergic to plasters too. \u00a0And I\u2019ve had urticaria and sometimes my lip swells up and no-one knows why. \u00a0\n\nThen, a couple of weeks ago my eye swelled up and I could feel my throat closing and I was frightened and\u2026well, I went to my doctor and asked for allergy tests. \u00a0And he sent me here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d he says, scrawling this on his pad in fountain pen. \u00a0\u201cWell, let\u2019s do the tests.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a tray of tiny bottles in front of him, twenty or so of them.\n\n\u201cOh and I\u2019ve had all my lymph nodes out on my right arm, so we have to use the left,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d he says, making dots down my left arm, in ten pairs.\n\n\u201cPlease let me not be allergic to dog, cat, horse, egg, cheese, milk or wine,\u201d I say, as he starts to cut into my skin.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re brave, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He says.\n\n\u201cVery brave,\u201d I say.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nThe attached fuchsia lives near my office.\n\nHappy Friday everyone!\n*2012. \u00a0By Peg Cochran. \u00a0Detective novel containing recipes. \u00a0First in the Gourmet De-Lite murder mystery series.\n\n8 thoughts on \u201cAllergic To Death*\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

This was done to save the city money. However, the city did not use the proper chemicals to ensure the water was safe. They also did not upgrade the water pipes which were also leaking chemicals into the water. Citizens complained to the media and the government and soon this became a national story.\n\nWritten by Michael Scoleri\n\nsponsored by Whatamidoingwithmylife studios or Rafael",

        "text":"Sunday, May 29, 2016\n\nNot Zen 186: Maybe It's Not You\n\nThe counselor finished reading the excuse note, which a teacher had scrawled on the back of a blue, half-page hall pass. He folded it over. With a glance at the pass mark on the opposite side, dated two days previously and apparently reused at need, he set it on the table.\u00a0\n\n\"Well?\" said the brown-haired girl across the table from him.\n\nHe rubbed his chin. He'd seen the girl twice before this week. He'd formed an opinion of her symptoms. But he was loathe to share it. \u00a0His words would likely get misinterpreted.\u00a0\n\n\"You were ...\"\n\nAs he began, someone knocked on the frosted glass door panel. He glanced up at the rattling noise. His principal, a broad-shouldered woman twice his age, opened the door without waiting for him to respond.\n\nHis student's tearful expression vanished. She wiped her face. With a wary glance at the intruder to the counseling office, she leaned back in her seat.\u00a0\n\n\"Can I help you, ma'am?\" the counselor said. His principal shrugged. She folded her arms and leaned against the wall in her pantsuit.\u00a0\n\n\"Not yet.\" She waved an arm. \"Continue.\"\u00a0\n\nHis eyebrows rose. This would normally be a circumstance in which he'd send either the administrator or the student out of the room. But since his supervisor knew she was breaking the confidentiality code, he couldn't point it out or she'd accuse him of undermining her authority in front of a student.\n\nHe turned to the girl. She blinked.\n\n\"You were about to tell me your symptoms,\" he reminded her. \"Can you can describe in detail how it is that you're feeling today?\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The girl bit her lower lip for a moment. \"My arms are jittery. My heart feels funny. My breath is too fast. I think that's it. No, I'm sweaty, too.\"\n\n\"So it sounds like a panic attack.\"\n\n\"Or asthma,\" she said, sitting up straighter. He knew that she loved to be contrary. If he'd suggested it was asthma, she'd have said it was from taking the wrong dose of medicine. The girl's fingers brushed away a strand of her brown hair.\u00a0\n\n\"It's your third attack this week.\" He rubbed his forehead. \"I have to say, for asthma, it's discouraging how your medicine doesn't seem to help.\"\n\n\"If you'd send me to the doctor again, I'd change my prescription.\" She gave him a brave smile. She was getting good at that expression. Her fingers linked together in her lap. She relaxed in her chair, apparently satisfied with the argument she felt she was making.\u00a0\n\nThe counselor glanced at his supervisor. Her face presented him with an impassive scowl but that was normal for her. She said nothing. Her fists remained folded under her grey suit jacket. She gave him no real indication of her approval or disapproval.\u00a0\n\n\"I think you should change something else,\" he said as he turned his gaze back to the girl.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nHe hesitated. It would help, he thought, if he could encourage the student to voice opinions that the principal wouldn't want to hear from a guidance officer.\u00a0\n\n\"Your environment.\" He nodded. But from the blank look on her face, the girl didn't get the hint. Next to him, the principal tapped her foot.\n\n\"You mean like nature and stuff?\" the student wondered.\n\nHe closed his eyes. The foot tapping continued. His chest rose and fell with a deep breath.\n\n\"Your environment,\" he explained as he indicated the walls around him, \"can also mean the circumstances that you find yourself in. It's your surroundings.\"\n\n\"Like what, the school building?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" he murmured. \"Have you noticed these attacks are all school related? You don't have them during your after-school job. You don't have them when you go home. No, you only have them in the morning when you're faced with coming here or, sometimes, when you've just arrived.\"\n\nThe girl looked down at her knees. Perhaps it was her hands on her knees. Either way, she studied herself for a while before she spoke. She kicked her school backpack twice before she seemed to realize that it was her turn to offer some thoughts.\n\n\"I'm not faking,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course not,\" he replied immediately.\n\n\"So is it the building that's making me sick?\"\n\n\"Maybe not.\" That phrase wasn't definitive enough, he realized. \"Probably not.\"\n\nNext to him, his principal grunted. The girl glanced at her, not at him.\n\n\"I remember the history of your problem.\" He laid open his left hand. \"There was a fight in the school. Your friends were hurt. You got anxious about more threats and more fights. There were plenty. So I sent you to a doctor. He prescribed medicine. You took the medicine.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" She nodded, happy to confirm. \"Plus my asthma medicine.\"\n\n\"Then some of your friends left the school. Other girls decided they weren't your friends any more.\" He watched her sense of satisfaction vanish. \"That made you depressed. I recommended you to a psychiatrist. He prescribed medicine.\"\n\n\"Ugh, yeah.\"\u00a0\n\n\"This year, you couldn't get into the class you wanted. So you took a class that bored you. You had mood swings in that class.\" He waited for her to nod. \"I recommended you to a different counselor. She recommended you to a psychiatrist. He prescribed medicine again.\"\n\n\"Those pills make me sick to my stomach.\" She bent over as if she were ill.\n\n\"Yes, you're taking a lot of medicine now. It must seem like you're very sick.\"\n\n\"I guess.\" Fortunately, she didn't seem pleased about it. Some students were.\n\n\"What if the problem isn't you?\" He leaned closer. \"What if it's your abnormal situation?\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\" She sat up straighter. From her blank expression, she didn't think that anything in her school circumstance was strange.\n\n\"These things go on in every institution this large, Harold,\" said the principal, who understood the point.\n\n\"Until a hundred years ago, most schools were the size or one or two of our classrooms, maybe a hundred students in all grades, together.\" He rested his hands on his knees and returned his principal's glower for a moment. Then his gaze drifted back to the girl he was obligated to advise. \"All ages learned what they could according to their skills. Factory-style learning wasn't the rule.\"\n\n\"Now it is,\" insisted the principal.\n\n\"It's normal for a person to become anxious after being involved in a fight.\" Now he was nodding to his own point. That wasn't a good sign. He couldn't help it. \"It's normal to get depressed about being alienated from your old friends. It's normal to be unhappy in a class that bores you. Did you ever stop to think about that?\"\n\n\"Not really.\"\n\n\"What I'm saying is,\" he continued, \"whatever your problems have been, we've dealt with them by treating you.\"\n\n\"That's the obvious approach,\" the principal offered. She had stopped propping herself against the wall. Her arms had unfolded, too.\n\n\"Yes, it's one thing you can truly control, yourself.\" With this much, he had to agree. \"Taking the self-improvement approach makes sense. You can manage your responses to these tough situations. But there's another plan of attack that's just as obvious.\"\n\n\"I'm working on getting better,\" the girl replied automatically.\n\n\"All I'm suggesting is,\" he made a calming motion with his hand and slowed his words, \"you should be open to the possibility that the problem isn't you.\"\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"When I Was Six\n\nReads: 596 \u00a0| Likes: 0 \u00a0| Shelves: 0 \u00a0| Comments: 1\n\nMore Details\nStatus: Finished \u00a0|\u00a0 Genre: Health and Fitness \u00a0|\u00a0 House: Booksie Classic\na short story about the downsides of living with diabetes as a child and teenager.\n\nSubmitted: January 27, 2009\n\nA A A | A A A\n\nSubmitted: January 27, 2009\n\n\n\nThinking about it, it seems really stupid that something that happened over 10 years ago can still make me screw my face up and cry like a baby (but silently because I don\u2019t want my flat mate to know that I\u2019m upset because it would be too hard to explain to her that I\u2019m crying about something that most people think is a breeze).\nI\u2019ve had diabetes since I was six. I was diagnosed just over a month after my birthday but was almost definitely suffering from it before my birthday, in fact I went into hospital two days before my little sisters fourth birthday.\nI have only two clear memories of pre-diabetes. The first one being that I was on the yellow table in reception and the second one is the memory of being in bed and being sick over the side (it was a bunk bed). I got out of bed to go and tell my mum and dad I\u2019d been sick and I remember my mum telling me I should have called her if I thought I was going to be sick instead of getting out of bed and being sick on the carpet. I remember thinking that I didn\u2019t get out of bed when I thought I was going to be sick I got out of bed after I\u2019d been sick and couldn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t know this. This memory must have been about 2 weeks before I was diagnosed.\nThe next thing I remember is being in hospital and having something put on my arm to stop me from moving the drip. When I realised what they\u2019d done I was quite annoyed because I sucked my thumb and it made it difficult. I remember being asleep and waking up to find two nurses trying to put pads on my chest, I\u2019m not sure what for but there was no way I was letting them so I pulled them off. I remember getting loads of get well cards from my classmates, all hand drawn. I still have the books with them all in. I remember my best friends grandparents coming to visit me and giving me a leopard puppet which I called Spotty, I don\u2019t remember my friend coming to visit me but I\u2019m sure she did. I remember playing a really good game on the computer and going away and coming back to find the computer gone, I was quite disappointed. I remember talking to the nurse as she took my drip out and it bled a bit more than it was supposed to. I remember the doctors stopping me from having my breakfast on the last day in hospital to see how I coped with low blood glucose. I remember the fact I had already chosen what I was having (Rice Crispies, no sugar, no sweetener, like I\u2019d had every day I\u2019d been in). I remember being really upset because I was really looking forward to my cereals. I don\u2019t remember the first time I tested my bloods. I don\u2019t remember my first injection. In fact, I don\u2019t remember my last one and that was yesterday. I don\u2019t remember any injection I\u2019ve ever done and I\u2019ve done lots.\nI remember being in school shortly after I was diagnosed and my sugars were high, the teachers didn\u2019t know what to do so they rang my GP who dealt with adults with type 2 diabetes. He told them not to give me any lunch. I was not pleased and have disliked that doctor ever since even though I now know he was just doing his job and it was probably the best thing they could do for me.\nI remember how whenever I went high I\u2019d get made to run around the playground. I remember my first proper hypo. I was at my grandma\u2019s house and the children had gone to bed but the adults were still up. I was being chased by a witch. She was chasing me down this yellow road trying to feed me poisonous cake. I was scared. Really scared. After running away from her for what must have been hours I reached the end of the road and the witch caught me. She forced the poisonous cake into my mouth pinning me onto the ground. I screamed to get a doctor, if she carried on feeding me this cake I was going to die. I woke up. I\u2019d been having a fit. The witch was my mum, the poisonous cake was hypostop to get my sugars back up quickly and I had actually told my parents to get a doctor. They thought it was because I was hypo, I told them it was because of the witch.\nI remember when I was about 9. I was in a reading competition with school were we had to recite a poem and I was also doing a bible reading. I was sitting in the teachers classroom near the corner and I was about to do my bible reading. I was feeling quite annoyed because I didn\u2019t want to do it. I wanted to go into the playground and play with my friends. I didn\u2019t like the teacher. I didn\u2019t want to reach my stupid bible verse. The next thing I remember is sitting in the library with my best friend next to me asking the teacher if they\u2019d checked my sugars (she was fantastic). They hadn\u2019t. She helped me check and they fed me something sugary. I remember my mum arriving; I can picture her walking through the doors. I remember a few days later walking to swimming club and the teacher told me she\u2019d saved my life. I knew she hadn\u2019t. I remember talking to my best friend about how she hadn\u2019t and she hadn\u2019t even thought to check my sugars. I remember laughing and I remember how we still laughed about it occasionally years later.\nI remember another time I had a hypo. Well, that is partially a lie. I remember waking up one morning with a pounding headache, feeling sick and incredibly ill. I remember my mum walking in and asking me if I was alright and wondering why she was asking, after all, as far as I knew why wouldn\u2019t I be, all that had happened the night before was I\u2019d forgotten to feed the rabbit. I have a memory of leaving the hutch open and the rabbit escaping but I don\u2019t know if that ever really happened. My mum told me I\u2019d gone unconscious the night before and I\u2019d ended up in casualty because I wasn\u2019t coming round. I was quite upset. I\u2019d always wanted to go in an ambulance and the one time I did I was unconscious.\nI remember going on a residential trip with school in year 6. They did a talent contest one night and one of the groups had done levitating (not real levitating may I add just something with making a square of people leaning on each other and removing the chairs that had been supporting them). I remember dreaming about how I couldn\u2019t levitate and waking up being scared still. I knew something was wrong and tried to call out to the people I was sharing a room with so they could help me but as much as I tried to scream I simply couldn\u2019t make a noise. I rolled to the side of my bed and tried to wake the person next to me but succeeding in smacking her in the face, which did actually wake her up, surprise surprise. I remember being given lots of sugary drinks and I remember being embarrassed because my bra was on the back of one of the chairs and my male head teacher had come into the room. I remember my mum saying when I spoke to her about it that it was hardly surprising I had taken so long to recover because they weren\u2019t giving me sugary enough stuff. I remember lots of other things in primary school, most of which are good but the ones which bother me the most have to be the ones I\u2019ve just described.\nI remember when my cousin got diabetes. I remember sitting in the back of the car talking to my mum about it and it was dark. I remember getting upset because I suddenly realised why she wasn\u2019t dealing with it as well as I did. I remember realising that she could remember not being diabetic and I couldn\u2019t. I remember not being sure whether this was a good thing or a bad thing. I know think it\u2019s a good thing. I think my mind has repressed the memory to protect me. it is easier for me to only remember being diabetic because then it doesn\u2019t feel like I have lost anything. But, I remember being upset when I realised that with the exception of a few, all my memories were when I had diabetes, not all about the diabetes, but all when I had it.\nI remember getting cross with my siblings because they learnt that when I said I felt low I usually got food so they used to say it. They didn\u2019t say it to be mean, simply because they wanted food and didn\u2019t understand. I remember one time it actually hurting when they did it because they really didn\u2019t understand.\nI remember high school. Don\u2019t get me wrong, most of my memories of high school are positive. I really enjoyed it and partly wish I could go back but it\u2019s not these memories I need to get out my system. It\u2019s the bad ones that need to leave.\nThere was this girl in my form called Jodie. She wasn\u2019t a very nice girl; in fact not very nice is a bit of an understatement. She was a bully. At Christmas in year 8 I went from doing two injections a day, one at breakfast and one at tea, to doing four injections a day, one at each meal and one before bed. This meant I had to inject at lunchtime in school. School were alright with me doing it in my form room and so I did. One day however Jodie decided to open her mouth and tell me I was disgusting because I had to do injections. This was obviously quite upsetting for me but I don\u2019t think I did anything about it. It was when, about a year later she made a similar comment which really upset me that I filled in an incident form and could have got her suspended. Another incident at school was when a lad called Myles told me it was my fault I had diabetes. Although in a sense it is, it\u2019s in my genes, the fact of the matter is it was an extremely insensitive comment to make, one which I recall landed him in a fair amount of trouble with my art teacher.\nI think the one thing that still amazes me is my music teacher. Children I can understand making comments, they don\u2019t understand and can, at times, be tactless, I know I certainly was but a teacher should know better. I had this music teacher called Miss Lunn. Now, Miss Lunn and I weren\u2019t best friends (for some reason she just didn\u2019t like me and made this obvious enough for me... (truncated)",

As for the Seven Star Building, it\u2019s simple, a pure killer organization, although there are not many people, but everyone is a master Especially yin, yang, etc But Dynasty, who had just watched the story under one person for less than a day, understood that You had come here All the way through, will be hereThe security guards were knocked diabetes medicines in Ayurvedic down, and the front desk was scared away.\n\nSir, what shall we do next? A middle-aged man dressed in black and a gentleman followed behind a delicate woman with fluttering blue hair on the bustling streets of the United States, and asked respectfully His name is Liwa, a former American physician who was framed for refusing to pay a bribe to the how to lower blood sugar levels diabetes Diabetes Emergency how do I lower my glucose level in the blood do cinnamon pills help lower blood sugar minister, and was almost killed innocently, so he gave up his allegiance to the United States and became loyal to her since control diabetes type 2 Diabetes Emergency type 2 diabetes drugs list Glimepiride high blood sugar he was rescued by Esders Fa-principle, The principle of magic, the phenomenon quick ways to lower blood sugarmedications used to control type 2 diabetes that distorts nature In contrast to the present, the truth of reality, physics, all normal natural phenomena.\n\nChao Dynasty understood what Will was going to say, waved his hand, and ordered casually Yes Lan and Will holistic medicines for type 2 diabetes responded, turned and left the room It\u2019s been half a month If no one comes, I have to wonder if Najeshtan has already given up on you.\n\nThey stretched out their hands and put their hands on She\u2019s neck, pressing her tightly on the high stool I Highness!

From her pink face to her twitchy fingers, it was extremely apparent that something was on her mind.\n\u201cYou are in a safe place, Rebecca. No one will judge you here. It\u2019s just you and I.\u201d His voice flowed like honey, soothing, sweet, yet thick. Rebecca didn\u2019t seem relieved in the slightest. In fact, she had become so fidgety with the coming of this new information that the usually over confident therapist began to doubt his vocal technique. However, he thought, in her defense, the irony behind that sentence was uncanny.\nFor a few moments he just sat watching her. She seemed to become more anxious as he watched, opening and closing her mouth periodically as if wanting to say something, but not quite knowing how to go about it. He wondered what sort of information was taking a hold of her like that. It had definitely taken control of her nervous system and need he even mention her appearance? When words actually found their way through to her vocal cords, the therapist actually raised his eyebrow in surprise.\n\u201cHe\u2026\u201d she started. What was it? Rape? Beatings? Verbal abuse? Life threats? Surely he had heard it all\u2026 \u201cHe\u2019s leaving me.\u201d Hmmm\u2026 Shocked still. He heard this and was momentarily disappointed.\n\u201cAnd how do you feel about that?\u201d What a therapist-like response. He needed to say something to guise his boredom, but it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t already know. The disappointment settled. He would never admit it, but he was actually hoping for a rape victim. He hadn\u2019t had one in a while.\n\u201cI feel\u2026 I feel a bit shaken up.\u201d\nAnd there it was. As if by queue, her feet, her hands, and all the rest of her body stopped their incessant movements.\n\u201cMmmmhmmm,\u201d he replied pretending to write down notes with his pen while really secretly using the ballpoint to mimic the unflattering shape of her head.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Way of the Serpent \u2013 Chapter\u00a02\n\n\n2125 marked the centenary of the entry of the miracle age prophylaxis Chulel into the marketplace. The occasion probably should have been marked by a celebration of some sort, but so few people remembered what life was like before Chulel that it would have seemed rather like commemorating the invention of water or air. So the year would come and go without fanfare.\n\nTwo people who did remember life before Chulel were the inventors of the drug, Drs. Max and Emily Feldman, who had lost their only child to Hutchinson-Guilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) back in 1977. \u201cProgeria\u201d referred to a set of diseases that caused premature aging due to a genetic anomaly; HGPS had been its most common (though still extremely rare) form.\n\nThe Feldmans had delayed \u201chaving a family\u201d as people used to say, until after they both completed med school. Following their daughter\u2019s death, they had devoted their careers to finding a cure for progeria. It had been a long haul. The first significant advance had come from another lab, which announced a promising new avenue of research in 2014. Pharmakon Corporation, and specifically the Drs. Feldman, built on this and in 2017 published preliminary results of a drug they named according to its active chemical components. Nobody now remembers that name.\n\nThe drug was ready for human trials by early 2018, and a dozen or so families from around the world came forward, traveling to the Pharmakon headquarters in Atlanta to let the Feldmans try out the drug on their afflicted sons and daughters, who had been diagnosed with either HGPS or one of the other, even rarer, forms of progeria.\n\nWhat nobody knew was that Max Feldman was also testing the drug on himself. Even Emily didn\u2019t know. Max Feldman was already 78 and although he checked out healthy enough, he had a family history of heart disease and atherosclerosis and there were certain aspects of the lab tests on the new drug as well as its effects on a small test group of bonobos that had irresistibly piqued his curiosity.\n\nBy the time the tests on human progeria patients were declared unequivocally successful in 2021, the people closest to him were beginning to notice something about Max. One of those people was the Feldmans\u2019 lab assistant, Winslow Morris.\n\nIn the third month of the trials, Winslow noted that there seemed to be a couple of vials of the drug missing. He questioned Dr. Max about it, and was told it must be a mistake. When Winslow re-counted the next day against the numbers in the computer, he found no discrepancy. It happened again a couple of months later and this time Winslow kept his observation to himself. Again, the numbers mysteriously rectified themselves within a matter of hours. Then one day Winslow thought he saw Dr. Max slipping a vial of the medicine into the pocket of his lab coat. That\u2019s when it clicked. Winslow started observing Dr. Max more closely. On the day before the results of the progeria field tests were formally announced, Winslow missed work. And then he disappeared altogether.\n\nWinslow hadn\u2019t needed to steal any of the medicine. He knew how to make it. His destination was China and within six months a new drug started showing up on the streets. It was called \u201cFontana\u201d and it was touted as the \u201cfountain of youth\u201d. It was outrageously expensive and sold mainly to customer lists Winslow compiled by irrupting into databases of dermatologists specializing in cosmetic surgery. He was an instant millionaire.\n\nWinslow did not know that Dr. Feldman had altered the dosage for his own use. Fontana consumers were overdosing, and before the drug had been on the street for a full year, its reputation went into free fall. People who were self-medicating with this black market miracle potion started to develop strange skin disorders, unexplained neuropathies, and a vulnerability to infection, all of which ended up on the list of warnings regarding possible side effects when the first generation of the real drug went on the market in 2025 under the name \u201cChulel.\u201d\n\nWinslow was sorry about all this. It cut his income stream down to nothing. But he took his multi millions and his remaining stocks of Fontana and fled.\n\nRead Chapter 3\u2026\n\nKeep reading!
