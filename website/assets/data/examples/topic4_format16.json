Keep in mind that I\u2019ve had access to his knowledge in various ways for over 20 years! I\u2019ve read hundreds of online lessons and had thousands of online and telephone conversations with him about technique, theory, line-building and more. Even so, there\u2019s new material for me in Teach Me Bass Guitar.\n\nEven in the early lessons, I was reminded of concepts that needed a little review. In the later lessons, I refined techniques that were weak, and learned new concepts, techniques and theory.\n\nSo if this old dog \u2013 who has forty years on the instrument, and 25 years as a pro \u2013 can learn new tricks from Teach Me Bass Guitar, imagine what you can learn!\n\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one who has many years on the instrument who finds serious value in the course. Every week, I hear from other Teach Me Bass Guitar students who have been playing 5, 10, 20 years and more, and they love the course!\n\nI kid you not, I\u2019m self-taught and have been playing bass over thirty years\u2026and by disc 3 I was learning stuff I never knew before! I can\u2019t wait for my next session! ~ David C., Boston, MA\n\nRoy Vogt is amazing! This would be a good set for even the most advanced bassist to have around. There is no such thing as being too good, or knowing everything. Plus it\u2019s always good to brush up on all the stuff you learned years ago & vaguely remember learning. ~ R. Lester, OK\n\nThank you for TMBG, I am learning everything and more that I wanted to learn about playing the Bass, best of all I get to do it on my time, in my home. I did take 4 months of lessons, one \u00bd hour session per week at a cost of close to $400 dollars. I am learning more, faster with TMBG. It is the most cost effective way I know of to learn to play the bass, and I can go back over items to refresh my brain at any time I need to. The big bonus is I get to jam with a real band to feel what that is like before I go live and face the crowds, and I enjoy the pep talk at the beginning of each session. Thanks Again for a great, professionally designed product. ~ John Bachelor, Hilliard, OH\n\n\nBuy Teach Me Bass Guitar Now \u2013 Save 25%!!\n\n\nReal-Time Fretboard for Teach Me Bass Guitar\n\nReal-Time Fretboard\n\nThe real-time fretboard makes it very easy to see where to place your fingers.\n\n\nLoop Library\n\nAccess the Loop Library at any time.\n\nThis is one of the coolest features of Teach Me Bass Guitar. As Roy plays a riff on the electric bass, you see the actual notes, played in sequence as Roy plays them! Even the letter values are displayed \u2013 all on a graphical on-screen fretboard. You won\u2019t believe how much easier this makes the learning process. Every dot teaches you where to put your finger and the name of the note \u2013 at the same time! That\u2019s just one of the ways Teach Me Bass Guitar is changing how we learn for the better. And there\u2019s more where that came from\u2026Roy presents a lot in each lesson, so there\u2019s only time to play each exercise once. But you\u2019ll want to play them a lot. No problem! Jump to the Loop Library, and play the exercise as many times as you like, with Roy playing right along with you. You\u2019ll know an exercise is in the Loop Library when the moon to the right of the fretboard (Ralph) turns blue.Just press enter on your DVD remote, or click on him with your mouse to jump straight to that loop. Here\u2019s a tip: I always tell my own students to play an exercise perfectly, ten times in a row. That way, you know you know it. That might take you a few sessions to perfect, but if you stick with it, the results are well worth the effort!\n\nSo, we have a magic fretboard, a moon that turns blue, and an extensive Loop Library of every exercise, song tutorial, and play-along track with Roy\u2019s Urban Legend Band of top session pros. And that\u2019s just for starters. Are you starting to see just how amazing Teach Me Bass Guitar is?\n\nGet Teach Me Bass Guitar Today\nand Get Started Learning Bass!\n\nJust thought I\u2019d drop you a line to let you know how I\u2019m getting on with this awesome product. I have never enjoyed anything as much as I\u2019m enjoying learning bass (with TMBG). You just don\u2019t get this quality of tuition anywhere else that I\u2019m aware of. To be able to sit in a room with someone of Roy\u2019s talent and ability is incredible. The benefits of this are amazing. You can learn at your own pace, you can feel dumb and no one else knows, you can play the same lesson over and over and you only pay once. And it\u2019s very easy to understand and being able to play along with a world class band gives you the confidence to be able to go and look for people to jam with. I\u2019m well pleased with the product and with my progress and the price is another bonus. There is only one more thing you could add, an autographed poster-sized portrait of Ashley!\u201d ~ Michael Toomey, Sydney, Australia\n\nAlthough I am not yet to lesson 4 of Teach Me Bass Guitar, I really do like the program so far, and am very anxious to get back at it. And that is one of the great features of this program, the ability to stop and jump back in at your own pace. I\u2019m working on it, and feel it was a great choice for me to further my knowledge and ability on the bass. ~ K. Chrona, Sydney Australia\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that TMBG looks very professional. It is well thought out and Roy is an excellent teacher. He makes even the advanced stuff easy to understand. ~ Mike Hopper, Madison, IN, USA\n\nBuy Teach Me Bass Guitar\nand Try it for 90 DAYS!!\n\nFREE Skype Call when you order TMBG\n\nIf you order TMBG through this page, I\u2019ll schedule a Skype call with you once your package has arrived to help you get the most our of your course. If you don\u2019t Skype, we\u2019ll have a phone call instead.\n\nPlay Along with a Top Studio Band\n\nBeginning with Lesson 2, every lesson includes two original songs by Roy based on the concepts from that lesson. It\u2019s amazing! For starters, this isn\u2019t some bunch of Muzak Drones that couldn\u2019t hold a groove if you glued it to their hands, limping through some lame excuse of a song. These guys eat Master Sessions for lunch! Take a look at the video below, shot in June, 2009 at The Low Show during the Summer NAMM. That\u2019s me playing 2nd Bass with Roy the Urban Legend Band \u2013 t... (truncated)",
