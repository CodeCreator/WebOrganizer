To help you decide if working for ActionLink is right for you, we have provided some detailed information about what it takes to be a great merchandiser for ActionLink.\n\nWhat does an ActionLink Merchandiser do?\n\nActionLink is a retail services organization that provides merchandising execution in retail locations throughout the country and we work with the latest consumer electronics. We are hired by retailers and by product manufacturers to complete merchandising projects all over the country. If selected, you would be assigned a territory using a radius from your home base and would have responsibility for all merchandising projects scheduled to be completed in those stores.\n\nOur company specializes in consumer electronics.\u00a0 This means that ActionLink Merchandisers work with the latest technologies which can include: computers\/laptops, tablets, mobile devices, TV and home theater, audio equipment, appliances and more.\n\nGeneral duties include but not limited to:\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring product is stocked and visibly appealing\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Setting product to planogram\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Auditing displays and stock according to planogram\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Install interactive displays for consumer electronics\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Troubleshoot displays and display components\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other merchandising duties as assigned\n\nWhat days & hours will I work?\n\nProjects in the assigned territory must be completed during the week they are scheduled. Typically, our merchandisers receive about 10 - 15\u00a0hours of work each week. \u00a0With very few exceptions, you control the dates and times that you complete the projects assigned to you between Tuesday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM.\u00a0 Our merchandising reps enjoy our flexibility in scheduling.\n\nWhat does it take to be an ActionLink Merchandiser?\n\nMerchandisers must be organized, motivated, self-starters who can work independently and be counted on to get their work done on time, every time in the best possible way.\n\nActionLink has a great relationship with our clients, so it is important that each of our merchandisers have outstanding customer service skills.

Occasional use of ladders may be required.\n\nOur merchandisers work quickly and efficiently using their smart devices and personal computers to complete all project reporting, so having a smart device that uses an iOS or Android operating system and has a data plan is important. We also utilize a state-of-the-art web-based system so all employees need to have regular access to a computer with Internet access, email and a printer.\n\nIt is each merchandiser\u2019s responsibility to get to their work site, so reliable transportation is a must.\u00a0\n\nOnline training is provided for all merchandising employees.\u00a0 We also support our reps in the field via our phone in call center.\u00a0 While our merchandisers work independently, they are not alone.\n\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Must be at least 18 years of age\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Must be legally authorized to work in the U.
