        "text":"New Car\/Review\n\n\n\n\nHowever popular sport utility vehicles may be, there are still plenty of would-be buyers out there who simply don't want the bulk and high running costs associated with many conventionally-sized (read big!) models. It's for these people that Suzuki has developed its all-new 1999 Grand Vitara - a compact, easy-to-handle SUV that offers surprising handling and performance and very commendable styling. And given the recent flurry of news reports about the ''environmental impact'' of SUVs, Suzuki could be poised to build some serious market share with its new rig.\n\nSuzuki has a long-standing reputation for producing compact, affordable SUVs that offer go-anywhere capability, ease of handling and low running costs. The four door Grand Vitara is bigger than any of its Sidekick and Samurai predecessors, but it still falls into a compact category in the SUV market. Even so, it'll handle almost any chore the bigger rigs are capable of.\n\nIt certainly gives up nothing in styling to its more expensive rivals. It looks great from every angle and has a purposeful, wide-track, brawny stance that I find really attractive. Many models come with a very attractive two-tone paint job. The Grand Vitara doesn't look compact until you put it alongside a Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Explorer. Although this is a relatively inexpensive SUV, it gives visual the impression of being quite upscale.\n\nRugged composite bodyside cladding, which extends around the wheel arches, is an excellent protective feature and it looks good too. The rear door swings open and provides easy access to a roomy cargo deck - which can be expanded by folding the back seats. I'm no fan of tailgate-mounted spare wheels, but the Vitara's is at least full-sized and the setup does create more room inside. I suppose that with a compact SUV, there just isn't the room to locate the spare either inside or under the load deck.\n\nOne thing I didn't warm to was the power door lock arrangement. Although the key will lock all the doors, it only opens the driver's side. You have to reach inside and fiddle with a button while your passengers stand around in the rain. I found this a constant annoyance and wished that Suzuki had opted for a more convenient setup.\n\nThe Grand Vitara is powered by a very satisfying 155 horsepower V-6 that proved to be surprisingly refined on the highway and quite a ''stump-puller'' off-road. It's quite a bit more powerful than its Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 rivals in the compact class. The Suzuki's V-6 is a sophisticated little motor with four cams and 24 valves working away inside. Not too many SUVs - especially inexpensive ones like the Grand Vitara - boast such a high-tech powerplant.\n\nI did some serious off -road drives over very demanding territory with the Grand Vitara and it came through showing almost Jeep-like capability. I drove the vehicle on one day-long foray into the mountains around Whistler, crossing old washed-out logging roads and negotiating steep boulder-strewn grades. This little rig will take you just about anywhere when the going gets rough and no owner should feel hesitant about taking a Grand Vitara into the boonies..\n\nMy tester, which I drove for an extended period incidentally, was equipped with a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission which didn't seem to clip off too much power. Four wheel drive - high or low range - is engaged with a secondary shift lever and there are no locking hubs to grapple with. You can also order your Grand Vitara with a 5-speed manual gearbox. Interestingly, neither the CR-V or the RAV4 offer a two-speed transfer case - even as an option. They don't offer a V-6 engine either and Suzuki undercuts them both on price.\n\nAiding performance on and off-road is an all-new 5-link rear suspension. Tackling a couple of runs up and down the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler, I was amazed at the Grand Vitara's handling prowess. It powers round tight turns like a decent sedan - and maybe a little more competently than some.\n\nBraking is taken care of with front discs and rear drums and ABS is standard - not always the case in this class. Other features include dual air bags, side impact beams and three-point seatbelts at all outboard positions. Rear passengers also get head restraints, which must be removed when setting up the truck for full cargo capacity. My tester was trimmed in a good-looking and seemingly durable cloth which was comfortable and easy to keep clean.\n\nThe snazzy exterior is complemented by an excellent cabin with clear instruments, easy-to-reach controls, lots of oddment space and more headroom than any Stetson-clad cowboy - or gal - could wish for.\n\nI drove this Grand Vitara over a three-month period, on and off road, and it never missed a beat. The test didn't reveal a single flaw, which says a lot for a small automaker that seems to be making a big name for itself. A base Grand Vitara costs a very reasonable $22,995 (CDN), though options can push it close to thirty grand. Suzuki will soon launch a less expensive ''standard'' Vitara in short wheelbase two-door form. This model will also come as a convertible like its Sidekick predecessor.\n\nHome | Buyers Guides By Make | New Car Buyers Guide | Used Car Super Search | Total New Car Costs | Car Reviews Truck Reviews\nAutomotive News | TACH-TV | Media\u00a0Library | Discount Auto Parts\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1996-2015 The Auto Channel.

General Motors Corporation bought Rapid along with the Reliance Motor Truck Company, and in 1912, the marque 'GMC Truck' was first shown at the New York International Auto Show. During World War II, GMC Truck produced trucks for the United States, and by the middle of the century, GMC had expanded into producing coaches, transit buses, emergency vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and motor homes. Between 1962 and 1972, most GMC vehicles were equipped with quad headlights, and Chevrolet trucks were equipped with dual headlights. In 1973, GM\u2019s introduced the 'rounded line' series, which set the standard for the Chevrolet\/GMC line of trucks for over 30 years, and sister models from both brands shared most features except trim and sticker price. The year 2007 saw a divergence in style once again between the two brands. GMC's trucks, vans, and SUVs offer more options and standard features than Chevrolet's vehicles, which are positioned as entry-level offerings. Today, GMC remains a venerable automobile manufacturer that produces SUVs, light- to heavy-duty pickup trucks, and vans.\n\n\n1983 GMC Vandura G-1500 RWD 165\u00a0hp (123\u00a0kW) 275\u00a0ft\u00b7lb (373\u00a0Nm) 5049\u00a0lb (2290\u00a0kg) 55% 5.7\u00a0L\n1991 GMC Syclone AWD 280\u00a0hp (209\u00a0kW) 360\u00a0ft\u00b7lb (488\u00a0Nm) 3613\u00a0lb (1639\u00a0kg) 63% 4.3\u00a0L\n1992 GMC Typhoon AWD 280\u00a0hp (209\u00a0kW) 360\u00a0ft\u00b7lb (488\u00a0Nm) 3800\u00a0lb (1724\u00a0kg) 57% 4.3\u00a0L\n\n\n\n  1.

Losquadro, Councilwoman Jane Bonner and Councilwoman Valerie Cartright have announced the completion of a 19-road paving project in Coram\u2019s W-section.\n\nCaption: Councilwoman Cartright, Superintendent Losquadro and Councilwoman Bonner on Whitmore Lane in Coram.\n\n\nIn addition to the milling and paving of 19 roads, this project involved extensive concrete work prior to paving. Crews installed more than 15,080 square feet of aprons and 3,000 linear feet of curb at a cost of $323,726. With the milling and paving costs of $992,636, the total cost for this paving project was $1.3 million.\n\n\nRoads paved during this project include Birchfield Court, Catherine Street, Elm Avenue, Linden Street, Walton Way, Welbourn Lane, Welling Way, Wellsley Court, Wellsley Lane, Westbrook Road, Whinstone Street, Whitfield Lane, Whitmore Lane, Whitney Lane, William Street, Wilmont Turn, Woodbine Street, Wycomb Court, and Wycomb Place.\n\n\nSuperintendent Losquadro said, \u201cBecause of the size of this neighborhood \u2013 and the state of deterioration of so many of the roadways \u2013 it was necessary to split this paving project into two phases. I was happy to complete phase one, bringing much relief to area residents and motorists, and I look forward to returning to this neighborhood to complete phase two next year.\u201d\n\n\nCouncilwoman Bonner said, \u201cThanks to the men and women of the Highway Department, these newly paved roads are ready for the winter months. The safety of our residents is a top priority and I will continue to work with Superintendent Losquadro to identify roads that need repaving in the future.\u201d\n\n\nCouncilwoman Cartright said, \u201cThe Highway Department continues to work its way through the Town to address paving concerns throughout Brookhaven. This project, which is in a central area of Brookhaven, is a positive continuation of the long-term efforts to address all of Brookhaven's 3,500 miles of roadway.\u201d",

All I know is that I was only getting 2300 RPM on takeoff and it took me 4,000' to break ground on a hot day in Denver. The big difference was the glide performance. At best glide speed my rate of descent was 1,800 fpm with the 3-blade Catto and only 200 fpm with the two blade.

        "text":"Upcoming Nissan Cars in India\n\nNissan\u2019s present range of cars in India is starting to look old. The manufacturer has to add new products to its portfolio. While the GT-R will help Nissan to improve its image, it is not the car that will increase sales. In the coming few years, Nisaan along with its sister company Datsun will launch new models and new variants of existing products.\n\nHere is a list of upcoming Nissan cars in India:\n\nNissan X-Trail\n\nThis will be the first launch by Nisaan in 2017. X-Trail will be a SUV and it is expected to launch by the end of 2017. Nissan sold the past gen X-Trail in India, but due to poor demand, it was taken off the shelves. The new model expected to launch will be a hybrid.\n\nAlso Read\u00a0Upcoming Chevrolet Cars in India\n\nExpected Launch Date End 2017\nEstimated Price Rs. 25-30 lakh\nEngine Options 2.0 L Petrol + Electric Hybrid\n\nNissan Kicks\n\nKicks small SUV is the second entry in our list of upcoming Nisaan cars in India. It is available for sale in Brazil, and is competing with the Hyundai Creta. With the launch of the Kicks, Nissan might think about discontinuing the Terrano as they will be in the same price range. It is expected to be launched in 2018. Both diesel and petrol options will be available.\n\nAlso Read\u00a0Top 5 Upcoming Cars In India\n\nExpected Launch Date First half 2018\nEstimated Price Rs. 10-14 lakh\nEngine Options 1.6 L Petrol\/1.5 L Diesel\n\nNew Micra\n\nThe next gen Micra that was showcased recently is a lot different than its current model. The curvy lines of the current model has been replaced by sharp creases and aggressive look. Micra might not get launched in India, because Nissan won\u2019t be able to keep prices in check. But, if it does, the launch will take place in 2018.\n\nExpected Launch Date 2018\nEstimated Price Rs 6-8 lakh\nEngine Options 1.2 L Petrol\/1.5 L Diesel\n\nUpcoming Nissan Cars in India\n\nModel Estimated Price Expected Launch Date\nX-Trail Rs. 25-30 lakh Early 2017\nKicks Rs. 10-14 lakh Early 2018\nNew Micra Rs. 6-8 lakh 2018\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Dr. Loren Groff at the NTSB.\n\nThe NTSB\u2019s meeting on the 2009 Red Line Crash continued this afternoon with even more troubling revelations. They also criticized the Board\u2019s lack of safety oversight, which seems unfair for before the crash, but the Board does need to step up now that they know there are problems.\n\nWMATA top management seems to have tragically ignored safety warnings and potential problems for years. The systems generated 8000 \u201calarms\u201d from track circuit errors per week, but according to the NTSB, WMATA safety officials ignored these problems because they assumed the system was \u201cfailsafe.\u201d\n\nSome train operators were instructed to run their trains on manual because there were problems with automatic operation, and operators were being punished for delays.\n\nHowever, NTSB staff also blamed the Board for not doing more on safety. NTSB member Robert Sumwalt also repeatedly brought up the Board\u2019s role during questioning. According to one presentation by Loren Groff, they felt the Board should have not only asked tough questions of top management, but gone around them to conduct their own investigations into the safety operation of the organization.\n\nThat seems unrealistic. It\u2019s probably true the Board could have asked more tough questions. They could have commissioned an Inspector General\u2019s report. But they asked safety questions of the General Manager and got what seemed like satisfactory answers.\n\nAccording to the NTSB discussion, the Board asked the General Manager to explain the top safety incidents and what was being done about them. The Board sees itself as a policy-making body, and doesn\u2019t meddle in day to day operations. Asking the GM for a safety summary seems like the right approach. If the GM\u2019s summary was misleading, it would be nice if Board members had psychically divined this, but it\u2019s hard to see how exactly they could have.\n\nSumwalt also criticized the way the WMATA Board has a committee on Customer Service, Operations, and Safety. \u201cWe at the NTSB only focus on safety,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that committee has to balance customer service with safety.\u201d Yes. It should. Customer service and safety are both important. The NTSB may have the luxury of ignoring everything but safety, but that doesn\u2019t mean that boards or agencies can do so.\n\nThe Board could have constantly asked the General Manager what the agency was doing to comply with NTSB recommendations, said Groff. But we know that many of those recommendations were financially unrealistic. The NTSB members might wish that everyone spent all their time sitting around and only worrying about safety and nothing else, but that\u2019s not how it works in reality.\n\nAnother NTSB member noted that in a hearing, Board Chairman Peter Benjamin previous Board Chairman Jim Graham said he hadn\u2019t heard of the Tri-State Oversight Committee before the crash, though then-General Manager John Catoe was well aware of it. But few of us out in the public had heard of it either. The TOC, by all accounts, operated in obscurity and for some strange reason didn\u2019t feel it could talk to the Board or the public.\n\nWe were all ignorant of the safety problems before the crash. Now, following investigations, it\u2019s clear that there were many organizational problems within WMATA, and the TOC wasn\u2019t functioning properly. I wish that the Board or other leaders had found out and fixed it, but it\u2019s hard to throw stones at leaders who only knew what we knew, and we didn\u2019t know about the problem.\n\nThe fault lies with General Manager Catoe and the safety officials at WMATA. Now, knowing this was such an issue, the Board does have a responsibility to ensure it gets fixed. Now, the Board should delve more deeply into the progress the agency is making on safety. Now, they shouldn\u2019t be satisfied with vague answers from management.\n\nAnd now, if future crashes happen that could have been prevented, it would be fair to blame the Board if they don\u2019t take adequate action. I\u2019m not sure that stepped-up level of oversight is happening. The NTSB said that even today, the Board doesn\u2019t claim responsibility for safety. They\u2019re right that this should change. It should start now.\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve revised the headline and intro paragraph to reflect some further thoughts on what the Board needs to do going forward.\n\nDavid Alpert is Founder and President of Greater Greater Washington and Executive Director of DC Sustainable Transportation (DCST).

        "text":"Arizona bill to split car and truck speeds dies\n\n| Wednesday, April 09, 2008\n\nA bill that has died in the Arizona House sought to require large trucks traveling along certain stretches of interstates to slow down by 5 mph. It missed a deadline to advance from committee, effectively killing it for the year.\n\nState law now allows all traffic to drive 65 mph on interstate highways outside urban areas with populations of at least 50,000. The Arizona Department of Transportation also can set speeds on rural portions of interstates at 75 mph.\n\nKyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, introduced a bill that would have slowed large trucks by 5 mph along interstates posted with 65 mph speed limits. The measure \u2013 HB2314 \u2013 required vehicles in excess of 26,000 pounds declared gross weight to drive 60 mph.\n\nAll other vehicles would have been allowed to continue to travel at the current 65 mph speed limit.\n\nSupporters said requiring trucks to drive at speeds slower than over vehicles would make for safer travel.\n\nOpponents said slowing trucks down to speeds slower than other vehicles does not promote safety on the highways. In fact, they said it does exactly the opposite by requiring that vehicles are constantly in conflict with each other.\n\nWord of the bill\u2019s demise was well received by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association.\n\nOOIDA Executive Vice President Todd Spencer pointed out that 40 states now have uniform speed limits for all vehicles using their highways. \u201cThe only speed limit policy that makes any sense is the kind that has all vehicles traveling at the same speed,\u201d he told Land Line.\n\nThe effort to reduce truck speed limits can be brought back for consideration during the 2009 session.\n\nTo view other legislative activities of interest for Arizona, click here.\n\n\u2013 By Keith Goble, state legislative editor",
