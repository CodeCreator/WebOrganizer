I've been reading and researching the genus: Varanoid Lizards of the World, Giant Lizards, I've subscribed to Biawak Journal and have been researching online as well.\n\nWhen I was a boy, I captured and kept snakes (Garter snakes, Fox snakes), salamanders (Eastern Spotted and Tiger) and bought and kept several American lizards (Anole, Fence Swift and a Desert Spiny Lizard, with varying successes and failures. The Fox snakes, Anoles and salamanders thrived but I had bad luck with the non-native to my region Swift and desert lizards. I released the salamaders and fox snakes back into the wild before heading off to University.\n\nNow, many years later, my love of herps has been rekindled and I find myself drawn to Varanids in particular. I have begun building my first reptile enclosure, a 4' x 2' x 2' which I hope is a decent minimum size for one Ackie or a temporary enclosure for one or two of them. I'm not a woodworker or a carpenter so this has been a challenge for me which is why I had opted for a very simple enclosure for my first build. I've measured out a max size enclosure that I can fit into my apartment at 8' long by 3' wide and up to 6' high that I intended to build for a Quince monitor, but I think I'll build something in that space for my future Ackies to move into.\n\nI intend to first build and setup an enclosure, get it running with a bio-active substrate and then see if I can maintain an optimal thermal gradient and humidity levels. When I'm satisfied I'm able to do that, then I'll start looking for a young Ackie from a reputable breeder. I expect I'll have a lot of questions and I'm open to all of the advice the users of this forum might have for me. Thank you for accepting me as a new member of the forum.\n\nKevLuvsMonitors is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\nLogin to remove ads\nOld 06-29-18, 03:38 PM \u00a0 #2 (permalink)\nJoin Date: Nov-2014\nPosts: 462\nRe: New to monitors and seeking advice\n\nI don't have experience with ackies but I did have a savannah monitor. Care is similar.\n\nAckies need 12\" of soil in the bottom of the cage. Ackies are big into burrowing, so don't go crazy with layering your substrate, the lizard will just tear it up.\n\nThey also need basking spots with a surface temperature between 130 and 150F, so keep that in mind. One end of the cage will be unable to support much plant life due to that heat and it's drying effect.\nchairman is offline \u00a0 Reply With Quote\n\nThread Tools\nDisplay Modes\n\nPosting Rules\nYou may not post new threads\nYou may not post replies\nYou may not post attachments\nYou may not edit your posts\n\nBB code is On\nSmilies are On\n[IMG] code is On\nHTML code is Off\nTrackbacks are On\nPingbacks are On\nRefbacks are On\n\nAll times are GMT -6.

But it's all on its own one side of the landing whilst the other side looks bare Sad.\n\nI don't have sufficient prunings to make another similar one, so I had to think of something else. Undecided\n\nWell, I use a lot of string in the garden, maybe one of those string vase things would be appropriate. So I tried it. Wink Easy enough to do, especially because I chose a very straight sided jar.\n\nIt's nice, but doesn't feel finished yet. It needs some ornamentation, but I haven't decided what yet. Maybe something to bring outside in?\n\nLook twice, buy once.

        "text":"Jump to content\n\nSIAI Marchetti, Planet Models, 1\/72\n\nRecommended Posts\n\nAfter holding\u00a0off the request to build a model for a friend for a long time, he still persuaded me, not only for one, but for 2. Both are Marchetti's\u00a0in 1\/72 and 1\/48. This is the construction of the 1\/72 version.\n\nThe SIAI-Marchetti SF.260 is an Italian\u00a0light aircraft, used for performing aerobatics and as a military trainer. The aircraft was designed by Stelio Frati for the Aviamilano company in 1963-'64, and the first prototype flew\u00a0 July 15y as the F.260. Before it entered production the design was sold to SIAI Marchetti.\n\n\nIn 1969 the Belgian airforce bought 32 aircraft which were located at Goetsenhoven Airbase and after closure of the base were relocated to Beauvechain airbase. The aircraft was used as a trainer and for the stuntteam the red devils.\n\n\nThe kit is from Planet Models:\n\n\nand the layout he wants\n\n\nThe kit only has a few parts:\n\n\n\nBiggest disadvantage is the hull being cast solid... which makes it very, very tailheavy...\n\n\nso I started by cutting the hull in two and drilled out (regular drill, I know, a Dremel would be more handy for this...) as far as I dared\n\n\n\n\nthe extra hole was an accident... superglue and sprue will solve this\n\nThe other side was also hollowed out:\n\n\n\nstill lokking pretty thick, but it is only 1mm in reality.\n\nNext up I rejoined the hull parts sanded these smooth and added the rudder and elevators. Then I drilled some holes in the nose to add some fishing lead. One large horizontal hole and a few vertical ones.\u00a0\u00a0Allas ... still not enough it seems, close, but not completely...\n\n\n\nnext session is closing up the rear bulkhead and the interior\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, just a longshot, camo colors are olive green and stone, but it seems some aircraft have a third color. Could it be complete vietnam camo on this bird? Other qiestion are about the interior. Were these early versions, before the overhaul and lightgrey interior equiped with a complete black interior and instrument panel? Not a lot of info and pictures are available from those days, and pictures show mostly the interior after the upgrade (complete lightgrey interior), and sometimes completely black or black with a lightgrey instrument panel... questions, still a lot of questions...\n\n\n  \u2022 Like 2\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nI\u2019m watching this very closely, as I\u2019ve done three dogfighting sessions\u00a0in one of Air Combat USA\u2019s\u00a0SF260s\u00a0and have this kit in my stash, planning on building it to match the aircraft I flew.\n\n- Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Like 2\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\n\nA bit of progress:\n\nThe backseat was completely smooth, so I used a scriber to add some detail\n\n\n\nNext I've cut up some paper to make the backwall. To make it some more solid, I've drenched it with thin CA. Next it was sanded smooth and painted. There's no PE in this kit, so I've made the seatbelts from prepainted paper.\n\n\n\nThe 1\/48 has some bars on the frontseat for the passengers. Made these from some copperwire\n\n\n\n\nAnd all mounted into the interior:\n\n\n\n\nand just a complete overview to give a comparison of\u00a0the size and the lead jigsaw:\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Like 3\nLink to post\nShare on other sites\nOn 8\/1\/2020 at 3:07 PM, Silenoz said:\n\nBy the way, just a longshot, camo colors are olive green and stone, but it seems some aircraft have a third color.
