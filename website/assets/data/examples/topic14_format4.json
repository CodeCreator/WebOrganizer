        "text":"My photo\nA very warm welcome to my teeny, tiny part of the huge world of blogging. This is where I share my passion for making hand made greeting cards. So - why \"Always with a Heart\"? Well this is for two reasons. Firstly, it is because every card I produce carries a heart on it somewhere. This can be big and bold or small and almost hidden - the fun sometimes is just trying to find it! Secondly it is because I put my heart into everything I produce. I hope that any visitors enjoy seeing what I post. If you drop by then please leave me a comment so that I know you called. It would be nice to know that you have found my heart in what I do.\n\nTuesday, 6 November 2012\n\n\nHi Everyone\n\nI hope today has been a good day for you.\n\nFor me it was the day that the Ghost of Christmas Past made an appearance .. .. or should I say \"Christmases Past\". \u00a0\n\nWhat form did this ghost take?\n\nWell the same form it takes every year .. .. as the box of Christmas papers that seems to increase in size year on year. \u00a0We all know what it is like. \u00a0You see a lovely new paper stack with gorgeous papers .. .. but we never seem to use them all and put them away after Christmas ready for next year!! \u00a0\n\nMy box also contains digital papers I have printed out but not used, which makes using them on my blog very interesting as I have to remember where I have printed them from. \u00a0That's a good test for the old memory that's for sure!!!\n\nSo it may be that over the coming weeks some paper stacks may be making an appearance that now have antique value!\n\nBut tonight's papers for my share of the day are only one year old .. .. just a little baby!!! \u00a0LOL!!!\n\nThis used:\n\nImage: \u00a0Cuddly Buddly \"Santa Sitting\"\nSentiment: \u00a0Computer Generated using font \"Candy Buzz\"\nBacking Papers: \u00a0Dovecraft \"Noel\"\nMarianne Creatables Die: \u00a0Christmas Stars\nJosy Rose: \u00a0Nail Heads\nFlower Soft: \u00a0Polar White\nNestabilities: \u00a0Standard and Scalloped Circles\nHobbycraft Punch: \u00a0Small Snowflake\nGlamour Dust\nMetallic Cord from my Stash Box\n\nSo how big is your ghost of Christmases Past? \u00a0Or is it just me that hangs on to everything?!?!? \u00a0LOL!!\n\nThe jury is still out on the Flowersoft. \u00a0Not sure if it is a good look or not!\n\nCatch you again tomorrow .. .. hopefully a little earlier.\n\n\n\nCaroline said...\n\nThis is gorgeous Jules that santa is adorable and is coloured so beautifully and the layout is fabulous.

Another crackin' card, Jules!!\n\nlove Mags B x\n\nBeryl said...\n\nWell your Flowersoft looks great - each time I've tried it the image ends up in the bin - no matter how long I had spent colouring it.

Not too many recipients of my cards are crafters so they won't know, or care even, how long I've had them. I'm the same with my scrap pages. Let's face it, when my great-granddaughter is looking through my albums she is going to know that what she is looking at is old!\n\nBy the way, great card - love the Santa with all his fluffy trim and the papers are gorgeous. Hugs, Elizabeth xx\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nGorgeous Jules! The flowersoft looks lovely and just like fur.\n\nI have so many unused Christmas papers and some are older than Molly, lol!

Is this a Jack Russell?\n\nI received an email from Small Breed Rescue of East Tennessee wanting to know if I knew if this little cutie is a Jack Russell.\n\nThey needed to know so they could know what breed category to put him in. I wasn't sure. What do you think? After looking at the pictures, you can post your comments in the easy form below.\n\nAny experts out there?\n\njrt breed\n\nThey say, at this fine rescue group, that he is definitely a little spitfire.\n\njrt dog\n\nCase in point, he chases a 120 pound Great Pyre mix they have there! (Napoleon complex)\n\nThat definitely sounds Jack Russell.\n\nHis fore-arms, front paws and chest really have the JRT look to me.\n\nBut all I know for sure is that this little dog is adorable looking!\n\njack russell\n\nJack Russell Terrier Breed Standard\n\nThe Jack Russell Terrier breed standard varies based on the organization setting the standard. This includes the:\n\nDog Breeds Jack Russell Description\n\nIn general, a Jack Russell Terrier must meet certain criteria such as characteristics and general appearance in order to qualify as a member of the breed. \u00a0To aid in this process, parents and puppies are registered by Jack Russell breeders in order to avoid any qualitative judgments solely based on observation.\n\nJack Russell Terrier Characteristics:\n  \u2022 Personality: Active, alert, lively, fearless, happy\n  \u2022 Appearance: 10\" to 15\" at whithers (length between the shoulder blades). \u00a0Length in proportion to height.\n  \u2022 Head: In proportion to body. Flat skull, that narrows as it approaches the eyes. \u00a0Black nose. Powerful jaw.\n  \u2022 Eyes: almond shaped, dark\n  \u2022 Ears: v shape drop ears\n  \u2022 Mouth: strong teeth, top of mouth slightly over bottom of mouth\n  \u2022 Neck: muscular\n  \u2022 Hind: strong, muscular\n  \u2022 Feet, round, hard pads, wide, does not turn in or out from body\n  \u2022 Tail: High on body, length\u00a0about 4 inches\n  \u2022 Coat: Smooth, rough or broken, not woolly\n  \u2022 Color, white dominant color (great than 51%), marks can include brown, black or tan. \u00a0Never a striped marking pattern called brindle.\n  \u2022 Gait: Lively, straight from front to behind\n\nAnswering the Question: Is This a Jack Russell?\n\nOf course these are show standards representing the perfect dog, but in general a Jack should meet these criteria. \u00a0The same goes for criteria not listed in determining what is not a Jack Russell. For example, a dog that is shy, has narrow hips, appears weak, not curious, is not considered to the breed standard. \u00a0They should also not be confused with other breeds, the characteristics need to be distinct. \u00a0If you need help with your dog, you can post your picture and description using the form below. \u00a0We hope we help you get the answer to your \"is this a Jack Russell\" question.\n\nIs this a Jack Russell?\n\nSend us your pictures and stories, and we'll leave it to our readers to decide.\n\n[ ? ]\n\nUpload 1-4 Pictures or Graphics (optional)[ ? ]\n\n\nClick here to upload more images (optional)\n\nAuthor Information (optional)\n\nTo receive credit as the author, enter your information below.\n\n(first or full name)\n\n(e.g., City, State, Country)\n\nSubmit Your Contribution\n\n\u00a0submission guidelines.\n\n(You can preview and edit on the next page)\n\nWhat Other Visitors Have Said\n\nClick below to see contributions from other visitors to this page...\n\nI Rescued Her\u00a0\nI was told she may be jack Russell\/dachshund.

        "text":"\"My dog did the cutest thing...\"\n\n  1. What's YOUR story?\n\n    I was cleaning up today when I noticed a big red smear across my little dogs face. I have 3, but she's the smallest, a mix with a white face. I was worried she got into something but before I could check it out I hugged her to comfort her (or me, maybe) and put my face right into hers... on the side...\n\n    And thats when I realized my dog's red face was from my lipstick!! :p I haven't been wearing dark colours until lately with the new red craze started again, so I had never seen her little mug with red on it.\n\n    What has your puppy or kitten done that was so cute you had to tell someone but might have been a little embaressed? Tell us so I won't feel so embaressed now LoL :rolleyes:\n  2. Too cute! Wonder if she'll be trying out your eye shadow and perfume next? LOL!\n  3. OMG as long as I gave her the boxes, she'd be JUST as happy LoL :p :heart:\n  4. teehee .. That's pretty cute. :smile:\n  5. This is embarrassing but still pretty cute:\n    My puppy Sophie was in the groomers getting her nails clipped (I never leave her I always go with her and tell her how pretty she is so she doesn't get scared) ANYWAYS, when she was done she was sooo happy to get back into my arms again she peed on the floor and a little on my jeans. It was so cute because of how happy she was to see her mommy, but I still walked out with pee on my leg!!\n\n    HEHE still love her to pieces, I don't think there is much she can do that I would be upset about!\n  6. My pet Chewy was chasing after a fly. I saw him open his mouth and quickly closed it when the fly was in his mouth already. With his mouth closed, he just stood there with only his ears twitching. This went on for around 10 seconds, and when he finally opened his mouth, the fly flew out! :roflmfao:\n  7. Ella is only 10 weeks old so we are still trying to master the housetraining thing. Funny thing she does - if she has an accident and poops in the house - she barks at it. I mean growls and barks at it. It is absolutely hilarious and I have to laugh at her.\n  8. ^^ LMAO\n\n    We had a Bischon once who got into a Bakery box of pastries on the dining room table... when we all got to it later that day we all blamed each other and wondered who the \"pig\" was that could eat multiple pastries like croissants, eclairs, and cruellers in one sitting! After a while I sat down at the couch and rested my arm on a pillow... it went * squish * and I picked it up to find 2 eclairs and a bears claw underneathe!! Someone had his them there then delicately dragged the pillow over them so she could go back later!\n\n    Only ONE of our dogs was this sneaky so I went looking for her, only to find her hiding under a table with a snouth covered in cream!!\n\n    Needless to say, my entire family had to give her 007 credit for that one :roflmfao:\n  9. My doxie came upstairs to my office (I telecommute) and wanted to sit on my lap during a conference call, then promptly fell asleep and was snoring so I had to put the phone on mute.\n  10. ^^^ omg such cute stories.\n\n    Well my Doggie Tamaki she loves to lick the water of the shower. so you see her tongue in and out of the door. Well one day i always start the shower and leave the door open to get a towel , soap etc whatever i need, as i left the shower and came back i Saw Maki Inside the shower licking the shower water. I thought it was the funniest and cutest thing in the world . I ended up taking her a shower.\n  11. my puppy Milo has started this \"game\" that he really gets a kick out of...when i brought him home he ran a few laps around the house then he discovered he could run underneath the bed with no trouble... for about 3 weeks straight when it was time for bed and he had to go to his crate he would run under the bed and bark...to get him out we'd have to close the bedroom door...well apparently Milo doesn't understand he's a growing boy...about 4 days ago he ran into my room and tried to go under the bed...and we heard a loud \"thud\" sound lol...he bumped his head...he's too tall to just run underneath now...he has to lay down and \"scoot\" under the bed...since it takes him so long now its easy to just pick him up...People-1 Doggy-0 lol\n  12. Lucy (Lulu) LOVES her crate. It's her castle and best toy. She would somehow wrap herself up in her blankets and sit in her crate on her stomach and use her paw to punch the crate doors. It will swing open then close, because it's not locked she would punch it again and it'll open and close. So she would just sit there for hours no end just hitting the crate door and it'll just open and close, open and close and gradually it'll get faster and faster until she gets so excited that she starts barking and basically tossing around inside her crate. The crate isn't that big so you can see the whole thing move.\n\n    I have so many videos of her doing it, I'll try to get it on the computer. It's freakin' hilarious!!\n\n    P.S Lucy is a purebred white Maltese.",

        "text":"2019_Pincushion_new logo\n\nFacebook\u00a0Twitter\u00a0Sew4Home RSS Feed\u00a0Follow Me on Pinterest\u00a0Instagram\n\n\nThe Pressing Cloth\n\nPrinter-friendly versionPDF version\n\nClick to Read MoreYou probably have something in your house right now with potential to become a pressing cloth. A section of an old white cotton bed sheet works fine. The older the better. Just cut it to size and, voila! It's a brand new pressing cloth.\n\nA good pressing cloth is a necessity. It keeps your iron from contact with your fabric to avoid scorching, shiny spots and little stains. It also protects your iron when you use any type iron-on or fusible interfacing.\n\nThe Cloth\n\nI like my bed sheet cloths because I can see through the old fabric well enough to tell what's going on under it. From one sheet, I made several cloths: a small cloth about 10-inches x 14-inches, and a large cloth about 12-inches x 30-inches. They come in handy at different times. Some people like to overcast the edges of their pressing cloths, but I leave them as is to prevent unintentionally ironing in a stitch pattern.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nYou can also use a clean white cotton tea towel, napkin, or fine linen handkerchief; some people swear by a plain cotton diaper. If you make your own, don't use color-dyed or patterned fabric. You can also buy press cloths at most fabric stores. However you do it, be sure to wash your cloth first to remove any sizing.\n\nUsing a Pressing Cloth\n\nA pressing cloth is not necessary for every fabric. Test a scrap of your fabric with your iron; if you get a sheen or a discoloration, you'll want to use your pressing cloth.\n\nYou can either\u00a0lightly\u00a0dampen your pressing cloth, or use it dry. When using a damp cloth, it's better not to use the steam setting your your iron. It's always a good idea to test your fabric before going too far to be sure the heat setting on your iron is set appropriately.\n\nPress through the cloth onto the wrong side of your fabric. Avoid the right side (pretty side) as much as possible. Press your seams as you sew.\n\n\nComments (17)\n\n4Sunshine said:\n4Sunshine's picture\n\nI'm new to your website and really love all the information & projects you have on hand.\n\nOnly wish I had found it sooner.

I need to heat-set a painted fabric, and was very apprehensive about what to use for a press cloth. You have set my mind at ease.

FutureChickenMan\n\n    FutureChickenMan Songster\n\n    Oct 29, 2007\n    So it's just about dusk, the beagles are out in the yard playing.. then they both start howling like crazy.. I mean really going nuts. Last time they did that my neighbor was wandering around the yard with a flashlight looking for his cat. So of course I get up to go see what the heck is going on. So down by the pond stands mamma moose and her baby.. and my two stupid beagles are howling and barking at them. Dumb dumb dogs. So ya know, I love those dumb dogs and I cant let mamma moose stomp them in to oblivion.. So I walk out there calling the dogs off but they have obsessive compulsive disorder so they aint listening. I wander up behind the older beagle and was able to grab her by the hind legs and pull her away from the moose. At that point I was within 10 feet of mama. I was shocked how calm she was with baby there just standing by the pond staring me down. I made it quick to grab the dog and back away making sure mama knew I was backing off. One dog down, one to go. I wander down to the lower field where the younger dog.. amazingly that dog came when I called her but I had to be close enough for her to see and hear me. At that point I was about 20 feet from mama moose. Now that the dogs were rustled up I took them inside and grabbed the camera.\n\n\n    Just so you get an idea how big a moose is, here's mama and baby standing by my full size ford bronco.\n\n    here's the younger dog doing her thang.. sorry the picture is blurry, my wife was having a fit cause ya know the dogs are the \"babies\".. and the autofocus isn't so great at dusk.\n\n\n    This one is really blurry, but thats me on the lower left corner walking down to get the dogs.. you can see how close i got and this wasn't even the closest point.. my wife (behind the camera) freaked when she saw how close i was and went in side..\n  2. texaschickmama\n\n    texaschickmama Songster\n\n    Sep 19, 2007\n    Poolville, TX\n    OMGosh, You could have been stomped to death. Aren't the mommas really protective over their young like a bear? Lucky you, I would have been freaked out too. [\u200bIMG]\n  3. Freebie\n\n    Freebie Songster\n\n    Feb 4, 2007\n    Bloomingdale, MI\n    Very cool, and how very nice of her not to attack you getting so close to her baby. She must not have felt threatened, even by the dogs. Great pics too!!\n\n    I had a white tail deer (doe) attack two of my dogs. Apparently she had decided to use my back pasture for a nursery, and I had them out with me doing chores. I sent them out of the barn and next thing I know they were being chased by the doe all the way up to the house and around the car a couple of times. It was so weird. I finally got them in the barn with me and she stayed outside the barn and kept like bleating at me every time I opened the door. She stayed out there for about 10 minutes. I finally walked up to the house and got the van to go pick up the dogs. ( I did not want her going after the dogs again.)\n  4. FutureChickenMan\n\n    FutureChickenMan Songster\n\n    Oct 29, 2007\n    the weirdest thing is I wasn't scared of her at all. I figured as long as she was calm, I had no reason to get freaked out. Mama moose did charge one of the dogs once but it was only 3 or for steps and the dog high taled it out of there. You might not know it but beagles (or at least ours) are really fast. They run down deer all the time, luckily they stop for the underground fence..\n  5. Wow! She is big! Glad we don't have to worry about them here [\u200bIMG]\n\n  6. seminolewind\n\n    seminolewind Flock Mistress Premium Member 11 Years\n\n    Sep 6, 2007\n    spring hill, florida\n    I have always wanted to see a moose first hand in real life. No luck so far. I think they are incredible. But I don't think I would have gotten that close!\n  7. speckledhen\n\n    speckledhen Intentional Solitude Premium Member 11 Years\n\n    Awesome animals! Dont have moose way down south, but always thought they were impressive.\n  8. chickbea\n\n    chickbea Songster\n\n    Jan 18, 2007\n    A person I work with once had a mother moose kick in the side of her car as she was trying to edge past it one night. She had a very hard time getting her insurance guy to believe that one!\n  9. Frozen Feathers\n\n    Frozen Feathers Songster\n\n    May 4, 2007\n    Cool pictures.\n    you are crazy though to get that close to a Cow moose, especially with a calf. Moose are amazing but unpredictable animals. You're lucky she was in a good mood. If she decided to charge there is no way you could run faster then her and standing your ground to a moose is like standing your ground with a train. As much as I love my dog, if she's not smart enough to get in the house away from a moose there's no way I'm going after her. :eek:\n\n    When I lived up north more I had them run down the middle of the road in front of my truck. Occasionally you get a young bull that would turn around and try and challenge, now that gets scary. I've only a seen a few where I live now, but I've seen the damage they can do.\n\n    Weird story about a moose. When I was a teenager I had a friend who killed a moose with his bicycle. He was riding down his dirt road probably way to fast and a moose just stepped out in front of him. My friend skidded sideways too late and ended up crashing into the leg of the moose, breaking it. The moose had to be put down. Amazingly my friend got out of it with just scrapes and road rash and a lot of meals. It was hard to believe, but if you've ever seen a moose, their legs aren't that thick and it doesn't take much force to snap one.\n  10. FutureChickenMan\n\n    FutureChickenMan Songster\n\n    Oct 29, 2007\n    Yeah they are big and dangerous. Most definitely don't get anywhere near the calf mom will go nuts and could stomp you in to oblivion. I really don't know why she was so calm with me out there. But I knew they were there for the water and the dogs weren't letting them have it. So I removed the dogs, maybe mom liked that and cut me some slack. Plus she saw me coming so it wasn't like I surprised her. Most of the critters in my area will take off and not challenge the bipeds (lol).. It's really weird, we get deer, elk and moose. If the dogs are out the deer will take off. If it's just me out there, they don't care, they just keep an eye on me. But the deer are certainly more protective than that moose was. I get the hiss and stomp from the deer if I get too close.\n\n    My co-worker who's an avid hunter said I was lucky mama moose didn't run me down. I laughed and said.. \"I'm the moose whisperer you're just jealous\". He's never been that close to a living moose and was totally shocked by how close I was.\n\n    I was really surprised they didn't take off when i came out of the house. I guess they really wanted that water.\n    Last edited: Nov 5, 2007\n\nBackYard Chickens is proudly sponsored by:",

I've never been intrigued by Entrelac but now I know where to come should I get the bug.\n\nThank you for the PDF version of the tutorial.

I'm staff writer at the Lime & Violet Daily Chum blog (at http:\/\/www.limenviolet.com\/blog\/ ), and I recently came across your entrelac knitting tutorial. I'd really like to feature it on the blog, as we try to get the most knowledge to the most people in the most sassy way ;)\nDo you mind if I do? I'd need one of the pictures on your blog post to lure people over to read the whole tutorial. Please feel free to say no if that's not okay with you (but doesn't everybody love their 15 minutes of fame?).\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nWow! Entrelac tutorials have always looked so complicated to me, but you made it look so simple! Thank you so much for this.\n\nI'm a fairly new knitter and was dying to own one of the Quant headbands from the winter `08 Knitty. Your tutorial, and your tutorial alone made my dream come true. Thanks so much for making entrelac easy!\n\nThis is a beautiful piece - I love the colours. Thank you for sharing your pattern. Its my next big project.\n\nHey, I found this tutorial through craftster and started following it. Thanks, I've always wanted to be brave enough to knit entrelac! I noticed a slightly confusing instruction I thought you might want to know about\/might help anyone else following it.\n\nOn the Tier 1 Left Side Triangles row 11, instruction says \"turn - end of left triangle - Do Not Turn\" Obviously that first 'turn' is a mistake. Haven't got much further, but I guess the mistake could be repeated elsewhere.\n\nAnyway, sorry to bug. Hope that helps.\n\nThank you so much for this tutorial. I have a case of Lorna Lace coming in. Lots of different sizes and colors. The two that this is just SCREAMING for is the Watercolor and the Rainbow so I will be using your tutorial to make scarves, headbands, stoles and socks. Thank you for taking all of the time and effort to put this together.\n\nHello, Thank you very much for this useful and well-done tutorial. I have done an entry on my blog, giving the link here.\nThe entry is entitled \"Entrelac and Stream\". I found yours through knitty.com\n\nAwesome tutorial! I did a knit along with you directions and am goign to share my new skills with friends ASAP. thanks!\n\nThank you so much for sharing!!! I cannot wait to try it!\n\nI think I love you! Will you marry me? No, I don't imagine my husband will mind a bit, someone else to talk knitting to -so he won't have to try to pretend to be interested...\nOops! Back to the subject at hand. Thank you SO hugely for the grand tutorial to entrailtangles. We have taken to calling it entrails tangles or \"entrailtangles\" but with the spiffy pictures and the put your right foot here and so on I can actually do this Entrelac thing, now if I can just fake saying it right! Happy day! I would be jumping up and down and dancing right about now if it wasn't 3 degrees outside of my cozy bed. I will leave my covers long enough to bow to the sun for you though, and wish you many happy returns of the knitting day and a tangle & guilt free endless stash.\nThat said, I am back to my knitting with a big ol' smile on my face.\nHappy knitting, Bee\n\nOh wow- thank you thank you thank you. YOu don't know how many times I've pulled out and started the Entrlac scarf over and over. I wish I would have found you weeks ago!\nYou simplified it so much. Thanks again, Lynn\n\nOh wow- thank you thank you thank you. YOu don't know how many times I've pulled out and started the Entrlac scarf over and over. I wish I would have found you weeks ago!\nYou simplified it so much. Thanks again, Lynn\n\nYou have an amazing tutorial. I was working on an entrelac scarf and was struggling after the first triangle. I had not done entrelac before and was convinced I was doing it wrong. Your pictures and explanations were just what the doctor ordered! I finished my first, second and part of the third row in one evening. It is a really cool pattern. Once again Thank you so so much for your tutorial!\n\nYour instructions are so much better than most I have seen. Thank you so much for creating this tutorial. I'm moving right along and should have a scarf in a few days.\n\n\nI've been dying to try entrelac so thank you for yet another excellent tutorials! I'm definitely a visual learner so your help is deeply appreciated!\n\nI've been dying to try entrelac so thank you for yet another excellent tutorials! I'm definitely a visual learner so your help is deeply appreciated!\n\nThanks for this GREAT tutorial!!!\n\nthanks so much. This was really helpful. The PDF came across well and easy to follow. I am using Noro with silk blend for a lovely, irrestible scarf. All the gals at the knit shop are making a similar pattern out of the same Naro line of wool in different lot numbers.\n\nI just recently learned about the awesomeness that is entrelac. (I was at my LYS and saw someone working on a \"cool looking basketweave bag\" that I was soon informed was entrelac.)\n\nYour tutorial looks like just the key for me to try my hand on it.\n\n\nI am a novice knitter. I am not very skilled at reading patterns. At what point do you change colors? Where you pick up the stitches? THanks.\n\nThank you for the clear 'splainin'. Question: if I'm knitting backwards so as to avoid the continual turning, what does the \"pick up and purl\" look like? Again, thanks!\n\nOk, so if you wanted to make a shawl instead of a scarf, do you just triple or quadruple the amount of stitches in your cast on? (Yeah, I know, how crazy is that, I haven't even tried the technique yet but I am thinking it would make a great shawl !!)\n\nThis pattern was extremely difficult for me and I consider (considered) myself a master knitter. Boo hoo..... I gave up after five or six tries.\n\nI'd never been able to actually do entrelac past the first triangles row before this tutorial! Thanks so much :)\n\nThank you!\nI have been entranced and intimidated by entrelac. I am now on my third tier thanks to this awesome tutorial.\n\nWow, you make it look so easy! Thanks for the useful photos, I can't wait to experiment with this!\n\n\nWonderful tutorial. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you!\n\nI agreed your way to create a gap free seam. I did pick up from the top down which create a bigger hole. If pick up the most important stich down the bottom the hole is mush smaller\n\nThanks so much for this great tutorial. It made so much more sense (to me) after I saw the photos of each step along the way. Before today I thought entralac was way, way, way too advanced for a somewhat advanced beginner like me to try. Now though, I will be much more likely to try a scarf using the entralac method... thanks for your fun tutorial.\n\nThis has been an awesome scarf to make - you're tutorial was a great help. It's been a fun project to take and work on at basketball games - I get lots of comments, and young girls wanting to know more about knitting. Thanks!\n\nHi, knittyotter.\n\nI'm the admin of the \"Unfilodi Knit-House\" Italian Blog-Shop and Forum.\n\nAn user of ours took care of the Italian translation of this Tutorial for the benefit of other non-english-speaking users.\n\nThe file now is in my hands, but before publishing it as a PDF file in our free download area of knitting patterns, manuals and tutorials under Creative Commons licence (only free user registration required to download), I'm asking for your prior permission to such publishing.\n\nMoreover, being it just a strict translation of your tutorial \"as is\", including photos, I would like to add to the translated PDF all the proper credits and links to your site.\n\nIn case and after you would agree about publishing, please let me have at the pointed out email address both your permission and the specimen of the credits you like to be added.\n\nMany thanks in advance, have a nice knitting.\n\n\n\nI took instructions from this website and making a scarf now. I forwarded this to many friends. We are members of slcl knitting club.\n\nThank you\n\nWow, it is great!\n\nI have done both 8 & 6 st. scarves. Thank you for your way! All of a sudden I need you to clarify for me. PICK & KNIT OR PURL 6 sts. I was just picking them up and go do the next row. It is more to it then loop from the back to front, then yo and pull thur to back. AM I SUPPOSE EIIHER K OR P the st.? Waiting for your help.\n\nGreat scarves and beautiful colors....\n\nVery nice tutorial - thanks!!!\n\nJust got back from Stitches in Connecticut. I saw the Lady Elizabeth and decided I HAVE TO LEARN THIS. Well, we shall see. The pattern looks like I actually might be able to do it.\nThanks so much.\n\nI wanted to let you know first off I have a hard time with knitting (I have a difficult time following patterns) I tried that pdf you are linked to but I got confused.

I am glad things turned out okay.\n\n    \u2022 Yeah I know just that I never leave stuff out that is dangerous cause I know Annie does this LOL she is a sneaky piglet.\n\n  2. Goodness Jan, Remember this \u2013 you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Annie did. Just because you can\u2019t break her of the habit doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all your fault. It\u2019s such a small thing.\n\n    I had no idea corn cobs could be so bad for dogs. Once when we had my niece and nephew staying here for the Summer we had corn on the cob for dinner. After dinner I had my 12 y.o. nephew take the scraps out to the compost pile. Well, he didn\u2019t close the fence gate and our dog later went out and had herself a feast! Later we heard her in the kitchen up-chucking. Whoa! That was one big pile of corn cobs!!!\n\n    Didn\u2019t even faze the dog.\n\n    This same dog ate or chewed on our dining table legs, our counter footstool, all the zucchini of three plants, and all the short garden fences. She finally died of internal bleeding that we think was caused by consuming all those chemicals in the treated wood of those fences.\n\n    Damn dogs.\n\n    \u2022 Yeah they are not good for dogs at all. We have had this happen before and did no it happened and nothing bad happened. We have also had friends dogs that died from it so it is a toss up. Since Annie is older now and the piece was big . \u2026\n\n      Good thing we went in because it was not chewed up and well on its way to the ugh oh land.\n\n      My upset with self was that I am very cautious and the had to P now now now and then my short attention span mind caused the result. Not to mention the money for the vet \u2013 yikes!\n\n\n  3. Ditto what Karen and Webster said about beating yourself up.\n\n    I\u2019ve always been amazed that kids make it through all the dangers of being curious children and grow up. Add dogs to the list.\n\n    Here\u2019s to hurling! Yay Annie!\n\n  4. i\u2019m so glad annie came out of this on the other side\u2026. and IT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT! dogs will be dogs\u2026. i know what you mean though\u2026 we try to be so diligent and protective of our furkids but sometimes there are slips\u2026 for all of us\u2026 i would be beating myself up too\u2026 but don\u2019t listen to me\u2026 STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP!\n\n    my beloved Maggie \u2026 God i miss that dog\u2026 a few years ago she helped herself to a reese\u2019s peanut butter cup\u2026 and she had seizures afterwards from the chocolate\u2026 i was devastated\u2026\n\n    you see Maggie was an angel of a soul\u2026 she never did anything she wasn\u2019t supposed\u2026 really\u2026she didn\u2019t\u2026 she was amazing\u2026 i could put a steak on the floor and she wouldn\u2019t touch it until i told her she could\u2026. incredible mind that dog had\u2026 and because of this i never thought she would take the candy\u2026but she did\u2026 and she almost died\u2026 and i cried and cried and spent the last 3 years of her life doing what i could to make it up to her!!\n\n    God i miss that dog\u2026 oh, wait, i think i said that already\n\n    \u2022 Yeah ok all I stopped beating myself up now! Catfish is like that too he will not eat anything I put down or drop if I say leave it. That said I had to pull some plants up in the back yard area because last year he started thinking that they were yummy. They made him sick.\n\n      This year he has found one he loves so I guess I will plant it some where else although it is not on the poison for dogs list. I am not taking any chances.\n\n      My BuddyBoxer is the dog I miss ever so much. He was my pal we went everywhere together. He was well trained and a sweet heart unless you threatened one of us. He is the reason while I was upstairs bathing and someone kicked the front door down that they did not get further in \u2013 at least that is what the police thought.\n\n      and yeah I miss him\n\n\n  5. I sounds like a lot. I\u2019m happy in the end things worked out. I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life afraid of dogs. I know silly, but I \u2018m working on it!\n\n    \u2022 Not silly at all lots of people are. Now my little Catfish would win over your heart. Not that you would appreciate his social self LOL but he is real calm and sweet.\n\n      Annie is a bull in a china shop at times.\n\n\n    \u2022 I was unaware of it till our dog class instructor said one dog was not there because \u2013 \u2014 not a happy ending story.\n\n      I have had dogs eat cobs and nothing happened but I am not willing to take the chance.\n\n\n  6. Not sure this will make you feel loads better, but your distress taught me something. I had no idea about the corn cob\/dog issue! And I have a dog who\u2019ll take food off the table and counter when our backs our turned, so no peeing for me when we\u2019re eating corn on the cob.\n\n  7. Glad someone got something good out of her scarfing the corn cob! Some dos are sneakier than others. I think next time I shall take the plate to the bathroom with me \u2013 never again if I can help it will this happen again.\n\n    thank you for commenting \u2013 cracking up reading your post about the rattling door and the cat!\n\n\n  8. I am painfully familiar with your pain. For all their svelte outline, narrow dogs are as bad as any when it comes to eating stuff they shouldn\u2019t have. And there\u2019s no place they can\u2019t reach! For some dogs, if there\u2019s food, they just don\u2019t have the neurological wiring to not eat it. Even Ernie, who was practically perfect in every other respect, had the adventure with the bag of Halloween candy. And the adventure with the bottle of Tylenol. Guilt. Pain. $$$.\n\n    I\u2019m glad everybody\u2019s OK.\n\n    \u2022 Oh man Tylenol that is a big guilt getter and very scary and yeah expensive.\n\n      i was hoping that Annie would associate the unpleasantness at the vet with the corn cob but I suspect if she located another she would scarf it down!\n\n      Wish I could reach all the places the dogs manage to get into \ud83d\ude42 skinny dogs, webbed feet dogs, and short legged dogs LOL they all seem to manage to find stuff to eat \u2013 especially really stinky gross stuff.\n\nComments are closed.",

As my neighbor was leaving the puppy unattended a lot , Morty was spending a lot of time with me. He was practically every day at my house, he was coming for walks with me, I had even started giving him obedience lessons and oh, he was so smart\u2026I had begged my neighbor to keep him in a restricted area instead of having him wonder at the streets alone, but he was always too busy for that.\nLast night Morty got hit by a car and died. I cannot stop crying. I tried to find out more information, but all I got was a rude reply that they do not want to talk about it. I don\u2019t even know where his body is. My heart is so heavy. I don\u2019t know what to do, I spend all day wondering \u2018what if\u2019.

The grate size is capable of placing very large cuts of meats, such as whole beef brisket. Vertical smokers have their own set of benefits, so it really depends on what you're cooking and how much you will load up the rig. Depending on how you set-up internal configurations in a vertical, you can actually have different temp zones, which can be beneficial when smoking different foods such as chickens (hot & fast) and pork butts (low & slow), simultaneously.\n\n\nHere's the Reverse Flow forums. You should be able to find tons of info on flow-plate design and dimensions, fire box sizing calculations, etc. Take your time reading and come up with a viable plan for your skill-level and available resources. Lastly, enjoy the build\/conversion and especially the resulting great eats!!!\n\n\n\n\npost #3 of 4\n\nI actually have that same tank sitting in my yard for use in my trailer rig. I was going to make a warming oven with it, but I'm worried it's too thin. It's now slated for an open top grill on the front of the trailer. I figure it's a good way to quickly make burgers\/hot dogs, get the sauce on wings sticky, grill up some little necks, you name it.\n\n\n\nDefinitely curious to see what you do with yours!\n\npost #4 of 4\nThis is a 70gal tank. Started it a year ago and got busy. Hoping to finish it in the next few weekes.\n\nNew Posts \u00a0All Forums:Forum Nav:\n\u00a0\u00a0Return Home\n\u00a0\u00a0Back to Forum: Smoker Builds\u00a0\u203a\u00a0Forums\u00a0\u203a\u00a0Smoking Supplies & Equipment\u00a0\u203a\u00a0Smoker Builds\u00a0\u203a\u00a060 gallon air tank - looking for suggestions",
