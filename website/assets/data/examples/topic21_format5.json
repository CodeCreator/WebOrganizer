You can find various types of grip tape that work best for different riding styles. However, many people usually divide them into two main categories: Jessup and Vicious.\n\nRead on to find out more about grip tape and which one might be the best for your riding style.\n\nGrit Ratings\n\nGrip tape grit ranges from 24 to 80 grit. It\u2019s a small segment of the overall grit ratings that range from 12 to about 1000 grit.\n\nHere\u2019s a reference with the brand, grit, and particle size breakdown:\n\n  \u2022 24 Grit: Diablo Extra Course, Gator Super Coarse XC,\n  \u2022 30 Grit: Older Version of Black Vicious\n  \u2022 36 Grit: New Clear Vicious, New Black Vicious, Thumb Cutter, Gator Grip Coarse\n  \u2022 40 Grit: Red Vicious, Diablo Course Belt Sander, Blood Orange,\n  \u2022 50 Grit: Loaded Course (Chubby Unicorn)\n  \u2022 60 Grit: Gator Standard (Colored), Bustin\n  \u2022 80 Grit: Jessup, MOB, Most Street Board Grip\n\nSo, which grip tape has the right grit level for you?\n\nYou need to choose a grip tape that matches the grit needs of your riding style and your personal preferences. Generally, here\u2019s how it goes:\n\n  \u2022 24-40 grit is best for downhill or fast free ride\n  \u2022 50-80 grit is for slow freerides, freestyles, technical freerides, and cruising\n\nThat said, there are still many people who use less coarse grip tape for fast freerides and downhill. Some riders use Vicious for slow technical freeride.\n\nNote that these generalizations are based on the coarseness of the grip and how much grip you want between your shoes and the board.\n\nLower grits offer a better grip. Unless the grip tape is wet, everything could work well.\u00a0Also, each company produces grip tapes with various levels of exterior coating, although most products available are epoxy-based.\n\n50 grit tape is perfect for freeride and freestyle. For wet or cold weather, 36 grit works best. In warm and dry conditions, 30 and 36 grit works great.\n\nYou can find these grip tapes for about $10 a pack at a local improvement store.\n\nFreestyle riders also love the 50-65 grit range. It doesn\u2019t let your feet slip across the board as easily as 80 grit, but it\u2019s not as course as a grip range below 40.\n\nHowever, a low grit for doing freestyles may destroy shoes and possibly hands. This is actually the reason why some brands that sell freestyle-oriented boards grip them with an 80 grit grip tape. It\u2019s a grit level that lets riders move and release their feet across the board easily.\n\nWhat is OS780 grip tape?\n\nOS780 Grip tape is widely used in the longboard and skateboarding world. Its sand is abrasion-resistant, skid-proof, and emery. Deck surfaces with this grip tape provide a solid rock bonding, which is expected since it\u2019s an industry standard for a trusted deck adhesion.\n\nFinding grip tapes that aren\u2019t designer brands is handy with the many available choices online today. You can pick grip tapes that have zero frills in exchange for affordability.\n\nHow to apply a grip tape?\n\nMaterials in applying a grip tape:\n\n  \u2022 A deck\n  \u2022 Grip tape\n  \u2022 A razor blade\n  \u2022 Some sort of straight-edged tool (such as a screwdriver or skate tool)\n  \u2022 A heat gun or hair dryer (optional)\n\nSteps in applying a grip tape:\n\n  \u2022 Remove the backing from the grip tape.\n  \u2022 Set it on the top of the deck by starting at the center.\n  \u2022 Press down on the grip tape carefully.\n  \u2022 Work your way outward extra slowly.\n  \u2022 Turn the deck over.\n  \u2022 Using the razor blade, cut off the excess grip tape that hangs over the edge.\n  \u2022 Flip the deck back over.\n  \u2022 Then, using the heat gun, heat the edges of the board, but don\u2019t let it melt.\n  \u2022 Using your straight-edged tool, scrape around the entire deck to rasp the board edges.\n  \u2022 Start cutting the excess tapes with your razorblade.\n  \u2022 Hold the blade in about a 45-degree angle to the board.\n  \u2022 Clean up the edges using the razor blade once more.\n  \u2022 Lastly, poke holes through the grip tape where the bolds go.\n\nThings to remember:\n\n  \u2022 Use controlled and slow movements when cutting.\n  \u2022 Make sure to cut out wherever there\u2019s a wheel.\n  \u2022 Make relief cuts to keep the tape from being bent when it bends around the tail of your longboard deck.\n\nQ: Are grip tapes easy to use?\n\nGrip tapes can be a bit tricky to use in the beginning, but you can get used to it. You can always ask a friend for help. However, if you just follow the instructions on how to apply grip tapes as stated above, you\u2019ll be fine as well.\n\nQ: What are the typical dimensions of a grip tape?\n\nDimensions will vary from tape to tape. But, in buying one for your board, make sure to measure your board to find the right grip tape. Give some extra space, too, so you can still manage even if you mess up the first time.\n\nQ: What material are grip tapes made of?\n\nThe material mirrors the feel of sandpaper, but a grip tape for a longboard is finer. It\u2019s even better than sandpaper since it\u2019s designed for that purpose alone. Depending on the company, it can be made of aluminum oxide or silicon carbide.\n\nQ: Where do I get the grip tape for a longboard?\n\nSpecialized skate shops sell grip tapes, although if you\u2019re into convenience, it\u2019s also easier to find them online. You can take advantage of the wider choice available by reading consumer reviews.\n\n\nBuying the right grip tape is optimal for ensuring a better skating experience. With the right grip, you can have a safer overall longboarding experience .\n\nRemember that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve just started doing tricks or are just strolling around. Having a good grip tape is important no matter what your riding style is.\n\nIf you\u2019re a beginner and can\u2019t assess what level of grit you need, you might need to go with some 40-50 grit. It\u2019s in the middle range, and you can have a happy medium and the best of both worlds.\n\nWe hope that this post helps you in one way or another. If you have questions, feel free to hit us up. We at Questboards are happy to bring you the best longboard experience.",

Believe it or not, walk-on spots at many schools are just as competitive as scholarship spots\u2014they are very limited!\n\nTo become a preferred walk-on, coaches need to see you play\u2014either in person, or on video. For any roster spot, coaches are looking for size, speed, skill and strength. You may not be masters of all four, but can you really improve in one or two areas?\n\nImportantly, work to find out if they need your position. It may be a waste of time pursuing a position at a certain school that is stacked, most walk-ons are invited to join the team because they play a position that is lacking depth on the roster, and the coaching staff doesn\u2019t have scholarships available.\n\nIn the same way that you would pursue a scholarship spot, send your film and Student-Athlete Resume, and tell them you are looking for walk-on opportunities.\n\nHaving your prep coach call can also help, again mentioning that you\u2019re looking for walk-on opportunities. Start with the assistant coach who recruits your county\/school, and possibly try the position coach or Director of Operations if you aren\u2019t getting much feedback. Most coaching staffs also have a \u201cWalk-On Coordinator,\u201d you can also ask for them.\n\nFind ways to get exposure and your info in front of coaches! Approach your efforts in the same way that you would as a scholarship player.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

How do I get started?\n\nIt is recommended for one to start in either a beginner yoga class or take a restorative yoga class. If an injury is present or there are special circumstances it\u2019s highly advised to seek private instruction first. A one-on-one session can help one to develop yoga tools to stay safe and help you make the most of your yoga.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time doing Pilates. How do I get started?\n\nIf you are new to Pilates equipment, you will need to start with a minimum of 2 privates. This will give you an introduction to the basic exercises and the principles of Pilates as well as each of the main pieces of equipment. Most people, after completing these initial sessions, are able to join a beginner class.\n\nPrivate Sessions or Group Classes?\n\nYour first 3-5 Pilates sessions should be private for optimal results. This will introduce you to the Pilates apparatus, allow the instructor to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, and give you a chance you to learn Pilates at your own pace. These sessions will familiarize you with the movement and language of Pilates\n\nHow do I schedule a private session?\n\nAll scheduling is handled through the front desk through phone\/email or in person.\n\nHow do I handle cancellations?\n\nWe have a 24-hour cancellation policy for privates, and duets. Please contact us so we can change the schedule and\/or fill your spot. If you late-cancel a private session, you will be charged a $40 fee.\n\nCan I start by taking a Pilates mat classes?\n\nYes, as long as you do not have any major injuries.\n\nHow often do you recommend I come to Pilate\u2019s?\n\nThis is a personal choice; some people opt to come once a week. In order to see changes more quickly, we recommend 2-3 times per week. This will allow your body to integrate what you learn in each session as well as carry this awareness into your daily life.\n\n\nPlease email Kate Millen with any other questions.",

At Nourishing Storm, we\u00a0love sharing the practice with new students as the benefits can be transformational and serve to fulfill whatever one is\u00a0looking for ie. balance, strength, flexibility, peace and so much more.\u00a0 You do not need to know anything or have any experience to begin yoga.\u00a0We just ask that you keep in mind that yoga is a practice and it does take time.\u00a0The best practice you can have is one where you listen to your body and we\u2019ll teach you how to do that.\n\nWhat do I need to bring to class?\n\nCurrently students are asked to bring a mat and any props they would like to use for class. Most classes give options to use 1-2 blocks, a strap, blanket and bolster (especially if you are taking a Yoga Restore class). We have gently used yoga props for sale in the cafe.\u00a0\n\nHow many students are in classes?\n\nWe pride ourselves in being a\u00a0small, intimate studio,\u00a0so you get personal attention as well as feel there is enough space for you to stretch out! Currently we allow up to 9 students live in the studio and if you choose to take a virtual class, well that is unlimited and can be practiced right from the comfort of your home!\n\nDo I need to sign up for classes online ahead of time?\n\nYES! Since we only allow up to 9 students (each spot marked 6 feet apart) you will need to sign up to reserve your space. Also to join us virtually you will need to be signed up to get the link to join our class. Signing up takes about a minute once your account is created (and we even have our own app to save even more time, just look in the app store for \u201cNourishing Storm\u201d and book right from your phone). If you are not sure how to do this, send us a message.\u00a0\n\nWhat are the best classes for beginners?\n\nAll instructors in each class will give\u00a0modifications and variations to each pose so our classes are open to all levels. \u00a0However, the following classes are geared towards a slow, gentle practice that is great for beginners:\u00a0Yoga Calm, Yoga Bliss, Yoga Restore and Yoga Begin.\u00a0Other classes such as Yoga Flow and Yoga Strong move a little quicker and are less instructional, but lots of fun.\n\nHow do I get started?\n\nYou can either stop in the cafe and talk to one of our juice bar gals or you can create an account online by signing up for your first class. We offer packages for those new to yoga and those new to our studio in addition to class cards, drop ins and membership.\u00a0More info on getting started here.\n\nI have additional questions ...\n\nIf we did not answer your question(s),\u00a0please reach out to us.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you soon, the NS Team\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all in the name. Nourishing Storm Studio and Cafe. I started on my journey for inner peace about 2 years ago. August of 2015 I found the Storm. It\u2019s been true love ever since. I had no true Yoga practice besides a night class at the local school. Now it\u2019s been 6 months and I have found my happy place. Kristin and Megan are so much more than Yoga teachers. My favorite pose to date is Legs up the Wall. I don\u2019t know how to explain why I just know that I feel grounded and happy when my legs are up the wall. I am grateful every day that I found such a nourishing community.\u201d\n\n-Tina K\n\nHours of Operation\n\nFor yoga classes, check the schedule\n\nCafe Closed\n\n\n7:00am - 2:00pm\n\n8:00am - 2:00pm\n\nDrop Us a Line\n\nDon't be shy.

You can also e-mail them to [email\u00a0protected].\n\nI would like to know what the title 30 for 30 means. Does it have a meaning or is it something just made up? \u2014 Ron\n\nThe original 30 for 30 film series (now referred to as Volume 1) was unveiled in October 2009 to commemorate ESPN\u2019s 30th anniversary. From October 2009 to December 2010, 30 films were shown that detailed the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 (when ESPN started) to 2009, hence \u201c30 for 30.\u201d\n\nWhile not tied to a specific anniversary, the \u201c30 for 30\u201d name remained when Volume 2 films premiered this October with Broke and concluded this past Saturday with You Don\u2019t Know Bo, which became ESPN\u2019s highest-rated documentary ever.\n\nAnd Ron, since you bring it up and since it is the holiday season, we\u2019ll alert folks they can purchase the 30 for 30 Volume 1 box set to ensure you don\u2019t miss any of the incredible films.\n\nHow can I get a guided tour of ESPN and how much does it cost? \u2013 Dustin\nDustin, your question is a common one, but unfortunately ESPN does not offer individual tours of the Bristol campus. If this policy ever changes, we\u2019ll be sure to let fans know right here on Front Row.\n\nWhile fans can\u2019t come to Bristol, there are ways we bring Bristol to the fans. For starters, be sure you continue to visit Front Row, where we share an inside look at life in Bristol and beyond. Also, check out @ESPNImages for great photos showcasing life on our Bristol campus and behind-the-scenes images, such as this past week\u2019s comprehensive look at Monday Night Football.\n\nWhere can I get information about internships at ESPN? \u2013 Kendra\nIf questions about campus tours are No. 1 on the \u201cMost Asked Questions\u201d list, inquiries about interning and\/or working at ESPN are the second most popular questions we get. To find out about internship opportunities, visit the ESPN Careers site and like the ESPN Careers Facebook page. To best get you started on your journey, we recommend watching the 2012 Intern Diaries and visiting the Career Control Room.\n\nWhat is the name of the song from the latest It\u2019s Not Crazy, It\u2019s Sports commercial \u2013 David\nAnother popular question this week as David and others saw the debut of the Born Into It commercial, which shows that sometimes our biggest rivals \u2014 in this case Manchester United and Manchester City fans \u2014 are more similar than we like to think.\n\nThe song in the commercial is Beginning of the End by the Cockney Rejects.

        "text":"Grovedale Little Athletics.\n\n...Frequently Asked Questions...\n\n\nWhen and how can I join the Grovedale Little Athletics Club ??\n\nThe Little Athletics year will begin\u00a0on the Saturday 14th November 2020, with the summer Track and Field competition running until March. The winter Cross Country\u00a0season then continues to the following August. You can register as a LAVic athlete after the 29th\u00a0October to compete in the 2020\/21 season\u00a0providing you are between the ages of 5 and 15 before the 31st December 2020.\n\nAll registrations are now completed on-line, payments are\u00a0made online via the LAVic registration portal. All registered athletes from last year will receive an email letting them know when and how to register on-line. New athletes will also register online and then can organise their Grovedale uniform\u00a0(competition tops) on their first day of competition at the Grovedale registration booth found at the South Western end of Landy Field athletics track (look for the big palm tree).\n\nA form of proof of age must be provided when signing in\u00a0for the first time. Typically a birth certificate or passport is best, but anything \"official\" will generally do.\n\n\nWhat costs are involved with Little Athletics\u00a0??\n\nFor the 2020\/21 season the registration fee is $152\u00a0per child - this includes registration with\u00a0Little Athletics Victoria (for the Track and Field and Cross Country seasons) , and all Geelong Little Athletics Centre Track and Field season fees. Registration for the Cross Country season only is $xx, but this does not include the weekly competition fee.\u00a0There are also additional regional and state events that your child may wish to compete in which incur an additional small registration fee.\n\nOnce registered, all Grovedale athletes must wear the Grovedale LAC uniform consisting of a yellow, black and white top (T-shirt, singlet or crop top - available for purchase from the club) and plain black shorts\/briefs (basketball or board shorts not permitted). Suitable footwear should be worn when competing.\u00a0\n\n\nCan you try Little Athletics before joining ??\n\nYes, new athletes can have up to two (2) weeks trial period before having to commit to being a full member. Parents will still need to register with LAVic via online registration (for insurance cover). At the end of the online registration process simply choose the \"pay later\" option. If after the try out you want to become a member, payment for registrations must be made online by 5pm Monday to be a registered competitor for\u00a0the following Saturday. It takes a few days for\u00a0processing, so to avoid disappointment on Saturday please make sure that you have signed up and paid by this time. Please bring a receipt of payment and proof of birth date\u00a0on Saturday morning.\n\n\nHow do I know what age group I will compete in ??\n\nAge groups are determined by the year and month of birth as detailed in the following\u00a0LAVic Registrar's Ready Reckoner:\n\nWhat do the children do at Little Aths ??\n\nOnce registered, all paid athletes are supplied with a plastic registration patch with their name and an identifying number and barcode that needs to be worn each week, attached to their singlet with 4 safety pins (which will be provided). It is the athlete's responsibility to bring this registration patch each week as the number is used to record their results at each event and the barcode is scanned after track events. Lost patches can be replaced for a fee of $5. There are 3 rotating programs of events and each age group will compete in 5 events on each day. (Under 8 athletes compete in 4 events each week).\n\nEvents are called over the loudspeaker so you need to listen out as each event will only be called 3 times. The announcement will tell you where to marshall for the event. Once there, the parent on duty will do a roll call to see who is there and put you in heats for the track events. The track events on the first few weeks are randomly selected, but once an athlete has a benchmark the heats are seeded according to results so athletes will be running against athletes with a similar time. The field events are also often split into 2 groups to utilise both jump pits, throwing rings or high jump mats but all Grovedale athletes will stay together. Athletes will get a practice jump or throw then 2 competition trials.\n\nOnce your event is completed or race finished, you may return to the Grovedale area to await your next event. To get to your field event there are orange cones around the track which is where you need to cross to get into the infield. Before you do please check that there are no circular races going on and you are not going to interfere with a race. Also do not cross the infield because there are javelins and discus being thrown into this area. You need to go around the outside and enter the field at the cones.\n\n\nWhat are the events ??\n\nRunning (70m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, cross country)\n\nHurdling (60m, 80, 90m, 100m, 300m)\n\nRace walking\n\nJumping (long jump, triple jump, high jump)\n\nThrowing (shot put, discus, javelin)\n\n\nWhere are the events held ??\n\nDuring the Track and Field season, athletes compete with the Geelong Little Athletic Centre at Landy Field (Barwon Terrace, South Geelong).\n\nDuring the Cross Country season, events are held around the Geelong, Bellarine and Surfcoast areas.\n\n\nWhat time does the program run??\n\nIn summer, Saturday morning Track and Field programs usually begin at 8:15am and finish around noon.\n\nIn winter, Sunday morning Cross Country programs usually begin at 11am and are usually finished by 12:30pm.\n\n\nHow long is the season ??\n\nThe Track and Field season begins in October and runs through until March, with a break at Christmas.\n\nThe Cross Country season begins in April and runs through to August.\n\n\nHow are performances monitored ??\n\nResults and weekly photos are published on the GLAC website,\u00a0and personal results can be found via logging into\u00a0resultshq\u00a0for which you will receive a username and password. If there are any discrepancies with your results please see your team manager the next week. Paper results can be printed from the website.\u00a0These can be cut out and pasted in the results book that you will be supplied with once registered.\n\n\nWhat other forms of competition are there ??\n\nThere are also Regional and State events which individuals can enter including Track and Field Events and a Multi-Event and Team Relays where athletes are chosen to compete for Geelong depending on results from the first few weeks of sprints.\u00a0\n\nTo enter the Regional and State individual events, registered athletes will be sent an email from LAVic and all entries are completed online. There is a charge for the Track and Field events (per event entered) and a fee for the Multi-event. There is a small\u00a0charge for the selected Geelong relay teams.\u00a0\n\nTo compete in these events athletes need to purchase a Geelong Centre singlet, which are available from the competition box on Saturday mornings. Parents are required to fill a duty position at either the Regional or State event if their child is competing. The duty positions are not hard as there are LAVic officials to run each of the events so you are just helping them.\n\nThe Geelong Little Athletics Centre runs a few special event days. The Be-your-best Multi-event Day is like an Olympic pentathlon of 5 events; Handicap Day sees seeded races with the back marker trying to chase down those in front of him\/ her; and Relay Day where athletes can run for their club with other team members.\n\nAt the end of the season Geelong Little Athletics Centre hold their Championship Day which is a celebration of the season that was, and a chance for athletes to win medals in their favourite events. A few weeks before the day you will be asked to enter this event by filling in a form that is available from the team managers. Entry is free and each athlete can compete in a maximum or 5 events - 3 track and 2 field OR 3 field and 2 track.\n\n\nWhat is expected of parents??\n\nBecause Little Athletics is a totally voluntary organisation, clubs cannot operate without the assistance of parents each week in fulfilling the many and varied duties required. These include officiating at an event; managing an age group; recording results; to name just a few. Grovedale have a duty roster and we are in charge of a high jump mat, a long jump pit, and circulars (races that involve more than 1 lap of the track). Additional assistance is always required on the Club and Centre committees and all parents are encouraged to become involved. Little Athletics is one of the few sports where parents can become fully involved in their child\u2019s sporting interests.\n\n\nWhat is expected of children ??\n\nChildren should behave in an appropriate manner and uphold the Little Aths motto of \"Family, Fun, Fitness\".\n\n\nIs there any training provided ??\n\nGrovedale runs club training sessions weekly during fourth term of school (times and venues TBA). Specialised coaching\u00a0is provided at Landy Field throughout the week by GLAC affiliated coaches in all events by a range of qualified coaches. Click on our training tab for more information regarding training times and venues.\n\n\nWhat about safety, insurance and first aid ??\n\nThe Geelong Little Athletics Centre has a strict safety policy and all registered athletes are covered by insurance through Little Athletics Australia and their insurers.\n\nProfessional first aid is provided at all Geelong events.\n\n\nWhat level of ability is needed to join ??\n\nOur emphasis is on fun and fitness. Children can join with any level of skill or fitness and are given plenty of encouragement to achieve their \"personal best\".\n\n\nWhat is available for\u00a0children with disabilities ??\n\nAll children are encouraged to join. At center level competition, Multiclass athletes are integrated with the other athletes, and may compete under modified rules depending on the degree of their disability, and the events being conducted. All LAVic Regional and State events are also open to ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Q & A about Travel Soccer\n\nOpen assessments are conducted each summer and are open to ages U9-19 and players are placed based upon past experience on teams and tryout performance. Teams will be formed based upon the final decision of the Director of Coaching and Board of Directors.\n\nQ & A about Travel Soccer\u00a0\n\n\n1. What is travel soccer?\n\nAnswer: Travel soccer is competitive soccer played against teams from other towns or communities. Games are played in the Western NY area as a member of the Buffalo and Western NY Junior Soccer League and\/or the Thruway League. Travel soccer is designed for players and parents who are willing to make a higher level of commitment in time, effort, training and competition. Players who have shown an interest and ability greater than most recreational players can benefit from moving to travel soccer. Most high school teams are made up of travel soccer players or most starters are the products of travel programs. If an ability or desire to play beyond high school exists, the player certainly must play travel and should explore ODP participation. Some of our teams that wish to play at the highest local level will compete in the Thruway League.\n\n\u00a0\u00a02. How is travel soccer different from recreational (house league) soccer?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Answer: There are three basic levels of soccer: recreational (house), travel, premier (for-profit clubs). Each level provides an increased level of commitment and cost. Amherst Soccer recommends parents let their child decide the level that suits them. Most young children benefit from playing with their friends and classmates in their own community, at least until they are older, have developed their skills in the correct environment or are ready to commit to one sport. Amherst strives to form as many teams as possible at the younger ages to give children a chance to experience travel soccer. Many premier teams are formed with players from throughout the region. \u00a0Some of our teams, due to retention of Amherst players and strength of the group, play at a premier (Thruway League) level. \u00a0 Our club coaches\u00a0can advise if your child is ready for travel or premier soccer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a03. How much time will my child be expected to devote to soccer?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Answer: Open to anyone from any town, teams are formed in August. Indoor practice will begin in November. Each Amherst team is scheduled 2 sessions per week in the North Amherst Rec Center\u00a0or Village Glen for practice.\u00a0 Some older groups are scheduled 1 session per week until April.\u00a0 Most teams also participate in indoor soccer leagues that play once per week from January to April. Outdoor practices start in the spring, weather permitting. Coaches at different levels have varying numbers of practice per week. Early in the season 2 per week is the minimum. Outdoor league games run once per week May to August on weeknights. Sometimes an overnight trip to play a tournament is included.\u00a0 The commitment is expected to be honored through the entire season. \u00a0Do not join a team if you are unwilling to honor a committment to attend and participate from November thru July.\n\n\u00a0\u00a04. Where do we \u201ctravel\u201d to?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Answer: Games are played around Western New York on weeknights. Most towns have clubs. Divisions of seven or eight teams are formed and home and away games are played. Examples of towns include, Clarence, Tonawanda, Hamburg, Orchard Park, Lancaster, Lockport, Lewiston, Wilson, Kenmore, West Seneca, etc. Tournaments are played on Saturdays AND Sundays around the area and in the Rochester area. Sometimes overnight trips are made to Erie, Cleveland or Binghamton. Should your child join a team that is entering the Thruway League, you will play league games against teams from Rochester, Syracuse, Albany and Binghamton, instead of local town teams (although the travel distance is farther for games, the number of games is fewer and season shorter).\n\n\u00a0\u00a05. What if my child plays another sport?\n\n\u00a0Answer: Travel soccer is not for everyone. A substantial time commitment is required. That being said, many of our players are able to juggle a schedule that includes baseball, basketball, swimming, dance, etc. Our coaches are expected to offer some consideration during the winter training season for conflicts.\u00a0 No one expects a child that is 8-12 years old to focus on just one sport or activity.\u00a0 Older children often play high school sports and the season starts later in May to accommodate game conflicts.\u00a0\u00a0 Once the outdoor season begins, soccer must become your first priority. If you are 13 and a travel baseball player, you would not be able to commit to travel soccer. Just because someone wants to play a spring high school sport does not relieve them of their commitment to the soccer team.\u00a0 Spring is our in-season time and playing time will be decreased if attendance is not regular.\u00a0 There will be a pre-season meeting to explain expectations. Every child who plays travel is expected to commit to a minimum of 75% of all team activities during the full year, not just games.\u00a0 Do not expect to receive much playing time if you show up for games and not practices.\u00a0 Commitment is important to teach to children and we expect the parents to be involved in maintaining this character trait. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a06. What is the difference between an \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d team?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Answer: Not much! Seriously, we have so many children who want to play travel soccer in Amherst that we are often able to form two teams in an age group. For purposes of development focus, at U9 or 10, we will no longer separate players by ability and just randomly assign players to teams or make them as equal as possible. We have the age-group pool all practice together at times. Soccer development is better served at the youngest ages by focusing on technical development. At U11 and older, children start to make decisions as to what sports and level of commitment they are willing to make. When we form teams,\u00a0the club will assure that the ability levels are appropriate throughout the team.\u00a0 This results in a better training environment for touches on the ball. We usually place teams in different divisions to allow appropriate competition. Many times one team is made up of players who have played for several years and the second team may be the newer players. This is done yearly and players move between the teams over time based upon development. Amherst second or \"B\" teams are stronger than many other clubs \u201cA\u201d teams. Sometimes the top 2 or 3 players on a \u201cB\u201d team improve more than the last 2 or 3 on an \u201cA\u201d team and will win a spot on that team the next year. Ideally, there could be movement of players between the teams each year based upon physical growth, soccer skill growth, personal interests, personal commitment to the sport and other factors. \u00a0 The expected commitment level should be the same at either level.\n\n\u00a0\u00a07. What if my child doesn\u2019t make the team? When will I find out?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Answer: We will try to have selections posted within 14 days of the assessments.\u00a0 The process will take place over the month of AUGUST. \u00a0 \u00a0 It is understood that coaches and the ASA staff constantly assess and\u00a0evaluate player performance.\u00a0\u00a0These ongoing assessments (from current year coaches) will weigh into player\u00a0placement decisions for the upcoming season. We do not expect players to earn their place based upon two hours at assessments when we have a year's worth of evaluations from coaches and staff.\u00a0 NEW PLAYERS need to attend these sessions to be considered for a place on a team.\u00a0 If unable to attend, the Travel Coordinators will assign those new players to teams later after the initial round of assignments.\n\nIn order to secure a roster spot, players must commit no later than Sept 1 by paying in full online\u00a0. Any player not paying online by that date will be assumed to be not interested and we will immediately move to the next available player that would be offered a place on that team. \u00a0If considering other options, make your decisions during this period and let us know if you are declining.\n\nPlayers not accepted to the first team, will also be asked to register online if they wish to be considered for the potential teams to be formed later and possible movement up should other players decline.\u00a0 The process will need to be adhered to for us to understand your true interest and commitment (monetary) and for formation of additional teams. \u00a0Only those who pay the fee online will be included. \u00a0Just registering without payment does not secure a place on any team.\n\nIf we need to find a place to play for any child willing and able to make the commitment expected and have the numbers to form a team, they may be placed on a mixed age-group team and not necessarily with their friends.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a08. How much will my child play?\n\n\u00a0Answer: The League and Amherst Soccer have a rule that \u201cevery child who plays on a team will play 50% at age 9-12\u201d.\u00a0 Sometimes this is difficult to assess and control at each game but, should be equalized over the season.\u00a0 Additionally, each child should play a variety of positions on the field.\u00a0 If your child is only playing one position or not enough, you have an obligation to ask the coach why and contact the\u00a0Travel Coordinator.\u00a0 The best defender at 10 years old could be the best forward at 15 and the best player at 10 is many times not the best at 15 due to growth and development differences.\u00a0\u00a0 Coaches are encouraged to train the total player and not focus all of their attention on winning. After age 12, more specialization will begin although the coaches are encouraged to play the kids at more than one position. You will see the players themselves starting to determine where they feel the most comfortable by 14.\u00a0 ASA has changed coaches in the past for failure to adhere to the 50% rule. Older players will receive more or less playing time based upon the discretion of the coach. Factors that affect time include: attendance, attitude, effort, and ability. ASA coaches at U14-19 make every effort to be fair to all playe... (truncated)",

        "text":"Often asked: When Was Karate Invented?\n\nWho created karate?\n\nThe Father of Modern Karate. Funakoshi Gichin was born on Nov 10, 1868 in Yamakawa, Shuri, Okinawa Prefecture.

Bruce Lee remains the greatest icon of martial arts cinema and a key figure of modern popular media.\n\nIs Kung Fu older than karate?\n\n\u201d Kung Fu \u201d is a modern term applied to a sect of ancient Chinese martial arts forms. However, Karate was developed in Japan out of a martial arts practice called \u201cte\u201d involving hand movements. Karate was then further influenced by Chinese martial arts styles, which explains the connection between the two forms.\n\nWhat is the most brutal fighting style?\n\nKung Fu. Getty No list of deadly martial arts would be complete without Kung Fu.

Each form is derived in some way from the karate established by Gichin Funakoshi.\n\nDoes Karate come from China?\n\nKarate is a type of Japanese martial art, which originated in Okinawa.
