This chapter interprets the linkages between domestic events and international strategies on the network of global security relations in terms of neo-geopolitics rather than mainstream United States (US) scholarship. It deals with Chinese perception of and strategies toward countries in the Greater Middle East (GME), keeping in mind that the GME does not exist as a regional concept in Chinese policy-making. The creation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in 1996 was the beginning of Chinese attempts to limit US influence in the heart of Eurasia, followed in particular by initiatives in numerous other countries of the GME since 2004.\n\nKeywords: China; Eurasia; Greater Middle East (GME); international politics; Japan; Pakistan; Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO); United States (US)\n\n\n\nCan't access your account?\n  \u2022 Tools\n\n  \u2022 Add to Favorites\n  \u2022 Printable version\n  \u2022 Email this page\n  \u2022 Recommend to your\u00a0library\n\n    You must fill out fields marked with: *\n\n    Librarian details\n    Your details\n    Why are you recommending this title?\n    Select reason:\n    The Greater Middle East in Global Politics \u2014 Recommend this title to your library\n  \u2022 Export citations\n  \u2022 Key\n\n  \u2022 Full access\n  \u2022 Open Access\n  \u2022 Partial\/No accessInformation",

Filed on behalf of the UAW International, which includes the radical Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Latin Americans for Social and Economic Development (LA SED), a county election official, and several voters, the ACLU's Sept. 17 lawsuit charges that the citizenship question was not approved through proper channels and violates the 1965 Voting Rights Act because two townships it affects come under federal jurisdiction.
