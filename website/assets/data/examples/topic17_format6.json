        "text":"Painting China Green: The Next Sino-American Tussle\n\nWhen Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji meets President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in Washington in April, the political climate is unlikely to be auspicious. The United States and China have reached a virtual stalemate on each of their traditional agenda items. Negotiations over China's entry into the World Trade Organization have stalled; China's continued drive for reunification with Taiwan offers little potential for fruitful dialogue; and human rights remains an elusive area for compromise. Yet the Sino-American relationship may well define global prosperity and military security in the 21st century. Allowing it to deteriorate risks a future punctuated by frequent military and economic conflicts and global instability. Both sides are eager to sustain the illusion of progress produced by the recent presidential summits. Hence, a centerpiece of the talks will likely be a subject viewed by both as uncontroversial-environmental cooperation.\n\nChinese and American leaders believe that the environment is a low priority issue with plenty of common ground. This is a big mistake. The environment is as complex as other key diplomatic issues, featuring differing interests and priorities, weak Chinese institutions, Chinese defiance of international agreements, and conflict between Congress and the White House over how to achieve U.S. aims.\n\nMoreover, environmental issues have direct and serious implications for other U.S. foreign policy objectives. A warmer Sino-American relationship is stymied by China's reluctance to seek any middle ground with the United States until it is in firm control domestically. But the environmental problems created by China's recent economic boom now threaten the country's fragile social, political, and economic infrastructure. This is a momentous issue, and the question is: Is China's economic growth sustainable? Progress in bilateral discussions rests on China's resolution of it. Fleeing to the environment as a short-term foreign policy sanctuary will be treacherous if these complications are ignored. If fully understood and thoughtfully addressed, however, China's environmental problems offer a unique opportunity for the United States to cooperate with China on a vital issue.\n\n\nRegister for free to continue reading.\nRegistered users get access to two free articles every month.\n\nOr subscribe now and save 55 percent.\n\nSubscription benefits include:\n  \u2022 Full access to\n  \u2022 Six issues of the magazine\n  \u2022 Foreign Affairs iPad app privileges\n  \u2022 Special editorial collections\n\nLatest Commentary & News analysis",

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 North Korea is demanding that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo no longer take part in any further talks involving its nuclear weapons program. Kwon Jong Gun, a senior official in the North\u2019s foreign ministry, says Pyongyang wants someone who is \u201cmore careful and mature in communicating,\u201d according to a report by the official KCNA news agency. Kwon Jong Gun\u2019s comments were released hours after the regime announced that the North had tested a new \u201ctactical guided weapon,\u201d the latest display of Pyongyang\u2019s military capabilities. KCNA said Kim Jong Un supervised and guided the Wednesday test, calling it an operation of \u201cvery weighty significance.\u201d The KCNA report did not elaborate on the type of weapon tested, but the phrase \u201ctactical\u201d suggests it is not a ballistic missile. Still, the test could be seen as a warning to the United States, amid an impasse in talks over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cKim is trying to make a statement to the Trump administration that his military potential is growing by the day, and that his regime is becoming frustrated with Washington\u2019s lack of flexibility in recent negotiations,\u201d says Harry Kazianis, director of Korean Studies at the Center for the National Interest. A U.S. military official said late Wednesday the Pentagon is aware of the reported test, but has no further comment. North Korea has not carried out a nuclear or long-range missile test for well over a year, since Kim began talks with the United States and South Korea. Instead, the North has carried out smaller provocations. In November, Kim oversaw the test of what KCNA also referred to as a newly developed \u201chigh-tech tactical weapon.\u201d U.S. officials later played down the significance of that test. \u200bStalled talks Nuclear negotiations between the...

        "text":"\n\nRomney to speak at conservative conference\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After months of avoiding the limelight following his unsuccessful presidential bid, Mitt Romney is planning to make his first public speech next month at a large gathering of conservatives.\n\nRomney is scheduled to address the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 15, a gathering just outside Washington where some of the top Republicans will try to make their mark.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nAmong the other speakers this year will be Senator Marco Rubio of Florida; Representative Paul Ryan, who was Romney\u2019s running mate; former Florida governor Jeb Bush; and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.\n\n\u201cI look forward to saying thank you to the many friends and supporters who were instrumental in helping my campaign,\u201d Romney said in a statement.\n\nCPAC is the same conference where Romney officially dropped out of the Republican primary race in 2008, and where last year he said he had been a \u201cseverely conservative Republican governor.\u201d\n\nRomney has kept out of the public eye since he lost the election.\n\nHe has attended several gatherings with his former donors, meant as events to thank them, but all of them have been private.\n\nAt one of those events, he told supporters that he planned to stay politically active by supporting like-minded candidates and weighing in on issues he cared about.\n\nBut so far Romney has kept quiet.\n\nNews that Romney would speak, first reported by National Review Online, was confirmed by the American Conservative Union, which hosts the event.\n\n\u201cThe thousands gathered at CPAC this year are eager to hear from the 2012 GOP presidential candidate at his first public appearance since the elections,\u201d Al Cardenas, chairman of the ACU, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to hearing Governor Romney\u2019s comments on the current state of affairs in America and the world, and his perspective on the future of the conservative movement.\u201d\n\nEx-senator Olympia Snowe joins bipartisanship group\n\nAUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Former senator Olympia Snowe is joining a national organization that highlights the adverse effects of America\u2019s partisan political divide and suggests ways to promote unity, the organization said Wednesday.\n\nSnowe, a Republican, is joining the Bipartisan Policy Center as a senior fellow. She will co-chair its newly formed Commission on Political Reform, the center said.\n\nThe commission\u2019s diverse group of 30 leaders will conduct a series of \u2018\u2018National Conversations on American Unity\u2019\u2019 to discuss the effects of political polarization and to develop recommendations to help Americans achieve shared national goals.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center was founded in 2007 by former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Tom Daschle, Bob Dole, and George Mitchell. It is the only Washington, D.C.-based think tank that actively promotes bipartisanship.\n\nSnowe, long known as a moderate who bucked the Republican line on some issues, surprised Maine\u2019s political establishment in February 2012 when she announced she would not seek a fourth Senate term. She has been critical of polarization and partisanship that she believes have made it harder for Congress to make decisions on important issues.\n\nHer departure led to crowded primaries and finally the election of her independent successor, Angus King, whose campaign theme was restoring a cooperative spirit in Washington.\n\nBipartisan Policy Center president Jason Grumet said the organization welcomes Snowe\u2019s \u2018\u2018independent voice, passionate ideals, collaborative instinct, and wise counsel.\u2019\u2019\n\nSnowe said she \u2018\u2018couldn\u2019t be more pleased and excited to join this dynamic and growing organization, whose mission is absolutely essential at this moment of unparalleled polarization in our nation, and certainly in our government.\u2019\u2019\n\nPanetta warns automatic cuts may lead to furloughs\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Congress on Wednesday that if automatic government spending cuts kick in on March 1 he may be compelled to furlough the \u2018\u2018vast majority\u2019\u2019 of the Defense Department\u2019s 800,000 civilian workers.\n\nHe also said the across-the-board spending reductions would \u2018\u2018put us on a path toward a hollow force,\u2019\u2019 meaning a military incapable of fulfilling all of its missions.\n\nIn a written message to employees, Panetta said any affected workers would get at least 30 days\u2019 advance notice.\n\nEmployees would lose one day of work per week, for up to 22 weeks, probably starting in late April.\n\nTo dispel the notion that this is mainly a problem for the nation\u2019s capital, the Pentagon\u2019s budget chief, Robert Hale, told reporters that the economic impact would be felt nationwide.\n\nThe furloughs would be part of a broader plan the Pentagon is preparing in order to cut $46 billion through the end of this budget year, which ends Sept. 30.\n\nMore cuts would come in future years as long as the automatic government spending cuts, known as sequestration, remained in effect.\n\nConan O\u2019Brien to host correspondents\u2019 dinner\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Late night talk show host and comedian Conan O\u2019Brien will be spending a late night with President Obama.\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association has chosen O\u2019Brien as the featured act for its annual dinner on April 27.\n\nAssociation president Ed Henry called O\u2019Brien \u2018\u2018one of television\u2019s most innovative and influential talents.\u2019\u2019\n\nHenry added: \u2018\u2018As social media has changed all aspects of the media business, Conan has embraced this shifting landscape to become a creative force both online as well as in the traditional television model.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe association dinner is traditionally attended by the president and first lady, government officials, and journalists. Proceeds finance scholarships and awards that recognize journalism excellence.\n\nO\u2019Brien appears prepared. On Monday he tweeted: \u2018\u2018In honor of President\u2019s Day, I won\u2019t be getting along with Congress.\u2019\u2019\n\nLoading comments...\nSubscriber Log In\n\nYou have reached the limit of 5 free articles in a month\n\nStay informed with unlimited access to Boston\u2019s trusted news source.\n\n  \u2022 High-quality journalism from the region\u2019s largest newsroom\n  \u2022 Convenient access across all of your devices\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s Headlines daily newsletter\n  \u2022 Subscriber-only access to exclusive offers, events, contests, eBooks, and more\n  \u2022 Less than 25\u00a2 a week\nMarketing image of\nMarketing image of\nAlready a subscriber?\nYour city.

Korea fires projectiles before Xi's Seoul visit\n\nAssociated Press Wednesday, July 02, 2014\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea on Wednesday fired two short-range projectiles into waters off its east coast, South Korean officials said, on the eve of Chinese President Xi Jinping's talks in Seoul expected to focus on the North's nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe launches, the third in a week, were believed to be sending a message that the North is boosting its defenses and expressing its displeasure that Xi will become the first Chinese leader to visit rival South Korea before the North, analysts say.\n\nThe article you requested is no longer available on BostonHerald.com.\n\u00bb Click here to view this article in the Associated Press' archive.\n\nJoin the Conversation",
