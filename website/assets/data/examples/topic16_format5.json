        "text":"New York Times Bestselling Author Kay Hooper\nPurchase Kay's Books\n\nAbout Kay\nThe World of Bishop\nFor Writers\nFAQs - For Readers\nQuestions from readers ...\n\nI often receive questions from readers, and after a time a pattern emerges, giving me a fairly good idea what sort of questions most of you have. So I hope you find this area interesting and informative. And if I don't answer your question here, be sure to write and tell me what you'd like to know so that I may include the information here in future updates.\n\nWill there be a third Thief book?\nYes \u2014 though I can't give you a firm publication date as yet. Despite my best efforts, I just had too much on my plate these last couple of years (career stuff, family stuff, building my dream house) to give Quinn the attention I feel he deserves. However, there WILL be a third Thief book, and quite likely more, since he appears to have much to say and many adventures ahead of him and Morgan. Please do keep an eye on the website, and as soon as I have firm publication dates, cover art and cover copy, the info will be posted.\n\nWill the Bishop\/Special Crimes Unit series continue?\nYes, absolutely. I'll continue to publish the series in trilogies, each set with a keyword in the title and the covers, hopefully, linked together with some visual element such as the spiderweb in the Fear trilogy, and the black-gloved hand in the Evil trilogy.\n\nAre you going to reissue more of your old (classic!) romances?\nYes. That's also being worked-out as I write this (the author seldom has complete control of such things, though I'm trying!), so please do keep an eye on the site for updates.\n\nWill you write the sequel to Summer of the Unicorn?\nIf I had to say one way or the other right now, I'd have to say no \u2014 simply because it isn't in the plans at present. However, I get many requests for other fantasy\/romance novels such as Unicorn and The Wizard of Seattle, and I would like to write more along those lines someday. So you never know. Again, please do check back, and I'll update the website as I have new information to offer.\n\nHow about the Lane Montana mysteries?\nSame there. I have no plans at present to continue that series, but I would like to revisit Lane at some point. Never say never.\n\nWill you ever include a bulletin board or blog on your site?\nNot likely. I know many authors happily blog or set up a board where their readers can post comments, but the truth is that I feel my writing time is better spent writing my books. I'll always do my best to be responsive to readers, but I've never been inclined to write in a journal even just for myself, and see no reason to turn to public journaling (blogging) now. As for a board on the site, that also can cause more problems than provide benefits, for you and for me. So I think we'll keep the site as-is for now.\n\nThough suggestions are always welcome!\n\nWhere do you get your ideas?\nThe number one most-asked question. And the most difficult to answer, because of the nature of what writers do. We use our imaginations literally every waking moment; I see or hear something, and my plot-trained conscious mind begins to spin a possible story. So the short answer is that I get my ideas everywhere \u2014 but mostly from inside my head. I read a great deal, I watch TV and movies, I talk to people. And out of that wealth of information come my ideas.\n\nWhat's your work routine?\nI don't really have one. When and how long I work is dependent on where I am in a book or project. Early on, I may spend a great deal of time thinking and musing about an idea without turning on the computer once. Writing down bits and pieces of ideas, snatches of dialogue, character descriptions. When I have begun the actual physical work of writing, the early chapters tend to go slowly as I feel my way through the story \"seeding\" plot and character points that will develop along the way. Once I've reached the halfway point in a story, the plot is firmly set, the characters \"alive\" in the sense that I now know them very well and understand why they do the things they do. The remainder of the book tends to be written much faster, and I work longer hours. It isn't uncommon in the final chapters of a book for me to work ten or twelve hour stretches for several days at a time.\n\nHow long does it take you to write a book?\nIt varies. In the old days of series romance, it wasn't unusual for me to complete a book in three or four weeks. These days, writing longer and much more complicated thrillers, it tends to take several months between the beginning of a book and its completion.\n\nDo you ever go on book tours?\nIf my publisher asks me to. Publishers vary in their beliefs and experiences as to what sells books best; my publisher tends not to send its authors out on the road very often. In all honesty, I believe my time is better spent here working. Not being an extrovert I'm afraid travel takes a great deal out of me. But there are trips from time to time, book signings and the rare speaking engagement; I will do my best to have information here at my site (in the online newsletter) whenever such a trip is planned.\n\nDo you read all the reader mail you receive?\nYou bet I do. And I answer myself \u2014 which is why I'm constantly behind and why my online mailbox is usually full. If you don't receive a reply within a reasonable time (two or three weeks, maybe), please do write again \u2014 I never mind repeated queries.\n\nQuestions from Aspiring Writers?

        "text":"Advice to Authors\n\nFAQs \u00a0|\u00a0 Advice to Authors\n\nHow does one get published?\n\nHow do you do it? You do it.\n\nYou write.\n\nYou finish what you write.\n\nYou look for publishers who publish \"that kind of thing\", whatever it is. You send them what you've done (a letter asking if they'd like to see a whole manuscript or a few chapters and an outline will always be welcome. And stamped self-addressed envelopes help keep the wheels turning.)\n\nSooner or later, if you don't give up and you have some measurable amount of ability or talent or luck, you get published. But for people who don't know where to begin, let me offer a few suggestions:\n\nMeet editors. If you're into SF, Horror or Fantasy, go to the kinds of SF, Horror or Fantasy conventions that editors go to (mainly the big ones - look for words like WORLD or NATIONAL in the title). Same goes for Romance or Crime. Join associations - SFWA or HWA or the Romance Writers of America or The Society of Authors. Most organisations like that have an associate membership for people who wouldn't qualify for a full membership.\n\nEven if you haven't met any editors, send your stuff out.\n\nThe \"slush pile\" of unsolicited manuscripts is not always a bad thing - publishers take enormous pleasure in finding authors from the slush pile (Iain Banks and Storm Constantine are both writers who simply sent out manuscripts to publishers), although it occurs rarely enough that it has to be a special thing when it happens.\n\nIf you write short stories, don't worry about agents, just find places that might print the stories and get them out there. If you write novels, I think it's six of one, half a dozen of the other. I'd written and published 3 books before I decided it was time to get an agent.\n\nWriters groups can be good and they can be bad. Depends on the people in them, and what they're in them for.\n\nOn the whole, anything that gets you writing and keeps you writing is a good thing. Anything that stops you writing is a bad thing. If you find your writers group stopping you from writing, then drop it.\n\nThe other thing I'd suggest is Use The Web.\n\nUse it for anything you can - writers groups, feedback, networking, finding out how things work, getting published. It exists: take advantage of it.\n\nBelieve in yourself. Keep writing.\n\nHow do you write comics?\n\nWhen I decided I wanted to write comics in 1985 I went out and bought Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art. If I were doing it now I'd also buy Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics. I'd look at some comics scripts (there's one reprinted in the back of Dream Country, although there are an almost infinite number of ways to write a comics script, and that's only one.)\n\nAnd then I'd read a lot of comics and try to work out what works and what doesn't and why. And then I'd start drawing some comics for myself, not for people to see, just to figure out how to get from one panel to the next, one page to the next. If you're going to work with an artist, now's a good time to go and meet artists.\n\nYou'll do best if you realise that there is a lot to know. Most bad comics are written by people who don't know that there is anything to learn... (Many of them were written by writers who are successful in other fields.) Having something to say is fairly essential, too.\n\nGood luck. Write good comics.\n\nHi. I was wondering are there any tips you can give me on handling revisions of work. I'm starting to finish things off (short stories)but when I get to the end and look back I start to get a bit of a sickly feeling in my stomache. Do you have any suggestions for adopting a healthy approach to ironing out the creases, and arriving at something I can be a bit happier about.\nYours perplexedly,\n\n\nThe best advice I can give on this is, once it's done, to put it away until you can read it with new eyes. Finish the short story, print it out, then put it in a drawer and write other things. When you're ready, pick it up and read it, as if you've never read it before. If there are things you aren't satisfied with as a reader, go in and fix them as a writer: that's revision.",

        "text":"UNZ.org - Periodicals, Books, and Authors\nMany Millions of Pages of Readable, Searchable Content at Your Fingertips\nHomeArticlesBooksPower Search+\nClipboard - No Items\n\nQ: What is UNZ.org?\n\nA: The UNZ.org website is intended to provide convenient access to a large quantity of high-quality content material, mostly published over the last 150 years in America and England, including both articles and books, encompassing over one million readable items and titles of another million items not readable due to copyright. Much of this material has never previously been available anywhere on the Internet and should be useful for researchers and intellectual historians.\n\nQ: Why do you include non-readable articles and books?\n\nA: The inclusion of the copyright-excluded material allows users to examine a more nearly complete collection of a given author's writings, even if many of the particular items themselves are currently unavailable due to copyright. If necessary, many of these other items can often be accessed and read on other websites or content systems, especially in the case of extent publications. Furthermore, there is a chance that at some future point these publications will be released for reading on this website as well.\n\nQ: The website seems very different than when I previously visited. What's the story?\n\nA: The current Version 2.0 release of UNZ.org incorporates major design changes from the previous version, but nearly all of the same underlying printed content is still available. Given the relatively slight use of the previous links to external videos and webzines, these portions have been removed, thereby streamlining access to the printed materials which constitute the main value of the system. Another major change has been the widespread use of Javascript, rendering most of the pages \"reactive\" as you begin entering information.\n\nQ: How do I find a given author or publication?\n\nA: Most of the main pages of the website contain one or more \"Reactive Clouds,\" with the names of various authors or publications. Javascript functions cause these Clouds to \"react\" and change the displayed information as you begin typing in the entry boxes. For example, as you enter the first few letters of an author's name on the Home page, the Clouds adjust to display only those authors whose names begin with those letters. Similar adjustments occur as you start typing in a particular decade or year, or if you select one of the drop-down settings or other filter. This allows you to quickly focus in on the individuals you are seeking based on your particular criteria.\n\nAt any point, the relative size of the names in a given Cloud indicates the volume of underlying content material associated with that name. Meanwhile, the color indicates what fraction of the content material is readable (for copyright reasons): bright blue indicates mostly readable, dark blue indicates partly readable, and black means mostly unreadable\n\nQ: How do I find a given article or book?\n\nA: The main Articles and Books pages, as well as the Overview tabs for individual authors or publications, display a Listing of articles (or books) towards the bottom of the page. Like the Clouds, these Listings are \"reactive\" and automatically adjust as you being typing in any of the information in the various data entry fields---Title, Author, Publication, or Period, displaying only those items that match your selection.\n\nQ: What about the individual publications?\n\nA: When you reach the pages associated with a given publication, you can examine the contents in a number of different ways, accessed via the different tabs. The default Overview tab gives you the Cloud of authors for that publication plus the Listing of individual articles, with both of these being \"reactive\" as you provide information in the Title, Author, or Period fields.\n\nThere are also several other tabs. The Tree tab displays a dynamic tree allowing the individual time periods, issues, and articles to be opened for greate detail. The Year Contents tab displays the tables of contents for all the issues of a given year, the Issues, Small Covers, and Large Covers tabs display those views of the contents for a given decade, and the All Years tab provides an overview of the entire archive of the periodical. In addition, the drop down field in the control bar may be used to explore the different periods. All these pages allow for convenient browsing of the contents of a given periodical and clicking on any of the individual links accessing more detailed information.\n\nQ: How does Searching work?\n\nA: As mentioned above, much of the exploration of the website contents is normally performed by browsing the various different pages or entering information into the various text fields and having the displayed information automatically adjust. Actual Searches are performed in a parallel manner, by entering the target information into the data fields and then pressing the Search button (or simply hitting Enter). The system then performs a Search across the selected Text, Title, Author, and other information and displays the findings in a new Search Results tab.\n\nSearches may be performed on any of these individual pages, or on the Power Search page, which allows for more detailed Searches across all content material.\nSharing Comment via Twitter\n\nFull HTML link for this page:\nClickable HTML link for this page:\nThe Century Magazine Archives\nTitle Author Period Text\nType?

        "text":"What is metaphor in poetry\n\nWhat is an example of a metaphor?\n\nSimply put, a metaphor is a figure of speech containing an implied comparison. \u2026 Here\u2019s a metaphor example: \u201cThe curtain of night fell upon us.\u201d In this metaphor, the evening did not develop into a velvet curtain. Rather, simple words are being used to paint a colorful picture.\n\nWhat is meant by metaphor in poetry?\n\nMetaphors. Alice E.M. Underwood. \u00b7 Grammar Tips. A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn\u2019t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison.\n\nWhat are the 5 examples of metaphor?\n\nEveryday Life Metaphors\n\n  \u2022 John\u2019s suggestion was just a Band-Aid for the problem.\n  \u2022 The cast on his broken leg was a plaster shackle.\n  \u2022 Laughter is the music of the soul.\n  \u2022 America is a melting pot.\n  \u2022 Her lovely voice was music to his ears.\n  \u2022 The world is a stage.\n  \u2022 My kid\u2019s room is a disaster area.\n  \u2022 Life is a rollercoaster.\n\nHow do you identify a metaphor in a poem?\n\nSo, to find a metaphor in a poem, look for something that is being compared to something else. So, if a poet said \u201cmy life is a dream,\u201d that would be a metaphor. For an example from Shakespeare \u2014 it\u2019s not poetry, it\u2019s Romeo and Juliet. But Romeo says \u201cbut soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\n\nHow do you identify a metaphor?\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at an overview for the step-by-step process used for identifying and analysing a metaphor:\n\n  1. Ask yourself if the sentence or phrase compares two things.\n  2. See if the sentence uses a word such as \u201cas\u201d or \u201clike\u201d as a preposition. \u2026\n  3. See what the metaphor is comparing.\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 Pulitzer prize in poetry\n\nWhat is a metaphor for life?\n\nMetaphors for life are a way of comparing life to other things in a way that may help you think about your life and problems in a different way. Collectively, metaphors not only help people describe and make sense of their lives, but can serve as a source of encouragement, motivation, or gratitude.\n\nIs I\u2019m starving a metaphor?\n\nHyperbole: Hyperbole compares or describes things in an exaggerated way for the sake of emphasis. It is common, for example, to pronounce, \u201cI\u2019m starving\u201d when one is merely hungry or \u201cI\u2019m freezing\u201d when one is quite cold.\n\nWhat is a metaphor short definition?\n\na figure of speech in which a term or phrase is applied to something to which it is not literally applicable in order to suggest a resemblance, as in \u201cA mighty fortress is our God.\u201dCompare mixed metaphor, simile (def. 1). something used, or regarded as being used, to represent something else; emblem; symbol.\n\nWhat is a metaphor to describe someone?\n\nA metaphor is a word or phrase that is used to describe a person or object and in so doing makes an understood comparison; unfortunately, this \u2018understood\u2019 comparison is not always easy to understand. For example, \u2018Her sunny face was a pleasing sight\u2019. Her face couldn\u2019t literally (in real) be sunny.\n\nWhat are common metaphors?\n\nExamples of Common MetaphorsAnger bottled up insideHe was a Lion on the battlefieldScapegoatA shot across the bowsHigh and drySea of beesAn endless nightHis eye on the SparrowSea of fireApple of my eyeHome was prisonSea of ghostsBatten down the hatchesHomework is a breezeSea of knowledge\u0415\u0449\u0451 50\u00a0\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043a\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 Line in poetry\n\nWhat is the best metaphor?\n\nHere is a list of famous metaphors or famous sayings \/ quotes that are metaphors.\n\n  \u2022 \u201cAnd your very flesh shall be a great poem.\u201d \u2026\n  \u2022 \u201cAdvertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket.\u201d \u2026\n  \u2022 \u201cDying is a wild night and a new road.\u201d \u2026\n  \u2022 \u201cFill your paper with the breathings of your heart.\u201d \u2026\n  \u2022 \u201cConscience is a man\u2019s compass.\u201d\n\nWhat is a metaphor example for students?\n\nA metaphor is a comparison which is not literally true. It suggests what something is like by comparing it with something else with similar characteristics. For example: \u2018My brother\u2019 is a piglet is a metaphor.\n\nHow do you start a metaphor?\n\nHow to create fantastic metaphors.\n\n  1. Choose a character, object, or setting.

        "text":"Characteristics of Postmodernism\n\nQUESTION: What are the characteristics of Postmodernism?\n\n\nWhen listing the chracteristics of postmodernism, it is important to remember that postmodernists do not place their philosophy in a defined box or category. Their beliefs and practices are personal rather than being identifiable with a particular establishment or special interest group. The following principles appear elemental to postmodernists:\n  \u2022 There is no absolute truth - Postmodernists believe that the notion of truth is a contrived illusion, misused by people and special interest groups to gain power over others.\n\n  \u2022 Truth and error are synonymous - Facts, postmodernists claim, are too limiting to determine anything. Changing erratically, what is fact today can be false tomorrow.\n\n  \u2022 Self-conceptualization and rationalization - Traditional logic and objectivity are spurned by postmodernists. Preferring to rely on opinions rather than embrace facts, postmodernist spurn the scientific method.\n\n  \u2022 Traditional authority is false and corrupt - Postmodernists speak out against the constraints of religious morals and secular authority. They wage intellectual revolution to voice their concerns about traditional establishment.\n\n  \u2022 Ownership - They claim that collective ownership would most fairly administrate goods and services.\n\n  \u2022 Disillusionment with modernism - Postmodernists rue the unfulfilled promises of science, technology, government, and religion.\n\n  \u2022 Morality is personal - Believing ethics to be relative, postmodernists subject morality to personal opinion. They define morality as each person\u2019s private code of ethics without the need to follow traditional values and rules.\n\n  \u2022 Globalization \u2013 Many postmodernists claim that national boundaries are a hindrance to human communication. Nationalism, they believe, causes wars. Therefore, postmodernists often propose internationalism and uniting separate countries.\n\n  \u2022 All religions are valid - Valuing inclusive faiths, postmodernists gravitate towards New Age religion. They denounce the exclusive claims of Jesus Christ as being the only way to God.\n\n  \u2022 Liberal ethics - Postmodernists defend the cause of feminists and homosexuals.\n\n  \u2022 Pro-environmentalism - Defending \u201cMother Earth,\u201d postmodernists blame Western society for its destruction.\nPostmodernism - Learn More!",

Magyar (say \u2018modge-are\u2019) language is not similar to the Slavic, Germanic or Romance (Neo-Latin) languages. Hungarian is said to be one of the most difficult languages in the world.\n\nHungarian Language Tree in Szephalom, Hungary\n\nHungarian Language Tree in Szephalom - photo by Roland Toth\n\nYet it does not mean that you couldn\u2019t learn a couple of survival terms in Hungarian, or even have a more in-depth and thorough Hungarian language course in downtown Budapest. You must be crazy, admittedly, to try to take up Hungarian classes, and say words like \u2018K\u00f6sz\u00f6n\u00f6m\u2019 (Thank you), and Szia! (Hello\u2019 and \u2018Goodbye\u2019), but Hungarians will simply like you for trying to communicate with them in their own challenging and pretty isolated language. Igen, gyere tanulj magyarul! (Yes, come and learn in Hungarian!). Looks mouthful, right?\n\nThe Hungarian language is related to the Finno-Ugric languages, most notably the Finnish language (several smaller languages in the family are now out of use or on the way to become obsolete, replaced by Russian).\n\nSome popular words that the English language borrowed from Hungarian are as follows:\n\n  \u2022 \u2018coach'(meaning kocsi, i.e. car, or cart and named after the Hungarian village where \u2018kocsi\u2019-s were made)\n  \u2022 \u2018biro\u2019 for ball point pen (after the family name of the inventor Laszlo Biro, biro originally meaning \u2018judge\u2019)\n  \u2022 Rubik cube or magic cube (after the Hungarian inventor Erno Rubik)\n  \u2022 \u2018goulash\u2019 (gulyas, i.e. stew\u00a0 \u2013 stewed vegetable-meat soup, which is absolutely not the same goulash you will eat outside of Hungary, we guarantee it is much better and flavoursome!)\n  \u2022 \u2018paprika\u2019 (paprika, the spice)\n  \u2022 \u2018hussar\u2019 (huszar, i.e. a member of a European light cavalry unit)\n  \u2022 Hungarian breeds \u2013\u00a0 dog names like puli, vizsla, kuvasz and komondor\n  \u2022 Hungarian breeds \u2013 e.g. the furry pig, famous for its low cholesterol levels: mangalica (mangalitsa in English), etc.\n\nHere is a beautiful Hungarian Puli couple: they are cool, aren\u2019t they?\n\nHungarian Puli\n\nHungarian Puli - photo by Anita Ritenour\n\nAnd to stay on the cute line, here is a funny Hungarian vizsla puppy too:\n\nHungarian Vizsla\n\nHungarian Vizsla - photo by Scott Benjamin\n\nFinally, the Hungarian furry \u2013 hairy pig called Mangalitsa:\n\nMangalitsa - Hungarian hairy pig - the red Curly stands out\n\nMangalitsa - meet Curly, the Hungarian hairy pig - photo by Thomas Lieser\n\n\n\nNo comments yet.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.",

But my favorite source is the\u00a0Beau Monde, a Regency\/Georgian Chapter of Romance Writers of America. A collection of knowledgeable and generous history buffs gather and share tips and sources for any question I can think of asking. They even know stuff it never occurred to me to ask.\n\nSome of my favorite historical blogs are: Historical Hussies, Two Nerdy History Girls, \u00a0Jane Austen\u2019s World, Candice Hern, Regina Scott, among others.\n\n\nWhat is new and upcoming?\n\nperf5.000x8.000.inddMy newest release is a sweet, short Christmas story.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s called A CHRISTMAS REUNION, the Gift of a Second Chance\u00a0and you can find it for only $.99 on\u00a0\u00a0Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and directly from my\u00a0publisher,\u00a0The Wild Rose Press.

        "text":"UNZ.org - Periodicals, Books, and Authors\nMany Millions of Pages of Readable, Searchable Content at Your Fingertips\nHomeArticlesBooksPower Search+\nClipboard - No Items\n\nQ: What is UNZ.org?\n\nA: The UNZ.org website is intended to provide convenient access to a large quantity of high-quality content material, mostly published over the last 150 years in America and England, including both articles and books, encompassing over one million readable items and titles of another million items not readable due to copyright. Much of this material has never previously been available anywhere on the Internet and should be useful for researchers and intellectual historians.\n\nQ: Why do you include non-readable articles and books?\n\nA: The inclusion of the copyright-excluded material allows users to examine a more nearly complete collection of a given author's writings, even if many of the particular items themselves are currently unavailable due to copyright. If necessary, many of these other items can often be accessed and read on other websites or content systems, especially in the case of extent publications. Furthermore, there is a chance that at some future point these publications will be released for reading on this website as well.\n\nQ: The website seems very different than when I previously visited. What's the story?\n\nA: The current Version 2.0 release of UNZ.org incorporates major design changes from the previous version, but nearly all of the same underlying printed content is still available. Given the relatively slight use of the previous links to external videos and webzines, these portions have been removed, thereby streamlining access to the printed materials which constitute the main value of the system. Another major change has been the widespread use of Javascript, rendering most of the pages \"reactive\" as you begin entering information.\n\nQ: How do I find a given author or publication?\n\nA: Most of the main pages of the website contain one or more \"Reactive Clouds,\" with the names of various authors or publications. Javascript functions cause these Clouds to \"react\" and change the displayed information as you begin typing in the entry boxes. For example, as you enter the first few letters of an author's name on the Home page, the Clouds adjust to display only those authors whose names begin with those letters. Similar adjustments occur as you start typing in a particular decade or year, or if you select one of the drop-down settings or other filter. This allows you to quickly focus in on the individuals you are seeking based on your particular criteria.\n\nAt any point, the relative size of the names in a given Cloud indicates the volume of underlying content material associated with that name. Meanwhile, the color indicates what fraction of the content material is readable (for copyright reasons): bright blue indicates mostly readable, dark blue indicates partly readable, and black means mostly unreadable\n\nQ: How do I find a given article or book?\n\nA: The main Articles and Books pages, as well as the Overview tabs for individual authors or publications, display a Listing of articles (or books) towards the bottom of the page. Like the Clouds, these Listings are \"reactive\" and automatically adjust as you being typing in any of the information in the various data entry fields---Title, Author, Publication, or Period, displaying only those items that match your selection.\n\nQ: What about the individual publications?\n\nA: When you reach the pages associated with a given publication, you can examine the contents in a number of different ways, accessed via the different tabs. The default Overview tab gives you the Cloud of authors for that publication plus the Listing of individual articles, with both of these being \"reactive\" as you provide information in the Title, Author, or Period fields.\n\nThere are also several other tabs. The Tree tab displays a dynamic tree allowing the individual time periods, issues, and articles to be opened for greate detail. The Year Contents tab displays the tables of contents for all the issues of a given year, the Issues, Small Covers, and Large Covers tabs display those views of the contents for a given decade, and the All Years tab provides an overview of the entire archive of the periodical. In addition, the drop down field in the control bar may be used to explore the different periods. All these pages allow for convenient browsing of the contents of a given periodical and clicking on any of the individual links accessing more detailed information.\n\nQ: How does Searching work?\n\nA: As mentioned above, much of the exploration of the website contents is normally performed by browsing the various different pages or entering information into the various text fields and having the displayed information automatically adjust. Actual Searches are performed in a parallel manner, by entering the target information into the data fields and then pressing the Search button (or simply hitting Enter). The system then performs a Search across the selected Text, Title, Author, and other information and displays the findings in a new Search Results tab.\n\nSearches may be performed on any of these individual pages, or on the Power Search page, which allows for more detailed Searches across all content material.\nSharing Comment via Twitter\n\nFull HTML link for this page:\nClickable HTML link for this page:\nDecade 1900s Archives\nThe Century Magazine Archives\nTitle Author Period Text\nType?

        "text":"FAQ4 header\n\nFAQ \u2013 Eligibility Update (This means you, Wattpad users!)\n\nHey Swoon Readers!\n\nAs you probably already know, we\u2019ve had several questions about the exclusivity clause in our Terms and Conditions. (We even posted a blog letting you know that we were working on it.) And now, we\u2019re happy to announce that we have an answer! Here\u2019s the official language from our new Terms and Conditions*:\n\n2. All Manuscripts submitted: a) must be original works of book length (no less than 160 typewritten pages or approximately 45,000 words) written in the English language; b) must be written solely by the registered user submitting the work; c) must not violate any right of any third party or be libelous; d) MUST NEVER HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND MUST NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR SALE DURING THE 6 MONTH EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD ON SWOON READS; e) must not be under consideration for sale by any third party (e.g. publisher, retailer, website) during the exclusive period and f) must follow these rules and guidelines.\n\nThe key word here is \u201cSALE.\u201d If you have ever made money from your manuscript\u2014whether through a traditional publisher, Amazon, iBooks, Smashwords, or any other self-publishing method\u2014then, sadly, it is not eligible for Swoon Reads.\n\nHowever, sites like Wattpad, Figment, and Fanfiction.net, among others\u2014where you share your work, but don\u2019t make any money from it\u2014are completely eligible. And, we DO NOT require you to remove your work from these sites. So, if you have a finished YA romance, we\u2019d love for you to submit it. And maybe even tell your readers there to come over and rate it on Swoon Reads!\n\n* (The update is with the developer now, and should be visible on the site soon!)\n\nAuthor spotlight\n\nSwoon Reads Staff\n\nFor more information, check out the \"Meet the Team\" section of our About page (swoonreads.com\/about).\n\nSee More",

        "text":"More of Your inFAQs Answered!\n\nThe best books start here.\n\nMore of Your inFAQs Answered!\n\nquestionsBecause one post wasn\u2019t big enough to answer all the questions you all asked of us a few weeks back.\n\nQ: Can one actually make a living as a writer without acheiving a megalomaniac dream\u2019s of fame?\n\nHahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Good question. But what is \u201ca living\u201d? And where? And how good? And \u2026\u00a0 Really, this is a question better directed to working writers.\n\nQ: When it comes to YA specifically, do you have any guidelines in mind for what you want? (i.e., word count, age range, topic, morality\u2026)\n\nWell, the \u201cmorality\u201d question is one we don\u2019t have any clue as to how to address. We disdain moralistic fiction, disdain moralistic people (even John Gardner in his woefully ill-advised and specious On Moral Fiction, though we kind of sort of adore Grendel and much of his other work), and feel that good writing is, by definition, moral.\n\nAs for word count, age range, topic \u2026 if you know the realm of teen fiction (and please say that you do), you know that there is no set answer for any of these things. Word counts tend to be on the higher end\u2014circa 75,000 words\u2014though there are some teen novels that are so spare and short that they are like long short stories (for example, Angela Johnson\u2019s stunning The First Part Last). Super-long manuscripts are very off-putting and a sign that the author likely hasn\u2019t edited herself.\n\nBut the answer: There are no guidelines and easy answers, sorry. Your story will be as long as it wants to be, about who and what it wants to be about.\n\nQ: I know you\u2019re new as far as a company goes, I couldn\u2019t find anything regarding your actual \u201cfounding\u201d date, but maybe that\u2019s because you\u2019re so new that you want to keep things on the low-low until you get a few years under the belt.\n\nTempted, here, to point to this newfangled wonder of the internet, Google: Just type in \u201cUpstart Crow Literary\u201d and the third, fourth, and fifth entries link to things that give the company start date, more or less. But for the record, we declared ourselves \u201cin business\u201d on 1 August 2009. We\u2019re not hiding anything. Or if we are, are doing an exceptionally poor job of it.\n\nQ: Some writers actually function well when given a specific assignment. As an agent, would you ever consider providing a plot summary and general story guideline for a writer to pursue?\n\nThis is more the job of a packager. We market and work with our authors on their projects, not dictate to them which ones they should be writing. For marching orders, look to book packagers and write-for-hire projects from publishers, not to us.\n\nQ: Some agents don\u2019t respond to a query if they are not interested. Is there ever a reason Upstart Crow would not respond to my query or status check inquiries at all, even with a form rejection? (Assume query was confirmed received.)\n\nThere could be a delay in a response if the person queried has been traveling or direly swamped. But generally, we will get back to you within a month to two months.\n\nQ: How do you feel about prospective writers making contact with you via Facebook, or Plaxo, or Goodreads, or LinkedIn?\n\nWe dislike it mightily. We love to connect up with others who love the things we love (assume I mean children\u2019s books), but such connections are tenuous at best. And the email functions of those programs are not the proper route to use to make a query. Your query isn\u2019t so important (sorry) that it needs to be looked at along with those pictures of our friends\u2019 dogs\/babies\/weekend outings\/what-have-you. Trust that if you query us through an email on Facebook, we will just delete your email. Life is too short.\n\nQ: Would you prefer to receive a manuscript submission before or after a conference both you and the writer are attending?\n\nAfter. There likely won\u2019t be time to read your manuscript before the conference, and then we\u2019ll have that deliciously awkward moment in which you wonder why we haven\u2019t read your 350-page novel in addition to the ten-page critique sample. And we\u2019ll explain that there wasn\u2019t opportunity, and that we felt it was more important to read and critique the paid conference submissions before addressing those submissions.\n\nQ: Is a \u201cno thanks\u201d from one agent a \u201cno thanks\u201d from the whole agency?\n\nYes, thanks.\n\n  1. [\u2026] This post was mentioned on Twitter by Janga724 and Upstart Crow. Upstart Crow said: Now on the Upstart Crow blog: More of Your inFAQs Answered! ( [\u2026]\n\n\n  2. About making a living as a writer and is it possible without being a MAJOR MEGLOMANICAL BESTSELLER.\n\n    Short answer: Yes.\n\n    Long answer: Possible, if you put in a lot of butt-in-chair work, don\u2019t take rejections personally, and have a major Luck Fairy following you around. Oh\u2013and a Time Fairy, too. (And no, I am not sharing mine with anyone.)\n\n\n\n  3. Whoa, Jane Yolen\u2019s hanging out here. She was very nice to my wife (Katherine Applegate) so I am a big fan once removed.\n\n    Re: making a living. Yes, of course it is possible. If you have some talent, (doesn\u2019t take much as my career demonstrates) and are hard-working, and can find the sweet spot between gauging the marketplace and writing what you like.\n\n    Now, I have a question: is there some universe in which book-touring makes economic sense? I\u2019m sitting at JFK on my way to Amsterdam to do a couple of bookstore things and some interviews. In a couple of weeks I do a thing in NYC with Scott Westerfeld. And it\u2019s all fun, but seriously, how does it make economic sense for the publisher?\n\n\n  4. Would like to catch a Luck Fairy of my own. Have built the trap. Now if only I could figure out what to use as bait.\n\n\n  5. I sort of suspected I might get a word from Jane on this topic, and almost addressed it directly to her. Am glad the instinct was right on.\n\n    As for book tours, they are horribly expensive and don\u2019t sell all that many copies. Certainly not enough copies to justify the expense of the tour. (The exception being if your name is Meyer or Rowling or \u2026)\n\n    What they do sometimes accomplish, however, is to get a book or two on the bestseller list. And once there, a book can hang on and its bestseller status become self-perpetuating. People, it seems, buy books simply because they are bestsellers. (\u201cEveryone else is reading this DaVinci Code book, so it must be good.\u201d) So publishers try and game the list and tour authors quickly to as many markets and as many NYT-reporting stores as possible within a week in order to get the book lofted onto the list. And then they cross fingers and pray.\n\n    So it makes some sense, but only a little. Worth pointing out, though: Some weeks book sales are so sluggish that the bottom ranks of the list can be reached with sales of only a few hundred copies. I\u2019ve seen books sit on the list for a month during doldrum periods, and, after that month, the book\u2019s total numbers had not reached as many copies as other titles did weeks when competition was much more fierce. Kind of a drag, as you can imagine.\n\n\n  6. I think it\u2019s really rare to make a living writing books. Wonders like Jane Yolen and Michael Grant do it, but I\u2019d venture that most people with books on the shelves also have day jobs.\n\n    It is possible to make a day job out of writing. I do and make a really respectable living. I have: written for a game company, columns for various entertainment outlets, articles for assorted magazines, marketing copy for assorted products, scripts for short movies and even blog posts for outlets willing to pay (I do not write for free for for-profit companies, though I edit for several nonprofits). I\u2019ve also been flown to places like London for assignments.\n\n    I almost never have to pitch my work. I can\u2019t actually remember the last time I did, though I never take a single assignment for granted. Once you develop relationships with editors and do consistently good work without being jerky or high-maintenance, the editors tend to recommend you to their colleagues, and they take you with them to new companies.\n\n    You do have to be willing to live with a lot uncertainty. If you have a lazy day, you don\u2019t get paid. It\u2019s also not glamorous, like publishing books (oh, hush, you jaded authors\u2014you know everyone envies you).\n\n    But it does pay the bills. When you write 200,000 or so words a year freelance, you don\u2019t fear the keyboard or the blank page. With practice, you also get fast enough at the work that there are windows of time to write those books that you dream of doing. It\u2019s easy to get bogged down, as you would with any day job. I\u2019m really happy with it, and hope to keep on going for the duration.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"Recommendations to readers\n\nOften asked: Kubla khan poem text?\n\nWhat does Kubla Khan poem mean?\n\nIn the first part of the poem, the speaker envisions the landscape surrounding the Mongol ruler and Chinese emperor Kubla Khan\u2019s summer palace, called \u201cXanadu,\u201d describing it as a place of beauty, pleasure, and violence. The poem is one of Coleridge\u2019s most famous, and has been interpreted in many different ways.\n\nHow is Kubla Khan a romantic poem?\n\nKubla khan is a concentration of romantic features. Content and style together evoke an atmosphere of wonder and romance enchantment. Supernaturalism. A basic feature of Coleridge\u2019s poetic art is his ability to render supernatural phenomena with artistry.\n\nWhat type of poem is Kubla Khan?\n\nStyle: Kubla Khan is an intricately structured poem, using a amazing variety of metric and rhythmic devices. Lines 1 to 7 and 37 to 54 are written primarily in iambic tetrameter.\n\nWhat is the main theme of the poem Kubla Khan?\n\nThe interaction between man and nature is a major theme for Coleridge. It\u2019s painted all over \u201cKubla Khan,\u201d as we go from the dome to the river, and then from the gardens to the sea. Sometimes he\u2019s focused on human characters, sometimes on natural forces. In fact, it\u2019s difficult to get away from this theme in this poem.\n\nWhat does Xanadu mean?\n\n: an idyllic, exotic, or luxurious place.\n\nWhat is the purpose of Kubla Khan?\n\nKubla Khan\u201d was first published in a collection called Christabel, Kubla Khan: A Vision, and the Pains of Sleep, and it kicked off the Romantic movement. The Romantics were interested in writing about nature, and they wanted to escape the old, traditional forms of English poetry.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 Quick Answer: The author to her book poem?\n\nIs Kubla Khan a fragmentary poem?\n\nKubla Khan by Coleridge records an opium-induced dream, interrupted by a visitor from Porlock. The poem has been taken to be a beautiful but chaotic fragment where images float about confusedly.\n\nWhat is the pleasure dome in Kubla Khan?\n\nThe speaker describes the \u201cstately pleasure-dome\u201d built in Xanadu according to the decree of Kubla Khan, in the place where Alph, the sacred river, ran \u201cthrough caverns measureless to man \/ Down to a sunless sea.\u201d Walls and towers were raised around \u201ctwice five miles of fertile ground,\u201d filled with beautiful gardens\n\nWhat device dominates the first stanza of Kubla Khan?\n\nColeridge has used personification in the first stanza where he states, \u201cas if this earth in fast thick pant was breathing,\u201d comparing the earth to a breathing human being.\n\nWhy is Kubla Khan called a fragment?\n\nColeridge\u2019s poem Kubla Khan is called a \u2018fragment\u2018 primarily bacause the poet himself chose to call it a fragment of a fuller composition in a state of dream, an account of which was supplied in a prefatory note to the piece on its publication in 1816, some nineteen years after its so-called mysterious genesis.\n\nWhat is the subtitle of the poem Kubla Khan?\n\nThe subtitle of \u201cKubla Kahn\u201d reads \u201cOr a Vision in a Dream.\u201d Dreams may or may not have symbolic meaning, but it is doubtful that anyone intentionally designed symbolic meaning specifically for an individual dream.\n\nIs Xanadu a real place?\n\nNorth of the Great Wall, the Site of Xanadu encompasses the remains of Kublai Khan\u2019s legendary capital city, designed by the Mongol ruler\u2019s Chinese advisor Liu Bingzhdong in 1256. Over a surface area of 25,000 ha, the site was a unique attempt to assimilate the nomadic Mongolian and Han Chinese cultures.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 Often asked: Jack prelutsky poem?\n\nWhat is the tone of Kubla Khan?\n\nTone Examples in Kubla Khan:\n\nJust as the river bursts forth and flows with a powerful energy, the poem\u2019s language contains a similar burst of energy. The stanza begins with a sudden \u201cBut oh!\u201d and includes numerous such exclamatory phrases, as well as long sentences which run across many lines.\n\nWhat are the images present in Kubla Khan?\n\nKubla Khan, present for the eruption, heard a prophecy of war (lines 29\u201330). An indented section presents an image of the pleasure-dome reflected on the water, surrounded by the sound of the geyser above ground and the river underground (lines 31\u201334). A final un-indented couplet describes the dome again (lines 35\u201336).\n\nHow does the poem Kubla Khan end?\n\nThe memory of her song fills him with longing, and he imagines himself singing his own song, using it to create a vision of Xanadu. Toward the end, the poem becomes more personal and mysterious, as the speaker describes past visions he has had. This brings him to a final image of a terrifying figure with flashing eyes.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

        "text":"FAQ: How do I get my book\u00a0published?\n\nThis is my most Frequently Asked Question by far.\n\nSo you\u2019ve written and\/or illustrated your amazing children\u2019s book. Now you want to get it published. You have two options available: traditional publishing and self-publishing \u2026 plus a third option that you should avoid.\n\nBefore we get into these options further, ask yourself what you\u2019re aiming to do with your book:\n\n  \u2022 Do you just want one copy that you can read to your kids?\n  \u2022 Or a couple of copies that you can share with family and friends?\n  \u2022 Or do you\u00a0think your story really has legs, and\u00a0could\u00a0sell\u00a0competitively in\u00a0bookstores?\n\nIf you just want\u00a0one or a couple of copies for personal use, then definitely self-publish \u2013 but go with a website like Blurb. You upload your content, they print copies and post them back to you, and you keep copyright. Easy, done, sorted.\n\nIf you truly believe that your work is of a publishable standard, then I recommend going for traditional mainstream publishing through a publishing company, or if you have the stamina for it, go for self-publishing.\n\nI\u2019ll explain these two options below, plus a third option that you need to avoid.\n\nOption 1: traditional, mainstream publishing\n\nThis is where a publishing company helps you to edit their work, organises printing, marketing and distribution, and pays you an advance and royalties.\n\nThere are two main pathways to mainstream publication.\n\nPlease note that these two pathways are not mutually exclusive, and can be happening at the same time.\n\nPathway A: The Slush Pile\n\nYou send your work to several publishers. Your manuscript is added to the \u2018slush pile\u2019, a collection of every unread manuscript sent by you and everyone else hoping to be published by that company. Don\u2019t be discouraged though; publishers do go through their slush piles bit by bit, and people do actually get their manuscripts discovered this way. Because of the slush pile though it can take many months for a publisher to respond to your submission query (and these days a number of publishers are saying, \u2018if you don\u2019t hear back from us in x number of months, assume that your submission was not accepted\u2019).\n\nSO You wait for responses. You get rejected many times. You keep writing\/illustrating in the meantime, still practicing your craft. Then hopefully, eventually, your work is good enough to be published, and a publisher notices your work and offers to publish it.\n\nPathway B: Professional organisations\n\n2: You join an organisation like the Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI) and\/or the Australian Society of Authors (ASA). You go to events where you get to meet editors and publishers and you book some critique sessions. You get face-to-face feedback, and advice for how to improve your work. You go away and practice some more. Then hopefully, eventually, your work is good enough to be published, and a publisher notices your work and offers to publish it.\n\nThe place of illustrators in mainstream publishing\n\nNote that:\n\n  \u2022 usually, the publisher picks the illustrator.\n  \u2022 most of the time the writer and the illustrator DO NOT collaborate before submitting to a publisher.\n\nI explain the reasons for this in another post called \u2018How do I find an illustrator for my book?\u2019\n\nIf you want to be a children\u2019s book writer, you absolutely must know how the illustrator\u2019s role intertwines with yours. So please do read this post plus the points about illustrators in the next section.\n\nSending submissions to publishers\n\nBefore you send anything to any publisher, visit your local bookshop and have a look at the children\u2019s book section. Make a stack of books that seem like the ones you would like to make. See who publishes them, then check out the publishers\u2019 websites and see if they accept submissions. Note what you would need to submit, and stick to the submission guidelines. Some want hard copies, some only accept digital copies. Some only accept submissions on certain days of the week, and some at certain times of the year. Do your homework and follow the guidelines on each publisher\u2019s website.\n\nIf you\u2019re a writer only, then generally you\u2019ll be asked to send a copy of your manuscript in a certain format, maybe with a cover letter.\n\nIf you\u2019re an illustrator only, then generally you\u2019ll be asked to send a sample or samples of your best work, again with a cover letter.\n\nIf you\u2019re a writer AND an illustrator, then generally you\u2019ll be asked to submit a copy of the manuscript, plus a black and white storyboard and\/or a dummy book, plus two or three samples of what the finished artwork might look like.\n\nIf you\u2019re a writer and you\u2019ve already collaborated with an illustrator:\nthis is not generally how mainstream publishing works. Sometimes you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019ve written a manuscript and you asked your partner\/sibling\/aunty\/friend\/neighbour\/random acquaintance to do some illustrations \u2013 now you\u2019re going to submit all your work together. That\u2019s great. However. This puts you in an unusual position. You may find that a publisher loves the words of the story but not the illustrations.\u00a0OR they love the illustrations but not the words.\u00a0OR\u00a0 they may see potential in both the words and the illustrations, but they think the words need to be edited and the plot needs to be changed a bit, in which case the illustrations might also need to change. So if you\u2019ve collaborated with an illustrator before submitting to a publisher, be prepared for these possibilities.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t complete final illustrations for an entire book before submitting to a publisher. That\u2019s a lot of work to put in, and the publisher might want you to change everything.\n\nCopyright, Advances and Royalties\n\nin traditional publishing arrangements, illustrators retain copyright over their illustrations, and writers retain copyright over their text. They share royalties from the books: 5% of RRP each (the rest goes to booksellers, distributors, printers and publishers). Royalty statements are sent every 6 months; payments are sent at this time as well, providing you\u2019ve made some sales.\n\nThe writer and illustrator also receive an advance payment when they sign the publishing contract \u2013 this is an advance of expected royalties. So if the advance is $1000, then you have to sell enough books to earn that advance back before you can get any more royalties. If you don\u2019t sell enough books to earn the advance back, you still get to keep the full advance. The publishers assume all financial risk and responsibility in this model; they take care of printing, marketing and distribution.\n\nFor advice on publishing contracts, buy the book \u2018Australian Book Contracts\u2018 from the Australian Society of Authors. Also, check out their model publishing agreement template; it\u2019s free for ASA members or $11 for non-members. The ASA also offers a contract assessment service for ASA members or state writers\u2019 centre members.\n\nFor advice on the legal and business issues related to writing, buy the book \u2018Between The Lines\u2018 from the Australian Society of Authors.\n\nFor more information on traditional publishing:\n\nRead the Australian Society of Authors\u2019 advice on how to get published.\n\nCheck out this post I wrote called 6 books to help you make better picture books.\n\nOption 2: self-publishing\n\nSelf-publishing is a whole other ball game. You literally take on the role of the traditional publisher, which means you get complete control over the project but also the entire financial risk. You need to organise your own design and printing, plus your own marketing and distribution to bookstores (online and\/or bricks-and-mortar).\n\nI know of only a few successful children\u2019s book writers and illustrators who self-publish; they all do it full time and approach it like a business, so it\u2019s possible for them to make a decent living from it. They are exceptions to the rule.\n\nThe main services out there for self-publishing are Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), which allows you to create ebooks for Amazon Kindle readers; Amazon Createspace, which is a print-on-demand service; or Ingram Spark, which allows you to make both e-books and print-on-demand books. I\u2019ve never used these myself, but my self-publishing colleagues do; it\u2019s up to you to excerise due diligence and do your research before entering into any commercial agreements with these websites.\n\nThe role of illustrators in self-publishing\n\nYou and the illustrator need to work out whether you want to share the financial risk or whether the illustrator wants to be paid up front.\n\nI cover this in more detail in another post called \u2018How do I find an illustrator for my book?\u2019\n\nIf you\u2019re considering self-publishing your writing and enlisting an illustrator, please do read that post before you get started down that road.\n\nFor more info on self-publishing:\n\nCheck out the Australian Society of Authors\u2019 free advice on self-publishing.\n\nThe ASA also has a paper available called Introduction to Digital Self-Publishing; it\u2019s free for ASA members or $11 for non-members.\n\nAlso check out WritingWA\u2019s free resources for self-publishers.\n\nJoin the facebook group For Love or Money, a support group for independent authors. You can ask questions and find advice. It was set up by author S.K. Quinn, and her book The Indie Author\u2019s Survival Guide is a must-read for anyone heading down the self-publishing road.\n\nOption 3 (which is not an option): vanity publishing\n\nOption 3 is where a company tries to look like a mainstream traditional publisher but is really a glorified and very expensive self-publishing service. In our industry it\u2019s called \u2018vanity publishing\u2019.\n\nVanity publishers are the ones that offer to help you publish your book for a fee \u2013 usually a VERY LARGE and UPFRONT fee. They may want to retain copyright. They may not show you a contract until after you\u2019ve paid. Vanity publishers make their money off the exorbitant fees they charge you and not off the book sales; thus they have little to no interest in marketing ... (truncated)",
