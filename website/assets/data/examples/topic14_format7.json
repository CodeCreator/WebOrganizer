        "text":"Skip to main content\nAuckland Council The Auckland Plan\n\nRenting in Auckland\n\nThe current rental situation\n\nSecure, healthy and affordable housing is fundamental to the health and wellbeing of Aucklanders.\n\nAn adequate supply of quality, affordable housing located near jobs and transport links is a core foundation for strong communities, society and the economy.\n\nAuckland's housing landscape has changed in the last 10 years, and more so in the past five years.\n\nAuckland's housing challenges are escalating. Home ownership rates are decreasing and finding affordable housing is moving beyond the reach of many Aucklanders. This has resulted in lengthy travel times to employment, and increased financial stress, overcrowding and homelessness.\n\nBusiness productivity, competitiveness, economic stability and social cohesion in our communities are all affected by a lack of affordable housing.\n\nWith a growing pool of potential tenants, landlords can be selective about who they rent to and what price they charge. This can disadvantage some potential renters already struggling to find secure accommodation. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nRenting is no longer a short-term step before home ownership. It is becoming a long-term housing solution for many, and the number of lifelong renters is likely to increase.\n\nPhotograph of two storey medium density homes.\n\nLong-term renters increasingly include professionals, higher income earners and families who are unable to transition into home ownership. This will have a significant, and as yet unknown, impact on social and economic outcomes.\n\nTraditionally, financial security in New Zealand has been largely predicated on home ownership.\n\nLifelong renters do not have the same opportunities, through property, to create wealth for their retirement or for the next generation.\n\nA shortage of rental properties that are suitable for people living with physical disabilities, or that can be modified to suit their needs, such as handrails, level access showers and wider doorways, and the often prohibitive cost of private rentals for people on fixed incomes, will result in higher levels of stress for many older Aucklanders. This will place greater pressure on government for support.\n\nCompared to other countries, renters have less protection and security.\u00a0 Renting costs can be high, and the quality of housing is often poor.\n\n\nThe New Zealand Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) is the principal act relating to residential tenancies. It defines the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants of residential properties.\n\nTenancy disputes and mediation are considered by the Tenancy Tribunal, which has legal powers.\n\nThere are two main types of residential tenancy in New Zealand:\n\n  \u2022 a periodic tenancy - this continues until either landlord or tenant gives written notice to end it\n  \u2022 a fixed term tenancy - this lasts for a predefined period of time.\n\nThe Residential Tenancies Amendment Act 2020 came into force in August 2020 and introduced some broad changes affecting both tenants and landlords including, for example, a 12 month limit on rent increases, enabling tenants to make minor changes to a property, and removing \"no cause\" 90-day termination notices.\n\nThe rental market and the associated policy settings\u00a0are\u00a0starting to catch up with changes in Auckland's housing landscape\u00a0but issues of affordability, security of tenure and housing quality remain.\n\n\nHouseholds in Auckland spend more of their income on housing than elsewhere in New Zealand (Stats NZ, 2015, p. 19).\n\nRents are largely unregulated, and high demand means tenants can face regular rent increases with little recourse. The only restriction is that under the RTA rents can only be increased once every\u00a012 months.\n\nHigh housing costs can mean there is little left over to meet basic needs such as food and heating, particularly for lower-income renters.\n\nThe negative trade-offs can include:\n\n  \u2022 frequent moves to find cheaper accommodation\n  \u2022 taking lodgers or overcrowding\n  \u2022 substantial commute times.\n\nRates of overcrowding are estimated to be higher in rental accommodation than in owner-occupied housing. There are frequent reports of multiple people sharing a home that was not designed to accommodate large numbers of occupants, particularly in the southern parts of Auckland - see The housing continuum.\n\nWorsening housing affordability also creates pressure for government finances in the form of increased payments to support low income households meet their housing costs.\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nBy international standards, security of tenure provided by the RTA is weak, short term tenancies are the norm.\n\nGermany, for example, has a well-established rental sector with high levels of legislative protection for tenants, and gives tenants the ability to decorate their home. Indefinite tenancies are the norm and there are few reasons a tenancy can be terminated.\n\nTransience is more common for Auckland renters, affecting their ability to be part of a cohesive community.\n\nAt the time of the 2013 Census, 35 per cent of renters had lived in their house for less than one year, compared with 14 per cent who owned their own home (Goodyear & Fabian, 2014).\n\nSeniors and school age children are particularly affected by transience in the rental market. Transience increases the frequency of school moves which impacts on educational attainment.\n\nThe 2013 Census recorded 44 per cent (more than 120,000) of Auckland's children living in rental housing. Just over a quarter (28 per cent) of 5 to 9 year olds, and 25 per cent of 10 to 14 year olds in Auckland rented households had moved at least once in the past year.\n\nBy contrast, only 12 per cent of 5 to 9 year old children in owner-occupied households, and 10 per cent of 10 to 14 year olds, had moved during the previous year (Goodyear & Fabian, 2014).\n\nFor older Aucklanders, moving to new areas without connections can lead to isolation and security concerns.\n\nHousing quality\n\nPoor and deteriorating housing quality is a pandemic issue in New Zealand, particularly for private rental housing.\n\nTenants are more likely to experience poor quality housing than owner-occupiers.\n\nData from the 2018 Census showed that more than one in five homes were damp some or all of the time, and for renters, dampness was more than twice as common than for home owners. About one in four homes in Auckland was damp, and more than one in five was affected by mould. Rates of dampness and mould were highest in Mangere, Otahuhu and Otara-Papatoetoe.\n\nNew Healthy Home Standards, which aim to make a significant change to the quality of rental homes in New Zealand, became law in 2019. These standards introduce specific and minimum standards for heating, insultation, ventilation, moisture ingress and drainage, and draught stopping in rental properties.\n\nThere is an under-supply of good quality rental stock in Auckland, and it often comes at a premium price.\n\nLower-income renters, facing greater restrictions on their ability to pay, are most affected by quality issues and trade off quality for affordable accommodation.\n\nHousing quality remains a key priority.\n\nResearch such as the BRANZ 2015 Housing Condition Survey (White, et al, 2017) articulates the link between a warm, dry home and positive health outcomes, particularly for children - see Healthy homes for more information.\n\n\nBuckett, N., Jones, M., & Marston, N.

        "text":"How Long Do Labs Live? Ways to Increase Lab Life Expectancy\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. If you click and buy we may make a commission, at no additional charge to you. Please see our disclosure policy for more details.\n\nLabradors are renowned for being one of the most loving breeds around. Often termed, America\u2019s favorite dog \u2014 Labs benefit from good overall health and few serious or dire complications.\n\nPoor nutrition and a lack of exercise can, however, lead to unnecessary health afflictions and a shortened Labrador life expectancy, but we\u2019ll be taking you through a look at these soon.\n\nSo, how long do Labs live? A Labrador retriever\u2019s average life expectancy is between 10 and 14 years.\n\nLet\u2019s delve closer into just how long you can expect your Labrador to live while pointing on basic factors that affect a Lab\u2019s lifespan as well.\n\nhow long do labradors live\n\nFactors That Can Affect How Long Labs Live\n\nOne of the best ways to increase your Lab\u2019s life expectancy is to feed your Labrador a controlled diet.\n\nNo snacks, high-fat food, and low-cost kibble that carries the wrong nutrient profile. Make sure your dog food is specially formulated for medium-large sized dogs, and opt for human-quality meat- fish and poultry.\n\nComplex carbohydrates like brown rice and sweet potato are the ideal support for a well-rounded diet, but depending on your approach, you may decide to go with a scientifically formulated food instead. Both methods work as long as you cover all nutrient, protein, fat, and mineral requirements.\n\nMost healthy diet recommendations for a Labrador are set at 50% animal protein, 30% complex carbs, and the final 20% is made up of fresh fruit and vegetables. Add a healthy source of omega 3\u2019s like tuna or salmon regularly, and you\u2019ve got a nutritious meal plan.\n\nRead more about the Labrador diet and breed-specific recommendations in our guide: The Best Dog Foods for Labs.\n\nExercise Affects a Lab\u2019s Life Expectancy\n\nExercise is critical to the good health of your dog. Labrador retrievers are high-energy animals that need a good amount of high-intensity exercise to keep their bodies in tip-top shape. The general time frame of exercise for a normal, healthy adult Labrador is roughly one hour of exercise per day. This can be anything that\u2019s a bit of a higher pace than walking.\n\nWalks should always be around 90-minutes long, while energetic exercise like fetch or jogging is best over the course of 45 minutes, with a 15-minute gentle cooldown. The more energetic your Labrador Retriever, the more exercise they will need.\n\nlabrador health problems\n\nHealth Conditions That Can Affect the Labrador Lifespan\n\nIf a Lab is fed an unhealthy diet over a prolonged period, certain issues can arise. This, in combination with a lack of exercise, may spur a range of problems in this otherwise extremely healthy breed.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the health conditions to be aware of, so that you can take preventative steps.\n\n1. Canine Hip Dysplasia\n\nCanine hip dysplasia classifies the condition whereby a dog develops a malformation of the coxo-femoral joint. This can result from either genetic or environmental causes.\n\nWhen the ball no longer fits snugly into the hip socket, dysplasia has occurred. It is vital to control the diet of these hungry dogs. With a feverous appetite, it is easy to allow them to overconsume.\n\nMaintaining a consistently high body mass index stresses the joints, which heightens the risk of dysplasia. There\u2019s no cure for this condition, but it won\u2019t impact the lifespan of your Labrador Retriever as long as your dog\u2019s quality of life doesn\u2019t suffer. A healthy diet and avoiding exercises that put pressure on the injury is best.\n\n2. Osteochondritis Dissecans\n\nOsteochondritis dissecans refers to the condition occurring when ossification alters the growth of bone and cartilage. This plagues large and giant breeds more often, but it is a threat for Labrador retrievers as well.\n\nAs fragments of cartilage begin to fragment and grow weak, cartilage flaps from within your dog\u2019s joints. This causes them to lift off the bone resulting in widespread inflammation. If left untreated, lameness will occur.\n\nThe first signs of osteochondritis dissecans include limping, trouble rising, reduced body mass, swelling joints, depression, and decreased physical exercise. This disease normally arises from overfeeding and excessive weight gain, which places immense pressure on the joints, but it can occasionally be from hereditary causes as well.\n\nRELATED: What is the Best Dog Food for Joint Health?\n\n3. Patellar Luxation\n\nPatellar luxation refers to the dislocation of the kneecap from its groove in the femur. This condition rarely causes pain and is generally caused by either direct trauma or a genetic malformation. When genetics are at the root of the dislocation, the first signs start occurring roughly four months after birth.\n\nKneecap dislocation is not normally a weight-related problem. Labrador retrievers are three times more likely to have patellar luxation as an abnormality. Surgery is seldom needed, and the issue rarely impairs a dog\u2019s quality of life nor longevity.\n\nWith a healthy diet and supplemental vitamins like ascorbic acid, mixed tocopherols, and vitamins B1 and B6, Labs afflicted will live a long, happy life.\n\nlabrador lifespan\n\nNeutering and Spaying\n\nOne way to lower your canine\u2019s risk of tumors and cancers, as well as numerous diseases is to consider neutering or spaying. Neutering or spaying typically increases the lifespan of any dog it\u2019s done to.\n\nRemoving the testicles and removing the female\u2019s uterus and ovaries eliminate testicular and uterine tumors, growths, infections, diseases, and cancers. It also lowers the chance of hernias occurring.\n\nRemember that spaying also stops a female Lab from having to undergo the stress of conceiving. Once \u2018fixed,\u2019 a dog is far less likely to go wandering, so if this was ever an issue, it no longer would be after the procedure.\n\nKeep in mind that opinions regarding neutering and spaying are highly contested. Certain studies show that neutering or spaying can increase the risk of leukemia and lymphoma. Be sure to research the genetics of your own dog and the procedure itself.\n\nLab Shedding Heavily\n\nLife Expectancy of Labrador Retrievers: Does Color Matter?\n\nUntil recently, science accepted that all types of Labs (Black, Yellow, and Chocolate) live to roughly the same age. Recently studies by Canine Genetics and Epidemiology contradict this proving that Chocolate Labrador genetics are indeed different.\n\nMost Chocolate labs bred in the UK are found to live lives that are 10% shorter than non-chocolate breeds. If you treat your dog well and take good care of its health and fitness, you can expect a long life.\n\nThe oldest Lab in the world lived to the age of 27 years and three months. Adjutant (a black Labrador Retriever) was born in 1936 and died in 1963, making him the 7th oldest dog ever across all breeds. This shows us that averages are very hard to rely on. Rather, care for your Lab as well as you can, always expecting the best, longest life.\n\nYou May Also Like\u2026\n\n5 Best Dog Beds for Labs\n\nDo Labs Shed?

        "text":"Sorting out the cedars\n\nWestern Red Cedar\n\nTo some woodworkers, cedar ranks high as the wood of choice for building decks. Others rely on it for lining closets or cigar humidors. How can one wood be so versatile? It's because multiple varieties exist with different properties and uses. We'll slice through the five most common species so you can choose the cedar that best suits your project.\n\nWestern Red Cedar\n\nThis member of the cypress family grows from southern Alaska through northern California and in the Rocky Mountains. The trees may grow 200' tall with trunk diameters of 10'.\n\nWestern red cedar (Thuja plicata) reigns supreme for the production of decking, siding, shingles, and outdoor structures because of its natural decay resistance, ability to repel water, and abundance. Low density and light weight make it easy to cut and shape using hand or power tools. But contact with the sawdust can cause rashes and respiratory problems.\n\nThe heartwood of this species bears a consistent reddish-brown tone, sometimes tinged with pink. Knots prove prevalent in lower grades, though \"clear\" grades are available. Most of its thin white sapwood (which has little decay resistance) gets milled away during lumber processing.\n\nSources: Find knotty grades in dimensional sizes at home centers and lumber yards; clear grades at hardwood dealers.\n\nPrice: $1 to $3 per linear foot in dimensional sizes. $4 to $6 per board foot (clear 4\/4 S2S stock).\n\nYellowish board\nWestern Red Cedar\n\nNorthern White Cedar\n\nThis cedar (Thuja occidentalis) is sometimes called \"arbor vitae\" (tree of life). It grows in southeastern Canada and the northeastern quarter of the U.S., south to Tennessee and west into Iowa. Trees grow 50' tall with 2'-diameter trunks.\n\nNorthern white cedar resists decay and insect infestation like its western red cousin, making it similarly suitable for outdoor projects, such as shingles, posts, and decking. Canoe builders use the wood to fashion their boats.\n\nThe northern variety proves less dense than western red cedar, contributing to good workability with power and hand tools. The wood tends to be brittle, tearing out without sharp cutters and backer boards. And some woodworkers report rash and respiratory problems.\n\nA thin band of creamy white sapwood surrounds the wood's light brown heartwood, with knots often present.\n\nSources: Tough to locate outside its range; within the range, check lumber dealers and local sawmills.\n\nPrice: $1.75 per board foot (4\/4 S2S stock).\n\nBoard with a strip of sap in it\nNorthern White Cedar\n\nEastern Red (Aromatic) Cedar\n\nThis tree (Juniperus virginiana) also belongs to the cypress family. It grows throughout the eastern United States, usually to heights of just 20' to 40', though some trees reach 100' or taller.\n\nMost people refer to this wood as \"aromatic cedar\" because of its pungent natural oils, and use it to line closets and hope chests to ward off insects. Little scientific data exists, however, to show the wood repels bugs effectively.\n\nIt works easily with hand and power tools, but use a respirator and gloves if you experience rash and respiratory problems. Nonetheless, pencil makers prefer the wood, as do producers of souvenir wooden novelties.\n\nEastern red cedar heartwood bears pinkish-red tones with an occasional purplish tinge and deep reddish-brown streaks. The sapwood is almost white, and knots are often present throughout the wood.\n\nChoose polyurethane or lacquer for the best finishing results. In confined spaces, the resins in eastern red cedar can cause finishing problems, as they inhibit proper hardening of oil finishes.\n\nSources: Seek out hardwood dealers for lumber, home centers for closet lining.\n\nPrice: $3.50 per board foot (4\/4, S2S stock).\n\nBoard with a big knot hole in it\nEastern Red (Aromatic) Cedar\n\nYellow Cedar\n\nAlso known as Alaska cedar, this tree (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) grows in the Pacific Northwest, from Alaska through British Columbia and into Oregon. The wood ranks as hard and dense, with tight rings indicative of its slow growth. Even so the wood remains lightweight, giving it an impressive strength-to-weight ratio.\n\nNative Americans used yellow cedar to produce ultralight, durable canoe paddles and many other useful items. Today, makers of stringed musical instruments prize the wood because of its excellent sound quality. Boatbuilders use it for decks, railings, and interior paneling.\n\nYellow cedar ranges in color from creamy white to sulfur yellow, with occasional dark streaks. The wood machines beautifully, glues and stains well, and develops a satiny sheen.\n\nSources: Luthier's supply companies, specialty hardwood dealers.\n\nPrice: $6.50 to $7 per board foot (4\/4 S2S stock). Prices for instrument-grade wood run much higher.\n\nCedar with smug on the end of board\nYellow Cedar\n\nSpanish Cedar\n\nThe sole hardwood and only import of this group, Spanish cedar (Cedrela oderata) grows natively in Central and South America, and has been planted in Florida. This relative of mahoganies can grow to 100' tall.\n\nWithin its range, Spanish cedar gets used for everything from furniture to windows and cabinetry. Builders of lightweight racing boats fashion the wood into sleekly curved hulls. Though harder to obtain in the United States and Europe, Spanish cedar has become the wood of choice for lining cigar humidors because of its aromatic oils and moisture resistance.\n\nThe lightweight wood bears straight grain and proves easy to machine and finish. Spanish cedar heartwood has a pinkish to reddish-brown tone that darkens over time.\n\nSources: Go to hardwood dealers for boards, and woodworking catalogs for small stock.\n\nPrice: $7 per board foot (4\/4, S2S stock).\n\nDark cedar\nSpanish Cedar\n\nMore resources\n\n  \u2022 Find information about 100+ wood species in our online wood reference.\n  \u2022 Aromatic Cedar: Myth or Mothbuster,\n\n\n  \u2022 Cedrus libani, the cedar of the Bible:\n  \u2022 Build a mahogany and aromatic cedar blanket chest. $\n\nCedar chest\n\n  \u2022 Construct a made-in-the-shade cedar tree bench for your backyard. $\n\nBench around tree\n\n$=Download this article for a small fee.\n\n\n\nTip of the Day\n\nSnip-don\u2019t-sling nail-trimming trick\n\n\nHave you ever trimmed off a nailhead (to make a pivot for a circle-cutting jig, for instance) using... read more",

        "text":"What is the significance of a Morgan silver dollar mintage?\n\n\nQuick Answer\n\nMorgan silver dollars were minted from 1878 to 1904 and briefly in 1921, when the U.S. government discontinued production of Morgan silver dollars permanently. The dollar coins were first created as a result of the discovery of a large silver mine near Carson City, Nev., that made silver an abundant metal. The Morgan silver dollars are 90 percent silver.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nFull Answer\n\nSilver dollars had fallen out of favor for the five years prior to the Morgan silver dollar because they were heavy and made up only a fraction of circulating coins. The Mint Act of 1878 authorized a new silver dollar to be minted, creating the Morgan. At the same time, Congress passed a bill requiring the treasury to purchase large amounts of silver for the production of dollar coins. Silver prices fell despite the interest in the metal because it was still not widely used in industry.\n\nBy 1893 there was an overabundance of silver dollars but not enough gold. The treasury's gold had been largely paid out to mine owners to purchase the silver, not leaving much left to pay notes and other financial obligations payable solely in gold. This put the U.S. government in a precarious situation and no more silver was purchased.\n\nThe Morgan dollars were minted until the supply of silver ran out in 1904. The Morgan dollar was briefly minted in 1921 as a counterbalance to an act that had required silver dollars to be melted down to make currency for India, which was then a British colony.\n\nLearn more about Coins & Currency\n\nRelated Questions",

Sadly , the rain forests are disappearing and some species of Macaw are on the endangered list. Macaws have been kept as pets in the U.S. as far back as 1100 A.D. by the Pueblo Indians.\n\nWhat does the Macaw look like?\n\nThe Macaw is a large, very colorful bird. Size varies according to the species - Blue Gold, Greenwing, Military, Red Fronted, Scarlet and Hyacinth, the largest of Macaws. They can be anywhere from 13-40 inches long. for discussion here we will refer to the Blue gold and Scarlet Macaws as they are most popular as pets.\n\nWhat is the personality of the Macaw?\n\nDeciding on a Macaw as a pet means quite a commitment as it is a long-lived bird. Cost is another consideration as they can be expensive. They can be taught to talk and will have an extensive vocabulary. They are affectionate birds, but they require a great deal of time with training and socialization. With their large beaks, they can cause serious damage if not properly trained.\n\nHow do I care for and feed the Macaw?\n\nA very tall, large cage is essential. Also a perch outside the cage for them to sit on. Placing the cage in a corner in a room where the family spends a good deal of time helps the Macaw feel more secure. The Macaw enjoys a diet of pellets, fresh fruits and vegetables and small amounts of seeds and nuts. Never feed a bird avocados as they are toxic to them.",
