It's handy for around town, trips to the builder supply store, and the antique shop. It's my work car, and has been reliable so far. All these are offset however by the poor performance and abominable gas mileage: about 13 mpg all the time. My previous car was a full-sized sedan that got 10. Some improvement. The transmission has to work hard all the time and the truck barely keeps up with Bay Area traffic. I had wanted the four-cylinder, 5-speed model, but let myself get flimflammed into this model. It's my fault, but I would never buy this truck, or shop at that dealership again.\n\nBest Features\n\nInterior room, seats. Ride is generally good, for a truck.\n\nWorst Features\n\nThe 3.0 litre engine is a pushrod unit from the sixties. How about a MODERN engine. Also, area behind rear seats is very hard to access.\nRecommend (0) (0)\n\nAre you the author of this review?\n\nUpdate Your Review\nReport it\nComments (0) Post a Comment\nPost a Comment\n\nYou must be signed in to post a comment.\n\n\nSelect a different vehicle \u00a0\nRecently Viewed\nThere are no recently viewed vehicles to display\n\nWrite Consumer Reviews\n\nWrite Consumer Reviews\n\nWrite a review and rate your own car.",

        "text":"1997 BMW 3 Series 318i Touring 1.8 petrol from Australia and New Zealand\n\n\nFabulous car, shocking dealers\n\n\nOnly minor, teething problems have gone wrong so far and will be covered under warranty when the car goes in for its next service:\n\nFuel door does not lock with the central locking (minor wiring problem).\n\nNoise coming from a cooling fan.\n\nAnnoying rattle coming from the luggage cover.\n\nSpeakers occasionally cut out, though this seems to have disappeared.\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nThis car drives superbly. What makes it such a joy to use is the refinement that has gone into all the controls - the brakes, the gear change and especially the steering are fabulous.\n\nHaving almost bought an Audi A4, and been tempted by a Saab 9-3, I was won over by the feel of the rear wheel drive BMW.\n\nThe handling is so fluent and un-fussed, while it is also comfortable to drive on long trips.\n\nThe engine sounds sweet and refined and is light on fuel. The A4s engine was, to me, a bit harsh and noisy in comparison. While the 1.8 is by no means a power-house, its power is entirely adequate for me, especially once on the open road.\n\nThe Touring model (estate) has the versatility my lifestyle demands and is certainly better looking and turns more heads than the rather common sedan, especially in 'Boston Green' which looks fabulous.\n\nHowever, while the car is superb, the buying experience could not have been worse. Shelly Motors BMW, Wellington, were rude, pushy, arrogant and were uninterested in being helpful and making a customer feel valued. At one point, they engaged in a heated argument with us - raised voices and all - when I challenged their lack of care for their customers. Never have I been so livid in leaving a showroom. Unfortunately the car was precisely what I was after and this particular model is as rare as hens teeth in New Zealand. If only this car was on sale at either the Saab or Audi dealer, which were extremely helpful and were a pleasure to deal with.\n\nI would be interested if anyone else has found BMW agents to be the most unpleasant of all car dealers. They are arrogance personified.\n\nWould you buy another car from this manufacturer? Yes\n\nReview Date: 10th February, 2002\n\n22nd Jun 2005, 01:26\n\nHi, I have recently purchsed the same car in Black.\n\nI have to say that the Dealer in Dunedin - Cookies was really helpful.\n\nI can't fault them.\n\nThey corrected all the small glitches I needed repairing like re-gassing tailgate struts, thermostat check replacement pollen filter etc.\n\nThey even supplied the 2 engine belts for me at no cost.\n\n\n20th Apr 2010, 06:49\n\nI know someone who would tell you Peugeot are just as bad :-(\n\n1997 BMW 3 Series 328i 2.8 from UK and Ireland\n\n\nExpensive to run with many faults\n\n\nRear screen needed replacing due to leak.\n\nRear door central locking motor failed.\n\nClimate control broke due to a temperate sensor in the dashboard.\n\nGearbox and clutch needed replacing due to rattle.\n\nPaint on bonnet peeling away.\n\nBoth rear shock absorber replaced.\n\nNew discs and pads required all round.\n\nBottom ball joint worn.\n\nOne rear fog lamp doesn't work (not a bulb problem).\n\nA noise comes from the radio cassette when playing tapes.\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nI like the car due to the performance and quiet and comfortable ride.\n\nI have been disappointed by the high running costs.\n\nThe car as needed a visit to the dealer quite often.\n\nIt has needed servicing (based on the service indicator) every 7000 miles which is nearly twice a year for me.\n\nIncluding the visits to the dealer for gearbox and clutch problems, this is quite a lot for such a reliable car!\n\nWould you buy another car from this manufacturer? Don't Know\n\nReview Date: 11th January, 2002\n\n24th Jan 2002, 16:47\n\nCould do with a little more information. The service interval is regulated not just by the mileage, but how hard you drive the car. Disks and pads all-round is not exceptional (I would expect to replace them from time to time).\n\nWhen you say expensive to run, what do you mean? Fuel consumption, insurance, consumables etc.\n\nDid you purchase a \"good one\" in the first place?\n\nI am currently in the process of purchasing a 328i Convertible, I will add my review when I have some data\/opinion.\n\n14th Nov 2009, 03:30\n\nI suffered all and more of these faults on a year 2000 728i a few years ago; window rubbers rotted, electric motors failed, climate control never worked, ABS control module went (\u00a31200 to replace!) various trim fell off, radio amp broke (\u00a3800 to replace!), wiring fault in the lamp control module causing dull taillights... many more faults but can't think right now... VERY overrated cars, just like all german stuff.",

        "text":"\n\nI had uncharitably considered the car a wallow-mobile, a rolling land yacht, an automobile designed more for passengers than drivers.\n\nBut that was before a second transplant surgery relegated me to the role of passenger for a month.\n\nDuring my first week of recovery, a Toyota Highlander wagon\/sport-utility vehicle was available. It was a wonderfully crafted machine, a less expensive version of the mechanically and structurally identical Lexus RX300.\n\nThe Highlander was loaded with comfort-giving options, too, including heated seats. But, though based on a car platform, it rides higher than most traditional large sedans. That made getting in and out of the vehicle, with two dozen staples in my abdomen, a painful chore. I began to dread having to go anywhere in the Highlander.\n\nThe Park Avenue Ultra arrived a week later. It proved to be a blessing, the kindest thing General Motors Corp. ever did for the surgically impaired. Entering and exiting the Park Avenue Ultra was easy, front seat or equally comfortable back. I simply slid in and out. Spring-loaded grips, attached to the roof above the outboard sides of the front and rear seats, assisted ingress and egress.\n\nMy chauffeur on these outings, mostly to and from the hospital for post-surgical follow-ups, was my wife, Mary Anne. Lately, she tends to feel hot in even the coldest weather, which is a problem for me. I start shivering whenever the temperature drops below 69 degrees.\n\nBut the Park Avenue Ultra offered a solution: individual temperature controls for the driver and the front-seat passenger. In the past, I had considered this feature a technological bauble, a silly thing designed to milk consumers for more money.\n\nBut that was when my wife was the front-seat passenger and I was the driver. Little did I know that she would secretly lower the temperature on her side of similarly equipped test cars whenever I raised the temperature on my side to 75 degrees. I used to wonder why she didn't complain. Now I know why.\n\nThere were other discovered pleasures in the Park Avenue Ultra. The seats, also equipped with automatic heating, were as comfortable as those found in substantially more expensive cars, including the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7-Series sedans.\n\nThe ride was soft. But that was perfectly fine with me. When you're hurting, you don't want to feel every bump in the road, and I felt very little in the Park Avenue Ultra.\n\nHandling was not as crisp as found in some European sedans and any number of sports cars. But I didn't give a pahooty about that. What I wanted was maximum comfort, and that is what the Park Avenue Ultra gave. Assuming that convalescence continues going as well as its going, I'll be back behind the wheel soon, and t here will be time and opportunity enough for speed and curves.",

        "text":"Royal Enfield Classic 500 : Expert Review\n\nPublished On Jun 15, 2015 By Akshit Juneja for Royal Enfield Classic 500\n\nThe pros: known for classy old charm and powerful performance, very immediate and precise throttle experience, smooth riding.\n\nThe cons: The absence of a fuel gauge and misleading reserve light does confuse the rider, downshifting is quite hard and lots of vibrations.\n\nThe crux: Now, the RE comes with modern components and technology, might have taken a long leap with the Classic 500, but they still have a long way to go.\n\n\nBullet- a generic name given to every Royal Enfield motorcycle, no matter what their actual name would be, has always been associated with a heroic image bundled with reliability and barn-door technological backwardness. But the one you see in these pictures isn\u2019t a Bullet. Neither by name and nor by the performance and riding ability it offers.\n\nWhen this \u2018Classic\u2019 iteration was introduced into the Indian market few years back, everyone was sceptical about the acceptance of this new-age Royal Enfield. The reasons were very obvious- conventional big bore loud thump was missing, fuel injection came into play and the right-side gear-shifter, for which the Bullets were actually known for years, was also been ditched.\n\nBut the Eicher-owned brand understood the progression of modern technologies and brought a complete change to the engine. Modern emission laws, in the domestic as well as in the main export markets, made it increasingly difficult for the venerable old-school engine to stay legal. Therefore an all-new engine featuring fuel injection, five-speed gearbox with a modern change pattern and wet multi-plate clutch came into existence. And with that, Classic range was also born.\n\n\nThe automobile sector might be rushing towards modern & aerodynamic designs, but staying true to its name \u2018Classic\u2019 retains its typical old-world charm and surely takes your heart away. At one glance the Classic 500 reminds you of a British classic coming directly from that era.\n\nThe right proportion of paint and chrome on that bulky and curvy body, that bazooka exhaust pipe, single sprung seat and negligible decals make this the best-looking Bullet till date.\n\nThe halogen powered headlamp inclusive of a chrome lip and set of trademark pilot lamps on either side, mighty fuel tank with the perfectly placed knee rests and chrome mirrors and indicators combine well together to create a true retro machine. The tan color seen in these images looks fantastic and seen not that often on our roads.\n\n\nComfortable! As much you expect from your motorcycle. The riding triangle is meant to cruise, with the best possible ease. and long journeys would never be an issue on this motorcycle. I quite liked the retro aura that the Classic brings upon in maximum aspects.\n\nKeeping upbeat with all the modern machines in terms of quality, the instrument cluster with a large circular speedometer dominating the proceedings completes the feel of riding a British classic. The absence of a fuel gauge and misleading reserve light does confuse the rider though.\n\nThe feel of clutch has also improved a lot when compared to earlier RE models. Its light and well in reach and left me very impressed.\n\nEngine & Performance:\n\nWith a fuel injection and an integrated gearbox on-board, the single-cylinder, twin-spark 499cc engine pumps out 27.2bhp of raw power along with 41.2 Nm of peak torque. The engine\u2019s character has been retained and the retro feel with its long-stroke cylinder and a heavy flywheel to keep it thumping along smoothly, even at the low revvs.\n\nThrottle response is the best I\u2019ve ever experienced on a Royal Enfield- very immediate and precise. Yes, the 200kg of metal is not suitable for too much to expect, but on the whole- no complains and was happy with it.\n\nThe engine is mated to a five-speed constant-mesh gearbox, whose ratios are perfect for city riding. However, the quality of gear-shift is still an issue like the earlier Royal Enfields. They are not precise and slick, it actually should be. It\u2019s a bit clunky and sticky when you need to swiftly step up or down in heavy traffic.\n\nRide & Handling :\n\nThe ride of the Classic is smooth, and its engine feels at home ridden between 80-90kmph, while the scenario starts to feel strained soon thereafter. Like any other Royal Enfield, the 500 is a heavy, solid feeling and stable bike ridden in a straight line, and always feels planted. Downshifting is painful, literally, and can cause a sprain in back due to killing vibrations.\n\nThe motorcycle uses conventional telescopic fork front suspension and dual 5-step adjustable gas-charged shock absorbers at the rear, which manages the patchy Indian roads quite well. The reasonably well- 90\/90 front and 110\/90 rear 18-inch MRF Zappers compliments well to the overall ride.\n\nBraking- an aspect which needs some serious improvement. The motorcycle I tested was less than 1000km run and already the brakes were lousy. The 280mm front disc is considerably good but the rear as well the overall affect was not really enough for stopping such a heavy motorcycle.\n\n\nThe Classic 500 possesses the feel, the character and the road presence that will make you fall in love with it. As close to a classic British motorcycle as it\u2019s possible to get, this RE comes with modern components and technology, yet with the sound, feel and charm of a classic. However, after riding it for a couple of hundred kilometres, I can conclude that the Royal Enfield might have taken a long leap with the Classic 500, but they still have a long way to go.\n\n*Ex-showroom Price in Delhi\n\nLatest Bikes\n\n*Ex-showroom price in Delhi\n\nUpcoming Bikes\n\n*Estimated price in Delhi\n\nBest Bikes\n\n*Ex-showroom price in Delhi\nWhich is your city ?",

I bought it with 22 inch wheels on it. I took them off and put factory on it. I have drove in mud, snow, sleet and the thing still runs like a PRO. I did tear up the differential and I had to replace the U-Joints twice. I have a few leaks and the brakes stink. The body needs paint. But other then that, the Jeep is strong tough and will pull anything. I would buy two or three more if I had the money. But I love my Jeep Cherokee sport, there is no Jeep out there like it. They should keep making Jeep Sports.\n\nBest Features\n\nThe body is my favorite feature. I love how it is shaped square.\n\nWorst Features\n\nWow! the 1995 Jeep Cherokee Sport didn't have cup holders anywhere. I had to get one made for it. The drivetrain needs more improvements U-Joints, wheel bearing go out, leaf springs needs work.\nRecommend (1) (0)\n\nAre you the author of this review?\n\nUpdate Your Review\nReport it\nComments (0) Post a Comment\nPost a Comment\n\nYou must be signed in to post a comment.\n\n\nSelect a different vehicle \u00a0\nRecently Viewed\nThere are no recently viewed vehicles to display\n\nWrite Consumer Reviews\n\nWrite Consumer Reviews\n\nWrite a review and rate your own car.",

When the green light appeared, I accelerated at a speed of 15 when out of no where I heard a boom sound coming from the engine. This seem very abnormal to me since I had barely purchase my car 4 months ago. I took my car to the Honda dealer to see what was going on with my car. After waiting a few hours, the mechanic told me there were many things wrong with the car. The boom sound was made by the breakage of the wishbone that holds the lower engine and besides that it needed 2 tires, alignment, cabinfilter, brake flush, P\/S rack. I honestly don't think it is fair to me that I bought a 2009 car for it to have this many problems. When I bought my car the man from auto plaza told me that I wouldn't be having any problems with my car for a long time and then I find out all of this parts wrong with my car. After this incident, I went to talk to the man from auto plaza and he told me that when they had purchase the car they didn't inspect it before putting it on sale.this action seems to me very irresponsible to not have inspected the car before putting it on sale.

However, I quickly found out that KWs are so much more than just a solution for a lower stance on your vehicle. I drove my F10 long enough on stock suspension, too long on H&R sport springs, and gave myself enough time to experience the KWs to be able to share my first impressions and lasting impressions on them.\n\nStock F10 Suspension ( Non DHP\/Adaptive drive)\n\nMost, if not all of us know what the stock suspension on the F10 feels like, unless you modified your suspension on day 1. The feeling of the stock suspension on the F10 is like a floaty boat ride which makes you feel alienated from the road. Tight cornering on my F10 with stock suspension was not pleasant, as the body roll was enough to throw my wife and I from side to side like we were doing the chicken dance. The floatiness and loose feel of the car, combined with the altitude at which my F10 stood consequently led me to swap out stock springs for H&R sport springs in hope of improved ride quality.\n\nH&R Springs\n\nH&R sport springs definitely helped make the F10 feel more planted, and cosmetically improved the F10\u2019s look by lowering it a little over an inch overall. However, I was not completely satisfied with the springs for although the floatiness improved, it still remained, especially on the freeway and at higher speeds. The ride on the H&R springs was still jumpy and took a few seconds to settle back down after going through a dip . Cornering on H&R springs was definitely better than stock, although body roll still lingered enough to be very noticeable and uncomfortable when spirited driving took place. The height drop was acceptable from the H&Rs considering the price, and the ride was ok aside from the floatiness at high speeds and the lag in stabilization after a significant dip. H&Rs still left me expecting more from my BMW F10, which led me to decide on making the best investment I\u2019ve made on my F10 as of yet. KW Coilovers.\n\nKW Coilovers V3\n\nThe day I drove back to San Diego from Trinity Autosport after installing the KW V3\u2019s on my F10, I simply felt like I was driving a completely different vehicle (from a ride quality stand point). My car felt planted to the ground and feedback from the road was drastically improved. Taking turns at 80mph felt like turning at 25mph, total comfortably, completely stable, and connected to the road. Going over dips where the springs compress and decompress, the car stabilized itself in a matter of milliseconds compared to H&R springs and stock where you are kept floating up and down until stable. Nose diving when braking quickly and hard was gone, the car comes to complete clean stops without jerking you or your passengers forward.\n\nI would mention any downsides to the KWs, but IMO, there aren\u2019t any.\n\nI am currently dialed in at factory out of the box settings and have not played with the dampening or compression. I am very satisfied with the feel of the car and enjoy every moment driving the F10. Everything I tried to improve with H&R springs and couldn\u2019t attain has now been completed with KW coilovers, which are definitely worth every penny.\n\nKW coilovers are not for the faint of heart and if you don\u2019t really care about performance, stability and complete versatility of the ride and height of your vehicle, than I would say springs or stock suspension would do you just fine.\n\nHowever, If your\u2019e looking for an aggressive suspension that TRULY performs, drastically improves the quality of your ride, totally enhances the look of your F10, and can be adjusted to the height of your liking, then KW coilovers were made just for you.\n\nHere's a video I made showing off a few F10's on KW V3's\n\nStock Suspension Pictures\n\nH&R Springs Pictures\n\nKW Coilovers V3 Install @ Trinity Autosport (Thanks Joe and Nerwyll)\n\nKW V3 Suspension Pictures\n\nLast edited by luigimaster24; 06-10-2011 at 06:58 PM.",
