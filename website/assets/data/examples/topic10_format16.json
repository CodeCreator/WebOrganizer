        "text":"Home RICE ( ALL PRODUCTS WITH PICS ) Hunza Valley (Parboiled)\n\nHunza Valley - Parboiled (Organic)\n\nHunza Valley rice is famous for its full flavor, richness and nutrition. Rice from Hunza are short grain and contain many minerals, including all those known to be essential for good health and vitality. Unlike other rice, Hunza Rice are not processed with chemicals and contains no preservative or additives.\n\nAfter cooking, the grains are soft and cling together. Because of these properties, the short grain Hunza Valley rice is especially suitable in recipes where a creamy texture is desired, such as puddings, rice balls, croquettes, paella and risotto.\n\nAbout Hunza Valley:\nThe Hunza Valley (Urdu: \u06c1\u0646\u0632\u06c1) is a mountainous valley in Gilgit in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The Hunza valley is situated to the north of the Hunza River, at an elevation of around 2,500 metres (8,200 ft). The territory of Hunza is about 7,900 square kilometres (3,100 sq mi). Several high peaks rise above 6,000 metres (20,000 ft) in the surroundings of Hunza valley. The valley provides spectacular views of some of the most beautiful and magnificent mountains of the world which include Rakaposhi 7,788 metres (25,551 ft)7,788 m (25,551 ft), Ultar Sar 7,388 metres (24,239 ft)Bojahagur Duanasir II 7,329 metres (24,045 ft), Ghenta Peak 7,090 metres (23,261 ft), Hunza Peak 6,270 metres (20,571 ft), Darmyani Peak 6,090 metres (19,980 ft), and Bublimating (Ladyfinger Peak) 6,000 metres (19,685 ft).\n\nAs much as the valley is famous for its beauty, the people of Hunza are noted for their friendliness and hospitality. The local languages spoken are Burushaski, Wakhi and Shina, many people understand Urdu. The literacy rate of the Hunza valley is believed to be more than 90%. In the early 70s, National Geographic ran an extensive series of articles investigating claims of long-lived people around the world. Without focusing too much on documented maximum age, the truly extraordinary fact is that all reports from the Hunza mention that the elderly population is fit, full of vitality and virtually free from disease, which is also attributed to their diet.\n\nNutrition Facts\nServing Size 1\/4 cup (47g)\nAmount Per Serving\nCalories 170 Calories from Fat 0\n% Daily Value *\nTotal Fat 0g0%\nSaturated Fat 0g0%\nTrans Fat 0g0%\nCholesterol 0mg0%\nSodium 0mg0%\nPotassium 70mg2%\nTotal Carbohydrate 37 mg12%\nDietary Fiber 0g0%\nSugars 0g%\nProtein 4g%\nIron 8%\n* The Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet, so your values may change depending on your calorie needs.

See the full menu.\n\n    Myron's Prime Steakhouse\n\n    Understated confidence comes through in everything from the clean lines of the modern, but not stark, interior to the relaxed, yet professional service, to the cuisine itself, according to MySA food critic Edmund Tijerina, who especially enjoyed the bone-in ribeye and chocolate cake at San Antonio's Myron's Prime Steakhouse. The restaurant represents the culmination of more than three decades of study in the art and science of steak. After gleaning everything he could from successful steakhouses, owner Bill Been decided to open his own. In 2003, he and his wife founded Myron's Prime Steakhouse in a historic New Braunfels theater. Eight years later, they launched a second location in San Antonio, which earned the distinction as \"Best Steakhouse in San Antonio\" from the Destination Guide. Both supply the same USDA prime steaks, which originate from corn-fed, Midwestern cows who cheer for the Wisconsin Badgers. Chefs handpick short loins and tenderize them with a wet-aging process, and dry-age other steaks to enhance their meaty flavors. Side dishes such as stuffed tomatoes with chives in gorgonzola cheese complement the steaks they accompany.\n\nFine Print Limit 1 per person. Limit 1 per table. Valid only for option purchased.

Walnut St. (W. 6th St.) Send to Phone\nA culinary jewel in the heart of this university town.\n\nDinner Mon.-Sat.\n\n* Click here for rating key\n\nTHIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED Restaurant Tallent Restaurant Review\n\n: Restaurant Tallent draws not only the students and alumni of this university town, but also diners from across the state as well as neighboring Illinois and Ohio. The reason is the inspired dishes of chef-owner David Tallent and his wife Kristen, prepared by a well-trained food-passionate staff. Start the gastronomic adventure with a whimsical country ham and quail egg biscuit or Indiana sweet corn with house-made pancetta, chanterelles and Parmesan. Entr\u00e9es often are simple, but with a twist. That may mean Indiana rib-eye steak with fried potato salad, corn relish and onion rings, or Gunthorp Farms pork with tomato pie, collard greens, ham hock and boiled peanut chow-chow. A five-course tasting menu crafted for the entire table features ingredients from local farmers and artisan producers. Servers can help with wine selections and suggest after-dinner drinks to go with your blackberry peach cobbler that's topped with sorghum grits ice cream. And, of course, you can eat your vegetables with a zucchini bread waffle with ice cream and chocolate sauce.\n\n\nGAYOT's Annual Restaurant Awards honor America's best chefs, as well as promising newcomers and a top restaurateur.",
