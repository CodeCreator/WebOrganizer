Using lukewarm or cold water under 30\u00b0C and squeeze gently. Turn inside out when hanging up and do not dry clothes in full sunlight.\n\n    4.The clothes should be at least 3 quarters dry before ironing. Ironing temperature recommended from 100\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C depending on the fabric.\n\n    5.The steam setting should be on high since ironing silk requires a lot of moisture. After the silk is lightly misted with water, it is placed face down on the ironing board and covered with a press cloth.\n\n    6.Avoid washing or bleaching for leather articles. Dry Cleaning is recommended for them.",
