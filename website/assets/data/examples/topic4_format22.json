        "text":"How to Improve your Quant Score in Competitive Exams?\n\n\nHow to Improve your Quant Score in Competitive Exams?\n\nQuant or Quantitative Aptitude refers to a test that checks the ability of a person to solve mathematical problems. In every competitive examination there is a section of Quantitative Aptitude. This section is quite tricky and a difficult one. On the other hand, it contains more marks too. The candidates mostly fail to clear the competitive exams as they are not able to clear the cut-off in this section as it carries more marks than other sections.\n\nIn order to succeed in the competitive exams, the students must try to improve their performance in this section. Quantitative Aptitude is also an important section in the Bank Exams too.\n\nThis article provides tricks for improving the Quantitative Aptitude scores in Competitive Exams.\n\nTips for improving scores in the Quant Section while attempting the Question Paper for different Competitive Exams:\n\n  1. Start with the easier questions- While attempting any questio paper, the candidate must keep in mind that the Quant section is quite difficult and if they start off with the questions that they are not enough confident then they might end up in not answering the full question paper.\n  2. Manage your time properly- As all of us are aware that the time is limited for answering the question paper, thus there is a requirement in order to manage the time sufficiently. If the candidate is unable to do so, then he\/she will not be able to finish the question paper in time.\n\nThis is because the Quant section has\u00a0Math calculations involved and if the candidate takes too much time in solving this section then all other sections will be left behind. So, here the importance of time management arises.\n\n  1. Do not rush- The candidates are advised not to get tensed and anxious in the exam hall. Be calm and try to solve questions. The questions that are difficult to be solved must be kept aside and try to solve those which seems easier.\n\nTips for a Good Preparation of the Quant Section:\n\n  1. Start Practicing Elementary Maths- The questions in the quant section involves mathematics that we might have studied in school. The formulae are also same for the calculations. Therefore, to get a good grip in this section the candidate is required to practice simple and basic maths.\n  2. Practice Mock Papers- In order to have an idea about the questions that are asked in the exams, the need is to practice mock papers and previous years\u2019 question papers. It will help a lot as there are different types of questions that are asked in the exams.\n  3. Memorise Important Formulae and Tables- The different formulae must be memorized by the candidate in order to save time during the examinations. Also, the cube roots and square roots must be learnt so that the calculations can be easily solved.\n\nSo, this was all regarding improving the Quant Scores in Competitive Exams. Hope it was useful.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nWith a degree in Engineering, Saswati Ghosh is a content writer by profession.

You may be asking these questions, and more. The dissertation is the crowning jewel on all the research that goes into the requirements for obtaining a doctoral degree.\n\nDefinition of a PhD dissertation\n\nA dissertation is a document written by a PhD candidate that is required as part of the process of awarding an academic degree.

You have already invested so much into it, there\u2019s no reason to quit now. Divide your work up into smaller-sized chunks, so it doesn\u2019t look so intimidating. Next, decide to do at least one thing per day until it is finished.\n\nThis is not the time to procrastinate.

First in this argumentative essay help, remember that your essay must contain three important parts, namely, the introduction, the main body and the conclusion. But the length of each part will greatly vary based on the instruction of professor or instructor.\n  2. Make an outline and do not begin without it.\n  3. What is your topic? What is your side of the story? An argumentative essay\u2019s main goal is to present your side of the topic, your points or arguments (agree or disagree) and to persuade people to taking this side. The first part of an argumentative research paper or essay must be the introduction or as short explanation of your topic, as well as a thesis statement and information background. The thesis is the most important part as it contains your position about a specific topic, mostly a controversial one.\n  4. Be able to present both sides of the coin or the topic or controversy.

        "text":"November 23, 2015 By Divine Nwachukwu\n\nChoosing a suitable case study for a research is an essential part of the process of carrying out a research or study. A case study simply put is that geographical location or kind of data that would make your research to be judged powerful. A research is said to be powerful if the case study of that research reflects the hypothesis for the topic under study. In choosing a suitable case study for your research or study, one has to consider:\n\nThe topic of the study\/research.\nIn choosing a case study, a lot has to depend on the topic under study. A case study that is not in tandem to the topic may lead to an experiment whose conclusions and recommendation aren\u2019t precise enough to be powerful and thus may lead to accepting a false null or alternative hypothesis. The topic of a study gives or shades light on the type of case study to employ in carrying out a research.\n\nA good example is a topic that has to do with school performance or school environment, employing a case study that falls outside a school environment may actually lead to responses from people who aren\u2019t experienced in academic matters, the consequence of this would simply be that generalizations reached\u00a0 when the data is analysed may lead to rejection of an alternative hypothesis that should be accepted or acceptance of an alternative hypothesis that should be rejected thus affecting the power or precision of the\u00a0 research.\u00a0 So for selecting a suitable case study, a lot has to depend on the topic of the study.\n\nThe topic of a research also tells us if a primary data or secondary data will be required for precision of the research. Certain topics especially in econometrics or economics discipline would require secondary method of collecting data e.g. published data instead of the primary means of collecting data like the interview or questionnaire method.\nIn other disciplines especially social sciences, the topic of a study simply put determines the case study that best fits it. For instance:\nFor a topic that centers on performance of firms or employees, a suitable case study should or must be an organization and the best form of data collection is through the primary means like the interview method or questionnaire distribution.\nIn conclusion, the topic of the research best tells us the nature of our case study and the best way to generate the data required for a powerful or pr\u00e9cised research.\n\nYou may also like: Making Awesome Presentations Developing Outstanding Research Topics How to Write an abstarct How to Write a Project Proposal How To Choose the Right Measurement Instrument\n\nWidget is loading comments...",

        "text":"How to Respond to Interview Requests by Letter\n\nby Ruth Mayhew, Demand Media\n\nIt's not often that you have to respond to an interview request with a formal written acceptance, but in case you do, send your response as quickly as you can. Don't wait long to reply, even if you're not interested in interviewing with the company. Show professional courtesy by sending a succinct, yet personal and timely, response to the person who requested the interview.\n\nExpress Your Thanks\n\nWhether you're responding to an interview request by letter using email or snail mail, always express your appreciation for the opportunity to move forward in the selection process. The first sentence of your reply should say how pleased you are for the invitation to interview with the recruiter or the hiring manager. In fact, re-state the interviewer's name if you receive a letter from a recruiter who is merely scheduling the interview for someone else.\n\n\nYour response to an interview request is a short one; however, separate your thank-you sentences from the body of your response. In the body, confirm whether you are available at the proposed time, or if you are interested at all in interviewing with the company. If you have no problem with the proposed interview date and time, write that you are available and re-state the scheduled time. For example, you could write, \"I am available on Tuesday, October 2, 2012, for a 10:00 a.m. interview with Ms. Jane Doe, head of sales and marketing. I look forward to meeting both of you. If you have questions or need additional information from me before the interview, please give me a call.\"\n\n\nYou shouldn't prolong the scheduling process, but you might not have a choice if you have to respond in writing to proposed interview times. In case you aren't available for an interview on the day and time the recruiter proposes, suggest alternate days or times. Provide the recruiter with options for rescheduling. For example, you could write, \"I'm certainly looking forward to interviewing with Ms. Jane Doe; however, I will be out of town on the date you proposed. Here's my availability for the remainder of that week: Wednesday, Oct. 3 from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.; Thursday, Oct. 4, from 1:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m.; and, Friday, Oct. 5, from 10:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.\"\n\nDeny Request\n\nIf you're no longer interested in the company or found another position, you still owe the requester the courtesy of a response. In your letter, write \"Thank you for the invitation to interview with Ms. Jane Doe for the sales and marketing position with your company. I appreciate your confidence in my abilities and qualifications; however, I've ended my job search and accepted a job with another organization. Again, thank you for your time.\"\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRuth Mayhew began writing in 1985.

So, what are the main blog article writing tips due to which we recognize blog writing?\n\n  \u2022 This type of writing normally doesn\u2019t use the third person because it is designed to become a tool of creating the world of person\u2019s thoughts. Therefore, the language of a blog is specifically author\u2019s, and it is usually simple and close to the readers.\n  \u2022 The structure is free depending on the author\u2019s preferences.\n  \u2022 A person who writes tends to communicate with their audience and offers to take part in what they describe by giving opinions or taking some measures.\n  \u2022 Blog posts aren\u2019t long. They are comprehensible and contain visual means like pictures or charts etc.\n  \u2022 There are also no obligatory requirements as for speech and form of a blog article. Both aspects are represented at the author\u2019s wish.\n\nTips on Writing a Good Blog Article\n\nHere are ten steps with the rules on how to write a blog post immaculately:\n\n  1. Decide Upon the Matter\n\nThere\u2019s an action that should be made prior to performing any type of writing. You have to take some time and consider the expectations of your target audience. Can you recollect what issues awoke more interest among its members? This will help you to understand what information can be accepted the most eagerly by the majority.\nDeliberate some dozen specific subjects which you find engaging to write about and share with others. It will not only facilitate your starting a blog, but will arm you with a significant stockpile of ideas for future blog post writing.\n\n  1. Draw Up a Blog Outline\n\nDivide the potential content into separate sense-bearing fragments which share similar or connected ideas to guide you throughout your blog article writing. Arrange these pieces in a relevant sequence so that your writing according to this plan was coherent and sounded natural. The composed outline is not a must-follow thing though. Writing a blog itself, you may see that your outline needs to be made certain corrections for, such as making some elements more specific or merging the minor ones into the whole.\n\n  1. Work Out the Cunning Start\n\nA smart headline is the key to effective blog article writing. It is the first and, in many cases, the only thing that calls attention to the material. Therefore, it is a huge mastery to create a headline which will be able to involve anyone into further reading and to begin your article with a prominent sentence.\n\n10 Simple Steps to Successful Blogging\n\n  1. Technological Blogging Tips\n\nBlog post writing gives you a chance to gain a good reputation among the other content sources as long as such an article, as opposed to a magazine article, leaves you the option of filling the text with key words and phrases. Whatever the way things are, you have to always put focus on your audience\u2019s interests and tastes and to develop your idea to the extent which will make the material significant and worthy. When coming up with the relevant key phrases, make a small research on what are the most frequently asked questions, pick up the appropriate word combinations to apply them to your blog post. Although, check whether they fit in the text unconstrainedly and whether they don\u2019t seem useless or abundant.\n\n  1. Elaborate the Easy-to-Look-Through Effect\n\nIt\u2019s not convenient to work with a text which looks like a continuous stream of information that doesn\u2019t give you a chance to distinguish its meaningful parts, much less read it for entertainment. That is why it\u2019s an important requirement to divide your material into sections which you need to mark by visual means or come up with short names for each of them. The more logical segments you create the better.\n\n  1. Use Visual Blog Writing Techniques\n\nOne of the means to create the effect mentioned above is to add visual elements to your blog. Use various figures, photos, tables etc. This will not only facilitate relevant text segmentation but will also make your writing more organized and the content itself clearer.\n\n  1. Make a Reference to What You Need Others to See\n\nThere has to be the purpose of your writing which is to be defined in a blog post itself. If you want to refer your target audience to some service or product which you offer, you should point that out as soon as all the main information is revealed. Remember though that demonstrating the nudge to do what you suggest is not a sole purpose, that is why do that subtly. Try to apply more of a hint or a positive recommendation instead of a direct order.\n\n  1. Even If You Know Perfectly How to Write a Blog Article\n\n\u2026 you are still required to do the check-up of your content as regards any mistakes and misspells. But do that after taking a walk or after a sleep to make sure you won\u2019t miss anything. Look over the coherence and relevance of your material. Pay special attention to the heading after the work is done and ask someone\u2019s opinion on the whole text.\n\n  1. Highlight the Value of Your Material\n\nIt means that you need to keep your article insightful and beneficial. If the things you write about have some practical value, your material will probably win many hearts. How to create a blog worth attention? Just think about the importance of your ideas from time to time while writing.\n\n  1. Establish Connection With the Rest\n\nThe era of technological development has presented us a brilliant possibility to promote our ideas via the virtual means of social interaction. Taking advantage of them, everyone is able to tell each and every one about their activity.\n\nPrev Next",

It should only happen after all redeployment options have been exhausted.\n\nWhen an employer advises an employee that they have not been successful in the redeployment process they should make sure that the employee is offered at least all of the support that is mentioned in the employment agreement or policies and\/or has been mentioned in the change proposal.\n\nThings you should consider include:\n\n  \u2022 checking that all redeployment and alternative options have been worked through with the employee. Recheck this with the employee also\n  \u2022 checking what date the job is to be disestablished. Will it be needed for longer? Are there any other options for the employee to stay on longer while further redeployment options are considered? Is the employee agreeable to continue working for a while and take redundancy later?\n  \u2022 counselling support where outplacement is not made available or outplacement does not include counselling\n  \u2022 outplacement support which may include:\n    \u2022 counselling\n    \u2022 Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume\u00a0support\n    \u2022 interview skills training\n    \u2022 other training that may improve the employee's chances of future employment\n    \u2022 career advice\n\nMeet with the employee and discuss with them the next steps. You can use our Process leading to redundancy flowchart [PDF 166KB] to talk through the steps with your employee. You need to confirm the employee\u2019s notice of redundancy in writing.\n\nThe notice period must be at least the length of notice referred to in the employment agreement or workplace policies. If the employee agrees you may give an extended notice period while they continue in their role, or in a special project of some sort, while the change implementation is completed (or as agreed). This can allow for other redeployment opportunities to be explored. The employee does not have to agree to a later date.\n\nNotice of redundancy\n\nIf there is no specific clause in an employment agreement giving a period of notice in a redundancy situation, \u2018reasonable notice\u2019 must be given. The length of \u2018reasonable notice\u2019 depends on a variety of factors, such as:\n\n  \u2022 the reason for the redundancy\n  \u2022 the employee\u2019s length of service\n  \u2022 the employee\u2019s seniority and\/or remuneration package\n  \u2022 custom, practice and industry norms\n  \u2022 the employee\u2019s ability to find alternative employment\n  \u2022 the amount of compensation being paid (if any).\n\nFinal payments\n\nRemember that unused annual leave and salary, along with any other entitlements, up to the end date is payable. Notice of termination of employment must be given in accordance with the employee\u2019s agreement. Consider whether you want the employee to work the notice or be paid their notice.\n\nRedundancy compensation\n\nWhether employees receive redundancy payments is dependent on the applicable employment agreements and is a matter for negotiation between the parties. However, all employees whose employment is ending due to redundancy must be given notice in terms of the employment agreement. An employer can require an employee to work out their notice.\n\nStill haven't found what you're looking for?",

        "text":"Help Finding Jobs for Army Reserves\n\nby Brooke Julia\nThe Army offers tools to help you choose a career path.\n\nThe Army offers tools to help you choose a career path.\n\nStockbyte\/Stockbyte\/Getty Images\n\nJoining the Army Reserves is an option for those who want to earn valuable experience in the military and defend their country while enjoying the freedom of civilian life. The Reserves offers a variety of job opportunities based on your skills, interests and strengths. Your scores on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB, also help determine which jobs are right for you.\n\nASVAB and Job Opportunities\n\nYour scores on the ASVAB are used to determine the military career specialties for which you're suited. There are no pass or fail grades for the ASVAB, but you do need to earn at least a 31 to be accepted into the Army Reserves. Reservist jobs are broken down into nine general categories, which are administration, law, mechanics, arts, medical, computer technology, intelligence, construction and aviation. To see what you qualify for, take your test results to a recruiter, or visit the U.S. Army website to plug your scores in. Your information will generate a list of opportunities open to you.\n\nArmy Career Explorer\n\nExploring Army Reserve jobs is as easy as opening your laptop. All you have to do is visit the U.S. Army website's Career Explorer. Create an account, and answer a few questions about yourself. Then, select a search time frame to show available jobs that match your answers. Choose the jobs that interest you the most and then prioritize them from most to least desirable. When you're ready, you can even submit your application online, which will be sent to a local recruiter who will get in touch with you.\n\nJob Placement Tests\n\nYou can also search Reserve jobs online based on your skills or interests. If you want to search by skills, you'll need to take an eight-step quiz that will determine your skill levels in different categories. If you want to search by interests, you'll complete a quiz with 14 either\/or questions. Your answers will help compile a list of jobs that suit you.\n\nTalk to a Recruiter\n\nSitting down with a recruiter is another way to get help with choosing a job in the Army Reserves. You can search for a recruiter in your area by going to the U.S. Army website and entering your area of interest and your zip code into its recruiter locator. You can send an email or make a phone call to set up an appointment with a recruiter if you're in the United States. If you're a U.S. citizen living overseas, send an email and a recruiter will get in touch with you.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBrooke Julia has been a writer since 2009.
