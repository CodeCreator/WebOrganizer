Changes in the nature of the legal profession and the market, the cost of legal education, and most recently the purpose of the third year of law school, have each been at the center of professional conversations, public debate and media stories about reform.\n\nLike my colleagues at other law schools, I am certainly involved with these critical conversations. I am also working with GGU Law faculty members and program leaders to launch and execute a comprehensive three-year action plan this fall. The plan will provide clear strategy and guidance and more importantly, tackle critical areas that address the needs of students from the time they enter law school through their transition into the profession.\n\n\nArticle from the Spring\/Summer 2013 issue of Golden Gate Lawyer.",

In particular the role of \"bonding\" and \"bridging\" capital is discussed: bonding with other Jews, bonding with research colleagues of similar orientations; and bridging with Jews different from myself, Jews in different cultural\/societal contexts, between Jews and non-Jews, and between scholars of different orientations. The role of mentors as facilitating and non-facilitating gatekeepers is also discussed. The reflective exercise is recommended as a re-centering device for all scholars. Suggestions for investing in further research in Jewish studies follow the expansion of both bonding and bridging research capital opportunities, such as establishing a think-tank facilitating ongoing dialogue between qualitative and quantitative researchers, and researchers using different units of analysis, in Jewish studies; developing a common core of community study questions and subsidizing their inclusion in community studies; establishing an international question bank to increase comparability and standardization in upcoming surveys; expanding the North American Jewish Data Bank to be global; and reaching out for comparability beyond the community of Jewish studies research. The suitability of the Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry as an infrastructure for some of the networking endeavors suggested is considered.\n\n    Original languageEnglish (US)\n    Pages (from-to)107-123\n    Number of pages17\n    JournalContemporary Jewry\n    Issue number2\n    StatePublished - Aug 2014\n\n    All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) codes\n\n    \u2022 Cultural Studies\n    \u2022 History\n    \u2022 Anthropology\n    \u2022 Religious studies\n\n\n    Dive into the research topics of 'Reflections on My Jewish Habitus and Perspectives'.

The aim of modern management of ectopic pregnancy should be to diagnose ectopic pregnancy accurately, so that women can seek prompt diagnosis and treatment and optimize their future fertility. Methods : This prospective study was done for a period of one year in patients suspected clinically to have ectopic pregnancies which were subsequently confirmed by pregnancy test and ultrasonography (n=17). The following parameters: age and parity of the patient, relevant past medical and surgical history, significant clinical findings at presentation, management done and outcome of the management were noted. Results : Most patients 13 (76.47%) were in the age group of 20-25 years and 16 (94.11%) of them presented with acute pain abdomen. In all cases, emergency laparotomy was performed. There were 16 cases of tubal ectopic and one of ovarian pregnancy. Right side was affected in 14 (82.35%) cases including one right sided ovarian ectopic. Tubal rupture was found in 10 (58.82%) patients. The most common 12 (75%) site of tubal pregnancy was ampullary. Salpingectomy was performed in 14 (82.35%) cases. All patients were discharged by seventh postoperative day. Conclusion : Ectopic pregnancy can be suspected clinically by history and associated risk factors. Women presenting with acute pain abdomen with a positive urine \u03b2-hCG test should be promptly diagnosed and treated without undue delay to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.

It argues for an indigenous origin of Pentecostalism in Rajasthan, as it is a product of local Spirit revivals in the existing churches and the missionary activities of Indian Pentecostals. It also reveals that both the intra-church as well as extra-church issues place Pentecostals in a \u2018missio-ethical dilemma.\u2019 The thesis aims to suggest \u2018a contextual missiology of the Spirit,\u2019 as a new model of contextual missiology from a Pentecostal perspective, which has emerged from this study. The inherent theological characteristics of Pentecostalism underline the pneumatological foundation of a contextual Pentecostal missiology. As a contextual missiology of the Spirit it has certain contextual features. By dealing with the global-local tension, it can be considered a glocal missiology. It is capable of promoting ecumenicity at various levels, and so it is an ecumenical missiology. By empowering people to engage in spiritual as well as socio-political issues, it aims to be a transformational missiology. As it is concerned with the well-being of the community, it has the potential to become a public missiology.\n\nType of Work:Ph.D. thesis.\nSupervisor(s):Anderson, Allan\nSchool\/Faculty:Colleges (2008 onwards) > College of Arts & Law\nDepartment:School of Philosophy, Theology and Religion\nSubjects:BR Christianity\nBX Christian Denominations\nInstitution:University of Birmingham\nID Code:294\nThis unpublished thesis\/dissertation is copyright of the author and\/or third parties.

Divergences from these assumptions and identification of remedies are the subject of ongoing research.\n\nOnce these and other uses of field performance data have been institutionalized with the accompanying benefits, the quality of such data is likely to improve. One important application in which industrial field performance data have recently been improving in quality is sensors that can collect the entire history of use of, say, an automobile, including stresses, speeds of use, temperature, etc. That information can be linked to information on system reliability or performance to support much richer statistical reliability modeling. Use of such sensors could be valuable in operational testing for similar reasons.1 Several companies are undertaking efforts to save additional data in their warranty databases so the data can be used not only for financial purposes, but also for reliability assessment and estimation. Such efforts represent a cultural change. A hurdle is that development or expansion of such a database sometimes requires innovative funding approaches.\n\nDiscussion of Gaver, Sen, Scholz, and Meeker Papers\n\nIn his discussion of the papers by Sen and Gaver, Paul Ellner addressed the complication involved in reliability growth modeling of translating reliability estimates from developmental test to predictions of reliability in the field from operational test. At present, analysts may use a reliability growth model to extrapolate from developmental test results to operational test results. This approach can be severely biased, producing overly optimistic reliability estimates since the failure modes can be substantially different in the two situations (actually three\u2014developmental test, operational test, and field performance). Efforts to perform this translation face the following challenges: (1) determining the (approximate) relationship between failure modes that occur jointly in developmental and operational environments, and (2) identifying a function expressing the probability of failure in operational test as a function of the probability of failure in operational test due to failure modes not present in developmental test. This translation probably cannot be done at the system level; it must be carried out at the com-\n\n\nThese sensors could be used to monitor reliability degradation during field use and to support efficient logistics management.\n\nThe National Academies | 500 Fifth St. N.W. | Washington, D.C. 20001\nCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

        "text":"William Petersen on the Concept of an \u201cOriginal\u201d Text\n\nWilliam Peterson (1950 \u2013 2006) was one of the most erudite scholars when it came to New Testament textual criticism. He was probably best-known as one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Tatian\u2019s\u00a0Diatessaron, the most prominent early harmony of the four gospels, likely composed around the year 170 CE. About five years after his death, a volume of Peterson\u2019s collected essays was published by Brill. I recently revisited one essay in the middle of that volume, as it relates directly to the question I\u2019ve been exploring regarding current debates about the status of the designation \u201coriginal text\u201d to describe the text being reconstructed by New Testament textual critics. The essay is titled, \u201cWhat Text Can New Testament Textual Criticism Ultimately Reach?\u201d and it was first published in 1994!\u00b9\n\nPetersen\u2019s essay is divided into three parts. Part 1 sketches the problem in two ways. First, he notes the difficulty of defining what is meant by the \u201coriginal\u201d text, particularly when it comes to the text of the New Testament. Petersen uses the gospel of Mark as his example, asking whether our understanding of the \u201coriginal\u201d Mark is based on fourth-century (or later) manuscripts or on the minor agreements between the gospels of Matthew and Luke, since most scholars believe that Matthew and Luke both had access to their own copies of Mark\u2019s gospel.\n\nSecond, Petersen points out the fact that despite the monumental nature of recent discoveries of early Christian papyri, as well as the work being done on the citations of New Testament texts among the early church fathers, our critical editions of the Greek New Testament have remained virtually the same since the text of Westcott and Hort, which relied heavily on the fourth century manuscripts, Sinaiticus (\u05d0) and Vaticanus (B). Here\u2019s how Petersen describes the situation:\n\nThe papyri have been trumpeted as offering a text which is \u201ccloser to the original\u201d than any other extant evidence. Yet it is simply a fact that\u00a0nowhere in the\u00a0entire apparatus for the gospels in Nestle-Aland27\/UBS4 is there a\u00a0single instance where a reading supported\u00a0just by the papyri, or by\u00a0just the papyri and Patristic evidence has been adopted as the text. This poses an awkward question: If, as alleged, the papyri preserve a text \u201ccloser to the original,\u201d then why do they not contribute any new readings to the critical text? (221-222)\n\nPart 2 of the essay illustrates this problem with three examples. For the sake of brevity, I\u2019ll only focus on the first, which is drawn from the pericope about the rich young ruler (Matthew 19:17\/\/). Here is the text (with parallels) from the current critical edition (NA28):\n\nMatthew 19.17 Mark 10.18 Luke 18.19\n\u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.\n\n\nMark and Luke have identical texts, with Jesus responding to the rich young ruler by saying, \u201cNo one is good except God alone.\u201d In Matthew\u2019s gospel, however, Jesus\u2019 response is briefer, \u201cThere is only one who is good.\u201d\n\nPetersen points out for his readers that Justin Martyr (c. 150 CE) almost certainly quotes the Matthean version of this pericope, but he includes the phrase \u201cmy father in the heavens\u201d afterwards.\n\nJustin Martyr (c. 150 CE): e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n\nPetersen goes on to show that this longer reading in Justin Martyr is actually found in several early Christian sources. He notes the following examples (225-226):\n\n  1. Tatian, Diatessaron (c. 172 CE), as per Ephrem Syrus, Commentary on the Diatessaron, XV.9:\n    \u2022 \u071a\u0715 \u0717\u0718 \u0720\u0721 \u071b\u0712\u0710 \u0710\u0712\u0710 \u0715\u0712\u072b\u0721\u071d\u0710\n  2. Irenaeus, Against Heresies, I.20.2 (pre-185 CE):\n    \u2022 \u0395\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n  3. Hippolytus, Refutation of All Heresies, V.7.25\u00a0(pre-222 CE):\n    \u2022 e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n  4. Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, V.10.63 (c. 207 CE):\n    \u2022 e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1\n  5. The Pseudo-Cementine Homilies XVI.3.4 (c. 260 CE):\n    \u2022 \u1f41 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n  6. Old Latina MS e (Mattew; 5th cent.):\n    \u2022 Unus est bonus, pater.\n  7. Old Latina MS d (Luke; 5th cent.):\n    \u2022 Nemo bonus nisi unus Deus pater\n\nThese witnesses, which are are all early and broadly distributed, support Justin\u2019s citation of Matthew\u2019s text. This means, as Petersen notes, \u201cthe oldest-known version of this Matthean pericope contains the phrase \u2018my Father in the heavens'\u201d (226, emphasis original). Yet despite this evidence our critical editions continue to present Matthew\u2019s text as only \u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2.\n\nThis leads to Part 3 of Petersen\u2019s essay. Given the early nature of the textual variant and its attestation above (with similar evidences for the other two examples he provides) why have we not changed our critical editions to fit this evidence? Petersen argues, once again, that textual critics have become too attached to the so-called \u201cAlexandrian\u201d or \u201cNeutral\u201d text represented by the later fourth century majuscules \u05d0 and B. \u00a0Instead of allowing earlier witnesses (i.e. the papyri and especially the patristic sources) to play a crucial role in determining the earliest form of the text of the New Testament, critics tend to use them merely as witnesses in support of readings that were already preferred on the basis of \u05d0 and B. More controversially, Petersen states that certain \u201ctheological standards\u201d are also keeping critics from adopting Justin\u2019s version of Matthew 19:17, since these theological standards would deem that particular variant \u201cunacceptable\u201d (234). In fact, this is Petersen\u2019s explanation for why these variant readings were not retained in the manuscript tradition: \u201cthe reading was suppressed because\u00a0in later times it was no longer\u00a0theologically acceptable\u201d (231, emphasis original). What makes them theologically unacceptable, according to Petersen, is that they are adoptionistic in nature. But this sort of explanation of the evidence seems reductionistic, and it fails to take account of all the available evidence we have on this particular variant. As Holger Strutwolf notes in his article entitled, \u201cOriginal Text and Textual History,\u201d\n\nWhat is strange about [Petersen\u2019s] theory is that the supported orthodox reading, which is supposed to have pushed away the reading that later came under suspicion of heresy, did not become the majority reading. Quite the contrary, it is attested only by very few, but very old and good witnesses, while the majority of manuscripts support a reading that is far from sounding more orthodox. In fact, the majority reading appears as heretical and dogmatically incorrect as the text of Justin.\u00b2\n\nIt therefore seems very unlikely that this particular variant is another case of the so-called \u201corthodox corruption\u201d of scripture. In any case, one does not have to agree with Petersen\u2019s explanations for why the variant given above is excluded from our critical editions in order to see the value of his broader contention.\n\nSo, in the end, how does Petersen answer the question posed by the essay\u2019s title? Here is how the essay concludes:\n\nThe question facing textual critics today is not \u201cHow far back\u00a0can\u00a0we go?\u201d\u2026we can go back to the time of Ignatius,\u00a0c. 107 CE. Rather, the question is \u201cHow far back do we\u00a0wish\u00a0to go?\u201d The answer to this question is never stated openly; rather, it must be intuited from the sources used to construct the critical text of a particular edition.\n\nAt present it appears that the furthest back we wish to go is the third century, and the method we use is the agreement of the papyri and the uncials. If, however, we really wish to\u2026reconstruct the text \u201cas close as possible to the original,\u201d then we must avail ourselves of the Patristic sources\u00a0and take their witness seriously. And unlike the papyri, the use of Patristic evidence will, as our exhibits have shown, significantly alter the shape of the critical text. (235)\n\nWorks Cited\n\n\u00b9 William L.

This fallacy is particularly hugged by the Parsis among whom\nit was originally lent by fanaticism to indolent ignorance. It has been\ncredited with uncritical alacrity, congenial to self-complacency, that\nthe Arabs so utterly and ruthlessly annihilated the civilization of Iran\nin its mental and material aspects that no source whatever is left from\nwhich to wring reliable information about Zoroastrian Iran. The\nfollowing limited pages are devoted to a disproof of this age-long\n\nFor a connected story of Persia prior to the battle of Kadisiya, beside\nthe Byzantine writers there is abundant material in Armenian and Chinese\nhistories. These mines remain yet all but unexplored for the Moslem and\nParsi, although much has been done to extract from them a chronicle of\nearly Christianity. The archaeology of Iran, as I have shown elsewhere,\ncan provide vital clue to an authentic resuscitation of Sasanian past.\nPre-Moslem epigraphy of Persia is yet in little more than an inchoate\ncondition. Not only all Central Asia but the territories marching with\nthe Indian and Persian frontiers, where persecution of the elder faith\ncould not have been relatively mild, the population professing Islam\nhave been unable to abjure in their entirety rites and practices akin to\nthose of Zoroastrianism. Within living memory the inhabitants of Pamir\nwould not blow out a candle or otherwise desecrate fire. While science\ncannot recognise the claims of any individual professing to have studied\nesoteric Zoroastrianism hidden in the hill tracts of Rawalpindi, the\nmyth has a value in that it indicates the direction in which humbler and\nuninspired scholars may work. These regions and far beyond, teem with\npure Iranian place-names to this day; and you meet in and around even\nthe Peshawar district individuals bearing names of old Iranian heroes\nwhich, if the theory of persecution-mongers be correct, would be an\nanathema to the bigoted followers of Muhammad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is, above all, Arabic literature which upsets the easy fiction of\ntotal destruction of Iranian culture by the Arabs. In its various\ndepartments of history, geography and general science Arabic works\nincorporate extensive material for a history of Iranian civilization,\nwhile Arabic poetry abounds in references to Zoroastrian Iran. The\nformer is illustrated by Professor Inostranzev's pioneer Russian essay\nof which the main body of this book is a translation. The Appendices are\nintended to be supplementary and to be at once a continuation and a\npossible key--continuation of the researches of the Russian scholar and\nkey to the contemned store-house of Arabic letters.\n\nProfessor Inostranzev is in little need of introduction to English\nscholars. He has already been made known in India by the indefatigable\nShams-ul-Ulma Dr. Jivanji Modi, Ph.D., C.I.E., who got translated, and\ncommented on, his Russian paper on the curious _Astodans_ or receptacles\nfor human bones discovered in the Persian Gulf region. He shares with\nProfessor Browne of Cambridge and the great M. Blochet a unique\nscholarly position: he combines an intimate knowledge of Avesta\ncivilization with a familiarity with classical Arabic. It is not\nwilfully to ignore the claims of Goldziher, Brockelmann or Sachau or\nthe Dutch savants de Goeje and Van Vloten. Deeply as they investigated\nArabic writings, it was M. Inostranzev who first revealed to us the\nworth of Arabic: he unearthed chapters embedded in Arabic books which\nare paraphrase or translation of Pahlavi originals. He had but one\npredecessor and that was a countryman of his, Baron Rosen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn preparing the Appendices, which are there to testify to the value of\nArabic literature especially the annals and the branch of it called\nAdab, I have availed myself of the courtesy of various institutions and\nindividuals. Bombay, perhaps the wealthiest town in the East where\nprosperous Musalmans form a most important factor of its population, has\nnot one public library containing any tolerable collection of Arabic\nbooks edited in Europe. Time after time wealthy Parsis whose interest I\nenlisted have received from me lists of books to form the nucleus of an\nArabic library but apparently they need some further stimulus to\nappreciate how indispensable Arabic is for research into Iranian\nantiquities. The Bombay Government have expended enormous sums in\ncollecting Sanskrit manuscripts--a most laudable pursuit--and have\npublished a series of admirable texts edited by some of the eminent\nSanskrit scholars, Western and Indian. But the numerous Moslem Anjumans\ndo not appear to have demonstrated to the greatest Moslem Power in the\nworld, or its representative in Bombay, the necessity of a corresponding\nsolicitude for Arabic and Persian treasures which undoubtedly exist,\nthough to a lesser extent, in the Presidency. And what holds true of\nBombay holds good in case of the rest of India. Some of the libraries in\nUpper India in Hyderabad, Rampur, Patna, Calcutta possess along with\nmanuscript material cheap mutilated Egyptian reprints of magnificent\ntexts brought out in Leiden, Paris and Leipzig. Nowhere in India is\navailable to a research scholar a complete set of European publications\nin Arabic, which a few thousand rupees can purchase. The state of\naffairs is due to Moslem apathy, politics claiming a disproportionate\nshare of their civic energy, to Government indifference and to some\nextent Parsi supineness and prejudice which, despite the community's\nvaunted advancement, has failed to estimate at its proper worth their\nhistory as enshrined in the language of the pre-judged Arab.\n\nMoulvi Muhammad Ghulam Rasul Surti, of Bombay, himself a scholar, lent\nme from his bookshop expensive works which few private students could\nafford to buy. No western book-seller could have conceived a purer love\nof learning or a gaze less rigidly fixed on \"business\". Sir John\nMarshall, Director General of Archaeology in India, continued very\nkindly to permit me use of books after I had severed official connection\nwith his library at Simla. Dr. Spooner who acted for him obligingly saw\nthat as far as he was concerned no facilities were incontinently\nwithdrawn from me at Benmore. I have particularly to thank the Librarian\nof the Imperial Library, Calcutta, who not on... (truncated)",

        "text":"Motivating public employees; changing the public sector from inside\n\nMotivating public employees; changing the public sector from inside\nIt is not possible to link the personal or professional public sector employees motivations\nwith one isolated \"factor\" or \"element\".\nLikewise, it also depends on the perspective through which observe the situation. It can be\nseen from the perspective of the employee through the achievement of personal and \/ or\nprofessional reasons.\nIt can also be approached from the perspective of the heads of the public sector through the\nappropriation of efficiency in organizational processes they lead to improved results. A last one\ncould be from the perspective of the organization itself, depending on the work area and a specific\nprofile to fulfill its obligations to the public.\nWhat is determinant for people to choose, to start or continue, their careers in the public\nsector is a question that cannot be answered universally due to the infinite number of possible\nreasons for some of the persons involved in the development of processes. In turn, it depends on the\ncontext in which the question is made.\nIf the question arises with pretensions to intervene the current processes of an organization\nto improve the achievement of results, it could be say that the motivations are the continuous\nnegotiations between employees and the organization for the alignment of objectives; i.e., that both\nthe organization and the employee are heading to achieve the same objectives in a look now\n(present) the organizational ideal (future).\nIn this context, necessary elements such as a strong economic proposal (compensation) or\nexcellent leadership to align and coordinate the interests of the parties.\nMoreover, if the question arises preventively, i.e., not to intervene a current situation but\nplan a future situation, we could say that the motivations of employees (elected according to\nspecific criteria) rest on solid definition of the values and objectives the organizations to which it is\nlinked (or seek to link a future through a selection process), leaving the other elements as\nremuneration and leadership in the background.\nAmong this universe of interpretations, a tentative answer would be that the motivations of\npublic employees are more than a list of items; a series of complex processes (organizational\nculture) series whose actors to employees (human resources), the heads (results) and the\norganization itself (reason for being), which is developed over time by negotiating items such as\nleadership, remuneration and organizational values to achieve goals.\nIn this perspective, I would like to emphasize that while there is no single formula to\ndetermine the nature of the motivations of public employees (or enlarge them), but we can certainly\nfragmenting the processes factors in order to analyze not as a reactive process (motivations as a\nstimulus for action and reaction), but as a reflexive process (the ability to determine the key points\nfor planning with foresight before starting any organizational process).\nThus, it is worth addressing the issue in two stages as proposed by Schott, Kleef and Steen;\nthe identity of the institution (what, how, when and why of their work) and the identity of the\nworker of the institution (what, why and how).\nThis concept, since the theory of identity is defined as the \"self\" as the reflection \"which\nemerges out of the interaction with these complex social structures and provides the link between\nthe environment and personal behavior\" (Schott, Kleef, & Steen, 2014a, p.693).\nThereby, it could identify a typology of motivations based on the determination of the\npersonality of the organization and the profile of the potential workers to establish processes that\nenable proactive labors and relationships over negotiations for the development of the daily chores.\nWithin the logic of the joint work is based on the principle that people are the ones who\nmust adapt to institutions where they have to perform their work. How we refer to a specific sector\n(public sector), human talent as a minimum requirement should be a primary interest in serving the\ncommunity (which is the basic idea of working in the sector).\nIn this regard, the same authors claim that people who work in this sector \"can be described\nas a personal orientation or commitment toward the public interest\". (Schott, Kleef, & Steen, 2014c,\np.692). In other words, they must have some specific characteristics before start doing any public\njob. This characteristics must work as a personal and professional motivations in relation to their\nprofessional features.\nThe personal and professional motivations, from the perspective of Weibel, Rost, and\nOsterloh (2010) can be addressed from two perspectives; that of extrinsic type and those of intrinsic\ntype. Referring to \u201cextrinsic,\" is defined as the kind of motivations that seeks \"personal needs\nindirectly, that is, extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to separable\noutcomes: such as monetary compensation\" (Ryan & Deci, 2000, p.58).\nIn turn, referring to the type \u201cintrinsic\u201d motivations are those that are \u201cthought to be\nintrinsically rewarding if they are perceived to be interesting, That is, to be challenging, enjoyable,\nor purposeful\" (Weibel, A. Rost, K., & Osterloh, M., 2010, p. 389).\nConsidering the above contributions, it could be argued that the motivation must come or be\npart of the characteristics of people seeking work in the public sector (qualities and motivations of\nreflective type) before imposing or trying to influence them from external level (generating qualities\nattempt reactively).\nIn brief, the public sector worker has a specific profile with defined characteristics that can\nget in tune with the characteristics of a public organization; which means that personal, professional\nand organizational motivations are in complete harmony to the search for a common goal.\nSchott, C., van Kleef, D.

A political-economy model for the allocation of public infrastructure investment grants is formulated. Our empirical findings, using a panel of large German cities for the years 1980, 1986, and 1988, suggest that cities ruled by a council sharing the State (\u2018Bundesland\u2019) government's current political affiliation were particularly successful in attracting infrastructure investment grants. With regard to the contribution of infrastructure accumulation to growth, we find that public capital is a significant factor for private production. Moreover, at least for the sample studied, we find that simultaneity between output and public capital is weak; thus, feedback effects from output to infrastructure are negligible. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG - (Politische \u00d6konomie der Allokation von Infrastrukturinvestitionen: Empirische Evidenz von einem Paneldatensatz gro\u00dfer deutscher St\u00e4dte) Dieses Papier verwendet ein simultanes Gleichungssystem zur Sch\u00e4tzung des Beitrags von Infrastrukturinvestitionen zu regionalem Wachstum. Ein polit-\u00f6konomisches Modell der Allokation von Finanzzuweisungen f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche Investitionen in Infrastruktur wird formuliert. Unsere empirischen Ergebnisse basierend auf einem Paneldatensatz f\u00fcr gro\u00dfe deutsche St\u00e4dte in den Jahren 1980, 1986 und 1988 deuten darauf hin, dass St\u00e4dte, deren Mehrheit im Stadtrat die selbe politische \"Couleur\" wie die Landesregierung hatte, erfolgreicher bei der Zuteilung von Finanzzuweisungen waren. Im Hinblick auf den Beitrag der Infrastrukturakkumulation auf das Wachstum finden wir, dass \u00f6ffentliches Kapital ein wichtiger Faktor f\u00fcr die private Produktion ist. Weiterhin, zumindest f\u00fcr den untersuchten Zeitraum, finden wir, dass die Simultanit\u00e4t zwischen Output und \u00f6ffentlichem Kapital gering ist; daher sind Feedback-Effekte von Output zur Infrastruktur vernachl\u00e4ssigbar.\n\nIf you experience problems downloading a file, check if you have the proper application to view it first.

Understanding this relationship is important because the implicit or explicit recognition of document genre by users has been shown to improve document usability and aid in the production of web documents (Yates & Sumner, 1997). The first stage of our research is richly descriptive in nature: our goal is to identify, describe and classify (a) web document genres used by persons in three different social systems (grade- and high-school teachers, journalists and medical residents) and (b) the work tasks associated with these genres. Our data collection methods will be largely inductive and will involve observation of and interviews with targeted users in their work environment. Analyses will rely on content-analytic methods (Katz, 1966) applied to a foundation of user descriptions and researchers' notes. The resulting classification of web document genres and associated tasks will be faceted in nature (see, e.g., Kwasnik, 1992, for a discussion of its advantages) and, it is hoped, sufficiently flexible to accommodate future, unanticipated web document genres. A presentation at Connections 2005 will report on the progress of this two-year, NSF-funded study that began in October 2004.",

When the relevant pool of patients is limited, as it often is, trials essentially compete for participants. There is evidence that such a competition is a predictor of low study accrual, with increased competition tied to increased recruitment shortfalls. But there is no consensus on what steps, if any, institutions should take to approach this issue. In this article, we argue that an institutional policy that prioritises some trials for recruitment ahead of others is ethically permissible and indeed prima facie preferable to alternative means of addressing recruitment competition. We motivate this view by appeal to the ethical importance of minimising the number of studies that begin but do not complete, thereby exposing their participants to unnecessary risks and burdens in the process. We then argue that a policy of prioritisation can be fair to relevant stakeholders, including participants, investigators and funders. Finally, by way of encouraging and helping to frame future debate, we propose some questions that would need to be addressed when identifying substantive ethical criteria for prioritising between studies.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 loading \u00a0Loading Related Articles",

Kim, Hazel Lum\n\nResearch output: Contribution to journalArticle\n\n\nP120 catenin (p120ctn) belongs to the family of Armadillo repeat-containing proteins, which are believed to have dual functions of cell-cell adhesion and transcriptional regulation. In vascular endothelium, p120ctn is mostly recognized for its cell-cell adhesion function through its ability to regulate VE-cadherin. The current study investigated whether p120ctn in endothelial cells also has the capability to signal transcription events. Examination of several endothelial cell types indicated that Kaiso, a p120ctn-binding transcription factor, was abundantly expressed, with a predominant localization to the perinuclear region. Immunoprecipitation of endothelial cell lysates with a p120ctn antibody resulted in p120ctn-Kaiso complex formation, confirming the interactions of the two proteins. Transfection of the KBS (Kaiso-binding sequence) luciferase reporter plasmid into endothelial cells resulted in a 40% lower reporter activity compared to the mutant Kaiso-insensitive construct or empty vector pGL3, indicating that the suppressed reporter activity was attributed to endogenous Kaiso. The knock-down of p120ctn increased the KBS reporter activity 2-fold over control, but had no effects on the mutant KBS reporter activity. Furthermore, p120ctn knock-down also reduced Kaiso expression, suggesting that p120ctn functioned to stabilize Kaiso. Overall, the findings provide evidence that in endothelial cells, p120ctn has a transcription repression function through regulation of Kaiso, possibly as a cofactor with the transcription factor.\n\nOriginal languageEnglish (US)\nPages (from-to)233-239\nNumber of pages7\nJournalMicrovascular Research\nIssue number2\nStatePublished - Sep 1 2010\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Armadillo repeat-containing proteins\n  \u2022 Endothelial cells\n  \u2022 Kaiso\n  \u2022 P120 catenin\n  \u2022 Transcription repression\n  \u2022 VE-cadherin\n\nASJC Scopus subject areas\n\n  \u2022 Biochemistry\n  \u2022 Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\n  \u2022 Cell Biology\n\nCite this",

A Student Guide to Archaeological Analyses, Oxford: Blackwell 2006, in: sehepunkte 9 (2009), Nr. 6 [15.06.2009], URL:\n\nBitte geben Sie beim Zitieren dieser Rezension die exakte URL und das Datum Ihres Besuchs dieser Online-Adresse an.\n\nJane Balme \/ Alistair Paterson (eds.): Archaeology in Practice\n\nTextgr\u00f6\u00dfe: A A A\n\nWith no statistics to back my words, I will venture to say that in the past 20 years the number of archaeology books published has increased considerably, in a way that few other branches of learning can boast. Not that this is entirely a reason to rejoice.\n\nOn the one hand, the causes for this phenomenon have little to do with more\/better research being carried out, but rather with the fact that archaeology was until now lagging behind older disciplines anyway, with more aggressive financial strategies on part of the publishers and more rescue excavations being routinely done, the \"Indiana Jones\"-movies, etc. Archaeology sells, and because of that, it seems to be par excellence the science in which all books are introductory, colourful companions, manuals, great discoveries in great photos - any step beyond this, apparently, risking to alienate the public. It is of course great that larger audiences are attracted by archaeology, but I wonder if the quality of this attraction, as nurtured by a proliferation of general, sometimes gaudy, books, will give archaeology the chance to be understood by the public on a profound level. Rather, what happens is that none of the humanities is now more threatened with commodification.\n\n\"Archaeology in practice\" is, granted, nothing of this sort - it is a collection of solid, if introductory, articles on several fundamental aspects of field and post excavation work, written mainly by Australian and British specialists. Nevertheless, given its general character, it is no surprise that it finds its niche already occupied. P. Bahn \/ C. Renfrew's Archaeology, theories, methods and practice, which gets a new edition every four odd years since 1991, L. Ellis's Archaeological method and theory (1999), J. Bintliff's Companion to archaeology (2004) and H. Maschner \/ C. Chippindale's Handbook Of Archaeological Methods (2005) already cover, with connoisseurship and panache, everything I seem to be able to find in Balme\/Paterson's book.\n\nThe editors propose, as they state in the preface, a series of 15 essays on how archaeological materials are used to answer research questions and on what the archaeologists do with the evidence, rather than how they obtain it in the field. However, what brings together these essays (which do include shell, bone, stone analysis, but also stratigraphy, historical sources and consulting stakeholders) is less clear. Why does rock art deserve a special chapter, which introduces concepts such as style and symbolic systems, and not, for example, terra sigillata or bronze age hearth typology? As happens more often than not, if the theme is not strictly circumscribed, the more articles or topics the editors struggle to include to make the volume more \"comprehensive\", the more those which have not been included stand out.\n\nA. David's essay on \"Finding sites\" (remote sensing, field and geophysical methods - GPR, resistivity, magnetometry etc) is welcome since the field is advancing literally every day and, while a new article of Phidias every month would be futile, any contribution on non-invasive archaeological techniques is ever more accurate than the previous; especially valuable (i.e. up-to-date), pp. 26-30 on underwater sensing. David's candid treatment of surveying, on the other hand, doesn't do justice to the many subtleties of the topic, especially in the interpretation of data (e.g. S. Alcock \/ J. Cherry, Side by Side Survey, 2004). Additions to the bibliography range from matters of detail (J. M. Rivers et al, Investigation into the Origin of Magnetic Soils on the Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee, Soil Science Society of the America Journal, 2004), to S. Parcak's recent Satellite Remote Sensing for Archaeology (2009). There is always, I think, some sort of hunger on the part of the reader after reading a chapter on remote sensing, to \"go dig them ghost features on that map\"; it would be, therefore, commendable on the part of any author if such methods were advocated particularly for rescue excavations, where they can help the most, and not convey the impression that we are in a dire need to find new sites to excavate.\n\nThe editors' own chapter on stratigraphy is one of the least rewarding in the volume. \"Stratigraphy is [...] the interpretation of horizontal layers that form the deposits of a site\" (96), \"many cultural layers such as walls are horizontal rather than vertical\" (99), in the cross section not only units and interfaces, but also the features get numbers (107). Excavating in artificial units receives only a mild critique at p.104. When it comes to recording, things are downright wrong: \"colour and texture of each layer have to be described in everyday language\" (105), or blissfully innocent: first you record the stratification, and then you interpret it (106). No use or mention is made to the authoritative five volumes of the \"Interpreting stratigraphy\" conferences (1991-2000).\n\nS. Holdaway's substantial chapter on \"Absolute dating\", despite the dry title, is the book's main asset. Few archaeologists can pretend they don't care about how their material dates, and even if this does not mean we have to do accelerator mass spectrometry ourselves, it is always good to know what language the lab people actually speak. The overview of dating techniques is alert and all-encompassing, with, however, the most thought provoking part being the discussion on pp. 129-139 on what time and date actually mean in archaeology. This treatment owes much to A. Ramenofsky's underrated work on units in archaeology (1998), Husserlian in her assumption that the subject is a time generating element. Holdaway does not refrain from also touching on the Pompeii premise (L. Binford), fidelity and resolution (A. Behrensmeyer), time averaged sites (N. Stern), scope and microstratigraphic acuity (D.E. Schindel), autocorrelation (S. Holdaway and N. Porch), and time perspectivism (G.N. Bailey).\n\nA chapter on stone artifact analysis (C. Clarkson, S. O'Connor) elegantly moves from discussion of classification and assemblages to Hertzian cones and outrepass\u00e9 terminations and opens the way for a series of straightforward chapters (7-11) on archaeological analyses: residues and usewear (p. 210 procedure for looking at stone tools, p.216-218 plant residues - starch, raphides, phytoliths, resins), and then ceramics (in L. Ellis's competent manner; note at p.251 the \"object condition and examination report\"). The animal bones chapter shares the latter cautionary tales about how the best way to analyze something always depends on what you want to find out, and with the plant remains chapter the emphasis on the need for reference collections (on site even!). S. Bowdler's \"Mollusks and other Shells\" is the closest these essays get to the issue of sampling, referred to en passant but never acknowledged for the enormously complex topic it is. (Orton's Cambridge manual from 2000 is here unsurpassed). I should say at this point that what the book could have included with great benefit would have been chapters on sampling, formation processes and recording in the field.\n\nA chapter on the use of historical sources seems to fall outside the subject of the book and offers few other compensations for that (\"Create a plan, but be flexible\" (391). \"Read with a critical eye\" (392). \"Critical thinking requires an open mind\" (393)). The same goes for the concluding essay, \"Producing the record\", a title which sounds fiercely post-processual (so now the archaeologists actually produce the archaelogical record!), but turns out to produce tips for writing reports - with ideas that would nonplus any post-processual author: \"separate actions from thought, discoveries from deduction\" (p 412), and anyone with methodological concerns: the method part of the report \"should be obvious: say [...] where did you survey?, how much did you dig?\" (413).\n\nAs an aside, it is striking how bibliographies of these essays follow the general trend by banishing practically all contributions that are not in English. Literature in English is vast and valuable, but I fail to see why we shouldn't also draw on traditional fields of excellence from other areas, such as German rescue excavations (Rheinland and Brandenburg), French underwater\/aerial archaeology and prehistoric stone technology, or Italian theoretical reflection (R. Francovich, D. Manacorda, E. Giannicheda).\n\nAll in all, the editors are modest in stating that this book only addresses \"higher undergraduate \/ lower graduate students\". It certainly offers new knowledge and case studies, and a lot of food for thought, albeit some of it because of interesting ideas, and some because of interesting mistakes.\n\nCatalin Pavel",

        "text":"Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate: Modeling, Fabrication, and Nonlinear-Optical Performance\n\n\nPeriodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) has become the nonlinear-optical material of choice in many infrared optical parametric oscillators (OPO's) due to its high nonlinearity, readily engineered tuning characteristics, and repeatable fabrication. The domain periods required for these OPO's are typically between 15 um and 30 um, and are made by a process already well developed. The domain periods required for visible light applications are typically between 3 um and 10 um, and are more difficult to fabricate repeatably. The focus of this research was to understand the nature of this difficulty, to develop strategies for repeatable device fabrication, and to demonstrate the nonlinear optical performance of the material.\n\nThis thesis presents a model of the periodic-poling process in lithium niobate, a repeatable PPLN-fabrication process developed using this model, and the nonlinear-optical performance of PPLN fabricated with this process. The model combines ferroelectric properties of the material, measured as part of this research, with the electrostatics of periodic electrodes. The fabrication process developed using the model was used to periodically pole two 75-mm-diameter wafers of 500-um-thick LiNbO3 with a 6.5 um domain period. These wafers yielded 53-mm-long samples, more than five times the length previously reported. Second harmonic generation experiments performed with these samples produced 2.7 watts of 532 nm radiation output with 6.5 watts of continuous-wave 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser radiation input, corresponding to a record 42% single-pass conversion efficiency. These samples were also used to operate the first reported continuous-wave 532-nm-pumped PPLN-based singly-resonant OPO, with a record-low 0.93-watt threshold (relative to other 532-nm-pumped OPO's), 56% conversion efficiency, and continuous tuning from 917-1266 nm. Finally, data are presented that indicate the presence of 532-nm-induced 1064-nm absorption.\n\n\nGregory David Miller\n\n\nJuly, 1998",

Our objectives were to report on a large cohort of pediatric patients presenting with penetrating thoracic trauma and to determine age-related impacts on management and outcome through comparison with an adult cohort.\n\nMETHODS: A Level I trauma center registry was queried between 2006 and 2012. All patients presenting with penetrating thoracic trauma were identified. Patient demographics, injury mechanism, injury severity, admission physiology, and outcome were recorded. Patients were compared, and outcomes were analyzed based on age at presentation, with patients 17 years or younger defining our pediatric cohort.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 1,423 patients with penetrating thoracic trauma were admitted during the study period. Two hundred twenty patients (15.5%) were pediatric, with 205 being adolescents (13\u201317 years) and 15 being children (\u226412 years). In terms of management for the pediatric population, tube thoracostomy alone was needed in 32.7% (72 of 220), whereas operative thoracic exploration was performed in 20.0% (44 of 220). Overall mortality was 13.6% (30 of 220). There was no significant difference between the pediatric and adult population with regard to injury mechanism or severity, need for therapeutic intervention, operative approach, use of emergency department thoracotomy, or outcome. Stepwise logistic regression failed to identify age as a predictor for the need for either therapeutic intervention or mortality between the two age groups as a whole. However, subgroup analysis revealed that being 12 years or younger (odds ratio, 3.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.29\u201311.4) was an independent predictor of mortality.\n\nCONCLUSION: Management of traumatic penetrating thoracic injuries in terms of the need for therapeutic intervention and operative approach was similar between the adult and pediatric populations. Mortality from penetrating thoracic trauma can be predicted based on injury severity, the use of emergency department thoracotomy, and admission physiology for adolescents and adults. Children may be at increased risk for poor outcome independent of injury severity.\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Epidemiologic study, level III.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nFrom the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (N.M.M., T.K.V.), Department of Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Divisions of Pediatric (R.M.A.), General (D.T.), Trauma (G.J.M.), and Cardiothoracic (M.G.M.)

Ken\u014dsis in sexuality. Verbum Eccles. (Online) [online]. 2013, vol.34, n.1, pp.30-36. ISSN 2074-7705.\n\nRecent decades have witnessed both a shift in sexual standards, and the loss of the Biblical authority which has traditionally motivated them. This has been the case even with Christians. It is therefore necessary to suggest a new motive for morality, especially in this area. A possibility is the idea of the imitation of Christ, adopting the principles on which he acted, which can be summed up as ken\u00f5sis, or self-limitation. Jesus was fundamentally limited through being incarnate; human beings are likewise limited, also with regard to their sexuality. Jesus adopted the practice of self-limitation, seen in his humility; Christians, in imitation of him, likewise should practise self-limitation. Indeed, the manifestation and practice of sexuality is fundamentally limited in any case by its very nature. If the principle of ken\u00f5sis is applied in the areas of marriage and divorce, and in related issues such as homosexuality or chastity, it serves to underpin what is a traditional set of practices in a way consistent with a Christian world-view.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7 text in English \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7 English ( pdf )\n\n\nCreative Commons License\u00a0All the contents of this journal, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License",

In addition, this study demonstrates that patients with sleep apnea and associated hypoxemia have poorer cognitive functioning than such patients without hypoxemia. The hypoxemic patients with sleep apnea had a significantly greater number of performance scores in the impaired range than patients without hypoxemia. Finally, the degree of hypoxemia during the awake and sleeping states was significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea.\n\nHypoxemia during both wakefulness and sleep may cause a disruption in the biochemical and hemodynamic state of the central nervous system. Hypoxemia markedly affects central neurotransmitter function and brain adenosine levels in animals. Hypoxemia and hypercapnia also significantly increase cerebral blood flow in humans. Given such disruptions in the central nervous system, it is not surprising that previous investigators have found an association of hypoxemia with cognitive dysfunction in humans at high altitudes and in patients with severe COPD.\n\nPrevious investigators have found hypoxemia to be associated with impaired cognitive functioning in humans. Poor judgment, decreased memory, and impaired ability to perform complex tasks have been described in humans at high altitude.The severity of these impaired cognitive functions is said to be related to the subjects lowered PaO2 Other investigators have found cognitive function to be impaired in hypoxemic patients with COPD.

Nocturnal hypoxemia was not examined in these studies at high altitude or with chronic pulmonary disease.\n\nTwo previous studies have described cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea. One study reported significant relationships between cognitive performance and sleep-related respiratory disturbances in 41 elderly men. Impairment of visuospacial reasoning, memory, and psychomotor speed were positively correlated with the numbers of disturbed breathing events during sleep. The second study demonstrated cognitive impairment in 76 percent of patients with severe sleep apnea. These patients had deficits in thinking, perception, memory, communication, and the ability to learn new information. The 76 percent rate of cognitive impairment in these patients is similar to the 89 percent rate found in the hypoxemic patients with obstructive sleep apnea in our study. Although the authors of each of these two studies suggested that associated hypoxemia was an important cause of cognitive impairments, measurements of hypoxemia during the sleeping and awake states were either not reported or qualitatively described in these studies. In addition, sleep architecture and sleep fragmentation were not analyzed in relation to cognitive impairment in these studies.

The multiple awakenings and movement arousals caused by apneas and hypoxemia fragmented the sleep of hypoxemic patients with obstructive sleep apnea; however, this disruption of sleep did not significantly correlate with overall cognitive impairment in our patients with sleep apnea. In addition, the percentage of total sleep time in stages 3 and 4 sleep and the number of desaturations per hour of sleep were not significantly related with overall cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea. The lack of significant linear correlation between variables reflecting sleep fragmentation and overall cognitive impairment does not exclude a role of sleep fragmentation in producing cognitive impairment. Both groups of patients have marked sleep fragmentation, and a threshold effect could be present. Sleep fragmentation, nocturnal hypoxemia, and sleep deprivation can produce daytime somnolence, and daytime somnolence is a potential mechanism of cognitive impairment in patients with sleep apnea. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of sleep fragmentation in impairing cognitive functioning.\n\nAlthough this study shows statistically significant correlations between overall cognitive impairment and measures of both awake and sleeping hypoxemia, no direct role of hypoxemia as a cause of cognitive dysfunction is proven. In addition, the high correlations among median Sa02 during sleep and awake Pa02 do not allow separation between effects of awake and sleeping hypoxemia upon cognitive functioning. Further studies using either daytime or nocturnal oxygen supplementation may help to define the relative importance of awake and sleeping hypoxemia in maintaining cognitive functioning in patients with sleep apnea.\n\nOnline Pharmacy",

From the mid-1950s to 1986, almost 69 million acres of natural habitat was converted to urban or suburban areas (Grey and Deneke, 1986). From 2000 to 2010, urban (urban + suburban) area in the United States increased by 12% each year (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). In 2012, over 80% of the U.S. population lived in urban areas (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Construction of homes and buildings often leads to a loss of natural vegetation (Blubaugh et al., 2011), which is often replaced with turfgrass systems (Tallamy, 2007). Public policies and local housing regulations impose guidelines to maintain aesthetic property values, which often influence homeowners\u2019 needs to maintain lawns (Jenkins, 1994). However, arguably the most influential is the social pressure from neighbors who often ensure enforcement of lawn regulations, to which homeowners often conform (Byrne, 2005).\n\nThere are an estimated 40 million acres of nonnative grass lawns in the United States, covering almost 2% of land, making it the largest irrigated monoculture plant system in the country (Milesi et al., 2005; Tallamy, 2007). Lawns are often high-input systems, requiring significant amounts of time, monetary, and chemical investments to maintain aesthetic property value (Robbins et al., 2001). The prevalence of turf cover throughout the United States and a low tolerance for weed and insect pests coincides with an increase in the use of synthetic chemicals (Alumai et al., 2008). Conventional lawn management strategies are calendar-based applications of synthetic chemical inputs of fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides (Alumai et al., 2008; Bormann et al., 1993) and have been associated with environmental pollution and human health risks [Robbins and Sharp, 2003a; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 1999]. As a result, strategies using integrated pest management (IPM) or \u201corganic\u201d practices have garnered increased attention as management alternatives (Alumai et al., 2008).\n\nSome individual consumers and public institutions have adopted alternative lawn management strategies, which have been promoted as a way to prevent potential negative environmental consequences of the overuse or misuse of pesticides (Henderson et al., 1998). The growing interest in lawn management alternatives has led to changes in public policies which ban the use of cosmetic pesticide applications and favor the adoption of lawn alternatives (Vickers, 2006), including organically managed green spaces (Alumai et al., 2008).\n\nAlthough organic management programs are offered as an alternative to traditional lawn care, their impact on arthropod diversity and pest management is poorly understood. A goal of commercial IPM or organic management is to enhance the overall aesthetic quality of lawns, which includes suppression of pests that invade turf (Alumai et al., 2008). Since little is known about the effects of organic lawn management on arthropod communities, this article reviews literature pertinent to organic lawn care, highlighting studies that have assessed the effects of turf variety and management practices on insect communities. To put this information into context, the article begins with an assessment of what organic lawn management means and the history of public policy regarding its implementation in North America.\n\nDefining Organic Lawn Management\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines organic agriculture as \u201c\u2026 an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, and enhance ecological harmony\u201d (USDA, 1995). The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) administers and publishes organic regulations with input from the public and the National Organic Standards Board. Before being certified as organic, farms must undergo a 3-year transition period in which organic production practices are followed, and documentation must be provided that no unapproved products or practices were used in the production system. Producers must then submit an application and fees to a USDA-accredited certifying agent (state departments of agriculture or private organizations). After an on-site inspection and review of the application indicate the producer is in compliance with USDA organic regulations, the certifying agent will issue an organic certificate. Producers are required to provide annual updates to the certifying agent, who performs an annual inspection to ensure USDA regulations are still being met.\n\nExcept for cases where turf is grown commercially for sod or seed production, lawns are not agricultural commodities and so their management is not regulated other than by local municipal and homeowner association aesthetic rules. Because there has been no groundswell of support for consistent definitions of organic lawn management and accompanying regulations like for agricultural commodities, there is no national definition or regulation of organic lawn care. This article refers to organic lawn management with the understanding that there are many varying definitions.\n\nRelevant Public Policy in North America\n\nGrassroots organizations throughout North America are pushing institutions as well as local and regional governments to restrict the use of pesticides and adopt organic or similar management policies for public spaces. These changes are being made primarily because of perceived public health concerns, even though the conse... (truncated)",
