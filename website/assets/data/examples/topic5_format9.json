        "text":"Your smartphone is so smart it takes 14 gadgets and $1,200 to match it\n\nYour smartphone is so smart it takes 14 gadgets and $1,200 to match it\n\nEver wondered how much it would cost you to replicate the functionality of today\u2019s smartphones with a collection of standalone gadgets? I picked out the main functions and apps of my iPhone 4S and tried to find approximate replacements for each of them on Amazon.\u00a0The total bill came to $1,228.11, and the devices collectively weighed more than eight pounds.\n\nToday\u2019s smartphone, be it an iPhone, Android or Windows Phone, is arguably the most versatile and functional tool we\u2019ve ever used. The \u201cThere\u2019s an app for that\u201d slogan has become a reality. Meanwhile, most of my other devices are left collecting dust, as I\u2019m usually content just going out with a phone, keys and a wallet.\n\nYou should know this is a completely un-scientific process, but it\u2019s meant to be a rough approximation of how an average consumer would shop if looking for each of these gadgets. Of course, some functionalities will be duplicated across multiple devices, but that\u2019s kind of the point here.\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free\nSamsung A107\u2013 $34.95, 2.6 ounces\n\nWhat\u2019s a smartphone without its phone functionality? \u201cAT&T circa 2009\u201d. I kid, I kid. Anyway, I picked out a no-fuss Samsung flip-phone, though it does get bonus points for coming with a color display, SMS and Organizer.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free\n16GB iPod nano\u00a0\u2013 $139, 1 ounce\n\nSure, you could go with the shuffle, but the controls are infuriating, so I chose the iPod nano. It\u2019s $149\u00a0if you buy it from Apple, but you can save $10 over at Amazon.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free (8mp, 1080p video)\nCanon PowerShot ELPH 510 HS\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$162.92, 7 ounces\n\nThis Canon point-and-shoot actually has 12.1 megapixels, and I\u2019m told that it would perform better in low-light, but this is a close match. My phone\u2019s camera is now my main camera, though I will switch to a DLSR if I\u2019m shooting for print or in tricky lighting. The fact that I always have my phone on me is one reason for the switch, the other is that I can email off shots right away. If you want Wi-Fi on your standalone camera, you could buy the 10.1-megapixel\u00a0Canon PowerShot ELPH 530 HS, but it\u2019ll set you back $266.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free, Maps\nGarmin n\u00fcvi 1350LMT\u00a0\u2013 $115.68, 1 pound\n\nThis matchup isn\u2019t completely fair since Garmin offers its GPS service, but you have to pull down Maps info over Wi-Fi and cellular data.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free, Clock\nAdvance Time Technology LED 6-Inch Alarm Clock\u00a0\u2013 $9.49, 6.4 ounces\n\nTechnically, Apple\u2019s built-in Clock app also has a stopwatch, but I use the alarm feature everyday.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free, Flashlight \u24c4\u00a0by Handysoft\n3 Watt LED Flashlight\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$6.75, 3 ounces\n\nI actually use this Flashlight app quite frequently. I also take comfort in the SOS feature which will flash the morse code emergency signal. You never know when that might be of use.\n\n\nCalculator \/\u00a0Spreadsheets\n\niPhone \u2013 $9.99, Numbers\nTexas Instruments TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculator\u00a0\u2013 $108.25, 13 ounces\n\nThis feature was tough to match up. Apple\u2019s Numbers app still needs some work, but it\u2019s quite advanced, so I decided to pair it up against this graphing calculator.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 $20, assorted\nNintendo DSi\u00a0\u2013 $124 (+ cost of games), 7.5 ounces\n\nApp-based gaming has developed enough that I leave my Nintendo DS and PSP at home. There are enough free games out there to keep you occupied, but I estimate that a $20 investment in some of the best paid games is enough to compete with dedicated gaming devices. Of course, you\u2019ll still want the latest handhelds if you\u2019re a heavy gamer, since you still can\u2019t get some of the most popular franchises on smartphones. You\u2019ll definitely be paying a premium for it though.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free, iBooks or Kindle for iPhone\nKindle Wi-Fi with Special Offers\u00a0\u2013 $79, 6 ounces\n\nI\u2019m not trying to weigh in here on the e-ink debate, I just chose the cheapest Kindle device. People who do a lot of traveling, reading outside, or just read a lot will probably prefer having a separate e-reader, or a book, but I\u2019m happy just reading on my iPhone most of the time.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 $9.99, Guitar Toolkit\nKorg CA-40 Chromatic Tuner\u00a0\u2013 $17.82, 3 ounces\n\nThis is kind of specialized, since not all of you play guitar. I had to mention this, though, because always having a guitar tuner on hand is very convenient.\n\n\nVoice recorder\n\niPhone \u2013 $4.99, Garage Band\nOlympus VN-702PC\u2013\u00a0$41.27, 2.6 ounces\n\nThe free Voice Memo feature on the iPhone is handy enough as is, but I also use GarageBand for quick song ideas or noodling around.\n\n\n\niPhone, free (or $14.99 for optical character recognition), Pleco\nAM103 English Chinese Dictionary Translator\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$129.99, 4 ounces\n\nElectronic dictionaries are in danger of being rendered obsolete by our phones. When I need help reading Chinese while out in the real world, Pleco\u2019s $14.99 optical character recognition add-on is a lifesaver. The dictionaries on the free version work for most of my needs, though diligent language students might want to spring for a bundle.\n\n\n\niPhone \u2013 free, Remote\nApple Remote\u2013 $19.00, 2 ounces\n\nCan\u2019t say that I use the Remote app a lot, but it\u2019s a nifty feature to have on hand.\n\n\nVOIP \/ Video calls\n\niPhone \u2013 free, Skype and FaceTime\nVoSKY Touch Videophone\u00a0\u2013 $239.99, 4 pounds\n\nThe VoSKY videophone supports Skype calls. It\u2019s a bit overkill here, since it has a 7-inch screen and weighs 4 pounds, but it was one of the few devices I could find on Amazon that had Skype and video integration.\n\nImages via Flickr \/\u00a0chippycheeky, Amazon, Apple\n\nFurther reading:\n\n8 Things Your Phone Will (Probably) Replace\n\nThe Best Mobile Accessories of 2012 So Far\n\nRead next: Eclectic Method: On copyright, codecs and video mixing performances on iPads\n\nHere's some more distraction",

        "text":"8 factors to consider while buying a TV\n\nIf you are looking forward to buying a new TV here are eight things you should look out for.\n\nBy Nilakshi Pathak\n\n    Everyone wants to have a big TV in their house. But the point is, having a big TV is not enough because it might not work for you. Here are the eight factors that you should consider while buying a TV.\n\n    Check the minimum viewing distance\n\n    Just because you are getting a large TV at a low price doesn't mean that you should buy it. You should take care of the minimum viewing distance. Measure the room and buy a TV according to it. Don't buy an LED TV that is below 32 inches. You can go for bigger size depending on the size of your room.\n\n    Go for full HD TVs\n\n    Do not go for 720p HD Ready TV; it has become a thing of the past now. Increase your budget a bit and go for Full HD TVs that flaunts 1080p.\n\n    What should you choose between smart features and size?\n\n    You might be presented with a small TV with many smart features in one hand and a simple big TV in another hand. What should you opt for? Well, TV is meant for watching TV shows and movies, you don't need to have many features for it. And you should note that you will always enjoy a bigger screen.\n\n    Why are you buying a TV?\n\n    It is advised that you know the purpose of buying a TV. What are you going to do with a TV? Depending on your content that you need, you will have to buy your TV. For example, if you only watch the movie, you can ditch the functions and go to a bigger screen. If you will be watching movies from a flash drive, then you will need a TV that can support almost all the popular file formats.\n\n    Check the audio quality\n\n    Having a good picture quality will not be enough if the audio quality of the TV is not good. If you are buying a large TV, go for a sound bar along with it. Or you can go far a decent channel bar.\n\n\n    If you are going to connect your TV to set-up boxes, then make sure your TV has all the essential connectivity ports like USB ports, 3.5mm audio jack, HDMI and other AV ports.\n\n    Don\u2019t buy a cheap 4K TV\n\n    If you are going to connect your TV to set-top boxes, then buying a 4K TV makes no sense. Instead of buying a cheap 4K TV, save a bit of money and go for expensive television if you want to enhance your TV watching experience.\n\n    8 Ways To Make Your iPhone Battery Last Longer!\n    Don\u2019t get fooled by the \u2018smart\u2019 tag\n\n    Don\u2019t get fooled by the \u2018smart\u2019 tag\n\n    There are plenty of cheap Android televisions on the market, and people fall for such smart TV. Though there are plenty of Android TV options available out there at a dirt cheap price. But buying an Android TV on a tight budget makes no sense because it might ruin the entire experience.\n\n    Wrap Up\n\n    When you hit the store to buy a TV, make sure that you keep the above eight factors in mind to have a pleasant experience while watching TV.\n\n    Read More About: tv news\n    Opinion Poll\n\n    Stay updated with latest technology news & gadget reviews - Gizbot\n\n    We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

        "text":"Recommended Components #1\n\n[Note - this article is from the May, 1963 issue of Stereophile]\n\nMany readers have asked why we don't maintain a permanent listing in each issue of The Stereophile of those components that we feel to be the best available, with or without qualification.\n\nSo, we are following our readers' suggestion, and will list in each issue groups of components which, at publication time, we feel are ones from which our readers would be well advised to assemble their systems. The list will change from time to time, as new products appear, old ones are obsoleted, or manufacturers change their quality control standards. Components will be added to or dropped from the list without advance notice if we see adequate reason for doing so, but each change in the list will be explained in the magazine at the time the change is made.\n\nWe will also furnish, upon request from listed manufacturers, written permission to use their listing in connection with promotional activities, because we are just as anxious to see good components make money for their manufacturers as we are in directing our readers to them.\n\nWe cannot be responsible for the failure of systems using these components to perform as expected. All we can do is list in each group those components that we know to be intrinsically excellent.\n\nComponents listed here are categorized as follows:\n\nClass A\u2014Highest in price, quality, and prestige value.\nClass B\u2014Sonic quality about equal to Class A, but lower in cost.\nClass C\u2014Slightly lower-quality sound, but far better than average home hi-fi.\nClass D\u2014Good, musical sound, better than the average component system, but significantly less than the best sound available.\n\nIt is assumed that the buyer will select his loudspeakers on the basis of room size, acoustics, and personal preference, and will make the necessary system adjustments correctly. A speaker should be driven by the amplifier in its same quality class whose power capability meets or exceeds the speaker's needs. Speakers are listed in order of brilliance and efficiency; power amplifiers are listed within each category in order in increasing power output.\n\nSome unlisted components may well provide equivalent quality in the categories listed above, but buyers will choose unlisted ones at their own risk. The list contains only components that we know to be outstanding in their categories.\n\nA: Thorens TD-124\nB, C: Garrard 301 or Gray PK-33 (footnote 1)\nD: Garrard Type A\n\nA: SME 3009-2\nB, C: Weathers Universal\nD: Garrard (above)\n\nCartridges (footnote 2)\nA, B: Weathers PS-11\nC: Weathers LDM\nD: Audio Dynamics ADC-2\n\nTape Recorders\nA: Ampex 350-2 (footnote 3) or Ampex 354 (footnote 3)\nB: Ampex 605-3 (footnote 3) or Sony 777\nC: Sony CS-300 or DK-300 deck\nD: EICO RP-100 or Viking 86\n\nA: McIntosh 10FM or Scott 4310\nB, C: Dynaco FM-1\/FMX-3\nD: Pilot 28\n\nA, B: Sony C-37A, Neumann U-67\nC: B&O 100\nD: B&O 53\n\nA: Beyer DT-48\nB: E.J.

And that very DT48, dressed up in newer headband plastic and earpad foam, is now discontinued from active production this month, after a 75 year run. And while Beyerdynamic feverishly announces their \"88th anniversary\" celebration with a special edition of the DT770 headphone, their response to questions about the 75th anniversary of the DT48 reflect some sense of shame that I don't understand at all. Perhaps it has to do with who created it and for what purpose.\n\npopluhv's picture\n\nI wish Stereophile covers still looked like that!\n\ndalethorn's picture\n\nThey had some awesome covers.

Then you need 3 significant basic lenses, which will help you to increase the quality of your work.\n\nThese are a general purpose zoom lens, a macro lens and telephoto zoom lens.\n\ntelephoto zoom lens\n\nThe first of them, the general purpose zoom, is suitable for 35 mm format cameras, as well as for APS-C cameras and works perfect in 18-50 mm range. It is often used for universal images like landscapes and wide perspective shots.\n\nAPS-C camera lensThe macro lens is needed if you are shooting small and tiny objects, whose details cannot be captured easy. The perfect length is 50 mm f\/2.8 macro.\n\nAnother \u201cmust have\u201d in digital photography is the telephoto zoom lens, especially for moving objects. In case you need to make portraits or images, which are hard to focus, use telephoto zoom lens. The best usage is in range of 70-200 mm and don\u2019t forget the aperture must be of f\/4 or faster.\n\nPosted in: Digital Camera Accessories\n\nRSSComments (0)\n\nTrackback URL\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n0 Flares Twitter 0 Facebook 0 Google+ 0 Pin It Share 0 StumbleUpon 0 0 Flares \u00d7",

        "text":"4 Reasons to Switch to the Samsung Galaxy S10 \u2013 Fast Quick Answer\n\n4 Reasons to Switch to the Samsung Galaxy S10\n\nIf you are thinking of switching to a smart phone with larger screen, a bigger battery, and advanced technology, The Galaxy S10 has you covered.\n\nThe Korean technology giant lifted the lid on its new Galaxy S10 few months ago and it is one of their biggest updates in years. Here are some\u00a0reasons to make the Galaxy S10 your next smart phone.\n\n1 Infinity O display\n\nWhen iPhone X first came out, people laughed at the notch on the screen, the annoying black protrusion getting in the way of our photos and videos .They mocked it by calling it the \u201cstraight bangs\u201dscreen. Samsung completely avoided the notch. They extended the Galaxy S10\u2019s display to the edges by punching a hole out of the glass to house the front-facing camera.\u00a0Galaxy S10 has a lot more display than iPhone XS. To be exact, the S10 has a screen to body ratio of 88.3% compared to iPhone XS\u2019 82.9%. There\u2019s no doubt that without margins at the top or bottom, without home button or notch, Galaxy S10 will give you a better visual enjoyment.\n\n2 Bigger Battery & Wireless PowerShare\n\nYou must have the experience of looking for a charger or a power bank everywhere when you were outside. Therefore, people are looking for a mobile phone with large battery for the whole day. Galaxy S10 increase its\u00a0battery size for the larger display area. Compared to the iPhone XS\u2019 2658mAh, the new Galaxy S10 comes with a much larger 3400 battery.\n\nThe new technology of Wireless Power Share will definitely impress your friends when their smart phones are running out of battery, and your S10 shows up to charge them.\n\n3 The future of 5G\n\n5G, the 5th generation mobile network, is going to show up in our daily life soon. Offering faster speeds and more reliable connections on smart phones and other devices than ever before, 5G will definitely cause the upgrade of mobile phones. Samsung\u00a0is one of the mobile phone companies first launches devices that can incorporate a 5G-ready antenna.\n\n4Triple-lens camera\n\nGalaxy S10\u00a0has 3 rear cameras and 1 front camera. The three cameras on the back are 12MP Telephoto Camera, 12MP Wide-angle Camera and 16MP Ultra Wide Camera. With these three cameras, you can shoot with 2x optical zoom. If you are a shutterbug, Galaxy S10\u00a0will be a perfect option to you.\n\nPosted on July 30, 2019",

        "text":"Using what little extra money we had saved up from the holidays, we began looking almost immediately for ways to spend it on things we definitely don\u2019t need. But holy god do we want them. Once we devoted a healthy portion of our disposable income to our favorite shirts and jackets, we moved beyond the world of menswear and into the ephemeral world of gadgets.\n\nWhat we found includes new devices from heavyweights like Logitech and Nike, but also smaller companies who\u2019s young ambition and ideas we gave equal weight to. Take a look below for all 10.\n\n\nAedle VK-1 Headphones\n\nWe first came across these VK-1 headphones from French brand Aedle on Selectism, our refined sister site. With the VK-1, premium materials come together with high-performance titanium transducers for a pair of headphones that blow any other stylish pair out of the water. The first batch ships this month but is unfortunately already sold out. In any case, head to their site to sign up for the next limited shipment.\n\n\nLehmann LA100\n\nFor a true bird\u2019s-eye view of the world look no further than the LA100 from Lehmann Aviation. The unmanned aircraft soars up to 300 feet in the air to take pictures of the ground below. All that\u2019s required for operation is plugging the battery in and launching it. Unfortunately the GoPro is not included but you can head over to Lehmann\u2019s site to buy your own unmanned craft.\n\n\nLogitech Ultrathin iPad Mini Case\n\nOur office\u2019s iPad Mini has been keeping us busy and distracted the past few weeks and has indirectly led to at least 3 physical fights here at Highsnobiety HQ. That said, a solid case could come in handy right about now. We recently came across Logitech\u2019s latest offering which combines a protective magnetic case with a keyboard. Sounds perfect for our needs.\n\n\n\nYeah this one isn\u2019t technically a gadget but it\u2019s so cool and so close to being a gadget that we had to include it. Photographer Chris McVeigh came through on this one and promised to upload building instructions shortly.

They\u2019re like the Big Foot of technology. Perhaps that\u2019s a testament to the type of people we hang out with more than anything else, but in any case a few 3d printers have allegedly come to the market and at reasonable prices to boot.

        "text":"Top Problems of Six Popular Smartphones By FixYa\n\nShare the joy\n\nIn the constantly growing battle of smartphones, Fixya is concerned with letting users know more about the device they are investing in. In its initial Fixya Smartphone Report, it gathered data by tracking its 25 million users and 15 million product problems and solutions on its Q&A site. It scored the common problems encountered by users of six of the most famous smartphones: iPhone 4S, Samsung Galaxy SIII, HTC Titan II, RIM Blackberry Curve, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and Nokia Lumia 900.\n\nFixya CEO Yaniv Bensadon said that \u201c\u2026 with all the buzz that surrounds new smartphone releases, it is becoming increasingly important for consumers to see through the hype and understand the devices they are investing in\u2026\u201d He adds that \u201cthe Fixya Smartphone Report reveals which devices have the edge and where even the top dogs struggle in the constantly evolving battle between iOS, Android, and their competition.\u201d\n\nHere is a list of the most popular smart phones and their top problems.\n\niPhone 4S\n\nFixya reported that 45% of its customers using iPhone4S complain about the battery life. It cited that iPhone 4S is a power hungry device that comes with a multitude of features.\n\nFor iPhone 4S users, battery life is their primary complain. (Image: Christyam (CC) via Flickr)\n\nAccording to the report, iPhone 4S users continue to find problems with the battery life even with Apple\u2019s iOS update. Keeping the iPhone at room temperature when not in use may help save battery life.\n\nProlonged charging of the phone at 100% may weaken its battery power. It is advisable to use the provided wall charger when charging rather than the computer-connected USB cable. Turning off location services, Siri, and push notifications also help extend battery life. WiFi and Bluetooth must be turned on only when in use. Set screen brightness at low level and select manual fetching of email to minimize battery work.\n\nOther user complains for iPhone 4S: WiFi connection \u2013 20%, Bluetooth connection \u2013 15%, Siri complaint \u2013 10%, and others \u2013 10%.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S III\n\nBehind its smooth and fun experience, Galaxy S3 owners seem to be cutting out with issues. Microphone malfunction is the most common problem of device owners. FixYa accounts 50% of the total Galaxy S3 complains falls on this category. The phone usually loses signal strength for quite a time after hanging up, which causes users not to be able to hear the person on the other line. This strange bug is pointed by FixYa as the obvious cause of complications during a phone call.\n\nGalaxy S3 users complain about microphone malfunction. (Image: Stereopoly blog (CC) via Flickr)\n\nThis may be fixed by restarting the phone. If the problem continues, update the firmware by connecting to a WiFi and following the steps: Click Settings ? About Device ? enter Software Update. If an update is available, click Update.\n\nIf the glitch is not solved with the update, restoring the device to its factory setting is the last resort. Do the following: Connect device to a computer to back up data ? Click Settings ? Back Up and Reset ? Factory Data Reset ? Reset Device ? Erase Everything. The phone will be cleaned and the malfunctions will stop.\n\nOther complains for Samsung Galaxy S III: Battery life \u2013 15%, Device getting hot \u2013 15%, Internet connection issues \u2013 10%, and Others \u2013 10%.\n\nHTC Titan II\n\nHTC\u2019s attempt to rush Windows\u2019 development into the smartphone market has failed when it released Titan II nearly six months after the first Titan. Introducing a bigger screen is unfortunate for HTC, says FixYa. 35% of Titan II owners who come to FixYa complain about the screen resolution. The quality of videos and applications is not worth the $200 price tag, users claim. Moreover, 20% of FixYa customers whine about not finding applications they see on Apple and Android Marketplace.\n\nHTC Titan 2 users complain about the screen resolution. (Image: GSMGuru (CC) via Flickr)\n\nUnluckily for Titan II users, the issue about the screen resolution has no manual solution. The problem is dealing with its hardware and not merely software issues. Enlarging the size of the screen is not beneficial since Microsoft limits the screen resolution of its phones to 800 by 480. Hence, Titan II is not made for users who watch videos and use apps heavily.\n\nTitan II users are also hard-pressed looking for apps. FixYa says Windows Marketplace is not in its height of inventory like Android and Apple are.\n\nOther problems complained by Titan II owners: Camera quality \u2013 15%, Battery life \u2013 15%, and Others \u2013 15%.\n\nRIM Blackberry Curve\n\nForty percent of Blackberry Curve users report the problem of random rebooting of the device for no apparent reason. Aside from being an interruption in business and emailing, it is a major annoyance to the owners.\n\nRIM Blackberry Curve users complain about random rebooting\n\nThe problem is primarily caused by the memory card. To fix it, remove the memory card and battery and wait for 30 seconds before reinserting the battery. Backup your memory card files in a computer. From the computer, right-click the memory card folder and select Format then Start. After formatting, turn off the Curve and reinsert the memory card. This will either solve the glitch completely or reduce the instances of random rebooting. If none of the solutions take effect, device owner will have to buy a new memory card.\n\nOther complains: Software errors \u2013 20%, Missing applications \u2013 20%, Memory card error \u2013 10%, and Other \u2013 10%.\n\nGalaxy Nexus\n\nThe two main pandemic issues of Galaxy Nexus users are microphone malfunction (55% of total Nexus complains) and battery life (20%).\n\nMost Nexus 7 users complain about its microphone. (Image: Samsung_ua (CC) via Flickr)\n\nThe first issue is obviously a big deal since it restricts users from the phone\u2019s primary function \u2013 phone calls. To fix it, backup the entire phone\u2019s data to a computer and perform hard reset of the device. Go to Apps ? Settings ? Personal ? Click Backup and Reset ? Click Factory Data Reset. If the problem persists, either you can download Android 4.0.4 IMM76K radios, or AXIOM CMPLX 4.0.4.\n\nTo increase battery life, download the free app \u201cJuiceDefender\u201d; shut off phone and charge overnight; disable background app check-ins; surf internet via WiFi and not 4G as much as possible; set phone to sleep at the least time possible; disable Bluetooth; disable app auto-synch; turn off location settings.\n\nOther complains: Can\u2019t connect to WiFi \u2013 10%, General usability \u2013 10%, and Other \u2013 5%.\n\nNokia Lumia 900\n\nNokia Lumia 900 hit major consumer buzz because of its screen durability. The YouTube video \u201cNokia Lumia Screen 900 Hammer Test\u201d showed viewers how its screen can resist breaking with a nail being hammered on it. However, this durable screen has an odd purple tint which distracts 25% of FixYa users.\n\nNokia Lumia 900 users complain about odd purple tints in their screens. (Image: oliviawhitlach (CC) via Flickr)\n\nIn addition, twenty percent of users complain about the camera button which does not wake up the phone when attempting to launch camera app from powered off or standby mode. Another 20% complain about not finding applications which are available on other devices.\n\nNokia has gone through the purple tint bug and pushed an update to solve it. To get this update, plug the Lumia 900 to a computer and run Zune for Windows or Rune Windows Phone 7 Connector for Mac, grab the update and reboot the device.\n\nFor the phone to wake up with the camera button from powered off or standby mode, simply turn on the device and exit all the running apps. Go back to standby mode and hold the camera button, and the camera app will launch.\n\nShare the joy\n\nAuthor: Neal Alfie Lasta\n\nI enjoy learning and writing about social media and the latest in mobile updates.

This allows it to receive information from \u2014 and transmit information to \u2014 the internet. The router then creates and communicates with your home Wi-Fi network using built-in antennas.

The modem plugs into the Internet or Modem jack on the router.\n\nHow can I get free Internet at home without paying?\n\nThe FCC Lifeline program can provide reduced-cost or even free internet access.

However, if you want to roll with the big boys by brandishing your tablet's Apple logo then you need a really, really big penny jar.\n\nFor those who would rather impress the bank manager than strangers on public transport, there is a plethora of cheap non-branded tablet PCs flooding the market.\n\nSo are they any good? Is it worth saving a few pennies but (in some cases) gaining hours of frustration? Can you really skimp on major purchases like this? Well, we've assembled an unruly group of cheap misfit tablets and put them under the microscope. Here's what we found.\n\nAcer Iconia B1\n\nPrice: \u00a3100\/US$150\/AU$150\nScore: 3.5\/5\n\n5 budget tablets tested\n\nThe Acer Iconia B1 is the 7-inch pretender, the upstart, the promising intern - the tablet with stars in its eyes and a dual-core processor in its back pocket. It's a tablet that looks, feels and functions like a mid-range tablet such as the Google Nexus 7, iPad mini or Samsung Galaxy Note.\n\nIt's built to last but sacrifices on aesthetics. The solid black frame feels like it could survive a few rounds with one of the Klitschko brothers, but it also looks like it's had a few rounds with one of the Klitschko brothers. The border around the screen is unnecessarily thick and verges on intruding, which gives the tablet a cheaper overall look. The thick frame is probably the reason it weighs in at a whopping 789g (1.74lbs) - almost double that of the Nexus 7. A heavyweight in the truest sense of the word.\n\n5 budget tablets tested\n\nRunning Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2, the wannabe houses an ARM 1.2GHz dual-core processor, 512MB of DDR2 SDRAM and 8GB of onboard memory, with an SD card slot. Those are reasonable specs, but when you consider that the Acer Iconia B1 will cost \u00a3100 \/ US$150 \/ AU$150, it's a pretty solid deal.\n\nIt's quick, doesn't suffer from much lag and can happily play videos on Netflix and switch back to browsing without blowing up. The 1200 x 600 resolution, too, means you'll get a reasonably clear and sharp image.\n\n5 budget tablets tested\n\nThis is a device that's marketed to entry-level tablet users or kids, but in reality it's just fine for people who aren't looking to do anything too serious. If you want something to read books, watch some films and browse the internet on, but you're on a budget, this is probably the best sub option at this price point.\n\nIt doesn't come with the connectivity that other cheaper tablets in this list come with - much like the bigger brands, it's simply USB and headphone-jack. Everything else is wireless, which, in our opinion, isn't a plus point. A good reason to buy one of the cheaper, lesser-known brand tablets, is because of their ability to transform into more than just a tablet. With HDMI and multiple audio-out ports, your tablet can operate as an entertainment hub and a smart box for your TV.\n\n5 budget tablets tested\n\nQuick verdict\n\nThe Acer Iconia B1 is essentially at the high-end of the low-range tablets. It's bulky and isn't the most attractive tablet out there, but it does the job. The job being providing you with a quick, clear and rage-free tablet experience.",

        "text":"Top iPhone 5S Rumours\n\nApril 2, 2013\n\nThe iPhone 5 released just last quarter but the grapevine is already buzzing with rumours surrounding the next iPhone or the iPhone 5S. Check out some of the best rumours surrounding the next gen iPhone.\n\n1. iPhone 5S to Come with a Stylus\n\nThe internet has been abuzz with reports of the next iPhone coming with a stylus. While Apple reportedly filed patents for up to 3 variants of their new stylus, the pen might be used for their next generation of phones, the iPhone 5S. So far, it is Samsung that uses the stylus or the S Pen for their phablets, the Note series. This makes us wonder if Apple is coming out with a phablet too or will their Stylus be reserved for the iPhone 5S? If it is specifically for the iPhone 5S, then will the phone be larger? The screen size and the overall bezel? Also, this adds fuel to rumours of a smaller iPhone or perhaps a cheaper variant which will come without the stylus.\n\niphone 5s stylus\n\n2. \u00a0iPhone 5S to Come in Colours\n\nAfter Apple launched the iPod Touch 5th Generation in multiple colours, speculations began doing rounds of the iPhone 5S too coming in colours. According to analyst Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets, the latest generation of iPhone might come in not just a variety of colours but even different size options. If the news is true, Apple fans will have lots to rave about and a plethora of colour options to choose from. The new colourful iPod Touch has been a definite hit and looks like the success will carry over to iPhone 5S if the device is made available in multi-colour options.\n\niphone 5s colours\n\n3. iPhone 5S to Come with Fingerprint Unlocking\u00a0\n\nReports have suggested that Apple is working on a technology that let's users unlock their phones using just their finger-print.\u00a0Apple's plans for fingerprint recognition began last year when the iPhone maker bought biometric security firm AuthenTec for 235 million pounds. If the news is true, then this would be Apple's response to the\"face unlock\" technology provided by Android, considered by Apple to be its biggest rival and a lift off their iOS. Though the finger-print unlocking is definitely cool and adds a security layer it might be a little too late as Samsung introduced Eye Scrolling with their Samsung Galaxy S4. But the finger-print technology will definitely make your device safer! What if you accidently cut your thumb though?\u00a0\n\niphone 5s fingerprint unlocking\n\n4. iPhone 5S to Come with Wrap Around Display\n\nApple recently filed patents for a wrap-around display screen. This might mean that the next iPhone will come with a transparent two-way viewable screen. The wraparound text means the screen will be carried over the side bezels to the back of the phone too. If that part is true, we guess we can rule out rumour number 4 as the iPhone 5S will surely not come in colkours with wraparound text. We wonder how odd that will look! The patent filed by Apple\u00a0shows a phone similar to a flattened tube of glass, inside of which a display envelops the chips and circuit board.\n\niphone 5s wraparound\n\n5. One Killer Feature\n\nNews reports recently announced that the next iPhone or the iPhone 5S would come with 'One Killer Feature'. While last time \u00a0it was Siri that was the one killer feature, we wonder what will be the next one. An iPhone 5S that senses your thoughts perhaps? Or an iPhone 5S that comes not with fingerprint unlocking but rather with retina unlocking. Let Apple work on the 'killer' feature and we shall wait patiently till they decide to announce it. Fair enough?\n\niphone 5s\n\nTo Enjoy More Such Stories Like Us on Facebook and Follow Us on Twitter >\n\nBe a Part of The New & Next\n\n\n\n104,163 MEMBERS",

        "text":"2 August 2013 by\n\nHDTVs are contemporary television, and with standard definition almost phased out, Full HD is quite the only way to go. An HDTV not only supports but also displays true 720p and 1080p content. This must not be confused with an HD-Ready TV which has only the power to carry HD signals and then downscale them to SD video.\n\nThe HDTV resolutions seen today are generally 720p, 1080i and 1080p, where the i refers to interlaced scanning and p refers to progressive. While interlaced scanning means that the even and odd fields of pixel rows are displayed alternatively, progressive scanning means the even and odd fields are displayed simultaneously. Progressive scanning surpasses interlaced scanning in terms of picture quality and is predominantly the type of resolution used in current HDTVs. So the dilemma is really between 720p and 1080p. There is very limited amount of 1080p content to view as yet and everything is mostly 1080i or 720p, so a 1080p HDTV might only upconvert that into 1080p, and this quality is hardly better than the original form. Furthermore, a 1080p resolution is only worth shelling out for if you're going in for a large screen size of 60\"; in anything smaller than this, the difference in 1080p picture quality (PQ) and 720p is not really noticeable.\n\nSpeaking of screen size, HDTVs come in sizes as small as 27\" to as large as 90\" and you could freeze on the display appropriate for your TV room with this simple formula - Screen size = Viewing distance\/2.\n\nDepending on the type of panel and backlighting they use, HDTVs are available in three kinds: traditional LCD, Plasma and LED LCD.\n\nTraditional LCD TVs use Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFL) to backlight the display panel, and are on their way out. They're the cheapest of the lot, have the lowest PQ and have the shortest lifespan since the lamps tend to get worn out.\n\nLED LCD TVs use Light Emitting Diodes(LED) to light up the display panel and are often the most expensive. They have much better picture quality due to higher contrast ratios, quicker response times of 2 to 5 ms and also last longer. A low response time essentially means there won\u00c3\u00a2??t be any motion blur in action packed scenes\n\nIn a Plasma TV however, the plasma itself emits light and therefore there is no backlighting technology required. They have excellent contrast ratios, and a quick speed of 600 frames per second obviating any motion blur. Plasma TVs rival LED TVs for the top spot and while the best TVs for brightly lit room are LED TVs, plasma TVs steal the show when it comes to dark room performance.\n\nFor more information on each, visit our Best LED TVs , Best Plasma TVs , or Best LCD TVs page.\n\nToday's HDTV market is brimming with state-of-the-art offerings from audio features and sleek panels, to 3D and SmartTV; from leading brands like Panasonic, Samsung, LG and Sony.\n\nThe higher end SmartTV amenities include a Full web browser and Skype compatibility and gives you complete freedom on the internet, while lower end SmartTVs give you access to specific movie sites like Netflix to stream videos from. To learn more about 3D, we have a list of the best 3D TVs to guide your purchase.\n\nDisplayed below is our list of the best HDTVs and their ranking, defined by expert reviews.
