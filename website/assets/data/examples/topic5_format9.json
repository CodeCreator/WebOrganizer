        "text":"Ten of the Best Analog Mix Bus Processors Right Now\n\nAlthough plug-ins have come a long way in terms of sound quality, adding a pinch of analog fairy dust still is still something that is very much desired by anyone who values that real-electric mojo. A recurrent theme in this school of thought is mixbus processing -where an analog processor can help give a song that \u201cfinishing touch\u201d - and it gets used on both OTB and ITB productions with equal love, so we have gathered ten of the best mix bus processors to help you out in getting those mixes polished up to a pro standard. In alphabetical order:\n\n\nAnamod ATS-1\n\nOne of the sweetest treats one can offer to a mixbus is the analog tape sound - and one of the bitterest tricks is analog tape machine maintenance. The latter is not a problem with the ATS-1 - highly regarded by Gearslutz members, it features fundamental tape settings such as bias, variable speed (7.5\/15\/30 ips) and hiss amount, but perhaps its greatest feats are the four different machine models and four tape 'formulations' offered, which can be expanded on with user-installable add-on cards. Arguably this is the best way to achieve that coveted magnetic reel sound, and without all the hassles & expense usually associated with the format.\n\n\nBlack Box Analog Design HG-2\n\nBlack Box Analog Design crafted quite an imposing piece with the HG-2. This \u201cmixbus enhancing device\u201d is all about pure analog goodness, with transformers on the input stage and two parallel tube paths to add the richest saturation while at the same time raising perceived loudness. It also comes with an \u201cair\u201d switch for a gentle lift on the high end, different blending configurations for the 6U8A\/12AX7 valves and flexible metering (VU\/peak) to keep everything in check.\n\n\nelysia Karacter\n\nKaracter presents Elysia\u2019s take on saturation, a slick processor with an interesting \u201ccolor filtering\u201d feature, which allows the user to dial the tone of the saturation itself instead of simply using EQ to tilt the signal towards the highs or lows. Besides the stereo mode for the most common mixbus setup, Karacter can also operate in dual-mono and mid-side configurations, allowing for each part to be processed separately, making it a highly flexible unit that only takes a single rack space and doesn\u2019t burn a hole in your wallet.\n\n\nKERWAX Replica\n\nReplica takes a slice from a custom tube-based mixing console made exclusively for the KERWAX recording studio (located in Brittany\/France) and puts it in a 3U 19\u201d rack with two tubes and a premium analog signal path. Essentially this is a hand-made line preamp, but with a few extra goodies: besides the tasteful saturation Replica offers variable drive, preamp bias, treble\/bass adjustments, elegant VU meters and it\u2019s a dual-mono unit, so besides doing wonders on a mixbus it can be used on channels to enhance individual tracks.\n\n Silver Bullet\n\nLouder Than Liftoff Silver Bullet\n\nMade in partnership with industry veteran and fellow Gearslutz member drBill, the Silver Bullet\u2019s bold proposition is exactly what its name hints at: a one-stop solution to take a mix to the next level. This unit couples saturation from classic American and British consoles with a handful of tone shaping options, including a 2-band Baxandall EQ with options for 'bass or sub' and 'presence or air' enhancements, which should be excellent for treating individual channels, groups and whole mixes. Since it also comes with a couple of mic preamps it can be used for tracking, so it\u2019s definitely an enticing option for the modern day \u201cdo it all\u201d studio.\n\n Modular Channel Stereo Model 8755D\n\nOverstayer Modular Channel Stereo Model 8755D\n\nOverstayer makes a bold statement with the Model 8755D: an all-analog processing behemoth that puts together a complete channel strip for the mixbus - or any studio work - providing three saturation options, a 2-band shelving equalizer, resonant HP\/LP filters, a VCA compressor and two mic preamps. This channel strip also offers plenty of flexibility with options for the signal order and a mixer matrix that allows for serial or parallel routing, allowing for a number of different combinations. Certainly a great option for an all-rounder that can take care of a good mix (or basically anything you can throw at it!)\n\n Master Buss Processor\n\nRupert Neve Designs Master Buss Processor\n\nThe classy Portico II Master Bus Processor presents Rupert Neve\u2019s take on the stereo bus processing concept, bringing two flavours of saturation, compression with RMS or peak options and also an unique \u201cStereo Field Editor\u201d that allows for imaging adjustments through the \u201cDepth\u201d and \u201cWidth\u201d equalizers, which deploy advanced mid-side techniques to further enhance or adjust the stereo field of a mix. Add to that options for dual-mono or linked stereo operation, output and gain reduction meters on each channel and we have a highly capable unit with that signature Rupert Neve sound.\n\n\nSolid State Logic Fusion\n\nSSL needs no introduction, but they\u2019re breaking new ground with Fusion, a processor that presents features that are unprecedented for the company while keeping their proud analog heritage very much alive. Fusion brings a unique set of tools, starting with a custom switchable transformer (on an SSL?!!) for added mojo, followed by drive control, 2-band shelving EQ, a high-frequency compressor and lastly a stereo image section with a mid-side matrix. This is a very new product at the time of writing but it's got our members' tongues wagging - a few decades ago SSL set what many consider to be the standard blueprint for individual channel strips, have they done it again on the mixbus? We're about to find out!\n\n\nTegeler Audio Manufaktur Cr\u00e8me\n\nThe Tegeler Cr\u00e8me offers a compression and equalization recipe that will never get old or stop being useful on virtually any mixing task. This eye-catching unit brings a passive 2-band EQ inspired by the legendary Pultec EQP1A and a bus compressor that takes a few notes from a well-known classic mixing console, wrapping up with a gain reduction meter and a processing order (EQ-Comp\/Comp-EQ) switch. Cr\u00e8me also comes with a price tag that looks rather friendly, which helps to sweeten the whole deal and hopefully your mixes even further.\n\n The Culture Vulture Mastering Plus\n\nThermionic Culture The Culture Vulture Mastering Plus\n\nThermionik\u2019s Culture Vulture is a classic when it comes to valve saturation, and when used mindfully it can do wonders on a mixbus (although it can also be used to wreck things entirely when desired!) A \u201cmastering\u201d version (featured) of the Culture Vulture is also available, adding a new distortion option on top of the three original modes and it features closely matched controls to favour stereo operations, which makes it perfect for mixbus duties.\n\nClosing thoughts:\n\nAlthough we aimed to list units that can make a notable sonic difference on their own, many of them can be combined for superb results. Feel free to comment and elaborate on your dream combos!\n\nFor more on analog processors, visit our So Much Gear, So Little Time sub forum.",

        "text":"\n\nNobody likes wires. They\u2019re things we tolerate, necessities that are there to facilitate the parts of technology that are actually exciting.\n\nWith Bluetooth, though, some gadgets are able to bypass the tangled cords entirely. We\u2019ve tested and researched a ton of these accessories over the past year, and with the holiday season now upon us, we\u2019re ready to share our favorites. If you\u2019re looking for gear that\u2019ll feel more liberating \u2014 at least until its battery dies \u2014 here are some Bluetooth\u00a0gift options, and our top picks within them.\n\n\nue rollAmazon\n\nThe general quality of Bluetooth speakers has shot straight up over the last few years, and in many cases their inherent portability makes them more practical than the traditional alternatives. You can find more than a few very good ones for cheap, too.\n\nAmong those affordable options, I like the ultra-compact JBL Clip+ and its surprisingly strong sound for those on a very tight budget. The colorful and water-resistant UE Roll, meanwhile, is ideal\u00a0for showers or taking to the road.\n\nThe JBL Flip 3 isn\u2019t as outdoorsy, but it\u2019s the most well-rounded and overall best-sounding choice for less than $100. If you can afford to double that, though, the Bose SoundLink Mini II is superlative in both build and performance.\n\nAs for speakers made for the home, the Marshall Action can put out lots of noise for a relatively affordable $200, and I enjoy its classic guitar amp aesthetic. And if money\u2019s no object, the Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin Wireless is hands-down the most vivid Bluetooth speaker you can buy. That it looks like a miniature, well, zeppelin is likely to start a few conversations, too.\n\nJBL Clip+ (Orange), $39.95, available at Amazon.\nUE Roll (Blue), $69.99, available at Amazon.\nJBL Flip 3 (Black), $85.63, available at Amazon.\nBose SoundLink Mini II (Pearl), $199, available at Amazon.\nMarshall Action (Black), $219.95, available at Amazon.\nBowers & Wilkins Zeppelin Wireless, $699.98, available at Amazon.\n\n\nJabra Move WirelessAmazon\n\nAll other things equal, a pair of Bluetooth headphones still won\u2019t sound as nice as a wired equivalent most of the time \u2014 but again, the gap has noticeably lessened over time. Even then, the freer sense of movement that\u2019s present here might make any sonic deficiencies worth withstanding.\n\nWe\u2019ve laid out our favorites before, but in this market, the Jabra Move Wireless gets you a lively, bass-forward sound in a lightweight, comfortable frame. The Plantronics Backbeat Sense looks a bit slicker, with a clearer, more natural-sounding profile and tremendous battery life. The neckband-style looks of the Phiaton BT 100 NC may be weird, but the sound isn\u2019t, and the whole thing is as affordable as any quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones are going to get.\n\nAt the higher end, the V-Moda Crossfade Wireless is flashy, supremely sturdy, capable of working as a standard analog headphone when wired in, and fitted with a dynamic sound reminiscent of the popular Crossfade M-100.\n\nWireless headphones are naturally permissive to exercise, too. The Jaybird X2 get you the best blend of audio performance and durable, workout-friendly design. It also comes with a lifetime warranty for any sweat-related damages. Just be sure to watch Jaybird\u2019s tutorial on securing a good fit, first.\n\nJabra Move Wireless (Black), $65.61, available at Amazon.\nPlantronics Backbeat Sense (White), $134.99, available at Amazon.\nPhiaton BT 100 NC (Black), $99, available at Amazon.\nV-Moda Crossfade Wireless (Black), $299.98, available at Amazon.\nJaybird X2 (Black), $139, available at Amazon.\n\n\nplantronics voyager edgeAmazon\n\nBluetooth headsets, the kind made for quickly taking phone calls on the go, have fallen a bit out of vogue, but they can still have value to road warriors.\n\nThe Plantronics Voyager Edge, for instance, has been around for a couple of years, but has been widely commended for its stellar call quality and general ease of use. For a more basic, no-frills alternative, the Plantronics M55 can\u2019t match the Edge, but it\u2019s plenty respectable for $60 less.\n\nPlantronics Voyager Edge (Black), $79.85, available at Amazon.\nPlantronics M55 (Black), $30.99, available at Amazon.\n\n\npebble time steelAmazon\n\nDo you need a smartwatch? No. Does that make them useless? Not at all, provided you have an affinity for tech and a willingness to look a tad goofy in public.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to grab one, our favorite is still the Pebble Time Steel, which admittedly looks nerdy, but lasts far longer than any Android or Apple Watch alternatives, and has the one platform that acts more like a smarter watch than a dumber smartphone. If you want to save $100 bucks, the regular Pebble Time has a flimsier build, but functions in much the same way.\n\nPebble Time Steel (Gold), $199.99, available at Amazon.\nPebble Time (Black), $129.76, available at Amazon.\n\nFitness trackers\n\nfitbit charge hrAmazon\n\nAs with smartwatches, there\u2019s no such thing as a universally recommendable fitness tracker just yet. The closest thing you can get to a \u201cbest\u201d overall package, though, is the Fitbit Charge HR \u2014 it isn\u2019t outrageously expensive, but it is (relatively) accurate, its battery life is solid, it has heart-rate monitoring, and Fitbit\u2019s software suite is easy for most to read and process.\n\nA monocolor bangle isn\u2019t exactly fashionable, though. If you can by with basic stat tracking and want something better looking, I like the vibrant Withings Activite Pop, and, if you\u2019re a guy at least, the bulky yet handsome Timex Metropolitan+. The diminutive Jawbone Up Move, meanwhile, is the best value of the bunch at less than $30.\n\nFitbit Charge HR (Black), $126.99, available at Amazon.\nWithings Activite Pop (Sand), $127.99, available at Amazon.\nTimex Metropolitan+ (Silver), $125, available at Amazon.\nJawbone Up Move (Black), $23.97, available at Amazon.\n\n\nlogitech k380Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019d like to make your tablet a little more conducive to getting things done, or you often find yourself working across multiple devices, you should look into a Bluetooth keyboard. The Logitech K380 isn\u2019t the best one out there, but for $40, its solid build, good looks, and relatively big keys make it the best value.\n\nIf you\u2019re only shopping for a tablet, though, I prefer the Microsoft Universal Mobile Keyboard and its built-in device stand. Just know that, while its keys are generally good and responsive, the number keys are a little too cramped.\n\nLogitech K380 (Blue), $38.95, available at Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft Universal Mobile Keyboard (Black), $54, available at Amazon.\n\nGame controllers\n\nmad catz ctrliAmazon\n\nMobile games are always going to be made with mobile devices in mind, so the need for a console-style Bluetooth controller is inherently limited. Plus, actual support for them has been notoriously spotty. But if your iPad is holding, say, all the Grand Theft Auto games, or any console ports in general, they\u2019re going to save you many headaches.\n\nIn terms of feel and construction, neither the SteelSeries Nimbus nor the Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i (or C.T.R.L.R for Android and Windows) have any significant differences. The Nimbus\u2019 matte plastic is smoother and more understated than the Mad Catz\u2019 fingerprint-hungry gloss, but generally speaking, both get the job done. The difference is that the Nimbus has a rechargeable battery, whereas the Mad Catz requires AAs to work.\n\nThat\u2019s enough enough for me to deem it superior, though in reality they\u2019re both good. Unless you use Android, that is \u2014 the C.T.R.L.R is your best bet in that case, since the Nimbus is iOS\/Mac\/Apple TV-only.\n\nSteelSeries Nimbus, $49.95, available at Apple.\nMad Catz C.T.R.L.i (Black), $49.35, available at Amazon.\nMad Catz C.T.R.L.R (Black), $49.98, available at Amazon.\n\nAudio adapters\n\naudioengine b1Amazon\n\nA couple months ago we sung the praises of the Google Chromecast Audio, which connects to a standard \u201cdumb\u201d speaker and allows you to stream music through it over WiFi. Because it uses WiFi, the audio pumped through it generally sounds crisper than that of most comparable Bluetooth audio dongles. Add the fact that it only costs $35, and I\u2019d say that\u2019s what most people looking to smarten up their home audio devices should buy.\n\nHowever, if you fancy yourself an audiophile, an upper-tier Bluetooth adapter is still the way to get your fix. The consensus pick in that side of the market is the Audioengine B1 Premium, which supports the aptX codec and its own digital-to-analog converter to, in layman\u2019s terms, sound really, really good. It\u2019s easy to set up on top of that, and it has a tremendously long streaming range. At $189, it's not cheap, but really that\u2019s the only major knock against it.\n\nAudioengine B1 Premium, $189, available at Amazon.\n\nCar kits\n\nmpow streambot yAmazon\n\nFinally, if you\u2019ve ever wanted to put Bluetooth in your car \u2014 and thus blast calls and music from your phone out to your speakers \u2014 both the Mpow Streambot Y and the iClever Himbox are reliable ways to go. The latter is the preferred choice: It goes in a car\u2019s aux-in port, which is largely cleaner-sounding and more consistent.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an aux-in port, though, the Streambot Y is a serviceable choice that plugs into an FM radio. And if you don\u2019t have an FM radio, it\u2019s probably time to stop reading this article.\n\nMpow Streambot Y,\u00a032.99, available at Amazon.\nHimbox, $29.99, available at Amazon.\n\n\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

        "text":"Top iPhone 5S Rumours\n\nApril 2, 2013\n\nThe iPhone 5 released just last quarter but the grapevine is already buzzing with rumours surrounding the next iPhone or the iPhone 5S. Check out some of the best rumours surrounding the next gen iPhone.\n\n1. iPhone 5S to Come with a Stylus\n\nThe internet has been abuzz with reports of the next iPhone coming with a stylus. While Apple reportedly filed patents for up to 3 variants of their new stylus, the pen might be used for their next generation of phones, the iPhone 5S. So far, it is Samsung that uses the stylus or the S Pen for their phablets, the Note series. This makes us wonder if Apple is coming out with a phablet too or will their Stylus be reserved for the iPhone 5S? If it is specifically for the iPhone 5S, then will the phone be larger? The screen size and the overall bezel? Also, this adds fuel to rumours of a smaller iPhone or perhaps a cheaper variant which will come without the stylus.\n\niphone 5s stylus\n\n2. \u00a0iPhone 5S to Come in Colours\n\nAfter Apple launched the iPod Touch 5th Generation in multiple colours, speculations began doing rounds of the iPhone 5S too coming in colours. According to analyst Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets, the latest generation of iPhone might come in not just a variety of colours but even different size options. If the news is true, Apple fans will have lots to rave about and a plethora of colour options to choose from. The new colourful iPod Touch has been a definite hit and looks like the success will carry over to iPhone 5S if the device is made available in multi-colour options.\n\niphone 5s colours\n\n3. iPhone 5S to Come with Fingerprint Unlocking\u00a0\n\nReports have suggested that Apple is working on a technology that let's users unlock their phones using just their finger-print.\u00a0Apple's plans for fingerprint recognition began last year when the iPhone maker bought biometric security firm AuthenTec for 235 million pounds. If the news is true, then this would be Apple's response to the\"face unlock\" technology provided by Android, considered by Apple to be its biggest rival and a lift off their iOS. Though the finger-print unlocking is definitely cool and adds a security layer it might be a little too late as Samsung introduced Eye Scrolling with their Samsung Galaxy S4. But the finger-print technology will definitely make your device safer! What if you accidently cut your thumb though?\u00a0\n\niphone 5s fingerprint unlocking\n\n4. iPhone 5S to Come with Wrap Around Display\n\nApple recently filed patents for a wrap-around display screen. This might mean that the next iPhone will come with a transparent two-way viewable screen. The wraparound text means the screen will be carried over the side bezels to the back of the phone too. If that part is true, we guess we can rule out rumour number 4 as the iPhone 5S will surely not come in colkours with wraparound text. We wonder how odd that will look! The patent filed by Apple\u00a0shows a phone similar to a flattened tube of glass, inside of which a display envelops the chips and circuit board.\n\niphone 5s wraparound\n\n5. One Killer Feature\n\nNews reports recently announced that the next iPhone or the iPhone 5S would come with 'One Killer Feature'. While last time \u00a0it was Siri that was the one killer feature, we wonder what will be the next one. An iPhone 5S that senses your thoughts perhaps? Or an iPhone 5S that comes not with fingerprint unlocking but rather with retina unlocking. Let Apple work on the 'killer' feature and we shall wait patiently till they decide to announce it. Fair enough?\n\niphone 5s\n\nTo Enjoy More Such Stories Like Us on Facebook and Follow Us on Twitter >\n\nBe a Part of The New & Next\n\n\n\n104,163 MEMBERS",
