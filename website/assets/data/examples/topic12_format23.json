        "text":"Pulp Med is a candid look at the current state of Western medicine, from the viewpoints of the authors, Petros Arguriou and Beldeu Singh.\u00a0 Using a question and answer form, Arguriou and Singh use scientific data and documented studies to show certain flaws within the medical system that they feel results in higher costs, lower standards of care and an all-around bad healthcare system in the United States.\n\nPulp Med is most certainly not a light read.\u00a0 The authors use terms and phrases specific to the medical world which could make this book difficult to read and\/or understand if read by a layperson who has little to no medical experience or knowledge.\u00a0 Something really going for this book though, is that Arguriou and Singh use documented case studies and many references for their information which validates a lot of what they have to say.\u00a0 This lends a lot of credibility to what they have to say.\u00a0\n\nOne other thing which this book really has going in it's favor is that Arguriou and Singh really tackle a wide gamut of topics in the medical field.\u00a0 Some of the topic which they speak out in their book are:\u00a0 cannabis use, cancer, the validity of prescription drug trials, the toxicity of chemicals which are commonly used in society and mental illness.\u00a0 I really enjoyed that they took such a holistic approach to a topic which can be very volatile.\n\nAs previously stated, the book is written in a question and answer format.\u00a0 This is a unique format and it does help make this book a little bit easier to read.\u00a0 The authors use this as an opportunity to break the idea down into parts, which can help the reader better understand what the authors are talking about which leads to a better understanding of their viewpoint and opinion on the subject.\u00a0 This really also contributes to the holistic nature of the book.\u00a0\n\nIf one has an interest in learning more about the medical field, this book may not be for you.\u00a0 Rather, if one wants to see the medical field from a unique perspective, one which does not paint a favorable picture on it, then this book is very much for you.\u00a0 However, I would read up on medical terms, or at least be prepared to do some research while reading this book.\u00a0\n\n~Review by: Jessica Elizabeth\n\nAuthor: Petros Arguriou & Beldeu Singh\nO-Books, 2011\npp. 246 $24.95\n\nRocketTheme Joomla Templates",

        "text":"Breast Revision\n\nBefore And After Photos\n\nThis is a patient who presented to me after having had previous breast surgery including a breast augmentation and then a breast lift. During one of her pregnancies, she developed mastitis (inflammation of the breast) on her left side which caused marked swelling of the breast and when it subsided she had significant ptosis (sagging) of the breast.\n\nShe is seen here after a two\u00a0stage breast revision procedure. I removed her implants and replaced them with saline implants and revised her mastopexy. On the second procedure, I adjusted her scars so they would be in the curve of her breast and well hidden.\n\nI didn\u2019t plan on a two stage procedure as the reason for the additional one was for improvement on her previous surgery. Some patients are willing to \u201cadjust\u201d or continue to seek improvements even though it is associated with added expense and risk. There are times, however, when I will tell my patient that what has been achieved in my hands is worth leaving well enough alone.",

An OFSTED inspection was due and I knew how nervous I felt during the last visit. I felt sure that my nerves badly affected my ability to think straight and teach well and a boost of self-confidence would not go amiss.\n\nJill\u2019s hypnotherapy treatment made me feel extremely relaxed and the recording that she sent me allowed me to continue her relaxation techniques at home. Fast forward a year and the dreaded inspector knocked at the door. Now, I\u2019m not sure if the hypnotherapy was to thank for a much less stressful OFSTED experience, but I definitely felt calmer and more confident in my ability to teach well under scrutiny and present my achievements with pride. I would certainly consider hypnotherapy again to steady my nerves and improve my self-confidence.

Our son, Andrew, has been there a couple of times and told us how comfortable he felt and how well he was treated by your staff.\u00a0Addie\u2019s\u00a0 technique during the cleaning and removal of tartar on my teeth was the best experience I think that I have ever had at the hands of a dental hygienist.\u00a0You and your staff are top notch and deserve all the praise that any of your patients send your way.[\/quote]\n\n\n\n[quote]I meant to send you an email after the last time I was there and never did. I just wanted to let you know that I first had Addie when I started to come to you and she was the best hygienist I had ever been to. Then I had to go with someone else because she was on leave with her new baby. I was very bummed until I showed up and the girl I got (sorry I forget her name ) was great too. Then I got scheduled with yet another person ( Kaitlin ) because the 2nd one was also having a baby. Again I\u00a0 was bummed until I found out that she is also terrific. My point\u2026 You have a really great group of people. Just when I think I have the best hygienist and nobody else could possibly measure up, the next one is equally as great. Kaitlin isn\u2019t pregnant is she? Thanks a lot for the pictures and Ali says, \u201cThank you for fixing my teeth.\u201d I hope you and your family have an awesome Christmas![\/quote]\n\n\n[hr] [quote]I wanted to tell you how much whiter my front teeth are starting to look since I have been using the teeth whitening procedure you prescribed for me.\u00a0Not only are my teeth starting to look lighter and brighter, but my husband, Mert (your old high school science teacher) says that he is so grateful since now he gets at least a half-hour of peace and quiet every evening now while I have the teeth tray in my mouth.[\/quote]\n\nThanks for keeping our relationship so rewarding.\n\n[hr] [quote]I cannot even begin to tell you how awesome the experience was of coming to your office\u2026it was by far the best experience I have ever had at any type of medical office!
