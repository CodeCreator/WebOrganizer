Why I waited so long to get one after first learning about it beats me!\n\nI\u2019ve had sleeping issues (insomnia) for the past 8 years. I wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep right away or stay asleep throughout the night. I probably got anywhere from 2-5 hours of sleep a night. In that time, I tried everything under the sun (or so I thought) to fix the problem: prescription pills, natural supplements, dietary changes, cleanses, sleeping exercises, mental exercises, hypno-therapy, writing, meditation, extreme physical activity, dental work, etc!\n\nThe first time I ever tried out the mat at a friend\u2019s house, I slept like a baby and woke up refreshed. Three months later on another visit, the same thing happened!\n\nI kept trying new things on my own to see if I could improve my sleep without having to use a $3k mat, but to no avail. Three months later and desperate for rest I ordered my mat.\n\nIt took 2 weeks once I got it to get that super-restful sleep again but now I sleep well every night and if you only know how big of a miracle this is or me, you\u2019d be welling up with tears of gratitude too. I don\u2019t know what I would do without this mat. I\u2019ve had it for two months now and use it faithfully twice a day. Once I got lazy and didn\u2019t use it before I want to bed and I couldn\u2019t fall asleep for 3 hours. It travels with me and I continue to sleep well anywhere I go. My boyfriend who lives with me loves using it to. He senses it benefiting his organs and well-being as he is very sensitive to energy.\n\nThank you Mediconsult for making this wonderful super-mat. Thank you Bryant and Greg for all your help and support too!\n\nChicago, IL\n\nSleep and Periodontal Challenges - Testimonial\n\nI first learned about the MRS 2000+ designo\u00ae from a friend in Colorado who called me to see if I was experiencing any health issues, pain or sleeping challenges.\n\nI had no aches or pains when he called, but I had been battling from poor sleep (about 3 to 3 \u00bd hours of sleep per night) for about 15 years. He strongly recommended that I purchase this product to which he had recently been introduced because he had heard stories about how regular use of this mat was resulting in improved sleep for several individuals. I purchased the MRS 2000+ designo\u00ae and have experienced significantly better sleep after using the mat on a consistent daily basis.\n\nAnxiety and stress have been a \u201cnormal\u201d part of my life. I was diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer in 6th grade and have had recurring ulcer symptoms requiring medication for the past 40 years. The sense of relaxation that I experience during a session on the mat is like nothing I have ever felt in the past. This is quite significant in my life, since I feel calm and \u201cde-stressed\u201d after my sessions on the mat.\nIn addition, I visit my periodontist regularly, since I have periodontal gum disease and have been a border line surgery patient for the past 5 years.\n\nDuring one of my visits, I realized that my laser cleaning treatment was not causing the normal pain and discomfort I usually experience throughout the cleaning process. I did not pay much attention to this, but when they measured my \u201cpocket depths\u201d and informed me that one of my worst areas, which had been 8 to 9 millimeter gaps, were not 4 to 5 millimeter gaps, I started asking a few questions. I inquired as to the purpose of the daily teeth cleaning and gum stimulation practices I had been instructed to do by the periodontist in order to prevent the gaps from getting worse. I was told that one of the primary goals was to stimulate the flow of oxygen in my gums. Well, the light bulb \u201cturned on\u201d for me at that point, since the pulsed energy from the mat oxygenates your blood.\n\nI came home from the periodontist and immediately contacted my friend in Colorado, signed up for the next Certification Training class in Denver and flow to Colorado to become a Certified Health Technician. Someone performed two dark field microscopy blood tests on me (before and after using the MRS 2000+ designo\u00ae) during my stay in Denver. The difference in my red blood cells after using the mat was my final confirmation that I needed to seriously consider exactly how I would get involved with this business opportunity. After six months of actively working my business, I have achieved the Systems Manager level in the Loyalty Marketing Plan and have experienced numerous amazing results from other family members and other individuals using the MRS 2000+ designo\u00ae I have never had so much fun \u201cworking\u201d in my life and look forward to many years of sharing the great news about the MRS 2000+ designo\u00ae with other in North Carolina, across the United States and around the world! Praise the Lord for bringing the MRS 2000+ designo\u00ae into my life.\n\n~Rick Burger\n\nExtra Tips To Better Sleep\n\nDo you ever have difficulty getting to sleep or find yourself waking up too early?

        "text":"REVIEW: Animal Abuse and Unlawful Killing (Ranald Munro & Helen M. C. Munro)\n\nAnimal abuse and unlawful killing book review\n\nI randomly came across this book tucked away in the corner of the university library. Sadly with social media I am reminded of the bad things in the world on a daily basis. I felt that as a vet student it was my duty to take the time to educate myself here (yeah there\u2019s not really a class for it yet!) and as it looked like a quick read, and very practical in nature I decided to borrow it.\n\nSo I\u2019ve only just started studying my pathology modules, yet this book made perfect sense with the limited knowledge that I had. It breaks down the different possible \u201ccauses\u201d of pathology resulting from abuse or unlawful killing including an introduction to the subject, how to do forensic examinations and what is expected with respect to non-accidental injury as well.\n\nDespite it being under a 100 pages long, there is an absolute wealth of information packed in; each page I read left me with things to think about and consider. Whilst it is not the nicest subject to read about, having the extra little things to consider will I believe help me in my duty to animal welfare.\n\nIn addition to the topics I mentioned about the book includes chapters on neglect, wounds and injuries, thermal injuries, firearms injuries, asphyxia and drowning, physical agents, traps and snares, bite injuries, sexual abuse and poisoning. Also there is a discussion on the estimation of time since death which is a really big topic in humans, however with the range in body size across species still remains an area where extensive research is required for animals.\n\nI would consider this book to be essential reading for every vet, vet student, vet nurse and vet technician that has any contact at all with animals.",
