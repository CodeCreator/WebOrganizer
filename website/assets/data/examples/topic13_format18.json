They were completed in 1956 and consisted of 196 dwellings in four t-shaped blocks with communal roof-top walking areas.\n\n    The flats were built on the site of some of Gateshead's worst slum housing (pictured). Under the Housing Act of 1930 the Council was given much greater legal power to deal with slum housing and whole areas could be demolished. Barn Close was the first area to be tackled after an enquiry in 1932 revealed conditions of extreme squalor (one basement was found to contain 11 people).

Between 1932 and 1935 Barn Close and other slum areas at Pipewellgate, Hillgate, Bridge Street, Church Street and Old Fold were acquired by compulsory purchase order and demolished. This added to the worsening housing shortage, and with a lack of available land on which to build, the solution was to build upwards.\n\n    Catherine Street in 1963 ..adjoined St Cuthbert's Street\n    (St Cuthberts Village area of Teams)\n    However bad this was it was no comparison to the bad that was St Cuthberts Village\n  \u2022 Gateshead Council's Local History Library of photographs is extensive but unfortunately it is largely unsearchable on the internet.

In 1919 the Addison Acts required local authorities to assess housing needs and to built new houses for rent.\n\n    In the 1920s new estates were built at Carr Hill, Bensham, Lobley Hill, Old Fold, Wrekenton and Deckham Hall. All houses were to have a scullery, larder, coal store, bath and indoor w.c. The new estates had wide streets lined with trees and were very different from the cramped terraces people were used to.\n\n    The Council also had to address the poor housing conditions in the town centre. The worst areas were close to the river where overcrowding and risk of disease was at its worst. (Taylor, S. & Lovie, D. 2004)\n\n    Under the Housing Act of 1930, the Council was given much greater legal power to deal with slum housing. The Act meant that whole areas of housing could be demolished and between 1932 and 1935 many of the streets in and around the town centre were acquired by compulsory purchase order and demolished. (Manders, 1973)\n\n    House-building came to a stop during the Second World War and overcrowding in Gatesehead once again became a big problem. After the Diesel Men White s 19999 a-Lohaa Sa-Maral Slide Sandal Black Slide\/ White a20f877 war the Council set to work building new estates at Highfield and Blue Quarries and later at Beacon Lough and Cedars Green.\n\n    However, by the mid 1950s there was a serious shortage of traditional building materials and during the 1950s and 1960s concrete was used to build modern \u2018high rise\u2019 housing. The new building schemes were combined with a vigorous programme of slum clearance and by 1970s rows of terraces in Bensham, the Teams area and Central Gateshead had been demolished.
