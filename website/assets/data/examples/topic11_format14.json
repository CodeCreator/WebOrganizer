        "text":"Member Since:\n\n\nGragnor doesn't currently have any campaigns.\n\nGragnor's Bio\n\nGragnor Ac\u2019tar was born in the slum section of Cincinnati. His age is unknown, even to himself because goblins were hardly worth noticing, let alone recording their births. According to the other races they \u201cbred like rats\u201d, and weren\u2019t treated any better either. Growing up wasn\u2019t any better. Schools were unheard of for goblins so lessons were learned hard on the streets. Jobs of any worth were rare for goblins so Gragnor truned to the only alternative for people of his ilk; thievery. And he was good at it too! By age 8 he could pick almost any lock he came across and no pocket that held anything of value was safe fom his nimble fingers. With his quick wit and above average intelligence, he taught himself to read and write in both goblin and human, a secret that he kept to himself because an intelligent goblin scared the other\n\nraces, esspecially humans. So around them, he feigned ignorance and so learned many secrets than he otherwise would have. And so he entered earluy adulthood.\nIt was at this time he was \u201csold\u201d to work in what amounted to a child slave factory. His mother could no longer fford to care for him and instead of turning him out into the streets like so many other Goblin mothers did, thought that she would give him a chance for a \u201creal job\u201d and earn a \u201creal living\u201d (and also turn a profit for herself in the process)by \u201ccontracting\u201d him to work for the humans. If Gragnor thought like was hard before, it was nothing compared to the\nconditions in the human factories. It was here, in the grueling work-house conditions, that he developed his sense of injustice. It opened his eyes to the plight of people in all races who had no one to speak out for them. It was here, inbetween the steaming pipelines and vats of chemicals that he met the first bright moment in an otherwise bleak life, a female goblin by the name of T\u2019Char\u2019ra. They ate lunch together and talked together whenever the day allowed and during their downtime, he taught her how to read and write and kept such knowledge between themselves. At night Gragnor would break into the offices and get what reading materials he could. It was here that he learned the use of chemicals and put to memory many of their combinations and formulas for use in his other profession because he had no inclination to spend\nthe rest of his life in the factory. He wanted so much more for himself and for the first time, another person, T\u2019Char\u2019a.\nAt the ripe and ready age of what amounted to his later teenage years, Gragnor made plans not only for his escape and T\u2019Char\u2019ra\u2019s from the servitude of the factories, but the other children as well. Their decision was made when, quite by accident, T\u2019Char\u2019ra came accross a medical study commissioned by the owners of the factory to see why the overturn rate was so high. It seemed that 2 out of every 3 workers who managed to reach their twenties developed what was termed as the \u201cWasting Sickness\u201d and whithered away to skin and bones before gasping out their final breath. The uselessness of their endevours almost choked him with indignity and cememted his determination to see as many freed from this wasteful use of life as possible.\nHe and T\u2019Char\u2019ra helped over 100 children escape to freedom that night. Through his connections in his other line of work, he was able to find shelter for all of the children and so began his and T\u2019Char\u2019ra\u2019s work foraging the Underground Railroad. When war broke out, Gragnor joined the army of the North hoping to further his connections to as many races and departments that he could to help out what has become his life\u2019s work. He and T\u2019Char\u2019ra got married just before he joined the army. As per the Guild of Thieves law, he stole his wedding gift for T\u2019Char\u2019ra, one of the finest lock picking sets to be \u201cfound\u201d and she stole a gold earring that Gragnor wears to this day and often fingers when in deep thought or remembering T\u2019Char\u2019ra and home.\nIt was at this point in his life that a disaster happened, that to this daY Gragnor blames himself for causing, and haunts his dreams. Once out of the army, Gragnor returned to his appropiational endevours (actually never having left them) and broke into a chemical warehouse where he intended to replenish his supply of chemicals and enhance his alchememy skills. As will eventually happen when breaking into somewhere unwanted, Gragnor was caught by an over\nviligent warehouse guard and his dog. A chase ensued amoungst the various hazardous barrels of volitle chemicals spilling some of the contents on the ground. Gragnor managed to elude the guard and his dog after a furious chase through the storage facility but had also managed to track the chemicals throughout the grounds as well. It was at this point that Gragnor smelled a peculiar odor that he recognized as flamable and that\u2019s when he saw the guard round the corner\nwith a lantern at high flame. Grangnor leaped from his hiding place to shout \u201cNO!\u201d at the guard when the explosion rocked the wharehouse engulfing the guard, his dog and the other guards who had joined the pursuit. Gragnor stood in stunned silence for just a moment and ran as hard as he could away from the now burning inferno that once was a storage facility. The flames could be seen for miles and great plumes of smoke rose from the firey conflagration and settled on the surronding district.\nSeveral months later, people living in and around the warehousing district began getting sick with a coughing sickness that resembled the flu but with no temperature and no vomiting. Soon, they began to spit-up blood and died either of drowning in their own fluids or of wasting away to skin and bones. It began what was known as the \u201cConsuming Cough\u201d and hundreds died from it. Gragnor guessed the worst and was certain that he was the cause of the illnes because it did not spread away from the district in which the fire was started. With a heavy burden on his heart, Gragnor swore to save as many as he blamed himself for killing. So he began taking on jobs that would either help people or earn lots of money to help him and T\u2019Char\u2019ra save as many children from \u201cContract Factory\u201d jobs as possible, hoping that by saving people he would eventually erase the dark blot on his soul that only he knew was there.\n\nFavorite Campaigns\n  \u2022 Roosterj\n  \u2022 Formicidae\nFriends' Activities\nFormicidae commented on the adventure log post Mini-boss, Coriander the Bad\nFormicidae created the adventure log post Mini-boss, Coriander the Bad\nFormicidae created a new character Moon Shadow\nFormicidae updated the character Hannah\nFormicidae updated the character Frumius Miths\nFormicidae created a new character Frumius Miths\nFormicidae created a new character Hannah\nRoosterj updated the adventure log post Welcome\nRoosterj updated the wiki page Main Page\nRoosterj updated the wiki page Game setup and exceptions",

        "text":"Theoretically, a Minecraft Pocket Edition world is not, in fact, infinite. You can get maybe 100,000 blocks away from your zero point before things get a little screwy. By that logic, an infinite world in MCPE should amount to 200,000 blocks along each axis, times a world height of 128\u2026 which works out to 51.2 trillion blocks in a world. Not infinite, but still a big wide world to explore.\n\nOriginally I started this site as somewhere to put my thoughts on Minecraft as an experience, pass along news, and to show off my monster builds and document my journeys through the strange, not-so-little world I\u00a0carry around with me in my pocket. It\u2019s gotten a little bit away from me as my Monday night open runs have gotten rather popular over the past few months. I now have regulars contributing posts to this blog, a subreddit, and am looking to transfer this game off of my steadily more beat up iPhone 5 as demand to run this world 24\/7 has gone up and Minecraft is going to seriously be the death of this thing.\n\nI mostly play solo, though I am occasionally joined by two entities referred to as Kidzilla and Beastie, and slightly more often by a rotating cast of characters I\u2019ve taken to calling the ARBiTors of Justice.

If it's supposed to be SE against water types, I'd suggest the move name be Boil.\n  2. Are you no longer the muffin man because you can't take the kitchen heat?\n  3. i've only seen the trailer, but it looks kinda interesting. Can you give me a rundown of who it's about and what they're trying to accomplish, without going into spoiler territory? Sell it to me.\n  4. How much German have you learned thus far? What do you find appealing about the ice element? Where do you keep your duck at night? What hopes, if any, do you have for halo 6? Should halo stop at 6? what games are you looking forward to? what games or series need a reboot, remake, or new sequel? what was the worst part of any job you've ever had? what were your favorite books that you had to read for school?\n  5. A Nintendo stan, huh? do you have any of the current systems? 3ds? etc?\n  6. Can't say I know or listen to a lot of k-pop. Everyone knows PSY and gangnam style. That second video i can't get into at all. but have a couple I can.\n  7. Maelstrom\n\n\n    recently tried the demo for a while cuz I thought a couple of the starters looked cool as well and enjoyed some of the other mon designs. I should probably through the demo more.\n  8. Just something quick and fun I made when Azzie mentioned making a New Horizons journal. I may or may not add more, or flesh it out a lot more. ---- Day 1- I escaped prison only to be caught and stranded on a remote island with a bunch of strangers. I feel sorry for the others, but I\u2019m gonna win this death game. Day2- crafted a shovel first and started planting pitfalls along the river. Everyone's gotta drink sometime\u2026 Day3- Stuck in the dirt, poor Cherry never knew what hit her. I put my shovel down. I took the axe from her unconscious hands and finished the job. 9 more to go. Day4- Apollo almost had me with that first headshot from behind an apple tree. He really does have eagle eyes, doesn\u2019t he? I blocked a few shots with my shovel, dove behind a tree, and dug myself a foxhole. He gave up eventually, unwilling to close the distance, but most of the daylight is already gone. Too late to do much but dig my foxhole deeper and plan out my revenge\u2026 Day5- The wild bamboo near the river has finally grown long enough to suit me. I spent some time upgrading my pitfalls and fortifying my foxhole. Luckily, there\u2019s a mango orchard and a river on two sides to provide protection and sustenance. I was fishing with a bamboo pole when I heard the snap, the yelp, and the shrieking. The glorious shrieking. It was a long lullaby that worked its charm quickly, after my productive day. I decided to give \u2018em till morning to regret the life decisions that put 'em in my way\u2026 ------ To Be Continued..\n  9. Happy Birthday \ud83d\ude04, i hope that you will have a fun day \ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf70\n\n  10. You know, when something decides to try to kill me out of nowhere, I take Varik's advice and I \"kill them back\". well i was gonna and then that first frog begged for its life. and I was like... ok. and then I interrogated it...\n  11.

How do you like your steaks cooked? in designing your dream home, what kind of stuff would you include? pool, bowling lane, man cave, etc?\n  \u2022 Create New...",

        "text":"Dave may be a cleric in the game, but he\u2019s a wizard in real life! Enjoy his handiwork \u2014 Phandalin Force 5\u2019s very own intro\/hype video (featuring music by yours truly)!\n\n\nDave\u00a0brings Boirin Ashcloak to life, imbuing the Dwarf Cleric with all his enthusiasm for Life \u2014 with the notable exception of goblins, of course. He keeps his comrades alive, and their foes dead.\n\nDungeon Master\u2019s Note:\u00a0\nEnthusiastic role-player and veteran gamer, on the\u00a0lookout for the perfect\u00a0build, loot glitch, or mechanic exploit\u2026\u00a0Will try to break the meta-game \u2014 in the best way! He\u2019s a great go-to to bounce ideas and sharpen my DM-ing skills.\u00a0\n\n[Edit: Stay with us, rat-fiend.]\n\n\nKyle plays the part of Erresea R\u00e1na, the party\u2019s enigmatic Elf Sorcerer. He is as unpredictable as he is uncouth, but his natural talent for magic cannot be denied. Some darkness from his past still seems to overshadow him\u2026\n\nDungeon Master\u2019s Note:\nI think he method-acts his character\u2019s unpredictability. You never know what he\u2019ll say or do next! Also, I\u2019ve seen him play RPG\u2019s before, and I can tell he\u2019s trying to keep R\u00e1na from slipping into his standard\nmodus\u00a0operandi\u2026 Which just happens to be a homicidal maniac. Might just be a matter of time\u2026\n\n[Edit: It was just a matter of time.]\n\n\nJeremiah\u2019s the one wearing the rubber Dragonborn suit. You know, if this was a movie. Instead, since it\u2019s D&D, Daardendrian Rhogar is\u00a0the Ranger\u00a0with the commanding, deep voice and dual swords cleaving his way through all manner of dark creatures in search of peace and knowledge. He knows stuff good.\n\nDungeon Master\u2019s Note:\nBrings a lot of deep thought to his character\u2019s backstory and rules of engagement. Already, he\u2019s brought a lot of richness and life to the worlds I\u2019m building, just by explaining the origins of his character.\n\n[Edit: His dice rolls are proof positive that the universe is conspiring against him.]\n\n\nZach plays the part of Roden Hobblebuckle, that sneaky little Halfling Rogue. He\u2019s quiet, and adept at avoiding notice, but has a way of being in the right place at the right time to play his part \u2014 whether scouting an enemy\u2019s position, or dealing the fatal blow on a terrible monster.\n\nDungeon Master\u2019s Note:\nLike his character, Zach has plenty of tricks up his sleeve. He is analytical, witty, and a joy to work with. He has a unique and effective approach to problem-solving, and a refreshing\u00a0sense of humor whenever he\u2019s put in an unexpected situation.\n\n[Edit: He should drop out of school in order to play D&D more often.]\n\n\nSharisse plays the part of\u00a0Andrena, the land-walker Mermaid. It\u2019s been explained to me that she doesn\u2019t need a last name \u2014 because she\u2019s famous, just like Madonna. Which, I have to admit, does make sense, since she\u2019s a Bard from the Siren\u2019s College. She needs no instrument for her music, however, as her voice is enchanting enough to cast a spell on any who can hear her song. She\u2019s just at home on land as she is in a cistern, a river, or at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nDungeon Master\u2019s Note:\nSharisse is brand new not only to Dungeons & Dragons, but to roleplaying in general \u2014 which is impressive, considering that the rest of the \u2018boy\u2019s club\u2019 has been playing video games all of our lives, so we\u2019re familiar with terms like XP, HP, Saving Throw, etc. When she\u2019s in the zone, Andrena is a wellspring of sass and puns, and we all enjoy having her around the table.\u00a0\n\n[Edit: Andrena\u00a0loves being called fish-face. So, you know \u2014 next time you see her.]\n\n\nKevin began his D&D career as the voice of myriad NPC\u2019s. Finally, after a litany of decoys ranging from odd to annoying, his true character, Torinn Delmirev, was revealed. Torinn is a dragonborn paladin who is already butting heads with some members of the party \u2014 Rhogar literally, R\u00e1na figuratively.\n\nDungeon Master\u2019s Note:\nThe introduction of Kevin\u2019s character is exciting for me as a writer, simply because he\u2019s so different from everyone else. As a Paladin with an \u201cattack first, ask questions later\u201d approach, I look forward to how he shapes the story moving forward. Also, he\u2019s given Gnerx an apprenticeship, which\u00a0is a delightful chemistry to explore.\u00a0\n\n[Edit:\u00a0If Torinn or R\u00e1na is murdered, the other is likely to know who did it\u2026]\n\n\nI\u2019m the Dungeon Master. I play the role of the sentient game engine. I facilitate the fantasy\u00a0through which the players move, regulating the forces of nature and speaking\u00a0worlds into existence\u2026 Also, I\u2019m super humble.\n\nIt\u2019s my job to obsessively study the rules and tables and prepare all the stats and, well, pretty much everything. My monster manual is full of page tabs and post-it notes, and\u00a0I\u2019m constantly inventing magical items and building characters, settings, and puzzles. I\u2019ve halfway through the outline for my second campaign before my players have even finished the Starter Set, and sometimes I like to brag that I know ahead-of-time exactly when everyone\u2019s character dies (which is only mostly true).\n\nI\u2019m a writer first, but I\u2019m also passionate about game design, systems, maps, and charts \u2014 so I guess it was inevitable that I\u2019d become a DM. So far, it\u2019s been great! Couldn\u2019t ask for a better D&D group.",
