Are you tired of running the generator day in and day out at $4 plus per gallon for fuel? Do you want to enjoy the weekend at your off grid cabin without hearing the generator run all night and day? Aims Power has the solution for you.\n\nA power inverter is great alternative to using a generator and the setup is very streamlined with an AIMS Power inverter.\u00a0 The most common unit is an inverter with a built in transfer switch and battery charger. AIMS Power offers five different inverter charger models.\u00a0 Here are the different models offered by Aims Power:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1500 watt inverter charger - modified sine power inverter part# PWRIC1500W\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1500 watt inverter charger\u00a0 - pure sine power inverter part# PWRIC150012S\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3000 watt inverter charger - modified sine power inverter part# PWRIC300012w\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3000 watt inverter charger - modified sine power inverter part# PWRIC300024w\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3000 watt inverter charger - pure sine power inverter part# PWRIC300012S\n\nInverter chargers make the system all automatic. Once the generator power is cut off, the inverter and DC battery source will take over.\nPicking the right size inverter is critical in this setup.\u00a0 So, gathering the power demand of all items that need to run off of the inverter will help you select the proper inverter and battery setup.\u00a0 Contact Aims power for further information and help with selecting the right equipment for your individual setup.\n\nPowering a Gaming Console\n\nWe receive many inquiries from customers that need to power a gaming console during a road trips or while camping.\u00a0 The solution is easy; you will need an inverter, battery cables, and a DC source.\nAfter doing a little research, I found some power ratings for the most popular game consoles, while you are playing a game.\n\n  \u2022 Sony PS3 unit draws the most power 199w\n  \u2022 Microsoft Xbox 360 a close second with 187w\n  \u2022 Nintendo Wii at 18w\n\nOf course this does not include the TV that the system is connected to, but gives us a general idea what we are working with.\n\nFor any of the units listed above, we will recommend the AIMS Power 300 watt pure sine wave inverter (PWRI30012S) or larger AIMS Power 600 watt pure sine power inverter. We recommend that you direct connect this inverter to your battery, because most vehicle power outlets are only capable of delivering 180 watts of power.\u00a0 The pure sine wave inverter is a very clean power that is typically required to operate the electronics within the console.\n\nIn addition to the inverter, you will need battery cables to connect the inverter to the power source. For example if the console will be used on a road trip, you will need cables to run from the battery in the front to the inverter in the back or under the seat.\n\nInstallation options are limitless and can be custom tailored for each application. Please contact us by phone or email if you need help with your system.\n\nGeneral Power Inverter Questions and Tips\n\nWhat is the difference between modified and pure sine?\n\nModified is a blocky sine wave and a pure sine is a cleaner rounded sine wave. \u00a0\u00a0A pure sine wave is as close to city power as it gets via inverter.\u00a0 Pure sine inverters are intended for sensitive electronics and some motors.\u00a0 Modified sine nverters should work with the majority of devices.\n\nHow long will my inverter last with \"X\" number of batteries?\n\nWhen choosing batteries for your battery bank, you should consider two things; what you are running and how long you want to run your system?\u00a0\n\nNow you can take the output AC amps multiply them by the volts output (vac) to figure watts.\u00a0 Then, watts divided by input volts (vdc) gives the DC amps consumed per hour.\u00a0 Once you have your DC amps per hour, you need to include the power loss through the inversion, which is about 10%.\u00a0 Generally you should just multiply your DC amps per hour by 1.1 and this will give you the right amount in your final DC amps required total.\n\nAmps ac (your load) x Volts ac = Watts\n\nWatts\/Voltage dc = Amps dc per hour required\n\nAmps dc per hour\u00a0 x\u00a0 1.1 = actual Amps dc\n\nWhat size inverter do I need?\n\nInverter sizing depends on the type of device being powered.\u00a0 Device start-up or surge should always be considered.\u00a0 For example, motors and compressors have start-up surges.\u00a0 It's generally a good idea to oversize an inverter.\n\nDo you carry an inverter designed for emergency back-up power?\u00a0\u00a0 Sump pump, furnace blower, refrigerator, computer, etc..\n\nEmergency back-up systems are something we specialize in.\u00a0 Our inverter charger units have a built in transfer switch that is specifically designed for emergency back-up power.\u00a0 Inverter charger units also cater to the novice inverter installer.\n\nWhat type of batteries should I use?\n\nType of battery being used primarily depends on how often and the amount of time you will be running your system. In general, deep cycle marine\/RV batteries and sealed batteries and are the best.\n\nHow much power can I get from my cigarette lighter? \u00a0\n\nDC cigarette lighter adapters commonly used in vehicles average 150 watts to 180 watts, UL recommended rating for a cigarette outlet is 80 watts max; This is because the wiring within the port is small, as well as, fused at 15 amps DC.\n\nHow do I wire batteries together?\u00a0 What is series vs. parallel?\n\nCorrect wiring of your battery bank is important.\u00a0 When your batteries are not wired correctly, your system may not work and\/or permanent damage could occur.\u00a0 So, always remember that series increases the voltage, and parallel increases the amps. Series is achieved by connecting positive of battery one to negative of battery two.\u00a0 Parallel is achieved by connecting batteries positive to positive & negative to negative.\n\nWhat size cables should I use?\n\nCable sizing is determined by the size of your inverter.\u00a0 National Electric Code standards are strongly suggested when wiring a system.\u00a0 Recommended sizing is as follows; #4 gauge is not to exceed 157 amps DC (approximately 1500 watts), 1\/0 is not to exceed 291 amps (approximately 3500 watts), and 4\/0 is not to exceed 454 amps (approximately 5000 watts.)\u00a0 These ratings are based on a 12 volt system.\n\nHow far should inverter be from my batteries?\n\nInverters should be safely mounted near to the battery bank powering the unit as possible; therefore, 10-12 ft. should not be exceeded without sizing the gauge of your cables to the next available size up.\n\nWill my car\/truck electrical system handle an inverter?\u00a0 If so, what size?\n\nVehicle electrical systems are typically designed to be maintained by an alternator, only using the battery for short bursts of power to get the motor started.\u00a0 So, small systems will work fine via the electrical system in your vehicle. Anything that exceeds the amount of power that the vehicle can produce should have an auxiliary system which is charged separately.\n\nDo your inverters have high and low voltage shutdown?\n\nLow voltage shutdown is 10.5 on all of our inverters.\u00a0 And hi voltage shutdown varies between 15-17 volts on all of our inverters.\u00a0 These are 12 volt inverter shutdown voltages.\n\nCan I use my power inverter in a marine environment?\n\nOur inverters are acceptable in marine environments.\u00a0 For best results, safely mount the inverter in a dry, well ventilated area.\n\nHow does a transfer switch work?\n\nTransfer switches are designed to isolate multiple sources of AC power.\u00a0 When one source power is eliminated from the system, the next source of power is automatically applied.\u00a0 Also, the AIMS Power transfer switch \u00a0unit is easily installed via separate terminals for each power source.\n\nWhat is advantage\/ disadvantage of 12, 24, 48 volts?\n\nAdvantages for different voltages are as follows.\u00a0 Higher voltage battery bank can be more efficient, due to smaller cable sizes which can lead to less current, less voltage drop and less heat.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Also, higher voltage battery banks typically have multiple batteries in series to increase the voltage; this increases the amount of charge and discharge cycles your batteries are capable of handling. Disadvantages for different voltages are as follows, lower voltage battery banks are typically used for smaller systems and these battery banks may be less efficient and may consume more DC power than higher voltage systems.\n\nCan an AIMS Power inverter be wired directly to an electrical panel?\n\nService panels are compatible with AIMS inverters; however, if you are looking to produce 120\/240 Vac you will need to use an AIMS Power split phase inverter.\u00a0 Please feel free to call us if you need more detail about split phase power inverters.\n\nGrounding the neutral Vac is a feature of our single phase units, with the exception of the \u201cno frills models\u201d (pwrb1000, pwrb1250, pwrb2500 and the bct010009d).\u00a0\n\nIf you are planning to connect a power inverter to a service panel where AC is present.\u00a0 Please call us or consult a qualified electrician.\u00a0 You can destroy your power inverter if this is not done properly, by back feeding AC into the inverter.\n\nA Few Helpful Inverter Tips:\n\n  \u2022 Never leave an inverter connected to a line where other power (Vac) may feed into inverter.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter if inverter is on or off.\u00a0 Unless your inverter is a grid tie inverter.\n  \u2022 Using inverters in moist areas is a common cause for their drivers to burn out.\u00a0 Even an outdoor extension cord that was lying in a puddle a day previously may have enough moisture to burn out the drivers of the inverter.\u00a0 Tip: if using inverter in rain one day, allow cords that may have gotten wet to dry a few days before using in inverter again\n  \u2022 Always prevent foreign objects from entering inverter through the vent or fan openings\n  \u2022 Keep cables between inverter and batteries as short as possible.\u00a0 This will help your batteries perform their best.\n  \u2022 Always use sealed batteries if you want to keep the inverter clos...

        "text":"2011-05-28 08:10:31\u6765\u6e90: \u4e92\u8054\u7f51\nAbstract: This application note answers frequently asked questions for Dallas Semiconductor digital potentiometers.\n\nHow do I set up the DS1267 in stacked configuration?\n\nConnect the H0 terminal to the L1 terminal. With the Stack Select Bit (LSB of the 17-bit I\/O Shift Register) set to a 0, the multiplexed output, SOUT, will be the output seen at W0. With the Stack Select Bit set to a 1, SOUT will be the output seen at W1. The new stacked potentiometer will use H1 as the new upper terminal, L0 as the lower terminal and SOUT as the wiper, as determined by the setting of the Stack Select Bit.\n\nAre there any digital potentiometers that use an I2C compatible bus?\n\nMany of our newer digital potentiometers and resistors use a 2-wire communication protocol that is compatible with the I2C communication specification.\n\nCan the DS1847\/48 be used in general purpose applications?\n\nYes. The DS1847 and DS1848 devices contain two temperature controlled digital resistors and are typically used in fiber monitoring and control applications. However, they can also function well in any application that requires a resistance that is stable over temperature or needs to be auto-adjusted according to temperature. As an added bonus, the DS1848 comes with 128 bytes of EEPROM.\n\nIf I increment\/decrement to the end points of the digital potentiometer or resistor, will the wiper wrap around?\n\nNo. When a wiper is incremented to the top rail of the potentiometer or resistor, it will hit the top most position and stay there. Any further increment commands will not cause the setting to wrap around to the bottom rail. The wiper will simply maintain its position at the top most setting. When sending a decrement command after the wiper has reached the bottom most rail, the wiper will simply maintain the lowest position and will not wrap around to the top rail.\n\nOnce I have stored the wiper of a non-volatile potentiometer, will that wiper setting change or drift?\n\nNo. Because we save the wiper settings of our digital resistors and potentiometers in EEPROM, the wiper settings will not drift or change unless a new setting is programmed and stored into the EEPROM memory.\n\nI want to use the DS1669's pushbutton inputs and want to drive them from logic on my board. what problems might I encounter?\n\nIn order to go into the 2-button mode, the DS1669 requires the inputs to the UC and DC to be open-circuited at power-up. With processor control, some logic gates will not pull the inputs low enough to activate the input. The open circuit effect can be accomplished with a schottky diode between the processor and the pot pin pointed toward the processor, or the use of a FET between the pot and ground controlled by the processor. Another option is to look at the DS1804, a device designed for processor connections. To use the DS1669 in single pushbutton mode or anytime the DC pin is not used, it must be tied directly to VCC at power-up.\n\nWhat is the noise specification of a digital potentiometer?\n\nNoise specs were removed from the digital pot data sheets in 1999. In a study by the Georgia Institute of Technology, performed under the supervision of Professor P.E. Allen, the DS1267, DS1666, DS1667, and DS1669 were measured for noise. The conclusions of this report were the following:\n  \u2022 The equivalent input noise voltage is proportional to the resistance.\n  \u2022 The test data of input noise voltages are greater than the calculated thermal noise.\n  \u2022 This implies that other noise sources including the test system noise, power supply noise, and parasitic noise caused from board and wiring are coupled into the system.\n  \u2022 There exists residual noise in the chips of approximately 10nv\/sqrt(Hz) exists in the chips.\n\nWhat do I need to know about the D input on the dallastats?\n\nWhen powered up with the D input low (connected to GND), the wiper will move from one end to the other and back, continuously cycling up and down until the D input is taken high (or high impedance since there is an internal pull-up), after which both pushbutton inputs and the D input will operate correctly. (For example, the D input overrides the pushbutton inputs if low on power-up). On the other hand, when powered up with the D input either open or high (connected to VCC), a high-to-low transition on the D input will NOT move the wiper until AFTER one of the pushbutton inputs is activated.\n\n\n\u7f16\u8f91\uff1a\u795e\u8bdd \u5f15\u7528\u5730\u5740\uff1ahttp:\/\/www.eeworld.com.cn\/mndz\/2011\/0528\/article_9234.html\n\u8bba\u575b\u6d3b\u52a8 E\u624b\u638c\u63e1\n\u8bba\u575b\u6d3b\u52a8 E\u624b\u638c\u63e1\n\u82af\u7247\u8d44\u8baf \u9510\u5229\u89e3\u8bfb\n\u82af\u7247\u8d44\u8baf \u9510\u5229\u89e3\u8bfb\n\n\n\n\u9986\u5185\u5305\u542b\u4e86 \u7eb5\u89c8FRAM\u3001\u72ec\u7acbFRAM\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\u4e13\u533a\u3001FRAM\u5185\u7f6eLSI\u4e13\u533a\u4e09\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u3000\n\u5e26\u4f60\u8d70\u8fdbLED\u738b\u56fd\u2014\u2014Microchip LED\u5e94\u7528\u4e13\u9898\n\u5e26\u4f60\u8d70\u8fdbLED\u738b\u56fd\u2014\u2014Microchip LED\u5e94\u7528\u4e13\u9898\n\u7535\u5b50\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e16\u754c\u7248\u6743\u6240\u6709 \u4eacICP\u8bc1060456\u53f7 \u4eacICP\u590710001474\u53f7 \u7535\u4fe1\u4e1a\u52a1\u5ba1\u6279[2006]\u5b57\u7b2c258\u53f7\u51fd \u4eac\u516c\u6d77\u7f51\u5b89\u5907110108001534 Copyright \u00a9 2005-2016 EEWORLD.com.cn, Inc.

        "text":"Are the infrared LEDs on Arlo cameras visible at night?\n\nYes, Arlo cameras display an array of red dots around their lenses when their infrared LEDs are on. The red glow indicates that the infrared LEDs are active. These LEDs aid the night vision capability of the Arlo cameras.\n\nArlo Baby\u2019s infrared LEDs are much dimmer than the night vision LEDs on other Arlo cameras. Bright infrared LEDs can distract babies and keep them from sleeping, so Arlo Baby\u2019s infrared LEDs are almost invisible, but still provide excellent low-light performance.\n\nYou can turn night vision on and off on any Arlo camera.
