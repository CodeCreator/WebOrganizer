        "text":"Blog U \u203a\u00a0\n  \u2022 Just Visiting\n\n    A blog by John Warner, author of the story collection Tough Day for the Army, and a novel, The Funny Man, on teaching, writing and never knowing when you're going to be asked to leave.\n\nIt's Reckoning Time\nNovember 27, 2012 - 5:44pm\n\nWe are in the waning days of the semester, and this is usually my favorite time of the school year. In my freshman composition class, the students are working on their researched essays, a process that takes five weeks from start to finish, and in reading their drafts, I can see the knowledge breaking through.\n\nThey are becoming self-regulating writers, capable of making the choices that meet their audience\u2019s needs, attitudes, and knowledge. These are my goals for them, and it is exciting and gratifying to see this development, to experience a seed planted in week four flower in week fourteen.\n\nWhen we formally meet class, it\u2019s to exchange drafts and gather feedback. Half our periods are set aside for individual or small group conferences where we get to talk in detail about what they\u2019re working on in their essays. We take a long time on this assignment because one of the things I want my students to experience is just that, working on something for a long time. They tend to have very little practice at developing a project over a period of weeks, having spent much more of their schooling on \u201cjust in time\u201d task work. Task work is lousy preparation for their future lives and careers, so I take as many opportunities as possible to steer away from it.\n\nAnother reason I enjoy this time is because of what they\u2019re working on in their essays. The topics are varied and unpredictable, as unique as they are as individuals. One is writing an argument as to why surfing should be admitted into the Olympics. A conservative student has become concerned about the \u201cwealth gap\u201d and wants to write to his compatriots as to why they should be worried as well. Someone else is examining the phenomenon of adults crying when viewing Toy Story 3.\n\nThe use of micropayments in video games, \u201chealth halo\u201d marketing in frozen yogurt, why open format games like Minecraft are addictive, pedagogical methods for teaching foreign language\u2026I would like to go on and on, but let this list suffice to demonstrate that when I am done reading their work, I will be much smarter and better informed than before. I get to experience the promise of education, that together we can make knowledge, and collectively be much smarter than we are as individuals.\n\nI suppose it isn\u2019t accidental that my favorite time of the semester comes just before my least favorite time \u2013 the end-of-semester grading, a period marked by dread and despair.\n\nOne of the benefits of having students work on projects for a long period of time is that we can divorce the work from the grade it might ultimately receive and concentrate on the doing itself, but semester\u2019s end forces us into a final reckoning, a mark on the scorecard, which is inevitably what students will remember more than that moment we talked about possible audiences for their work, and they realized who, exactly, they wanted to write to, and in so doing, some previously intractable problem with their essay was suddenly solved.\n\nIt is not that I am against grades, per se. I believe I understand their utility. It is important that students have a measurement against which they can judge their efforts. I just don\u2019t care for the reduction grading requires. Many weeks crunched down to a letter.\n\nAfter I grade these assignments I have a final set of individual conferences with each student, and the first thing I ask them is how they think they did, what they were pleased with in the paper, what they wished they had more time to work on, and almost invariably their self-assessment syncs with mine. This is an excellent sign for their futures, I think. Even if the present reckoning is a less-that-satisfactory B- or C+, if they can recognize the roots of that evaluation, we are getting beyond the letter itself into a type of learning they can make use of.\n\nBut still, I hate it. For me, evaluation is the least interesting part of the job. I would much rather converse\/engage\/respond\u00a0 to their work because this is, after all, what I\u2019m asking them to do with the information they encounter in class. I do as much of this as possible when grading these assignments, writing comments that seek to engage with their ideas, but ultimately students both want and deserve some measure of assessment, a judgment of where they excel, what needs more work.\n\nI tell them often that their grades do not \u201cmatter,\u201d which is something I believe to be true, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are meaningless, and they certainly cannot be arbitrary, so while I hate grading, or more accurately, because I hate grading, it\u2019s the part of the job where I have to work my hardest.\n\nIf I am scarce in these parts, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m doing.\n\n\n\nPlease review our commenting policy here.\n\nSearch for Jobs\n\n\n  \u2022 Viewed\n  \u2022 Commented\n  \u2022 Past:\n  \u2022 Day\n  \u2022 Week\n  \u2022 Month\n  \u2022 Year\nBack to Top",

If any of the themes work for what you are doing please feel free to help yourself to anything you see.\nPost Title. 12\/01\/2009\nOk so I Finally got around to making some \u201cspecial\u201d workbox numbers for our DS, who at this minute is as happy as a pig in mud. LOL, I guess while I hadn\u2019t made his workbox numbers there was always the chance that I would change my mind about homeschooling him after Christmas. Now that I have made him his very own set of (car) workbox numbers he must feel safe in the knowledge that it\u2019s not just the girls that get to be homeschooled. If anyone would like any of the workbox numbers I have made, feel free to download them from our downloads page.",

She always does a good job. Knows her stuff and recommends what is best for the brand. She did well today as well.\n\nIn today's presentation though, she was not in her elements. The eye contact was less and the voice was not loud enough. The x-factor was lacking.

        "text":"Tag Archive: PR\n\ncrunch time\n\nReady, set\u2026\n\nStart freaking out!\n\nThere are six weeks left of school and the job search has begun. I should have probably started the hunt awhile back but I just don\u2019t think it would have been humanly possible. I hardly have time to see my boyfriend and we live together. Between building three websites, two communications plans , an internship and working I don\u2019t have time for much else.\n\nSo are you wondering how to find a job after graduation? Me too. I\u2019ve done my fair share of networking and asking communicators around me for tips or recommendations on the process. A lot of them had similar answers but I still hear this phrase in my head, \u201cit\u2019s not about what you know or who you know. It\u2019s about who knows you.\u201d Simon Salt gave my class this bit of knowledge a few months ago and it\u2019s stuck with me ever since. After all, that is pretty much exactly how I got my internship with him and myDASHH.\n\nFor the past couple of months I\u2019ve been attending a lot of networking events and job shadowing trying to get my name out there. I\u2019ve made a few connections and plan on working those to get my resume in front of the right people. I\u2019m also creating a digital portfolio online to help brand myself and showcase some of my best work.\n\nMy next step is to complete this weekend is a list of prominent places to work for in DFW. I need to do a little more research on the companies I haven\u2019t heard of and determine which I think I would fit in best. After that, I\u2019m going to figure out which of my connections have connection at each place, haha.\n\nI\u2019ve already been scanning the PRSSA job bank, as well as dfwcommunicators.com, Monster and UNT Career Center. Now I really need to start sending out my resume.\n\nIf you\u2019re a PR student and you\u2019re graduation next semester or next May I highly recommend starting your networking and internships now. Everyone should also read this blog post by MarketingMel, \u00a0How to get a job in Public Relations: Eleven tips from a PR pro. I like this post because it has a few unique but pertinent tips.\n\nMarketingMel points out as number eleven on the list you need to brand yourself. I\u2019ve heard this over and over the past semester. I\u2019ve found the easiest way to do this is to solidify your social media profiles and make sure you are portraying the brand in person as well. The other tip I like is to follow journalists on Twitter, etc. I\u2019ve heard too many PR students say that they don\u2019t read the news. I have always been a news junkie and it\u2019s important in our field to know news breaking information no matter which part of communications you pursue.\n\n\n\nAs a soon-to-be graduate I often find myself asking every professional their view on things like what are the most important things I can be doing to get a job after school, what they prefer to see on a resume and what should I include in my portfolio, among others.\n\nAt this week\u2019s PRSSA meeting the President of BizCom Associates, Scott White, gave some advice that really made a difference to me, \u201cWrite to be a good writer, not to get the grade.\u201d This helped me get out of my forced creative slump. When you\u2019re forced to be creative by a deadline each week the work produced is hardly your best. Every week staring at my laptop a powerful, thought provoking idea doesn\u2019t automatically come to mind. I know I\u2019m the only person with this problem. I know as a college senior that this definitely won\u2019t be the last time I struggle with this situation. But I now realize that this blog can be something more than just an obligation. It\u2019s another outlet for me to perform on deadline and improve my writing skills.\n\nAnother student (Brandon, maybe?) asked Scott what he prefers to read on blogs and if he likes a more conversational tone or a news-story structured blog. Scott said the key to writing is understanding your audience. We\u2019ve all heard that before and apply it to our communication plans and marketing homework but fail to realize it\u2019s the same for a simple blog post.\n\nScott, having a BA in Journalism from UNT, really emphasized at the meeting how important it is to be a strong writer. To write a basic news release that meets the requirements of standard format isn\u2019t that hard. But to write an effective news release that is going to read and the information published requires being a skilled writer.\n\nScott White of BizCom Associates Tips to Scoring a Job after Graduation\n\n#1 \u2013 Have an internship during school\n\n#2 \u2013 Be a strong writer\n\n#3 \u2013 Read The New Rules of Marketing and PR: How to Use News Releases, Blogs, Podcasting, Viral Marketing and Online Media to Reach Buyers Directly\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

        "text":"After leaving sixth form in 2016, I began working in retail. For the first year or so, I enjoyed what I was doing and barely gave the future a second thought. It was when my peers began moving across the country for university that I started to feel as though I was falling behind. I began to dread bumping into old friends through fear of the question \u2018so, what are you doing at the moment?\u2019\nMy self-confidence had plummeted and I was feeling as if I would be stuck stacking shelves forever.\n\nMaking Changes\n\nI knew I had to start making positive changes and confided in a few close friends about how I was feeling. One friend suggested that I look into Creative Youth Network, they had helped her find a job she loved and later employed her as a freelancer on their Creative Futures programme. I decided to check out their website and saw they were offering a range of free creative courses (free travel and lunch included!)\u00a0\nI quickly enquired, and was soon enough booked in to do a Creative Careers fashion and textiles course at The Station. It was a four-week program where I would learn to use a sewing machine, applique, make patterns and earn myself a bronze arts award. However, it wasn\u2019t until the course began that I realised I\u2019d get much more out of it than just these practical skills.\n\nGaining Confidence\n\nThrough the support and encouragement I received, my confidence quickly grew, I felt more productive and I found myself eager for new challenges. I knew I wanted to move away from retail but felt lost about the direction to take. I was completely unaware of the opportunities available to me in Bristol and didn\u2019t know where to look or who to ask. I spoke through some of these feelings with Phoebe, a youth worker on the fashion course, and together we wrote down a list of things I wanted to achieve over the coming year. This alone was a huge push; for the first time in 3 years, I felt I was working towards something.\n\nI took my newfound confidence and started looking for jobs near me. I was keen to build on my skill-set and start my career in a field I was actually interested in. This is how I stumbled across \u2018QA apprenticeships'.\u00a0I hadn't put much thought into doing an apprenticeship but after finding out more, it seemed like the perfect way to start my professional career and gain useful qualifications. I looked through some of the programmes they offered and was particularly interested in their digital marketing options. After I'd read what the job entailed, I felt like it was the perfect fit. I quickly applied and within a day they\u2019d called me back to enrol. Before I had time to doubt myself, I was being offered interviews for companies across Bristol. One interview that stood out in particular, was the role of \u2018digital marketer\u2019 for none other than Creative Youth Network.\n\nAs I\u2019d had such a great experience with them previously, I made it my mission to get the job and began preparation 2 weeks before the interview. I read through the job description over and over and created a portfolio of relevant skills and experience. I saw they had a 'Help to get a job blog' on their website so I studied it and began working on my interview technique. It was a nerve-wracking experience as I hadn\u2019t applied for a role like this before.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFast Forward\n\nFortunately, my preparation paid off and I\u2019m working here now! It\u2019s been an overwhelmingly positive transition and the progress I\u2019ve made personally has been huge. The environment at Creative Youth Network allows me to build on my creative skills and interests such as photography and writing. I\u2019m able to attend a variation of interesting events across Bristol, taking photos as I go and documenting them on social media. As well as this I\u2019m learning how to update the website, create flyers, use Adobe editing software, read analytics and understand coding (the list goes on but if I continue we'll be here all day!)\n\nMy confidence has grown massively since beginning my Creative Youth Network journey. Having the ability to work in a field I\u2019m interested in, as well as improving my skill-set, has given me a sense of optimism I haven\u2019t felt before. Thanks to Creative Youth Network, thinking about my future no longer fills me with dread and I look forward to telling people what I\u2019m up to. My advice for anyone in a similar situation would be to stay positive and to reach out to friends, family and local organisations. There is help and advice out there and when you know where to look, the opportunities are endless.\n\n\nWe believe giving young people facing mental and physical barriers the chance to harness their creative interests, gives them the confidence to explore new opportunities. Our creative courses are a big step in the right direction, but we'd like to hear from you. Have you ever used one of our creative services, and if so, do you feel it made a positive impact in your life?",

I know we are all always looking for or at least get excited when we learn of free outings for our home schooled children. Well I had a play date scheduled for this past Tuesday because it was winter break in our county so my daughter's school-age friends were out of school and available to come over. I decided not to take winter break along with the school system but we did take a couple of half days and a really awesome field trip! This is what today's post is all about. Our really, really awesome, super fun, free, educational field trip!\n\nThere's a place in south GA called Callaway Gardens. It is really beautiful in the spring and summer months, well, because it is a garden:\n\n\"Open since 1952, Callaway Gardens is the centerpiece of 13,000 acres nestled in the southernmost foothills of the Appalachians.\u00a0 Founder Cason Jewell Callaway longed for a place where man and nature could abide together for the good of both, and now more than half a century later, his retreat continues to offer solace, inspiration and discovery for all who come here.\"\n\nWe, however found out from my friend, that Callaway was offering free admissions! This is of course due to it being winter which is definitely off-peak season for a nature retreat in the South. Well, the dear old people of Callaway Gardens were probably not expecting it to hit 75 degrees during their off-peak season, but opportunistic moms like myself and my friends waited patiently until just such a day come upon us and pounced on the golden opportunity!\nBirds of Prey Show at Callaway Gardens\n\nI called a field trip, packed a lunch, called another homeschooling mom of 5 and we hit the road. Literally. We are not in the closest proximity to Callaway so it was more like a road trip for us but was still well worth it. We watched an awesome Birds of Prey show that included interesting facts about Raptors or wild birds of prey. We learned about the Red Hawk which is one beautiful animal. We also learned about the Horned Owl and a couple of more beautiful birds. We also ducked as these lovely creatures flew ans swooped over the crowed. It was a great experience for the kids! Especially since my friend's kids were coverning birds in their curriculum this past week. We however had just finished covering insects. NO worries though, Callaway had us covered. There's a beautiful butterfly atrium where they breed butterflies and have a number of cocoons and chrysallis on display so that we could observe the different stages of a catepillar turning into a butterfly. Very educational for my two girls. Inside of the atrium though was several species of butterflies fluttering all around. It was magical.\nChelsea in the long sleeve pink tee inside the butterfly atrium and Madison attempting to catch a butterfly!\n\nWe also enjoyed feeding large fish off of a bridge at Discovery Center and seeing all of the different types of flowers beginning to bloom as we walked from station to station.\n\nIn closing...I'd like to say that if you are new to home schooling like me, take this tip for things to do. Think about all types of attractions business whose peak times have passed, pull up their websites and search for free admissions! You're sure to stumble upon something good.\nWe need a better camera!\nChelsea and Madison playing in the fountain inside of the butterfly atrium\n\nI will add pictures of our outing soon...\n\n*What did you do on Winter break or over the weekend?

        "text":"Plan of Action\n\nWhat I plan to do for my University assessments\n\n\nToday has been insightful and fun,\n\nAs I\u2019m sat in a cafe, typing away whilst enjoying a cup of coffee, my thoughts are racing about ideas for my University assessments which are due soon. My classes today explained more about what makes a news story, how they are found by journalists, what is soft and hard news etc. It was interesting to say the least as I felt that I learnt a lot about the media world.\n\nWe looked at newspapers in groups and had to figure out why some articles were news worthy, who they appeal to and such. It has made me think a bit more about how I plan to tackle my assessments head on with confidence. Our first task is to go out and get a news story about anything we choose. As of now, I am still thinking of ideas, one of which I am quite confident about and will more than likely be what I go for. There is a relatively new gaming bar that opened up during the summer and I personally know the manager there. They posted on their social media recently about a charity event so I would be interested in getting to know more and write about it for my assessment. I think it would be an interesting article to write about as there are not many gaming bars in Sheffield. Gaming is very popular now so it would appeal to a lot of people, including students who have recently moved to the city and are wanting to explore the area more.\n\nMy other assessment is for Radio Journalism which I had a lesson in today. We were taught the basics on how to interview. Even though it was interesting, I am still uncomfortable with interviewing strangers as I imagine a lot of people are. We were all asked to grab one of the supplied microphones and go out in pairs to interview each other just to get used to it a little. I took a deep breath and went with it and I actually quite enjoyed it even though I was nervous the entire time. The girl next to me asked if she wanted to pair with me, I happily agreed so we both went to Tamper cafe, ordered a coffee and got the interview over and done with. We had a few laughs, got to know each other a little and got some good questions for our work. It was a fun warm up for interviewing people. I won\u2019t be going up to a stranger and have them tell me something interesting that is going on in their lives, instead I\u2019m thinking I will ask my roommate if he would be interested in being interviewed by me as he has recently started a company that helps people start their own business. I think it will be quite interesting to talk about as I am curious about the process of starting up a business.\n\nInterviews over coffee with new friends\n\nI don\u2019t have any more lessons this week now so I will be using this time to prepare myself for my work assessments and put together a solid plan. Not tonight though because tonight I want to finish Astral Chain as I think I am nearing the end. I also want a little break from everything as it has been a bit full on. I will keep you updated on my work in the next couple of days!\n\nOn a side note, I know this blog hasn\u2019t got any images so here\u2019s a random photo of our cat Ziggy on the doughnut cushion at home!\n\nA big yawn for the sleepy Ziggles\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading and look forward to seeing you in the next blog!\n\nWild link.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Posts Tagged \u2018technology\u2019\n\nWhat I learned at the Sloan-C\u00a0Conference\n\nNovember 13, 2012 Leave a comment\n\nI attended the Sloan-C Conference on Online Learning recently and I would like to share some of the highlights. The general table talk was about MOOCS (massive open online courses) but I am not going to talk about those today. The underlying theme that I was more interested in and I agree with is that in the future\u00a0higher education will not and should not look like it does now. We need to redesign our courses to take advantage of the rich resources and experiences that students have available to them outside the classroom walls. We also need to make our classrooms relevant and up to date for our students.\n\nFaculty Development\n\nWith that being said, faculty are expected to be doing more and more so time is becoming less and less. It is important to provide relevant faculty development in a variety of ways so faculty can access it in way that suits them. I saw a great presentation by the folks at St. Petersburg College. They are choosing a theme each month that highlights some technology or technique. They start the month with a blog post that contains all the information and videos that a faculty member would need to implement that in their classroom. They also include faculty talking about their experience utilizing that technology or technique in their classroom. Next there is a workshop event for hands on instruction for the faculty. This is followed by a webinar, lunch event and open lab times for faculty. I love how the faculty have a choice as to how they\u00a0receive\u00a0the information and that there is a consistent\u00a0schedule\u00a0of activities that faculty can count on and plan for. We hope to implement a variation on this at our campuses this spring.\n\nOnline Student Orientation\n\nThe other couple presentations that were very relevant for me was about creating an effective online orientation for students. Our students come to us from so many different preparatory \u201cplaces\u201d it is important to provide them information that is useful for those that need it and not force students to do work they do not need to do. Again the advice was provide information in a variety of formats. Pdf\u2019s with screenshots as well as screencasts were recommended. Also having students DO things in the LMS is important. Our plan is to assess them to find out where they truly are and then only make them work on the parts of the orientation they truly need.\n\n\nI did learn about a new\u00a0web-based\u00a0technology from YouSeeU that seems useful. It allows students to do presentations online rather than in the classroom. Students video themselves and sync with their\u00a0PowerPoint\u00a0slides. I like it because it has some rich feedback and rubric grading options. We are looking forward to their new feature this spring which includes an asynchronous way to ask oral exam questions which will be useful in our online courses.\n\nThe reality is that students generally do not stay with the university they start with and they can take courses virtually all over the world. They expect relevant and engaging experiences that prepare them for the 21st century work force. It is time to reinvent and update.\n\nCategories: classroom, software Tags: ,",

        "text":"A Wake-Up Call\n\nThere\u2019s an inherent danger in becoming good at what you do.\n\nYou get complacent.\n\nWe all do this. We master a task, skill or craft, and then we relax because we\u2019re churning out pretty decent work. Or, we get overwhelmed with other stuff and turn our attention elsewhere, believing that we can continue to do what we do so well, practically in our sleep.\n\nAnd it can be a very rude wake-up call when our work is rejected or criticised. The ego takes a hit, especially when it involves something we are passionate about and know we\u2019re good at.\n\nBut instead of taking it as a slap in the face (after all, you are a master at what you do, how dare anyone insult your magnificence!) take it \u2013 with a big huge heartfelt thank you. THANK your critics for pointing out that you\u2019ve become complacent, or that your skills aren\u2019t keeping up with the rest of the universe, or that you\u2019ve misdirected your time and energy and you\u2019re overwhelmed trying to do it all and your passion has slipped through the cracks.\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t notice it was happening, others did.\n\nWow, what a blessing, to be made aware!\n\nBusiness owners especially have so many hats to wear that we can forget to focus on what we\u2019re really good at. And by focus, I mean practice what we\u2019re good at. Keep learning, keep pushing, keep challenging. Never stand still as still water becomes stagnant very quickly. Don\u2019t let your skills become rusty through neglect. Keep yourself sharp, even if it means a financial hit of having to hire help so you can focus on your passion. In the end, the ROI is far greater if you do what you should be doing versus what you could delegate or outsource.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to swallow your pride when your work is rejected or criticised, but when you look beyond the emotions of the moment and you realise just how much of a blessing it is to be told that you could be doing something better\u2026 I hope you can see what a great opportunity you\u2019ve been offered to get your spark back!\n\nWhether you work for someone else or you\u2019re an entrepreneur, never believe yourself \u201cgood enough.\u201d Not only do you endanger your position or your business by becoming complacent, but you stagnate, and that\u2019s the worst kind of mental death. How boring, to be good at something you were good at in 1997. Be great at something in 2014! Reach higher!\n\n\nInspired by a post on: http:\/\/lifedev.net\/\n\nComments are closed.",

This was the first time the MMM Program would start in the summer, adding an extra quarter to our workload. The Masters in Engineering Management degree (a larger focus on Operations) was also changing to a Masters in Design Innovation (a larger focus on Product Innovation and Product Management).\n\nNow in our final week of this first quarter, preparing for finals and KWEST (Holland, here I come!), there is an excitement for what\u2019s next in our Design Thinking-focused curriculum. I am left with the four quotes above, playful reminders from each of our four classes this summer. Many in the MMM program are looking to be product-focused managers for the next steps of our careers, and I can already tell that the MMM program is going to be the perfect training ground for us to fine-tune the instincts needed to succeed at the next level of technology.\n\nFrom Professor Eyal Maoz showing just how easy it is to design an amazing product when you can reduce the \u201cdegrees of freedom\u201d to Professor Mark Werwath discussing how hard it can be to launch that product within organizations even when you have, our summer has simultaneously been a fruitful, stressful, and highly (ahem) social start (like visiting the super famous and soon-to-be-closed Hot Doug\u2019s with program mates \u2013 see photo above!

And then there's all the information (and \"information\") on the web... plenty enough to confuse me...\n\nTuesday, September 16, 2014\n\nArticle on a new\/old approach to teaching junior-high-level Chinese composition in Taiwan\n\nChen, Fangyu (\u9673\u82b3\u6bd3). \"Without Memorizing Model Essays or Sentences, Students are Taught to Write their own Stories\" (\u4e0d\u80cc\u7bc4\u6587\u4f73\u53e5\uff0c\u6559\u5b69\u5b50\u5beb\u51fa\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6545\u4e8b).

It was first given in 2014 to replace the senior high school entrance examination now that Taiwan has gone from a mandatory 9-year education system to a mandatory 12-year system, doing away with the need for a high school entrance exam. The new examination has been controversial, to say the least, but the purpose of this article isn't to criticize the test, but to describe the approach of one junior high school teacher, Zhou Tianyu (\u5468\u606c\u5b87), to helping students improve their writing--an approach that resulted in 84% of her students getting perfect marks on the Chinese writing portion of the exam, when nationwide, only 1.6% got perfect scores.\n\nZhou, a teacher at Taichung's Daya Junior High School, worked with her two classes of students for three years. Zhou emphasized being able to write from experience, and she tried to teach students to use their experiences in their responses to the exam prompts, which often were focused on personal experiences like \"the time I made my own decision\" (\u300c\u90a3\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u505a\u6c7a\u5b9a\u300d). Her approach to getting students more used to thinking and writing about their own experiences was to require them to keep a diary.\n\nIn addition to having students keep a diary every day, she had them watch videos like Malala's UN speech (in English, I assume, probably with Chinese subtitles) and read the novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (in translation, I assume). Then she would ask students to write about questions that connected these international issues and events to their own lives.The point seems to have been to give them practice seeing connections between their lives and the kinds of topics asked about in the exam questions.\n\nShe seems to have adopted some of her approach from Erin Gruwell's depiction in The Freedom Writers Diary of her own work with underprivileged students. The article mentions in several places Gruwell's book and the movie based on it. Interestingly, what Zhou is doing is being evaluated--in both the educational system and in this news article--for its effectiveness in regards to a very traditional writing task for Taiwanese students: passing a high-stakes timed essay exam. To that end, Zhou's approach to writing instruction also needs to take into consideration her students' need to be able to write quickly at the same time that they are able to write from their experiences. The article directly addresses this challenge in the following paragraph:\n68\u500b\u5b78\u751f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u600e\u9ebc\u6559\uff1f\u5c31\u50cf\u4f01\u696d\u4ee5\u6a19\u6e96\u4f5c\u696d\u6d41\u7a0b\u8a13\u7df4\u65b0\u9032\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u5468\u606c\u5b87\u4e5f\u8a2d\u4e0b\u5beb\u4f5c4\u6bb5\u6a19\u6e96\u4f5c\u696d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08SOP\uff09\uff1a\u7b2c1\u6bb5\u89e3\u984c\uff1b\u7b2c2\u6bb5\u5beb\u751f\u6d3b\u7d93\u9a57\uff1b\u7b2c3 \u6bb5\u5f15\u7533\u8ad6\u8ff0\uff1b\u7b2c4\u6bb5\u518d\u547c\u61c9\u9996\u6bb5\u505a\u7d50\u8ad6\u3002\u4e0a\u624b\u5f8c\uff0c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u597d\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u81ea\u7136\u6703\u6253\u7834\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u4e0a\u58d8\u3002\n\u00a0Roughly translated:\n\n[Zhou's] sixty-eight students write at different levels--how to teach them? Just like businesses that train their new employees in standard operating procedures, Zhou established a four-paragraph SOP: first paragraph, the opening; second paragraph, writing about personal experience; the third paragraph, extending the discussion; fourth paragraph, concluding by echoing the introductory paragraph. After practice, stronger students could break [go beyond] the framework, while regular students could safely \"get on base.\"\nInterestingly, the framework that she provides is similar (if not identical) to the traditional qi-cheng-zhuan-he (\u8d77\u627f\u8f49\u5408) four-part structure for Chinese essays. Zhou's perspective on providing a template seems similar to that of American teachers who use the five-paragraph essay framework when teaching primary or secondary students to write.*\n\nAs we can see then, although Zhou eschews the \"traditional\" approaches of requiring students to memorize model essays or \"beautiful sentences,\" she still provides them with a fairly fixed structure to plug their ideas into. This is distinguished, though, from the memorization\/imitation techniques that are often practiced in test-preparation cram schools because Zhou insists on students using their own ideas to fill in the the essays and not on memorization and imitation that she says would destroy students' interest in writing (\u5979\u8aaa\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u56fa\u7136\u80fd\u57f9\u990a\u6587\u5b78\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u5beb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u624d\u4e0d\u6703\u627c\u6bba\u5b78\u7fd2\u8208\u8da3\u3002).\n\nThere are other things I could mention about her technique, such as how she marks the students' writing (the article says she spends three hours a day correcting their lexical and grammatical mistakes). The one thing that I want to focus on in the end, though, goes back to the point I found most fascinating about Zhou's approach--her use of non-Chinese works as springboards for students' writing. In the past, I hadn't heard of other secondary school Chinese teachers in Taiwan who used materials from other countries, like Malala's speech or A Thousand Splendid Suns, as sources. Usually, students have been required to read (and memorize?) texts from China--classical texts in particular, though not exclusively. (I don't have time right now to find sources to support this; I'll try to add something here later--if anyone has any thoughts, please comment.)\n\nI'm tempted to call this aspect of her teaching a translingual or transcultural approach to teaching Chinese writing in the sense that she brings in experiences and texts that cross linguistic and cultural barriers, indirectly showing students that to write in Chinese doesn't require one to operate only within the linguistic and cultural borders of Chinese.\n\n*See David Cahill's 2003 article in Written Communication for more on the qi-cheng-zhuan-he structure; he focuses in particular on how the zhuan, or \"turn,\" as it has often been translated, has been overemphasized and misinterpreted in Western contrastive rhetoric studies, effectively making Chinese writing seem more discursively alien to Western readers than it really is.\n\nFriday, September 12, 2014\n\nSecond week of class\n\nThursday marked the end for students to be able to add classes. As I thought would happen, the populations of my three classes changed a few times before then. As late as yesterday, three students were added to my \"small\" class, almost filling it. That class also has a move diverse population, too, in terms of majors, so we'll be able to do more interdisciplinary work.\n\nFriday, September 05, 2014\n\nSpeaking of Tunghai...\n\nI see that ten years ago around this time (the beginning of the semester), I was planning a Research Methods course for sophomore English majors in which I was going to have them \"examine critically the history and politics of plagiarism while at the same time trying to teach them not to plagiarize.\" Hmmm... wonder how that worked out...\n\nFirst week of classes over\n\nWe had a short week this week because classes started on Wednesday, but at least I got a chance to meet (most of) my students. During this week it's a little hard to get into the serious work of the semester because class populations can change a lot. I have two classes that are full, but one is still filling up. (Well, it's about half full right now--or half empty?)\n\nThat smaller class is going to be interesting, too, because its focus is on interdisciplinarity, but most of the students are engineering majors. (Probably because of scheduling issues.) I suppose that I can consider civil engineering and electrical engineering as different disciplines, though, even though they're in the same college.\n\nI've given the classes some small assignments for over the weekend; we'll see how they do on those. The two sections of interdisciplinary writing are reading John Swales' chapter on discourse communities (from his 1990 book, Genre Analysis).\n\nI plan for us to talk Monday about discourse communities and disciplinarity. We'll see how it goes! Later on we'll be reading a more recent chapter about discourse communities by Anne Johns. In the business writing course, they'll be brainstorming possible topics for their first project, a research report on a \"hot\" topic in their discipline\/profession.\n\nIt was really hot in Boston this week, and one of the classrooms that I have two classes in was particularly sauna-like. I think the air conditioning didn't work. It reminded me of the good old days when I taught at Tunghai's College of Arts building--I remember that during the first couple of weeks of classes, there would be sweat dripping from my forehead when I was teaching. Hopefully they'll fix the air con before Monday!",

        "text":"Sunday, September 06, 2009\n\nA Beginner's Guide To Medical School\n\nWelcome Class of 2013! By now most of you are a few weeks into the medical school experience. Hopefully you have had time to settle into your new surroundings, make some new friends, and perhaps learn a thing or two.\n\nYou may have also noticed that medical school requires a different approach to studying. The way I look at it, to get into medical school, you had to be broadly talented, doing well in many subjects and perhaps especially well in one or two. The emphasis was more on being able to apply knowledge and problem solve (remember all those orgo and physics problem sets? Yea... ) However, the emphasis shifts drastically in medical school: it is simply an issue of rote memorization now. A person with photographic memory but no prior science background would likely be at the top of any medical school class, at least during the pre-clinical years. Another way to look at it is the information you are now expected to know is an oceanwide but only an inch deep.\n\nHow does one manage to internalize all this information in the short span of two years? I think the main thing (which I wish I had picked up on earlier) is learning from a clinical perspective and utilizing the advice of those that have gone before you heavily. Unlike prior educational experiences, there is much to be gained in medical school from talking to upperclassmen about specific courses and what is truly important down the road. For example, our infectious disease class spent a lot of time categorizing different viruses into single stranded or double stranded, positive or negative, and other features. However, these barely showed up on the test. And, from a clinical perspective this makes sense: the molecular features of the agents is only relevant to the virologists; the clinician could care less.\n\nThinking clinically is one of the keys to doing well in the pre-clinical years, especially if your test is being written by a clinician. The next few posts will serve to help first year medical students with various first year queries, such as which books are most helpful to first years, regardless of your med school or coursework. Good luck!\n\nTo make sure you don't miss a post, follow Scrub Notes on Twitter or subscribe using a reader.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"Archives for category: Administrators, superintendents\n\nJack Ross of California-based Capital & Main posed the question: Will Alberto Carvalho, who was recently hired away from Miami-Dade public schools to become the new superintendent of the Los Angeles public schools, expand the number of charter schools in L.A.?\n\nAt Carvalho\u2019s first press conference, the first question to him was about where he stood on charter schools. This issue has prompted billionaires like the late Eli Broad, Michael Bloomberg, and Reed Hastings of Netflix to pour millions into school board races. The current board has a 4-3 pro-charter majority.\n\nRoss wrote:\n\nSo where does Carvalho stand? During his 13 year tenure in the Sunshine State, the number of charter schools in the south Florida district rose from 65 to 145 (while more than 30 charter schools also closed). More campuses were converted into magnet programs offering specialized education in subjects like robotics, computer science or performing arts: In 2010, around 41,000 Miami students attended magnets, and by 2019 that number had risen to more than 72,000. The Miami magnets, however, are operated by the school district and not by private owners. \u201cI have always been a proponent, and dramatically expanded, publicly offered, accountable choice in Miami-Dade public schools,\u201d Carvalho said at his press conference, referring to his investment in public magnet schools. \u201cIn Florida, charter schools are enabled by Florida statute, and school boards, by and large, do not have great latitude in the approval of charter programs.\u201d\n\nCarvalho liked the story so much that he tweeted it with a comment:\n\nAlberto M. Carvalho@MiamiSup\nPublicly accountable choice, under the leadership of representative boards, that serve all children, regardless of their diverse abilities, not profits, is a model that has worked well. Will L.A.\u2019s New Superintendent Expand Charter Schools? @capitalandmain\n\nRight below Carvalho\u2019s tweet was a response from Carol Burris, executive director of the Network for Public Education.\n\nOpposed to for-profit @miamiSup? Why did largest for- profit Academica more than double # of schools in your district?\n\nAcademica is a huge for-profit chain based in Florida that is unusually avaricious and highly political.\n\nThe board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has hired Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of the schools in Miami-Dade, too PPP become superintendent of the Los Angeles. Carvalho has served in Miami as superintendent since 2008. Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to hire him in New York City in 2018, but Carvalho backed out after the appointment was announced.\n\nAlberto Carvalho, who has led Miami-Dade County Public Schools since 2008 and is among the nation\u2019s most experienced and admired school district leaders, has been named the next superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, district officials announced Thursday.\n\nThe Board of Education made the announcement after a special, closed meeting. In recent weeks board members have interviewed and deliberated over candidates in a series of closed sessions.\n\nIn coming to L.A. Unified, Carvalho, 57, moves from heading the fourth-largest K-12 public school system in the country to the second-largest, taking on one of the highest-profile and most challenging posts in public education\u2026\n\nBorn in Portugal, he came to the U.S. at age 17. Carvalho learned English as a young adult and quickly worked his way up from construction and restaurant jobs as he attended Broward Community College. He later won a scholarship to Barry University and enrolled on a premed track. He excelled academically, but took a hard turn in his career path when, in his mid-20s, he interviewed for a teaching position at Miami Jackson Senior High. He was offered a job the same day, a Tampa Bay Times profile reported in 2019.\n\nAfter four years in the classroom \u2014 teaching physics, chemistry and calculus \u2014 he became an assistant principal. The superintendent at the time was so impressed that he brought Carvalho to work downtown without his having been a principal. Carvalho oversaw federal programs and later became the district\u2019s chief communications officer. He gained further experience by overseeing grant administration and lobbying state officials.\n\nUnder Supt. Rudy Crew, Carvalho launched several initiatives, including a Parent Academy and a School Improvement Zone, focusing on schools with low academic achievement.\n\nAfter becoming superintendent, Carvalho eventually filled a gap in his resume, serving as a principal. He put himself at the helm of a new campus called iPrep Academy, a pre-kindergarten-to-12th-grade magnet school \u201cdesigned to promote respect and responsibility among the students and staff,\u201d according to its website. All students are required to take honors classes.\n\nJan Resseger is puzzled that Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot selected San Antonio Superintendent Pedro Martinez to lead Chicago\u2019s public schools. His experience and views overlap with those of Arne Duncan, for whom he served as Chief Financial Officer. Parents and teachers wanted the next superintendent to be an instructional leader. Martinez has no experience as a teacher or a principal. He represents the failed ideas of corporate reform. Twenty years of test score driven decisions\u2014closing schools and replacing them with charter schools\u2014 should be enough.\n\nShe writes:\n\nFor WBEZ, Chicago\u2019s best education reporter, Sarah Karp introduces Pedro Martinez: \u201cTurning to a non-educator with deep Chicago ties, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot named former Chicago schools official and a current San Antonio schools superintendent Pedro Martinez as the next CEO of Chicago Public Schools. Martinez, who was born in Mexico and raised in Chicago, will be the first permanent Latino leader in the school district\u2019s history\u2026 Martinez worked as CPS\u2019 chief financial officer under former CEO Arne Duncan\u2026 Martinez is an accountant who has been called \u2018analytics heavy.\u2019 And in San Antonio, he has expanded charter schools as well as partnered with private organizations to take over failing schools. These ideas have been popular in Chicago, but they have fallen out of favor in recent years\u2026 Martinez has never taught or run a school as principal. And, thus, in choosing him, Lightfoot is rejecting the input of parents and others who said they wanted someone with a strong instructional background with \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 experience\u2026 Martinez is a graduate of the Broad Superintendent Academy training program. Critics say the Broad Academy promotes school leaders who use corporate-management techniques and that they work to limit teachers\u2019 job protections and the involvement of parents in decision-making.\u201d\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot selected Pedro Martinez, Superintendent of the San Antonio School District, as the Windy City\u2019s public schools.\n\nMartinez is a \u201creformer.\u201d In San Antonio, he was known for his obsession with data and commitment to opening charter schools. He is a graduate of the tattered Broad Superintendents Academy. He is chairman of Jeb Bush\u2019s Chiefs for Change. Chiefs for Change brings together superintendents who share the test-and-punish ideas of the failed corporate reform movement (closing low-scoring schools, opening charter schools, relying on high-stakes testing, evaluating teachers by test scores, collecting data about everything, distrust of unions, etc.).\n\nMartinez is a graduate of the Chicago Public Schools. He holds an M.B.A. from DePaul University and a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And, of course, he is a graduate of the Broad Superintendents Academy. He worked for Arne Duncan as Chief Financial Officer when Arne was Superintendent in Chicago. He was \u201cSuperintendent-in-Residence\u201d for the Nevada Department of Education. Prior to that, he was superintendent for the 64,000-student Washoe County School District, covering the Reno, Nevada area.\n\nLike Arne, Martinez was never a teacher or principal.\n\nIn the education world, currently controlled by a coalition of billionaires and the rightwing think tanks and legislators they finance, public schools have some valuable friends. Among them are the National Superintendents Roundtable and the Schlechty Center. If your school board is looking for a new superintendent who believes in public schools, these are the go-to sources. They are the anti-Broadies. Since James Harvey, the Director of the National Superintents Roundtable is retiring, the two organizations are merging. Jim Harvey is a member of the board of the Network for Public Education.\n\nHere is their press release:\n\nThe National Superintendents Roundtable will merge with the Schlechty Center this fall\n\nSeattle, WA \u2013 The National Superintendents Roundtable and the Schlechty Center have entered into a partnership to merge on September 30, 2021, bringing two veteran, non-profit organizations together under one roof to better serve school superintendents. The Schlechty Center will provide a legacy home to the National Superintendents Roundtable after its founder, Dr. James Harvey, retires at the end of the year.\n\nBoth organizations have spent decades delivering professional development and strengthening relationships among superintendents. The Roundtable, the successor to a Danforth Foundation network established in 1992, has operated since 2006; the Schlechty Center was founded in 1988 and its Superintendents Leadership Network was established in 1997. Both organizations believe fiercely in the value of public education.\n\nThe National Superintendents Roundtable and the Schlechty Center\u2019s Superintendents Leadership Network will maintain their own names, membership, and programming, with opportunities for superintendents to join in some activities together.\n\n\u201cThe Roundtable is delighted to become part of the Schlechty Center. There is great synergy between the two organizations. Dr. Phillip Schlechty was one of the giants of American public edu... (truncated)",

        "text":"Wednesday, June 9, 2010\n\nIdeas To Inspire Technology Greatness!\n\nTeachers ask me all the time for technology ideas on a wide variety of subject areas. Some days I can get 30 questions from 30 different teachers but they all might be asking the same sort of question. One day it might be questions on how to use Google Earth and the next it might be all Smartboard questions. It sure would be helpful to have list of easy ways that these tools can be used in the classroom.\u00a0\n\nMark Warner has created a site that does just that. (The idea came from another teacher named Tom Barrett. He collaborated with over 100 teachers to get ideas on all these topics.) Using some Google Presentations teachers can see how various technologies can be used in the classroom. He has included presentations on a wide range of topics including Interactive Whiteboards, Netbooks, Twitter, Google Earth, Google Docs, Webcams, and more. There is also some really good information on curriculum topics like math, science, writing, art and music.\nHere is one on 43 Interesting Ways To Use A Pocket Video Camera In The Classroom\n\nHere is another on Using Gaming In The Classroom\n\nEach presentation gives teachers several ideas on ways to use the specific technology in their classroom or ways technology can support the specific content area. The presentations are short and offer some really good ideas. I guarantee that you will learn at least one new way to do something in your classroom, if not more. So head over to\nThe Ideas To Inspire Website and learn how other educators are using these tools in their classroom.\nblog comments powered by Disqus",

        "text":"Start 2010 Resolved\n\nWelcome to 2010!\n\nNow that it is here, what are you going to do with it?\n\nBecause I am a goal-oriented person, I don\u2019t make a whole lot of resolutions on January 1st. I am making new goals and taking new actions all year long. But this is a perfect time to reflect on the last year and to outline rules to guide your activities in the coming year. The top two on my list in 2010 are:\n\nSelf Discipline\n\nSelf discipline is the foundation of all success, regardless of the endeavor. I am a disciplined individual (and all disciplined people wish they were more disciplined), but I am going to use 2010 to increase and improve my personal will and self discipline. Self discipline is about keeping the promises one makes to oneself. It is the cornerstone of personal and professional development. And it is the one attribute that all other attributes are built upon.\n\nIsn\u2019t self-discipline what \u201cresolved\u201d really means? I am going to spend a lot of time working on and writing about self-discipline in 2010.\n\nPassionate Engagement\n\nAnother observation I have made over the past couple years is the difference in the performance of those who are passionately engaged in what they are doing and those who dabble. The highest performers aren\u2019t a little more passionate or a little more engaged. The highest performers bring a shockingly higher level of passion and engagement to what they do. They don\u2019t waste time simply going through the motions. Instead, they bring their whole self to each and every endeavor. They commit to being there, completely absorbed in the activity, whatever it may be.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be passionately engaged sometimes, especially when you are doing something that is new to you. It\u2019s much harder to bring that same passionate engagement to the basic activities that most of us\u00a0 do on auto-pilot and with little thought or engagement.\n\nThose are my two driving rules for 2010? What are yours?\n\n\nWhat are you resolved to do in 2010?\n\nWho are you resolved to be in 2010?\n\nWhat are the attributes that you have to possess in order to be who you have to be?\n\nFiled under: Success\n\nTagged with:\n\n[if lte IE 8]\n[if lte IE 8]\n\nShare this page with your network",
