He discovered the female during the first night of Wimmera Catchment Management Authority surveys in the MacKenzie River with a hair tie wrapped around her neck.\n\nJosh says if they hadn't removed the hair tie, she would have died in the next couple of weeks.\nJosh and Queensland PhD student Tamielle Blunt spent three nights in the Grampians for the CMA's annual monitoring of a small, fragile platypus population in late April. The monitoring is part of measuring the impacts of environmental flows which are released into the river.\n\"She had quite a deep wound from where the tie had been rubbing, and was showing signs of poor condition as a result.\n\n\"She was a new juvenile, probably around six months old, so we were thankful to have captured her and get the opportunity to remove the hair tie. She swam off happily when we released her back into the river.\"\n\nJosh says although they often discover rubbish items tangled around platypus around Melbourne, it is the first time they'd ever seen anything like this in the Wimmera surveys.\n\n\"Being a more isolated area, we don't find a lot of rubbish in the MacKenzie River. This shows how something so simple like a hair tie washing into a waterway can impact on our precious wildlife.\"\nJosh discovered another female platypus they hadn't caught before during his second night of surveys.\u00a0\nLocal identity Paul Carracher and his daughter Maddie were there to witness this capture and Josh named the new platypus Maddie.\n\nHeavy rain washed out the surveys on the third night.\n\nWimmera CMA chief executive David Brennan says results are encouraging, with the discovery of two new female platypuses indicating flows in the upper section of the MacKenzie River are having a positive impact.\n\n\"We have all become attached to this small and fragile platypus population, and we have given them names including Dusty, Amber, Ted, Max and Kenzie and now Maddie. It's especially exciting when we discover new females who will be able to breed and further grow this small population.\n\n\"Environmental flows we target to this area will play an important role in maintaining habitat during dry conditions to help keep this population going.\"\n\nJosh also took eDNA samples in the lower section of the MacKenzie River where natural flows from rain last winter and spring, combined with environmental flows, have improved conditions.\n\n\"This section of the river is looking in really good condition at the moment and we're hoping the eDNA results will show that the platypus population has moved further downstream,\" Josh says. \"We haven't captured platypus in this section of the river before via our survey nets, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The eDNA test is highly sensitive and is a much more efficient method for discovering platypus.\"\nEnvironmental water releases in the MacKenzie River are prioritised as part of the Victorian Environmental Water Holder's Seasonal Watering Plan 2016-17 , which aims to improve river and wetland health across the state.\n\nPhotos by Paul Carracher, The Weekly Advertiser\n\nFurther Information\n\nWimmera CMA\nTel: 03 5382 1544\n\nMore News\n\n  \u2022 Vinifera floodplain\n\n    Water for Vinifera\n\n    Water for the environment is being delivered to Vinifera during April and May to support the many waterbirds, microbats, frogs, sugar gliders and wallabies that live on or visit the floodplain.\n\n  \u2022 Working together to bring water to the Moorabool River\n\n    To help combat dry conditions and improve river health and habitat for native fish, the Victorian Environmental Water Holder has secured an additional one-off volume of water for the environment for the Moorabool River.\n\n  \u2022 Update - Water sale in northern Victoria\n\n    The VEWH announced the sale of up to 10 gigalitres of allocation in northern Victoria on 15 March 2019.

        "text":"Microstructure characterization and bulk properties of disordered two-phase media\n\nResearch output: Contribution to journalArticle\n\n91 Scopus citations\n\n\nA general formalism is developed to statistically characterize the microstructure of porous and other composite media composed of inclusions (particles) distributed throughout a matrix phase (which, in the case of porous media, is the void phase). This is accomplished by introducing a new and general n-point distribution function Hn and by deriving two series representations of it in terms of the probability density functions that characterize the configuration of particles; quantities that, in principle, are known for the ensemble under consideration. In the special case of an equilibrium ensemble, these two equivalent but topologically different series for the Hn are generalizations of the Kirkwood-Salsburg and Mayer hierarchies of liquid-state theory for a special mixture of particles described in the text. This methodology provides a means of calculating any class of correlation functions that have arisen in rigorous bounds on transport properties (e.g., conductivity and fluid permeability) and mechanical properties (e.g., elastic moduli) for nontrivial models of two-phase disordered media. Asymptotic and bounding properties of the general function Hn are described. To illustrate the use of the formalism, some new results are presented for the Hn and it is shown how such information is employed to compute bounds on bulk properties for models of fully penetrable (i.e., randomly centered) spheres, totally impenetrable spheres, and spheres distributed with arbitrary degree of impenetrability. Among other results, bounds are computed on the fluid permeability, for assemblages of impenetrable as well as penetrable spheres, with heretofore unattained accuracy.\n\nOriginal languageEnglish (US)\nPages (from-to)843-873\nNumber of pages31\nJournalJournal of Statistical Physics\nIssue number5-6\nStatePublished - Dec 1 1986\nExternally publishedYes\n\nAll Science Journal Classification (ASJC) codes\n\n  \u2022 Statistical and Nonlinear Physics\n  \u2022 Mathematical Physics\n\n\n  \u2022 Disordered media\n  \u2022 Kirkwood-Salsburg equations\n  \u2022 Mayer equations\n  \u2022 composite and porous materials\n  \u2022 effective conductivity\n  \u2022 elastic moduli\n  \u2022 fluid permeability\n  \u2022 liquids\n  \u2022 microstructure\n  \u2022 n-point distribution functions\n  \u2022 scaled-particle theory\n\nFingerprint Dive into the research topics of 'Microstructure characterization and bulk properties of disordered two-phase media'.

But as if chasing unknown animals wasn't enough, we are involved in education, conservation, and good old-fashioned natural history!

The daily newsblog is edited by Corinna Downes, head administratrix of the CFZ, and the indexing is done by Lee Canty and Kathy Imbriani. There is regular news from the CFZ Mystery Cat study group, and regular fortean bird news from 'The Watcher of the Skies'.

Doug is a very entertaining speaker, and the book is excellent, so if you happen to be in the Denver area, be sure to attend.\u00a0 If not, stay tuned for more information about wolverine events across the West this winter and spring, including opportunities to learn more about tracking and reporting track sightings, as well as a chance to participate in tracking field trips, with Jason Wilmot of NRCC and the Absaroka-Beartooth Project.\n\nTo whet your appetite for wolverine information, check out Conservation Media\u2019s new short film on the Wolverine Foundation\u2019s work, featuring an interview with Jeff Copeland \u2013\u00a0 a nice three-minute synopsis of what TWF does, and why wolverines are amazing. It\u2019s great to see more multi-media information out there.\n\nAnd speaking of tracks, here\u2019s a post from Conservation Media from back in April, 2010, documenting a sighting of wolverine tracks crossing a highway in Montana. Note the inclusion of the author\u2019s hand for scale, and the multiple photos of individual tracks as well as the gait \u2013 including some great shots of the distinctive three-by gait. This is excellent documentation. I thought I\u2019d bring it to the attention of any citizen scientists out there, as an example of how to photograph wolverine tracks in a way that can be considered verified.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

This project seeks to explore the extent to which narrow oceanic straits present barriers to gene flow. We are using a multi-locus data set to estimate changes in effective population size over time and patterns of gene flow. Coupled with the niche modeling data shown below, we can generate testable models of bat evolutionary history in the Bahamas using coalescent simulations. These simulations will allow us to determine which evolutionary models are most likely to produce the kinds of molecular data we observe in modern bats. This also allows us to predict how future climate change might affect Bahamian bat populations.\n\nCB_nichemod.jpgCaribbean Niche Modeling\n\nEcological niche models are routinely used to not only generate predicted distributions for species at the present time, but they are also used to generate past species distributions (e.g., those at the last glacial maximum). There has been a disturbing absence of testing to determine the degree to which these models accurately predict the past distribution of species. We are using the bat species of the Bahamas as a test case whereby we are generating predictive models of species distribution using various methods and testing their accuracy based on the fossil record of bats from the Caribbean. This study involves considerable field collection, computational effort (niche modeling), and molecular data analysis (to define taxonomic boundaries for niche modeling).",

        "text":"Implementation of a Geometric-Error Correction System for Extremely High Probe Position Accuracy in Spherical Near-Field Scanning\n\nAuthors:Scott Pierce, James Langston\nPublication: AMTA 2004\nCopyright Owner: NSI-MI Technologies\n\nIn this paper, we describe a new method for improving the true-position accuracy of a very large, spherical near-field measurement system. The mechanical positioning subsystem consists of 10-meter diameter, 180\u00b0 circular-arc scanner and an MI Technologies MI-51230 azimuth rotator and position controller.\n\nThe principle components of the error correction method are the error measurement system, the position correction algorithm, and a pair of very high precision, mechanical error correction stages. Using a tracking laser interferometer, error maps are constructed for radial, planar and elevation errors. A position correction algorithm utilizes these discrete-point error maps to generate error correction terms over the continuous range of the elevation axis. The small position correction motions required in the radial and planar directions are performed using the mechanical correction stages. Corrections to the position of the elevation axis are made using the primary elevation axis drive.\n\nResults are presented that show the geometry of the spherical scanning system before and after error correction. It is observed that the accuracy of the radial, planar and elevation axes can be significantly improved using the error correction system.\n\n\n\n1125 Satellite Blvd., Suite 100\nSuwanee, GA 30024 USA\n\n+1 678 475 8300\n+1 678 542 2601\n\nLos Angeles\n\n19730 Magellan Dr.\nTorrance, CA 90502 USA\n\n+1 310 525 7000\n+1 310 525 7100\n\n\nUnit 51 Harley Rd.\nSheffield, S11 9SE UK\n\n+44 7493 235224\n\n\nVirtual Conference Finding your local time... 25 Days\n\nLatest Tweets\n\nThis site is using cookies for analytical purposes and to provide a better user experience.

RNA, like the structurally similar DNA, is a chain made up of subunits called nucleotides. In protein synthesis, messenger RNA (mRNA) replicates the DNA code for a protein and moves to sites in the cell called ribosomes. There, transfer RNA (tRNA) assembles amino acids to form the protein specified by the messenger RNA. Most forms of RNA (including messenger and transfer RNA) consist of a single nucleotide strand, but a few forms of viral RNA that function as carriers of genetic information (instead of DNA) are double-stranded. 2.

        "text":"Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate: Modeling, Fabrication, and Nonlinear-Optical Performance\n\n\nPeriodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) has become the nonlinear-optical material of choice in many infrared optical parametric oscillators (OPO's) due to its high nonlinearity, readily engineered tuning characteristics, and repeatable fabrication. The domain periods required for these OPO's are typically between 15 um and 30 um, and are made by a process already well developed. The domain periods required for visible light applications are typically between 3 um and 10 um, and are more difficult to fabricate repeatably. The focus of this research was to understand the nature of this difficulty, to develop strategies for repeatable device fabrication, and to demonstrate the nonlinear optical performance of the material.\n\nThis thesis presents a model of the periodic-poling process in lithium niobate, a repeatable PPLN-fabrication process developed using this model, and the nonlinear-optical performance of PPLN fabricated with this process. The model combines ferroelectric properties of the material, measured as part of this research, with the electrostatics of periodic electrodes. The fabrication process developed using the model was used to periodically pole two 75-mm-diameter wafers of 500-um-thick LiNbO3 with a 6.5 um domain period. These wafers yielded 53-mm-long samples, more than five times the length previously reported. Second harmonic generation experiments performed with these samples produced 2.7 watts of 532 nm radiation output with 6.5 watts of continuous-wave 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser radiation input, corresponding to a record 42% single-pass conversion efficiency. These samples were also used to operate the first reported continuous-wave 532-nm-pumped PPLN-based singly-resonant OPO, with a record-low 0.93-watt threshold (relative to other 532-nm-pumped OPO's), 56% conversion efficiency, and continuous tuning from 917-1266 nm. Finally, data are presented that indicate the presence of 532-nm-induced 1064-nm absorption.\n\n\nGregory David Miller\n\n\nJuly, 1998",

Transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2, are quasi-2D materials that can vary electronically from semiconductors to metallic-like conductors, with some displaying superconductivity and charge density wave behaviors. MX2 materials consist of X-M-X layers where the metal centers are in an octahedral or trigonal prismatic configuration.1-2 Transition metal trichalcogenides, MX3, exhibit lower dimensionality structurally as quasi-1D materials consisting of MX6 trigonal prismatic chains. They do, however, show similar electronic properties including metallic-like conductivity, superconductivity, and charge density waves. These properties depend on orientation of the MX chains in the unit cell which changes depending on the metal and chalcogenide.3-4\n\nFor future electronics applications, it is important to understand the synthesis, characterization, manipulation and properties of MX2 and MX3 materials at the nanoscale. This talk focuses on the oxidative behavior of two important MX2\u2019s, 1T-TiSe2 and 1T-TaSe2, as well as the synthesis and exfoliation behavior of a metallic MX3, TaSe3. The oxidation of 1T-TiSe2 and 1T-TaSe2 resulted in the onset of oxidation near 300 \u00b0C for both MX2\u2019s. Under a critical temperature, 400 \u00b0C for 1T-TiSe2 and 700 \u00b0C for 1T-TaSe2, a self-limiting, surface oxidation was observed, analogous to previous studies with WSe2.5 TaSe3 was also successfully synthesized and characterized with special attention paid to the chemical exfoliation behavior and crystallinity. Partial exfoliation was achieved leading to highly crystalline belts6-7 up to several microns in length and reaching a minimum width of ~5 nm.\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lieth, R.

From the mid-1950s to 1986, almost 69 million acres of natural habitat was converted to urban or suburban areas (Grey and Deneke, 1986). From 2000 to 2010, urban (urban + suburban) area in the United States increased by 12% each year (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). In 2012, over 80% of the U.S. population lived in urban areas (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Construction of homes and buildings often leads to a loss of natural vegetation (Blubaugh et al., 2011), which is often replaced with turfgrass systems (Tallamy, 2007). Public policies and local housing regulations impose guidelines to maintain aesthetic property values, which often influence homeowners\u2019 needs to maintain lawns (Jenkins, 1994). However, arguably the most influential is the social pressure from neighbors who often ensure enforcement of lawn regulations, to which homeowners often conform (Byrne, 2005).\n\nThere are an estimated 40 million acres of nonnative grass lawns in the United States, covering almost 2% of land, making it the largest irrigated monoculture plant system in the country (Milesi et al., 2005; Tallamy, 2007). Lawns are often high-input systems, requiring significant amounts of time, monetary, and chemical investments to maintain aesthetic property value (Robbins et al., 2001). The prevalence of turf cover throughout the United States and a low tolerance for weed and insect pests coincides with an increase in the use of synthetic chemicals (Alumai et al., 2008). Conventional lawn management strategies are calendar-based applications of synthetic chemical inputs of fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides (Alumai et al., 2008; Bormann et al., 1993) and have been associated with environmental pollution and human health risks [Robbins and Sharp, 2003a; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 1999]. As a result, strategies using integrated pest management (IPM) or \u201corganic\u201d practices have garnered increased attention as management alternatives (Alumai et al., 2008).\n\nSome individual consumers and public institutions have adopted alternative lawn management strategies, which have been promoted as a way to prevent potential negative environmental consequences of the overuse or misuse of pesticides (Henderson et al., 1998). The growing interest in lawn management alternatives has led to changes in public policies which ban the use of cosmetic pesticide applications and favor the adoption of lawn alternatives (Vickers, 2006), including organically managed green spaces (Alumai et al., 2008).\n\nAlthough organic management programs are offered as an alternative to traditional lawn care, their impact on arthropod diversity and pest management is poorly understood. A goal of commercial IPM or organic management is to enhance the overall aesthetic quality of lawns, which includes suppression of pests that invade turf (Alumai et al., 2008). Since little is known about the effects of organic lawn management on arthropod communities, this article reviews literature pertinent to organic lawn care, highlighting studies that have assessed the effects of turf variety and management practices on insect communities. To put this information into context, the article begins with an assessment of what organic lawn management means and the history of public policy regarding its implementation in North America.\n\nDefining Organic Lawn Management\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines organic agriculture as \u201c\u2026 an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, and enhance ecological harmony\u201d (USDA, 1995). The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) administers and publishes organic regulations with input from the public and the National Organic Standards Board. Before being certified as organic, farms must undergo a 3-year transition period in which organic production practices are followed, and documentation must be provided that no unapproved products or practices were used in the production system. Producers must then submit an application and fees to a USDA-accredited certifying agent (state departments of agriculture or private organizations). After an on-site inspection and review of the application indicate the producer is in compliance with USDA organic regulations, the certifying agent will issue an organic certificate. Producers are required to provide annual updates to the certifying agent, who performs an annual inspection to ensure USDA regulations are still being met.\n\nExcept for cases where turf is grown commercially for sod or seed production, lawns are not agricultural commodities and so their management is not regulated other than by local municipal and homeowner association aesthetic rules. Because there has been no groundswell of support for consistent definitions of organic lawn management and accompanying regulations like for agricultural commodities, there is no national definition or regulation of organic lawn care. This article refers to organic lawn management with the understanding that there are many varying definitions.\n\nRelevant Public Policy in North America\n\nGrassroots organizations throughout North America are pushing institutions as well as local and regional governments to restrict the use of pesticides and adopt organic or similar management policies for public spaces. These changes are being made primarily because of perceived public health concerns, even though the conse... (truncated)",
