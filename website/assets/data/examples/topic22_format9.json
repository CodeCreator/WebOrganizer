Leave enough time to reach your destination at a proper speed.\n\n  \u2022 Avoid quick starts and sudden stops. This wastes fuel, is harder on vehicle components and increases the odds of an accident.\n\n  \u2022 Routinely maintain your vehicle. Keep the tires inflated, moving components lubricated and ignition and emission systems operating properly.\n\n  \u2022 Lighten the load. Do not haul extra weight in the passenger compartment, trunk or cargo area of your vehicle.\n\n  \u2022 Check your vehicle's owners manual on whether your vehicle needs premium or mid-grade fuel and, if not, purchase less expensive regular unleaded gas.\n\n  \u2022 Shop for low gasoline prices locally but don't waste gas driving to a distant filling station to save a few cents.\n\nSource: AAA\n\nThe Herald-Mail Articles",

        "text":"5 Ways For Cars Of The Future To Improve\n\nOK, so automobiles have come a heck of a long way since their inception back in the late 19th century \u2013 that\u2019s a given. When you think that our great, great granddads had nothing but horses to pull their carriages, we really have made some incredible advancements. If that was still the case now it would take me three hours just to get down to Craven Cottage to watch my beloved Fulham FC \u2013 and I live in the centre of London! These days I can complete that journey in a cool 22 minutes (I timed myself) if I put my foot down in the 3 Series and traffic is optimum.carriage\n\nAnyway, like I was saying, sure technology has improved at an alarming rate, but has it really changed that much over the past say 30 years (my lifetime)?\n\nIn my opinion it has not, but for fancy cabin equipment such as Bluetooth connectivity and satellite navigation. Who even needs those features? Get a map for Pete\u2019s sake! For the real car enthusiasts out there like me, you\u2019ll know that driving itself is virtually the same as it was back in 1983. In fact, if anything it\u2019s worse \u2013 there\u2019s too much traffic on the roads and too many sets of lights to stop at. So here it is, 5 ways in which I believe (and hope) that future generations of cars can be improved.nosatnav\n\nMake them faster\n\nI know I\u2019m not alone when I say that cars these days are too slow. I propose that by 2040 all vehicle should be equipped with engines which are a minimum of 7.5 litres in size. The government should implement a system like the autobahn, so speed junkies like me can hit 300mph. If you do wish to go that fast, I\u2019d look to buy your life insurance sooner rather than later.\n\nMake them bigger\n\nEverybody is trying to create cars where there\u2019s barely enough room to breathe. No, I don\u2019t want a Kia Picanto \u2013 if I wanted to feel claustrophobic I\u2019d sit in a cupboard. In fact there\u2019s probably more space in my cupboard. And it travels at about the same speed as a Picanto. If you have a Kia I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve offended\u2026.. No I\u2019m not! Get of my site and go to BuyYourKia or something, you ain\u2019t welcome here!\n\nMake them more durable\n\nGranted, not everybody wants an off-road 4\u00d74, but cars of the present time buckle under the smallest amount of pressure. A 2mph impact leaves your insurance paying out thousands of pounds. Cars should have big durable bumpers. It would save money on servicing and MOT costs too.\n\nMake them comfier\n\nI can\u2019t stand normal car seats, I have to have leather and I cannot understand anybody who doesn\u2019t have this exact same view. I am tired of having to replace the seats in every vehicle I buy with ones with which my delicate posture is compatible with. Leather is better. Fact. So make it standard.\n\nGive them wings?\nFair enough, this one\u2019s a little crazy \u2013 even for me! But wouldn\u2019t it be just fabulous if one day in the not too distant future, we could zip into the air like the proverbial eagle from its nest, as and when we wanted to? If the powers that be are reading this blog, please, think of a way that we can make this happen!\n\nOver and out.\n\nComments are closed.",

        "text":"Top Nine 3-Wheel Electric Scooters in 2021\n\n\nMany people prefer a 3 wheel scooter of a 4 wheel or vice versa.\u00a0 It ultimately depends on what needs the user wants or needs.\u00a0 When you have difficulty moving around or getting from one place to another, its important to choose the right electric mobility scooter for you.\u00a0 People with mobility issues often feel reluctant to travel, go out with friends, or even do their own shopping.\n\nScooters can change that situation around completely.\u00a0 Life often feels better when the challenges associated with moving decrease.\n\nI know how important it is to stay self-reliant. That's why I rounded up the best 3-wheel electric scooter models for 2021.\n\nRead on to see which one is the right vehicle for your needs, but first, lets go over some of the reasons why someone would prefer a 3 wheel over a 4 wheel...\n\nSo What Are the Benefits of 3-Wheel Scooters?\n\n  \u2022 Typically a 3 wheel scooter is more compact, so often times they can be used more easily around the house.\n  \u2022 It\u2019s easy to maneuver in tight spaces, so a 3-wheeler is great to use when you are shopping or in restaurants as an example.\n  \u2022 It\u2019s a practical mobility aid to use in a crowded area.\n  \u2022 For taller users, you typically have more legroom on a 3 wheel scooter because the foot area extends to the sides of the tiller..\n  \u2022 It helps people with limited mobility in running their errands without overloading their joints.\n  \u2022 It\u2019s an efficient mobility-enhancement device for the elderly and often times more lightweight than a 4 wheel.\n  \u2022 It offers assistance for disabled people.\n  \u2022 It makes an overall difference in the quality of life for people who find difficulty in walking.\n\n3-Wheel Scooters vs 4-Wheel Scooters\n\nThese two designs are often compared and contrasted. So, let\u2019s see the strong points and shortcomings of each.\n\nWeight and Size\n\nWeight is a critical factor in choosing a mobility scooter. That's because the users are often incapacitated by injury, age, or other factors.\u00a0 A 3-wheel scooter has that advantage considering they are often times more lightweight.\n\nScooters are indoor\/outdoor vehicles, so their size matters. If you keep a scooter in your house, then you want it to occupy minimal space. The same applies to public spaces.\u00a0\n\nNow there are many different sizes of 3 wheel mobility scooters on the market; but the units specifically made for indoors or are made for transport, are easier to manage and operate in a home, restaurant, or mall.\n\n\nCompact lightweight scooters are easier to move from one place to another. They\u2019re also much easier to pack up with your regular luggage when you\u2019re traveling by car or by plane.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3-wheelers are better positioned for easy movement.\n\n\nOverall, 4-wheel scooters have more stability.\u00a0 That is\u00a0a\u00a0nice benefit if you are concerned about the unit being more stable.\n\nStability is nice of course, but it\u2019s not critical when you are dealing with major brands like the ones we carry.\u00a0 The engineering and design put into any unit we carry have been tested and made with precision and safety in mind.\u00a0 There is a reason they have been around for years and continue to be leaders in the market.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMany models offers a 3-wheel and a 4-wheel version.\u00a0 Often times the 3-wheel has a lower price point than the 4-wheel.\u00a0 This is especially important if you are on a concerned with money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou won't need to disturb your budget to get a good quality 3-wheel scooter.\n\nTurning\u00a0Radius\n\nA 3-wheel scooter is pretty adept in taking sharp turns.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve been on one, you know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nIf this is your first time on a 3-wheel scooter, you might wonder why sharp turning is a plus.\n\nWell, it's not critical in the street, but consider shopping and moving between the isles.\u00a0 However, it is remarkable when you use it inside your home or riding through crowds of people.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA 4-wheel scooter isn\u2019t as well-suited when it comes to maneuverability.\u00a0 To make a sharp turn around it a corner, it needs some space to proceed smoothly.\u00a0 Sometimes, in order to guide it through tight spaces, you will have to continuously put it in reverse to make that turn around the corner.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI like good looking vehicles of all types, and I have good reason to believe that you do too.\u00a0 In my opinion, 3-wheel scooters look more streamlined. \u00a0\n\nThey fit better within domestic or public spaces. They look less like a street transportation method, and more like a mobility device.\u00a0\n\nWhat Is the Turning Radius of a 3-Wheel Scooter?\n\n3-wheel scooters have remarkable maneuverability in tight spots, but this isn\u2019t just a general description.\n\nYou can actually measure the sharpness of the turning angle.\u00a0 Furthermore, you'll know the space needed for performing a full circle without having to go in reverse.\n\nWe\u2019re used to seeing a turning radius of around 45\u201d.\u00a0 This is nice, and the vehicle feels resourceful at that rate.\n\nThe tightest I\u2019ve seen was a 26\u201d model, and the widest went as far as 56\u201d, but it was a large scooter.\n\nCan You Transport a 3-Wheel Scooter?\n\nYou can transport the foldable types easily by packing them as luggage in the trunk of your car.\u00a0 They usually don't take up much space, and the lightweight models are a breeze to transport.\n\nAir-travel is possible with certain models only per the FAA regulations.\u00a0 The main thing FAA is concerned with is the type of battery the scooter has.\u00a0 Otherwise, you get to transport your scooter free of charge, according to the ADA.\n\nYou can disassemble some models into smaller and more manageable pieces. This is another smart way to carry your scooter along without hassles.\u00a0\n\nSo enough with all of the details of 3 wheel scooters, I think you get it at this point.\u00a0 Now lets get into my top picks of best 3 wheel scooters for this year...\n\n1. E-Wheels EW-36\n\nEWheels EW-36 Scooter\n\nIf you plan on using your scooter for outdoor transportation, then EW-36 is the one for you.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the fastest scooters we carry.\u00a0 You can drive it at speeds of up to 18 mph.\n\nSpeed isn\u2019t everything, as you\u2019ll need a sturdy battery to keep you powered all through your errands.\u00a0 This unit can last up to 45 miles on a single charge, so I\u2019d say it\u2019ll be sufficient for your daily activity.\n\nSpeaking of taking it out, a good-looking vehicle is always a plus.\u00a0 And this one definitely has the right aesthetics.\u00a0 It also comes in several colors to suit every taste.\u00a0\n\nIt has a high weight capacity of 350 lbs. and a spacious 18\u201d seat. Besides, it has some pretty attractive perks like its huge storage space.\u00a0 There\u2019s also the anti-theft alarm, headlights, USB port, and a battery indicator.\n\nIts speed can be controlled to different speed settings through the twist-throttle. In order to have a smooth ride on pavements, uneven roads and all manner of terrain, it has 4-inch ground clearance.\n\nTwo shock absorbers at the rear of the frame ensures riding in comfort. Afraid that it will get stolen? You don\u2019t have to be as it comes equipped with an anti-theft alarm.\n\nAs mentioned before, this model comes with a lot of storage space: It has a big compartment under the seat, a basket at the back, as well as a storage \u00a0compartment on the tiller.\n\nThe wheels are now equipped with hydraulic rear disc brakes for smoother stops. With its tubeless tires you don\u2019t have to worry about a lot of maintenance. It also comes equipped with designer aluminum rims for a sleeker look.\n\nNeed to charge your electronic devices on the go? Not to worry as it comes with a USB port for easy charging.\n\n\n2. Amigo RD\n\nAmigo RD 3 Wheel Scooter\n\nThis is a mobility vehicle you can use indoor or outdoor equally well.\u00a0 It has high maneuverability and a tight 34\u201d turning radius, so it moves smoothly in any setting.\u00a0 It also goes for 35 miles on a charge, so it\u2019ll do fine outdoors and last you all day long.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 swiveling seat is one of its nicest features. You wouldn\u2019t need a special chair when you\u2019re out, just rotate it to the right position and lock.\n\nThis scooter has a reliable weight capacity of 350 lbs. and a generous seat width of 18\u201d.\u00a0 It has high stability as its mass is centered on the platform and front part. This gives a proper weight distribution throughout for an easy ride.\n\nAmigo is one of the industry leaders. They\u2019ve been manufacturing these vehicles for half a century.\u00a0 That\u2019s why you\u2019ll find several practical and efficient functions in this 3-wheeler.\n\nIt rides at a maximum speed of 5.9 mph, giving you the ability to go just about everywhere. For those honoring the Shabbat, this scooter is halachically-approved.\n\nThe halachic principle involves indirect operation and continuous change of current. Thus, it comes equipped with a toggle switch which changes its operations from normal to Shabbat mode.\n\nThe handle is an EZ-Tilt, complete with foam grip high and low speed controls. In order to come to a smooth stop this scooter is equipped with electromagnetic brakes with manual release.\n\nThere is an optional TouchTron handle you can add, which allows for speed control, a battery indicator, speed indicator, a battery gauge and a horn.\n\nFor an easy ride on pavements, sand and uneven terrains, the Amigo RD comes with a 3.5 inch ground clearance.\n\n\n3. Enhance Mobility Triaxe\u00a0Cruze\n\nThe Triaxe Cruze is a great choice if you like traveling and being on the move.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lightweight compact vehicle that you can actually fold and wheel around like a piece of luggage.\u00a0 It can carry a significant amount of weight of up to 350 lbs.\n\nThe frame is made from aluminum.\u00a0 This gives it great strength and the lightest possible weight.\u00a0 It\u2019s agile and will slide through the tightest venues.\u00a0 Again, a good option if you\u2019re sightseeing or exploring new places.\n\nThe Cruze is designed for trips, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s FAA approved for air travel.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not flying, you can experience its paddle acceleration. It also has a \u2018rear-wheel-drive\u2019 mechanism.\u00a0 Both options contribute to a smooth and stable ride.\n\nIt has electromagnetic brakes, so you can smoot... (truncated)",

Picture: Getty\n\nShare this article\nHave your say\n\nLISA Venter, social media marketing manager at Money Dashboard, gives tips on the best ways to save money on care hire.\n\n1 Don\u2019t rely on airport deals\n\nWith Europe\u2019s biggest car hire firms recently rapped on the knuckles by the Competition and Markets Authority and told to act on customer complaints about insurance, it\u2019s clear that people have been losing out. They include people who have simply added airport car hire when buying their tickets. Use price comparison sites before you book your car through your airport ticket bundle to make sure it\u2019s the best price available. If you do plan on using airport hire, plan ahead as booking in advance and online you can save money through early bird fees.\n\n2 Credit card check\n\nGive your credit card statement a once-over after the final car hire bill has come off as it may not always be what you agreed to pay at the desk. That little clause about damages may come back to haunt you when you\u2019re charged for a scrape you didn\u2019t notice or weren\u2019t responsible for.\n\n3 Challenge damages\n\nIf you do end up damaging your car or a nasty sum comes off your credit card post car-hire by surprise then do challenge the car hire company. As a result of the new review this will be easier to do in six to 12 months time. When you return your car get it checked for damage and signed off by a member of. If you took the car back out of hours or the desk was busy and you didn\u2019t do the check it could be difficult to challenge the extra charges.\n\n4 Fuel for thought\n\nBefore booking your car online, make sure to check the options such as \u201cPick up full and return full\u201d or \u201cPre-purchased fuel and return empty\u201d depending on what suits your journey. This is handy for those doing shorter trips who don\u2019t want to pay for a full tank of fuel or those doing longer trips who\u2019d rather buy fuel along the way at a less inflated rate.\n\n5 Insurance\n\nCar hire insurance takes a cheap and appealing quote to an expensive and disappointing experience if you\u2019re not careful. Hopefully after the regulatory review the list of insurance available will be simplified and you won\u2019t have to think so hard about this. But for now follow the advice of the AA, which recommends that \u201crather than pay the hire company\u2019s \u2018Super\u2019 insurance premium to reduce possible excess payments in the event of a claim it might be cheaper to take the hirer\u2019s standard product and insure separately with a car hire excess reimbursement insurance policy\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Lisa Venter is social media manager at\n\nBack to the top of the page",

The wrong mechanic can do more harm than good when working on your car.\n\nThere are plenty of great BMW repair mechanics out there, though \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of knowing what to look for.\n\nDo you know how to find a professional mechanic who can do the work you need?\n\nIf not, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve put together this guide to help you find the best mechanic for the job. Keep reading to learn more!\n\nAbout BMW Repair\n\nBefore looking for the best mechanic, it\u2019s helpful to know a few things about what makes BMW repairs unique.\n\nThese are great cars that are known for their reliability. However, of course, every car will need maintenance done, and can have bigger issues come up at some point. It\u2019s important to know the common issues to look out for before calling your mechanic.\n\nHere are a few of the top reasons you may need to call a mechanic for BMW repair.\n\n1. Window Regulator Issues\n\nCertain BMW models are prone to issues with the window regulators.\n\nRegulator clips can get broken, and you\u2019ll need a professional to replace them. When the regulator isn\u2019t working right, you\u2019ll have windows that move slowly, or not at all.\n\n2. Electronic Issues\n\nAnother common BMW problem is with the electronics. Electronics regulate many different things in your car, such as windshield wipers. When the electronic system malfunctions, you\u2019ll need to call a mechanic.\n\n3. Door Lock Problems\n\nThis can be another electronic issue. The biggest door lock problem for BMW owners is remotely locking and unlocking your doors.\n\n4. Cracked Wheels\n\nSome BMWs are known for having alloy wheels that are prone to cracking. This is something you\u2019ll want to have a mechanic look at right away. If the problem goes unaddressed, you could end up with punctured tires.\n\n5. Engine Maintenance\n\nSome parts of the BMW engine may need to be replaced more often than you\u2019d think. Those parts can include the clutch, injectors, and ignition module.\n\nFinding a Great BMW Repair Mechanic\n\nWhether you\u2019re experiencing one of these common problems, or something else entirely, it\u2019s important to find the right mechanic for the job.\n\nHere are the steps you should follow to find a BMW car repair specialist you can trust.\n\n1. Read the Reviews\n\nAlthough you shouldn\u2019t trust everything you see online, the reviews of a local mechanic or repair shop can be a great help in your decision-making process.\n\nThe best and most experienced repair shops often have an online presence where they can interact with their customers. Although it\u2019s hard for anyone to avoid a few bad reviews, the overall tone of customer satisfaction should give you an idea of whether or not their repair work is good.\n\nAlthough online reviews may not be the single thing you base your final decision on, they can definitely help steer you in the right direction.\n\n2. Try the Better Business Bureau\n\nMany companies, including car repair shops, file with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).\n\nUnless you live in an extremely rural area, the BBB should have a list of mechanics in your area. Those shops will be graded on a scale of A to F, which can help give you an idea of which places to try and which to avoid.\n\n3. Ask for Recommendations\n\nOne of the best ways to learn about a business is through word of mouth.\n\nIf you have friends or family members who also drive BMWs, ask them where they go for repairs. Even if they drive a different kind of car, you might still get some good tips on repair shops to look into.\n\nYou can also ask for recommendations through your social media. Chances are good that a friend, or a friend of a friend, will have some advice that can help you.\n\nIf you have a local BMW car club chapter, that can be another great resource. Attend a meeting or connect with some members online. They\u2019re sure to have ideas on where the best BMW repair shops will be.\n\n4. Visit the Shop in Person\n\nOnce you have an idea of where the good mechanics are, try an in-person visit to get a feel for how that shop does business.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t stop to talk to anyone there, simply driving or walking by can give you some helpful information. How many cars are there at the moment? If you go back a couple weeks later, are the same cars still being worked on?\n\nA high turnover rate is a good sign: this means the mechanics there work quickly and are still bringing in more customers.\n\nYou should also pay attention to whether or not the shop appears clean and uncluttered. A great repair shop should take pride in keeping up appearances. Avoid shops with the same cars every week, a trash-filled lot, or sparse customers.\n\n5. Try Minor Maintenance First\n\nBefore your car has a major issue, it will probably need some kind of small maintenance work done, like an oil change.\n\nTake your BMW to a new shop for minor work first. This will give you an idea of how they work, and how much they charge. If you\u2019re not happy with the small things, you definitely won\u2019t want to go back to that same shop for something major.\n\nOn the other hand, if you love the way that mechanic handles the minor things, you\u2019ll know exactly where to go when you need something bigger done on your BMW.\n\n6. Have a Conversation\n\nIf you still have questions or concerns, your best bet is simply to have a conversation with a mechanic you\u2019re considering.\n\nYou can learn a lot just from how they address your concerns and questions. A good mechanic will be open, friendly, and able to offer answers or to find information about anything they don\u2019t know right away.\n\nNeed BMW Repair?\n\nAll cars need maintenance and repair work sometimes.\n\nWith the tips above, you\u2019ll be able to find the best mechanic for whatever your BMW needs.\n\nWant to learn more about BMW repairs?

        "text":"Ten Performance Cars That Gave Up Natural Aspiration for Turbo and Supercharging\n\nIt had to happen at some point.\n\n\nThanks to emissions and efficiency regulations, it was bound to happen: The migration of these previously naturally aspirated wonders to forced induction. They may be more powerful now, but does the loss of natural aspiration ruin the experience?\n\n1 of 10\n2013 BMW M5\n\nHow often do you come across a sedan with an F1-derived V10 tucked under the hood? Not often, especially since the current F10 M5 dropped the V10 from the previous E60 M5 in favor of a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8. It makes 560-hp, about 60 more horsepower than the V10, but the signature warble that made the E60 so cool is absent. It's also the first M5 to have a turbo, but certainly not the last.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n2 of 10\n2016 Chevrolet Camaro\n\nThis is Chevy's first attempt at making a turbocharged four-cylinder Camaro. The 2.0-liter engine is borrowed from a Cadillac ATS and GM estimates a 0-60 sprint in under six seconds. And on highways, the Camaro should get 30 mpg. When was the last time a factory Camaro could do that?\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n3 of 10\n<p>The new Acura NSX is the same as the old NSX in name alone. This NSX is a rolling testbed for future technology, with a complex hybrid system and a nine-speed dual clutch trans. A hardcore Type R version might nix the hybrid stuff, but it should also get rid of the dual-clutch.<\/p>\nEvan Klein\n2017 Acura NSX\n\nAfter waiting and waiting and waiting, Acura finally gives us a twin-turbo, dry-sump, 3.5-liter V6 NSX, which is far different from the naturally aspirated original and the first concept, which was also N\/A. An additional three electric motors add to the engine's power, making the NSX's total power output to be 573-hp. However, in our first drive, we thought it sacrificed too much in the way of livability.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n4 of 10\n2016 Honda Civic Type R\n\nThe Civic Type R has always been a high-revving naturally aspirated hot rod. Now, instead of a VTEC and a high redline, it has Honda's new 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, good for 306-hp.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n5 of 10\nRichard Pardon\n2016 Ferrari 488 GTB\n\nThe 488 is the first time a mass-market (by Ferrari standards) mid-engined Ferrari has been turbocharged since the largely forgotten 208 Turbo of 1982. Expectedly, the first thing that dropped was the lofty, 9000 RPM redline that we all loved. But still, some of the greatest Ferraris were turbocharged. You don't need to look any further than the F40 to agree with me. And the 488's 660-hp output is nothing to dismiss.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n6 of 10\n2015 Ford Mustang EcoBoost\n\nFord knew that some people would turn up their noses at an EcoBoost Mustang, so the EcoBoost Mustang has almost all the identical aggressive looks as the GT does. Under the hood is a 2.3-liter that makes a respectable 310-hp. And you know what else? It's fun as hell to drive. It's not the first turbo Mustang, but it is the first in a very long time.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n7 of 10\nRick Dole & Andrew Trahin\n2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06\n\nThe 2015 Z06 abandoned the C6's LS7 7.0-liter V8, which is one of our favorite engines. Instead, the new Z06 gets a 6.2-liter supercharged monster engine that runs with 650-hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, making it the first supercharged Z06. Like the Z06 that came before it, the newest version is a guaranteed thorn in the side of its European competitors.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n8 of 10\n2017 Porsche 911 Carrera\n\nPorsche, like Ferrari, couldn't escape the new emissions economy numbers now required of automakers. Porsche dropped the displacement down to 3.0-liters for both the Carrera (370-hp) and the Carrera S (420-hp), the first time the Carrera has had forced induction. That means that the 911 Turbo is no longer the only turbo 911.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n9 of 10\n2016 Mercedes-AMG C63\n\nMercedes dropped the 6.2-liter V8 from the previous generation C63 and replaced it with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8. In the normal C63, this engine produces 469-hp, up from the outgoing car's 451-hp. The C63 S makes 503-hp\u2014nearly the same as the 2012 C63 AMG Black Series. It's not the first C-Class from AMG to have forced induction, but it's the first in quite a long time.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n10 of 10\n2015 BMW M3 and M4\n\nDividing the the next-gen M3 into the M3 (sedan) and the M4 (coupe), BMW also took out the high-revving V8 of the E92 M3 and fitted them with a 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six engine. The straight-six engine has been a quintessential BMW engine, and with the two extra turbos bolted to it, it's got the torque (414 lb-ft) and the horsepower (424-hp) of a proper 2015 sports car.\n\nDid we miss anything?

The event has countless classics, concepts, and champions to grab your eye. In no particular order, here are our picks for the ten best reasons to look forward to Pebble Beach\u2019s Automotive Week.\n\n1.) Jaguar Lightweight E-Type\n\nJaguar Lightweight E-Type\n\nJaguar Heritage\u2019s Lightweight E-Type resurrection may steal the show this year, with an uncompromising blend of authenticity and pure automotive passion. The featherweight E-Type was built to the exact same specifications of 1963\u2019s sports car, implementing the six unused chassis codes from the original 18-car run.\n\n2.) Ferrari 458 Speciale Spider\n\nFerrari 458 Speciale\n\nThe long-awaited Spider version of Ferrari\u2019s 458 Speciale will make an appearance at Pebble Beach, although it will only be present at a private event for \u2018special\u2019 clients. The 597-horsepower stunner is expected to be the fastest open-top vehicle in the Ferrari range.\n\n3.) Lamborghini Huracan Super Trofeo\n\nLamborghini Huracan Super Trofeo\n\nLamborghini\u2019s Huracan has just touched down and there\u2019s already a new version. The race-inspired, hardcore Huracan Super Trofeo is expected to show up at Pebble Beach\u2019s \u2018The Quail\u2019 motorsport event, boasting stouter suspension, a bare-bones interior, and an upgraded engine.\n\n4.) McLaren P1 GTR\n\nMcLaren P1 GTR\n\nFor those who thought the 903-hp, supercar-shredding P1 wasn\u2019t extreme enough; McLaren is bringing a race-inspired P1 GTR to Pebble Beach. It features an extremely aggressive, angular look, 986 hp, and a spoiler that will make Ferrari F40s jealous. Oh, and it costs $3.36 million.\n\n5.) BMW i8 Concours d\u2019Elegance Edition\n\nBMW i8\n\nThe 362-hp, 113-mpg BMW i8 is already an exclusive way to get around, but BMW is taking it a step further with the Concours d\u2019Elegance edition. The one-off hybrid wears exclusive Frozen Grey Metallic paint, laser headlights, and an interior dyed with plant extracts.\n\n6.) Four Bespoke Aston Martins\n\nBespoke Aston Martin\u00a0\n\nFour customized Astons are headed to Monterey, courtesy of the British manufacturer\u2019s Q wing. The bespoke team consists of an Abor Orange Vanquish Coupe, a cowboy-themed Vanquish Volante, a DB9 with pink interior, and an Amethyst V12 Vantage S.\n\n7.) McLaren P1 and 650S Custom\n\nMcLaren 650S Spider\n\nNot satisfied with just one entry at Pebble Beach, McLaren is also shipping a tricked out P1 and 650S to the festival. McLaren Special Operations\u2019 650S spider rides on custom ten-spoke alloys and wears a Cerulean Blue paint job, while the P1 sports an orange-accented color scheme and a gold-lined engine bay.\n\nRELATED: See McLaren\u2019s 650S Sprint\n\n8.) Aston Martin DP-100 Concept and V12 Vantage S\u00a0Roadster\n\nAston Martin DP-100\n\nAnother British company that can\u2019t settle for one booth is Aston Martin, who is bringing its DP-100 Vision Gran Turismo Concept and brand new V12 Vantage S along for the ride. The 800-hp DP-100 will be shown in the flesh for the first time at the event, as will the Vantage, which is the fastest roadster in Aston Martin\u2019s history.\n\n9.) Bugatti Veyron Legend Ettore Edition\n\nBugatti Veyron Ettore\n\nThis gorgeous limited edition Veyron pays homage to Ettore Bugatti, the company\u2019s founder. Its styling (and 41111 chassis code) are inspired by the legendary Type 41 Royale, and each of the three planned examples will cost around $3.1 million.\n\n10.) Range Rover Sport SVR\n\nRange Rover Sport SVR\n\nPebble Beach onlookers will be treated to a viewing the most powerful Land Rover product ever, the Range Rover Sport SVR. The Range\u2019s 550-hp supercharged V8 recently propelled the SVR around the Nurburgring Nordschleife in just 8:14, making it the fastest SUV to ever do so.\n\n(Header photo by Kimball Studios)",

        "text":"Sub-3000 Club: The Eight Slowest-Selling Cars\n\nIn the ever-changing automotive market, there are a few evergreen nameplates that sell massive volumes year after year. The Toyota Corolla and Honda Accord are the traditional volume winners, last year selling a combined 639,185 vehicles , to put that in perspective, there are more Corollas and Accords sold each year than there are residents in the state of Vermont.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are the exotics, the vehicles that only a small group of people can buy. Ultra-luxurious Maybach sold just 63 cars in all of 2010. The explanation for this difference is fairly straightforward: many car shoppers can afford a Corolla or Accord, but few can stretch to the $378,000 entry price of a Maybach 57. And measuring 18.8 feet end-to-end, the 57 is a real pain to park at the grocery store.\n\nYet there\u2019s a surprising assortment of mainstream vehicles that sell in exotic-like quantities. Whether it\u2019s due to flawed marketing, optimistic pricing, or just an aging product, plenty of models record fewer than 3000 sales annually. Here\u2019s our look at eight of the slowest-selling cars of 2010, listed in descending number of sales.\n\nTo keep things fair, we included only mainstream vehicles that were on sale for all of calendar-year 2010. That excludes exotic and high-priced vehicles, like the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG (499 sold in 2010); cars that debuted late in the year, like the Chevrolet Volt (just 326 sales last year); and cars that lingered on dealer forecourts long after being discontinued, such as the Honda S2000 (85 sales in 2010.)\n\nSubaru Tribeca \u2013 2472 sales\nSubaru has enjoyed continually growing sales success for the past few years, but the Tribeca hasn\u2019t been part of the action. It continues to be the brand\u2019s slowest-selling model, and sales numbers have dropped 80 percent since 2008.\n\nDesigned as a hip crossover-cum-minivan, it bowed as the B9 Tribeca at the 2005 Detroit auto show and dropped the \u201cB9\u201d prefix when it was redesigned for model-year 2008. Styling of the B9 \u2014 especially the gawky headlights and flat-nosed grille \u2014 was controversial, whereas the latest version looks more like a grown-up Forester or Outback. And that\u2019s part of the problem: Those models are the Tribeca\u2019s stiffest competition. Faithful Subaru buyers have been loyal to those nameplates for years, meaning they give the Tribeca little attention.\n\nOriginally available configured with either five or seven seats, three rows of seating have been the only choice since 2010. The Tribeca\u2019s sole powertrain option is a 3.6-liter flat-six engine with a five-speed automatic transmission, and Subaru\u2019s signature all-wheel drive. With stickers ranging from $31,220 to $36,520, the Tribeca is the priciest Subaru save for the high-performance WRX STI.\n\nPorsche Boxster \u2013 2177 sales \/ Porsche Cayman \u2013 1322 sales\nLeaving aside the V-6-powered Cayenne SUV, the Porsche Boxster and Cayman are the cheapest ways to get behind the wheel of a brand-new Porsche. And yet the coupe and roadster continue to languish at the bottom of Porsche\u2019s sales charts year after year.\n\nFor Porschephiles, neither car offers the same historic pedigree as the long-lived 911. The Boxster entered production as recently as 1996, and its hardtop Cayman sibling didn\u2019t bow until the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show. They\u2019re also sometimes seen as soft, dumbed-down Porsches as opposed to the more sporting 911 range. Porsche intentionally keeps the cars\u2019 outputs down so they don\u2019t upstage the iconic 911.\n\nPity, because both the Cayman and Boxster reward with an engaging driving experience limited only by the lack of horsepower. The Boxster starts at $48,100 with a 2.9-liter flat-six making 255 horsepower, which the $58,600 Boxster S upgrades to a 3.4-liter unit with 310 horses. The pricier Cayman demands $51,900 for its 265-horsepower iteration and $62,100 to unlock the 320-horsepower Cayman S. Even more performance can be had from the sporting Boxster Spyder and upcoming Cayman R. Yet even the least-powerful 911, the Carrera, trounces these outputs with a substantial 345 hp.\n\nFurthermore, there are just three flavors of Boxster and two versions of the Cayman, whereas Porsche has spawned an incredible 25 different varieties of the current 911, proving just how much attention the company lavishes on its historic model. The 911 accounted for 5737 Porsche sales in 2010, almost double that of the Boxster and Cayman combined.\n\nPorsche recently launched a new ad campaign touting the everyday usability of its cars, which aims to convince potential buyers that Porsches can be more than just a retirement goal or a weekend-only toy. Check back next year to see whether the promotion elevated Cayman and Boxster sales figures above their meager 2010 levels of 2177 and 1322 cars, respectively.\n\nJaguar XK \u2013 2137 sales\nJaguar euphemistically characterizes 2010 as a \u201cstable\u201d year for the XK coupe and convertible, even though sales dropped six percent versus 2009. The current version of the XK was introduced for model-year 2007, replacing the older XK8 and XKR. The base XK is powered by a 385-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 engine, whereas the hot XKR packs a supercharged 510-horsepower punch.\n\nRaw power aside, the XK and XKR are genuinely attractive cars, with just a hint of Aston Martin influence in the wide haunches and curvaceous front end. They were styled by Jaguar Design Director Ian Callum, whose pen was also responsible for the XF and XJ sedans. The inside is similarly upscale, with sumptuous leather seats, an assortment of wood veneers, and an array of electronic gadgets.\n\nNone of that appears to have swayed American buyers, who took home just 2137 units of the XK \u2014 that figure includes coupes, convertibles, and the hot XKR \u2014 in 2010. Although Jaguar sold just 13,340 vehicles in the U.S. overall, the XK still struggles to attract checkbooks.\n\nAmong the possible explanations is the fact that Jaguar is still plagued by a reputation for glitchy electronics and dubious reliability, which certainly doesn\u2019t encourage buyers \u2014 even though recent J.D. Power surveys say quality has been improving. The brand also has a large following in states subject to snow in winter, where high-powered sports coupes and convertibles are impractical choices. Finally, the XK\u2019s rear seats are unusable for anyone with legs, whereas both the sporty XF and luxurious XJ can comfortably transport five adults.\n\nAcura RL \u2013 2037 sales\nAcura has tried again and again to renew interest in its large luxury sedan \u2014 a complete redesign for 2005, a refresh in 2009, and some modest tweaks for 2011 \u2014 but it still hasn\u2019t caught on with buyers. Part of the issue may be the large overlap between the RL and the much cheaper TL. They\u2019re both about the same size, and the TL can be optioned with the same 3.7-liter V-6 that comes standard in the RL, but for significantly less money. It could also be explained by the RL\u2019s anonymous styling and convoluted center stack design.\n\nThe few buyers who do select the RL enjoy all-wheel drive, the aforementioned 300-horsepower V-6, a 10-speaker Bose sound system, plus leather seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel as standard. Price tags start at $48,060 and climb to $56,010 with the Advance package.\n\nToyota Land Cruiser \u2013 1807 sales\nSeveral Toyota products routinely grace America\u2019s list of top-selling cars: the Corolla, Camry, and RAV4 attract hundreds of thousands of buyers ever year. The Land Cruiser, however, got the attention of just 1807 car shoppers last year \u2014 costly Italian brand Maserati sold more cars here in the same period.\n\nTake a look at Toyota\u2019s new-car lineup, and it\u2019s easy to see why the Land Cruiser falls by the wayside: It\u2019s one of four three-row SUVs offered by Toyota. The other three \u2014 the Highlander, 4Runner, and Sequoia \u2014 are all significantly cheaper than the Land Cruiser\u2019s $69,730 sticker price and offer similar specifications and options. Further hurting the Land Cruiser are lowly fuel economy ratings of 13 mpg city and 18 mpg highway, due to the combination of a thirsty 5.7-liter V-8 and a 5700-pound curb weight.\n\nAnyone whose heart is set on a Land Cruiser would be well advised to consider the Lexus LX570. It\u2019s essentially the same vehicle, but with nicer interior fittings and more optional technology. The \u201cL\u201d badge and all those luxury bits, however, mean the LX570 is nearly $11,000 costlier than the Land Cruiser. In spite of the price differential, the LX570 sold more than twice as many copies as the Land Cruiser last year, at 3983 units.\n\nAudi TT \u2013 1531 sales\nAudi\u2019s sporty TT, available as either a coupe or convertible, was first launched in 1998 and received a full-on redesign for model-year 2008, before a litany of mild styling updates for the 2011 model year. In spite of the changes, sales have dropped off from 4486 in 2008, to 1935 sales in 2009, and to just 1531 last year.\n\nThe name stands for \u201cTechnology and Tradition,\u201d and the car has certainly packed a variety of the former: engines choices have ranged from a 1.8-liter turbo to a 3.2-liter V-6, with power sent either to the front or all four wheels. Quattro all-wheel drive is now standard on all models, as is a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four producing 211 horsepower, or 265 horsepower in the high-performance TTS. An even faster model will debut here later this year, the 335-horsepower TT RS. It will be offered only in coupe form with a six-speed manual, and is said to hit 62 mph in just 4.6 seconds.\n\nDownsides? Neither the rear seats nor the trunk offer much usable space, making the TT mildly impractical for everyday use, and some enthusiasts may be turned off by the lack of a shift-it-yourself option, as Audi\u2019s six-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission is the only choice until the TT RS arrives. As for performance, the choice of 211 or 265 horsepower makes for adequate forward thrust, but the TT has never been quite as engaging as its German or Japanese competitors. Add to that ...

While the GT-R will help Nissan to improve its image, it is not the car that will increase sales. In the coming few years, Nisaan along with its sister company Datsun will launch new models and new variants of existing products.\n\nHere is a list of upcoming Nissan cars in India:\n\nNissan X-Trail\n\nThis will be the first launch by Nisaan in 2017. X-Trail will be a SUV and it is expected to launch by the end of 2017. Nissan sold the past gen X-Trail in India, but due to poor demand, it was taken off the shelves. The new model expected to launch will be a hybrid.\n\nAlso Read\u00a0Upcoming Chevrolet Cars in India\n\nExpected Launch Date End 2017\nEstimated Price Rs. 25-30 lakh\nEngine Options 2.0 L Petrol + Electric Hybrid\n\nNissan Kicks\n\nKicks small SUV is the second entry in our list of upcoming Nisaan cars in India. It is available for sale in Brazil, and is competing with the Hyundai Creta. With the launch of the Kicks, Nissan might think about discontinuing the Terrano as they will be in the same price range.

The curvy lines of the current model has been replaced by sharp creases and aggressive look. Micra might not get launched in India, because Nissan won\u2019t be able to keep prices in check. But, if it does, the launch will take place in 2018.\n\nExpected Launch Date 2018\nEstimated Price Rs 6-8 lakh\nEngine Options 1.2 L Petrol\/1.5 L Diesel\n\nUpcoming Nissan Cars in India\n\nModel Estimated Price Expected Launch Date\nX-Trail Rs. 25-30 lakh Early 2017\nKicks Rs. 10-14 lakh Early 2018\nNew Micra Rs. 6-8 lakh 2018\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"BMW Motorcycles Evolution Since 1923 \u2013 Animated Timeline Via 20 Iconic Bikes\n\n\n\n\u00a0The history of BMW Motorrad is actually the story of the evolution of the motorcycle in general. Giant leaps of innovation are clear to see about every dozen years, but the BMW innovation throughout keeps moving the two-wheel world forward at warp speed.\n\nFor a non-bikes guy like me and perhaps you, the names and styles are all a bit perplexing. We have labelled all the main bike photos to help make it all a bit clearer. The pre-war bikes in particular are hard to distinguish at first without the labels.\n\nSo which is your favorite? We\u2019d pick the 1935 R12 with its densely-packed center engine compartment and streamlined, ultra-low height and narrow framework.\n\n1923\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 32\n\n\n\nBMW\u2019s chief engineer Max Friz develops a boxer engine with two transverse-mounted cylinders. This principle of design proved to be an inspired response to the challenge of feeding both cylinders with an equal amount of cooling air. A feature of the brand\u2019s first model (the BMW R 32), it became an identity-defining thread running through the history of BMW Motorrad engine technology.\n\nThe aluminum cylinder head \/ overhead valve design \u2013 without parallel in the motorcycle world \u2013 doubles the power output of the BMW R 37. The first single-cylinder model, the BMW R 39, also features this technology.\n\nThe first kick-starter crank is presented on the BMW R 57 to enable easier starting.\n\nSupercharger technology paves the way for BMW motorcycles to set their first world speed records.\n\nTwin carburetor technology is presented on the BMW R 16.\n\nThe soldered tubular frame is replaced by a pressed-steel construction, which gives the BMW R 12 and BMW R 17 a heavy appearance. References to the \u201cGerman school\u201d of motorcycle design abound.\n\n1935\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 12\n\n\n\n\nIn the BMW R 12 and BMW R 17 the hydraulically damped telescopic fork first tested in race competition replaces the previously standard cantilever spring.\n\nChain-driven overhead camshafts and a foot-shift four-speed gearbox are introduced for the BMW R 5.\n\n1936\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 5\n\n\nThe rear-wheel suspension system already employed successfully in off-road racing enters series production \u2013 and promptly takes traction and ride comfort to a new level.\n\n1948\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 24\n\n\nThe engine from the BMW R 5 incorporates various new features in the BMW R 51\/2, such as a single oil circuit for both cylinders, slanted carburettors and finned valve covers. The BMW R 25 is given a welded tubular frame, consigning the bolted tubular frame of the first post-war models to history.\n\n1951\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 51\/3\n\n\nA new three-shaft transmission and a driveshaft with front universal joint take care of power transfer. The launch of the BMW R 50 and BMW R 69 brings with it the premiere of the full swing-arm suspension. The telescopic fork and straight-line suspension are replaced by an Earles-type front fork and dual rear swing arm, which take ride comfort to unprecedented levels. The driveshaft is now integrated into the swing arm.\n\n1960\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 69 S\n\n\nThe BMW R 69 S marks the changeover from a sprung saddle-type seat to a bench seat, which increases comfort levels significantly. The single-cylinder BMW R 27 provides far greater comfort thanks to \u201csilent block\u201d rubber bushes, which substantially reduce driveline vibration.\n\n1969\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 75\/5\n\n\n\nThe BMW R 75\/5 is equipped with constant-vacuum carburettors for improved response and refinement as well as an electric engine starter. The debut of the \/5 series sees BMW introduce a completely new design for the boxer engine, which holds sway until 1993. Identifying features include camshafts and push rods located below the crankshaft and cylinders. The telescopic fork also makes a comeback in updated form. Another new feature is the double-loop tubular frame.\n\n1973\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 90 S\n\n\n\nThe BMW R 90 \u2013 the world\u2019s first volume-produced motorcycle with a handlebar-mounted fairing \u2013 is launched. This represents a milestone in the history of aerodynamic development. Wind tunnel research is applied even more systematically in the development of the BMW R 100 RS. This model is the world\u2019s first production motorcycle with a full fairing.\n\nThe BMW R 80 G\/S lays the foundations for the touring enduro segment and reveals the world\u2019s first single swing-arm construction.\n\nThis brings the advantages of lower weight and more responsive rear suspension, and makes it easier to change the wheel.\n\n1976\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 100 RS\n\n\n\n1980\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 80 G\/S\n\n\n\nIn addition to its boxer and single-cylinder engine variants, the BMW K 100 gives a debut to a third power unit: the first in-line and first four-cylinder unit ever offered by BMW Motorrad. In another new development, the engine is longitudinally mounted. The launch of the K series models brings the introduction of the steel spaceframe, which in turn makes way for the aluminium bridge frame \u2013 but not until the 1990s.\n\n1986\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 K 100 LT\n\n\n\nThe BMW K 75 is fitted with a second in-line engine variant. Closely based on the four-cylinder unit, this three-cylinder engine features an innovative balancer shaft to enhance refinement.\n\n\nBMW Motorrad presents the Paralever construction \u2013 a newly developed double-joint swing arm that eliminates unwanted drive forces on the rear suspension.\n\n\n1988\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 K 1\n\n\n\n\nFour-valve technology, DOHC cylinder heads and the world\u2019s first digital engine electronics for motorcycles are introduced in the four-cylinder engine. BMW is the world\u2019s first motorcycle manufacturer to offer anti-lock brakes (ABS) for its models. This braking safety technology is constantly optimised and is today fitted as standard on all BMW motorcycles.\n\n\nFurther aerodynamic progress is made with the BMW K 1. As well as the front and rear, a section of the front wheel now also has a fairing.\n\n1993\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 1100 RS\n\n\n\nThe latest stage of boxer engine development introduces innovative details such as four-valve technology, manifold injection and a three-way catalytic converter. In a revolutionary new development for the front suspension, the Telelever construction \u2013 a combination of a telescopic fork and a wishbone \u2013 now separates the tasks of wheel location and damping.\n\n1993\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 F 650\n\n\n\nThe BMW R 1100 RS embodies a fundamental shift in the basic construction of a motorbike. BMW is the first volume manufacturer to do away completely with the previously standard main frame. The engine now serves as a load-bearing element.\n\n\nOptimised safety on two wheels is revealed in the form of the BMW C1, an urban vehicle that combines the low road-space requirements of a single-track vehicle with the safety of a small car.\n\n\n2004\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 K 1200 S\n\n\nThe successor to the four-cylinder engine introduced in 1988 makes its debut in the BMW K 1200 S. The new in-line unit is transversely mounted and the cylinders are inclined forwards by 55 degrees. Other highlights include new digital engine management and a dry sump lubrication system which is still unique in motorcycle design today. First the Telelever, now the Duolever. This front suspension system comprises two almost parallel wishbones, mounted in and turning within the frame. The BMW K 1200 RS is the world\u2019s first series-produced motorcycle to feature ESA (Electronic Suspension Adjustment).\n\n\n\n2006\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 F 800 S\n\n\n\nA two-cylinder unit is added to the family of in-line engines. The parallel-twin fitted in the BMW F 800 S initially uses a belt drive, but this is later replaced by chain drive.\n\n\nThe BMW HP 2 Sport is the most powerful series-produced boxer model to date. With two overhead camshafts per cylinder, the engine generates maximum output of 98 kW\/133 hp. ESA technology with extended adjustment options is now available for the BMW R 1200 GS enduro model. ASC (Automatic Stability Control) is unveiled. This system prevents the driven wheel from spinning, enabling efficient power transmission and increased active safety.\n\n\nThe BMW K 1600 GT and BMW K 1600 GTL tourer models offer two world firsts: the multi-controller for intuitive operation of the onboard monitor and the Adaptive Headlight system. The second-generation ESA system, which adds the ability to change the rear spring rate, is presented as another world first in motorcycle design for the BMW K 1300 S.\n\n2009\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 S 1000 RR\n\n\n\nThe brand\u2019s first super-sports motorcycle, the BMW S 1000 RR, is fitted with a short-stroke four-cylinder engine which develops 142 kW\/193 hp, can spin to 14,200 rpm, and has titanium valves, variable intake manifolds and adjustable interference pipe valves in the exhaust system. Also new are the button-controlled Race ABS and DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) systems.\n\n2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 K 1600 GT\n\n\nThe slimmest and lightest in-line six-cylinder engine ever fitted in a series-produced model now powers the BMW K 1600 GT and BMW K 1600 GTL.\n\n\n2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BMW Motorrad \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R 1200 GS\n\n\nThe latest generation of BMW\u2019s boxer engine is presented \u2013 still with air\/liquid cooling, but the liquid is now a glycol\/water mixture which, for the first time, flows vertically through the cylinder heads. The electric motor powering the close-to-series BMW C evolution e-scooter prototype generates zero local emissions and has a range of up to 100 kilometres (62 miles). The first ever semi-active suspension system, known as BMW Dynamic ESA, is presented. The electronically controlled suspension of the BMW R 1200 GS adapts the bike\u2019s damping automatically to the road condition and situation at hand.\n\nThe BMW ... (truncated)",

        "text":"10 Health Conditions That Will Affect Your Driving\n\nHome\/Driving Safety\/10 Health Conditions That Will Affect Your Driving\n\n10 Health Conditions That Will Affect Your Driving\n\nHealth \u2013 An Important Factor If You Wish To Secure A Driving License In Malaysia\n\nAge is not the only factor which determines a person getting a driving license in Malaysia. Yes, you have to be 17 to apply for a driver\u2019s license for cars. And you must at least be 16 years old should you wish to secure a B2 or motorcycle license.\n\nMany do not realize that besides age, there exist various other requirements to enable a person securing a driving license in this country.\n\nTo qualify for a license in Malaysia, one has to be in good and sound health. In today\u2019s article, I will attempt to pin-point some of the factors pertaining to health, a potential driver should ideally possess if he so wishes to apply for a driving license.\n\nHowever, there are no medical examination as such for potential students to undergo. Whatever it is, the license issuing authorities, in this case, the J.P.J. do have a few guidelines for us to follow.\n\nAmongst these guidelines which driving schools, institutes, and potential students and parents should be aware of are:\n\n1) Overall one should ideally be healthy and sound.\n\nIn this aspect, one should possess normal limbs, hands and legs. Those possessing any abnormality have to be certified fit to drive by a government clinic or hospital. An orthopedic surgeon should be able to carry out this duty effectively.\n\nFor this, you have to secure the necessary forms from the transport department various offices all across the country.\n\n2) Do not suffer from epilepsy.\n\nThose suffering from this ailment known as epilepsy are advised not to take up driving. No medical tests are required. But parents who have children who are affected by the particular malady have a duty to ensure that their children do not take up driving.\n\nEpileptic people, unfortunately are even not advised to partake in activities such as swimming for instance. Driving is an activity deemed as dangerous for patients who are suffering from epilepsy.\n\nIn short, it is the duty of parents whose children are suffering from epilepsy to see to it that such patients do not take up driving. The onus is for these parents to ensure that they carry out their duty to society.\n\n3) Ability to hear well is extremely important.\n\nAs we are all aware, to a driver, the ability to hear well is very important. To hear vehicles coming from the front, the rear, the sides and so forth is vital. It can cause accidents if a driver is unable to do these functions well.\n\nA person, poor in hearing abilities is therefore advised to secure the proper hearing aids available today in the market if he so wishes to take up driving courses. The hearing aids may be costly, but this alternative is necessary, especially to one who hearing power is extremely poor.\n\n4) Do not suffer from colour blind.\n\nPrior to being allowed to sit for the 50 questions objective test, a candidate has to get through a short colour blind test. Failing to pass this test indicates that you are colour blind.\n\nIn such cases, you have to go to the J.P.J. office, where an officer will interview you. You will then be given a letter requesting you to present yourself for a colour blind test.\n\nA simple colour blind test will determine if you can be allowed to drive. The decision to allow you to drive rests with the Road Transport Authorities.\n\n5) Do not be too dependent on drugs.\n\nSome people depend on drugs to the extent that they are considered as drug addicts. Such categories of people are advised not to take up driving as it is dangerous for themselves and other people as well.\n\n6) The ability to plan your journey.\n\nSetting out on a journey, albeit a short one, should first of all be planned. Not planning a journey could easily lead to all sorts of problems.\n\nSo, you are encouraged to plan your journey well prior to setting out on one.\n\n7) Ensure as a driver, you are in good health.\n\nA driver who is unwell or sick for that matter will find it difficult to drive. The driver may most probably discover himself getting involved in unwarranted incidents.\n\nTherefore, do not drive if ever you find yourself not in good health.\n\n8) You should possess responsibility.\n\nDrivers should ideally possess responsibility. For example, when a driver is involved in an accident, he should realize that he possesses the responsibility of sending injured people to the hospital for treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, a driver should likewise realize it\u2019s his duty to lodge a police report should he or she is involved with an accident.\n\n9) Concentrating a 100% while driving.\n\nA driver should ideally provide a 100% concentration while driving. For example, avoid using a handphone is one advice that should be given to all drivers. Use a hands free set wherever possible.\n\nAvoid driving immediately after consuming medication. Seek a doctor\u2019s advice if you have to.\n\n10) Do not be emotional.\n\nA driver faced with psychological problem should ideally not be allowed to drive as it\u2019s rather easy for those emotionally unstable to be involved in accidents.\n\nThis article has expanded a rather lot of time upon the factor which might most probably cause a driver to be involved in accidents. So please ponder carefully over what has been said and see to it that you are not involved in accidents.\n\nBy | 2012-09-22T00:09:22+00:00 March 17th, 2010|Driving Safety|4 Comments\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n\n  1.

Learn more before your exam. 50% means only half the entire tyre is on the yellow or white line on the slope. Get a clearer picture from your own instructor.\n\n  2.

        "text":"The hybrid version of the Toyota Camry is, behind the Toyota Prius, the best-selling hybrid in America, but there are at least ten other cars for sale this year that get better EPA-estimated mileage on the city, highway or combined cycles. Some are diesels, some are hybrids and some are just light-weight cars with smaller displacement motors. But all share one thing in common \u2014 they're more fuel efficient. So why's the Camry Hybrid selling so well? Your answer's as good as ours.\n\nBut first some stats on the Toyota Camry Hybrid. For starters, it's a \"dual-mode\" hybrid utilizing the same Toyota-branded Hybrid Synergy Drive found in the Toyota Prius. The trim level of the Camry Hybrid is relatively up-featured, including LED taillights, a DVD-based navigational system and most of the features found on the top-of-the-line Camry XLE. Though the Camry was originally advertised with a higher mileage, new EPA standards bring the over-reaching hybrid down to a city and highway rating in the low-to-mid 30 mpg range. Despite the lower rating, the Camry Hybrid is still the sales king for those who want a hybrid, aren't concerned about highway mileage, and want something that looks more normal than a Prius. However, there are alternatives to the super number one best automaker from the land of the rising sun. City: 33 mpg Highway: 34 mpg Combined: 34 mpg MSRP: $26,150\n\n2009 Honda Civic GX CNG\n\nThe Honda Civic GX CNG is an interesting study in alternative fuel sources, their advantages and what-the-hell T. Boone Pickens is talking about. The GX looks just like any other Honda Civic, but runs on compressed natural gas typically added from a home fueling station. This Civic is inferior to the Camry in terms of city or combined mileage, but slightly bests the Toyota sedan on the highway. The Civic GX also has a lower cost of ownership (it needs minimal services), has a significantly smaller carbon footprint and costs about the same. The technology is still in development, though, so less than 1,000 vehicles are typically produced each year. City: 24 mpg Highway: 36 mpg Combined: 28 mpg Advantage Over Camry: Highway MSRP: $25,090\n\n2009 Kia Rio (Auto)\n\nThe Kia is among the smallest, cheapest new cars for sale in the United States, coming in at more than half the price of the Toyota Camry Hybrid and more than 1,000 pounds lighter. Powered by a 110-horsepower fourbanger tied to a CVT transmission, the little Kia is slightly better than the Camry on the highway, though much worse in the city. While much cheaper, the Rio offers few of the features and almost none of the prestige, comfort, desirability or practicality of the Camry. Even with limited availability for Toyota, the 2008 Rio only bested the Camry Hybrid's sales by 134 cars. City: 26 mpg Highway: 35 mpg Combined: 30 mpg Advantage Over Camry: Highway MSRP: $12,145\n\n2009 Chevrolet Cobalt LS Coupe XFE\n\nEssentially a 2009 Chevy Cobalt with a few light tweaks, the Cobalt XFE is modified ever so slightly to improve fuel economy \u2014 and prove that an American car can make the grade without a hybrid drive. Adjustments are mostly under the hood where the engineers tweaked the intake and exhaust valve lift duration, swapped the transmission gear ratios for lower operating revs, and put on some low-rolling-resistance tires. The result may only be 1 mpg over the previous year, but that's a step in the right direction. Like the other cars that take the lighter approach, the biggest gains are found at highway speeds. City: 25 mpg Highway: 37 mpg Combined: 30 mpg Advantage Over Camry: Highway MSRP: $15,225\n\n2009 Mini Cooper (Manual)\n\nFans of the Mini Cooper have always been able to boast about all the fun they have driving their itsy-bitsy British bimmer \u2014 so much fun that they forget to mention that it gets stellar gas mileage. Though not as useful as a Camry as a family vehicle, the Mini is at least a few hundred times more fun and gets a combined mileage just 2 mpg short of the big hybrid. There are no tricks here. The Mini is just a well-engineered, sufficiently-powered small car offered with a sixth gear. City: 28 mpg Highway: 37 mpg Combined: 32 mpg Advantage Over Camry: Highway MSRP: $19,200\n\n2009 Toyota Yaris (Manual)\n\nAll of the 2009 Yaris models equipped with the manual transmission get the same EPA mileage, so you're not necessarily stuck with a little three-door hatch if that's your route towards mileage. The five-door S hatch comes equipped with rear-window wipers, fog lights, MP3\/CD player w\/ iPod interface and other nice features, though you'll have to tack on $3,000 to the base price. Though it can't quite compete with the Camry in city driving, this tiny Toyota does better on the highway and is close on the combined cycle. City: 29 mpg Highway: 36 Combined: 32 mpg Advantage Over Camry: Highway MSRP: $12,205\n\n2009 Mercury Mariner Hybrid\n\nWe found the 2008 Mariner Hybrid to be a fairly decent ride with only a few flaws, many of which were addressed with the 2009 refresh. The Mariner Hybrid, and it's twin brother Escape Hybrid, is most similar to the Camry in that it offers power, luxury and good gas mileage in a single package \u2014 an SUV package at that. Though slightly off the Camry's total, this is one of the few vehicles that bests the Toyota in the city. City: 34 mpg Highway: 31 mpg Combined: 32 mpg Advantage Over Camry: City MSRP: $29,750\n\n2009 Volkswagen Jetta & Jetta SportWagen TDI (Manual)\n\nBoth the Volkswagen Jetta TDI and its wagon sibling the SportWagen are within the Camry's price range and offer the utility, relative luxury and foreign car appeal of the Toyota. Unlike the Camry, the Jettas are both eligible for a tax credit. In the ongoing diesel-versus-hybrid debate the TDI twins step up with a comparable combined cycle and a substantially higher highway experience, a reflection of the efficiency and power of the diesel engine. And there's no risk of running short because of battery supplies. City: 30 mpg Highway: 41 mpg Combined: 34 mpg Advantage Over Camry: Highway MSRP: $21,990\/$23,590\n\n2009 Nissan Altima Hybrid\n\nNissan is still technically selling the Altima Hybrid, a car that is a direct competitor with the Camry, but sales have lagged far behind nearly all of its competitors. Why? It may have something to do with battery supply, but it also may have something to do with the reason why people are choosing the regular Camry over the regular Altima: age. The Altima, though refreshed, is a rather tired design that lacks the same appeal and luxury of the Toyota. It trumps the better-selling green sedan in the city, but no one seems to care. City: 35 mpg Highway: 33 mpg Combined: 34 mpg Advantage Over Camry: City MSRP: $26,650\n\n2009 Honda Civic Hybrid\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid, currently the third-best selling hybrid car behind the Camry, bests the Camry in all areas of fuel economy by a large margin. It's smaller. It's lighter. The Prius is more of a competitor to this hybrid than the Camry, though Toyota has done a good job of making their larger hybrid price competitive with the Civic sedan. City: 40 Highway: 45 Combined: 42 mpg Advantage Over Camry: City, Highway, Combined MSRP: $23,550\n\n2009 Toyota Prius\n\nThe king. The reigning champ. The green boss. You can't touch the Prius and neither can the Camry Hybrid \u2014 at least not in mileage. Though all of these buyers are likely eco-minded, some hybrid huggers just don't like the Prius, don't want a hatchback or maybe just think the larger hybrid sedan is a perfect foil. City: 48 mpg Highway: 45 mpg Combined: 46 mpg Advantage: City, Highway, Combined MSRP: $22,000 [Hybrid Sales Data: Fuel Economy Data:]",
