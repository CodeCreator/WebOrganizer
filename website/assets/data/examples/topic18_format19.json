        "text":"- Religions in Literature\n\nLiterature Reference List (by name of denomination\/religion\/tribe):\nRelated Pages:\n\nMiller's Canticle, set in a Catholic monastery in post-apocalyptic Utah, remains one of the most important examples of religious science fiction.\n\nThis list contains 34,420 citations from literature (primarily science fiction and fantasy novels and stories) referring to actual churches, religions and tribes. This list is intended for literary research only. This is not a source of information about religion.\n\nWhich source material has been indexed?\nThis database is not comprehensive in that all works of science fiction have not been indexed. But this may be thought of as a sampling. Much of the literature currently indexed was chosen simply because it was available at the local library. Additionally, certain non-arbitrary collections of literature have been indexed:\n\n  \u2022 Hugo Award-winning novels (100% complete)\n  \u2022 Nebula Award-winning novels (100% complete)\n  \u2022 Locus Award-winning s.f. novels (100% complete)\n  \u2022 Locus Award-winning dark fantasy\/horror novels (100% complete)\n  \u2022's \"25 Best sf\/f novels of the century\" (100% complete)\n  \u2022 Sidewise Award-winning novels (100% complete); Sidewise nominated novels (68%)\n  \u2022 All stories in The Modern Classics of Science Fiction (Dozois) and The Norton Book of Science Fiction (Le Guin)\n  \u2022 Campbell Award-winning books (100% of 1st place winners and 89% of 2nd and 3rd place winners have been indexed)\n  \u2022 Star Trek: Voyager novels (92% complete); DS9 novels (88%); TNG novels (73%); New Frontier novels (100%)\n  \u2022 World Fantasy Award-winning novels (85% complete)\n  \u2022 Tiptree Award winners (65% complete)\n  \u2022 Locus Award-winning fantasy novels (63% complete)\n  \u2022 Philip K. Dick Award-winning novels (45% complete)\n  \u2022 X-Men novels (44% complete)\n  \u2022 Over 350 other novels and anthologies\n\nAt the close of 2000, 69 different novels have won the Hugo or Nebula award (some won both). 26 novels have won the Campbell Award. (A total of 84 books have won Campbell awards if one counts 2nd and 3rd place Campbell awards in addition to 1st place.) 20 novels have won the Philip K. Dick award. A total of 133 awards have been given for the Nebula or Hugo best novel, the 1st place Campbell award, or the Philip K. Dick award. These 133 awards have gone to 110 distinct books (many have won multiple awards).\n\nNote that only Engish-language works have been indexed. The \"Works Indexed\" page lists all novels and stories indexed for the database.\n\nAs the list below indicates, certain religious groups are mentioned in science fiction more often than others. For instance, Catholicism, Judaism and Islam, and of course Christianity in general, are frequently mentioned religious groups. Many English-language science fiction novels feature in-depth literary exploration or detailed depictions of real-life religious cultures. Nearly always this is done within the Western Judeo-Christian-Muslim tradition, most often with Catholicism. In addition to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the two religions which round out the \"Big Five\"--Hinduism and Buddhism--are mentioned frequently, but almost always briefly and in passing. These patterns are not surprising and reflect the background of most English-language authors. Other contemporary religions, including Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Jainism, and the Baha'i faith, are referred to very rarely.\n\nThe primary factors determining which religious groups are referred to most often are:\n\n  1. the religious affiliation of authors (There are more Catholic SF\/F writers than Protestant, which is one of the reasons there are more references to Catholicism than Protestantism.)\n\n  2. which religions have many adherents (Islam is mentioned frequently in futuristic literature, because many non-Muslim writers envision Muslims as a distinct and important people far into the future.)\n\n  3. which religions are interesting and culturally distinctive (Many SF\/F writers mention Latter-day Saints specifically, but few mention Presbyterians.)\n\nIt may also be mentioned that time travel and alternative history stories are more likely to contain references to Catholicism than any other religion because the Catholic Church was the dominant institution during many of the key periods of historical, intellectual and technological development in Western history, and most SF\/F writers are from a Western background. After the European Enlightenment period and the Protestant Reformation the link between church and state was much weaker in the West. Accordingly, religion features less prominently in most time travel and alternative history stories after that period.\n\nOnce again, this list is intended for literary research. Many references to religious groups within science fiction and fantasy literature are positive or neutral. But many references are negative. This is not necessarily a reflection of the religious groups, but of the nature of the writers and of mainstream literature. The science fiction field naturally attracts many writers with alternative viewpoints. The percentage of writers from groups which are statistical minorities in the U.S., such as atheists, Jews, agnostics, Catholics, etc., is far higher than in the general population. As with other genres, culturally dominant groups and institutions are far more likely candidates for criticism within literature than minority groups.\n\nThe religious groups which are portrayed most negatively in science fiction (based on the number and degree of negative references, starting with the most negatively portrayed) are: the Ku Klux Klan, Nazis, Communists, televangelists, Thugees (Kali worshippers), Christian Fundamentalists, Shi'ite\/Muslim fundamentalists, and Baptists.\n\nCertain archetypes or stereotypes are commonly found among religious characters in mainstream science fiction. There is the academically and philosophically talented Catholic priest who surprises those around him with his open-minded, self-effacing manner. While there is an abundance of priests and nuns among science fiction characters, practicing lay Catholics are rarely used. Protestantism is all too frequently represented by a hate-mongering or greedy conservative preacher who is more caricature than character. The speech, ideas, and characteristics of these Protestant preachers (often Baptist or Baptist-like) usually seem drawn from televangelists. Evangelical televangelists have become \"stock villains\" in science fiction, especially since the end of the Cold War. Latter-day Saints use a lay ministry, so there are no Latter-day Saint preacher characters. Latter-day Saint characters in science fiction are frequently soldiers, law enforcement officials, engineers, or political leaders, and are usually characterized as pious, prayerful, and family-oriented, but rather insular.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a stereotypical character type for Jews or Muslims. The Islamic world as a whole is often portrayed as an enemy nation in historical, near-future science fiction and thrillers, and Islam is frequently written as an important and thriving religious culture long into the future. But individual Muslim characters fill a variety of roles, as scientists, businessmen, allies or conquerors. In their religiosity, Muslim and Jewish characters range from devout believers to non-practicing non-believers.\n\nJews are the most diversely portrayed religious minority in science fiction. This can be attributed partially to the disproportionately large number of Jews (mostly non-practicing) who have written award-winning science fiction and used Jews as main characters. Also, because of the predominance of anti-Semitism in Western culture in the past the Holocaust, mainstream writers are particularly careful to avoid stereotyping this ethnic\/religious group. Another factor which has contributed to the more balanced (and more frequent) portrayal of Jews in science fiction is the prominence of Jews in the scientific and other academic professions.\n\nSome comments about methodology\nAn important distinction about this database is that indexes references to \"religions\" and not to \"religion.\" This means the references are to groups of people, and not references to general religious topics. This database does not index literary references to topics such as \"God\", \"love\", \"tolerance\", \"faith\", \"epistemology\", \"salvation\", etc. It does contain references to \"Catholic\", \"Islam\", \"Judaism\", \"Amish\", \"Hopi\", etc.\n\nNearly all fiction (and certainly most science fiction and fantasy) addresses some of the same universal human themes that religion addresses. A significant proportion of science fiction novels which have won Hugo, Nebula or Campbell awards are primarily religious in theme, with scientific or futuristic issues absent or secondary. (Examples include: A Case of Conscience by James Blish; A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller, Jr. Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein; Way Station by Clifford D. Simak; Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny; To Your Scattered Bodies Go by Philip Jose Farmer; Dreamsnake by Vonda McIntyre; The Fountains of Paradise by Arthur C. Clarke; Hyperion by Dan Simmons; Doomsday Book by Connie Willis; Stations of the Tide by Michael Swanwick; The Alteration by Kingsley Amis; The Terminal Experiment by Robert J. Sawyer. On Wings of Song by Disch. Some of these are primarily about abstract religious themes; some are about religions and churches as social institutions, and their history, future, or interaction with society and change. Some are about both. It is amazing how many Hugo-, Nebula, and Campbell-winning science fiction novels have Catholic institutions, clergy, and terminology mentioned on nearly every page.)\n\nAll works of literature are influenced by the religious beliefs and culture of the author. But it would be impossible, for example, to include in this list any novel written by a Christian author which contains a generic Christian theme, such as rede... (truncated)",

Abdias, Apostolic History of, extant Latin collection of legends earlier circulated separately in Greek on the eleven Apostles and Paul. The contents are drawn chiefly from the canonical Gospels and Acts, from the Clementine literature and from heretical Acts. It was put together not earlier than 6th or 7th cent., probably in France. The preface asserts that Julius Africanus took the material from books written in Hebrew by Abdias (Obadiah), Bishop of Babylon, about the Apostles.\n\n2. Abgarus, Epistles of Christ and, a work Eusebius (Histories 1.13) claims to have found in the archives of Edessa, and to have translated into Greek from Syriac. It consisted of two short letters: one from King Abgar V Ukkama to Christ, asking him to come and heal him, recognizing his divinity, and offering a safe city; a second, in which Christ replies that he will send someone after his ascension. No one today defends their authenticity. The letters (probably early 4th cent.) form part of the Acts of Thaddeus. In a similar account in Syriac, the Doctrina Addaei (c 400 A. D.) Jesus replies only orally via Ananias, who brings a portrait of Jesus he had painted.\n\n3. Allogenes Supreme, a Gnostic work, in Coptic, found at Chenoboskion, Egypt, in 1946, probably written early in the 3d century. Porphyry reports that Plotinus the great Neoplatonist, fought against five apocalypses. This work may be one of the five.\n\n4. Andrew, Acts of, an apocryphon telling of the travels, wonders, discourses, and martyrdom of Andrew. Scant remains of the original Greek are extant, dating from 2d or 3d century. There is also a shortened Latin form edited by Gregory of Tours. It is likely that Gregory pruned out unorthodox thoughts, such as the sweeping ascetic attack on marriage. Eusebius (Hiss. eccl. 3:25.6-7) puts it among the \"forgeries of heretics.\" Epiphanius (Heresies 47) reports it was liked by the Encratites, the Apostolics, and the Origenians. Scholars disagree on Gnostic influence in these Acts. The account of the martyrdom also circulated independently. It includes an address to his cross in a long sermon.\n\n5. Andrew, Fragmentary Story of, an extant Coptic fragment, an incident from one of the oriental Acts of the Apostles. A dog tells Andrew that a woman in the desert killed her illegitimate child and fed it to him. Andrew causes the dog to disgorge, the fragments are joined, and the child lives again.\n\n6. Andrew and Matthias (Matthew), Acts of, an apocryphon telling how Jesus appeared to Andrew, told him to go to rescue Matthias who was then in his 27th day of captivity by cannibals who planned to eat him on the 30th day. Andrew boards a ship piloted by Jesus himself (whom Andrew does not then recognize) and so tells Jesus of his own earlier exploits. Andrew rescues Matthias, works many miracles, is tortured, cured by Jesus, nearly submerges the city by a miracle, saves it when the people repent, then baptizes them. The story is extant in Greek and Syriac and also in a Latin version prefixed by Gregory of Tours to his Latin edition of the Acts of Andrew. The Acts probably originated in Egypt. Matthias and Matthew are confused in the account.\n\n7. Andrew and Paul, Acts of, an extent Coptic tale of fantastic adventures. Paul dives into the sea, reaches the underworld, visits with Judas. Andrew and Paul come to a city, find the gates locked, and cause them to disappear into the ground. They convert some 27,000 Jews.\n\n8. Apostles, Epistle of the, the most important of the apocryphal epistles, completely unknown until 1895 when a Coptic version was found at Cairo. It probably originated in Asia Minor or Egypt in mid-2a century. It tells of the birth, miracles, and Resurrection of Jesus; then the epistle form is discontinued, and the apocalyptic form used: Jesus answers questions on the date of the parousia, the universal resurrec tion, judgment, and signs. Finally, the Ascension is described. The writer used the NT, esp. St. John, and also the Apocalypse of Peter, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Shepherd of Hermas. A few Gnostic tinges appear, but on the whole it is anti-Gnostic.\n\n9. Arabic Gospel of the Infancy, a late compilation, heavily emphasizing the miraculous, on the infancy of Jesus. The first part depends on the Protoevangelium of James, the second part on the Gospel of Thomas, with the addition of many new and strange incidents in intervening chapters. The original was probably Syriac. Existing copies depend on an Arabic MS first published in 1697.\n\n10. Armenian Gospel of the Infancy, a late apoc ryphon, drawing heavily on the Protoevangelium of James and the Gospel of Thomas. Its stories are very wordy, containing dialogues of unusual length.\n\n11. Assumption of the Virgin, a group of apocryphal works, probably from the 4th cent., though the nucleus may go back to 3d, perhaps originating in Egypt. There are two chief forms. In the Coptic version, Jesus appears before the Apostles depart and tells Mary of her coming death and assumption. In the form found in Greek, Latin, and Syriac, the Apostles have already left, but at her request are transported back on clouds. Pope Pius XII defining the Assumption did not rest at all on these dubious accounts; rather, he ignored them in his survey of the development of the belief, and appealed instead to a facet of the virtually unanimous patristic New Eve tradition.\n\n12. Barnabas, Acts of, a brief apocryphal work, extant in Greek, not earlier than the 5th cent., telling of the travels of Barnabas with Paul, and later without Paul, and of his martyrdom. It pretends to have been composed by Mark. It is largely an imaginative expansion of parts of the canonical Acts, much more sober than most apocrypha.\n\n13. Bartholomew, Gospel of, a work mentioned by St. Jerome (Prologue to Matthew) and the Gelasian Decree. It is not sure that either knew the book. If it exists, it is probably to be identified with the Questions of Bartholomew, extant in Greek, Latin, and Slavonic. It is not earlier than the 5th cent., though perhaps based on much earlier materials, perhaps Gnostic. It contains answers made by Jesus after the Resurrection, by Mary and by Satan, in reply to Bartholomew. They deal chiefly with Christ's descent into hell, the annunciation to Mary, a vision of the bottomless pit given to the Apostles, Satan's replies on the sin and fall of the angels, and a short passage on the deadly sins.\n\n14. Bartholomew the Apostle, Book of the Resurrection of Christ by, a Coptic apocryphon, probably from the 5th or 6th cent., a loosely strung together set of fanciful narratives mostly on the Resurrection of Christ and his descent into hell Stories from canonical Gospels are expanded altered, and combined. It contains strange inconsistencies: Jesus is twice buried; Thomas, who had raised his own son from the dead and made him bp., later on the same day doubts the Resurrection of Jesus.\n\n15. Basilides, Gospel of, an apocryphal gospel known to Origen (Homily on Luke 1), Jerome, and Ambrose. Eusebius (Hiss. eccl. 4:7 6-7) mentions 24 books on the Gospel by Basilides. Clement of Alexandria (Stromata 4. 12) cites several passages from an Exegetica of Basilides. Hegemonius (Acta Archelai 67.4-11) also cites such a passage. According to Irenaeus (Heresies 1:24.3-4) Basilides was an Egyptian Gnostic of the early 2d century. Perhaps he revised the canonical Gospels to make them conform to his view, then commented on his work.\n\n16. Corinthians, Third Epistle to the, apocryphon contained in the Acts of Paul. It is supposedly an answer to a letter sent by the Corinthians to Paul in which they reported that the heretics Simon and Cleobius taught that we must not use the prophets, that God is not almighty, that there will be no resurrection, that man was not made by God, that Christ did not become incarnate, that the world was made by angels, not by God.\n\n17. Dositheus, Apocalypse of, a Gnostic work written in Coptic, found at Chenoboskion, Egypt, in 1946. It has the subtitle, \"The Three Great Steles of Seth.\" It has not yet been published or sufficiently studied.\n\n18. Ebionites, Gospel of the, an apocryphal gospel, probably of the first half of the 2d or early 3d cent., probably written E of the Jordan. Fragments are quoted by Epiphanius (Heresies 30.13, 14, 16, 22). The confused and unclear state of ancient testimony leaves modern scholars divided on how many Jewish-Christian gospels there may have been. Probably there were three: of the Nazareans, of the Ebionites, of the Hebrews Some believe the last two are identical works; others identify the Gospel of the Ebionites with the Gospel of the Twelve Apostles mentioned by Origen (Homil. in Luke 1). The Gospel of the Ebionites seems to have denied the virgin birth, averring that the union of a heavenly being with the man Jesus resulted in the Christ, the Son of God (a Gnostic trait). Jesus was to annul sacrifices. The work also appears to teach vegetarianism.\n\n19. Egyptians' Gospel According to the, an apocryphal Greek gospel current in Egypt in the 2d cent., cited by Clement of Alexandria (Stromata 3.6, 9, 13). The citations show Gnostic opposition to marriage. It is also mentioned, unfavorably, by Origen, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius. Only fragments are extant. It seems to be unrelated to a Book of the Great Invisible Spirit or Gospel of the Egyptians, found at Chenoboskion in 1946.\n\n20. Eugnostos, Letter of, a Gnostic work, written in Coptic, found at Chenoboskion, Egypt, in 1946. Soter, the bisexual creator, and Sophia Pangeneteira, the feminine counterpart of Soter, produce six bisexual spirits. The sixth of these is Archigeneter (male)-Pistis Sophia (female). Another Chenoboskion work, \"Wisdom of Jesus\" is based on this letter. In the former, Pistis Sophia is one of the aeons.\n\n21. Hebrews, Gospel according to the, an apocryphal Gospel, probably from the first half of the 2d cent., perhaps fro... (truncated)",
