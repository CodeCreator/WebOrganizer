        "text":"27 November 2020 - #Sustainability #Planet\n\nHydrogen: Zero emissions and practical\n\nElectric cars are on the rise in passenger transport. In goods transport, fuel cells seem to offer the greatest potential. Hydrogen-powered lorries can be refuelled normally, have a good range and offer sufficient transport capacity. Emmi now has two H2 lorries from Hyundai that run on \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen on the road.\n\nWe supply our Swiss customers with fresh dairy products on a daily basis. To do so, around 8,000 pallets have to be taken from A to B every day. We have 140 vehicles in operation for this purpose, which cover a total of 9.3 million kilometres every year. Although we are constantly renewing our lorry fleet and training our drivers in climate friendly driving, this results in considerable CO2 emissions. We have shifted some of our transport to rail in recent years, but this environmentally friendly means of transport has various limitations.\n\n\nOutgrowing the prototype stage\n\nIt is therefore very important to us to find an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional diesel lorries. However, until now no means of transport has met the high requirements in terms of transport capacity, range and economy.\n\nHydrogen technology offers a range of benefits:\n\n  \u2022 Emissions: Hydrogen (H2) trucks emit water vapour rather than CO2 and other pollutants. Emmi\u2019s H2 trucks will be fuelled via Hydrospider\u2019s\u00a0network of filling stations, which supply 100% emission-free hydrogen. Every H2 truck that replaces a conventional diesel truck will therefore help save around 70 to 80 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n  \u2022 Range: A truck can cover around 400 kilometres on one tank. This is on a par with conventional diesel trucks.\n  \u2022 Handling: A H2 vehicle can be filled just like a diesel or petrol vehicle.\n  \u2022 Freight use: Using hydrogen as a fuel also permits smooth operation of auxiliary units (e.g. cold store).\n\nAs a member of the Association pro H2 mobility Switzerland we are at the forefront of efforts to establish this new mobility technology for freight transport. For example, we have just taken delivery of the first two H2 trucks from the South Korean automobile manufacturer Hyundai. These will now undergo extensive testing in Emmi\u2019s day-to-day fresh products logistics processes. Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility\n\nFor a better tomorrow Associaton pro H2 mobility Switzerland\n\nOn the move together Hydrospider\n\nWe produce the fuel of tomorrow\n\nWelcome to Emmi Stories\n\nPerspectives and stories about Emmi, our products and the people behind of it all\n\n\n\nBeste Milchmomente auch f\u00fcr kommende Generationen\n\nWe respect your privacy\n\nOur website uses cookies and analytical tools to optimise your experience on our website.

Losquadro, Councilwoman Jane Bonner and Councilwoman Valerie Cartright have announced the completion of a 19-road paving project in Coram\u2019s W-section.\n\nCaption: Councilwoman Cartright, Superintendent Losquadro and Councilwoman Bonner on Whitmore Lane in Coram.\n\n\nIn addition to the milling and paving of 19 roads, this project involved extensive concrete work prior to paving. Crews installed more than 15,080 square feet of aprons and 3,000 linear feet of curb at a cost of $323,726. With the milling and paving costs of $992,636, the total cost for this paving project was $1.3 million.\n\n\nRoads paved during this project include Birchfield Court, Catherine Street, Elm Avenue, Linden Street, Walton Way, Welbourn Lane, Welling Way, Wellsley Court, Wellsley Lane, Westbrook Road, Whinstone Street, Whitfield Lane, Whitmore Lane, Whitney Lane, William Street, Wilmont Turn, Woodbine Street, Wycomb Court, and Wycomb Place.\n\n\nSuperintendent Losquadro said, \u201cBecause of the size of this neighborhood \u2013 and the state of deterioration of so many of the roadways \u2013 it was necessary to split this paving project into two phases. I was happy to complete phase one, bringing much relief to area residents and motorists, and I look forward to returning to this neighborhood to complete phase two next year.\u201d\n\n\nCouncilwoman Bonner said, \u201cThanks to the men and women of the Highway Department, these newly paved roads are ready for the winter months. The safety of our residents is a top priority and I will continue to work with Superintendent Losquadro to identify roads that need repaving in the future.\u201d\n\n\nCouncilwoman Cartright said, \u201cThe Highway Department continues to work its way through the Town to address paving concerns throughout Brookhaven. This project, which is in a central area of Brookhaven, is a positive continuation of the long-term efforts to address all of Brookhaven's 3,500 miles of roadway.\u201d",

Box 600\nTrenton, NJ\nContact: Joe Dee or Tim Greeley\nRELEASE: July 2, 2012\n\nRoute 33 bridge repairs over Peddie Lake\nto require truck detour in Hightstown\n\n(Trenton) - The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) today announced a project to repair the Route 33 (Main Street) bridge over Peddie Lake\/Rocky Brook in downtown Hightstown, Mercer County.\n\nBeginning Thursday night, July 5, NJDOT\u2019s contractor, Berto Construction Inc., is scheduled to set up the new construction zone on the southbound side of the bridge. To accommodate that work, NJDOT will close the existing southbound travel lane on Route 33 and shift two-way traffic onto the northbound side of the bridge. This new traffic pattern will result in the reduction of one northbound travel lane over the bridge.\n\n\u2022 The current northbound travel lane will be used as the new southbound travel lane.\n\u2022 The current northbound right turn lane will be used as a combination through and right-turn lane.\n\u2022 The bridge will be closed to pedestrian traffic on the southbound side.\n\nIn connection with these lane shifts, NJDOT will restrict large trucks \u2013 more than 7 tons in weight - from traversing the bridge during construction. Local delivery trucks weighing more than 7 tons will have access into Hightstown to make deliveries, but will not be allowed to cross the bridge.\n\nTruck Detours\n\u2022 Route 33 northbound\/eastbound trucks needing to access the NJ Turnpike Exit 8 interchange will be directed to use Route 130 northbound to Route 133 eastbound.\n\u2022 CR 539 northbound trucks will be directed to use CR 571 to Route 130 northbound.\n\u2022 Route 33 southbound\/westbound trucks will be directed to use Route 133 westbound to Route 130 southbound.\n\u2022 CR 539 southbound trucks will be directed to use Route 130 southbound to CR 571 eastbound.\n\nAmple signage has been installed throughout the area to alert truck drivers of the weight restriction and corresponding detour routes.\n\nThe existing bridge was damaged during Hurricane Irene in September 2011. During that flood event, the water level overtopped the Peddie Lake dam causing severe damage to the bridge parapet walls on both sides of the bridge. The Department immediately installed temporary median barrier along the parapets and sidewalks to protect vehicles and pedestrians until permanent repairs could be made.\n\nThe approximately $655,000 project will fully replace the damaged sidewalks and parapets on both sides of the bridge including new bridge rails. The parapet and pedestrian safety rails adjacent to the Hightstown Engine Co. #1 Fire House will also be repaired. The new bridge parapets will be constructed of stone facing similar in color, size and texture to the existing stone.\n\nRoadway drainage pipes and outlets pipes in the vicinity of the bridge will be replaced. Route 33 will be repaved and restriped between Stockton Street and Franklin Street on either side of the bridge and the signage and pedestrian cross walks will be replaced as needed within the project limits.\n\nApproximately 16,000 vehicles use this bridge every day through the heart of Hightstown. NJDOT has scheduled the construction in stages so that one travel lane on Route 33 in both directions will remain open to passenger vehicle traffic at all times. Dynamic message signs will notify motorists of upcoming traffic pattern changes. NJDOT anticipates the project being completed in fall 2012.\n\nThe precise timing of the work is subject to change due to weather or other factors.

        "text":"ABA Foundation Report Says Motorcoach Manufacturing Sales Continues Steady Growth\n\nABA Foundation Report Says Motorcoach Manufacturing Sales Continues Steady Growth\n\nToday the American Bus Association Foundation (ABAF) released the first quarter 2017 Motorcoach Builder Survey. Based on surveys of the major motorcoach manufacturers that sell vehicles in the United States and Canada, motorcoach sales from the participating manufacturers remained virtually unchanged over the prior year to a total of 803 units (547 new coaches and 256 pre-owned coaches).\n\n\u201cLast year, especially the fourth quarter, was very strong for motorcoach sales,\u201d said ABA Foundation President Peter Pantuso. \u201cWe are seeing the same trend for 2017. The industry continues to grow and we have seen an upward trajectory with sales over the past few years since the end of the recession.\u201d\n\nSales for the first quarter were dominated by private sales of new 45-foot motorcoaches, which saw an 18.5 percent increase over the same period in 2016. The less than 45-foot sales saw a slight decrease in the first quarter but are expected to pick up as the year progresses.\n\n\u201cWe did see an increase in bigger buses this quarter, which is always a good sign for group travel,\u201d said Pantuso. \u201cWhile the quarter over quarter remained unchanged, the first quarter is usually a slower period for sales, but we expect sales of all sizes of coaches to pick up through the year.\u201d\n\n\nAbout the Report\n\nData were collected by John Dunham & Associates for the American Bus Association Foundation. John Dunham & Associates is a leading New York City-based economic consulting firm specializing in the economics of fast moving issues. Data reflect updated results from prior.\u00a0 Changes in data definitions and reporting occurred over the past quarter and are reflected in these figures.\n\nAbout the ABA Foundation\n\nThe American Bus Association Foundation (ABAF) is the scholarship and research arm of the motorcoach, tour and travel industry. The largest non-profit in motorcoach group travel, the ABAF distributes $100,000 a year in scholarships to industry families and invests in research to demonstrate the important role motorcoach transportation plays in society.\n\nAbout the American Bus Association\n\nThe American Bus Association (ABA) is the trade organization of the intercity bus industry, with more than 1,000 motorcoach and tour company members in the United States and Canada. Its members operate charter, tour, regular route, airport express, special operations and contract services. Another 2,800 members are travel and tourism organizations and suppliers of bus products and services who work in partnership with the North American motorcoach industry.\n\n\nMelanie Hinton, Director of Communications & Media Relations, ABA\nOffice: (202) 218-7220\nEmail: .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address)",

At the moment European legislation states that locomotive drivers must be B1 level competency in every country in which they drive a train.\nThis means that rail freight operators must invest in expensive training and that they must carefully roster their train drivers to only drive on certain routes. In addition, when lines are closed for planned engineering works or during an unforeseen event and there is a need to divert a train, the absence of a driver with suitable language skills can result in the cancellation of the train. This issue was highlighted in a dramatic way following the Rastatt tunnel collapse incident of 2017.\n\n\nReason why ERFA urges the European Commission to adopt a simple and pragmatic approach in the implementation of the proposal of amending Annex VI of the Train Driver Directive to allow pilots of changes to language requirements for cross border traffic.\n\n\nThe ERFA long term aim is to eradicate the need for B1 training for drivers and improve the flexibility, reliability and efficiency of the offering to customers identifing English as a common language, across all rail networks, on a similar basis to airlines.\n\nLinked documents\n\nERFA Input paper on simplification of language requirements ( ERFA Language input paper-1529938627.pdf )",

By spraying air across the bottom of the ship\u2019s hull, the SAVER Air system reduces friction with seawater, improving the fuel efficiency of the 334 meter long vessels.\n\nAuCom is proud to be a part of this milestone project, having supplied the medium voltage soft starters required for the project in partnership with MTEC, our exclusive distributor in Korea. The 6.6 kV type tested and marine approved soft starters are needed to run the 670 kW compressors that supply air to the SAVER Air system.\n\nThe \u2018Neo-Panamax\u2019 designation given to these new vessels indicates their suitability for navigating the newly expanded Panama Canal (a project that also utilized AuCom soft starters).

The prototype of a self-driving car the company has developed is a step towards a comprehensive set of driverless technologies for application across a wide range of industries.\n\nThe driverless car incorporates Yandex\u2019s own technologies some of which, such as mapping, real-time navigation, computer vision and object recognition, have been functioning in a range of the company\u2019s services for years. The self-driving vehicle\u2019s ability to \u2018make decisions\u2019 in complex environments, such as busy city traffic, is ensured by Yandex\u2019s proprietary computing algorithms, artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\n\u201cSelf-driving cars are set to revolutionalise the way we commute within a matter of a decade,\u201d says Dmitry Polishchuk, head of Yandex.Taxi Self-Driving Project. \u201cAt this point in time, there are dozens of companies around the world building their own driverless cars, but only a few of them have components crucial for turning this project into reality. These components include a stack of reliable technologies and algorithms, engineering expertise and resources, and access to the market for self-driving vehicles. Yandex.Taxi, with the backing of Yandex, is one of the few players who can boast of possessing all of the above.\u201d\n\nYandex.Taxi\u2019s effort in developing the self-driving car technology aims at creating a fully-fledged autopilot functionality, which is described as Level 5, according to the currently universally accepted classification system for automated vehicles. This system classes all self-driving cars into levels from 0 to 5, where Level 0 means a person has full control over the vehicle, and Level 5 involves no human intervention.\n\nYandex.Taxi will push on with experimenting and honing the self-driving technology, together with improving maps, navigation and route planning implemented in this project. Tests on public roads are expected to kick off next year.\n\nWith Yandex.Taxi test-driving the self-driving service, Yandex looks forward to partnering with car manufacturers and other companies interested in taking the autonomous car technology to the road.\n\n1 comment\nAbubeker Refaw\n7 January 2018, 15:11\nYour writing and blog have been life changing.

        "text":"A close-up on Berlin (III)\n\nILA 2016: A System of Systems approach\n\nThe very first thing to grab your attention is the tons of equipment that has been flown in to Berlin by the German Air Force. There are things everywhere you look \u2013 occupying every corner and thundering past high up in the air. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Tornado combat jets, the A310 MedEvac, a medical evacuation aircraft for airlifting casualties with severe injuries, the new Airbus A400M transport, the old Transall C-160, plus the CH-53, NH90 and \u201cTiger\u201d helicopters and unmanned reconnaissance systems. The Navy, Army and military medical services, too, are all exhibiting at the 2016 ILA Berlin Air Show. Together, they make the Bundeswehr the largest individual exhibitor at the event. And this is no coincidence, given that the German Air Force celebrates its 60th anniversary this year.\u00a0\n\nFor the first two days of the air show, the trade visitor days, the spotlight was on the individual systems and all kinds of new equipment. For the second two days, when the event opened to the general public, the focus shifted to sparking an interest in the forces, as well as to the big flying display. Within the space of just a few minutes, a total of 19 fighter jets, helicopters and transport aircraft took to the skies above the exhibition center on Friday. The Air Force refers to this spectacle as the \u201cair parade\u201d. More or less all of the major aircraft types operated by the Armed Forces today participated in the flyover.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA system that delivers real added value\n\nThe air parade also features a demonstration of a military evacuation operation, which lasted just short of half an hour. With six helicopters and two transport aircraft, soldiers staged a mock rescue of civilians. To show that the work of the Armed Forces extends beyond purely military activities, a forest fire fighting demonstration was performed, in which four helicopters extinguished a simulated fire. To round off the day\u2019s events, the Transall took to the skies again. Six paratroopers jumped from the rear loading door holding a German flag. The Air Force had flown in equipment to Berlin from all over Germany especially for the air show.\n\nAs a result, the Federal Armed Forces Pavilion in hall 3 was transformed into a realistic Air Force center. For the Air Force, the event is about more than just putting individual arms, aircraft or vehicles on display. It takes a Systems of Systems approach, which is not about autonomous sub-systems, but rather the intelligent integration and interaction of these sub-systems \u2013 especially of manned and unmanned components \u2013 to create a large-scale system that delivers real added value.\n\nGround staff also urgently required\n\nSome 600 soldiers and civilian employees are representing the Bundeswehr at the air show, according to its own figures. Piquing young people\u2019s interest in joining the forces is high on the agenda. When entering the Federal Armed Forces Pavilion, it soon becomes clear that there are plenty of jobs within the Bundeswehr that are not associated with armed service, and this has been the case for quite some time now. Ground staff are also urgently required, trained, for example, in avionics and electronics. Staff to work with the various reconnaissance systems are likewise in demand. Accordingly, the Careers Truck was once again on site to enable visitors and school groups to find out more about military and civilian career opportunities with the Bundeswehr.\n\nImpressions of ILA, Day 3\n\n  \u2022 At the \"CareerCenter\" MTU-trainees explain the V2500 engine.\n\n  \u2022 Solo display: the MiG-29.\n\n  \u2022 Want to\u00a0meet some astronauts?\u00a0That\u00b4s what the Space-Pavillon is for.\n\n  \u2022 Friday's Ambassador Day.\n\n  \u2022 Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces of Germany Dr. Hans-Peter Bartels visits MTU.\n\n  \u2022 \u00a0Ambassador of the Republic of Korea:\u00a0H.E.

        "text":"US Preparatory Activities\n\nPreparatory activities are underway on the US side of the project and include utility relocation, survey work and preliminary site investigation. As well, Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), continues with property acquisition, demolition and site remediation.\n\nClearance Activities\n\nWindsor-Detroit Bridge Authority (WDBA), in partnership with the state of Michigan, is working to prepare the US Port of Entry (POE). Through funds provided by Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority (WDBA), the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is acquiring the Michigan properties required to build the US POE and the bridge footings. Prior to any property demolition, a preliminary site investigation (PSI) is completed.\u00a0 This includes the collection of soil samples for environmental testing. MDOT and its partners work to ensure all demolitions are competed safely with minimized disruption to the community and are in accordance with local, state and federal guidelines.\n\nA machine knocks down an abandoned house\n\nProperty demolition\n\nA red machine clears an open property\n\nPreliminary Site Investigation\n\nUtility Relocation\n\nMDOT is working with utility companies to identify the utilities located within the land required for the US POE, the bridge footings and Michigan interchange and which must be relocated. Relocation designs and schedules have commenced with many local utilities and some of these relocations are already complete.\n\nA white crane clears a property next to a blue house\n\nExcavating an underground utility trench\n\nRed pipes are placed in the ground behind an orange fence\n\nInstalling concrete utility duct\n\nWDBA and MDOT are working with the utilities, partner agencies and other stakeholders to prioritize which utilities can be relocated first to help expedite the construction schedule for the Gordie Howe International Bridge project. Utility relocation work will occur with no anticipated service interruptions. All utility relocation work must comply with municipal guidelines and procedures for notifications, hours of work, noise and disposal of materials as outlined in the permitting documents.\n\nTree Clearing\n\nStarting March 19, 2018, MDOT contractors will be starting tree removal activities on lands already acquired for the site of the US Port of Entry. The removal of trees in this area is required for future construction to take place. An extensive tree survey for the footprint of the US Port of Entry was carried out to identify opportunities to preserve existing trees in advance of proceeding with removal.\n\nThe removal of the trees will be completed within ten weeks. Additional removal work will take place beyond May 31, 2018, on properties that are acquired after that date.\n\nCity of Detroit \u2013 Bridging Neighborhoods\n\nWDBA works closely with many partners to move the project forward, including the City of Detroit and the City of Windsor as the host communities. The City of Detroit has launched the \u201cBridging Neighborhoods\u201d program, an optional home swap or renovation program for residents living near the site of the Gordie Howe International Bridge US Port of Entry. WDBA applauds the City of Detroit for investing in the Delray community to address the unique concerns of this neighbourhood. For information on Bridging Neighborhoods, please visit",
