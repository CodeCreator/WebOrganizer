        "text":"Columbia School Board to discuss proposed Mill Creek area boundary change\n\nSunday, November 10, 2013 | 6:00 p.m. CST; updated 7:47 a.m. CST, Monday, November 11, 2013\n\n*CORRECTION: An elementary school is being built in northeast Columbia. An earlier version of this article located the school in the wrong part of town.\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2014 The Columbia School Board is expected to further discuss on Monday the temporary boundary change proposed to relieve overcrowding at Mill Creek Elementary School.\n\n\nDocuments for Monday's meeting can be accessed on\u00a0the Columbia Public Schools website.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAssistant Superintendent Peter Stiepleman is scheduled to show the board the presentation he gave Oct. 29 to the Mill Creek community about the proposed change and to share community feedback from that meeting.\n\nThe proposed boundary change, which would affect neighborhoods off of Scott and Forum boulevards for the 2014-15 school year, is intended to reduce Mill Creek's enrollment by 100 to 120 students and relieve overcrowding until a new elementary school on the southwest side of Columbia opens in 2016.The affected students would go to Russell Boulevard Elementary School or Paxton Keeley Elementary school.\n\nIt is also hoped that the proposed boundary changes would remain in effect when the new school opens.\n\nDistrict administrators are confident that they can keep the proposed boundary for Russell Boulevard Elementary School, according to a document prepared for board members.\n\nThe neighborhood moved to Paxton Keeley Elementary School under the proposed change could be made part of the new elementary school, according to the document, but \"district administrators feel those students who were moved can continue to be offered the option to stay at Paxton Keeley or go to the new school.\"\n\n*Northeast elementary school name\n\n*The committee formed to name the new elementary school in northeast\u00a0 Columbia will now also be tasked with naming the new southwest elementary school and the new early childhood care center, district spokeswoman Michelle Baumstark said.\n\n\"The board redirected the naming committee (Thursday) now that we have land for the southwest school and the early childhood care center will be on John B. Lange Middle School's property,\" Baumstark said.\n\nThe committee was approved at the board's Oct. 14 meeting and has met three times since then.\n\nBaumstark said that the committee will not make a formal presentation at Monday's meeting.\n\nNominations for school names will reopen Monday and continue to be accepted through Nov. 22.\n\nBond updates\n\nThe board is expected to discuss the April 2014 $50 million bond issue proposal. The bond issue would create a 4- or 5-cent tax increase to help pay down the debt service, Baumstark said.\n\nThe district plans to ask the community to approve four bond issues between 2014 and 2020. Each complies with the district's 10-year facility bond plan to meet enrollment growth needs and fund building projects.\n\nSome funds from the April 2014 bond issue would go toward opening a new elementary school in eastern Columbia, according to previous Missourian reporting.\n\nThe board will also be asked Monday to vote on an offer for the February 2014 sale of $50 million in general obligation bonds from April 2010 and April 2012 voter authorizations. The sale's proceeds would be used to construct a new elementary school, to make improvements and expansions at various locations around the district and to fund technology improvements, according to a document prepared for the meeting.\n\nThe board meeting is open to the public and will take place at 6:30 p.m. Monday in the Neil C. Aslin District Administration Building, 1818 W Worley St.\n\nLike what you see here? Become a member.\n\nShow Me the Errors (What's this?)\n\nReport corrections or additions here.

Summer Leadership Camp is open to FFA and FCCLA students from across Georgia.\u00a0\n\nFFA Advisors Helen Young and Amy Swindell took the group for a week of camp where they participated in a leadership program designed to build relationships, develop teamwork and leadership attributes, and have a great time. They competed in team competitions such as softball and volleyball, and they also competed in individual events such as ping pong, cornhole, tennis, speech contest, and an essay contest. There were many camp activities such as a blob, swimming, horseback riding, and nightly dances. The last day of camp is highlighted by the students running through a muddy obstacle course.\n\nThe theme of Summer Leadership Camp this year was about focus. Students were told: \u201cWhat you focus on is what becomes powerful.\u00a0 Pay attention to your thoughts because they shape your life.\u00a0 Be deliberate about who you spend time with and what you do. Shift your attention from the things that make you unhappy to things that bring you joy and success.\u201d\n\n\u201cSummer Leadership Camp is a unique experience for students that is full of memorable activities and real leadership development. One of the best aspects of camp is that some of the best teachers in the state spend a week with these students and truly invest in them to make a difference in lives,\u201d said Camp Manager Russel Towns.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe opportunities at SLC are endless. It gives all students the ability to grow their social skills, as well as great memories that will last a lifetime,\u201d Colton Peacock said.\n\nThe students from Long County High School FFA chapter attending camp included:\u00a0 Sarah Pollock, Rachael Spencer, Christina Stone, Rebecca Lust, Victoria Fentress, Hailey Surzinski, Shawn Schulte, Colton Peacock, Jacob Skaggs, Zachary Burris, Nathan Harmon, Daniel Driggers, and Nathan Trinidad.\n\nAbout FFA: Founded in 1928, the former \u201cFuture Farmers of America\u201d brought together students, teachers and agribusiness to solidify support for agricultural education. The name of the organization was changed to the National FFA Organization in 1988 to reflect the growing diversity of agriculture. Georgia FFA is the 3rd largest state association in the nation with more than 44,000 members. There are 342 FFA Chapters and more than 475 agricultural education teachers in Georgia.\u00a0\n\nThe FFA makes a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success, through agricultural education.\n\nSign up for our e-newsletters",

        "text":"Foster care youth to get their own college in West Virginia\n\nBy JOHN RABY, Associated Press\nMONTGOMERY, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 A nonprofit group announced a unique plan Wednesday to start a college in West Virginia for students who are transitioning out of foster care, giving at-risk young adults a chance to earn two-year degrees at no cost to them.\nKVC Health Systems, which specializes in behavioral health care and child welfare, will take over several buildings at the West Virginia University Institute of Technology in Montgomery. West Virginia University is moving WVU Tech\u2019s operations about 40 miles south to Beckley by this fall.\n\u201cWe want to do something different,\u201d said Tommy Bailey, a legislative lobbyist in West Virginia for Olathe, Kansas-based KVC Health Systems.\nThe plan will give educational and other opportunities to close \u201ca long-known gap in foster-care services,\u201d he said.\nColleges in many states offer various forms of financial and other assistance to students transitioning from the foster care system.\nStarting a college solely for them appears to be innovative.\n\u201cThis is the first program of its kind that I have heard of,\u201d American Association of Community Colleges spokeswoman Martha Parham said in an email Wednesday. \u201cI know there are foster youth programs at many community colleges, but have not heard of a new college being created.\u201d\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, children in foster care are at high risk of dropping out of school or do not enroll in courses that prepare them for college, where they are unlikely to attend or graduate. More than 400,000 children at any time are in foster care, and Bailey said up to 30,000 became too old for the system each year.\nFoster care benefits are terminated at age 21 in most states, including West Virginia. Because foster students typically have no support system or homes to return to during summer vacation or the holidays, those in Montgomery will live on campus full time, Bailey said.\nAnd since they\u2019ve been through the traumatic experience of going through the foster care system, not to mention what may have happened in their own families, the students will have access to behavioral specialists and mentoring programs.\n\u201cA traditional college environment isn\u2019t always the right fit for these young people,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThe support necessary is so significant that we have to think about college in a different way.\u201d\nAmong the courses being considered are in health care, computer skills, construction and carpentry, culinary arts and hospitality services, he said.\nKVC is seeking accreditation through the Higher Learning Commission. It plans to have about 200 students and a staff of about 50 involved within a year and up to 500 students once the college is fully operational.\nThe college will place a priority on enrolling students from West Virginia. All students will be required to find jobs once they\u2019re in school.\nKVC is working with numerous potential partners to soak up all of those costs, including tuition, living, food, transportation and tutoring. It also is in discussions with a YMCA chapter and a nearby technical college to figure out other ways to use the campus.\nThe nonprofit group will lease the properties in Montgomery with an option to purchase them under an agreement in principle with WVU.",

Husband Scott and wife Tricia, and children Beau, Mollie, Ellie.\n\n\"We loved the teachers, the faculty, everybody. But with all of the COVID regulations, it seemed hard for them to learn in front of a computer screen for 8 hours a day,\" Trisha Gilchrist said.\n\nMillions of students nationwide remain at home in this pandemic, learning on district laptops or tablets. Some children are now back in class and others could return soon. But at least one family won\u2019t go back. They've chosen to home-school.\n\nIt\u2019s a warm weekday morning in this tree lined neighborhood in Hurst. Seven-year-old Mollie Gilchrist is playing in her driveway with the rest of her family. She went to Bedford Heights Elementary School last year but hasn\u2019t been back since COVID-19 closed it in March. She\u2019s been learning at home ever since.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t get to see my friends that much in home school,\u201d Mollie said. \u201cBut at home school I get to go on field trips, and I\u2019ve never been on one in public school.\u201d\n\nMom Tricia Gilchrist explains.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a couple of field trips just at home,\u201d Trisha Gilchrist said, \u201cbecause we still want to be able to socialize them. Get them out.\u201d\n\nTrisha Gilchrist says once COVID-19 closed schools, she tried to untangle the Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District\u2019s plans for teaching her kids online. More recently though, she\u2019s been learning how to teach them herself, making all of North Texas a classroom.\n\n\u201cIt just being our family, we have more of an opportunity to take them on field trips,\u201d Trisha Gilchrist said.\n\n\u201cWhereas in public school they do have maybe one field trip a year and last year the field trip got cancelled anyway since they stopped going to school after spring break. They came home for spring break and were never able to go back. So she was very disappointed in having to miss her field trip last year. So here we\u2019ve gotten to do a couple to make up for that.\"\n\nTricia and husband Scott are the tag team teaching their four kids. The youngest, 18-month-old Riggins, is sleeping inside. Everyone else is outdoors under a shady tree or running around, like their 5-year-old, proud say and spell his name.\n\n\u201cBeau. B-E-A-U,\u201d said Beau.\n\nMollie, the oldest, spells her name too.\n\n\u201cEllie \u2014 and I spell my name E-L-L-I-E,\u201d she said.\n\nMom and dad both grew up here and still love the HEB ISD and their kids\u2019 school.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been actively involved, we loved the teachers, the faculty, everybody,\" said Tricia. \u201cBut this year, with all of the COVID regulations, it just seemed hard for them to learn in front of a computer screen for 8 hours a day. With our kids being as young as they are it just didn\u2019t seem the best option for our family.\u201d\n\nSo, they chose the home-school option. They\u2019d already been considering it. For one thing, the Gilchrists work out of their house. Home schooling may free up more time to travel, which they love. They\u2019re also devout Christians. The pandemic provided the perfect excuse to teach their kids the way they want.\n\n\"It definitely helped us consider this and do some hard research and thinking and thoughtful prayer through it. I\u2019d say it was a big impact on our decision,\" said Scott Gilchrist.\n\nBecause faith influences every decision they make, they\u2019ve chosen a Christian home school curriculum called The Good and the Beautiful. Tricia says it makes teaching easy.\n\n\"The curriculum tells you exactly what to say, when to say it, it provides activities to do,\u201d says Tricia. \u201cThe schooling part is great. It\u2018s trying to figure out our new rhythm which has been more difficult.\"\n\nThey both figure that\u2019ll come with time. After all, says Scott, they\u2019re still new students learning these home-schooling lessons.\n\n\"But we\u2019re on week four. It\u2019s hard to assess anything when you\u2019re only four weeks in. But we\u2019re having a blast,\u201d Scott said.\n\nIf that changes, they can always re-enroll in the district. The pandemic was a key reason for home schooling in the first place, but an approved vaccine would not be enough to send them back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re huge researchers,\u201d Tricia said. \u201cSo we research a lot, and we\u2019ve always consulted our doctors and pediatricians and all about everything we do but we don\u2019t just believe everything they say. We look into all angles. I can confidently say we would not get the COVID-19 vaccine.\"\n\nGilchrist is also confidant that a recent field trip to the aquarium was good for her daughter Mollie.\n\na child, from the back showing off her t-shirt showing a drawing of a sloth waving a banner that says Don't Hurry\nBill Zeeble\nMollie Gilchrist shows off her sloth t-shirt from her field trip to the Dallas Aquarium\n\n\"I saw a sloth and learned that they don\u2019t scream. It slept most of the whole time,\" Mollie said.\n\nThe Gilchrists aren't screaming either, even though they\u2019ve taken on home schooling for the first time in their lives.\n\nGot a tip?
