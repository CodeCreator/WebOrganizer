        "text":"Boston-Area Colleges Start Sending Admission Letters\n\nBOSTON \u2014 Letters of admission from area colleges are starting to hit mailboxes. Wellesley College\u2019s go out Tuesday. Later this week it\u2019s Williams and Amherst College and the Ivy Leagues.\n\nBoston College sent its acceptance letters out last Friday the old-fashioned way.\n\n\u201cPaper version, as opposed to the electronic,\u201d said John Mahoney, director of undergraduate admissions at BC. \u201cWe think it\u2019s good for students to hear directly from us, and to be able to see the piece of paper, especially those admitted. We also think that if a student is going to be turned down, sometimes that electronic route can be kind of cold and harsh.\u201d\n\nThis year, BC turned down the same percentage of applicants it turned down last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve admitted 34 percent of our applicants this year,\u201d Mahoney said.\n\nBoston University sent out its acceptance letters Saturday, and like BC, it offered spots to 34 percent of applicants. That\u2019s a smaller percentage than the 37 percent BU accepted last year.\n\n\u201cWe had 54,161 applications for admission for an incoming class of 3,700,\u201d said Kelly Walter, BU\u2019s executive director of admissions.\n\nLast year, BU welcomed 3,800 new students. The university says it\u2019s reducing the size of its freshman class over several years.\n\nApplications are up at many universities, including Brandeis, where the number of applicants rose by 6 percent.\n\n\u201cBrandeis is going to admit a lower percentage of our applicants this year, which is a combination of seeing a significant increase in our applicant pool and also continuing to see more students continuing to declare early their intent to enroll at Brandeis,\u201d said Andrew Flagel, the senior vice president for students and enrollment there.\n\nOther universities and colleges are also seeing an increase in students who commit early. At Amherst College, some of the students who committed early are low-income students. Overall, applications are up 7 percent this year at Amherst.\n\n\u201cWe will be a tad more selective,\u201d said Tom Parker, Amherst\u2019s dean of admissions. \u201cWe accepted slightly fewer people in April, partially because we did so well with QuestBridge in the fall.\u201d\n\nQuestBridge is a national program that finds low-income students and persuades them to apply to 35 of the nation\u2019s most selective colleges, where many receive full scholarships.\n\nTufts University is sending out acceptance letters next Monday. It\u2019s also expecting to admit a smaller percentage of applicants to its freshman class than it did last year: 17 percent compared to 18.1 percent in 2013.\n\nBoston College saw 5 percent fewer applicants from last year.\n\nWilliams College also saw a drop.\u00a0Dick Nesbitt, Williams\u2019 dean of admissions, says he\u2019s not sure why applications were down by 8 percent, but one reason might be demographics.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t as many 18-year-olds in New England states,\u201d Nesbitt said.\n\nBut Nesbitt says the incoming class will have better academic credentials than last year, including higher SAT scores.\n\nSome universities are receiving more international applications. John Mahoney said they were up by 2 percent at BC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge influx of applicants from China,\u201d Manhoney said. \u201cThe increase there is about 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAt BU, international applications overall surged by 18 percent this year. But BU is not increasing its ratio of foreign students. They\u2019ll continue to make up about 20 percent of the student body.\n\nAt MIT, too, the number of international applicants has surged. When it sent out its letters of acceptance on Pi Day, March 14, the university accepted fewer than 3 percent of international applicants. That\u2019s even fewer than the record-low overall who received letters of acceptance: just 7.7 percent of students who applied to MIT this year got in.\n\nFor most universities, students who have been accepted have until May 1 to send their deposits.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report incorrectly identified Andrew Flagel as Brandeis\u2019 dean of admissions; he is a senior vice president for students and enrollment.\n\nPlease follow our community rules when engaging in comment discussion on wbur.org.\nMost Popular",

        "text":"Call Center training forging ahead, despite one pull out\n\nJanuary 2012 is the target date\n\nThe Call Center Training Facility project is moving forward with January next year the target to start training for this project, which is overseen by the Department of Human Resources, to train some 1,500 residents in the call center industry, according to acting chief procurement officer Ivy Taufa\u2019asau.\n\nIn her final decision in September, Taufa\u2019asau awarded the contract for the $1.5 million project to share between California-based American Pacific Resources Inc. (APR) and Honolulu-based\u00a0 American Samoa Services Associates Corporation (ASSAC) \u2014 for both companies to work collaboratively to carry out this project.\n\nHowever, ASSAC last month informed DHR director Evelyn Vaitautolu Langford that the company was pulling out of the project and all its plans for operating in the territory due mainly to ASSAC\u2019s request for a waiver for a 50\/50 match in funds, which they say Gov. Togiola Tulafono declined to do. (See Monday\u2019s edition for more details)\n\nResponding to media questions, Taufa\u2019asau says the project \u201cis still ongoing\u201d and final details of the project are being ironed out with APR with the contract \u201cbeing processed for their final review and signature.\u201d She said January of 2012 is the anticipated time frame for the project to be launched.\n\nLangford said two weeks ago that DHR anticipates the initial training sessions for this project at the beginning of January 2012 and she was confident in getting the training facility moving forward.\n\nE-mail questions sent to APR official Michael McDonald in September as well as this week remain unanswered. A telephone call Wednesday to McDonald\u2019s cell phone was unsuccessful.\n\nAccording to the request for proposal, the training facility should be located on Tutuila; be operational within 75 days of the award of the contract; operate for a minimum of eighteen months; provide Call Center training for a minimum of 1,500 people with a priority given to qualified American Samoa National Emergency Grant participants; and show evidence of being able to place its graduates in full-time jobs in the Call Center industry in American Samoa.\n\n\nSamoa News understands APR is owned by Sen. Alo Stevenson\u2019s daughter, Paula, and her husband Michael McDonald. Unanswered questions to the APR officials include an inquiry as to whether APR is also required to put up a 50\/50 match in funds \u2014\u00a0which in this case, since ASSAC has pulled out, would be for the full cost of the project.\n\n\nComment Here",

        "text":"Steven Rosenstone (Courtesy photo)\nSteven Rosenstone (Courtesy photo)\n\nThe Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system has hired a consultant to help it launch a far-reaching overhaul.\n\nThe $2 million contract with McKinsey & Co., though, comes as a surprise to students and faculty involved with Charting the Future, MnSCU\u2019s bid to spur innovation and collaboration among its 31 campuses.\n\nChancellor Steven Rosenstone did not bring up the arrangement with New York-based McKinsey when students asked about the plan\u2019s costs or when he updated the board of trustees about the initiative.\n\n\u201cThat seems like a detail that should have been made known to all stakeholders in this process,\u201d said Kari Cooper, who leads MnSCU\u2019s university student association.\n\nRosenstone said McKinsey brought invaluable know-how to a long-overdue, high-stakes push for change \u2014 one he said he believes will pay off in major savings for students and the state.\n\nHe said MnSCU honored the company\u2019s preference to stay away from the spotlight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished a lot in a few short months,\u201d Rosenstone said. \u201cWe were able to do that because we got some help.\u201d\n\nBut leaders on the state Legislature\u2019s education committees say the McKinsey contract poses questions: Did the system get the best deal, given a relatively narrow window companies had to pitch their services? Is MnSCU\u2019s spending threshold before requiring board approval of vendor contracts too high?\n\nMnSCU policy calls for board approval only for vendor contracts of $3 million or more. At the University of Minnesota, with almost twice the operating budget, the cutoff is $1 million.\n\nMnSCU is already under scrutiny over last October\u2019s quiet approval of a new contract for Rosenstone; even some trustees did not learn of it until eight months later.\n\nRep. Gene Pelowski, DFL-Winona, the head of the House higher education committee, and Sen. Terri Bonoff, DFL-Minnetonka, his counterpart in the Senate, said they will push for changes to increase transparency and board oversight at MnSCU.\n\n\nDeveloped with input from students, faculty and administrators, Charting the Future spells out broad goals in areas ranging from student access to coordination among campuses. Eight implementation teams will propose specific ways of accomplishing these goals.\n\nRosenstone has stressed MnSCU \u2014 with more than 430,000 students, the fifth-largest such system nationally \u2014 sorely needs change to adapt to a changing higher education scene. He has pledged that students, faculty and other campus players on the implementation teams will drive the process.\n\nMnSCU solicited proposals from consultants specializing in managing change in December, roughly a month before the Board of Trustees green-lighted Charting the Future. Two companies submitted pitches during a Dec. 23 to Jan. 7 application window.\n\nWhile trustees did not vote on the McKinsey contract, Rosenstone said he consulted with the board\u2019s then-Chair Clarence Hightower.\n\nSince March, McKinsey compiled extensive research, provided training for administrators and prepared timelines for the eight implementation teams. It offered guidance in setting priorities for the initiative and helped craft a \u201cchange story\u201d to communicate about the work.\n\n\u201cThey brought a discipline to the process; they brought a wealth of experience,\u201d said Rosenstone.\n\nMeanwhile, four of the implementation teams and a steering committee that will oversee their work started meeting. Reviews are largely positive.\n\n\u201cStudents have experienced a welcoming environment and a sense that student input is a top priority,\u201d said Kayley Schoonmaker, chair of MnSCU\u2019s college student association, who is especially excited about plans to streamline the transfer of credits among member institutions.\n\nCooper, of the university student association, concurs. An engagement team will visit all 31 campuses next school year to get student input on the first batch of ideas.\n\nConnie Gores, president of Southwest Minnesota State University, said her team on Student Success has discussed how to best define success, how to measure it and how MnSCU might emulate successful practices nationally. She found the McKinsey training she attended extremely helpful.\n\nEven MnSCU\u2019s university faculty union, which has voiced concerns about Charting the Future, says early reports are reassuring.\n\n\u201cFaculty are reporting they are encouraged to participate and have a chance to express their ideas,\u201d said Jim Grabowska, who took over the union in July.\n\n\nBut student and faculty leaders, who sit on the steering committee, said they don\u2019t understand why they never learned of McKinsey\u2019s role or took part in its training.\n\nCooper says association members asked Rosenstone about expenses Charting the Future is incurring during an April meeting. Rosenstone brought up staff time and stipends for students and faculty on the implementation teams.\n\n\u201cNo mention of McKinsey was brought up when we point-blank asked,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nRosenstone said MnSCU did not publicize the McKinsey contract because the company prefers to \u201cwork in the background.\u201d He also said student leaders did not explicitly ask if the system had engaged an outside consultant.\n\nMnSCU says it is important to consider the potential savings for students and the state if Charting the Future succeeds. For instance, if only 10 percent of MnSCU students graduate faster, the system estimates $14 million in annual savings to its graduates and their families.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the decision to spend $2 million is a lot of money, and we made it very carefully,\u201d Rosenstone said.\n\nMcKinsey completed their work in June. A spokeswoman for the company said it does not comment on specific projects but pointed to its experience with higher education institutions.\n\nMnSCU Board Chair Thomas Renier did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis spring, MnSCU also hired Minneapolis-based PadillaCRT to help the system improve its brand and communicate better about its academic offerings. MnSCU will pay up to $185,700 for services and $83,950 for expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, Bonoff and Pelowski said they are working on legislation that would require the MnSCU Board of Trustees to publicly approve future chancellor contracts.\n\nA critic of overhead at MnSCU and the U, Pelowski questions the lack of public airing of the McKinsey contract and the need for such a sizable investment: \u201cDo you not have enough administrators that you have to hire somebody for $2 million to figure out how to chart your future?\u201d\n\nBonoff says she sees the value of enlisting outside expertise. She is a vocal supporter of Rosenstone\u2019s push for change. But she says the McKinsey contract lays bare \u201cgaps in our law in terms of oversight and transparency.\u201d\n\nShe would like to see board approval, a heads-up to the Legislature and a consultation with the state Department of Administration for contracts larger than $1 million.\n\n\u201cWith a $2 million contract, if I were in the chancellor\u2019s shoes,\u201d Bonoff said, \u201cI would want the board to be by my side.\u201d\n\nMila Koumpilova can be reached at 651-228-2171.

        "text":"Enrollment has dropped in Olympia schools\n\n\nAs the Olympia School Board looks towards the next school year, Assistant Superintendent Jennifer Priddy reported at the board meeting yesterday that local schools have experienced low enrollments.\n\nSome elementary schools reported that their enrollments dropped by as much as 15.6 percent -- at McKenny. Madison declined by 14.7 percent, Pioneer with 13.2, Olympia Regional Learning Academy Montessori (ORLA M) with 13.2 percent, and Garfield with 12.6 percent.\n\nOther schools, including Boston Harbor, Centennial, Lincoln, L.P Brown, and Hansen's enrollments dropped by less than 10 percent. Among all the elementary schools, only Roosevelt saw an increase in enrollment:by 0.5 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Jefferson High School saw a 4.4 percent increase in its enrollment, , while ORLA Middle School Academy is up by 15 percent.\n\nThe school board has yet to determine the reasons behind declining enrollments.\n\nSchool district budgets are based on the number of students enrolled. If there are fewer students, there will be less money overall.\n\nFor the upcoming school year, the school board prioritizes additional math and literacy support for elementary students as well as providing additional classrooms and staffing, if budgets will enable. In addition, the board focuses on giving academic support for middle school and high school students through enhanced after-school tutoring.\n\nFor its re-opening program, the OSB gave out its plan for its major investments. These investments include nursing support, transportation for after-school academic tutoring, online tutoring, and bilingual parent support.\n\nThe OSB also plans to allocate more teachers to high-poverty schools such as Garfield, LP Brown, and Hansen. Priddy believed that having more teacher time can have a positive impact on student\u2019s learning. Thus, the school board shared their plan to allocate more resources to hire teachers.\n\nThe additional staff also includes physical education, arts and music teachers. Aside from staffing concerns, Priddy also shared that schools struggle to provide adequate space as a result of social distancing guidelines. She suggested that schools can utilize their libraries on rotation as an alternative as temporary classrooms.\n\nOverall, the board members said they want to provide more extracurricular activities and well-being support to help students recover and heal from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\nNo comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here\nPlease log in or register to add your comment",

We remained committed to that for the entire community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe district has so many talented people that are dedicated to not only ensuring that our kids are safe, but that they have good outcomes in their care plans. We know these are really tough times, very emotional times, for parents, and we want them to know that we take our service to them very personally and that we are here for them.\u201d\n\nIn early May, the district transformed its Caring Steps Children\u2019s Center \u2014 which temporarily shut down in March due to COVID-19 \u2014 into a disaster relief child care facility for essential workers, both in and out of the district.\n\nCaring Steps Supervisor Brittany Kunzelman said the center was able to quickly pivot from its traditional program \u2014 available for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years \u2014 and offer child care all the way up to school-age care for families of essential workers by partnering with the district\u2019s School Age Care program and its caregivers.\n\n\u201cThere were a significant amount of people interested in joining for care,\u201d Kunzelman said. \u201cWe really worked collaboratively to build this program, which was extremely successful. It was amazing to see the children having fun and being able to step out of the chaos of the world we live in and have a normal routine.\u201d\n\nCaring Steps resumed its regular programming June 17, albeit with a number of new health and safety procedures \u2014 including daily health screenings and temperature checks for children and staff, restricting visitors from entering the building to minimize traffic and exposure, and the addition of intense cleaning protocols, to name a few.\n\n\u201cWe get calls, probably daily, and add to our waitlist, because a lot of other programs unfortunately didn\u2019t survive the pandemic or they are having full-time enrollment only. We are still able to offer our part-time schedule \u2014 so anywhere from two days a week, all the way up to five days a week, from birth through 5 years old. We\u2019ve been able to offer a lot of flexibility,\u201d Kunzelman said.\n\nAt press time, Kunzelman said, there were still some spaces available for fall child care at Caring Steps.\n\nAlthough Caring Steps was able to continue offering a school-age program through Aug. 14, School Age Care Supervisor Michael Cardimen said plans had yet to be finalized for the school-year School Age Care program \u2014 which traditionally offers child care for school-age children before and after school at 17 buildings throughout the district.\n\nAt press time, enrollment for the district\u2019s 2020-21 School Age Care program was temporarily closed while the district assessed community need for child care during remote instruction in September.\n\n\u201cWe are, right now, working day and night to figure out the best possible solution for the month of September,\u201d Cardimen explained. \u201cWe are planning on opening up our 17 centers starting Oct.1 \u2014 provided we go back to in-seat learning. In the meantime, we recognize the community\u2019s need for child care during the month of September, so, right now, we\u2019re putting a lot of important minds together to figure out what the best solution is going to be.\u201d\n\nDistrict officials said information regarding the School Age Care program will be emailed to families in the coming weeks.\n\nIn the Avondale Schools district \u2014 which is offering remote learning for students through at least Nov. 6 \u2014 parents can take advantage of the district\u2019s Early Learning Center, for those in preschool and pre-kindergarten, and the new Busy Bee Fall Remote Learning Camp program, which provides child care to those ages 4-12 from 7 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays-Fridays at the Avondale Meadows Learning Center.\n\n\u201cA lot of our parents are either in single-parent homes or dual working parents in the same home. Some people don\u2019t have a whole lot of resources \u2014 they might not have families that can watch their students during the day or help them with their school work during the day, so this was our answer,\u201d said district spokesperson Annette McAvoy. \u201cParents have enough to worry about. We don\u2019t want to add to their plate.\u201d\n\nSchool-age students will be cared for while also having access to technology devices and quiet spaces to participate in their Avondale School District Remote Learning.\n\n\u201cThe staff, which is not teaching staff, will help the students get online and make sure they are staying focused and on-task,\u201d McAvoy said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not helpful to the families and it\u2019s not helpful to the kids to be at home with no support. They need us.\u201d\n\nThe Busy Bee Fall Remote Learning Camp \u2014 which costs $125 for the first child and $50 for each additional child per week, not including a $75 registration fee \u2014 was full at press time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already filled up,\u201d McAvoy said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out how to expand it somehow, but we\u2019re limited because of social distancing. They\u2019ll be in a building that normally accommodates 700 kids and there will be around 75 kids.\u201d\n\nThose interested in signing up for the winter Busy Bee program \u2014 which will be offered when the district returns to in-person learning \u2014 can request a form starting Oct. 1. For more information, contact Avondale Schools Early Childhood Center Director Tiffany Mellado at (248) 537-6049 or Busy Bee Coordinator Peggy McConnell at (248) 285-2336.\n\nChild care centers, programs adapt to meet need during pandemic\nThe Goddard School in Rochester Hills is welcoming students in kindergarten-second grade this fall with a new School Age Virtual Learning Support Program.\n\nSandeep Chada, who owns The Goddard School in Rochester Hills, said the child care facility typically caters to infants through pre-kindergarteners but made some adjustments this year to add classes for those in kindergarten-second grade.\n\n\u201cThis school year is going to be a little different because we have a demand for K-2, so we\u2019re adding one or two classes for those children. We\u2019ve already had quite a few families that have already registered,\u201d he said.\n\nChada said Goddard will act as a \u201cvirtual support\u201d for students in the K-2 classrooms, who will log on remotely to the learning programs offered by their home school districts while at the center. He said there will be between 10 and 15 students per class, with one or two teachers, depending on size.\n\n\u201cThey will have their regular classes from their home teachers, and we will have a teacher at our school that would do some support activities, help them get online and engage them in outdoor activities after they\u2019re done with their curriculum,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Goddard School, he said, has also made a lot of changes to its protocols in response to COVID-19 \u2014 including adding temperature screenings for staff and students, restricting visitors from entering the building to mitigate germs, enhancing its cleaning procedures and adding UV-Aire purifiers that Chada said neutralize airborne viruses, mold and bacteria as they circulate through the ductwork.\n\nFor more information about The Goddard School in Rochester Hills, visit www.goddardschool.com or call (248) 218-0709.\n\nThe Boys & Girls Club of Troy is offering a new School Day Program open to youth ages 6-18 from all districts in the region starting Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cTypically, we\u2019re open after school and holidays (during the school year), but given that many of the districts are doing remote learning, we\u2019re going to open up a full day,\u201d Boys & Girls Club of Troy Director Jim Evans said. \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty decent demand \u2026 people are scrambling to find child care, or just plain help with schoolwork.\u201d\n\nDue to social distancing, Evans said, the club is only allowed to enroll around 100 students in the program \u2014 which runs 7 a.m.-4 p.m., with afternoon extended hours 4-6 p.m. for an additional cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably at about 40% capacity so far,\u201d Evans said. \u201cAlthough it says Troy in our name, we take kids from 40 different communities, so we\u2019re really a regional center. We have kids coming from all over the place, because a lot of people work in Troy.\u201d\n\nStaff members will be present each day to assist with online learning provided by each student\u2019s home district. Although Wi-Fi is provided by the club, each child is expected to bring their own technology for virtual learning.\n\n\u201cTwo of our employees are newly certified teachers, so we\u2019re going to have them available to help the kids work through their homework and log in online for lessons with their teacher,\u201d Evans explained.\n\nStudents in the School Day Program will also have time to get active in the gym or outdoor play spaces and participate in arts and crafts.\n\nSegment one of the club\u2019s School Day Program runs four w...

        "text":"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 3\u2014 Midway through its task, the search committee seeking a successor to Harvard University's president, Derek C. Bok, has produced many names, but so far no clear favorite has emerged for what is often considered the premier academic job in America.\n\n\"It is very slow going,\" said a Harvard official familiar with the committee, which began its work in early July. The committee is scheduled to pick a candidate by March, with Mr. Bok set to retire in June after 20 years in the post.\n\nThe search process has touched off a dispute among Harvard's students; in the past two weeks, more than 1,000 of the school's 6,592 undergraduates have signed a petition complaining that students are excluded from the committee.\n\nAt most other leading private universities, including Princeton and Dartmouth, recent presidential searches have included students and faculty members. Harvard's search committee, in keeping with the school's tradition, consists only of six members of the Harvard Corporation, the university's governing body, and three members of its Board of Overseers, who are elected by the alumni. Disturbing Lessons?\n\n\"I find it very disturbing that Harvard doesn't put enough faith in its students to include them,\" said Colleen Ryan, a freshman from Danvers, Mass. \"What is Harvard trying to teach us? Complacency, obedience and apathy?\"\n\nFriday, at a rally in Harvard Yard, the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, a graduate of Harvard Law School, told some 300 students: \"You have to break that vise of authoritarian control that they have over this university. They'll be proud of you later.\"\n\nMembers of the search committee have consistently refused to discuss any aspect of their work, citing a need for secrecy. But talks with a number of prominent professors and administrators indicate that the committee, in addition to looking for a new president, is taking a broad look at Harvard and its future.\n\nOn one hand, a senior official said, the committee has already concluded that \"people are very satisfied with Harvard under Bok.\" He pointed out that Harvard's yield on admissions of freshmen -- the percentage of those accepted who actually enter -- was 73 percent, well above other top schools, which run around 60 percent. Change With Changing World\n\nOn the other hand, the committee has heard a plethora of suggestions about issues facing Harvard, the official added. These include ways to improve the quality of teaching for undergraduates, whether Harvard should become involved in trying to improve secondary education across the country, and how Harvard should internationalize itself as society becomes more global.\n\nThere are also the problems of rising costs and rising tuition rates. Each department in Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences was recently ordered to cut its budget by 6 percent.\n\nHarvard's quest for a new president has been complicated by the fact that not only is the president's job open, but so is the second-most important post, that of dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. A separate faculty committee, headed by Mr. Bok, is looking for someone to fill the dean's office by next spring, with the final decision up to the new president.\n\nThe overwhelming choice of many Harvard professors and administrators to succeed Mr. Bok as president, Henry Rosovsky, is theoretically disqualified. Mr. Rosovsky, the acting dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is a member of the presidential search committee and has formally withdrawn his name from consideration. At This Point, Speculation\n\nMoreover, Mr. Rosovsky, 63 years old, is thought to be too old, since Harvard wants a new president who can serve at least 10 years. An economist, Mr. Rosovsky earlier served as dean of the faculty for 11 years, becoming well known for developing Harvard's basic \"core curriculum\" and for turning down the presidency of Yale University.\n\nBut Mr. Rosovsky has not said he would refuse to serve if picked, and so much speculation still centers on him. \"The problem for the search committee is that it will be very hard to find someone better than Henry,\" said the president of another Ivy League university.\n\nAmong others most often mentioned as leading candidates to succeed Mr. Bok are George Rupp, the president of Rice University and a popular former dean of Harvard's Divinity School, and James O. Freedman, the president of Dartmouth College and a Harvard graduate.\n\nThose at Harvard thought to be under consideration include Jeremy R. Knowles, a professor of chemistry, Philip Leder, a professor of genetics, and Robert D. Putnam, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Asking Around for Names\n\nOthers outside Harvard who have also been mentioned include Louis W. Sullivan, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, who once taught at Harvard Medical School; Thomas Ehrlich, the president of Indiana University, who is a Harvard graduate, and Gerhard Casper, the provost of the University of Chicago.\n\nIf Harvard were to choose a woman -- which most people here doubt will happen -- the two most highly recommended candidates are Nan Keohane, the president of Wellesley College, and Adele S. Simmons, the president of the MacArthur Foundation and also a Harvard graduate.\n\nThe final choice, however, may still be someone whose name has not yet surfaced. This month, the search committee mailed 200,000 letters to all Harvard alumni, faculty and students, soliciting names and suggestions.The search committee is also interviewing 300 to 400 Harvard professors and leading educators around the country, seeking names and ideas.\n\nA senior Harvard administrator said the characteristics sought are someone in his or her 40's, with management experience, an ability to raise money and preferably a Harvard connection. Since Mr. Bok was dean of the Harvard Law School before becoming president, many believe a non-lawyer is being sought. A Vote for a Scientist\n\nVarious professors and administrators have their own favorite qualities as well. John E. Dowling, a professor of biology, said, \"I hope we have a president who is more on the academic side of things, and I would love to see a scientist.\"\n\nA professor of history, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said he felt \"the university is adrift\" because Mr. Bok had focused too much of Harvard's energy and resources on the professional schools, especially the John F. Kennedy School of Government, which Mr. Bok helped create. \"You have only to look at the Kennedy School,\" he said, \"to see what happens: you end up with a school of ambition, and much shallowness and confusion.\"\n\nHe added, \"I would like to see the next president be just a teeny weeny bit more convinced that the College and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are the center of the university.\"\n\nDavid Reisman, a professor emeritus who has just written a book on university presidential searches, denied that the lack of faculty and student participation is a liability. \"Each Harvard professor is a polar bear on his or her own ice floe, representing themselves,\" he said. And Professor Dowling said there was concern that students could jeopardize the secrecy of the process.\n\nMr. Reisman noted that although the search committee is far smaller than that at most universities it is more diverse than the white male group that chose Mr. Bok in 1970. The current search committee contains two women, including Hanna H. Gray, the president of the University of Chicago and a black, Wesley S. Williams Jr., a Washington lawyer.\n\nPhoto: Among those mentioned as leading candidates to succeed Derek C. Bok as Harvard University's president are James O.

        "text":"No schools, no community, East Millinocket residents say\n\nPosted Jan. 08, 2013, at 1:17 p.m.\nLast modified Jan. 08, 2013, at 9:35 p.m.\n\nPoll Question\n\nEAST MILLINOCKET, Maine \u2014 Save the town\u2019s schools.\n\nThat was the message the Board of Selectmen and school committee received from residents during a special meeting Monday night. Town leaders held the meeting to discuss the future of Schenck High and Opal Myrick (K-4) schools, which share the same building. Middle-schoolers attend Medway Middle School.\n\nAbout 75 people attended, including Millinocket Superintendent of Schools Kenneth Smith and Millinocket interim Town Manager Charles Pray. No one at the meeting advocated closing the school or sending local students out of town, instead preferring to explore repairing the school building, which could cost several million dollars.\n\nStory continues below advertisement.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a school for people to live here,\u201d committee Chairman Dan Byron said during the meeting. \u201cWe won\u2019t have a community if we don\u2019t have a school.\u201d\n\nThe committee will start work at its February meeting on a comprehensive five-year plan to save the schools, starting with the repair of the building\u2019s roof. That\u2019s slated to cost $1.8 million, Byron said.\n\n\u201cThe townspeople want to keep their school. They feel they don\u2019t want to see the school go to the wayside. They want to fix it up,\u201d Byron said, \u201cbut at what cost? That\u2019s the point we need to come up with.\u201d\n\nSchool leaders called the joint meeting to determine what residents wanted to do with the 56-year-old building, which needs several million dollars in repairs in addition to the roof. The meeting allowed Superintendent Quenten Clark to acquaint attendees with some of the hard math they will face if the issue goes to referendum as town leaders expect.\n\nCounting the $1.8 million and other possible repairs, town taxes could rise four to eight mills \u2014 or about $50 per mill for property worth $50,000 \u2014 if taxpayers pay the several million in total repairs the building requires, said Clark. State aid would shave about $700,000 of that cost, but state officials have said state aid is unlikely, given the fiscal crunch state government faces.\n\nIn his report to the boards, Clark said there is an additional $125,000 in new salary and technology costs he expects the board will have to pay this year or next. The $1.8 million would be paid off over 20 years at $85,000 annually, Clark said.\n\nTrends indicate the continued shrinking of regional and school populations, state school aid, and town revenues. The town\u2019s largest taxpayer, Great Northern Paper Co. LLC, will be exempt from a property tax increase by the deal its owners made when they restarted the mill, officials have said. GNP would have to agree to pay higher taxes if the town wanted it to.\n\nIf the population declines continue, Clark said, the burden on taxpayers will increase. Another unknown is whether state officials would require other costly improvements to the building to bring it up to code.\n\nResidents who spoke during the meeting said they wanted to see the cost projections. They chided school board members who said they needed residents to provide them with direction. Townspeople have repeatedly told the board that they don\u2019t want to lose their school.\n\nSome residents wondered whether proceeds from the Dolby landfill could benefit the town. Others said the board should do more to cut costs. School committee member Jennifer Murray said she feared people would be badly surprised at how heavy the cost of keeping the building open will be.\n\n\u201cI think it will be shocking,\u201d she said.\n\nRecommend this article\n\n\nSimilar Articles\n\nMore in Penobscot",

        "text":"\n\nLP, SL school officials mark options for shared services\n\nOctober 24, 2012\n\nLAKE PLACID - The Lake Placid and Saranac Lake school boards continue to look for ways to share services.\n\nA 45-minute joint meeting was held at the Lake Placid Middle-High School cafeteria Tuesday, Oct. 16. The boards reviewed the work of four committees appointed earlier this fall to explore potential areas for shared services. The presidents of both school boards said they felt the joint meetings have been productive so far.\n\n\"We're finding areas where we are sharing but we just didn't know about,\" Lake Placid school board President Mary Dietrich said. \"We're finding out that there are some good things that they're doing over at Saranac Lake that our kids could take advantage of, and there's good things that we're doing over here that their kids could take advantage of.\"\n\n\"It's a slow process,\" Saranac Lake school board President Debra Lennon said.\n\nInstructional services\n\nThe committee on instructional services held two meetings and discussed classes that could be shared at the high school level. It also looked at consolidating and sharing school calendars.\n\nLennon said sharing a schedule would be important if the districts wanted to share classes. The schools have shared class lists and enrollments to find out which courses could be combined.\n\n\"We're looking at those types of things that could broaden what students have for classes to take,\" Lennon said.\n\nLennon said Saranac Lake would need to get something like a Tandberg Unit, a video-conferencing system, so students could attend classes without traveling. Lake Placid already has one.\n\nLake Placid school board member Phil Baumbach said the committee found it would be easier and less expensive for teachers to travel back and forth between districts than for students to be bused.\n\nBaumbach said many of these possibilities will be clearer when the budget process starts.\n\nFood services\n\nLake Placid school board member Patti Gallagher said the committee had two meetings \"that seemed to be really positive.\" She said the committee found that Saranac Lake has \"huge strengths where Lake Placid has needs.\"\n\nGallagher said Dan Bower and Leonard Sauers, budget officers for the Saranac Lake and Lake Placid school districts, respectively, looked at what Ruth Pino, food service director for Saranac Lake, could do for Lake Placid.\n\n\"There are a lot of similarities about how the schools, the food service areas, are structured,\" Gallagher said. \"It seems like we will be able to move forward with that.\"\n\nGallagher noted that Lake Placid's food service consultant, Jim Bigley, will leave the district, so Pino's expertise could prove helpful.\n\nBower said Pino will need to visit Lake Placid to see if the menus being used by Saranac Lake could work in the other district.\n\nBusiness services\n\nLake Placid school board member Martha Stahl said the districts could look at shifting people around in both business offices to maximize their strengths.\n\n\"One of the things we talked about is that there's nobody in either district who had a lot of time to do things like grant writing,\" she said. \"So we thought if we looked at those organizational charts, we might see some things where we could share some services that would free up staff time to focus on other areas.\"\n\nStahl said Bower and Sauers will explore the possibility of sharing the same system for things like payroll, accounting and taxes.\n\nStahl also talked about streamlining tax collection. She said the districts could work with local banks to set up more places for people to pay their taxes in person.\n\n\"One of the things that we talked about was that when taxpayers come into the district office to pay their taxes, whoever is working gets pulled away from whatever they're doing to go and do that customer service piece,\" she said. \"Perhaps if we looked at having the banks and more options for people to pay, that could be helpful.\"\n\nStahl said the districts could also make large purchases of things like paper and other office supplies together.\n\n\"If we can't purchase them together, at least have them shipped together,\" she said. \"Saranac Lake has a warehouse, and we could store items from both districts in that warehouse.\"\n\n\nbuildings and grounds\n\nSaranac Lake school board member Terrence Tubridy said the two districts are already sharing transportation services.\n\n\"If we have kids going north on a bus for a sports, especially skiing, we take care of Lake Placid,\" he said. Tubridy said Sauers is also the effective supervisor for buildings and grounds in Lake Placid.\n\nTubridy said Saranac Lake's facilities director, Lee Daunais, will retire at the end of the school year. The district's could share the position, Tubridy said, but there would need to be a careful study of whether one person could do both jobs.\n\nLake Placid school board member John Hopkinson said both facilities departments have been hit pretty hard by budget cuts in recent years. He said demands have increased, too, because of more night, weekend and summer activities at both schools.\n\nThe school boards will come together again at 7 p.m. Nov. 1 for a presentation on opportunities for shared services by the Rochester-based Center for Governmental Research. The presentation will be held in the large group instruction room at Saranac Lake High School.\n\nThe group was hired by to do the study at no charge to the districts. Dietrich said they are looking at the size of the districts and their budgets for comparison with other school districts around the state that have shared services.\n\n\"We're all kind of unclear as to what specifics we're going to get,\" Dietrich said. \"I think they might be able to let us know if we're on the right track with what we're working on.\"\n\nThe two districts will continue to hold joint meetings. The next one is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Dec. 5 at the Petrova school library.\n\n\n\nI am looking for:\nNews, Blogs & Events Web",

The 33-year-old left the design and construction trade to get a more specialized degree, but his progress has been slowed as he, like many in California, struggle to enroll in the classes he needs.\n\nClassroom overcrowding is a thread that united the scores of Glendale Community College students and faculty who attended a music, theater and spoken word demonstration Thursday.\n\n\u201cGeneral education classes are very difficult to get into, and I wasn\u2019t able to get any classes at all this winter,\u201d Wise said. \u201cIf the students present themselves in masses, maybe the board of directors here at the college and colleges everywhere can stop Sacramento from cutting school budgets.\u201d\n\n\nThe music and cultural presentation, \u201cClass Closed,\u201d was organized by the Glendale Community College Guild, the faculty union. History professor Gordon Alexandre said approaching the state fiscal crises through culture was a way to connect with students.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a party with a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer to California\u2019s budget problem is not more cuts. We have a revenue problem, not a spending problem.\u201d\n\nA troupe of Los Angeles high school students reenacted a scene Wise and psychology major LaToya Kirkland were all too familiar with: an over-worked, financially strapped student who, for the ninth time, couldn\u2019t get a spot in English-1A.\n\n\u201cIt has to be out in the open, otherwise it\u2019ll get swept under the rug,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk about the things we don\u2019t usually talk about.\u201d\n\nAnd sociology teacher Richard Kamei has seen his classes swell to 50 students, he said.\n\n\u201cOffice hours are the best example; it\u2019s just impossible to see everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cOur workload increases\u2002.\u2002.\u2002.\u2002but it hurts the learning environment for the students.\u201d\n\n\u201cClass Closed\u201d was different from the speeches and march organized by the college\u2019s student government in March.\n\nBut that rally inspired faculty members to organize their own, said David John Attyah, an art professor.\n\n\u201cThis is intended to keep that momentum moving,\u201d he said. \u201cFaculty felt we had to get behind them.\u201d\n\nStudents laid out along the grassy slopes in the Plaza Vaquero on the cloudless and sunny day, many with signs like \u201cHoo kneeds educashun\u201d and \u201cNo more cuts.\u201d\n\nThe procession was the first of its kind, and if successful, would be replicated at community colleges elsewhere, said Marty Hittelman, president of the California Federation of Teachers, the parent union of the Glendale Community College faculty guild.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cSome will feel that spark and want to go further and organize.\u201d\n\nGet in touch MAX ZIMBERT covers education.

        "text":"\u00ab Race to the Top District Winners Announced | Main | How Should Teachers, Principals Be Evaluated? ASCD Wants to Know \u00bb\n\nEl Paso School Board Defies State Takeover\n\nThe El Paso school board is taking steps to challenge a state takeover, the El Paso Times reports. The board voted late last night to request a review of Texas Education Commissioner Michael Williams' decision to dissolve the school board and replace it with a new board of managers.\n\nWilliams, who has been commissioner since September, framed the state takeover as a signal to others in the state that cheating would not be tolerated. This school board oversaw a disturbing cheating scandal that landed former superintendent Lorenzo Garcia in jail earlier this year.\n\nHere's the El Paso Times on the board's latest action:\n\nBoard members on Wednesday said they will protect the will of the voters and challenge Texas Commissioner of Education Michael Williams' decision to appoint a board of managers and a conservator to oversee the district of 64,000 students that has been plagued by a cheating scandal.\nThey called his decision \"political gamesmanship\" and accused him of being swayed by a few of El Paso's elite and the El Paso Times.\n\nAbout 12:15 a.m. Wednesday, the school board unanimously voted to request that the TEA review Williams' appointments of a conservator and a board of managers to run the district for up to two years, pending approval of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe board also decided to submit an appeal to the federal Justice Department in response to the state agency's request for preclearance of the board of managers. The federal Voting Rights Act requires the state to receive Justice Department approval for replacing an elected board.\n\nThe two reviews by the TEA must be done within 30 calendar days after it receives the district's request. The agency must have the request by Sunday.\n\nThe El Paso board members are framing this as a move to disenfranchise local voters: \"The voters are best suited to decide who should take charge of the district, not the political appointee who is unaccountable to the voters,\" said one of the board's members.\n\nThe El Paso Times takes pains to point out that many of the school board's current members have only a tenuous claim to representing the voters' will. \"Only two of the seven trustees\u2014Alfredo Borrego and Russell Wiggs\u2014were elected by a majority of their constituents in their most recent election,\" and the two received fewer than 1,000 votes combined, the paper reports.\n\nAn internal audit revealed the cheating scandal had been kept secret until the El Paso Times obtained the documents in April, and the school board also allowed former superintendent Garcia, who was complicit in the cheating, to oversee that audit.\n\nWe reported last month on another defiant school board when the Detroit school board voted to withdraw from a state-run authority there. State-run authorities can be a touchy subject: Thomas Pedroni, a professor of curriculum studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, said voters there felt \"under siege\" from various threats of state takeovers.\n\nThe scale of the cheating scandal in El Paso makes this situation a bit unique. But, as many states have attempted to create separate districts or authorities to run low-performing schools, the question of whether state-appointed officials are as responsive to the public as elected board members may come up more frequently.\n\nWant to keep up with school district and leadership news?

        "text":"Independent schools offer stability at a time of upheaval in state education.\n\nPUBLISHED: 00:00 27 April 2016\n\nDr David Moses\n\nDr David Moses\n\nnot Archant\n\nThe start of the new school year in September heralds a new chapter in the history of one of the country\u2019s leading Catholic independent preparatory schools.\n\nAmpleforth Abbey and College has appointed Dr David Moses as the new head of St Martin\u2019s Ampleforth, the college\u2019s preparatory school at Gilling Castle north of York on the edge of the Howardian Hills.\n\nHe replaces Mark O\u2019Donnell who leaves in July. Dr Moses has taught English at Ampleforth College since 2005 and has been housemaster of St John\u2019s for nearly seven years. He takes up the reins at a challenging time for the independent school sector, which according to a recent Guardian front page article is facing stronger competition from improving state schools. It noted that four out of five state schools in England were now rated as outstanding or good by Ofsted.\n\nWhile independent schools currently enjoy control over the curriculum and other freedoms, the Government\u2019s recently-announced drive to make all state schools into academies, freeing them from local authority control, will extend many of those freedoms to the state sector.\n\nDr Moses is confident that St Martin\u2019s Ampleforth, a Bendictine, Catholic co-educational day and boarding school, is well placed to meet the challenge and one he is looking forward to taking on. He said: \u2018It is really exciting. You have a shelf-life as a housemaster and although I am not quite there yet, this post came along and I was very keen to cross the valley to St Martin\u2019s and take on what is quite a big challenge. I was a pupil at a state school and I also attended Giggleswick School so I have experienced both systems.\u2019\n\nHe believes independent prep schools offer stability and that they can look forward to the future with confidence. He said: \u2018St Martin\u2019s and other prep schools offer great stability and they don\u2019t always get the recognition they deserve. If all you provided was exactly the same as the state sector there would be no point in parents paying to send their children to independent schools.\n\n\u2018The independent sector delivers academic excellence and much more. At St Martin\u2019s we have a strong curriculum and it\u2019s not just confined to the classroom. We are strong in areas such as sports, drama and music and, given our longer school day, more time can be devoted to these areas.\n\nDr Moses says the Benedictine philosophy \u2013 \u2018the backbone of our studies\u2019 \u2013 is one of St Martin\u2019s great strengths. His own educational philosophy is very much centred on the needs of each individual pupil. He said: \u2018It is about taking an approach that is tailored to each individual. You draw out what each student is good at help them achieve their potential.\u2019\n\nHe acknowledges St Martin\u2019s enviable location and added: \u2018I am in love with the building. For 22 generations there has been a family in Gilling Castle and I am going to be resident there. It is important that there is a family atmosphere in the castle. This is something I have worked on in St John\u2019s. Lots of communication with students and parents is also important.\u2019 The majority of the 150 children attending St Martin\u2019s are day pupils and Dr Moses says he would like to increase the number of boarders.\n\nGilling Castle is a Grade I listed building on the 2,000-acre Ampleforth Abbey estate. Ampleforth was established in 1802 when the monks returned to England following a 200-year exile in France after the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII. The famous abbey orchard now has about 2,000 trees and more than 40 varieties of apples, some of which are used to make the famous Ampleforth Abbey Cider and Cider Brandy.\n\nAmpleforth Abbey visitor centre welcomed its 50,000th visitor in August 2015 and the Benedictine monastery at Ampleforth is a centre for spirituality, education, pastoral work and evangelisation.\n\nMost Read\n\nMost Read\n\nLatest from the Yorkshire Life",
