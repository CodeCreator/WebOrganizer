He was fully ordained in 1941, and is the 48th patriarch of the Linchi (Rinzai) Ch'an school. In 1949, amid the turbulence of civil war, he went to Taiwan.\u00a0\n\nIn Taiwan, he began fulfilling his long-held vow of promoting Humanistic Buddhism, which takes to heart spiritual practice in daily life. With an emphasis on not needing to \"go some place else\" to find enlightenment, we can realize our true nature in the here and now, within this precious human birth and this world. When we actualize altruism, joyfulness, and universality, we are practicing the fundamental concepts of Humanistic Buddhism. When we give faith, hope, joy, and service, we are helping all beings, as well as ourselves. For nearly a half century, Venerable Master Hsing Yun has devoted his efforts to transforming this world through the practice of Humanistic Buddhism.\u00a0\n\nHe is the founder of the Fo Guang Shan International Buddhist Order, which is headquartered in Taiwan and supports temples worldwide. The Order emphasizes education and service and maintains public universities, Buddhist colleges, libraries, publishing houses, Buddhist art galleries and tearooms, free mobile medical clinics, children's home, retirement home, high school, and television station. The Order's lay service organization, Buddha's Light International Association, also has active chapters worldwide.\u00a0\n\nVenerable Master Hsing Yun is an outspoken proponent of equality among all people and religious traditions. The Order has the largest number of female monastics of any Buddhist order today. By providing and supporting educational and leadership opportunities, he has worked to improve the status of women in Taiwan. He has held full ordination ceremonies for women of the Mahayana, Theravada, and Vajrayana traditions. In addition, Master Hsing Yun annually organizes conferences to bring together the various Buddhist schools and to promote dialogue between Buddhists and other major religious groups.\u00a0\n\nMaster Hsing Yun is a prolific writer and has authored over one hundred books in Chinese. His writings have been translated into English and many other languages. His works of the Life of Sakyamuni Buddha and the sixteen-volume Fo Guang Buddhist Dictionary have both won Taiwan's highest humanitarian awards. His biography Handing Down the Light, Hsing Yun's Ch'an Talks, The Lion's Roar, The Hundred Sayings Series, and The Humanistic Buddhism Series are published in Taiwan and are in English. Being Good: A Guide to Buddhist Ethics, Only a Great Rain, Lotus in a Stream, Where is Your Buddha Nature: Stories to Instruct and Inspire are published by American publishers and are in English. His numerous lectures also continue to be translated into English.\u00a0\n\nBased in Taiwan, Venerable Master Hsing Yun travels extensively. His insightful, engaging, and witty lectures unfailingly endear him to audiences. He reminds us that to transform our world, we must be actively engaged in it. \"Community transcends the individual,\" he says, \"and in doing so, fulfills the individual in the most complete way possible.\" Wherever he goes, he encourages people to unite both the local and global community into a world of complete equality, joyfulness, and perfect peace.",

EVER?! \u00a0EVER?!?!?!...... \u00a0EVER?!?!\n\nIf you stopped trying to fix what you have decided is wrong about you- and headed instead of the direction of what's right about you that you are not getting- would that change your life?\u00a0\n\n\n\nHave you seen the movie The Matrix? Do you remember the part where Neo meets Morpheus for the first time and he offers him the blue pill(to go back to the life he knew) or the red pill ( that would blow all his beliefs and paradigms of what he was capable of and whats possible?)...well Access is the red pill for me...and I'm stoked I took it!!\n\nHave you always known there HAS to be more to life?\u00a0\n\nFor MANY many years I wrestled with feeling I was not good enough- that there was something inherently wrong with me- no matter how much I gave, how much I did or the success I had- I judged ceaselessly that I was not enough. \u00a0With this point of view about me so engrained, I created abusive friendships and relationships, where I swung between giving myself up for them and then fighting to have me . (Not my brightest choice!). \u00a0\n\nMy true nature is that I am a possibilitarian- a seeker who does not give up - despite my crappy choices!\n\nI KNEW there had to be more to life than what I was currently having.\u00a0\n\nSo I learnt and became involved with a vast array of natural therapies for over 20 years and searched and experimented with many modalities and philosophies, in the vain hope they would \"fix me\". NONE of them did!!\n\nI energetically invited Access Consciousness into my life, after yelling at the Universe one depserate night .....\n\nI discovered the Bars and received a session .... EVERYTHING changed...\n\nI then attended A Bars class and two days later I woke up with a voice in my head saying \" You are going to become an Access Facilitator and take this to the World\". I had never been so certain about anything in my entire life.\n\nNOTHING comes close to the ease, lightness and fun that I experience with using the Access tools.\u00a0\n\nI apply the Access tools to all that I already do in my clinic and have been stunned by the rapidity and immediate change this allows for my clients and it is truly empowering them to choose for themselves.Their knowing and other hidden talents surface, they are happier and at ease with who they are. Instead of constantly looking at the wrongness of themselves, they now ask \"whats right about me that I'm not getting?\". The magic starts to show up the more they ask the question...\n\n\u00a0Now I travel the world facilitating a plethora of classes- Money Isn't The Problem You Are, Salon Des Femmes, Talk To The Animals, Prosperity Consciousness, Being You Adventures and the Core Classes of Access- Bars and Foundation along with my insatiable desire to share the tools, scatter seeds of possibilities and empower people to know that they know.\n\nWhat would it be like if you got paid to do what you love?\u00a0\n\nHow does it get any better than this?\n\nJust sayin'!\n\n\n{{showBio2?\"\u95b1\u8b80\u66f4\u5c11\":\"Read More\"}} \u67e5\u770b\u6240\u6709\u5373\u5c07\u4e0a\u7dda\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\n\n\n\u65e5\u671f \u6d3b\u52d5 \u5c0e\u5e2b \u4e3b\u6301\u4eba \u5730\u9ede \u65b9\u5f0f\n{{occurrence.StartDate}} - {{occurrence.EndDate}} {{occurrence.ClassTitle}} {{occurrence.Facilitator}}\n{{occurrence.City}}, {{occurrence.State}}, {{occurrence.Country}}\n\n\nGlobal Foundation - Live stream from Brisbane. Would you like to join us in Sao Paulo, Brazil - via online? You won't need your passport or have to deal with airports! We will be joining Gary Douglas and Dain Heer live time from Brazil (from the comfort of our home) as they re-write and shake up more possibilities to change anything and everything you desire to change! Q.What time does that make it in Brisbane then? A.The class will begin at 9.30 pm in Brisbane and go to approx midnight. They generally have a 2ish hour lunch, so class will begin around 2- 2.30 am and go til approx 5 am. We will have massage tables, bean bags and have a cozy space to receive the class from. There are plenty of accommodation options close by - would it be a kindness to you and your body to have somewhere to relax outside of class if you don't live locally? Please send me an email or call 0418 456 498\n\n\u201cAre you willing to acknowledge the Greatness of you today?\u201d\n\n- Chutisa Bowman",

        "text":"who I am\n\nWho I am!\n\nHoungan Hector with Gede Ceremonial Dress\nBlessings to everyone!I hope that all is well, and that I find you in peace, health, harmony, love, and luck.My name is Houngan Hector, and I am an Asogwe priest of Haitian Vodou. I lead Sosyete Gade Nou Leve (\u201cWatch Us Rise Society\u201d) which is based in New Jersey, and has members around the world. But let\u2019s start at the beginning of my story . . . .Both sides of my family have always served the Spirits. On both my mother\u2019s and father\u2019s side, our Ancestors and Guides have been honored, recognized, and served. Traditionally, the Spirits have been passed down from an older member of the family to a younger one, when that individual was ready to start working \u201cla obra\u201d (God\u2019s work).\n\nMy story actually began before my birth. My mother was deemed to be the one to inherit my Grandmother\u2019s Guides. My mother, however, did not want to work La Obra as it had been decided for her. She fought, rebelled, and worked very hard at avoiding any sort of spiritual labor. She often remarked about how she was not cut out for that type of lifestyle, preferring to live like a \u201cnormal\u201d person.\n\nDuring my mother\u2019s pregnancy with me, my Grandmother\u2019s Guides informed my mother of their plans. Since she would not serve, the child that was in her would! I would be blessed with spiritual abilities to see and help others with their problems. The Spirits always have a way to solve problems! In my family, we often remark that the Spirits are in the blood, thus once your family serves the Spirits, your family will always serve the Spirits!\n\nI am told that at the hospital, directly after my birth, my Grandmother\u2019s Guides mounted her. They made special signs over my body to demonstrate my role as the one to inherit them. At that point, my mother made an important decision for me. My grandmother would be the one to raise me, as my mother would not know how to deal with what would be happening to me. Thus, she figured, and was right in doing so, that it would be best to have my Grandmother (whom I actually called Mom) raise me and train me. She knew what was best for me.\n\nThroughout my childhood, I lived very well with my Grandmother. I ate well, played, and was generally a quite obedient child. I grew up with a cousin who became like my brother. My childhood, at least in the beginning, was quite normal actually. Although, I can remember, even at the age of five, seeing the Spirits walking through our Home regularly.\n\nOur House was filled with love, good food, and kindness. Not only that, but our living room was often also packed with clients waiting for my Grandmother to see them. My Grandmother had taught us to live by the Three Virtues: Faith, Hope and Charity. These can be summed up as:\n\n  1. Having faith and encouraging\/helping others with their faith.\n  2. Having and encouraging Hope.\n  3. Being able to give charitably from the heart.\n\nWe often had house guests who stayed in a spare room of the house. My grandmother was often housing, clothing, and feeding those who couldn\u2019t do so for themselves.\n\n\nAt the tender age of seven, I was mounted by an ancestor. This was the official beginning of my spiritual journey. After this, my Grandmother carefully explained to me what had happened and revealed to me the events of my birth. My Grandmother encouraged and nurtured the development of my spiritual abilities.Soon after this event, my Grandmother believed it best for me to start honing and using my spiritual abilities as soon as possible. According to her, this was the best way to develop them, while they were fresh and recently manifested. To do this, she had me do readings for some of her clients. Little by little, she would give me more and more readings to do.I often complained about having to do readings and spiritual work instead of playing. She always reminded me that \u201cSpiritual work is something you will have to do for the rest of your life, playing does not contribute to any skill you will need.\u201d Although I couldn\u2019t understand then, I am very grateful now. I was often dreaming different recipes and works that my Guides would show me in order to help my clients.My family is filled with a variety of Espiritismo and other Traditions. My Grandmother worked one form and there were other various forms being practiced in my family. My Grandmother, being as wise as she was, wanted me to learn the other practices within my family. Subsequently, my Grandmother found the perfect opportunity for me to learn! I had two Aunts, twins, who both had no children. Each of them practiced a different Tradition. For summers on end, I stayed at my Aunt\u2019s homes learning from them.\n\nYou can learn more about the Traditions of my Grandmother and my Aunts here: Paths\n\nI learned much from my Aunts. One of my Aunts taught me and initiated me into Sanse \u2013 a Tradition of Puerto Rico. Due to the fact that my Aunt had no children, I also inherited her spiritual tableau.\n\nThus, trying to balance between looking after her tableau, my Grandmother\u2019s tableau, and my own has been a great spiritual task for me.\n\nMy other Aunt was also a Sancista (practitioner of Sanse) but had also begun to practice of Dominican Vodou. She was initiated and took me to her own Godmother for training and initiation. There is so much knowledge in our family that it really is staggering. After her death, one of my cousins, whom my Aunt initiated directly, went on to inherit her spiritual tableau.\n\nAs I continued to grow, I began to gain a wider following and larger clientele. I worked for clients that my Grandmother had passed to me, but also for those whom were solely mine as well. I often read for my clients using a deck of cards, a mirror, or \u2013 at times \u2013 calling upon my Lwa and Guides to possess me.\n\nI found spiritual work to be heavy and toiling. I didn\u2019t want to do it growing up. I saw it as a burden that I didn\u2019t want to bear. Maintaining an altar, resolving people\u2019s problems, consulting for them is heavy work! Though, over time, I came to understand that spiritual work was not a burden but a gift. It was\/is a mission given to me by God and the Spirits to help people. It is not something one can choose to do or not do, rather, it is something that we must do!\n\nHoungan Hector with Inherited Spirit\n\n\nMama Ezili Dantor and Houngan Hector\nAs I continued to grow, certain other Spirits, more obscure, started to show themselves in my dreams. They desired to be served, though I wasn\u2019t yet clear on who they were! I went to my Grandmother, my Aunts, and my Godmother to try to understand who these guides were. I was stubborn and resistant toward these Spirits who informed me I was their child.They would tell me what to do, what they required and wanted from me, and eventually I found myself doing what they asked of me. Their abilities truly amazed me. Little did I know that I was actually serving the Lwa of Haitian Vodou! I actually came to find this out through watching a segment on television. During the segment, the names of many of the same spirits that I was seeing in my dreams were mentioned.So, naturally, I sought out more information on this beautiful and awe inspiring tradition. I learned that the rattle covered in beads with a bell that I was dreaming of was the Asson. The symbol and tool of the Vodou priesthood. In my dreams, two certain Lwa in particular were constantly putting this in my hand.As I continued to research and learn, I knew what I was being called to do. While serving these Lwa, I had seen many miracles in the lives of myself, my family, and my clients. I knew that I was being called to undergo the kanzo ceremony, the initiation into Haitian Vodou. So, I decided that if the Spirits would give me the means, I would undergo the initiation and serve with all my heart. Give me the means they did! And I received my initiation.\n\nAfter my first initiation, I returned to Haiti to study the Vodou tradition in depth. I spent a lot of time living and learning in Haiti. I traveled the country learning from various Houngans\/Mambos Djakout and Asogwe, Bokos, and other priests of this beautiful tradition. The more I learned, the more I wanted to know. I was called to be initiated again in Port Au Prince. I did so, and retook my oaths and vows to upholding the Vodou tradition. I am a member of a Vodou family with strong and very old roots in the tradition. I continue to learn and grow within the Vodou tradition. The more you know in Vodou, the more there is to learn. No one ever knows it all.\n\nI was called to serve the Lwa again, but now in a different way. This Sosyete, Gade Nou Leve, was formed by me upon the direction of the Lwa Ginen. We are geared toward providing correct, authentic, and accurate information and initiation into the Vodou Tradition.\n\nI have worked on this website with the goal of dispelling common myths about this beautiful Religion. Also to provide individuals with a sincere calling a method to attain the initiation or services of an honest, dependable Vodou Priest with many years of experience. Allowing individuals to freely find information that is all too common in Haiti for the public, yet rarely available here in the US.\n\nI have been helping people since 1989 resolve their issues, and well over 11 years of helping people through the means of the Haitian Vodou tradition. Having gotten individuals out of jail, brought lovers back, and improved people\u2019s financial situation, I keep myself humble remembering it is not I who does it. It is God and Ginen who resolves.\n\nMay God and Ginen bless you and yours always!\n\nHoungan Hector\n\nTo keep up with me and all the newest happenings in the Sosyete or in my spiritual work, please click here for my blog",

I believe there are a lot of us, and it\u2019s my hope that this blog will help more of us extend our voices into the public sphere.\n\nIn Creative Atheist, I\u2019ll be interviewing atheist writers and artists of all kinds, reviewing their books and other work, and offering my readers advice and insights about the writing and publishing process. Your questions and topic suggestions are most welcomed.\n\nYOUR COMMENTS: I love hearing from my readers. Just be civil, as it\u2019s no fun for me to delete comment threads that turn into name-calling.\n\nABOUT ME: Back when I was an independent journalist, I wrote thousands of articles, essays, columns, and reviews for regional and national publications, including Los Angeles Times, USA Today, Psychology Today, Los Angeles, and many others. Later I zeroed in on psychological topics, wrote a nonfiction book or two, and went on to earn a Ph.D.\n\nMy dissertation about how highly successful novelists and poets enter flow, a state of full engagement and productivity, became the Southern California bestseller Writing in Flow: Keys to Enhanced Creativity. Next came Loving in Flow: How the Happiest Couples Get & Stay That Way.\n\nKylie\u2019s Heel is my first novel (see Sidebar for link). It\u2019s about a rational woman who has to deal with tragedy. The atheist theme of Kylie\u2019s Heel has become very meaningful to me, and I\u2019m now being more open about that in my work.\n\nMy web site: BunnyApe\n\nMy other blog:\u00a0Creating in Flow (for Psychology Today)",

I have worked some on the Church Calendar. I would like to start developing some series on basic Orthodox beliefs and practices: These include:\n\nI also have interests in helping make clarifications and suggestions for the Style Manual. For instance, I would like to help keep pages clear and concise. Having really long pages runs the risk of a lot of page scrolling.

At one time, this blog was about \u201ctruth\u201d [see old about page] but I have changed much since that was written, and this blog has changed along with me.\n\nmirror one\n\nIt is foolish and foolhardy to pursue \u201ctruth\u201d without stopping to properly know one\u2019s self first and you will never get to \u201cknow\u201d yourself, unless you are willing to brave the mirror and find out who you are.\n\nWhen we got through this \u201cwaking up\u201d process, and being our \u201cquest for truth,\u201d what we are essentially doing is to ask the three timeless questions every human on this planet wants the answers to. Who am I? How did I get here? Where am I going?\n\nmirror two\n\nHowever, whether by nature or programming, we tend to go about answering these questions in the wrong order, focusing on the last first. You will never find out where you came from or where you\u2019re going if you don\u2019t first take the time to find out who you are. Doing so requires looking deep into the mirror and breaking down each and every programmed construct of the artificial ego, and then peering into the depths of the void that is left.\n\nSuch a journey is not for everyone; it\u2019s a scary place to go. Just try to answer \u201cWho am I\u201d without making references to media influences, religious dogma or state-sanctioned activities. Most, I have found, cannot. If you\u2019re ready to strip away all the artificial layers of tradition and indoctrination, you\u2019re at the right place.\n\nmirror three\n\nThis is the way step inside. Come take the journey along with me.

I had written this long message but I figured you are probably a busy man so I will sum it up quickly.\n    Your blog cracks me up and is very informative at the same time! I like it! Thank You! Keep up the good work!\n\n\n  3. found you looking a mstar web-site looking forwqrd to your interveiw tonight..\n\n  4. I am in the search for truth and it keeps being me to so many rebels as I am turning into myself. Right now I find it hard to talk to the people that are the closes to me just as you stated in They Lives but I still feel that God loves is guiding me to the truth. Even though I see that most of this truth is trying to lead me against my spiritual love I still believe in God it\u2019s the world that is trying to separate us from the truth. At this point there is not much to say because I am in the learn faze but I still plan to do that as an individual because at this point any new info or old info can become a cult but my heart and spirit tells me different about what I am coming across now.\n\n  5. very intresting.\n\n    times are a changin.\n\n  6. I am in.\n    What happend to your Youtube channel? I wanted to watch some of your videos after a while and there is empty space left.\n\n  7. Hey CelticRebel I just want to thank you \u2013 I\u2019ve been following your blog\/shows for a month or so now, and I was going to put off writing to you until I absorbed more content \u2013 but at the moment I am about halfway through Dont Go West \u2013 and I just had to pause it and thank you. That\u2019s all I want to say, just thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n  8. You\u2019re right Alex, the only smokers left are the cool cats. \ud83d\ude42\n\n  9. Once i heard Michael Tsarion say that the phrase \u201cKnow Thyself\u201d is one of his favorites and it is so true .\n    you Celtic Rebel are one of the last true Warrios left in this jewpig hell hole\n    keep up the fight against the \u201cbitch boys\u201d that you like to call them haha\n    and it fits them perfectly !\n    by the way your co-host Alex is cool . she\u2019s so real\n    peace out\n\n  10. James Evans Pilato\u2019s usually very slick (if compromised) show is silent for the first time that I\u2019ve been listening. Can\u2019t help but wonder if this has to do with the Celt and Lee talking about James being outed last two nights. Krocks radio is silent whereas it\u2019s usually beaming is well produced show. Strange? or just a glitch to be quickly remedied? Well it\u2019s been five minutes now. Maybe he\u2019ll be back on soon\u2026. or not \u2026\n\n  11. What a brilliant, i-opening blog you have here, Celtic Rebel. Have only just discovered it and feel as though I have met a kindred spirit in a world of depraved insanity. Thank you for your fantastic research and hard work. And I love your writing too. It\u2019s hilarious!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

He is currently working on his Master of Art in Christian Ministry at Truett Seminary at Baylor University.\u00a0\n\nNathan and his wife Robin have been married for three years and currently do not have any kids, but have two dogs, Bailey and Bruiser.\n\nNathan believes that it is the whole church congregations role to raise up strong Christian teenage leaders who will be both the future of the church and leaders in the world (1 Timothy 4:12). He will be challenging students to make sure that Christian is not just a title that they have, but a lifestyle that they are living out each and every day. One of his favorite Bible verses which he feels really hits on how we should serve others is Colossians 1:24, \"I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the church.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nFirst Baptist Church of Gholson\n  \u2022 228 Wildcat Circle\n    Waco, Texas 76705\n  \u2022 Phone (254) 829-2321\n  \u2022 Email",
