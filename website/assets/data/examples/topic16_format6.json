Jan Moran Neil helps you make the right changes in your storylines\n\nMy daughter had a particularly turbulent plane journey when crossing the Sahara desert\n\n\u2018I saw my past few weeks flash before me,\u2019 she said. \u2018A whole series of events had brought me to what I thought to be a life-threatening moment on that plane: the discovery of my client\u2019s text proving his guilt meant there was a gap in my diary to take this unexpected trip.\u2019 She\u2019s a criminal barrister so she\u2019s used to seeing how the turn of events can have huge ramifications.\n\nShe continued. \u2018My husband managed to shift the date of an important presentation to take the trip. My mother-in-law was waiting on medical test results which were negative. If they weren\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t have booked the plane tickets.\u2019\n\nAnd so the series of events, those turning points which changed her status quo, had brought her to this chaos. Changing seats on the plane would not have helped her. She was stuck and there was no escape but she lived to tell the tale. This incident was either fate or unhappy coincidence. It depends on your viewpoint. Either way, it\u2019s our job as writers to mould the turn of events or coincidences into a meaningful shape.\n\nPurchase options below\nFind the complete article and many more in this issue of Writing Magazine - September 2016\nIf you own the issue, Login to read the full article now.\nSingle Issue - September 2016\nOr 499 points\nAnnual Digital Subscription\nOnly $ 3.33 per issue\nOr 3999 points\n6 Month Digital Subscription\nOnly $ 3.66 per issue\nOr 2199 points\nMonthly Digital Subscription\nOnly $ 3.99 per issue\nOr 399 points\n\nView Issues\n\nAbout Writing Magazine\n\nStar interview with Crime Novel of the Year winner and griplit star Clare Mackintosh 1 topic, 100 books: Make the most of your speciality Before you write a word: Start your writing life the right way 10 top tips: How the pros keep writing Author experiences: \u2022 Going back to school for a creative writing MA \u2022 \"How I wrote three books at once\" \u2022 Readers share their success stories WIN \u00a3119,000 in writing prizes News you can use! 20 packed pages of Writers' News\n\nOther Articles in this Issue",

        "text":"Stalled in Iran\n\n\nWhen she left Iran for the US in 1997, Azar Nafisi found that she was able to write with a freedom that she had not known since she was last in America as a student in the 1970s. Long muffled by Iranian censorship, she took advantage of her liberty to write a damaging and eloquent account of the Islamic Republic. Damaging, but indirect, for Reading Lolita in Tehran1 is about reading well-known works of English and American literature in a totalitarian environment\u2014about entering a fictional world whose morally ambiguous characters resist the leveling effects of ideology. In revolutionary Tehran, Nafisi writes, reading Invitation to a Beheading, Pride and Prejudice, and, of course, Lolita offered \u201ca critical way of appraising and grasping the world.\u201d In a political system that aims ruthlessly to homogenize, to impose a code of behavior and thought, fiction can be a weapon of resistance.\n\nDuring the decade or so that she spent teaching English literature at Tehran University and at Allameh Tabatabai University, also in Tehran, in addition to two years of private instruction of a class of young women, Nafisi was engaged in resistance. By setting very demanding standards of Islamic virtue from its citizens, the Islamic Republic has made criminals of millions of them. Nafisi was expelled from Tehran University for declining to wear the hejab, the Islamic head- and body-cover that the Iranian authorities have made mandatory. Later, at Allameh Tabatabai, she wore the hejab with contemptuous sloppiness; she ate ham and drank vodka after both had been banned; she had the temerity to try to shake the hand of a male student; and she taught Lolita to her private class, despite its perversion of what Islam, no less than any other religion, regards as a sacred relationship between a guardian and his juvenile charge.\n\nNafisi regards Reading Lolita in Tehran as an optimistic book about the \u201ctransformative power of literature.\u201d It contains a description of an exuberantly democratic classroom \u201ctrial,\u201d suggested by Nafisi herself, of The Great Gatsby, which has offended her Islamist and leftist students. The account of the trial goes on for pages, but some brief quotes can suggest its flavor. One of the Muslim students, Mr. Nyazi, states a case for the prosecution. \u201cThe only sympathetic person here,\u201d he says, \u201cis the cuckolded husband, Mr. Wilson. When he kills Gatsby, it is the hand of God. He is the only victim. He is the only gen-uine symbol of the oppressed, in the land of\u2026the Great Satan!\u201d A young woman, Zarrin, defends the book:\n\nCareless is the first adjective that comes to mind when describing the rich in this novel. The dream they embody is an alloyed dream that destroys whoever tries to get close to it. So you see, Mr. Nyazi, this book is no less a condemnation of your wealthy upper classes than any of the revolutionary books we have read.\n\nNafisi writes:\n\nI discovered later that most students had supported Zarrin, but very\u2026\n\nThis article is available to online subscribers only.\nPlease choose from one of the options below to access this article:\n\nPrint Premium Subscription \u2014 $99.95\n\nPurchase a print premium subscription (20 issues per year) and also receive online access to all content on nybooks.com.\n\nOnline Subscription \u2014 $69.00\n\nPurchase an Online Edition subscription and receive full access to all articles published by the Review since 1963.\n\nOne-Week Access \u2014 $4.99\n\nPurchase a trial Online Edition subscription and receive unlimited access for one week to all the content on nybooks.com.\n\nIf you already have one of these subscriptions, please be sure you are logged in to your nybooks.com account.

It\u2019s true, I do have to ruefully shake my head with an expression of \u2018what might have been\u2019 at the thought of all those wasted years. You see, back when I started writing historical fiction the field was far less packed than it has become of late. The big name was Bernard Cornwell (and still is, mind you), and\u00a0authors like Conn Iggulden and Simon Scarrow were still plotting their successful assault on the charts.\n\nPicture the scene, if you will.
