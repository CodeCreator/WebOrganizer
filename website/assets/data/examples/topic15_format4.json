        "text":"VIDEO: Gasland Director Caught Using Deception (What Else Is New?)\n\nEarlier this week, we explained the fraud that underlies the iconic scenes in both Gasland and Gasland Part II. This was, of course, in addition to the complete debunk of the second film that we posted back in April. It was clear that, although the facts do not support Josh Fox, our friends in the media needed a reminder that his claims have been contradicted by state regulatory investigations.\n\nFollowing up on those widely disseminated responses, we decided that there was still a greater need to explain the deception in Josh Fox\u2019s films. So we decided to create a video, which you can see above, that lays out how the Gasland films have willfully and shamefully ignored the determinations of state regulatory agencies, solely to inflate risks and gin up fear among its viewers.\n\nThe video raises an important question: Who is a more credible authority on issues related to hydraulic fracturing: Environmental regulators who actually inspect oil and gas wells, or a New York City filmmaker whose movies have been called \u201cfundamentally dishonest,\u201d \u201cpure propaganda,\u201d and \u201cscience denial\u201d?\n\nDecide for yourself.\n\n\n  1. Steven Lipsky says:\n\n    The gas from the hose is gas venting out the top of my water well.\n    This is gas coming from the head space of my well and testing shows is the same gas in my water. The garden hose shown is vented gas from my well and the TRRC, TCEQ, EPA, OIG, Justice Dept , Parker County Fire Marshall Office and many others all can confirm this. Many of them used the hose to collect gas samples for lab testing this is including a contractor from Range.\n\n  2. Bill says:\n\n    Mr. Everly,\n\n    I see you cannot reply to the man you accuse of faking his dilemma. Let\u2019s see you are sitting in D.C. commenting on things you are no where near. Hmmm.\n    Try living next to an injection or fracking well. Then have a glass of water out of one of those water wells or hang around the site during drilling phase. Better yet pitch a tent next to a condensate tank for a night or two if you think it\u2019s so safe.\n\n    I can almost believe you if you used sources that had no ties to the Gas & Oil industry. Just another blogger who doesn\u2019t understand that ALL energy policy is written WITH and by the industry and not for the people.\n\n    The dollar always speaks louder than people\u2019s health.\n\n    Common sense with mother nature here:\n    If gas pockets are trapped in rock, even with a water well, and there was no issue with gas prior to the invasion of drilling, pressure, and fluids. Regardless if it passed through 10 shale shelves or pockets.\n\n    But fracking shows up and ta! da! methane in the water.\n\n    How can you possibly pro port that as \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d?\n\n    Try to add mechanically induced or externally contributing factors. to your vocabulary, you won\u2019t sound like such a sell out or a fracky lacky\u2026\n\n    I just hope you can man up when the whole fracking industry turns into a national Love Canal (you probably have no idea about that). The contamination reports are piling up. No more allegations now there\u2019s facts and investigations going on\u2026\n\n    \u2022 Steve Everley says:\n\n      Hi Bill, thanks for your comment. In my post I have cited the findings from an investigation completed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. This regulatory body looked into the claims behind the flaming hose and determined \u2013 as a result of their investigation and analysis \u2013 that nearby natural gas wells \u201chave not contributed and are not contributing to contamination of any domestic water wells.\u201d For the complete report, see here:\n\n  3. James H says:\n\n    How do you explain the fact that the gas that is coming out of these peoples water supply is \u201cfingerprinted\u201d to the gas that is being produced as a result of nearby hydraulic fracturing?\n\n    I find it funny that you keep pointing back to the regulatory agencies as substantiating the fact that fracking and drilling are not the source of methane and other flammable gas contamination of peoples wells and aquifers.\n    Gasland clearly points out the regulatory changes ( as a result of political pressure ) that have brought this about.\n\n    I would like to point out that I clearly understand the need for America to reduce it dependency on foreign energy products. I actually believe that drilling could be a good thing for America. What I dont understand is that with all the money to be made by this industry why it has to be done in such an irresponsible way. 20% failure rate on well casings from day one? Is this industry not capable of advancing its own technology to solve these issues and thus prevent such dramatic anti industry displays like the flaming gas hose?\n\n    \u2022 Hi James, thanks for your questions.\n\n      First of all, the gas was actually fingerprinted to be originating from the Strawn formation, not the Barnett Shale, the latter of which is the formation from which Range was producing. EPA admitted under oath that it did not test for the presence of nitrogen in the samples it took in 2010, and Strawn and Barnett gas have almost identical fingerprints \u2014 except for nitrogen, of which Strawn gas is known to contain high quantities (Barnett does not). Here is a link to the full deposition, where John Blevins, representing the EPA, said \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I could say EPA has an expert to opine on the nitrogen levels within any gas source.\u201d\n\n      The methane discovered in the water wells in question also contained high levels of nitrogen. See more here:\n\n      In addition, a nearby resident actually drilled her water well into the gas-bearing Strawn formation several years before.\n\n      The failure rate you cite is pure invention. Actual data show that the failure rate is a fraction of a percent, somewhere around 0.01 percent and 0.03 percent, based on an examination of tens of thousands of wells. That still means there\u2019s room for improvement, but the well failure rates cited by activists like Josh Fox and Tony Ingraffea are designed purely to scare people, and they are based on phony interpretations of statistics. In some cases, they have been disputed by the very sources they cited. You can read more about the bogus and inflated \u201cfailure claims\u201d here:\n\n      Once again, thanks for reading, and hopefully this clears up any misconceptions that you had.\n\n\nSpeak Your Mind",

I had 12 acres done around my house in 2006 and what would have taken me a few months to get done two guys did in about a week.\n\n    I had some uneven places where I wouldn't drive my tractor at all and the guy on the tractor just puttered along and put a post anywhere he wanted.

        "text":"Grady County Sec 12 & 1 9N-6W Roan Resources\n\nI started receiving checks this year from Roan Resources this year for the new wells at this location. I had not received a check this month so I emailed ROAN to find out whats up. I get this response:\n\n\u201cThe account is negative $ (they gave the amount). This is why a check was not issued for August. This was due to the Langston well previously being overpaid. Corrections were made in August. Once the account is positive again, a check will be issued\u201d\n\nDoes anyone know how this happens? or if it ever happens? Are they guessing at the production the other months??\n\nI find this really fishy. I have emailed them back but I get a typical \u201cIt will take 5 business days for a response\u201d\n\nPlease let me know how I can verify the production volumes or who to talk to and what to ask for proof.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPeople make mistakes. Production might be credited to the wrong well because someone coded in the wrong property number. Some times there are price adjustments. The sources for possible corrections are many; usually, the amounts are not enough to create a negative balance. If you look at the last 12 months of check details for 10 different wells I would be surprised if 5 or more did not have some kind of adjustment during that time period. You should still receive a monthly statement from Roan showing the correction and the resulting negative balance. Then going forward you should receive a statement every month showing how that balance is being paid off. In a few months you might check production on the OTC website to see if it matches the volumes on check detail or statement. I was overpaid by Marathon on a well in Grady County, and it took over a year to eliminate the negative balance.\n\nSounds like it\u2019s more than a \u201cmistake\u201d\n\nRoan is still paying me on 595 but quite less than I had before. I have heard that Roan is in big trouble and looking for a buyer or bankruptcy. Let\u2019s hope they find a buyer",

The job involves the construction of a 1.2m high brick wall for which i have a few concerns about the quality of his blockwork beneath ground. I have attached an image which shows the main concern - that he has not buttered the sides of the blockwork with mortar resulting in the bottom course not being bonded to the blockwork beside them - only bonded to the blockwork above and beneath.\n\n    My question is whether this (no doubt for the purposes of saving time and materials) is likely to affect the structural integrity of the finished wall and make it more prone to movement.\n\n    All knowledgeable responses appreciated.Click image for larger version\n\nName:\tP1030126.jpg\nViews:\t1\nSize:\t285.1 KB\nID:\t16654\n\n  \u2022 #2\n    Re: bricklaying - is my bricklayer capable?\n\n    The joints are not even raked. Maybe he left the sides open for drainage? If you are in a freeze zone that will be a disaster. Should have drainage behind the wall.\n\n\n    \u2022 #3\n      Re: bricklaying - is my bricklayer capable?\n\n      thanks for your response - please can you clarify to whta freeze zone refers and also drainage behind the wall. The 2 courses of blockwork referred to are beneath ground with earth on both sides of the wall.\n\n\n      \u2022 #4\n        Re: bricklaying - is my bricklayer capable?\n\n        Fist of all I am not a mason but have layed more block than have I desired to over the years,\n\n        It looks like weep holes to me, which is a correct practice, as far as finishing the joints, I normally did finish them on the block I layed that was not visible, but it probably makes little difference, I guess the real question is what will the exposed look like,\n\n        I believe what he is referring to a freeze zone is the depth in which the ground freezes in the winter,\n\n        If water gets trapped behind the wall, the weep holes allow the water to migrate through the wall minimizing the hydraulic pressure that may occur with trapped water.\n        Last edited by BHD; 09-28-2012, 05:56 PM.\n        Push sticks\/blocks Save Fingers\n        \"The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.\"\n        attributed to Samuel Johnson\n        PUBLIC NOTICE: Due to recent budget cuts, the rising cost of electricity, gas, and the current state of the economy............the light at the end of the tunnel, has been turned off.\n\n\n        \u2022 #5\n          Re: bricklaying - is my bricklayer capable?\n\n          I am no bricklayer, and being in Florida we don't worry about freezes. But, we do have water issues. Even for landscape walls, contractors put a filtering membrane down in back of wall then backfill with gravel. This way the weep holes or pvc drains installed though the wall can drain without getting clogged up with dirt.\n          I suppose your bricklayer poured a good concrete footer to lay them bricks on, right??\n\n\n          \u2022 #6\n            Re: bricklaying - is my bricklayer capable?\n\n            The OP said there will be dirt on both sides of the blocks. The vertical joints in that first row won't mean a thing. It is vertical support that the bricklayer is after, and the wall as it is will provide that. The second row bonds everything together.\n\n\n            \u2022 #7\n              Re: bricklaying - is my bricklayer capable?\n\n              I too am not a bricklayer although I have done some building of block walls. It is not uncommon to leave some joints in the bottom row unfilled for drainage but that really depends on the entire picture. If drainage was the reason the the slope in front and behind the wall should encourage water to flow as needed out of the primary area.\n\n              it really depends on the design. For example I have built a block wall without such drainage holes but I have had a suitable drain in the primary area so as not to worry about doing something like this.\n\n              I think you need to speak with your bricklayer and ask why those joints are unfilled.\n\n              Up close those joints look a bit messy and it does not look like they have been racked with a striking tool.\n              Last edited by blue_can; 09-30-2012, 01:50 PM.",

No doubt the vibration is hard on those pressure tubes and other components. But just to note, it's not limited to diesels only. I've been into several gas tractors with broken pressure tubes in the SOS and have sold used tubes to several people who have found broken ones in gas tractors. Might be a lot more common in diesels, but a gas engine isn't a guarantee of a good tube. Just sayin'.\n\n[Log in to Reply] \u00a0\u00a0[No Email]\n\n05-21-2013 18:56:06\n\nReport to Moderator\n\u00a0Re: Ford 901 Select O Speed Mystery in reply to John Smith8N, 05-20-2013 12:00:56 \u00a0\nHello John , Yes you are absolutely correct also , because many of these tractors could have been originally diesels then converted to gas or just changed transmissions over the years or just possible a gas one did break the tube too , most guys would not know what they were originally or even care what they were or even bother to look they would have just wanted them fixed so they could get back to work .

        "text":"Glass Message Board\n\nGlass Mall => Glass Market Place => Topic started by: refractory on November 25, 2016, 07:51:07 AM\n\nTitle: Glass Refractory in China\nPost by: refractory on November 25, 2016, 07:51:07 AM\nChina's glass industry is developing rapidly, and has become the world's first glass production power. The rapid development of the glass industry naturally promotes the development and technological progress of China's glass furnace refractory materials. Compared with the traditional process, modern glass production technology has a qualitative leap which towards the direction of higher efficiency, lower energy consumption and better product quality. Accordingly, the technical level of glass furnace which is as the core equipment of glass production is also in constant progress, for instance, widely adopt new technologies to improve the combustion intensity, strengthen heat transfer effect, reduce heat loss and educe the pollution of products and environment.\n\nThe technological progress of glass furnace requires a variety of high quality refractory bricks as the guarantee condition which can withstand high temperature, resist to strong chemical corrosion and bear severe stress damage. In order to achieve the new furnace technology of high efficiency, energy saving and low pollution, it is very important to combine and use several kinds of high quality refractory in one glass furnace, for example, fused cast AZS brick 33# is mainly used in relatively low temperature and corrosive parts of glass furnace such as working ends, feeder channel; fused cast AZS brick 41# is especially applied to seriously corrosive parts of glass furnace such as throat, bottom budding, dam brick, electric brick corners, doghouse and also can be used in sidewalls; Zircon brick is mainly used in the superstructure of flame space and tank bottom of glass furnace; fused cast alumina brick (\u03b1-\u03b2 brick) is mainly used as the ideal refractory material for feeder channel, spouts and working ends of glass furnaces.\n\nGo through years of work and the efforts of all aspects, the glass refractory in China has made significant progress, greatly narrowed the gap with foreign, laid a more solid foundation for enterprise development. As long as the next step to strengthen macro management, concentrating in taro in error problem to solve, we can make greater contributions to the development of glass industry.\nTitle: For the development of refractory brick industry to provide new and good opportu\nPost by: refractory on August 04, 2017, 03:06:41 AM\n\u00a0;D China's metallurgical industry will continue to develop steadily, in the number of scale growth rate will slow down, but in improving quality, develop varieties and reduce energy consumption are required to achieve a higher level. Therefore, backward, old technology and equipment will be gradually eliminated, and advanced technology and equipment to promote the application will be accelerated. For example, in the iron and steel industry, furnace and small blast furnace, converter and electric furnace will be eliminated, and continuous casting and furnace refining will be faster and development and application. These conditions will provide a new and good opportunity for the development of refractory bricks, as well as new and stringent requirements for the quality of refractory bricks and will lead to more intense use among hundreds of refractory tiles manufacturers in China competition.\nThey have to struggle to survive and develop, and the decisive factors are as follows:\n(1) product quality stability and reliability;\n(2) the production of more refractory bricks affordable, competitive and efficient products;\n(3) the ability to develop a better use of high quality new products, and provide good after-sales service.\nIt is foreseeable that the future of China's refractory industry will adjust the product structure, increase the production of highly efficient products. We should accelerate the development of efficient bauxite products, further improve their quality and reduce costs. The competition between refractory bricks and unshaped materials (including preforms) will continue in the future. The proportion of production of amorphous materials will be greater growth, and efficient castables will lead the position: in this regard, the powder process; (preparation and application) should be a research and development as a focus.\nConsidering high temperature performance (mechanical properties, thermal shock resistance, corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance), oxide and non-oxide composite materials is a promising new type of high quality and high efficiency refractory bricks, which may rise in the new century And gradually developed. This is a field that is worth exploring, investing and developing. China's refractory brick industry, the early next century will be the structure of the optimization period. Refractory brick manufacturers will be re-combination and adjustment; internal structure and management will be reformed; variety structure will change; technology and equipment will be updated; the adaptability of the market economy will be improved by 2020 China's refractory brick industry will catch up with high temperature Industrial development pace, but also to adapt to the international market trend of refractory bricks.",

        "text":"Tractor side mower hp\n\nDiscussion in 'Tractors' started by Tharrell, Mar 16, 2013.\n\n  1. Tharrell\n\n    Tharrell LawnSite Silver Member\n    Posts: 2,964\n\n    I may need a tractor this year and I'll have to have a flail mower for the rear and then switch to bush hog on the rear and a sidearm bush hog for the winter.\n    I don't know much about tractors so I was hoping you guys could school me a little as to what hp I'll need and some recommendations. Thanks\n  2. LindblomRJ\n\n    LindblomRJ LawnSite Silver Member\n    Posts: 2,570\n\n    With the requirements listed I'd look for a tractor in the 45 to 60 horse power range. The tasks given are PTO intensive. Kubota, John Deere and New Holland are the big three. I prefer Deere or New Holland, but it is a matter of preference and dealer support.\n\n    I'd look at used. I'd look at something with up to 2000 hours, the more the hours the more I'd want to see the service records.\n    Posted via Mobile Device\n  3. How big of mowers?\n  4. LawnCareNoobie\n\n    LawnCareNoobie LawnSite Senior Member\n    Posts: 434\n\n    For rear bush hogging I heard of having at least 5 pto hp for every 1 foot width. So if you have a 5 ft bush hog you're going to want 25 hp minimum pto output. Keep in mind that it's not the total engine hp. The more hp you can get the better, obviously.\n  5. Snyder's Lawn Inc\n\n    Snyder's Lawn Inc LawnSite Platinum Member\n    Posts: 4,541\n\n    That's not always true all depends if its a 540 or 1000 pto bushhog\n\n    Takes more HP to run a 1000 pto BH\n    Takes less HP to run a 540 pto BH both being same size BH\n\n    Gear box takes more HP then tire driven BH\n\n    Check out Tiger they have Side arm cutter Most tractors are 80-100hp that runs sidearm cutters\n  6. Tharrell\n\n    Tharrell LawnSite Silver Member\n    Posts: 2,964\n\n    The potential jobs are divided road mowing in the city with a flail mower in the summer.\n    The winter job is a right away and flood control areas next to 2 rivers.\n    There is a lot of flat ground being done with a bush hog and some steep stuff inaccessible except by hand.\n    There are a lot of areas I think is being done (i would) with a side arm but it hasn't been done yet.\n  7. LawnCareNoobie\n\n    LawnCareNoobie LawnSite Senior Member\n    Posts: 434\n\n    I think specifically it's for a normal 540 pto with gearbox.\n\nShare This Page",
