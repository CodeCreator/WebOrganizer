Then came the need for a loader tractor whereupon a second hand fully refurbished 4 cylinder 880 Implematic with AL2 front loader, bucket and fork was purchased in 1969. That tractor did many years trouble free service, cleaning out dung every spring from the covered yard that the cows over wintered in and was 5 feet deep and took several days to clean out. It also did a lot of field work and loading bales with a Lawrence Edwards 'Perry Loader'. This tractor broke a crank whilst rolling ploughed ground one day and was then, as it was, traded back for an 885 VQ with L8 power loader, fork and bucket in 1976, it was only 2 years old and that one was used until 1997 when I gave up milking and replaced with an E plate 1394 with QD90 loader. In 1978 we bought a brand new 995 VQ2 trading back the 880 Selectamatic that was by this time well worn out. The 995 was replaced in 1995 with a Second hand 1983 1394 which was kept until 1996 when sold on privateley and replaced with a much cheaper to buy, a 1983 1490 2wd which I still have. The 1394 and QD90 loader was sold when I started letting my land out. I still needed a handy loader tractor and found privateley a pre-Q 1212 with L12 front loader and bought in 1998 a very low hours 1294 on a B plate. These tractors, the 1212, 1294 and 1490 I still have. So, that's continuous David Brown tractor use on the same farm from March 1961 to date, 51 years.\n\nUser avatar\nPosts: 41\nJoined: Mon May 16, 2011 10:44 am\nLocation: Oldham Lancahire\n\nRE: 62 years of DB\n\nPost by philipday \u00bb Sun May 13, 2012 3:16 pm\n\nMy father bought his first DB 950 in 1960\/61 straight from DB's London Showroom where it had spent two years impressing foreign dignatories. It was replaced in the showroom by one of the new 950 implematics and was a bargain at \u00c2\u00a3450-00 to say it was two years or so old but was unused.It was joined by a 990 implematic in 1965 and then a 996 in 1972 and a 1212 in 1980, the latter three have since gone to tractor heaven but the 950 remains and has been joined by a 780,885 and 1212.Our main tractor now is a John Deere 6520 with all the DB's having to play some part throughout the year on our dairy farm.\n\nUser avatar\nPosts: 63\nJoined: Tue Dec 09, 2008 9:15 pm\nLocation: ely cambridge\n\nPost by gixxermatt \u00bb Sun May 13, 2012 9:29 pm\n\nwe had our 1st db in early 60s, was a 950 from then on we have had 990 imp, 990 sel, 885, 780, 1200 , 995, 996,1212, 1412 , 1290 , 1690 , 1690 t x 2 ,1394x 2 , 1594 x 2 . in my collection \/ on farm now is 5 990s,780,885 1190 995x2 delux, 2290, 1494 still use most off em occasionly, carried the case make until last year when we got a valtra n series\n780,885,990 imp . 2 x 990 , 2 x 995 delux 2290 5150 x 25 mtx 140 856 and 956 valtra n142 versu\n\nUser avatar\nPosts: 261\nJoined: Fri May 09, 2008 8:44 pm\nLocation: Nr.

I am plugged into a 220V 20amp circuit and have my amperage set to 150Amps, \"Steel\" is selected on the machine. I have over 1,000LBS of Argon in my tank set at 13-15cfm and I can hear the valve open and close when I activate the peddle. I am using a 2% Thoriated 3\/32 electrode with a freshly ground tip and a 3\/8 cup orifice.\n\n    Once I have established the arc and begin moving forward, with or without a filler rod, the arc will suddenly flare-up very brightly for a second or two and then go back to the original arc shape. The flare-up is so bright that I have to stop and let my eyes adjust before I can continue. This happens intermittently every 5-10 seconds.\n\n    I never had this problem on the high-end Miller equipment I learned on at the local Tech College. I have welded with this machine with no issues in the past but this is my first attempt at welding 3\/16 to 16gauge.\n\n    I am well aware most issues are \"user error\" but I can't figure out what is causing these flare-ups.\n\n    Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\n    Frustrated in Cincinnati\n\n  2. #2\n    Join Date\n    Dec 2011\n\n\n    I have the same machine with no problems as you have described, it sounds like you may have some type of contamination in the metal itself once you get it to that liquid state at that point you start having a problem.

I have had a tungsten contamination look like this as well, but when this happens, stop, and look at the material and you will always see what caused it. Usually it is caused by putting aluminum particles on the tungsten then welding steel, that is why to always use a diamond wheel for tungsten sharpening.\n\n    The only way for an auto dark helmet to work here I would say is to induce light into the helmet on a switch that you can trigger with your foot to keep it dark.\n\nPosting Permissions\n\n  \u2022 You may not post new threads\n  \u2022 You may not post replies\n  \u2022 You may not post attachments\n  \u2022 You may not edit your posts\n\nWarning: Function split() is deprecated in \/mnt\/stor3-wc1-dfw1\/357822\/357839\/ on line 73\n\nWelding Projects\n\nSpecial Offers: See the latest Miller deals and promotions.",

        "text":"Real Seal still leaks?\n\nWed May 26, 2004 6:03 pm\n\nYou guy that have done this before please help me with a couple of problems. I had a bad leak so I order a new rear seal gasket and the gasket for the rear seal retainer. I split the tractor and took every thing off, clutch, flywheel, seal retainer, oil pump cover. I wanted to replace the gasket on the oil pump cover (which is very very thin) but I can't find the part # in my parts book so I used the old one and it does not seem to leak, but I would like to replace it if I can find it.\nI put the new gasket and seal in and when I put it back together and cranked it up it still leaked around the bottom of the new seal in the retainer. It did not fit in the retainer real tight but the part # is correct. When you put them side by side the diameter is the same but thickness on the new seal is about 1\/16 thiner than the original. Any help would be appreciated. :?",

On mine the torque converter was bad so I didn't use the loader much, but it had a heck of a powerful back hoe. My advice would be, if your not a good mechanic with a lot of tools, walk away.

The only real problem is - all the roadblocks I have to go through when I want to leave and run to my warehouse. That has slowed me down somewhat. Otherwise we're safe.\n\nPS - I really didnt think we made national news on this - but apparantly we did! I've had other customers ask me about it.\n\nGlad to her it Bruce\n\nThis response submitted by Cecil on 10\/23\/05 at 8:47 PM.

        "text":"Takt Time \u2013 Cycle Time\n\nThere has been an interesting discussion thread on \u201cKaizen (Continuous Improvement) Experts\u201d group on LinkedIn over the last few weeks on the differences between takt time and cycle time.\n\nThis is one of the fundamentals I\u2019d have thought was well understood out there, along with some nuances, but I was quite surprised by the number (and \u201cquality\u201d) of misconceptions posted by people with \u201clean\u201d and \u201cSigma\u201d in their job titles.\n\nI see two fundamental sources of confusion, and I would like to clarify each here.\n\n\u201cCycle Time\u201d has multiple definitions.\n\n\u201cCycle time\u201d can mean the total elapsed time between when a customer places an order and when he receives it. This definition can be used externally, or with internal customers. This definition actually pre-dates most of the English publications about the Toyota Production System.\n\nIt can also express the dock-to-dock flow time of the entire process, or some other linear segment of the flow. The value stream mapping in\u00a0Learning to See calls this \u201cproduction lead time\u201d but some people call the same thing \u201ccycle time.\u201d\n\nIn early publications about the TPS, such as Suzaki\u2019s New Manufacturing Challange and Hirano\u2019s JIT Implementation Manual, the term \u201ccycle time\u201d is used to represent what, today, we call \u201ctakt time.\u201d Just to confuse things more, \u201ccycle time\u201d is\u00a0also\u00a0used to represent the actual work cycle which may, or may not, be balanced to the takt time.\n\nWe also have machine cycle time, which is the start-to-start time of a machine and is used to balance to a manual work cycle and, in conjunction with the batch size, \u00a0is a measure of its theoretical capacity.\n\n\u201cCycle time\u201d is used to express the total manual work involved in a process, or part of a process.\n\nAnd, of course, \u201ccycle time\u201d is used to express the work cycle of a single person, not including end-of-cycle wait time.\n\nNone of these definitions is wrong. The source of confusion is when the users have not first been clear on their context. Therefore, it is critically important to establish context when you are talking.\u00a0Adjectives\u00a0like \u201coperator cycle time\u201d help. But the main thing is to be\u00a0conscious\u00a0that this can be a major source of confusion until you are certain you and the other person are on the same wavelength.\n\nTakt time is often over simplified.\n\nThe classic calculation for takt time is:\n\nAvailable Minutes for Production \/ Required Units of Production = Takt Time\n\nThis is exactly right. But people tend to get wrapped up around what constitutes \u201cavailable time.\u201d The \u201cpure\u201d definition is usually to take the total shift time(s) and subtract breaks, meetings, and other administrative non-working time. Nobody ever has a problem with this. (Maybe because that is the way Shingijutsu teaches it, and people tend to accept what Shingijutsu says at face value.)\n\nSo let\u2019s review and example of what we have really done here. For the sake of a simple discussion, let\u2019s assume a single 8 hour shift on a 5 day work week. There is a 1\/2 hour\u00a0unpaid\u00a0lunch break in the middle of the day, so the workers are actually in the plant \u201cat work\u201d for 8 1\/2 hours. (this is typical in the USA, if you are in another country, it might be different for you)\n\nSo we start with 8 hours:\n\n8 hours x 60 minutes = 480 total minutes\n\nBut there is a 10 minute start-up process in the morning, two 10 minute breaks during the day, and 15 minutes shut-down and clean up at the end of the shift for a total of 45 minutes. This time is not production time, so it is subtracted from \u201cavailable minutes\u201d:\n\n480 \u2013 45 = 435\n\nA very common mistake at this point would be to subtract the 30 minute lunch break. But notice that we did not include that time to start with. Subtracting it again would count it twice.\n\nSo when determining takt time, we would use 435 minutes as the baseline. If \u00a0leveled customer demand was 50 units \/ day, then the takt time would be:\n\n435 available minutes \/ 50 required units of production = 8.7 minutes (or 522 seconds)\n\nNote that you can just as easily do this for a week, rather than a day.\n\n435 minutes x 5 days = 2175 total available minutes\n\n2175 available minutes \/ 250 required units of production\u00a0still equals\u00a08.7 minutes (or 522 seconds)\n\nAll of this is very basic stuff, and I would get few arguments up to this point, so why did I go through it?\n\nBecause if you were to run this factory at a 522 second takt time, you\u00a0will\u00a0come up short of your production targets. You\u00a0will\u00a0have to work overtime to make up the difference, or simply choose not to make it up.\n\nWhy? Because there are always problems, and problems disrupt production. Those disruptions come at the expense of the 435 minutes, and you end up with less production time than you calculated.\n\nThen there is the fact that the plant manager called an all-hands safety meeting on Thursday. That pulled 30 minutes out of your production time. Almost four units of production lost there.\n\nI could go on with a myriad of examples gathered from real production floors, but you get the idea.\n\nHere is what is even worse, though.\n\nWhen are you going to work on improvements?\n\nIf you expect operators to do their daily machine checks,\u00a0when\u00a0do you expect that to happen?\n\nDo you truly expect your\u00a0team members to \u201cstop the line\u201d when there is a problem?\n\nAll of these things take time away from production.\n\nThe consequence is that the shop floor leadership \u2013 the ones who have to deal with the consequences of disrupted production \u2013 will look at takt time as a nice theory, or a way to express a quota, but on a minute-by-minute level, it is pretty useless for actually pacing production.\n\nAll because it was oversimplified.\n\nIf you expect people to do something other than produce all day, you have to give them time to do it.\n\nLet\u2019s get back to the fundamental purpose of takt time and then see what makes sense.\n\nThe Purpose of Takt Time\n\nHere is some heresy: Running to takt time is wholly unnecessary. Many factories operate just fine without even knowing what it is.\n\nWhat those factories lose, however, is a fine-grained sense of how things are going minute by minute. Truthfully, if they have another way to immediately see disruptions, act to clear them, followed by solving the underlying problem then they are as \u201clean\u201d as anyone. So here is the second heresy: You don\u2019t NEED takt time to \u201cbe lean.\u201d\n\nWhat you\u00a0need\u00a0is\u00a0some way\u00a0to determine the minimum resource necessary to get the job done (JIT), and a way to continuously compare what is actually happening vs. what\u00a0should be happening, and then a process to immediately act on any difference (jidoka). This is what makes \u201clean\u201d happen.\n\nTakt time is\u00a0just a tool for doing this. It is, however, a very effective tool. It is so effective, in fact, that it is largely considered a necessary fundamental. Honestly, in day to day conversation, that is how I look at it. I made the above statements to get you to think outside the mantras for a minute.\n\nWhat is takt time,\u00a0really?\n\nTakt time is an expression of your customer demand normalized and leveled over the time\u00a0you choose to produce. It is\u00a0not, and never has been, a pure customer demand signal. Customers do not order the same quantity every day. They do not stop ordering during your breaks, or when your shift is over. What takt time does, however, is make customer demand appear\u00a0level across your working day.\n\nThis has several benefits.\n\nFirst, is it makes capacity calculations really easy through a complex flow. You can easily determine what each and every process\u00a0must\u00a0be capable of. You can determine the necessary speeds of machines and other capital equipment. You determine minimum batch sizes when there are changeovers involved. You can look at any process and quickly determine the optimum number of people required to make it work,\u00a0plus see opportunities where a little bit of kaizen will make a big difference in productivity.\n\nMore importantly, though, takt time gives your team members a way to know\u00a0exactly\u00a0what \u201csuccess\u201d looks like for each and every unit of production. (assuming you give them a way to compare every work cycle against the takt time \u2013 you do that, don\u2019t you?)\n\nThis gives your team members the ability to let you know\u00a0immediately\u00a0if something is threatening required output. Put another way, it gives your entire team the ability to see quickly spot problems and respond to them before little issues accumulate into working on Saturday.\n\nThe key point here is that to get the benefit, you have to have a takt time that\u00a0actually paces production. It has to be real, tangible, and practically applied on the shop floor. Otherwise it is just an abstract, theoretical number.\n\nThis means holding back \u201cavailable time\u201d for various planned (and unplanned) events where production would be stopped.\n\nFurther, in a complex flow, there may be local takt times \u2013 for example, a process that feeds more than one main line is going to be running to the aggregated demand, and so its takt will be faster than either of them. Likewise, a feeder line that builds up a part or option that is not used on every unit is going to be running slower.\n\nAnd finally if disruptions\u00a0do cause shortfalls to the required output, you have to make it up sometime. If you are constrained from running overtime (and many operations are for various reasons), then your only alternative is to build a slight over speed into your takt time calculation. The nuances of this are the topic of a much longer essay, but the basics are this:\n\n\u2013 If everything goes well, you will finish early. Stop and use the time for organized improvement of either process or developing people. Continuing to produce is overproduction, and just means you run out of work\u00a0sooner if you have a good day tomorrow.\n\n\u2013 If there are issues, the use the buffer time for its intended purpose.\n\n\u2013 If there are more issues than buffer time, there is an operational decision to make. Have a policy in place for this. The simplest is \u201chope for a better day tomorrow\u201d and use... (truncated)",
