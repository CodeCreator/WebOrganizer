Show all posts\n\nMonday, December 20, 2010\n\nIt's that time of year... for colds!\n\nYes, the cold bug has hit our house, so I thought I would share a few of our favorite herbal tea mixes, which have been getting a lot of play around here in the last few days. These would also make great gifts, presented with a tea strainer or holiday tea towel.\u00a0 Of course, I'm no doctor, but these blends have helped soothe throats and chests and nerves around these parts. I don't have a good local source, so I purchase all of my herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs, Starwest Botanicals, and The Bulk Herb Store.\n\n\u00a0Cold and Flu Tea\nMix 1 part elder flowers (good for colds, flu and fever) with one part marshmallow root (cough expectorant and the kids like the flavor). Steep for 3 - 5 minutes and sweeten with honey (also good for coughs). These are both soft herbs, so don't let them steep too long or they'll get a bitter taste.\n\nCough Tea (especially good for calming dry, barking and asthma coughs)\nMix two parts red clover to a scant one part licorice root. Peel and slice a small piece of fresh ginger, and add to tea cup or small pot. Add a teaspoon of the herbs and steep for 3 - 5 minutes (if making this for kids, check after 3 minutes. The ginger and licorice can become too strong if steeped for a long time). Strain into a new cup and add a teaspoon of honey.\nNote: licorice should not be used continuously for a long period of time, and never for people with high blood pressure\n\nRelaxation Tea (for those care givers!)\nIn a mason jar combine two parts peppermint, two parts chamomile, one parts lemon balm, ginkgo, St. John's wort, and licorice. Add dried orange peels (I save orange peels in a jar in the fridge and then dry them in my dehydrator to add to teas).\u00a0 Steep for five minutes and sweeten to taste.\n\nWishing you and your family good health this season!\n\nWednesday, June 30, 2010\n\nDr. Mom\n\nAh, summer - sprinklers, gardening, trips to the beach... and rashes and bug bites. This itch relieving tincture has been getting a lot of use around here lately, so I thought I'd share the super simple recipe with you.\n\nVodka (any cheap kind will do)\n\nFill a glass jar 3\/4 full with equal portions of the herbs. Add vodka to cover herbs completely and cap jar. Let steep in a dark cupboard for a minimum of two weeks, but I like to go for four. Shake daily, if you remember. If not, it still works. Strain tincture into a clean glass bottle. This is a tincture (extraction through alcohol), so DON'T use on scraped or broken skin (ow!), but it's fabulous on heat rashes and bug bites.\u00a0 I keep it in the fridge, because the cold also helps soothe itchy skin.\n\nFor broken or scraped skin, mash up dried (or fresh, if you have it) plantain with a little water, then put a glob of it on your cut. Cover with a damp cloth and leave on for about 10 minutes.\n\nFor my latest tincture, I also added mallow root to the mix. I buy most of my herbs through Mountain Rose Herbs or Starwest Botanicals, and both are fabulous companies.\u00a0 You can also steep the herbs in olive oil to use in lotions or simply apply the oil. Oils should steep for at least six weeks.\u00a0 Easy, frugal, good for the Earth, and it works!",

        "text":"#76 How to Optimise Your Brain Health with Dr Rahul Jandial\nPlay episode \u00b7 1 hr 14 min\n\nWe are undergoing a huge technological experiment. In our pockets we have tiny technological miracles through which we can communicate, instantly, with anyone on the planet. We are constantly bombarded with endless information. But what impact is all this having on our brain? Why is it important to allow our brains to drift into random thoughts and be creative? I discuss all this with neuroscientist and brain surgeon, Dr Rahul Jandial, who loves technology but believes that we need to structure some boundaries around its use \u2013 especially for children. We talk about the impact of music on the brain and what it means to be in flow state. Dr Jandial explains what happens in the brain when we engage in what he calls \u201cmeditative breathing\u201d and why he is such a huge proponent of it. He explains how his\u00a0knowledge of brain health has shaped the way he parents\u2013 from encouraging navigational skills in his children to exposing them to a diverse range of experiences. It seems where the brain is concerned \u2013 if you don\u2019t use it, you lose it! Finally, he draws on his years of experience as a brain surgeon to share some practical tips that can help us all get the best out of our minds.\u00a0\n\nShow notes available at\u00a0https:\/\/drchatterjee.com\/brainsurgeon\n\nFollow me on\u00a0instagram.com\/drchatterjee\/\n\nFollow me on\u00a0facebook.com\/DrChatterjee\/\n\nFollow me on\u00a0twitter.com\/drchatterjeeuk\n\nDISCLAIMER: The content in the podcast and on this webpage is not intended to constitute or be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

We have, over the last few years, become completely inundated with cannabis products across the shelves of wellness and health stores. Online blogs claim miracle cures from everything you could think of. Sleep, anxiety, cancer, AI conditions, eczema, acne, libido. As a doctor I\u2019m asked about this from patients a lot, but honestly I\u2019ve had no formal training in the products and up until now I haven\u2019t really looked at much research. So is this an incredible and legitimate supplement with a myriad of uses? Or is this modern day snake oil Well today, I\u2019m speaking with\u00a0Dr Dani Gordon. Dr Dani is a\u00a0double board certified medical doctor, integrative medicine physician, Family medicine doctor and world leading expert in CBD, cannabis medicine.

She also\u00a0developed the first medical cannabis training program for physicians in the UK\u00a0and is a\u00a0consultant for clinical research in cannabinoid medicine\u00a0working with top researchers around the world.\u00a0 Dr Dani Gordon is the perfect person to be speaking to on this subject and we have a fascinating conversation talking about: * Her first interaction with cannabis medicine and plant medicine * The historical use of cannabis as a plant medicine * The types of chemicals found in the cannabis plant * The endocannabinoid system and how cannabis may exert its affects * The risks of using Cannabis * The uses of cannabis in dementia, parkinsons, gut disorders\u00a0 * Tips on how to use cannabis as a wellness product Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and not to be taken as medical advice.

        "text":"Highlights of the BMC Series \u2013 March 2021\n\nWhy do those bagels smell so good? - Vaccinated mother gives birth to baby with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies - The influence of politics on healthcare systems - Does walking through a doorway always make you forget? - Robotic surgery\n\nBMC Chemistry: Why do those bagels smell so good?\n\nHave you ever walked past a baker\u2019s shop and immediately felt hungry thanks to the lovely aroma from freshly baked bread?\u00a0 Smell plays an integral part in how we taste our food; if it smells good, then chances are, it\u2019s going to taste good too. Here, Lasekan et al. looked into how the aroma of the popular bagel changed due to differences in cold fermentation time.\n\n  \u2022 Dough A (control) was allowed to develop for an hour before cooking.\n  \u2022 Dough B was also allowed to develop for an hour initially but was then kneaded and placed in a chiller for 48 hours before cooking.\n  \u2022 Dough C was treated similarly to Dough B, but the chilling time was reduced to 24 hours.\n\nKey aroma-active compounds were collected via solvent assisted flavor evaporation and then characterized by a process called aroma extract dilution analysis.\n\nResults showed all bagels had similar roasty, malty, buttery, baked potato-like, smoky and biscuit-like notes. However, the odor notes in the long, cold fermented bagels were more intense than those produced by the control bagels.\u00a0 These findings provide a basis for more research into the effect of cold fermentation on bakery products in the future.\n\n\nBMC Pediatrics: Vaccinated mother gives birth to baby with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\n\nIt is well established that newborn babies can be protected from a number of potentially fatal viruses, such as tetanus or diphtheria, though the vaccination of their mother during pregnancy; the antibodies are passed from mother to fetus though the placenta.\n\nWith vaccine rollouts now underway in many countries, it would be hoped that a similar protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would occur for babies born to mothers vaccinated against the virus responsible for the disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2)\n\nThis has indeed been shown to be the case, as demonstrated by an exciting new case study presented by pediatricians at Florida Atlantic University. The baby, a healthy baby girl, is the first infant known to have been born to a vaccinated mother with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies detected in her cord blood.\n\n\nBMC Health Services Research:\u00a0 The influence of politics on healthcare systems\n\nIn an age where our healthcare systems are under intense pressure, it is important to look at the services offered and implement change when needed.\u00a0 Clarke and colleagues from the University of Birmingham recently performed a systematic review in order to discover how the use of \u201cpolitical skill\u201d can contribute to changes in health services from both within and across organizations.\n\nThe review involved the analysis of 62 papers published over the last 40 years and from diverse areas of research. \u00a0\u00a0The findings pointed towards political skill certainly having an impact, with changes implemented via five \u201cthematic dimensions\u201d which include performance, awareness, influence, stakeholder engagement and influence on policy processes.\n\n\nBMC Psychology: Does walking through a doorway always make you forget?\n\nHands up everyone who has walked into a room and then forgotten why you were there. Interestingly, this is a well-documented phenomenon called the doorway effect, which literally refers to how memory can be affected by passing through a doorway or other boundary.\u00a0 Research into this effect has demonstrated that people can forget items of recent significance when they pass through a physical boundary (such as walking from one room to another), imagining that they have done so (i.e. metaphysical boundary) or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer.\n\nIn a study recently published in BMC Psychology, a team of researchers from the Queensland Brain Institute (University of Queensland) attempted to replicate the doorway effect with the use of both virtual and physical environments. The team ran four experiments that measured participants hot and false alarm rates to memory probes for items placed in either the same or previous room. Two experiments used highly immersive virtual reality, one used passive video watching and experiment 4 involved physically moving from one room to another.\n\nThe results of these experiments showed that there was, in fact, no significant effect of doorways on a person\u2019s memory. These findings cast doubts on how common the doorway effect actually is and also on the finding of previous studies looking into the phenomenon.\n\n\nBMC Surgery \u2013 Call for papers: Collection on Robotic surgery\n\nIn order to recognize the significant growth and advancement of robotic surgery over the past few decades, BMC Surgery is welcoming original submissions on robotic surgery. The collection will be edited by an international team of Guest Editors. The collection is open for submissions until 1st April 2022.\n\nView the latest posts on the BMC Series blog homepage",

        "text":"Military\/Veteran\u00a0 On online resource designed to connect Veterans, their family members and friends, and other supporters with information, resources, and solutions to issues affecting their lives. The website can be used to discover information and Veteran's stories of recovery tailed to you. In addition to powerful stories, provides information about life experiences you can relate to. You also can explore information about signs, symptoms, and conditions that are related to mental health and well-being.\n\nVeterans Crisis Line: The Veterans Crisis Line connects Veterans in crisis and their families and friends with qualified, caring Department of Veterans Affairs responders through a confidential toll-free hotline, online chat, or text. Veterans and their loved ones can call 1-800-273-8255 and Press 1, chat online, or send a text message to 838255 to receive confidential support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Support for deaf and hard of hearing individuals is available.\n\nQPR for Vets: The core training is QPR Gatekeeper Training for Suicide Prevention customized for those helping vets. It is also specifically designed to help veteran peer counselors to help their fellow veterans. QPR is listed in the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices:\u00a0 This course may be approved for Continuing Education Credits for most professions.\u00a0\n\nVirtual Hope Box: One of the key approaches in treating people who are depressed and thinking about suicide is to help them come up with reasons to go on living. One of the ways that mental health specialists have traditionally done this is to work with their patients to create a \u201chope box\u201d\u2014a collection of various items that remind the patients that their lives are meaningful and worth living. The National Center for Telehealth and Technology has designed a \u201cvirtual hope box,\u201d a smartphone app that allows the patient to keep all those reasons for living close by at all times.\n\n\nCover Me Vets: Cover Me Veterans\u2122 seeks to intervene in the act of suicide by placing a personally relevant and meaningful image on an individual\u2019s firearm.This powerful reminder will strongly encourage the Veteran to\u00a0think twice before ending his or her life. Cover Me Veterans\u2122 will provide service members with the opportunity to have a relevant and meaningful image placed on their firearm\u00a0free of charge.\n\nVA Community Provider Toolkit: Community providers play an essential role in ensuring America\u2019s Veterans receive the support they have earned. The purpose of this toolkit is to link community providers with information and resources that are relevant to Veteran\u2019s health and well-being. This toolkit supports the behavioral health and wellness of Veterans receiving services outside the VA health care system. Resources include information on screening for military service, handouts and trainings to increase knowledge about military culture and mini-clinics focused on relevant aspects of behavioral health and wellness.\n\nServing Veterans: A Resource Guide The SAMHSA-HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions developed this guide for primary and behavioral healthcare professionals serving veterans and their families. All of these resources and more are available from CIHS\u2019 website at\n\nDryhootch\u00a0An organization formed by\u00a0Veterans to insure our newest generation of warriors and their families get the support they deserve. Provides peer support, outreach, legal help, help for families, mobile tools, support groups and more.\n\nBehavioral Health Issues Among Afghanistan and Iraq U.S. War Veterans\u00a0 A brief from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) Summer 2012\n\nWisconsin County Veterans Service Offices and Tribal Veterans Services: The County Veterans Service Officers Asociation of Wisconsin (CVSO) is an organization of professional veterans advocates. In Wisconsin the CVSO plays a critical role in the veteran's advocacy system and is often the initial contact in the community for veteran\u2019s services. The CVSO provides a vital and efficient system of services and advocacy to veterans, their dependents, and survivors.\n\nWisconsin Military Family Assistance Centers:\u00a0 When a loved one is deployed, the entire community of family members, friends and neighbors is affected. The Military Family Assistance Centers (FACs) focus is to provide family members information on entitlements and benefits available to them through referrals for assistance. The FACs were formed to assist families of service members with issues that may arise while the service member is deployed. They provide information sources for a variety of services which the service members and their families may utilize before, during, and following a deployment.",

Caregivers are trained to apply this method in a group activity (\u201cliving-room theatre activity\u201d) for people with dementia in which theatrical stimuli are used in combination with proven emotion-oriented care methods. The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate the added value [\u2026]\n\nThe prevalence of dementia and depression in Taiwanese institutionalized leprosy patients, and the effectiveness evaluation of reminiscence therapy\u2013a longitudinal, single-blind, randomized control study\n\nObjective: This study investigated the prevalence of depression and dementia in long-term institutionalized older leprosy patients in Taiwan. We then examined the effectiveness of reminiscence group therapy on depressive symptoms and cognitive function in this population.; Methods: We recruited 129 long-term institutionalized older leprosy patients in Taiwan and used the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF), [\u2026]\n\nPsychosocial care assistants caring for residents with dementia according to section 87b SGB XI. Emotional and cognitive effects\n\nProblem: Since 2008 nursing homes may receive resources for assistance in additional low threshold psychosocial care for residents with dementia. By now, most institutions make use of this. However, the effects of this additional psychosocial care on the emotional and cognitive state of mind of persons with dementia have not yet been investigated systematically.; Method: [\u2026]\n\nREMCARE: reminiscence groups for people with dementia and their family caregivers \u2013 effectiveness and cost-effectiveness pragmatic multicentre randomised trial\n\nObjectives: The aim of the REMiniscence groups for people with dementia and their family CAREgivers (REMCARE) study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups for people with dementia and their family caregivers as compared with usual care.; Design: A multicentre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms \u2013 an intervention [\u2026]\n\nPreserving Identity and Planning for Advance Care (PIPAC): preliminary outcomes from a patient-centered intervention for individuals with mild dementia\n\nObjectives: The purpose of this pilot study was to conduct limited-efficacy testing of the newly developed Preserving Identity and Planning for Advance Care (PIPAC) intervention on self-reported and proxy-reported emotional and health-related outcomes of individuals in the early stages of dementia.; Method: A two-group comparison design was implemented.

        "text":"Honey in Nutrition\n\nBy William Miller\n\nSummary: An excellent overview of the value of raw honey. Author William Miller compares the nutritional qualities of this extraordinary food, manufactured by bees for millions of years, to those of refined sugar. His conclusion? They\u2019re complete opposites nutritionally, with honey providing vitamins, minerals, and other factors critical for life and white sugar providing nothing more than empty calories. Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research\u00a0reprint 119, 1955. Original source unknown.\n\nArm and Shoulder Pain\n\nBy Dr. George Goodheart\n\nSummary: In this 1960 article, the \u201cfather of Applied Kinesiology,\u201d Dr. George Goodheart, discusses chiropractic manipulations and nutritional support for treating pain in the shoulder area. One of the most common causes of such pain, he explains, is the precipitation of calcium out of the blood and into the tissues in and around the shoulder joint\u2014a condition resulting usually from an overly alkaline state within the body. (For more on pH and health, see Dr. Goodheart\u2019s excellent primer, \u201cThe Acid-Alkaline Balance and Patient Management.\u201d) Other times, Dr. Goodheart says, discomfort in the shoulder is actually referred pain originating from dysfunction in the digestive organs, making nutritional support of the stomach, gallbladder, and liver critical to resolving the issue. Articles like these reveal the holistic understanding of the body\u2019s function\u2014and appreciation of the value of nutritional therapy\u2014that have long distinguished chiropractic care within the healing arts.\u00a0From the\u00a0journal Michigan State Chiropractic Society, 1960. Reprinted by the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research\n\nThe Acid-Alkaline Balance and Patient Management\n\nBy Dr. George Goodheart\n\nSummary: If you\u2019ve read anything at all about nutrition, you\u2019ve likely heard of the importance of proper pH balance in the body. But what is meant by proper, and where in the body should one assess acid-alkaline balance? Blood, urine, saliva, gastric juices, intestinal fluids\u2014each of these has its own ideal pH range varying from highly acidic to highly alkaline. Just how does a nutritionist make sense of pH and apply it practically? That\u2019s the subject of this outstanding primer from 1965 by renowned chiropractor Dr. George Goodheart, who presents some of his clinical observations in balancing pH in patients. While \u201cpH\u201d does ultimately refer to the acid-alkaline balance of an individual\u2019s blood, he says, one can assess that value simply be measuring the pH of the saliva, which mirrors blood pH. (Urine pH, on the other hand, does not reflect the pH of the blood.) And contrary to popular belief, he adds, diet alone is seldom sufficient to alter a person\u2019s pH, which is far more dependent on the functioning of the endocrine system and the ability of the body to digest fats than it is on the foods the individual is eating. Dr. Goodheart discusses both chiropractic and nutritional means of addressing these issues while presenting some of the classic symptoms of hyperalkalinity\u2014such as allergies, insomnia, and arthritic pain\u2014as well as those of hyperacidity, including breathlessness, dry skin, and hard stool. By addressing endocrine imbalances and poor fat digestion in the patient, he says, these often mystifying symptoms can be readily resolved. From the Digest of Chiropractic Economics,\u00a01965. Reprinted by the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research\n\nAcidophilus Yeast\n\nBy Dr. Royal Lee\n\nSummary:\u00a0In this primer on the benefits of lactic acid to digestion, Dr. Royal Lee explains the science behind his remarkable bowel-normalizing product Acidophilus Yeast (known today as Lactic Acid Yeast), which has the special distinction of being able to convert any dietary carbohydrate into lactic acid within the colon. Not only does this action acidify the bowel, thus killing potentially dangerous microorganisms and promoting balanced gut flora, but the yeast also releases enzymes that aid digestion, and it provides bulk to stool\u2014all of which help ensure proper bowel function. Dr. Lee backs up his comments by presenting a clinical study showing Acidophilus Yeast\u2019s impressive results in combating constipation, the researchers stating unequivocally the chief reason for the yeast\u2019s effectiveness: \u201cIt has been demonstrated time and time again that the stools of patients who are constipated are, in a very large majority, alkaline\u2026The lactic acid acts as a stabilizer of the hydrogen ion concentration in the colon.\u201d With many alternative health\u00a0practitioners\u00a0today promoting indiscriminate alkalization of the body, the words of these investigators are well worth remembering. Published by Vitamin Products Company, circa 1940.\n\nGuideposts to Mental Health\n\nBy Dr. Royal Lee\n\nSummary: Dr. Lee addresses some possible nutritional causes of mental distress. People who eat too many acidifying foods, such as whole grains, may become overly acidic, marked by symptoms of irritability, introversion, and the feeling of not getting enough air. People who eat too many alkalizing foods, such as green vegetables, on the other hand, may feel aches in their joints or a nervous stomach. Dr. Lee also quotes Dr. Benjamin Sandler\u2018s description of people who suffer from drastic swings in blood sugar: \u201cDizziness, faintness, nervousness, tremors, sweating, pallor, flushing, palpitation, tachycardia (rapid heart), abdominal pain, and psychoneurotic manifestations may occur,\u201d Sandler says. To combat such sugar swings, Lee recommends\u2014in words that speak to any nutrition practitioner today\u2014to \u201cavoid refined sugars as found in doughnuts, pies, cakes, ice cream, candy and other forms of sweets.\u201d From Let\u2019s Live magazine, 1958.\n\nGuanidine, Cider Vinegar, and Health\n\nBy Dr. Royal Lee\n\nSummary: Dr. Royal Lee lauds Vermont physician Dr. D.C. Jarvis, author of the classic book on holistic health\u00a0Folk Medicine. In particular, Lee praises Jarvis\u2019s recommendation of apple cider vinegar as a natural remedy for a host of disorders, from guanidine toxicity as a result of the overconsumption of meat to a dysbiotic gut to constipation to low thyroid to overweight. (Two teaspoons of cider vinegar in\u00a0a glass of water at each meal dependably effected gradual weight loss, Dr. Jarvis observed.)\u00a0Dr. Lee discussing Dr. Jarvis is a must for any fan of nutrition, history, or both. From Let\u2019s Live magazine, 1958.\n\nThe Dietary Regimen in the Treatment of Renal Calculi\n\nBy Charles C. Higgins, MD\n\nSummary: Excerpts from a review of studies investigating the connection between vitamin A deficiency and renal calculi, or kidney stones. This is one of the earliest tracts showing the critical role of vitamin A in the health of the kidneys. Although pH is discussed, the main thrust of the report concerns studies\u2014conducted in the U.S., Africa, China, and other parts of Asia\u2014all reaching the conclusion that vitamin A deficiency leads to renal calculi and lesions. From The Journal-Lancet, 1938. Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research reprint 5.\u00a0\n\nStudies of a New Type of Yeast in Chronic Constipation\n\nBy Chester H. Lyon and James P. Hart\n\nSummary:\u00a0Perhaps the first published study of a probiotic supplement for the treatment of constipation and related bowel disorders. The researchers fed their subjects a special mycelium-type of yeast\u2014developed by Dr. Royal Lee and known today as Lactic Acid Yeast\u2014that converts carbohydrate foods into lactic acid in the colon. (The normal pH of the colon is acidic; this promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria.) Unlike lactobacillus-type bacteria, which can convert only lactose into lactic acid, Lactic Acid Yeast is able to convert any carbohydrate source into lactic acid. This efficient conversion restored the lower bowel to its normal pH and function and provided improvement in every parameter that was studied. Clinical Osteopathy,\u00a01940. Reprint by the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research.\u00a0\n\nAcid-Base Balance of Diets That Produce Immunity to Dental Caries Among the South Sea Islanders and Other Primitive Races\n\nBy Dr. Weston A. Price\u00a0\n\nSummary: The notion of \u201calkalizing\u201d one\u2019s diet\u2014or eating foods that supposedly increase the pH within the body and thus optimize health\u2014has been around as long as the science of nutrition itself. In this 1935 article, famed dentist and nutrition pioneer Dr. Weston A. Price debunks the hypothesis that an alkalizing diet helps prevent tooth decay. Citing data from his famous worldwide study of populations free of dental disease and other degenerative illness, Dr. Price states,\u00a0\u201cIn no instance have I found the change from a high immunity to dental caries [cavities] to a high susceptibility\u2026to be associated with a change from a diet with a high potential alkalinity to a high potential acidity.\u201d In fact, he adds, his data show, if anything, that good tooth health is the result of an acidifying diet.\u00a0Dr. Price further discounts the notion that an alkalizing diet promotes health in general and instead stresses the importance of eating whole foods rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly the\u00a0fat-soluble\u00a0vitamins so abundant in animal foods.

The roles of carbamide (a.k.a. urea) in denaturing proteins\u2014and thus reducing their antigenicity\u2014and of vitamin F (fatty acid complex) in defusing calcium bicarbonate (ionized calcium) into the cell fluids are virtually lost on orthodox medicine. Yet holistic doctors have repeatedly discovered this article since its publication in 1946 and been amazed at the clinical efficacy of the applied knowledge it presents.
