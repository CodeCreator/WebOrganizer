Not ever. Sorry.\n\nAbout fan mail: \u00a0\n\nBarbara loves reading letters from readers. Fan mail has given her a long list of reasons to keep writing books. Because of the volume, however, she regrets that she can\u2019t write individual responses. If you have a particular question you may find the answer elsewhere on this website (see FAQs). Because of the quantity of communications, in an office staffed by one full-time human, we don\u2019t encourage emails or telephone calls.",

He's, what, eight years old? And adorable. I wanted to hug him and tell him everything was okay.\n\nI love that Greyback has that level of compassion, for Teddy and Remus. Which is why I imagine this to be before he became the evil person we see him as in Harry's eyes. But after hearing all those stories, I'd have thought Teddy wouldn't be so friendly with him, even if he was a great actor. He wouldn't be able to keep everything from him, if he had hated him. So it's interesting to know what he's been told.\n\nHow does Greyback know his name?\n\nI can't wait for the next chapter, Mike.\n\n\nYour Name:\nReason for this Report:\n\n  \u2022 The review is offensive.\n  \u2022 The review is spam or chit-chat (not actually a review).\n  \u2022 The review was double posted.\n  \u2022 The review has formatting problems.\nRepeat the number: 994\nSubmit Report:",
