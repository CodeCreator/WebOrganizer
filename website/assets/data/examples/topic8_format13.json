        "text":"Singapore, Singapore, June 28, 2017 \u2013(\u2013 Ageing takes its toll in the form of sagging jowls and wrinkles. Bucking this gloomy forecast, the cosmetic surgical industry has constantly innovated with newer and more effective techniques to keep faces youthful and supple. Advancements in cosmetic procedures mean you can now have a nip and tuck and show off the results within a week with no bandages in sight.\n\nAmong the plethora of anti-ageing treatments, the latest one taking the cosmetic industry by storm is the thread-lift, which experts say can help women beat wrinkles and jowls single-handedly without going under the knife. Earning its nickname from the use of strings, or threads, to lift, sculpt and shape the cheeks and lower face, the thread-lift is proving popular with women in their 30s seeking to reduce the first signs of ageing. So what exactly is the draw of giving your face the \u2018thread-lifting\u2019 treatment? That would be the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s scalpel-free, has a lower downtime and is relatively low-cost compared with other, more invasive treatments, but comes with a bigger payoff of greater lifting capacity compared to lasers and creams.\n\nLatest iterations such as Infinity InstaLift, launched by The Sloane Clinic\u2122 provide even more appreciable lifting effect, with two additional significant upgrades: It stays in place better thanks to additional hooks, and the threads (previously tricky to remove if anything went awry) dissolve in seven months, with benefits lasting up to two years. Plus, studies have found that by repositioning skin, these special dissolvable threads spur collagen growth in adjacent tissue. Newer versions allow a myriad of lifting, face contouring and even nose shaping benefits as they come in a variety of different lengths and thickness to suit specific facial areas. Extra-thick versions, like the new Infinity V-Lift performed by thread-lift expert Dr Kenneth Lee, create a more dramatic lift. \u201cThe initial result is immediate, unlike lasers, which require patience,\u201d says Dr Lee, who believes that threads can deliver, in just 30 minutes, 70 percent of the lift of a surgical facelift without the months of healing.\n\nHow does Infinity InstaLift work?\nAs skin loses suppleness and elasticity with age, this manifests as sagging skin, loss of facial definition and more pronounced facial lines. Infinity InstaLift created by The Sloane Clinic, utilizes specialized and intelligently designed dissolvable threads injected into specific areas of the face to reverse these signs of ageing by amplifying the skin\u2019s natural stores of collagen over the next few months. These biodegradable threads establish a scaffolding to support weakened tissues simultaneously lifting them to sculpt or redefine blunted facial features and reposition the skin for a natural, youthful and V-shape visage while forming a matrix for future collagen growth.\n\nThis multifaceted technique extends through a myriad of procedures including:\n\n(1) Infinity V Lift, best for contouring and defining lower face and jawline;\n\n(2) Infinity Rejuvenation, excellent for weakened areas such as nasolabial folds, nasojugal lines and other wrinkles or sunken areas on face using Infinity M threads which stimulate collagen production;\n\n(3) Infinity Brow and Forehead Lift, great for elevating and repositioning brows to a more elevated optimal position;\n\n(4) Infinity Nose Lift, to achieve a instant height and definition to nose shape using Infinity R threads and;\n\n(5) Infinity Neck Lift, ideal for tightening double chin and other loose skin around the neck area to give a visibly tighter jaw and neckline.\n\nInfinity Instalift is performed comfortably under local anaesthesia in under an hour. While some minor swelling or bruising may occasionally be experienced as can be expected from similar injection procedures, there is no need for long recovery time as patients can wear makeup and return to normal activities immediately after. The greatest draw of Infinity InstaLift lies in the fact that patients can see immediate visible results, which over the next year, continue to improve as their skin produces its own collagen matrix to supplement the thread-lift scaffold created. Results can last anywhere from 12 -18 months depending on the individual\u2019s ageing process and body\u2019s response to the threads.\n\nFor enhanced results, Infinity Instalift may also be combined with other aesthetic procedures such as Botox, Natural Fillers, Ultherapy or skin resurfacing lasers.\n\nThe Sloane Clinic\u2122\nThe Sloane Clinic\u2122 is a leading chain of medical aesthetic clinics in Singapore and Malaysia providing advanced aesthetic dermatology and cosmetic solutions. Managed by a strong diverse team of top doctors in the medical field, its efforts in championing innovation and adopting cutting-edge technology reward with the latest creation of a non-surgical facelift technique \u2013 Infinity InstaLift. Cleverly designed to lift ageing faces sans scalpel, Infinity InstaLift restores youth and defines facial features without the risks, costs, lengthy recovery time and possible scarring associated with traditional facelift surgery.\n\nInfinity Instalift is available at The Sloane Clinic branches from S$1926. Price is inclusive of prevailing GST.\n\nContact Information:\nThe Sloane Clinic\nMelody Qwek\n+65 6222 3728\nContact via Email\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nPress Release Distributed by",

Rather than indulge in retail therapy by hitting the January sales, why not join Hubbub for a series of exciting clothing swaps and refashion events in north London this January, which may be just the thing to put a smile on your face.\n\nWe\u2019ve teamed up with North London Waste Authority (NLWA) to show you how you can refresh your wardrobe through acquiring new skills, not new stuff. Our community-centred workshops won\u2019t leave you penniless and you\u2019ll come away with something new, created from an old cast-off or from something lingering in the back of your wardrobe.\n\nWe\u2019ve selected a real variety of workshops offering something to suit everyone; whether you\u2019re a teenager who wants to re-invent a denim jacket, a bloke who wants to repair his own jeans or a woman who wants to restyle a party frock. The workshops will be an opportunity to meet new people, learn new skills and refresh your wardrobe \u2013 the perfect way to beat the January blues!\n\nAlongside the workshops will be a series of free clothes swapping events will be hosted by swishing experts Rags Revival, who will help you pick out something beautiful. It\u2019s also a chance to rid your wardrobe of the clothes you no longer wear or have never worn, whilst ensuring they don\u2019t go to waste.\n\nThe recent TV series Hugh\u2019s War on Waste revealed that here in the UK we throw away a staggering 7 tonnes of clothing every 10 minutes. However, looking after your clothes for 9 months longer than usual will reduce each item\u2019s carbon, waste and water footprint by 20-30%, according to WRAP. Our message is simple, don\u2019t reject your unwanted clothes #refashion them!\n\nOur 14 #refashion events take place during the last two weekends of January in Enfield, Haringey, Barnet, Islington, Camden, Hackney and Waltham Forest. Join us for a celebration of clothing and new skills.\n\nBook\u00a0your tickets NOW to avoid disappointment.",

It is one of the 5 senses, allowing us to feel free in the surface. Unfortunately nowadays almost every second inhabitant of the Earth has vision problems. The most common are myopia (when the person does not see well in distance), and hyperopia (when the person does not see well close items). Utilization of computers, TVsets, and smartphones, the habit of reading in transport, all this can have adverse effect on our sight. Even those, having perfect vision from birth cannot be safe from sight deterioration when getting older.\n\nAs our vision changes with time, it is very important to start taking care of eye health as early as possible. Fortunately, ophthalmologists keep saying that many eye diseases can be prevented, or stopped at early stages with timely diagnostics.\n\nToday the glasses are the most common way to correct the sight. Properly selected glasses allow to achieve maximum vision sharpness, and stop it deterioration. It is important for the glasses to provide full correction of sight, such as in accordance to many studies only in this case the muscular system of the eye will be fully working, and will not cause eye tiredness and headaches.\n\nApart of the eye health assistance the glasses has also became the element of style and the way to express one self. Fashionable glass frames help to create modern looks, and became part of the wardrobe for all fashionistas.\n\nDelivery World regularly delivers luxury quality glasses often with precious stones from different parts of the world; Italy, France, China, USA, and Germany are leading in the number of such cargos.

Please join us on January 25-27, 2013, when Little White Dress Bridal Shop will be hosting a gown-only Anne Barge Trunk Show - this time featuring all the brand new gowns from Anne Barge's 2013 collection. Little White Dress Bridal Shop, a\u00a0Denver bridal boutique, is the only place in Colorado you'll find these delectable Anne Barge gowns.\n\nTo get you excited for her newest works of art, I'd like to share some of the features you'll see throughout her 2013 bridal gown collection:\n\nFrench influence. Anne says on her blog that she was looking to capture the \"magical feeling of being in Paris\" when she designed her gowns and when she created her runway show at NY Bridal Market this past October. In fact, she says the Ritz Paris was the inspiration for her collection. You'll see French lace pieces, hand stamped silk organza and the abundance of removable over-skirts. The dresses in her collection also have French names such as Aimee, Simone, Celeste and Madeleine.\n\nVaried necklines: \u00a0Anne's 2013 collection offers many variations of necklines (other than strapless gowns), which compliment a variety of women's decolletage. You'll see asymmetrical necklines, as well as jewel, square, and scoop necklines too.\n\nVintage meets modern. While remaining true to her timeless modern looks, Anne has seamlessly incorporated vintage details into this year's bridal gown collection. The collection features sensual fabrics that remind us of the 1920's and 30's.\n\nHere are a few of our favorite gowns that you'll be able to try on during our Anne Barge Gown-Only Trunk Show, January 25-27, 2013. Please call 303-814-8972 to make an appointment.\n\nAnne Barge Zoe (2013 collection)\n\nsimone f\n\ngabrielle f\n\ndelphine f\n\ncosette f\n\n\nceleste f\n\nbrigitte f\n\naimee f\n\nadrienne f",

        "text":"The Simple Life! #puravida\n\nTake a journey inside Pura Vida. Pura Vida means a simple life or pure life, and is the basic foundation of Palabra clothing brand. \u00a0Palabra is a group of eco-friendly, environmentally conscious, and socially responsible creatives who believe in minimal design and sustainable textiles. \u00a0We choose minimal designs because less is more here at Palabra where we let our phrases speak for themselves.\n\n\u00a0Our ethically sourced fashion tees and eco-friendly bags convey statements such as courage, perhaps, verdad, self-love, super-powers, curious, and cuida la tierra. These simple messages work to show how we think and feel. As we celebrate the planet this April, it is important to take care of the land, sea and our air while spreading awareness about making conscious decisions to protect our planet and communities.\n\n\u00a0Palabra is more than a premium clothing brand. We really do try to practice Pura Vida and our goal is to make effective change in protecting the planet by using our brand as a platform to inform and spread the word. Each of our vegan cool t-shirts and uni-sex bags are made from organic cotton, bamboo, hemp, and recycled plastic bottles. The power of Palabra goes a long way as we execute Pura Vida. \u00a0In using sustainable textiles and keeping our designs simple, we do our part to protect the planet and create super-soft, durable, and comfortable quality clothing.\n\nAt times the simple life is difficult to achieve as we are constantly told that \u201cmore\u201d brings happiness and success, but simplicity is best. When we need a break from daily digital overloads we can explore our beautiful planet\u2019s tranquility, beauty and stillness. Natural beauty in its simplest form can be found in our own backyards, and nearby parks, and beaches. Spend a few moments looking up at the sky, watching the waves on the beach or hiking through forests and canyons. The result will be pure inspiration and simple relaxation. \u00a0That is Pura Vida",
