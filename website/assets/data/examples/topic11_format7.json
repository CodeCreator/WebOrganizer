        "text":"What are some historical facts about Mancala?\n\n\nQuick Answer\n\nThe game of Mancala is believed to have originated in Africa. The earliest games were played by scooping holes from the earth and using pebbles or seashells as the moving pieces. Over time, game boards were created, and made of wood, clay or gold.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nFull Answer\n\nThe term \"Mancala\" is Arabic, meaning \"game of transferring.\" It is the only ancient game with an Arabic name that is still in existence, which hints that the game either originated in Arabia or existed around that part of the world for thousands of years. Since the creation of the game, several versions have developed over time.\n\nCountries with diverse versions of the game include India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. There are many variations of game play, which has resulted in several different names due to its popularity among African tribes. Examples of African names include Wari, Ware, Walle, Awari, Aware and Awaoley. Wari is considered the most popular form of Mancala worldwide.\n\nThough many cultures play this game for recreational purposes, some regions associate Mancala with religion. In the West Indies, for example, the game was played in a house while mourning a death, since it was thought that the spirit of the deceased found amusement in watching until the burial of his body.\n\nLearn more about Board Games\n\nRelated Questions",

        "text":"From Grand Theft Wiki\nRevision as of 06:45, 20 November 2012 by ZS (Talk | contribs)\n\n(diff) \u2190 Older revision | Latest revision (diff) | Newer revision \u2192 (diff)\nJump to: navigation, search\nFor the mission in GTA 1, see Tanker (mission).\nA Tanker in its original appearance in GTA 1.\nA Tanker in its original appearance in GTA 1.\nAppearance(s) GTA 1\nGTA London 1969\nGTA San Andreas\nGTA Chinatown Wars\nVehicle type Commercial\/Industrial truck\nBody style Tanker truck (GTA 1, GTA:L69, GTA:CW)\nSemi-cab trailer (GTA:SA)\n\nThe Tanker is a large tanker truck that has appeared in Grand Theft Auto 1, Grand Theft Auto: London 1969, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars.\n\n\nThe Tanker in GTA 1 is designed as a straight truck with a cab-over design and a tanker load. It is one of the most durable vehicles in the game, being able to withstand a lot of damage. Despite it being a large truck, the Tank is able to drive over it.\n\nThe Tanker in GTA London 1969 is designed as a generic British lorry of the 1960s. It bears a logo that resembles the former badge of British Petroleum.\n\nIn GTA San Andreas, the Tanker appeared with a semi-cab design. It is one of the more popular of the three trucks in San Andreas, being encountered more than any of the others (the Roadtrain and the Linerunner), and is generally designed as a mid-sized semi truck smaller than the Roadtrain but larger than the Linerunner. Finally, this truck, like all the others can attach a trailer in San Andreas, making the experience even better. It looks loosely based on a Mack R series, but more closely resembles the Peterbilt Model 379. Like the GTA San Andreas rendition, the Tanker in GTA Chinatown Wars is designed as a conventional cab semi-trailer truck, but is only available with a permanently attached tanker trailer.\n\n\nSurprisingly, the Tanker in GTA 1 has the highest top speed - if driven on a straight road, for long enough, it will keep picking up momentum - much like the Bus and Coach.\n\nAfter an examination of internal files, it is clearly shown that the Tanker in GTA San Andreas is the slowest of all three but it has better acceleration than the Linerunner. In-game gameplay, however, has the truck performing better than the Linerunner, with an unusually better top speed of about 130 km\/h (80 mph), as well as superior acceleration and hill climbing power. Its lower body height also makes it less vulnerable to rollovers than the Linerunner.\n\nIn GTA Chinatown Wars, the Tanker's long length and large weight makes the vehicle less than suitable for intensive driving, faring poorly in top speed and acceleration, as well as poor cornering (often requiring a large turning radius) and braking. An interesting new feature is the ability for the trailer to leak fuel, introduced to the player in the mission Trail Blazer. If the end of the vehicle is shot, a line of flaming fuel will spout from the trailer, setting alight any other vehicle the player drives past. Over time, the flame gets closer to the trailer, though the player can gain themselves more time by driving quickly. If the flame reaches the end of the trailer, the trailer itself is set on fire, and after a short while it will blow up dramatically, usually killing the player and harming anyone else near the vehicle.\n\n\n  \u2022 In GTA San Andreas, the game's internal files refer to the Tanker as \"petrol\".\n  \u2022 In GTA San Andreas, the default radio station in the Tanker is K-DST; in the DS version of GTA Chinatown Wars, it's Prairie Cartel.\n\n\nGTA San Andreas\nGTA Chinatown Wars\n\nSee also",

        "text":"\n\nQuest for Glory 4 \u00bd: So You Thought You Were a Hero is a game created using Adventure Game Studio and uses the same interface as the later Sierra adventures. The game has strong language, extreme violence, sexual situations and other things unlike most Sierra games. The game is essentially a parody of the first game of the series. It satirizes the situations that the player found himself in, in the original games. The game is noted for being incredibly buggy.\n\n\nAll is not well in the valley of Spielburg. Elsa has disappeared (again) and the sheriff has been murdered. The rest of the valley is in chaos and the influx of heroes has done little to calm the valley. Your job is not done. It's time to go back to Spielburg...\n\n\n  \u2022 Sir Richard\n  \u2022 Merv\n  \u2022 Red\n  \u2022 Betty\n  \u2022 Linda\n  \u2022 Larry\n  \u2022 Cletus\n  \u2022 Bill\n  \u2022 Bruno\n  \u2022 Clive\n  \u2022 Green Meep\n  \u2022 Rogue\n  \u2022 Bella\n  \u2022 Bagi\n  \u2022 Stan (giant)\n  \u2022 Brauggi (frost giant)\n  \u2022 Jim (treasure hunter)\n  \u2022 Bones (Bonehead)\n  \u2022 Cleo Williams\n  \u2022 Erik the Retired\n  \u2022 Brothers Jurgensen\n  \u2022 Mark Peterson\n  \u2022 Mr. O'Conner\n  \u2022 Patrick R. Hambroni the Third (Cro-Magnon leader)\n  \u2022 Walter Burnton, Throg, William Fitzpatrick (Cro-Magnon)\n  \u2022 Al\n  \u2022 Witch\n  \u2022 Rogue\n  \u2022 Slider\n  \u2022 Pirate Captain\n  \u2022 Priest\n  \u2022 Dryad (druid)\n  \u2022 Gargoyle\n  \u2022 Elsa Von Spielburg\n  \u2022 Bernard Von Spielburg\n  \u2022 Henry the Hermit\n  \u2022 Erasmus (unofficial)\n  \u2022 Fenrus (unofficial)\n  \u2022 Butch Beefmeister\n  \u2022 Hilde\n  \u2022 Mrs. Beefmeister\n  \u2022 Coyote Ugly bartender\n  \u2022 Crusher\n  \u2022 Otto Von Goon\n  \u2022 Hippy\n  \u2022 Band Leader\n  \u2022 Amelia Appleberry\n\n...and many assorted cameos from QFG1.\n\n\n\nThe most graphic scene in QFG4 \u00bd (even PC Gamer dared to show)\n\n  \u2022 The game includes limited nudity, language and crude humor. Many jokes are sexual or scatalogical in nature. The game includes a whore house, as well as several female characters who will have intercourse with the player character (including a returning character from QFG1). Only one of these sex scenes is actually shown on screen. In other cases the game only shows the photographs of real women stripping down (frontal nudity). Think Leisure Suit Larry style humor (in at least one instance the game actually refers to Leisure Suit Larry during one of these 'encounters'). They also parody the character 'flirtation' that occurs in most of the QFG games (Hilde, Dinarzad, Janna Jamil, Katrina, Budar, Nawar, Elsa, Erana). These encounters are optional to winning the game however (and only one sex scene actually appears on screen in an exaggerated 'Leisure Suit Larry' kinda of way).\n  \u2022 Quite a bit of the game is a parody on Quest for Glory and other Sierra games. The loading screen parodies the piracy warning screens in the original Quest for Glory 1 VGA. Multiple characters break the fourth wall referring to the the game as a game, and the rest of the series as games. A picture in the Adventurer's Guild is the hero in EGA, and the hero can hardly believe he used to look that way. Another example is Erasmus mentions that the Hero will soon be traveling to Silmaria where he'll have to deal with the new universe of 3-D.\n  \u2022 Many of the games assets are ripped from other Sierra games such as the King's Quest series (KQ5 and KQ6) and Conquests of the Longbow. Other assets are ripped from other games such as the Secret of Monkey Island series or other sources.\n  \u2022 Bernard von Spielburg is the new Baron of Spielburg (as mentioned in QFGV). However he is captured by the pirates at the end. Elsa becomes the Baroness in the mean time, but the game mentions that she will be seen again in QFGV (hinting of her loss of power to her brother).\n  \u2022 Strangely Bruno is \"hung for 15 minutes on a short rope\" in this game, but he gets better in time for QFGV.\n  \u2022 It's possible to earn 515 points out of 500.\n  \u2022 The game's internal timeline neither follows the Mordavia History of Events nor does it follow the tetralogy timeline. There are several references within the game relating to the passage of time. The game takes place \"sometime between QFG4 and QFG5\". The game takes place in '02, 10 years after the Hero had graduated from the FACS in '92 (in the official published material this was about a month before QFG1). Hilde mentions that the last time she saw the hero, she promised the hero a date \"in a year\" and that she's is now ready to keep that promise. This could imply that the game takes place about a year after the first game. However, Sir Richard claims that the hero made a mess of Spielburg years ago, implying that several years have passed between QFG1 and QFG4\u00bd (10 years if the reunion is any indication). Another guard in Spielburg castle also mentions the Hero's actions occured years before. A bulletin board asks for an exorcist with a minimum of 3 years experience (perhaps a nod to the hero going on adventures for three or more years between QFG1 and QFG4\u00bd). It takes the Hero a week to reach Spielburg from the the moment he left the Correspondence School Reunion. Baron Stefan von Spielburg death, Heinrich Pferdefedern death and Elsa von Spielburg disappearance occured the previous Spring about one year before the game.\n\n\nThis game has mixed fan response, some either enjoy it and others dislike it.\n\n  \u2022 Infamous Adventures (King's Quest III VGA, Space Quest II VGA) has been asked if they made the game, to which they replied in their general FAQ; \" No. But for kudos to them, it is a very funny game.\"[1][2]\n  \u2022 The Quest for Glory fansite, Quest for More Glory, does not permit any discussion on the topic of this game except within two specific threads.[3][4] They enacted an actual policy, in June 2010, regarding the game's discussion. Previous to the enactment of this rule, posts by forum members were deleted or entirely edited, and members were given warnings against mentioning the game (and were threatened with bans for repeat offenses).[5] As of July 4, 2012, the administrator of Quest for More Glory reversed her policy allowing discussion of the game, reinstating the old policy of banning anyone for the slightest mention of the game.[6] [7][8]\n  \u2022 Hero-U forums and Corey Cole allows discussions of this game but has reasonable criticisms about it as well. He considers some of the humor to be malicious and questions the teams ripping sprites from Quest for Glory and other games (a practice many early Sierra fan game developers committed).[9]\n  \u2022 PC gamer discussed this game in a Saturday Crapshoot article (which includes the risqu\u00e9 Centaur photo above)![10]\n\nTechnical IssuesEdit\n\nThis game is buggy. The dos version will not usually work in Dos Box, VDM Sound or other dos emulators. The only way to play the game on modern computers is use the rare windows version.\n\nThe rare Windows version will not install on modern computers without creating a workaround. To get the windows version to work, create a shortcut to QFG4.EXE, and add the line \"--setup\" at the end of the shortcut's Target field. This will load up the graphics and sound setup window. On modern machines switch the graphics to 640 x 480. For best results play in full screen mode. Once you have changed the settings then you can use the QFG4.EXE to enter the game.\n\nExternal LinksEdit\n\n\n  1. [1]\n  2. QFG4 1\/2 discussion\n  3.

Hosted by Mojang, Realms provides an easy and fast way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without prior knowledge of the concepts for hosting on the Internet. Realms also allows players to choose from a list of minigames (updated by Mojang approximately every 2 weeks) to play temporarily, as well as several pre-made world templates, adventure maps, and experiences. Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server.[3]\n\nRequirements[edit | edit source]\n\nRealms is a service that can only be used by players that meet these requirements[4]:\n\nSubscriptions[edit | edit source]\n\nThe subscription screen in-game, accessed through the Configuration menu.\nManage your Realms subscriptions here.\n\nRealms is a subscription-based service.

Auto-renew subscriptions automatically renew the Realms subscription every 30 days without you having to do a thing (this can be canceled). Manual-renew subscriptions need to be renewed manually and come in 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day packages for PC\/Mac, as well as two-friend and ten-friend packages for Pocket.[5][6]\n\nAll players are able to have a 30-day free Realms trial, providing they have not had a free trial on their Mojang account before.[7]\n\nUsing Realms[edit | edit source]\n\nMaps & templates[edit | edit source]\n\nWithin the Realms service, users can elect to temporarily replace their regular world with a Minigame or permanently replace their regular world with maps from the categories: World templates, Adventures, Experiences, or Inspiration. You also cannot use most of the commands or options while your realm is using a preset minigame. These maps are selected from community submissions by the Realms team.

It is acquired by selecting it if Shepard is a Soldier or Infiltrator. Only Shepard and\/or Legion are able to use it. Weighing in at 39 kilograms, the Widow Anti-Material Rifle is primarily used by sniper teams in assault missions against armored vehicles or krogan. While kinetic barriers offer effective protection on vehicles, the kind generated by conventional military field generators are far too weak against the Widow. The Widow was never designed to be carried and fired by a human. Although this modified model can be carried, no ordinary human could fire it without shattering an arm.\n\nFound on Thessia during main quest, about halfway through the mission. Its weight is identical to that of the Javelin and Black Widow. It does the highest damage of all the sniper rifles.\n\nIts other properties are very similar to the Black Widow, except the M-98 Widow can only fire one shot per thermal clip; like the Black Widow, it is also capable of double kills. Due to the relatively late acquisition of this rifle, coupled with the fact that the Javelin (acquired slightly earlier) almost matches it for damage while also being able to fire through cover, this rifle is a relatively poor choice for a primary weapon.\n\nWhat Links Here\n\nSniper Rifles | Trailer Analysis | Javelin\n\nFrom Around The Web\nblog comments powered by Disqus\nDownload PDF\n\nTop Wiki Contributors\n\nEdits: 4,662\nEdits: 857\nEdits: 841\nEdits: 787\nSee All Top Contributors \u00bb\nWiki Help\n\nNeed assistance with editing this wiki?\nCheck out these resources:\n\nExpand Navigation",

In Shanghai, the player removes both free tiles of a matching pair until all 144 tiles are gone. The challenge comes from devising a strategy to free up tiles so they can be removed from the stack. After winning a game, different versions present the player with a reward. For example, in many versions, the tiles reveal the three-dimensional blinking eye of a dragon behind the game screen.\n\nThe first commercial version of Shanghai was developed by Brodie Lockhart and published by Activision in 1986 for several popular American and European home computers. As its popularity grew it was ported to several different home consoles and hand held gaming systems. Though developed by a number of different companies, Japanese ports were primarily handled by Sunsoft, including a version developed for the arcade in 1988. It should be noted, however, that not all versions were released in all markets.\n\nThe initial home computer versions were published in the United States and Europe. The Atari 8-bit conversion of the game was released exclusively in Germany, one of the last regions where the platform was still commercially successful. Published by Hudson Soft as a launch title, Shanghai was released for the PC Engine exclusively in Japan. The Famicom version, developed by SunSoft, was also exclusively sold in Japan. The arcade game the SunSoft developed was not marketed outside of Japan.\n\n\nShanghai is a solitaire matching game that uses a set of tiles rather than cards. The tiles come from the four-player game popular in East Asia known as Mahjong (to which the game is sometimes erroneously referred). The 144 tiles are arranged in a special four-layer pattern with their faces upwards. A tile is said to be open or exposed if it can be moved either left or right without disturbing other tiles. The goal is to match open pairs of identical tiles and remove them from the board, exposing the tiles under them for play. The game is finished when all pairs of tiles have been removed from the board or when there are no exposed pairs remaining.\n\nTiles that are below other tiles cannot be seen. Sometimes, tiles are only partially covered by other tiles, and the extent to which such tiles can be distinguished depends on the actual tile set. Using the default layout of 'the turtle', it is not possible to solve every game. Roughly 3% of all games cannot be solved even if peeking is considered. Players should open up new tiles with every pair they eliminate. Choosing obvious pairs from the top levels will often end the game prematurely (i.e. lose) by leaving essential tiles under cover.\n\nSome versions of Shanghai allow the player to change the tile set and patterns from the traditional tiles to flowers, jewels or other items that may be easier to match up at a glance. Some versions offer a time limit, including the arcade game in which a time limit is imposed. They also offer hints\/cheat options such as the ability to have a match found for the player or to backtrack and undo already made moves. Additionally, most implementations of the game arrange the tiles in such a way that the game is solvable in at least one way. Sequel revisions of the game allow player to try a series of different layouts with varying levels of difficulty (usually given Chinese names such as 'the ox' or 'the snake')\n\n\nControl Action\nArcade-Button-Joystick.png Moves the cursor\nAtari-Switch-Button.png Selects tiles, options\nStart button Begin a game, or summon menu\n\nThe object of the Mahjong solitaire board game is to match and remove alike tiles and get rid of the entire stack of five layers. To removing a tile it must be:\n\n  \u2022 Free: No other tile is lying above or is partially covering it and no other tile is lying to the left and to the right of it. In other words, one side must be free for the tile to be removed.\n  \u2022 Pairs: One must remove the tiles in pairs. Two tiles are identical if they possess the same face pattern. Other pairs include flower and season tiles. Any of these tiles can be matched up with another.\n\nIn most variations, the order of operations to remove tiles is to:\n\n  1. Point to the first tile of the desired pair and press the button to highlight it.\n  2. Point to the second tile of the desired pair and press the button to highlight it.\n  3. When you are sure that you would like to remove the highlighted pair of tiles, press the button a third time.\n\nIf you decide to cancel or change the first tile that you selected, you must unhighlight the original tile by pointing to it and pressing the button a second time.\n\n\nGame screen. The dragon tiles are drawn as: Green Dragon, the rightmost tile of the bottom column; White Dragon, the third leftmost tile of the second upmost column; and Red Dragon, the third rightmost tile of the top column.\n\nA Mahjong set consists of 144 tiles. These are split into the following seven groups (a.k.a. sets):\n\n  1. Ball tiles. There are nine of them. Each appears four times.\n  2. Bamboo tiles. There are nine of them. Each appears four times. Notice that the \"One of the Bamboo\" tile is drawn like a peacock.\n  3. Character tiles. They are drawn as containing two Chinese characters, where the upper one indicating the number is in black, and the lower one in red. There are nine of them, each of which appears four times.\n  4. Wind tiles. There are four wind tiles: East, South, West and North represented as their Chinese characters. Each of them appears four times.\n  5. Dragon tiles. There are three dragon tiles: Green Dragon, White Dragon and Red dragon. They are drawn as Chinese characters in this game. Each of them appears four times.\n  6. Season tiles. There are four tiles, each representing a season of spring, summer, autumn or winter. Each of them appears only once, and any of them can match with another.\n  7. Flower tiles. There are four tiles, each representing one of the following: ORC (Orchid), PLM (Plum), BAM (Bamboo) and MUM (Chrysanthemum). Each of them appears only once, and any of them can match with another.\n\nThese tiles may be hard to distinguish.\n\nThe \"Level\" at the bottom of the screen shows you the height of the tiles, as the game is only two-dimensional. It is recommended to learn this early, as it is easy to forget that the lower, inside tiles are actually higher and free to remove.\n\nStrategy Tips[edit]\n\n  \u2022 When removing a pair, an identical pair exists in the layout. Check if the other pair has any problem being removed later or one of the tiles you want to remove now should rather be used with another of its kind.\n  \u2022 Long rows and tall stacks are hardest to remove and block the most tiles. Work on those first but still keep the other strategies in mind when doing so. Plan ahead to see which areas might have problems and which tiles need special attention, so you do not remove a pair and get stranded with one you cannot remove.\n  \u2022 If all of a kind can be removed, do so straight away to clear space. An emptier board is much easier on the eye and mind and after all, the objective is to remove all tiles anyway.\n  \u2022 Using the hints shows you one possibility, not the best one. Following this advice might lead into a dead end.\n  \u2022 If you have the choice between 3 tiles, keep the one that is least affecting the rest of tiles. In other words remove the one that frees up the most tiles.\n\nGame Modes[edit]\n\nStart screen.\n  \u2022 Solitaire: 1-Player. Remove all tiles without a time limit.\n  \u2022 Tournament: 1-Player. You get 1 point for each tile removed. Go through several puzzles with or without a time limit. Choose 5, 10 or 20 minutes to complete as many sets as you can.\n  \u2022 Challenge: 2-Player. In this mode you have time-limited turns. Choose between 10, 20, 30, 60 seconds per turn. Player 1 starts. Inevitably, some turns will result in a match being removed and some won't. At the end (when the layout is clear or unwinnable) the player with the biggest score wins.\n\nCommon options[edit]\n\nWhile the game play is the same between each version of the game, the available options differ from one release to the next. Below is a list of common options that are typically present throughout the majority of releases. Interestingly, if the game is in Japanese, most selections are English commands written in Katakana, as opposed to fully translated Japanese commands.\n\nOption Japanese Description\nTiles or\nFile Select\n\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30eb\u30bb\u30ec\u30af\u30c8 Many versions of Shanghai come complete with preloaded puzzle arrangements that are known to be challenging but solvable.\nNew Game \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 Choose this if you wish to give up on the current arrangement and begin working on a new one.\nHelp \u30d8\u30eb\u30d7 This is typically an option that opens a sub-menu of choices that you can select to improve your chances of solving an arrangement.\nBackup or\n\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30d0\u30c3\u30af Choose this to rewind your previous moves, one pair of tiles at a time. Typically, this can be taken all the way back to the start of the game.\nRestart or\nTry Again\n\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30b2\u30a4\u30f3 Select this option if you wish to start the current puzzle arrangement over from the beginning.\nHint or\n\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8 This option will highlight a pair of tiles that are available for removal.

You can help Metroid Wiki by expanding it.\n\nMetroid Wiki is in need of filling in various stubs!\n\nMetroid II: Return of Samus is the second game of the Metroid franchise, and is the original sequel to the 1986 NES title Metroid. It was released for the Game Boy in 1991. Chronologically, its events follow those of the Metroid Prime: Trilogy and precede those of Super Metroid.\n\nStory continuity\n\nAlthough Return of Samus was originally intended to be a sequel to Metroid, several newer games take place between the two titles. The entire Metroid Prime series takes place between Metroid and Return of Samus, placing the game sixth in the timeline.\n\n\nSamus lands on the desolate planet SR388, the Metroid home world. Her mission is to eliminate every Metroid on the planet. Inside the labyrinthian cave system of the planet, she encounters many different hostile life forms, such as Hornoads and the Metroids. Alpha Metroids, Gamma Metroids, Zeta Metroids, and even Omega Metroids. As Samus proceeds deeper into the planet, she is forced to eliminate every Metroid. When she finally reaches the farthest depths of the caverns and she finds a giant Queen Metroid. After a difficult battle with the Queen, Samus continues to search for the last remaining Metroid, only to discover a Metroid Hatchling. Rather than attacking her, it follows her, believing Samus is its maternal figure. Seeing the potential for scientific discoveries, Samus decides not to terminate it. She returns to her ship by way of an escape cavern that is cleared out by the baby Metroid.\n\nAfter Samus's mission on SR388 is over, she brings the last surviving Metroid to the Ceres Space Colony to have scientists harness its power. After it is stolen by Ridley, Samus returns to Zebes to find it. This story is told in the 1994 SNES title Super Metroid.\n\n\nBased on the amount of time in which the player beats the game, there are three different possible endings while the credits play.\nThe possible endings are:\n\n  \u2022 5 or more hours: Samus keeps running.\n  \u2022 Between 3 to 5 hours: Samus curls into a ball, jumps, and lands.\n  \u2022 Under 3 hours: Samus curls into a ball, jumps, and lands wearing a bikini.\n\n\nSee Credits: Metroid II: Return of Samus for more information.\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Return of Samus is the only main Metroid game not to have an exclusive game page on the official Nintendo press site (username: guest, password: nintendo).\n  \u2022 Return of Samus is also the only 2D game that was not developed by Metroid director Yoshio Sakamoto.\n\nExternal Links\n\nMetroid Recon's Complete Map of Metroid II's SR388",
