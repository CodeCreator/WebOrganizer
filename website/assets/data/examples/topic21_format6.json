In that one year of starting, he threw for over 3,600 yards and 27 touchdowns. Just as impressive was his 500-plus yards rushing.\n\nWhere Scott ends up going in the draft remains to be seen, but regardless, he should prove to be one of the better value picks at the position and could end up paying off for an NFL team in a big way down the line.\n\nHere are some highlights of Matt Scott's career as an Arizona Wildcat.\u00a0\n\nBegin Slideshow \u00bb\nLoad More Stories\n\nFollow B\/R on Facebook\n\nOut of Bounds\n\nNFL Draft\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nWe will never share your email address\n\nThanks for signing up.",
