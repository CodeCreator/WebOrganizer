And do so with empathy.\n  \u2022 Listen to others with understanding.\n  \u2022 Express appreciation for other members of the community. Maintain a 5:1 ratio of positive vs. negative interactions.\n  \u2022 Keep a positive and forward-thinking attitude during destabilizing situations. Use chaos as an opportunity to demonstrate integrity.\n\nWe commit to taking accountability:\n  \u2022 Be accountable for our actions and results.\n  \u2022 Be assertive not aggressive: maintain a healthy balance between our necessities and those of our community members.\n  \u2022 Focus on finding solutions and achieving results.\n  \u2022 Actively engage in discussions and commit to decisions once they are made.\n\nWe commit to having humility and desire to learn:\n  \u2022 Be open and curious to learn from anyone, anywhere.\n  \u2022 Seek, provide, and accept honest feedback.\n  \u2022 Embrace change for continuous improvement.\n  \u2022 Learn equally from our mistakes and successes.\nPublicly apologize if necessary and implement change.\n\nWe commit to letting different voices echo together:\n  \u2022 Never make an executive decision: always involve teams in discussions for decisions and plans that affect them.\n  \u2022 Founding members don\u2019t get to decide: every organizer has the ability to autonomously make strategic decisions for themselves and their work groups, without the pre-approval of founding members as long as the rest of their team is in agreement.\nThe entire team of organizers is expected to collaborate on ideas for campaigns, actions, materials, and implementation of new or changing policies.\n\nWe commit to giving and not just taking:\n  \u2022 Nurture open communication: help activists understand that their input is valued even if you decide to go on a different route.\n  \u2022 Lay out clear and structured groundwork of information for activists to build up on.\n  \u2022 Support community activists\u2019 independence and trust that they will do the right thing; stay away from micromanagement.\nAppreciate self-improvement.

TOTAL ANIMAL LIBERATION Our ultimate goal is total animal liberation. Every non-human animal has the right to live free and without being an object of harm or exploitation.\n  2. COMMUNITY Social change will only grow around a strong core community. As individuals, our actions can only influence other individuals and only change behavior. But as communities, we can begin to change culture and shape new ideas.\n  3. PRO-INTERSECTIONALITY Diversity in our movement is key. CF strives to be as pro-intersectional and inclusive as possible, in every action and in every material we put out. Human or non-human, it is not our characteristics that make us matter\u00a0but rather our very existence does. To be truly free from oppression, we must stop all of its forms.\n  4. ACTIVISM & VEGANISM We promote and acknowledge veganism as a step towards the rejection of speciesism and the elimination of animal use, but it is not an ends in itself. In order to achieve total animal liberation, we must unite to speak up for the non-human animals through highly creative, non-violent activism.\n  5. THE STORIES OF THE NON-HUMAN ANIMALS Just because we don\u2019t understand the languages of non-human animals doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have stories to tell. CF features the animals and their stories as a way to decommodify their image.\n  6. INSPIRATION The success of our movement depends upon always keeping the momentum, always growing, and always looking at the bigger picture ahead. When we inspire others, we get inspired in return, and this drives us forward. Inspiration is the spark that brought us all here, and it is the spark we should strive to ignite in others.",

        "text":"Policies PDF Print E-mail\nTuesday, 28 July 2009 00:00\n\nQuestions for Canadians:\n\nAre you as proud of being Canadian in 2015 as we all were in 1967 or 1867 when launched confidently onto the world stage? How about in 1987, when we were fighting acid rain and working to free Nelson Mandela? How about in 1997 when we led the world into the historic Kyoto Accord to try to address Climate Change?\n\nDo you feel more secure now or less? There is nowhere to hide from terror except freedom. Terror grows in poverty, failed wars and greed. You can\u2019t beat terror in a war \u2013 you beat terror with the firm stance of a peacemaker. With fairness and justice. And with compassion and assistance.\n\nWhat are Canadian values? What is the essence of Canada? Is it found in the historic compromise of private and public enterprise? In the diversity we all share and admire? In the natural beauty and wonderful environment we have been blessed with. Or is it as simple as keeping your promises? Do you really feel that any political party represents those values?\n\n\nGood Business \u2013 Sustainable Prosperity\n\nEconomic growth is not the only measure of human achievement but the creation of wealth makes it possible for us to do many things. We seek to create a sustainable economy with true competition and a level playing field. Balance in the economy is crucial. If any one player has too much power, be they big business, big government or big unions \u2013 then the balance is lost.\n\nWe are, at heart, a party that supports small business. There is a role for government in the economy, but it must support and not compete with small business.\n\nWe support the \u201c100 mile challenge\u201d which encourages purchasing from local enterprises. It\u2019s environmentally sound because it uses far less resources. It\u2019s economically sound because local businesses return far greater amounts to the economy. It fits with our belief that small business is the engine of our economy.\n\nWe will restore income trust legislation to it\u2019s previous state and work with all key stakeholders to develop legislation that makes sense for Canadians. For more information on our policy, click here.\n\n\nWe consider family farms to be one of the great examples of small business.\n\nOur \u201c100 mile challenge\u201d would support family farms and innovative agricultural businesses.\n\nWe completely support the Wheat Board but we need more. We need the equivalent of the CMHC for farmers.\n\nWe guarantee mortgages to facilitate the housing market.\n\nWe need a solution of a similar nature for farmers to once and for all relieve the terrible pressures that are driving them off the farms.\n\nOur Place in the Global Community\n\nA well equipped, highly motivated military is the key to our sovereignty and our place in the world. We are peacekeepers and diplomats \u2013 both of which take exceptional courage and determination. We need to find our own voice in the world and set our own policy \u2013 friendly, but independent of the dominance of any other nation. We need to find the .7 percent solution and make a contribution towards world peace by ending the scourge of world hunger and disease in our lifetime.\n\nWe have a plan to get out of Afghanistan with dignity and to rethink our role as peacekeepers and protectors of our own sovereignty. People in poor nations take desperate measures due to extremes of poverty. Economic aid and justice are the best weapons against terror.\n\nInvesting in Education:\n\nOur education system needs to be set to meet our future needs. In a country where we are chronically short of doctors, and where the population is aging does it make sense that we can only find 5 students to enter geriatric medicine? Does it make sense that a student should have to go more than 60 and perhaps even as high as 100 thousand in debt to fill these important needs?\n\nOur education policy is about equal opportunity for all. We will provide a program of economic support for every student in post secondary education to ensure that education is accessible for all. Over a period of years we will phase in a tax based program to relieve students of the burden of debt. Providing the graduate stays in Canada for a period of years, and providing the student participates in the tax system, Canadian students will no longer carry debt.\n\nWe will renew funding to post secondary institutions for operations and not just capital projects. This program will cover all post secondary education from trade schools to universities.\n\nOur program will feature a \u201chead start\u201d to ensure that young children are given an equal opportunity by recognizing some of the challenges in early years that must be addressed\n\nHealth Care\n\nWe believe in a One-Tier health care system \u2013 BUT - we believe that small business has a key role in the public system. Doctors are one type of small business that already supplies the public system. If it is more cost effective to utilize business in our health care system that is what we should do, providing that health care is still available to all at no cost and that payment will not put someone at the front of the line.\n\nThrough our education program we will have more trained medical staff staying in Canada to relieve the severe shortage.\n\nDemocratic Deficit, Accountability and Intergrity\n\nKeeping promises is essential to faith in democracy. We propose a Contract with Constituents \u2013 we will be clear on what we will promise versus what we will make up our minds on with the facts at some future date. To keep from keeping his promises, Mr. Harper has started a campaign of disinformation on all of these areas. We need to set the records straight.\n\nGovernment needs accountability and an end to patronage. There are too many examples of senior officials and agency appointees who have been \u201cfired\u201d with colossal severance. We need to reward great performance but not poor or substandard performance. Ensuring that accountability is in place is the best way to restore pride in civil service and encourage those who work hard.\n\nWe need to start keeping our promises by honouring the Kelowna Accord with First Nations; we need to continue what we started by meeting Kyoto Commitments; we must keep our promises with Provincial governments.\n\n\nWe need to end the culture of defeat on the environment. This is the country that won at Vimy Ridge. We helped with the only battle that Churchill feared to lose \u2013 the battle of the Atlantic. We invented peacekeeping. Canada as a nation is at its best when confronted by \u201cimpossible\u201d challenges.\n\nOur natural environment is not only a treasure, it is an asset. Water is the oil of the next century\u2026our natural resources have to be protected as they will be our currency on the world stage in the next hundred years. Kyoto is an opportunity to transform our economy, retrofit our infrastructure (especially in cities), clean up our air and water and make this the \u201cwealthiest\u201d country in the world. Sadly, we have to prepare for the impact of global warming while we try to minimize it.\n\nEquality is Not Entitlement but Equality of Opportunity\n\nWe need to end some of the shames of aboriginal and child poverty in our country. If we cannot convince Canadians to do this because it\u2019s the right thing to do, we have to make the economic and safety arguments. A dollar invested in crime prevention is equal to seven or more spent on criminal justice systems.\n\nFinancial Responsibility\n\nWe need to schedule paying off our real debt over the next 25 years. The current government has increased spending at a rate of 8% -- the highest in years.\n\nWe spend approximately 25% of our national tax revenues on social programs such as health and education, yet these programs are not federally audited to ensure that your tax dollars are being spent fairly and wisely. It is the duty of the Government of Canada to ensure that all tax dollars collected are spent in a manner that benefits every Canadian. We will institute a \u201cSocial Auditor\u201d to track and measure spending in social programs.\n\nSupport for Local Municipalities:\n\nCities, particularly our major cities are a key to our economic prosperity. Aging infrastructure and archaic funding formulas threaten the ability of our cities to compete on a world stage. We support the 1 cent solution brought forward by the country\u2019s mayors.\n\nback to top\n\nLast Updated on Monday, 23 February 2015 14:56",

With our new partnership, we will reach out to local leaders, non-profits, constituents, and small, medium and large businesses through the existing chapters and branches of the U.S. Green Chamber of Commerce.

It will explore the stories behind the faces of London's street community, and through these 'humanise' rough sleepers to a widely desensitized general public.\n\nHOW? We believe that if you are given a medium through which you can relate directly to individual rough sleepers, you will better understand the plight of homelessness. What's more, you're more likely to take action in the future.\n\nWHO? The Pavement Perspective is run collaboratively by Frankie Bennett, a Law student, and many supporters who can be found on our Collaborations\u00a0page. The film's homeless participants will present the film to you themselves at our first screening on the 28th January 2014.\n\nWHERE CAN I WATCH IT? The Pavement Perspective's first screening will be at the end of January 2014. More details on are on our 'The Screening' tab. After this, there will be many more opportunities to watch the film around London and beyond.\n\nWHY? The homeless population in the UK is growing and we have a duty to care for our fellow citizens. Not every cause can be yours, but The Pavement Perspective is a great place to start.\n\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Founding Declaration\n\nInternational South Asia Forum Founded\n\nOne hundred and twenty four delegates with origins in different countries of South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and from both sides across the Line of Control in Kashmir met in Montreal on September 4 and 5, 1999 at a Conference hosted by South Asia Research and Resource Center (CERAS). Participants came from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, Washington, British Columbia, Ontario, Newfoundland, Quebec, France and England. There were also specially invited guests from India, Pakistan and France. The Conference expressed serious concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in South Asia. It took note of the worsening quality of life for the masses, growing militarization and acquisition of nuclear tools of mass destruction, the emergence of fascistic and bigoted political forces and the increasing hostility between India and Pakistan as evidenced by the recent war in Kargil.\n\n\nThe objectives of the Conference were to build solidarity among the various people from South Asia, and to formulate programs for strengthening secular and democratic forces among the South Asian Diaspora \u2013 especially among the youth \u2013 and to contribute to the betterment of life for the people of South Asia.\n\n\nThe Conference unanimously adopted the following Resolution, which has also been endorsed by the Secular People\u2019s Alliance, Edmonton, East Indian Workers Association, Toronto, Non-Resident Indians for Secularism and Democracy (NRISAD), Vancouver, South Asia Research and Resource Center (CERAS), Montreal and Pakistan Association of Quebec, Montreal.\n\n\nText of the Resolution\n\nThe rise of religious fundamentalism, its open links with organs of state power, accompanied with nationalistic jingoism, intolerance of dissenting views, and militaristic postures have combined to create an alarming situation in the sub-continent. The gradual Talibanizatin of Pakistan and the spread of the Sangh Parivar in India pose serious threat to polity of these countries. These dangerous forces are nurtured and supported by the politics and economics of globalization and neo-liberalism, which are not only imposing anti-people agenda on the lives of the people in the region, but also denuding it of its vital natural and environment resources.\n\n\nThe forces of religious extremism have increasingly permeated all levels of civil society. Consequently replacement of the BJP government in India or a change of government in Pakistan would not be sufficient to ensure peace, human rights, secular values and democracy in these countries.\n\n\nThe state-to-state relations between India and Pakistan, which have never been good, have taken a turn to more hostile postures with unsettling consequences for the whole of South Asia.\n\n\nOn the other hand, there is a tremendous, almost palpable, longing for peace, friendship and amity among the people. There is a realization that half a century of hostility and military confrontations have not solved any problem. The massive deployment of scarce resources should be used to meet the basic needs of the ordinary people \u2013 education, health, housing, and general economic well-being. In recent years people-to-people exchange and dialogues have begun to occur in the form of cultural programs and conferences.\n\n\nWe, the members of South Asian Diaspora located in North America and Europe, desire peace, harmony and good neighborliness among the countries of South Asia, and social justice and economic wellbeing for the people there. We also have a responsibility to make a contribution in these directions. Over the years many of us have been engaged in individual or organized capacity to work for secularism, democracy, human rights and social justice. Time has come for us to come together and work in concert with each other.\n\n\nAccordingly, this Conference resolves to create a Forum, hereby named as the International South Asia Forum (INSAF), with the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To work for peace and friendship among the people and countries of South Asia.\n\n2. To join hands with the people and organizations in South Asia:\n\n\n3. To carry out extensive educational and organization work among the members of the South Asian Diaspora, especially among the youth \u2013 in order to fight the forces of fundamentalism, narrow chauvinism \u2013 and to promote goodwill among the Diaspora;\n\n4. To seek the support of trade unions and other democratic organization for the struggle of South Asian people for human rights, peace and social justice.\n\n\n\n1. Sponsor seminars and invite speakers from South Asian countries to further these objectives.\n\n2. Coordinate and sponsor cultural and social events of mutual interest.\n\n3. Act as a center for issuing statements to the media on political, economic, enviornmental, social and cultural developments in South Asia and among the South Asian Diaspora.\n\n4. Create a Web site for popularizing its activities and promoting its objectives.\n\n5. Publish a newsletter to promote the objectives of INSAF.\n\n6. Encourage all organizations and individuals affiliated with INSAF and other democratic individuals to work at all levels of community activities.\n\n7. Develop specific programs in accordance with local conditions to encourage participation of youth with South Asian identity into progressive nonsectarian associations and institutions.\n\n\nOrganizational Guidelines\n\n1. INSAF will function as a coalition of groups and individuals.\n\n2. Affiliation to INSAF is open to all groups and individual in any country subject to their compliance with democratic, secular and nonsectarian objectives.\n\n3. INSAF does not aim at interfering with activities of its affiliates.\n\n4. Affiliate members are encouraged to identify their affiliation with INSAF.\n\n5. Affairs of INSAF will be conducted by a Coordinating Committee elected at this conference and its mandate will last until the next Conference of INSAF. Additional names can be added to the Coordinating Committee at the suggestion of affiliate organizations.\n\n6. The Coordinating Committee will decide upon most efficient and economical way of advancing the mandate of INSAF.\n\n7. Given the specifics of India-Pakistan relations and their influence on South Asian politics, an Indo-Pak subcommittee of INSAF be constituted to specifically deal with Indo-Pak issues.",

        "text":"A global support network for the LGBTIQ+ community\n\nThe Challenge We Face\n\nJamaica is one of the 76 countries where same-sex acts are illegal and homophobic and transphobic attitudes are largely entrenched. That\u2019s why Where Love Is Illegal, with the support of Global Ally, traveled to Jamaica to record the personal testimonies of discrimination and survival from LGBTQI+ individuals. Where Love Is Illegal's mission is to combat intolerance internationally and locally through dedicated campaigns like this one, where local NGOs and activists identified where change is needed and how storytelling can contribute to that change.\n\nAnd so #IAmAnAlly was born.\n\nLGBTQI+ in Jamaicans must take great caution when navigating public spaces. Those who do not present themselves along the traditional binary lines, such as transgender men or women, are at greatest risk being the target of harassment or deadly mob violence. As such, carefully navigating neighborhoods and relationships are an essential part of safely proceeding with daily life. \u2018Safe spaces\u2019 are vital havens to the community, where people can feel free to express their gender identity and sexuality without fear of persecution or judgment.\n\nFor some in the LGBTQI+ community, it can feel as though no allies exist, particularly when friends or family members turn their backs. But allies do exist, but often they too feel alone in supporting the LGBTQI+ community. Many fear that doing so will be met with disapproval. To contribute to an end to discrimination against LGBTQI+ in Jamaica, the community and allies must unite.\n\nJoin Us\n\nWe are calling on you to become an ally and show your support with the LGBTQI+ community in Jamaica. Every time an ally joins this campaign, the number and size of safe spaces grow. Bigotry thrives when the voices of those discriminated against and their allies are silent.\n\nYou can also show your support by buying an #IAmAnAlly t-shirt and increase the visibility of allies both in your community and in Jamaica. For every T-shirt purchased, one will be given to a Jamaican ally to proudly wear support for their LGBTQI+ family, friends and neighbors.\n\nAchieving Our Vision\n\nPersonal storytelling holds the power to connect people to issues outside of their own experience. By sharing the stories and experiences of Jamaica\u2019s LGBTQI+ community and the homophobia and transphobia they face, this campaign connects and enrols allies in a joint effort toward tolerance and acceptance\n\nCommunity members have expressed themselves through personal letters on this website, so allies will be able to openly show their support. And this open display of support will encourage others to speak out and stand up for a more tolerant society.\n\nThis campaign has been led by the community members who know Jamaica\u2019s LGBTQI+ climate most intimately. Through their already established relationships with local NGOs, the local activists connect with community leaders (both within the LGBTQI+ community and outside it) across the country to unify those allies who currently feel alone, and establish personal, meaningful connections with those who may not understand the current effects of their intolerance and misunderstanding.\n\nThis is a Witness Change project through Where Love Is Illegal.\n\nWant to get involved on the ground? J-Flag promotes social change by empowering the Jamaican LGBT community & builds tolerance for and acceptance of the LGBT community by the wider Jamaican society.\n\nPhotography and video by Robin Hammond\/Witness Change\nVideo by William Lounsbury\/Witness Change\nWeb Design by Bill Marr\nWeb Development by Esten Hurtle\n\nThis project has been made possible thanks to the generous contributions of Joe Nucci.",
