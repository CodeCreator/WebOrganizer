There are couple of things that reviewer should always keep in mind while doing code review\n\n1) Questions: don't make demands.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0i) what do you think naming this method into this?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0ii) I think changing our logic will improve performance what do you think?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0iii) Let's not use aberrations, are you agree with that?\n\n2) \u00a0Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. (\"dumb\", \"stupid\"). Assume everyone is attractive, intelligent, and well-meaning.\n\n3) Avoid selective ownership of code (mine, yours or not mine etc.) Using terms like ours, us looks more sophisticated.\n\n4) Humbleness: show humbleness in your words as well\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'm not sure - let's look it up.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Instead of\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I don't know, you should check it\n\n5) \u00a0Don't use sarcasm & don't use hyperbole.

        "text":"Best Open Source Headless CMS\n\nBest Open Source Headless CMS\n\nLet\u2019s talk about \u201ccontent\u201d first. The term content has become the king of any business. It is the driving factor for them. To get more and more customers to your site, you need to create extraordinary content with imagery, logos, and a distinct way of presentation. It is the only way to attract visitors and retain them. Now, the main thing that arises is how to create such content. For this matte, the CMS plays a pivot role.\u00a0\n\nThe traditional Content Management System (CMS), is built for creating content by using the web-based framework integrating both the front end and back end. If you opt to have a CMS for your site, you will surely get puzzled about which one to choose. However, an open-source headless Content Management System will help you in that situation.\u00a0\n\nIntroduction to an open Source headless CMS\n\nA headless CMS is a content management system in which one can store the content in the headless CMS and afterward send it back to display anywhere. The open source headless CMS use APIs that sends to any chosen devices. It is quite different from the old CMS.\u00a0\nThe headless CMS solves the issues of the modern web environment with the decoupled approach. Precisely, it provides a backend for managing the content along with API to create the content. It helps developers to freely access the codes for creating their API calls as well as templates for content delivery. A developer can reduce downtown, ease usability and lessen the internal expenses.\u00a0\n\nBenefits of headless CMS\n\n\nThe Open Source Headless CMS enhances the productivity of content editors. They can use this system as per their knowledge and developers use it as per the services they prefer. It is compatible with many frameworks such as React, Nect.js., and Vue. The developers need not deal with a plugin or create a custom approach for integrating the tools.\u00a0\n\n\nThe developers can pick up their preferred programming language. They can even build heads from end to end. There are no constraints for the developers to face such as proprietary development constraints. Even one piece of content can be reused by combining it with various other presentations so that projects are completed in lesser time.\u00a0\nThe flexibility of creating codes and integrating them as per the need of the developer is the best part of the Open source headless CMS.\n\n\nThe back end and front end are interconnected if you apply a traditional CMS. But, with the use of headless CMS, there is no downtime to the website. You do not have to face any compromising situation due to the CMS. There is a variety of hosting and deployment options with headless CMS.\u00a0\n\n\nA business should always be accountable for the data of its clients. It must be on the major priority list. In the case of open source CMS, it is quite an issue for businesses as well as users. As developers can review the procedures of security and resolve them beforehand, some businesses might be rigid in using this kind of CMS in their systems.\u00a0\n\nBut, it is quite secure for both parties. The developers can set the security level for each of the users inside the code. They can set the security policies based on each user\u2019s role to control the content that is visible to the users and actions which they can perform.\u00a0\n\nCost efficient\u00a0\n\nThe costs invested in a headless CMS are very affordable. It's lots more cost-efficient. On one hand, if a business thinks to create a new product, it's easier for them to move to CMS and create the product they want just with the help of the marketing department rather than depending on the developers for the creation of CMS templates.\u00a0\n\n\nThe headless CMS allows for managing and keeping an updated system. It is quite costly to upgrade the system from time to time. This is quite beneficial for the business and the developers as it's quite time taking also for the developers.\u00a0\n\nBetter software architecture\n\nA headless CMS provides a far better version of software architecture. It is created for making the separation between the CMS platform and the published content.\n\nApplicability of headless CMS\n\nThe headless CMS is useful to those businesses that need a small and less specialized team of people. They generally, do not seek to get specialists for the use of CMS (some may be required) but now in high scale like the old styles CMS. It is very applicable if your existing business has an inflexible and limited front.\u00a0\n\nThe major industries embracing the headless CMS. Industries such as sports teams, airlines, financial services, online retailers, etc. are some of them. The headless CMS allows connecting with its customers on a large scale and quickly responds to the market opportunities to remain consistent in the market.\u00a0\n\nThe headless CMS makes it easier to manage a duplicate copy of any content for more than one channel. It's quite a nightmare for any business to face such an unfortunate circumstance. If you create original content for your company, the updates added to it must not be copied and pasted into other numerous systems. Hence, the headless CMS plays a central source to manage all the business\u2019s content and assets. It provides a specific location for managing, updating, editing, and publishing the contents.\u00a0\n\nTypes of best headless CMS\n\n\nStrapi is one of the crucial open-source headless CMS. It can be easily modifiable. It uses JavaScript to build customizable, self-hosted content API. It has a strong plugin with a modern Software development Kit (SDK). It also offers free services with useful but limited features and with the paid payment method you can get a deal of a $9 per month plan.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0The codebase of Strapi is publicly available. The contributors can manage it on GitHub. It's quite easy to customize the API and the admin panel. The CMS can also be extended within seconds due to the intuitive dashboards. There are other API such as Angular, IoT devices, Vue, or mobile apps that uses RESTful, GraphQL which you can user. Strapi will help in maintaining data privacy and cost efficiency with its self-hosted content. You can do all of your tasks by writing content-to-edit-to-manage.\n\n\n  \u2022 Strapi works with many frameworks available in the market along with Nuxt.js, Next.js, and Gatsby. This CMS is loved by most the developers and preferred by global partners. Huge companies like Walmart, rNASA, eBay, and IBM use Strapi.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 It is flexible and easy to use even if you do not know how to use WordPress. The built-in ORM allows the creation of any content from easy to vague without knowing to code.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 The modular architecture of Strapi is easy to handle as it provides all the essentials to build an API that can be easily consumed for frontend applications.\n\n  \u2022 The automation system is customizable. It supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. Hence, you do not have to suffer any kind of issues with storing user credentials.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Strapi provides API endpoints with the tool called Strapi Explorer.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 It provides very useful plugins to easily install new\/existing applications.\u00a0\n\n\n  \u2022 The drag and drop feature of Strapi is quite inefficient as it leads to the display of repeated images quite often.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Migrating existing endpoints is tricky on Strapi. However, having great skill and knowledge of REST APIs can be supportive to use Strapi in this situation.\n\n  \u2022 Strapi does not support the typescript due to its limitations on it. But, the use of plugins like npm repositories can be helpful to some extent.\n\n  \u2022 Strapi is not a fully open source CMS as it is released under the MIT license. But, the pro version of it comes with custom plugin support \/premium support with priority email access.\n\n  \u2022 It deals with lots of frequent updates via emails. There may come updates weekly on the stable version.\u00a0\n\n\nStrapi offers a free plan with a few features only. It also has another plan called the Enterprise plan.\u00a0The pricing policy of Strapi is quite feasible. It is self-hosted CMS. The starting price is $9.0\/month for each user. It has two varieties of price plans:\n\n- Bronze plan: This is a self-hosted plan charging $9.0\/month for each user.\u00a0\n\n- Silver plan: This is also a self-hosted plan charging $29.0\/month for each user.\u00a0\n\n\n\nContentful is the renowned and oldest headless CMS. It is a cloud-based headless CMS. You can easily update the contents of a mobile app, site, or any platform which displays the contents. Most of the users prefer it as a CMS after WordPress. It is quite satisfactory and user-friendly. It is berlin-based CMS.\n\nIt saves time and hassle by assisting in building the backend to manage the content and providing the tools to generate an app or website. the languages used in this CMS are JavaScript with Node, Python, PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, and .Net. The data are automatically backed up by two different physical centers along with Amazon Web Services.\u00a0\n\n\n  \u2022 Allows creating new pages for the site without any issues.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Good balance of Cost as well as features. As the API allows to extend Contentful and create a good integration with the system.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 It is highly secure to use. It is governed by the ISMS with ISO 27001:2013 international standard.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 The major tools such as Slack, GitLab, Jira, Heroku, Dropbox, and many others as compatible with Contentful.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Unified structure from all sources and can publish as per your need.\u00a0\n\n\n  \u2022 To use Contentful, one has to be technically sound due to handling of the API rules and final rendering is quite impossible without a web development team involvement.\n\n  \u2022 The cloud-based scalability can heighten drastically as per the need.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Lack of access to more people to work collaboration on one content.\n\n  \u2022 Lack of effective back-end.\u00a0\n\n\nContentful offers 5 tier offers for 5 free users as per the upgrading to a paid space, it is extended to 10 free users for individual team and enterprise accounts. Beyond this limit, you can add more users by paying $15\/month per user. For a te... (truncated)",

Programming Legends BY ARNO HUETTER\n  2. 2. About the Author Arno Huetter Arno wrote his first lines of code on a Sinclair ZX80 in 1984. Over the years, he has programmed internet banking systems, mobile phones (pre-smartphone), public administration and healthcare software, and application performance monitoring solutions in C\/C++, Java and C#, including a fair amount of database development. Today he works as development lead at Dynatrace. Arno is also a mentor at CoderDojo Linz, a coding club for children. Being a history buff in general, he enjoys reading and writing about computer history, too.\n  3. 3. Programming Legends \u2022 \"Programmers who contributed hugely to and had a lasting influence on the software development profession, linked with an extraordinary personal story.\" \u2022 Technical brilliance is one thing, but it might also require being at the right place at the right time, finding a congenial partner or having recent innovations at one's disposal. \u2022 Most \"top 10 influential \/ famous \/ rockstar programmer lists\" have the usual suspects: \u2022 [1] Ritchie, Stroustrup, Gosling, Torvalds, Hejlsberg, Berners-Lee, Kernighan, Thompson, van Rossum, Knuth \u2022 [2] Ritchie, Torvalds, Stroustrup, Berners-Lee, Kernighan, Knuth, Thompson, van Rossum, Gosling, Gates \u2022 [3] Ritchie, Torvalds, Knuth, Thompson, Stroustrup, Berners-Lee, Kernighan, Gosling, Stallman, Lovelace \u2022 Alan Turing? Mathematician, cryptanalyst, specified electromechanical code-breaking devices, proposed universal computing machine. \u2022 Steve Wozniak? Great programmer, but his genius was in electronic engineering. \u2022 This small selection is based on a voting within a developer-only Facebook group plus one author choice (Ritchie\/Thompson).\n  4. 4. Ada Lovelace \u2022 Born 1815 in London. \u2022 Daughter of Lord Byron, one of England\u2018s greatest poets. \u2022 In order to prevent Ada from becoming a romantic like her father, her mother supports Ada\u2018s interest in mathematics and logic. She is tutored by some of the best mathematicians of her time. \u2022 Her analytical skills are truly remarkable. \u2022 Lovelace is widely recognized as \"the first programmer\". (Bernoulli numbers algorithm for a Turing machine). \u2022 US Department of Defense even named the programming language \"Ada\" in her honor.\n  5. 5. Ada Lovelace \u2022 1833: At age 17 she is introduced to Charles Babbage, inventor of the so called \u201eDifference Engine\u201c, a mechanical device used to calculate polynomial functions (only a prototype was finished during his lifetime, first full engine constructed in 1989-1991). \u2022 Lovelace gets to see the Difference Engine prototype, visits Babbage often and exchanges letters on the topic. \u2022 1837: Babbage proposes the \u201eAnalytical Engine\u201c, a general- purpose computer (input via punch cards, an idea originating in the Jacquard loom; base-10 arithmetic, 10,000 number storage via gear wheel state - never built - but emulators exists today incl. visual interface).\n  6. 6. Ada Lovelace \u2022 In 1842 Babbage explains his plans to Luigi Federico Menabrea (future Italian prime minister), who in turn describes the invention in a French article. \u2022 Lovelace translates Menabrea's article on the Analytical Engine to English and adds her own notes. These notes end up two times longer than the original article itself, and become famous. \u2022 She provides a detailed algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers, including loops, conditional branches and subroutines. The \"translated\" source code can be found on GitHub today. \u2022 She also describes the engine as a general purpose computer, as opposed to a pure calculating machine. \u2022 Lovelace is the first one to grasp that the engine's concept goes beyond numerical computations, but can be applied to any symbolic representation. For example the machine might create music.\n  7. 7. Donald Knuth \u2022 Born 1938 in Milwaukee. Ingenious problem solver at school, wins a contest in finding the most words that can be created from a set of letters, 2,000 more than judges had on their list. \u2022 While studying Physics at Case Institute, Knuth is introduced to the IBM 650 computer (first mass-produced). He programs in machine code, later assembler, notices he can improve most existing programs. PhD from Caltech (later becomes Professor at Stanford). \u2022 Knuth gets a contract to write an Algol compiler for Burroughs. \u2022 In 1962 receives an offer from Addison Wesley to write a book on compilers. Decides he must initially cover the elemental theory and composes the first chapters of \"The Art of Computer Programming\". \u2022 Knuth covers every topic in great detail, and conducts in-depth preparation. The first volume (Fundamental Algorithms), based on a 3000 page handwritten manuscript, is published in 1968.\n  8. 8. Donald Knuth \u2022 Volume 2 (Seminumerical Algorithms) follows in 1969, volume 3 (Sorting and Searching) in 1973 and volume 4 (Combinatorial Algorithms) in 2011. \u2022 The New York Times hails the books as \u201cthe profession's defining treatise\u201d. \u2022 TAOCP includes samples in MIX assembly language, for the hypothetical MIX computer (only exists as emulation). \u2022 Book exercises have a difficulty rank up to 50, with Fermat's Last Theorem ranking at 50 originally, downgraded to 45 after being solved by Andrew Wiles. \u2022 Knuth offers a USD 2.56 reward check for every mistake found in his books. People usually don't cash them in, but put them into a frame. \u2022 He receives the Turing Award in 1974.\n  9. 9. Donald Knuth \u2022 When receiving galley proofs of the 2nd edition of TAOCP 2 in 1975, Knuth notices the poor quality of the typeset, as photo typesetting had replaced hot metal typesetting. \u2022 Knuth is aware of the advances in digital typesetting from Xerox, and concludes to design his own typesetting system: TeX, aimed to produce high-quality at minimal effort and create the same results on any system. \u2022 He invents the font description language Metafont, and provides mathematical specifications for each letter. The letter \"S\" alone takes weeks to finish. \u2022 TeX is implemented in the WEB language (also created by Knuth, code is usually converted to C), and published in 1978. It is ported to many operating systems, and very popular within academia up to this day.\n  10. 10. Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson \u2022 Ritchie: born in 1941 in New York, graduates from Harvard with a PhD in Physics and Applied Mathematics. \u2022 Thompson: born in 1943 in New Orleans, graduates from Berkeley with a Master in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. \u2022 In 1966 resp. 1967 they start working at Bell Labs (AT&T division, Computing Research Center). Thompson creates the language B, the precursor of C. \u2022 Bell had developed a timesharing OS called MULTICS for a General Electric Mainframe in the 60s. In 1970, Ritchie and Thompson implement the first version of Unix (based on MULTICS). They use assembly on a PDP-7, then port it to a PDP-11. \u2022 Set up as an internal skunkworks project, officially they are working on a word processor (nroff) for the Bell Labs patent department.\n  11. 11. Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson \u2022 1972: Development of C starts on a PDP-11, mainly by Ritchie. He creates a perfect balance between language expressiveness and efficiency. C soon gets ported to other platforms. \u2022 Unix is then rewritten in C by Ritchie (I\/O subsystem) and Thompson (most other subsystems). Unix Philosophy: Minimalist design, make each program do one thing well, and work together, over text streams as interface. \u2022 As a regulated monopoly, AT&T is not allowed to enter the computer business directly. Instead they are required to license non-telephone technology to anyone who asks. \u2022 Academia picks up Unix, where it is being improved, e.g. at the University of Berkeley under Bill Joy. First BSD release in 1977. \u2022 Ritchie and Brian Kernighan publish \"The C Programming Language\" in 1978.\n  12. 12. Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson \u2022 In 1979 Bell Labs finishes Version 7 Unix. \u2022 1983: AT&T releases Unix System V. First TCP\/IP implementation in BSD 4.2. System V and BSD are the two roots for all following Unix implementations. \u2022 Also in 1983, Ritchie and Thompson jointly receive the Turing Award \"for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system\". \u2022 1999: Bill Clinton presents Ritchie and Thompson with the National Medal of Technology.\n  13. 13. Bill Gates \u2022 Gates is born in Seattle in 1955. Father lawyer, Mother board member of United Way (charitable organization, together with IBM president \/ CEO John Opel). Paul Allen is born in 1953. Both attend Lakeside High School. \u2022 Gates plays lots of competitive games during childhood with rewards for winning and penalties for losing. He reads Fortune magazine, plans for his first company and develops a strong business instinct. Gates is generally described as intense in everything he does. \u2022 At age 14, his high school receives a teletype terminal and timesharing slots on a General Electric computer. He immediately takes an interest. Quoting his teacher: \"On day one I knew more than him, but only on day one\". \u2022 Gates uses Basic for creating a course enlistment program, putting him into classes at the time and with the girls he wants.\n  14. 14. Bill Gates \u2022 Later Gates and Paul Allen are offered computing time on a DEC PDP-10 in exchange for finding operating system bugs at a Seattle-based company named CCC. They meet Steve Russel there, creator of the first computer game \"Space War\" back at MIT. \u2022 They learn Assembler, read operating system manuals, and dig th... (truncated)",

        "text":"Top trends in mobile development to look out for in 2018\n\n\nThe growth and advancement in the world of mobility technology is likely to witness an abrupt surge in 2018 owing to a massive chunk of population switching to Smartphones for accessing and using the internet. A major percentage of Smartphone users across the globe, browse the internet on a regular basis and prefer to use mobile apps as a means to cater to their everyday requirements. Tapping the advantages of this consumer pattern, most of the business owners nowadays are developing dedicated apps for reaching out to and engaging with their potential and loyal customers. With a series of major enhancements and innovations in the technology, the mobile app development will now consist of fascinating new designs and functionalities which will make is super easy to access the products and services of your choice with minimum number of clicks. Let us have a look at some of the hottest trends in mobile development that are expected to become a rage in 2018.\n\nAugmented Reality\n\nOne of the most thrilling and fascinating new technologies in the world of mobile app development is the incorporation of augmented reality as a means of providing the consumers with a more holistic and delightful experience. Although until a few years back, the augmented reality was a mere concept limited to sci-fi movies and TV shows, the introduction of gaming apps such as Pokemon Go and Sky Siege and other utility apps like myNav and iOnRoad are fine examples of what this technology could provide its users. 2018 is the year that will probably witness a lot of other businesses and enterprises on the likes of eCommerce, healthcare, lifestyle and entertainment jumping the bandwagon and integrating the Augmented Reality technology in their in-house apps to enhance the user experience and provide a boost to their revenue.\n\nApp Security\n\nAnother crucial aspect of mobile app development that will drive the focus of the app developers is the provision of higher security measures to make their apps more secure across the various channels and devices. The app developers will incorporate more comprehensive security protocols to ensure that user transactions involving personal and sensitive information such as bank details, NFC payments and social security numbers are designed for utmost privacy and are foolproof against hacking. The fact that professional and illegal hackers are now exposed to more advanced and improved technologies will be the major concern for mobile app developers who will be required to deal with cryptographic issues and provide a greater level of security to their apps.\n\nCloud based development\n\nExperts believe that cloud based development of mobile apps is the new trend in the market that is going to rule the roost in 2018. There are several benefits of this technology that will make it a quintessential part of all mobile app development henceforth. For example, cloud support will enable the app developers to deal with memory and bandwidth issues by maintaining the small size of their apps. Furthermore, cloud compatibility will allow users to sync their mobile apps and retain their functionalities across a variety of smart devices and platforms. The cross functionality and compatibility feature of cloud technology is also being touted as a boost for the popularity and demand of wearable devices such as the Smart watch for Apple users.\n\nLocation based technologies\n\nBy adopting the location based technologies such as Geo Fencing and iBeacon, most of the retail business owners are being able to provide the right information at the right place to the customers on the basis of their current location. The technology not only aims at providing a wholesome experience to the consumers but also ensures a steady growth and popularity of a business enterprise. The location based technology works on the idea that most of the public places nowadays such as restaurants, hospitals, malls and hotels offer free Wi-Fi to their customers that automatically kick starts an in-door mapping system which helps the business owners in tracking the exact location of potential customers.\n\nFocus on user experience\n\nAlthough, it has been a major driving factor in the growth and popularity of a business for years, user experience will witness an unprecedented improvement in 2018. In the rudimentary stages of the Smartphone technology, the consumers constantly faced a lot of variation in the experience of accessing mobile apps across multiple smart devices. In order to eliminate the issue, most developers will be now concentrating on maintaining a consistency of both the design and functionality of a particular app across various devices and even screen sizes. It goes without saying that the cross platform app development will probably gain massive momentum and become a major aspect of app design. The developers will need to use analytics data to keep a track of consumer behaviour and optimize retention by eliminating the chances of app abandonment.\n\nInternet of things\n\nDespite the fact that it is still in the infancy of its development, Internet of things is likely to become a Holy Grail for the propulsion of mobile app development to unprecedented levels. When a user integrates an app across various platforms and channels, he is essentially contributing to its establishment in the market.\u00a0 The staggering rate with which the people are connecting to each other via the mobility technology implies that all the major platforms such as Android and iOS will be getting more involved in IoT, to enhance their customer engagement multiple times over. To cite an example, the introduction of a smart car would mean integration of traffic signals with navigation based mobile apps that will aid in a safe maneuver of the vehicle across the city.\n\nTo sum it up in a nutshell, the mobile app development industry is going to witness untapped levels of innovation which will aim to provide a rich user experience and propel the business towards success.\n\nI agree to have my personal information transfered to MailChimp ( more information )\nJoin over 3.000 visitors who are receiving our newsletter and learn how to monetize your website.

        "text":"For some reason, the .htaccess file is often overlooked by web designers. If you have no idea what the .htaccess file is, I\u2019ll just give you the Wikipedia definition: \u201cA .htaccess (hypertext access) file is a directory-level configuration file supported by several web servers, that allows for decentralized management of web server configuration.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s get to it, here are some of the cool things you can do in your .htacces file.\n\n1. Hotlinking protection with .htaccess\n\nWebsites that steal your written content can be quite annoying because they can hurt your Google rankings by creating duplicate content. However there is even worst: websites that steal your content AND don\u2019t even make the effort of downloading images and reuploading it on their server. Loading images from your server is called hotlinking, and it\u2019s a bad practice because it steals some of your precious bandwidth.\n\nTo preven people from hotlinking your images, just include the following lines in your htaccess file (obviously replace with your site\u2019s URL.\n\nRewriteBase \/\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http:\/\/(www.)?*$ [NC]\nRewriteRule .(gif|jpg|swf|flv|png)$ \/feed\/ [R=302,L]\n\n2. Prevent directory browsing\n\nWhile directory browsing can be useful, it can also cause some security problems. To make your site a bit more secure, prevent directory browsing by including this file in your htaccess.\n\nOptions All -Indexes\n\nImage credits: Sens interdit by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bisson on Flickr.\n\n3. SEO friendly 301 permanent redirects\n\nI\u2019ve used this one very often, pretty much on every site where I changed the URL structure with a redesign or server move. To redirect old pages to their new address in a user-friendly way, use this structure in your htaccess.\n\nRedirect 301\n\n4. Display a custom 404 error page\n\nWhen a visitor tries to access some page of your site that doesn\u2019t exist anymore, your server will display a page with the message \u201c404 file not found\u201d. Some CMS allow you to set a custom page for those 404 errors, but the easiest way is still to include the following line in your htaccess file.\n\nErrorDocument 404 \/404.html\n\nImage credits: 404 room by Rapha\u00ebl Gotter on Flickr.\n\n5. Setting the default page of a directory\n\nIf for some reason you need the default page of a directory to be different, it\u2019s very easy to do with htaccess. For example, if you want the file default.html to be the default page, just add this line.\n\nDirectoryIndex about.html\n\n6. Block unwanted visitor based on referring domain\n\nUsually webmasters will not block traffic, but if you notice in your stats that some sites are just sending you spammers or trolls, you shouldn\u2019t wait to block them, that would just help you preserve your nerves. Just add the following code to do so.\n\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\u00a0 RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} [NC,OR]\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} [NC,OR]\nRewriteRule .* \u2013 [F]\n\n7. Specify upload file limit for PHP in htaccess\n\nThis one helped me several times when using Drupal on shared hosting, I had to reset upload file limits to allow my clients to upload bigger files and these lines saved me. The first one is maximum file size for uploading, second one is maximum size of the post data , third one is maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to run before it is terminated by the parser and last one is maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to parse input data such as like file uploads, POST and GET data.\n\nphp_value upload_max_filesize 20M\nphp_value post_max_size 20M\nphp_value max_execution_time 200\nphp_value max_input_time 200\n\n8. Compress files\n\nDo your users a favor and optimize the loading time of pages by compressing the files you serve on your website, here is an example of how to achieve this.\n\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text\/plain\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text\/html\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text\/xml\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text\/css\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application\/xml\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application\/xhtml+xml\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application\/rss+xml\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application\/javascript\nAddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application\/x-javascript\n\n9. Cache files\n\nMore website speed optimization by caching files.\n\n<FilesMatch \u201c.(flv|gif|jpg|jpeg|png|ico|swf|js|css|pdf)$\u201d>\nHeader set Cache-Control \u201cmax-age=2592000\u201d\n\n10. Force trailing slash\n\nI cannot prove it, but I\u2019ve read countless time that adding a trailing slash at the end of the URL was good for SEO and page load. If you also believe so just add this code in your htaccess.\n\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \/+[^\\.]+$\nRewriteRule ^(.+[^\/])$ %{REQUEST_URI}\/ [R=301,L]",

        "text":"Here\u2019s some tips to develop an app with great design for 2018\n\nwritten by\n\n\nWednesday January 24th, 2018\n\n\nPeople say don\u2019t judge a book by its cover, but frankly, it is important to nicely cover your book because it basically represents what\u2019s inside. When people download an app, they see the icon, name, contents, review, and so on. There are thousands of similar apps on market and people download those apps to see something really good. However, it only takes few minutes to decide whether they want to use the app or not. This is why designing your app is really important.\n\nLet\u2019s see up-to-date mobile app design trends for 2018 and catch people\u2019s attention.\n\n\n\nMinimalism and simple color schemes\n\nWhen the app has too many design elements, it may cause much-unwanted confusion for the user. Creating a minimalistic design makes the whole experience much easier-just click that button!\n\n\u201cLess is more\u201d rule also pertains to the variety of colors.\n\n\n\nMaterial Design: Young and Innovative\n\nIt was 2014 when we first met the concept of Material Design. Nowadays, material Design appears to be the most flexible solution offering light and dark backgrounds. Also, Material Design gives space for creativity and innovations letting designers add more features to the new version.\n\n\n\nIn-App Gesticulation\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to assume designers have used all their creativity in this regard. Gestures seem more exciting than using buttons because of two reasons:\n\n  \u2022 Hand-play makes the user experience more real and erases borders between a smartphone and its owner.\n  \u2022 Gestures make it faster! Deleting a letter within a second is more than possible now.\n\n\n\nFunctional Animations\n\nDeveloping user experience, functional animation lets them immerse in the application. Functional animation is especially important when you create a multitasking application.\n\n\n\nOnboarding and Offboarding Experience\n\n\u201cGet on board!\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re screaming to our precious users out loud. One of the up-to-date trends is a progressive onboarding experience when the app makes friends with a user outright. Offboarding means saying goodbye in the equally nice way. If you managed to surprise a customer on this stage, be ready to get the word of mouth advertising.\n\n\n\nTouch ID\n\nThis feature not only saves your nerves but also saves much time you usually spend on long verification processes. And what have we mentioned before? Right, any app should be a real speed master.\n\n\nTrends somehow reflect people\u2019s everyday needs and behavior. It\u2019s the most basic and fundamental roles of app developers and UI\/UX designers to catch the trends in order to make app successful.\n\n\n\n\nwritten by",
