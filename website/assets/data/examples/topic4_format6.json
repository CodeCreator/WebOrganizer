        "text":"What Dad does ought not matter\n\nUniversity entry has exploded since Robbins, but there are signs that parental social class is re\u2011emerging as a crucial factor\n\nJuly 11, 2013\n\nThe Robbins report, published in 1963 and seen by some as the last great state paper of the 20th century, shaped the higher education system we have today.\n\nIts 50th anniversary this October will be marked by many, and in a first salvo in this week\u2019s Times Higher Education, Paul Temple, co-director of the Centre for Higher Education Studies at the Institute of Education, hails the report that \u201ccleared the way for expansion by driving a stake through the heart of the \u2018more means worse\u2019 argument\u201d.\n\n\u201cIts research showed that entry to university largely depended not on ability but on class: 45\u00a0per cent of children whose father was in a \u2018higher professional\u2019 occupation entered full-time higher education, compared with about 2\u00a0per cent from families where the father was a manual worker,\u201d Temple writes.\n\nWhile young people increasingly seem to understand the loan repayment system, many parents do not and still talk of having to save up for university\n\n\u201cOnly an unusual genetic theory\u201d, he adds, \u201ccould link natural ability to your dad\u2019s job.\u201d\n\nThe size and scale of today\u2019s higher education sector is a world away from that surveyed by Robbins (even the target, set by Labour 14\u00a0years ago, for 50\u00a0per cent of young people to attend university has been all but met).\n\nYet there are threats to this transformation, which has happened within an academic career-span.\n\nResearch published this week by the Strategic Society Centre thinktank suggests that charging fees has put renewed emphasis on what your parents did, do and think when it comes to making a decision about university.\n\nThe report, Achieving Access for All, found that young people from a household with an annual income above \u00a352,000 a year were far more relaxed about the cost of a degree than those with less wealthy parents, and that those with graduate parents in non-graduate jobs were particularly likely to worry about cost.\n\nSingling out the key to getting young people into university, Nick Barr, professor of public economics at the London School of Economics, has said \u201cIt\u2019s attainment, stupid\u201d, but the researchers behind this week\u2019s report suggest an alternative: \u201cIt\u2019s the parents, stupid.\u201d\n\nAn additional \u201cparent factor\u201d, evident in the questions put to David Willetts, the universities minister, at the report\u2019s public launch, is that while young people increasingly seem to understand the loan repayment system, many parents do not and still talk in terms of having to save up to send their children to university or of being unable to afford to do so.\n\nThe report is particularly timely in that it coincides with the publication of access agreements for 2014-15, which show that the number of institutions charging tuition fees of \u00a39,000 will increase from three-quarters to nine out of 10.\n\nSo how to reach those with the ability and aspiration to go to university but most at risk of deciding that it is \u201cnot for people like them\u201d or is not worth the investment?\n\nThe mantra of providing them with information, advice and guidance still stands, but this is notoriously difficult to get right, and it will be even harder if, as many believe, the relatively benign terms of the loan repayment system prove unsustainable and have to be torn up after the next election.\n\nAt the very least, however, understanding which groups are most likely to be deterred, and why, should help to prevent a return to the days when university access was linked so\u00a0strongly to your mum\u2019s or dad\u2019s job.\n\n\nYou've reached your article limit.\n\nRegister to continue\n\nRegistration is free and only takes a moment.
