We pride ourselves in proving that with the proper knowledge, we are capable and able to make competent, ethical harvests at extreme distances. Through extensive research, product development, and range time, we are capable of shattering the preconceived notion of \u201cwhat is long range\u201d. We love what we do and are dedicated to showing our audience the \u201cextreme outer limits\u201d of modern hunting technology.\n\nBob Beck \u2013 Formerly a Land Developer, by trade, in the Greater Northwest.\u00a0 Born and raised in Oregon, his hunting career originated\u00a0 over 25 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0 His Western Big Game hunts have included High Country Mule Deer, Rocky Mountain and Roosevelt Elk, Coastal Black Tail and\u00a0Black Bear, Antelope and Northern Whitetail, in addition to several species in Africa, South America, New Zealand and Canada.\n\nOne of his greatest hunting experiences was solo backpacking into Wyoming\u2019s backcountry with the end result being a 192-inch High Country Mule Deer. \u00a0Most recently, he went on an Alpine heli-hunt in New Zealand, where he took his first ever Bull Tahr.\n\nAmong his long range hunting accomplishments are a confirmed 1,380 yard kill on an antelope, an 1,201 yard kill on a Rocky Mountain Elk, an 885 yard kill on a Coastal Black Bear and a couple Texas Whitetail\u2019s at the 1,100 yard mark. \u00a0Most recently Bob took his\u00a0first ever 200-inch Mule Deer on the famous Bair Ranch in Colorado.\n\nChris Beck \u2013 Formerly a small business owner in her hometown of Newberg, Oregon.\u00a0 She took up the sport of hunting with Bob nearly 7 1\/2 years ago while traveling along on many of his western big game hunts.\u00a0\u00a0 She has since had the opportunity to harvest a number of exceptional animals including a beautiful Trophy Mule Deer in Colorado and a remarkable Barren Ground Caribou Bull in the Canadian Territory of Nunavut, the largest, northernmost and newest territory of Canada. \u00a0Some of her other trophies include\u00a0Rocky Mountain Elk, Oregon Coastal Black Bears, Black Tail Deer, Antelope, a number of Muley\u2019s and a couple of \u00a0Whitetail bucks. \u00a0She took an awesome Red Stag in South America and one in New Zealand at 750+ yards, as well as a Colorado Rocky Mountain bull elk at 996 yards, but the list doesn\u2019t stop there. Other species have included a record book Red Hartebeest\u00a0 in South Africa, by far one of her favorite hunts to-date, and most recently, a Gold Medal Chamois in New Zealand.\n\nChris was filmed taking, what we believe to be the longest shot ever by a woman, with her 1,025 yard kill on a Coastal Black Bear, in addition to a 1,005 yard kill on a Coastal Black Tail, both on her home turf, in Oregon.",

From 1996-2000 I coached varsity cheereleading at Parkside High School, where I developed a competitive team. \u00a0The team won many regional and National Championships. \u00a0I then began to coach at Salisbury University from 2000-2004. \u00a0In 2006 I began Nor' Eastern Storm All stars. \u00a0In our 10 years we have won numerous Regional, National and \u00a0US Finals championships. Our gym has received the IEP award for excellence, we were the 2015 USASF Small Program of the Year and the 2016 CDE Program of the Year. I have 5 amazing children as well as 4 grandchildren. \u00a0I am retired from the motel business so I now focus entirely on making Nor' Eastern Storm a program that families love being a part of. This gym is my passion and the athletes are like my own children. \u00a0My goal is to share my knowlege and love of the sport of cheerleading with young people as well as teach them life skills to carry through their lives.\u00a0\n\n\nBrandi Rathel\n\nI am proudly USASF level 4\u00a0credentialed in both tumbling and stunting.\u00a0I have coached All-Star cheerleading for 10 years at STORM, but before that I cheered at the high school, college and open all-star levels. I truly enjoy coaching, my goal is to teach the love of cheerleading to the next generation and to teach the kids to work hard for what they want in life. Teaching kids self confidence through the sport of cheerleading and watching them grow mentally, physically and emotionally,\u00a0is what I love and find rewarding. We are a true family at STORM and I feel blessed to have so many kids in our program to call my \"own\". Currently, I am a special education teacher in Pocomoke, MD. When I am not teaching at school or STORM, I am spending\u00a0time with my wonderful husband Carson and amazing son Colby. These two are my world! I am blessed that I am able to share my love for cheer and dance with so many others and have\u00a0my supportive family by my side.\n\n\nKarli Boog\n\n\nKatya Andrews\n\nI am currently USASF levels 1 & 2 credentialed and I am excited to further my certification. I began gymnastics at a young age and invested 12 years into the sport. After gymnastics, I took on cheerleading and dance for 3 years, ultimately falling in love with both. It has been an honor since 2011 to be a coach at Nor\u2019Eastern Storm All-Stars. I have had the privilege to coach several cheer and dance teams since I began, from tinys to seniors and our amazing special needs athletes. The best part about being a coach at NES is watching the kids achieve skills and exceed their own expectations. After graduating from college, I began working as a Social Worker at PRMC. I am also CPR and first aid certified.\n\n\nElaine Tilghman\n\nAs an extension of my love for my own cheering years, I began coaching in 1984.\u00a0 Since my first JR. high team, I have led all levels in high school and all star cheerleading; started the very 1st all-star program on the Eastern Shore(\u201994); won multiple local, state and National titles and have enjoyed the journey.\u00a0 My certifications include 1st Aid, CPR & Concussion Protocol, \u00a0USASF certified Level 5 tumbling, stunts, tosses and pyramids. My day job, teaching physical education, helps my ability to analyze elements, determine corrections and communicate with my athletes. My goal is to help every athlete develop into a well-rounded, confident adult. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nKim Davis\n\nI work for Wicomico County Board of Education as a Registered Nurse. I was a high school cheerleader and dancer.\u00a0 I have always loved to cheer and dance. This will be my 12th year coaching all-star cheerleading and my 5th year with Storm! I am USASF credentialed in levels 1 & 2. I have coached minis, youth, junior and senior teams.\u00a0 I enjoy teaching all the athletes new skills and tumbling and then watching them perform at competition.\u00a0 This gym has an awesome group of athletes, parents, coaches and director.\u00a0 There\u2019s no place I would rather be than here at this place called STORM!\n\n\nJordan MacKenzie\n\n\nChelsea Lahey\n\nI am\u00a0a Towson University graduate that has an extensive background in both coaching and competing in gymnastics and cheerleading. As an athlete, I have proudly competed for a few all-star teams around the Salisbury area, but ultimately ended her career cheering for both Maryland Twisters F5 and Maryland Twisters Black Ice (2008-2010). With those teams,\u00a0I earned\u00a0myself a few national titles, air time on America\u2019s Got Talent, and a 4th place finish at the 2009 Cheerleading Worlds. For the past 8 years,\u00a0I have\u00a0been coaching in some form, whether it be tumbling, cheerleading, or gymnastics. In\u00a0my spare time, I enjoy running and competing in multi-sport events. With 5 seasons of coaching at Nor\u2019 Eastern Storm under\u00a0my belt,\u00a0I am\u00a0excited to be back again for another great season, great kids, and lots of fun!\u00a0\n\n\nTori Abell\n\nCompetitive Dance Instructor\u00a0\n\nLauri Andrews\n\nI have been a coach of our special needs team, Shooting Stars,\u00a0 for 5 years.\u00a0 I have previously coached All-star and JV teams.\u00a0\u00a0I am also proud to be\u00a0our Special Olympics certified coach.\u00a0\u00a0When I am not coaching at\u00a0Storm, I\u00a0am the Program Director at Lower Shore Enterprises, working with teens and adults for over 29 years.\u00a0\u00a0I am a\u00a0certified Red Cross and Behavior Management Cross Trainer.\n\nStaff - 1 to 10 of 12\u00a0\u00a0Next \u00bb\n\n\nThere are no items to display!\nView More\n\n\nImage View More",

On our Sunday and Monday\u00a0sessions, we practise some cool juggling or learn cool juggling from other people. We have lots of equipment like juggling balls, clubs and rings, diabolo, poi, unicycles, hoops, a random fake hand and lots more!\n\nOn Thursdays, we\u00a0play with fire in the amphitheatre by the lake. It's super safe and super fun. No experience with fire necessary - we'll provide training on the night, and we have insurance.\n\nWe also have outreach into the community, giving juggling and circus skills workshops for scout groups and the like. Any upcoming events will be on a sign-up sheet on the volunteering page.\n\nOccasionally, we have someone come up to campus to teach an unusual skill. Such workshops will often be open to the public as well, but will be cheaper for members.\n\nLastly, we organise the Bath UpChuck juggling convention which is an amazing one-day event with workshops, games and a professional show.
