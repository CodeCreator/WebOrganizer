        "text":"All the Robot Commands Used in 'Westworld'\u00a0\n\nA round up of the commands used on television's most mysterious new show.\u00a0\n\nThe first Westworld episode was brimming with literary references, shootouts, and nods to excellent Twilight Zone episodes. And yet, for all its allusions, it withheld much of the hard information about the nature of its world, leaving us to parse out the mysterious Man in Black\u2019s agenda, the park management\u2019s true motives, and even the extent of that seemingly-vast landscape.\n\nAnd although the premiere took a deep-dive into the nature of the robot\u2019s consciousness, their true nature still remains an enigma. At the very least, though, we began to get an idea of how humans control these advanced animatronics: spoken-word commands, which seem conversational until a robot shuts down mid-sentence.\n\nHere are all the commands that appeared in the first episode. Although the robots are asked questions like \u201cHave you ever questioned the nature of your reality?\u201d and \u201cWhat are your drives?\u201d we chose to focus on direct commands that result in behavioral action.\n\n\u201cBring her back online\u201d\n\nAlthough, this command is technically said from one human to another, it\u2019s the first thing we hear Jeffrey Wright\u2019s character say about Dolores and it comes up again frequently, for every naked robot interrogation.\n\n\u201cYou can lose the accent\u201d\n\nThis is another command we hear several times. Jeffrey Wright\u2019s Bernard says it first, and Luke Hemsworth\u2019s Stubbs later repeats it, and it instantly makes Dolores lose her \u201cgolly gee\u201d affectation.\n\n\u201cSoon this will feel like a distant dream. Until then, may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber\u201d\n\nWe hear this command several times \u2014 Anthony Hopkins\u2019s Dr. Robert Ford says it to the cowboy-robot in his introductory basement scene, and Shannon Woodward\u2019s Elise later says it to Dolores. Elise seems overly tender towards the robots, even going so far as to kiss one and wearing a Western costume, for some reason, later in the episode. Thus the first half of her speech seems to be an add-on. \u201cDeep and Dreamless Slumber\u201d are the key words.\n\nWhat's with the hat, Elise?\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can put yourself away again, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nDr. Ford says this to the cowboy-bot after first making him go into sleep-mode in the basement.\n\n\u201cCognition only, no emotional affect.\u201d\n\nStubbs says this to Dolores in her final naked-interrogation scene, when she comes to and immediately panics, still apparently thinking she\u2019s in the \u201cstoryline\u201d in which she has just been raped by Ed Harris\u2019s Man in Black and seen her cowboy suitor die. The command immediately halts her panicked breaths and sees her affect a placid demeanor.\n\n\u201cDo you have access to your previous configuration? Access that, please.\u201d\n\nFord says this to Dolores\u2019s first father Peter Abernathy during his naked-interrogation scene after he has seemingly had a nervous breakdown, which is rather unusual for a robot.\n\nAnd who knows what commands future episodes might bring \u2014 after all, these violent delights have violent ends.\n\nMedia via HBO, HBO",

        "text":"Tuned In\n\nVacation Robo-Post: What TV Shows Shaped America?\n\n  \u2022 Share\n  \u2022 Read Later\n\nRecently, the Library of Congress came out with a list of Books That Shaped America\u201388 tomes that are not necessarily the \u201cbest\u201d American books (though some probably are), but that \u201chave influenced our lives\u201d as Americans, one way or another. (Public radio\u2019s The Takeaway aired a discussion of the list last week.)\n\nThe list\u2013which runs from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to The Words of Cesar Chavez\u2013got me thinking that you can do the same thing with TV, which arguably has outdone books as an influencer for the last several decades. So as we head into the Fourth of July holiday, I want your nominations for the TV Shows That Shaped America: not a \u201cbest\u201d list, necessarily, but shows that have influenced modern culture or helped to capture or define what America is. These could be anything from shows that got Americans talking (Roots?), told us parables (The Twilight Zone?), informed us (60 Minutes?) or satirized us (The Simpsons?).\n\nI\u2019ll give you a few nominations, just to start:\n\nThe Andy Griffith Show. One of the first and best depictions of regional Americana, from a time, at the dawn of mass-culture, when American regions were still, well, regional. This gentle small-town comedy gave us Mayberry\u2019s quirks without ridiculing or patronizing them. And Griffith\u2019s Sheriff Taylor, who\u2019d rather wield a wry comment than a gun, was a weekly example of Americans talking through their problems.\n\nFriday Night Lights. About half a century after Andy Griffith, the story of Coach and Mrs. Taylor shared a surname with Griffith\u2019s show and a similar faith in people\u2019s basic decency. A show about football, family and faith in a small town, it was one of TV\u2019s best demonstrations of the meaning of community in action.\n\nAll in the Family. A TV show doesn\u2019t have to be small-town to be about Americana, and one of TV\u2019s most distinct post-\u201960s urban voices belonged to Queens dockworker Archie Bunker, who gave good argument.\n\nRoseanne. This show transformed Archie\u2019s chair into Roseanne Conner\u2019s beat-up, quilt-covered couch, in a sitcom that was always conscious of the work it took to keep bills paid and a family afloat.\n\nThe Wire. Because, come on. It\u2019s The Wire.\n\nThis is barely a start; you take it from here. I\u2019m having Robo-James auto-post this while I\u2019m on vacation, so I probably won\u2019t be playing along in the comments, but there\u2019s no need to limit our list to 88 shows. Suggest as many or as few as you want, and tell us why. And have a happy Fourth.",

        "text":"Top 10 Led Zeppelin Songs\n\nBy Alyssa Ladzinski,\nCan you choose ONLY 10 Led Zeppelin songs?\n\nLed Zeppelin forever changed and redefined the sound of rock in the 70s.\n\nIt seems impossible to say that a band was as influential as the Beatles, but for their decade, Led Zeppelin packed just as much of a punch.\n\nWith the vocal styling of Robert Plant, guitar god Jimmy Page, John Bonham on drums and bassist\/keyboarder John Paul Jones, Led Zeppelin came together and continued to go down in history as rock legends.\n\nFrom the ashes of a band called Yardbird, rose Led Zeppelin in 1968. The English rock band molded heavy metal, blues, rock and folk rock into one\u2014creating a sound that\u2019s never been done before. They signed with Atlantic Records, and from there they were free to express their musical freedom in any way they desired.\n\nKeith Moon, drummer of The Who, declared that the band would go over like a \"lead zeppelin,\" hence the name change to Led Zeppelin. Boy, was he wrong.\n\nIn both earlier and current times, Led Zeppelin still manages to transcend boundaries in the rock music genre and influence bands both new and old.\n\nDrummer John Bonham passed away in September of 1980 of asphyxiation, leaving fans shocked, devastated and inquisitive about the possible and inevitable end of Led Zeppelin.\n\nOne of the best selling and most influential bands of all time, Led Zeppelin were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and considered the \u201cheaviest band of all time,\u201d by Rolling Stone.\n\nDiscussing a band with a surplus of hit songs, it\u2019ll be difficult to choose just ten, but let\u2019s give it a shot. No matter what ten make the list, there are sure to be at least twenty more deserving of a spot.\n\n\n\nJoin Our Newsletter\n\nPopular Threads",

        "text":"Staff Picks: 10 Nightclubs You Need To Experience\n\nPlanning a European summer holiday? Perhaps a tour through South East Asia's Moonlight parties or South America's carnival season? Either way, Ministry of Sound has done it before and you're bound to hit some of our favourite international party spots along the way.\n\nIn celebration of Clubbers Guide to 2015, we're counting down our 10 favourite nightclubs in the world. From party capitals like Ibiza to the best hidden treasures around Europe, Ministry of Sound are taking you through the best places to party where it's totally fine to drink vodka out of a coconut and wake up in the wrong hotel room.\n\nParadise Club, Mykonos\n\nThe Greek islands are always a popular party mecca in the European summer and it's to no one's surprise that everyone flocks over to Mykonos for a good summer boogie. Paradise Club is an enticing cross between beach bar and open-air terrace, perched on a cliff-top that gives it a stunning view of the Aegean Sea. The club features regular residencies from Carl Cox and Avicii who provide the perfect EDM crushing touch to a European summer. Paradise Club shares the same coastline as rival club, Cavo Paradiso which rocks a similar vibe to the Paradise Club (for anyone prone to getting kicked out of nightclubs).\n\nZouk, Singapore\n\nZouk is one of the oldest and most prestigious nightclubs in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and is without a doubt one of the best in the world. Taking up an old warehouse space on the Singapore River, Zouk offers a spine tingling sound experience, mosaic features on the walls and the mantra of One World, One Music, One Tribe, One Dance. Read: strong vibes. Zouk hosts international performances every 2.5 days on avergae and a quarter of a million dollars is spent per year on props alone. Zouk is paving the way in Asia's nightlife scene and these guys definitely know how to throw a party.\n\nMinistry of Sound, London\n\nAhhh yes, our good mates over at MoS UK opened the doors in 1991. The Ministry of Sound Club is an icon in the London clubbing scene, inspired by New York's Paradise Garage, the club was devoted to bringing the American house scenes of the 1980's New York, Chicago and Detroit to a club that was purely dedicated to sound. Today, the ex-bus garage features the biggest house, techno, trance and big room artists every week. From Kaskade and Laidback Luke, Todd Terje to Cajmere, there is nothing quite like standing in the middle of the club's main room, The Box, and hearing the award winning sound system in full swing. Also the home to club shots most likely to have you saying; \"This guy!\"\n\nPacha, Ibiza\n\nOver the years Pacha has become a monumental club in Ibiza due to it's long history hosting some of the biggest parties in Europe. Offering a diverse combo of wider range house and nifty electronic nights, Pacha covers all bases in throwing their parties entirely for their colourful and juicy crowds, beginning from the crazy Balearic scene that kicked it off in the late 80's. Today, Pacha Ibiza has a whopping 3000 person capacity venue and has endured the test of time thanks to it's ability to transform itself from the commercial talents of David Guetta to the underground parties that welcome the likes of Solomun and \u00c2me. Pacha has turned into one of the biggest clubbing brands in the world with venues across other major cities such as New York, Buenos Aires and of course, Sydney. Well, what more can we say about this one - we love a night on the red cherries!\n\nUshuaia, Ibiza\n\nAnother dominant nightclub fixture in Ibiza is Ushuaia, which offers up a spectacular outdoor arena, pool and of course spacious DF surrounded by the hotel itself. Ushuaia is another venue in Ibiza that accommodates for both big room electronic music as well as house and techno. Recent residencies include Armin Van Buuren, Hardwell, Avicii as well as Joris Voorn and Nic Fanciulli. Shut up and take my money!\n\nBerghain\/Panorama Bar, Berlin\n\nNotorious for it's strict door policy and camera ban, the Berghain is an ex-powerplant that has been converted into onto one of Europe's deepest and darkest night (and day after) spots. Housing some of the most industrial techno sounds in the world, the upstairs Panorama Bar is decorated with large scale photographs, tall windows onlooking an amazing view of East Berlin and is the avenue for all the house heads. No need to worry about touching up the make-up ladies, as the Berghain is infamous for having no mirrors or reflective surfaces of such. And if you plan on going to the Berghain any time soon, no one arrives at the venue until at least 4am, so be prepared to party well into the following day.\n\nHakkasan, Las Vegas\n\nYou know EDM's big when Las Vegas mega hotel MGM Grand opens up a 3000 person capacity club that hosts Calvin Harris, Tiesto, Hardwell, Steve Aoki on the regular. If the commercial roster isn't really for you, the Ling Ling Club on the third level has pulled in line ups from the likes of DJ Jazzy Jeff , Rev Run and Questlove of The Roots. This joint is the real deal when it comes to the ultimate clubbing experience and it's the next frontier in the Las Vegas nightlife, blurring the lines between music festival and night on the town. It doesn't come cheap though with a $50 entrance fee for males and $30 cover charge for females. Sorry fellas!\n\nFabric, London\n\nWhat was once a meat storage facility near central London is now one of UK's best nightclubs which hosts the best house, techno and drum & bass parties in the buzzing party city. Fabric has three separate rooms, two often hosting live acts. But it is the bodysonic dance floor that makes Fabric different from anywhere else in the world, attached to 400 bass transducers that emit bass frequencies of what's currently playing. Recent Fabric DJ lineups include Netsky, Ricardo Villalobos, Groove Armada and Daniel Avery. Fabric is also renowned for their monthly compilations Fabric and FABRICLIVE albums that are mixed by established and upcoming artists from the greater European dance movement. Highly recommend.\n\nGreen Valley, Cambroiu\n\nHidden away in the tropical hills of Santa Caterina is one of Brazil's biggest nightclubs. With a capacity of over 6000, Green Valley hosts some of the worlds biggest DJs night after night. The club occupies a gigantic tarp covered dance floor area at the foot of a valley which is completely surrounded by rainforest, creating an energetic vibe flowing through the whole tropical venue. Talk about jungle! Brazil also hosts a number of the world's biggest and best nightclubs such as Sirena, Warung and D-Edge that are turning Brazilian nightlife into a dominant party destination.\n\nSpace, Ibiza\n\nHaving recently taken the crown of Best Club at the International Dance Music Awards, Space Ibiza is at the top of the list due to the incredible venue that features six clubbing areas and a 2000 person capacity main room. It's not only the state-of-the-art look and feel of this dance consortium that pegs it as the people's favourite, as it's programming is primo with some of the strongest and diverse clubbing brands on the planet. Offering up nothing but the best techno, house and trance DJs, Space hosts some of the best club nights in the world such as Carl Cox's legendary Music Is Revolution, Richard Hawtin's Enter and one of the hottest parties in Europe right now, We Love... Sundays presented by Disclosure. Space line ups are these days steering clear of most mainstage headliners, but it's well compensated with new age legends at the tip of the scene such as Disclosure, Skream, Rudimental, Umek, Dusky, James Zabiela, Sasha and Gorgon City! Ministry of Sound approved and our number 1 pick for the Clubbers Guide to 2015.\n\nLove the nightlife? Love to boogie? Anthems House can be downloaded on iTunes and Google Play now.",

        "text":"These 'New Girl' Thanksgiving Episodes To Watch During The Holiday Will Feed Your Soul\n\nI'd be hard-pressed to find a day that I didn't want to do a New Girl marathon, but perhaps Thanksgiving is the best day of all to take on such a welcomed task. Between having awkward encounters with your step-cousin twice removed and trying to avoid any and all political talk, you're going to be in need of a distraction, and the show can be a bright spot on an otherwise stressful day. But, even though the series as a whole is a pretty exemplary pick-me-up, there are certain New Girl episodes you have to watch on Thanksgiving to make the marathon as festive as possible.\n\nAt the risk of making the most obvious statement ever, the New Girl episodes you need to watch on Thanksgiving, are the ones that are titled, \"Thanksgiving,\" Thanksgiving II,\" \"Thanksgiving III,\" \"Thanksgiving IV.\" Names aside, they are so good that you'll definitely want to give them a watch. While we all know that Friends has kind of cornered the market on having the best Thanksgiving TV episodes of all time, New Girl gives the show a more modern run for its money. Besides, isn't it nice to switch things up after a while? I sure think so.\n\nHere are the New Girl episodes you need to watch with your family on Thanksgiving to balance out your own dysfunction with that of the loft-mates' shenanigans:\n\n\n\nIs there anything better than lamenting with Schmidt over how Thanksgiving is the \"least sexy holiday of the year\"? The answer is no, there isn't. Besides, watching Jess fail spectacularly at attempting to host the overwhelming holiday is reason enough to tune in.\n\n\"Thanksgiving II\"\n\nb017ni3 on YouTube\n\nHere's the only thing you need to know about this episode as evidenced from the bloopers above: Nick and Jess's mom flirt and make sexual innuendos about Thanksgiving staples. Sold.\n\n\"Thanksgiving III\"\n\nlili Neli Veling on YouTube\n\nThe third New Girl Thanksgiving installment is perhaps the most action-packed one with the crew roughing it in the wild. Also, there's the whole thing where Nick inadvertently poisons Jess with a fish (as seen above), effectively turning her temporarily insane. So, if you're feeling stir crazy while sandwiched on your grandma's plastic covered couch between your brother's weird friend from college and your napping aunt, watch this one, as it'll be a ridiculous yet needed fictional escape.\n\n\"Thanksgiving IV\"\n\n\"Thanksgiving IV\" proves that Schmidt is a hypocrite in the best of ways. Because despite telling Jess it was the \"least sexy holiday\" in Season 1, he tries his hardest to make Thanksgiving sexy this particular year. But, more than that, there's an added romantic bonus between Jess and Ryan as seen above. And, yes, it's not the Nick and Jess scene most fans would've wanted, but there's no denying that it isn't entertaining to see them try and make it work with other people.\n\nSo, stuff your mouth with stuffing and put on New Girl this Thanksgiving to avoid getting into any heated familial arguments. You're welcome for the tip.\n\nImage: FOX",

Her performance in 2021\u2019s The Eyes of Tammy Faye earned her the nomination, which was also her third, having previously been nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 2012 for The Help, and for her leading role in Zero Dark Thirty the following year.\n\nHowever, the California native - who is also known for superhero movies like X-Men: Dark Phoenix, horror movies like It: Chapter Two, and action thrillers like The 355 - has given plenty of other performances that critics and audiences alike would agree deserved similar accolades.

        "text":"\u201cI\u2019m gonna collect your golden broth\u201d: Can you guess which of these \u2018The Goop Lab\u2019 quotes are real or fake?\n\n\"I could not get any goopier\"\n\nGoop, the lifestyle brand founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, is brilliant at generating headlines. It is a company synonymous with perfectly outrageous phrases like \u2018vaginal steaming\u2019, \u2018Moon Juice Brain Dust\u2019, and \u2018psychic vampire repellent\u2019 \u2013 just three of the things the brand has advocated in the name of \u2018wellness\u2019. And, when the image for its new Netflix series The Goop Lab appeared in January \u2013 Paltrow standing in front of a series of pink and purple lines designed to look like a vulva \u2013 the internet did exactly what Goop wanted, and talked about the programme loudly and incessantly. Since the show came out on January 24, many have criticised the pseudoscience at the heart of the techniques featured in the show \u2013 including the head of the NHS \u2013 but others have pointed out that it also manages to communicate positive messages about things like sexuality and contemplation.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two main stances on Goop: it\u2019s harmless bollocks or it\u2019s harmful bollocks. The company is the subject of constant parody; Toni Collette\u2019s character in Rian Johnson\u2019s very recent film Knives Out, for example, runs a similarly vacuous company called \u2018Flam\u2019. Since its inception in 2011, Goop has had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawsuit settlement costs and admit that the claims it made about its infamous \u2018Jade Egg\u2019 \u2013 an egg that is inserted into the vagina and is supposed to help strengthen the pelvic floor \u2013 had no basis in science. It has also been reported to advertising authorities and roundly criticised for advocating bogus science and making its products so outrageously expensive.\n\n\nIn The Goop Lab, each of the six episodes examines one subject. These six are: psychedelic psychotherapy; cold water swimming; getting to know one\u2019s genitalia; biological ageing; energy fields; and mediums. Paltrow and her CCO Elise Loehnen interview spokespeople for the various techniques and either ask the Goop staff members to be prodded, drugged up and probed, or volunteer to undergo the experiences themselves. There is an awful lot of hugging, heavy breathing, and sentences like \u201cWow. I feel like I really connected with myself there?\u201d If it\u2019s not your kind of thing, it\u2019s going to be really not your kind of thing.\n\nBut, while the show undoubtedly features a colossal amount of nauseating new-age California wellness crap, there are valuable messages to be found. The episode in which women embrace their sexuality and get to know their bodies more intimately could be shown in schools; and there is a lot of evidence suggesting that psychedelic drugs should be used to combat various problems like PTSD. So, if you can stomach Paltrow and her colleagues banging on about the transformative power of speaking to the dead or having a man manipulate your energy fields while waving his hands high above your body, you might find some interesting stuff in there.\n\nOn which note: here are 15 quotes that are either legitimately from The Goop Lab or have been made up to fool you. Can you guess which is which in the NME Goop Lab quiz?",

        "text":"Network cancellations aren\u2019t an exact science. It\u2019s difficult to predict what a network will do, especially for shows that have avid but not large fanbases, or shows that were well-reviewed but didn\u2019t land enough viewers to automatically land in the renewal safe zone. This season, there are a slew of shows that fit this criteria, and depending on what deals the network is able to work out, some of them will land a renewal and some of them will be sure to be cancelled next month.\n\nOver at NBC, there are a ton of shows on the bubble. This mostly includes first season shows like State of Affairs, Marry Me, and American Odyssey, but it does also include About A Boy. A few months ago, NBC shortened the episode count of About a Boy, but the show is the network\u2019s longest-running comedy (wildly) and could come back next year. Which brings us to Constantine, NBC\u2019s oft-discussed freshman comic book series. The rumor mill last week stated Constantine was cancelled, but the outlet that first reported later retracted its statement. So, there still seems to be a glimmer of hope that the show will return.\n\nOver at ABC, there are also plenty of shows on the bubble, including programs that got full season orders and shows that received limited season orders, but could still return should the network want to give them another run. Among these are comedies Cristela and Galavant, and a slew of dramas like Resurrection, American Crime, Forever, Agent Carter and Revenge. Secrets and Lies probably could have been tossed on this list, but we\u2019re a little more confident about that one.\n\nOver at CBS, the choices seem pretty easy. While the network has already cancelled programs, including The Millers, CSI, Stalker and Battle Creek all have very dim chances. At Fox, it\u2019s Backstrom, Weird Loners and The Following that may get the ax.\n\nIt\u2019s always tough when a show you have invested in might be up on a chopping block. Fans get 22 episodes or a few seasons to get to know characters and it\u2019s tough when those characters don\u2019t return in the fall\u2014especially for the people who are watching more than one of the shows on this list. We know it can be tough, but here\u2019s the ultimate question: Which one of this year\u2019s shows with low-ish ratings would you like to see return to TV next season?\n\nIf you are looking for an updated list of network cancellations and renewals, head here.

The five-year-old franchise has seen about 100 percent growth ever year since Astel and his wife, Mary, opened it in 2009. During the busy season (April through October), the company does 20 events a week.\n\n\u201cIt depends on if the Cardinals are in the World Series,\u201d Astel said. \u201cIf they are, we do an event almost every night of the week projecting the games around town.\u201d Nationwide, FunFlicks does about 1,000 events per night.\n\nThe franchise, which operates from Rolla to the St. Louis metro area, will project anything from corporate videos to sporting events to feature-length films at both private and public events. Shell and Fox Sports Midwest are among the companies Astel has worked with. Screen rentals run from $299 (for five to 75 guests) to $1,199 (for 500 to 5,000 guests). The franchise employs about 10 hosts to run the screenings.\n\nFounded in 2006 by Martin Casas, Frontyard Features is a St. Louis company that puts on outdoor movies as well. According to its website, in its first summer as the formalized Frontyard Features LLC, it put on 40 movies in the city of St. Louis and raised more than $20,000 from advertising. It has expanded since. You can find movie events it is hosting on its Facebook page.\n\nAnd, because we know all this talk of outdoor movies is making wishing you had some to go to, here\u2019s a round up of some of the places you can find free outdoor screenings this summer:\n\nSt. Louis Art Museum Art Hill: July 11, 18, 25 and Aug. 1\n\nFrom \u201cFerris Bueller\u201d to \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d you can see classics broadcast Friday nights on Art Hill, with food trucks to boot.\n\nFlicks and Foodies: June 21\n\nStarting at 7 p.m. under the Gateway Arch, enjoy a free screening of \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d\n\nUniversity City Movies in the Park: July 12, Aug. 9\n\nSponsorship donations make this neighborhood film series, which is organized by a neighborhood volunteer group, possible. \u201cLife of Pi\u201d and \u201c42\u201d are on the docket for this year\u2019s films.\n\nLafayette Square Movies in the Park: June 28, July 26, Aug. 23\n\nThough the movies aren\u2019t listed, there are at least three, free outdoor movie events scheduled this summer.\n\n10th Annual Webster Groves Gazebo Series: Friday evenings June 13 through July 25\n\nMusic begins at 7 p.m. and films start at 9 p.m. at this weekly get-together at the Old Orchard Gazebo Park.

Personally, I try to respect the opening acts and pay attention to them because you never know when you\u2019ll find your new favorite band, but I get that not everybody has the same mentality. That being said, as soon as the headliner goes on stage, I expect the audience to shut up and listen to the band they paid to see. Otherwise you might as well just walk to a nearby bar and let the rest of us enjoy the live music experience in relative peace.\n\n2) The Snuggle Bunnies\nthe snuggle bunnies\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just bitter, but some of you couples are just plain gross. I didn\u2019t pay to hear Pretentious McHumbleBrag talk through the show and, surprisingly, I didn\u2019t drop $20+ to watch you grope each other either. I\u2019m not very tall, so when you and your significant other drape yourselves together and sway to the music, it\u2019s hard for me to see around you. I suppose staring at the back of your head is fine\u2014at least I can hear the band\u2014but once you start making out\u2026nope, not interested. The fondling, the gooey smiles, the need to declare your coupledom with your inability to stay apart for longer than ten seconds\u2026I feel like I\u2019m watching a dog marking his territory except everyone loves dogs and you only have eyes for each other. Also, for the love of everything, if you\u2019re married, I don\u2019t understand your need for public displays of affection in a crowded concert venue. Just because your kids aren\u2019t around to walk in on you, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve magically become invisible. The least you could do is buy me a new toy to distract me from your cuddling. Or foot my phone bill this month so I can spend the next few hours live-tweeting my disgust.\n\n3) The Blunderers\n\nthe blunderers\n\nYou constantly step on my toes or you lean so far back I end up with your hair in my mouth, even though I was standing here first and literally have not moved. You\u2019re the enthusiastic hand-talker who narrowly avoids smacking me when you\u2019re chatting with your friend. Or you\u2019re the genius wearing a heavy backpack in the middle of the pit (what are you even carrying with you?) so that I end up with a rash burn on my stomach because being stuck in a sweaty crowd isn\u2019t uncomfortable enough without having canvas rubbing against you. I understand that you don\u2019t always have a choice when it comes to accidentally bumping into people, especially in a small venue, but there\u2019s a difference between touching-me-because-there\u2019s-not-a-lot-space and the concert-going equivalent of spreading yourself across two seats on the bus, making everyone else uncomfortable in the process. Do I have personal space issues? Yes. Do I also believe that you should respect the people around you and avoid touching strangers if at all possible? Heck yes.\n\n4) The Zonked\n\nthe zonked\n\nI can\u2019t argue with the fact that music and alcohol go together like chicken wings and hot sauce, but I don\u2019t get the point of drinking heavily at a show, unless you like having to pee fifteen times before the headliners go on. So if you\u2019re drinking, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re having the time of your life\u2026I just don\u2019t want to feel your Fireball-y breath on my face when you end up stumbling in my path at some point. Or when you drop the can, spraying overpriced beer everywhere, because it\u2019s too heavy for your drunk-butt to hold, and I have to wipe PBR off the back of my legs\u2026or my sneakers which are already soaking up the alcohol by the time you realize what happened. I should also note that those of you who spend the night zonked are usually the biggest culprits of the other three categories, though you probably don\u2019t notice how annoying you are since you\u2019re living in a bubble made of alcohol fumes.\n\n5) The Periscopers\n\nthe periscopers\n\nMaybe you suffer from short-term memory loss and want a way to capture a concert in a tangible way. Or maybe you genuinely think you\u2019re going to watch a grainy, shaky video at some point in your down time even though the audio will be terrible because everyone around you was screaming and the amount of jostling will give you motion sickness. Either way, your phone is blocking everyone\u2019s view and, unlike you, we won\u2019t get a chance to relive the night after uploading the photos onto a computer. I\u2019m totally guilty of taking pictures at a show (how else will my Instagram followers know what I\u2019ve been up to?), but filming the whole thing on your iPhone\u2014or worse, your giant iPad so we feel like we\u2019re at a drive-in\u2014is taking you away from the experience. And, more importantly, it\u2019s stopping me from getting that one clear shot of the stage. I just love seeing other people\u2019s phones in my photos, don\u2019t you?\n\nIt might seem petty to let these little things bother us\u2014we\u2019re at a show to have a good time and who are we to dictate how others behave in public?\u2014but when you spend half the night sneezing because that one girl\u2019s hair kept flicking you in the face no matter how much you shifted away, or feel personally victimized by the amount of face-sucking you had to witness, I think you\u2019re allowed to Hulk out at the next person who collides with you despite the three feet of empty space around you.",

        "text":"The difficulty in selecting who should be considered among the 10 best American child actors lies in determining who should be considered a child actor. Technically, teenage actors are child actors. But, teens often play roles that entail adult themes. Accordingly, this list of ten best American child actors includes only children who achieved fame during their preteen years. These actors may have had significant teen careers that merit consideration, but their later success was built on popularity from performances when they were indisputably children.\u00a0\n\n  1. Shirley Temple. Temple is easily the best American child actor in movie history. Her career began at the age of three. Blockbuster movies such as \u201cBright Eyes,\u201d \u201cHeidi,\u201d \u201cCurly Top,\u201d \u201cThe Littlest Rebel,\u201d and many others made her an enormous studio asset. Temple's adult movie career faltered, but she flourished as a public servant.\n\n  2. Jackie Cooper. Cooper's big break came when he was selected to play in the \u201cOur Gang\u201d comedies. Cooper received an Oscar nomination at the age of nine for his performance in the movie \u201cSkippy.\u201d His achieved his greatest fame as an American child actor for his numerous collaborations with actor Wallace Berry, particularly \u201cThe Champ\u201d and \u201cTreasure Island.\u201d As an adult, Copper has done some acting, but he has really made his mark as a talented entertainment executive.\n\n  3. Ron Howard. Howard was an integral part of the success of \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201d He also appeared in movies and starred in the TV show \u201cHappy Days.\u201d Eventually, he pursued his dream of directing and producing movies and became one of the most successful filmmakers in Hollywood.\n\n  4. Macaulay Culkin. Culkin rose to fame starring in the blockbuster hits \u201cHome Alone,\u201d and \u201cHome Alone 2: Lost in New York.\u201d As an adult, he has sometimes struggled in both his personal and professional lives.\n\n  5. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Although most lists of American child actors count these two twins separately, their careers are so intertwined that they should be listed together. Both girls began their careers as infants on the popular and long-running TV show \u201cFull House.\u201d As adults, they have demonstrated business savvy by parlaying the Olsen brand into a multimillion dollar fortune.\n\n  6. Drew Barrymore. Barrymore is part of a famous acting family and began acting at age three. Her role in \u201cE.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\u201d made her famous, and she has continued to work steadily up till the present day. As a child, Drew led a chaotic life, but has had a successful adult career as an actress, director, and producer.\n\n  7. Jerry Mathers. Mathers played the title character in the popular TV show \u201cLeave It to Beaver.\u201d He has done some acting work since the show ended, but Mathers has primarily focused on successful business endeavors. Nearly 50 years after the last new episode was broadcast, \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d is still in reruns despite being filmed in black and white, and Mathers is still an international celebrity.\n\n  8. Natalie Wood. Natalie Wood had a very successful career as an American child actor that transitioned into an equally successful adult film career. Her breakout role was the little girl in \u201cMiracle on 34th Street.\u201d Even as a child, directors recognized and commented on Natalie's consummate professionalism.\n\n  9. Gary Coleman. Coleman became famous for his role as Arnold on the hit TV show, \u201cDiff'rent Strokes.\u201d Unfortunately, he never achieved success as an adult in either his personal or professional life. Eventually, a lifelong kidney condition took his life at a relatively young age.\n\n  10. Jackie Coogan. Best known today for his role as Uncle Fester in \u201cThe Addams Family,\u201d Coogan was arguably the biggest American child actor of the silent film era. His big break came when Charlie Chaplain selected him to co-star in his movie, \u201cThe Kid.\u201d Coogan sued his parents after they stole his film earnings, resulting in laws to protect American child actors. As a young adult, Coogan allegedly participated in the lynching of two men who kidnapped and murdered one of his best friends.",

        "text":"Must Watch Episodes from Star Trek: The Next Generation Part 2\n\nMust Watch Episodes from Star Trek: The Next Generation Part 2\n\nA while back I made a list of what I consider to be the best episodes from the original Star Trek TV series.\n\nAt the time, it was suggested that I should continue the list with my favorite Star Trek: the Next Generation episodes. After a lot of hemming and hawing, I managed to slim the list down to 15 total episodes worthy of distinction. My top 5 Next Generation episodes of all time can be found over here.\n\nThis list falls into 3 categories: the best of the best, episodes that present interesting subjects in interesting ways, and episodes that tackle issues of the day.\n\nThis week\u2019s list involves interesting topics presented in interesting ways. Star Trek is at its peak when it presents a mystery and challenges the characters to solve it. There are tons of popular episodes that fall into this category (such as when they birthed a baby space whale, then needed to wean it). But of all those dozens of episodes, these are the ones I like best.\n\n6. The Offspring (Season 3, Episode 16)\n\nThe plot: Data decides to reproduce. Rather than finding a mate, he passes on his form and knowledge in a way that improves upon his original designs. This takes the form of a young woman named Lal. But when Lal unexpectedly experiences emotions (something Data is incapable of), her development takes a turn.\n\nWhy it\u2019s on the list: True confession: I used to hate Star Trek. Here\u2019s what happened when I decided to give it a try. I turned on the TV to a man standing in white space. Some guy then informed him that he was in Hell. PASS, I announced and changed the channel.\n\nFast forward several years. I\u2019m sitting on the couch surfing channels for a way to spend Saturday night. I have a passing familiarity with Star Trek from popular culture at the time. I see Data striding a corridor with Councilor Troi announcing that he has decided to become a father.\n\nRobot dad? thinks I. This sounds interesting! And that\u2019s how a single episode of Star Trek made me a fan forever. Yes, indeed, this episode is single-handedly responsible for making me a Star Trek nut. After seeing this, I regularly watched TNN\u2019s 8 hour Next Generation blocks every Sunday to catch up with the series.\n\nWhy I love it: It\u2019s a reoccurring theme throughout Next Generation that Data is more of a thing than a person. Even after winning his autonomy, the issue keeps popping up. This time, when he creates offspring (an idea that is fascinating on its own), the Federation pops in to ask but is she really your daughter or do we actually own her?\n\nI spent so much time thinking about this episode (and how it devastated me) that I almost made it number 2 on my list. I bumped it this far down because, let\u2019s be honest, Next Generation has a lot of gems.\n\n7. Cause and Effect (Season 5, Episode 18)\n\nThe plot: While responding to an odd anomaly, the crew end up on a collision course with a ship out of time. They attempt to evade, but fail, which catches the ship in a time loop.\n\nWhy it\u2019s on the list: It\u2019s something of a tradition (I think) for every science fiction or fantasy show to do a Groundhog\u2019s Day episode. Though I think my all time favorite might be the Xena one. But I find the method for solving the loop used by the Next Generation crew to be particularly interesting. Which is why the episode is on this list.\n\nWhy I love it: This episode follows a familiar framework: the day is repeating. In order to escape the loop, the crew have to fulfill a specific goal. In this case, the goal is to avoid exploding when it collides with the other ship caught in the same loop. This means the outcome of the episode is not going to be a surprise. You know from a the start that at the end of the episode, the ship will escape the loop \u2013 and not before.\n\nTherefore, in order to make the episode entertaining, it has to use different aspects of production and storytelling to keep the audience invested in what\u2019s happening on the screen. I think the makers of the show did a spectacular job of that. I have seen this episode numerous times and never grown tired of it.\n\nSomething a little different for this clip\u2026 here\u2019s a side by side of the various attempts to escape the loop. Can you spot the differences?\n\n8. Clues (Season 4, Episode 14)\n\nThe plot: The Enterprise crew awaken from a short period of unconsciousness apparently after traveling through a wormhole. But as time goes on, they notice lots of little discrepancies about the missing time and start to pool their resources to solve the mystery.\n\nWhy it\u2019s on the list: It\u2019s all in the title for this one really. It\u2019s a good old fashioned mystery. The plot is interesting. The show provides a steady drip feed of new information to keep the mystery interesting, and it\u2019s tons of fun to speculate about what\u2019s actually happening the first time you watch the episode.\n\nWhy I love it: I was never a huge fan of mystery novels. As a kid, I tried to read the Clue books but I could never figure out who done it. Still, when I encounter a really well put-together mystery that doesn\u2019t frustrate me, I appreciate it. (Knives out, anyone?) This episode certainly clarifies.\n\nI\u2019m not going to include a clip from this one because I really don\u2019t want to spoil anyone\u2019s first watch.\n\n9. Sarek (Season 3, Episode 23)\n\nThe plot: Spock\u2019s father, Sarek comes aboard the Enterprise to perform his final mission as an ambassador. Despite the Vulcan reputation for emotionless composure, he suffers an angry outburst. Sarek, it turns out, has Bendii syndrome, a Vulcan condition that makes it difficult for him to control both his emotions and his telepathy. But Captain Picard is determined to help him make his mission a success.\n\nWhy it\u2019s on the list: Back on the first part of this list, I mentioned a few times that my favorite episodes are carried by the skill of a particular actor. Well, between Mark Lenard and Patrick Stewart, this episode is phenomenal. Whenever there is spill over between two characters, actors have to perform some complicated mental gymnastics in order to nail their portrayal. And both the leads are in top form for this one.\n\nWhy I love it: I like character-centric stories. (Those are the kinds of stories I write, so that\u2019s probably obvious.) This story also tangentially involves one of my other favorite Star Trek characters, Spock, since the relationship between him and his father comes up over the course of this episode. Honestly, I just feel like it\u2019s really touching story. So get ready for that.\n\n10. Force of Nature (Season 7, Episode 9)\n\nThe plot: A pair of sibling scientists set out to prove to the Enterprise crew that warp travel is putting their planet at high risk. The reason? Warp travel is tearing a rift in the nearby space, and they expect the situation to worsen.\n\nWhy it\u2019s on the list: We\u2019re actually moving into the \u2018tackling relevant issues\u2019 section of this list at this point. The wiki page for this Next Generation episode is shockingly sparse. It was my opinion when I first saw it that it was a roundabout way of tackling the issue of global climate change. And I still feel that way today. It\u2019s conclusion is also shockingly similar to our behavior in reality, which I feel drives the point home.\n\nWhy I love it: Art imitates reality and makes a point. Science offers irrefutable proof that damage is being caused by convenience, but people don\u2019t want to hear that so they close their eyes. That tragic realism makes me nod and shake my head in turns. In some ways, I feel like the spear tip of this episode is even sharper today than it was two decades ago.\n\nOne Reply to \u201cMust Watch Episodes from Star Trek: The Next Generation Part 2\u201d\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
