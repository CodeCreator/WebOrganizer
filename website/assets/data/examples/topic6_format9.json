        "text":"About these ads\n\nDC Characters In Need of the\u00a0Spotlight\n\n\nTwo years ago DC Comics made a dramatic and controversial movie by rebooting its entire line of comics under the banner of The New 52. The move attracted a whole new audience to their product as they not only made their comics friendly to beginners but also diversified their product with a new focus on; horror, fantasy, and westerns. We are now two years into this new era of the beloved comics publisher and yet there have been many beloved characters who have yet to appear or have shown up only in brief glimpses. These heroes and villains may not have the popularity which comes with having an \u201cS\u201d or a bat on their chest but they do have devoted fanbases who want to see them.\n\nWally West\/The Flash:\u00a0True Barry Allen may be the most iconic speedster to ever put on the red wllywstand yellow, but an entire generation of fanboys (myself included) are for more familiar with his former sidekick, Wally West. Under the famous runs of writers such as; Mark Waid and Geoff Johns we fell in love with West as he grew into his own in the Flash legacy. During\u00a0Flashpoint\u00a0we saw the character die at the hands of his arch nemesis, Captain Cold and since then there has been no sign of him. Out of all the characters in their pantheon, DC must realize that Wally West is the one most fans are clamoring to see.\n\nThe Question:\u00a0Like the Loch Ness Monster and Sasquatch, this mysterious investigator has been sighted in brief glimpses around the dark alleys of the DC Universe lately, hinting that he is part of a larger story at work. Largely ignored throughout most of his time on the printed pages, his appearances in the animated series,\u00a0Justice League Unlimited\u00a0turned the obscure hero into a fan favorite and his final moments in the weekly series,\u00a052, further endeared him to comic fans. Hopefully as the larger story that he seems tied up in grows, we will see the trench coat clad vigilante spouting off his famous eccentricities.\n\nStephanie Brown\/Batgirl\/Spoiler:\u00a0The teenage hero everyone hated, until she took on the mantle of\u00a0Batgirl\u00a0under the pen of\u00a0Bryan Q Miller. Miller succeeded where so many others have failed in showing the readers who Brown was and why we should care about her. Many fans have had a hard time accepting the fact that she is simply gone, just as they had grown attached to her and wish to see her swing across the dark skies of Gotham once again. While few are suggesting that she returns to the\u00a0Batgirl mantle, especially since Gail Simone is blowing everybody away in her current run, perhaps a return to her\u00a0Spoiler\u00a0persona is in order; and given her chemistry with current Batgirl Barbara Gordon perhaps she can take on a fun sidekick role.\n\nBlue_Beetle_by_Miketron2000Ted Kord:\u00a0Before Jaime Reyes, rediscovered the scarab,\u00a0Blue Beetle\u00a0was a geeky underdog who sought to use his resources for justice. Often looked down upon as simply being\u00a0Boost Gold\u2019s\u00a0best bud, their is no doubt that the character had a lot of heart; which he proved in the lead up to the\u00a0Infinite Crisis. With the relatively clean slate the creators at DC now have a return is not outside the realm of possibility. Though the role of Blue Beetle is already filled, Kord is an interesting enough character he can stand on his own out of costume.\n\nJustice League International:\u00a0A series that ended far too early. The positive is that many of the aspects that made this team so beloved have appeared in the new,\u00a0Justice League of America\u00a0series, but it is not the same. Showcasing the best elements of obscure characters such as; Booster Gold, Vixen, Fire, and Ice. The chemistry of the team members along with some great stories endeared them to fans and\u00a0hopefully\u00a0we can see them pop up again soon.\n\nRaven:\u00a0This staple character of the\u00a0Teen Titans\u00a0oozed cool more than any other teen hero in the DC Universe. Originally slated to appear in the current Titans series, plans were changed as DC seems to be positioning her for a grand scale story arc involving her father\u00a0Trigon. But there is no doubt that this new incarnation of the Teen Titans would greatly benefit in the eyes of readers by having this beloved character return to the team. If need be should could easily be seen splitting her time between the Titans and the\u00a0Justice League Dark.\n\nElongated Man & Sue:\u00a0This couple broke fans\u2019 hearts with their tragic arc in\u00a0Identity Crisis\u00a0then later in\u00a052. With fans having gained a new appreciation for this couple it seems to be the perfect time to ralphandsueput them back in the spotlight in this new rebooted version of the DC Universe. With famous couples such as; Lois and Clark and Barry and Iris being split up in the world of the 52; readers are in need of a strong super hero couple. Much like Lois Lane, Sue Dibney is no damsel in distress as she is often seen right alongside her husband and his Justice League cohorts. And Elongated Man having the combination of Batman\u2019s intelligence and resolved paired with Plasitc Man\u2019s powers, would make him a great addition to the super heroes of the DC 52.\n\nRay Palmer\/The Atom:\u00a0True Ray Palmer was in\u00a0Frankenstein Agent of SHADE\u00a0and a woman under the alter ego of\u00a0The Atom\u00a0has recently joined the ranks of the\u00a0Justice League\u00a0it is still not the same.\u00a0I have always had a soft spot for this particular pint sized character. Perhaps he can be recruited by the\u00a0Justice League of America\u00a0for his intellect, which could be a great asset.\n\nIcon & Rocket:\u00a0One of the more remarkable things about the New 52 is how they successfully integrated characters from DC\u2019s other lines of comics into the DC Universe proper. Now we can see a world where Vertigo\u2019s John Constantine and Wildstorm\u2019s Grifter rub elbow\u2019s with Green Lantern; but many comic fans are wondering about the heroes from another line of comics that once stemmed from DC, Milestone. Aside from a brief series starring the ever popular\u00a0Static Shock, the characters from the city of Dakota have been strangely absent. During his run on\u00a0Justice League of America, Milestone co-creator\u00a0Dwayne McDuffie\u00a0proved that his characters could add a lot of excitement in the DCU.\u00a0Icon\u00a0and his sidekick\u00a0Rocket\u00a0were easily the most intriguing characters to come from the era of Milestone Media and would be a welcome edition to the New 52. Seeing how one of the purposes for the reboot was to make their characters more contemporary, this duo could easily bring a great deal of social awareness to comics that could grab headlines as the\u00a0politically\u00a0opposed pair offered up their takes on the world.\n\nI know there are many more heroes and villains fans wish to see return to the pages of DC Comics.

        "text":"Top 5 NYE Extravaganzas\n\nBy on December 28, 2012\n\nGiven the world didn\u2019t end a la Mayan Calendar conundrum, plan a night to remember and ring in 2013 in style; whatever your style is.\n\nMasked Avengers\n\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot? In memoriam of Gossip Girl, throw yourself an outrageous Upper East Sider a la scandalous TV series. Or, head to Toronto\u2019s upper east side for some masquerade fun at Yorkville\u2019s Club V. Come for the free mask, stay for the midnight champagne toast (F.Y.I.: FREE masquerade mask for the first 400 people). Completing the Gossip Girl\/NYC experience is the live countdown from Manhattan\u2019s Times Square.\n\nBowl the night away\n\nIn complete contrast to a girlie Gossip Girl evening, this one\u2019s more guy-centric, and aptly named THE DUDE\u2019S NEW YEAR\u2019S: THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Usher in the new year with a screening of the Coen Bros\u2019 cult classic at Bloor Cinema. A Lebowski-themed party, filled with White Russians, AND bowling await you.\n\nLet the sky fall\n\nCelebrate the 23rd Bond story, and have a Skyfall soiree in honour of the longest-running film franchise in history. Here\u2019s hoping your party is a smashing successful like this film was at the box office this year. The heavily anticipated installment in the bond series drips with luxury, and sets the tone for an evening of extravagance. Tell your agents to come dressed as Bond, James Bond, or one of the many bodacious Bond girls. Naturally, you\u2019ll serve shaken, not stirred vodka martinis while Adele sings in the background.\n\nSide effect: Your get-together will get everyone geared up for TIFF Bell Lightbox\u2019s Designing 007: Fifty Years of Bond Style which debuts in January. It\u2019s only the largest and most comprehensive exhibit dedicated to the British spy.\n\n\nMackenzie House (AKA the home turned museum of William Lyon Mackenzie: TO\u2019s first Mayor) is hosting a Hogmanay! You know, the Scottish word for the last day of the year, and the celebration of the new year? It\u2019s perfect seeing as Scotsman Robert Burns\u2019 Auld Lang Syne is synonymous with NYE. Traditional Scottish music, food and festivities are yours to enjoy by candlelight.\n\nP.S.: Pre-registration is required.\n\nCake, Cake, Cake, Cake\n\nHave your cake and drink it too. With a wide selection of sweet (& cheap) drinks to choose from, it doesn\u2019t have to be your birthday to take advantage of these deals. Cake has some calorie-rich group rates that should not be over-looked, including mixers, party favours, cake platters, and much more!\n\nAbout KimberlyLamontagne\n\nOne Comment\n\n  1.

        "text":"[01\/09\/08 - 02:33 PM]\nThe 50 Best Episodes of 2007: #30-21\nBy Brian Ford Sullivan (TFC)\n\nIt's time once again for our annual list of the 50 best episodes of the past year. (For previous lists check the links to the right.)\n\nAs usual we'll be counting down 10 episodes a day until we get to the best episode of 2007 on Friday. The episodes on this list are based on nominations by myself and regular visitors to the site as to what we think the standout moments of the year were.\n\nWe also wanted to take this time to tell you about WHY WE WRITE, a fantastic new blog created by \"Eureka's\" Charlie Craig and Thania St. John. It's a collection of essays by some of TV's brightest minds about... you guessed it, why they write. And as luck would have it, the essayists who've contributed thus far are behind many of the episodes on this year's list.\n\nOur \"50 Best Episodes\" feature is designed as a celebration of TV's finest hours (and half-hours) so we're thrilled to give you a window into the minds of those who created them. With that mind, as the countdown continues, look for periodic excerpts from some of the WHY WE WRITE essays. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!\n\nAs always, our list will differ from the ones you sent in - but that's half the fun! So sit back, relax and enjoy the countdown!\n\n30. \"friday night lights: let's get it on\" (nbc)\n(originally aired: november 2, 2007)\n\nIt really is a testament to this show that the big moments - I genuinely thought Jason Street would be lost in the ocean forever after leaping from the booze cruise, only to have it turn out to be his first step back to peace with his condition - and the little ones - everything from Eric trying to woo Tami back to the bedroom, Saracen regaining his self-respect and Tyra breaking Landry's heart - feel equally natural and effortless.\n\n29. \"the knights of prosperity: pilot\" (abc)\n(originally aired: january 3, 2007)\n\nSeriously - Mick Jagger buttering his popcorn with a Rolling Stones tongue statue, the red 1970s-era T-shirts, Rockefeller asking if there will be cookies, using a Jewish supply store as their clubhouse, Gourishanker describing his love of a certain female organ - what wasn't there to love about this show?\n\n28. \"andy barker, pi: fairway, my lovely\" (nbc)\n(originally aired: march 22, 2007)\n\nI don't know about you, but the image of Peter Allen Vogt running in slow motion was burned into my brain for about a week after this episode aired - and I laughed every time I thought about it.\n\n27. \"how i met your mother: something blue\" (cbs)\n(originally aired: may 14, 2007)\n\nAnother master class in the show's trademark storytelling technique - this time involving how Ted and Robin's relationship unraveled, all set against the backdrop of Marshall and Lily's wedding. Even better - it actually tied together a half-dozen or so throwaway scenes from the past few episodes.\n\n26. \"chuck: pilot\" (nbc)\n(originally aired: september 24, 2007)\n\n60 minutes, well 44 and change without commercials, of geeky heartfelt fun.\n\n25. \"it's always sunny in philadelphia: the gang finds a dumpster baby\" (fx)\n(originally aired: september 13, 2007)\n\nAfter reading the episode title we knew this would be a \"Sunny\" classic.\n\n24. \"csi: crime scene investigation: living doll, part 1\" (cbs)\n(originally aired: may 17, 2007)\n\nThe fruit of its season long, unexpectedly riveting \"miniature killer\" arc, this episode defined the word cliffhanger as the fate of Sara Sidel - not to mention actress Jorja Fox's involvement with the show - was left up in the air.\n\n\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" executive producer Carol Mendelsohn on why she writes: \"In high school, one of my teachers took an informal poll. She asked our class, \ufffdHow many hours of TV do you watch a week?\ufffd I watched 49 hours. From the moment I got up in the morning to the moment I went to sleep. TV was my best friend. In study hall, while others were studying, I was conjuring up episodes of the Big Valley and The Virginian in my head. I could hear the voices of my favorite characters. And when a line I made up didn't sound right, I'd rewrite it. Some things never change. I never told anyone about these 'voices'. I didn't want to be labeled as a crazy. It wasn't until I got my first staff job that I confessed my eccentricity. And that's when I discovered that someone else heard voices, too. Writers hear voices. Which is why I never think of writing as writing. To me, it's more like dictation. Which raises a fundamental question.

        "text":"The new BBC Three comedy shorts you don't want to miss\n\n\nBBC Three seems a lot funnier now that it's online.\n\nThat might be because it's drawn attention to the lack of good comedy on terrestrial TV, it might be because the move to online has allowed BBC Three to focus its attentions more than before, or it might be because BBC Three has been taking some of the internet's funniest characters and bringing them to a new audience.\n\nThe latest round of the channel's comedy shorts feature West Midland's comedian Guzzy Bear, known for his YouTube presence and hilarious Jurassic World saga last year, and Mandem on the Wall, also known for YouTube sketches and founding the Wall of Comedy. Here's why they're worth 15 minutes of your time.\n\n1. Man Like Mobeen\n\nGuzzy in Man Like Mobeen\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nTaking modern stereotypes of the Asian community and satirising them to within an inch of their life, Man Like Mobeen follows a former road man trying to change his ways and follow the Deen.\n\nCreator Ghulam Khan speaks directly to the viewer, opening with some politically charged statements in his familiar Brummy twang before we witness a day of his life. A day that doesn't end well.\n\nMobeen's former squad won't let him escape his past life so easily, and serious scenes common in communities around the country involving firearms, kidnappings and the like are given a touch of humour.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nIt's often said that TV fails to offer an authentic image of under-represented communities in the UK, because a lot of the time those communities aren't the ones creating the characters. That's not the case with Man Like Mobeen.\n\nThe caricatures Khan creates will be familiar to a lot of people, while others are so left field we can't imagine anyone having a similar direct experience.\n\nAnd despite this episode running just 11 minutes, Khan still managed to create it with a very good soundtrack.\n\n2. JPD\n\nJPD awkward moment helpline sketch\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nThe Mandem on the Wall guys bless us with a series of sketches and parodies, starting with a hilarious vision of Britain's first black swimming relay team that definitely didn't end how we thought it would, and finishing with an incredible parody of Westlife's Flying Without Wings.\n\nJPD is filled with original sketches that will remind you of moments in your own life, albeit some you'd hope to forget.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nThe comedy here feels like the type that's been missing for a while, and a natural successor to Little Miss Jocelyn and The Lenny Henry Show.\n\nBlack comedy doesn't dominate television like it once did. British greats like Desmond's came before Trouble, the defunct channel that offered content nobody has come close to since.\n\nYouTube has changed things slightly, and Mandem on the Wall are a part of that, but the quality of the sketches Jovielle, Percelle and Dee are able to put out is a benefit of collaborating with the BBC.\n\n3. A Brief History Of Tim\n\nTim in A Brief History of Tim\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nTim, a 26-year-old American living with cerebral palsy played by Tim Renkow, is a bit of a dick. He plays cruel pranks on people, is a bit homophobic, and has no qualms about lying about his mother's death. This episode features Tim royally messing up a job interview, not that he cares, and making able-bodied people feel uncomfortable.\n\nWhy should you watch it?\n\nDisabled people, like many other minorities, often suffer from a lack of visibility. A Brief History Of Tim shows a lot of the struggles people with cerebral palsy might go through each day, and this episode seems to particularly highlight a feeling of \"what's the point?\".\n\nBut more than that it does it in a way that shows disabled people are, guess what, just normal people. They can have personality flaws and ugly tendencies like everybody else, or they can be the opposite, like everybody else. It feels like A Brief History of Tim could reduce some of the stigma around how disabled people are perceived - and what better way to do it than with comedy?\n\nLimbo, Fail, and Pumped, all part of this BBC Three series, are also well worth a watch.",
