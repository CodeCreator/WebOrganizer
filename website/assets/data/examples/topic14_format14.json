We are putting weight on her and we just started seeing dapples THROUGH her winter fur!! She loves to be brushed and loves hanging out with my 12 year old son.\n\nMy Horse's Achievements: I am proud that she is alive - she is a rescued mare. She had problems with her mouth and looked skinny when I got her\n\nMy Horse's Favorite Treat: Sari and Suzie DIDNT KNOW WHAT APPLES WERE!! I cut up apples and she now LOVES them. She also LOVES the apple treats!\n\nMy Horse's Favorite Things To Do: She loves to EAT! We feed her several suppliments along with her feed - she looks forward to feeding time. She also LOVES to get brushed.\n\nPet Peeves: She tries everything we ask although she really dislikes being seperated from her rescue companion Susie Q.\n\nMy Horse's motto: Where is that feed bucket??\n\nMy Horse Home:\n\nCreate\/Edit Your Horse Stable\n\nMy Avatar:\n\nCreate\/Edit Your Own Avatar\n\nMy Awards\n\nHow We Met\n\nI got a call from an old aquantance - they could no longer care for a couple of horses - would I be interested?? YES! When we arrived to look at the girls, Suzie demanded my attention with her injured feet and I did not get to handle Miss Sari much. My 12 year old son worked with Sari and they fell in LOVE with each other! When I got home, we did a good going over of Miss Sari and found that she was in need of attention also - and ASAP. She had been packing food in her mouth for a while and was unable to chew without pain. My vet was due in the morning to address the issue of getting them up-to-date on shots and deworming. When we had a look in her mouth, she needed attention. She was not underweight due to poor food or high metabolism, her teeth were cutting her gums. It took my vet almost two hours with an electric file to get her teeth right. It took her a couple of weeks to get used to her new teeth. We have her on specialized feed also to help out with weight gain. I am SO proud of her and all she has come through since she took us into her herd!! She is truely a PRINCESS!!.\n\nMy Horse Stats\n\nI've had 3475 friends visit me.\n\nI'm the 107th member on\n\n38 friends have voted for me since I joined Club Horse!\n\nMy Family Photos\n\nMore Photos\nRoll over photos to view in frame.\n\nMy Horse Blog\n\nIn an effort to improve our website for our visitors, we will be changing some of our service providers.

The morning after I had gotten her home, I had my favorite vet come out and look at her. Her shots had been brought up to date, she was dewormed and her teeth were floated. It took a while because it had been several years since they had been done. She was packing food on her worst side. She loves to eat now and looks forward to her twice daily feed rations. She has a very nice looking rump to her now and in the 6 months we've owned her, she has blossomed under the attention of my son - he loves her and she him!\n\nCome visit me, Sebastian, Sari (pronounced Sir-i), My Cruisen Dun, Storm, Cheza Bailey & Suzie.\n\n01\/11\/2007 01:46.22 PM Report This Comme...

He and his family have been in California residential real estate for over 40 years. In fact, his own passion for the business developed at a young age while working at his father\u2019s office. There, he learned the art of sales which led to personal success buying, renovating and selling multiple properties. This experience has taught him where to buy, how to negotiate and how to build an investment for the most discriminating clients. Kennon formed RARE Properties in 2003, Tom Davila joined forces in 2007, and soon, the group ranked among the top teams in Los Angeles. Well known to TV audiences, Kennon has starred on HGTV\u2019s \"Selling LA,\" was a judge on \"Brother vs. Brother\" and hosted Bravo's \"Bidding War.\" Prior to real estate, Kennon worked in marketing at Twentieth Century Fox and in the fashion industry for retailers that include Giorgio Armani, Barneys New York and GUESS. Born and raised in California, Kennon attended college in Santa Barbara. A believer in giving back, he has served on the board for the Otis School of Art and Design, assisted in 3 Divine Design charitable events and in an Academy Awards event for The AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\n\nSort Portfolio: All\u00a0\u00a0 Active\u00a0\u00a0 Pending\u00a0\u00a0 Sold\u00a0\u00a0 Leased\u00a0\u00a0 Off Market",

        "text":"Fred Lussow\n\nMobile: 847.207.5284 | Fax: 847-241-0009\u00a0| Email:\n\nI was born and raised in Arlington Heights where I still reside. I love it because it\u2019s far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city but it\u2019s only a short train ride away. I truly get the best of both worlds. I attended Hersey High School where I played football and basketball and I went on to graduate with a degree in marketing from Northeastern Illinois University.\n\nI\u2019m a huge Chicago sports fan: Cubs (this is finally the year!), Bears, Bulls, and Blackhawks. I come from a family of coaches and educators, so I love watching and attending all levels of sporting events. I enjoy golf even though I\u2019m not exactly what you would call \u201cgood.\u201d It\u2019s the few perfect shots per round that keep me hooked and coming back for more. I grew up spending my summers in Northern Wisconsin and, more recently, Door County, so I love the outdoors and being out on the water.\n\nWorking with first time home buyers gives me an opportunity to be involved in such an important part of someone else\u2019s life. Buying a new home, especially for the first time, can be stressful and overwhelming. I believe that with my friendly and confident demeanor, I can relieve the pressure and guide you through the process while also making it fun and exciting.\n\nSee Below to Read Some of Fred\u2019s Rave Reviews!\n\nBob & Kristy\n\n\u201cThis was our first experience buying a house. We came into the process with no idea what to expect. Fred could not have been more helpful in explaining the process, telling us what to look out for, and making sure we got exactly what we wanted during negotiations. Fred was honest in his assessments and thoughts while we viewed dozens of homes, and his insights led us to our perfect first home. Fred was knowledgeable, insightful, and extremely responsive, no matter the time of day. I recommend Fred to anybody looking to purchase a home!\u201d\u00a0\n\nLaura & Mike\n\n\u201cFred is extremely down to earth and genuine. He was a straightforward negotiator, a strong, true advocate for our best interests and a thoughtful, honest friend.\u201d\n\nHilary and Bryan\n\nAfter years of living in apartments in the city, my husband and I decided it was time to move img_4601to the suburbs after we had our first child. We found an amazing home in Mount Prospect that we both love, and we are excited to raise our family here.\n\nWe owe that to our Realtor, Fred Lussow.\n\nOur home search began a long way from where we ended up, but thanks to Fred we were able to figure out exactly what we wanted \u2013 and where to find it. Throughout the process, Fred served not just as a professional advocate, but also as an insightful and caring adviser. He listened to our wish list and provided his own ideas without being pushy.\n\nBecause my husband and I were first-time homebuyers, there was a lot we didn\u2019t know. Fred provided us with easy-to-understand materials to help us navigate the process and explained the complexities to us so nothing came as a surprise. He was patient with us and well prepared, even after viewing at least 30 listings. His goal was clear: He wanted us to find a home that would give us everything we needed.\n\nFred\u2019s natural ability to work well and communicate with everyone around him served us well as buyers.\n\nMost importantly: We have worked with other Realtors in the past and did not purchase homes from them because we didn\u2019t feel they had our best interests at heart. Other Realtors made us feel like a number or part of a quota they needed to fill as quickly as possible to make a commission. Fred was the exact opposite. He made us feel like our home buying process was his most important and primary focus from beginning to end.\n\nI would strongly recommend Fred Lussow to other homebuyers in the area. We found an amazing house, and I don\u2019t see us moving any time soon \u2026 but if we ever need another home, we will work with Fred..\u201d\n\nHi, do you have any questions that I can answer for you?",

He was my Dog when I was younger, and now I still have him in my new family. He loves swimming in the lake, and chewing on sticks. His age doesn't stop him, it seems to make him go on even further. Dallas is quite the adventure in my life, and I love him even more for doing that.\n\nView Profile\n\n\nBeau is the crazy one in the family. She is constantly running around, and is hardly ever sitting still. She loves to go for long hikes, play with her socks, and go swimming in the lake. Beau is always with Dallas. They are best friends, and always will be.\n\nView Profile\n\n\nRayna is my little mutt. We found her on the side of the road, clinging on to her life. When she came home with two other wagging tails, she adjusted perfectly. She's my little cuddle bug, and without her, I wouldn't be the same!\n\nView Profile\n\n\nJazzy is the newest addition to the fur crew. He is highly curious, and has an active life. He is always clinging on to his sister Beau, and trampling all over her. His favorite things to do are to run through the grass, and swim in the lake. Jazzy has finally completed, the Dogs in my life.\n\nView Profile\nMay 2015\n  \u2022 Sun\n  \u2022 Mon\n  \u2022 Tue\n  \u2022 Wed\n  \u2022 Thu\n  \u2022 Fri\n  \u2022 Sat\n\nFeatured Puppies From the Past\n\nRecently Added Puppies\n\nLukin Chloe Dog Phoebe Snow Peppercorn Jasper Wilson Wilson Ollie Teddy Tyson\nMore Puppies\n\nPuppy Up Your Blog\n\nDaily Puppy WidgetBox Widget Get this widget from Widgetbox",
