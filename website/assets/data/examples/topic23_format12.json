The church\u2019s twin towers rise 65 feet in the air, topping the main church which sits upon a high hill that overlooks the city.

Situated in the north-east of the island, the 2km long beach of white sand is\u00a0 a rainbow of beach umbrella colors each representing a different restaurant.\nOrient Beach\nThe famous \u2018clothing optional\u2019 naturalist beach at the very north of the beach is safe from the new development and more popular than ever and well worth a visit.\n\nAt the other end of the beach there are a range of water sport kiosk\u2019s with jet ski\u2019s and wind surfing to paragliding and kayaking gear. Along with beach sports like volleyball and beach badminton gear for hire. Training is given by the friendly staff.\nOrient Beach\nThe gently sloping shore line is always a hive of activity with swimmers and sand castle building. The Green Key reef, to the north, keeps most of the Atlantic swell\u00a0 at bay and being a marine reserve makes the snorkeling wonderful.\n\nThe 5 main restaurants cater for all tastes and pockets all serving delicious\u00a0 cocktails and local beers all day.\nFor lunch there is a massive choice of simple burger and fries for $10, $10-$15 buffets, al-a-carte $30-50 or even a $100 gourmet specialist menu, but whatever you\u00a0 choose, the food will be delicious with a Caribbean\/French twist. Served on the beach whilst lounging on a sun bed or in the brightly coloured covered bars or\u00a0 restaurants. Most bars don\u2019t charge for the sun beds when you buy a bucket of beer. Reserving prime waterfront loungers can cost up to $40 at some places.\nOrient Beach\nAfter watching the sunset on the beach with a relaxing cocktail, a short walk takes you to the Provence style square in \u2018Le Village\u2019 it\u2019s kid friendly and a wonderful\u00a0 place to enjoy your evening meal in one of the small restaurants that surround the\u00a0 park. On most nights during the season there is live music in the square.\n\nThe Charming Village of Grand Case\n\nPicture a quietly lapping, mile long, white sandy beach with azure colored water with Anguilla and the Creole Rock in the distance.\nThat is the beach at Grand Case.\nBefore tourism, the local\u2019s made thier living from fishing and salt extraction and being self sufficient by growing plantain, callaloo\u00a0 and corn and much, much more. The\nvillage was the epitome of French Caribbean style. After tourism arrived the creole houses either side of the narrow main road transformed themselves into restaurants, boutiques, art shops and small hotels, without losing that wonderful laid back atmosphere.\nDuring the day the main road is quite quiet, with a few boutiques selling stylish apparel and souvenirs. A few restaurants are open for the lunch time trade.\nGrand Case turquoise beach\nThe beach is one of the calmest on the island with a gentle slope so it\u2019s safe for kids.\nThe old concrete pier is popular with the locals for line fishing and for the kids it\u2019s a great for jumping off.\nThe sleepy, ex fishing village explodes into life in the evening when all the restaurants are open. It\u2019s this time that gave the village the title of \u2018Gourmet Capital of the Caribbean\u2019 and it\u2019s well deserved. Every purse and taste is catered for.\nFrom January to March every Tuesday night sees the main street transformed into a carnival and craft fair . Cars are banned and the side\u2019s of the road are lined with stalls selling local drinks, food, art, handmade gifts and souvenirs. Then around 8 o\u2019clock the carnival starts with marching drum bands and carnival costumed dancing girls. There is live music all over the street.\n\nFor a taste of very local cuisine there is the Lolo\u2019s open for lunch and dinner. A group of outdoor BBQ based restaurants where you can smell and see your fresh local fish\/ rib\u2019s\/lobster\/chicken\/corn\/gambas being cooked. The Lolo\u2019s are on the beach side of the street so you have a wonderful view of Anguilla and Creole Rock. The other side of Lolo\u2019s is on the street so you have a great view of all the activities on that side too.\n\nThe whole length of the main street is scattered with great cafe\u2019s, restaurants and shops situated next to a beautiful beach so, no matter what time of day you visit you\u2019re sure to have a\u00a0 great time.",

        "text":"Quw\u2019utsun\u2019 Cultural and Conference Centre\n\nThe Quw\u2019utsun\u2019 Cultural and Conference Centre is situated on the Vancouver Island and features authentic artwork and crafts. It is located between Nanaimo and Victoria in Dunacan.\n\nThe Cowichan Nation\n\nThe centre is managed and owned by the Cowichan Tribe, which lives in the Cowichan Valley and the area of the Shawnigan Lake and Cowichan Lake. In fact, Cowichan is the English word for Quw\u2019utsun which means the warm lands. This is because of the long growing season and great climate in the area.\n\nThe Cowichan nation comprises of different bands, including Somena, Khenipsen, Quamichan, Koksilah, Kilpaulus, Clemclemaluts, and Comeakin. Some 3,900 people live in the area nowadays. The area of the reserve covers some 1,750 square kilometres. In addition to the Cultural and Conference Centre, other tribal managed businesses include the Millwork and Joinery Limited Partnership and the Forest Services Limited Partnership.\n\nBrief Intro\n\nVisitors of the centre enjoy an excellent view of the river and can visit several facilities such as the courtyard, Riverside Caf\u00e9 Patio, and Comeakin Hall. There are seven rooms in total, but the facilities are spacious and can accommodate many visitors. \u00a0The facility also features a theatre and a nice gift shop, offering traditional artwork for sale. Large events are also organized on a regular basis as it is a good location for events, whether a celebration, business meeting, ceremonial, etc. There is a total of 250 banquet and theatre seats while the meeting space covers an area of 9,400 sq. feet. The largest meeting room in the centre is 3,600 sq. feet.\n\nPlenty of parking spaces are available, and the centre is conveniently located right off the highway. The distance to the airport is just 80 km.\n\nIn 2016, there were talks of the centre closing doors due to the lack of funding and shortage of visitors.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nThere is plenty to do, whether travelling alone, with friends, or family. The centre offers activities and tours such as live demonstrations, displays, salmon barbeques, displays of traditional artwork, and more. Tour guides retell traditional spirit stories as well. They explain the hidden meanings of buildings, stories, and totems and their cultural and social significance. Visitors are welcome to try traditional food at the Riverwalk Caf\u00e9, including halibut, buffalo, venison, and rabbit. Candied salmon and fry bread are delicious. \u00a0Meals are served with a basket full of traditional freshly baked breads. The food is tasty and moderately priced, the d\u00e9cor is plain, and the service \u2013 good. Visitors have the opportunity to watch a short movie in the theatre as well (about 20 minutes).\n\nThe facilities at the Quw\u2019utsun\u2019 Cultural and Conference Centre combine traditional objects and artifacts with high-tech equipment. Native plants can be seen in the garden. The presentation by the Khowutzun Tzinquaw Dancers is a must see. The centre is also advertised as the world\u2019s largest carving house, and visitors are offered the opportunity to carve their own totem or watch artisans carve totems. The Cowichan tribes are also known for intricately knitted sweaters, and this is where you can buy one.\n\nThe centre is a great place for anyone who is interested in tribal and Native American culture, art, history, and tradition.\n\nFirst Nations in BC\n\nThe Cowichan people, also known as the tribes of the Warm Land, live in a reserve area in the Cowichan Valley on the Vancouver Island.\n\nCulture and Traditional Practices\n\nThe tribes occupied the region for thousands of years and were successful, to a large extent, in preserving their tradition, culture, heritage, art, and cultural and religious practices. Traditional crafts and practices include dancing, singing, canoe building, carving, and weaving.\n\nModern Realities and Income\n\nThe average annual income of Cowichan households is $20,000. About 75 percent are spent in the reserve area (locally). Given the below average income of many households, there are social assistance programs such as Social Development, which is tasked with administering funds for different target groups. Such target groups are, for example, children and women, students enrolled in Adult Basic and Adult Learning programs, and others. The agency is also responsible for guardian financial assistance and social assistance payments. The Individual Opportunities program also targets community members, and the main goal is to offer opportunities for community referral, employment counselling, workshops on different themes, as well as training and lifelong skill development. Ultimately, the goal of the program is to offer educational opportunities to help people get better chances of finding employment.\n\nGrants, bursaries, and scholarships are also available, for example, the Ts\u2019ewulhtun Health Centre Bursary, English Language Arts Scholarship, and Math\/Science Scholarship, among others. The Math\/Science Scholarship is offered to science and math students grades 8 to 10. Amounts vary from $100 to $300. Science and math students are welcome to apply for the Ts\u2019ewulhtun Health Centre Student Bursary as well. A total of 10 bursaries are offered, each worth $100. The deadline for some bursaries and scholarships is in June while for others \u2013 in November.\n\nOther Sources of Financing\n\nObvious sources of financing include standard products such as personal loans, mortgages, business loans, and business and personal credit cards. The Mold Program is yet another source of financing for First Nations people. Run as a home rehabilitation program in cooperation with the Bank of Montreal and Jacques Whitford, the goal is to offer assistance for reconstruction and rehabilitation. Measures target abated homes and include activities such as sealing plumbing leaks, repairing exhaust systems, repairing foundation cracks, and more. Regular inspections are scheduled to ensure that reconstruction and repair works meet design and safely standards. The program is financed mainly by the Cowichan tribes (62 percent) and the government (38 percent). Another program offered by the Canadian government is the First Nations On-Reserve Housing program which provides funding to First Nation communities across Canada. Funding is available in all territories and provinces, the only exception being British Columbia. Annual funding allocation is available, meaning that there is no need to apply. Other programs run by the government include the Income Assistance Program, ministerial loan guarantees, and the BC Housing Subsidy Program. Ministerial loan guarantees are used to help obtain loans for the purpose of renovating, purchasing, and building housing on reserves. The Income Assistance Program targets on-reserve individuals to help them meet basic expenses such as rent, utilities, clothing, and food. There are certain exclusions such as furniture, fashionable clothing, and other things that are not considered basic needs.",
