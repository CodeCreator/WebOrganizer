        "text":"Mike Quade\n\nFrom BR Bullpen\n\n\nGregory Mike Quade\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information[edit]\n\nMike Quade (pronounced: KWA-Dee) was appointed interim manager of the Chicago Cubs, taking over for Lou Piniella, after their game of August 22, 2010. He became the full-time manager after the season.\n\nQuade was drafted in the 22nd round of the 1979 amateur draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates and played five seasons of minor league ball, finishing with 269 walks against only 241 strikeouts. After playing under long-time minor league manager Johnny Lipon at Carolina League Salem in 1980, Quade returned at age 25 and 26 for additional Carolina League seasons under Lipon in Alexandria in 1982 and 1983, in order to continue his managerial apprenticeship.\n\nIn addition to managing for seventeen seasons in the minor leagues, Quade was a coach for the Jacksonville Expos in 1987 and the West Palm Beach Expos in 1988. He was the first base coach of the Oakland A's from 2000 to 2002. He joined the Chicago Cubs coaching staff for a short part of 2006 as the team's interim third base coach (temporarily taking the place of Chris Speier). Beginning in 2007, he became the club's third base coach on a full-time basis. The Cubs' manager, Lou Piniella, had announced that he would retire after the 2010 season. However, after taking a leave of absence to be with his ailing mother in August, he decided to retire earlier, leaving the team in the hands of Quade for the remainder of the year. The Cubs played very well under Quade, going 24-13, giving him a shot at the full-time managerial job in 2011. He was prefered to Cubs Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg, among others. Quade was let go as manager of the Cubs after a poor 2011 season that saw the team finish 20 games below .500. The Cubs brought in a new front office team of President Theo Epstein and General Manager Jed Hoyer who chose to bring in their own manager instead of keeping the incumbent Quade.\n\nQuade was a roving outfield\/baserunning coordinator for the New York Yankees in 2014. In 2015 he returned to managing with the Rochester Red Wings, the Minnesota Twins' top farm team.\n\nQuade and his wife, Tanya, were married on September 27, 1997.\n\nHighlights of his career include winning the 1991 John McHale Award, which was the Montreal Expos' award for excellence in player development. He was the manager of the year in his league in both 1991 and 1993, and in 1999 won the AAA World Series. He won his 1,000th game as a minor league manager on April 18 2004. He has also won the Dominican League Championship and Caribbean World Series and managed Team USA to 4th place in the 1999 Intercontinental Cup.\n\nPreceded by\nLou Piniella\nChicago Cubs Manager\nSucceeded by\nDale Sveum\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record[edit]\n\nYear Team League Record Finish Organization Playoffs Notes\n1985 Macon Pirates South Atlantic League 56-82 9th Pittsburgh Pirates\n1986 Macon Pirates South Atlantic League 54-84 9th Pittsburgh Pirates\n1989 Rockford Expos Midwest League 74-59 4th Montreal Expos Lost in 1st round\n1990 Rockford Expos Midwest League 56-80 12th Montreal Expos\n1991 Harrisburg Senators Eastern League 87-53 1st Montreal Expos Lost League Finals\n1992 Harrisburg Senators Eastern League 78-59 3rd Montreal Expos Lost in 1st round\n1993 Ottawa Lynx International League 73-69 5th Montreal Expos Lost in 1st round\n1994 Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons International League 62-80 10th Philadelphia Phillies\n1995 Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons International League 70-72 8th Philadelphia Phillies\n1996 West Michigan Whitecaps Midwest League 77-61 3rd Oakland A's League Champs\n1997 Huntsville Stars Southern League 77-62 1st Oakland A's Lost League Finals\n1998 Edmonton Trappers Pacific Coast League 76-67 8th Oakland A's\n1999 Vancouver Canadians Pacific Coast League 84-58 1st Oakland A's League Champs\n2003 Iowa Cubs Pacific Coast League 70-72 9th (t) Chicago Cubs\n2004 Iowa Cubs Pacific Coast League 79-64 4th Chicago Cubs Lost League Finals\n2005 Iowa Cubs Pacific Coast League 64-75 13th Chicago Cubs\n2010 Chicago Cubs National League 24-13 5th Chicago Cubs replaced Lou Piniella (51-74) on August 23\n2011 Chicago Cubs National League 71-91 5th Chicago Cubs\n2015 Rochester Red Wings International League 77-67 5th(t) Minnesota Twins\n2016 Rochester Red Wings International League 81-63 4th Minnesota Twins\n2017 Rochester Red Wings International League Minnesota Twins\n\nRelated Sites[edit]",

        "text":"Profile image\nBy AmmoLand (Reporter)\nContributor profile | More stories\nStory Views\n\nLast Hour:\nLast 24 Hours:\n\nSuppressors: How They Work\n\nFriday, October 14, 2016 14:02\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nNote: This article was originally posted on NRA Blog:\n\nSuppressors are devices that, when attached to or integrated into a firearm, reduce the amount of noise and muzzle flash produced when the gun is fired. Most people familiar with firearms have seen some variant of a suppressor, usually a tubular device affixed to the barrel of a firearm.\n\nWe know that suppressors work \u2013 as evidenced\u00a0herehere\u00a0and\u00a0here\u00a0\u2013 but it makes us wonder, how? How could a tube of metal manage to quiet down the sound of a gunshot?\n\nScience and engineering working together, of course!\n\n(Animation courtesy\/SilencerCo)\n\nWe know that guns make a variety of sounds when fired, the most pronounced being the loud \u201cboom\u201d that occurs when the projectile exits the barrel. This is due to the rapidly expanding propellant gases that power the bullet forward out of the barrel from the chamber. That instant pressure and temperature change creates the explosive sound, not to mention the bright, fiery flash of light from the muzzle as the bullet leaves the bore.\n\nThink of a time you might have opened a bottle of champagne. Immense pressure from the contents collects beneath the cork. When you remove the cork, you\u2019re likely to hear a distinct \u201cpop,\u201d a result of that backed-up pressure being released at once, usually propelling the cork quickly out of the bottle. This is the same concept that applies when expanding gases exit the muzzle of a firearm.\n\nThe inside of a suppressor most commonly will have two sound-reducing parts: first, an expansion chamber near the barrel will cause the gases to expand and lose some energy, and second, the aforementioned baffles, which are essentially small barriers with holes in them that allow the projectile to safely pass through the suppressor while deflecting and slowing the expansion of the gases.\n\nThe suppressor internals are precision-engineered to accommodate particular calibers and applications. The number, construction, and geometry of the baffles and chambers vary to suit the application of a particular suppressor.\n\n(Photo courtesy\/SilencerCo)\n\nSome modern suppressor manufacturers have implemented advances in technology by creating suppressors that only use baffles, while others boast only an expansion chamber. Computer-aided design and CNC machinery have fostered the development of the monolithic core suppressor. In \u201cmonocore\u201d suppressors, the internal support structure and baffles are milled from a single piece of metal that can be easily removed from the tube for cleaning (especially important for rimfire suppressors).\n\nThe reduction in noise is made possible because the suppressor\u2019s chambers give gases a larger, contained space to dissipate and cool before exiting the firearm. Suppressors have massive volumes compared to the tight tolerances of gun barrels, typically 20 to 30 times greater.\n\n(Photo courtesy\/\n\nWith all that room to fill, the pressurized gas that follows the bullet expands into the chambers, which dramatically decreases the pressure. As a result, when the bullet finally exits the suppressor, the lower pressure significantly softens the report of the shot. This quieted report is clearly easier on the ears, and can help suppressor users maintain advantages while hunting or shooting recreationally.\n\nAdditionally, the reduction in pressure eliminates a great deal of the bright muzzle blast, which is due to the remaining unburned powder combusting and mixing with ambient air. The baffle chambers of the suppressor capture much of that unburned powder too, reducing the intensity of the muzzle flash. Lastly, capturing a good deal of that pressure in a suppressor helps reduce muzzle rise and felt recoil because the gases \u201cpush\u201d forward on each baffle in the opposite direction of recoil.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that suppressors, true to their moniker, suppress the report of a firearm rather than entirely eliminate it. Users must be sure to evaluate their particular firearm, ammunition and suppressor combination to determine if additional hearing protection is appropriate.\n\nThis post Suppressors: How They Work appeared first on Shooting Sports News .\n\n\nWe encourage you to Share our Reports, Analyses, Breaking News and Videos.

He went on to play 26 games for Lausanne-Sport.\n\nFC Basel[edit]\n\nIn summer 2007, he left Lausanne for FC Basel on a free transfer, signing a three-year deal. He made his debut for Basel in the 5\u20131 away defeat on 5 August 2007 against BSC Young Boys.[3] However, he played just a handful of games during his first season at Basel and therefore for the 2008\u201309 season he was loaned out to Sevilla FC's B Team, Sevilla Atl\u00e9tico, where he made 22 appearances, scoring one goal.\n\nWhen he returned to Basel Manager Christian Gross had been sacked and Thorsten Fink was in charge. Cabral had become a much improved player following his season in Spain and thus during the 2009\u201310 season he broke into the first team squad. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20132 home win over AC Bellinzona on 6 December 2009.[4] At the end of that season Cabral was part of the Double winning squad and he had played 21 league games during the campaign.\n\nHis best goal was in the 2010\/2011 UEFA Champions League against A.S. Roma when he dribbled around the defence and then lobbed the ball over Bogdan Lobon\u0163 to the final score of 3:1. At the end of the Basel's 2010\u201311 season Cabral won his third Championship Medal and the following season saw him win his third Double (the fourth League Championship title[5] and the third Swiss Cup Medal).[6]\n\nAfter his team mate Benjamin Huggel retired from professional football in May 2012, Cabral took his place in central midfield and advanced to becoming team leader. At the end of the Swiss Super League season 2012\u201313 Cabral won the Championship title[7] and was Swiss Cup runner up with Basel.[8] In the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League Basel advanced as far as the semi-finals, there being matched against the reigning UEFA Champions League holders Chelsea, but they were knocked out, losing both home and away tie, beaten 2\u20135 on aggregate.[9]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2013, Sunderland announced the signing of Cabral on a free transfer.[10] He scored his first goal for the club against Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final of the 2013 Premier League Asia Trophy. Sunderland would eventually win that game 3\u20131. He made his competitive debut for the club on the opening day of the season in a 1\u20130 home defeat against Fulham on 17 August 2013.[11] However, he failed to make another league appearance all season, even after Paolo di Canio was sacked as manager and replaced with Gus Poyet.\n\nOn 9 January 2014, having played no further part for the Black Cats, he was loaned to Genoa until the end of the season.[12]\n\nOn 2 February 2015, Sunderland confirmed that Cabral had left the club by mutual consent.[13]\n\nFC Z\u00fcrich[edit]\n\nOn 30 May 2015 he signed a four-year deal with FC Z\u00fcrich.[14] On 1 December 2016 the contract was terminated by mutual consent.[15] Cabral made only 15 league appearances for FC Z\u00fcrich.\n\nInternational career[edit]\n\nCabral represented Switzerland at Under-18, Under-19, Under-20 and Under-21 levels.\n\nIn November 2012, Cabral switched his sporting nationality to his birth country of Cape Verde, being called up for the friendly match between the Cape Verde national senior team against Ghana.[16] In that match, which Cape Verde lost 0\u20131, he was on the bench but did not play.[17]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nCabral is a cousin of Manuel Fernandes a midfielder for FC Lokomotiv Moscow and Gelson Fernandes, a midfielder for Stade Rennais of the Ligue 1 and the Swiss national team.[18]\n\nIn 2016, Cabral was found not guilty at Hull Crown Court after a woman had accused him of rape from his time at Sunderland. The woman had consensual sex with several footballers and the judge called her claim a \"weak case\". Cabral stated \"I was really angry for my family, for my friends, for this because everybody think 'You rape girls', 'You are a rapist'. Now the real story goes out. I am not guilty.\"[19]\n\n\nFC Z\u00fcrich\n\n\n  1. ^ \"Barclays Premier League Squad Numbers 2013\/14\". Premier League. 16 August 2013.

        "text":"John Ryan Murphy\n\nFrom BR Bullpen\n\nJohn Ryan Murphy\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information[edit]\n\nJohn Ryan Murphy made his major league debut in 2013.\n\nMurphy was the second-team high school All-American catcher in 2009 according to Baseball America, behind Bryce Harper. The New York Yankees took him 76th overall in the 2009 amateur draft; the pick was compensation for failing to sign Scott Bittle the year before. He was New York's second selection, following Slade Heathcott. He was signed by scouts Jeff Deardorff and Brian Barber for a bonus of $1.5 million, forgoing a scholarship to the University of Miami. He made his pro debut that summer, getting into just 9 games for the GCL Yankees (11 for 33, 2 BB, HR, 3 BB). Murphy hit .255\/.327\/.376 for the 2010 Charleston RiverDogs, fielding .973 with 13 passed balls in 53 games and throwing out 23% of attempted base-stealers. He did come up with a big day August 13th against the Hickory Crawdads, with a grand slam, a three-run homer and two more RBI to fall one RBI shy of the South Atlantic League single-game record.\n\nBacking up fellow prospect Gary Sanchez for Charleston in 2011, he fared better (.297\/.343\/.457 in 63 G) and moved up to the Tampa Yankees (.259\/.270\/.365 in 23 G). He hit 29 doubles in 341 at-bats that year. In 2012, he played for Tampa (.257\/.322\/.374 in 67 G) and the Trenton Thunder (.231\/.306\/.408 in 43 G). He had 11 errors, 13 passed balls and threw out 32% of attempted base-stealers. He was 6 for 26 with two home runs and four RBI for Trenton in the playoffs.\n\nIn 2013, J.R. opened with Trenton (.268\/.352\/.421 in 49 G), then moved up to the Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (.270\/.342\/.430 in 59 G). He hit 29 doubles and 12 home runs. He was a September call-up to the majors. In his big league debut on September 2nd, he pinch-hit for Robinson Cano in the bottom of the 8th of a 9-1 blowout of the Chicago White Sox. He singled off David Purcey then exited the game in the top of the 9th. He hit .154\/.185\/.192 in 16 games in his first taste of the majors. He started the 2014 season back in the minors (5 for 26, 3 2B for Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre) but was soon called up to New York to back up newly signed Brian McCann when Francisco Cervelli went on the disabled list. He hit his first career home run on April 26th, connecting off Hector Santiago of the Los Angeles Angels in the 5th inning, after having hit a two-run single in the 2nd. His offensive heroics were key to a 4-3 win. He ended plying 32 games for the Yanks, with a .284 average, 1 homer and 9 RBIs.\n\nIn 2015, John Ryan began the season as the main back-up for starting catcher Brian McCann, following Cervelli's trade in the off-season. On July 25th, his first homer of the season was a dramatic one against the Minnesota Twins. The Yankees had fallen into an early 5-0 hole, but three homers by Alex Rodriguez, including a solo shot in the 9t had tied the score. Facing All-Star closer Glen Perkins later that inning, he hit a three-run shot that gave the Yankees an 8-5 win. He played 67 games for the Yankees, hitting .277 with 3 homers and 14 RBIs and showing that he was ready to step into a starting job. However, this was not to come with the Yankees, with McCann signed to a long-term contract and with another young catcher waiting in the wings in Gary Sanchez. As a result, on November 11th, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins in return for OF Aaron Hicks.\n\nMurphy's stay with the Twins was an unhappy one. Given a chance to earn the starting job at the start of 2016, he hit just .146 in 26 games and was sent down to the minors. With Rochester, he hit .236 in 83 games, with 3 homers and 39 RBIs. In 2017, he did not play for Minnesota, hitting .222 in 59 games for Rochester. On July 27th, the Twins gave up on him, trading him to the Arizona Diamondbacks for P Gabriel Moya. He played 5 games for Arizona, going 1 for 7 at the plate. In 2018, he spent the entire season with Arizona and played 87 games, hitting .202 with 9 homers and 24 RBIs while sharing catching duties with Alex Avila and Jeff Mathis. He was again part of a catching trio at the start of 2019, but on March 30th, he made his pitching debut. The D-backs and the Los Angeles Dodgers were coming off a 13-inning marathon the previous night, and when the Dodgers took a large lead, he was sent to the mound in the 7th. He allowed 7 runs, including homers by Cody Bellinger and Austin Barnes in 2 innings as Arizona lost the game, 18-5. The Dodgers also used a position player on the mound in the game, also to save a depleted bullpen, as Russell Martin pitched a perfect 9th inning to close out the game. he hit only .177 in 25 games for Arizona and on July 31st, he was purchased by the Atlanta Braves. He appeared in only one game with them, going 0 for 1. In the minors, he played 36 games for the Reno Aces, the D-Backs' AAA affiliate, and 14 for the Gwinnett Stripers, the Braves' top farm team.\n\nOn January 10, 2020, he signed a free agent contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh was looking for catching depth after letting Elias Diaz go after a disappointing 2019; they had Jacob Stallings returning and had picked up Luke Maile; Maile, Stallings and Murphy all had strong defensive statistics but poor offensive profiles (though Stallings had hit surprisingly well in '19).\n\nSources include 2013 Yankees Media Guide\n\nRelated Sites[edit]",

        "text":"Kettlebell Workout\n\n\n\nWhat is a Kettlebell?\u00a0 A kettlebell is a fitness training tool which originated in Russia and is used to develop full body conditioning. Resembling a cannon ball with a handle, or a steel ball with a curved handle on one end and flat on the other end, the shape of the kettlebell allows users to position their weight directly above their center of mass while keeping their hand and wrists in natural alignment. This allows for increased endurance and a higher volume of exercise, resulting in greater fitness and conditioning.\n\nKettlebell Weights\n\nKettlebells come in various weights or sizes, typically increasing in 4 kg increments (i.e. 12kg, 16kg, 24kg, and 32kg). However 14 kg, 28kg, and even 60kg kettlebells are also available. While one bell is sufficient for a great workout, many athletes train with a number of kettlebells of varying weights.\n\nKettlebell Training Benefits\n\nBenefits of Kettlebell training and workouts include:\n\n  \u2022 Increased strength\n  \u2022 Improved flexibility, coordination, and balance\n  \u2022 Increased endurance\n  \u2022 More lean muscle mass\n  \u2022 Improved core strength\n  \u2022 Weight loss\n  \u2022 Prevention of injury\n  \u2022 Posterior chain strengthening\n  \u2022 Mental toughness\n  \u2022 Can be applied to sports and combat\n\nThe Kettlebell Swing\n\nThe most popular and core kettlebell movement is the Kettlebell Swing, which can be used for strength-endurance as well as cardio and metabolic conditioning.\n\nTo perform a kettlebell swing, start with a posture and hip drive. The weight is then:\n\n  \u2022 Swung up from between the legs\n  \u2022 Driven by a hip thrust forward to chest height\n  \u2022 Accelerated down by shoulders pulling the weight down\n  \u2022 Swung back through the legs\n  \u2022 Driven back up with the hips\n  \u2022 Back-and-forth sequence is repeated for reps\n\nDepending on the mass of the kettlebell, sets of swings can be:\n\n  \u2022 Low-Rep (3-5)\n  \u2022 High-Rep (10-100 or more)\n\nKettlebell swings also work the grip and forearms and can be performed with two hands on one bell, one hand on one bell, or one bell in each hand for \u2018doubles\u2019 (two bells at a time).\n\nKettlebell Workout Movements\n\nAdditional kettlebell workout movements include:\n\n  \u2022 Jerk\n  \u2022 Snatch\n  \u2022 Kettlebell Deadlift\n  \u2022 Kettlebell Squat Thruster\n  \u2022 Kettlebell One-Arm High Pull\n  \u2022 Kettlebell One-Arm Clean\n\nInternational Kettlebell and Fitness Federation (IKFF)\n\nKettlebell training is available at the International Kettlebell and Fitness Federation (IKFF). The IKFF promotes mind\/body fitness globally and helps members develop the skills they need to enhance their fitness level and\/or accelerate their fitness business. On the cutting edge of athletic conditioning and training, kettlebell competitions are now held annually in North America, promoted by the World Kettlebell Club, and Kettlebell trainer certification courses (RKC) are also available.",

The tournament was won by Italy, who defeated West Germany 3\u20131 in the final, held in the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Spanish capital of Madrid. It was Italy's third World Cup title, but their first since 1938. The defending champions, Argentina, were eliminated in the second group round. Algeria, Cameroon, Honduras, Kuwait and New Zealand made their first appearances in the finals.\n\nThe tournament featured the first penalty shoot-out in World Cup competition.[2][3] This was the last World Cup to feature two rounds of group stages. It was also the third time (after 1934 and 1966) in which all four semi-finalists were European.\n\nIn the first round of Group 3, Hungary defeated El Salvador 10\u20131, equalling the largest margin of victory recorded in the finals (Hungary over South Korea 9\u20130 in 1954, and Yugoslavia over Zaire 9\u20130 in 1974).\n\nHost selection\n\nSpain was chosen as the host nation by FIFA in London on 6 July 1966. Hosting rights for the 1974 and 1978 tournaments were awarded at the same time. West Germany and Spain agreed a deal whereby Spain would support West Germany for the 1974 tournament and West Germany would allow Spain to bid for the 1982 World Cup unopposed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Countries qualified for World Cup\n\u00a0\u00a0Country did not qualify\n\u00a0\u00a0Countries that did not enter World Cup\n\u00a0\u00a0Country not a FIFA member\n\nFor the first time, the World Cup finals expanded from 16 to 24 teams. This allowed more teams to participate from Africa and Asia.\n\nTeams absent from the finals were 1974 and 1978 runners-up Netherlands (eliminated by Belgium and France), Mexico (eliminated by Honduras and El Salvador), and the three times 1970s participants Sweden (eliminated by Scotland and Northern Ireland). Northern Ireland qualified for the first time since 1958. Belgium, Czechoslovakia, El Salvador, England and the Soviet Union were all back in the finals after 12-year absences. England had its first successful World Cup qualifying campaign in 20 years,[4] having qualified automatically as hosts in 1966 and as defending champions in 1970 and failing to qualify in 1974 and 1978. Yugoslavia and Chile were also back after missing the 1978 tournament.\n\nAlgeria, Cameroon, Honduras, Kuwait, and New Zealand all participated in the World Cup for the first time. As of 2018, this was the last time that El Salvador and Kuwait qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, as well as the last time that Mexico and South Korea failed to qualify.\n\nThere was some consideration given as to whether England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland should withdraw from the tournament because of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom.[4] A directive issued by the British sports minister Neil Macfarlane in April, at the start of the conflict, suggested that there should be no contact between British representative teams and Argentina.[4] This directive was not rescinded until August, following the end of hostilities.[4] Macfarlane reported to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that some players and officials were uneasy about participating because of the casualties suffered by British forces.[4] FIFA advised the British Government that there was no prospect that Argentina (the defending champions) would be asked to withdraw.[4] It also became apparent that no other countries would withdraw from the tournament.[4] It was decided[by whom?] to allow the British national teams to participate so that Argentina could not use their absence for propaganda purposes, reversing the intended effect of applying political pressure onto Argentina.[4]\n\nList of qualified teams\n\nThe following 24 teams qualified for the final tournament.\n\n\n\nA statue commemorating the 1982 FIFA World Cup at the Estadio Riazor in A Coru\u00f1a.\n\nThe first round was a round-robin group stage containing six groups of four teams each. Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw, with goal difference used to separate teams equal on points. The top two teams in each group advanced. In the second round, the twelve remaining teams were split into four groups of three teams each, with the winner of each group progressing to the knockout semi-final stage.\n\nThe composition of the groups in the second round was determined before the start of the tournament. Groups A and B were to include one team from each of Groups 1 through 6, and Groups C and D included the remaining six teams. The winners of Groups 1 and 3 were in Group A whilst the runners-up were in Group C. The winners of Groups 2 and 4 were in Group B whilst the runners-up were in Group D. The winner of Group 5 was in Group D whilst the runner-up was in Group B. The winner of Group 6 was in Group C whilst the runner-up was in Group A. Thus, Group A mirrored Group C, and Group B mirrored Group D with the winners and runners-up from the first round being placed into opposite groups in the second round.\n\nThe second-round groups that mirrored each other (based on the first-round groupings) faced off against each other in the semifinals. Thus, the Group A winner played the Group C winner, and the Group B winner played the Group D winner. This meant that if two teams which played in the same first-round group both emerged from the second round, they would meet for the second time of the tournament in a semifinal match. It also guaranteed that the final match would feature two teams that had not previously played each other in the tournament. As it turned out, Italy and Poland who were both in Group 1 in the first round, each won their second-round groups and played each other in a semifinal match.[5]\n\nFirst group stage\n\nIn Group 1, newcomers Cameroon held both Poland and Italy to draws, and were denied a place in the next round on the basis of having scored fewer goals than Italy (the sides had an equal goal difference). Poland and Italy qualified over Cameroon and Peru. Italian journalists and tifosi criticised their team for their uninspired performances that managed three draws; the squad was reeling from the recent Serie A scandal, where national players were suspended for match fixing and illegal betting.[6]\n\nGroup 2 saw one of the great World Cup upsets on the first day with the 2\u20131 victory of Algeria over reigning European Champions West Germany. In the final match in the group, West Germany met Austria in a match later dubbed as the \"Disgrace of Gij\u00f3n\". Algeria had already played their final group game the day before, and West Germany and Austria knew that a West German win by 1 or 2 goals would qualify them both, while a larger German victory would qualify Algeria over Austria, and a draw or an Austrian win would eliminate the Germans. After 10\u00a0minutes of all-out attack, West Germany scored through a goal by Horst Hrubesch. After the goal was scored, the two teams kicked the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match. Chants of \"Fuera, fuera\" (\"Out, out\") were screamed by the Spanish crowd, while angry Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players. This performance was widely deplored, even by the German and Austrian fans. One German fan was so upset by his team's display that he burned his German flag in disgust.[7] Algeria protested to FIFA, who ruled that the result be allowed to stand; FIFA introduced a revised qualification system at subsequent World Cups in which the final two games in each group were played simultaneously.\n\nGroup 3, where the opening ceremony and first match of the tournament took place, saw Belgium beat defending champions Argentina 1\u20130. The Camp Nou stadium was the home of Barcelona, and many fans had wanted to see the club's new signing, Argentinian star Diego Maradona, who did not perform to expectations. Both Belgium and Argentina ultimately advanced at the expense of Hungary and El Salvador despite Hungary's 10\u20131 win over the Central American nation \u2013 which, with a total of 11 goals, is the second highest scoreline in a World Cup game (equal with Brazil's 6\u20135 victory over Poland in the 1938 tournament and Hungary's 8\u20133 victory over West Germany in the 1954 tournament).\n\nGroup 4 opened with England midfielder Bryan Robson's goal against France after only 27\u00a0seconds of play. England won 3\u20131 and qualified along with France over Czechoslovakia and Kuwait, though the tiny Gulf emirate held Czechoslovakia to a 1\u20131 draw. In the game between Kuwait and France, with France leading 3\u20131, France midfielder Alain Giresse scored a goal vehemently contested by the Kuwait team, who had stopped play after hearing a piercing whistle from the stands, which they thought had come from Soviet referee Miroslav Stupar. Play had not yet resumed when Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, brother of the then-Kuwaiti Emir and president of the Kuwait Football Association, rushed onto the pitch to remonstrate with the referee. Stupar reversed his initial decision and disallowed the goal to the fury of the French. Maxime Bossis scored another valid goal a few minutes later and France won 4\u20131.\n\nIn Group 5, Honduras held hosts Spain to a 1\u20131 draw. Northern Ireland won the group outright, eliminating Yugoslavia... (truncated)",

While most teams would have taken this as a cue to start tearing up the team in order to rebuild, most observers seemed to agree that the team was not really that bad, but instead was a victim of everything that could possibly have gone wrong doing so, saddling them with an awful record. So, instead of seeing what package of prospects they could extract by trading away their star players, the Giants decided to double down and add a few veterans to plug obvious holes in order to extend their cycle of competitiveness by one or two more years. After all this was a team that had made the postseason as recently as 2016, and had won three World Series title since the start of the decade.\n\nThe Giants made two big deals during the winter, the first one to acquire 3B Evan Longoria from the Tampa Bay Rays and the second to snag OF Andrew McCutchen from the Pittsburgh Pirates. In both cases, the trades had only cost them some young players who were not expected to contribute much in 2018 - although in the longer term, their absence could prove costly. Both Longoria and McCutchen had been among the top players in the league only a few years ago and while still productive in 2017, were on the wrong side of 30, making them liable to experience a steep decline at any moment. The Giants were betting that this would not come for at least a couple of seasons. Other additions included P Tony Watson and OF Austin Jackson, the latter essentially taking the spot of Denard Span, who had gone to the Rays in the Longoria deal. They joined a solid core that included C Buster Posey, 1B Brandon Belt, 2B Joe Panik, SS Brandon Crawford and OF Hunter Pence, all of them former contributors to World Series titles. On the mound, the top three of Madison Bumgarner, Jeff Samardzija and Johnny Cueto was as good on paper as any other team's - if they remained healthy. Sam with the bullpen tandem of Mark Melancon and Sam Dyson: potentially devastating, but both coming off recent stretches of awfulness. Everyone was expecting a bounce-back from the Giants; the question was whether it would be big enough to take them back into postseason contention.\n\nFor all the efforts put towards improving the offense in the off-season, the Giants started the year in a huge batting slump, scoring just two runs over their first four games. They still managed to exit that opening series with a .500 record, as they won 1-0 against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Opening Day, March 29th, thanks to a solo homer by Panik off Clayton Kershaw. They won again by the same score the next day, again thanks to a solo homer by Panik as Cueto gave up just one hit in seven innings. But they lost the final two games of the series by a combined score of 14-0. They were the first team since the 1988 Baltimore Orioles, who lost their first 21 games, to score so few runs in their first four games.\n\nAwards and Honors[edit]\n\nFurther Reading[edit]\n\n  \u2022 Associated Press: \"Madison Bumgarner, Giants ready to rebound from last place\", USA Today Sports, March 22, 2018.

        "text":"Sports entertainment\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nSports entertainment is a type of spectacle which presents an ostensibly competitive event using a high level of theatrical flourish and extravagant presentation, with the purpose of entertaining an audience. Unlike typical athletics and games, which are conducted for competition, sportsmanship, exercise or personal recreation, the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience's benefit, thus they are never practiced privately. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an open secret, it is not considered to be match fixing.\n\n\nThe World Wrestling Federation coined the term \"sports entertainment\" during the 1980s as a description for professional wrestling, although precursors date back to February 1935, when Toronto Star sports editor Lou Marsh described professional wrestling as \"sportive entertainment\". In 1989 WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as \"sports entertainment\" and thus not subject to regulation like a directly competitive sport.\n\nSome sports entertainment events represent variants of actual sports, such as exhibition basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters association, or American football with the Legends Football League. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional wrestling), and more recently many of the various mascot races held at numerous Major League Baseball games in-between innings.[1]\n\nSome forms of sports entertainment involve taking competitive games usually considered minor, such as dodgeball, poker, or rock-paper-scissors, and televising them with trumped-up theatrics, involving (for example) celebrity competitors or elaborate audiovisual packages.\n\n\nSports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment,[2] and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning: the film Idiocracy portrays a future where sports entertainment permeates the global culture: the president is an active champion professional wrestler and capital punishment consists of a combination demolition derby, monster truck event and gladiator duel, and is a highly popular television broadcast. Fiction with a dystopian future setting often portrays deadly futuristic games as popular sports entertainment, including the novel The Hunger Games, the movie The Running Man, video games such as Smash TV and the Twisted Metal series, and the role-playing game Shadowrun, which features Urban Brawl and Combat Biking.\n\nMany notable names in the United States openly admit enjoying certain forms of sports entertainment while many others have taken part in it or made paid contributions. Professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal has a reputation as a long time pro wrestling fan and attends WWE events several times per year, and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. expressed interest in fulfilling a WWE career after he retires from professional boxing. Former American football player Brian Urlacher, who admits to being a pro wrestling fan, made an attempt to leave football to wrestle for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling full-time until his team at the time, the Chicago Bears, forced him to stop.\n\nThe widespread popularity in the United States for the main form of sports entertainment, professional wrestling, has caused politicians to use it to reach voters, particularly young males. President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain recorded video messages for broadcast for the WWE to encourage the audience of WWE Raw to vote, and George W. Bush did a prerecorded video for the WWE's annual Tribute to the Troops show.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n  1. ^ \"Out at the plate: Pirates dump outspoken pierogi - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\". 2012-07-03.
