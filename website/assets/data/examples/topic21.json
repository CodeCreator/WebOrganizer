        "text":"6 Players to Watch in Premier League\u00a02010\/11\n\nWell it\u2019s time for that obligatory Premier League Preview. However due to lack of time and the fact that several esteemed journalists (and some not at all esteemed) have previewed the league, I feel it\u2019s best to highlight 6 players who have all the tools needed to be proficient and\u00a0efficient\u00a0in the Premier League.\n\nIt\u2019s been a strange transfer window really. Very quiet bar the big spenders Manchester City and also a case of \u2018chase the hottest prospect around Europe\u2019 game (Loic Remy, Mesut Ozil) in which several managers have participated in and ultimately coming up with no signing.\n\nI\u2019ve imposed certain rulings here. Firstly I cannot go with obvious suggestions that media darling pundits have, so this means Javier Hernandez will not be selected due to the fact the world and his dog know he will be good this year and if you\u2019re a eagle-eyed World Cup viewer, you\u2019ll know exactly what he will bring to Manchester United. This also means no David Silva, Jack Wilshere, Gareth Bale, Joe Hart et al.\n\nThe other ruling is that I\u2019m going to try and highlight players outside the Big Four if possible unless I feel a certain player at a big club deserves attention. So sorry Joe Cole, but I wouldn\u2019t have picked you anyway despite the fact that you are clearly more \u00a0skilful than Lionel Messi, according to your club captain (surely a contender for Biggest Heaping of Pressure on an Overrated midfielder.)\n\nSo here we go, 6pointer\u2019s guide to 6 players you should put into your fantasy football team if you can:\n\n1. Mauro Boselli (Wigan)\n\nI\u2019ll be honest I was worried about Wigan at the beginning of this transfer window. Several players have left the club after their contracts expired, such as Mario Melchiot (who was beginning to become a liability anyway) and Paul Scharner. Other key players had jumped ship too, like Titus Bramble joining his former manager Steve Bruce at Sunderland.\n\nMartinez had a massive summer scouting mission ahead of him. Fortunately, he\u2019s managed to make some great signings. Antolin Alcaraz from Club Bruges, was instrumental in Paraguay\u2019s World Cup success, forged upon a tightly knit defence. Ronnie Stam has signed from FC Twente, who\u2019s continually improved there as a right-back and got a Holland call-up too.\n\nBut one thing that Wigan have always lacked at this level is an out and out frontman, who\u2019s capable of consistently performing. Step forward\u00a0Mauro Boselli. Signed from Estudiantes for an estimated \u00a36.5million, he swaps the bustling streets of Buenos Aires for a wet and windy Wigan.\n\nHe\u2019d managed to build quite a reputation for himself in Argentina, scoring 32 goals in 57 appearances for Estudiantes. He\u2019s an intelligent striker, who knows exactly where to be at the right time.\n\nMartinez describes him as \u2018a goalscorer, who lives to put the ball in the back of the net\u2019 and if he links up well with Hugo Rodallega or Jordi Gomez, I feel we might see a barrage of goals at Wigan this year.\n\nWhy Terry Venables thinks they\u2019ll be 19th I don\u2019t know, when Martinez has added some quality to a pretty ropey side. Boselli has even made a Argentinian call-up. You may see this as Diego Maradona experimenting, after all he\u2019s used about 50 players in the last 2 years, but you have to some sort of quality to challenge that front-line.\n\nHe could flop like so many South Americans before him in this league, but I feel the top scorer in the Copa Libertadores in 2009 might just be this season\u2019s best purchase, and will warrant a big move the year after.\n\nEDIT \u2013 23\/9\/10 \u2013 After seeing Mauro Boselli, live in the flesh, discount any information you see here. He looked sluggish against Preston. Sean St Ledger kept him in his pocket the entire night pretty much. Don\u2019t listen to me, I have sinned.\n\n2.Daniel Sturridge (Chelsea)\n\nOk, I\u2019ve broken the Top Four amnesty. But I don\u2019t think many people realise the quality of this young English centre-forward. This decision was mainly down to his performance in last week\u2019s Community Shield, where came on 2nd half replacing Nicolas Anelka. I feel this might happen a lot this year, since I think Anelka is under serious threat of finding himself at another club. He\u2019s hardly had a good summer either, and I think his time at a top level is coming to an end.\n\nThis is why I feel Daniel Sturridge is an ideal replacement. He has power and pace in abundance and Carlo Ancelotti found opportunity to play him a lot in the later months of last season, particularly in Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup winning side. He ended up with 4 goals in the FA Cup and finished as the leading scorer for Chelsea.\n\nIf Carlo Ancelotti\u00a0integrates\u00a0him more this season, we may well see Sturridge challenge for national selection. The future\u2019s bright for this young man I reckon.\n\n3.Jerome Boateng (Man City)\n\nIf you were to ask me last season where City needed strengthening, the answer is obvious. The back four last year began superbly but then collapsed as the season progressed. For all your attacking options, you need players capable of offering protection to a solid goalkeeper. Roberto Mancini has acted this summer and brought in German international Jerome Boateng from Hamburg. Of course \u00a311 million isn\u2019t cheap but compared to the \u00a324million City paid for Joleon Lescott, it looks a bargain.\n\nBoateng is a strong and versatile defender, capable of playing really anywhere across the defence. He\u2019ll thrive in this league, as he\u2019s renowned for last-ditch defending. He was unsung really in Germany\u2019s World Cup exploits, the plaudits of a free-flowing attack were well noted but it was underpinned by a strong defence. City should be improved this season as I think their major weakness has been sorted out to some extent.\n\n4.Dani Pacheco (Liverpool)\n\nHe\u2019s often been touted as the next best thing at Liverpool, but former manager Rafa Benitez never really used him or got the best out of him when he did. I think under Roy Hodsgon we may see that change. Pacheco was instrumental along with Sergio Canales in the Spanish side that were runners-up in this year\u2019s U19\u2019s European Championship in France. What Dani lacks in height, he makes up double in creativity and all-round trickiness, a general requirement of any Barcelona youth player.\n\nIf given the chance this season under Hodgson, he could link up well with a fully fit Fernando Torres (will this ever happen?) and we should see more of the man nicknamed The Assassin by\u00a0team-mates\u00a0due to his ability to score from anywhere.\n\n5.Graham Dorrans (West Brom)\n\nI feel it\u2019s only fair to highlight someone from the promoted teams, and while Charlie Adam seems a good pick, I\u2019ve decided to go with the Baggies playmaker. He was unbelievable last season in the Championship, and certainly worthy of his place in the Team of the Year. He\u2019s the\u00a0linchpin of the side, and his partnership with Chris Brunt was key to West Brom\u2019s promotion last year. He\u2019s an all-round central midfielder with a sweet shot on him too.\n\nI still think West Brom are relegation candidates, after all the club is a yo-yo side, but if they want to avoid the drop look no further to their young midfield driving force. All they need a good striker and they may have a chance to get mid-table. Even if West Brom go down, I get the feeling he won\u2019t find it hard to garner some Premier League interest.\n\nScotland, there is something to get excited about from a upcoming star.\n\n6. Pablo Barrera (West Ham)\n\nAnother player to shine in Javier Aguirre\u2019s exciting Mexican side, this winger could prove a real handful for some Premier League teams. The thing I remember most about Barrera at the World Cup was the torrid time he gave Eric Abidal in the France game (arguably Mexico\u2019s best performance at the World Cup). He looks nippy and a decent crosser too, something that West Ham will need to feed Carlton Cole up top, or maybe Frank Nouble if he\u2019s given a chance.\n\nThe 23 year old moved from Mexican side Pumas for \u00a34 million. I\u2019m not totally convinced about West Ham\u2019s plans under Avram Grant but I think Barrera could be a hugely\u00a0influential\u00a0midfielder for them.\n\nSo there we have it. Let\u2019s see next May how badly wrong I was.\n\n\nWorld Cup Preview \u2013 The Last\u00a016\n\nWell, so far, the World Cup has seen many talking points, arguably most off the field. The mass hysteria over the flight of the Jabulani football and the whurring of mutant bees around the grounds courtesy of that old friend, the vuvuzela. The French threatening a mutiny and also who could forget Robbie Earle selling his 36 tickets ( he had 400 in total for the tournament) for the Holland Denmark game to some lovely Dutch ladies. This World Cup has set a precedent for outrageous moments.\n\nWe\u2019ve had some great footballing moments in a World Cup\u00a0apparently\u00a0littered with terrible games if you believe the pundits. But this only makes it more fascinating, some of the \u2018dull\u2019 games have been great tactical battles, others have been exactly that: dull (England Algeria, France Uruguay being the 2 main examples). At the end of the day, if you are a pundit moaning at getting paid for being at a World Cup, then you need to re-assess how much of a prat you are.\n\nSome sides have fascinated, others have fallen flat at the first hurdle. Underdogs have shined in South Africa as well. New Zealand were unbeaten in the group stage but faced an flight back to Auckland whilst Italy became a country for Old Men after they finished bottom of Group F. Switzerland\u2019s tight defensive unit defeated the pre-tournament champions elect, Spain and Germany once again proved their tournament mettle with some convincing displays. And of course El Diego\u2019s faith in Saint Martin Palermo was proved right after he scored a goal. I honestly didn\u2019t predict that.\n\nHalf the fun of this tournament has been the off-screen stuff (such as watching Diego Maradona waltz around in a rather fetching monochrome number) but we now reach crunch-time. The Last 16.\n\nThroughout the years, we\u2019ve had some unbelievable ties and this year wil... (truncated)",

(AP Photo\/Craig Lassig)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Fresh off last season\u2019s loss in the Stanley Cup final, the Vegas Golden Knights reloaded for another run by remaking their second line.\n\nA newcomer and a holdover showed Saturday how explosive the second unit can be for Vegas.\n\nErik Haula scored in the shootout and the Golden Knights rallied to a 2-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Saturday night.\n\nMax Pacioretty, who was acquired from Montreal in an offseason trade, scored his first goal for Vegas, which has used Pacioretty and Haula on opposite sides of new center Paul Stastny in the season\u2019s first two games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great player and he played a real good game tonight,\u201d Golden Knights coach Gerard Gallant said of Pacioretty. \u201cThat line was excellent and that\u2019s a big goal for us at a key time.\u201d\n\nPacioretty snapped home a one-timer in the slot from Jonathan Marchessault with 1:31 left in regulation to tie the game as Gallant pulled goaltender Marc Andre-Fleury.\n\n\u201cI really thought in the third period when we played our best, that we were blocking shots and doing what we had to do,\u201d Minnesota coach Bruce Boudreau said. \u201cBut they were pressing. They come at you all the time, that\u2019s why they won the West.\u201d\n\nFleury made 29 saves for Vegas, bouncing back after being pulled in the opening 5-2 loss at home to the Philadelphia Flyers. Fleury was pulled after 30:11 against Philadelphia after allowing five goals on 16 shots.\n\nMatt Dumba scored for the Wild, who was the only team in the Western Conference to sweep Vegas last season. Minnesota goaltender Devan Dubnyk stopped 41 of the 42 shots he faced.\n\n\u201cHe was fantastic,\u201d Wild forward Jason Zucker said of Dubnyk. \u201cHe\u2019s the only reason that we didn\u2019t lose that game 10-nothing.\u201d\n\nHaula scored the only goal in the shootout against his former team as his shot between Dubnyk\u2019s legs ended up trickling in after Dubnyk appeared to make the stop.\n\n\u201cWe just stuck with it, made a great play there on Max\u2019s goal and we had a lot of chances,\u201d Haula said. \u201cDuby played well over there and made it hard on us, but overall I\u2019m just happy with our game. It\u2019s a good indicator to jump back in a tough building, tough environment and just play like that, it\u2019s a good job by the guys.\u201d\n\nDumba, signed to five-year, $30 million contract in the offseason, scored on a slap shot from the blue line midway through the first period. Dubnyk held up against a Vegas\u2019 attack that outshot Minnesota 42-30 through overtime.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to feel good out of the gate,\u201d Dubnyk said. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to have two wins, obviously. It\u2019s tough to feel too good about it. But we just try to work on those things that make you feel good and I\u2019m feeling pretty good in there now, so we\u2019ll have a good week.\u201d\n\nThe Wild lost for the first time in the first home game of the season at the Xcel Energy Center after starting 14-0-3 in such games.\n\nNOTES: Minnesota went 27-6-8 at home last season, finishing second in the NHL in home points. \u2026 The New York Islanders were the only other team to sweep Vegas last season, winning a pair of games. \u2026 Wild F Luke Kunin has been cleared for contact in his return from knee surgery. Kunin has been skating with the team. \u2026 Golden Knights rookie D Jake Bischoff made the NHL team for the first time in his career, but the Minnesota native was scratched for the second straight game along with D Brad Hunt. \u2026 The Wild scratched F J.T. Brown and D Nate Prosser for the second time in two games.\n\n\nGolden Knights: Season-long, five-game road trip continues Monday at Buffalo.\n\nWild: Host Chicago on Thursday.\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here",

        "text":"Season Preview 14\/15: BURNLEY\n\nby Adam Haworth\n\nBurnleyBurnley surprised almost everyone in the Championship last term. The relentless approach instilled by Sean Dyche mean the team never stopped. It\u2019s often the case that teams unexpectedly at the top of the table find themselves faltering and questioning themselves. Not under Sean Dyche. His ultra-logical approach led him to dismiss the idea of worrying about what had gone before. Burnley broke loads of club records, the most memorable of which is the win against bitter rivals Blackburn Rovers. He prevented his players from taking their eyes off the ball at any stage.\n\nDyche created a team who never looked like failing. Somehow, the whole club was taken on a journey that elevated it to a level where confidence, but not arrogance, reined supreme. Under Dyche, the Burnley team felt invincible. They weren\u2019t, but they might as well have been.\n\nThe season ended with promotion to the Premier League, the best reward for their impressive consistency. Last time Burnley were in the Premier League, the lasting memory was Owen Coyle\u2019s questionable mid-season move to Bolton. Burnley fans will be hoping to avoid those sorts of events and enjoy the top flight this time.\n\nThere\u2019s a real underdog mentality in this Burnley side. Everyone involved with the club will be aiming to defy the odds this season \u2013 which are quite understandably stacked against them. Proving everyone wrong is unapologetically the goal.\n\nLast season: 2nd (Championship)\nOdds (relegation): 3\/5\nIn: Michael Kightly (Stoke, undisclosed), Matt Gilks (Blackpool, free), Marvin Sordell (Bolton, free), Matt Taylor (West Ham, free), Lukas Jutkiewicz (Middlesbrough, \u00a31.5m-\u00a32.5m reported), Steven Reid (West Brom, free)\nOut: Junior Stanislas (Bournemouth, free), Keith Treacy (released), David Edgar (Birmingham, free), Brian Stock (released), Nick Liversedge (released).\n\nWhat\u2019s new\n\nThe summer has seen six new arrivals for Burnley so far. While none of them have been particularly inspiring, all signings have bolstered a small squad. The first arrival of the summer was Michael Kightly, who spent last term at Burnley on loan from Stoke. Kightly showed some promising signs towards the end of last season and provided a few crucial goals at the end of the campaign.\n\nNext in the door was out of contract Blackpool goalkeeper Matt Gilks. Gilks will provide cover for Tom Heaton, and it\u2019ll be nice for Dyche to have some genuine competition for the goalkeeper spot. Marvin Sordell and Matt Taylor signed on the same day, with Sordell hoping to finally prove his potential and Taylor providing important Premier League experience.\n\nAlong the same lines, Steven Reid signed three days later, again bolstering the squad and providing experience. The latest player to sign has been perhaps the most controversial . The fee paid for Lukas Jutkiewicz (reported to be from around \u00a31.5million to \u00a32.5million) is a little on the expensive side for some fans. Despite this, Jutkiewicz has a lot to prove, and fans saw last season how that mentality can be useful in motivating a player.\n\nOther than transfers, deep stadium infrastructure improvements have had to take place over the summer. The club have installed new press facilities, there are brand new seats in one stand and a new location for the players\u2019 tunnel. A presumably expensive scanner entry system has replaced the old fashioned turnstiles. There\u2019s been the construction of a new TV gantry for 3D broadcasts, and the installation of those fancy electronic advertising hoardings (finally). It\u2019ll take a lot for Turf Moor to be considered a modern stadium, but Premier League regulations mean the Club are at least trying to update things while keeping much of the ground\u2019s charm.\n\nKey Player\n\nNotable mentions should go to Danny Ings, Sam Vokes and Jason Shackell, but Kieran Trippier will perhaps be the team\u2019s most important player. Last season, Trippier not only showed exceptional defensive ability (despite taking a few minutes to get settled into games) but also provided a genuine attacking threat on the right wing.\n\nTrippier\u2019s cross delivery was arguably the best in the league last season, and goals will be as important as anything for Burnley next season. Burnley are, however, a cohesive unit and a team, rather than a group of individuals. Each player will fight for every other teammate and that attribute is far more important than the effect any one player will have on the season.\n\nOne to Watch\n\nMarvin Sordell will be an interesting one to watch. After impressing at Watford under Dyche\u2019s leadership \u2014 in the youth system as well as the first team \u2014 Sordell has struggled to live up to his billing.\n\nSordell won\u2019t be first on the team sheet by any stretch of the imagination, but how he fares once he does get on the pitch will probably decide the future of his career. Sordell must have potential \u2014 indeed he\u2019s shown it a couple of times \u2014 but watching to see whether he can finally deliver consistently will be the real thing to watch out for.\n\nAlso watch out for Sean Dyche. There\u2019s more to him than meets the eye, and that might just surprise a few people this season.\n\nSeason prediction\n\nBurnley\u2019s season will be decided by how they fare as a unit. The team spirit and togetherness was a significant reason behind their success last season and the character of the side will need to be even stronger this time around. While tactical awareness and individual moments of glory will play their part, how long Burnley are willing to fight for each other and the club will also be important. If those things happen, I\u2019m confident Burnley can beat the odds. It\u2019s a big if, but if there\u2019s any man who can get those things out of a side, it\u2019s Sean Dyche.\n\nBPF Prediction: 20th\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"Workout Of The Week: The Sisyphus Session\n\nPhoto: istock\n\nI love hill workouts.\u00a0For my money, running up and down a hill gives you the most bang for your running buck\u2014power, strength, endurance and speed all wrapped into one workout.\n\nSo, based on the title of this post, you might be wondering what a mythical Greek king has to do with attacking an incline.\n\nBefore we get to the Xs and Os of the workout, first a quick lesson in mythology. Sisyphus was a greedy and deceitful king who\u00a0was punished for his crimes by being sentenced to roll a large boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll all the way back down to the bottom before he ever reached the top. Despite his best efforts, he was forced to proceed in this manner for the rest of eternity.\n\nThis hill workout proceeds in much the same way but unlike our poor friend Sisyphus, you\u2019ll have the good fortune of getting to stop. Eventually.\n\nThe Sisyphus Session is one of the bread-and-butter strength-building sessions I like to have my athletes do in the weeks before beginning more pace-specific workouts. I\u2019ll assign some variation of this workout to 5K racers, marathoners and everyone in between toward the end of the the base-building phase of their respective training programs. It\u2019s one hill session that doesn\u2019t discriminate.\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Steep Hill Sprints\n\nAs the nature of the name of the workout implies, you\u2019ll be running up and down the hill a number of times. To get started, you will need to find a moderately steep incline that\u2019s roughly 400 to 800 meters long. Before beginning the workout, warm up with 15 to 20 minutes of easy jogging. Follow that up with some dynamic warmup drills and a set of four to six 20-second strides on flat ground before setting off up the hill.\n\nAfter warming up, run up the hill for 30 seconds at roughly 5K race effort and jog back down to the start for recovery. If you typically wear a GPS watch when you train, don\u2019t pay attention to the pace on the screen. It will be slower than your actual race pace because you\u2019re fighting against gravity, and since you\u2019re not covering much ground at any one time it likely won\u2019t register accurately on the watch, anyway. This workout is all about effort.\n\nSo without the aid of technology how do you know if the effort level is where it\u2019s supposed to be as you\u2019re running up the hill? It\u2019s as easy as asking yourself, \u201cCan I maintain this level of intensity for a 5K race?\u201d If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d then back it off a bit.\n\nOnce you get back to the bottom of the hill, turn around and head right back up again at the same hard effort for 60 seconds. Pay close attention to your form as the workout progresses and you start to fatigue. Shorten your stride, get up on your forefoot, lift your knees and drive your arms. You should have the sensation of being pulled up the hill. When you hit the 60-second mark, turn around, jog back down to the start, and do it all over again, this time going up the hill for 90 seconds.\n\nCongratulations, you\u2019re almost there.\n\nAfter jogging back down the hill upon completion of the 90-second repeat, head back up the hill for 2 minutes at the same effort and pat yourself on the back when you reach the top. You\u2019ve finished the first set.\n\nA completed set gives you 5 minutes worth of running uphill at an effort you should be able to maintain for a 5K race. For a beginning runner or someone just getting back into harder workouts after a lengthy layoff, this might be plenty of work the first time out. For more advanced runners looking to build some early-season strength, 2 to 3 sets (10-15 minutes of uphill running) is more like it. If you\u2019re feeling overly ambitious, try a fourth set, but for most three will be more than enough. This is a tough session!\n\nOne variation of this workout is to shorten the length of each uphill rep (e.g. start with 15 seconds, work your way up to a minute) or find a hill with multiple twists and turns and forget about running up and down for set amounts of time. Simply run hard to the first turn and jog back down. Do the same to the next turn and continue proceeding in this manner until you reach the top of the hill. Adjust your effort level for the uphill runs based on the length of the hill and the number of sets you\u2019re hoping to complete. In general, I suggest aiming for 10-15 minutes of uphill running at a strong effort.\n\nIn my college cross-country days, we did this workout on a stretch of dirt called Mountain Road, which was exactly one mile from bottom to top. We\u2019d run up to various landmarks along the road, turn around and do it again\u2026and again\u2026and again. We finished the workout with an all-out ascent to the top, at which point we were finally allowed to stop. It was only then that our \u201cpunishment\u201d was over for the day.\n\n\nStart your FREE subscription to Competitor Digital today!\n\nGet our monthly digital magazine, weekly running content & exclusive offers delivered to your inbox.\n\nRecent Stories",

        "text":"Aug 292013\n\n\nTonight, the Pittsburgh Steelers travel down to Charlotte for their annual preseason meeting with the Carolina Panthers. Why do we always play the Panthers, you may ask? Because Panthers owner Jerry Richardson is a card-carrying member of the FOD (Friends of Dan, as in Rooney). So while the Rooneys and the Richardsons sip Mint Juleps and discuss tee times up in the owners box, we get to see the Panthers at least once every year. Yippee.\n\nTo make a meaningless game even more meaningless, this is the fourth and final game of the preseason for the Black and Gold. The fourth game is the one where coaches are most careful. Anybody with so much as an ingrown toenail sits out because nobody wants to lose a player one short week away from the regular season. Last year, Mike Tomlin announced half the starting line-up wasn\u2019t even going to be in uniform. As of this writing, Coach T hasn\u2019t said much other than Landry Jones would be seeing the bulk of the playing time.\n\nIn other words, feel free to watch the Pittsburgh Pirates unless you\u2019re a degenerate gambler who bet on this game or you really really have a thing for young Landry.\n\nJarvis Jones is not going to suit up. He was hurt last week with what the team is now calling a \u201cdeep bruise.\u201d They\u2019re keeping him out to be safe but he is expected to be good to go for the opener. Isaac Redman has also been ruled out as he continues to work his way back from what the team has been calling a stinger. He is also expected to be ready for Tennessee. All the other running backs (except Le\u2019Veon Bell) are expected to give it a go.\n\nWith Baron Batch getting on with his life\u2019s work, I\u2019m not really sure what the coaches are looking to evaluate vis-a-vis the other running backs. We know LaRod Stephens-Howling is a good pass catching\/third down type back. We know Jonathan Dwyer is a talented but maddeningly inconsistent performer. And we know Felix Jones is, well, Felix Jones. Other than the ignominy of Batch getting cut before Alvester Alexander (who I\u2019d be shocked to see make the team), I have no idea what they need to learn that we don\u2019t already know.\n\nWith cuts down to the final 53 man roster looming on Saturday evening, this will be the final chance for the inept guys on the backup offensive line and the young guys at linebacker to make their case. Assuming the Steelers keep seven or eight O-linemen, six spots are already taken (the five starters plus Kelvin Beachum). That leaves Guy Whimper, John Malecki and Chris Hubbard battling for at least one backup guard position.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steelers are once again awash in promising young linebackers. Rookies Vince Williams and Alan Baxter have been impressing on the field while third year pros Kion Wilson and Chris Carter have experience albeit very limited. Williams, a 2013 6th round draft pick, is likely a lock given his dominating performance last week and status as a Kevin Colbert draftee. Carter was also a Colbert pick who started three games during Injury-Palooza last year but to say his performance was uninspiring is being kind. Again, I haven\u2019t done the math on a 53 man roster but last year the team kept eight linebackers. Assuming they do the same this year, five spots are set (four starters + Jones). Assuming Williams stays for the reasons already mentioned, that leaves Carter, Baxter (a highly impressive undrafted rookie), and Wilson battling for one or two spots.\n\nIt will probably come down to who performs best on special teams. Danny Smith\u2019s crew has been an absolute nightmare this preseason so anybody who stands out on coverage will probably have a leg up on their competition. While they worry about covering kicks and punts, the battle for who will kick those punts continues to rage between Brian Moorman and Drew Butler. As a cherry on top of this crap sammitch, I still don\u2019t think they\u2019ve decided on who is going to be returning kicks and punts. One assumes Stephens-Howling will field kicks but Jones is an accomplished return man, as well.\n\nI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll watch every second of this snoozefest but I will flip over in between innings of the Bucs game. And I\u2019ll do a quick recap tomorrow in advance of the 53 man being announced on Saturday. Until then, #HereWeGo. And #LetsGoBucs.\n\n\nSorry, the comment form is closed at this time.",

        "text":"Lack of suspension angers Ducks\n\nBOSTON -- As much as the Ducks are smarting from Thursday's 6-0 loss to the Boston Bruins at TD Banknorth Garden, they remain at least as sore over what happened two nights earlier in a 3-2, road victory over the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nThe fact that Sabres center Paul Gaustad avoided supplementary discipline from the NHL after delivering a controversial late-game hit that left center Ryan Getzlaf with a broken nose and facial cuts basically has the Ducks mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore.\n\n\"I'm not happy,\" Ducks general manager Bob Murray said after Gaustad was in Buffalo's lineup for Thursday night's 2-1, shootout loss to the Carolina Hurricanes in Raleigh, N.C. \"If we're going to be suspended for blows to the head, then they have to look at the other teams when our guys get hit. This just astounds me that Gaustad is not getting something for this, because that was on purpose and deliberate.\"\n\nWhile Ducks right wing Corey Perry received a four-game suspension for a Jan. 2 elbow to the head of Philadelphia Flyers rookie winger Claude Giroux, defenseman Dion Phaneuf of the Calgary Flames escaped punishment after delivering an elbow that broke the nose of Ducks rookie center Andrew Ebbett on Feb. 11.\n\n\"Corey Perry got suspended for a hit to the head,\" Murray said. \"Why can't other players do it to Anaheim Ducks players and get a suspension? He (Gaustad) jumped up. He left his feet. His helmet or his shoulder could have hit Getzy in the head, and it's totally ridiculous that that wasn't a suspension.\"\n\nColin Campbell, the NHL's senior executive vice president of hockey operations, Murray said, \"told me they looked at it and they didn't feel it was worth anything. They felt he hit him with his helmet. I don't care if he hits him with his helmet, his elbow. Whatever it is, we're supposed to be protecting our players from hits to the head.\"\n\nGetzlaf, who had bit his tongue since the incident, has also had enough.\n\n\"It's embarrassing,\" Getzlaf said. \"It's the same story all the time. They're talking about taking head shots out of the game, and he (Gaustad) goes off and does something like that, and because it's not a nationally televised game or something, nothing happens. The league just sits there. If it happens to (Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney) Crosby or somebody that's in a big market, and it's on a nationally televised game, that's a suspension. It's incredible that that stuff goes on.\"\n\nIronically, the game in Buffalo marked the lone Ducks appearance on Versus this season, but Versus doesn't carry nearly the impact in the hockey world as a Canadian national telecast.\n\nJust as was the case after the Phaneuf hit on Ebbett, television and other media north of the border did not jump all over the Gaustad-Getzlaf story. Late last season, after initially doing nothing, the NHL received additional video supplied by a Canadian television outlet and handed Ducks defenseman Chris Pronger an eight-game suspension for a \"stomping\" incident against Vancouver Canucks center Ryan Kesler.\n\n\"We have our own reputation, I guess, but I think it's more the fact that it's not in the spotlight and it's not all over Canadian TV, where they have to do something,\" Getzlaf said. \"If the media doesn't react to it because it's not a televised game all over Canada ...\n\n\"If the media reacts to it, or I get a concussion or something, suddenly it's a suspension. If it's not a big, major injury, they don't do anything about it.\"\n\nMurray, too, has had it up to here with the common perception of the Ducks, which grew exponentially during the club's march to the 2007 Stanley Cup championship.\n\n\"I don't understand what's going on in this league,\" Murray said. \"A lot was made of that team that won -- the \u2018Big, bad Ducks.' Well, it's not that way anymore, but every scrum on the ice, no matter when there's a scrum, Anaheim's going to get the extra penalty.\n\n\"A perfect example was against LA a week and a half ago in our rink. Scotty Niedermayer goes behind their net, and somehow -- he didn't run the goalie -- they bumped each other. We ended up with an extra two minutes. Their goaltender (rookie Jonathan Quick) got nothing, and he got a free blocker shot to Scotty Niedermayer's head. That is what has been going on, and I do not understand it. I wish somebody could explain it to me.\"\n\nApparently, neither Campbell nor anyone else from the NHL office has done so.\n\n\"They say \u2018No, no, no, no, no,' but it just happens over and over and over again,\" Murray said. \"Our team plays on the edge, yes, and our team takes far too many offensive-zone penalties, stupid penalties. Yes, I understand that. That has to be rectified within our own dressing room, but this other stuff, I'm sorry.\n\n\"Every time there's a scrum, or every time one of our players gets hit in the head, it can't be, \u2018No, it's not a suspension.' I'm sorry. It just can't be that way.\"\n\nRelated stories:\n\nUser Agreement\n\nComments are encouraged, but you must follow our User Agreement\n\nKeep it civil and stay on topic.

Faster? I understand that the Quatro has a bit more tail kick, but the Goya has an earlier nose rocker rise. I've ridden the LS 85 and really like it, but wonder about the performance of the Goya relative to it? Thanks for any comments!\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n22 May '11 | 6:22pm\nGet the 83 kt...\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n24 May '11 | 9:50pm\nMchop... Wrote:\n> Get the 83 kt...\n\nI have a narrow tailed, high rockered twin already for higher winds. I don't need the same in a quad at 84 L, so the KT is out. The question was which quad feels looser\/ faster between the Quatro and Goya 85\/84. I've narrowed my choice down between these two. Thanks!\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n25 May '11 | 8:12am\nHaving tried both...Quatro without a doubt...\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n25 May '11 | 9:54am\nIn my opinion he Goya quad 84L is a lot better than the LS gold quattro quad as it gets planning so much quicker and still grips as well through a turn whilst holding better speed into the top turn in onshore conditions. The LS is the oldest and the stickiest of these three quad shapes and it is not as good as the KT in any aspect despite the KT being labelled as the sideshore board, it is better all round than the LS.\n\nThe KT is a more advanced sailors board so you need to be honest about your ability and where you sail... if your level is anything short of advanced, ie pulling off aerials, and being comfortable on decent sized waves logo + etc then the Goya is better suited. If you sail anywhere with waves less than perfect ie south coast then the goya is better suited.\n\nA way of looking at it is to remember a board like the Goya is easy to sail and will make a reasonable sailor look good whilst the quattro KT is more techincal to sail and if you don't have the advanced skills and the good sailing conditions with which to make the board excel it will easily make a good sailor look very average.\n\nThe bonus of the Goya quad is that it can still be ridden to a level that 99.9% of all sailors will never exceed so unless your Levi Siver this isn't an issue and the answer is pretty straight forward.\n\nIam sure some will like to disagree with this but having ridden all three in mixed conditions for a decent amount of time ... this is my opinion\nHope it helps ....\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n25 May '11 | 4:09pm\nThanks guys.\n\nInterestingly, I'd heard that the Quatro was sticky, but I found it much freer than expected and fairly fast with the track back. I sail a mix of conditions ranging from side-on 2' gutless waves in strong wind to overhead waves with side\/side off wind. Equal mix of jumping (loops), and riding. A fair bit of big swell,high wind bump and jump sailing gets thrown in the mix as well. This last bit is where I thought the Quatro would fall down, but worked quite well,coasting though lulls, boosting off of chop, and remaining pretty slashy for tight backside turns. This mix of conditions also prevents me from looking seriously at the KT, as much as I love the shape.\n\nIf the Goya outperforms the Quatro LS, I'll be a very happy man, as I've just ordered one. Thanks for the input.\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n26 May '11 | 2:48pm\nI spoke to one of the uk quatro riders, said he thought it was all about weight, (he was a lttle guy), he didnt get on with the ls quad, but loved the kt one, iam 90 kgs so the green ones are out for me, not enough range, i used the goya 4 and have used and bought the ls quad, for me its much more \"edgy!\", if that makes sense.\nThat all being said King 1 fully rips on his goya quad, most defo one of the main hombre's on his day, he preferes that to all the others, but for me the kts too small, and the goya were a bit steady!\nIve just read that back, probably not much help at all, Ughh!.\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n29 May '11 | 7:45pm\nI think that weight is a very important factor if it comes to quads. Lighter sailors should go for a KT, heavier should definitely go for the LS.\n\nGuys who tried quatro (those who weigh 75 and less) said that the LS was to hard for them to cutback and they really had to push it hard. They prefered the KT quad much more.\n\nHeavier guys (80+ kgs) prefered the LS as it supplied them with enough volume and float to go in gusts and holes and still they could cutback with some margin of power through the whole turn.\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n31 May '11 | 1:00pm\nReading the waveboard test from Boardseeker featuring the Quatro KT I was surprised that they found the KT to be not as 'hard core' as some of you say. I thought it would obviously shine in DTL conditions but drop off steeply in average uk prevailing conditions.\n\nLike the poster I'm in a similar scenario as to which board to go for.\n\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n7 June '11 | 1:40pm\nHaplessly barging into someone else's post... sorry...\n\nBut I was dragged in by the quatro KT vs.LS comments and rider weight... I'm 72\/73kg and have a 84 tempo as my \"light wind\" board, which I find spot on for me & my local spots... but I am looking for a new partner to it... going on the last few comments would point me toward a KT.\n\nMy first dithering hesitation is I predominantly sail in the SE and I'd not tag myself less hardcore\/advanced more like every other bugger wanna\/am progress\/ing that way (aspirationally speaking). At the moment I have a 76 tempo as the \"partner\", but whilst its a top board, I find it gets too \"lively\" for my liking\/weight at 4.2-ish weather and also is far too close to the 84 in size (too much overlap) hence the desired change.\n\nMy second dithering hesitation is size... 75, or 69? I'm happy with the tempo and a 5.3\/marginal 5.3, no worries...\n\nAnswers on a postcard please... 75LS, 76KT, 69KT...?\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n7 June '11 | 3:39pm\nIf the board is for the smaller end of the sail size spectrum I'd go for the 69 KT. From what I have heard and read the KT is not a difficult board to sail so don't be put off by the 'hardcore' tag. I used to own a rrd hcw xxs which was 69 litres (I'm 83kg). Not hard to sail and v.controllable on a 4.2 down to a 3.\n\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n7 June '11 | 6:51pm\nthink it depends where you sail\n\noften s coast waves best with strong winds and KT69 might be best\n\nhowever if you head down to gwithian bit of extra volume is a winner when trying to get out with gusty x off winds and proper waves and KT76 or Goya 78 might be best bet\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n8 June '11 | 9:04am\nRemember that the quad concept alows You to chose board that is bigger on volume comparing to single fin. For example 85 quad LS has similar bottom surface and dimensions (around 230x57) as an 80 litre single fin.\n\nHope it helps.\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n8 June '11 | 9:22am\nThanks Jon\/Steve, appreciate your thoughts...\n\nAs you suggest, whilst a 69 it fits the wind range for the 2 board quiver it doesn't necessarily fit the wave sailing range perfectly.\nI travel a bit, but most of my sailing is in the SE...\n\nI've think its a (well mulled over) flip a coin decision probably and like you say pretty dependant on sailing\/location\/personality etc.\n\nCheers, Rob.\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n8 June '11 | 9:48am\nSorry Jan, posting at the same time, just seen your reply.\n\nYes - true.\n\nThe tempos are just FSW boards with 2 fins in my eyes (I had quatro FSW previously, stunning board), the 84 works well as my biggest, it 58.5cm by comparison to the LS.\n\nWhat as its partner? I've got a 76 tempo, largely because the quads weren't out and sailing in the SE I didn't think it right to go down the route of a rhythm, anyway - I find the 76 tempo pretty floaty and sail it 5.3m down which is making the 84 a bit redundant, but also means when it gets to 4.2 weather, for my weight the 76 is too lively.\n\nI was interested in the lightweight = kt comment, and the kt 'not as hardcore' comment.\n\nI had a quick shot on a 75LS and found it quick to plane and fast (more than I thought it might be)... it sounds like the kt is of similar ilk.. which is what I was interested in re:\n\nGo for a 75LS\/76KT...\nOr a 69KT?\nRe: Goya Quad Pro 84 VS Quatro LS 85\n22 July '11 | 3:57pm\nI've had the Goya 84 quad now since June. Beautiful board! Compared to my custom 85L twin, it planes much earlier, rips upwind, sets a rail better on a choppy face, jumps higher, and keeps my 90 kgs moving around instead of slogging. It does feel like it has a top speed, but it can't be called slow. It is not nearly as loose as my twin, but it will turn with scalpel like precision as hard as you like. Powered top turns do require a fair bit of effort to turn sharply compared to my twin that pivots on the spot, but it seems like that's just more of a quad trait. Perhaps it could use a little more tail rocker, but that's a small quibble.\n\nThe things I give up on the twin (radical looseness, instant feedback, slashiness) are replaced with great drive, security, upwind speed and totally different sensations when it comes to turning with full effort. From a jumping perspective, I landed few backloops on my twin. I can't figure out why. The Goya, on the otherhand had me landing literally the first one I tried and many more. My backloop success has increased substantially on the Goya. I found my old Evos similar in this respect.\n\nThe Quatro LS would have been been an equally good choice for me I'm sure. Someone in another thread mentioned that it was an old shape and couldn,t stack up against the Goya or KT quad. Well, a great shape is still a great shape 2 or 3 seasons later.\n\ni've kept the twin alongside the quad for a different riding sensation, but the Goya is allowing me to do new things on a wave and is giving me new sensations in turning that feel pretty sweet!\nRe: Goya Qu...

We had our smaller crowd since the first show, and while everyone was pretty much into the show, it was certainly a let down.

        "text":"Next chance of rain to move in this\u00a0weekend\n\nRomero Sisters Living Out Goals With USA\u00a0Softball\n\nThis is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nFor many athletes the highest honor possible is to represent their country in their sport.\n\nThis summer Sydney Romero, an incoming Sooner softball standout, gets to live a life long goal by suiting up for America's Junior Women's National Team.\n\nIn fact, Sydney traded in her cap and gown for cleats this week.\n\nPassing up her high school graduation to train with team USA.\n\n\"It's an honor,\" Sydney said. \"It's been a dream of mine since I was a very young age and now that I'm finally here it's surreal. I can't believe it.\"\n\nOU head coach Patty Gasso\u00a0says she's confident Sydney will become a legendary Sooner.\n\nFormer OU baseball player and USA Junior Team Assistant Tim Walton also had high praise for the Californian.\n\n\"Sydney Romero is one of the best middle infielders in the country,\" Walton said. \"She's not only a great fielder, a great leader, just a very savvy softball player. She has a lot of instincts and a lot of skills and comes from a great family of great softball players and great athletes in general.\"\n\nSpeaking of the Romero's, Sydney's older sister Sierra plays for the Women's National Team, who's also training in OKC this week.\n\nAnd says she's happy to show her sister the ropes for team USA.\n\n\"It's really cool to have her here,\" Sierra said. \"And it's just kind of funny because we look kind of similar, so it's funny. I see her in her uniform and she looks exactly like me so it's nice to experience this with her.\"\n\n\"Just being here with her is amazing,\" Syndey said. \"Like knowing my family is back home I have my sister here with me playing the game we've played our whole life. It just a great opportunity.\"\n\nWhile some thought Sydney, a rising college freshman, may choose to play ball at Michigan with Sierra for her senior season, Sydney chose OU.\n\nA supported decision between sisters.\n\n\"It was my decision to go there,\" Sydney said. \"She did not pressure me at all. People would think she would, but she left it all up to me. She told me, you need to make your decision for the next for years and I did.\"\n\n\"I support her in everything she does and I think she's going to be\u00a0a great fit at OU and I know that Gasso's going to turn her into a great player,\" Sierra said. \"I think the best is yet to come for her.\"\n\nThe Romero sisters, as Sierra puts it, are attached at the hip anytime they're together.\n\nThe duo recently became the first set of sisters to play on the Junior Team and Women's Team at the same time in USA softball history.\n\nAs is the case with most siblings, they don't always see eye to eye.\n\n\"She always rats on me,\" Sydney said. \"Like if I do something and if I like tell my parents on her or something she'll automatically just think of something random. Even if it's a lie. She'll just tell my parents and I'll end up getting in trouble.\"\n\n\"In my defense if she didn't tell on me first I wouldn't have brought something up from the past,\" Sierra said.\n\nFrom there the sisters tossed around a variety of topics, but the one for sure thing is that Sydney and Sierra are there for each other.\n\n\"My favorite thing is our car rides because all we do is sing the whole way,\" Sydney said. \"She cannot sing, so just listening to her just makes me laugh.\"\n\n\"She can't either,\" Sierra said. \"She can't.\"\n\n\"We don't talk softball at all,\" Sierra said. \"Off the field we're just two sisters just having fun. We'll go to the beach. We'll go out to lunch together. Relax in our pajamas all day. She's one of my best friends and she's definitely who I look forward to seeing when I go home.\"\n\n\"Like she said, I like the friendship we have,\" Sydney said. \"She knows pretty much everything about me. I can talk to her about anything whether it has to do with softball or school work or anything. She's always there when I need her.\"",

        "text":"Raking Leafs\n\nMixing metaphors and casting cliches about hockey and the Maple Leafs for the ether's pleasure since MCMLXVII.\n\n\nNo Need for Domi?\n\nThey don't need a veteran with ties to the ownership whose presence could fragment the dressing room. And they don't need a seven-minute-a-night leader.\nI have no qualms with Ulmer's assessment of Domi's potential contributions, unless his mysterious shoulder injury really was hampering his production. But since that is an unknown factor, we'll have to judge what Domi might give us next year based on this past season, and that wasn't much of anything.\nWith a gaping hole in net and wafer thin depth at forward, the last thing Leafs general manager John Ferguson Jr. should be occupying himself with is replacing Tie Domi\nI'm not sure the hole is gaping, as I'm not in favor of making a big splash for a goalie, but I'm coming around to the idea of a $2m per type of guy. With the news of the salary cap increasing by approximately 13%, there is more leeway for JFJ to play with. But back to the man of the (witching) hour.\nBut Tie Domi was a fourth-liner who openly spoke about himself as one of the Leafs leaders, a 20-point a season guy who falsely saw himself as a difference maker. His biggest impact on a series came in 2001, when he elbowed the New Jersey Devils' Scott Niedermayer and changed the course of a playoff the Leafs were on the edge of winning.\n\nFrankly, I'm shocked and honestly pleased at how this article is so matter-of-fact. Kudos.\n\nRegardless of the arithmetic of buying out and replacing Domi, which by the way is negligible one way or the other, the real issue is building a winning team. And the answer to that riddle doesn't include Domi. Atleast, not anymore.\n\nUPDATE - On the draft front, Sportnet has a Top-60 Prospect list that should come in handy. And from the random idea department, I wonder if Don Cherry would ever publish his preferred 'home town' picks before the draft, given how he is always harping how Ontario boys are overlooked by the Leafs. Come on, Don, give us a list of even just three names. Or better yet, give your list to JFJ privately and help the guy out.\n\nUPDATE 2 - Spector has a gem of a quote from JFJ. Get this, Fergie says \"that Domi's play wasn't 'positively affected by the changes in the NHL's rules' and that they're looking at his situation. He said that Tie was signed for two years and that he's been a solid contributor to the team both on and off the ice. He said he was aware of the reports saying that the team was looking at buying him out, but added \"don't believe everything you read.\"\n\nCongrats to Spector for taking the plunge into full time freelance hockey journalism. Be sure to visit his site and click an ad or two. I still can't believe he maintained such a high level of excellence when it was only a part-time gig for him. Them military boys are amazing sometimes.\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n<< Home",

        "text":"Pro bike: Damiano Cunego's Lampre Wilier Triestina Cento Uno\n\nThe steed of the Piccolo Principe\n\nThe 2008 Tour de France was not a vintage one for Damiano Cunego.\u00a0 The 2004 Giro d\u2019Italia winner skipped his national tour in favour of an all-out tilt at success in la Grande Boucle, but a combination of poor form and a huge slice of bad luck forced him to abandon the race two days before Paris\n\nThat bad luck \u2013 in the form of a nasty face-first crash into a concrete barrier and its subsequent injuries \u2013 also cost him his lead in the ProTour classification by preventing him from being competitive in the Cl\u00e1sica San Sebasti\u00e1n.\u00a0 As if that weren\u2019t enough, it even prompted him to withdraw from the Italian Olympic team for Beijing.\n\nWhile Cunego himself hasn\u2019t had the best time as of late, as least he has a new bike from team sponsor Wilier Triestina. \u00a0His new Cento Uno evolves from the existing Cento frame and now includes an integrated seat post, which supposedly saves 120g.\u00a0 Less immediately obvious are crankset bearings which are directly integrated into the oversized bottom bracket shell.\u00a0 Wilier says this system integrates seamlessly with most cranksets - Campagnolo being the natural default - but composite spacers are available for others.\n\nThough Cunego\u2019s custom-sized frame bears a number of features of the production Cento Uno, it is clearly not a production machine.\u00a0 For instance, where the stock Cento Uno has pronounced asymmetric chain stays \u2013 where the drive side one actually curves downwards \u2013 and uniquely \u2018suspended\u2019 dropouts, Cunego\u2019s frame has much straighter chain stays and rather conventional-looking two-piece aluminium dropouts.\u00a0\n\nAccording to Wilier Triestina PR man Mark Deterline, Cunego\u2019s frame is a pre-production creation that marks \u201cthe progression from the Le Rois the team uses as their standard models and the Centos Cunego rides, to the Cento Uno production model.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis perhaps shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise as it\u2019s the norm for manufacturers to use their sponsored teams and riders for valuable feedback on test mules.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLampre doesn\u2019t try to hide the bikes at events, or make Cunego change bikes for interviews or public training sessions,\u201d Deterline continued. \u201cIn fact, [Wilier Triestina is] kind of proud of this way of working, because it leaves them freedom to experiment before committing to final production designs.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Lampre star also gets a special black, silver and white paint scheme to match the white ProTour jersey that he\u2019d held since finishing fourth in June\u2019s Tour de Suisse.\u00a0 The only colour that appears anywhere on the frame is the Italian tricolore detail on the fork ends.\n\nLampre\u2019s groupsets are supplied by Campagnolo, and Cunego\u2019s bike has an almost complete Record groupset.\u00a0 The exception to the Italian company\u2019s top gruppo is the Chorus front derailleur whose steel cage is more durable than Record\u2019s carbon one, according to the Lampre mechanics. The remainder of the groupset is a fairly conventional affair with a 170mm chainset, fitted with 53 and 39 tooth rings, an 11-25T cassette and the ubiquitous \u201cRed\u201d edition Ergopower levers that have a slightly stiffer action than standard.\n\nCampagnolo subsidiary Fulcrum is the Lampre wheel sponsor and Cunego\u2019s bike is fitted with a pair of its feathery Racing Light tubulars.\u00a0 With their carbon rims and oversized aluminium hubs they weigh in at a claimed 1280g a pair and are some of the flightiest hoops in the pro peloton.\u00a0 Pairing these lightweight wheels with Vittoria\u2019s hardy Pav\u00e9 Evo-CG tubulars might seem a strange choice, but despite their 24mm section they are only a few grams heavier than the more usual Corsa Evo-CX.\u00a0 Moreover, they are slightly more comfortable, provide better grip and wear longer.\n\nThe bike\u2019s finishing kit is supplied entirely by US company Ritchey.\u00a0 The integrated seatpost is topped by Ritchey\u2019s \u201cstubby\u201d head, which clamps itself to both the top of the carbon tube and the braided carbon rails of the fi\u2019zi:k Arione saddle.\u00a0 Up front, a \u201cwet white\u201d Ritchey WCS 4-Axis stem \u2013 which matches the frame nicely \u2013 clamps a pair of traditional bend WCS Classic bars.\u00a0 We caught the bike as it was just being built and before the bar tape was fitted, but rest assured it was wrapped in Gist Super Ribbon in time for the first stage start.\n\nNow not going to Beijing this month, Cunego will be taking some time out to recover from his Tour de France injuries, so it\u2019s not quite clear when we\u2019ll see him race next. It\u2019s possible that he will look to build his late season form at the Vuelta a Espana as he did last year, and as a shoo-in for his national team he should feature in the Squadra Azzura as they host the World Championships in September. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHeal up, Damiano, your bike is waiting for you.\n\n\nBack to top",

He shot a closing-round 73 and finished T2 with Tim Clark at -25, three back. Ogilvie joked \u201cThe rain dance didn\u2019t work. I was trying for a rainout today, but that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSaid Leonard of this victory, his first in 22 months since the 2003 Honda, \u201cit will inspire me a bit, knowing that one is not enough.

Photo by Don Mann.\nKelsia Orrin\nKelsea Orrin. Photo by Don Mann.\n\n\nLast year the Woodinville volleyball team placed fourth at the Class 4A state tournament \u2014 its best finish in school history by far\u2014 and the Lady Falcons are back to take another run at it.\n\nBut first things first for fourth-year coach Mike Mills, as last year is just a fond memory.\n\n\"Right now we\u2019re still figuring out who our setter\u2019s going to be,\" he said of the critical position that sets the offense in motion. \"We have three players battling for that spot right now and we\u2019ll learn more after we play a couple preseason games.\"\n\nMills, however, has the luxury of one sure thing: Ali Forde is back for her senior year, good for the coach and a big problem for the rest of the KingCo conference.\n\nThe 6 foot, 2 inch wrecking ball was first team all-state last season \u2014 the only junior between the Puget Sound and the Idaho border to earn the honor \u2014 and according to Mills has gotten better.\n\n\"She can hit outside, hit middle, she can pass and serve and plays great defense up front and in the back,\" he said. \"She\u2019s an all-around player without a doubt, and she\u2019ll be on the court a lot. We have high expectations for her and she has high goals for herself.\"\n\nAlways a leader by example, Forde now steps into a more vocal leadership role with the void left by the graduation of Melissa Gilkey and Carmen Vasilatos, a role she can handle, Mills said.\n\n\"Oh yeah, what\u2019s driving her right now is she just wants the team to succeed. She had a lot of fun last year ending state on a high note, not just being a great player but having her team play along at that great level, too.\"\n\nSeniors Ashtyn Mann, Kelsea Orren and Jen Schnelle all dipped their toes in the state tournament waters and are slated for the starting lineup.\n\n\"Ashtyn\u2019s 6-2, will play in the middle, strong, great vertical, getting her angles down,\" Mills said. \"Kelsea is vying for the setter position, played a lot of backcourt for us last year but can play anywhere. And we moved Jen to libero this year. She was a setter but now it\u2019ll be a full time defensive gig for her. She played a lot of defense at state and we\u2019re real excited about what she\u2019s turned into as a senior.\"\n\nSenior Andie Kelly and juniors Hailey Chapman and Maddy Young appear to have the inside track to be the other starters, Mills said, though nothing was set in stone before even the jamboree was played.\n\nKelly\u2019s a competitive 6-footer who\u2019s made great strides, Chapman is a high-jumping outside hitter who can set, too, and Young, Mills said, \"might surprise some people this year.\" Also in the mix at setter is junior Brooke Wiley, who played a bit at state as a sophomore serving specialist and gained some big-game experience.\n\nWhat does Mills like best about this group?\n\n\"The neat thing is they really get along well together,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a natural chemistry that clicks. Things have been very smooth so far which is cool, and never a given with teenagers.\"\n\nThe Lady Falcons jump right into the frying pan, traveling to traditional powerhouses Edmonds-Woodway and Graham-Kapowsin this week and then participating in the Adidas Tournament at Auburn-Mountainview to face quality opponents before KingCo play begins.\n\nThe big question right now is who will establish herself at setter, and this time next week Mills will have a much better idea of who can put the ball in the window consistently. So far, he likes what he sees on defense.\n\n\"I feel we\u2019re ahead defensively right now of where we were (the sametime) last year \u2014 which was a pretty good team but we struggled a bit early.\n\n\"We just need to play some other teams. There\u2019s only so much you can learn playing against yourself.\"\n\nShare this post\n\nSubmit to FacebookSubmit to Google PlusSubmit to Twitter",
