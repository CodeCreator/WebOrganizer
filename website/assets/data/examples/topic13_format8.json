Be sure to include your full mailing address.\n\nPhoto Use Policy & Fees\n\nThe Morrison County Historical Society (MCHS) has been entrusted with the permanent care of the photographs in its collections. Due to the popularity of this collection, we receive many requests for photo reproductions. In order to preserve and maintain our photo collection, MCHS has adopted a photo use policy and a set of fees related to reproduction and commercial use.\n\nPhoto Use Policy (Conditions for the Publication, Display, or Broadcast of Photographs)\n\nMCHS has a Photo Use Policy for those who wish to use reproductions from our collections.\n\nFor both commercial and non-profit photo reproduction, the Morrison County Historical Society (MCHS) requires that a \u00adCommercial\/Public Use \u00adPermission Form be filled out and submitted prior to the reproduction of requested materials.\u00a0 In \u00adaddition to reproduction costs, MCHS may also charge a \u00adseparate commercial use fee.\u00a0 Those seeking permission to publish, display, or broadcast reproductions of photographs in the collections must complete the form prior to placing their order.\u00a0 Please read the following conditions carefully.\u00a0 Return the completed Permission Form to the Morrison County Historical Society, 2151 South Lindbergh Drive, PO Box 239, Little Falls, MN 56345.\n\n1.\u00a0 Credit must be given to the Morrison County Historical Society and the creator of the work, if known.\n2.\u00a0 The credit line for each photo will be supplied by MCHS. Credit lines must appear with the image or in a credit section of the work.\n3.\u00a0 If the copyright is still in effect, the publisher must seek permission from the creator of the work or his\/her heirs.\u00a0 MCHS will \u00adprovide the creator\u2019s name, if known.\n4.\u00a0 Federal Copyright Law prevents MCHS from reproducing photographs from books and other media which are protected by copyright law or from supplying copyrighted works to those MCHS has reason to believe will violate said laws.\n5.\u00a0 Permission to reproduce, publish, broadcast, or display a photograph from MCHS collections must be requested in writing via a completed \u00adCommercial\/Public Use Permission Form.\n6.\u00a0 Possession of a photo from MCHS does not constitute permission to use it.\n7.\u00a0 Permission is for one-time use only.\u00a0 The Morrison County Historical Society retains all rights to the works and they must not be used for any purpose other than that listed on the permission form. If a digital scan is requested, the \u201cone-time use only\u201d provision still applies.\n8.\u00a0 MCHS reserves the right to refuse to grant permission and\/or provide photographic reproduction services to publishers and individuals who have not complied with its policies.\n9.\u00a0 Commercial users must pay the commercial use fee and reproduction fee in advance of receiving the photo reproductions.\n10.\u00a0 MCHS reserves the right to decline to reproduce fragile or restricted items.\n11. MCHS will not provide negatives of photographs.\n12.\u00a0 In some cases, MCHS may request that one copy of printed works (books, brochures, magazines, newspaper articles or ads) be \u00addonated for its files.\n\nPhoto Reproduction Fees\n\nStandard black & white and color photocopies of MCHS photos will be charged at the normal per copy rate.

Digital scans of a higher quality or quantity will be recorded to a CD-RW provided by the Morrison County Historical Society. Cost of the CD-RW, on top of the per image scan, is $3.00 plus tax, if applicable. In order to maintain the integrity of our computer systems, we cannot accept blank CD-RWs from those requesting digital reproductions.\n\nCommercial Use Fees\n\nIn addition to reproductions costs, those who intend to use MCHS photos for commercial purposes (i.e. advertising, book publishing, website, broadcasting, business display, etc.), will be charged a commercial use fee based on the type of use. For specific commercial use fees, please contact us.\n\nThe Commercial Use Fee does not apply to photos reproduced for personal use, for news items, or for non-profit or educational use.\n\nPhoto Use Request for Permission\n\nFor both commercial and non-commercial photo reproduction of a quality higher than a standard photocopy, the Morrison County Historical Society requires that a\u00a0Commercial\/Public Use \u00adPermission Form be filled out and submitted prior to the reproduction of requested materials. This form can be picked up at The Charles A. Weyerhaeuser Memorial Museum, or download and print the pdf version.

I am considering research that would involve taking photos of the front page of the local paper from the date WW I was declared, and photos of several of local advertisements from the inside of the paper for historical context.

The Team will discuss your queries and advise accordingly.\n\nAdvertising Of Personal Publications\nIn common with the membership, the Trustees are keen to know of new publications relating to the Gallipoli campaign, and we welcome news of new books etc, particularly those written by our members.

Inclusion of our URL would also be appreciated. After all, we can assist in the creation of even more good books if this is done.\n\nSubject matter\nThis forum is specifically designed to discuss matters relating to the Gallipoli\/Dardanelles Campaign of the Great War. Clearly, on occasion, discussion necessarily drifts into related areas and this is permissible. Discussions and posts on modern-day politics or religion will not be tolerated in any area of the forum. Always post in the appropriate area for your topic and don't post similar messages in multiple areas. Messages posted that are irrelevant to the discussion and designed to distract or disrupt will be deleted without warning.\n\nAny Forum member who posts SPAM or links to Pornographic or other such sites will automatically be deleted from the Forum membership and their email blocked.

If second and subsequent registrations are detected the moderators may take action to close, suspend or otherwise render all but one registration inactive. Repeated attempts to register extra memberships, or the use of one membership to discuss in any way another existing membership opened by the same individual, will, once detected, lead to immediate closure of all membership accounts on the grounds of bringing the Forum into disrepute.\nRegistrations for membership of the Gallipoli Association Forum will only be accepted once a valid email address is shown by the applicant. Any registration without a valid email address MAY be deleted by the Forum Administrators.\n\nSuspension or termination of membership\nIn the case where these rules are violated, your membership of the Forum may be terminated and access blocked; alternatively a members posts may be made subject to moderator sight before they appear in the forum.
