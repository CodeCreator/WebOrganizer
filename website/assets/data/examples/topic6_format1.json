Playing on bills with internationally touring superstars like Victor Wooten, EOTO, Primus, The Roots, Matisyahu, Members of G-Unit, Rusted Root and Parliament Funkadelic have helped build an enthusiastic fan base.\n\nIowa City electronic\/jazz\/rock quartet Slip Silo celebrated the release of its first full length album, Monsoons, on April 14th, 2012, the follow-up to the group\u2019s 2009 self-titled EP. Formed in the summer of 2008, Slip Silo is comprised of talented, thoughtful musicians who studied jazz and who have appeared in groups such as Koplant No, OSG, Big Funk Guarantee, The Critical Hour, New Beat Society, and many more. The band combines a variety of influences to create a unique sound that listeners find delightfully difficult to classify.\n\nBryce Janey is an outstanding blues\/rock axe slinger from Marion, Iowa. He began his career at the age of 13, touring regionally and nationally from Chicago to Los Angeles with a blues-rock trio called the Janey's. Bryce began his solo career in 1995 and has received widespread praise and accolades ever since.

During its recording, they band worked with Grammy award winning producer and engineer Gary Paczos (Alison Krauss and Union Station, Dolly Parton).\n\nAn indie artist from Richmond, Virginia, and one of the producers for albums by artists such as The Counting Crows, Jason Molina and Magnolia Electric Company, David Lowery has recently decided it is time to debut a solo record. His new CD, The Palace Guards, comes alongside successful projects as a lead singer and guitarist with rockers Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven. His debut solor project features thoughtful yet simplistic lyrical work and mellow electric guitar.\n\nThankful Dirt, the indie\/Americana Des Moines-based duo of Darren & Molly Matthews, strums and sings while crafting an intimate look into the lives and pain of the everyman while finding a way to calm your soul. The beauty in Thankful Dirt\u2019s music comes not only from Molly\u2019s powerful, soul snatching vocals but also from the unique relationship the two share in the project. Together they ignite a sound both unique and universally appealing. Music lovers \u2018dig\u2019 Thankful Dirt.\n\nBig Blue Sky started as a father-son duo in the mid-90s by Jon Stravers Sr and Jon-Jon Stravers. Their musical style includes the influence of folk, bluegrass, blues, and reggae. In their music they seek a closer connection to the planet, and indeed their musical writing comes from the inspiration of wild places and a celebration of our natural heritage and the natural rhythms of life.\n\nWhitney Mann is an old soul with a child's glow. Her story is only beginning. It's the story of a poetic farm girl from Michigan who grew up to open for Loretta Lynn. It's the story of a young woman whose voice will break your heart but whose songs will bring you back for more. Her new package of country ballads and barn tales is called The Western Sky.\n\nAveraging over 100 shows per year, Chad Elliott has been on the road for more than a decade performing a blend of roots, blues and folk music. He has played across the country and has been lauded as a modern-day troubadour.\n\nThe Awful Purdies are an eclectic quintet of female multi-instrumentalists who take turns stepping up as song writer and lead singer. The ensemble purdify's each song they meet, letting the song lead the way. One song might require channeling the Andrew's Sisters, while another song might reach out to a rock-a-billy or Motown sensibility.\n\nThe Candymakers of Davenport, Iowa offer a sound that is contemporary, yet keeps the essence of old-school groove bands of music past. Emulating the many talents of artists such as Ben Harper, Aretha Franklin and BB King, it\u2019s important to the band to produce an original sound that keeps fans craving for more.\n\nSongwriters Sam Knutson and Milk & Eggs (Jordan Sellergren) have recently collaborated for The Englert Theatre's Iowa City Song Project, recording their duet \"Up the Street From You\" as part of the Englert's centennial celebration.\n\nLindsay Lou & the Flatbellys are giving a nod to American traditional music, while boldly taking their own songs in new directions. Distinct vocals, tight harmonies, instrumental expertise, and creative arrangements are all essential characteristics of their unique sound. The group focuses on the original tunes of Lindsay Lou Rilko, which include true-life tales of bank-robbing aunties, moonshinin' grandpas, and celebrations of love, life, and nature.\n\nCaroline Smith and Jesse Schuster\u2014of Caroline Smith and the Good Night Sleeps\u2014will play a special duo performance on November 2nd for IPR\u2019s Java Blend. This past summer, Caroline and Jesse toured as a duo, appearing at a small handful of intimate shows hosted in people's houses and living rooms across the Midwest.\u00a0\n\nMike Mangione & The Union is a touring group that combines a folk-rock sound with an orchestrated string section, soulful vocals and literate sensibility. The band\u2019s debut album, Tenebrae, received favorable press from all corners of the country, including the honor of being an All Music Guide Album Pick, while Blurt refers to their \u201ctearstained folk, Memphis-styled gospel and bluesy-flavored pop\u201d as \u201cluminous.\u201d\n\nVicki and Joe Price, a husband and wife blues duo, combine talents on this energetic crowd pleaser released on their own label, Blues Acres Productions. Fun and spunky guitar riffs that make you stomp your feet, bob your head, and smile explode right out of the gate and don\u2019t quit until the album is done.\n\nVicki\u2019s powerful bluesy voice evokes an image of a woman in a 1920\u2019s speakeasy singing her heart out.\n\nNo secrets between friends, ignorance is bliss. Brooks Strause\u00a0is a singer, songwriter and musician from Iowa. Since first crawling out of incapacitating melancholy to begin playing music in the late nineteen-nineties when he was in high school, Brooks has written hundreds of songs, played numerous shows in and around Iowa, and toured in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Giving Tree Band's third full-length and most recent release, \"The Joke, The Threat & The Obvious,\" spent multiple weeks on various radio charts (peaking at #15 on the Roots Music Report and #39 on the Americana Airplay Chart).\n\nA seasoned 4-piece band based in the Quad Cities, Jim the Mule blends the twang of country with the gritty rock & roll textures of the late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s in order to produce something best described as Midwestern Alt-Country.\n\nWith a successful presence at SXSW and Summerfest 2012, plus airplay on 140 college radio stations, The Future Laureates are celebrating with unabashed energy and triumph. Offering positive punk-rock energy with folk\/pop musicianship, their sonic champagne is frothing and bubbling with the release of their third studio album, FORTRESS SESSIONS. It is seriously full of fun.\n\nThe release of Side 2 exposes a different view of Des Moines musician Tony Bohnenkamp. For nearly twenty years Tony has been active in the music industry, but Side 2 marks the life-long musician\u2019s debut solo album. Tony has played just about every role \u2014 owner of a successful recording studio, well-known dueling pianist, drummer for The Nadas, singer for Lunchbox, not to mention producer\/songwriter\/composer \u2014 but now it\u2019s time for Tony to showcase his own material. \u201cEvery project I\u2019ve ever worked on has been for someone else.\n\nWisconsin based singer-songwriter Jeremiah Nelson is constantly creating and reinventing his music with an ever-evolving cast of characters. \u201cDrugs to Make You Sober\u201d, Jeremiah Nelson\u2019s new solo record feels like a real labor of love. It\u2019s made up of seemingly traditional rock arrangements adorned with beautiful atmospheric and dreamy sonic wanderings.There\u2019s something lonely and heartbreaking hiding underneath Nelson\u2019s sonic layerings.\n\nThe Feralings are Benj Upchurch (mandolin \/ vocals), Nicole Upchurch (clawhammer banjo \/ vocals), Patrick Bloom (upright bass \/ vocals), and Stacy Webster (acoustic guitar \/ vocals), but the name is a bit of a misnomer, as the members of the band are far more likely to invite you to sit down and enjoy a cup of tea than they are to jump you and steal your beer money.\n\nBegun as a side project between singer\/songwriter Jen McClung and her husband, poet\/musician Jim Coppoc, the Gatehouse Saints cover great lyricists from Leonard Cohen to Trent Reznor to the Dixie Chicks, and use these influences to build their own original music.\n\nWith story songs that search for community and shared meaning, Jen Chapin creates a funk and soul inspired k...

Not only can perchlorates, which are a class of salts, serve as an energy source for potential Martian microorganisms, they are also a sensitive marker of past climate and can lead to the formation of liquid brines under current conditions on the planet. All this was discovered by the rover \u201cCuriosity\u201d on the martian surface, which touched down in August of 2012. While the instruments on Curiosity won\u2019t tell us if microorganisms ever once infected Mars, however, this is the most definitive evidence yet that life could have formed on Mars, plus, it gives us another situation in which life could have started here on Earth.

For club consumption, there are nu-Disco and Deep House mixes by Jody Wisternoff, HOSH, and Piemont.\n\nImage Courtesy of Armada.\n\nSONGS OF THE DAY:\u00a0 Disco Fries ft Amba Tremain \u2013 Love Me Right and Disco Fries and Loopers \u2013 Exposure\n\n\nOftentimes you will notice that producer\/DJs alternate big room EDM tracks with commercial, vocal songs to show both their talent in the studio and to expand their reach in various arenas.\u00a0 New York-based duo and frequent collaborators with lovable long-haired prankster producer Tommie Sunshine (as Fries and Shine), Disco Fries does just that with their recent releases.\u00a0\u00a0 Released during the Winter Music Conference, \u201cLove Me Right\u201d is an energetic hands-in-the-air commercial electro record featuring a diva vocal performance by Amba Tremain (recently heard on Boy George\u2019s album \u2018This is What I Do\u2019). The song stands out for just that reason \u2013 you can count on one hand the number of recent tracks where you hear a singer with a strong voice really SINGING boldly \u2013 and the lyrics almost qualify as Nu-House since those classic themes haven\u2019t been explored in dance music lately.\u00a0 Teamed with rising Dutch producer Loopers (who recently did a banging remix of the Matthew Koma vocal version of Showtek\/Justin Prime collab \u201cCannonball (Earthquake)\u201d), the Disco Fries duo unleash the banging big room track \u201cExposure,\u201d which combines many of the current electro sounds with a progressive-sounding drop.\u00a0 The contrast of the hard and soft make the track stand out from recent releases as well.\u00a0 These two tracks show their depth as producers and when combined with their energetic DJ performances (as seen multiple times during Winter Music Conference), it\u2019s easy to see why they continue to rise in the world of EDM.\n\nImages courtesy of Zouk\/Armada and Powerhouse.\n\nErik Arbores Interview (ADE 2013)\n\n\nDiscovered at age 14 by Armin van Buuren and signed to Armada records, Erik Arbores (born Erik van den Boom) is the youngest DJ to ever spin during the Amsterdam Dance Event.\u00a0\u00a0His debut Bliss EP created a lot of buzz and garnered a lot of club support.\u00a0\u00a0He has gone on to collaborate with Esmee Denters and has recently signed to Universal and Spinnin\u2019 records.\u00a0\u00a0Together with Martin Garrix, TV Noize, and Julian Jordan, he is part of a group of teenage up-and-coming producers who are changing the EDM world.\n\nDJ Ron Slomowicz: How old were you when you first discovered EDM?\nErik Arbores: I have been listening to it my whole life, but I started producing when I was 11 or 12 years old.",

In their trenchant and passionately observed documentary, Bill and Turner Ross render palpable the unease and uncertainty of decent, hardworking folk as they are buffeted by forces beyond their control, including senseless acts of torture, murders committed just outside their homes, and the temporary USDA ban on livestock trade. Drawing on archetypes of rugged individualism and community, Western focuses on Mayor Chad Foster, who presides over Eagle Pass with a winning, conspiratorial smile; Jos\u00e9 Manuel Maldonado, his kindly Piedras Negras mayoral counterpart; and Martin Wall, a cattle rancher whose Marlboro Man stoicism melts away in the presence of his young daughter, Brylyn. Western firmly positions the Ross brothers at the frontier of a new, compelling kind of American vernacular cinema.\n\n\nIFC Center\n\nTim Burton put the goth back in Gotham for his hit 1992 sequel BATMAN RETURNS, which features a villainess who finds her strength through kinky black bondage wear, a theme song by goth queen Siouxsie and the Banshees and a script by black comedy genius Daniel Waters (HEATHERS). Though it was criticized by parental groups for being too dark, BATMAN RETURNS nonetheless struck a chord with a generation of \u201cmiddle-American, tortured oddballs\u201d like our guest presenter, performance artist and goth opera wunderkind Joseph Keckler, who remembers being \u201centranced by the deformed and power-hungry Penguin (Danny DeVito) and even more by the revelation of Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer): undergoing a vampire-like interspecies resuscitation, she transforms from the scattered, apologetic and subservient Selina Kyle to an oversexed vigilante, whip in hand. Still floating around in the collective unconscious of my generation, like trash in the sewers of Gotham, are fantasies of being with her and being her, of coming back to life with claws.\u201d Join us for a fabulously fun screening!\n\n\nDEATH LAID AN EGG, Giulio Questi\nAnthology Film Archives\n\nGiulio Questi\u2019s giallo-on-acid, a pop art manifesto against mass production, takes the plot of Henri-Georges Clouzot\u2019s DIABOLIQUE and turns it into something truly bizarre. Marco (Jean-Louis Trintignant) occupies the center of a love triangle involving his wife (Gina Lollobrigida) and her luscious niece (Ewa Aulin), at the high-tech chicken farm they run \u2013 and this busy man still finds the time to kill prostitutes on the side. This is poultry art at its best!\n\n\nAnthology Film Archives\n\nA musician accidentally kills the stalker who had been menacing him over the phone. The killing is witnessed by a masked figure, and soon the musician is being blackmailed. One by one everyone around him turns up dead, making him the prime suspect. In this final installment of the ANIMAL TRILOGY, Argento takes his visual stylistics and set pieces to another level. Long unavailable, the film is presented in a rare archival 35mm print. Starring Michael Brandon and Mimsy Farmer.\n\n\n\n\nPARABELLUM, Lukas Valentina RInner\nFilm Society of Lincoln Center\n\nA Buenos Aires office worker finishes his day, visits his father in a rest home, lodges his cat in a kennel, and cancels his phone service. (Did you overhear the news report of riots and social unrest on the radio?) The next day, he and 10 equally nondescript individuals are transported up the Tigre delta in blindfolds and arrive at a secluded, well-appointed resort for a vacation with a difference. Instead of yoga and nature walks, the days\u2019 activities range from hand-to-hand combat and weapons instruction to classes in botany and homemade explosives. Welcome to boot camp for preppers, the destination of choice for the serious Apocalypse Tourist. Austrian filmmaker Lukas Valenta Rinner handles his material in his home country\u2019s familiar style, with cool distance, minimal dialogue, and carefully composed frames, interpolating the action with extracts from the invented Book of Disasters, a must-read for anyone warming up for the collapse of civilization as we know it. People, are you in?\n\n\nCHRISTMAS, AGAIN, Charles Poekel\nFilm Society of Lincoln Center\n\nA forlorn Noel (Kentucker Audley) pulls long, cold nights as a Christmas-tree vendor in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. As obnoxious, indifferent, or downright bizarre customers come and go, doing little to restore Noel\u2019s faith in humanity, only the flirtatious innuendos of one woman and the drunken pleas of another seem to lift him out of his funk. Writer-director Charles Poekel has transformed three years of \u201cfieldwork\u201d peddling evergreens on the streets of New York into a sharply observed and wistfully comic portrait of urban loneliness and companionship. While Christmas, Again heralds a promising newcomer in Poekel, it also confirms several great young talents of American indie cinema: actors Audley and Hannah Gross, editor Robert Greene, and cinematographer Sean Price Williams.\n\n\nAnthology Film Archives\n\nJane (the queen of giallo, Edwige Fenech) is plagued by a recurring nightmare after losing her unborn child in a car accident. Her busy husband Richard (George Hilton) deals with it by plying her with pills, while her sister books sessions for her at the doctor. Things take a turn for the worse when the creepy blue-eyed man from her nightmares materializes in real life, and the upstairs neighbor enlists her in satanic rituals. Set in Swinging London, ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK is graced by Sergio Martino\u2019s impeccable camera work and Bruno Nicolai\u2019s terrific score.\n\n\nLight Industry\n\nAdynata and Mayhem, two crucial works of experimental film from the 1980s, pursue a radical aesthetic agenda not merely on the level of content, but of form. They stand as living, moving arguments for a film language that is not only critical but generative. Rejecting all manner of constricting binaries\u2014East and West, male and female, heterosexual and homosexual\u2014this is not merely a deconstruction of cinema but its reconstruction. \u201cFilm has depended on voyeuristic active\/passive mechanisms,\u201d Mulvey notes in the final lines of her essay. \u201cWomen, whose image has continually been stolen and used for this end, cannot view the decline of the traditional film form with anything much more than sentimental regret.\u201d\n\n\nTENEBRAE, Dario Argento\nAnthology Film Archives\n\nAn American writer travels to Rome to present his new novel only to find himself implicated in a killing spree whose perpetrator is taking cues from his book. In one of his most personal films, the master of horror fires back at the wave of criticism that he was facing at the time. Featuring an outstanding score by Goblin (DEEP RED, SUSPIRIA), an infamous crane shot, and one of the most memorable chase scenes between man and dog ever filmed, this rare uncut 35mm print of TENEBRAE is not to be missed!\n\n\n\n\nI AM CUBA, Mikhail Kalatozov\n\nThis retina-dazzling agitprop masterwork is Soviet filmmaker Mikhail Kalatozov\u2019s delirious dream vision of the Cuban revolution, in which the Felliniesque decadence of Batista-era Havana gives way to the explosion of Castro\u2019s guerrilla uprising. A head-spinning mix of Constructivist aesthetics and sensuous photography, I Am Cuba pulses with \u201csome of the most exhilarating camera movements and most luscious black-and-white cinematography you\u2019ll ever see\u201d (Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader).\n\n\nFilm Society of Lincoln Center\n\nNadav Lapid\u2019s follow-up to his explosive debut, Policeman, is a brilliant, shape-shifting provocation and a coolly ambiguous film of ideas. Nira (Sarit Larry), a fortysomething wife, mother, and teacher in Tel Aviv, becomes obsessed with one of her charges, Yoav (Avi Shnaidman), a 5-year-old with a knack for declaiming perfectly formed verses on love and loss that would seem far beyond his scope. The impassive prodigy\u2019s inexplicable bursts of poetry\u2014Lapid\u2019s own childhood compositions\u2014awaken in Nira a protective impulse, but as her actions grow more extreme, the question of what exactly she\u2019s protecting remains very much open. The Kindergarten Teacher shares the despair of its heroine, all too aware that she lives in an age and culture that has little use for poetry. But there is something perversely romantic in the film\u2019s underlying conviction: in an ugly world, beauty still has the power to drive us mad.\n\n\nNitehawk Cinema\n\nFour sexy college girls plan to fund their spring break getaway by burglarizing a fast food shack. But that\u2019s only the beginning. During a night of partying, the girls hit a roadblock when they are arrested on drug charges. Hungover and clad only in bikinis, the girls appear before a judge but are bailed out unexpectedly by Alien, an infamous local thug who takes them under his wing and leads them on the wildest Spring Break trip in history. Rough on the outside but with a soft spot inside, Alien wins over the hearts of the young Spring Breakers, and leads them on a Spring Break they never could have imagined.\n\n\nAnthology Film Archives\n\nA wheelchair-bound heiress is murdered, and a chain of killings ensue, as everyone who has a stake in the pie struggles to eliminate anyone standing in the way of the inheritance. The situation is complicated by a group of teens who decide to go camping by the lake on the estate. Widely regarded as a pioneer of the slasher sub-genre, Bava\u2019s high-body-count murder mystery is one of his most influential works.\n\n\nAnthology Film Archives\n\nDick (Ray Lovelock) and Ingrid (a teenage Ornella Muti) finance their carefree lifestyle by smuggling pornography from...
