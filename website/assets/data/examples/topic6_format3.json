        "text":"Support Ballo Baroque\n\nBallo has exciting plans for the future including several modern day premieres of Baroque operas and instrumental pieces both in concert and on recording; with interesting performances at venues throughout London. \u00a0We hope that you will consider helping to secure our future success by supporting the revival of beautiful music that has not been heard for centuries.\u00a0 We will gratefully accept help in many different ways, fiscal sponsorship is our most obvious and essential need, but we would also be happy to talk with you about other creative kinds of assistance: space for a performance, the loan of an instrument, or any number of other things that can insure our growth and vitality.\n\nIf you are interested in donating to Ballo\u2019s future work and performances please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us. \u00a0Curious about the best way to provide a donation? \u00a0Please send us an email or give us a call. \u00a0In addition to fiscal sponsorship, the varied forms of support often take a few extra conversations to arrange\u00a0\u2014 we\u2019re keen to answer any questions you may have, and would be happy to meet or chat about specific types of support.\n\nTypes of Support\nWe have exciting performances happening every season, including many modern-day premieres always in development. Help bring these works to life by helping to fund a season.\nAs simple as a private dinner among friends, or a more formal evening of drinks and canapes, Ballo Baroque would welcome any opportunity to collaborate on a memorable event. Your guests experience an intimate concert of baroque favorites and rarely heard discoveries - all for the benefit of securing the future of Ballo Baroque performances.\nAlthough we strive to secure young and talented London-based musicians, sometimes this music requires a unique approach from outside London. To this end, we occasionally invite a guest singer or instrumentalist to join the ensemble for a project. Providing an artist home-stay means we can invite the right musician for the right concert, pay a fair fee, and offer comfortable accommodation -- all through your support. (Typically, the stays range from 4-7 nights.) If you have a spare bedroom and would enjoy hosting an artist, we're excited to chat more with you, please get in touch!\nCovering artist fees for each performance is one of the most financially challenging aspects of any ensemble's concert season. From our inaugural concert in 2013, musicians working with Ballo Baroque have generously donated their time and their skill in order to build up the ensemble -- viewed as an investment in future projects. Performing and premiering newly rediscovered music requires continued time, skill and commitment from our core ensemble as well as talent from guest musicians. Your contribution in helping to fund artist fees will guarantee consistent high-quality performances while ensuring the future growth of our ensemble.\nContact Ballo Baroque",

Many of the ensembles meet concurrently, allowing for socializing during passing times.\n\nPlease note new rehearsal times for Season 9:\n\n*\u00a0Additional choreography sectionals for VoiceOver are held\u00a06:00-7:00 (October\u00a0to\u00a0November and February to March).\n\n\nWe rehearse September through December, January through April\n\nSemester one\u00a0begins in September and goes through December, ending with our Winter Concert. Semester two\u00a0starts in January and goes through April, culminating with our Finale Concert.\n\nPlease check CALENDAR for specifics.\n\n\n\nWe rehearse at the center of the Treasure Valley: Tree City Church\n\nWe rehearse at the center of the Treasure Valley, at Tree City Church on Eagle Road between McMillan Road and Ustick Road: 3852 N. Eagle Road, Boise, ID 83713.\n\n\nAttendance Expectations\n\nSingers are allowed 3 absences (20%) each semester, not counting illnesses. These absences should be budgeted carefully to include concerts, tournament games, family travel, etc. Please budget wisely. Consistent attendance is critical to the success of the choirs. Singers are expected to be early to and attend all rehearsals. Please see the Cantus Handbook for further details.\n\n\nPersonal Practice\n\nBecause of the limited rehearsal time each week, singers in all of the Cantus Youth Choirs are expected to practice regularly outside of rehearsal. Rehearsals are dedicated to polishing music; therefore, it is crucial that singers learn their notes at home. There will be deadlines given for each singer to have their music memorized. We may provide practice recordings, but each singer will have a packet of music that they can take home to practice.\n\n\nLearn more",

Please request wheelchair accessible locations when ordering tickets if you wish to remain in your wheelchair for the performance. At the Emerson Cutler Majestic, all wheelchair accessible locations are located on the Orchestra level, as this historic venue does not have an elevator to serve upper floors.\n\n\nParamount Center \u00a0 \u00a0 Cutler Majestic\n\nTufte Performance & Production Center - Both the Semel and Greene Theaters feature General Admission seating with room in the front row for patrons to remain in their wheelchair.\n\n\nAssistive Listening Devices (ALDs) amplify and clarify sound by cutting down or eliminating ambient noise. Radio Frequency (RF) assistive listening systems are installed in all theatres and headsets may be used at any seat. Headsets with induction neck loops are available for patrons who use hearing aids and cochlear implants with a \u201cT\u201d switch.\n\nALDs are available at the Box Office in the lobby of the theatre free of charge at every performance. When you arrive at the theater, please present an identification card to a member of our Box Office in exchange for a device.\n\nAudio Description Logo\n\n\nAudio Described performances are offered for select projects during the season. Audio Description refers to an additional narration track intended primarily for blind and visually impaired consumers of visual media (including television and film, dance, opera, and visual art). It consists of a narrator talking through the presentation, describing what is happening on the screen or stage.\n\nTickets for performances with Audio Description can be purchased at the box office, over the phone, or online. Audio Description is broadcast through our listening devices (see above); you may pick one up upon arrival at the theater on the day of the show.\n\nAmerican Sign Language Logo\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language performances are offered for select projects during the season. Skilled theatrical Interpreters work with a Deaf ASL Consultant to translate the production and use American Sign Language to interpret the performances on stage. The audience can see both the Interpreters and the stage action simultaneously.\n\nWhile the interpretation should be visible from all seats in the theater, we have designated seating with closer proximity to the interpreter marked as \"ASL Seating\" on the seating map. Please choose this seating when booking your tickets for an optimal view of the ASL interpreter.\n\nFor performances with General Admission seating, you will choose your seating location when you arrive at the theater so there is no designated seating at the time of the booking.\n\nOption Caption Logo\n\n\nOpen caption (OC) services are provided at select performances for patrons with slight to profound hearing loss. During open captioned performances an electronic text display is positioned to the side of the stage, which shows what the actors are saying or singing and describes sound effects on stage. Patrons are placed in select seats near the open caption board to ensure they can see both the stage and the caption board during the performance.\n\nTactile Tour Logo\n\n\nPresented prior to certain audio described performances, tactile tours feature an in-depth discussion of a play\u2019s visual elements with a member of each show\u2019s creative team,\u00a0a guided tour of the set and key prop and costume pieces,\u00a0and an opportunity to meet the cast for an introduction to their characters and physical descriptions.\n\nService Animals Welcome\n\n\nAnimals that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities are welcome at all performances. If possible, please let us know at the time of booking so that we may ensure both you and your animal are seated comfortably.\n\n\nVehicles displaying a valid ADA placard can find accessible parking spaces directly around the corner from the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theatre on Stuart Street in front of Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery. The LAZ Garage, ArtsEmerson's preferred parking partner, is also designed to accommodate accessibility needs. ArtsEmerson patrons receive a discounted flat rate of $12 for up to 12 hours of parking.",
