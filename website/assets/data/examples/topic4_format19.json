A Curriculum Guide.\nSmith, Hazel A.; And Others\nThis guide is designed to serve as a point of departure for classroom teachers and music teacher specialists as they plan for the musical growth of 5th and 6th graders. The guide is also intended to be a source for materials. Topics covered in the document include harmony; songs for special days and season; rhythmic movement; listening to music; playing instruments; reading music; and developing concepts for melody, rhythm, harmony, form, and expressive quality. It is not suggested that the activities or all suggestions for any one resource be completed in one day. The songs and recordings listed can be used throughout the year, emphasizing one facet of the musical content at one time and dealing with other facets at other times. The materials and suggestions do not have grade level labels because good practice and good musical selections are not restricted to specific grade levels. Suggested resources have been developed for each activity so that the teacher may choose material which best suits his class situation.

[More about...]\n\nSkip to content\n\nWarning Message\u00a0You have selected a data element that has limitations when comparing across states and years. Please select the link to learn more.\u00a0[More about...]\n\nState assessments, which are used to measure student achievement in reading, math, and science, are designed by each state to measure the content the state has determined appropriate for that grade and subject. As a result, both the content on the tests and achievement standards students must meet to be considered \u201cproficient\u201d vary widely across states, so proficiency rates should not be compared across states. Many states have also changed their standards and assessments at some point in the process of measuring their students, so it is often not possible to create a trend line that looks at changes in achievement across years, since a change could actually reflect a change in the assessment.\n\nThrough the 2009-10 school year, states were allowed to calculate student graduation rates differently, as long as the figure represents students who graduated in the standard number of years (i.e., four). Starting in the 2010-11, states converted to an adjusted cohort graduation rate, which may or may not be the same as the calculation they used in prior years. Due to the potential differences, caution should be used when comparing graduation rates across states.\n\nFor detailed information about state assessments and graduation rates, please see the state Accountability Workbooks, which can be found at: State Accountability Workbooks:\n\nThe user can use the Graphs and Tables tool to explore basic state data values for the selected Data Element.

Note that Title I, Part D, programs and facilities have the flexibility to select the pre- and post-test assessments that are best suited to their populations. Assessments are therefore not the same across the nation, and likely not the same between districts and States. Due to this variation, comparisons of State reading and math data may not be appropriate. A neglected program serves neglected children and youth and is a public or private residential facility, other than a foster home, that is operated primarily for the care of children who have been committed to the institution or voluntarily placed under applicable State law due to abandonment, neglect, or death of their parents or guardians. A dash (-) indicates that the data are missing or not available. The symbol \"n<\" indicates that the data has been suppressed due to a small count. A \"\u2020\" symbol means not applicable.;\u00a0Source: EDFacts\/Consolidated State Performance Report, 2012-13:;\u00a0Data Uploaded On:\u00a010\/10\/2014\u00a0\n\nTN: Due to the transient and high-turnover population of Neglected and Delinquent students, sometimes students will take a pre-test but not post-test because they've left the agency\/program quickly and perhaps unexpectedly or because the agency\/program did not administer a post-test for whatever reason. Thus, only a score for pre-tests might be listed for some students.",

        "text":"This text is drawn from\n\nA NEET or neet is a young person who is \u201cNot in Education, Employment, or Training\u201d. The acronym NEET was first used in the United Kingdom but its use has spread to other countries including Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the classification comprises people aged between 16 and 24 (some 16-year-olds are still of compulsory school age); the subgroup of NEETs aged 16\u201318 is frequently of particular focus. In Japan, the classification comprises people aged between 15 and 34 who are unemployed, not engaged in housework, not enrolled in school or work-related training, and not seeking work.\n\nNEET is to be distinguished from the newly coined NLEET rate used in the 2013 report on Global Employment Trends for Youth by the International Labor Organization. The NLEET rate stands for \u201cneither in the labor force nor in education, employment or training\u201d. It is similar to NEET but excludes the unemployed since they are still included in the labor force.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
