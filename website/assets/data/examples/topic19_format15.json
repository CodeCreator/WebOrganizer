Well, there's a non-sports, performance injury that I like to call hockey elbow.

        "text":"Wolverine Events in\u00a0Colorado\n\nFor Boulder and Denver-area wolverine enthusiasts, two events next week offer the chance to meet Doug Chadwick, author of The Wolverine Way.\n\nIn Boulder, Chadwick will speak on Monday, December 6th, at 6 p.m. at the Integral Center on 2805 Broadway Ave. In Denver, he\u2019ll speak on Tuesday, December 7th, at 6 p.m, at the Mercury Cafe, 2199 California St. Copies of the book will be available, and the author will answer questions and sign books after the presentation.\n\nA short video about the book features some great shots of majestic Glacier country, not to mention fantastic footage of wolverines being goofy and playful. Doug is a very entertaining speaker, and the book is excellent, so if you happen to be in the Denver area, be sure to attend.\u00a0 If not, stay tuned for more information about wolverine events across the West this winter and spring, including opportunities to learn more about tracking and reporting track sightings, as well as a chance to participate in tracking field trips, with Jason Wilmot of NRCC and the Absaroka-Beartooth Project.\n\nTo whet your appetite for wolverine information, check out Conservation Media\u2019s new short film on the Wolverine Foundation\u2019s work, featuring an interview with Jeff Copeland \u2013\u00a0 a nice three-minute synopsis of what TWF does, and why wolverines are amazing. It\u2019s great to see more multi-media information out there.\n\nAnd speaking of tracks, here\u2019s a post from Conservation Media from back in April, 2010, documenting a sighting of wolverine tracks crossing a highway in Montana. Note the inclusion of the author\u2019s hand for scale, and the multiple photos of individual tracks as well as the gait \u2013 including some great shots of the distinctive three-by gait. This is excellent documentation. I thought I\u2019d bring it to the attention of any citizen scientists out there, as an example of how to photograph wolverine tracks in a way that can be considered verified.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"Phase AF CCD Die\u00a0Shot\n\nBack in 2014 we were investigating the AF\/Lens system at NikonHacker. To understand the operation of phase AF, some efforts were put into the AF sensor itself. There were leaked D1X schematics indicating 3 linear CCDs made by Sony (ILX105 and ILX107) are incorporated into the MultiCAM-1300. In the old days, a single chip could not handle that many segments of linear pixels on a single die, so that the light path had to be split and focused onto multiple chips. The same is done on MultiCAM-2000 which uses 3 chips as well.\n\nThen from the D200 until D90, a single chip ILX148 is used to handle all 11 focus points in the new CAM-1000 AF system. Some teardown serves as great resources even showing a die photo of that sensor. Missing in between was the D70\u2019s CAM-900. Later I came across a cheap working sensor stripped from a broken D70 and decided to take a look.\n\n\n\nThe entire module came in with dust, clearly from a broken camera fall onto the ground. I tore the 2 duct tap covering the slit between the chip and plastic optical assembly. The opening is a metal mask outlying the light transmission boundaries of 5 focus points.\n\nThen I use a knife to peer off the glue on the sides, exposing the reddish epoxy adhesion between the chip carrier and the optical module. A gentle pull separated them apart.\n\nThe Sensor\n\nSensor Die\n\nNow the AF CCD is exposed! You could see a total of 12 linear CCD segments forming 6 pairs.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the back side of the optical assembly to understand why.\n\n\nIt appears each focus point has a pair of microlenses. The center cross-type use 2 linear segments in perpendicular, thus 4 lenslets. That gives you total of 6 pairs.\n\nTo illustrate how this works, I cover the focus plane with a scratching paper and point its front toward a light bulb. And here\u2019s the image.\n\n\nThe pattern matches the layout of linear CCD.\n\nNow we could mimic a high contrast target by covering 2 focus points in half with a sticker.\n\nYou could see the 2 lenslets forms a copy of 2 high-contrast edges in the 2 segments.\n\nWhen this is relayed from a photographic lens, the distance between the 2 high-contrast edges will vary depending on the defocus value. The firmware A then uses some sort of cross-correlation algorithm to determine that distance. The distance is then compared against the calibrated value to get the actual defocus amount used to drive the lens AF motor.\n\nSo far that\u2019s for the working principle for the phase AF optics. There\u2019s a lot need to dig into the ASM codes of firmware A, and the electronic interface between the AF CCD and the MCU running the codes. Here I decided to desolder the CCD from the flex board. The CCD is packaged inside a CLCC and the contacts form a L-shape covering both side and bottom. It turned out the heat from soldering iron disassociates the wires from flexible board before melting the solder on the bottom. All the contact pads on the flexible board are destroyed.\n\nThe backside of the CLCC package has following marking.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a Sony ILX127AA linear CCD.\u00a0 405 R9KK is the product batch code. \u201c405\u201d indicates it\u2019s made in the 5th week of 2004, around the time of D70 and D70s.\n\nThe schematics can be obtained from wiring trace. In the diagram below, VREF is probably 3.3V based on the trace. SD0~3 and STB formed a simple parallel command interface. CLK is the master clock input. The analog output of pixel intensity is on Vout synchronized to SYNC.\n\n\nNow we could dig into the image sensor die using a microscope. I took more than 50 shot and stitched using a panoramic software. The CCD was manufactured using a very old process node, probably larger than 1 micron.\n\n\nClick for Large View\n\nThe charge transfer is based on 2-phase CCD. The total number of pixels is around 996. Considering the metal masked pixels, this number reduces to 912. Thus MultiCam-900 make sense. The greenish regions are the actual photodiodes. The photon generated charge is then transferred to the shaded region on the left or to the top. The charge is then clocked and shifted out to the output amplifier. The three long segments are continuous with dummy pixels in between two correlated pixel regions. The six shorter ones form the left, center and right focus points are broken into two due to the long segments. Thus each shorter one has its own amplifier. The CCD integrates all the input command decoder\/segment select\/CCD driver logic on chip, as indicated by the vertical grid of synthesized transistors and their metal interconnect wires.\n\n\nMicroscopic survey of recent image\u00a0sensors\n\nLast year through cooperation with ChipMod studio, we obtained multiple die shot images of recent Sony sensors. And in this post we\u2019re going to show some of them. Most of our device identification is based on teardown from various reliable source, such as Chipworks and manufacture repair manual. Or from direct microscopic imaging. For inference, it has to be relied on die signature such as number of bond pad and their relative location, or referred as \u201cbond pad signature\u201d.\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin. The first one, IMX038AQE from Pentax K-x\/K-r. It\u2019s the same silicon die as the AQQ variant seen in Nikon D90 and D5000 DSLR.\n\nSONY and device marking code IMX038\n\nLayer number during photolithography of Bayer pattern and on chip lens (OCL)\n\nFactory die level testing left probe scratch on the test pad\n\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at the IMX071AQQ from D5100.\n\nNo device marking was found on the die except \u201cSONY\u201d\n\nBayer layer mark. PAC appears to be Photo Activated Chemical based on patents\n\nFactory test pads\n\nFinally we have the IMX094AQP from D800\/D800E. The first image shows the alignment mark near the die boundary. It\u2019s interesting that Nikon customized the cover glass to be a quartz anti-moir\u00e9 layer. As advertised by Nikon, both D800 and E variant included the vertical separation glass. The glass appeared to be specially AR coated only in the image area, not on the whole plate level. We had never seen this on other Sony sensor, not even on IMX128.\n\nAlignment marks shows duplicated image in vertical direction\n\nEdge of the multilayer AR coating shows uneven gradient\n\nSimilar to 071, Sony did not imprint the device marking in the corner. However, I found a pair of mask number related to this device. MM094L and MM094R on the long edge of the silicon die. This pairs of mark appears on Sony full frame sensors only. We later found the pair on IMX235 and IMX128 as well. Based on their location, I realized that it could be a mask code for a stitching pair. A full frame sensor was just too big to fit in the circle of stepper imaging field of view. Thus to make a full sensor, a pair of mask has to be used just like taking your panorama. This was the case for IMX028 when I discovered the non-uniformity on its flat field image.\n\nThe microscope I had access to has a 40x objective. However its working distance is too short to prevent direct imaging through the sensor cover glass. With the permission and request by ChipMod studio, I\u2019ll show some more enlarged image onto the pixels themselves.\n\nOne interesting sensor was the X-pro1 CMOS harboring a Sony marking code. Again no actual device code.\n\nXpro-1 IMX165\n\nXpro-1 IMX165\n\nThe corner of Fujifilm X-trans array\n\nThrough the central opening on the back of PCB, the package marking register X165A?. The second character is presumably a R or P or F.\u00a0 It\u2019s possibly IMX165AFE based on IC searching where many distributer had an entry on their listing. Sony usually used the second letter to denote Bayer type, with Q for RGB Bayer and L for mono. F would naturally mean a different pattern like X-trans. The die itself, appears to be the same as the 16MP IMX095 found in Sony NEX F3 and Pentax K-01.\n\nFujifilm CMOS PCB\n\n\nPentax K-01 uses CLCC version IMX095AQE\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Sony fixed the underlying circuit, only altering the last few steps in their back end of line (BEOL) to pattern a different color filter array. This would significantly reduces cost by avoiding making a new sensor. So the question is, when will we see a native monochromatic CMOS in APS-C or larger format?\n\nNext we will have a big one, the IMX235AQR in the Sony A7S, which harbors a 12MP full frame at around 8.5um pixel pitch. ChipMod obtained the following image during mono chip mode. In essence, scraping away the microlens and Bayer layer. The pixel opening is super wide given 55% area fill factor on the metal three layer.\n\n50x objective view of the Metal 3 layer after Bayer removal\n\n\nThe microlens array appears to shift towards top left of pixel boundary\n\nWe also surveyed the IMX183 BSI sensor. Surprisingly, BSI sensor also has a grid on the light sensitive side. After some literature search, the presence of this grid could reduce color crosstalk between adjacent pixels. This is because on BSI sensor light can easily pass to the collecting well in the next pixel when fill factor gets larger and incident angle gets smaller. It is also the reason to employ microlens array to focus light rays on to the pixel center.\n\n\nIMX183 BSI pixel boundary grid\n\nAt the end, we take a look at the old school interline CCDs. ICX413 in Pentax K-100.\n\nAnd ICX493 using rotated horizontal-vertical transfer registers.\n\n\nICX493 employed four phase CCD, with two pixels covering a period. Thus readout is interlined. Charge on odd and even columns are transferred upward then right or downward and left to their respective HCCD (organized vertically) on each side for read out. Then the same is repeated for interline rows.\n\nNo AA filter? More of a marketing\u00a0hype\n\nBack in 2012 when D800 was released, Nikon did a bit tweaking on its antialiasing filter which led to the higher resolution D800E. A pair of birefringent crystal is organized in the parallel 180 degree to cancel out the effect. But were they worth it? As we had disassembled more camera, I decided to write a post on how these filter stack is organized.\n\nChipMod sent me a pair of filters on the Nikon D600. The IMX128... (truncated)",

Some rights reserved.\n\nDecember 21st marked a day of great regulatory importance as both the SEC and EPA released final versions of rules that have been in the works for years.\n\nThe SEC published Final Rule 33-9286, \u201cMine Safety Disclosure,\u201d \u2013 which implements Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act \u2013 a grandiose 364 days after the proposed version hit the Federal Register. The new rule will dictate how mining companies must disclose information about mine safety and health in certain SEC filings. Now that the rule has finalized (it becomes effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Regsiter), we hope to see examples of this disclosure from more companies than just Monarch Cement Co.\n\nEven earlier in the day came the news that the EPA had revealed its new, finalized rule setting national standards to limit mercury, acid gases and other toxic pollution from power plants. Grist called the rules a \u201cBig Deal,\u201d waxing poetic about how the rules \u201cwill make America a more decent, just, and humane place to live.\u201d Grist wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so \u2013 we thought they were landmark, too. To read more about the standards, check out the EPA\u2019s \u201cMATS\u201d page.\n\nSo go ahead and mark December 21st down in your calendar. It may just go down in history.\n\nThe Cross-State Air Pollution Rule: Keep Your Dirty Air to\u00a0Yourself\n\nPhoto by jepoirrier. Some rights reserved.\n\nThough the implementation deadline for the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (\u201cCSAPR\u201d) is just a few short weeks away, many folks\u2019 defiant response has been: Keep your Cross-State Air Pollution Rule to yourself.\n\nThe final rule, published by the EPA in the Federal Register on August 8th of this year, endeavors to reduce air pollution by limiting power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) that cross state lines. By 2014, this rule is estimated to prevent a whopping 13,000 to 34,000 premature deaths annually.\n\nHowever, not everyone is as excited as the EPA about the reduction in premature deaths.\n\nTwo bills currently working their way through Congress include sections or amendments aiming to hobble the act. An amendment in the Transparency in Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation Act of 2011 (H.R. 2401) would delay action on CSAPR until an interagency panel has an opportunity to investigate the economic impact of various air emissions rules. H.R. 2891, America\u2019s Energy Independence Act, proposes to delay the initial compliance deadline of CSAPR for ten years.\n\nAnd Congress members aren\u2019t the only ones squawking. At least eight states, and several private companies, have consolidated seven separate cases against the EPA into a singular challenge to the rule. Jenner & Block has more on the super-case, EME Homer City Generation, L.P. v. EPA No. 11-1302 (D.C. Cir. filed Aug. 23, 2011).\n\nBecause the displeasure has been so loud, many owners or operators of the subject power plans \u2013 high on the idea that the rule might not survive pending legislative and legal challenges \u2013 are unlikely to \u201cinstall expensive pollution control technologies or to engage fully in CSAPR\u2019s emission allowance markets,\u201d despite the pending compliance date, according to a recent Client Publication from Shearman & Sterling.\n\nStill, it hasn\u2019t stopped companies from fretting: There have been at least 250 appearances of the terms CSAPR or Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in SEC filings since the rule was finalized, many in the vein of: \u201cIf finalized, the rule\u2019s new requirements to control mercury emissions could result in implementation of additional technologies at power plants that could negatively affect fly ash quality,\u201d or \u201cThe Cross-State Air Pollution Rules, if commenced on January 1, 2012, could adversely affect cost of operations at our Roanoke Valley Energy Facility.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about the CSAPR here.\n\nEPA Issues Landmark Mercury Pollution Standards for Power\u00a0Plants\n\nPhoto by Flickr user Kansas Poetry (Patrick). Some rights reserved.\n\nOn March 16th, facing down a final court deadline, the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled the proposed rule for the first-ever national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants from coal-and-oil-fueled power plants, and the first significant legislation of its kind since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990. These standards were developed based on the practices and results from the best functioning national plants, and would primarily regulate toxic gases such as\u00a0mercury, arsenic, chromium, and nickel, as well as requiring mandatory safety upgrades and employment of effective pollution control devices for most U.S. plants. These changes have been in the works since December 2000, when the EPA first re-examined the standards proposed in the original Clean Air Act.\n\nIn a fact sheet published alongside the rule itself, the EPA offers a number of encouraging statistics that will result from the new standards. The new technologies employed would prevent 91% of mercury and acid gases and 55% of sulfur dioxide burned in power plants from escaping into the air. By 2016, according to the EPA, the legislation will prevent as many as 17,000 premature deaths and 11,000 heart attacks annually, with 120,000 fewer cases of aggravated asthma and 12,000 fewer emergency room visits. And while the rule is estimated to cost $10.9 billion annually, it will theoretically also save workers and affected persons between $59 and $140 billion in health costs, and could create as many as 31,000 short-term construction jobs implementing the new technology and 9,000 long-term utility-based jobs.\n\nAs the EPA has recently come under scrutiny from Republican lawmakers for enforcing new climate rules that the GOP argues could cripple the already troublesome federal budget, these new emission standards may be looked upon with some skepticism. However, the EPA, in their press release for the rule, assures skeptics that the new standards align strictly with an executive order signed into action by President Obama in January that requires new regulation by federal agencies to be as cost effective as possible.\n\nEPA Boils Down Final Rules to Bare Essentials, Conservative Groups Still Emitting\u00a0Concerns\n\nIn April 2010, after three years of delayed litigation, the EPA released its proposed Boiler MACT (Maximum Achievable Control Technology) rules that would govern emission standards for commercial, institutional and industrial boilers, solid-waste incinerators, and furnaces.\n\nThe rules, long-awaited by environmental groups and clean-air industries alike, aimed to make significant cuts to emissions of hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAP\u201ds) like mercury, dioxin, soot, hydrogen chloride, and carbon monoxide.\n\nPhoto by Andy Dingley. Some rights reserved.\n\nThe proposed rules received over 4,800 comments over the 45 days they were open in the Federal Register, and with pressure from both sides of the issue, the EPA requested an extension to finish drafting the final rules in January 2011. District Judge Paul Friedman denied the agency its requested 15 month extension and gave a 30 day window for the agency to comply, and the final rules were submitted on February 23, 2011.\n\nThe EPA estimates that the final rules cut the cost of compliance by a significant 50%, with the figure associated with implementing the rule estimated at $1.8 billion, as opposed to the $3.6 billion figure associated with the proposed rules.\n\nThe most significant difference between the proposed and final rules was that biomass boilers were changed to be included with coal boilers in one single solid-fuel category, which eased considerably the standards for biomass boilers emitting less than 25 tons of combined toxins annually.\n\nResponse to the final rules has been divided by party and agency lines, with House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) claiming that they were issued hastily and under pressure of court-ordered deadline. The Council of Industrial Boiler Owners has stated that the rules are too costly, and that adhering to their standards could cause many facilities to shut down, estimating a potential 300,000 jobs lost as a cost.\n\nThe EPA, on the other hand, is optimistic about its rules and estimates it could create as many as 2,200 new jobs. Likeminded environmentalist organization the NRDC estimates that the new emission standards could save 6,500 lives and prevent 46,000 cases of asthma and bronchitis annually. As the back and forth continues, the EPA has encouraged companies and agencies to offer their feedback on the rules, as their opponents, such as Upton, prepare to combat them.\n\nYou can find a copy of the final rules, along with related international news and agency materials in this knowledgemosaic Spotlight, published on our Keep Current news page.\n\nDanger in the Air in Afghanistan and Iraq (and it\u2019s not what you\u00a0think)\n\nPhoto by Greg Henshall. Some rights reserved.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, the GAO released a report scolding the Department of Defense (DOD) on their enforcement of burn pit operations procedures and solid waste management. The GAO initially was asked to report on \u201c(1) extent of open pit burning in Afghanistan and Iraq, and whether the military has followed its guidance; (2) alternatives to burn pits, and whether the military has examined them; and (3) extent of efforts to monitor air quality and potential health impacts.\u201d Their conclusion? DOD needs to improve \u201cadherence\u201d to guidance on burn pit operations and waste management, as well as consider alternatives to current procedures.\n\nAccording to the DOD, soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq each generate about 10 pounds of solid waste per day. The efficiency of the process means that most of this waste is burned in open pits, despite the abundant smoke and other emissions associated with the practice. DOD and the U.S.... (truncated)",

        "text":"Trumpeter Swans: Montana\u2019s Phoenix\n\n\nA few weeks ago I stopped by a pond near the Jefferson River and took some pictures of trumpeter swans. It was an incredible experience, watching those massive birds lift from the water, beating the air with magnificent wings. When I got into the office the next Monday, I started researching trumpeter swans. For me, the most difficult part of any blog post is the pictures, and, having the pictures, I figured I ought to write a post. I soon discovered that the pictures are not nearly as good as I thought, which happens every time a camera finds its way into my hands. I also discovered that while I had accumulated an encyclopedia entry\u2019s worth of information, I had no narrative to use to frame a blog post, also a far too frequent occurrence.\n\nTrumpeter Swan, wings spread, standing tall.\n\nA desperate email to Tempest\u2019s videographer fixed one of those problems. Mike was in Wyoming, taking some truly spectacular video of Teton National Park, and had some great stills of trumpeter swans. The narrative framework problem? Well I still haven\u2019t quite addressed that, because every time I try I just start thinking of E.B. White\u2019s The Trumpet of the Swan, and I get distracted.\n\nAfter my most recent spate of research, trumpeter swans may have entered the list of my top five favorite birds. Over 5 feet tall, between 20 and 30 pounds and with wingspans sometimes exceeding 7 feet, trumpeters are massive\u2014among the heaviest flying birds in the world, and the largest species of waterfowl. All this and they survive almost entirely on the squiggly green plants in ponds. You know the stuff, the plants that brush against your legs in lakes and rivers and freak you out because you think they might be some sort of water monster. Pondweed and waterweed. Damp salad, essentially. That\u2019s what trumpeters eat. You probably already know that trumpeters usually mate for life, can live up to 20+ plus years, are excellent jazz musicians, and communicate by writing on a slate hung around their necks. (Ok, so E.B. White got some of his facts wrong, but what do you expect from someone who tried to make a sympathetic hero out of a spider?)\n\n\nTrumpeters once ranged across the Rocky Mountain west, but were thought to be extinct in the lower 48 by the early 1900s. However, a flock of some 30 birds was discovered in Montana\u2019s remote Centennial Valley (on the Montana-Idaho border) in the 1930s. Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge at the foot of the Centennial Mountains was established soon after to protect these incredible birds. Today, 70 pairs reside in the western U.S. year-round; 56 pairs live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, while other flocks live as far afield as Northern California and Southern Oregon. An additional 5,700 birds winter in the Greater Yellowstone area. In addition to Red Rock Lakes, you see swans in Montana in the Madison River complex, the Jefferson River complex, Yellowstone, the Bitterroot River area, and (seasonally) around the Seeley-Swan Valley.\n\nIn my research, I discovered these two episodes from Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom about Red Rocks Lake NWR (Part I and Part II). This are fantastic, not just because they are informative, but for the awesome 1970s music and cinematography.\n\nOh, and one more picture to round off the post: in addition to being beautiful, graceful, and magnificent, trumpeters can also apparently be territorial bullies:\n\n\n\n, , ,\n\nNo comments yet.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"Wednesday, 10 October 2012\n\nA Request for sightings\n\nWent over last night, apart from a Wigeon and a lot of gulls there was little of note. However, I have started to tot-up this years sightings and there are some gaps. We are nearly 30 species down on last year.\n\nAlthough not scientific, it is fair to assume that this years breeding has been rather a wash-out as there have been few warblers around this autumn. Generally bird numbers seem well down not just at the Reservoir. Waders have been a complete disaster, the high water level and overgrown condition of the shoreline being the main factors, coupled with disturbance and general lack of waders generally has seen the lowest number ever recorded at this site.\n\nI am in particular looking for records to fill in the gaps, obviously anything rare that I haven\u2019t heard about with the only good birds I am aware of being Scand Rock Pipit, Black-necked Grebe, Smew, Common Scoter and Med Gull.\n\nBut I am looking in for records for this year of the following: Hobby, any waders apart from Oystercatcher, Redshank, Lapwing and Common Sandpiper. Garden, Sedge or Reed Warbler. Spotted Flycatcher, Tree Sparrow and Yellowhammer.\n\nHopefully, someone has had a better year than me.\n\nNo comments:",

Geoff Sherrington has pieced together a sequence of climategate emails, his own emails, and parts of Warwick Hughes work to recreate the sequence.\n\nAnd for the true skeptic-aficionados, here\u2019s a new layer of history to the skeptical chronology. Where did this volunteer audit movement begin?\n\nWho would have guessed that at least one skeptic, Hughes, was asking for the data Phil Jones worked with, as long ago as 1991? (That was way back in the days where people worked with hard copy print outs, and drew graphs by hand!) Does Hughes rank as volunteer Skeptic Number 1?\n\nUPDATE: I asked Warwick, and he thinks the first unpaid skeptic was Fred Wood in 1988*. \u2014 Jo\n\nGuest post by: Geoffrey H Sherrington, Scientist.\n\nThis is the longer story behind one of the more anti-science quotes in the short history of people attempting to be \u2018climate scientists\u2019, definition unclear. The pivotal short quote is in the opening email.\n\nOriginal artwork: McCutcheon 1903. Adapted: Jo Nova.\n\n\u201cWhy should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it.\u201d\n\nHere is a series of emails and articles with my interspersed comments in italics. Each email number is the one assigned in Climategate\u00a0One and Two, presumably by the donor named FOIA. The Climategate emails are indented below, so the source can be picked up easily. There are sections cut from other emails as well. They are not indented. We start with the famous email, the one that some say was the start of the difficulty that scientists in general found when they tried to access data from some climate scientists.\n\n\nFrom Phil Jones to Warwick Hughes.\n\n1299. Between July 2004 and Feb 2005. (Exact date not on my copy of the email.)\n\nI should warn you that some data we have we are not supposed top (sic) pass on to others. We can pass on the gridded data \u2013 which we do. Even if WMO agrees, I will still not pass on the data. We have 25 or so years invested in the work. Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and\u00a0find something wrong with it. There is IPR\u00a0to consider. You can get similar data from GHCN at NCDC. Australia isn\u2019t restricted there.\n\n\nWMO = World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIPR = Intellectual Property Rights.\n\nGHCN = Global Historical Climatology Network.\n\nNCAR = USA National Centre for Atmospheric Research.\n\nWWR = World Weather Records of the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nMCDR = WMO\u2019s Monthly Climatic Data for the World.\n\nPhil had had some prior thoughts about this.\n\n0688. 16 July 2004.\n\nThe reason for emailing though is that I\u2019m also being hassled\u00a0by Warwick Hughes for the CRU\u00a0station dataset. We put up the gridded fields, but not the station data. Over the last year or so, I\u2019ve told people they can\u2019t have the station data \u2013 go to the GHCN site and get it. I knew that avenue has been closed, but it got some of them off my back. I\u2019m not that inclined to release it to Hughes (who Mike knows and maybe Tom). All he wants to do is to show how I\u2019ve made some mistake or used some incorrect data for some stations.\nThere are a number of issues, though:\n\n1. Should Res. 40 stop GHCN data being released?\n2. Should I be hiding behind it too?\n3. When does IPR\u00a0kick in with the work I\u2019ve put in on the CRU data?\n4. Should people like this be able to request this kind of data?\n5. NCAR\u00a0release a precursor to GHCN\u00a0\u2013 just WWR\/MCDW+lots of other data, but in an unfriendly format.\n\nFrom Phil Jones to Tom Peterson.\n\nThomas Peterson was near the top of NOAA, USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Seehttp:\/\/www.noaaworld.noaa.gov\/scitech\/sep2008_scitech_4.html\n\nJones seems to be unsure of the efficacy or legality of ways to avoid a direct answer to Warwick Hughes. Jones appears to know that he is deliberately telling people to go to a place where they will not find the answers they seek. Note the term \u201cunfriendly format\u201d.\n\nWhy was Warwick Hughes seeking certain data in 1990?\n\nIn Warwick\u2019s words:\n\nWarwick Hughes\n\n\u201cI started reviewing Prof Jones work in 1991 and I have a timeline of my work and published papers in those early years \u2013 many links. People have asked me how I got started looking into temperature data.\u201d\n\n\u201cI first got curious about GW through media reports up to 1990 and wanted to check Australian data for myself \u2013 at that point I had never used a PC. I went into the BoM in Lonsdale Street and paid for hard copy printouts of stations from here and there \u2013 no idea how I selected sites \u2013 just places I knew and maybe the counter staff suggested stations. I drew a series of charts on graph paper and seeing a variety of disparate trends \u2013 being unable to find GW \u2013 showed them to some ex mining industry contacts. One guy gave me an intro to people at the Tasman Institute in the Melb CBD and about April 1991 I breezed in there with these hand drawn charts and showed a staffer \u2013 who said; \u201c..you will have to get all this material onto disk \u2013 you can come in here and learn to use a PC.\u201d\nThey gave me a little cubbie of a desk and a 286 PC with Win3.1 and I began pestering staff as to how to get some work out of this box thing. Anyway \u2013 the worst phase probably only took a few weeks and I could get some work out of Excel \u2013 my early data was entered to disk from my sheaf of hard copies printouts. Sometime in winter 91 I made contacts in the BoM and somebody gave me a copy of the US DoE TR027 report \u2013 which details \u2013 station by station \u2013 Jones et al Southern Hemisphere compilation of GW.\nThe Australian component of their Appendix A \u2013 was my basic source to track down Australian long term stations \u2013 I built on from there \u2013 for example work done building the data for the Balling, Idso & Hughes 1992 paper \u2013 that caused the BoM so much heartburn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis work lead on to my construction of the two contrasting temperature histories from circa 1882, Graph 1 for 25 regional and remote Australian stations and Graph 2 for the six Australian capital cities.\u201d\n\nCity Reviews\u00a0takes you to many instances of urban heat island UHI\u00a0contamination of city temperature data still used by Jones\/UKMO\/IPCC.\u201d\n\nAbout a half dozen\u00a0people or more, like me, from larger companies, would meet monthly to distribute funds to Tasman and to review work in progress. Warwick made a presentation in 1991-2. He was more prescient than I was. I left the climate scene early in 1993 and did not reconnect until about 2005. The work presented to Tasman Institute contained several graphs. These two persist, see http:\/\/www.warwickhughes.com\/1991\/targw.htmfor a longer discussion.\n\nTop graph:\u00a0Geraldton, Narrabri, Hay, Albany, Rottnest\u00a0Island Lighthouse, Walgett, Deniliquin, Bourke, Cape Naturaliste\u00a0Lighthouse, Coonabarabran, Echuca, Cooma, Darwin, Moruya\u00a0Heads Pilot Station, Omeo, Dubbo, Alice Springs, Gabo Island Lighthouse, Bathurst, Strathalbyn, Mt. Gambier, Yamba, Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse, Newcastle Signal Station, Cape Otway Lighthouse.\n\nLower graph: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart\n\nIt was Warwick\u2019s contention that the search for UHI\u00a0had been less that thorough as to choice of Australian stations. Here he shows that the temperature change in the average of several large Australian cities was positive, whereas that of a selection of rural sites was negative to level. (Temperature is in Celsius, Tmean\u00a0annual compiled from half of the sum of Tmax\u00a0and Tmin\u00a0daily). Somehow, Phil Jones had concluded from figures similar to these that UHI was negligible in Australia, a finding that is still being quoted in 2011.\n\nIn 2004-\u00a0early 2005, Warwick wrote a number of emails to CRU\u00a0and WMO, which do not appear in Climategate records, but which are on file here. Some of them detail efforts by Phil Jones to stop bodies like the WMO from cooperating with Warwick. Much of his interest was in the raw data behind two papers from University of East Anglia, being \u2013\n\nJones, P. D., S. C. B. Raper, T. M. L. Wigley, 1986: Southern Hemisphere Surface Air Temperature Variations: 1851\u20131984. J. Climate Appl. Meteor., 25, 1213\u20131230.\n\nThis first main paper involved an assembly of data for the USA DOE (Department of Energy) for CDIAC. (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge national Laboratories, Tennessee, USA.)\n\n\nThe second main paper:\n\nJones, P.D., P.Ya. Groisman, M. Coughlan, N. Plummer, W.-C. Wang and T.R. Karl, 1990: Assessment of urbanization effects in time series of surface air temperature over land. Nature 347, 169-172\n\nThis second paper dealt with data from China, Russia and Eastern Australia and it was one of the key papers promoting a stampede of thought under the Global Warming banner. It is an important paper, but it is wrong.\n\nWarwick subsequently had the following papers published and a few more rejected, perhaps because they questioned the orthodoxy.\n\n1992 Robert C.

        "text":"Pegasus \u2013 the winged\u00a0horse\n\nJanuary 1, 2017\n\n\ntattoo_win2One of the bigger autumn constellations is in the Perseus group, Pegasus. It\u2019s just the front half of a horse, and the wings of course. These figures in the sky are not always the whole figure, sometimes it\u2019s half. It\u2019s good that they chose to use the front half of the horse because if they used the back half it might be confused with presidential politics.\n\nThere are various accounts on how Pegasus was born. One of the more common tales is that when Perseus chopped off the head of Medusa, two winged horses came flying from her neck, Pegasus, and Chrysaor. So you see, technically it\u2019s not that a winged horse is a pegasus, It\u2019s that there was a winged horse named Pegasus. He was white and his brother Chrysaor was black. They are considered rather beautiful but so was their mother before her hair turned to snakes and she killed all her boyfriends. Their father of record was Poseidon, the god of oceans and horses because screw logic.\n\nSome say Pegasus\u2019 brother Chrysaor was a warrior guy instead of a winged horse. Some actually say he was a giant winged pig. People say a lot of things. I wouldn\u2019t put too much stock in any of it.\nPegasus knew some neat tricks. Like he could stomp the ground and a spring of fresh water would form there. Anyone who drank the water would be good at writing poetry. Pretty handy stuff.\n\ncreepy_horseOne account of the story of Pegasus has him being rather wild at first until he was finally tamed by Bellerophone. One day Bellerophone tried to reach Mount Olympus, home of the gods, by riding on Pegasus\u2019 back. To stop him, Zeus sent a horsefly to sting Pegasus. The horse bucked and threw Bellerophone off. Pegasus then continued on alone to Olympus because why not?\n\nZeus sent Pegasus back down to find Perseus and help speed him along his journey. Half of the gods were always trying to slow Perseus down and the other half were trying to help him out because let\u2019s face it, human politics is really what having gods is all about. It\u2019s no different now.\n\nTo find the constellation, just look for the great square of Pegasus, which astronomers call The Great Square of Pegasus. One of the stars of the square, named Alpheratz (belly button), or sometimes Sirrah (mare), is the fourth brightest star in Pegasus and also the first brightest star in Andromeda. It lives on the border and has dual citizenship. It has two names because together they mean \u201cbelly button of the mare.\u201d It\u2019s just as well they dropped the mare part because Pegasus is a stallion. Come to think of it, he might not even have had a belly button since he spewed forth from a severed neck.\nM15M15 is a globular cluster in Pegasus and it has all the glory one expects from a globular. To find it, think of the great square as a baseball diamond. If Alpheratz\/Sirrah is home plate, then M15 is in center field, spitting and scratching himself and whatnot.\n\nNGC 7331 is one of your better galaxies that didn\u2019t make the Messier list. It\u2019s a beauty. Sometimes it is referred to as the \u201cMilky Way\u2019s Twin\u201d because we think our own galaxy is a lot like it and hopefully we are just as satisfying for beings 40 million light years away to look at.\n\nStephans QuintetStephan\u2019s Quintet is the most famous of the galaxy pile-ups. It\u2019s the sort of thing the Milky Way Galaxy has to look forward to in about 3 or 4 billion years from now. The Andromeda Galaxy is speeding towards us, we\u2019re speeding towards Andromeda, and how\u2019s this for oversight, galaxies don\u2019t have brakes. Meanwhile the government is totally ignoring the issue.\n\nal_03The Einstein Cross is in Pegasus and it\u2019s a hell of a deal. It looks like four little blobs surrounding a bigger blob. But it\u2019s actually four images of the same distant quasar whose light is being refracted and projected by the warping of space-time due to an intervening galaxy. Albert Einstein warned us this might happen, while he wasn\u2019t busy fleeing from Nazi schweinhunde.\n\nCarpe Noctem\n\n, , , ,\n\n\nSubscribe to our RSS feed and social profiles to receive updates.\n\nNo comments yet.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Friday, August 27, 2010\n\nIdaho Samizdat Hosts Nuclear Carnival #16\n\nHere is an excerpt from the 16th Carnival of Nuclear Energy at Idaho Samizdat Nuke Notes:\nAt\u00a0Nuke Power Talk, Gail Marcus reflects on modern urban life\u00a0without electricity\u00a0following a thunderstorm in the Washington, DC, area that took it out. She asks people to remember where the juice comes from the next time they flip the switch. Will it be there if you rely on windmills?\nNucler renaissanceAt Areva\u2019s North American\u00a0Next Energy\u00a0blog, Jarret Adams casts a skeptical eye on an essay by Carl Pope, director of the Sierra Club, on Huffington Post. Pope says nukes don\u2019t add up.\nAdams asks how Pope can think that when\u00a0nuclear energy\u2019s revival already is well under waywith more than 50 new plants under construction worldwide. More than 20 of these new reactors are being built in China alone.\nSteve Hedges\u00a0writing\u00a0at\u00a0Nuclear Town Hall\u00a0agrees. He notes that financial analysts at Standard & Poors published this note:\n\u201cIn other countries, new nuclear construction is in full swing. Many have adopted nuclear generation as an integral energy source option; about 60 nuclear plants with various reactor technologies are currently under construction around the world, and many more are in the advanced development and planning stages.\u201d\nHe also reports that S&P even has positive words for Europe where \u201ca steady stream of new reactors in Europe and Asia has established a relatively cheap supply chain and a skilled labor force there.\u201d\nIn the U.S. TVA has just\u00a0committed $248 million\u00a0for 2011 to continue the re-start of construction of its Bellefonte reactor in Scottsboro, Ala. Read all about it at\u00a0CoolHandNuke. TVA has successfully re-started a reactor at Browns Ferry and will complete work on one at Watts Bar in 2012.\n\nAt\u00a0Idaho Samizdat, Dan Yurman writes that\u00a0taxes and liability issues\u00a0tie nukes in knots in Germany and India. If these two countries want nuclear energy, they have a strange way of showing it. India\u2019s parliament finally passed the liability measure after protracted debate. It will open Indian markets to U.S. firms. Germany\u2019s nuclear utilities now want to issue government backed bonds to pay for investment in alternative technologies instead of paying a tax on fuel rods. Stay tuned.\n\nThe faux environmental movement is a multi-billion dollar enterprise, with strong tentacles extended deeply into all western governments and into inter-governmental agencies such as the UN and its IPCC. Besides blocking nuclear energy and all other workable forms of big energy and power, the faux environmental movement wants to reduce the human population of Earth by at least 90% -- see and the voluntary human extinction movement, for the barest hint of the deeper and unstated plans of the faux environmentalist industrial - political - economic complex. There are plenty of other websites where one can get a more explicit and intentional portrayal of the true aims of the movement, if one is willing to do a bit of digging.\n\nWith most of the world's large governments and governmental lobbies -- except Russia and China -- infested by the faux environmental movement, it is no wonder that Germany, India, and the US are unable to get a rational nuclear power construction program going.\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\nSubscribe to Post Comments [Atom]\n\n<< Home\n\nNewer Posts Older Posts",

Williams\u00a0\n\nA 2018 Pew Research poll suggest that 42% of Americans would be interested in traveling into space. But, so far, only seven super wealthy individuals have been able to do so with their own private funds. Multimillionaire Dennis Tito was the first tourist to travel into space to the ISS. Billionaire Charles Simonyi was the first space tourist to pay for\u00a0 two trips to the ISS.\n\nThe Russian space agency has charged these super wealthy individuals between $20 million to $40 million to travel to the ISS. And because of the extraordinarily high cost of space travel,\u00a0 space tourism has been exclusively for the super wealthy.\n\nMultimillionaire Dennis Tito (far left) became the first space tourist in April of 2001\nBigelow Aerospace is currently offering tickets to the ISS for $52 million each for a one to two month stay at the International Space Station.\u00a0\n\nThere are over 2100 billionaires on Earth. 52,000 people in the world who are worth over $100 million with 15,000 of those individuals living in the US alone. So there are at least 52,000 people on Earth who could afford to travel to a space and to a space station at current prices.\n\nCompanies like Bigelow Aerospace have also been developing their own private space habitats that they hope to deploy some time during the next decade. And\u00a0 NASA has recently presented space habitat concepts from several private space companies including Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin.\u00a0\n\n$50 million seems close to the current rate for training, transporting, housing, and feeding a space tourist.\u00a0 Optimally, you want to protect your customers health, so ten days in space should prevent any noticeable anatomical or physiological health effects. The ten days would include the launch days to the private space station and the return to the Earth's surface. That should give a tourist 8 full days inside of a private space station.\u00a0 The pre-launch experience should also include astronaut training with maybe a few hyperbolic flights aboard a jumbo jet to test the individuals reaction to brief periods of microgravity and dynamic flight situations.\nNotional 8.4 meter in diameter SLS derived microgravity habitat (Credit NASA)\nOnce inside of the orbiting space habitat, a paying tourist should be given spacious-- private quarters-- for sleeping, bathing, communicating with friends and family back on Earth and watching network and cable television programs or videos and movies on a private wide screen monitor.\u00a0\n\nA large microgravity recreational area should also be available for guest. And the recreational area should be at least as spacious as the accommodations\u00a0 experienced by astronauts aboard the old 6.6 meter in diameter Skylab facility. Notional habitats derived from the New Glenn upper stage (7 meters in diameter), Bigelow's Olympus: BA-2100 (12.6 meters in diameter), and SLS propellant tank technology derived habitats (8.4 meters in diameter) should provide spacious environments for microgravity recreational activities.\u00a0\n\nA Cupola window viewing area of the Earth should be continuously available for guest.\n\nSamantha Cristoforetti taking photos within the ISS Cupola (Credit: NASA)\n\nAt least three FlexCraft EVA tours should be available so that guest can experience moving about in space while experiencing spectacular view of the Earth and external views of the\u00a0 space habitat where they have been residing. FlexCraft would give tourist the advantage of quick and convenient access to space without the need for several hours of pre-breathing oxygen in order to prevent decompression sickness (the bends).\u00a0 Flexcraft can be flown in space by the tourist or tele-operated by personal on the ground or authorized personal inside of the space habitat. Manipulation arms could also be removed from FlexCraft vehicles that are utilized for tourist.\n\nNotional FlexCraft single person vehicle (Credit: NASA)\nThe commercial spacecraft pilots could serve as the onsite guest service agents for the tourist they've taken up to the space habitat. Robots operated by personal on Earth could be used by the space habitat owners to assist the pilots and their guest-- even on FlexCraft EVAs.\u00a0\n\nIf the polls are correct then their should be at least\u00a0 6300 super wealthy Americans who desire to travel to a space station-- and can afford to do so. And if there is a similar statistical desire\u00a0 world wide, then there should be\u00a0 at least\u00a0 22,000 super wealthy people who want to travel into space-- and can afford to do so.\n\nAnnually, if just 10% of the super wealthy who desired to travel into space (2200 people)-- did so-- that would require 440 to 550 private commercial launches every year. In 2018, there were only 111 successful space launches with only four them being crew launches. So space tourism should create dramatic increase in the launch rate accompanied by substantial reductions in launch cost. But even if it were only 1%, that would require 44 to 55 private commercial launches every year.\n\nBut what if there was a national or even an international lotto system that could allow private individuals to risk an American dollar for a chance to travel into space? What if\u00a0 42% of adult Americans risked $5 a year, on average, for a chance to travel into space through a Space Lotto system?\u00a0 That would generate approximately $1.2 billion a year for crew launches. And that would be enough money to send 24 average Jane's and Joe's into space every year (5 to 6 additional crew launches).\n\nBut you could add even more incentive for Americans to purchase Space Lotto tickets if winners were given a monetary prize of $250,000 (less than 1% of the cost for the round trip ticket to space). Winners could be given $125,000 initially for their time off from work for astronaut training and traveling into space. An additional $125,000 would be given to them once they returned from space.\n\n\u00a0If 42% of the world's adult population were willing to participate in Space Lotto system with a similar financial reward but only risked $2 per year, that would still generate $5 billion a year. That could purchase enough tickets for 100 winners per year (20 to 25 additional crew launches).\n\nOptimally, a single private space habitat might be able to accommodate 36 tourist flights per year for a 10 day stay. Ten habitats would be required to accommodate 360 flights per year. So, obviously, there would also be a significant launch demand just to deploy the private habitats needed to accommodate potential tourist.\u00a0\n\nRecreational activity within the interior of the 6.6 meter in diameter Skylab space station.\u00a0\n\nReferences and Links\n\nSpace tourism?

        "text":"Tag: T Cells\n\nAdoptive Cell Therapy Part 1: Chimeric Antigen Receptors\n\nby on Apr.26, 2011, under Oncology\n\nImagine a person with Stage IV Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells. A scan of his bone marrow shows almost complete replacement of healthy cells with cancerous. The cancer is chemorefractory, meaning it survives every dose even while his normal rapidly dividing cells do not. Now, instead of the normal treatment progression and a poor prognosis, some healthy T cells are extracted from his blood. They are processed, induced to replicate, and then the large resulting colony of cells is infused back into his blood. Thirty days later, a scan reveals his bone marrow to be clear of the cancer and another 6 months later shows the same; a complete resolution to the cancer.\n\nWhile I asked you to imagine, you actually don\u2019t have to; the process, the person, and the results are real; part of a clinical trial which is still actively recruiting patients. It is not complete and the information presented in the NIH webcast, which was my original reference for this post, has not been audited let alone published1. The same however, was not the case in all CAR trials, two courses in others, resulting instead, sadly, in fatalities2. However, as I will present in my next post, the protocol was changed for the second group and there were special circumstances. (* See Note: I am not a physician, I am self-taught in the bio-sciences).\n\nThis new approach to cancer treatment, which includes the specific therapy that killed this man\u2019s cancer, is known as Adoptive Cell Therapy. Specifically in this case, engineered genes coding for what is known as a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) were introduced into the T cells extracted from his blood via a retro-viral vector. I wrote about Antigen Receptors over my last four posts and the word Chimeric in the world of molecular biology refers to the fact that the gene is actually a combination of other genes or gene segments brought together from different sources. You may note that the concerns from previous attempts at using retroviruses are mitigated here because the transfection actually occurs, effectively, in a petri dish rather than in the body of the patient. Further, using a cytotoxic T cell is preferable to say antibody treatment since rather than relying on an orchestrated immune response to the antibody binding of its ligand to kill a target cell; cytotoxic T cells kill directly and serially.\n\nThere are essentially three steps in the engineering of a gene which encodes the CAR. The first is to identify a molecule, the new receptor\u2019s ligand, that exists on the surface of the cells that are to be destroyed. The second is to find a molecule that has binding specificity for that ligand, perhaps a variable region from an antibody or the extracellular region of a co-stimulatory receptor.\n\nFor example Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of breast and other cancers. It has binding specificity for erbB2 which is highly expressed on the surface of malignant cells. Another example comes from the fact that the CD8 receptor found on T Cells happens to bind with high affinity to the glycoprotein GP120 which is present on the envelope of HIV.\n\nIf an antibody is chosen, segments of the genes that encode the variable regions of the heavy and light chains (see previous posts) are linked together from the 3\u2019 end of the light chain to the 5\u2019 end of the heavy (note that DNA molecules are formed in one direction 5\u2019 to 3\u2019)3. This produces a gene which encodes a single protein designated scFab or Single Chain Antigen Binding Fragment.\n\nThe next step is to find a suitable signal generation protein chain for the intracellular domain of the chimeric receptor. This step is far simpler than the first two given that it appears that there a relatively small number which can initiate T cell effector programs such as cytotoxicity. Second generation CARs, for example, used the zeta ( \u03b6) chain of the T Cell Receptor Complex joined to the scFab via the transmembrane region of a co-stimulatory molecule such as CD 8 or CD282. Third generation CARs use the intracellular signaling domains from 4-1 bb or OX402. I haven\u2019t read of the reasoning for the change, but my thoughts are that it stems from the fact that 4=1 bb and OX40 are present only on T cells which are already activated. The \u03b6 chain, on the other hand is involved in the initial activation of a T cell. Therefore the results of the signaling through 4-1 bb and OX40 would be more specific to cytotoxic effector function rather than the proliferative and cytokine release functions that are part of the in the initial activation of a T cell. This means that there wouldn\u2019t be cascading bursts of T cell proliferation and cytokine production following each encounter with the CAR and it\u2019s antigen thus lessening the potential for a massive expansion of the T cell population after injection and adverse reactions to very large releases of cytokines.\n\nTo illustrate the need for a signaling region, consider the \u03b6 chain. The T and B Cell Antigen Receptors, whose formation I presented in my previous four posts, are key to the function of our adaptive immune response. However, they are not present in the membrane alone and they are not actually capable of producing an intracellular signal. Though I didn\u2019t mention the other proteins in my posts, the Antigen Receptors are actually part of a complex which includes other proteins in close association which are capable because they contain ITAMs. The ITAMs; Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Moieties, are initiators of stimulatory signals and are activated when the Antigen Receptor binds its ligand. In a T cell these proteins are collectively known as CD3 and together with the Antigen Receptor; the T Cell Receptor Complex.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 T cell Receptor Complex\n\nReturning to our hero and the generation of the Chimeric Antigen Receptors that killed his cancer\u2026 In the lab (in vitro), the proliferation of his T Cells was induced, amazingly, using beads engineered to mimic the activity of dendritic cells which are the most proficient presenters of antigen to T cells in the body (in vivo). Then the genes encoding the third generation CAR are delivered to those cells, via a retrovirus. His T cells are subjected to a battery of quality tests and then cryogenically frozen until he was ready to receive them.\n\nThe scFab region of this CAR has binding affinity for a molecule (the receptor\u2019s \u201cligand\u201d) expressed on the surface of the malignant cells known as CD19. When the millions of his T Cells, rendered cytotoxic and specialized through synthetic bioengineering, were injected into his blood, the cancer was gone within 30 days.\n\nDespite this astounding result, and the result of others in the trial, the work, is still far from complete. CD19 may be expressed on his malignant cells, but those cells were B cells, and CD19 is expressed on virtually all B Cells. So at 6 months, while his bone marrow was clear of the malignant cells, it was also clear of any B cells. While this was actually a big step to the positive given immunosuppressive chemo isn\u2019t usually so selective, an \u201con-target but off-organ\u201d effect has been seen in this and other studies2. This occurs when the target of the anitgen targeted by the T cells is expressed on healthy cells not intended as targets. In the case of CD19, this is less an issue because the Immune System is regenerative and its function is specific. However, if the target is expressed on the cells of healthy tissue to a high enough degree, the results can be devistating.\n\nThe people included in the trail, as I interpret the information, had a very poor prognosis with advanced, chemorefractory cancers. The two fatalities in another CAR trial involved several differentiating factors, but the exact cause of death was presented as inderterminate. In one case there was the possibility of an unrelated infection as the cause, but in the other \u201con-target, off-organ\u201d seemed likely. I will present more information on this as well as the \u201con-target but off-organ\u201d effect in my next post.\n\n* Note: I\u2019m not a researcher nor a clinician, and nothing I present in this post, or any other post I may make on a health science topic, should in any way be considered medical advice, the intent of the authors of any of the texts or research I reference, or an authoritative presentation on any source used.

        "text":"Thursday, June 11, 2009\n\n\nMiracle Biofuel Plant Jatropha Reveals Its Achilles Heel\n\nA single liter of jatropha biodiesel requires a whopping 20,000 liters of water to grow, say researchers at the Netherlands\u2019 University of Twente.\n\nBy Chris Morrison\n\n\nJune 9th, 2009\n\nJatropha, a hardy, drought resistant plant that grows oil-heavy fruit, was supposed to be the salvation of the biodiesel industry. The plant, which was targeted for an $80 million pilot project by BP and D1 Oils, can grow on marginal lands that crops don\u2019t like. It tends to favor a land type that is common in developing countries like China and India, as well as many African nations, giving them a much-needed edge. Its fruit can be up to 40 percent oil, making it an excellent energy source.\n\nBut jatropha is also new to cultivation, and planters are still figuring out how to effectively grow the plant. Predictably enough, they\u2019re finding out that rosy initial estimates on how well the plant would do may have been vastly overblown. The biggest problem by far is the amount of water the plant consumes, according to a study covered in MIT\u2019s Technology Review.\n\nA single liter of jatropha biodiesel requires a whopping 20,000 liters of water to grow, say researchers at the Netherlands\u2019 University of Twente. That\u2019s more than canola, corn, soybeans or sugarcane \u2014 more, in fact, than any commonly used biofuel crop. The two closest, canola and soybeans, require about 14,000 liters each.\n\nThe irony of jatropha\u2019s water needs is considerable, since the plant is supposed to be a godsend for arid land that doesn\u2019t get much rainfall. The report suggests that jatropha does just fine without much water, but only produces bumper crops when it has plenty to drink, much like any other plant.\n\nHow much of a problem will the water requirements be for the burgeoning jatropha industry? Possibly not as much as it might seem at first glance. Irrigation of dry land is practiced around the world at massive scales, so the barrier is not technical. However, sucking up all the water available in a locality will pit jatropha against food crops and people, putting it in the same boat as ethanol from corn.\n\nYields from jatropha may also be only a quarter of some estimates, so the economics of the plant may not be as incredible as first thought, either. What those are, exactly, will be revealed only later by the success of a first generation of companies like Galten Biofuels, Jatoil and the BP partnership.\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s also hope that jatropha will mature into a better biofuel producer. Any plant new to cultivation takes a period of time before it reaches an optimum tame form, and jatropha has only been in use for a few years. There are also companies like SG Biofuels, covered here a couple months ago, that are performing gene research on jatropha in hopes of extending its range and improving its yield.\n\nThe complete report can de downloaded at the following link:\n\nDownload PNAS-2009-Gerbens-Leenes-0812619106.pdf\n\nNo comments:",

I had an instant visual of bees dressed in suits and carrying briefcases, furiously buzzing over, under, and around a conference table. They weren\u2019t accomplishing anything\u2014just making a lot of noise and looking for something to sting. Then it occurred to me that all worker bees are female. Each bee in my mental image was now wearing a suit with a skirt, and red high heels on all six feet. By this point I was ready to give up on the idea of swarming in business altogether. However, I am a huge believer in collective intelligence, whether at work or in the wild. Similarly, the human brain is naturally wired for empathy, connectivity, and collaboration. An important issue may develop in another time zone across the world, or an immediate deadline may be set. Progress will depend on your ability to bring together highly functioning groups of diverse people.\n\nRelated:\u00a0\u00a0WisdomCollective IntelligenceCollaborative Organizations\n\nThe Nature of Consciousness: How the Internet Could Learn to Feel - Steve Paulson \"Romantic reductionist\" neuroscientist Christof Koch discusses the scientific side of consciousness, including the notion that all matter is, to varying degrees, sentient. If you had to list the hardest problems in science -- the questions even some scientists say are insoluble -- you would probably end up with two: Where do the laws of physics come from? How does the physical stuff in our brains produce conscious experience? Even though philosophers have obsessed over the \"mind-body problem\" for centuries, the mystery of consciousness wasn't considered a proper scientific question until two or three decades ago. Then, a couple of things happened.\n\nGetting from Collective Intelligence to Collective Action I really enjoyed attending the Collective Intelligence FOO Camp, sponsored by Google and O'Reilly Media, last weekend. I'd been expecting a sort of geek slumber party, and had looked forward to rolling out my awesome Darth Vader impersonation. I was all set to cut loose with a growling, \"I'm your father, Luke.\" Collective Intelligence Collective Intelligence As we explore ways to generate more effective groups, organizations, institutions, and other human systems, it may help to begin by taking a closer look at collective intelligence. When I investigate the problems that we face in the world today, I seldom find that individual evil is a central cause. More often I find basically good, intelligent people collectively generating discord and disaster -- in families, groups, organizations, nations and the world. Meanwhile, in their own lives, from their own perspective (and usually that of their loved ones), most of them are doing perfectly good, decent things.\n\nHard problem of consciousness The existence of a \"hard problem\" is controversial and has been disputed by some philosophers.[4][5] Providing an answer to this question could lie in understanding the roles that physical processes play in creating consciousness and the extent to which these processes create our subjective qualities of experience.[3] Several questions about consciousness must be resolved in order to acquire a full understanding of it. These questions include, but are not limited to, whether being conscious could be wholly described in physical terms, such as the aggregation of neural processes in the brain.\n\nCollective intelligence in small teams A new study co-authored by MIT researchers documents the existence of collective intelligence among groups of people who cooperate well, showing that such intelligence extends beyond the cognitive abilities of the groups\u2019 individual members, and that the tendency to cooperate effectively is linked to the number of women in a group. Many social scientists have long contended that the ability of individuals to fare well on diverse cognitive tasks demonstrates the existence of a measurable level of intelligence in each person. In a study published Thursday, Sept. 30, in the advance online issue of the journal Science, the researchers applied a similar principle to small teams of people. They discovered that groups featuring the right kind of internal dynamics perform well on a wide range of assignments, a finding with potential applications for businesses and other organizations. \u201cWe did not know if groups would show a general cognitive ability across tasks,\u201d said Thomas W.\n\nCollaborative Leadership What is collaborative leadership?Why practice collaborative leadership?When is collaborative leadership appropriate? A Brief Guide to Embodied Cognition: Why You Are Not Your Brain Embodied cognition, the idea that the mind is not only connected to the body but that the body influences the mind, is one of the more counter-intuitive ideas in cognitive science. In sharp contrast is dualism, a theory of mind famously put forth by Rene Descartes in the 17th century when he claimed that \u201cthere is a great difference between mind and body, inasmuch as body is by nature always divisible, and the mind is entirely indivisible\u2026 the mind or soul of man is entirely different from the body.\u201d In the proceeding centuries, the notion of the disembodied mind flourished. From it, western thought developed two basic ideas: reason is disembodied because the mind is disembodied and reason is transcendent and universal. However, as George Lakoff and Rafeal N\u00fa\u00f1ez explain:\n\nCollective intelligence Does this person feel playful or irritated? If you said irritated, you aren't as likely to raise the collective intelligence of a group. It is a truism that the smartest of all of us is not smarter than all of us, but how much smarter all of us are depends on how we work together. Ecology lives and breathes by group efforts these days--very rarely are papers ever published by a single author. Yet, we have paid scant attention to how to put these groups together and what makes them successful. A paper last fall in Science actually did experiments to test what factors made groups collectively the most intelligent.",

        "text":"The best technology is invisible, and Google and HTC hope that this counts.\n\n\nGoogle used to, I don\u2019t know if they still do, have a saying that the best technology was the technology that was invisible to the consumer. In other words, if you develop technology correctly people shouldn\u2019t even be able to realise that they\u2019re using it.\n\n\nScientists publish a plan to bring back the extinct Caspian Tiger\n\n\nNow, saying that is one thing, and creating technology that provides consumers with a seamless, and frictionless customer experience is all great, but as most analysts keep pointing to 2016, then 2017 as \u201cthe year virtual reality (VR) goes mainstream\u201d I still come back to this original saying \u2013 in part because I for one don\u2019t think we will see mass adoption of consumer VR when the whole family is still forced to sit on the sofa and watch a film in VR wearing a massive headset. It didn\u2019t fly for 3D TV\u2019s, which recently, officially died a death, and it won\u2019t fly for VR either.\n\nThe best VR technology is surely going to be the one you \u201cjust use\u201d and is \u201cinvisible.\u201d In my mind VR will begin to see mass adoption when it\u2019s embedded into contact lenses and where you can turn it on and off just by blinking. That\u2019s invisible, and today\u2019s massive VR headsets, most of which give people neck ache, are anything but invisible. In fact, they\u2019re the opposite they couldn\u2019t be more visible if they tried \u2013 maybe painting them bright orange would up the ante there\u2026\n\nIn recognition of all of this Google\u2019s Daydream Labs\u00a0team have partnered with HTC to see if they can figure a way to turn VR headsets invisible \u2013 and it looks like they might have succeeded. That said though it\u2019s not invisible by my definition \u2013 as you\u2019ll see from the video below. However, kudos for trying\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new technology that the duo are developing lets spectators see the VR users full face, while they have the headset on. In order to achieve this the team first constructs a 3D model of the user\u2019s face, using a colour and depth camera in a process that takes about a minute to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, they\u2019re handed a modified HTC Vive headset that\u2019s capable of tracking eye gaze. For a fully immersive video demo, the user is shot in front of a green screen while they\u2019re in a VR experience, with their VR environment composited into the background. The specialised camera setup used to film it all is calibrated and time-synced with the headset, which makes it possible to replace the headset with the 3D face model and line it up with the visible portion of the user\u2019s face.\n\nSlapping someone\u2019s face onto the outside of a VR headset still looks strange so the team opted for a \u2018scuba mask effect.\u2019\n\n\n6G demonstrated in the labs as researchers stream uncompressed 8k video\n\n\n\u201cHeadset removal is poised to enhance communication and social interaction in VR itself with diverse applications like VR video conference meetings, multiplayer VR gaming, and exploration with friends and family. Going from an utterly blank headset to being able to see, with photographic realism, the faces of fellow VR users promises to be a significant transition in the VR world, and we are excited to be a part of it,\u201d said the Google team in a blog post.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned though it still looks weird, albeit a small step forward to making these things \u201cinvisible\u201d but there\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement. I\u2019m waiting for my contact lenses\u2026\n\nAbout author\n\nMatthew Griffin\n\nMatthew Griffin, described as \u201cThe Adviser behind the Advisers\u201d and a \u201cYoung Kurzweil,\u201d is the founder and CEO of the World Futures Forum and the 311 Institute, a global Futures and Deep Futures consultancy working between the dates of 2020 to 2070, and is an award winning futurist, and author of \u201cCodex of the Future\u201d series.
