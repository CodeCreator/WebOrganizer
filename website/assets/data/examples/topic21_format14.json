        "text":"Supporting Partners\n\nRobin Valadares\n\nHey there,\n\nI\u2019m Robin, a physiotherapist, movement advocate and a golf enthusiast! I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to attend Queen\u2019s University for my undergraduate degree in Kinesiology and McMaster University for my postgraduate Master\u2019s in Physiotherapy.\u00a0\n\nA small secret about me, golf was my second love. I used to be obsessed with soccer, both playing and coaching, however after a few troubling knee injuries, my playing days were over. Thankfully I was still able to contribute to the sport, through on-field coverage as a therapist at the 2015 Pan Am games.\n\nAfter soccer, came golf, and I have been hooked since my early 20\u2019s. So much so that I sought out all the technical information to incorporate into my practice. This lead me to the Titleist Performance Institute (TPI), where I was fortunate enough to be credentialed as a Medical Level 3 Practitioner for golf specific rehabilitation. My goal is to enhance the bodies of both amateur and professional golfers to their unique swing characteristics.\u00a0\n\nOutside of my clinical practice, I have an educational role as Associate Clinical Professor (Adjunct) in the School of Rehabilitation Sciences at McMaster University working with the physiotherapy students of tomorrow.\n\nLooking forward to working with YOU,\u201d\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

        "text":"Glen BolesGlen was born in St.Stephen, New Brunswick, in 1934 and moved to Calgary in 1953. As a child all his spare time was spent either drawing, taking part in sports or roaming the woods. In 1957 he was persuaded to go climbing by fellow worker mountain climber Heinz Kahl, a native Bavarian. With Kahl and English climber Brian Greenwood he was introduced to the more difficult side of climbing, by 1960 he began to take it seriously.Glen Boles\n\nGlen has taken part in many facets of mountaineering from expedition climbing to mountain rescue and since the early days, he has climbed in the St Elias Range of the Yukon and Alaska, the Alps of Europe and extensively in the Rockies and the Interior Ranges of British Columbia, summiting close to 600. His first love though are the Canadian Rockies where he has topped out on over 450 peaks including many new routes and first ascents. During this time his pencils, pens and brushes had to take a back seat.\n\nAlso an avid skier, he has enjoyed cross country skiing, ski mountaineering as well as downhill skiing over the years. He spent 13 years on the Canadian Ski Patrol System and is now a member of the Ski Friends program at the Lake Louise ski area.\n\nGlen BolesGlen is now retired after spending thirty five and a half years with the City of Calgary Waterworks Engineering Division, the last eighteen years as the Waterworks Planner. He has been married to his wife Elizabeth since 1965 and resides in Cochrane, Alberta. Since retiring, he has resumed his interest in art, drawing in pen and pencil and painting with water colours and acrylics.\n\nFrom his mountaineering experiences, Glen has also developed a keen interest in photography and writing as well as art, these have evolved as enjoyable sidelines. Over the years he has built up a large collection of mountain photos in both colour and black and white to work from.\n\nGlen BolesGlen is the author of a book titled \u201cGlen Boles My Mountain Album\u201c. This book of his black and white photography and his art was published in 2006.\n\nHe was also co-author with Bill Putnam and Roger Laurilla of two editions of \u201cThe Climbers Guide to the Canadian Rockies-South\u201d and \u201cPlace Names of the Canadian Alps\u201d, renamed \u201cPlace Names of the Canadian Mountains\u201d for the second edition. He attributes his enjoyment in the mountains to the freedom to explore, to keep fit and to think young.\n\nGlen is an Honorary Member of the Alpine Club of Canada, the American Alpine Club and the Calgary Mountain Club. He acted as honorary president of the Alpine Club of Canada from 2005-2009. During the Banff Mountain Film Festival of 2005, Glen received the Bill March \u201cSummit of Excellence Award\u201d for his contribution to Canadian mountaineering.",

        "text":"NEW: Photo books of GP Final in Barcelona available for purchase\n\nPhotoDave was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia where he received his early education at Windsor Elementary, Windsor Academy and Windsor Regional High before moving on to Dalhousie University to pursue an education in Biology, Chemistry and Psychology. Post grad work followed at N.S. Teachers College, Mount St. Vincent University and Acadia University.\n\nUpon graduation Dave took a position with the Windsor Regional School Board where he taught till his retirement in 1993 after 30 years of teaching biology and enjoying his many students and hobbies.\n\nThree of those hobbies were Travel, Photography and Figure Skating. Dave has now combined all three and now says: \"I have retired and gone to Heaven\". What better way to enjoy your retirement?\n\nDave first watched figure skating live when the ISU Worlds were held in Halifax in 1990, then he was hooked. The only Worlds not attended were the 92 Oakland and 93 Prague (the spring break just did not match up with the event date). Now that retirement is here Dave travels to both the Junior and Senior Worlds, Europeans, 4 Continents, Canadian Nationals, Skate America, Skate Canada as well as the GP's held in Paris and Germany.\n\nDave has been fortunate to have travelled around the globe photographing landscapes and nature including trips to exotic places like the Galapagos Islands, The Serengeti, China, the red centre of Australia and Great Barrier Reef, New Zealand. All but four American states as well as all Canadian provinces and the north as well as extensive travels throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nDave's photos have been published in skating magazines around the globe as well as many National newspapers as requested by his skater friends when they want their images published in their home countries.\n\nThe highlight of Dave's career as a figure skating photographer was a recommendation by the ISU to the IOC to cover the 2006 Games in Turin as a specialist photographer.\n\nThe fondest memories are seeing the smiles on the skaters faces when they receive disks containing photos of themselves from previous competitions. THAT MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE",

Barson finished with two goals and an assist from his center back position in 2010. As a result, he was called up by the U.S. U-20 National Team at the end of March for a pair of competitions. As a freshman in 2009,\u00a0Barson started all 25 games to earn Soccer America All-Freshman Second Team and College Soccer News All-Freshman Second Team status. He was a key contributer on a defense unit that set school records for goals-against-average (0.27) and shutouts (19) in his first season.\n\n\nBarson starred on multiple U.S. national teams, including the U-18s, U-17s and U-15s. The Lewis Center native spent two semesters in the U.S. U-17 Residency program in Bradenton, Fla.\n\n\nAs a senior, Barson was named to the 2008 Parade All-American team. The defender was two-time NSCAA Youth All-American and 2008 all-state second team honoree for Div. I at Olentangy High School.\n\n\nBarson was signed by Columbus as a Homegrown Player on January 10, 2013.\n\n\nBarson is the son of William and Darlene Barson. During his time off the field, Barson enjoys being outdoors, cooking healthy meals and exercising. His favorite movies include \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d \u201cHeavyweights,\u201d \u201cRemember the Titans\u201d and \u201cZoolander.\u201d If Barson is listening to music, there\u2019s a good chance that he\u2019s listening to his favorite bands: Bruno Mars, Bastille, The Script and Mumford and Sons. The Columbus\u00a0 native\u2019s favorite place he\u2019s traveled to is Japan, and would like to travel to another coastal country, Greece. The 22-year old has traveled heavily during his life as he\u2019s played soccer on every continent except Africa and Antarctica. Barson is a supporter of La Liga\u2019s FC Barcelona, as well as Ohio State University athletics, and his favorite soccer player is FC Barcelona defender Carles Puyol. His favorite soccer memory is winning the 2010 NCAA National Championship at the University of Akron.\n\nRead More\n\n\nCareer Statistics (Regular Season)\n2016Columbus Crew SC5202250003000\n2015Columbus Crew SC10404561338020\n2014Columbus Crew138076603210010\n2013Columbus Crew20180161213014000\nCareer Totals-48320305929535030\nView More",

During my time at university I also worked at my goal of becoming a professional athlete. I was granted my pro licence at the end of 2011.\n\nIn 2013 I was invited to train with the Queensland Academy of Sport squad in France for the European summer. I now train under Stephen Moss at the QAS.\n\nIn 2014 I won Australian elite titles over both the Sprint and Olympic distances followed by my first world cup win in Chengdu, China, only my 3rd world cup race. I then went on to win the World Under 23 Duathlon Championships in Pontevedra, Spain, and finished 15th in my debut World Triathlon Series race in Chicago. To cap off the year I was selected on my first Australian team for the Triathlon World Championships in Edmonton where I finished 2nd in the U23 event, and was part of the silver medal winning Australian U23 mixed relay team.\n\nThe 2015 season, which has just come to a close, was the best season of my career so far. It was my first season out of the Under 23 category, racing in the World Triathlon Series. My top result was a bronze medal in the penultimate round held in Edmonton in September. I finished the series ranked 25th in the world after missing the first half of the season due to injury and only scoring points in 5 of 6 possible races. I was also the first Australian across the line in the Rio Olympic test event. My goals for the 2016 season are to make the Rio Olympic Games, finish in the top 15 overall in the World Triathlon Series, and have another WTS podium finish.\n\nMy career goals are Australian representation at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and ultimately winning the elite world championships.",

By blending traditional techniques and modalities with functional fitness, his clients achieve success, and have fun along the way. A lifelong athlete, Cody was drawn towards becoming a personal trainer after seeing the success his parents had when working with one.\n\nWith four plus years of experience as a martial arts instructor, a year coaching tumbling for gymnastics and cheer, and a multitude of other fitness related jobs, he decided to become a Personal Trainer. He managed the Snap fitness in Milwaukie, Oregon, for a little over a year, while also working as a trainer. He decided to step down as manager so he could go back to school to continue his education, and currently attends Portland State University.\n\nAfter working as a trainer for three years in the corporate gym setting, he grew tired of that environment, and knew it was time to move on and start his own fitness studio. With eight years working as a coach and instructor, Cody knows what he is doing, but is still incredibly passionate about helping people reach their goals. He has helped three people lose over a hundred pounds, and many people lose smaller, but still significant amounts of weight.
