Far Cry 4 writer CJ Kershner and Hohokum senior producer Zach Wood serve up two piping hot interviews on this week\u2019s beefy show. Plus: New PlayStation releases for July 22nd, hands on with The Last of Us Remastered, riveting elephant talk, and a pile of letters.\n\nSubscribe via iTunes or RSS, or download here\n\nStuff We Talked About\n\n  \u2022 Far Cry 4\n  \u2022 The Last of Us Remastered\n  \u2022 Oddworld New \u2018N\u2019 Tasty\n  \u2022 Hohokum\n  \u2022 Riding elephants to dinner\n\nOfficial PlayStation Blogcast: Sid ShumanOfficial PlayStation.Blogcast - Nick SuttnerOfficial PlayStation Blogcast: Justin MassongillOfficial PlayStation Blogcast: Ryan Clements\n\nSend us questions and tips: or leave a voice message! 650-288-6706\n\nThe Cast\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: PSN game release dates are subject to change without notice. Game details are gathered from press releases from their individual publishers and\/or ESRB rating descriptions.]\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\n6 Author Replies\n\n  \u2022 BossmanCCrowder1\n\n    Always enjoy Hohohohohohohokum talk.\n\n  \u2022 So funny story, I was literally replaying Bioshock Infinite to get some trophies while listening to the podcast, and that\u2019s when Sid mentioned on the podcast that you could unlock the framerate, and I was like, \u201cwait, what??\u201d and sure enough I went to settings and he\u2019s correct! I\u2019ve been to the settings several times in this game and for some reason looked over that feature\u2026 lol I guess I really am blind! =P Thanks Sid! lol\n\n  \u2022 The last few episodes where Sid rules the time schedule with an iron fist, at first bothered me, a extra minute or two of movie talk wouldn\u2019t hurt. Now I find myself in a very similar position. I\u2019m the president of a non-profit company, and during the board meetings I find myself having to cut conversations short to keep to the schedule. You don\u2019t want to go to long, but yet need to discuss the topic. I\u2019ll listen tonight, thank you for your dream project, another blogcast episode.\n\n  \u2022 Another great episode guys! The Home improvement stuff had me laughing like crazy.\n\n  \u2022 Guys, what is up? Who comes up with these titles Hohokum No Cry, very creative, I Like!\n\n  \u2022 One request though, more interviews. It would be great to hear Gustavo Santaolalla talk about his work in The Last of Us.\n\n  \u2022 Why does the \u201cour podcast\u201d tab on the page no longer lead to the actual podcast page?\n\n  \u2022 #Suikoden2onPSStore\n\n  \u2022 Needs a weekly running joke.. I am just saying.. Do I need to get on this or something?\n\n  \u2022 Sid, someone asked a verrrry verrrry pertinent question in Ryan\u2019s thread \u2013 about Ratchet & Clank being cross buy. When I first signed up for this whole Playstation Plus experiment (prior to receiving my E3-preordered PS4), I bought the Ratchet & Clank Collection for PS3 as well.\n\n    So, will I be able to play it on my Vita? Talk to me, Goose.\n\n    Thanks Sid.\n\n  \u2022 I really only logged in to say one thing and I hope someone from Sony reads this\u2026but the VITA memory cards is why the VITA is FAILING. The price of the VITA memory cards is absolutely horrible. I absolutely REFUSE to buy anymore VITA memory cards until the price is reasonable. a 64gb micro sd card for my phone is $37, but for my Vita its $100 \u2026.how is that even remotely reasonable. Do you know how many games I have NOT bought because of these ridiculous prices. I\u2019m tired of deleting and reinstalling my games. So basically i just stopped buying games i play what i have and when I finish, if I even care about the game anymore..then I buy it. But guess what\u20269 times out of 10, I don\u2019t buy it because my interest has shifted to something else. So sony if you want me to continue to support my VITA, you need to severly slash the price of the memory cards. Becaues THIS guy isn\u2019t paying $100 for a 64gb card.\n\n  \u2022 @Stealthieone I think most people will agree with you, I know I do. I did buy a 32GB memory card for my Vita when it was on sale for $75. That was over a year ago and now my favorite gaming device has changed dramatically in that year. Fewer retail games are available and all I hear about is remote play. Remote play does no good where I play my Vita because I\u2019m on the road without Internet connection. When it comes to retail versions of games as someone who has collected games for years this is not good news for me. I own over 40 retail Vita games also. For the record I just purchased a 32GB SD Card for another portable gaming device for $17 new.\n\n  \u2022 Hello,\n\n    I was wondering if Sony was planning on allowing sub-account to master-account upgrades anytime soon? On the PS3, the difference between a sub-account and a master account was negligible. But on the PS4 there is a vast difference \u2013 PS+, Billing information, Sharing, FB\/Twitter, etc. Is Sony going to allow sub-accounts to have more functionality or allow them to upgrade or both? Thanks!\n\nPlease enter your date of birth.",

It wouldn't be. It's one of the best looking games I have ever seen or played. But at the end of the day it is shallow and hogs the SE development space. We are working on a trilogy on one RPG and it's getting tiresome. Lightning isn't a great character and I don't see the appeal in her or the story itself. We have had over 10 KH spinoffs since then and now even more with the HD remakes, but still now 3rd full installment. I'm ready for something else from Square.\n\nTheLyonKing1560d ago\n\nAgito localization aswell :)\n\nJinkies1560d ago (Edited 1560d ago )\n\nUrgh....WE DON'T GIVE A CRAP Square, we don't give a crap about FF13-3 and continuing the story of the depressing, bland and boring Lightning.

How can you not see direct correlation with what you're doing, fans complaining about what you're doing, fans not buying the games you make, and your drop in profits?\n\nShow all comments (40)\nThe story is too old to be commented.",

Got Kaz anti-virus on Win7 64bit. Playing Mass Effect 2. Version 1.0 of trainer ran without a hitch. As soon as I DL'd v 1.01, whammo, Kaz alarms everywhere for Trojan horses... multiple .dll files found and forced into delete after first run of trainer. It even crashed my RAID drive (luckily had backup image). After reinstall, it tried the same stunt tonight.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Why are .dll's being detected and why are they being created in the first place exactly?\n\n2) How do we know exactly that a Trojan or keylogger is not being dl'd with stuff from this site? You say that other scanners do not detect it. That could be a false negative on their part.\n\n3) Instead of calling your customer's \"Idiots\", which makes me trust you even less, why not explain in more detail why your programs set off so many alarms (beyond the little that is in your FAQ)? I know you guys apparently work hard. But hey, you wanted this business, now how about some answers?\n\nThank you very nicely in advance.

Waiting for funds to transfer to put forward a well deserved and earned donation ;)\n\nHowever, I do have a question. Would people be able to donate through Steam? I have a few friends who love ToME, but they're not fans of PayPal. If there were to be an option to donate through Steam, or possibly 'buy' a donation with Steam it'd probably result in a higher turnover of donations. Just putting it forward. Thanks again for a wonderful game!\n< >\n\u6b63\u5728\u663e\u793a\u7b2c 1 - 3 \u6761\uff0c\u5171 3 \u6761\u7559\u8a00\nRosetta Stoned 2013\u5e741\u670818\u65e5\u4e0b\u53481:55\u00a0\nThere's a \"safe\" way with Paypal, create an account, but only for attaching a pre-paid card (read Paypal's FAQ) to it for the donation. After that you can either ignore that account or delete it after your donator status has been updated by the server.\nI feel real uneasy reading that... Why should I trust something from a Keter class, hmm?\nThanks though, I'll be sure to try that approach with some of my friends, hopefully that will make them budge. I've used PayPal several times, and trust it as much as Steam, but you know how some people are about changes.\nStome 2013\u5e743\u670825\u65e5\u4e0a\u534812:43\u00a0\nSeems to me the only way Steam as it is could handle \"donations\" is if they made the donate features into a DLC pack. The problem with that is setting a price for it as atm its however much you would like to give.\n\nBut yeah other then that Steam has no set-up for giving a custom amount as far as I can tell.\n< >\n\u6b63\u5728\u663e\u793a\u7b2c 1 - 3 \u6761\uff0c\u5171 3 \u6761\u7559\u8a00\n\u6bcf\u9875\u663e\u793a\u6570\uff1a 15 30 50",

        "text":"MMLs are terrible - Lack of competent T2 siege option contributes to turtling\n\n\nT2 Mobile Missile Launchers (MMLs) for all factions are terrible. This is bad for gameplay as it makes the most interesting tech level (T2) also the worst for turtling. MMLs should therefore be greatly improved.\n\nFirst, let's note that MMLs fill a similar role in Tech 2 that T1 mobile artillery fills in Tech 1 and then state clearly why MMLs are so awful:\n\n  \u2022 For Cybran, T2 MML DPS\/cost ratio is much worse: ~1 versus about ~0.3. By contrast, for Cybran T1 bot and T2 tank, DPS\/cost is ~0.5 and ~0.3, indicating a reduction of only 40% raw paper strength from T2 to T1. This would suggest that MML raw damage should be doubled so that T2 to improve DPS\/cost to ~0.6, a reduction of ~40% from the ~1 DPS\/cost ratio for T1 artillery.\n  \u2022 T2 TMD and mobile\/stationary shields block MML shots. The previous bullet suggests that MML are underpowered even in absence of missile defense and shields. Missile defense and shields serve to aggravate this problem further.\n  \u2022 T2 MML shot linger time - the time between a missile being launched and a missile hitting the target at maximum range - varied from about 6 seconds (for Seraphim) and 12 seconds (for Aeon). Compare this to T1 artillery shells which linger for about 8 seconds.\n  \u2022 T2 MML damage radius is very small at 1. T1 artillery (other than Aeon) damages in a radius of 2-3.\n\nNow let's talk how to fix these problems:\n\n  \u2022 Low DPS can be fixed by improving raw damage. Raw paper DPS suggests a 100% damage buff is necessary. Analysis of damage radius and shot linger time suggests another 50-100% beyond that would also be warranted. Also, there's no reason why MMLs shouldn't one-shot T1 pgens. The Aeon MML can 1-shot Cybran and Aeon pgens, but all MMLs should get a buff so that the Seraphim MML (405 damage) can one-shot even UEF T1 pgens (720 hp), so perhaps 810 damage total.\n  \u2022 The T2 shield\/TMD combination renders a fire-base all but immune to MMLs. Due consideration should be given to the idea of missiles passing through shields (similar to how strategic missiles do) although this may not be needed if DPS is improved substantially.\n  \u2022 MML linger time cannot be set directly because it is a product of the missile's performance values (muzzle velocity, acceleration, maximum speed) and it's guidance script, but effort should be made to reduce UEF\/Aeon MML shot linger time to <9 seconds, reliably. Also, UEF is the only MML with an unpack animation, this unpack should be made faster to improve the MML's responsiveness.\n  \u2022 If MML raw damage is only doubled, improving damage radius from 1-->2 would make sense. If MML damage is improved by a factor or 2.5x or 3.0x, more damage radius is not necessary.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n  \u2022 It has recently been stated that TMLs are OP. I disagree generally. They only seem OP because they are so much better than MMLs that they are used to siege much more often. If MMLs are made to be good, TMLs versus MMLs will feel like a real choice rather than obvious selection of the superior siege weapon (TMLs currently).\n  \u2022 Adding a minimum range to MMLs to give tanks some breathing room would make sense. Perhaps 10-15, perhaps as high as 20.\n\nMML do thier job and are very effective at breaking shield bases. Literally my only complain is that if you have about 10-15 MML they will just die to 1-2 t2 arty.\n\nT2 arty need a big nerf on fire rate.\n\nI never seen anyone call TML op, maybe that is just me. TML are expensive and a tactical tool that is rarely used because scouting easily counters it. Com TML was called OP , because its harder to scout. Personally I never had a problem with COM TML.\n\n\n@Psions Consider that to \"break\" a walled T1 PD (260 mass), you only need a single T1 artillery (36-54 pass) and about 30-40 seconds. This means T1 siege is effective at 20% mass cost investment.\n\nNow consider a T2 PD + a TMD. For Cybran this costs 480 + 280 = 760. To maintain a similar siege effectiveness, a single MML (200 mass) should beat this in ~30-40 seconds. It does not.\n\nIn a test game, I build a Cybran T2 shield + 2 T2 PD + 2 TMD. This costs 1480. In a gametest, I tested 5 Seraphim MML against this, total 1000 mass, and it took them one minute to destroy this setup. (Actually, the MML couldnt destroy the last T2 PD because they kept missing due to a bug.) This indicates that a much larger investment of MML (proportional to defenses) is required to crack a T2 firebase, and it takes much longer to do it. If MMLs are made more effective, they will defeat T2 firebases before being destroyed my T2 artillery themselves.\n\n\nTML pays itself off with just a single t2 mex kill. In fact you would need to launch 3 more failed TML missiles in order to lose the mass gains you got from the trade.\n\nAnyone that doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s busted purely plays teamgames where 2 TMDs save 4 bases and no one cancers your TMDs.\n\nIn fact if we had a neural AI play faf I\u2019m 100% without a doubt positive that the first thing it would noticeably do is abuse tmls and t1\/t2 bombers on tmds.\n\n\nFTX, you were the main person I had in mind when I made the TML comment. TMLs are certainly good, so there is no need to buff them. The MML buff seems appropriate however, does it not?\n\n\nI like your idea of making TML\/MML go through shields. \"Just put up a shield it'll stop everything\" no longer works, you would now need more TMD and if there are a lot of missiles some could still get through.\n\n\n@John73John I agree. It's an option, but I think a simple damage buff + missile performance improvement (faster and more accurate) is probably a better solution.\n\n\nTerrible logic. T3 mobile arty only has 0,08 dps\/mass ratio, so only about 25% of T2. Do you want to quadruple its damage after your MML buffs (applying the same logic as you did for your MML buff)? Then it would still only have half the effectiveness of your T2 MMLs. Cyb T3 mobile arty would then deal 1800 damage per shot. Only 2 of them (1600 mass cost) would have the same dps as a T3 artillery installation.\n\nJust an example to show that this way of looking at balance is dumb and ignores many other things, like the additional range you get or that you force your enemy to make a building that is more expensive than an MML and is otherwise completely useless.\n\nIn general I think they are pretty good, they outrange T2 PD so can kill them with 0 danger. If your enemy wants to protect them he has to make a shield and\/or build TMDs, so he's technically already losing even if you kill nothing. They are decently fast and can disengage easily. They always hit what you shoot at, unlike artillery. I think they fulfill their role well enough.\n\n\nTMD definitely I would think do not need the buff (Especially any through-shield buffs). I often play with AI, an adaptive AI team only needs 1 TML per player and will always build them almost as a priority. With the amount of AI I play against with its often required to build 5 TMD as a defense on each little fire base. (8 Adaptive, 2 Normal vs 5 players) (depending on your faction's TMD). I do agree MML (possibly TML) AoE buffs are good simply because of that travel time.\nThe Cybran MML: Viper however seems to be OP in it`s splitting capability, taking out any un-shielded TMD over time with even equal, possibly lesser numbers. This combined with the mobile stealth generator unit: Deceiver (also T2) could be deadly.\nI do not know much about stats on the build times of these TMD, TML & MML if you could provide some info on all that too it could help your case.\nI personally have always thought that TMD however needs a highly improved fire rate or the ability to target better (ex. 1 TMD per missle)(Aeon excluded).\n\n\n@FunkOff This is a pointless statement. T2 units should always be less mass efficient than T1 and T3 should always be less efficient than T2 when looking at raw HP and dmg stats.\n\nThis is because you get better dps\/hp density on higher tier units, you need to limit the way it scales.\n\nIf you had linear scaling then as Femto has already mentioned certain units would clear be game breaking.\n\nIf you are playing a wide open map, how many tmD and t2 pd combinations must the enemy make? For 1 MML you are now making him spend the mass for 4-5 TMD?\n\nThis is why on DG Nuke is always netgain 0, because you force 2 SMD which is 15k mass against 15k mass. Which is why its so dominant.\n\n@FtXCommando I don't think TML are that dominant. They cost a lot in initial investment are easily scouted and easily countered. If you're suggesting bombing TMD then i suggest bombing TML. Also you can block TML with a single land fac in construction.\n\nAlso cybran shields are cheap.\n\n\nI've always wanted an increase in MML max missile speed, provides more of an incentive to hold fire to overwhelm TMD (except the aeon one) since the reload speed wouldn't change.\n\n\nI have to agree that MMLs feel a bit weak. Not because their dps is is so bad but because tmd is so effective against them. One tmd can certainly block one mml shooting at it. Except cybran but the missile split is rather a gimmick. and a tmd is only 280 mass vs 200 mass for the mml. I am very sure it is effective to block unsynced mmls with tmd. Synced mmls might be more efficient than tmd. But then you still have to break through a shield. I nearly never use them to break through a fire base. But they are great at stopping pd creeps. 3 MMLs make pd creeping with a t2 acu nearly impossible. For breaking firebases I would rather suggest t3 mobile arty, as it has only shields to fight against and it is more dps\/mass efficient than t2 stationary arty.\n\nBut this discussion is only happening again because people play lame chokepoint maps where building firebases is viable. On more open maps you just can ignore the firebase and destroy your opponents eco and deal with the firebase once you are so far ahead it doesn't even matter anymore.\n\n\nThe problem is MMLs exist solely to break firebases, and TMD exists solely ...

Sprite work and development talk should go in the development forum. Additionally, we already have threads for each Mega Man game and you should be posting in those. Creating a new topics will clutter up the forum and I'd prefer things stay organized.\n\nSecondly, we already have two spriters for the game and they are more than capable of completing the work on their own. In the future we may need more spriters, but for the moment we have everything we need and sprite submissions are closed.\n\nI am moving this to the appropriate category and locking it. I'm sorry for the confusion but Sean and MMX100 work really hard on their sprites and it would not be fair if anyone else could just come in and take their jobs.

It says by Friday, it's Saturday, end of story\n\nSaturday 08\/06\/2013, 20:46\n\nOh no, I am so disappointed Uranus is no longer bannedsmiley. She is seriously overpowered. I think she deserves a ban since similar cards like Jeena and Ulrich are banned.Her ability and Jeena's ability are both stopped by SOA clans, but with her attack manipulation, she can be used as an offensive character in those situations. Like Ulrich, Uranus can have her ability inactivated by SOA cards from non-SOA clans, but since most players only have one such card per hand, a skilled player can usually avoid playing either of these cards against the SOA card. UR, please reconsider banning Uranus again in the future.\n\nI am satisfied, however, with the Mokra, Troompah, and Dorian bans. I don't think Greem deserves a ban since her poison isn't as strong as Karrion's (she has a higher min), and she is in a clan with only one reliable dr, Redra. Oshitsune might be banned again in the future. Oshitsune's ability is very powerful considering most cards are 7 power or less, and his bonus makes him immune to attack manipulation clans. Additionally, he can inflict 7 damage which is a lot. in my opinion, he is Caelus with one less star and a better clan bonus.\n\nSaturday 08\/06\/2013, 21:38\n\nUn ban Elvria\n\nSunday 09\/06\/2013, 07:07\n\n@OC deejay\nPussycats is a great elo clan\n\nSunday 09\/06\/2013, 11:06\n\nI agree with Mokra being banned too soon sentiment. It is a new card, I think you should've left him to be enjoyed and hatet in ELO for a while longer. Pretty much the same wrong decision as with Kalindra... Though Mokra is much more fairer in price department and as such more fairly available to a wide number of players.\n\nThis 2 characters got killed in ELO too soon.\n\nBut oh well, if I can no longer abuse Mokra I will abuse Uranus instead. It's not like I can change them bans.\n\nAlso Rescue cries are coming from players who wanted to enjoy OP'ish Rescue play that's all. Rescue is not dead in ELO and you know it. And Oshitsune is countered by all too many ELO staples in Rescue (Sue, Cliff, Sledg, Kerry, Buckler, Pastor, Slyde) so don't be ridiculous.\n\nSunday 09\/06\/2013, 14:59\n\nThere goes my Montana deck smiley\n\nMonday 10\/06\/2013, 02:35\n\nGertjan??? Really? smh...\n\nMonday 10\/06\/2013, 03:45\n\nMokra is nowhere near kalindra. Mokra is a great card but not like kalindra. Mokra would have seen less and less play as the weeks progressed. Without Uranus he is nothing they have him and average cards. He needs other cards. You cant wait a few rounds and all out fury him like kalindra who required no skill. Maybe its just me but he doesn't bother me too much. I'm not saying he isnt an amazing card but how many rings did lebron get with the cavs?

He only cares about those who are like him, or at least agree with his view upon life. During the arena fights, he stays silent, and keeps a straight face.\n\n    Likes\/Dislikes: He likes long fights, the longer, the more violence. He just, basically, anything that has to do with legal violence. He absolutely hates anyone who has a different opinion then him and talks to him about it. It's not that he doesn't share the other's opinion, he's fine with that, he just doesn't like it when they get in his face about it.\n\n    Appearance: He wears a Gold-studded Tuxedo with a Grand Arena Master's Badge. His pants are Red-Lined Black Pants, he carries a medium-length Diamond-Tipped Staff. He wears a Black Long-Rimmed Hat, with a Gold Feather, and his name signed on it, in case it ever gets lost.\n\n    Strengths\/Weaknesses: Although he rarely ever fights, he knows quite a lot about about Fighting. His majors are in Fist and Sword fighting. His weapon of choice would be a Sharp Samurai Blade, for it is slick and easy to carry, and still is very powerful. His weakness is, although he speaks big, he is somewhat of a coward. A sword fight is fine, just as long as the opponents sword isn't so big it could kill him instantly. So, his slight cowardism is a weakness.\n\n    History: Trelvan was abandoned at birth, his parents, presumably, couldn't handle having a child and left him at an Orphanage. Some Orcs later adopted him, they said they wanted to be different, and not have a Orc Child. His father trained him to be a fierce warrior, and trained him in both Unarmed and Sword combat. His first blade was, obviously, a Samurai Blade. He joined the Silvermoon Army, but later quit since he thought his ways were slow and it wasn't enough action for him. He wanted to kill people without taking a year to plan a strategy. One day, his parents took him on a Trip to Stranglethorn, and he found the Gurubashi Arena, and watched some fights. Then he realized how to fulfill his lust for bloodbath: An Arena. Where people could watch other kill each other and it being legal! Trelvan then ran to the Regent Lord of Silvermoon and requested an Arena be built in Silvermoon. The Lord denied his request, he said it was too violent for their peaceful land. Trelvan then offered to put it near Silvermoon, but not in it, but the Regent Lord, again, denied. Trelvan thought of other places, and then he knew where he should make the Arena. Orgrimmar! They loved war and bloodshed, there would be no chance they would deny his request, and he was right, Garrosh loved the idea and gave him the gold required to build the Arena, full with crew. After a couple months of construction, the Arena was complete, and Trelvan started making posters. The first night was a success, and the night after that, and the night after that. It soon became well-known in Orgrimmar, and they soon expanded into a worldwide business, although mostly staying in Orgrimmar, they had ads in Silvermoon, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, and, of course, Orgrimmar. Trelvan was getting paid to do what he loves, watch people kill themselves over a prize, and he liked it that way.\n    Last edited by The Devious Chicken; 2012-05-11 at 12:22 AM.\n    | Main RP Character:\n    Nidal Shadowdance |\n    | While Forum RP'ing:\n    Italics = What he's doing currently.\n    Non-italics with Quotes = Talking\n    Non-Italics without Quotes = Thinking |\n\n  2. #2\n    Mechagnome Darced's Avatar\n    Join Date\n    Mar 2012\n    Just noticed this, a 34 year old blood elf is VERY young; he should be much older. (Check out wowpedia for adult ages fro races.) Also, you may want to add some more interests than just fighting, maybe a profession, this will make your arena master a much more interesting character. He needs some dimension, don't make him cut and dry. I look forward to seeing his history. A final note, your signature is rude and makes me sad, I like people recognizing me talking :P\n\n  3. #3\n    Role-player Khorianas's Avatar\n    Join Date\n    Nov 2010\n    The Hall of Blood\n    Well I think the (Human Years) suggest he means mature as an 35 years old human. That would put him somewhere between 180-200 years I think.\n    Not really much more to say, without a full history really. The character has potential, if you give him a well flehed out and detailed background.\n\n  4. #4\n    I, too, can see a lot of potential for this character. Especially being an Arena Master, that means he'd have a hard, bloody background (something like Varian Wrynn\/Lo'Gosh) which could possibly be very interesting indeed.\n    I, for one, look forward to seeing what this character's history evolves in to.\n    Pyromaniac prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nPosting Permissions\n\n  \u2022 You may not post new threads\n  \u2022 You may not post replies\n  \u2022 You may not post attachments\n  \u2022 You may not edit your posts",

Never thought of telepathy though...\n10:30 pm | January 17, 2003\nWhoops, it didn't put the sings in the comment. I was talking about the triangle sings that i use in place of quotes in my fanfic when the Forerunner talk.\n10:30 pm | January 17, 2003\nOh yeah, when these sings: are around a text, it means the character is speaking telepatheticly. You shoudl know that.\n10:25 pm | January 17, 2003\nFrom what i have read so far very good. I like how you decided to make a compainion to the HALO story like i decided to make a prequel to fall of Reach. Most people prefer HALO sequels but we both had good ideas.\n12:44 pm | January 11, 2003\nThanx for input. If you think that's long though you should read my first story I've written. It's 345 pages in size 12 font! Continue input and reading what I send in. Thanks again.\n7:39 am | January 4, 2003\nI liked it. Good detail and development of characters. It was a little long, but that's not entirely a bad thing.\n3:02 am | January 4, 2003\nThanks for the feedback, but I on purposely did what I did. HALO:Missing In Action is supposed to be a side story. Heck a story that doesn't involve any of the main characters at all. That was my point. To make a Halo story through the eyes of some lost and confused soldiers on the terrain oh Halo. Oh yeah on your people would rather play the story than re-read it you are wrong. Re-reading it isn't so bad if you are bored or want a different view on things like I have done.\n1:41 am | December 18, 2002\nMaybe a more catchy title would help. Um not bad, not completely original either, but well written.\n\n\"Excuse me sir,\" Roberts asked,\" but what is a SPARTAN?\"\n\n\"Why the most elite soldier the U.N.S.C. has. They wear some sort of green armored suit. I believe they have shields or something like that integrated into the suit. They are the one thing you want to see in a bad situation. They are our super soldiers.\"\n\nThis here was a little weak regarding dialogue and fyi \"REACH\" isnt an acronym. But i like ur diction overall, mostly in the prologue. only suggestion: if ur going to follow the game storyline for even an instant, better throuw in ur own touch too. ppl would rather play the storyline than reread it.",

Would like to see Nathan Fillion.\n\n    Now who's going to do the female celeb Shepards? And maybe some characters from other games, lol.\n\n    I wonder if the characters in ME were made using the generator. probably not... maybe, though.\n\n    Posted: April 6, 2010 5:15 AM\n  \u2022 Flight_Eagle\n\n    That Barack was... pretty good. Vin Diesel was pretty good too. Eddie Murphey was just great... When Christian Bale looked down i saw it, and it made me fall. Unexpected Putin! That was good.\n\n    Buuuuut... That Bruce wasn't thaaat good. It was cool that they went for the Fifth Element one, though. I think i made a better S.L. Jackson. and i think i can make a better Ewan McGregor. Stallone made me LOL.
