It\u2019s a project made to highlight the Halo community over the last 10 years since Halo hit the streets and brought us all together through the magic of gaming. FinalPOSTMORTEM and Slightly Live join us to talk about their project and what their goals are. Enjoy\n\nThis entry was posted in Media, Podtacular and tagged , , , , , , .

        "text":"Apology from Mike Morhaime\n\nGeneral Discussion\nPrev 1 4 5 6 27 Next\nI am not involved in any of the blizzcon event, but from seeing the forums, this post was the right move instead of the post the band made earlier.\n\nFrom that earlier post, the band noted that everything was meant to be fun. While it might have been okay for some people, for others, it clearly indicated that blizzard as a company was acting completely different than the promises to provide an enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nI am glad that the president himself did something like this, Kudos to you, Mr Morhaime. It makes me proud to be your customer. But I do hope that you folks at Blizzard learnt something from this lesson and not repeat it in the future.\nThanks, Bashiok! Or Mike, as it may be.\nThank you for the apology. We all make mistakes, and from them we learn. I am glad to hear that Blizzard was not dismissive of how the LGBT community in the game felt about the video.\n\nTogether in this all of us can move forward.\nThe apology was fine. In fact, the first apology was fine IMO, but whatever. Let's move on.\n\n<moving on...>\n\nSee,, said it wouldn't be enough.\n\nYou still have people not accepting the apology and demanding for people to get fired.\n\nSome will be upset that the wind was knocked out of their sails. They are the ones who want to be upset. Best to just ignore them and they will eventually deflate completely.\nPardon my skepticism, but I find it difficult to shrug off an intolerant tirade as an \"error in judgement\". That's a cop out. NOT dropping slurs such as those used the offending video is standard practice in any business in this country, and how any of you, presumed paragons of the video game industry, were stupid enough to let this happen is completely beyond me. Presumably there are rules which prohibit such language between Blizzard employees. Apparently, extending the same courtesy to your customer base is not a priority.\n\nFurthermore, I think it prudent to point out that were Sam Didier working in any other position at any other company in the world, he would have been fired in a heartbeat. I could only imagine the swift dismissal any one of us would receive were we to be seen next some homunculus putz who brazenly insults the greater portion of our employers' customers.\n\nI'm not demanding anyone's job, but this is a template, soulless, corporate apology if I've ever read one in my life.\n\nToo bad you don't work for blizzard, with all of your insight and wisdom.\n\nSeriously, people who actually took the corpsegrinder interview seriously need to stop playing games, and go read some books.\nIt's good to see an apology going out and I'm thankful for it. As I said elsewhere, part of what makes playing Horde fun is the whole \"Blood & Honor\" thing, and that incident simply lacked honor. Like honor on the field of battle, when you defeat your enemy you don't follow it up by t-bagging them. Leave that to those immature Halo players. ;)\nWell spoken, Mr. Morhaime.\nI do not wish to see anyone fired but learn to behave as a proper employee of a company when infront of the public\/customers.\n\nPeople are human and make mistakes but they need to learn from them.\nI accept your apology\n\ntwice now!\nAnyone who doesn't understand why it was offensive doesn't deserve to have it explained to them. Do you really not see how being gay, and then seeing someone use \"gay\" as an ugly insult to someone, is hurtful? If you're genuinely that unable to empathize with other human beings, you probably shouldn't be playing a multiplayer online game to begin with.\n\nMr. Morhaime, your apology is just what was needed and is accepted wholeheartedly at least by me. It's nice to see anybody in this day and age, especially a large company, actually say \"we messed up and we're sorry\" as opposed to the \"we're sorry you were offended\" most people hand out.\nI wasn't terribly offended by the video, but I greatly appreciate the apology from the big man of Blizzard himself.\n\nApology accepted, Mike. Now let's put this behind us and get to work on making the best WoW expansion ever.\n\nI'll be waiting for my Annual Pass beta key.\n\nThis isn't about being vindictive or petty. This is how you run a business. Employees that commit equal opportunity offenses either require retraining and\/or demotion or even termination. You don't just get off calling customers slurs, even via proxy.The fact that no one stopped and took a look at the video before it was shown implies negligence at a high level.\n\nThat being said. I know when enough is enough.\n\nThank you Mike.\nDid he say \"People that play alliance\" anywhere? No. He didn't. But everyone wanted to pretend like he did. But yeah. Enough is enough. Now you can go tell everyone how right you were, and this whole lame thing can be forgotten about like it should have the second it was done.\n\nNobody likes to be misunderstood. And maybe one day, you'll see that. And how wrong it is.\n\nForgive earnestly and whole heartedly, but never forget.\n10\/27\/2011 07:37 PMPosted by Lemuria\nI was thinking more of termination or at the very least demotion. Having someone like this run the name of your company through dirt is not good for business\n\nApology accepted Lord of the WoW but in return I must request that we Alliance have a special quest to slay and behead an npc named after Corpsegrinder (That or spawn the Lich King on him every time he logs on WoW).\nThank you.\n\nJoin the Conversation\n\nReturn to Forum",

So far I have solved 44 puzzles, and I have plotted a graph of the points awarded vs. seconds to solve. My main conclusion from examining this graph is that there are several categories for difficulty. I am not quite sure how many, but I think there are at least five. For each category, the points awarded is based on the following formula:\n\npoints awarded = A \u2013 S * B,\n\n\nA is a point value constant that depends on the difficulty category,\n\nB is a points per point constant (which is about 1\/6), and which may or may not depend on the category,\n\nand S is the number of seconds taken to solve.\n\nWhat remains a complete mystery to me is how a category is assigned to an individual puzzle. Can anyone please help me figure this out?\n\nLast edited by BuzzBuzz : 02-12-2013 at 08:14 PM.\nReply With Quote\nOld 02-12-2013, 08:33 PM\ngryhnd51's Avatar\ngryhnd51 gryhnd51 is online now\nSenior Member\nJoin Date: Feb 2008\nPosts: 247\n\nThere are several great forums devoted to scoring, but basically there are THREE levels of solving difficulty: Easy, Average, and Difficult. If you look at your \"recent games\" you will see this. Each of the levels has an assigned point value but the number of points awarded is also based on the time it takes you to solve it.\nReply With Quote\nOld 02-13-2013, 12:16 AM\nfishbum fishbum is offline\nSenior Member\nJoin Date: Feb 2011\nPosts: 106\n\nI have been lead to believe that the 'difficulty' scale is based on the number of words.

Bryantom\n\n    Bryantom New Member\n\n    I see the ability to make manasteel tools and weapons using tinkers construct, but when I put manasteel ingots into the smeltery, it does not melt. How do I make the pieces to construct these items? We're running Infinity.\n\n  2. Football6078\n\n    Football6078 New Member\n\n    I would assume it's the same as thaumium, so you craft pieces in the part builder with stencils.\n    malicious_bloke and Padfoote like this.\n  3. Bryantom\n\n    Bryantom New Member\n\n    That worked! Thank you.\n\n  4. Azzanine\n\n    Azzanine New Member\n\n    What benefits do manasteel parts give I wonder. Is TiC clever enough to make the tool have that mana repair feature or is it just gonna be like thaumium and be slightly different version of writable.\n\n    Sent from my GT-I9100 using Tapatalk\n  5. Padfoote\n\n    Padfoote Brick Thrower Team Member Forum Moderator\n\n    As far as I can tell (haven't put it on any tools yet) it's just a different coloured Thaumium without the writable bit.\n  6. Azzanine\n\n    Azzanine New Member\n\n    That kind of sound like it's not like Thaumium at all lol. Sounds like a hastily added metal. Is this vanilla TiCo or ExtTiC?\n\n    Sent from my GT-I9100 using Tapatalk\n  7. Padfoote\n\n    Padfoote Brick Thrower Team Member Forum Moderator\n\n    Well, alike enough in the fact that it's a metal that doesn't get melted down to be made into a part. :p\n\n  8.
