Wildfox tells a story of Emily and Kimberley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s generation and friendship, grabbing inspiration from their countless sleepovers, books, dreams, fairies and many other aspects from their childhood.\n\nIn 2007, the brand was officially established in Los Angeles along with world-renowned saxophonist Jimmy Sommers as CEO and President of Wildfox. With the help of Sommers, Wildfox has propelled into a highly recognizable brand through cultivating both a strong celebrity following and visibility in fashion press. With much success, Sommers has been able to break into a highly competitive market and quickly bring Wildfox to the pulse of fashion with their tees, sweats, tops, sunglasses and more.\n\nKnown for ultra soft fabrics and unique designs, Wildfox has developed into a full range of tops, bottoms, scarves and socks, denim and dresses. As of 2012, the brand has launched Wildfox Sun and Intimates. For a second season, Wildfox Swim launched in 2013. In 2012, Wildfox released a jewelry line, limited edition Daydream T collection and collaboration the popular shoe brand Jeffrey Campbell. Wildfox has even branched into the kids market, with their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153little sister\u00e2\u20ac\u009d adaptation of the womens line in 2009.\n\nWildfox has been featured on magazine covers such as Glamour and in articles in Cosmopolitan, Seventeen, InStyle, WWD, People, Us Weekly, etc. Not only does this brand get the attention of top magazines, but countless numbers of celebrities ranging from Beyonce to Victoria Beckham to Ashley Tisdale.\n\nYou can shop Wildfox clothing and accessories at high-end boutiques including Kitson and Neiman Marcus nationwide along with select department stores like Bloomingdale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom. Wildfox is distributed in over 30 different countries.\n\nAs perfectly stated on the Wildfox website, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wildfox is for the dreamers, for the lovers, for skinny dippers, for barefoot explorers, for late night chocolate eaters; it is for people everywhere who believe in love and believe in themselves.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
