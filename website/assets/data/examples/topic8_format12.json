        "text":"Lee 101\n\nAbout Lee 101\n\nQuality denim brands are hard to come by, especially ones that cater to all styles, textures and fits. That\u2019s probably why Lee 101 is seen as the selvedge dream when it comes to denim, and its perfect collection of simplistic, high quality men\u2019s clothing is popular all over the world. Throughout Lee\u2019s history the brand has designed many key features that are still used to this day, and has had a great influence over things such as work wear clothes and the overall quality of denim production.\u00a0\n\n\nHistory of Lee 101\n\nHenry David Lee is the name behind this iconic denim brand, but he didn\u2019t start off intending to branch into fashion. Originally making a name for himself as a wholesale grocery distributor, and setting up his own storage company for perishable items, Lee soon became frustrated with the quality and delivery of workwear uniforms for his workers, and decided he\u2019d do the job himself, opening up a new company to create overalls and jackets. Leaping to success with the Union-All work jumpsuit, Lee soon moved onto the more versatile denim jeans. For added convenience, Lee introduced the zipper fly, which revolutionised jean production, and made the brand the top manufacturer of workwear. It wasn\u2019t however until the 1950s the Lee 101 took the leap into commercial wear, and soon gained huge success with their range of styles and quality denim. They now sell worldwide and have a unbeaten range of fits and finishes, ensuring that their high quality clothing suits everyone.\u00a0\n\n\nProducts from Lee 101\u00a0\n\nLee 101 has perfected the understated, high quality clothes that go with everything, are hardwearing and are effortlessly comfortable. Combining classic workwear styles with modern influences, Lee 101\u2019s clothing line offers everything from neutral t-shirts and every kind of jean style you could ask for, to western shirts and comfortable jumpers and sweatshirts. With each piece able to easily match with another, Lee 101 creates clothing that is effortlessly stylish and with a classic masculine twist.\u00a0\n\nThis site uses cookies.

The label is run by me, Sandro Marzo (Design), Flavio Cr\u00fczer (Business Development), Pete Dominkovits (Art Direction), Marius von Holleben (Communications) and Lionel Sch\u00fcpbach (Legal).\n\nPicture 0c663e05 53e0 4563 8f9c b265d2bf9b7fPicture 40610c98 cdfb 4466 88ab 4ec90084ed4dPicture 66d67c87 e0bb 4abe bb3d 49cd62c26eb7Picture 703eb85c 6360 4e86 8484 19a250bd5921Picture ad8b76a6 8230 4ee9 9f85 155ff51e884ePicture 81631a68 7a84 4f07 8875 7cbfc97a28eb\n\nA real passion\n\nSince more than three years we dedicate every spare minute to making sandro marzo a success \u2013 and that does not mean to make big money but to be able to create and produce beautiful and authentic clothes together with our Swiss and EU-based manufactories. Clothes that are made out of 100% natural materials and can be worn both by men and women.\n\nPicture ac1d813d 2bc5 4095 903a 8cf1077427e9Picture 8f4a2193 cb4d 4d19 9971 60e8ce19746cPicture 5138b25d 11f3 47e5 908d 15614cbed783Picture efa89acc 5258 4596 97d7 543e82e50230\n\nHow it started\n\nIn 2011, after graduating from HGK Basel I decided to put everything I got into my own label. During my studies I did an internship for the then-breaking designer Boris Bidjan Saberi in Barcelona and learned a lot about how to run a business. Right from the beginning we were focusing on the particularity of traditional textiles and craftsmanship and managed to produce our first collection entirely in Switzerland. Today, three years later we are still here.\n\nWhy support us?\n\nToday we stand at a crucial point. After three successful collections we finally attracted the interest of many people and managed to establish ourselves as a newcomer. Now, we have the chance to take the next step. But we need your support in order to do that and to produce our next, the fourth collection \u2013 Spring\/ Summer 2015. By backing our project you will enable us to continue working on what we believe most in.\n\nWhat will happen with the money\n\nThe collection will contain approximately 40 single pieces from T-shirts, long-sleeve shirts, knitwear pullovers, jackets to short pants, long Pants and even shoes.\n\nThe money will be used entirely to realize this collection. Basically it will pay for:\n\n  \u2022 all textiles, garments, buttons and other used materials\n  \u2022 the shipping of textiles to the manufactures (incl. custom fees)\n  \u2022 the production of the prototypes\n  \u2022 the production of the actual clothes\n  \u2022 the shipping of the clothes back to us (incl. custom fees)\n\nWhat do you get out of this\n\nMany people supported us so far but now we need your help to take the next step and produce the Spring\/ Summer Collection 2015. In exchange for your support you can receive various rewards.\n\nFirst of all you can get great discounts (25% and 50%) on direct orders for the SS15 collection. Here you order directly via us and the items will shipped to you in January 2015.\n\nBut there are also many nice original pieces from the last two collections, a strictly limited & signed fanzine, exclusive accessoires and some special individual invitations to the presentation of the collection in Paris waiting for you.\n\nWe thank you for every support!\n\nFor more information about sandro marzo please click here or read this article (German) or this one (English).

Thirty years of century of experimentation and evolution have led Pierre Poisson to touch several facets of the profession; sometimes designer, sometimes cutter, patternmaker, costumer, entrepreneur, merchant or craftsman.\n\nOver the past ten years, adding to his production of regular size, Pierre Poisson has been working to give plus size women original and good quality clothing. The clientele enjoys the chic and comfort of the creations. The brand Poisson is also distinctive by the selection and use of materials and original embroidery rarely offered to plus-size customers. Pierre Poisson shirts and jackets have that much-appreciated French look; turn up the collar, flip the cuffs and voila!\n\nThe products of Pierre Poisson are handcrafted in Montreal: fabrics are individually cut and sewn from start to finish by the same dressmaker. The buttons are sewn by hand and pressing is carefully executed. A true artisan approach.\n\nOver the years, Pierre Poisson has won several regional awards, in Canada and abroad, including the 1989 Woolmark Awards (Toronto). He was also a finalist at the 1987 Japan Fashion Design Contest (Tokyo).\n\nSince few seasons, Pierre Poisson is offering more regular size style and also a new line of fabrics accessories such as scarfs, fabrics bags, hats and sleepers made with the left over fabrics from his main production. For more then 10 years now, Mr. Poisson has been meeting his customers directly at high hand craft shows in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec city, those opportunities enhance the understanding of the challenges encountered by plus-size women and their way of dressing.\n\nThe entire Poisson Design team thank you your interest, and wish to develop a simple, sustainable and friendly relationship with you.\n\nPierre Poisson\n\nPierre Poisson",
