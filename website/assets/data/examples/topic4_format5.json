        "text":"FAQ Salary Checks\n\nRelated pages\n\nActual wages & Salary Check\n\nHow are the actual wages of low-, medium-, high-skilled workers arrived at?\n\nReported monthly earnings of workers in low-, medium-, and high-skilled occupations are obtained from the WageIndicator voluntary web surveys of 2014 and 2015. The definition of groups follows the one-digit ISCO-classification of occupations where ISCO 1-2 are clustered into high-skilled, ISCO 3-8 into medium-skilled and ISCO 9 into low-skilled groups. The minimum and maximum values represent the 25th and 50th percentiles of the wage distribution per occupation. WageIndicator prefers to offer this wage range instead of just one figure, which is usually the 40th percentile, since a range reflects the real situation better.\n\nHow does WageIndicator collect the data for the actual salary indications?\n\nWageIndicator collects data by means of a voluntary web-based survey available at national WageIndicator sites. The WageIndicator questionnaire is offered (in 2015) in 46 languages and is operational in 84 countries. The survey questionnaire is similar to those used by statistical agencies for standard labor force surveys, it is user-friendly and consists of multiple-choice questions only. The collected data is anonymized and subject to strict security measures, safeguarding the privacy of the participating individual. In 30 countries with less strong internet WageIndicator also collects salary data on the basis of face-to-face surveys. This data is used for salary indications as well.\n\nIs the wage information reliable?\n\nThe wage information used for the calculation of Salary Checks and as presented in Wages in Context is based on voluntarily submitted data. Therefore 100% accuracy cannot and will not be guaranteed. WageIndicator encourages its respondents to provide accurate and precise information about their personal and employment characteristics, pointing out that they provide their professional peers with an improving Salary Check-tool, \u00a0which they themselves profit from as well. And all along WageIndicator guarantees their anonymity. The Salary Check is updated twice a year. Wages in Context is updated four times a year. Through increasing participation in the Salary Surveys results improve so that they provide the most timely, accurate and actual wage information. In addition, before calculation the dataset is cleaned and compared to other relevant datasets applying universally accepted statistical methods. In this way WageIndicator eliminates from its datasets most non-trustworthy cases, such as for example extremely high or low hourly wages, and highly unlikely combinations such as starters boasting of astronomical earnings etc.\n\nWhat is an occupation? And what is an occupation group?\n\nWageIndicator recognizes more than 1700 different occupations. Its classification of occupations is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) provided by the International Labour Organization (ILO). WageIndicator follows the latest classification ISCO-08 released in March 2008, amending it whenever a more detailed classification is necessary. ISCO-08 classification is a tool for organizing jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken on the job. ILO classifies occupations into smaller and larger occupation groups (either 4-digit, 3-digit, 2-digit or 1-digit ISCO code). The smallest occupation groups are referenced with a 4-digit ISCO-08 code. At the top level occupations are clustered into 10 major occupation groups described by the 1-digit ISCO-08 code. For example the occupation group Professionals includes the occupations: Biotechnologist, Aircraft engineer, Translator, University professor in social sciences, etc. Each of these occupations is then broken down into more narrowly defined ones, e.g. University professor in social sciences, into sociologist, politologist, and the like. In addition to these ILO-defined groups WageIndicator defines exact occupations with 13-digit ISCO-08 codes, in such a way that the first 1,2,3 or 4 digits of the 13-digit ISCO-08 occupation code exactly match the ILO-defined occupation groups under which a certain occupation falls.\n\nHow many observations suffice for a reliable estimate?\n\nOn the country level experience suggests that a minimum of 2000 observations is necessary to get reliable estimates to base the first Salary Checks on for a limited number of occupation groups. We provide such wage estimates only when at least two conditions are met: first a minimum of 10 observations and second, these observations must be statistically reliable. WageIndicator uses modern statistical methods to test whether the estimates are statistically meaningful and sufficient to base the wage profiles in a particular country on. This practice means that all estimates are based on 10 observations or more, which are found to be statistically reliable. Ideally there should be enough reliable observations - 10 minimum - for each of the 1700 exact (13-digit ISCO-08 code) occupations. However, if there are already some but not yet 10 observations for a particular occupation, it may be grouped on a higher level of aggregation in accordance with the ISCO-system: i.e. from the 4-digit up to the 1-digit ISCO-08 code, to the level where the two conditions of minimum 10 observations and reliability are fulfilled. However, one should keep in mind that even though statistically tested, all salary indications are always estimates and therefore include an element of uncertainty.\n\nHow does data in a Salary Check differ from official national data?\n\nFrom the experience gathered since the year 2000 it appears that WageIndicator data are comparable in quality with those from other surveys. However, they offer the additional advantage of becoming available more timely. WageIndicator data are on a half year basis used to calculate and update the online Salary Checks which reflect actual earnings in hundreds of occupations in all countries where WageIndicator has operations. The survey itself is versatile and detailed. Its results can be used to monitor and address significant developments in the labour market as they emerge. However, the survey is not based on a representative sample of the labour force, and therefore no conclusions can be drawn regarding the working population as a whole. In some countries groups in certain wage brackets, or of a certain age, may not visit the Internet as frequently as other groups. This accounts especially for those with very high pay and equally for those who are paid very low. Yet, WageIndicator data is proven to be highly apt for research into the income situation of specific occupational groups in the labor market.\n\nHow often are the Salary Check and wages in context updated?\n\nAll WageIndicator Salary Checks are updated at least twice a year. The Salary Check is updated more frequently in countries with high inflation rates. \u00a0Wages in Context is updated four times a year.\n\nWhat happens with outdated data?\n\nWageIndicator securely stores its data. The presented indicators are always the latest, having replaced the older batch, based either on fresh data, or by indexing data for which no new input is available. The calculation of Salary Checks is based on uninterrupted series of data collected during the last five years.\n\nIs the wage information in the Salary Check and Wages in Context controlled for inflation?\n\nAs the he calculation of the Salary Check is based on data collected from the last five years, it adjusts the wage information for the annual inflation rate using the Consumer Price Index of the IMF database. \u00a0If some latest available Wages in Context figure (apart from living wage) is older than 12 months, it is always adjusted for inflation. The living wage is always based on only recent prices data (the last 12 months), there is no need to adjust these prices for inflation if the inflation rate is close to the international average. However, in countries with an exceptionally high inflation rate the inflation adjustment of all living wage estimates, Wages in Context and Salary Check wage estimates are performed on a quarterly basis.\n\nWhich period do the data for the Salary Check cover?\n\nFive years.\n\nAre overtime and bonuses included?\n\nWageIndicator adjusts calculations for hours worked. Bonuses are not included in the calculation of salaries.\n\nWhat about the difference between gross and net wages?\n\nThe Salary Checks are calculated based on the gross hourly wage rate, computed from gross earnings and the number of hours worked. However, in some countries the proportion of respondents who report only their net earnings is significant. In these cases other statistical techniques are applied to impute the gross earnings.\n\nWhy are questions about personal characteristics included in the survey?\n\nPersonal characteristics significantly affect the wages individuals earn. Therefore, knowing these characteristics is essential for the calculation of the statistical rules that assign wages to any occupation and worker\u2019s profile. In fact, these state-of-the-art statistical methods allow WageIndicator to predict wages even for workers\u2018 profiles which are not present in its data. For example, these techniques allow to predict the wage of a plumber of 33, even if no plumber aged 33 shared his data by completing and submitting the survey.\n\nWhy is gender important for wages?\n\nResearch shows time and again that men and women earn different wages. While some part of the observed differences can be explained by differences in individual characteristics, such as tenure, another part cannot be explained in this way. The aim of WageIndicator is to provide the most reliable wage information for any specific occupation and worker\u2019s profile. By providing reliable information about empirically observed gender pay differentials WageIndicator contributes to a more transparent and - possibly- equitab... (truncated)",

        "text":"Workshop FAQ\n\nHow did the Free Minds writing workshops get started?\n\nFree Minds began offering writing workshops in\u00a0Fall 2011\u00a0after\u00a0a volunteer with experience leading and studying community writing groups suggested it. We have modeled\u00a0the curriculum for our\u00a0workshops on the best practices of a well-established\u00a0organization called Write Around Portland, which offers 10 different writing workshops per year, serving roughly 500 people.\n\nThese\u00a0workshops\u00a0align well with our mission, allowing us\u00a0to offer educational experiences to those who would not otherwise have opportunities to explore their intellectual potential. By offering short-term, lower commitment opportunities to community members, we can extend the reach of Free Minds to those who\u00a0are\u00a0unable to commit to the two semester Free Minds class.\n\n\nWhat happens in a typical workshop?\n\nEach workshop is led by a volunteer facilitator who is\u00a0both a guide\u00a0and a participant in the workshop. The facilitator is not so much a\u00a0traditional teacher or writing expert; instead the facilitator\u2019s primary role is to lead discussions and\u00a0writing exercises, and to model effective feedback.\n\nDuring the two hours of the writing workshop, participants generate new writing, primarily through a series of free writes. (To learn more about free writing, check out our Write Now page.) Traditionally participants begin each workshop by choosing between two writing prompts and responding to that prompt.\n\nBecause a key goal of our workshops is community building, writers are given the opportunity to share their work on a voluntary basis and to receive guided feedback from the group. Through the process of sharing and hearing each others\u2019 work, participants move from responding with \u201cI liked it,\u201d to more specific feedback about what is effective in one another\u2019s writing and why.\n\n\nWhen and where do the workshops happen?\n\nSince the workshops began in Fall 2011, we have typically held one session per academic semester: one in Fall, one in Spring, and one in Summer. During the eight weeks of the workshop, the group meets once a week for two hours in the evening.\n\nIn the past, we have held writing workshops at Foundation Communities sites, such as the Sierra Vista Apartments in South Austin, the Trails at Vintage Creek in North Austin, as well as at the Community Engagement Center on East 11th Street.\n\nWe are continually looking for ways to expand the reach of these workshops. If you are a member of an organization that is interested in hosting a Free Minds Writing Workshop, call or email the Free Minds office.\n\n\nWho is eligible for the workshops?\n\nFree Minds Writing Workshops are open to all adults who want to improve their writing and who are able to commit to attending workshop sessions once a week for eight weeks.\n\n\nHow do I sign up?\n\nCall our office at 512-610-7961 or email if you are interested in signing up for the next workshop or if you would like more information. You do not need any special experience or expertise to participate, and our workshops have served advanced and beginning writers alike. We cap each workshop at fifteen participants and folks are signed up on a first come, first served basis. Please ensure that you\u2019re able to attend the majority of workshop sessions before registering in order to respect the time of Free Minds volunteers and fellow workshop participants.\n\n\nUpcoming Workshops\n\nRegistration has passed for our spring 2019 workshop. Stay tuned for details about our upcoming workshops.\n\n\nI am interested in facilitating a Free Minds Writing Workshop. How do I get started?\n\nIn the past, workshops have been led by Free Minds volunteers and staff members. We ask that volunteers who wish to lead a future workshop begin by participating in one of our workshops. Contact us if you are interested in this opportunity.",

Students that emphasize their ROTC enrollment are generally viewed favorably by employers based on their competitive leadership and managerial abilities, maturity, and time management skills.\n\nAre there requirements for haircuts or uniforms?\n\nArmy standards for grooming apply. Cadets are required to be well-groomed; hair off your ears and not down your shoulders. Cadets are required to wear the uniform during class times and training. The uniform is required to be worn in accordance with Army standards.\n\nHow does ROTC handle harassment?\n\nHarassment is not tolerated in any form. We emphasize proper decorum, respect, military courtesies, ethics and standards of conduct.\n\nWhat if I only want to enroll in ROTC for a year or two?\n\nArmy ROTC will:\n\n  \u2022 Give you better leadership, ethics, personal confidence, and managerial skills applicable to any field.\n  \u2022 Provide you a lot of personal attention, encouraging you to get good grades and further mature. Class sizes are small and everyone is given personal counseling.\n  \u2022 Compel you to stay in shape and improve your physical fitness. Yes, there are some progressive physical fitness requirements and you cannot be overweight and complete the program.\n  \u2022 We give you the opportunity to learn what the military is all about these days - the role of the Army and its soldiers, (strategy, politics, technology, standards, career fields, etc.)\n  \u2022 We provide additional fun and learning activities, and opportunities for you to make more friends than virtually any other organization on campus. Cadets consistently relate that one of the best aspects of the ROTC program is the camaraderie students find among each other -that is what Esprit de Corps or belonging is all about.\n\nCan I be enrolled in ROTC if I attend UAFS, NWACC, OR JBU?\n\nYes. The University of Arkansas is the Host College to UAFS, NWACC, and JBU. If you attend NWACC, you will be enrolled into the first two years of the program through the NWACC Registrar\u2019s office. On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, you will come to the University of Arkansas Fayetteville campus and attend classes with the rest of the ROTC cadets. After the completion of the MSI and MSII classes, you can then transfer to the University of Arkansas and complete the last two years of the program. If you are a JBU student, you will register for the classes through the Registrar\u2019s office and come to the Fayetteville campus on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. JBU students will not have to transfer after completion of the MSI and MSII class due to the fact that JBU is a four-year college. UAFS students will register for the classes through the UAFS Registrar\u2019s office and attend classes on the UAFS campus. Please see the Army ROTC Advisor for more information on taking the class on the UAFS campus.\n\nIs there an age limit for starting or finishing the Army ROTC program?\n\nYes. To begin the program, you must be at least 17 years old. To be eligible for a scholarship, a cadet must be under 31 years old in the calendar year in which he\/she is commissioning. For example, an applicant will be 30 years old when he is supposed to commission in May of 2022, but because he turns 31 in November of that same year, he is ineligible for scholarship benefits. The age limit for scholarship cadets is determined by law and is non-waiver able. However, if a student decides to participate in the program without a scholarship, he\/she can apply to have the age limit waived to age of up to 39 years old at the time of commissioning.",

A combination that DECS find very effective.\n\n  \u2022 Notwithstanding what is stated above, DECS T&C (Terms & Conditions) assures the applicants of a study abroad opportunity.\n\n  \u2022 Most of the developed nation have focused on impart of education in both academic and professional manner.

USA has been associated with Law (Harvard), Management (Sloan & Harvard) and Engineering (MIT) etc.\n\n  \u2022 DECS still believes, that apart, many universities have been hidden jewels in a crown since they were not marketed properly and hence researches these jewels constantly, to recommend the best to an applicant, based on merit of each case.\n\n  \u2022 DECS process includes collating applicant\u2019s data in a database and process the same with our learning curve, and matching them with requirements of Universities in the global domain, and then recommend at least 3 kinds (Ambitious, Safe & Moderate) of Universities, where the applicant should apply.\n\n  \u2022 The process also includes capturing the choice of the applicant and recommend the probability of obtaining admission into these Universities\/Colleges.\n\n  \u2022 DECS will render support to the applicant in filing application to the shortlisted institutions.\n\n  \u2022 DECS will also hand hold the applicant for filing visa, providing comfort to the individual.\n\n  \u2022 DECS will charge fees for the services rendered to the applicants at various stages of consultancy offered.

        "text":"There are lots of possibilities to do research training (internships) at home and abroad. Many industrial companies and sometimes also research institutes and universities offer internships.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nSome companies even offer permanent placements such as Unilever research laboratories Vlaardingen and subsidiary companies as Croklaan Wormerveer or IGLO-OLA Hellendoorn. Other placements are available at MARS (Veghel or Slough, GB), Sara Lee (Douwe Egberts, Utrecht), DSM Food Specialties Delft, Purac Gorinchem, AVEBE Foxhol, Johma Salads Losser, Silvo Food Ingredients Papendrecht. Quest offers placements in Naarden and Merseyside (GB) or Cork (Ireland) as well. These are few examples of possibilities. Internships abroad are often located at universities, however also industrial companies offer trainee ships, e.g. Nestle (Switzerland), Givaudan Roure (Switzerland) of Heinz Company (Pittsburgh US). In other continents as Australia, New Zealand and the US or Canada often universities offer possibilities for Wageningen Food Science students. It is also possible to find placements in former Eastern European countries, in Africa or South America.\n\nInternship coordinator\n\nFor the precise addresses contact your internship coordinator: Jenneke Heising.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n  \u2022 What is the minimal duration of an internship period?\n    A duration of minimal 24 ECTS (= 4 month\u2019s) is compulsory. The internship period is scheduled in the 2nd year of the Master.\n  \u2022 Is it allowed to take more than 24 ECTS of internships during the studies?\n    Yes, but it depends on the available time.\n  \u2022 Does the Wageningen University organise the internships?\n    No, you have to contact other universities\/institutes\/industries by yourself. An internship coordinator will help you to find the right placements.\n  \u2022 How do I organise an internship?\n    Contact your internship coordinator. Please, think about what you want (at home or abroad; duration; industry or not; subject). Internet and scientific literature can help you in finding placements too.\n  \u2022 Is it preferable to do a MSc thesis first and after that an internship?\n    It depends on the situation. After doing an MSc thesis first, you will have more profits from the internship period, because of a certain experience and. However, it may be happen that a fantastic internship subject is available in a fantastic city and environment, then you should do that first. Usually students choose for doing the MSc thesis first.\n  \u2022 How much time I need for organising an internship?\n    As a directive you should start 4-6 months ahead. Generally, you need more time as the internship placement is far away (e.g. in another continent). If you are planning to move to another continent and especially if you need visa, it is advisable to start 6 months ahead. Internships at home can be organised in a relative shorter time.\n  \u2022 How do I contact a possible placement?\n    The best way is to use email. Include always a CV and motivation letter. If the placement does not react in a period of 14 days, please call by phone and ask if there are possibilities.\n  \u2022 Are there any grants available?\n    Finding grants is difficult. From time to time there are other possibilities, funded by the European Union (e.g. Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci). The university does not participate permanently in these programs. Ask your internship coordinator for more information.\n  \u2022 Which agreements I have to make with a placement?\n    1. Starting- and end date; 2. Subject; 3. Allowance; 4. Housing; 5. Maybe allowance in cost of travelling and housing; 6. How to meet each other for the first time; 7. Reporting and confidentiality. Probably you have to sign a confidentiality agreement.\n  \u2022 How is the internship graded?\n    An evaluation form (to be filled up by your industrial supervisor) and the report will be used for proposing the final grade.\n  \u2022 Do I get a University supervisor?\n    Yes, you will get a university supervisor at one of the respective groups.\n  \u2022 What else is important to know?\n    Insurance for travelling: The Wageningen University will pay for you. Please go for this matter to the student desk in Forum.\n    Visa: getting the right papers and visa needs lots of time. Generally a statement of both University (internship coordinator) and internship placement is needed.\n    \u201cOV jaarkaart\u201d: Use the standard form and let sign by your internship coordinator and stamp by your department.\n    Health insurance: Please check at the insurance company if all necessary things are covered.",
