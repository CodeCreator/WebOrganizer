Bryantom\n\n    Bryantom New Member\n\n    I see the ability to make manasteel tools and weapons using tinkers construct, but when I put manasteel ingots into the smeltery, it does not melt. How do I make the pieces to construct these items? We're running Infinity.\n\n  2. Football6078\n\n    Football6078 New Member\n\n    I would assume it's the same as thaumium, so you craft pieces in the part builder with stencils.\n    malicious_bloke and Padfoote like this.\n  3. Bryantom\n\n    Bryantom New Member\n\n    That worked! Thank you.\n\n  4. Azzanine\n\n    Azzanine New Member\n\n    What benefits do manasteel parts give I wonder. Is TiC clever enough to make the tool have that mana repair feature or is it just gonna be like thaumium and be slightly different version of writable.\n\n    Sent from my GT-I9100 using Tapatalk\n  5. Padfoote\n\n    Padfoote Brick Thrower Team Member Forum Moderator\n\n    As far as I can tell (haven't put it on any tools yet) it's just a different coloured Thaumium without the writable bit.\n  6. Azzanine\n\n    Azzanine New Member\n\n    That kind of sound like it's not like Thaumium at all lol. Sounds like a hastily added metal. Is this vanilla TiCo or ExtTiC?\n\n    Sent from my GT-I9100 using Tapatalk\n  7. Padfoote\n\n    Padfoote Brick Thrower Team Member Forum Moderator\n\n    Well, alike enough in the fact that it's a metal that doesn't get melted down to be made into a part. :p\n\n  8. Bryantom\n\n    Bryantom New Member\n\n    Does this mean my suit is fireproof?! :eek: Probably the suit is fireproof, but my flesh showing through is NOT.\n  9. Cpt_gloval\n\n    Cpt_gloval Well-Known Member\n\n    Manasteel and the pink one, can't think of the name, do repair with a mana tablet in your inventory. Mana steel is iron stats and the other is steel stats I believe.\n  10. ljfa\n\n    ljfa New Member\n\n    it's Elementium.\n\n    oh that's neat, that doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere ingame.\n    I guess it's the same with Terrasteel?\n  11.
