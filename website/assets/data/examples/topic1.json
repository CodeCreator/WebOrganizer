        "text":"Design \/ Fashion\n\nHow to design a Ta Moko, the Maori tattoo\n\nThe Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, have a strong and long tradition of tattoos. Both men and women get tattoos, although only men receive the characteristic full face tattoos. A tattoo, or Ta Moko\u00a0represents the social status of a person, family history, tribal affiliation and even marriage eligibility. The fact that a non-Maori wants to get a Ta Moko can be a touchy subject, so the design must be well thought out to avoid offense. Swirling and geometric patterns are made to stand out, but if you seek something more personal, here are 5 steps to design your very own Ta Moko:\n\nTa Moko\n\nTa Moko\n\n1. Investigate thoroughly: disrespectful tattoos are the greatest risk for non-Maori people when they want that kind of tattoo. Since Maori tattoos are a form of identification, you should never copy an existing tattoo, cause that\u00a0would be essentially stealing an identity. As we can\u00a0see with other culturally significant body art, the chances\u00a0of getting a tattoo with a pitiful\u00a0meaning are\u00a0high if some\u00a0proper research hasn\u2019t been done previously.\n\n2. Choose the location for your tattoo: facial tattoos are the most common Maori designs. However, this might not be an eligible option for most people. The Maori also make\u00a0full body tattoos, with areas such as the back, arms and breasts decorated with spiral designs. Consider your lifestyle when choosing the place for your tattoo, and make a design somewhere that can be easily covered with clothing. The location of your tattoo will dictate\u00a0the type of design that is appropriate.\n\nTa Moko face\n\nTa Moko face\n\n3. Work with a local artist to create the design of your tattoo: you may have to go outside your area, but there are many artists who are specialized in Maori designs. Working with a qualified artist will ensure that you get a proper respectful and meaningful tattoo able to represent you. Ask to see a sample of the artist\u2019s work so you\u2019ll know if your ability is up to par.\n\n4. If the search for an artist in your area is too hard, look for a Maori tattoo artist from all around the world: get someone abroad for the\u00a0design of the tattoo and a local artist to\u00a0run it.\n\n5. Consider the possibility of a Kirituhi tattoo design if you\u2019re worried about the meaning of your tattoo: initially, Kirituhi were\u00a0painted on the body with charcoal. Nowadays, they have experienced a modern revival, being tattooed on the skin. These tattoos are inspired by Ta Moko, but have no real meaning. Thus, you\u2019ll get all the aesthetic benefits of a Maori tattoo without the cultural problems.\n\nTags: , , ,\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The painting was originally among the works selected by the Obamas to hang in the White House, but was returned - either due to the controversy or because it really didn't match the sofa. The reasons really are inconsequential. What is of interest are the heated debates over the differences between tribute art and outright theft of concept and\/or visuals.\n\nIt is true that art imitates life. It is also true that in one way, shape, or form, art also imitates art. It can't be helped. Artists ARE influenced in their ideas and their forms of expression.\n\nPicasso said \"the bad artists imitate, the great artists steal.\"\nIn other words, to steal an idea you have to own it and make it your own.\nTo imitate, you merely need to copy it and put nothing of yourself into it.\n\nOn one hand, Alma's \"Watusi\" is an almost exact replica of Matisse's \"L'escargot\" with palette changed and shapes rearranged. On the other hand, it is well documented that Alma created the painting as a tribute, using it as a study of Matisse's techniques. She never hid the fact that it was directly influenced. Furthermore, her study of this particular work was apparently a turning point in her art. Everything that followed reflected the impact of Matisse on her paintings\/concepts\/approach. As Tilly Greene remarked yesterday, it would have been MORE interesting to see Alma take the influence to another level, rather than just remake Matisse's composition. But it should be duly noted that Alma probably had no idea that her painting would one day hang in the Hirshhorn Museum and be considered one of the great works of American art.\n\nI've often wondered if Picasso and Matisse would roll over in their graves knowing that their napkin drawings are considered fine works of art. Nawwww - Picasso would love it, the arrogant old bastard!\n\nThe major difference between plagiarism and tribute seems to be credit given where credit is due. Trying to pass off copies of someone else's original concepts and work as your own is plagiarism, pure and simple. Utilizing the ideas and visuals of a \"master\" artist to create something new, or to study technique is tribute. All art is an imitation in one form or another, whether it is an imitation of something seen or an expression of an idea born within the mind of the artist. It is the process of communicating the ideas, the visions, the exploration that creates the art in whatever genre the artist chooses to express themselves in.\n\nDoes Watusi deserve to be considered a great work of art, given that it is a tribute piece? It depends on who you talk to. Personally I think it is confusing and blurs the already subjective lines of what constitutes \"masterful\" art - art that rates hanging in the top museums of the world. Does Alma Thomas deserve the scathing disregard for her work that is currently being bandied about? Absolutely not. However, on the bright side - more people now know her name and have looked at her paintings. Bad P.R. is better than no P.R. type thing.\n\nArt is once again the heated topic of discussion - replacing whatever was on television last night as the topic of choice.\nWell, for some people anyway.\n\nTuesday, November 10, 2009\n\nDAMage Research - Plagarism or Tribute?\n\nThe 1963 painting by Alma Thomas (to the right) is extremely similar to a 1953 piece by Matisse (below).\n\nit would be interesting to find out what the Hirshhorn Museum paid for Watusi.\n\nThomas's painting was first exhibited in the '60s. At that time, you could no more plagiarize a Matisse collage such as \"The Snail\" than you could pass off the \"Mona Lisa\" as your own.\n\nElaborations on earlier artists' work, even full appropriation, have been common practice in art for hundreds of years. Artists long learned their craft by copying the works of older masters; even among high artists, it was standard.\n\nthe 73-year-old artist found herself staring at the hollyhock shadows she had known her entire life and calculating\n\nhow to use them in her paintings. A year earlier, she had seen the late Matisse cutouts at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Matisse's work had prompted her to paint an acrylic-on-canvas version of his collage The Snail (1953), in which nearly all the original colors were reversed. Thomas named her painting Watusi (Hard Edge), after Chubby Checker's dance hit \"The Watusi.\" As well as marrying high modernism with the popular culture of black America--then entering the American mainstream--the title she chose noted Matisse's debt to African art.\n\nPablo Picasso that, \"the bad artists imitate, the great artists steal.\" Thomas' work here is a transformation of the Matisse painting. There is power in the decision to reverse colors and to change perspective from \"L'escargot,\"giving \"Watusi\" integrity to stand on its own as a distinctive piece.\n\n\nillegitimate copying is real. Both Richard Prince (See VR\u2019s \u201cPrince of Pilfer\u201d) and Jeff Koons have been sued by photographers for incorporating copyrighted work into their own. Koons lost the Rogers v. Koons case, but won a more recent suit under the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine. Readers will remember that earlier this year Damien Hirst threatened to sue a 16-year-old over his use of an image of Hirst\u2019s diamond-incrusted skull, in the process demanding royalties.\n\nThomas always credited Matisse for the inspiration that produced Watusi. It is obvious that the work launched her on a journey of artistic discovery that produced her unique and forward-looking (if not radical) mosaic style.\n\nTo assert that Thomas was \u201csimply copying\u201d Matisse would be to deny the rich and varied underpinnings of her work. Thomas was deeply impressed by the colors and patterns of the natural world around her.\n\n**Credit to Venetian Red Contributors Christine Cariati and Liz Hager for excellent arguments and research\n\nFriday, November 6, 2009\n\nNo Jobs and Everything Costs More - 2005 to 2009 costs of Eggs, Bread, Milk and Gas\n\nI found it positively disgusting that i couldn't find these numbers quickly, easily, or in layman terms after spending over half an hour searching the web and online news.

        "text":"Shepard Fairey, the 38-year-old street artist who's famous for plastering city landscapes with his stenciled images, looked across Larkin Street the other day to find that someone had vandalized one of his posters.\n\nThe anonymous miscreant had scrawled a large dollar sign on Andre the Giant's forehead along with tears streaming down the giant's fat cheeks.\n\nFairey took personally the graffiti on his graffiti. He interpreted the message to be, as he said in mock horror, \"Oh, that Shepard Fairey, he's sold out!\"\n\nFairey shook his head and added, \"Some people define things as cool not by the amount of integrity they have but by how underground they are.\"\n\nAnd Fairey, much to the chagrin of his aging punk-rock admirers, is no longer underground. The Angeleno, who graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1992, has opened several design studios, conceptualized guerrilla marketing campaigns for clients such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew, and is married, with two children.\n\nYet he first earned notoriety in the late '80s for his obtuse \"obey\" stickers that featured a mug shot of the late wrestler Andre the Giant. Fairey has called the stickers \"an experiment in phenomenology,\" one in which he hoped viewers would be so confounded by the absurdity of the image they would question other visual messages they come across in their daily lives.\n\nHe was standing outside White Walls Gallery in the Tenderloin when he noticed the marks on his poster, three days before the opening of his solo exhibition, \"The Duality of Humanity.\" Even though he has shown in galleries for years and attracted a following of wealthy buyers who enjoy his brand of art, Fairey achieved mainstream attention only this summer, after he designed what's become an iconic poster of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.\n\nThe image has been interpreted by critics as either capturing the inspiration Obama embodies or as just downright creepy in its propagandistic depiction of the political figure. The portrait, in muted tones, takes cues from socialist realism and is reminiscent of posters created to celebrate Lenin, Stalin and Mao. Fairey has enjoyed this debate. \"The illustration does have roots in propaganda art,\" Fairey said. \"I also want it to seem like a patriotic image, but not be seen as too countercultural. ... It needed just enough mainstream ingredients to transcend.\"\n\nWhile the Obama prints have inspired an eBay cottage industry (some are going for $150 or more, if signed by Fairey), the \"Duality of Humanity\" show has been scheduled since 2006, said gallery owner Justin Giarla.\n\nThe week before the show, Giarla was taking phone calls almost nonstop from potential buyers, some snapping up works sight unseen. The largest piece sold for $85,000, a few for $25,000 and several others for $15,000, Giarla said. Two days before the opening, Giarla reported they'd sold all 150 original pieces, and had sold an additional 25.\n\n\"We're way sold out,\" as Giarla put it.\n\nThe \"Duality\" pieces, all created within the past two years, are heavy on images of war, propaganda and capitalism - but all are infused with humor. Fairey purposely used a red-black-cream palette, the color scheme most associated with Soviet-era posters. Initially, the images are meant to suggest a conformist message; on closer look, they signal a biting commentary or a slight joke.\n\n\"It's asking people to question everything they're confronted by at first glance,\" Fairey said. \"Propaganda hits you in the gut. And it's proven to be effective.\"\n\nIn one poster, which looks as if could have been designed during the U.S. Work Projects Administration of the 1930 and '40s, Uncle Sam beams down at the onlooker while cradling a pile of skulls bearing the phrases \"human rights\" and \"civil liberties.\" Along the edges is the phrase \"Do as he says not as he does.\"\n\nFor another, Fairey designed a mixed-media collage with the same lavishly engraved aesthetic found on a dollar bill. Instead of a pyramid and eyeball, the centerpiece is an American bald eagle perched on a gas nozzle.\n\n\"You don't question the authority,\" Fairey said of his creation. \"You submit, because you think, 'It's so intricately designed, it can't be questioned.' \"\n\nFairey's work can appear simple to create, and his uncomplicated political metaphors give his critics (usually writers with academic or fine arts credentials) an opportunity to label him as a ham-handed pop artist. Yet that's not much of a critique to a self-described populist.\n\n\"I could teach any 15-year-old to do what I do,\" Fairey said. \"I learned everything I still do when I was 15 - stenciling, photocopying, printing. But that's what punk rock is about. Your technical ability doesn't limit your ability to impact people. That's empowering to people; you don't need to be an impresario.\"\n\nDuring his weeklong stay in San Francisco, Fairey and his assistants splattered posters on about 30 spots in the city. At one point, they climbed a billboard and were startled by an apartment dweller who stuck his head out a window and asked them what they were doing. When the resident saw the Obama images, Fairey said the resident responded, \"All right. That's cool,\" and closed the window.\n\nStaring at the graffitied poster of Andre the Giant outside the White Walls Gallery, Fairey recalled his admiration of Nirvana during the \"Bleach\" album era. He said he remained a fan after the band made \"Nevermind,\" even though some of his friends disavowed Nirvana as a pop culture sell-out. To Fairey, the band had merely reached more people while keeping its musical ideals intact - \"facilitating awesomeness on many levels.\"\n\nHe listed a number of charities and good causes he has donated to with proceeds from his art, and mentioned that the sale from one piece at White Walls would go to charities for American and Iraqi children.\n\nInside the gallery, he looked around and said, \"The irony is there's stuff in here that's not in my price range.\"\n\n\"The Duality of Humanity: New Works by Shepard Fairey\" runs through Oct. 4 at White Walls Gallery, 835 Larkin St., San Francisco.

        "text":"October 8, 2008 \/ 7:42 AM \/ 9 years ago\n\nChinese art sales weak in Sotheby's HK auction\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - The global financial crisis doused the Chinese art market boom on Wednesday, with Sotheby\u2019s saying it sold HK$1.1 billion ($141.6 million) worth of Asian art in its biannual sales in Hong Kong, around half the expected total.\n\nSotheby\u2019s pre-sale estimate for the five-day auction series had been over HK$2 billion, but numerous categories of artwork including jewelry, Chinese imperial ceramics, Chinese contemporary and 20th century paintings, were riven with unsold lots as global buyers and collectors sat on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to certain high value pictures, maybe our sellers have been a little over-optimistic with estimates and certainly in a category which has gone up so many times in the last few years. It is only normal,\u201d Patti Wong, Sotheby\u2019s Asia Chairman told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWhile we didn\u2019t reach our series\u2019 low estimate, this is the third highest sales total ever achieved for Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe weak showing marks a symbolic turning point for the seemingly unstoppable Chinese art market, which has steamed ahead on a flood of new Chinese wealth and the country\u2019s growing international cultural stature and feted star artists.\n\nWith global credit markets frozen up amid the financial meltdown, sentiment appears to have finally weakened during Sotheby\u2019s biannual event, seen as a key barometer for Chinese art market sentiment, along with sales in London and New York.\n\n\nIn Sotheby\u2019s marquee autumn evening sale of Asian contemporary art over the weekend, 19 of 47 prominent works went unsold and others barely hit low estimates.\n\nDemand was also weak for 20th century Chinese artwork, with only 39 of 110 lots sold, given weak demand, high valuations and narrow participation by buyers outside of key greater China markets such as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Over 60 percent of lots in the imperial ceramics sale also failed to sell.\n\nSotheby\u2019s jewelry sales were also sluggish with over half, or 162 of 321 items failing to find buyers -- including a heavily marketed 102.56-carat vivid yellow diamond necklace.\n\nWong said, however, that \u201cbullish sentiment\u201d was apparent in other categories such as lesser-priced Southeast Asian and fine classical Chinese paintings with some record-breaking results.\n\n\u201cCollectors are increasingly being selective and there\u2019s a strong migration into value,\u201d Wong added.\n\nA batch of Chinese imperial treasures including an emperor\u2019s seal and a scroll painting bucked the weak sentiment however, underscoring demand for exceptional objects of great quality, rarity and historical significance remains strong.\n\nIn Sotheby\u2019s \u201cLegacies of Imperial Power\u201d sale, a massive jade seal etched with the four Chinese characters \u201cQianlong yubi\u201d (in the Imperial hand of Qianlong (emperor) fetched HK$63.4 million ($8.13 million) after bidding in the half-full auction hall -- a record for any Chinese imperial white jade seal.\n\nAnother Qing treasure, a 15-meter-long Qianlong military handscroll, the \u201cDayue Tu\u201d -- painted with 16,000 miniature figures including the emperor himself, sold for HK$67.86 million ($8.7 million), a record for any Qing imperial painting, but well below its pre-sale estimate of over $HK80 million.\n\nNicolas Chow, Sotheby\u2019s global head of Chinese ceramics and works of art said the results \u201cillustrate the growing interest in unique historical works of art and are a testament to the demand for objects which reflect ... the Chinese imperial past.\u201d\n\nEditing by David Fox\n\n0 : 0\n  \u2022 narrow-browser-and-phone\n  \u2022 medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet\n  \u2022 medium-wide-browser\n  \u2022 wide-browser-and-larger\n  \u2022 medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet\n  \u2022 medium-wide-browser-and-larger\n  \u2022 above-phone\n  \u2022 portrait-tablet-and-above\n  \u2022 above-portrait-tablet\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet-and-above\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser\n  \u2022 portrait-tablet-and-below\n  \u2022 landscape-tablet-and-below",
