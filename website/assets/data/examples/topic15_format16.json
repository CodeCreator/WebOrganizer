Today, this company produces more than 86% of oil, 28% of gas condensate and 16% of gas from the total hydrocarbon production in our country.\n\nThe customer needed a new crane to more efficiently provide loading and unloading operations at the territory of the oil refinery. It is worth noting that, along with our designers, the representatives of the Customer took an active part in the development of the project of the crane overpass and the crane itself - this made it possible to take into account all the nuances of the technological process, for which new crane equipment was needed.\n\nThe main technical characteristics of the crane model KMO-10.0-20.00-7.0-A5:\n\n  \u2022 carrying capacity - 10.0 t;\n  \u2022 lifting height - 7.0 t;\n  \u2022 crane span - 20.0 m;\n  \u2022 lifting and lowering speed - 4.0 m \/ min;\n  \u2022 the speed of movement of the trolley - 20.0 m \/ min;\n  \u2022 crane movement speed - 40.0 \/ 10.0 m \/ min;\n  \u2022 degree of protection of electrical equipment - IP55;\n  \u2022 group operating mode according to ISO or GOST - 2m (medium).\n\nThe main components on a supporting bridge crane: cable hoist MT type, gear motors for moving and lifting, as well as end beams - produced by the Bulgarian plant Podemcrane. The span bridge (a welded beam of a box-shaped structure with a width of a riding shelf of 295 mm) was manufactured at Kyiv Crane Machinery Plant LLC.\n\nThe crane package also includes:\n\n  \u2022 load limiter;\n  \u2022 limit switch of raising and lowering;\n  \u2022 trailer switches of crane and hoist movement;\n  \u2022 additional brake of the lifting mechanism;\n  \u2022 thermal protection of the lift engine;\n  \u2022 phase control relay;\n  \u2022 light and sound alarm for crane operation - Schneider 24V;\n  \u2022 main contactor in the circuit;\n  \u2022 LED lighting of the working area.\n\nThe increased degree of protection of electrical equipment, as well as anticorrosive painting of the span bridge ensures reliable operability of crane equipment in the open air at any time of the year and in any weather.\n\nAfter delivery to the place of operation, the crane was mounted and after testing it was put into operation as soon as possible, despite the fact that the installation and commissioning were carried out in the conditions of the current production. Currently, the new crane equipment is being successfully operated: with its help, loading and unloading of raw materials, equipment and tools is carried out in the custody of the oil refinery.\n\n(3 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a, \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435: 5.00 \u0438\u0437 5)",

        "text":"- Model 5 kg brick - COCO PEAT \/ COIR PITH \/ COCO BRICK\n\nCocopeat is a natural fibre made out of coconut husks. The extraction of the coconut fibre from husks gives us this by-product called cocopeat. Cocopeat is a 100% natural growing medium. This cocopeat dried in the natural sun, are processed to produce different items namely cocopeat block, cocopeat briquettes, cocopeat tablets etc. This makes an excellent growing medium for hydrophonics or container plant growing. Clean coir has natural rooting hormones and anti-fungal properties. The various usages of cocopeat is given below :- How does Coco Peat do this? The properties of Coco Peat make it resistant to bacterial and fungal growth. Coco Peat holds water rather than shedding it like traditional peat does! It holds 8-9 times it's weight in water. Coco Peat has the ability to store and release nutrient to plants for extended periods of time. It also has great oxygenation properties which is important for healthy root development. It has a pH of 5.2-6.8 which is neutral to slightly acidic. This makes it great for alkaline garden soils. Easy to use! Just put your compressed Coco Peat brick in a container, add 4 quarts of warm water and let it sit until the water is absorbed, fluff it up and you are ready to use Coco Peat! Coco Peat can even be reused for up to 4 years! It makes a great bedding material for worm bins! It's actually good for them and increases worm growth by 25%. Coco Peat is very slow to disintegrate; it only begins to break down when it is 10 years old, long term benefits. It is very light and easy to handle. It can be combined with any of the normal ingredients and use as a mixer or a stand-alone product. An affordable price for a quality product with an environmentally sustainable future. Coco peat is also known as Coir pith, Coir fiber pith. It is made from Coconut husk. We offer various range of Coco peat blocks. Our factory is equipped with 5 kg block making machine and 650 grams block making machine. We can produce good quality Coco peat blocks with the well equipped machineries.\n\nCustomer reviews\n\nNo reviews were found for DAKSHA COCO PEAT - Model 5 kg brick - COCO PEAT \/ COIR PITH \/ COCO BRICK.

Not only that, but the site was the best performing wind farm in the world for multiple years \u2013 delivering over twice the expected electricity production. It\u2019s expected that the first stage of the wind farm project would have supplied 16,000 Kiwi homes with their daily energy requirements \u2013 approximately half the size of Palmerston North\u2019s occupied dwellings.\n\nAs our first wind farm project, we were excited to hit the ground running on Christmas Eve, 1999. Our role throughout the project was to trench and cable the land to ensure that everything was perfect for the installation.\n\nThe Tararua site was a great choice for the wind farm to be set up, due to the positioning of the turbines to capture most of the wind rolling through the mountainous terrain.\n\nWe are proud of the work that we put into the farm that kept Aotearoa\u2019s lights on, heaters burning away throughout winter, as well as the clean energy that is produced from the farm.\n\nThis project was the catalyst that started our 20-year journey through wind farm trenching and cabling.\n\nView Other Projects\n213 Stoney Creek Road, RD10, Palmerston North, 4470\n\nFollow us:\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Blackley Construction Ltd.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nWebsite designed & developed by: Studio Seventyfour Branding & Marketing",

        "text":"Artifical intelligence for realtime decisions\n\nWhat DXQanalyze stands for\n\nDXQanalyze is one of the four product families of our Digital Factory. The family includes the analysis software, which records all data during the painting process as well as during the entire car body drying process. As a further member of DXQanalyze, detects irregularities in the painting quality and meticulously identifies possible causes. This allows to increase the first-run rate and thus the overall equipment effectiveness.\n\nThe software products of the Digital Factory, united under the name DXQ, are divided into four product families: DXQanalyze, DXQoperate, DXQcontrol and DXQsupport. In this article we would like to introduce you to the two analysis tools and of the DXQanalyze product family.\n\nYou may already know the analysis tool from our article \"Smart paint shop with\" published in March 2019.\n\nThis tool helps to collect, evaluate and visualize robot and process data. The software seamlessly records all data from the painting process and analyzes it. Based on this, a \u2018digital fingerprint\u2019 is created for each painted car body. Learn more about the use of in the painting process in our article \"Smart Paint Shops with\". for oven\n\nThe analysis software shown above has been extended by a new module. It can now be used for the first time in the drying process.\n\nThe software for oven is an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solution, which simulates body heating curves in the oven in real time. This means that paint shop operators can see the current temperature profiles directly on the workpiece from the current drying process and additionally get various body-related characteristic values. This enables the conditions in the oven, which are influenced by a variety of parameters, to be traced back precisely for each individual body. Deviations from the ideal process can then be identified at an early stage, and appropriate countermeasures put in place.\n\nHow does for oven work?\n\nThe software\u2019s algorithm calculates the heating curves at different measuring points on the body based on the current system parameters. An optical measurement inside the oven, which serves as a reference point, ensures the quality of the calculated profiles in the long term. Each body gets its own electronic workpiece data record where all the data is stored. In addition, all physically measured data from test runs is stored centrally and used to train the algorithm.\n\nHow does for oven contribute to quality improvement?\n\nIn order to guarantee a consistently high quality of the painting result, the specific heating behavior for each body type must be scrupulously observed. Up to now, the processes were adjusted based on data from the initial calibration runs during commissioning and from test runs conducted at intervals of several weeks during production. In the interim, the operator had no information about the actual heating behavior on the body. With we can now close this information gap and contribute to quality improvement.\n\nWith for oven, we place the focus on the quality of plant operation. The real-time simulation of heating curves, a clear visualization, and the central, continuous data storage greatly increase transparency for the operator. At the same time, they serve as an individual quality certificate for the entire drying process for each individual body. The tool uses the body-specific data and relates them to quality data generated during the inspection of the end product. This allows to determine which causes in the process influence the quality of the end product. for ovens also provides an important component for the D\u00fcrr tool by storing body-specific data.\n\nOur third software of the DXQanalyze family is On the way through a paint shop, each body undergoes different complex process steps. The basic concept of is to save information from different sources via the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) specifically for each individual body in a whole-of-life record, compare this information with quality data, and statistically evaluate the data of all the vehicles produced. Its goal is to determine the normal behaviour of the plant with its process steps from the collected data sets. Artificial intelligence is used to identify patterns, compare them with quality data, and derive consequences for a targeted optimization of the first-run rate.\n\nHow does work? uses big data models to identify previously unknown interrelationships in the paint shop. The infrastructure for the digital data flows is the IIoT platform ADAMOS, which is used to collect all production, process, and quality data. The software determines subsequently the quality condition from this information and visualizes it on a dashboard for the paint shop operator. Our customers can find a quick overview of quality-related performance indicators, such as the production rate including post-processing and the second-run rate. The performance indicators are automatically associated with the recorded quality defects and evaluated on the basis of the defect cause. The paint shop operator is shown a visualization of where quality defects occur more frequently on the bodies, and in this way is helped to find production vulnerabilities.\nOur software enables our customers to continuously optimize their plant and thus increase the first-run rate in the long term.\n\nHow does contribute to quality improvement? uses artificial intelligence to identify systematically occurring quality deviations and uncover their causes in the process. With the help of self-learning data models, recurring patterns in recorded quality data are determined and linked to anomalies in the production process. Up to now, defects were often only found during the visual inspection, meaning that bodies had to be reworked. In contrast, uses the historical data to determine that the defect is not sporadic but rather a systematic defect pattern and provides advance information about impending quality problems. With this tool we can considerably improve the quality management in paint shops and production plants.",
