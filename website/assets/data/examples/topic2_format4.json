The latest test cycle (with the test re-enabled)\npassed on all platforms with Java 6 (including Windows). With Java 5,\nthe tests only passed on Windows. No Java 5 results were reported from\nthe Solaris and Linux variants.\n\nDoes the test pass with Java 5 in your (OS\/X) environment?\n\nKnut Anders\n\nView raw message",
