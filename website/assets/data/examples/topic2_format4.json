There's no reason to use them except to try and do something tricky like your PUSH() example, and I think that's a bad idea because it has hidden behaviors and doesn't work the way other subs do.

        "text":"How can we improve the Microsoft Edge developer experience?\n\n\nI see that this vote was taken down (which is completely against the spirit of a *community* telling YOU what THEY want).\n\n.NET has been around for over a decade. Organizations and developers alike have invested hundreds of thousands of hours learning .NET and its languages. Code bases and libraries have been built around these languages that eliminate friction and encapsulate solutions to problems encountered over the lifetime of a product and\/or framework.\n\nBy forcing developers to use JavaScript, and not utilize .NET languages, the Edge team is essentially forcing their users to break the fundamental principle of DRY:\n\nIn addition to forgoing hundreds of thousands of hours (and dollars) of investment, organizations and developers must now solve re-occurring problems (already encountered and accounted for in their favorite and familiar language of choice) in a completely new language, and forcing them to abandon mature and tested code. In doing so, they encounter new frictions and frustrations related to a different, incompatible paradigm that is being (unnecessarily) forced upon them. This is a wasteful and inefficient (not to mention expensive) approach.\n\nThe net result of this approach is that the same problems are now solved in two different languages, fundamentally breaking the principle of DRY.\n\nThe Edge team should account for .NET developers and allow them to leverage their extensive and exhaustive investments to make Edge a better (and fun, thereby more popular) product.\n\n241 votes\nSign in\nor sign in with\n  \u2022 facebook\n  \u2022 google\n    Password icon\n    Signed in as (Sign out)\n    You have left!

So basically the problem is Edge brings the end of ActiveX support and also other browsers are ending up support for NPAPI plugins as well.\n        We are going for cross browsers so I need a suggestion is there any way to replace those ActiveX controls with some other tech to make it work with compatibility of cross browsing platform?\n\n        Help would be much appreciated.\n        Thanks in advance.\n\n      \u2022 Jason R commented \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 Flag as inappropriate\n\n        If you're going to emulate flash, you should also emulate .net\/silverlight as well.\n\n      \u2022 Some Idiot commented \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 Flag as inappropriate\n\n        Thanks for your feedback, Kai. To be sure, this ask is for tooling around the Extensions API exactly like you suggest in regards to an asm.js\/WebAssembly.\n\n        This would indeed involve a serious toolchain and development process on .NET's side as you suggest (see: ), but at some point it would indeed involve integration with the Edge team to properly connect the pieces and have their API play nicely with the new system.\n\n        There are two sides to MSFT: web and native (.NET), and they do not have to be incompatible. However, to build a bridge you need two stable foundations on each side from which to anchor the bridge. :)\n\n        More than anything, this is asking the Edge team to account for their side of the work (and to build awareness\/demand, etc).\n\n        The important thing here is that we are NOT asking for another ActiveX\/plugin design.

It'll be another ActiveX style situation.\n\n        A .NET -> asm.js\/WebAssembly compiler so you can run your .NET code in the browser would be better, and that would be more of a request to the .NET teams.\n\n      \u2022 Mike-EEE commented \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 Flag as inappropriate\n\n        OK I have spent the past few months putting a site together to better articulate my position around this concept and the general ask here. The core of the issue is that promoting HTML5\/JS is an incompatible strategy with other Microsoft properties. Namely, the Windows Store and ... well, pretty much every technology under its IP portfolio, LOL. However, that doesn't mean it's incompatible or that there isn't a solution.\n\n        You can view the series here:\n\n        Furthermore, the particular post that examines the expensive and divisive nature of promoting HTML5 alongside current .NET client application models and corresponding technologies can be found here:\n\n        Additionally, you can vote for the idea that will fix all of this:\n\n        Finally, this particular vote is a featured vote on Developers Win!\n\n        Whew. :)\n\n      \u2022 Mike-EEE commented \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 Flag as inappropriate\n\n        There has been some great discussions here and I (again) want to thank the Edge team and in particular David Storey for providing input and perspective. It's helped shaped my own thoughts around this and also made me realize that what I am after is bigger than the Edge group in particular (although they should most definitely be involved in some capacity).\n\n        You make some good points below, Cyprien. This vote doesn't really capture the goal here, but it does attend to some of the primary issues. Everything you say makes sense through the lens of a web developer. And, if Microsoft was a web development company, then case closed, we're all happy and end of discussion.\n\n        I would get to shut my face and you all would get to live in peace. :)\n\n        However, it's not, and therein lies the problem. We have 15 years of .NET development to account for that currently does not enjoy the web ubiquity that you do. That is 15 years and thousands of organizations and 100,000s of developers who LOVE and PREFER their client application models JUST AS MUCH as you and other web developers do with yours. How are we (and Microsoft) to account for this?\n\n        Again, if you write something in C# on the server side and another component that does the same thing in client-side JavaScript you have broken DRY and are adding costly (unnecessary) overhead to solutions and organizations.\n\n        The primary issue here is that Microsoft does not have a bridge between the varying .NET client application models (WinForms\/WPF\/UWP) and the standards-compliant ubiquitous web. It is an enormously tremendous (expensive) hurdle and one that should be addressed altogether before every MSFT developer decides to bail altogether.\n\n        And they will.\n\n        Consider this: MSFT charges developers $19\/year (and companies $99\/year) to register for the Windows Store. Meanwhile, they are simultaneously promoting web-standards and HTML5 development through Angular and here with Edge.\n\n        If a developer can develop a HTML5 application FOR FREE and is available more ubiquitously than a hosted store, then what incentive do they have to pay the $19 to register for access for a non-ubiquitous market?\n\n        As awesome a job that the Edge team is doing, MSFT doesn't make money from its efforts or the standards it is promoting. In fact, MSFT doesn't make money from HTML5 at all, except if 1) Web Developers purchase Visual Studio (unlikely) or 2) Web Developers purchase and host on Azure (more likely).\n\n        (Feel free to correct me here if I am wrong.)\n\n        In fact, for every web developer out there, Microsoft is actually LOSING money because each one of those web developers are a potential $19 a year through the eyes of the Windows Store.\n\n        Talk about self-sabotage. If I were a MSFT shareholder, I would be disturbed by this revelation.\n\n        Again, this is a much bigger problem that is outside of the scope of this vote, but it is ultimately related. How do we bridge the divide between .NET client application models (which MSFT is now charging for registration as a featured business model) and the ubiquitous web (which is free and does not directly feed MSFT's bottom line)?\n\n        I appreciate the conversation and do know I am wanting to make sure that MSFT is successful with its endeavors. I say that as someone who has invested nearly fifteen years of their life into its technologies.\n\n      \u2022 Cyprien Autexier commented \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 Flag as inappropriate\n\n        I think the original suggestion has been taken down because discussion was becoming non constructive.\n\n        I love .net but above all I am a developer and I use the right language\/techno to solve the problems. I think it the case for every decent developer. Today Javascript(or Typescript) is a must know.\n\n        I am not opposed to this suggestion but I don't think this is a priority at all and I would prefer to see the Edge team move fast rather than spending time on this one.\n\n        Here are the reasons I see :\n        - Javascript is the industry standard for that scenario. It means it is the right technology to build xplat\/xbrowser extensions.\n        - The is a huge community community\n        - Javascript has good library for almost anything you need\n        - The IntelliSense c# developer love will be there if you choose to use Typescript\n        - async await c# developers are addicted to are already in preview\n        - Typescript is very easy to learn for a C# developer\n        - It is probably easier to maintain good security and quality with just javascript.\n\n        In addition I'm curious to hear about those companies who chose to invest massive money to build .net browser extension. I think C++ was more common.\n\n      Feedback and Knowledge Base",

        "text":"[Lightning-dev] bLIPs: A proposal for community-driven app layer and protocol extension standardization\n\nRyan Gentry ryan at lightning.engineering\nWed Jun 30 14:10:25 UTC 2021\n\nHi all,\n\nThe recent thread around zero-conf channels [1] provides an opportunity to\ndiscuss how the BOLT process handles features and best practices that arise\nin the wild vs. originating within the process itself. Zero-conf channels\nare one of many LN innovations on the app layer that have struggled to make\ntheir way into the spec. John Carvalho and Bitrefill launched Turbo\nchannels in April 2019 [2], Breez posted their solution to the mailing list\nfor feedback in August 2020 [3], and we know at least ACINQ and Muun\n(amongst others) have their own implementations. In an ideal world there\nwould be a descriptive design document that the app layer implementers had\ncollaborated on over the years that the spec group could then pick up and\nmerge into the BOLTs now that the feature is deemed spec-worthy.\n\nOver the last couple of months, we have discussed the idea of adding a\nBIP-style process (bLIPs? SPARKs? [4]) on top of the BOLTs with various\nmembers of the community, and have received positive feedback from both app\nlayer and protocol devs. This would not affect the existing BOLT process at\nall, but simply add a place for app layer best practices to be succinctly\ndescribed and organized, especially those that require coordination. These\nfeatures are being built outside of the BOLT process today anyways, so\nideally a bLIP process would bring them into the fold instead of leaving\nthem buried in old ML posts or not documented at all.\n\nSome potential bLIP ideas that people have mentioned include: each lnurl\nvariant, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast\npayment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, remote\nnode connection standards, etc.\n\nIf the community is interested in moving forward, we've started a branch\n[5] describing such a process. It's based on BIP-0002, so not trying to\nreinvent any wheels. It would be great to have developers from various\nimplementations and from the broader app layer ecosystem volunteer to be\nlisted as editors (basically the same role as in the BIPs).\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n\n\n\n\n[4] bLIP = Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal and SPARK =\nStandardization of Protocols at the Request of the Kommunity (h\/t fiatjaf)\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http:\/\/lists.linuxfoundation.org\/pipermail\/lightning-dev\/attachments\/20210630\/ed2d0adc\/attachment.html>\n\nMore information about the Lightning-dev mailing list",

The pre-existing gallery is implemented on a page that's called 'gallery.html' in a subfolder\u00a0 one level down from 'public_html' called 'barry'.\n\nCan you tell me the 'import from' path or path pattern that I need in order for svmanager to manage it?\n\nAlso, can the gallery inside 'barry' be managed with a copy of svmanager that's also stored inside 'barry'? Or does svmanager need to live outside of the folder that's to be managed?\n\nThank you.\n\np.s. I've changed the name of the folder holding svmanager to 'slidemanager' if that matters.\n\nRe: importing an existing gallery into svmanager\n\nI resolved the problem on my own.\n\nThe answer was to take the hint supplied by the path in the import field and do a little exploration.\n\nThe default path in the 'import from:' field matches the 'import to:' path just above it. So I tried entering the path to the 'barry' folder from the svmanager folder a la '..\/barry\/' and that worked.\n\nAs for the question of whether the svmanager can live inside the 'barry' folder I haven't explored that yet but I'm thinking that it might not be such a good idea since it might hamper file portability? Keeping the 2 things as separate modules might just be simpler in the long run.\n\nThanks anyway. Have you ever noticed that sometimes asking a question can help you figure out an answer?\n\nRe: importing an existing gallery into svmanager\n\nI'm glad the 'hint' worked \u2013 that was the idea.\n\nI'd stay with the setup you have. Having gallery folders inside the svmanager folder is the default. Having them outside the svmanager folder should be no problem. Having the svManager folder inside the gallery folder (if I understand you correctly) is unusual and may not work.\n\nIt is possible to move galleries using svManager but there are some restrictions at the moment (it's in the manual).\n\nYou're dead right about that asking questions thing. And one of the difficulties with trying to help on the forums is that people understandably have difficulty in formulating the right question. Once we get to the right question, the answer usually comes a lot easier.\n\n\nJack Hardie\nSimpleViewer Support Team.",
