        "text":"3 Ways The American Institute Of Architects Gives Back\n\nProfessional organizations don\u2019t usually have much impact outside of their membership, but the American Institute of Architects is an exception to this rule. With almost 100,000 members, the AIA is on the forefront of improving communities and advancing the status of architecture in today\u2019s world. From encouraging positive legislation to educating architects and the general public alike, the AIA strives to improve and beautify the world around us.\n\n1. Giving back to the community\n\nAlthough it works to improve the lives and careers of its members, the AIA does a lot for local communities as well. AIA members regularly volunteer their time to help people in their own neighborhoods. In 2015, AIA architects volunteered their services to the town of Louisville, Kentucky to help come up with a plan to revitalize the city\u2019s Russell neighborhood, an area filled with poorly designed, hastily constructed buildings. AIA members also receive special training to assess the safety of buildings after fires, floods and other natural disasters. The AIA itself also works with local charities to raise money for good causes like food drives.\n\n2. Legislation and laws\n\nOne of AIA\u2019s main goals is to advocate for improved laws and legislation. AIA representatives are active in encouraging Congress to pass helpful laws that provide tax credits for historic buildings and environmentally conscious design. They especially champion America\u2019s energy tax credit program, which has contributed to the national economy by creating almost a million new jobs since its introduction. The AIA is also enthusiastically committed to identifying and protecting historical buildings. They work with the Library of Congress on the Historic American Buildings Survey, a valuable record of historically significant structures within the United States.\n\n3. Architecture tours and events\n\nThe AIA hosts many architecture-related events to entertain and educate the general public. Their popular architecture tours offer sightseers the chance to see beautiful cities through the eyes of architectural experts. These tours to important cities like Barcelona, London and Chicago give visitors the chance to delve into lesser-known cityscapes and learn new facets of classic buildings. In addition to worldwide tours, the AIA hosts many local events like ArchtoberFest, an annual San Diego festival that offers a film festival and informative lectures for those wishing to learn more about regional construction styles.\n\nThrough education, advocating for historic preservation and volunteer work, the AIA has extended its influence far beyond the realm of architecture.",

Here are three of this year\u2019s standouts, exhibited in conjunction with Dutch Design Week 2015.\n\nIn Limbo Embassy\n\nEven before Angela Merkel\u2019s 180-degree turn on the Syrian refugee crisis, the issue of undocumented migrants had become a pressing concern in Europe. For refugees whose application for asylum status had been rejected, Manon van Hoeckel created a mobile pop-up safe space for dialogue and interaction. Formerly in-limbo immigrants are enlisted as volunteer ambassadors to explore legal loopholes. For instance, while they can\u2019t legally work, refugees have rights to freedom of expression and the press, allowing them to participate in the embassy\u2019s activities as a performance and sell a range of portraits (top) called \u201cPrinted Matters.\u201d The project was a finalist in the Dutch Design Awards, and its online platform is now used to promote a variety of ways that people can help refugees.\n\nFish on Dry Land\n\nGoing against the grain of her generation\u2019s cityward migration pattern, Marta Sif \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir moved out of Reykjavik to the small fishing town of \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in Iceland when she turned 20. While she discovered a satisfyingly full life\u2014contrary to her family and friends\u2019 expectations\u2014she noted the lack of economic opportunities as a reason for the brain and youth drain from provincial towns. Drawing on the visual language of local fishing equipment, she developed a product range comprising a coat stand, table, stool, and lamp that add a nautical twist to the otherwise utilitarian Nordic design language. By producing the range in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, she hopes to inspire locals to look at their surroundings differently.\n\nMan\u2019s Best Friend\n\nOther than slobbery friendship, the function of the world\u2019s millions of dogs has slipped since our hunter-gatherer days. Our canine companions need a new purpose\u2014a 2009 study by New Zealand\u2019s Victoria University of Wellington revealed that the environmental impact of pooches is worse than that of SUVs. With this and an underserved elderly population in mind, Archibald Godts from Belgium has explored pup-enabled frail-care\u00a0solutions. The four products he has designed are a pillbox that helps seniors schedule their meds, a pouch around the dog\u2019s neck to protect an owner\u2019s valuables or help them carry medications, saddlebags for weighty groceries, and a cart that can be hitched to dogs as a way to assist mobility-impaired owners.\n\nCanine companions do more for their elderly owners in Archibald Godts\u2019s project.\n\nFour fishing-inspired products designed by Marta Sif \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir.\n\nCategories: Arts + Culture, Design Education",

        "text":"Architecture In Malaysia\nTop 20 Buildings\n\nIn common with most countries, architecture in Malaysia comes in a wide range of styles. Buildings range from the magnificent (Petronas Twin Towers for example) to the hideous (some of the older low cost housing blocks).\n\nLoke Hall is the headquarters of the Malaysian Institute of Architects (PAM).\n\nThe Malaysian Institute of Architects (PAM) chooses for its headquarters one of Kuala Lumpur\u2019s most attractive heritage buildings, Loke Hall which was built in 1907 as a town house for Loke Chow Kit. It was thought to have been designed by Anglo-Indian architect A.K Musdeen.\n\nArchitecture In Malaysia - Top 20 Most Attractive\n\nWhen it comes to deciding which are the most attractive buildings in Malaysia, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Here is my list of Top 20 Buildings in Malaysia. I have excluded mosques, temples, churches and bridges which are covered elsewhere on this website. My list, which is in no particular order, is biased more towards older buildings, being something of an oldie myself!\n\nKL Twin Towers\n  \u2022 Petronas Towers. This is an obvious choice. KL\u2019s famous twin towers are 88 storeys high reaching 452m above street level. The building was the world\u2019s tallest from 1998 until 2004 when it was surpassed by Taipei 101.\n  \u2022 Another obvious choice is the stately, copper-domed Sultan Abdul Samad Building on Merdeka Square. This colonial era government building is still one of Kuala Lumpur\u2019s most iconic landmarks.\nSultan Ibrahim Building in JB\n  \u2022 The imposing Sultan Ibrahim Building in Johor Bahru dominates the JB skyline and was the tallest building in Malaysia until independence. The foundation stone was laid in1940 but construction was not completed until 1942, by which time Malaya was under Japanese occupation. It housed the State Secretariat until 2009 when that function was relocated to Kota Iskandar, the new Johor State Administrative capital. The building has been unoccupied for some years. There was talk of converting it into a museum but it is not clear when this will happen.\nHubback's Ipoh Railway Station masterpiece\n  \u2022 Ipoh Railway Station is nicknamed the Taj Mahal of Ipoh for its sense of scale and grandeur. It was completed in 1917 and had a hotel on the upper floor which closed down a few years ago. It was designed by Arthur Benison Hubback, a government draftsman\/architect who also designed Kuala Lumpur\u2019s railway station.\nOCBC's art deco branch in Kuala Lumpur\n  \u2022 The OCBC building on Medan Pasar Besar in Kuala Lumpur is a fine example of art-deco architecture with clean, elegant lines and functional design. It was built in 1937 with basement parking for bicycles.\nSeri Menanti Old Palace Museum\n  \u2022 Seri Menanti Old Palace is a four storey wooden structure built between 1902 and 1908 as a royal palace for the rulers of Negeri Sembilan state. Its unique style and the fact that it was built without the use of nails make it worthy of inclusion on this list of architecture in Malaysia.\nBlue Mansion, Penang\n  \u2022 The Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion in Leith Street, George Town, Penang is a beautiful example of a Chinese courtyard home. Also known as the Blue Mansion it operates as a boutique hotel.\n  \u2022 Also in Penang is the Khoo Kongsi, a clan house for the Khoo family and one of the most ornate and magnificent examples of a clan house in the country.\nMelaka Sultanate Palace\n  \u2022 Malacca Sultanate Palace is a replica of the original wooden Sultan of Malacca\u2019s palace which was burnt down by the Portuguese in 1511 Although it is recent, the stunning exterior gives a good idea of how the original might have looked.\nKuala Lumpur International Airport\n  \u2022 Kuala Lumpur International Airport was designed over 20 years ago and completed in 1998 but it continues to impress as one of the world\u2019s best airport designs.\nTreasury Ministry, Putrajaya\n  \u2022 Malaysia\u2019s administrative capital city, Putrajaya, boasts many fine government buildings. One of my favourites is the Ministry of Finance complex.\nRoyal Museum, Alor Setar\n  \u2022 Istana Kota Star is a palace in Alor Setar, Kedah and includes the Balai Besar and the Royal Museum. Thai and Malay architectural elements are incorporated in the unique design.\n  \u2022 Another palace makes the list - this time the Istana Jahar in Kota Bharu. It was built in 1887 and is now a museum.\nDutch era Stadthuys building in Malacca\n  \u2022 Even older, the Stadthuys in Melaka is an example of Dutch colonial architecture from the 1650\u2019s. It is one of the landmark buildings in Dutch Square that help give Melaka its characteristic feel.\nState Secretariat, Seremban\n  \u2022 Wisma Negeri is the State Secretariat building in Seremban. It is modern, having been built in 1987, but its distinctive buffalo horn roofline brings to mind the Minangkabau architecture of western Sumatra.\n  \u2022 There are many wonderful shophouse designs in Malaysia but one of the most elaborate and ornate I have seen is this fine example in Kuala Pilah.\n  \u2022 The colonial British administration used to build courthouses in every town of any size in Malaya. This court complex in Batu Gajah is one of the best surviving examples from that era.\n  \u2022 Also in Perak is Galeri Sultan Azlan Shah in Kuala Kangsar. This museum is housed in a former palace which combines European and tropical influences in its design.\n  \u2022 The Pavilion building in Kuching dates from 1909 and is a rare mix of English Renaissance and English Colonial architecture. It was built as a medical centre but is now a textile museum.\nTerengganu traditional house at Muzium Warisan Melayu\n  \u2022 There are many examples of gorgeous traditional Malay houses all over the country and the designs vary from state to state.\u00a0This example from Terengganu has been reassembled at the Muzium Warisan Melayu at Serdang.\n\nHope you like my Top 20 selection of architecture in Malaysia.\n\nReturn from Architecture in Malaysia to Malaysia Trivia\n\nReturn from Architecture in Malaysia to Home\n\nNew!

With one of the best film 35 millimeter cameras it is very possible to attain that jaw dropping low fi picture quality.\n\nIf this is your first time purchasing a film camera then you may be feeling a little lost on where to begin.

You can find my recommendations for the top models above but if you\u2019re interested in what I look at when comparing 35mm cameras check the buying guide tips below.\n\nBe sure to choose a camera that offers full manual mode\n\nTo become the best photographer you can be, you must be proficient and comfortable with shooting fully manually. This will force you to learn how to properly adjust all your cameras settings. In time you will understand how to optimize your shutter speed, ISO, and aperture for the best picture quality for your environment.

Because it is so important for your growth as a photographer be certain that your camera offers a fully manual mode.\n\nThis rule is for all cameras you may shoot with, not just 35mm film cameras. While autofocus technology has advanced tremendously over the years, a top photographer who understands how to shoot manually can achieve far better image results than even the best autofocus cameras. And in time and with practice, you will be able to just look at your subject and lighting conditions and intuitively know how to adjust your settings for the perfect shot. Another great benefit to selecting a fully manual camera is that so few photographers take the time to learn to effectively shoot manually which will instantly set you apart from other less dedicated photographers out there.\n\nSelect a camera that will be easy to repair\n\nHaving a camera that is easy to repair is a huge benefit especially if you are using a vintage camera model. Obscure cameras are much more difficult to repair if an issue arises. With 35mm film cameras there are often moving parts that may need repair and it can be difficult to fix yourself especially if you can\u2019t find the necessary parts.

If you have fallen in love with a more obscure film camera don\u2019t let this point stop you from getting that camera, but if you are not emotionally attached to any particular make then choose from the most popular 35 mm film cameras makers.\n\nAnother point to remember is that the most popular film cameras will be much easier to find compatible lenses and accessories for. If you plan to have multiple lenses for your film camera, and most people will want multiple lenses, then getting a popular camera is the way to go.\n\nGet a built in light meter if you can\n\nThis is not an absolute requirement, but for complete beginners to shooting with a 35mm film camera, a built in light meter will make setting your exposure significantly easier. This not only saves you time in learning your settings, it will also save you significant money in film. That is because you will have to shoot fewer shots to get the right exposure and I believe this will really accelerate the learning process.
