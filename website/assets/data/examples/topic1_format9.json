        "text":"Tattoo Fonts\n\nTattoo Fonts\n\nTattoo designs are now very popular. Are you planning to have letters and special characters tattooed? Remember that tattoos are permanent ink and so consider styles and tattoo fonts that are hip and cool. You can search the internet for cool and stylish fonts.\n\nThere are various new designs available and make a unique style. Tattoo fonts are an important factor to be considered while you input the design and characters. This is because it helps in establishing uniformity in the characters. However, while finalizing the design, you may make few samples and consult your tattoo expert artist; so that you can know the design that is hip now and suit the best tattoo design.\n\nSpeaking of tattoo fonts, the icy and fiery styles are most sought after styles. These are the popular designs and present a cool personality. It is eye catching. The hippest designs of tattoos are the ones with sharp, strong and icy fonts. Pick tattoos that will last for a long time in the fashion.\n\nHaving names tattooed represents characters and you can express your desire by having the name on your skin. The names can be of your loved ones who are no more as well or of a tribe revealing your loyalty. To be precise, a perfect tattoo is the one that does not go really with what others are thinking about you or the tattoo. It is your interest to bring out the meaning of it. You can make the tattoo design and the font special to suit your feelings.\n\nKanji Japanese calligraphy tattoo fonts are highly popular. This Kanji is in two styles, Sosho and Mincho Kanji. Sosho Kanji is modern and cursive Kanji style, while the Minco Kanji is same as English Times New Roman style. Yet, before choosing a tattoo, understand the perfect meaning and get unique fonts.",

        "text":"Are you a member? Register or Login\n\nOpen Menu\n\n10 Simple Steps to Refresh Your Instagram Account\n\nTaylor Swift did it. She deleted her Instagram account before re-emerging with a newly refreshed persona. The tactic was part of a campaign for her new album release, but shows a good point: sometimes your accounts just need a refresh.\n\nYou can learn more about how Swift did it, or take on a personal challenge to refresh your Instagram account. It\u2019s easier than you might think. (Once you get over the mental block of changing the way you post photos, anyway.)\n\nHere\u2019s how you can refresh your Instagram account in 10 simple steps (and maybe even feel as diva as Taylor Swift in the process).\n\n1. Become an Expert\n\n\nWhen planning an Instagram refresh, the first step is to think about who (and what) you want to be and be known for on the social media channel. Do you want to be known as a designer or maker? Curate images on Instagram that showcase that ability.\n\nIt comes down to how you plan to use the tool. Is it for personal or professional purposes? Are you trying to sell services or merchandise? (Or maybe a mix of everything?)\n\nTweak your profile information to say who and what you are and what\u2019s important to you. Include a URL to your website. While Instagram isn\u2019t the best place to create conversions, it can help you build a brand following. The first step is to establish what you want that brand to be.\n\n2. Pick a Signature App or Filter\n\n\nWhether you plan to post photo or video or a little of each, pick a go-to app or filter. From Instagram\u2019s own Hyperlapse or Boomerang to other add-ons, there are plenty of ways to add a little something extra to posts.\n\nThen consider using a signature filter every time. This consistent strategy helps establish professionalism and lets followers know what to expect from you. (Looking for the perfect filter? Try popular options Mayfair, Inkwell, Amaro, Walden and Lo-Fi, which tend to generate the most likes.\n\n3. Make It Personal, But Not Too Personal\n\n\nDesigners who use Instagram should include a good showcase of graphic elements, but it can be a little personal too. Users would rather interact with other people than brands. Consider using a photo as a profile image and mix in photos of work with real life.\n\nBe real and authentic. Should work in progress or mishaps and elements of life that happen as a designer. (We know it\u2019s not all beautiful posters and five-star projects.)\n\n4. Image Quality is Everything\n\n\nIf the image is not of top quality, don\u2019t post it. Nothing will ruin your Instagram profile like poor quality images. Every image needs to be sharp, in focus and amazing every time.\n\nOtherwise, don\u2019t post.\n\n5. Find a Routine\n\n\nWhile many of the algorithms mix up posts, users still like to have an idea of when they will see images from you. Set a routine for posting \u2013 daily, every other day, etc. \u2013 so that you stay in the feeds of followers and on their minds.\n\nPart of that routine might also include actual interactions with followers. Respond positively to comments and messages. Just posting and falling off the grid won\u2019t help develop the social conversation that this platform is designed for.\n\n6. Jump on Relevant Hastags\n\n\nHashtags can be your friend. Use them well.\n\nSounds easy, right? It can be a little tricky. To avoid hashtag disaster, stick to one or two hashtags (maximum!) per post. And they need to be relevant. If you post an image from yesterday with #tbt, you\u2019ll feel like a fraud; post a project from college for success.\n\nMix it up as well. Use common hashtags to interact with the #design and #webdesign community, but follow and use trending elements if they are relevant as well (#nofilter is always a win if you get just the right image and post raw).\n\n7. Like, Follow and Chat, But Don\u2019t Troll\n\n\nGrowing your Instagram brand includes following, liking and engaging with other designers on the platform. (This post includes 10 great accounts to follow if you want to start engaging right away.) The network connects you to other similar Instagram users; the bigger the network, the more suggestions and linkages you will make.\n\nBut don\u2019t be a jerk. There are enough trolls on social media already. Engage in positive and useful conversations. If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all.\n\n8. Pick a Palette\n\n\nMatch your Instagram design aesthetic to your personal tastes with a go-to color palette or photo style.\n\nAnthony Burrill, above, does this masterfully with a curated typography showcase on white backgrounds. Users will come recognize the \u201cbrand\u201d of photography when his work appears in their feeds.\n\n9. Think In Keywords\n\n\nWhile Instagram is a visual medium, it does include text. Make sure to include well-written descriptions for photos and use keywords relevant to you and your work.\n\nKeep a list of top keywords that are important to you, if necessary. Think about keywords that can help you expand your repertoire as well. Not only is Instagram a good place to show off your current projects and style, it\u2019s also a playground to help you develop, learn new things and become who you aspire to be as a designer.\n\n10. Be Yourself\n\n\nJust be yourself. If you are quirky, that should show on Instagram in the photo style you choose to display. Authenticity is the key to finding the most success \u2013 and having the most fun \u2013 on social media channels.\n\nOther users are most likely to connect if you are who you are. The design world is wide open on Instagram and you are sure to find plenty of like-minded designers to connect with. Be open, honest and real to find your tribe.\n\n\nThe reality of finding success on any social media channel is that it can take a lot of work and even more luck. Don\u2019t expect your favorite image to go viral overnight just because you like it.\n\nIt takes time to earn a following and Instagram is unique in that there\u2019s not a lot of call-to-action directed traffic. It really is rooted in small interactions. But you can curate an account that showcases your design style and projects and helps cement your place in the Instagram design community.",

indirect light will give you great results.\u00a0 My best photo studio is the top of our hot tub on the patio.\u00a0 In the afternoon there is great light and the hot tub cover makes for a perfect surface to hold all my stuff.\u00a0 A TV tray or card table are other possible options.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use props to accompany your items.\n\nCheck out various Etsy shops and you\u2019re sure to find that many times, sellers use props in their photos.\u00a0 It\u2019s a professional touch and as long as they don\u2019t overwhelm your item (or the photo in the general) they are a good thing.\u00a0 Live herbs make great props for handmade soap.\u00a0 A pin cushion or spools of thread look good next to fabric.\u00a0 A hand-knit scarf looks better wrapped around the neck of a real person or mannequin.\u00a0 Let\u2019s say you make the coolest aprons.\u00a0 Taking a picture of an apron folded up on a white background is, well, not too exciting.\u00a0 Give your buyers a good idea of what an apron will look like when it\u2019s tied around his\/her waist.\u00a0 Put it on, have someone take your picture.\u00a0 Or\u2026enlist the help of your boyfriend, girlfriend of kids.\u00a0 Be creative!\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use a background that makes your item stand out.\n\nA great photo has a great background.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had excellent luck by using a white tri-fold science fair\u00a0 \u00a0board.\u00a0 It\u2019s made from heavy poster board.\u00a0 It was cheap, folds flat for storage and (since it folds) I can have the short flap propped up to create a nice backdrop.\u00a0 I found it a teacher\u2019s supply store.\u00a0 They come in two sizes (I use the smaller one) and several different colors.\u00a0 White is best for me and will probably work just fine for you too.\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Take several shots from various angles.\n\nTaking photos from different angles will give your customers a better idea of what your item looks like.\u00a0 Since Etsy allows you five photos per listing, you will want to take advantage of all your available spots.\u00a0 Some of your photos should be full-size images of your item; but you might also want to include a close up shot or two.\u00a0 Showing the details of your item is important to prospective buyers.\u00a0 Mix things up a bit by having a straight-on shot as well as photos taken from the side or at a forty-five degree angle.\u00a0 I do this with my tissue holders and it works well.\u00a0 I also will sometimes include a photo of multiple tissue holders in a stack, or in a wicker basket, to give my customers an idea of the other items for sale.\u00a0 Again:\u00a0 be creative.\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use a photo editor to improve your images.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve taken several shots of your items, run them through a photo editor to make them as professional-looking as possible.\u00a0 You\u2019ll want to crop out unwanted background \u2018noise\u2019 and perhaps adjust the contrast.\u00a0 Be careful not to change the image so much that it no longer looks like the actual item.\u00a0 You might also want to add a copyright watermark to your image.\u00a0\u00a0 My favorite photo editor is Picnik ( no longer available).\u00a0 I\u2019ve used GIMP and Pixlr, but always return to Picnik and have great success with it.\n\nHave a specific question?\u00a0 Feel free to drop me a line at\u00a0 I\u2019ll be happy to help!\n\n\nTim here.. I just wanted to let you know about an AMAZING online product photography class over on Craftsy.\u00a0\u00a0 It is taught by Knitter and photographer Caro Sheridan.

Different spots in the house are going to give you different results. And..a sunny day vs. a cloudy day will make a big difference in your photos too.\n\n      Good luck. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find the right combination!\n\n      Thanks for the comment!\n\n  5. Always looking for great photo tips\u2026although my photos are much improved from what they were, I still have a long way to go. Thanks for sharing!\n\n    \u2022 Karen -\n\n      You have a great-looking Etsy shop.\n\n      May I make two suggestions? (1) make sure all your listings have at least one full-size photo and; (2) more light in your photo sessions will make your colorful creations \u2018pop\u2019.\n\n      Thanks for the comment\u2026.I appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.\n\n  6. Thanks for the great photo tips. I plan to incorporate them into my photography ASAP!!\n\n    \u2022 Karen -\n\n      Thanks very much for the comment.\n\n      Your bibs are great. Perhaps a white background will make them stand out a bit more. And more light (no flash please) will help your photos too.\n\n      I found a really inexpensive kid-sized mannequin on eBay awhile back. E-mail me if you\u2019re interested in the details. It would work perfectly with your bibs. And\u2026they will make your shop look even more professional.\n\n      Thanks again for the feedback. Hope you don\u2019t mind the suggestions. I like helping people!! :-)\n\n  7. Thank you for this, I struggle with photos, my work is of varied sizes, themes, some large pieces and I find it so hard to get cohesive shots. I purchased a used Olympus 500 DSLR camera, tripod and a macro lens,[plus a digital photography book] just painted a spare room with west-north light a neutral grey to dedicate to photo shoots.\n    Thanks for the tips and if you ever do a post for bigger pieces and props I will read for sure.\n\n    \u2022 Brenda \u2013 Thanks for the comment!\n\n      Larger pieces can be tougher to photograph, most because of the space needed to stage them. But\u2026it sounds like you have that handled with your new photo-shoot room (I\u2019m jealous!)\n\n      You might consider building a sturdy frame and hanging a white queen- or king-sized bed sheet from it. That might be an option for the background of you photos. Of course\u2026you can simply change the background by changing the sheet.\n\n      Thrift shops are a great place to pick up used linens for next to nothing. And\u2026they are also great places to find props to include with your items.\n\n      Best of luck to you!\n\n  8. As an editor of 18 years and someone who has seen plenty of products with passionate people behind them fail and other so-so services get all of the attention, I can attest that the difference is usually as simple as the picture they present editors. Nice article. Check out my new book, Recipe for Press, where I devote an entire chapter on the Power of the Picture, with a long Q&A with Amy Butler and her husband, longtime photographer, David Butler.\n\n    \u2022 Amy \u2013 Thanks for the comment\u2026and the kind words. I will certainly check out your new book.\n\n      Mr. and Mrs. Butler make a great team don\u2019t they? I love their stuff.\n\n      Thanks again,\n\n  9. I would like to know what is meagapixel and optical zoom. WHat one should keep in mind when buying new digital camera .\n    Thanks a lot for the detail explanation about each terms related to \u2013 what to keep in mind while clicking picture.\n\n  10. HI!\n    this is very helpful. i have a question, i have been using VERY busy backgrounds, but i think they work well with the pieces and the over-all look of my shop. i keep wondering if i should change this to solid white however?\n    if anyone has a moment to check out my shop and give me feedback on this it would be greatly appreciated\u2026\n\n    thanks so much!!\n\n    \u2022 Laurel \u2013 Thanks for the comment!\n\n     ...

        "text":"5 reasons to learn calligraphy\n\n  1. Calligraphy has a relaxing effect.\n\nIt can be very relaxing to sit down with a cup of tea, some music and pen, and ink, and fill pages with pages.\n\nThe direct, haptic connection to the materials is something very beneficial. In addition, repetition can actually soothe the nerves. Whoever practices must not achieve anything special, is only there at the moment, and that is as good as it is.\n\n\n  1. The possibilities are almost endless\n\nAfter you have mastered the basic techniques and mastered them, you might want to experiment with new tools, which is also a lot of fun. There are many ways to experiment with calligraphy, from obscure feathers and historical inks to fine paper types and unusual writing surfaces like chalkboards - all this is possible with calligraphy.\n\n\n  1. We see immediate results\n\nUnlike many other things you can do yourself, you hardly need time to write a word. You will receive the immediate reward with your hands. Knitting or woodworking are wonderful crafts, but they can take a long time. Writing a word in calligraphy, even one with many ornaments, can be done in 15 seconds.\n\nOf course, you have to practice to achieve great results, but this will be faster than you think, as practicing is great fun.\n\n\n  1. Handwriting has become rare\n\nWe live in a world where crafts are increasingly disappearing, and people long for handmade things that require much skill and attention. Calligraphy is often described as \"lost art\". Writing is not even taught in many schools\n\n\n  1. Calligraphy is not expensive\n\nIt is easy to catch with calligraphy. A basic equipment for calligraphy costs under $20.",

Her simple and powerful strokes stood out and immediately demanded our attention, before we could even \u201esee\u201c the picture itself. One can describe it like a friendly but still forceful annexation, visually and mentally. With her first solo exhibition Gina Malek will show a new body of work. And to say the least, we are excited about how the artist explores themes of confinement, the mechanics of the remembered self, and the impermanence of memory. Giving importance to the most common daily routines, Malek beautifully catches moments of intimacy and authenticity touching the viewer and at the same time giving them space to deepen into the subjects.\n\nMagic Beans Gallery once more proves their sharp eye for young emerging artists and their talent to support them and to give each one a surprisingly unique frame.\n\nMagic Beans Gallery, Auguststra\u00dfe 86, 10117 Berlin\n\nFrank J.

One of our favorite positions in this groupshow with mixed-media comes from Berlin-based artist Frank Sch\u00e4pel, who\u00b4s depicted celestial bodies are lying beyond of the range of the naked human eye. Therefore he was dependent on photographs taken by space probes like JAXA\u2019s Hayabusa. But he doesn\u00b4t view the asteroids and comets as foreign or absent realities, as we share the same space, galaxy and solar system. Through the presence of their painted images he is placing their physical reality into our cultural consciousness.

But the truly fascinating part is how many people through all classes, backgrounds and sex are united and connected through tattoos and bond through them. Seriously, is there anyone left without having one these days? It has become more than ever an unique and fierce way of expressing onself nevertheless some say it became to mainstream, to normal. We believe it shows in a powerful way how important it is for the individual to express itself, to communicate non-verbal and to feel to be your own special version of yourself and the power and freedom that comes with it when expressing this version and vision. It is therefore no wonder that GAT which translates: \u201eGr\u00fc\u00dfe Aus T\u00e4towierungen\u201c and their annual exhibition gets more popular every year and is an absolute Must See for art enthusiasts and tattoo lovers alike.

        "text":"#Instagood: My Top 5 Tips on Taking Better Photos with Your Smartphone\n\n\n#Instagood: My Top 5 Tips on Taking Better Photos with Your Smartphone\n\nSo I get a lot of feedback on social media (and sometimes even in person, lol), that some of you out there really dig the perspective, coloring and ambiance of my images. So I thought what better way to spread the joy this holiday season, than to share a little of my own personal recipe for success when it comes to taking & editing your images for Instagram. If you have a smartphone and an Instagram account, I\u2019ll give you a good road map for making your sharable moments a little #instabetter.\n\nFirst, in order to become #instagood (before you can get #instabetter) you need to start by taking a decent picture \u2013 all the editing in the world won\u2019t save a terrible image.\n\nHere are my top 5 tips for taking good images (we\u2019ll get to editing next week in Part 2).\n\nTip #1: HDR, baby.\n\nIf you have a modern smart phone, you probably have an option for HDR and I highly recommend that you use it. Now, this feature isn\u2019t necessarily a true HDR, but more of an auto-correct for poor or challenging lighting situations. Ever notice how you end up with really bright, blown-out highlights in direct sunlight or bright light? And what about that murky, grainy, black, fuzzy haze coving your images in low or ambient light? HDR will help mitigate the extremes of each of these scenarios. I\u2019m not sure about Andriod models, but if you have an iPhone, don\u2019t worry because you will get a regular exposure in addition to your HDR exposure. That way, you can choose the HDR or discard it. Use whichever image looks best.\n\nTip #2: Stand still, dammit!\n\nI mean it, please steady yourselves people! The biggest wet blanket I see across the sea of images that cover the interwebs is \u201cshake\u201d or blurry images as the result of moving while the shutter is open. Practice eliminating \u201cshake\u201d by being as still as possible and planting your elbows firmly against your core. If you can use a table or counter surface to rest your elbows, this helps a lot too. If you have a mini tripod, great, but if you don\u2019t, be extremely mindful of your balance and weight distribution. Use both hands and be perfectly still for 1-2 seconds *BEFORE AND AFTER* you hit the shutter button on your camera\/phone. Trust me, those few seconds pause will change your Instagram feed forever moving forward.\n\nTip #3: Get high, get low, get creative.\n\nI could write a whole article on this topic alone, but in the interest of keeping this short & sweet, I would just like to encourage you to push yourself to look at things differently. Experiment with angles, lighting, shapes, depth of field, perspective, color, etc. A lot of images look the same because a lot of people take photos from their eye-level, looking directly at what\u2019s in front of them. Change the perspective, move around, look up, look down, look through trees, fences, holes, puddles, reflections, etc. Don\u2019t be afraid to lay on the ground, get a little dirty or disheveled, or risk the possibility that someone might think you\u2019re weird for contorting your body into whatever position necessary to frame the perfect shot. Just don\u2019t step in front of moving traffic, lean too far off the observation deck of a tall building or get too close to a mama bear and her cubs(!)\u00a0 \ud83d\ude09\n\nTip #4: Stay away from filter \u201cpresets\u201d.\n\nBack in the day (like a year ago), preset filters were all we really had in Instagram, and for a while it was all the rage. But now, with the newer \u201cCustom settings\u201d menu, you can achieve a more professional looking result right in Instagram without putting a \u201cgeneric filter\u201d stamp all over your images (RIP Kelvin Brannan, 1977, Nashville).\n\nTip # 5: Crop & Straighten.\n\nUse the grid (in-camera and\/or in Instagram) and make sure your horizon is straight and that from the center of your image, vertical lines are straight as well. Unless you\u2019re going for a really exaggerated, intentional planar shift as a way of making a \u201ccreative statement\u201d, uneven lines and leaning horizons is down-right nauseating. Clean up your act, and get on the plane, Jane (nod to geometry).\n\nNow that you have an image that\u2019s in focus, properly exposed and thoughtfully composed, this is the jumping off point where you can really make your images soar. I\u2019ll tell you how next week in #Instabetter: Custom Settings = Creative Control.\n\nI hope you found this article helpful (or at least mildly entertaining). If you\u2019ve made it this far, come a step further and follow me (graphiknation) on Instagram, Flickr or Twitter. Or if you\u2019re in the Atlanta area, come shoot with me and the Atlanta Urban Photo Walkers sometime!\n\n\nI currently have an Apple iPhone 6 Plus, and in the past I have had iPhones 3, 4 & 5, all of which have shown up on my Instagram feed. When I shoot professional I use Mirrorless\/Micro Four Thirds format. I own a Panasonic Lumix G3, an Olympus Pen EP5, and I more recently purchased an even smaller Panasonic Lumix GM1, for times when I want to go really light weight. I have about 7 high quality micro 4\/3 lenses, mostly Lumix\/Panasonic brand, and one Olympus brand. I edit professionally in Adobe Lightroom & Adobe Photoshop. Some of my professional images show up in my Instagram feed, but many more of them can be seen on Flickr.\n\n\nShopping Cart",

        "text":"Bob Ross: 6 Interesting Facts and Happy Little Trees\n\nFrom Air Force Career to Art Instructor\n\nMany have heard of Bob Ross and perhaps tuned into his show The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS in the United States, and also aired in Canada, Latin America and Europe.\n\nBob Ross enlisted in the US Air Force at age 17\n\nPainting Paid More than the Military\n\nHowever before he became a famous painter did you know he had a long military career in the Air Force? Ross discovered that he was able to earn more from selling his artwork and own branded art supply line than his position in the Air Force. Ross retired from the Air Force after 20 years of service, having the rank of Master Sergeant.\n\nHappy Little Trees and Mountains \u2013 Inspiration from Alaska\n\nBob Ross typically painted mountains, lakes, snow, and log cabin scenes and these were strongly influenced by his years living in Alaska, where he was stationed for the majority of his Air Force career.\n\nWhy the Fast Painting Technique?\n\nShort breaks in his work schedule during the day did not give Bob enough time to work on landscapes leisurely. He had to work fast before his break ended!\n\n30,000 Paintings\n\nThrough his speed, and style he created 30,000 paintings in his lifetime. It\u2019s estimated that 91 percent of Ross\u2019 paintings contained at least one tree. Above is an unusual painting by Bob that does not contain a tree.\n\nIconic Hair\n\nBob actually permed his own hair to keep an easy style he didn\u2019t have to mess with. It evolved into a sort of iconic look for him. He wore the same look for years. Before he could change it back, though, the perm became his company\u2019s logo \u2014 Ross hated it. \u201cHe could never, ever, ever change his hair, and he was so mad about that,\u201d Kowalski says. \u201cHe got tired of that curly hair.\u201d\n\nJust for Fun \u2013 Funky Bob Ross Products to Buy (your purchase helps to support the cost of running this website)\n\nPlay the Bob Ross \u201cThe Art of Chill Board Game\u201d!\n\nThe Bob Ross Coloring Book\n\nBob Ross Collectable\n\nBob Ross was gentle soul who had a soothing voice that inspired many.\n\n\u201cThe secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.\u201d\u2028- Bob Ross\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
