The OSHA Recordkeeping Advisor is intended to help determine:\n\n  \u2022 Whether an injury or illness (or related event) is work-related\n  \u2022 Whether an event or exposure at home or on travel is work-related\n  \u2022 Whether an exception applies to the injury or illness\n  \u2022 Whether a work-related injury or illness needs to be recorded\n  \u2022 Which provisions of the regulations apply when recording a work-related case\n\nThe OSHA Recordkeeping Advisor presents questions and relies on responses to determine the appropriate course of action. The Advisor does not store any information. If the Advisor does not address the circumstances of a particular case, please contact OSHA or obtain expert advice.\n\nSome employers may be exempt from OSHA\u2019s recordkeeping rules, for example those with 10 or fewer employees during the previous calendar year and those classified in specific industries. If you are unsure whether your company or business is covered by the requirements, please see, OSHA\u2019s regulations at 29 CFR 1904.1, Partial exemption for employers with 10 or fewer employees; 29 CFR 1904.2, Partial exemption for establishments in certain industries; and 29 CFR 1904.3, Keeping records for more than one agency; and Appendix A (the list of industries). Employers in States with OSHA-approved State plans should contact their States for information on State-specific exemptions. In addition, public sector employers in these States are subject to State recordkeeping regulations.\n\nWhile using this Advisor, please remember that you should treat incidents such as any cut, laceration, needlestick, splash with bodily fluid, or exposure to tuberculosis as an injury or illness. (The Advisor addresses \u201cprivacy concern cases\u201d as needed.) Furthermore, a Standard Threshold Shift (STS) in hearing in one or both ears, any significant diagnosed injuries and illnesses, and cases involving medical removal under an OSHA standard should be considered injuries or illnesses for the purposes of this Advisor.\n\nThe OSHA Recordkeeping Advisor is written in plain language and intended to assist employers, especially small business employers, in understanding their recordkeeping requirements under OSHA regulations. It is not, however, a substitute for the OSHA Recordkeeping Rules 29 CFR 1904, the OSHA Recordkeeping Handbook or for the OSHA Recordkeeping Related Letters of Interpretation. For those who wish to read exact regulatory language, links are provided throughout the Advisor where appropriate.",

The Supreme Court requires the executor of the will to prove and register the last will and testament of a deceased person.\n\nAt Waters Lawyers, we understand the passing of a loved one is a difficult and emotional experience. As the executor or administrator of an estate, it is your role to distribute the estate as per your loved one\u2019s wishes in accordance with the law. We have decades of experience advising and acting on behalf of executors and administrators and are dedicated to supporting you to ensure you do not feel any extra strain.\n\nA solicitor is typically instructed to assist in this process by completing the legal work involved. For most estates, a grant of probate is required which is formal approval by the Court to administer an estate. This is typically obtained by an application to a Registrar of the Supreme Court to prove various facts, including the final will and the assets and liabilities. When probate has been granted, the executor is able to distribute the estate according to the will.\n\nOur extensive knowledge and experience, coupled with our integrity, mean we are dedicated to supporting you and your family through the process. In addition to obtaining grants of probate and letters of administration, we can also help you administer the estate, transfer assets and make distributions to beneficiaries. In the event we have not prepared the will, the will is not valid or legally binding, there are multiple wills or there is no will at all, we can alleviate the stress of the situation and guide you through the process.

We will do everything we can to get you the best deal possible \u2013 and we are very, very good at it too.\n\n\nWhat is a Settlement Agreement?\n\nThey are more common than you think \u2013 but because the terms and existence of the Agreement are confidential, you won\u2019t usually hear of someone receiving one.\n\nA Settlement Agreement (or Compromise Agreement as they used to be known) is a legally binding contract between you and your employer. They are usually used to settle a claim or a dispute to stop it going any further \u2013 but they are also common where there is a voluntary redundancy situation or where an employer \u00a0wants to be protected when someone is leaving with an exit package. There doesn\u2019t always need to be a dispute \u2013 you could be leaving on good terms.\n\nYou will usually receive a lump sum and an agreed reference as part of the settlement.\n\n\nWhy do I need advice from a solicitor?\n\nIt\u2019s the law. Without evidence that you have had independent legal advice, your employer won\u2019t have to pay you the settlement because the agreement won\u2019t be binding.\n\nContact us as soon as a Settlement Agreement is mentioned. We are very good at what we do and have the experience to get you the best deal possible.\n\nOnce you sign the agreement there is no going back to negotiate for more, so you need to have confidence your adviser knows what they are doing and that the deal you are accepting is the best you can get. If it\u2019s not in your interests to sign, we\u2019ll be honest and tell you so at the start.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore really important that you get advice from an expert who knows what claims for compensation you have and how valuable they are, so you can make an informed decision about whether to accept the Settlement Agreement offer.\n\nWe\u2019d like to talk to you to see what we can do to help, so please, call us anytime for free on 08000 614 631 or use the online form below to get in touch.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of a Settlement Agreement?\n\n  \u2022 You will receive a lump sum \u2013 up to \u00a330,000 could be tax-free.\n  \u2022 An agreed reference will help you find work without the worry of what your employer might otherwise say.\n  \u2022 Everything is confidential. This keeps your reputation intact even if you were facing disciplinary action.\n  \u2022 You avoid the risk, expense, stress and delay of going to Tribunal\n  \u2022 They offer a clean break for everyone.\n\nYour employer has the guarantee that you will not take them to an Employment Tribunal.\n\n\nWhen are they offered?\n\nThe most common situation is to head off a potential claim against your employer. Perhaps you have raised a grievance or have left work and threatened Tribunal proceedings.\n\nThey are increasingly being used in redundancy situations to avoid lengthy and expensive consultation \u2013 especially where more than 20 jobs are at risk or when your employer offers to pay you \u00a0more than your basic Statutory Redundancy Pay. Signing a Settlement Agreement is often a condition of your application for voluntary redundancy being accepted.\n\nYour employer may offer you a settlement as an alternative to facing a disciplinary hearing or investigation. An offer might be made when the allegations are first put to you, during or even at the end of the disciplinary process.\n\nIf your employer is unhappy with your standard of work, rather than go through a lengthy performance improvement plan or procedure, they may decide to offer you an alternative \u2013 to leave earlier in exchange for a settlement payment.\n\nShould you be unable to work because of a long-term illness, your employer may prefer to avoid a long, drawn out capability procedure that might end in dismissal. It means they can plan ahead, and you can leave with dignity. We can advise you on ill-health retirement as part of the package.\n\nSometimes the working relationship just isn\u2019t working \u2013 no matter how much everyone wants it to succeed. There might not be anyone to blame, but both sides may prefer amicable parting on good terms.\n\nYou can take the initiative \u2013 a proposal doesn\u2019t have to come from your employer \u2013 but when and how to ask for a negotiated exit takes experience and skill. We can explain your options and negotiate the best deal possible.\n\n\nI have been made an offer. Should I accept?\n\nIt depends on the offer \u2013 how much it is, what strings are attached, the strength of any claim you have and what you might win if you take your complaint to an Employment Tribunal. We\u2019ll assess your case and give you easy to understand advice on what your options are and whether the offer should be improved upon.\n\nIt isn\u2019t always about how much money is being offered. It is a big part of the deal, but there is much more to the settlement. We will always check your contract, discuss what you want out of the Agreement and build it into our advice as part of the service. This might include:\n\n  \u2022 Agreeing a reasonable reference to help you get a job. We can help write a better one and negotiate for it to be included.\n  \u2022 Making sure all the payments, monies and benefits you are entitled to are covered \u2013 your salary, accrued holidays, bonuses, commission payments, shares, SAYE, private health cover, company car or car allowance. This is important because usually an Agreement will be in \u2018full and final settlement\u2019, meaning any payments or benefits not covered will be lost.\n  \u2022 How do you want your departure announced (if at all)? We can negotiate on internal or external announcements to colleagues and customers. If there is no announcement, what will your customers assume is the reason for you leaving?\n  \u2022 What about tax? There may be scope to change the clauses dealing with which payments are tax free.\n  \u2022 If your employment contract includes post-termination restrictions which make it difficult for you secure new work, we can try to get them shortened or even waived.\n\nOnly you can decide whether to accept the offer or not, but with our expert advice, you will know exactly where you stand and what to do.\n\nIf you want us to negotiate on your behalf, we will do that too \u2013 and it won\u2019t cost you anything more.\n\n\nI\u2019m happy with the offer and need a solicitor to sign it off. What next?\n\nJust get in contact. Phone us anytime, for free on 08000 614 631 or use the online form here. We will check the Agreement and make absolutely sure you are getting everything you are entitled to. It can all be done by telephone, email, skype or face to face at a time that is convenient to you.\n\nIf signing the Agreement is urgent, we\u2019ll make sure it is a priority for us too.\n\n\nI\u2019m not happy with the offer. Can you help?\n\nWe\u2019ll advise you on the terms and how reasonable the offer is and do our best to get you a better deal. The stronger your claim, the more likely it is that your employer will negotiate and increase their offer.\n\nOnly you can decide whether to accept the offer or not, but with our expert advice you will know exactly where you stand and what to do. If you want us to negotiate on your behalf, we will do that too.\n\n\nWho pays for the work you do for me?\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to pay a penny. It is normal for your employer to make a contribution towards the cost. The amount can vary but we don\u2019t think you should ever have to pay anything, so we always guarantee to limit our costs to your employer\u2019s contribution.\n\nEven if it takes more of our time to get you the best deal than your employer is willing to pay for, we will never ask you to make up the difference. \u00a0\u00a0We will invoice your employer after the Settlement Agreement is concluded.\n\n\nFREE first advice\n\nHave you ever wanted to just ask an expert employment law solicitor if they can help you, without worrying about what it may cost to contact them?\n\nGet in touch\n\nWe\u2019d like to talk to you to see what we can do to help, so please either call us anytime for free on 08000 614 631, email us or use the form below\n\nTogether we can work out what your next steps might confidence, at no cost and with no obligation.\n\n\n* indicates required\nMcCabe and Co Solicitors will use the information you provide on this form to be in touch with you and to provide updates and marketing.

        "text":"\nWith FREE Legal Aid We'll Help You Reduce or Eliminate Your Fine - No Cost\nContact us\nWhat Happens if I Don\u2019t Pay a Court Fine?\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t pay or refuse to pay a court fine?\n\nHow is the amount of a fine decided?\n\nUp until March 2015 the maximum fine that the judge of a Magistrates\u2019 Court was allowed to give was \u00a35,000. That ceiling has since been removed allowing, in most cases, the fine to be of an unlimited sum.\n\nThe amount is determined by various Magistrates\u2019 Court rules; your financial status has an impact on the figure as does the type of offence for which you are convicted.\n\nThe penalty element of the fine (not the court costs or compensation elements) will even be reduced in light of a guilty plea but is itself determined by when the offender admits their guilt. For instance, if they admitted guilt at their earliest opportunity following the accusation the penalty may be reduced by one third.\n\nYour ability to pay\n\nAlong with a summons ordering you to attend a means enquiry hearing you will receive a Means Enquiry Form (MC100). You\u2019re legally obliged to complete this and must present it to the Court in order for the Court to measure its fine accordingly.\n\nAfter all, levying a large fine against someone on a low income will not benefit anyone and will only lead to an increase in unpaid court fines.\n\nThe nature and seriousness of the offence\n\nThe Court first uses statutory guidelines to work out what level of fine is appropriate for the crime. The Court will consider:\n\n  \u2022 Which sentencing thresholds have been crossed\n  \u2022 The offender\u2019s culpability in committing the offence\n  \u2022 The effect of aggravating and mitigating factors\n  \u2022 A reduction of the sentence for a guilty plea\n  \u2022 The need for ancillary orders, including compensation\n\n(Sentencing Council, 2017)\n\nAfter the trial\n\nAfter you have been sentenced and your trial is closed the Court will send to you a copy of something called a \u2018collection order\u2019. This order is discussed during the trial as well and outlines what happens next. In short, the process following the hearing is as follows:\n\n  \u2022 The collection order is sent to you after the case is closed\n  \u2022 You are offered the chance to pay in instalments or you may be ordered to pay an amount within 10 days. The order will also include details of how to pay.\n\nMissed payments\n\nIf, after your trial, you realise you can\u2019t pay your fine either by the arranged instalments or in full you must contact the sentencing Court\u2019s fines officer ASAP. In some places the fines officer works independently of the Court House but in either case you will find their contact details on your collection order.\n\nYou will be asked to explain why you can\u2019t pay the amount set by the Court and if necessary your circumstances will be re-assessed. But if the fines officer doesn\u2019t consider there to be sufficient reason for you to renege on your payments they will refuse your request for a review.\n\nYou can appeal the decision of the fines officer using the Magistrates\u2019 Court rules\n\nwith the help of our team of solicitors at Leslie Franks.\n\nIf you don\u2019t pay your fine on time for whatever reason, you will be considered in default and the Court will send a Further Steps Notice. This Notice demands you bring your account up to date within a set number of days. It will also ask you to make contact to explain why you have a missed court fine payment.\n\nUnpaid court fines warrant\n\nIf you still don\u2019t make contact, a Distress Warrant will be issued which is a way for the judge to enforce the payment of a fine. This issue results in one or more of the following:\n\n  \u2022 An enforcement order to take money directly from your wages or benefits\n  \u2022 The issue of a Warrant of Control to an out-sourced bailiff company\n  \u2022 The registration of the fine (adding the fine to your credit history for five years)\n  \u2022 An order to clamp your vehicle with a view to the court selling it\n\nThe Court will use its powers to punish you further for the unpaid court fine, especially if it hasn\u2019t heard from you. In the most serious cases of non-payment and after every avenue is exhausted a judge can send you to prison. However, this will come after at least one further hearing when you will be given an opportunity to more fully explain your reasons.\n\nWhat if I can\u2019t afford to pay?\n\nIn order to make a case for rearranging a payment plan to suit your circumstances you will need to show evidence of your income and outgoings, and evidence of how the court\u2019s fine has left you with little money for other priority debts.\n\nIt is best to try to convince the judge during the trial that you have a genuine reason for being unable to pay, but after the trial is ended your claim of unforeseen hardship can be helped along by the mention of one of the following:\n\n  \u2022 Redundancy\n  \u2022 The breakdown of a relationship\n  \u2022 The death of a close relative\n  \u2022 The birth of your child\n  \u2022 Serious illness\n  \u2022 Other reasons for a drop in income\n\nWhat if I refuse to pay?\n\nIf you consider the fine to be unlawful or the case against you to be flawed, you should dispute the case in accordance with the Magistrates\u2019 Court rules.\n\nFor this you will require the help of Leslie Franks\u2026our helpline is open 24 hours a day: 0800 6127 128.\n\nIf you\u2019ve received a court summons for unpaid Court fine or you cannot afford to pay, contact us immediately.

        "text":"Homelessness applications\n\nThis fact sheet is aimed primarily at people who are, or may become, homeless and may be considering making a complaint to the Ombudsman.\n\nI am homeless or will become homeless soon and the council is not dealing with my application properly. Can the Ombudsman help me?\n\nYes in some circumstances. We can consider your complaint if you have told a council you are homeless or threatened with homelessness, and you think it has made a mistake in dealing with your application and this is the reason you have not found alternative accommodation, or it has caused you other problems.\n\nWe cannot overturn a decision made by a council on your homelessness application. For example, if the council has written to tell you that you are not homeless, or not in a priority need group, and it has no duty to find you somewhere to live, we would usually expect you to use the review and appeal procedure to challenge that decision.\n\nWe would also expect you to use the review and appeal procedure for certain decisions including:\n\n  \u2022 the council's decision to bring its prevention or relief duty to an end\n  \u2022 the council's decision you have deliberately and unreasonably refused to co-operate\n  \u2022 the steps the council will take to help you, which itlists in your personalised housing plan\n\nHow do I complain?\n\nYou should normally complain to the council first. Councils often have more than one stage in their complaints procedure and you will usually have to complete all stages before we will look at your complaint.\n\nThen, if you are unhappy with the outcome, or the council is taking too long to look into the matter \u2013 we think 12 weeks is reasonable \u2013 you can complain to us.\u00a0\n\nYou should normally make your complaint to us within 12 months of realising that the council has done something wrong.\n\nFor more information on how to complain, visit our contact us page\u00a0or\u00a0complete an online complaint form.\n\nIt is important that we can keep in contact if you have no permanent address and you move around. If you give us a mobile telephone number or email address that will make it much easier for us to keep in touch with you.\n\nIf you consider my complaint what will the Ombudsman look for?\n\nWe have to decide whether the council has done something wrong in the way it handled your application and whether this has caused you a problem. Some of the issues we can look at are if the council:\n\n  \u2022 does not let you make a homelessness application or fails to recognise that your request should be treated as a homelessness application\n  \u2022 fails to make proper enquiries or makes unreasonable requests for you to provide evidence before it agrees to look at your application\n  \u2022 does not ask\u00a0Children's Services to help assess your needs if you are 16 or 17 years old and you make a homelessness application\n  \u2022 breached the law that says the maximum time a family with children can stay in bed and breakfast accommodation with shared facilities is six weeks\n  \u2022 does not give you information and advice on things such as preventing homelessness, your rights and the council's duties, and what help is available\n  \u2022 does not agree a personalised housing plan with you, or does not review that plan when things change\n  \u2022 does not provide support to prevent you becoming homeless when you are threatened with homelessness, or to help you find accommodation if you are already homeless\n  \u2022 takes far too long to deal with your application and reach a decision\n  \u2022 wrongly closes your application or treats it as having been withdrawn\n  \u2022 fails to provide you with interim accommodation while it makes enquiries, if it has reason to believe you may be homeless and in priority need\n  \u2022 places you in unsuitable interim accommodation while it makes enquiries into your application, or fails to deal with repair problems in your temporary accommodation\n  \u2022 loses, damages or destroys your personal belongings while they are in storage or fails to help you protect your possessions, and\n  \u2022 fails to give you a written decision on your application and does not tell you about your legal right to ask for a review or an appeal.\n\nWhat happens if the Ombudsman finds the council was at fault?\n\nIf we find that the council did something wrong in the way it handled your application, and that you were affected by this, we will ask the council to review the application and correct its mistakes. For example if the council:\n\n  \u2022 did not make proper enquiries and so it misunderstood your true circumstances, we would ask it to take steps to put this right and to apologise to you, or\n  \u2022 has taken too long to make enquiries and reach a decision on your homelessness application, we will ask it to complete its enquiries and issue a decision promptly.\u00a0\n\nHowever, there will be times when a homeless person suffers real hardship because of a council\u2019s mistake and the clock cannot be turned back to put this right. For example, we may find that someone was homeless and in priority need but the council did not arrange temporary accommodation, and so he or she had to sleep rough instead. In these circumstances, we are likely to ask the council to make a payment.\n\nThe facts will be different in each complaint and we consider each case carefully to decide on a remedy.\n\nSometimes we find that a council\u2019s policy and procedures for dealing with homelessness applications are flawed or that officers have not been given proper training and guidance. We may recommend that the council reviews its procedures or arranges training for staff so that other homeless people do not go through the problems you have experienced.\n\nExamples of some complaints we have considered\n\nMr B experienced a spinal cord injury and spent some time in hospital. Mr B told the council that his home would no longer be suitable for him, as he would now need a wheelchair, and he would therefore be homeless when the hospital discharged him. The council delayed making enquiries and told Mr B he would have to visit its offices, travelling from hospital, for it to take a homelessness application. This caused Mr B significant inconvenience and discomfort. The council took two months to make a decision about what duty it owed to him, causing Mr B uncertainty, and it told him it owed the wrong duty because it did not recognise he was already homeless. The council delayed arranging emergency temporary accommodation for Mr B, so he had to stay in hospital longer than necessary. When it arranged temporary accommodation, it was not suitable for Mr B as a wheelchair-user and he experienced significant loss of dignity. The council did not find him alternative accommodation until it found him a permanent home four months later. The council agreed to apologise and pay Mr B \u00a32,150. It also agreed to review Mr B\u2019s case and make changes to procedures and staff training to reduce the chances of the same faults happening again.\nMiss B and her partner were given notice to leave their private rented property. They told the council they would become homeless, and it wrote a personalised housing plan for them and gave them advice. Miss B then separated from her partner and left the private rented property with her son before the notice ran out. The council updated her personalised housing plan and told her it now owed her a different duty (the \u2018relief duty\u2019) because she had become homeless. However, it then did not take steps to help Miss B secure accommodation, so it did not meet that duty. It put all the responsibility on Miss B to find her own accommodation, and she ended up asking another council to help her. We decided Miss X had suffered distress and uncertainty. The council agreed to apologise, pay Miss B \u00a3400 and create an action plan to show how it would make sure it did not repeat the same errors.\n\nOther sources of information\n\nIf you are in a crisis and you need immediate practical help or advice on your legal rights you can contact Shelter who run a free national telephone advice line (0808 800 4444) and have a network of housing aid centres across England \u2013 you can find out more at www.shelter.org.uk.\n\nLaw centres, Citizens Advice Bureaux and independent housing advice centres may also be able to help you.\n\nThe Civil Legal Advice telephone number is 0345 345 4345.\n\nOur fact sheets give some general information about the most common type of complaints we receive but they cannot cover every situation.

If you need help removing graffiti from your property, please contact the Graffiti Abatement Team\u200b at 503-371-4264.\n\n\u200b\u200bRemove with paint\n\nPaint is generally used for walls and buildings.\n\n  \u2022 Cover the entire surface. Match your new paint to the original color if possible. If not possible, repaint the entire surface or square area. For example, paint the entire fence board(s) rather than just cover the graffiti.\n\n  \u2022 Prepare the surface by cleaning, drying, and sanding if necessary. If several coats of paint have already been applied, sanding may be necessary to remove old paint.\n\n  \u2022 Select the right paint for your surface. Acrylic latex is best for wood, concrete, block walls, and brick. Call your local paint specialist for advice if you are unsure.\n\nReuse your paint brushes. If you are working on a continual problem, you can put the roller or brush in a plastic bag, or wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator. It will last for months. If you are using a 5 gallon bucket and the roller will fit, leave the roller in the bucket and reseal it.\n\nIf you use paint to remove graffiti, be sure to select the right paint for the job, clean and prepare the surface thoroughly, and cover the entire area.\n\nRemove with s\u200band or water blasting and pressure washing\n\nPressure washing is generally used for unpainted concrete surfaces like curbs and cinderblock walls.\n\n  \u2022 Start with the gentlest setting first, because damage can easily occur.\n\n  \u2022 Follow the recommendations for historic buildings.\n\nRemove with \u200b\u200bche\u200b\u200bmical p\u200broducts\u200b\n\nChemical products are generally used for metal and aluminum poles, boxes, and signs.\n\n  \u2022 Make sure the cleaner is appropriate for the graffiti agent and affected surfaces.\n\n  \u2022 The solution should not leave residue or film that will damage the affected surfaces.\n\nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s specifications to avoid dangers to your health and affected surfaces.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nRemoval tips for t\u200b\u200brees, sidewalks, and vehicles\u200b\n\n\nWash the tree with a garden hose. Do not use lacquer thinner or paint. You might apply mineral spirits and let it sit for five to 10 minutes, and then wash with water. Contact a nursery for other suggestions.\u200b\n\n\nUse a wire brush. If that doesn\u2019t work, try lacquer thinner or pressure washing. Clean one square at a time.\u200b\n\n\nUse a solvent-based cleaner that can be obtained from hardware or home improvement stores. Be aware that these cleaners are likely to remove the wax from your vehicle\u2019s paint as well as the graffiti.\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAdditional information\n\nContact us\n\nGraffiti Abatement TeamPolice Department\n555 Liberty St SE RM 130\nSalem OR 97301\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected] Attach a photo of the graffiti, if available.\n503-371-4264Leave your name, your telephone number, and the location and description of the graffiti.\nFollow us\n\nGraffiti Busters provide product discounts\n\n\u200b\u200bThe Salem Police Department, Keizer Police Department, and Marion County Sheriff's Office have partnered with local businesses to form the Graffiti Busters program. \u200b These businesses have agreed to provide discounts to victims of graffiti and assistance finding the best products for removal and prevention.\u200b\n\n  \u2022 \u200b\u200bACE Hardware (Madrona Hills)\n    \u2022 \u200b706 Madrona Ave. SE, Salem\u200b\n  \u2022 Fred Meyer\n    \u2022 \u200b3740 Market St. NE, Salem\n    \u2022 3450 Commercial St. SE, Salem\n    \u2022 2855 Broadway St. NE, Salem\n  \u2022 The Home Depot\n    \u2022 3795 Hagers Grove Rd.
