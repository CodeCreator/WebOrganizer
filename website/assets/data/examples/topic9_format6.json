It provides an overview of US consumers' demographics, behaviors, and technology attitudes by life stage. The document includes five-year forecasts on the technology adoption of PCs, Internet, broadband, high-definition televisions (HDTVs), home networks, and DVRs. Highlights from the consumer data show that HDTVs and home networks are the two fastest-growing technologies in 2008; that media consumption is split evenly between traditional and new media among all Americans, but young consumers spend almost 2 hours more with new media; and that four in five US households now have a mobile phone, but mobile Internet uptake shows slow progress.\n    US $ 2495\n    Become A Client\n\n    Get objective, pragmatic guidance that helps you make tough decisions and succeed in a complex world.\u00a0Contact us to learn more.\n\n    Already A Client?\n    Log in to read this document.\n\n\n    \u2022 Technology Adoption Differs With Age And Family Status\n      \u2022 The Five-Year Forecast For Devices And Access\n      \u2022 Tech Adoption Differs With Age And Family Status\n      \u2022 Devices: Families Lead The Gadget Charge\n      \u2022 Media: Older Families Straddle Old And New Media\n      \u2022 Television: Families Go For Digital\n      \u2022 Online: Young Consumers Go Online In More Places\n      \u2022 Marketing: Young Singles And Couples Dig Social\n      \u2022 The PC Market: Families Dominate In Desktops\n      \u2022 Digital Home: Older Families Win \"Most Wired\" Award\n      \u2022 Mobile: Older Families Have The Most Phones\n      \u2022 Gaming: Consoles Are For Families\n    \u2022 Using The Data: 40,545 Households, 47,946 Adults, And 378 US Brands\n    \u2022 Supplemental Material",

        "text":"Binge TV Viewers are More Receptive of Ads, Study Finds\n\nNetflix , Inc and Hulu are making it easier for consumers to indulge in hours-long sessions of their favorite TV show. Where does that leave advertisers?\n\nNew research from Annalect, Omnicom Media Group's marketing technology platform, found that 58% of binge viewers enjoy watching at least three episodes of a show in one sitting because they don't have to watch ads.\n\nThe good news for marketers is that the study also found that viewers are willing to tolerate ads under the right circumstances. More than a third of binge-viewers said they wouldn't mind seeing ads while binge-viewing if it lowered their subscription rate and over a third also said ads provide a nice break during binge-viewing.\n\n\"Many consumers understand that there is a value equation, so if they're getting to watch on their own terms, they have to sit through ads,\" said Annalect's U.S. research director Jed Meyer. \"Live TV is ad-supported and people do watch ads. The good ads cut through the clutter.\"\n\nTo be sure, binge-viewing isn't necessarily an ad-free experience. While Netflix doesn't run ads, video on demand services on cable insert ads into shows, for instance. And\u00a0Annalect noted that binge-viewers are more receptive to ads compared to TV viewers who do not binge. According to the study, 20% of binge viewers said they often discuss ads with friends and family, compared with just 12% of non-binge viewers.\n\nTo Read the Full Story\n\nContinue reading your article with\na WSJ membership\n\nView Membership Options",
