Each episode, we pick a short text and chat about it with some balance between insight and flippancy. You don't have to know any philosophy, or even to have read the text we're talking about to (mostly) follow and (hopefully) enjoy the discussion. For links to the texts we discuss and other info, check out We also feature episodes from other podcasts by our hosts to round out your partially examined life, including Pretty Much Pop (, covering all media), Nakedly Examined Music (, deconstructing songs), Philosophy vs. Improv (, fun with performance skills and philosophical ideas), and (sub)Text (, looking deeply at lit and film).

Wittner's \"What's Going On at UAardvark?\" (Solidarity Press, 2013)\n\n    Steve Hochstadt teaches at Illinois College and blogs for HNN.What if the trend toward commercialization of higher education continued and accelerated? What would the fully commercial university look like? Lawrence Wittner presents UAardvark: every building named after a corporation; TV sets that can\u2019t be turned off, broadcasting commercials in classrooms, dorms, and offices; and a president negotiating to store radioactive waste in the New Technology Center.Wittner taught history for thirty-six years at the State University of New York at Albany, and has widely published on peace movements and nuclear disarmament. His recent memoir, Working for Peace and Justice, identifies him as an activist intellectual; he serves on the national board of Peace Action. This is his first novel.\n\n  \u2022 Originally published 03\/22\/2013\n\n    Gordon N. Bardos: Marxists in the State Department\n\n    Gordon N. Bardos is a Balkan politics and security specialist based in New York. Don\u2019t laugh\u2014but maybe Joe McCarthy was on to something. And the problem might be even more serious than he realized. Stepping back from contemporary policy debates reveals that Marx\u2019s materialist view of history and Lenin\u2019s voluntarism have been the ideological basis for many of our imperial misadventures from the Balkans to the Mideast to Central Asia.Actual commies are probably not crawling Washington\u2019s hallowed halls. But a very Marxist-Leninist understanding of human nature and historical change has nevertheless had a significant impact on U.S. foreign-policy making in recent decades. Some forty years ago, Walker Connor, one of the deans of the study of ethnic nationalism, had already observed (and decried) the \u201dpropensity on the part of American statesmen and scholars of the post-World War II era to assume that economic considerations represent the determining force in human affairs.\u201d This \u201cunwarranted exaggeration of the influence of material factors\u201d on the world is of course a direct outgrowth of Marx\u2019s belief that existence determines consciousness....\n\n  \u2022 Originally published 02\/11\/2013\n\n    New satire unleashes Hitler on modern, multi-cultural Germany\n\n    What would happen if Adolf Hitler woke up in modern-day Berlin to find that it was not occupied by Russian soldiers but instead by a vibrant, multicultural citizenry? This is the premise of the debut novel by\u00a0German journalist Timur Vermes,\u00a0Er Ist Wieder Da (He\u2019s Back), which has topped\u00a0Germany\u2019s best-seller list.Narrated in the first-person by Hitler, the story\u00a0follows the F\u00fchrer as he awakens from a 66-year sleep in his bunker beneath Berlin to find an entirely changed Germany. In the celebrity-obsessed modern-day city, everyone assumes the fulminating leader of the Nazi party is a comedian in character \u2014 and soon he becomes a celebrity with a guest slot on a Turkish-born comedian\u2019s TV show. His bigoted rants are interpreted as a satirical exposure of prejudice, leading him to decide to start his own political party....\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list",

Why was this an important book for you to write?\n\nAs I wrote in the Chapter \u201cFacing Timeless Truth\u201d this event pushed me to my breaking point after all these years. I did not care if I lived or died any longer I was ready to leave this world. The thought of writing a book ignited a spark within and brought me back to life. A reason to live, a reason to give, so others would not have to suffer as much as I did.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, my intention and the only reason for writing Suffering Ends When Awakening Begins was that when the world reads my story, it will give people hope, faith, and courage to overcome the challenges they face in their own life. I went through a variety and numerous intense traumatic events in my life. I know all too well what it means to suffer. If people read what I went through, realize I made it through to the other side, and now that I\u2019m thriving living a life I choose, they will also know they can do the same.\n\nKnowing that sharing my story has improved the quality of someone\u2019s life, brings me a tremendous amount of joy, happiness, and purpose. This is my passion, my purpose, my reason for being born into this world.\n\nThis was a very emotional novel, and I felt you held nothing back. What did you feel was important to get right in your retelling of events?\n\nI have a profound understanding of what it means to suffer immensely. If exposing the intimate details of my life will help people avoid what I went through, so they can improve the quality of their life, I\u2019m all in. I firmly believe this is why I came into this world. To give faith, hope, and courage to millions of people in the world.\n\nPeople need to know they are not alone, despite what happened in their past. They need to love themselves, know they matter to other people in their life and to this world. Everybody is worthy of living this life, they are also worthy to be empowered, go within, and discover who they truly are.\n\nLife happens, but it happens for a reason. When we are able to discover this reason, tune in with our higher-selves, this is when our life will change for the better, forever. When this happens, it\u2019s so magical, liberating, and empowering. There\u2019s no going back.\n\nMy experiences are my teacher. Since I have been through numerous, and various amounts of trauma, I learned a tremendous amount which no university, no book, no one, can teach you about. This allowed me to put it all together. Although it took me a while and it wasn\u2019t easy, I finally figured out how to overcome hardship, adversity, and suffering and live a life that thrives. Better late than never.\n\nFrom my experiences and studying spirituality for thirty years my understanding is out of the box. This allows me to view the suffering one goes through in life as an opportunity or is intended for us to awaken to who we truly are. This is the purpose of life for humanity. To awaken that we are multidimensional beings living in this third-dimensional world. Once we have a profound understanding of this, awaken to the powers, abilities, and divinity within, our suffering will end.\n\nI believe it\u2019s important to be the best we can be, to accept ourselves for who we are regardless of what has happened to us in our past. The past no longer matters only the present moment matters.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just okay to be who we really are, it\u2019s the purpose of life.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve been through hell and back a few times, but regardless of what I\u2019ve been through, regardless of what people may think of me, or even what I have thought of myself in the past, I love and accept myself as I am. I love and accept others as they are too. This is an essential step in being able to change.\n\nI just want others to realize that no matter what they go through in their life, they matter. People can enjoy a life which thrives if only they learn to control and use their thoughts intentionally to create the experience they want.\n\nWhat do you find is one reason many people have for keeping themselves down? And how can they overcome it?\n\nThat\u2019s easy. It\u2019s the belief systems we hold onto, whether learned or programmed into us while we were young. Anyone can overcome any challenge in life. All they need to do is learn how to think properly.\n\nMost people today live their life by default, instead of by intention. Meaning they let their thoughts run wild throughout the day. When you learn how to harness your thoughts, like placing reins around a horse, then you direct them to where you want to go, you can create the reality, the life you choose to have for yourself.\n\nWhat is the next book that you are working on and when will it be available?\n\nMy next book is going into detail on how to overcome hardship, adversity, and suffering. Along with practical solutions on how to change old belief systems and negative thought patterns so you can thrive in your life.\n\nAuthor Links:\u00a0GoodReadsTwitterFacebookWebsite\n\nSuffering Ends When Awakening Begins by [Crown, Robert]\n\nHow Does a Child\u2019s Life Change When His Mother Tries to Murder Him?\u00a0It\u2019s one of the most profound betrayals imaginable, and it can follow the victim into adulthood, into all he does with his life, tainting his sense of self and his relationships with others. How does a man\u2019s life change when he discovers that with his thoughts, his imagination, and his ability to listen to his higher self, he has the power to overcome the devastating events of his past and build a new life and a family? \u00a0\n\nThis is The Inspiring True Story\u00a0of\u00a0Robert Crown\u2019s\u00a0amazing journey out of the darkness of his childhood and into a world brightly illuminated by the power of positive understanding and purposeful thought. It\u2019s the story of rejecting the victimhood he once embraced and finding the answers that allowed him to embrace the power to create a new life using universal spiritual laws.\n\nBuy Now From\n\nSuffering Ends When Awakening\u00a0Begins\n\nSuffering Ends When Awakening Begins by [Crown, Robert]\n\nAs a reader of Robert Crown\u2019s Suffering Ends When Awakening Begins, from the moment I started reading to closing the book, I was completely hooked. The mix of of suspense and the unknown along with themes of death, betrayal, and loyalty is a great example of the new age and spirtuality genre. Crown does an amazing job at writing this inspiring true story whilst still inflicting a sense of uncertainty and eeriness to his readers.\n\nSuffering Ends When Awakening Begins is based on a true story about childhood and growing up. A book complete with struggle, hardship, journies, and belonging. Robert Crown attempts to captivate his readers by using a dark childhood to demonstrate the importance of positivity and embracing the future.\n\nWhat really enticed me whilst reading this book is the narration. The first person narration created that extra appeal. Reading an account of a person\u2019s life really puts things into perspective for me. I love this idea that you can really learn from someone else\u2019s life experiences, no matter how far away they are from your own.\n\nFor me, the book acts as a great reminder that no matter what you face in life, you will be able to conquer anything you set your mind to. No matter the hardship, no matter the isolation, no matter the fear, everyone has a tough interior \u2013 they just need to find it and use it!\n\nAlthough Suffering Ends When Awakening Begins provides an epic depiction of the author\u2019s challenges in life, we are also subject to a particular thought process. As I was reading I was constantly thinking to myself: if he could overcome these tragic moments in life, then so can I. This book left me feeling a sense of positivity. Although I have no idea what the author\u2019s events could possibly have felt like, I felt as though my own struggles in life really help you to connect to the author and to the narrative.\n\nThe writing is clear and focused, which has a heavy focus on descriptions and impact. The writing provides a clear account of how one\u2019s life can be instantly turned upside down. The writing assumes that, despite the rollercoaster ride of events, you can still come out of it a much stronger, happier person. This is something I think that everyone longs for, isn\u2019t it? And reading this book is a great demonstration of just that!\n\nSuffering Ends When Awakening Begins was by far one of the best books I have read for a long time. It has everything \u2013 originality, a clear thought process, a personal touch. For this reason, and all of the above, I would like to award this book an extremely deserving 5 out of 5 stars. I could immerse myself in the events of the book, and despite not actually going through these events myself, I felt as though the author described them to the point that I felt as though they were real and emotional.\n\nI have very little negative points to say in regards to the book. The writer expertly conveys themes of betrayal, relationships, past vs. future and childhood.\u00a0An emotive, beautiful piece of personal writing brought to you by Robert Crown. A fantastic read for anyone who enjoys themes including life experiences, childhood, longing, journeying on, and betrayal. This book is bound to get your heart racing whilst putting you on the edge of your seat!\n\nPages: 290 | ASIN:\u00a0B077DWRSK5\n\nBuy Now From\n\nAnam Cara: Your Soul Friend and Bridge to Enlightenment and\u00a0Creativity\n\nHumans are on a constant quest for self-actualization.

        "text":"New Storyville Columns\u2014UPDATE!\n\n\nBoy, I\u2019ve been bad about updating my Storyville columns. So, here is an update, all of the new columns in one list. Enjoy!\n\nStoryville 19 Happy Not Sappy\nStoryville 20 Where To Submit Your Stories\nStoryville 21 My 10 Favorite Short Stories\nStoryville 22 Writing Dialogue\nStoryville 23 Best American Short Stories\u2014Resource\nStoryville 24 Breaking Hearts\nStoryville 25 Top Ten Things Literary Publications Need to Do NOW\nStoryville 26 The Grotesque\nStoryville 27 Dissecting \u201cFireflies\u201d\nStoryville 28 Avoiding Cliches and Stereotypes\nStoryville 29 20 Things I\u2019ve Learned About Writing\nStoryville 30 Why Write Short Stories\nStoryville 31 10 Ways to Evaluate Fiction Markets\nStoryville 32 Growing Your Brand\nStoryville 33 Putting Together a Short Story Collection\nStoryville 34 When Is a Story Done?\nStoryville 35 Best Books in Every Major Genre\nStoryville 36 What is Neo-Noir Fiction?\n\nStoryville Column is up \u2013 Top Ten Authors You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\u00a0Before\n\nWhere to start, yeah? For this column I talk about ten powerful voices in contemporary literature that you may never have heard of before. Each one of these voices is somebody that has impressed me with their words, destroyed me with the honesty and emotion, and become a name that I will follow for the rest of my life. Head on over to see what I say about them, but here are the names anyway: Matt Bell, Tina May Hall, Craig Davidson, Holly Goddard Jones, Kyle Minor, Roxane Gay, Benjamin Percy, Lindsay Hunter, Alan Heathcock, and xTx. There\u2019s something here for everybody, but know this: they all take risks, and they all hold nothing back.\n\nNew Storyville Column is Live \u2013 Writing Dynamic\u00a0Settings\n\nMy latest Storyville column is all about writing dynamic settings. I\u2019m a big believer in grounding your work in reality, whether you write literary stories that focus on an internal monologue, or fantastic stories set in distant galaxies. I hate stories with floating heads that don\u2019t tell me where I am. So, here are some tips on how to deliver the goods by revealing character, using all five senses, and painting with broad brush stokes so that you allow your audience to picture the setting while bringing their own history and experiences onto the stage. Hope it helps!\n\nNew Storyville Column is Live \u2013 Dissecting \u201cMaker of\u00a0Flight\u201d\n\nMy new Storyville column is now up, and in this column, I dissect one of my favorite bits of short fiction, \u201cMaker of Flight.\u201d Why do I love this story? Partly because it has a sweetness at its center\u2014it\u2019s one of the few stories of mine I can actually read to my children. Every once in awhile they\u2019ll quote the last line, \u201cI wonder if the sky is still blue?\u201d back to me and it just melts my heart. I also love it because it was the winner of the 2009 \u201cEnter the world of Filaria\u201d contest over at ChiZine. The contest asked you to write a flash story (under 1,000 words) that was based in the world of one of their titles, Filaria, by Brent Hayward. It\u2019s a fantastic book, and I really enjoyed this challenge. I hope you get something out of the dissection. And pick up some ChiZine titles, they do great work over there. I also loved In the Mean Time by Paul Tremblay and Sarah Court by Craig Davidson.\n\nNew Storyville Column is Live \u2013 All About Narrative\u00a0Hooks\n\nNew Storyville column is now up, all about writing narrative hooks. I focus on some of the work of southern gothic author Ron Rash. How do get your audience\u2019s attention with one line? Icebergs and red herrings, what are those? In medias res, have you heard that said before? It\u2019s Latin. And which of these are not narrative hooks: descriptions, settings, action, dialogue, back story? One hint: all of them. Hope it helps!\n\nNew Storyville Column on Writing Sex is Now Live at Lit\u00a0Reactor\n\nMy latest Storyville column over at Lit Reactor is all about writing sex scenes! What\u2019s the difference between pornography, erotica and simply a powerful sex scene? What words should you use (and avoid)? How do you create sexual tension? Sex is a part of life, and the power it introduces into every intimate relationship will ultimately define that relationship. Hope it helps. ENJOY!\n\nWARNING: There is frank adult language in this article, so if you are underage or sensitive, you have been warned.\n\nNew Storyville column on endings is now\u00a0LIVE\n\nMy latest Storyville column over at Lit Reactor is all about endings, twisted and otherwise. What do we talk about? Beginnings, icebergs, fulfillment through resolution, to twist or not twist, deus ex machina, and caring about your characters. Hope it helps. ENJOY!\n\nNew Column: THE WORD is now live at ManArchy\u00a0Magazine\n\nSo, I always leap at the chance to work with brilliant and talented people. So when Pela Via asked me to do something for ManArchy Magazine, I said, \u201cSure. Watchoo want?\u201d We talked a little bit about it. I already do book reviews for The Nervous Breakdown, and a column on writing for Lit Reactor. So what else could we do? I still wanted to talk about books, if possible, as well as other cool things that have been informing and infecting my life, and my writing. We ended up with THE WORD. The first column talks about Sriracha, The Olympics, Adventure Time, Justified, and The Rumpus Letters. I hope you enjoy it, and while you\u2019re at it, spread THE WORD. Ha, see how that worked out?",

Okay, it\u2019s an improved model designed for corpses, which makes me wonder what other mad scientist stuff was going on in the background, but Thomas Elkins was a REAL GUY. And totally, thoroughly steampunk.\n\nGuest Post: Why Go to the Museum?\n\nEvery fall, I teach my students Walter Pater\u2019s Conclusion to Studies in the Renaissance. What I\u2019m talking about here is not so different from what Pater is talking about: he says that we need to experience each moment fully, to live with a certain passionate intensity that involves continual curiosity, observation.",
