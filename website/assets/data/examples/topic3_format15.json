        "text":"Big Box LatAm Hack (2nd part \u2013 Email Brute-force and Spam)\n\nTo complement the\u00a0already mentioned\u00a0findings, the same cybercriminal\u2019s server contains additional interesting things but before mentioning them, I want to give a little bit more information about the email database used to spam victims to infect them with the Betabot malware.\n\nE-mail database\nHow big is the list of email addresses to spam victims? It has 8,689,196 different addresses.\u00a0 It is a very complete database. Even if only 10% of the machines of the people included in this list get infected, cybercriminals would gain more than 800,000 infected PCs!\n\nThe geographic distribution of the emails is already published\u00a0here. If we just look at the number of the most interesting domains belonging to governments, educational institutions and such used to spam and to infect, they are still very high numbers:\n\nDomain\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0number of emails\norg\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13772\nedu\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2015\ngov\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1575\ngob\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 312\n\nSpamming techniques\nMost spam today is sent by botnets; however this is not what the gang behind this server is using. In this case, spam messages are sent via the app called \u201cspam.exe\n\n[Path] \/ filename\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MD5 sum\nspam.exe\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dd77b464356a7c9de41377004dd1fa35\n\nWhen it is running, it asks for the password (below) and then needs a special parameter, which is a plain text file.\n\n\nThe original parameter file is this one:\n\nIt accepts parameters like the number of\u00a0threadsfromsubjectbody\u00a0of the message,\u00a0file\u00a0to attach,reply-to\u00a0and\u00a0smtp\u00a0server to use. There is a string inside of the compiled code pointing to the sources of the project:\n\n\nWhen this server was discovered, cybercriminals already had the next email ready to send to their victims:\n\nTranslation from Spanish:\u00a0\u201cUser, From: +519825**** A friend has just sent you a MMS message via the Claro Web site, the message will be automatically deleted in 72 hours. Download the message now. ID: CLARO, LA RED [The Network] where everything is possible.\u201d\n\nThe original malicious URL embedded into the message is this:\n\nAs I mentioned, the last parameter of \u201cspam.exe\u201d malicious mailer is the smtp server. Cybercriminals have collected 2,093 different not properly secured email servers around the world. This includes email servers from China, USA, Japan, Indonesia, Russia, Italy, Romania, Netherlands, Germany, Belorussia, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Ireland, Brazil, Greece, Chile, Czech Republic, Belgium, Philippines, Denmark, Sweden, Ukraine, Hungary, Canada, Malaysia, Poland, Peru, Taiwan, France, Korea, Spain and many others.\n\nHow did cybercriminals get so many misconfigured servers from around the world?\n\nThis is the name of the module used to attempt smtp servers if these have\u00a0 default accounts with the same default passwords. In other words, it is a brute force application to test smtp connections.\n\n[Path] \/ filename\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MD5 sum\nkiss.exe\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3a5d79a709781806f143d1880d657ba2\u00a0\n\nThis is an app built inside of the same project; the string from the code confirms it:\n\n\nOnce running, it asks for the password, which is the same as for the \u201cspam.exe\u201d application. It accepts four parameters:\u00a0threadsips,\u00a0logins\/password\u00a0and\u00a0email.\n\nWhen I found these resources, cybercriminals had in the IPS parameter file 1,519,403 IP addresses in queue to brute force!\n\nWhile the list of logins\/passwords had the next combinations:\n\nOne interesting thing is that cybercriminals did not want to brute-force all and any domains so they included an exclusion list, which allows \u201ckiss.exe\u201c, to skip and not to brute-force the next domains:\n\nDomains excluded from brute-forcing\n\nLooks like they just did not want to attract too much attention, especially from governments, while brute-forcing.\n\nDid I find other interesting things on that server? Yes, and I will post that in the next and\u00a0 last part of the series Big Box Latam Hack.\nKaspersky Anti-Virus detects \u201cspam.exe\u201d and \u201ckiss.exe\u201d as\u00a0Email-Flooder.MSIL.Agent.r\u00a0respectively.\n\nCybercriminals from different regions may operate in a similar but yet different ways. This case is a good example as it shows how cybercriminals from Latin America, with no access to zombie machines, tried to find as many weak configured smtp servers as possible\u00a0 all around the world to distribute spam. This technique did not decrease their potential reach in terms of the number of victims nor their geographic location. Sometimes simple \u201csolutions\u201d work efficiently and we \u2013 as researchers \u2013 do not only have to focus on botnet-like activities.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous post, there is evidence cybercriminals from South America are in touch with cybercriminals from Eastern Europe and the worst part is that they are using mixed techniques: some codes from their European counterparts with others that are locally developed.\n\nYou may follow me on twitter:\u00a0@dimitribest\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Wednesday, January 7, 2009\n\nCourt Excuses Claimant for Not Filing Timely Claim in Bankruptcy Proceedings\n\nThe Western District slams the Guarantee Fund on public policy grounds for denying a hearing loss claim on a notice defense.\n\nClaimant established hearing loss of 15.77% BAW after working for an employer for 34 years, but the Commission reversed his award as he neglected to file a timely claim against the bankruptcy court after his employer became insolvent in 2001. The court of appeals reversed and found section 287.865.5 did not bar his claim and re-instated the original disability award, in Jones v GST Steel, No. 69299 (Mo. App. WD 1-6-2009).\n\nClaimant was terminated in 2001 when his company went into bankruptcy. He obtained a diagnosis of work-related hearing loss a few days before the bankruptcy filing. The Guarantee Fund defended his claim that it owed nothing as claimant did not preserve a claim with the bankruptcy court during the 6 years the employer\u2019s bankruptcy remained pending.\n\nThe court considered the requirements of 287.865.5 that the employee must make timely claim for such payments. The legislature purpose to allow an insolvent employer to pay liability before making claims against the Guarantee Fund could have been achieved, the court explains, if the Guarantee Fund had provided notice itself to the bankruptcy estate after it received claimant's comp claim in 2003. The court liberally construes benefits under 287.800 and found the construction advanced by the Guarantee Fund placed unsophisticated claimants in a trap.\nThe notice provided to claimant that he needed to file a claim in bankruptcy was \u201cinadequate\u201d and did not provide the claimant adequate clarification how to proceed. It imposed a deadline that he file a claim in July 2001, months before he was legally entitled to file a comp claim for his hearing loss in November 2001 (287.197.7 at the time required 6 month separation rule). The court found the Guarantee Fund never provided him a clearer notice of his rights, and noted it was their statutory responsibility to do so under 287.872. The court cited legislative changes in 2005 requiring notice requirements only of \u201copen\u201d claims and not \u201cpotential\u201d claims.\n\nThe court discusses similarities to the Wire Rope case, in which claimants in both cases lacked adequate information and clarification how to proceed. In the earlier case, the court criticized the Guarantee Fund for taking a defense that \u201cspits\u201d in the face of public policy and causes unjustified anxiety of workers.\n\nIn a similar case, Soligo v GSTY Steel Co., DOLIR 3-24-10, the court awarded against the Guarantee Fund benefits of 35% PPD based on Dr. Koprivica's rating for an unoperated rotator cuff tear, and rejected the Fund's jurisdictional defense that claimant failed to provide notice to the bankruptcy court, when claimant asserted he had never received any letter requiring him to provide such notice. The commission reversed an award of attorney's fees of $3381 assessed by ALJ Siedlik, noting the unsuccessful defense was not so egregious to warrant costs.",

        "text":"\n\nSunday, December 12, 2010\n\nBarney's Bloody Bowie Brawl in Barroom\n\nOn July 19, 1870, the San Francisco Chronicle reported a brutal barroom brawl in the city's Barbary Coast district:\nBloody Affray: The Bowie Knife and the Revolver.\nAt midnight on Sunday three men entered the concert saloon of Nicholas Hochguitel, on the corner of Kearny and Pine streets. Their names are William B. Pennie, Barney Kennedy, and William Wilson. They entered one of the rooms adjoining the \u201cgreen-room\u201d of the place, and sat down at a table where they engaged in a game of cards.\u00a0\nWhile playing they ordered several drinks for which they did not pay. The proprietor, Mr. Hochguitel, went into the room and told them that unless they paid for the drinks they had already ordered they would get no more. The parties denied having ordered any drinks, and some few words passed between them and the proprietor, when he left the room. The men soon followed, and went to the counter, where they ordered another drink, Kennedy agreeing to pay for them. Kennedy and the proprietor had some more words, which ended in Kennedy striking Hochguitel in the face with his clenched fist.\n\nBoth men then clinched, when, it is alleged, Kennedy drew a pistol and beat his opponent over the head with it, until a third party interfered and took it from him. Kennedy, however, was well prepared for an encounter, and drew a bowie knife with which he cut Hochguitel through the under lip to the jaw, in the cheek, on the head and in several other parts of the body. John Reitz, a bar-keeper, came to the rescue of his employer, and was cut on the right side of the neck, below the ear, and it is supposed that the wound will prove fatal, being about two inches long and one deep. Officer Spiller attempted to put an end to the fight by arresting Kennedy, when the latter assaulted him and attempted to stab him in the abdomen. In warding off the blow Spiller was cut in the hand. Several officers made their appearance at this juncture, and the three parties above-named were arrested. Yesterday morning Judge Sawyer held them to answer before the Grand Jury.\nAnother news report of this fight ended with this gruesome image: \u201cAll the contestants were literally covered with blood and looked more like aboriginal tattooed Indians than civilized beings. The floor of the cellar was covered with blood, which, taken in connection with the appearance of those in it, gave it more the look of a slaughter-house than of a drinking saloon.\u201d\n\nWhile the prior article reports that John Reitz's wound was expected to prove fatal, the likelihood is that he made a recovery, as there is no subsequent report of his death. After a bowie knife scrape, newspapers often minimized the odds of survival of wounded parties, but suprisingly often they pulled through.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Ponzi Guilty Pleas In New York, Tennessee; New Ponzi Case Filed By CFTC In Florida; Relief Defendant Misspelled Its Own Company Name\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: There was significant action in Ponzi cases today. Earlier we reported on the guilty plea of Trevor Cook in Minnesota and the issuance of a bench warrant in South Carolina for Michael Derrick Peninger. The brief below summarizes action in the Ponzi and affinity-fraud case case of Steven Byers in New York, the Ponzi case of Barron A. Mathis in Tennessee, and new allegations of a Forex Ponzi scheme against Claudio Aliaga in Florida.\n\nNew York: Steven Byers, 47, of Oak Brook, Ill., pleaded guilty today to felony counts of conspiracy and wire fraud in a Ponzi case said to involve $255 million. U.S. District Judge Denny Chin, who sentenced Bernard Madoff to 150 years in prison, is the presiding judge in the case. Byers will be sentenced in September. He faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.\n\nByers was the former president and chief executive officer WexTrust Capital LLC, a private-equity firm. Orthodox Jews were targeted in the scheme, which involved real estate and specialty finance.\n\n\u201cFrom at least 2003, Byers and others raised money from investors pursuant to private placement offerings and then used material amounts of that money for other purposes, and did not disclose their diversion of funds to investors,\u201d prosecutors said. \u201cIn one such private placement, Byers and others raised approximately $9.2 million in investor funds by representing that the funds would be used to purchase and operate seven commercial properties that were leased to the United States General Services Administration (GSA).\n\n\u201cAccording to the GSA private placement memorandum issued to investors by WexTrust Capital,\u201d prosecutors said, \u201cthe $9.2 million raised from investors, together with a mortgage of approximately $21 million, would be used to purchase the seven GSA properties and cover related acquisition expenses.\n\n\u201cThe seven GSA properties, however, were never purchased. Instead, virtually all of the funds raised from investors to purchase the properties were diverted by Byers and others to other purposes, but investors were never informed that the funds were used for any purpose other than to purchase and operate the seven GSA properties. Byers and others later agreed to make up a story that they would then tell the GSA investors regarding what happened to their investment,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nThe guilty plea was entered as a result of a plea deal with prosecutors. Byers \u201cagreed to forfeit $9.2 million and is subject to mandatory restitution and faces criminal fines up to twice the gross gain or loss derived from the offense,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nTennessee: In Nashville, Barron A. Mathis, 29, pleaded guilty to wire fraud. He formerly was vice president and portfolio manager for J.C. Reed & Co., a failed financial services company headquartered in Franklin.\n\nMathis sold his Ponzi and fraud scheme to friends, acquaintances and clients, collecting $11 million in the process, prosecutors said. Most of the investors were elderly, inexperienced traders.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cases like these are egregious examples of predators who target vulnerable and innocent victims through false and fraudulent business practices,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said U. S. Attorney Edward M. Yarbrough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By his own admission, Mathis encouraged people to invest by falsely promising security, growth and inflated returns on their money, but instead the investors lost their savings as part of an elaborate fraud scheme.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert L. Echols will sentence Mathis. A sentencing date has not been set.\n\nFlorida: Claudio Aliaga, of Davie, has been charged civilly by the CFTC with operating a commodity-pool and Forex Ponzi scheme that gathered $4.5 million.\n\nAlso charged was Aliaga\u2019s company, CMA Capital Management LLC of Miami Lakes.\n\nNamed relief defendants were Aliaga\u2019s wife, Betty Aliaga, and a company known as CMA Global Investement (sic) Fund LLC. The CFTC noted that the company misspelled its own name and \u201creceived funds as a result of defendants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fraudulent conduct.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Marcia G. Cooke ordered an asset freeze.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n3 Responses to \u201cPonzi Guilty Pleas In New York, Tennessee; New Ponzi Case Filed By CFTC In Florida; Relief Defendant Misspelled Its Own Company Name\u201d\n\n  1.

        "text":"Time to Think, Time to\u00a0Reflect\n\nWe all need to take time to reflect on our lives and what we do. It should be a frequent exercise for those who work in our system of criminal justice.\n\nThis is what I have been thinking and reflecting about since that day in Ferguson \u2014 and what\u2019s going on in St. Louis and other cities today.\n\nWhat I see is a growing public awareness and concern regarding uses of deadly force by police. This awareness has been raised by the use of emerging technologies such as dash and body cameras, public and private video surveillance cameras, and cell phones with video recording capabilities.\n\nAre police shootings of young black men a new and startling turn of events? Most likely not. What is new, however, is technology, the Internet, and social media. More than likely (though there are no existing data to prove it), these shootings have gone on for years without the public awareness we have today.\n\nThese deaths, more often than not, involve a young black man or a person mentally ill. When these events are posted on the Internet, they tend not to look very good for the police officer involved; many are questionable. The real bad shoots result in large scale public protest, property destruction, arrests, and further violence.\n\nIn response, police \u201carmor-up,\u201d and try to quell the disturbance. This, too, can cause further public outrage and distress.\n\nWhen police investigators and the district attorney review these actions, they are often find the police officer involved to be operating within the rule of law (which, under the U.S. Supreme Court opinion in\u00a0Graham v. Connor\u00a0[1989] is a very low standard for use of force by police).\n\nIn the few cases that go to trial, juries tend not to convict a police officer who who can clearly articulate fear for his life and, therefore, the immediate need to apply deadly force.\n\nIf a police officer can convince a jury he feared for his life, the use of deadly force is within the current law regardless if other measures like de-escalation, taking cover, or even backing off would have been a more reasonable and life-saving action.\n\nIf we compare Graham with the standard of deadly force which is used by police in European Union countries \u2014 that of \u201cabsolute necessity,\u201d it is quite evident which standard is more restrictive. And the rate of police using deadly force in those countries is strikingly low compared to our country).\n\nAfter every shooting, every investigation, and almost every jury trial, anger continues to seethe in the black community and police too often remain silent, wary, and bunkered in. Instead of responding through active and on-going dialogue, explanation, empathy, and sadness, some departments simply \u201carmor-up.\u201d Tragically, this seething anger has resulted in innocent, on-duty police officers being summarily executed. This, too, is not good.\n\nIn fact, it is not a good situation for anyone \u2013 police, communities of color, or white America.\n\nYet, in my observation, my reflection, we barely talk about the recent recommendations of the President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Policing (2015) or the report by the Police Executive Research Forum who offered thirty guidelines on use of force the following year. Nor do we see many visible, demonstrable improvements within our police.\n\nYes, there is talk about more training regarding de-escalating potentially violent encounters, being more sensitive to persons with mental health issues, recognizing implicit bias in police decisions, and so forth. But the number of persons killed by police since Ferguson, still remains about 1,000 persons a year. That number has not been reduced. It would be a good metric to start.\n\nIs this the way it\u2019s going to be? That this is modern life in America?\u00a0Two to three persons every day shot and killed by police? And when it is a young black man who is the victim, the black community erupts, highly militarized police flood into the streets, it is calm for a while as the matter is investigated. But then police find their officer followed policy, training, and the law (another disturbance occurs), then the district attorney or a jury exonerates the officer (another disturbance), until the next time\u2026\n\nThis, to me, is not only a most uncomfortable environment for police to work, but also for the communities in which they are most present.\n\nI was there once and I decided to do something about it. Today, it is up to our police to begin to actively fix this problem, to act in ways that reduce the taking of lives and to practice respect and self-control by listening to the voices in their communities and practicing justice. (And, at the same time to remember that this kind of justice must be practiced inside the police department as well as with the community.)\n\nWe have smart cops today. They must be urged and supported by their communities to rebuild trust, control their uses of force, and work closely with citizens in solving these problems.\n\nWhen police do this, they will become more effective, there will be less violence for everyone, and they will work in a much safer environment.\n\nThat\u2019s what I have been thinking about and it is distressing and unsettling. WE can do better!\n\n1 Comment\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"15 November 2013\n\nGoogle Books\nI've Already Said What I Can\n\nI'm not going to say much about The Hon. Denny Chin's decision on fair use yesterday in the Google Books matter (PDF); I largely already have. I think it was incorrect... but that he was driven to it by fundamental conceptual errors in the suit's structure and theoretical basis, by less-than-optimal lawyering, by both subtle and not-so-subtle institutional arrogance in the Second Circuit bar, and by a variety of other, non-merits factors (such as poor presentation of evidence in the briefs by all parties concerned). His decision is not indefensible \u2014 merely incorrect, at least as to some subsets of books at issue.\n\nThe actual Google Books litigation was and is the wrong1 theory propounded by the wrong party and the wrong lawyers against an incomplete set of defendants in the wrong court. It shouldn't surprise anyone that an opinion resulting from that set of missteps makes missteps of its own, primarily by downplaying the fact\/expression distinction as it relates to three of the four statutory fair use factors. Of course, Judge Chin was invited to do so by the parties... and one can hardly blame him for deciding on the basis of the record before him, however conceptually flawed that record was. Unfortunately, copyright interests probably (not certainly, but probably) do not rise to the \"civil rights\" level that requires certain sua sponte inquiries; imagine for a moment that this matter directly (instead of indirectly) concerned First Amendment speech rights, with the attendant \"no prior restraint\" doctrine, and what a judge might have done with that.\n\nUltimately, Google successfully invited B'rer Fox into the courtroom briar patch and demonstrated both that (a) the Authors' Guild's arrogance in presuming to represent all authors' interests meant that it couldn't represent any coherent set of authors' interests well, and (b) the nonstatutory fifth fair-use factor \u2014 administrative convenience \u2014 will in practice (and especially in the Second Circuit) overwhelm the others.\n\nAnd that's it from me on the substance. Next up will be an appeal to the Second Circuit, which I expect to reverse in part... but on Rule 56 grounds, not on copyright-law grounds. That is, this is now a civil procedure case, not a copyright case; the real question in front of the Second Circuit will be whether the record in front of Judge Chin presents undisputed material facts. The briefs in front of Judge Chin did a remarkably poor job of engaging with the factual record (let alone reflecting adequate factual investigation), so there's a lot of room here. Then there's the question of whether the Second Circuit's prior guidance to consider fair use before class certification will stand on Supreme Court review; this is not at all certain, particularly if the Supreme Court's membership changes before this case reaches it (I put the over\/under in the 2015 Term, beginning October 2015, for the petition for certiorari).\n\n  1. Not \"morally wrong,\" but \"factually and theoretically suboptimal enough to result in unreliable inferences.\" If that sounds like something coming from some high-falutin' science lab, it is; I may be able to escape the smell of certain thiols, but I can't wash the thought process out so easily once exposed to it.",

        "text":"Monday, August 15, 2011\n\nHe just isn't that bad. Not all rogues are criminals.\n\nIn my humble opinion this is a very misleading headline...\n\nI knew Norman as hard working, articulate, confident, considerate, positive, likeable, resourceful and enterprising rogue. He was even humble and teachable to a degree. Yes, he loaned money without authority to do so, but it was never a secret as far as I remember. They were short term loans made to a few desperate individuals until the next pay day. He saw it as offering a helping hand rather than anything more sinister and would struggle to get his money back. He also offered a gift wrapping service in the run-up to Christmas as well as trying to establish his office cleaning business.\n\nI liked him. I still like him. He's more honest than most in my opinion and certainly a person not deserving of this article which is a touch misleading. If Norman says someone was lying, I would tend to believe him...but who would believe a loan shark?\n\nI'm not condoning the practice of money lending registered or not, nor of Norman's actions. I'm merely pointing out that you shouldn't believe all you read. \u00a0Everyone that knew him saw an indefatigably happy, helpful, smiling and positive individual. Rarely would you see him like this photograph...unless he felt aggrieved.\n\nI once had an accountant who fleeced us for a lot of money for services I later found out to be nothing to do with our type of business. He knew he was charging for such services. Yes, there are real criminals who are licensed to fleece us and they are often well respected. There are others that I have had personal experience with that should be locked up... but not Norman. I trust my instincts and can usually recognise if a person is hardcore criminal and evil to boot...not Norman. Give the man a break.\n\nIt makes you wonder who else the press hang out to dry.\n\nOn a separate note, but still with crime...I finished this book last week...\nIt's a true story that shocked Victorian Britain in June, 1860. It was recommended by a friend and, although a terrible crime, the book is also crammed...and I mean crammed, with interesting facts. It was a fascinating book that has to be read through to the last illuminating page. Don't be tempted to google the original case as it will reveal who the murderer was...or will it? Things are not as straightforward as they seem.\n\nThe only time I found myself drifting was during references to the great crime writers of the time, even though one of them was a certain Mr Charles Dickens. Mr Dickens had his own suspicions regarding this crime.\n\nI think this is the first book I've read which is of a specific murder and, strangely enough, I would recommend it.\n\nTodays little painting...\nThis is another study of Featherbed Rock in Seaham, NE England.\n\n\n  1. Ken, love your painting, and well done you for standing up for Norman. You knew him as others didn't so it is good that you wrote about him as you did.\n\n  2. I knew a quote I read today might come in handy. It is by journalist John Swinton, former Chief Editor of the New York Times: \"The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread.\" Sounds like this is what happened to Norman.\n\n    The book you recommend looks interesting. Is it too gory for a wimp like me? It's funny because as I was reading your review I thought that I should go Google the case. Now I'll just have to read it. :)\n\n    Nice painting--reminds me of Utah.\n\n  3. Thanks Vera\n    As for Norman, I just thought I'd put in my twopenneth 'worth to redress the balance a little...not that he'll ever hear of it.\n\n    Hi Randi\n    That's quite a quote and he was brave to admit it.\n    The book is very factual on all kinds of things that I found interesting...not least how people lived over one hundred years before I was born.",

        "text":"\n\nOn the Friday, 3 October 2013 edition of the BBC programme \u201cQuestion Time\u201d, Mehdi Hasan (left), a journalist for the Huffington Post, criticised the Daily Mail (video here). Subsequently, the Daily Mail published details of an application letter Mehdi Hasan had written to the paper for a journalist position, suggesting that Mehdi had not always been so critical.\n\nWas this publication in breach of the Data Protection Act 1998?\n\nFirstly, if the Daily Mail had the personal information about Mehdi Hasan legitimately, then there is a journalism exemption under section 32 of the Act that would enable the paper to publish non-sensitive personal data for journalistic purposes.\n\nThe more interesting question is, \u201cWas the personal data on Mehdi Hasan being processed (stored) by the Daily Mail legitimately prior to it having any journalistic purpose?\u201d Note that the application letter was sent in July 2010, over 3 years ago.\n\nOn the facts in the public domain, the most likely answer to this question is, \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe reason is that under the Data Protection Act 1998, personal data can only be retained by a data controller (data owner) for as long as it is required for a particular business purpose or purposes (see Data Protection Principles 2 and 5). Arguably, once a job applicant has been rejected, there is no further business purpose justifying retaining that applicant\u2019s personal data. Claims arising out of discrimination or other employment-related claims as a result of unlawful handling of a person\u2019s application for employment must be made within 6 months of the event giving rise to a claim. This is therefore the standard retention period for personal data concerning unsuccessful applicants. However, where an applicant has agreed upon request by the potential employer that his or her details can be retained on file for consideration for other positions, then clearly this 6 months period can be extended.\n\nThe 6 months retention rule is not laid down in any law or regulation. This is derived from the limitation period for bringing claims in the Employment Tribunal and the guidance on retention of applicants\u2019 details set out in the Information Commissioner\u2019s Employment Practices Code (see the ICO employment webpage for links). Where a data controller has a legitimate business purpose for retaining that information, then as well as communicating that purpose to the applicant, the applicant\u2019s information data can be retained for as long as is necessary for that purpose. It is difficult, however, to see under what circumstances information about unsuccessful job applicants needs to be retained for over 3 years by a prospective employer.\n\nHowever, the real issue here is that even if the publication of details of Mehdi Hasan\u2019s application letter were in breach of the Data Protection Act 1998, Mehdi would have no effective remedy under the Data Protection Act 1998, unless he suffered actual loss or damage, in which case he could sue for these losses or damages, together with damages for distress (as the breach arguably involved a breach of the journalism \u2018special purpose\u2019 provisions). It is unlikely that Mehdi suffered any loss or damage, but merely embarrassment.\n\nPublish and be damned? Commercial\u00a0bloggers.\n\n\nGuido Fawkes (Gunpowder Plot)\n\nIn my first post on the\u00a0draft Royal Charter for Self-Regulation of the Press (the \u201cRoyal Charter\u201d) and amendments tabled for consideration in the Crime and Courts Bill (the \u201cAmendments\u201d) published on Monday, 18 March 2013, I stated that as a private blogger, they would not worry or concern me.\n\nWhat about commercial blogs and bloggers?\n\nThe Royal Charter definition of \u201crelevant publisher\u201d makes no distinction between personal or commercial blogs. It catches any blog which publishes news-related material. This includes publishers based outside of the UK, if it is determined that the news-related material on the blog is directed at the UK. For example, Global and General Nominees Ltd, the St Kitts and Nevis publisher of the Guido Fawkes blog, must be considered to be a relevant publisher for the purposes of the Royal Charter.\n\nHowever, if an offshore relevant publisher chose not to sign up to a recognised\/approved regulator, what would be the effect? In other words, what is the risk to Guido Fawkes of joining the Spectator and Private Eye in ignoring the Royal Charter?\n\nThe heavy-handed Amendments attempt to penalise relevant publishers for not submitting to the jurisdiction of a recognised\/approved regulator by permitting the courts to award exemplary damages against them and make adverse costs orders, in respect of certain claims (defined as \u201cRelevant Claims\u201d: civil claims for libel, slander, breach of confidence, misuse of private information, malicious falsehood and harassment).\n\nNote that the definition of \u201crelevant publisher\u201d in the Amendments is different.\n\nNC29 of the Amendments\u2019 definition for \u201crelevant publisher\u201d catches a person who, in the course of business (whether or not carried on with a view to profit), publishes news-related material. The first obvious question is what, in the context of the Crime and Courts Bill, does \u201cin the course of business\u201d mean? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess, but going by the old favourite of the plain, ordinary meaning of the words, I\u2019d suggest that any website or blog that is published by a commercial entity or charity will be caught. This will catch many political current affairs blogs, such as LabourList, PoliticsHome and ConservativeHome. The grey area will be personal blogs that also carry advertising \u2013 will these be sufficiently commercial to be \u201cin the course of business\u201d?\n\nTaking the two definitions into account, I\u2019d say the Guido Fawkes blog was a relevant publisher for both the Royal Charter and the Amendments and so was caught by them. So what?\n\nFor the threat of exemplary damages and adverse costs orders under the Amendments to have any effect on overseas commercial blogs, in order to persuade them to volunteer to be subject to a recognised press regulator under the Royal Charter, the blogs would have to be convinced that claimants could successfully bring a Relevant Claim against them. \u00a0This would require Relevant Claim claimants to get leave to serve a claim outside of the relevant jurisdiction (see Civil Procedure Rules\u00a0Part 6 and relevant Practice\u00a0Directions 6B), to get a default judgement, assuming the blog publishers ignore the claimants\u2019 served claims (Part 12 and Practice Direction 12) and obtain orders to enforce any judgments (eg stop orders? Part 73 and Practice Direction 73). All tricky steps \u2013 good luck with that for a claimant who is a normal person of usual means.\n\nI suspect that many overseas commercial blogs, Guido Fawkes amongst them, will not be sufficiently worried by the Amendments regime to rush into the arms of a Royal Charter recognised press regulator.\n\nPublish and be damned? Not\u00a0bloggers.\n\nHarriette Wilson00\n\nIt is always a joy to see the executive at work. Yesterday saw the publication of a rushed draft Royal Charter for Self-Regulation of the Press (the \u201cRoyal Charter\u201d). At the same time, a set of amendments were scrambled together and tabled for consideration in the Crime and Courts Bill (the \u201cAmendments\u201d).\n\nYou can tell there was not much careful reflection on the effect of the combined documents simply by seeing the confusion that abounds. This being a lawyer\u2019s blog, I am interested in the misaligned definitions of \u201crelevant publisher\u201d.\n\nIt must be uncontroversial to state that the Royal Charter, whether by accident or design, will catch self-hosted blogs that comment on current affairs or politics. Schedule 4(1) includes:\n\nb) \u201crelevant publisher\u201d means a person (other than a broadcaster) who publishes in the United Kingdom:\n\ni. a newspaper or magazine containing news-related material, or\n\nii. a website containing news-related material (whether or not related to a newspaper or magazine);\n\nd) a person \u201cpublishes in the United Kingdom\u201d if the publication takes place in the United Kingdom or is targeted primarily at an audience in the United Kingdom;\n\ne) \u201cnews-related material\u201d means:\n\ni. news or information about current affairs;\n\nii. opinion about matters relating to the news or current affairs;; or\n\niii. gossip about celebrities, other public figures or other persons in the news.\n\nThere is some potential confusion in what is meant by a website. This blog is hosted and comes under the domain of WordPress. Is this my website or does it belong to WordPress, for the purposes of the \u201crelevant publisher\u201d definition? The blog is aimed at an audience in the UK; is the website hosting it? If I hosted the blog on my own domain, even using WordPress software, then it is clearer that I would be a \u201crelevant publisher\u201d.\n\nSo what? Firstly, the Royal Charter is all about setting up a recognition panel for regulators of relevant publishers. Sure, these regulators must have their own standard codes, and in order to be recognised must have an arbitration process for complainants and relevant publishers, an enforcement mechanism (with fines of up to 1% turnover to a maximum of \u00a31 million for breaches of standard codes) and the ability to direct corrections and apologies. However, nothing in the Royal Charter would require me, as a blogger who is a \u201crelevant publisher\u201d, to subject myself to the jurisdiction of a recognised regulator. I can choose to stay unregulated.\n\nAny reports that as a blogger I could be fined up to \u00a31 million are therefore wide of the mark.\n\nWhat about the Amendments? These are, in essence, an indirect method of getting relevant publishers to sign up to a recognised regulator \u2013 in the terminology of the Amendments, an approved regulator. If relevant publishers fail to sign up, then they risk being subject to an award of exemplary damages in certain defined causes of action (see the definition of \u201cRelevant Claims\u201d: civil claims for libel, slander, breach of confidence, misuse of private information, malicious falsehoo...

        "text":"Facebook launches reporting tool to clamp down on scam adverts in the UK\n\nFacebook has created a reporting tool for scam adverts and donated \u00a33m to Citizens Advice for an anti-scan project called Scams Action.\u00a0\n\nThe project was launched by Facebook after they agreed to treat the matter seriously after Martin Lewis, the consumer champion, dropped a lawsuit of defamation against them, for the many scam ads appearing on Facebook that were featuring his image with the endorsement that he was backing financial schemes and to click through on the fake ad.\u00a0\n\nScam adverts are often posted by fake companies that don't own, hold or dispatch what they are advertising and often use celebrity images to endorse false products like mobile phones, miracle medical breakthroughs, free trial offers, miracle face creams diet pills and 'get rich quick' bitcoin trading schemes.\n\nAs many Social Media platforms push advertising content and Facebook still does not allow users to deny advertising uploads of their personal data to Facebook, it has become easy for scammers to reach a broader audience. The UK faces an epidemic of online scam ads, yet there isn't a law or regulation to prevent them. Usually, these criminal scammers are based outside of the EU.\u00a0\n\nThousands of people have fallen victim to these ad scams and they have devastating effects on those that have been conned out of thousands of pounds and serious affects on their health if they have actually received the 'miracle new drug that replaces insulin'.\u00a0\n\nThe social media company's new scam ads reporting tool will involve a specially trained team investigating alerts raised by users, reviewing reports and taking down violating posts to clamp down on potentially misleading adverts.\u00a0\n\nCitizens Advice project Scams Action (casa) will help those that have been impacted by scammers (it is estimated that 20,000 people are year are scammed) but also raise awareness of how to avoid scams, too.\u00a0\n\nMany ad scams are obvious to lots of people but there are many that don't recognise them as scams and they are left vulnerable because when an advertisement appears on Facebook, they may feel that it is to be trusted; that Facebook would have vetted the company to protect its users, surely? Match that advert with a celebrity's face that is thought to be an opinion leader saying that they use the product or have invested in the company and now life is so wonderful and that is where the dangers lie. It is a ripe area for scammers and it is right that Facebook are doing something about protecting their users because it isn't just an issue with the ad scammers now. It is an issue for legitimate UK advertisers trying to get their brand message across. The ad scam issue dilutes trust.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThere are a few obvious things to look out for in spotting an ad scam:\n  \u2022 The price is too good to be true - cheaper than it could be bought elsewhere\n  \u2022 It's a too good to be true Miracle cream that gets rid of every wrinkle\n  \u2022 Being asked to pay quickly and for any other personal information\n  \u2022 The http address at the start of the URL should have an s at the end of http: https. This means that the website has a security certificate and that if you are paying by credit card, your card is encrypted.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Check if there is an option of paying by Paypal which would give you added security. If there isn't an option, this should ring alarm bells.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Spelling, grammar, poor images and no contact address on the page.\n\nFacebook have also made updates in its Ad Preference menu to provide users with more information about businesses and third parties, including their email and phone numbers and other data.\u00a0\n\nYet, Facebook is still not letting their users deny advertiser uploads of their personal data to Facebook via Facebook itself. Users have to go through and contact each and every one individually and of course, how many people would do that? So, these users are still bombarded with all types of manipulative advertisements, which leaves them extremely vulnerable to ad scams.\u00a0\n\nSocial Media companies provide a vehicle to carry fake news and fake ads across the world. The reach is global and unquantifiable. It's collection of data has made it easy for these criminals that are creating these fake ads to manipulate the users on the social media platforms.\u00a0\n\nMartin Lewis sued Facebook for defamation because his reputation was being ruined on their platform.\u00a0\n\nWill\u00a0the big tech giants understand the damage that their negligent behaviour can cause?\n\nGlobal companies are the key to spreading better policing on the internet.\n\nOnline defamation refers to any untrue statement (and in this case an untrue endorsement) posted in an online context that causes or is likely to cause serious harm to someone's reputation or business.\u00a0\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nNote: only a member of this blog may post a comment.",

        "text":"A couple of nights ago I was watching the movie \u201cSpider-Man 2\u201d with my son in my lap. It\u2019s one of those relaxing moments that define your purpose in life. Some of you who have kids will know that moment. Others may recognize it as a single moment, sitting on a board waiting for the perfect wave with everything in sync, from the dolphins nearby to the sounds of the seagull overhead. Then you catch that perfect wave, and as you ride, the face of it just washes over you. This is what life is about.\n\nHopefully we all have those epiphany moments. As I was having mine holding my son, he looked up at me and pointed at the police cars being hurled across the screen by Dr. Octopus. He told me, \u201cThat is why I don\u2019t like you going to work every day.\u201d I had to pause and really appreciate that moment before I went on to explain that although Isla Vista can be a bit crazy at times, we don\u2019t have very many visits from Doc Ock or the Green Goblin. Maybe once a year in late October they might show up for a day or two, but for the most part our villains don\u2019t have fancy costumes or an extra set of rhino horns. The villains we have look just like you and me. In fact, sometimes they are you and me \u2026\n\nMy bike was stolen, and the cop asked if I wanted to press charges against the person responsible. What does that involve? I don\u2019t want to get a student in trouble.\n\nBike theft is the most common crime we have at UCSB and in Isla Vista. Unfortunately it has been regarded by many to be just a way of life here. I often hear people say it\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s just a bike and you should expect to have one stolen while you live here. I myself think that\u2019s a pretty sad way of thinking. An Xbox 360 costs less money than most bikes. It\u2019s just a gadget, admittedly a cool one, but a bike is transportation to and from school or work. Some need it to survive day to day and the loss of their bike is devastating. Yet, if I just walked off with your Xbox, it would be horrible crime, akin to committing genocide on baby harp seals. Frankly, stealing is stealing and a thief is a thief.\n\nBut I digress. When we take a report for a stolen bike, the value is usually under $1000, and if so, it is considered a misdemeanor. If you don\u2019t want to press charges for theft, it makes it difficult for us to go after the bike thief and further investigate if they have stolen other bikes and get them back to the owner. Basically it could mean that we catch someone stealing your bike and if you don\u2019t want to press charges, we might just dust them off and send them on their way to take someone else\u2019s bike. It can be frustrating to us to catch someone who is making a living off stealing from others and not be able to do anything about it because the bike owner is concerned about being too harsh on another student.\n\nOh and what does it involve to press charges? Well, you have to say you are willing to press charges, and if it did go to court, you would have to be willing to say that the bike is yours and you never gave permission to that guy with those four extra mechanical arms to take it. That\u2019s all.\n\nDo cops write more tickets at the end of the month to fill a last-minute quota and get a good evaluation from their supervisor?\n\nYou seem to misunderstand the goals here. If I write 10 tickets, I get a toaster. Fifty tickets and I get a stuffed Stewie Griffin doll. Seriously though, quotas are illegal per California Vehicle Code Section 41602. \u201cNo agency shall set an arrest quota.\u201d Now does it happen? Sadly some bad supervisors begin pushing numbers instead of effective enforcement, and next thing you know there\u2019s an unwritten quota. Ironically, if you Google \u201cCalifornia traffic quotas illegal,\u201d you\u2019ll see more articles about cops suing their departments over quotas than what the law actually says.\n\nSo, to answer your question, quotas are illegal. It can happen, but rarely; cops don\u2019t even like quotas, and Stewie Griffin dolls are way overvalued. (Yeah, that\u2019s right, Magic Mountain. I\u2019m talking about you \u2026 )\n\nThat\u2019s all for now. It\u2019s time for me to pop in \u201cIron Man\u201d and try to recapture some of that magic time with my kids. I\u2019ll be sure to ignore my wife on the couch swooning over Robert Downey Jr. So for now, take care, stay safe and if you run into any problems, take a moment and Question Authority. I am here (insert double chest thump) for you!\n\nSgt. Mark Signa is an officer of the UCSB Police Dept.\n\nGot caught by a cop? Your party popped by the Po-Po? Ticked by a ticket?

        "text":"Tag Archives: theft\n\nThe Sucky World of Being\u00a0Robbed\n\nIn my life I\u2019ve been robbed a few times, too many in fact. My first robbery was in Mexico City, the first place I traveled to alone. Having only a week there, I did a whirlwind tour of three places, starting in la ciudad Mexico and ending there. Returning on a Sunday, I went to Chapultapec Park and the world famous anthropology museum, Museo Nacional de Antropologia where, speaking hardly any Spanish at all, I still managed to carry on a conversation with a Spanish speaking guard and understand most of the signs in the museum.\n\nMexico City is vast, with a population topping 2o million at that time (over 8 million in the city proper). The subway is extremely cheap and the only way to get around quickly. I had been warned to keep my bags close and where I could see them and I did that, but as I boarded the subway train I was pushed on. Now I know that the crowded cities do this to pack the people on but it was a Sunday and not that crowded. As I was putting my transfer into my bag I noticed the slash through it where the guys who had pushed me on the train had taken my wallet. Lucky for me I had less than $10 USD and one credit card with a very non-Mexican name that I canceled immediately. The rest of my traveler\u2019s checks were in my room. Unlucky for me, it was a Sunday, with no banks open and no place that would take a traveler\u2019s check so I couldn\u2019t eat dinner.\n\nWhen I was in India, backpacking around, I locked down every pocket I could on my giant backpack, leaving only two side pockets open, which carried shampoo and dirty underwear. At one point I got stuck on a train, which had four open beds to every partitioned but open area. I had asked for the women\u2019s carriage but hadn\u2019t been given it. I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was on the top bunk and my backpack was shoved under the bottom one, way too heavy to have been lifted had it even fit up top. My face was about six inches away from the ceiling fan, which luckily was covered. I kept looking down to check on my pack but at one point I just had to go to the bathroom, the squat toilet on a moving train (and how fun was that). Eventually when I disembarked I found that my shampoo and dirty underwear were gone. I hope they enjoyed both.\n\nI was robbed again in New York City. By now, I was quite aware of the sneaky way in which robbers try to get your goods. I\u2019d had a small pack to carry around with me for the week. But I let my guard down at the airport, at the last minute. My friends had driven me to the airport and we were have a coffee when a man came up on my left and asked us the time. Of course we all looked at him, unaware of the person behind me and on my right who grabbed my purse. We realized it in minutes but it was too late. Off went my purse, $200, two plane tickets, my film, my glasses, my contact case and all my ID (I had only brought the ID I needed though). The airline said they would replace my ticket for free but I had to pay for it first. Of course I couldn\u2019t because I had no money or ID. This was before 9-11 because I can\u2019t imagine how screwed I would have been otherwise. Luckily my friends could cover the cost and I could pay them back later. I don\u2019t know what I would have done otherwise.\n\nThe most robberies I\u2019ve experienced have actually been burglaries of my home or car. And they are the ones that have happened more recently. Several years ago I was home on a very hot night with my windows and doors open. My patio door faces the back yard and the other door does not face the street so not visible to anyone walking by. I was packing for a trip the next day and was in my den typing when I smelled cigarette smoke.\n\nI don\u2019t smoke but I looked up to see someone brazenly in my living room. Somewhat in a surreal state I ran into the room as the guy left and was gone by the time I could look out on the street. I called the police but to no avail of course. I believe it was my ex-drug addict neighbor, someone who knew where all the doors were. I searched the neighborhood that night, looking in every dumpster I could find, sure that he had taken what he needed, and dumped the rest.\n\nThe next day I had to get a driver\u2019s licence before I could leave on my trip. All I had was an expired passport so I could get the license done but would not be allowed to pick it up until I had my birth certificate. Somehow a photo ID\u00a0 like a passport isn\u2019t good enough but anyone could walk in with my birth certificate and get my driver\u2019s license picture shot and paid for. That makes a lot of sense. And of course I had to write back to my birth province for the birth certificate and ask my sister what hospital I was born in because I certainly didn\u2019t know.\n\nI made it through, canceling credit cards and paying for new ID. About two months later I received a call from a dumpster company where they had found my purse, complete with ID and even postage stamps. The purse and wallet were disgusting soaked with garbage juices but I reclaimed my ID and now have spares of a few things. But I was out the cost of the replacement ID, the purse and wallet and of course my cash. I\u2019m even more cautious now but on a nice day at home, you\u2019d think you could leave your door open. I have friends that live in a small town outside of Seattle and they never lock their doors.\n\nPersonally, I think I\u2019ve done my time being robbed and burgled and that it\u2019s now time to win the lottery. Hopefully I can write about that exciting change some day soon.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nFiled under crime, Culture, home, life, memories, security, travel\n\nFrom Police to Police\u00a0State\n\nYou would think with the eye on the RCMP over the Dziekanski inquiry, that both RCMP and city police would be on better behavior in Greater Vancouver. Note that some municipalities use a local police force while others use the RCMP.\n\nNow, granted there have been a helluva lot of gang shootings to date, with at least 18 dead so far, so probably the police are a little jumpy. And we already know based on testimony by the four very fit RCMP officers who taser Robert Dziekanski to death that they\u2019ll take raised hands or a desk stapler as a threat of deadly force and use it in kind. Oh and that they didn\u2019t panic. These guys might have looked better if they said they had panicked but that they were cool and calculating about taking down an unarmed man and tasering him four more times while he writhed in pain is even more scary.\n\nSo, just maybe everyone wants to use caution more. Police once upon a time used to be trained in ways to take a person down using just their hands. And if the criminal was carrying a dangerous weapon, well disarm them. Shoot to kill was the last resort. However, that\u2019s now changed and shoot to kill, ask questions later is the order of the day.\n\nIn March a homeless man was approached by police for stealing from a car. Later it turns out he wasn\u2019t the thief but he supposedly advanced on them wielding an X-acto knife. Now it could be the police havexacto1 misnamed it but many X-acto knives are tiny, with a wedge-shaped blade of about an inch. They are very sharp and potentially lethal at close range. You\u2019d have to get very close and personal to inflict damage. This image of a range of X-acto blades was taken from www.dickblick.com with the most common being the triangular shape.\n\nSo the police shot the guy in the stomach and killed him. Sure it was two women police officers and maybe they were scared. But they could have backed up, I think. And why couldn\u2019t they shoot the guy in the arm or the leg, thereby giving him a lot of pain and disabling him from advancing? There was no need to shoot him in the stomach. Were they bad aims. Or was the X-acto blade much larger and being hurled at them?\n\nOn April 5th the police shot a guy in a Ford F350 truck who was allegedly stealing it. It seems that when they tried to block the truck the guy gunned it at the police car. The police shot at him, one shot, and wounded him. The car thief is expected to recover. In this case most people agree the police had a right to shoot. I doubt they had time to react with more than that with the truck coming at them. And it\u2019s pretty hard to shoot to disable when someone is sitting in a vehicle with tinted glass. They could have tried to shoot out the tires but at that point it was probably not obvious what the guy had planned. I should note here that in Vancouver, up until recently it\u2019s extremely rare that a police officer would shoot anyone. Once a year is more often than normal.\n\nSo we\u2019ve had two shootings in four months. Not to mention the three off-duty cops that beat up and robbed a delivery driver. Sure, they\u2019re the exception and yahoos from three different cities. But what this all points to is that there is a perceived image that the police forces (municipal and RCMP) are out of control. Police departments need to take a proactive stance and see if their training is adequate. As well, training needs to start with immobilizing a threat in the safest way possible to everyone. That means trying to take down a person with minimal physical violence, moving from\u00a0 hands to taser to guns only when lives are threatened. That means not a perceived threat as the RCMP somehow saw in an office stapler. A deadly threat means being shot at or run down.\n\nThese departments also need to look at who they\u2019re hiring. Bigoted, snobby\u00a0and racist police will be more likely to prejudice a situation with their perspectives. What suitability tests are run on these candidates to ensure they stay calm, level-headed, use reasoning to assess a situation and don\u2019t let prejudices get in their way. (I won\u2019t do more than mention the many women of the downtown East side who disappeared over the years withouth the police doing anything because the women were drug addicts and prostitutes.) They need to have some basic psychology and counselling courses\u00a0and learn how to verbally diffuse a situation as well.\n\nI\u2019m not saying all poli... (truncated)",

The bills were flawed and had been marked for destruction, but the money still had value and was usable.When Stokes was arrested in Oklahoma City after a routine traffic stop, officers found about $80,000 in the car, including about $30,000 from the plant, authorities said.

You and your ilk fill me with more than regret: I become burdened with a profound feeling that there is something terribly wrong with people. I don\u2019t like that. I hate that. I want to like people: I want life to be enjoyed by all. But then people like you come along, people who support you come along, people worse than you come along: all those people come along and create and prolong pain for others.\n\nScrew libel, screw defamation: I don\u2019t know you, and I probably don\u2019t know anyone who knows you; that means I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s been raped or abused by you, and yet, I\u2019m going to call you a rapist, a predator and an abuser of women. And I certainly look forward to you finding my little corner of the internet and suing me.\n\nBut: blood from a stone buddy. I probably wouldn\u2019t even bother showing up to court for that. Unfortunately, I doubt I have enough clout to ever be discovered by you. That\u2019s a shame really, because if you\u2019re not going to listen to all the other voices defaming you, you should at least read what I have to write. I wish I had the hits to climb out of the darkness into your computer, but I just have a humorous blog, that no one reads and I write novels that no one reads. Add to that, a newscaster sucks up six pages of Google when searching my name and I know I\u2019ll never get through to you. I think it\u2019s a shame, because I think you could benefit from what I have to say.\n\nWhat I have to say is this:\n\nYou nearly managed to derail years of dubious progress in regards to giving victims a voice. That\u2019s what you attempted to do. It seemed at first that you were succeeding. Your post hit all the key points a rapist would want to hit to get crowds of people to side with him and silence his victims. And on the first day, it seemed to do just that: there were over 100,000 likes on your Facebook post and of the first 30,000 comments, it looked like 90% of them were in blind support of you. I don\u2019t know why people like to blame the victims of affluent celebrities, but they sure did in those first few days.\n\nYou also announced a lawsuit against the CBC, and people supported that. I don\u2019t think many supporters realized that meant you\u2019d actually be suing them because their taxes pay for the CBC. Here\u2019s the thing: I would gladly pay more taxes just so the CBC could tie you up in litigation until you\u2019re a bankrupt, destitute old man dying of cancer in a run-down nursing home.\n\nBut then something happened (one good thing in this whole sordid tale): they turned against you. Finally, the people turned against the abuser, the perpetrator, the predator, the rapist; finally, the people began to side with the victims. And as more victims spoke out and more of your acquaintances spoke out, more people turned against you. Now we are going down a road we may have never been. Now people seem to get it. I now see a light at the end of the tunnel that maybe; just maybe, the perpetrator might pay for his crimes.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I believe there can be salvation for you. I believe forgiveness is attainable. I can\u2019t decide on how, because I\u2019m not one of your victims: but they can decide how. You can ask for their forgiveness and they can tell you if they could possibly forgive you and what you would have to do to earn that forgiveness. Each and all of them. It can start with an apology: a public and sincere apology to all of them. This is diametrically the opposite of your reprehensible post on Facebook. At the very least, if you for some improbable reason believed you had consent, believed they were willing partners, you could have apologized for your own ignorance and acknowledged that you were too stupid to understand that you didn\u2019t have consent and that what they perceived of the event was the valid perception. Not yours. The way you viewed all those past events was obviously not the truth, elsewise, there wouldn\u2019t be a whole plethora of women who felt victimized by you.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t abused, raped or preyed on women you\u2019d instead have what most guys have: prior relationships that ended. Some might have gone bad, some of the women might even have felt that you were a bad lay, a bad boyfriend, a boring guy etc.\n\nLet me restate this: if you hadn\u2019t victimized women, you wouldn\u2019t have many women feeling and stating that they were victimized by you.\n\nThis is why you need to apologize: you need to help them feel like justice has been done, because you were the one who committed an injustice against them (not to mention that you repeated this injustice over and over, and then committed more injustices by your public accounting of the situation and your attempts to silence your victims).\n\nAnd the only way for your apology to work is for you to meet the criteria by which they would grant forgiveness. Here\u2019s what could be in store for you:\n\nYou might have to individually account publicly the abuses you committed. You might never have a career again. You might have to go to court. You might have to plead guilty (or even better, plead not-guilty and throw your own case, especially not bringing up he said\/she said arguments, past or post sexual history, no witnesses on your side, no objections by your lawyers etc.). You might have to go to jail. You might have to pay restitution. You might have to beg for forgiveness. You might have to give a talk at every school about how you were a predator, rapist and abuser of women but how you learned your lesson. You might have to be in therapy for the rest of your life.\n\nAnd there might be many other things that you have to do to earn the forgiveness of your victims.\n\nWhat will you get out of this? Well, for one you might learn that you never need to ask that question again. You might learn that you are more fulfilled by asking \u201cHow will others benefit from this?\u201d You might learn to like yourself. You might learn not to hate women. You might learn not to rely on violence to give you an erection. And your teddy bear might be able to watch you at all times because he would be proud of the man you have finally become.\n\n\nSign a petition\n\nHow not to talk about rape culture\n\nCBC fires Jian Toronto Star\n\nThe law and consent\n\nHow not to react to Jian\u2019s PR\n\nWhy women stay silent\n\nThe real reason Jian sued\n\nPublic Victim #1\n\nPublic Victim #2\n\nHow predators get away\n\nDo you know about Jian?\n\n\nPowered by Facebook Comments\n\n    Follow newmanlogic on Twitter\n\n\n\n    Top Rated",

Anti-tobacco groups have accused the Government of complacency over the use of children by organised crime gangs to smuggle cigarettes into Ireland.\n\nAsh, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation said they were shocked and outraged at the investigation aired this week by RTE\u2019s Prime Time , which found children as young as 14 were being used to sell illegal and counterfeit cigarettes around the country.\n\nThe investigation found that the smuggled cigarettes were on sale openly in casual markets and estimated that each carton of 200 sold on the black market represented a loss of about \u20ac65 to the exchequer.\n\n\u201cIn the D\u00e1il yesterday, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan appears to have ruled out a tobacco price increase in the forthcoming Budget even though it would yield an estimated a badly needed \u20ac420 million to the Exchequer, without any significant impact on inflation. Instead the Minister, in a letter to us, has cited the excuse of smuggling as a reason not to increase tax on tobacco, even though there is compelling evidence to show that such an increase would deter young people from starting and encourage smokers to quit,\u201d said Irish Cancer Society chief executive John McCormack.\n\nCigarettes have particular appeal to potential smugglers because taxes often account for a large share of their price (which Brack Obama in the USA has recently raised again), making them a highly profitable product to smuggle. Economic models of smuggling are used to develop techniques for measuring the extent and nature of the worldwide cigarette smuggling problem.\n\nSee my prior post, Friday, March 27, 2009,\nCigarette Smugglers in St. Louis, New York City, Charlotte and Tampa Funnel Money to Terror Groups like Hezbollah.\nThe ICS said it was shocked by the Government\u2019s attitude to what it described as \u201ca major public health issue\u201d. There are an estimated 7,000 deaths every year related to tobacco, with 1,700 people dying from lung cancer.\n\nChief executive of the Irish Heart Foundation Michael O\u2019Shea said the organisation was angered by the Government\u2019s \u201capparent inability\u201d to control the smuggling of illicit tobacco products into Ireland.\n\n\u201cThe failure by government to tackle the growth in smuggling is not a good enough reason not to protect the health of our children from cigarette smoking. This is a national disgrace,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is not acceptable to let criminal activity dictate social measures to protect the health of our children and young people. It is not acceptable to say there will be no increase in tobacco prices \u2013 a proven deterrent to new and existing smokers \u2013 because smuggling will increase.\u201d\n\nHe called for the Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern to increase resources to deter smugglers through measures such as increased penalties and prosecutions.

        "text":"Sunday, November 28, 2010\n\nA family law case is now before the United States Supreme Court\n\nIt is rare when the United States Supreme Court hears a child support case. However, there is a\u00a0case before the Supreme Court now involving such an issue. In the case of Turner v. Price, Docket No. 10-10, Turner was incarcerated for one year for non-payment of child support. The South Carolina Court that heard the trial did not make a finding that Turner was indigent and did not appoint an attorney to represent him before sentencing him to jail. If Turner was sentenced in a criminal case, he would have had a court appointed attorney. However, in a civil contempt case, under South Carolina law, he didn\u2019t qualify for a court appointed lawyer.\nIt doesn\u2019t make any difference to a person if they are jailed in a civil case or a criminal case. Jail is jail either way. Violation of a court order may result in a case for civil or criminal contempt. The court has the power to jail people for violation of court orders. Some people violate court orders and fail to pay child support because they can\u2019t afford to pay the money. Others violate court orders and fail to pay child support because they choose to not pay the money. Clearly some people need the threat of a jail sentence or even time in jail as an incentive to pay child support. Frequently, the determination of imposing jail time is not known until the end of the hearing.\nThe case of Turner v. Price raises the issue of the constitutionality of imposing a jail sentence without the benefit of an attorney to defend the person before jail is imposed. Just as in criminal cases, the result of the civil contempt may be different if a lawyer is involved. This is an important issue as nobody should go to jail without due process and an opportunity to present a defense. These are not rights guaranteed in criminal cases. These are rights guaranteed to Americans under the United States Constitution. On the other hand, the state must pay for court appointed attorneys. If the defendant can\u2019t afford an attorney and the state must provide one then the state must also pay for the attorney. As the states are cutting budgets and court systems are experiencing large cuts in their budgets, it is difficult to argue that they should allocate money to pay attorneys to represent parents who won\u2019t pay child support. I suspect that any ruling on this case will extend to all civil contempts including contempts for non-payment of alimony and any other violation of a court order.\nThis case bears watching but we may be disappointed in the result. The court ordered the parties to brief the issue of incarceration for civil contempt without a lawyer and another issue. They also ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear this case. If the court finds no jurisdiction, they won\u2019t may any orders on the other issue. The briefs in this case are due to be filed in January and February, 2011.\n\nSunday, November 21, 2010\n\nDo-it-yourself divorce kits\n\nThere are advertisements for legal services such as do-it-yourself kits for divorce, wills, powers of attorney, bankruptcy, etc. These kits are usually sold by non-lawyers. People should not use these kits or services of this nature. Decisions in legal matters of this nature have long lasting consequences.\u00a0Failure to include all issues or failing to address an issue properly is likely to have unfortunate and expensive results. A divorce agreement should be custom designed for each couple and tailored for the state of the divorce. Kits of this nature may be general kits that accommodate most states but not all and accommodate some couples but not all. People should avoid kits and advice from non-lawyers. \u00a0Before finalizing an agreement from a do-it-yourself kit, you should consult an experienced divorce attorney.\n\nSaturday, November 20, 2010\n\nSingle parent adoption\n\nA recent case in Massachusetts addressed an issue that is frequently raised by parents who don\u2019t want to pay child support and gave the same answer as always. In the case of ADOPTION OF MARIANO, 933 N.E.2d 677 (Mass.App.Ct. 2010) the father of a child wanted to relinquish parental rights so that he wouldn\u2019t pay child support. Whenever this issue was raised in the past the court always refused to terminate parental rights. That is because the focus is the child and not the parent. Every child deserves two parents and every child deserves child support. As a result, the courts have always refused to terminate parental rights unless another adult sought to adopt the child.\nIn the case of ADOPTION OF MARIANO, 933 N.E.2d 677 (Mass.App.Ct. 2010) the mother sought a single parent adoption by which the father would relinquish all rights and duties towards the child and the mother would become a single parent. This is just another attempt to terminate parental rights of the father but with a twist. In this case, the court reached the same result and denied the single parent adoption. Parents may not bargain away their children\u2019s rights to support from either parent.\n\nSaturday, November 6, 2010\n\nGuardianships and children living with relatives.\n\nCurrently, there are many families that don\u2019t follow the traditional pattern of two parents with children. Frequently, children are living with friends and relatives instead of their parents. When this happens, the parties should go to court and get a guardianship so that the custodial adults will have all the rights to act for the children as parents can. Although guardianships sound like a permanent loss of parental rights, this is not correct. Guardianships, like all orders and judgments relating to children, can be changed if the circumstances change. The natural parent wanting the child to return to the parents home may be sufficient to terminate the guardianship. A guardianship has many advantages including education, insurance, and medical care.\nThe child can go to school from the home of the custodian. Towns spend money for every student in the school system. They frequently oppose enrolling students who live with relatives unless there is a guardianship.\nThe custodial parent can enroll the child in their family health insurance policy with a guardianship. This can be an important issue as even routine medical visits incur large bills without insurance.\nWith a guardianship, the custodial adult can give permission for medical treatment and activities. Other than emergencies, doctors shouldn\u2019t treat children without parental consent. Schools won\u2019t let children go on field trip or play sports without parental consent. Other organized activities won\u2019t allow participation without permission. While the natural parent may be available to grant permission, a guardianship gives the custodian, the ability to deal with all of these issues.\nIf you have questions about children living with relatives consult an experience Massachusetts Family Law Attorney.\n\nWednesday, November 3, 2010\n\nHealth insurance for ex-spouse\n\nMassachusetts has universal health insurance. In a divorce, this means that the judge will look for ways to provide health insurance for the entire family at the lowest cost. If there are children of the marriage, the likely result is a family health insurance policy that covers the entire family including the ex-spouse. In Massachusetts, an ex-spouse is treated as a current spouse for health insurance as long as neither spouse has remarried. People frequently think that the obligation to insure the ex-spouse means that a new spouse will be uninsured. This is not correct. Once one of the parties has remarried, the\u00a0ex-spouse is not eligible for insurance coverage under the family health insurance policy. Of course, before any decisions are made about insurance coverage, the divorce decree and agreement need to be carefully reviewed.",
