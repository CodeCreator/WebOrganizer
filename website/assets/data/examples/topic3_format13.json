        "text":"Health and Human Services Agency\n\n\n\n\u200bBeware of Text Messaging Scams Targeting EBT Card Users\n\n\n(Placerville, CA) - The El Dorado County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is advising all individuals enrolled in public assistance programs in the county who use electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards to be on the lookout for potential scammers using text messaging. While HHSA is not aware at this time of any specific victims of these text messaging scams in El Dorado County, the department wants to inform individuals of the potential risk.\n\nHHSA was recently contacted by several other county social services departments in California regarding the scam. The scam involves clients receiving a text message about their public assistance benefit that instructs them to call a number. When the client calls the number on the text message they are prompted by an automated system to \"register their EBT card\" or they won't have access to their benefits. Victims of the scam in some counties in California have entered their EBT card number, PIN and social security number, leaving themselves open to potential identify theft or benefits being stolen. Programs targeted by the scammers appear to include CalWORKs and CalFresh, though other public assistance programs may also be targeted.\u00a0\n\nEl Dorado County HHSA administers several public assistance programs for people in El Dorado County, including CalWORKs and CalFresh. HHSA reminds those with EBT cards to safeguard their personal information, account passwords and other private information. Here are a few ways to make sure your identity is not compromised:\n\n  \u2022 Know who you share information with;\n  \u2022 Store and dispose of your personal information securely, especially your Social Security number;\n  \u2022 Ask questions before deciding to share your personal information;\n  \u2022 And maintain appropriate security on your electronic devices.\n\nFor additional information about scams involving public assistance EBT cards, visit the California Department of Social Services' website at\n\nFor more information about CalWORKs, CalFresh or other public assistance programs in El Dorado County, please visit or call (530) 642-7300 in Placerville or (530) 573-3200 in South Lake Tahoe.\n\n# # #\n\n\nNote: As of May 2018, the California Department of Social Services\u00a0continues to\u00a0hear from individuals who are receiving these scam texts. Please note the following advisory from the CDSS:\n\n\u201cBeware! There is an EBT scam to\u00a0steal\u00a0your benefits! If you\u2019ve received a text or phone call asking for your personal information, contact your county right away. Your county and the state will\u00a0never\u00a0text or call you requesting your personal information such as your EBT card number and your personal identification number (PIN).\n\n\nNever give your EBT Card number and PIN to anyone. With this information, someone could steal your benefits. Always keep your PIN and EBT Card number safe and secret.\u201d",

        "text":"\ufeff NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision \ufeff\n\nDepartment of Corrections and Community Supervision\n\nNew York State\nDepartment of Correctional Services\nGlenn S. Goord, Commissioner\n\nOffice of Public Information\n[518] 457-8182\n\nFor immediate release:\n\n4 PM on Thursday, June 7, 2001\n\nCorrectional Services honors 33 employees who died in the line of duty;\nrecognizes 1 current employee with Medal of Honor, 2 others with Medal of Merit\n\nAs bagpipers played, Taps echoed and a rifle squad fired a 21-gun salute, the Department of Correctional Services at 4 p.m. today awarded three current employees medals for extraordinary service last year while honoring the memory of 33 employees who died in the line of duty as the result of inmate actions since 1861.\n\nAmong the more than 1,000 guests attending the ceremony at the permanent memorial on the grounds of the Training Academy in Albany were approximately 50 family members of some of the 33 employees who lost their lives as the result of inmate actions. Also present were 10 of the hostages from the 1971 riot at Attica and their family members. The ceremony was held during the June 5-9 statewide employee Olympics in Albany to allow the 1,750 participants to attend.\n\nIn proclaiming June 3-9 as Correctional Services Employee Week, Governor George E. Pataki wrote, \"it is fitting that New Yorkers remember and commend all Correctional employees carrying out their perilous and challenging duties with the greatest professionalism and attentiveness to public safety.\"\n\nOf the 33 fallen employees being remembered today, Governor Pataki said in a statement, \"It has been said that the great majority of people shrink from the ultimate sacrifice, but there are a few who make it with courage and honor. These few are the heroes of humanity.\"\n\nAs part of the ceremony, Commissioner Glenn S. Goord awarded:\n\n  \u2022 The Medal of Honor for bravery to Officer Glen H. Williams of Green Haven. He repeatedly placed himself between an armed inmate and Deputy Superintendent George Schneider on September 27, 2000, to block the inmate's knife attacks in a prison yard on the prison's chief security officer. He escorted Mr. Schneider, who sustained multiple stab wounds, from the yard and then returned to help disarm the inmate. CO Williams, 38, has been an Officer since 1986.\n  \u2022 A Medal of Merit for extraordinary performance to Officer Gary L. Mitchetti of Green Haven. He was stabbed twice while helping other Officers to disarm and control the inmate attacking Mr. Schneider. CO Mitchetti, 28, has been an Officer since 1997.\n  \u2022 A Medal of Merit for exceptional contribution to Officer Thomas R. Cassidy while assigned to Arthur Kill. He came to the aid of victims of a January 16, 2000, fiery multiple-vehicle accident on the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn. He assisted in removing victims from a burning vehicle and then came to aid of the injured in a second vehicle. He then assisted the efforts of medical and other rescue personnel. CO Cassidy, 30, has been an Officer since 1998. He is now assigned as an investigator in the Long Island City office of the Department's Office of the Inspector General.\n\nIn his proclamation, Governor Pataki cited \"the resourcefulness and dedication of outstanding Correctional employees\" who are recognized through the annual medals ceremony.\n\nIn his letters to each of the medals recipients, the Governor wrote \"You carry on the admired traditions of professionalism, valor and excellence which have long been the standard of the 32,000 men and women who work in 70 correctional facilities throughout the Empire state.\" (Both the Governor's proclamation and his letters to the medal recipients can be downloaded from the Department's website.)\n\nSenate Codes Committee Chairman Dale M. Volker of Depew, the Senate representative speaking at the ceremony whose district includes Attica, said, \"The individuals we recognize today powerfully remind us of the suffering and sacrifices made to ensure our safety from those who simply cannot abide by our laws. Today's tribute is a constant reminder that freedom is never free; it is a gift, selflessly purchased by others and at times at great personal cost. The names inscribed in Correctional Services' memorial room and commemorated by the memorial itself are not simply names, but a vivid reminder and warning of the perils and the price of complacency in our still dangerous and unpredictable world of Corrections.\"\n\nAssemblyman Ronald Canestrari, the Deputy Majority Leader whose district includes part of Albany County, said, \"Working in our correctional facilities is a difficult and dangerous job. Today's ceremony serves as a reminder that the important work these employees perform deserves recognition and commendation. I am honored to take part in this ceremony and acknowledge that one of our chief goals in society is to keep our citizens safe, and the work of our Correctional officers and civilian employees helps advance that goal in a meaningful and critical manner.\"\n\nCommissioner Goord said, \"Today is an important day. It is the day when we officially recommit ourselves to our future by remembering our past and present. It is through the on-going dedication, vigilance and hard work of all of our employees that we maintain the security and safety of our prisons. I appreciate the efforts of all of our employees. They led last year to the lowest rates in 20 years of inmate assaults on staff and other inmates.\"\n\nThe 33rd name added to the memorial this year is that of Clinton shop foreman Joseph A. Weitekamp. After inmates had finished working in the clothing shop on March 18, 1922, he discovered a fire under a cutting table in the shop. After telephoning for assistance, he returned to fighting the fire alone while awaiting reinforcement. Eleven days later, he died from burns and smoke inhalation.\n\nCommissioner Goord said, \"As we said during last year's dedication ceremony, we will continue to search our records to document the names of other employees who deserve to be added to this memorial. I am gratified that we have been able to confirm Mr. Weitekamp's ultimate sacrifice and add his name to this place of honor and remembrance.\"\n\nThe deceased employees now total 25 uniformed personnel and eight civilians; the total includes three women. The total comes from Attica (12), Auburn (six), Clinton (six), Sing Sing (three) and one each from Elmira, Fishkill, Eastern, Green Haven and Great Meadow prisons, plus one employee who worked in New York City in the parole division when it was part of Correctional Services until 1977.\n\nAmong them are the 11 who died in the 1971 riot at Attica. Three others held the title of Principal Keeper (now Deputy Superintendent for Security) at Auburn when they were killed by inmates in 1927, 1929 and 1930. Another was a Sing Sing Officer killed in 1916 by an escaping death row inmate who was recaptured and executed eight days later. Still another was a hospital attendant killed by a criminally insane inmate at Matteawan State Hospital (now Fishkill prison) only four days before she was to leave to attend nursing school. Another was Green Haven Correction Officer Donna Payant, murdered by an inmate in 1981. CO Payant remains the only female Officer in New York to die in the line of duty.\n\nThe ceremony took place at the permanent memorial park dedicated in 2000 on the 50-acre Academy campus. The centerpiece of the memorial park in front of the Academy is an Empire blue granite memorial that stands 12 feet high, six feet wide, 18 inches deep and weighs 19,711 pounds. It is inscribed:\n\n\"In honor of the brave men and women of the Department of Correctional Services who gave their lives in the performance of their duties on behalf of all the people of the State of New York.\"\n\nNo names are inscribed on the memorial stone. Instead, each honoree's name, identifying details and cause of death are inscribed on plaques located in the memorial room of the adjoining Academy.\n\nThe park surrounding the memorial is landscaped and decorated with assorted flowers, trees and shrubberies; an outer two-foot-high circular concrete retaining wall; park benches; lighting and 40 ballards with approximately 130 feet of decorative chains. A \"memorial mall\" of stone, highlighted by three flag poles (displaying the national, state and MIA flags), connects the monument site with the entrance to the Academy.\n\nThe Academy itself was constructed in 1952 by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany as the Mater Christi Seminary. The Department leased the facility and grounds in 1973 and purchased the complex in 1987. Approximately 1,000 Correction Officer recruits train at the facility in an average year, with an equal number of higher-level staff receiving specialized training there annually. The Academy has a staff of approximately 45.\n\nNotes to media:\n\n  \u2022 Those wanting still photographs of the memorial service or awards ceremony can download them after our targeted posting at 7:30 p.m. today on our website: www.doccs.ny.gov Call DOCS with any problems at [518] 457-8182.\n  \u2022 Those wanting a video feed of same should look to this Ku-band satellite window:\n\n    Program start: 7:00:00 p.m. June 7 Program End: 7:15:00 p.m. June 7\n\n    Satellite: GE 5 Location: 79 degrees west longitude\n\n    Transponder: 16 Lower Receive frequency: 12155 MHZ\n\n    Audio: 6.2 or 6.8 MHZ (mono) Polarity: Horizontal\n\n    SUNYSAT tech support hotline: [518] 453-9521 or, if busy, [518] 443-5333",

In November, four women who were injured by the Pinnacle mesh were awarded $26.7 million by a jury in Miami.\n\nIn September, a jury in Texas ordered Boston Scientific to pay $73 million to a woman who was injured by the Obtryx mesh. However, the award was halved to $34 million under state law capping punitive damages.\n\nBoston Scientific and other mesh-manufacturers are accused of failing to adequately warn about the risk of complications, including erosion, infection, chronic pain, and the need for multiple corrective surgeries.

Even if the message looks like it comes from a legitimate charity, it could be a trick and include links to a copycat website. If you want to donate, contact the charity directly at a website or phone number you know to be valid.\n\nWatch out for pushy telemarketers who refuse to answer your questions, offer to pick up your donation or pressure you for a credit card number.

Since no solution to increasing First Nation representation on jury rolls can occur without working directly with First Nation partners, we will form an implementation committee that includes representatives from the First Nations community and from various government ministries. The committee will consider the report's recommendations, and how they might be implemented. A provincial advisory group will also be set up to provide advice to the Attorney General on matters relating to First Nations and the justice system.\n\nMr. Iacobucci's report will help the ministry build on its ongoing efforts to improve participation of First Nations individuals on jury rolls and the government's ongoing efforts to build constructive, co-operative relationships with First Nations partners in Ontario through mutual respect, dignity, and meaningful participation in decision-making.\n\nI would like to thank Mr. Iacobucci, the many individuals and organizations who contributed to this review, and his team for their dedication and hard work in preparing this report.\"\u00a0\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nMedia Contacts\n\n\n\nGovernment Law and Safety Aboriginal People",

Brown\nCommissioner Daniel Derenda\n\nHome \u00bb Press Releases \u00bb 2008 News Archive \u00bb Mayor Brown \/ BPD Announce Chippewa District Public Safety Plan\n\nMayor Brown \/ BPD Announce Chippewa Entertainment District Public Safety Plan\n\nMayor Reiterates Zero Tolerance of Criminal Conduct\n\nBUFFALO \u2013 Mayor Byron W. Brown and Buffalo Police Commissioner H. McCarthy Gipson today discussed aspects of the city's commitment to maintaining public safety in the Buffalo's downtown entertainment district, as well as elsewhere in the city.\n\n\"The recent violent behavior in the Chippewa Entertainment District is unacceptable and I will not tolerate anyone who resorts to violence here or anywhere else in the City of Buffalo,\" said Mayor Brown. \"We will utilize every resource available to us, including the future deployment of 100 new Buffalo police officers, to ensure the safety of residents, business owners and visitors. Our response is consistent with my Administration's long established Zero Tolerance Public Safety policy, which targets criminal activity in any section of Buffalo and has contributed to a 6% drop in crime in the city over the past two years.\"\n\nThe Chippewa Entertainment District Public Safety Plan includes the deployment of the Buffalo Police Department's highly successful Mobile Response Unit, the utilization of the Department's new mobile surveillance security camera and the continuing monitoring and investigation of area businesses for compliance with city ordinances and state laws.\n\n\"We have thoroughly reviewed our operational plans concerning the downtown entertainment district and we've decided to increase our police presence to even a greater degree,\" said Commissioner Gipson. \"That includes the addition of the mobile surveillance camera, the mobile command center and other initiatives that we're not at liberty to discuss for investigative reasons. We will continue to do whatever is necessary to ensure the safety and security of anyone visiting our downtown.\"\n\nThis activity is consistent with other multi-departmental actions that have taken place over the past two years including the expanded nationally award-winning Save Our Streets Task Force neighborhood \"Clean Sweeps\" and Mayor Brown's Working Against Violent Events effort that led to the September 2007 arrest of a suspected gunman responsible for two homicides on Buffalo's East Side.\n\n\"As I have stated repeatedly, I will not tolerate criminal activity anywhere in Buffalo,\" said Mayor Brown. \"Whether it takes place in a city residential neighborhood where law abiding city residents have the right to live their lives in peace and comfort or in our city's Entertainment District, where city residents and visitors can come and expect to enjoy a night out without any concern for their personal safety. This is not a band-aid response to any specific incident. This is a reminder that the professional men and women of our Buffalo Police Department and other city agencies will perform their duties to the best of their ability and they will continue their excellent service on behalf of city residents, business owners and visitors.\"\n\nViolent crime continues to decrease in the City of Buffalo. Through December, all four categories of violent crime \u2013 Homicide, Rape, Robbery and Assault \u2013 are down by 12% collectively versus the same time period in 2006.\n\nThe city's new 100 high-tech surveillance camera system and the Police Department's new police class, which will add approximately 100 new police officers to the Department by July 2008, will strengthen the Department's other ongoing anti-crime initiatives, including the ongoing and successful Mobile Response Unit, which is a specialized anti-crime unit that targets areas of high crime, illegal guns, gang activity and drug trafficking throughout Buffalo.\n\nSince it began operations in January 2007, the MRU has made 2,638 arrests, issued 5,998 summonses, impounded 655 vehicles, seized $191,433 in cash and removed 165 illegal weapons from the streets.\n\nThe number of guns seized by the MRU is in addition to the 878 illegal guns that were removed from Buffalo streets in one day in June 2007 during the City's No Questions Asked Gun Buyback effort.",

        "text":"In an emergency always call 999\n\nAppeal after motorbike and tools are stolen from Birch Vale\n\nPosted on 2nd February 2017\n\nWe are appealing for information after a motorbike and a haul of tools were stolen in Birch Vale.\n\nOvernight between Tuesday, January 31 and Wednesday, February 1, we received reports of six crimes in the Birch Vale area, which saw thieves targeting vans and outbuildings.\n\nA variety of Stihl tools, including a chainsaw, strimmer, and a hedge trimmer, were stolen after thieves smashed the window of a garden shed on Batemill Road. (17000045044)\n\nOn the same night a red Honda motorbike, with a partial registration of \u2018YJ55\u2019, was stolen from an outbuilding on Spinnerbottom in Birch Vale. Thieves removed the beading from the door before reaching inside for the key.\n\nA van parked on Sycamore Road was also targeted by thieves. They forced the sliding door before climbing in and stealing a tool box containing spanners, sockets, and a Milwaukee impact wrench.\n\nPC Adam Harrison said: \u201cWe are working hard to find those responsible for committing these crimes but we are also asking for your help. Did you see any suspicious vehicles in the area, or do you have CCTV that may be able to help our investigations? If so, please get in touch.\n\n\u201cThieves are targeting vans and outbuildings for tools so it is important to take steps to protect your property and deter thieves. Ensure that vans and outbuildings are properly secured with a sturdy lock and that all tools are security marked to deter a thief. Don\u2019t make it easy for them by ensuring that any valuables, particularly tools, are removed from vehicles overnight and stored securely. It only takes a few minutes but can prevent a lot of hassle if it stops a thief from breaking into your vehicle.\u201d\n\nOther crime prevention advice includes:\n\n  \u2022 Before leaving your vehicle unattended, ensure it is properly locked, with the windows up and the alarm activated;\n  \u2022 Wipe away any visible marks left behind by a phone cradle or sat nav;\n  \u2022 Where possible, try to remove all valuable items, especially tools, out of the vehicle completely.\n  \u2022 Security mark all of your valuables to help make them easily identified and traceable should they be stolen and recovered. This also makes them less\u00a0attractive to thieves;\n  \u2022 Remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to police on 101 or 999 in an\u00a0emergency.\n\nAnyone with any information about the thefts is asked to contact PC Adam Harrison on 101, or by sending him a message here\n\nYou can also report a crime anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\n\nDo you need a quick answer to a general question? Then we recommend you visit the national Ask The Police web site.",

        "text":"2013 Julius Stone Address: Professor Brian Leiter\n\n14 August 2013\n\nOnline registration\nThis event is now fully registered. To join a waiting list, please email\n\nSydney Law School is please to announce the 2013 Julius Stone Address guest speaker, American philosopher and legal academic, Professor Brian Leiter (University of Chicago).\n\n\"The Case against Free Speech\"\n\nWestern liberal democracies are rife with institutions that view massive restrictions on speech as essential to realizing the ends of liberal democracies. In universities and schools, for example, no one thinks the classroom should be turned over to unregulated expression of opinion, without regard to cognitive value, civility, or pedagogical purpose.Professor Leiter's focus shall be on the courts. In courts, the idea that the unbridled freedom of speech - the \"unfettered exchange of ideas\" to quote a typical formulation of the United States Supreme Court - has any value is rejected from the start. We recognize a plethora of epistemic reasons - reasons pertaining to the discovery of the truth - for restricting speech. There are obvious disanaologies between the courtroom and the polity at large, but the aim of this Lecture is to explore those in some detail.Professor Leiter willargue that to the extent there are reasons to have less regulation of speech in society at large, these pertain only to the epistemic reliability of our institutional mechanisms for restricting speech.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nBrian Leiter is Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence and Director of the Center for Law, Philosophy & Human Values at the University of Chicago, where he has taught since 2008. He taught previously at the University of Texas at Austin (1995-2008), the University of San Diego School of Law (1993-1995) and, as a visiting professor, at University College London (Philosophy), Oxford University (Philosophy), Yale University (Law), University of Paris X-Nanterre (Law), and University of California, San Diego (Philosophy).\n\nProfessor Leiterteaches and writes primarily in the areas of moral, political, and legal philosophy, in both Anglophone and Continental traditions. He is the author of Nietzsche on Morality(Routledge, 2002),Naturalizing Jurisprudence(Oxford, 2007), andWhy Tolerate Religion?(Princeton, 2013), as well as many articles in such journals asEthics, Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Philosopher's Imprint, Social Philosophy & Policy, Journal of the History of Philosophy, Yale Law Journal, Columbia Law Review, Australasian Journal of Philosophy, Law & Philosophy,and elsewhere.\n\nHe has edited a number of volumes, includingThe Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy(2007) (with Michael Rosen),Nietzsche and Morality(Oxford, 2007) (with Neil Sinhababu),The Future for Philosophy(Oxford, 2004),Nietzsche(Oxford Reading in Philosophy, 2001) (with John Richardson), and Objectivity in Law and Morals(Cambridge, 2001). He is the founding editor of the Routledge Philosophersbook series and (with Leslie Green) ofOxford Studies in the Philosophy of Law. He was previously co-editor for eight years ofLegal Theory, and also currently serves on the editorial boards ofNotre Dame Philosophical Reviews, Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Journal of Moral Philosophy, The Philosopher's Annual, Oxford Bibliographies Online: Philosophy, Theoria(Sweden), Anilisi e Diritto(Italy),Problema: Anuario de Filosofia y Teor\u00eda(Mexico),Nietzsche Online(Germany), andRevista de Teor\u00eda Jur\u00eddica(Argentina).\n\nProfessor Leiter has given or is scheduled to give a number of named lectures at universities around the world, including the Taylor Lecture in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Otago in New Zealand, the Fresco Lectures in the Department of Jurisprudence at the University of Genoa in Italy, the Bernd Magnus Lecture in the Department of Philosophy at the University of California at Riverside, and the 'Or 'Emet Lecture at Osgoode Hall School of Law at York University, Toronto.\n\nThis event is generously sponsored by the Educational Heritage Foundation\n\nLawyers\/barristers: attendance at this lecture is equal to 1.5 MCLE\/CPD unit.\n\nTime: 6-7.30pm (registration from 5.30pm)\n\nLocation: Sydney Law School, Building F10, Eastern Avenue, University of Sydney\n\nCost: Free, however registration is essential\n\nContact: PLaCE Coordinator\n\nPhone: (02) 9351 0323\n\nEmail: 005545780412070c181970211e1725360f1a555245671322",

The free legal advice-a-thon will facilitate access to justice for low- and modest-income people, including the homeless, by engaging lawyers in advising pre-scheduled and drop-in clients on all legal\u00a0issues.\n\nThe open-air legal advice clinics will be held over four days - one day in each city - and will rely on the volunteer efforts of over 100 lawyers. Participating lawyers will be encouraged to obtain pledges from family, friends and co-workers in direct support of pro bono programs operated by Access Pro\u00a0Bono.\n\nLast year, we raised over $50,000 for pro bono programming in BC. This year, our goal is to raise $60,000, and we need your support to help us reach our\u00a0target!\n\nPlease visit for more details and to support our important\u00a0cause.\n\nSeptember 11, 2012 - 10:00am\nHyack Square\n774 Columbia Street\nNew Westminster, BC",

The state of Connecticut alone experienced a number of bus collisions in 2012. As many Connecticut residents are aware, another tragic bus accident occurred very recently. Unfortunately another individual has just died as a result of the crash.\n\nThe driver of the pickup truck who was hit head on by a bus died from crash related injuries on Wednesday, February 6th. This brings the total number dead from this crash to eight. The incident, which occurred in California, is still being investigated by authorities. The cause of the crash is unknown at this time.\n\nThe driver of the bus indicates the brakes failed to work properly. Investigators analyzing the details of the crash found that this particular bus has a history of brake problems. Other potential reasons for the crash include driver fatigue and road conditions.\n\nThe bus was carrying 38 people at the time of the incident. The bus hit the truck driver and then flipped, spilling wreckage and people around the scene. The victims of this incident may bring a civil suit against the driver of the bus or the bus company if evidence indicates either\u2019s negligence lead to the crash.\n\nEven if the brakes are not found to have been faulty, if the driver was negligent, the company may still be held responsible for the incident. Under the concept of respondeat superior, an employer is liable for the negligent conduct of its employees if such activity is done within the scope of employment. Substantial investigation and evidence is required in order to be successful in such a suit.\n\nSource: Connecticut Post, \u201cCalifornia tour bus collision death toll rises to eight,\u201d Feb. 6, 2013.",
