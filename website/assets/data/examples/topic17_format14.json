        "text":"\n\nDue to the intellectual and political trajectory of the Western world, we exist not as peoples with states, but inside them. And among those who have cultivated a mindset of \u201csaving\u201d their nation, the hardest pill to swallow is that they will only be able to save those who elect to save themselves\u2014to form a diasporic tribe rather than being dissolved into the homogenizing mass of consumption and nihilism. 5PT is about studying, defining, and implementing the ideal of the diasporic tribe.\n\nIt is becoming anachronistic to speak of ourselves as belonging a particular nation, since those nations do not even care for their own existence. This is a dangerous paradigm to remain trapped in, but the diaspora model is a way out. We should embrace this de-nationalization in recognizing that ethnocentric Europeans and Eurocolonials who want to have a future are an unconscious stateless people who we need to awaken into the Western diaspora.\n\n5PT, unlike most other political theories, will not focus on wielding power in the international state system or directing it at other groups internally, but on creating spaces and networks for our people which are capable of resisting the trends that work against us. Rather than engaging in theories of global conflict or coexistence between nations, of more interest is finding ways to live with the conflicts inside countries or civilization blocs that threaten our existence as a diaspora, and using the power we cultivate and acquire to secure our interests as a tribe.\n\nInstead of a preoccupation with nationalism, statism, or electoral politics, 5PT is about the self-selected tribe, no questions asked and nothing owed to others unless necessary for its perpetuity. It is not about the capture and direction of a state but the creation of folk communities and ethnic networks both sub-national and trans-national, capable of enduring under any state that would tolerate them and able to assist those living where they are not tolerated. As these communities and networks develop, they will allow us to be more influential in both world affairs and our own self-governance. Such will be the essence of the diasporic tribe.\n\nRemember, this is not your country and not your system. You are the outsider, and yet you have been trained to be loyal to a master who does not value you. You are the sons and daughters of a civilization that has fallen. Your task, should you take it up, is to build a stronger and more resilient tribe than all the rest with its own culture and institutions in order to navigate the world we live in. This is the first step towards achieving anything beyond what our raw numbers enable. I believe that the power of the Western diaspora is yet to be realized, and that we must do so.\n\nAs this blog progresses, I hope to expand the 5PT to cover a variety of important topics and ideas pertinent to the conception and development of the diaspora model. Tentative key concepts and influences of the 5PT which shall be expanded upon include:\n\n  1. The De-Nationalization of the Global European Diaspora\n  2. The Necessity of a New State-Agnostic Model\n  3. Sub-National and Trans-National Identity as a Response to the Loss of Nation-Statehood\n  4. Contributions of Fourth Generation Warfare (4GW) to De-Nationalized Thinking\n  5. Models from the Millennia of Jewish Diaspora\n  6. Learning from Extant \u201cWhite Tribes\u201d: The Amish and The Mennonites\n  7. A Post-Electoral Perspective on the Presence of Outsiders\n  8. Diversification of Location: Suitability of Regions Beyond the \u201cFirst World\u201d\n  9. Civil Defense\n  10. Thoughts on Tribal Praxis\n  11. Archaeofuturism and the Diasporic Tribe\n  12. The Fifth Political Theory and the Fourth Political Theory\n  13. Left-Wing, Right-Wing, or Rejecting\n  14. The Armenian Genocide\n\nOther topics that have come up while working on 5PT:\n\nSee here for a complete list of 5PT articles, and here for a list of authors 5PT aims to discuss\u2026 eventually.\n\nTwitter page here.",

Need examples, look at every mass shooting in recent history and you'll find they've all happened in Gun Free Zones. How exactly is Otter putting human life at risk? People are exercising their 2nd Amendment rights around you all the time and you are blissfully unaware. The arguments you people use are the same tired arguments that were used when CCW was first considered and made legal and none of your doomsday predictions about wild west shootouts have come to fruition off campus, what makes you so sure they will happen inside the invisible borders of BSU, UI, or ISU? You don't like guns-don't carry one. But, your lack of resolve to defend yourself based on your fear of an inanimate object should not negate my right to self defense regardless of wether or not I'm on a campus or across the street from campus. It would have been better if our legislature would have not passed this law and just nullified the campus policy banning guns, but they didn't. They compromised, placing more stringent restricitions on those who wish to carry on campus, so much so that very few will be willing or able to meet these restrictions.\n\n8 likes, 24 dislikes\nPosted by Mike Taylor on 03\/13\/2014 at 11:04 AM\n\nRe: \u201cCurt McKenzie's No-Huddle Offense\n\n\"No. 1: What's going to happen when a professor is in front of 275 students in a Boise State lecture hall and sees the barrel of a gun underneath somebody's sweater? The professor, or even a student in that class, is going to contact us. How do we investigate, and yes, we'll have to investigate, with the least disruption to that class? Some people say, 'You're just going to have to assume that it's one of the good guys with a gun, and you can walk away.' Well, the police don't walk away. We're going to have to have some kind of contact with that individual with the gun. How do we do that?\"\n\nHow do they do it off campus? This is idiotic. If the individual is not brandishing their weapon and is simply experiencing what is essentially a wardrobe malfunction why is there any need to contact that individual?\n\n\"No. 2: If guns are taken out during some kind of dispute between two individuals, and a uniformed police officer comes to the scene and confronts those individuals, what's going to be their reaction in a split second? Police are instructed to yell: 'Police! Drop the weapon!' You better be dropping those weapons in a millisecond.\"\n\nAny prudent individual is going to obey those orders. Just like off campus. These really are ignorant arguments. I would have hoped for more from the ranking andministrator or the largest city police department in the state. Seriously.\n\nWe've tried gun free zones and it's well apperant that they don't work against determined individuals who wish to do harm to large numbers of people. If my child was at BSU I'd prefer to know that there is at least a chance that in an active shooter scenario there may be at least one good guy with a gun.

At the same time if you want this to work it has to be applied uniformly and not allow charges to be bargained away.\n\n\"Why is it that NO other countries in the civilized world have to do such a thing?\"\n\nIsrael does this, and quite successfully. Active shooter scenarios typically end when the shooter is confronted with equal force. This fact has influenced LEO tactics. They no longer wait for SWAT because they know that the shooter will likely turn his weapon on himself when confronted. Why not allow school staff that wish to carry concealed and go through state mandated certification to do so? The faster we can respond with kind force to these psychos the better right? Besides it would provide a deterrent to the potential shooter if they knew that schools weren't totally defenseless.\n\n4 likes, 2 dislikes\nPosted by Mike Taylor on 03\/02\/2013 at 9:33 PM\n\nAll Comments \u00bb\n\nFavorite Places\n\n  \u2022 None.\nFind places \u00bb\n\nSaved Events\n\n  \u2022 Nada.\nFind events \u00bb\n\nSaved Stories\n\nFind stories \u00bb\n\nCustom Lists\n\n  \u2022 Zip.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Boise Weekly\n\nWebsite powered by Foundation",

His PhD project deals with questions concerning political culture in the Jordanian protest movements during the Arab Spring.\n\n\nAl-harakat and the political culture of Jordan's Arab Spring\n\nThe thesis describes the disunity within the protest movements (al-harakat) that emerged in Jordan in 2011, and it uses ethnographic material and interviews from some of the key actors and events in the history of these movements, e.g., from the protest movement in Dhiban, which many Jordanian political activists regard as the beginning of \u201dJordan's Arab Spring\u201d, from the protest movement in Haie al-Tafileh, one of the strongest protest movements in Amman in 2011, from the Higher Committee for Military Veterans, an organization led by retired military officers, who stood for the first \u2013 among the military \u2013 organized expression of discontent against the regime in the country's recent history, and from attempts to coordinate the protest movements' demands and strategies through the umbrella organization Youth of 24 March.\n\nIn all these meetings, conferences, and activities, there was a group of political activists who claimed to understand why the protest movements fragmented and tried countering this by coordinating the protest movements, institutionalizing them and getting them to work together to develop concrete alternatives to Jordan's current constitution, election and political party law, and to create an institution that oversees that the security services do not intervene in the parliamentary elections, and so on. Several of these activists had been members of a Jordanian political party, but were now politically independent because of what they perceived as an authoritarian political culture and certain ideological dead ends within these parties. These activists were driven by a, in a Jordanian context, relatively new understanding of political activism, which has points of contact with the reformulation of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany that began in the late 19th century and the reformulation of the opposition movements in Eastern Europe where especially Solidarity was a pioneer. The thesis is a study of a Jordanian reformulated activism in 2011, which never became dominant among the protest movements. The thesis is in this respect a counterfactual study of Jordan's Arab Spring.\n\nResearch funding\/grants\n\n\n  \u2022 Helge Ax:son Johnsons stiftelse: Scholarship\n\nInformation about past activities can be found in the Department\u2019s previous Annual Reports.",

By trade, I am a sign-maker at Safe-T-Lite, in Modesto, and I am also a musician with a love for community and family.\n\nGrowing up, my father was active in local politics in Ceres, and both of my parents openly discussed their voting habits and beliefs, which were not subject to hard party-line rules. I have been aware of politics for the majority of my life, and through my parents' actions and discussion, I have been able to understand and appreciate differing ideologies. Thus, it was easy for me to abandon the idea of a two-party system. For a time, I was registered with the Green Party, in search of a political organization that would best represent my views.\n\nI admit, in my young adult years, I was not as active in politics - and I even neglected my voting rights for a period of time. As our society has become more divided, however, I have felt compelled to contribute to causes in which I believe and foster political engagement in those around me. My values and core beliefs, particularly as they relate to personal freedom, were naturally in line with Libertarian philosophies, and I openly embraced the party upon discovering it. I was recruited as an organizer, stepped up to the challenge of being a party leader, and am now a candidate to represent my district in the California State Assembly.\n\nI believe in personal freedom, that every person has a right to make their own choices regarding their life and body. I believe in the constitution, and I recognize that we live in a republic, not a democracy. I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I believe in an armed citizenship. I believe consenting adults have the right to engage in whichever mutually agreeable activities they may choose. I believe the government should have limits and that it has expanded beyond comfortable limits. I believe that it should not be the prerogative of government officials to continually pay themselves more, on the backs of hardworking citizens, while creating and imposing ever-more rules for us to follow - rules for which they, as lawmakers, do not even hold themselves to appropriately.\n\nIf you believe in these values and the growth of our community and freedom, I encourage you to vote for me for State Assembly District 21 representative on November 6th. Together, we can make a difference and enjoy the freedoms to which each individual is entitled.\n\nLearn more at: Facebook - Quigley for Assembly\n\nThank you!\nJustin Quigley\nChair, Libertarian Party of Stanislaus County\nCandidate for State Assembly, District 21",

        "text":"Dear County Delegate,\n\nMy name is Dean Cox. I am a candidate for the Washington County Commission. As a Washington County native, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been raised in St. George. While growing up, I had my regular chores which included milking the family cow and tending the large family garden. My parents taught me early in life the importance of hard work, integrity and service.\n\nI met LaRene Leavitt while at studying at BYU. This spring will mark our 38th year together. Washington County was a great place for each of us to grow up and we decided it was exactly where we wanted to live and raise our family. We are proud of our four children and nine grandchildren.\n\nIn 1981, partnering with my brother Bob and his wife, we purchased the family business. For more than 30 years we operated Colorland Sales and Service, on North Bluff. It was there that I learned about paying taxes, meeting payroll obligations and working with the public.\n\nAs a ham radio enthusiast, emergency preparations and communications were something I felt very strongly about. That's why I volunteered, in my free time, to help maintain the Sheriff's radios and to serve as the County's Emergency Communications Coordinator.\n\nThat early community service eventually led me to more involvement. Following the Quail Lake Dike Disaster in 1990, then County Commissioner Gayle Aldred recognized a need for a County's Emergency Services Director and asked me if I would be willing to serve in that capacity. I was honored and willingly agreed.\n\nAs the County's Emergency Services Director, I wrote the first Washington County Emergency Response Plan and worked to make our communities safer by improving communication capabilities for Search and Rescue, local Fire Departments and other First Responders. These efforts proved pivotal when the Great Flood of 2005 put those plans and preparations to the test.\n\nAt the State level, I was elected Chairman of the State 911 Committee and helped expand the Emergency 911 Network to include compatibility with cellular telephones.\n\nFor the past seven years my primary assignment has been working closely with the Washington County Commission as County Administrator. This assignment has involved all aspects of the county's operations, including budgets, BLM and Forest Service, the Habitat Conservation Plan and the working towards the transfer of public lands. I know the issues confronting our County. I have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to hit the ground running.\n\nI love Washington County, its communities, and the people who live here. I hope that through my lifetime of service to both the Washington County Republican Party and the public that I have earned your confidence and trust.\n\nIf elected, I will of course resign my position as County Administrator and focus 100 percent of my time, energy and effort working to protect your rights and freedoms as only an effective County Commissioner can. I pledge to work hard for the Citizens of this great County.\n\nMy door will always be open to you and I hope you will contact me with any questions or concerns you may have.\n\nYour support is vital. Together, we can be successful.\n\nThank you!\n\nDean J. Cox\n\nHome phone: (435) 673-1987 Cellphone: (435) 668-5734\n\nWebpage: Email:\n\n\n\n\"I believe in protecting our rights.\"",

Many can be housed safely within appropriate settings in our existing facilities. But others need higher levels of care, more treatment and more intensive intervention for their own safety and that of others. That's why I support the Department of Correction's request for permission to issue $70 million in bonds for a 579-bed secure mental health facility at the prison complex south of Boise.\nSource: Idaho 2013 State of the State Address , Jan 7, 2013\n\nImprove offender assessment to reduce inmate population\n\nLet's talk for a minute about some of what our State government is doing to avoid wasting the people's labors.
