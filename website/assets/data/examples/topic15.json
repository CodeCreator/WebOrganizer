        "text":"Levulinic Acid Market Report\n\nLevulinic Acid Market Analysis And Segment Forecasts To 2020\n\nPublished: March 2015 \u00a0|\u00a0 75 Pages \u00a0|\u00a0 Format: PDF \u00a0|\u00a0 Report ID: 978-1-68038-068-2\n\nIndustry Insights\n\nLevulinic acid, also known as 4-oxopentanoic acid, is an organic compound which is classified as a keto acid. Its physical form is a white crystalline solid and is soluble in water, ethanol, and diethyl ether, but is insoluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons. In recent years, the need for sustainability has constantly driven the chemical industry towards exploring renewable chemistry and biotechnology to develop products from bio-based sources. These products are developed with an objective of using them as \u201cplatforms\u201d for manufacturing a host of industrial and specialty chemicals to replace their synthetic counterparts. Levulinic acid has long since been identified as such a platform chemical. As a result of this, in spite of its relatively small market size, it has been the subject of significant R&D to act as a precursor to specialty chemicals including fuel additives such as Methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), pesticides such as D-amino levulinic acid (DALA), Diphenolic Acid (DPA) and so on. The technology to produce bio-based levulinic acid is not very complicated, with the most widely used approach being the dehydrative treatment of biomass or carbohydrates with acid. Other key technologies include hydrolysis of acetyl succinate esters, acid hydrolysis of furfuryl alcohol and by oxidation of ketones with ozone. Presently, levulinic acid finds applications in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, cosmetics, food additives and minor uses in nylons, synthetic rubbers, and plastics.\u00a0\n\nWith key raw materials for bio-based levulinic acid being biomass, bagasse, manure and brewery waste, supply at feasible cost has been a challenge for market participants. Additionally, as with any bio-based replacement chemical, the price has been a burning issue in the levulinic acid market. At current prices ranging between USD 5 per kilo and USD 8 per kilo, manufacturers are faced with a daunting task of matching target prices of close to USD 1 per kilo to penetrate into the downstream platform applications. With a number of R&D initiatives expected to move towards commercialization over the next six years, it is expected that levulinic acid prices shall become more competitive in the coming future. Favorable regulatory scenario and growth in application markets are expected to have a positive influence on levulinic acid demand over the next six years.\n\nApplication Insights\n\nKey application segments analyzed and reported in this study include pharmaceuticals, food additives, cosmetics, and agriculture applications such as Organic potassium fertilizer DALA, 2--Methylindole-3-acetic acid. Presently, levulinic acid is serving niche markets, owing to its high price. Levulinic acid demand for agriculture applications and other pesticides is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% from 2014 to 2020. Major levulinic acid uses in pharmaceuticals include calcium levulinate and indomethacin, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, prescribed for fever. Levulinic acid demand for pharmaceutical applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% from 2014 to 2020. Apart from these applications, levulinic acid is also sparingly used in cigarettes to increase nicotine delivery in smoke and binding of nicotine to neural receptors. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nDownstream Potential Insights\n\nKey downstream potential applications for levulinic acid analyzed and reported in this study include methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), delta-aminolevulinic acid (DALA), ethyl levulinate, diphenolic acid (DPA) and others. Commercial scale application for levulinic acid has recently been linked to automobile fuel extenders, primarily MTHF, which is miscible with gasoline in all proportions and displays favorable oxygenate and vapor pressure properties. Intermediates during conversion of the levulinic acid to MTHF include \u03b3 -Valero lactone (GVL) and 1,4 pentanediol, which are also attractive products in their own right. It is estimated that levulinic acid manufacturers could face a potential demand of over 20,000 kilo tons from MTHF applications by 2020.\u00a0\n\nLevulinic acid market volume share by application, 2013\n\n\nRegional Insights\n\nNorth America was the largest levulinic acid consumer in 2013, followed by Europe and the rapidly developing Asia Pacific market. European and U.S. based downstream companies usually source levulinic acid from Chinese manufacturers at low prices for their respective application. For example, Segetis is reported to be sourcing levulinic acid from China for its L-ketals product portfolio. Europe was the second largest consumer for levulinic acid in 2012, accounting for over 31% of the global volumes. North America levulinic acid market revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2014 to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCompetitive Insights\n\nKey market participants for levulinic acid include Segetis, Biofine, DuPont, Hebei Langfang Triple Well Chemicals Co., Ltd., Hebei Shijiazhuang Worldwide Furfural & Furfuryl Alcohol Funan Resin Co., Ltd., Jiangsu Yancheng China Flavor Chemicals Co., Ltd., Shijiazhuang Pharmaceutical Group Ouyi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Apple Flavor & Fragrance Co., Ltd. Biofine has been one of the leading participants in the levulinic acid space, focusing on MTHF and DALA downstream applications. Segetis, a Minnesota-based company, recently developed a molecule on esters of levulinic acid made from corn cobs and bio based hydroxyl compounds. Levulinic acid is to be used as raw material for the manufacturing of plasticizers, solvents, and polyols for polyurethane foams. Levulinic acid acts as a potential replacement to phthalate plasticizer added to manufacture PVC, the largest consumed commodity plastic.\n\nKey questions answered by the report\nRequest for Customization\n\nChoose License Type:\n\nSingle User - $4,950\nMulti User - $7,950\nEnterprise User - $9,950\n\nSpecial Pricing & Discounts\n\nAvail customized purchase options to meet your research needs:\n\n  \u2022 Buy sections of this report\n  \u2022 Buy country level reports\n  \u2022 Request for historical data\n  \u2022 Request discounts available for Start-Ups & Universities\n\nWhy Choose Us\n\n  \u2022 Research support\n\n    24\/5 Research support\n\n    Get your queries resolved from an industry expert.\u00a0Request for a free product review before report purchase.\n\n  \u2022 Custom research service\n\n    Custom research service\n\n    Speak to the report author to design an exclusive study to serve your research needs.\n\n  \u2022 Quality assurance\n\n    Quality assurance\n\n    A testimonial for service excellence represented in the form of BBB \"A\" Accreditation.\n\n  \u2022 BBB Rating dandb\n  \u2022 Information security\n\n    Information security\n\n    Your personal and confidential information is safe and secure.\n\n  \u2022 BOA",

        "text":"Offshore UK Catcher Development to Hit 60,000 Bpd Target Ahead of Plan\n\nCatcher is expected to reach an output rate of 60,000 barrels of oil per day in April.\n\nIn its latest results update on Thursday, Premier Oil revealed that the Catcher development, located offshore UK, is expected to reach an output rate of 60,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) ahead of plan.\n\nFollowing initial projections that the production milestone would be reached by the first half of 2018, the company now anticipates that this output figure will be hit in April.\n\nFirst oil at Catcher was achieved in December 2017, on schedule and under budget. During January this year, the project was producing at around 20,000 bopd, which analysts at investment banking firm Jefferies noted was \u2018double the guided expectation\u2019 at that point.\n\nPremier recorded production of 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2017, which was slightly higher than its 2016 output of 71,400 boepd. The company reported cash flows $496 million from operations during the year, which was up 15 percent on 2016, as well as a positive free cash flow of $71.2 million and a reduction of net debt to $2.7 billion. EBITDAX also increased to $589.7 million in 2017, up from $494.1 million in 2016.\n\nIn a brief research note sent to Rigzone, oil and gas analysts at GMP FirstEnergy described Premier Oil\u2019s latest update as \u2018positive\u2019, stating that the company\u2019s financials were \u2018in line\u2019.\n\n\u201c2017 was a successful year for Premier,\u201d Tony Durrant, Premier Oil chief executive, said in a company statement.\n\n\u201c2018 will see further production growth, allowing us to deliver on our plans for reducing net debt to restore balance sheet strength while also progressing projects that deliver the highest financial returns,\u201d he added.\n\nGenerated by readers, the comments included herein do not reflect the views and opinions of Rigzone.

        "text":"\n\n\n\nDays after heavy limestone slabs fell 36 stories from the side of a Loop skyscraper to LaSalle Street, the Daley administration on Wednesday moved to require an accelerated schedule of rigorous inspections for high-rise facades.\n\nOn a related front, officials said the city may ask state regulators to conduct a formal review of the licenses of architectural engineers who just months ago inspected and declared safe the facade at 1 N. LaSalle St., where the limestone fell Sunday.\n\n\"You have to get up close and personal with the terra cotta or whatever you're dealing with, and obviously somebody missed some substantial pieces here,\" said Mark Limanni, a top deputy in the city's Law Department.\n\nA new city requirement could call for \"critical\" inspections--which feature section-by-section, hands-on checks of cladding by technicians on scaffolding--every two years for all buildings at least 80 feet or six stories tall. Current rules require in-depth inspections every four years, with cheaper and much less extensive visual inspections required annually.\n\n\"We recognize it would be expensive, certainly in the thousands of dollars, but one must ask the question what is more important, the expense or the broader implication of an incident,\" Buildings Commissioner Mary Richardson-Lowry said.\n\nOwners of properties that fall under city inspection guidelines must now file annual reports outlining the exterior's condition.\n\nA visual inspection typically includes an examination using binoculars to check for exterior bulges or other irregularities that would indicate underlying problems. Such exams cannot always uncover defects similar to the ones at 1 N. LaSalle St., where eight large chunks of limestone cladding broke away Sunday evening, cascading 36 stories.\n\nThe limestone panels are held in place by steel fasteners, which can be susceptible to corrosion.\n\nKlein and Hoffman Inc., the engineering firm hired by the building's owner to check the high-rise in connection with a multimillion-dollar rehabilitation project, had found corrosion but concluded that it did not present an immediate safety threat, company officials said.\n\n\"If that was their judgment in this case, it worked to the detriment of that building owner and caused a lot of grief,\" Richardson-Lowry said. \"It could have been disastrous to anyone on the street.\"\n\nThe limestone crushed a parked car, but no injuries were reported.\n\nEngineers who conduct the inspections should simply report findings, the commissioner said. She would prefer city experts to do the analysis of the data.\n\n\"I am not interested in supposition,\" she said. \"I need a detailed engineer's report, and we could tell them what the next steps are.\"\n\nRichardson-Lowry huddled Wednesday with Ald. Bernard Stone (50th), chairman of the City Council's Buildings Committee, to discuss an ordinance that would increase the inspection requirement.\n\nWith visual checks, \"an engineer or architect can stand on the ground and look up at a building with binoculars,\" Stone said. \"The problem is you can't see behind the slabs.\" Critical inspections are \"very expensive, especially on high-rise buildings. It requires going up on a scaffold, going floor by floor and checking if any panel is loose.\"\n\nStone said that a revised and strengthened ordinance could be introduced by the next City Council meeting on July 19.\n\nAny new requirement probably would be pegged to the age of the building, though the minimum age that would trigger the stepped-up inspection schedule has not been set, Richardson-Lowry said.\n\nPaul Colgan, director of public affairs for the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, said that his organization is willing to discuss the issue.\n\n\"Our interest is in safe buildings, and we will work with the city on what should be done,\" he said. \"Which buildings they choose [for increased critical inspections] will be important. We have to see the language.\"\n\nColgan said he does not know whether local engineering firms have the manpower to handle inspections every two years.\n\n\"It is a very legitimate question,\" he said. \"I wish I knew the answer to that.\"\n\nThe current inspection ordinance, passed in 1996, has failed to prevent a spate of incidents similar to the one on Sunday.\n\nIn 1998, for example, pieces of terra cotta fell from the exterior of the Majestic Building at 22 W. Monroe St. and from an apartment building at 4607 N. Sheridan Rd. The same year, a block of East Wacker Drive was closed for five weeks after serious problems were found in the terra cotta cladding of the office high-rise at 75 E. Wacker. Last month, workers removed 35 feet from the top of the skyscraper because it was deemed structurally unsound.\n\nOfficials say that the Buildings Department would have to employ a legion of inspectors if the city were to conduct its own inspections of high-rises. They say that the responsibility for ensuring safe exteriors lies with property owners.\n\nAs for the 1 N. LaSalle St. skyscraper, Richardson-Lowry said her department should have been contacted when the corroded fasteners were discovered.\n\nDouglas Elliman-Beitler, the owner, will be charged for all city expenses incurred in dealing with the accident, \"and I think in this instance [the owner] will charge the [inspection firm],\" she said.\n\nKlein and Hoffman conducted inspections in February that found the corrosion. The firm's report was filed with the owner in May, but it was turned over to the city only after Sunday's accident. City legal officials are reviewing the May report, and city inspectors will be looking at the facade up close to determine for themselves what caused the limestone to break off.\n\nJennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city Law Department, said a complaint against the Klein and Hoffman engineers who conducted the inspections could be filed with the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation, which licenses structural engineers.\n\n\"We don't know if anyone has done anything wrong, but it's something we have to look at,\" Hoyle said.\n\nSatish Sachdev, president of Klein and Hoffman, said he is perplexed by why the city would consider filing a complaint. He said his firm has worked diligently in the past two days to compile a report on the building's facade, and he was told the report satisfied officials.\n\n\"We have helped the city on so many projects, and we have tried to protect the public safety,\" Sachdev said. \"At the time of the inspection, there was no imminent danger.\"\n\nKlein and Hoffman, founded in 1953, has been inspecting Chicago buildings for more than 20 years.\n\nMeanwhile, at the site of the accident workers were erecting a sidewalk canopy to protect pedestrians. Earlier, temporary repairs were made to the facade where the limestone slabs separated.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019, Chicago Tribune",
