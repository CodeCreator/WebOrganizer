        "text":"Home \u00bb NEWS \u00bb Economic Development \u00bb More state farmers favoring peanut crops\n\nMore state farmers favoring peanut crops\n\nPeanuts, long associated with the states of Georgia and Virginia, are gaining favor among Mississippi farmers who are adding the nuts in rotation with their more traditional crops.\n\nBack in the 1940s it was common for Mississippi farmers to plant peanuts but they disappeared for the most part until a comeback began in 2005.\n\nDon Self, a cotton farmer in Hamilton, was among the first to plant peanuts in the northeastern part of the state. He credits Dan West for planting the first significant peanut crop in the state. The Self family of farmers followed in 2007. Now Self rotates peanuts with cotton and corn.\n\n\u201cPeanuts revitalized farming for us in our area,\u201d said Self, who is active in peanut business circles. He is Mississippi\u2019s first representative on the National Peanut Board and also is a member of the Mississippi Peanut Growers Association.\n\npeanutsMalcolm Broome is executive director of the state Peanut Growers Association. He is a retired MSU agronomist who worked with Mississippi farmers during his career through the MSU Extension Service.\n\nBroome said that after a drought in Georgia, the largest peanut producer by far, supply and demand kicked in. When the price was high, everybody got in. Mississippi doubled its peanut acres to 50,000 \u201cand everybody else did too.\u201d That\u2019s when the price went down, he said. This year acreage has dropped to 29,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s year to year, like a yo-yo,\u201d Broome said. \u201cIt\u2019s something the industry is working on to try to get leveled out.\u201d\n\nRight now, Mississippi is seventh in the nation in acres of peanuts. The state is ranked first or second in yield per acre, about two tons on average, he said. Success with the crop has added jobs in the Delta, Broome said.\n\nOne economic boost comes from large companies that have bought old facilities including a cotton gin and boat plant for peanut storage. \u201cWe now have four delivery points in Mississippi,\u201d Broome said, \u201cincluding two of the largest peanut warehouses in the nation.\u201d They each can hold 25,000 tons.\n\nBroome said farming peanuts is very labor intensive and expensive to begin with.\n\n\u201cYou need at least 300 acres to make it a profitable venture,\u201d he said. And farming them requires a special combine and other tools that farmers have to invest in. About the only piece of equipment that can be used for peanuts and other crops is a tractor.\n\nOn the up side, Self said peanut consumption is increasing every year. He likes to spread the word about the nutritional benefits of peanuts as a cheap source of protein. \u201cPeople are just finding out that peanuts have 30 essential vitamins and nutrients, no transfat, seven grams of protein per one-ounce serving, that they\u2019re good and good for you.\u201d\n\nOf the four types of peanuts grown in a swath from Virginia, across the South and into the Southwest, 80 percent of the most common runner variety goes into peanut butter and candy bars. The Virginia peanut is the familiar in-the-shell ball park treat, the Valencia peanut is the boiling variety and the red-husked Spanish peanut is served by the bowlful at bars everywhere.\n\nSelf can attest to the nail biting aspect of peanut farming but he said peanuts fit in to Mississippi farming very well. \u201cIt\u2019s a great nitrogen booster for the soil, it prospers well and it\u2019s a great rotation crop.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, the last few years have been a roller coaster with prices going up and down.\n\n\u201cMy daddy (Dennis) is 79 years old. I told him if we can survive this learning curve, it will be good. We got 35 inches of rain in 2009 and he asked me, \u2018How long is that curve supposed to last, son?\u2019 I\u2019m still learning.\u201d\n\n\nAbout Lisa Monti\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
