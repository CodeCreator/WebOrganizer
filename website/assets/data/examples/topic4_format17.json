        "text":"Join the Meeting Place for Moms!\nTalk to other moms, share advice, and have fun!\n\n(minimum 6 characters)\n\nLooking to Work from Home\n\nI currently have a part time job, but am looking to pick up a job that I can do from home. I am not interested in the party world (Avon, Partylite, ect) where you book parties and show off goods. I don't mind the idea of having an actual interview, and having to submit to a background check.\n\nI also don't want anything that has a big start-up cost (say more than $20) and definitely nothing that has a \"monthly fee.\"\n\nIs there anything? I've got a college degree (an associate's degree) and am a year away from my bachelor's degree. I have a TON of sales experience, as well as experience in the customer service field. Is there anything at which this would qualify?\n\nAnswer Question\n\nAsked by OmbreGracieuse at 6:04 AM on Jul. 6, 2009 in Money & Work\n\nLevel 9 (351 Credits)\nAnswers (7)\n  \u2022 You can search for jobs that match your skillset and have a telecommute or remote option. Do you have a former employer you could work for remotely? If you have a computer with high speed internet & Microsoft Office Pro & have at least intermediate MS Office skills, you should be able to find work as a virtual assistant (VA). For more information, go to\n    Do you have a skill or experience that you can turn into a home based business? I have a friend who makes children's hair accessories in her basement & sells them to boutiques around the Midwest. My husband runs a handyman business from our home. I work from home with two lines of business; I do freelance bookkeeping & business organization; I also do career & job search coaching. I am always happy to help cafemoms (and dads) with resumes, cover letters, job search strategy & interview preparation.

NEVER PAY ANY FEES and work when YOU want to.\n\n\n    Answer by SweetKYmom at 8:19 AM on Jul. 6, 2009\n\n  \u2022 If you visit you can go through the list there. Both of the businesses I do have monthly fees, I won't seriously\u00a0work with a company that doesn't. I find them much less reliable and they come with less benefits without a fee...\u00a0 But there are may businesses and home jobs listed on my site that could fit your needs. Good Luck!\n\n\n    Answer by SabrinaMBowen at 9:05 AM on Jul. 6, 2009\n\n  \u2022 Procard is a great work from home career especially if youo have good customer servce and sales skills.\n\n    You can also look at the list in the forum at,its got over 100 companies that hire at home workers like American Airlines, Uhual etc..\n\n\n    Answer by IraqiVetWife at 10:08 AM on Jul. 6, 2009\n\n  \u2022 If interested I also have created a packet of information as far as work at home opportunites I know of everything listed is legit meaning it pays. I have a varriety of methods listed. if interested please email me at\n\n    Answer by ladyluck09 at 11:11 AM on Jul. 6, 2009\n\n  \u2022 I have a blog with a lot of free ideas and some ebooks about starting real businesses creatively. Not google adwordsLOL, but maybe with a hobby you're already doing, a pooperscooper business, a lawncare business, an organizing business, etc. You could find something that really interests you there. I also have free survey companies listed, get paid to write, etc. I update it frequently, so I'd subscribe if you're serious about finding something.\n\n    Answer by tcarter1981 at 1:01 PM on Jul. 6, 2009\n\n  \u2022 Would you like to try a travel buisiness?\n\n    Check this sight out you can earn a lucrative income from the comfort of your own home.\n\n    Answer by Mandy1974 at 7:20 PM on Jul. 6, 2009\n\nJoin CafeMom now to contribute your answer and become part of our community.

        "text":"Member Questions\n\nAsk a question\n\nNow that we have entered an unprecedented global market where India and China are surpassing America in producing engineers and graduates with essential management skills, we find that America, still leaning on a traditional public education curriculum, born of an industrial age and designed to teach kids to be lifetime employees, falls behind. Readers and friends, do you think American public education should be enhanced to include business and entrepreneur lessons at a younger age? If not, how do you think we should raise our children to compete in tomorrow's marketplace? Jennifer \u201d\n\n4 replies so far...\n\n  \u2022 This is a terrific question and discussion.\n    In some ways, I agree with ONEsie, that we can't add any more to the curriculum. If kids really learn the basics, they'll be able to get what they need for themselves as unforseen changes happen in the workplace.\n    On the other hand, our schooling system seems pretty archaic for the world we live in. Perhaps we need to focus on classroom learning and basics for the younger children, but move towards more diverse, technology-aided learning in high school, with more access to higher-level tech, internet classes, world-class science and math teaching. One thing will never change: great teachers have great impact, whether it's in the classroom or via the internet.\n    How to fund our education, regardless of the focus, is another huge problem.\n\n    Flag as inappropriate Posted by Anne Florenzano on 9th February 2008\n\n  \u2022 My thoughts are that we teach children information a mile wide in America and we should follow our Asian counterparts who teach a mile deep. We need to focus on big ideas and concepts but make them relevant and engaging enough that children WANT to learn more about the topic on their own time. Technology will be smarter than we all are by 2020 if we aren't careful. As a former teacher, one thing is for sure... adding more to the curriculum isn't going to solve any problems. We must streamline to what matters and is engaging in a deep and meaningful way.\n\n    Flag as inappropriate Posted by ONEsie on 7th February 2008\n\n  \u2022 My child is in the 3rd grade and he has been learning about trade, economics, supply, demand, exports and imports. I did not learn this kind of information until highschool. I am also an immigrnat from Latin America and would suggest that education is fundemental. However, learning more than one language has keept me and my husband employable. We work in completely different fields. He is an engineer and I am a clinical socialworker. I have traveled a bit in my life and can tell you that in places like China and Europe as well as in Latino America secondary education always includes the mastery of a second language (English being the most likely).\n    In regards to teaching entrepreneurial lessons to children I wiould suggest that the spirit of an entrepreneural cannot be taught, the skills may be aquired but the drive is yours or it is not. I would also suggest that a closer look should be considered for the question of immigrants to this country that often do a lot better with a \"lesser\" education obtained from \"lesser\" universities. Why is this?\n    Ps English is my second language...sorry for the mistakes\n\n    Flag as inappropriate Posted by malena on 7th February 2008\n\n  \u2022 Hi,\n    I'm from India and believe it or not, your question would fit just as well into our socio-political scenario. Sure, we're producing more engineers (that's partly because our population growth shows no signs of slowing down :-P) because we finally have private colleges. But how much of that workforce is \"employable\"? According to a recent estimate, only 25% of engineering graduates and just 10% of other graduates are ready to be absorbed into the workforce. An MBA has become the ultimate middle-class aspiration, but the kind of schools churning out these MBAs is pretty pathetic. No wonder our best and brightest still head for the US to get an advanced degree. As for entrepreneurship, well, I think that holds true for any country. The Great American Dream ought to become \"The Great Dream\" no matter where you live. Not everybody gets to the top of the corporate ladder, so entrepreneurial training is a good thing. Trust me, schools in India hardly offer any kind of vocational training. \"Shop\" classes are unheard of, until after high school. Skill-based professionals (carpenters, plumbers, electricians) are still lowly paid. All that is going to change in the next 10 years, of course. In the meantime, I'm sure America, too, will find it's own way.

What should I do?\n\nTwo months ago I was hired to my dream job (or so I thought), an entry level position at a top advertising firm working with a well known brand. Over the past 3 weeks, I've realized that it is not what I expected it to be. I guess I had been a bit idealistic about the industry and thought that advertising seems interesting and that I would be happy in a cool job. The office is cool, pool table, espresso machines and all that and the people are relatively young and fun loving. But I'm starting to feel like what I do and what the company does is so meaningless. I don't feel like I'm benefiting anyone and contributing to society by helping a big brand promote itself.\n\nI also find that my personality (INFJ in Myers-Briggs) doesn't fit the company culture at all. I understand very well the type of working environment that is truly suitable for me (independent work, project based, something with results and meanings) but I was naive to believe that a cool job would make me happy. The nature of the work is also too fast and glamorous. Free shows tickets, invitation to big name parties, free dinners and all. I'm just not that kind of person.\n\nNow I feel miserable at work and is becoming bitter and unmotivated. All this stress is making me depressed and its affecting my personal life because I'm behind at work due to my lack of motivation and I can't seem to forget about it when I get home. What should I do?\nposted by willy_dilly to Work & Money (21 answers total) 10 users marked this as a favorite\nFigure out what job would better suit you\nlook for it\napply for it\ntake it.\nposted by magikker at 8:37 PM on February 26, 2007 [1 favorite]\n\nIs this your first job out of school?

You seem to know what kind of job would suit you better. When they ask why you left\/are leaving your previous job, you can say you want to feel like you're making a difference or that you're looking for work that's more independent and project-based or that the environment just wasn't a good fit or some combination. That won't sound like you're trashing your current job.\nposted by sleeplessunderwater at 8:56 PM on February 26, 2007\n\nyou didn't write anything as to the department you are working in and I am not quite sure whether you are within the united states or in a different place (the cultures in our industry vary widely) but from your statement that you work on one account, I will assume you're an account services person and not part of the creative department.\n\nfirst off: please don't be insulted by this but as a entry-level employee working on a large account, you're not going to get to do a lot of important things anyway. that's just too much of a risk. this is the time to make contacts, observe how things are done, be noticed for potential. you are not being hired because you are a brilliant leader this very moment. you are being hired as, again my apologies, cheap labor with a certain promise.\n\nit might be a bit too early to be depressed about this. three weeks is nothing. consider six months to a year an adequate time to see whether this is your thing or not. there is a vast array of different personality types in this industry. my former writer\/partner was a jet engine mechanic for close to ten years before she decided to pursue this. I know a former stripper-turned-brand manager. chat up the planners, they are usually the most fascinating non-creatives.\n\nlook at it this way: you are in an enviroment where you get to explore a lot of terribly interesting things. try to go along for a film shoot and post production. if you play your cards right, you could end up with some pretty great stories and have a damn great time. (hint: creatives have the most fun.)\n\nas far as the hours are concerned: bad news. you will have constant stress. this is not a 9-5 industry. I logged 90 hours last week and that's not my record. strange thing is: the more senior you get and the less you are under the gun, the more you force yourself to do it. the paychecks tend to become pretty impressive relatively quickly, perhaps that has something to do with it.\n\nlife in itself, both professionally and individually, has no purpose. you have to give it that. if you think you're unable to do that in this industry, then find a different one.\n\nbut give it six months to a year.\nposted by krautland at 9:08 PM on February 26, 2007 [2 favorites]\n\nUm, what krautland said.\n\nAlso, if you're done with it, may I have your job please?\nposted by dirtynumbangelboy at 9:29 PM on February 26, 2007\n\nThis is a really common thing for new grads in entry-level jobs. And it's possible that the job and industry don't suit you.\n\nBut don't quit. Start on a plan for your next job. I recommend an exit strategy that allows you to accumulate a year of experience in this current job. Figure out what you want from your next job. Then figure out what you need to get it. If you have any time available, join a professional association, take a course, read books, work on a portfolio..whatever you need.\n\nIt sounds like you might be happier as a marcom writer, market researcher, marcom project manager, marketing assistant, direct mail assistant or something like that. You wouldn't need to do all the wining and dining. And you could have small, tangible projects like brochures, ads, research reports, whitepapers, direct mail campaigns, etc.\n\nAs for the world of marketing and advertising, maybe you'd be happier helping smaller companies. And perhaps you would be better suited to something like B2B marketing, where you're not dealing with influencing consumers. I personally see my work as a marketing consultant as a means of helping develop a knowledge-based economy, grow job opps in my community, and reduce reliance on the environment.\n\nI wasn't cut out for agency work, so I didn't apply. But I did follow my heart into the world of marketing.\nposted by acoutu at 9:51 PM on February 26, 2007\n\nAs a side note, a book that helped me a lot is called \"Do What You Are\", by Paul D. Tieger & Barbara Barron-Tieger. (My copy is from 1992 but check Amazon or Powells for current editions.) It uses Meyer-Briggs personality typing to help you identify those careers that you might be best suited to. It was dead on in its assessment of me as INTP and helped me focus my efforts in the right direction. Many similar books exist - check the Careers section of any well-stocked bookstore or library - but this one worked well for me.\n\nAlso, as krautland says, give it time. After three weeks at my current job, I was spending every lunch hour on the phone with headhunters and placement agencies, convinced I was in the wrong place and scrambling to get out. I decided to give it six months though and I'm glad I did - it improved after about three months, and now that I'm almost a year in, I've had a chance to handle some interesting projects, become somewhat of an expert in my own little niche, and I'm in line for a great promotion. If you get six months in and you feel the same way (or even three months, and you're pretty sure about it), then you can move on knowing that you gave it a fair try, at least.\nposted by herichon at 10:09 PM on February 26, 2007\n\nIt's easier to find a job when you have a job. Also, once you've decided to look for something else and start treating your job as a job and not a calling, sometimes a weird thing happens and you find happiness in your job. Sometimes a path opens up that you didn't know about [you meet someone who works in a different department and you realize this new department would fit you]. Sometimes you start finding satisfaction in different places.\n\nYour life is now, so I'm not going to tell you that you have to stay for a year. But whatever amount of time you plan to spend there, really figure out ways to make your job help get you to the next level. Talk to anyone who seems interesting. Attend some of those lame events because people at those lame events can help you get another job.\n\nIf this is your first real job, part of what you may be reacting to is having your day go from being devoted to a range of things, to being devoted to one thing. To combat this, make an effort to insert variety into your life-- join a book club, take a class at the local community college. I suggest this as a general tactic to combat depression, YMMV.\n\nI assume there are jobs like yours where the client is a nonprofit. Maybe see if you can find someone who knows someone who works at that agency. Sometimes it's not about the work you are doing, but on who's behalf you are doing the work.\n\nYour work needs to not suck, and you need to not work for a crazy person. But your work doesn't have to take you all the way through the hierarchy of needs. There are other hours in the day for that. Don't get me wrong, there are clients I won't work for and events I walked away from because I didn't believe in what people were doing. But if I'm not 100% amped about it, that's par for the course.\nposted by Mozzie at 12:26 AM on February 27, 2007\n\nYou could be a lot worse off. Stick with it and try to utilize your strengths to their full potential. You like working on projects with meaningful results? Find a project at work or at home that does interest you and work on that. I'm sure there are plenty of people who want those tickets and parties, let them handle it and you can earn yourself a reputation as the hardworker who does his own thing.\n\nAs others have said, give the job some time and do your best to deal with the parts you don't like. Many people take jobs they aren't crazy about, but if you do your best at this one and start planning for the next one instead of making ... (truncated)",

After that, she asked me to give her the phone number through which I contacted them (which is the hostel's number). But the next question she asked baffles me. She asked, \"Under what name?\"\n\nI wasn't sure if she was asking what my name is or the name of the hostel?\nTherefore, I asked her what that means, but she refuses to clarify.\nAfterwards, I gave her the name of the hostel , but she sighed and hung up on me.\n\nOf course, a taxi was not sent to my place. So, what does she mean by \"under what name\" ?\n\n\nSince you gave the telephone number of the hostel (a hotel-type of accomodation, with multiple guests), she needed to know the name of the guest the taxi driver should ask for.\n\n\"Under what name\" is the usual way to ask how the hostel\/hotel knows you - what name did you give to the hostel management. (Don't get stuck on the word \"under\" - you can substitute the word \"as\" for \"under\" - for example, \"What name did you register as \" -- or, as she said it, \"As what name did you register?\")\n\nIn the past, it sometimes happened that people would register with a hotel\/hostel under made-up names, like Smith or Jones, if they did not wish to give their real names. This is still very common with celebrities - for example, Johnny Depp famously uses \"Mr Stench\", and Ozzy Osbourne is reputed to use the name \"Harry Bollocks\".\n\nBut the question \"under what name\" is a common question that someone would ask in order to find out how you are known to the hotelier where you are staying.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 1\n    To add to this, I think this phrasing is short for \u201cwhat name are you filed under\u201d or similar.

A restaurant operation is similar to any other business, but requires sound skill sets in financial planning; cost control; sales\/marketing; profit and loss management. General business classes might not seem \"relevent\" at this junction of your education, but will be as you progress in the industry. Get a solid general business background, coupled with practical hands on experience, I emphasize the later, because the restaurant business on the \"outside' may seem appealing evern glamours.

It is a very fast paced 24\/7 type of industry which some adapt well to and others not. 9 out 10 restaurants fail.

Despite the potential distractions, children need them to call home for rides, be notified of family emergencies, or even call the police (think Columbine!) . They use them for research and they should be able to use them to call friends and play games at lunch or during breaks. If they goof off during class that's their choice (as long as they're not disrupting class) and they'll pay the price. But they need to be experts at using them from an early age to succeed both socially and academically today.\nWritten by a contributor\nIt's unacceptable to say that if the kids goof off that's their choice and they will pay the price. They don't know what it means to have no education when they become adults. Young kids are always complaining about learning proper grammar or ancient history or geometry. They always say \"Why do I have to know what a preposition is? I'm never going to use that when I become a computer game programmer.\" Kids can be taught how to use cell phones and computers in a proper classroom setting, but they shouldn't be doing their cell phone homework while English is being taught. Society will wind up with smart phones and dumb children.\n1 No Take\nWrite Your No Take\n0 like 0 dislike\nNo. In the old days one form of classroom disruption was when boys and girls passed notes to one another. Now with cell phones they just text one another and the teacher can't spot it. Same problem made even worse by modern technology. Cell phones are too much of a distraction especially with the smart phones we have now. Access to internet games provides too much opportunity and temptation for kids to ignore their lessons. They can play on their phones after school, but during class, their attention should be on the teacher only.\nI wonder if it's feasible at all to suppress cell signals in the classrooms so they can't make\/receive calls or play internet games in the classroom?\n\nRelated Write Fights\n\n2 takes\nAsked in Education by WriteChick\nSchools have found twins get better grades when they're in the same cl\u2026\n2 takes\nAsked in Education by Pzombie\nWe don't want our children getting their day started with foods that a\u2026\n2 takes\nAsked in Education by a contributor\nYou can put them in separate classes but not separate schools.

And work with you.\n\nIn order to test this principle, simply watch the first films of the most \"successful\" directors and count how many celebrities you can spot:\n\n\nYou can also read the words of the filmmakers themselves, some of whom I've already quoted here:\n\n\nAnd since I know you respect James Cameron, let's look at what he says:\n\nA lot of people ask me, you know, \"What's the best advice to someone who wants to be a director?\" And the answer I give is very simple. \"Be a director.\" Pick up a camera. Shoot something. No matter how small, no matter how cheesy, no matter whether your friends and your sister star in it. Put your name on it as director. Now you're a director. Everything after that you're just negotiating your budget and your fee. So it's a state of mind is really the point, once you commit yourself to do it.\n\nalt text\n\nThe video of this entire interview, along with a lot of other great material, is at http:\/\/www.achievement.org\/autodoc\/page\/cam0int-3\n\nYou can modify your limiting beliefs regarding what you think or feel \"is necessary to succeed\" by using a variety of methods; this one has been my personal favorite.\n\nI would suggest one more thing. Stingray has previously suggested cultivating a feeling of \"invincibility\" in life. With regard to a career in the film industry, I would advise cultivating a feeling of \"unstoppability.\" If you read about the careers of the various great filmmakers, you will find that they all seem to follow this paradigm. No matter what happened, they just could not be stopped. For instance, Steven Spielberg was rejected from the same film school (USC) three times. Nevertheless, he continued to follow his desire, and ended up sneaking onto a Hollywood backlot where he masqueraded as an employee and set up his own fake office, eventually landing his first director's gig. If you survey the early careers of other great filmmakers, you will find that the stories (and tactics) are all different, but the mentality is the same.\n\nSo keep going with this law-of-attraction stuff. Use the manifesting processes on this site. Neutralize any limiting beliefs you might have. And become unstoppable.\n\nalt text\n\n\nanswered 24 Apr '14, 20:24\n\nlozenge123's gravatar image\n\n\nedited 24 Apr '14, 23:17\n\nSure.

        "text":"I\u2019m currently working as a project manager in local government but feel it is time to move on and improve my salary. I have considered the private sector, especially finance where the salaries seem good, and also contract working, but I\u2019m not sure of the stability. What are my best options?\n\nPanellist biographies\n\nSimon Buehring is a project manager, consultant and PRINCE2 trainer. He is the founder of KnowledgeTrain, which offers PRINCE2 project management training in the UK and overseas. Simon has extensive project management experience within the IT industry in the UK and Asia and has worked in the financial, transport, health and education sectors.\n\nDenise Plumpton joined the Highways Agency in January 2005 as director of information and a member of the executive board of the agency. Denise has a particular interest in helping organisations through periods of change and is on the strategy board of the Corporate IT Forum.\n\nSteve Moran heads up QA-IQ\u2019s Project and Programme Management Practice, with responsibility for managing and developing QA-IQ\u2019s Project and Programme Management business. Steve has been a project and programme manager for over 25 years with positions across manufacturing, financial, services, utilities and airline sectors. In addition he has built highly successful professional services practices for global companies including Deloitte Consulting and Atos Origin.\n\nSimon Buehring, founder of KnowedgeTrain, says:\n\nWell, to consider a move to the finance industry in the light of the recent credit crunch and redundancies at investment banks hit by bad debts might sound rather rash.\n\nHowever, city firms do pay very well for staff with highly marketable skills and IT project managers with solid experience from other areas are always in demand.\n\nMost firms will look for people with sound business experience, however where the candidate\u2019s technical experience stands out, exceptions will always be made.\n\nRegarding contracting, I would say it is probably easier to find full time project management roles in finance rather than contract roles. That\u2019s because the best paying contract roles are filled by highly technically experienced people who can also bring sound business knowledge and skills.\n\nI would suggest your best option would be to seek a full time city role where you can gain some business experience and knowledge and perhaps look for contract roles in the future once you have some business experience as well.\n\nDenise Plumpton, director of information, Highways Agency, says\n\nThe focus of the question seems to be on salary here but I\u2019d suggest you look at the bigger picture. Contract work often seems to command higher rates of pay than permanent employment, but that\u2019s in part because it is purely temporary and doesn\u2019t come with the benefits of being an employee. When you consider that contractors don\u2019t get paid for holiday or being ill, have to make their own provisions for pensions and the like and run the risk of the time between contracts, you start to see why the rates look attractive.\n\nSalaries in the private sector are very variable and, typically, will reflect a range of factors including the scope and responsibility which comes with the role, plus the size of company, and hence the budget or size of project you\u2019d be expected to manage.\n\nLocal government and central government organisations have the value-add of a strong focus on personal development and other non-salary benefits. So it\u2019s worth bearing these in mind when you evaluate opportunities.\n\nWork out what your priorities are at the moment and by all means have a look outside of local government. But try to look beyond the salary and see whether the nature of the role matches your longer term ambitions and likely job satisfaction.\n\nSteve Moran, head of practice for project and programme management, QA-IQ, says\n\nThere are many attractive skills for a company looking to recruit a project manager with local government experience, including dealing with large capital projects, managing expectations of diverse stakeholders, and experience of detailed auditing and reporting.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s sometimes a concern that the knowledge base, standards, and perhaps terminology will be different between the public and private sectors. The first step you need to take is to make sure you\u2019re qualified to the standards expected by industry, in particular PRINCE2 and APMP certification are often essential in the financial sector.\n\nCompanies will also expect a project manager to have financial and commercial awareness, so take the opportunity to make sure you\u2019re up-to-date with current practices and spend some time researching different business structures. If you\u2019re a member of an industry body, take the opportunity to network with project managers who are already working in the financial sector and benefit from their advice and experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re armed with the right knowledge and skills you are far more likely to run successful projects, and there can be no greater guarantee of security than that.",
