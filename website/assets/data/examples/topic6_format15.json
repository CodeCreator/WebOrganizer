        "text":"Thank you Blackheart!\n\nBlackheart made a welcome return to Cilcain Village Hall\u00a0on Saturday 7th September 2013, the third port of call on their biggest UK tour to date.\n\nTo a packed Hall they played previously performed songs as well as previewing some numbers from their forthcoming CD, \u2018Songs from a Satellite\u2019.\u00a0 Very early on in the set was the catchy and bittersweet \u201cWednesday Afternoon\u201d (which I still can\u2019t stop singing!), followed by other beautifully observed and crafted songs, which in turn had you either jigging for joy or weeping into your wine!\n\nTheir music features keyboards and acoustic guitars and Chrissy\u2019s gorgeous vocals, at times upbeat and energetic, at others world-weary and fragile, whilst Richard\u2019s lovely, warm and assured vocal tones underpin and bind everything together to great effect; their voices really are a wonderful blend.\n\nRichard also coaxed some truly evocative sounds from his guitar with the use of a violin bow, occasionally grungy and gritty, yet in the next move making it sound almost like a double bass, mellow and measured.\u00a0 The mesmeric \u2018song without words\u2019, \u201cHey Pluto,\u201d even intriguingly featured an empty plastic drinking bottle, used to great effect \u2013 sounds weird, but it worked!\u00a0 Check it out on the new CD, released 28th October;\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Sky and I\u201d will be the first single release.\n\nDuring the set, Chrissy and Richard went on to play the haunting \u201cEndymion\u201d, a song based on a story from Greek mythology, revealing that they were inspired to write this after their previous gig in Cilcain, in October of last year.\u00a0 It was written in the Village Hall at the ungodly hour of 5.00 am, a time when most of us would struggle to produce anything more creative than a cup of tea!\n\nBlackheart finished their set with an encore, performing the heart lifting and joyous \u201cEverything You Are\u201d, which will be the second single from \u2018Songs from a Satellite\u2019.\u00a0 This is an unforgettable tune, which sees Richard delivering a deep, gutsy and hypnotic sound using the now familiar and well-used, tattered bow \u2013 fantastic!\n\nSo thank you for dropping by again, Blackheart, we look forward to welcoming you back soon, and we wish you the very best of luck with the rest of your tour!\n\nPS Blackheart asked me to thank you all for coming along to see them and said that they really enjoyed themselves, too!\n\n\nAbout cilcainvillagehall\n\nThis website is designed to offer access and information to users of Cilcain Village Hall.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

        "text":"Where Bonnaroo is Going, Whether You Like it or\u00a0Not\n\nWhere Bonaroo is going, whether you like it or not!\n\nIn 2016, Bonnaroo found itself with a massive disaster on its hands. LCD Soundsystem, Pearl Jam and Dead and Company sounded like a really cool lineup to me, a then 33-year-old white guy, but as I came to discover at the same time as the festival, it didn\u2019t sound cool to literally any other demographic. Around 40,000 people showed up to the festival accustomed to hosting around 80,000.\n\nLast year, they began a reinvention of sorts. The Weeknd closed the weekend; the first real Top 40 pop act to do such a thing. And this year, the festival continued moving in that direction. But this year, the festival seemingly scrapped a lot of the budget it would have typically used in the middle of the poster for experiences while keeping\u00a0just enough\u00a0acts that 35-year-old white guys like on the bill so they could sell $7 beers.\n\nHere\u2019s a thing I grasped last week: people between 18-25 don\u2019t care about the music. They care about the experience. Or more specifically, sharing the experience. They care about having cool stuff to post on Instagram or Snapchat. And there\u2019s not one thing in the world wrong with it, despite what old 35-year-old curmudgeons say. That\u2019s the world they\u2019ve known their entire lives, and that\u2019s fun. But how do you combat that when you\u2019re bleeding money and folks are actually asking if your festival can survive?\n\nYou pour money into the campgrounds, which is where young people have their experiences at Bonnaroo. It\u2019s the largest camping music festival in America \u2013 maybe the world. In its entire 17 years \u2013 before the need to share was so deeply ingrained into our society \u2013 there have always been folks that never leave that campground. They just want to sit out there and do drugs and hang out with their friends. And the festival figured out how to solve the problem: go to them.\n\nThere are certainly still folks like myself that go to see live music. And the festival found a way to balance that: quality over quantity.\n\nOr then, maybe they saved so much money by booking Muse they just blew it on experimentation. It seemed to work on the bottom line.\n\nHere are the top ten things I saw at Bonnaroo 2018.\n\n10. Muse \u2013\u00a0Muse is fine. Muse can write incredibly memorable guitar riffs, but they have no memorable songs. Muse has like six songs that you once heard in a video game or on the \u201cQueen + Radiohead\u201d Pandora station that you created.\n\nBut you\u00a0do\u00a0remember those guitar riffs. And you kinda hum your way through the rest of it and it\u2019s a fun time. It\u2019s a better time than you think it\u2019s going to be because you had extremely low expectations. Like imagine if a guy that wanted to be Bono that kind of sounds like Thom Yorke was fronting a band that wanted to be Queen. That\u2019s Muse.\n\n9. Broken Social Scene \u2013\u00a0Broken Social Scene is lesser Arcade Fire. But I\u2019ve always dug them and I\u2019ve never seen them and this was a lot of fun. I probably should have placed Mavis Staples right here, but I saw her do one of the most amazing sets I ever saw at Hangout several years back and this one was on the worst stage in all of music \u2013 the Which Stage \u2013 and it was hot. So Broken Social Scene gets the square.\n\n8. St. Paul and the Broken Bones \u2013\u00a0Or maybe it\u2019s here where Mavis belongs; I only actually saw about 20 minutes of this set, but in that 20 minutes, Paul Janeway sprawled a carpet over the top of the audience and took a literal \u201cMagic Carpet Ride\u201d out to the soundboard, all the while singing \u201cBroken Bones and Pocket Change\u201d \u2013 then, he crowd surfed his way back to the stage \u2013 and never stopped singing. And it\u2019s like, sure, I\u2019ve see a lot of St. Paul and the Broken Bones shows before. But I\u2019ve absolutely never seen that.\n\n7. Dua Lipa \u2013\u00a0There was a very specific moment in this performance that I felt the course of this festival change from deep within my bones.\n\nDua Lipa performed her track \u201cScared to Be Lonely,\u201d a track that she did the hook on for Martin Garrix. The way the song is structured is not unlike a lot of EDM these days, certainly Martin Garrix\u2019s other work \u2013 the vocals almost serve as a bridge to the \u201chook\u201d which is instrumental. And when her \u201cbridge\u201d dropped into his \u201chook,\u201d in an instant, Bonnaroo felt like Coachella. And that\u2019s where it\u2019s going.\n\nBonnaroo and Coachella no longer have to be two completely different experiences because kids are separated from kids on the other side of the country the way there were 15 years ago. They are all on the internet and they all enjoy the same things and the same experiences.\n\nThe Dua Lipa performance \u2013 for me \u2013 was the moment that long, slow transition to Coachella became crystal clear. The festival built on wooks and Spreadnecks being able to come together over a shared love of Panic has crossed over into a pop festival that doesn\u2019t have a curfew.\n\n6. Sturgill Simpson \u2013\u00a0The best jam band at the festival built on jam bands was Sturgill Simpson. The last time I saw Sturgill tour, it was with a much larger band; I think there was a full horn section. This time out, it was a four piece. It really allowed Sturgill a chance to remind everyone that he absolutely wails on guitar. I think I\u2019d forgotten that. And it was further evidence that Sturgill isn\u2019t what a lot of the people that think they are his biggest fans want him to be and that he absolutely doesn\u2019t care that he isn\u2019t.\n\nThere have been times that it seemed like schtick; busking on Broadway and streaming it on Facebook Live, for instance. But at the core of what Sturgill has always done is that he\u2019s done it the way he wants to do it and he\u2019s an incredibly gifted musician. That shone through much brighter with a smaller band in front of a massive audience.\n\n5. Chic \u2013\u00a0Well, Chic with Nile Rodgers or whatever they\u2019re calling it now. The entire band did a good half hour in the middle of the set of songs that Nile Rodgers wrote for other bands, including \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d and \u201cWe Are Family.\u201d\n\n4. Grand Ole Opry \u2013\u00a0The Grand Ole Opry has been on the air for 92 years. My grandparents loved it \u2013 it was probably the only music they really listened to then. So it was cool to be a part of this first union of the thing that made them love music and one of the things that I\u2019ve loved most about music for the past decade. It was also a brilliant idea; what usually serves as commercial time for announcer Bill Cody, instead served as an advertisement for the storied institution. It was a way to show a young audience that this really cool thing still exists. And bringing people like Bobby Bare and Del McCoury to the same stage as Nikki Lane and Joshua Hedley furthered that mission.\n\n3. Eminem \u2013\u00a0This performance has been grossly overshadowed by what people were calling \u201cgunshot sounds\u201d that were heard during the performance. Eminem\u2019s publicist released a statement saying that the sounds were actually \u201cpyrotechnic concussion\u201d sounds. And I totally buy that. The only thing about the sound that was alarming was its volume. It was five times louder than the fireworks were that night. No gunshot is that loud. It could (and probably should) have been left out because that reaction should have been expected. But a much bigger deal is being made of it than should be.\n\nWhat we\u00a0should\u00a0be focusing on in this performance is the way that a specifically 1999 performer managed to gracefully and artfully mature without pretending that the version of himself that made him a household name never existed.\n\nHe performed his latest single, \u201cNowhere Fast,\u201d which has recently been updated to include lyrics about Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It waxes poetic on \u2013 get this \u2013 gun control. Yeah, the guy that wrote \u201cKill You\u201d no longer likes violence or wants to stick nine inch nails through each one of his eyelids. It also includes these lyrics:\n\nBut I\u2019m devising this rhyme, cause I\u2019m awake in your mourning;\n\nThat\u2019s why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me;\n\nGusto guts bravado, nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot;\n\nI must\u2019ve got you in somewhat of a debacle;\n\nPlus some stuff that\u2019s awful;\n\nReally don\u2019t mean nothing, although;\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of shit I said in jest that\u2019s tough to swallow;\n\nBut if at times, my heart it seems;\n\nLike it\u2019s the wrong place, it\u2019s because it\u2019s on my sleeve;\n\nKeanu Reeves, speed of light avoid it, veer or just steer towards it;\n\nWe\u2019re only looking forward, but where we\u2019re going, we have no idea\n\nShortly after that performance, the other rapper on stage went into some typical festival diatribe, \u201cHow many of y\u2019all are getting [expletive] up tonight?\u201d\n\nAnd Eminem replied, \u201cMan we used to get [expletive] up! Here are some of those songs we sang when we used to get [expletive] up.\u201d\n\nThe two then did a minute of the three Slim Shady songs each. And encored with \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d I imagine figuring out a way to evolve into 2018 is incredibly difficult for someone that\u2019s success came between 1998-2001. It\u2019s an entirely different world. When we were leaving, a 17-year-old kid was talking about how awesome the show was and he says, \u201cMan, I know all of those lyrics.\u201d\n\nTo which my friend replied, \u201cBut, like, you have no idea who Tom Green is or why that was funny to us, right? Like, let me tell you about Tom Green. We thought he was HI-LARIOUS.\u201d\n\nAnd the kid says, \u201cNo. No idea. But that must have been amazing to hear all of that for the first time when it came out.\u201d\n\nIt was. And in 2008, \u201cLove the Way You Lie\u201d was released \u2013 Eminem\u2019s first reinvention \u2013 at the exact moment I needed it in my own life. There\u2019s a cynical side of me that thinks, \u201cHow thin is the line between Eminem being Everlast?\u201d But then there\u2019s the reality than Eminem struggled with an abusive relationship and addiction, he used his art to express all of those emotions \u2013 however gritty, raw and dated a lot of it is now \u2013 and he\u2019s still reinventing himself 20 years later.\n\nI hope it\u2019s the beginning of a next act.\n\n2.

        "text":"A couple of weeks ago, Nickelodeon announced that it's going to start airing \"classic\" episodes of its teen shows from the 1990's. This is based on overwhelming Facebook demand from nostalgic millennials. Starting on July 25, between the hours of midnight and 4 am, insomniacs in my generation will be treated to a bloc of programming including Keenan & Kel, All That, Clarissa Explains it All, and Doug. Everyone's totally excited. Democracy! Will of the people! Memories so think you'll have to brush them away from your faces!\n\nPopular demand will continue to drive the bloc's schedule. Reports the New York Times,\n\nThe channel says that Facebook feedback will influence which other shows it rotates into the block. Research has convinced Nickelodeon executives that the Web - a repository of cherished childhood memories - \"is allowing young people to be nostalgic, probably sooner than other generations,\" said Cyma Zarghami, the channel's president.\n\nAs I was born in the early 80's, one would think that I'd be in the sweet spot for this stunt, that nostalgia would pull me to my TV and compel me to watch along with my brethren. My generational narcissism and love of democracy would compel me to adamantly voice my opinion about what shows should air, and voice them just about as hard as I possibly could. The reality is that I missed this aspect of pop culture, I feel nothing about All That, and what I know of Keenan & Kel confuses and upsets me.\n\nI was what you might call a pop culture pariah when I was a kid. I grew up in a rural remote area, far enough out of the nearest small enough town that cable TV wasn't an option for us, and my parents sure as hell weren't going to shell out for a giant satellite dish, as my dad was known to instruct my siblings and I to go outside and run around in order to \"get the stink off.\" (To this day, I'm not sure what that means.) We watched PBS (Wild America with Marty Stouffer was my jam, and Square 1 made me briefly want to be a mathematician when I grew up, because I thought mathematicians solved mysteries) and read the encyclopedia and did other rural nerd things. We gardened and chopped wood and identified songbirds and made maple candy like Laura Ingalls Wilder and lived a life blissfully unaware of what was going on in the world of cable television. My relative country bumpkin innocence and lack of exposure to pop culture continued until I was almost in eighth grade, when I went to student council camp and made a bunch of kids laugh when I asked who was singing the song that had just started playing on the radio. It was \"Spiderwebs\" by No Doubt, and they thought I was being sarcastic.\n\nWhile I don't begrudge any of you suburban (or non-rural remote) kids who grew up with Nickelodeon, I won't be pumping my fists joyfully skyward at the Doug theme song. I'll be sullenly looking for the theme song from 3-2-1 Contact on youtube. I'll indulge my television nostalgia when there's a late night Ghostwriter bloc.\n\nThe Good Ol' Days of 20 Years Ago [NYT]",

Of course, we still have the new year to celebrate next week, and the music of the season will continue to be played in stores and shopping malls for some time now, whether you like it or not.\n\nBut for me, \"Deck the Halls\" in particular makes me think of a newspaper comic strip I read as a kid, Walt Kelly's Pogo, which was known for its brilliant and incisive humor, satire, and cultural commentary. Probably the best known quote from Pogo is, \"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\"\n\nBut this time of year, I can't help but think of Kelly's awesome parody of the traditional carol, \"Deck the Halls,\" which I first encountered on the comics page of the long defunct Long Island Press, the local newspaper for residents of Queens back in the day. I don't recall the exact context, but it might have been a strip like this one:\n\nOr here's another from the Sunday funnies:\n\nAnd there's more to the song than these few lines:\n\nHere's what I believe is the complete version:\n\nBut carols are meant to be heard, not just seen, so here's one amateur rendering:\n\nAnd here's a solo rendition:\n\nAnd this is a very nice chorus, complete with visuals courtesy of Danny the miniature horse:\n\nThis one is less notable for the singing than for the backdrop featuring the comic strip at Fantagraphics Bookstore and Gallery in Seattle:\n\nFinally, there's a jazz version by Lambert, Hendricks, & Ross that starts with a formal choral rendition and goes off into some scat singing. Here's a video that couples the music with more of Walt Kelly's imagery:\n\nSo, there you have it:\n\nNow that sure is some joyful noise, wouldn't you say?\n\nNo comments:",

I started watching\u00a0Buffy in its third season, after my sister convinced me to watch some of the season two episodes she had on tape over the summer. It became my favourite show, which it remains to this day. Although Buffy definitely has its flaws (most of them in season seven), I still haven\u2019t found a show that can top it in its best moments. I love the show\u2019s combination of serious drama and silly comedy, its large family of complex characters, many of whom have very interesting story arcs, and of course that excellent Joss Whedon dialogue.\n\nTo celebrate the anniversary of the end of\u00a0Buffy, I\u2019ve put together a quick list of five of my favourite Buffy moments. This is a bit of a random list: I wanted to stay away from the obvious, so I\u2019ve tried avoid all the major events from season finales and that kind of thing.\u00a0One of the great things about Buffy, after all, is that it did little moments just as well as it did big ones. The whole \u201chigh school is hell\u201d premise of the show is based on the idea that the ordinary things in life can have massive significance. Although some of my choices come from important episodes or are big events in the context of the show, they all stand out to me for packing a big punch on a relatively smaller scale.\n\nXander and Tara in The Body.\n\n\u201cIt hurts.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe Body\u201d is an episode that\u2019s explicitly built on small moments, and this is a very small scene I find particularly striking. After Xander pulls his hand out of the wall he\u2019s punched, Tara looks at him and simply says, \u201cIt hurts.\u201d Just stating the obvious. But coming from Tara, perhaps the most open and kind soul on the show, it means a lot more. The way Xander looks at her after she says it, it\u2019s like he\u2019s seeing her for the first time. Xander and Tara\u2019s relationship is not one the show spends much time exploring; by comparison, Willow and Anya\u2019s somewhat rocky relationship is far more developed. In this moment, though, we know he gets her.\n\nJonathan presents Buffy with the Class Protector Award at the prom.\n\nBuffy Gets One Perfect High School Moment. Buffy is both an ordinary teenaged girl and a heroine with a grand destiny; generally, much to her dismay, the heroine part gets in the way of the other stuff. By the time graduation rolls around, Buffy has pretty much given up\u00a0on ever fitting in at Sunnydale High or making her mark on the school in traditional ways like being Homecoming Queen or even having her picture in the yearbook. In \u201cThe Prom,\u201d she must save the prom from a demon attack \u2014 once again giving up her own shot at an ordinary high school experience in order to preserve it for everyone else. (\u201cNo! You guys are going to have a prom. The kind of prom that everyone should have. I\u2019m going to give you all a nice, fun, normal evening if I have to kill every single person on the face of the earth to do it.\u201d) Much to her surprise, though, it turns out Buffy\u2019s classmates have in fact noticed her: after a spontaneous write-in campaign, the class of 99 presents her with the Class Protector Award in recognition of her heroism. It\u2019s a lovely gesture by the students and it makes me cry every time I watch the episode.\n\nGiles in Dead Man's Party.\n\n\u201cWelcome home, Buffy.\u201d When Buffy returns to Sunnydale in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Party\u201d after her lost summer, everyone is really, really mean to her over the fact that she disappeared for months and didn\u2019t tell them where she went. Everyone, that is, except Giles, who is just very relieved and happy to have her back safely. In public, he\u2019s calm and unemotional. In private, he takes a moment to let himself smile. I love how much Giles cares for Buffy \u2014 he is the only person who both fully understands her and loves her unconditionally \u2014 and this is a very sweet demonstration of it.\n\nBuffy and Spike in Fool for Love.\n\n\u201cIs there something I can do?\u201d In the end I suppose Spike comes close to matching Giles\u2019 love for Buffy (although in a very different way). This scene from the end of \u201cFool for Love,\u201d in which Spike sits quietly with Buffy while she allows herself a private moment of weakness over her mother\u2019s illness, speaks volumes about their relationship. For one thing, they\u2019ve spent the whole episode fighting and he stopped by with the intention of killing her. This is also a preview of season six, where Spike becomes Buffy\u2019s go-to non-person for escape from a harsh reality. Spike\u2019s desire to be worthy in Buffy\u2019s eyes ultimately leads to a very grand gesture, but it all starts with a bit of silent, friendly comfort.\n\nBuffy in The I in Team.\n\nBuffy Takes The Initiative. This one isn\u2019t as emotional as all my other picks. In this scene from \u201cThe I in Team,\u201d Buffy attends a briefing at the headquarters of The Initiative. I\u2019ve always found this scene hilarious just because of the image of Buffy in her orange halter top standing with all those commando guys. Aside from being funny, though, it also provides a nice visual summary of the entire conflict of season four, with Buffy\u2019s feminine, mystical, \u201cunpredictable\u201d energy noticeably disrupting the male, technological, structured Initiative way of doing things. Buffy\u2019s insistence on asking questions gets laughs from the soldiers at this point, but it\u2019s her undoing with Professor Walsh later in this very episode. Season four is Buffy\u2018s most underrated year, in my opinion: The Initiative storyline, which is extremely well-developed over the season, explores some very interesting issues and this is a key scene from a key episode.\n\nWhat are your favourite smaller Buffy moments?",

        "text":"Watching Way Too Much TV For You!\n\nPosts tagged \u2018Nikita\u2019\n\nFall TV 2010: My Review of CW\u2019s\u00a0Nikita\n\nWith the new fall season starting, new TV is bring us the good, the bad, and the mediocre, but how do you sort out the good and the bad? Here is what to watch this fall, so you can see the best new friendships, new loves, new action, and new heart. Now, CW 2nd and last new show of the fall pulls to our screens tonight in the way of a familiar name, Nikita\u2026.\n\nWhat the CW Says:\n\nWhen she was a deeply troubled teenager, Nikita was rescued from death row by a secret U.S. agency known only as Division, who faked her execution and told her she was being given a second chance to start a new life and serve her country. What they didn\u2019t tell her was that she was being trained as a spy and assassin. Ultimately, Nikita was betrayed and her dreams shattered by the only people she thought she could trust. Now, after three years in hiding, Nikita is seeking retribution and making it clear to her former bosses that she will stop at nothing to expose and destroy their covert operation. For the time being, however, Division continues to recruit and train other young people, erasing all evidence of their former lives and turning them into cold and efficient killers. One of these new recruits, Alex, is just beginning to understand what lies ahead for her and why the legendary Nikita made the desperate decision to run. The series stars Maggie Q as Nikita, Lyndsy Fonseca as Alex, Shane West as Michael, Aaron Stanford as Birkhoff, Ashton Holmes as Thom, Tiffany Hines as Jaden, with Melinda Clarke as Amanda and Xander Berkeley as Percy.\n\nTune In: I have never seen another Nikita series, so all I am basing this review on is the new CW pilot airing tonight at 9\/8c staring Maggie Q.\n\nNikita works so, so well, and that is mostly all due the action packed nature of its star Maggie Q, who while kicking and punching delivers emotion and depth to her betrayed character. The pilot however features a very unexpected ending and is very much more than a Nikita-fronted series. The series also co-stars Lyndsy Fonseca (How I Met Your Mother) as Alex, a newbie to the program that is hiding a lot more than she lets on to her teachers played by Xander Berkley, Shane West, and the tough Melinda Clarke. Nikita is fun, but dark which goes perfectly with its lead in The Vampire Diaries.\n\nWatch, Record, Skip? Watch, watch, watch. The Nikita pilot is a uniquely structured thrill ride that is not aimed for 40-something males rather a younger generation of action seekers and intrigue seekers a like. Nikita airs out of The Vampire Diaries tonight at 9\/8c on the CW.",

I\u2019m in trouble if my wife looks up my medical records. And this nurse won\u2019t even give me the courtesy of trusting my henchman honor. She didn\u2019t even mention insurance, I had to bring it up, and I\u2019m pretty 100% sure that that\u2019s not how it goes, okay?

I wrote \u201cI Am A Mountain (y estoy hundiendo)\u201d on a strict schedule after months of letting the tale marinate in my brain, just because it was a story I wanted to tell. I edited the work six weeks after I finished it, even though I doubted there would be a market for it. And, wouldn\u2019t you know it, a submission call for an anthology appeared asking for diverse, unique superhero stories\u2026 just like the one I wrote! The stars aligned, and in the end they spelled out a heavenly message reading, \u201cWe like this story, but not LIKE like it,\u201d a kind message that\u2019s still as indefinite as the depths of space.\n\nThat was then. Here\u2019s what I do to move forward.\n\nMy favorite movie of all time is \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas.\u201d I\u2019d love to discuss the characters, story, and relevance of this film at a later date, but I imagine you all have the same question on your minds: \u201cDo you watch this movie on Halloween, or on Christmas?\u201d My answer: I watch it whenever I get a rejection letter. More than just counterbalancing a low point in my life, watching this movie (and its climactic song) reminds me that failure does not define you, and that your dignity is essentially invincible. So the next time you get a rejection letter, use that stumbling block as an excuse to watch your favorite movie. Or, you could watch mine and sing along, from Jack\u2019s mopey beginning to his triumphant end\u2026\n\nA Review\/Analysis of \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars\u00a0Story\u201d\n\n\nIt is a dark time for Word Salad Spinner.\n\nOk, it was a dark time for this blog, but I\u2019m back now! You know me; I can\u2019t resist Star Wars, or even an irrelevant allusion. Which brings me to my two disclaimers before I complete the last segment of my blog\u2019s brief detour into reviewing sci-fi movies:\n\n  \u2022 My love for this franchise extends beyond reoccurring characters with great recasting and even better makeup. Even obscure references like \u201cforce of others\u201d and \u201cWhills\u201d cause my critical facilities to skip a beat. It\u2019s folly to ask for \u201cobjective criticism\u201d in art, and if you want an objective opinion from me on Star Wars, you might as well deck the halls with boughs of folly (Disclaimer 1.5: I\u2019m excited to be writing again and I\u2019m out of practice too!).\n  \u2022 I stand by all the negatives I brought up in my Star Wars Episode VII review. But you should know: I, from the depths of my still-healing soul, love that movie. My attitude in the review I wrote was \u201cpretty good for a cash-in,\u201d but every time I rewatched that movie, the new characters, old twists, and sheer beauty of it all turned me into a kid every time. It\u2019s still better than the prequels and not as good as the originals, but the movie is not so middle-of-the-road in terms of quality.\n\nSo I\u2019ve probably already spoiled in the disclaimer (and will spoil plot details after this paragraph, turn back now ye unworthy) that I really liked Rogue One. As good as The Force Awakens? In many ways better than Episode VII, and in many ways worse. But like Episode VII, its characters are both well developed and poorly planned, its fanservice wonderful and unnecessary, its action comprehensive and unclear. Despite all these contradictory comparisons, the movie remains an entirely different creature from The Force Awakens.\u00a0If you disliked Episode VII, this movie will probably address a lot of your complaints. Overall, it\u2019s an engaging, if occasionally frustrating and ultimately shallower, experience.\n\nContinue reading \u201cA Review\/Analysis of \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars\u00a0Story\u201d\u201d",

        "text":"Lifetime Movies: A cautionary\u00a0tale\n\nSince getting DVR, I have taken up a lot of ill advised television habits-the worst of which is an unhealthy dependance on Lifetime original movies. This has had a couple of undesired side effects. See, there are two types of Lifetime movies that call to me. The first, like \u201cA Date with Darkness,\u201d tells the harrowing tale of a too good-looking dude, \u00a0his dark secret, and the women brave enough to stand up to him.\n\nWe've all been there. Right ladies?\n\nThe other, which has had even more disastrous side effects, is the rom com. The problem is that a Lifetime rom com, like say, \u201cLying to be Perfect\u201d takes everything you love about rom coms and turn them up to 11. A typical, big budget rom com is so contrived that you can sit down and watch it and leave without having your world view disrupted. A Lifetime movie is so much more contrived and unbelievable that it ends up cycling back to completely acceptable and then it changes EVERYTHING.\n\nBefore, I was content to meet guys the normal way-through friends, or at a bar or party. Now, I\u2019m convinced that I need to make my life into the ridiculous, over the top rom coms that I so hate\/love. The real issue is that when you commit to something that is only acceptable in the Lifetime world, it has the absolute opposite effect, in that you immediately become the kind of person that guys run, not walk away from.\n\nOn a recent trip into crazy-land, I decided that a really cute, rom com way to meet a guy was to end up sharing an umbrella on a rainy day. I was walking home from work and I spotted an extremely handsome, umbrella-less guy. I thought it would be weird, and maybe take away from the adorableness if I offered, so instead I just walked awkwardly close to him with my umbrella held out, so that he might happen to be under it and then laugh and tell me thanks and then one thing would lead to another and so on. What actually happened, though, was that the handsome dude was too tall for me to get an umbrella over him without really reaching, and also walked too fast for me to casually sync up with him; so instead of being the cute girl who was generous with her umbrella, I was the scary girl chasing him with my umbrella stuck out in such a way that it probably looked like I was trying to use it as a weapon.\n\nDoesn't this look nice? THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEEEEEEE!\n\nThe flip side of the Lifetime effect is that when you\u2019re not assuming that the hot guy on the train is going to catch you when you slip on the ice above ground and then tend to your sprained ankle over a home-made pasta dinner, you\u2019re thinking he\u2019s going to follow you home, tie you up, and sell you into sex slavery. Unfortunately, I tend to get my signals crossed when deciding which instinct to go with. Last summer, I lived in a less than stellar neighborhood, where my cup runneth over with catcalls and jeers from my fellow Harlem-ers. One night, I was walking home from the subway when a young man emerged from a bodega and started walking a little ways behind me. After 3 blocks of him maintaining the same 5 yard distance behind me, I became convinced that he was setting the first steps of his diabolical rape\/murder\/trafficking operation into motion. One block more and the thought had taken over. I began walking faster and faster, and then, after turning the corner before my last half block, I burst out my best sprint, managing to get through my front door to my apartment just before he turned the corner himself.\n\nI sat in the foyer of my apartment building, my hands still shaking with adrenaline, congratulating myself on outsmarting a criminal, when I heard the unmistakeable slam of my industrial strength front door. I whipped around to find my would be attacker, a gorgeous twenty-something with an ipod and a briefcase, wearing his best biz cas. There was no doubt that this guy had been completely aware of every step of my downward spiral. He looked at me, annoyed and said \u201c2B,\u201d pointing to the stairs that I was currently blocking. I moved out of the way, too embarrassed to speak, and watched my never-before seen neighbor walk up the stairs, and into the apartment that he clearly lived in, and that clearly wasn\u2019t lit by lamps with skin-covered shades.\n\nI\u2019m not crazy. I don\u2019t love all Lifetime movies. I wasted two hours of my life that I\u2019ll never get back on watching \u201cA Friendship to Die For,\u201d on New Years Eve, and I couldn\u2019t even get 3o minutes into Sarah Chalke\u2019s four hour epic romance, \u201cManeater.\u201d \u00a0I keep saying I\u2019m going to kick this habit and return to life as a more normal, decidedly sane person. But then I queue up the DVR list, and find that at midnight the night before Sarah recorded \u201cAnd Baby Will Fall.\u201d\n\n\"This thriller will put a chill down your spine in a story of love, greed, and one psychotic killer.\" -Review of \"And Baby Will Fall.\" PUT IT IN MY EYESSSSSSS!\n\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized.

        "text":"Wednesday, January 25, 2006\n\nPicked Flick #64: Bullets Over Broadway\n\n\"I'm an artist!\" John Cusack bellows in the first line of Bullets Over Broadway, the last Woody Allen movie that needn't be embarrassed of such an opening. What is truly, wonderfully disarming about the movie is that Cusack's David Shayne, for all of his obviously Woody-ish mannerisms, doesn't sap the air out of the movie like most of Allen's recent alter egos have, especially when Allen has played them himself. Sure, it's probably a flaw that the scenes in which David bellyaches to his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker), agent (Jack Warner), and best friend (Rob Reiner) about the proper role of the artist make so little impression. Still, the formulaic punchlines and underserved characters don't weigh against the movie because Allen, for the first time since The Purple Rose of Cairo, aspires as much to entertain his audience as to sell his ambitions or gnaw away at his philosophical obsessions. Don't get me wrong: I don't necessarily favor Woody's comedies over his dramas, as higher entries on this list will verify. But Allen's humor can be so vivid and his direction so encouraging to comic actors that it seems a shame he has become so parsimonious with those gifts. That co-scripter Douglas McGrath's own subsequent movies felt so weightless, in absolute contrast to Allen's crushing self-consciousness in Deconstructing Harry and Match Point, implies that their partnership on this screenplay was an especially inspired and well-timed stroke of luck. The movie also has a reasonably credible beginning, middle, and end, even if the plot grows overly obedient to rather inane moral arguments. Finally, I think it's Allen's best-looking movie since Manhattan, achieving the kind of playful zest in its Damon Runyon interiors and pop-colored palette that his other Depression-set movies have often nodded toward but never fully attained. Jeffrey Kurland's costumes are especially marvelous, as giddy and plush with outrageous comic abandon as are the movie's dialogue and its performances.\n\nBut let's not bury the lead: Bullets Over Broadway lives, sparkles, even jubilates because of its dialogue and its performances. Why does it feel a little embarrassing to say so? Perhaps mainstream film criticism places such exclusive emphasis on words, story, acting, and character that it feels almost regressive to praise a movie so roundly in those terms. But there it is, and happily so. The narrative conceit of David Shayne's turgidly sub-O'Neill script, God of Our Fathers, is brilliantly borne out by such believably lumpen lines as \"The days blend together like melted celluloid, like a film whose images become distorted and meaningless\"\u2014a line, in fact, that wouldn't feel at all out of place amid the strenuous solipsisms of Interiors (though, at least in that film's case, I take the solipsisms to be purposeful). As the plot requires, not just Shayne's writing but his way of speaking is utterly shown up by the perfect, vulgar concision of Chazz Palminteri's Cheech, who screams of David's play, \"It stinks on fuckin' hot ice!\" Dianne Wiest's Oscar-winning turn as the boozy, stentorian Helen Sinclair remains the movie's most famous calling-card. Like the movie itself, Wiest's broad overplaying yields so many dozens of delightful moments that you don't care how often the seams show in what she's doing, how Helen is so obviously more of a joke machine than a character. Even the justly celebrated running gag around the line \"Don't speak!\" is regularly excelled by Wiest's camp modulations and leopard growls at other moments, snaring David's ego through well-calculated praise in a bar, parading him around the roof of her Manhattan apartment, huffing out her love for the dark, empty theater where they rehearse with a perfectly pronounced, Hepburnian \"Look! would you look!\" When David enters her apartment and praises her exquisite taste, her purring retort\u2014\"My taste is superb, my eyes are exquisite!\"\u2014is almost literally killer. Indeed, her floridly self-conscious style of seduction, previously unknown outside of those species of insects that eat their young, is a gift that keeps giving, full of glorious, histrionic silences in which Helen mentally assembles her next audition for the Baby Jane-ish role of herself.\n\nBut you know, as I've belly-laughed my way through sixth and seventh and eighth viewings of the movie, the frizzed, helium-filled performance of Jennifer Tilly has come to rival Wiest's, revealing real creative ingenuity; look how many of her best scenes are delivered with her back to the camera, as when she lobbies in vain with David to protect the one speech she has managed to memorize (\"But I like to say it...\"), or when, also on-stage, her fabulously flubbed exclamation \"The heart is labynthinine!\" is somehow made even more uproarious by the perfect timing and ostrichy posture of her walk. But wait! The single funniest bit of physical acting in the movie isn't Wiest's or Tilly's but Tracey Ullman's. Just watch as Eden Brent, Ullman's own accelerated riff on actressy eccentricity, becomes the first among David's cast to publicly endorse one of Cheech's dramaturgical tips. It's a one-second tour-de-force in a film that just brims with instants like this. You can watch Bullets Over Broadway with the sound off and have a thrilling time. You can listen to it from the next room and achieve total bliss. The fullness and variety of its pleasures still don't amount to Allen's best movie, not even one of his best five (and bully for him for setting such a high bar), but of all of his pictures, I do think Bullets is his most easily, frothily, and durably enjoyable. (Click here for the full list of Nick's Picked Flicks.)\n\nLabels: , , , ,\n\n\nBlogger\u00a0tim r said...\n\nI second all this. BoB is just fantastic fun, however contrived the payoff. It's got pizzazz. I love that you make mention of that Ullman moment - she kind of throws her hands up in a giggly don't-shoot-the-messenger way, right? You've also gotta love Jim Broadbent scoffing all of his cakes and his scenes with Tilly. And the timing of Cusack's line reading at the Mafioso's mansion when he says \"I'm just gonna... go now, and get the help that I need...\" We let Woody off his Big Idea about art and authorship because it's just such a great excuse for an ensemble mash-up. Love it.\n\n7:47 AM, January 25, 2006 \u00a0\n\nPost a Comment\n\n<< Home",

During this period, the air is extremely dry and dusty so I find that I need to take extra beauty measures to combat the possible effects of the weather. Here are some products that I love and recommend you have in your Harmattan armour.\n\nBeautysets - Harmattan Beauty Must-Haves\nHarmattan Beauty Must-Haveswith\nSoap & Glory, Organic Root Stimulator, St. Ives\n\nMonday, 19 November 2012\n\nObama Bribed Blacks, Hispanics, Young Voters And Women To Win \u2013 Mitt Romney\n\nMore than one week after the United States presidential elections in which he was defeated by incumbent and Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, the Republican flag bearer, Mitt Romney, at a conference call with donors, Thursday, alleged that his efforts to beat Obama at the polls was unsuccessful because\u00a0 of \u2018gifts\u2019 the administration gave to black, hispanic and young voters.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s campaign focused on giving targeted groups a big gift, so he made a big effort on small things. Those small things, by the way, add up to trillions of dollars.\u201d Mr Romney said.\nHe pointed at healthcare reform legislation and a decision to suspend deportation of certain illegal immigrants who came to the country as children by the president, proved \u201chighly motivational\u201d on Election Day.\n\nJustin Bieber And Selena Gomez Fail To Patch Things Up Over Dinner Date\n\nThey\u2019re off, then they\u2019re on\u2026then\u00a0off\u00a0again? Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez just can\u2019t seem to make up their minds. After the young couple\u2019s split went public\u00a0just a week ago, the pair attempted to reconcile a few days later\u2013but then, apparently are on the outs again as of Friday night.\nOkay, okay. Who can keep up with these crazy kids? Here\u2019s a quick rundown to what Bieber and Gomez have been up to since the breakup. On Tuesday, Bieber\u2013apparently not thrilled about being dumped\u2013landed himself a traffic ticket for speeding around West Hollywood in his Ferrari. He hopped on a motorcycle to show off some more on Wednesday, but then reportedly picked up Gomez\u00a0from the airport that evening and spent the night with her.\n\nKeri Hilson Abuja Show \u2013 A Flop?\n\nKeri Hilson headlined The Face Of Sofa show in Abuja, Nigeria over the weekend.\nBy the look of the photos, the show was a flop with more than half of the seats unsold.\nTickets were priced high at N7500, VIP: N20,000, VVIP: N500,000 respectively.\nDid you go to the show?\n\nPeter Okoye (of P-Square) vs. His Son, Cameron, Who Pulled It Off Better?\n\nJust a few moments ago, one half of the globally acclaimed superstar duo, P-SquarePeter Okoye \u2013 put up a couple of pictures of he and his son, Cameron posing in similar outfits.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that they both look adorable but it\u2019s a shame that one person must have pulled it off better. So, who do you think looks cooler?\n\n\u201cNo lady had twins for me, I am still separated from Toni Payne\u201d \u2013 9ice\n\n20 months after it was reported that an Abuja-based woman named Vicky had delivered a set of twins for 9ice, the Alapomeji boss has come out to deny the reports.\n\nIn an interview with Vanguard Newspaper, when questioned about his twins, he immediately denied it, clearly stating that the story \u2018is not true\u2019.\n\u2018I wish the press would verify their stories about me before publishing them. Nobody had any baby for me. That story is not true and I want to tell you that they are making it up\u2018, he said.\n\nBostwana deports 300 Nigerians\n\nNo fewer than 300 Nigerians living in the Republic of Botswana have been deported home by Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama\u2019s administration in the past few months, after the authorities refused to renew their permits.\n\nThe angry deportees want President Goodluck Jonathan and the National Assembly to quickly look into the relations between Bostwana and Nigeria in order to ascertain the true conditions of Nigerians living in that country.\n\n\nThe out & about at the American Music Award 2012,\u00a0 which took place last night and that was dominated by Justin Bieber who won 3 awards.

To make matters worse, Cristiano Ronaldo got an injury in eyebrow bone after an horrible clash with Levante Defender in last league game and he had been suspended to receive treatment for the present.\n\nOmawumi talks about her daughter, \u2018kokoma\u2019 and \u2018bottom belle\u2019\n\nIn prelude to the release of her forthcoming single \u2013 Stay Alive, Omawumi had a chat with Seun Apara where she spoke about sundry issues and the meaning of words and phrases off her most recent single.\nBasically, the word \u2018Kokoma\u2019, what does it mean?\nI came back from America with my daughter when she was about two and half months or three months. My mum was with me for about four months to take care of the baby. When my mum was with me, I used to sing \u2018Omawumi\u2019s baby, Grandma Warri\u2019s baby, Grandma Lekki\u2019s baby\u2019, and so on. Kokoma is like a drum beat or dance style of highlife that could be related to Ghanaian highlife in the 60\u2032s or 70\u2032s.

According to Wilhelmina, their choice of breezy is because \u201cChris Brown is a\u2026multifaceted artist with a unique take on style, and we are excited to translate and extend his brand.\u201d\n\nOn Keri Hilson, who is set for Abuja, the FCT in Nigeria soon, she's headlining a show tagged-The Face of SOFA. The agency would explore and develop opportunities in fashion, beauty, editorial & licensing for the gorgeous music act.\u00a0\n\nCheck out a few pictures of both artists below.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Miss Big World Nigeria pageant that took place last Saturday November 10th. 25yr old Olufemi Adu Felicia, a graduate of mass communication (pictured above left) was crowned the winner, while 27 year old \u00a0Emmanuella Egoigbo, (pictured above right) a graduate of law was first runner up. 1...

It\u2019s long, for one. Its scope rivals a DeMille-directed Biblical epic. It is a glimpse into the very heart of terror and savagery\u00a0and ice. It enshrines the ghost of a young Sibelius. In Kullervo, Sibelius began to chop a road through a dark and snowy forest. He may have abandoned that\u00a0road, ultimately preferring another path of tighter, leaner construction.\u00a0But\u00a0his decision makes the road untaken all the more fascinating. As listeners, we stand at the edge of Kullervo and peer into the vast unexplored darkness beyond.\n\nContinue reading\n\n\nFiled under Minnesota Orchestra, Reviews\n\nReview: Minnesota Orchestra in Gabrieli, Dietter,\u00a0Tchaikovsky\n\nYesterday\u00a0I made the two hour trek across\u00a0the tundra for a 2pm performance of Eiji Oue conducting the Minnesota Orchestra at Orchestra Hall.\n\nSnow came early to the northern plains this year. It feels like December \u2013 indeed, a lot of people have just said \u201cscrew it\u201d and lit\u00a0their lights a couple weeks early \u2013 but obviously we\u2019re not even to Thanksgiving yet, so we\u2019re also in a kind\u00a0of holiday limbo land. It\u2019s a weighty question: do we follow the calendar or the snow?\n\nI mention this because the program opened with various selections by Giovanni Gabrieli for two brass choirs. And especially at this time of year, said instrumentation\u00a0bellows carol, cathedrals, Christmas. It felt like implicit permission to kick off the warmth and coziness of the holiday season without guilt.\n\nThe two choirs were situated on opposite sides of the Orchestra Hall stage, one anchored by tuba, the other by bass trombone (shout-out to new kid Andrew Chappell!).\u00a0Obviously they\u2019re normally\u00a0tucked behind an impenetrable Wall of Strings, so it was a fascinating joy to watch the players and their faces. I really think the orchestra is onto something by programming smaller\u00a0pieces in the first half, followed by a big blockbuster in the second. My Sunday audience seemed to enjoy\u00a0the set-up\u00a0too; as the sharply sculpted phrases were traded back and forth, listeners\u2019 heads oscillated from side-to-side in appreciation. And what\u00a0a sound a brass choir makes.\u00a0You have to be in the same room with that core-rumbling buzz to really experience it.\n\nAfter the Gabrieli came another rarity: a double bassoon concerto by Christian Ludwig Dietter. A\u00a0different colleague joined principal John Miller, Jr., for each movement. Miller arrived at the Minnesota Orchestra in 1971 (before Orchestra Hall was even built, much less remodeled), and is the longest serving principal player in Orchestra history. That kind of devotion not just to an art, but to an ensemble and a community,\u00a0is hugely humbling.\u00a0My hat goes off to anyone who sticks with an\u00a0organization through so many years\u2026especially through the intermittent hopelessness of the last three.\n\nThe music in the Dietter may have been slight, but it was perfect for showcasing the easy chemistry of the soloists. What a joy to see colleagues working so effortlessly together. (In between movements, the departing colleague would high-five the arriving one, to warm applause and scattered laughter at the informal unconventionality of the gesture.)\u00a0I think it\u2019s easy to forget how outright beautiful the gentle bassoon can be, placed as it is in the orchestra\u2019s texture, so it was lovely\u00a0to have this reminder. As for the orchestra, I\u2019ve definitely heard them give crisper accompaniments, but clarity isn\u2019t always Maestro Eiji Oue\u2019s first priority\u2026 For an encore, Miller played a Swedish Walking Song with ethereal orchestral accompaniment, and that was delicately breathtaking.\n\nThe big marquee event, though, came\u00a0after intermission: \u00a0Tchaikovsky 5.\n\nTchaikovsky 5 is one of those pieces I really, really know. I really, really love it. I am really, really uncool.\u00a0And yet, bizarrely, I have no favorite recordings, no interpretation I\u2019m married to\u2026or even dating. Which was good, because if you\u2019d gone into the hall expecting a particular interpretation, you were going to be disappointed, simply because this one was soooo far out there.\n\nThe craziest thing about it was the tempi. There were so many yanks and tugs at tempo that the bartenders could have sold Dramamine instead of drinks at intermission. Tchaikovsky can feel pretty episodic to begin with, and instead of smoothing over the seams, Eiji Oue highlighted them by stopping, starting, and occasionally sprinting through them. So that\u2019s one way of approaching a potential problem, I guess: highlighting it, and making no apologies for it. It\u00a0definitely resulted in a unique interpretation. Sometimes\u00a0that interpretation\u00a0veered so far from conventional practice (not to mention the score), it almost came across as a pastiche.\n\nAnd I was smiling the whole time. Both at the beauty of it, and the ballsiness of it. The\u00a0interaction between conductor and orchestra was hilarious to see. Mom caught Dave Williamson cracking up. Erin Keefe\u2019s body language was all like: follow me through the storm! And there was one priceless moment when Eiji leaned over to principal viola Tom Turner virtuosically scrubbing away, enticing Tom to give just a little more, and I could practically see Tom\u2019s thought bubble: I\u2019M GIVING ALL I GOT.\n\nAnd that final movement! Only a virtuoso band could pull off what they did. It continually danced on the edge of completely imploding and exploding in a fiery cataclysm of confusion and honking horns. But of course at the very last minute, the tempos would lurch back, and everyone somehow burst through the exultant finish line together. You\u2019ve got to hand it to the strings in particular for\u00a0dashing forward with such confidence and cohesion.\n\nI\u2019ve seen him in-concert twice now, and I think my relationship with Eiji\u00a0Oue is like my relationship with candy corn. Outside\u00a0the period of approximately one week in the late autumn, candy corn is not particularly appealing. But once a year, candy corn is WONDERFUL. It\u2019s\u00a0fun. It\u2019s corn-y. It\u00a0mimics the shape of a kernel of a nourishing vegetable, and that\u2019s cool.\u00a0In fact, I went out of my way earlier this year to buy a bag of candy corn, and I didn\u2019t regret\u00a0the purchase. Would I want candy corn every weekend? No. Does that mean I dislike candy corn? I just got done telling you I consider candy corn to be great fun.\n\nSo. I could argue very persuasively about why this performance should not work, could not work, and did not work. But one of the valuable lessons I took away from the lockout is, sometimes it doesn\u2019t really matter how something is played, providing the experience surrounding it is unique enough. And you have got to admit, between the sparkly pants, generous swooping, and grins of manic wild-eyed sincerely-felt\u00a0joy, Eiji Oue creates experiences. I think people who focus solely on the quality of performance, ignoring or even criticizing the air of electricity, are maybe missing the point. This was definitely a show worth catching, an experience worth having.\n\nIt was a joy to see such joy. 2014 has been a year of historic, absurdly high stakes shows at Orchestra Hall. Stanislaw Skrowaczewski conducted the first homecoming concert back in February, with everyone in the music world\u00a0gruesomely interested in whether this great orchestra had survived a sixteen-month lockout intact. The Osmo Sibelius Grammy concerts happened as the board was deciding whether to rehire him. Same with the one-night Josh Bell \/ Osmo show. The glitzy, hugely expensive, and ultimately successful Renee Fleming gala was pressured to be ultra flashy and fabulous. The Mahler Resurrection concerts in late September mused on\u00a0themes of fricking Life, Death, and Life After Death. It was a joy just to have crazy fun again, to hear the depth of sound that this great orchestra makes, and to walk out the lobby door to downtown Minneapolis with the faith that everything will be okay.\n\n\n\nFiled under Minnesota Orchestra, Reviews\n\nMicroreview: Minnesota Orchestra, Mendelssohn,\u00a0Wagner\n\nWe all know I can write long.\u00a0Even Alex Ross knows this.\n\n\nI remember when this happened\u2026 *dreamy sigh*\n\nBut can I write short? Uh\u2026 Not really.\n\nSo to practice, I\u2019m going to take the Strib\u2019s review word count and work within that limit. This week\u2019s Minnesota Orchestra Strib review belonged to Michael Anthony and clocked in at 456 words, so I\u2019ll try to stay under 450. I do like to go long when I\u2019m actually in the hall \u2013 in-person, I always see and hear a lot I want to write about \u2013 but when I\u2019m just listening over the radio, I don\u2019t see any harm in going short. I\u2019m calling these micro-reviews. For lack of a better term.\n\nIf anyone wants to join in on the micro-review fun, do. The more the merrier when it comes to discussing concerts.\n\n\nYou know the best way to listen to a Minnesota Orchestra concert?\n\nLivestreaming on a laptop!\n\n\nWell, it\u2019s better than nothing. After a fashion report from Brian Newhouse (apparently Erin Keefe was wearing a \u201cbeautiful dark blue sleeveless gown\u201d), Friday\u2019s concert began with the Mendelssohn violin concerto. It was disorienting to jump into a concerto without an overture, but there was a 70-minute ~WAGNER EXTRAVAGANZA~ after intermission to consider.\n\nThe orchestra played with fine, elegant understatement. And I\u2019m not sure I cared for that. I usually like my Mendelssohn with icy aristocratic soloists and wild-eyed accompaniment. It was the opposite dynamic here: Erin ... (truncated)",
