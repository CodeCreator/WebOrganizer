To better understand how Artec Studio algorithms use different components of your PC,\u00a0check out this article.\n\nAlso, browse the articles in the \"Compatible hardware\", section, where we publish performance tests and tips.\n\n\n1. General requirements\n\nOS Windows 7, 8 or 10 (x64)\nUSB 1 x USB 2.0, USB 3.0 compatible\nProcessor Intel Core i5 (76xx and later) or Intel Core i7 or Intel Core i9\nRAM 12 GB for Artec Eva \/ 18 GB for Artec Spider\nVideo cards\n\n\nRecommended: NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series or higher, at least 1 GB of memory\n\nNVIDIA Quadro and Intel cards are officially supported beginning with Artec Studio 11.\n\nNot supported:\n\n  \u2022 Windows XP\n  \u2022 Windows Vista\n  \u2022 32-bit OS\n  \u2022 AMD FirePro M6100 Fire GL V\n\nNot recommended:\n\n  \u2022 Intel Xeon and AMD processors\n  \u2022 NVIDIA SLI and AMD CrossFire configurations\n\n\n2. Detailed requirements\n\n2.1. Operating system\n\n  \u2022 We recommend Windows 7, 8 or 10 (64-bit).\n  \u2022 Windows XP and Vista are not supported.\n  \u2022 Starting with Artec Studio 9.2, we no longer support 32-bit software.\n  \u2022 More information about the compatibility of discontinued Artec scanners with Windows 8 and 10 is available in\u00a0this article.\n\n2.2. USB\n\n  \u2022 You\u2019ll need 1x USB2.0 port for a regular scanner.\n  \u2022 Artec Eva, Spider and Space Spider are compatible with USB 3.0.\n  \u2022 When you\u2019re connecting several scanners\/sensors to one computer, we recommend using a desktop PC. Also, you\u2019ll need several independent USB2.0 hosts or PCI Express USB2.0 cards, and you should plug each scanner\/sensor into a separate USB controller.\n\n2.3. Processor\n\nIntel processors\n\n  \u2022 We recommend Intel Core i5-76xx and later, or Intel Core i7 processors: Nehalem microarchitecture and later\n  \u2022 Also, we ourseves use Intel i9 processor (Intel Core i9-7900X 3.30 GHz) and we can confirm that it works great!\n  \u2022 The CPU benchmark tests are here; processors ranked higher on the list are better.\n  \u2022 Xeon processors will work with Artec Studio, but we don\u2019t recommend them: in our experience, they provide lower scanning speed and lower processing performance than Core i5\/i7 processors.\n\nAMD processors\n\nWe don\u2019t recommend AMD processors. Our customers have reported that AMD-based systems occasionally show the error message \u201cKMP_AFFINITY\u201d and don\u2019t allow 3D scanning. If you\u2019re considering a new PC, we strongly recommend one with an Intel processor.\n\n\n2.4. RAM\n\n  \u2022 You\u2019ll need 12 GB of RAM for postprocessing projects captured with Artec Eva and 18 GB for projects captured with Artec Spider or Space Spider.\n  \u2022 The general rule is that for reasonably fast post-processing, your RAM capacity should be three times the size of your project.\n\n\n2.5. Videocards\n\nMain article: How to choose a videocard for 3D-scanning and processing\n\nConsult these articles for additional information:\n\nAlso, we highly recommend that you check out this link,\u00a0which provides benchmarks for high-performance video cards.\n\n\nWe are here to help!

Check the Applicable Products and Categories section of this article before starting these steps.\n\nThe writing functionality of the stylus (pen) for the Digital Paper System is disabled if the tip is pressed while connecting the USB cable to charge it. To re-enable functionality, reconnect then disconnect the stylus to the USB cable without pressing the tip.\n\nMake sure that your stylus is fully charged for optimal performance. You may experience slowness or lag during handwriting or annotations if it isn't sufficiently charged.\n\n\n  \u2022 Charging time is up to three hours using a USB connection to an active computer or to an AC adapter, such as a smartphone charger.\n  \u2022 The red indicator turns off when the stylus is fully charged.\n  \u2022 The average estimated battery life or usage time is approximately one month (based on writing usage of 60 minutes per day).\n\nOther Things to Check\n\nIf the issue still occurs, additional troubleshooting is available. Check if the stylus works after each step.\n\n  1. Re-calibrate the stylus (pen).\n    1. On your device, press the Home Home button button.\n    2. Tap Settings.\n    3. Tap System Settings.\n    4. Select Pen Calibration.\n      1. Select the variation that most resembles your own grip from the four variations displayed on how to hold the pen, then select Next.\n      2. Use the pen to trace the dotted lines as you would normally write.\n      3. Tap Next.\n      4. Tap the arrows that point up, down, left, and right to move the line that you drew and align it with the dotted line.\n      5. Tap Next when the lines are in basically the same position.\n        \u2022 The confirmation screen is displayed.\n      6. Trace the dotted line again, as you did in step 2.\n        \u2022 If the line that you drew appears displaced, tap Recalibrate to return to the previous screen. The line that you drew on the confirmation screen will be displayed, so correct the placement again, as you did in step 4. After you finish correcting the position, tap Next, and trace the dotted line on the confirmation screen again.\n      7. Tap Save when the dotted line and the line that you drew appear to line up.\n  2. Initialize your device to factory default settings.\n\n    WARNING! All files will be deleted. Back up important data on your computer.\n\n    1. Press the Home Home button button.\n    2. Tap Settings.\n    3. Tap System Settings.\n    4. Tap Initialize Digital Paper.",
