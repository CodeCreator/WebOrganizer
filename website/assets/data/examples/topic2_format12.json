We are serious about our craft and always pushing to improve the way we do things. And we like to push the industry as a whole to improve. We call this our Software Excellence pillar.\n\nOpen source is foundational to software excellence and allows us to stay at the forefront of innovation. Using open source gives us solutions superior to proprietary in cost, freedom, privacy, security, quality and community. Building open source allows us to pay it forward, share new ways of working, and learn from the wider community.\n\nWhat We Are Building\n\nOur technologists bring successful, field-tested techniques and ideas from around the globe to open source solutions. Here are some highlights of our work across many domains including software development, testing, privacy, security, and global health.\n\n\u200bBahmni, an easy to use EMR & hospital management system, combines and enhances multiple open source products into a single solution. It has been designed keeping in mind the needs of hospitals in low resource settings.\n\nSimplify Continuous Delivery.

With the help of DeepLearning.scala, regular programmers are able to build complex neural networks from simple code. You write code almost as usual.\n\nCoyIM is an instant messaging desktop application for the XMPP protocol that works with security and privacy features enabled by default, making it easier to hold a private conversation. 'Security by default' and simplicity are its strongest features.\n\nTalisman validates code changes before they're pushed from working copies of GitHub repos. Using GitHub's pre-push hook, Talisman scans file names to prevent pushing changesets that appear to reveal compromising information.\n\nAppium Test Distribution, a tool for running android and iOS Appium tests in parallel across devices\n\nMock objects framework for testing Objective-C code.

The library contains more than 1000+ UI components, all ready to include and use immediately in your project.\n\nWe have a well-defined product roadmap that we are asking our community to add to and influence, so you can review and share your feedback on GetWidget as well as contribute as developers if you so choose.\n\nGetWidget was developed internally by our team over the past year and we found it saved us so much time on new projects we thought others could benefit as well. This led us to develop some core reusable libraries for our development community to hugely decrease UI development and reduce the initial learning curve.\n\nWe have initially looked at the most used components, but are committed to adding many more widgets over time. We want to actively work with the wider Dev community to make sure we are focussed on user needs.\n\nWe were in flutter development from long and love it so we start thinking to develop some libraries for our Dev community to make UI development faster and better with the lesser learning curve.\n\nYou can upvote on our development plans via our published roadmap, request a new feature and also raise any bugs direct with us as well via our Raise Bug OR \u00a0Feedback services. Please follow our docs, and collaborate with us to help us improve GetWidget as well.\n\nYou can follow our docs and help us to improve it as well.\n\nWe have launched our official GetWidget Libraries on Github and Pub for the Dev community to start playing around with, so please share feedback or raise any questions comments or issues on our FLUTTER GITHUB.\n\nWe love to be social! So, of course, we also have accounts across all major social platforms that developers use. Why not join and keep updated?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in touch with us via our GetWidget community.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you very soon. Finally \u2013 we\u2019re also launching our official Logo today, let us know what you think and pass the word around.\n\nNote: GetWidget is not directly and\/or indirectly associated\/affiliated with Flutter or Google LLC. We are the team of Flutter Developers and we built this open-source library for the Flutter development community to made app development more easier.\n\n\nThe GetWidget Team",

        "text":"What is historical-data.org?\n\nThis site defines a collection of schemas (applied in the form of HTML tags) that webmasters can use to markup their historical and genealogical information in a consistent way.\n\nMany sites are generated from structured data, which is often stored in databases. When this data is formatted into HTML, it becomes very difficult to recover the original structured data. Many applications, especially search engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data. On-page markup enables search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide richer search results in order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web. Markup can also enable new tools and applications that make use of the structure.\n\nProject Scope\n\nThe scope of this project is limited to defining the schemas for historical and genealogical microdata that is designed primarily to enable search engines, web crawlers, browsers, and other tools for enabling users to find and understand the historical data contained on an HTML page. As such, the schemas defined by this project are designed to be lightweight and generic and are not designed to support all of the intricacies of a rich research model that supports in-depth semantic analysis and sophisticated bibliographic accountability.\n\nDate Note\n\nSchema.org, Microformats, and Microdata all rely on the ISO 8601 date format, which does not support approximate dates. Review the Library of Congress's Extended Date and Time Format, which extends ISO 8601 and allows uncertain and approximate dates.\n\nUpdates (via our blog)\n\nStay tuned for updates to the schema and other announcements by subscribing to our blog: historical-data-schema.blogspot.com\n\nLast updated: Mon Jun 11 17:23:47 -0700 2012",

        "text":"Welcome to the Home Page of the Aida project.\n\n\nThe Aida project is two-fold: This is useful to create and maintain documentations, help files, etc, which must be distributed on different supports (Web pages, PDF documents, Wiki pages,...). The user writes his\/her files using the common Aida Markup Language and converts them to the target format with the aida command.\nThe system is fast, flexible and extensible. The core command aida is a strict parser (written using Bison and Flex) which analyses files written in the Aida Markup Language and invokes callbacks in order to convert them to the target format.\nThe aida command embeds a\nTcl language interpreter and all the callbacks are written in Tcl: the Tcl scripts constitute Aida's library. This architecture makes it easy to extend the library and define new target formats. It is also very powerful because any Tcl code can be sourced and evaluated within the Aida files and thus one can create dynamic contents, generated on the fly.\nFurthermore, the Aida files are highly parameterizable via a header and the entire system is configureable both at the admin's and at the user's level.\n\n\nThe Aida project is an Open Source project hosted by SourceForge at this address.\nThe current version is 1.4.1.\nThe latest releases can be obtained in the File Releases area.\nThe latest state of the source code can be obtained from the Subversion repository with the following command :\nsvn checkout http:\/\/svn.code.sf.net\/p\/aidadoc\/svn\/trunk Aida\n\n\nThe complete help for both the Aida Markup Language and the aida command can be found online: Aida documentation.\n\n\nThe Aida project is extendible. The code offers a simple architecture based on callbacks written in the Tcl language and it is easy to define new target formats.\n\nBug reports\n\nBugs can be officially reported via the Bug Tracker of the project. You can also submit feature requests there.\n\nMailing list\n\nFor any questions, problems, suggestions etc. about Aida, you can use the Aidadoc-users Mailing List. Click here to subscribe\/unsubscribe.\nTo post a message to the list, send an e-mail to <aidadoc-users@lists.sourceforge.net>.\nTo see the collection of prior postings to the list, visit the Aidadoc-users Archives.\n\nLast updated 2016-01-04 17:26:43\n\nAida is hosted by SourceForge.net Logo",
