As such, they will be different than the masteries you see in-game.\n\n\n\nOffense: 21\n\nHonor Guard\n\nDefense: 9\n\n\nUtility: 0\n\nGuide Top\n\n\n\nHi! My name is John and I wanted to make a guide for Vi because i like her playstyle so much. This guide maybe help improve your skill on how about to solo top with her. This is my first guide so please comment helpfull tips to improve my guide or just send me some feedback if you like it.\n\nGuide Top\n\n\nTo Vi, every problem is just another brick wall to punch through with her gigantic hextech gauntlets. Though she grew up on the wrong side of the law, Vi now uses her criminal know-how to serve Piltover's police force. Vi's brash attitude, abrasive humor, and blatant refusal to follow orders can often infuriate her by-the-books partner, Caitlyn. But even the Sheriff of Piltover cannot deny that Vi is an invaluable asset in the fight against crime.\n\nAs a child growing up in the lawless outskirts of Piltover, Vi learned to rob and cheat to get by. Stealing and stripping hextech hardware gave her the skills of a master mechanic, while life on the streets taught her self-reliance. When she was six, a ragtag group of criminals took a shine to the young delinquent and brought her into their fold. By the time Vi was eleven, she had become a seasoned accomplice, and she relished the thrill of every heist.\n\nVi's attitude changed when a raid on a mining facility went bad. She was forced to decide between fleeing with her crew and trying to save the innocent mine workers from a collapsed tunnel. Vi chose to play the hero. While searching for a way to free the mine workers from the rubble, she discovered a damaged robotic mining rig. Improvising, she wrenched off its huge fists and modified them into makeshift hextech gauntlets. Fitting the heavy weapons to her tiny hands, the young girl flexed her arm and threw a powered punch at the rubble. The force of the blow blasted away the rock. With the workers free to escape, Vi fled the scene.\n\nAfter that job gone wrong, Vi severed her connection to the crew. She returned to a life of solitary crime, but stole only from other criminals. As the years went by, Vi modified and improved her hextech fists, allowing her to bust up heists and snatch loot with ease. Eventually, word of her notoriety reached Caitlyn, the famed Sheriff of Piltover. Rather than seek Vi's arrest, Caitlyn offered the criminal a way to pay her debt to society: work for the law in Piltover. Vi laughed. To her, a job that let her beat up crooks without forcing her to run from the cops sounded perfect. She immediately accepted. Caitlyn now struggles to keep Vi in line, and Vi treats Caitlyn's orders as mere suggestions, but when they work together, they are feared by all lawbreakers in Piltover.\n\n''It's a shame. I've got two fists, but you've only got one face.''\n-- Vi\n\nGuide Top\n\nPros and Cons\n\n\n+ Good farmer ( Excessive Force).\n+ Great poke ability.\n+ High damage in early game.\n+ Initiator that can slit up the enemy team.\n+ Epic launcher music !!!\n\n\n- Really squishy without tanky items.\n- Her Q Vault Breaker is chargable and reduces her movement speed.\n- No sustain.\n- Kinda hard to master.\n\nGuide Top\n\n\n-Blast Shield (Passive).\n\nVi charges a shield over time. The shield can be activated by hitting an enemy with an ability.\nHer passive can be used to shield yourself before trading hits or if the enemy champion is trying to\ntower dive use your ulti to CC him and shield your self for the kill. Also its great defensive tool\nin teamfights but it has a cooldown.\n\n-Vault Breaker (Q)\n\nVi charges her gauntlets and unleashes a vault shattering punch, carrying her forward. Enemy that Vi collides with stop her movement and are knocked back.\nHer Q is like a chargable dash that deals damage, knock back the enemy for a short distance. Also, you can use it as an escape tool and gap closer . (Note: Your can use it to escape through walls.)\n\n-Denting Blows (W Passive)\n\nVi's punches break her opponent's armor, dealing bonus damage and granting her attack speed.\nHer W is an armor penetration tool. After 3 auto-attacks she reduce her oppoments armor, deals damage and increase her attacks speed for a short time. (Note: This ability can be combined with a Black Cleaver.)\n\n-Excessive Force (E)\n\nVi's next attack blasts through her target, dealing damage to enemies behind it.\nHer E ability is her primary damage skill. It can be use to AoE farm minnions or poke\nthe enemies behind his own minnions. It has 2 charges and a short Cooldown. In early game use it\ncarefully beacause you will propably run out of mana.\n\n-Assault and Battery (R)\n\nVi runs down an enemy, knocking aside anyone in the way. When she reaches her target she knocks it into the air, jumps after it, and slams it back into the ground.\nHer ultimate ability is an aoe knock up that deals great damage. When you use it enemies in front of will will be pushed left and right and the target will knock up with all the foes close to him.\nIts very effective in teamfights to split them up or crowd control them.\n\nGuide Top\n\n\n- Greater Mark of Attack Damage\n\n- Greater Seal of Armor\n\n- Greater Glyph of Magic Resist\n\n- Greater Quintessence of Attack Damage\n\n(Note: I dont use armor penetration marks because of her W's passive.)\n\nGuide Top\n\nSummoner Spells\n\nFlash offers a great escape tool or gapcloser to kill the enemy. RECOMMENDED\n\nIgnite offers an additional damage or it can be used to\nkill enemies in low health that you cant reach. RECOMMENDED\n\nExhaust slows enemies so you chase them easily and reduce their damage. It\ncan also, be used to kill enemies under your tower. (Note: If you are going to use it put 1 point\non Summoner's Warth from Fury .) OK\n\nGhost is a great chasing tool but its not as good as Flash on escaping. OK\n\nGuide Top\n\n\nYou can build Vi in many different ways, so ill list some good items for her.\n\nBoots depends on your lane oppoment.\n\n\/ The combination of those 2 items is epic for an AD team. Also, keep in mind that Vi's passive depends on her health.\n\nThis item gives you damage, health and cooldown reduction. Also\nthis item reduces the armor of her oppoments and its combined very well with her W and that why i\ncount it as a Core Item for her.\n\nI also count this as a Core Item because of the Sheen's, Phage and Zeal's passives that gives her a good damage + slow and some ability power for her E.\n\nBloodthirster is an offensive item that i choose for Vi cause of him damage stack and lifesteal. You can replace that with another offensive like Atma's Impaler.\n\nThis item gives Vi health and armor. Of course you can replace that\nwith Warmog's Armor, Frozen Heart or other items that may give u M.Resist. (Note: Depends on team and how fed they are.)\n\nYou can also replace this item with Guardian angler, Wit's End, Mercurial Scimitar (Hard Crowd Control enemies)or Banshee's Veil\n\nGenerally the three last items of my Standard Build can be replaced with other sustain items.\n\nGuide Top\n\n\nThe standard rotation if you are at your lane and go 1v1 is :\n\nUse Excessive Force to poke your enemie by hitting his minnions (Dont overdo it cause\nyou will run out of mana really fast)\nAfter that wait for 2 charges, use Vault Breaker then Excessive Force\nthen yout ulti Assault and Battery , Ignite, Vault Breaker and finish him with your E Excessive Force.\n\nIn teamfights i use this rotation:\n\nI open with my ulti Assault and Battery at the ad\/ap carry to Crowd Control him and split the enemy team, Ignite, Vault Breaker, and finish him with excessive forse. Keep in mind that your 2 carrys must focus on the target you are on or else you will end all alone between the enemy team.\n\nGuide Top\n\nTeam Fights\n\nWhen you are going to team fights I reccomend you to be the Initiator. With that i mean to charge forward with your Ulti at the Ad\/Ap carry and crowd control them and let your ad\/ap carry do all the work. I choose to be the Initiator cause i think it fits perfectly with Vi's abilities.\n\nGuide Top\n\nCreeping \/ Killing\n\nVi need a good amount of gold to build her. Most player can focus on last hitting minnions or either killing players. If you dont have any kills with her and you are underfarmed try to play deffensivly and farm as much as possible. If now you do have a good farm and a good amount of kills you will be the beast in the game. :)\n\nI reccomend you to farm minnions and poke enemies with Excessive Force when you can to farm better and push him out of his lane. (if your oppoment is meele it will be easy). If your oppoment is a ranged solo top like Vladimir, Teemo or Nidalee they'll counter you easily but try to play defensivly and wait for your jungler.\n\nGuide Top\n\nGame with my guide\n\nSend me your scores from games at\nFor now ill post my games.\n\nGuide Top\n\n\nSend me some comments if you like my guide and what more should I add, fix or edit.\nHope your like thank you :)\n\n\nGeneral Guides\n\nLeague of Legends\n\nMore Guides\n\nThe Charts\n\n\n30 Days\n\nAll Time\n\nTop Guide by Champion",

        "text":"Home > FIFA 16 > FIFA 16 Article > FIFA 16 Guide > The Guide of Beating Formation 4-1-2-1-2 In FIFA 16\n\nThe Guide of Beating Formation 4-1-2-1-2 In FIFA 16\n\n\nThe 4-1-2-1-2, also known as the 4-4-2 diamond,It just has all the right ingredients, 2 strikers, 1 CDM, 2 CM, and a CAM. It is a versatile formation and remains the greatest strength. It can do well no matter in attacking and defending. However, what will we do today is to learn how to beat it.\n\nTo beat 4-1-2-1-2 formation, you need to use a lower overall team with DM' s that are strong or medium pace.If you play a 4-3-3 formation, both teams being close to even overall and without custom tactics, you will lose 9 even 10 games.Keep your players in their position and don't try to tackle the ball unless you make sure a free 1v1 with a keeper. Try sitting a bit further back with defensive default tactic and never use an offside trap.Formations with 2 DM beat this formation all day long, as long as you keep calm and attempt to force them to make risky passes\/take shots from silly angles. This method just i read on a forum.\n\nIn addition, according to my personal experience,you may have more chance to win 4-1-2-1-2 by use the formation of 4-3-1-2. After trying loads of formations i ended up with 4312. In the first moment it feels a bit narrow but after a few games i realized that this narrow play style gives me a very good defense. You have 3 cm which can defend. Its very very hard to break them down because for defending you can use the CM, not CB. You need fast CM outside to play give and go with the cam and to defend the sidelines. Because the center of the field isn\u2019t to break your opponent gets completely desperate after a few time and attacks very wild which gives you the opportunity to counter attack or he tries to get down the wings and crosses in. Because of that you need fast FB and tall CB. With this settings you are very likely to win. So, ind the end, if you stay patient you will make your goals and have a better defense than your opponent.\n\nI summarized two methods to beating 4-1-2-1-2 formation, one is from other gamer, the other one is my own experience, hope you can find an effective and proper method. Players you need can be bought with FIFA coins. They are the key to win other formation. Good luck.\n\nRelated Articles :\n\nMore >\nBuy FIFA 18\nBuy FIFA 18\nBuy BNS Gold\nclick to Buy BNS Gold\nBuy ESO Gold\nclick to Buy ESO Gold",

GTO ask candidates, who want to be a leader. As normal everyone raises their hands just to show quality.\u00a0\n\nISSB Command Task\n\nGTO will select a person, mostly he chose the person whom he thinks did best in the discussion task. It doesn't affect others' selection but it gives you a rare idea about your performance.\n\nTricky Part\n\nGTO starts a formal discussion with the selected candidate (Commander). But, in reality, it is\u00a0 not a formal discussion, this is assessment in which he becomes soo friendly. GTO tries to explore you. Be careful in answering.\n\n\nGroup Testing Officer (GTO) gives you a briefing, told you about the time, inbound, outbound areas marked red, what is outbound for you but inbound for your items, etc. Also item you can use like rope and drum etc.\n\nTips For ISSB Command Task\n\n  \u2022 Take the most valuable position (i.e center).\n  \u2022 You should be the last person to cross ending line. (Only for commander)\n  \u2022 Useful man power. Chose strong boys for lifting\u00a0thing and tall for jumping.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Preferred your team instead of items.\n  \u2022 When GTO unbound areas, lift your teammate and take them toward the ending line, never cross the ending line, because you don't let your team in danger, try it again if there's someone left.\n  \u2022 Don't call any group member by name or Oye etc. Call him with his chest name.\n  \u2022 Remember\n\nYou can't complete the task within the time limit. They just want to check your abilities. Cross the troublemaker guys first. Listen to GTO carefully with full attention. Clear your doubts, if any by questioning.\n\nAfter the task completion you have to put back rope, drum and other things in the same position as they were before the task.\u00a0\n\nShare\u00a0 your plan and ask if there's anything we add to it. Take valuable advices\u00a0otherwise reject them. Participate fully in a group task. Don't be over smart and shown off. GTO will observe everything. If you make any foul don't hesitate to mark it.

It has been developed by Wiimm and Leseratte.\n\nIf you get the error 23904 while connecting to Wiimmfi, then you are using an outdated patch.\nFollow the steps below for the method you\u2019re using to connect to Wiimmfi again.\nSee this page for more details.\n\nDifferent patchers\n\nThere are lots of different methods to connect to Wiimmfi. Choose the one that fits your needs best.\n\nAutomatic patching from the Disc Channel using Priiloader\n\nWhat you need\n\n  \u2022 A Wii with Priiloader 0.9 or later installed\n\nIf you have an older version of Priiloader or don\u2019t have it installed, follow this guide to update\/install it.\n\n\n  1. Hold reset while powering on your Wii (if using a Wii mini, plug in a USB keyboard and press escape).\n  2. Go to System Menu Hacks.\n  3. Make sure the Wiimmfi patch v4 hack is enabled.\n  4. Save settings and exit.\n\nIf you see the hack Wiimmfi patch v2 or Wiimmfi patch v3 instead, then you do not have the latest version of the hacks_hash.ini file.\nDownload it from here and place it in \/apps\/priiloader\/hacks_hash.ini on your SD card or USB drive.\nThen, repeat the previous steps.\n\nHomebrew (Disc) Application\n\nMrBean35000vr (creator of CTGP-R, a Mario Kart Wii content pack) created a Wiimmfi Disc Patcher that allows you to insert a disc and patch the game on-the-fly for Wiimmfi use, though this must be run every time you start the disc.\n\nWhat you need\n\n\n  1. Extract Auto Wiimmfi Patcher to the root of your SD card or USB drive.\n  2. Insert your SD Card into your Wii, and launch Auto Wiimmfi Patcher from the Homebrew Channel.\n  3. Insert your game disc (you can insert it before or after launch, it doesn\u2019t matter).\n  4. Wait for patch to complete, and it\u2019ll begin!\n\nNo-Homebrew (Disc)\n\nThanks to Fullmetal5\u2019s str2hax exploit, which Leseratte was able to adapt for the Wiimmfi patcher, you can run the Wiimmfi patch without having any homebrew on your Wii.\n\nWhat you need\n\n  \u2022 A Wii with an Internet connection\n\n\n  1. Insert your game disc.\n  2. Go into your internet connection settings and set the DNS server of your console to\n  3. Go to the WC24 contract information (third button after clicking on \u201cInternet\u201d in the settings).\n  4. Confirm that you do want to use WC24 and the shop channel\n  5. The Wiimmfi patcher page should show up. If it doesn\u2019t, and you still see the default license agreement, your router might not be compatible with this method.\n  6. Wait for about 1 minute and 30 seconds for the patcher to load\n  7. The game should now start with the Wiimmfi patch included\n\nAutomatic patching using a USB Loader\n\nIf you are already using USB Loader GX, try updating it to the most recent version. Then, there should be a \u201cprivate server\u201d setting (both in the global loader options and in the game options) which you can set to \u201cWiimmfi\u201d to make the USB Loader automatically patch every game you start to work with Wiimmfi.\n\nISO Patching\n\nYou may not want to run a patcher each time you want to play on Wiimmfi, and maybe you already use a USB Loader. As such, ISO Patchers were created, some for specific games.\n\nWhat you need\n\n  \u2022 Your copy of your game (WBFS, ISO, cISO, and other forms that a Wii can use are supported).\n  \u2022 RiiConnect24 Patcher (Windows and Unix)\n  \u2022 Wiimmfi Patcher (cross-platform)\n  \u2022 A USB Loader, cIOS, and a USB to store the game on (you should already have these if you\u2019re using a USB Loader)\n\n\n  1. Extract the patcher of your choice to a folder, and place your copy of the game in it.\n  2. Run the patch script for your OS: usually it will end in .bat for Windows and .sh for Mac\/Linux. If you\u2019re using the RiiConnect24 Patcher, select your device (Wii, vWii, or Dolphin) and choose the patcher for your game.\n  3. Once it\u2019s finished, get the version out of the wiimmfi-images folder (it may be in the folder outside of the patcher - ..\/wiimmfi-images) and copy it back to your USB.\n\nWiiWare Patching\n\nYou can patch WiiWare games in order to play them on Wiimmfi.\n\nWhat you need\n\nIf you want to see how to use the WiiWare Patcher, click here!\n\n\n  1. Extract the .zip of the latest version of WiiWare Patcher, and put your WAD in it.\n  2. Run the patch script for your OS: usually it will end in .bat for Windows and .sh for Mac\/Linux. If you\u2019re using the RiiConnect24 Patcher, select your device (Wii, vWii, or Dolphin) and choose the WiiWare patcher.\n  3. If it completed successfully, install the WAD that was made in wiiware-wads with Wii Mod Lite.\n\nOther stuff\n\nMario Kart Wii Competitions\n\nWiimmfi allows you to participate in Mario Kart Wii competitions again.\n\nWhat you need\n\n  \u2022 An SD card or USB drive\n  \u2022 Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher\n\nInstructions (for Wii)\n\n  1. Extract Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher and put it in the apps folder on your SD Card.\n  2. Insert your SD card or USB drive into the Wii.\n  3. Launch the original Mario Kart Wii game (not Wiimmfi patched).\n  4. Navigate to Settings -> Network Settings (or Nintendo WFC Connection) -> Message Service. If you turned the message service feature on, turn it off and turn it on again.\n  5. Launch Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher.\n  6. The patcher will look for save files for Mario Kart Wii on your storage device in various places, and upload them. This is done in case a missing competition is found in your save file. It will also, of course, patch your Wii for competitions.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Wii U, you will have to run the competitions patcher whenever you want to check for a competition, because WiiConnect24 is not enabled on the Wii U.\n\nDS Games\n\nWiimmfi doesn\u2019t only support Wii games, it supports lots of DS games too. Thanks to an exploit called nds-constraint, you can play DS games online without patching your games.\n\nWhat you need\n\n  \u2022 A Wi-Fi network with WEP or no security\n\nGetting a Wi-Fi network with WEP or no security is the hardest part, because DS games don\u2019t support newer Wi-Fi security types (unless it\u2019s one of the few games that are \u201cDSi Enhanced\u201d and can use your Wi-Fi configuration on your DSi or 3DS, like Pok\u00e9mon Black\/White). However, many routers support creating a guest Wi-Fi connection, or you can make a hotspot on your phone or your computer. There are plenty of resources on the Internet that have information on this, so use your favorite search engine to find them.\n\n\n  1. Go in the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi settings. This can be accessed inside the game you want to play online with.\n  2. Set up a connection.\n  3. Type in as the primary DNS.\n  4. Type in as the secondary DNS (if it gives you problems, try\n  5. Save your connection settings and perform a connection test. If it\u2019s successful, then you\u2019re ready to play.\n\nMario Kart Wii Mods\n\n\nMrBean35000vr and Chadderz have a custom track distribution called CTGP-R that allows you to use a set of custom tracks and has automatic Wiimmfi patching. Go to the ChadSoft website for the download and instructions.\n\nMKW Hack Pack\n\nPhillyG has put together a collection of custom tracks and hacks called MKW Hack Pack, and allows connections to Wiimmfi. To learn how to set it up, go to the wiki page.\n\nWiimms Mario Kart Fun\n\nWiimm and Leseratte make a custom track distribution called \u201cWiimms MKW Fun\u201d, which gets updated about three times a year. It is based on the LE-CODE framework by Leseratte, has Wiimmfi support, and lots of other features. You can find out more about it on its wiki page.\n\nContinue to site navigation\nWe have many other tutorials that you might like.",

        "text":"The Worlds Hardest Game - It Really Is!\n\nWorlds Hardest Game\nPlay: \u00a0Small | Medium | Large\nor or HTML5\/Mobile\n\nThe Worlds Hardest Game is a challenging maze-type game so hard it might drive you crazy. Fight your way through 30 levels of mind boggling obstacles, if you can.\n\nTo begin, click the Small, Medium, or Large link, Very Large button, or HTML5\/Mobile link under the picture at left. This opens the game in a pop-up window.\n\nNote: The HTML5\/Mobile version Impossible Game is an HTML5 game. It does not require the Adobe Flash Player. It is a similar game by a different game developer.\n\nWorlds Hardest Game - Instructions\n\nThis game trains brain speed and reaction time, and I agree that the game is really hard.\n\nIt took me the longest time just to get to level 4. (Only 26 levels to go!) What a great workout for your brain.\n\nThe author of this game says, \"I guarantee you it is harder than any game you have ever played, or ever will play.\"\n\nThat's quite a claim. He might be right though.\n\nWant something that's easier? You might enjoy A Very Simple Game Smilie Want something just as hard? Try World's Hardest Game 2.\n\nThis very hard game is all about concentration and quick response time. The levels of this game are much like mazes.\n\nTo complete the level, you must guide your character (a small red square, actually) from the starting position to the finish position without being touched by the moving obstacles.\n\nHOW TO PLAY. Control your moving square using the Arrow Keys. It's okay to touch the walls in this game.\n\nworlds hardest game\nAvoid the Blue Dots\n\nThe main thing is to not touch anything that is moving. As you go through each level, you must also collect any small yellow coins that are on the screen.\n\nBoth the starting and finish positions are green squares. Your objective is to figure out a way to guide your square through the moving obstacles.\n\nThe best solution or movement pattern for the level is usually not obvious. You will need to study the level carefully first.\n\nEven after you've figured out a way to maneuver through the obstacles, you still need to react quickly. The Worlds Hardest Game is designed to only allow you a small window of time to move your piece to avoid one obstacle and then the next.\n\nThat means you may need to practice this game a few times to get your reaction speed up.\n\nOne nice feature of this puzzle game is that you have an unlimited number of lives.\n\nEach time you are touched by a moving obstacle, thus losing the level, the counter at the top of the game goes up. But you can keep playing.\n\nHowever, if you want a high score on the Worlds Hardest Game, you will need to not die a lot. Your score at the end is a reflection of how many times you have not lost while attempting the various levels.\n\nThis game is definitely a test of patience. It may take you quite a while to figure out and beat a particular level. And if your goal is to complete all 30 levels, be prepared to spend a few hours at it.\n\nPublished: 04\/25\/2011\nLast Updated: 06\/11\/2020\n\n  1. Home\n  2. \u00a0\u203a\n  3.

Its story is set in all-new galaxy aboard an all-new ship. It\u2019s up to everyone that plays the game to create their own Pathfinder and outfit him or her with the best skills and gear for their combat style. Being an RPG, it\u2019s also up to players whether to make an attempt at romancing their crew mates. When exploration gets boring, a Mass Effect Andromeda romance is always an option.\n\nThe Mass Effect Andromeda romance system is based on previous romance systems in games released by Bioware. Andromeda is designed to be a mostly realistic a space travel simulation. You are hundreds of years away from the Milky Way Galaxy. You\u2019ll spend a lot of time exploring worlds that humans and the Andromeda Initiative could barely investigate before. The Helios Cluster is teeming with dangers that could finish off settlers in no time. When you\u2019re not trying desperately to manage all that, you have some down time. It\u2019s during that downtime that you can get to know the crew of the Tempest. Using the romance system, you can even fall in love with some of them.\n\nUse this guide to navigate the Mass Effect Andromeda romance system.\n\nRead: 7 Mass Effect Andromeda Problems & Fixes\n\nThere are some intricacies involved that anyone new to the Mass Effect franchise might not know about. Even those that have played Bioware\u2019s most recent RPG, Dragon Age Inquisition, could find themselves a little confused. Here\u2019s a guide to Mass Effect Andromeda romance.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: The Basics\n\nBefore you\u2019re allowed to begin Andromeda\u2019s story you\u2019re asked to make a very important decision. The game tells the story of the Ryder family. The older Ryder is a seasoned warrior and in charge of ensuring that the species on the Ark Hyperion starship stay alive. The younger Ryder family members are twins. You choose which of them you want to be and begin the game. That choice determines who you can pair off with.\n\nTo romance a member of the Tempest crew, you simply find them on board the ship. The things that they say and your replies determine how successful you are at romancing them. In the message wheel, a heart always signifies romance.\n\nEach path to romance is different for each member of the crew. Some crew members are bisexual and can be romanced by either Ryder twin. To be clear, there are members outside of the crew that can be romanced as well. Others are only susceptible to the advances of the twin opposite their gender.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to go out of your way to talk to the crew member you\u2019re trying to romance. Reading all the emails that they send you is important too. Finally, you\u2019ll want to complete that character\u2019s loyalty mission. The Mass Effect Andromeda romance system has both exclusive relationships and open relationships.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Female Ryder Romances\n\nCasual RelationshipsClosed Relationships\nReyes VidalJaal\nReyes Vidal\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Male Ryder Parings\n\nCasual RelationshipsClosed Relationships\nAvela KjarGil\nReyes VidalVetra\nKeriReyes Vidal\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Cora\n\nCora can only be romanced by a male Ryder character. You\u2019ll need to talk to her many times and complete a multi-part loyalty mission. She\u2019s in the Tempest\u2019s Tech Lab.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Gil\n\nGil can only be romanced by male Ryder. He can be found on the Tempest in engineering. Being casually romantically involved with Gil doesn\u2019t keep you from a full romance with the character later.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Avela Kjar\n\nAvela Kjar isn\u2019t a member of the Tempest crew. Players can start a casual relationship with her on the planet on Aya as she gives them quests.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Liam\n\nLiam needs to be flirted with by the female Ryder at every opportunity in the Cargo Bay on the Tempest. Romancing Liam won\u2019t keep you from romancing other characters until after completing his loyalty mission, according to VG247.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Jaal\n\nThe female rider will have to flirt constantly with Jaal to get him interested. He\u2019s near the research station on the Tempest. You\u2019ll need to have completed his loyalty mission to make the relationship stick.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Suvi\n\nSuvi sits on the bridge and is open to a closed relationship. Players need only keep flirting with her. Look for her email to confirm that she\u2019s attracted to you too.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Peebee\n\nYou\u2019ll need to flirt and complete some personal missions before Peebee becomes a full romance option. She\u2019s available in the cargo bay and the escape pod near the bridge. You can decide to go with a casual relationship with Peebee or turn her down for a full romance later on. You\u2019ll have to choose one or the other because you can\u2019t have both.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Vetra\n\nEvery time that you encounter Vetra you\u2019ll need to attempt to flirt with her. Once recruited, she\u2019s in a storage room near the Tempest\u2019s Caro Bay. This romance is locked behind the main plot, meaning you\u2019ll need to advance the story and complete her loyalty mission. Vetra only offers a full relationship.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Keri\n\nKeri is a journalist that\u2019ll send along emails whenever she has an interview slot to fill. Players that attempt to flirt with her after the interviews stand a chance of scoring a one-off relationship.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda Romance Guide: Reyes Vidal\n\nReyes Vidal offers both a casual and full relationship but can be hard to find. The only way to meet the character is to refuse a deal with Sloane Kelly. You\u2019ll need to flirt with him at every opportunity. He\u2019s both a full romance and casual romance option.\n\nRead: Mass Effect Andromeda Tips to Level Up Faster\n\nGood luck in Mass Effect Andromeda. As the game is pretty big, expect more characters and details to surface as gamers get their hands on the new RPG and start experimenting.\n\nMass Effect Andromeda: 6 Amazing Reasons to Get Excited\n\nAndromeda Initiative\n\n\u00a01 \/ 6\n Andromeda Initiative\n\nHumans and other species arrive in the Andromeda galaxy thanks to the Andromeda Initiative. Launched during the events of the early Mass Effect titles, the Andromeda Initiative exists to create a place in the Andromeda galaxy for humans and other species to call home. Why this move was necessary is straight forward. Humans and other species in the Milky Way galaxy came dangerously close to inhalation. Creating a second civilization farther away makes it more likely that the species that came under threat will survive if they should ever face such a crisis again.\n\nAndromeda players will go from planet to planet exploring completely new worlds. Like the real Andromeda galaxy, this in-game version will play host to a stunning array of planets and planetary environments. Some of these planets will be outright hostile to humans. Perhaps so will the species that already reside on them.\n\n\u00a01 \/ 6\n\nPaste your parsed code here.\nPaste your parsed code here.\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\ngoogle analytics\n\nContact Form\n\n\nEmail *\n\nMessage *\n\nLast Hour Hits\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Tech Visions",
