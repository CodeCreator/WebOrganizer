        "text":"Creating a character\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Role\n\nWe wont be using the roles as presented in the Leverage RPG, but we will be using them for inspiration. Each role represents a fundamental set of skills useful as part of a group in the Cyberpunk setting. Not everyone is going to have these skills, but a useful member of a crew of what-have-you all have these roles represented.\n\nGrifter \u2013 The Grifters deal in trust. They get it and then exploit it against the people who gave it to them. They excel in social situations. Lying, acting, cheating or distracting the opposition so that the others can do their jobs.\n\nAssociated Skills: Artistry, Influence, Knowledge, Performance\n\nHacker \u2013 The Hacker deals in information. They gain it for the crew, deny it to the opposition, or manipulate it to take down a mark. They hack into network systems, creating fake IDs, and obtaining technology are all things that usually fall under the hacker\u2019s purview.\n\nAssociated Skills: Drive, Mechanic, Science, Tech\n\nHitter \u2013 The Hitter deals in force. They engage in direct combat to put force on bad guys, getting them out of the way. Engaging in combat, sizing up a tactical situation and intimidating a guard are all things a Hitter excels at.\n\nAssociated Skills: Athletics, Guns, Melee Weapons, Survival, Unarmed Combat\n\nMastermind \u2013 The Mastermind deals in plans. They formulate the plan at the start of the job and coordinate the team\u2019s efforts to stay on track. They deal with unexpected events that threaten to blow every plan. Finding out where the target hid the information you\u2019re looking for, noticing the unexpected guard entering the front door, or bribing the government police are all jobs for the Mastermind.\n\nAssociated Skills: Discipline, Influence, Knowledge, Perception, Pilot\n\nThief \u2013 Thieves deal in access. They get themselves and the Crew access by breaking through security systems, and they use access to steal items or information. Sneak past a guard, picking a marks pocket for an access card, or using a stealth suit to repel into a server room are all jobs for the Thief.\n\nAssociated Skills: Covert, Discipline, Mechanic, Tech\n\nThere should be some overlap. When picking your skills you should select primary skills for the skills associated with your role, and then think of a secondary roll that you\u2019d like to fill and cover that as well.\n\nStep 2: Attributes\n\nThere are six attributes to choose from, rated from poor (d2) and above. As starting PCs your attributes will be limited to d12. More advanced PCs can have d12 + d2, or d12 +d4.\n\nAgility covers things like quickness, balance, and hand-eye work. A high Agility lets you shoot first and ask questions later. A low score means you might not be able to get that gun out of your holster in time to worry much about shooting.\n\nStrength is brawn, and how toned it might be. A high Strength lets you kick down doors, throw solid punches, or bench press Smart Cars. A low Strength makes carrying a suitcase up a flight of stairs trouble.\n\nVitality measures toughness and health. A character with high Vitality is hard to take down, and even harder to keep down; he can drink all night, work all day, and take hits that would lay flat an ordinary guy. Low Vitality types wanna take plenty of Vitamin-C and best not enter any drinking contests.\n\nAlertness lets you observe and understand what\u2019s going on around you. A high Alertness catches a whisper on a holo recording, knows when someone\u2019s lying to your face, or spots the crazed look in a drug addicts eyes. The flip side means you don\u2019t see the gangster before he puts a bullet in your head.\n\nIntelligence is thinking, reasoning, and remembering. A high Intelligence makes you bright, inventive, and capable of sorting out complex information. Otherwise, jigsaw puzzles are stumpers and forget using the internet.\n\nWillpower combines grit and force of personality. If you\u2019ve got a high score in Willpower, resisting intimidation, torture, and hardship might actually happen. You also might convince someone to do what you want through sheer charisma. A low Willpower makes you more susceptible to stronger personalities and addiction.\n\nCharacters will receive 42 attribute points. Each die costs a number of points equal to it\u2019s rating. So a d2 costs 2 points, and a d12 costs 12 points.\n\nNote that attributes need to be at least a d4 and no higher than a d12. As noted above, lower attributes are possible but you wont live long with them.\n\nStep 3: Derived Attributes\n\nThese are based on the above attributes.\n\nInitiative: Record your Agility + Alertness. For Example d6 + d6.\n\nLife Points: Record the total of the maximum of your Vitality + Willpower. For example with a d6 in each you\u2019d have 12 life points.\n\nEndurance: Record Willpower + Vitality traits. For Example: d6 + d6\n\nStep 4: Skills\n\n62 skill points, chosen from the Supernatural Book.\n\nStep 5: Traits\n\nBy default, you have zero points to spend in traits. This can be countered by taking Complications, which provide points that can be spent in Assets.\n\nAsset\/ Value\n\nAllure d2\u2013d6\nAlternate Identity d2\u2013d6\nAmbidextrous d2\nBorn Behind the Wheel d2\u2013d6\nBrawler d2\u2013d6\nCarries a Badge d2\u2013d6\nContacts d2\u2013d6\nCool Under Fire d2\u2013d6\nDevoted d6\nFaith d2\u2013d6\nFast on Your Feet d2\/d6\nFocused Hunter d2\u2013d6\nFormidable Presence d2\u2013d6\nGear Head d2\u2013d6\nGood-Natured d2\u2013d6\nHardy Constitution d2\u2013d6\nHigher Education d2\u2013d6\nIn Plain Sight d2\u2013d6\nIntuitive Leaps d4\/d8\nLight Sleeper d4\nLow Profile d2\/d6\nLucky d4\/d8\/d12\nNatural Athlete d2\u2013d6\nNatural Linguist d2\u2013d6\nPhotographic Memory d4\/d8\nReputation d2\u2013d6\nSafe House d4\/d8\nSensitive d2\u2013d6\nSharp Sense d2\u2013d6\nSplit Second Timing d2\u2013d6\nSure Footed d2\u2013d6\nTalented d2\u2013d6\nTech Expert d2\u2013d6\nTough d4\/d8\nTwo-Handed Fighting d4\nUnbreakable Will d2\u2013d6\nUncommon Knowledge d2\u2013d6\nWealthy d4\/d8\n\nSpecial Assets:\n\nThese are Cyberpunk assets I created. Assets marked with a (CB) require a neural control chip or a cyberbrain implant. Assets marked with a (OP) only require an optical implant.\n\nArmored Sub-dermal Mesh: d4-d8 \u2013 Receive half the trait rating as innate armor that applies against any attack except for energy based attacks.\nOmni Pheromone Amplification Module: d4-d6 \u2013 Receive a die bonus equal to asset rating on social interaction rolls. (CB)\nOmni Reaction Amplification Network: d4-d12 \u2013 Receive die bonus equal to half of asset rating added to any alertness based roll. (CB)\nTitan Enhanced Muscular Mesh: d4-d12 \u2013 Receive die bonus equal to half of asset rating added to any strength based roll. (OP)\nTitan Advanced Personal Assistant Module: d4-d8 \u2013 Receive die bonus equal to half of asset rating added to any Intelligence based roll. (CB)\n\nGlenHealth Emergency Resuscitation System: d12+d4 \u2013 d12+d8 \u2013 (CB) . Glencore Health cornered the market on emergency care prosthetics. The GH ERS is a series of artificial organs, nano-machines and drug reserves that assists a severely injured or dying patient. The ERS provides several advantages.\n\nAt a d12+d4: ERS grants it\u2019s asset dice as a bonus on rolls to stay conscious and resist the effects of drugs or poisons.\n\nAt a d12+d6: ERS grants an additional 6 life points.\n\nAt a d12+d8: ERS grants an additional d8 on rolls to resist dying and a dying character can spend a plot point to immediately stabilize.\n\nGT Directed Inferface Pads: d8 \u2013 (CB) These small fingerpad implants allow a cyberbrain access to a closed loop system when touched against a networked device. Operating via fiber-light or proximity electromagnetic injection, these hacker-favored devices are highly sought after and have very few practical or legal uses. Your trait die is added when you are attempting to gain access to a digital device or network to which you can touch.\n\niLink: d6-d8 \u2013 The iLink is the basic model optical implant that provides internet and communication access via an optical only interface. It also provides a HUD for basic implant control and maintenance. An iLink provides a d2 when accessing the net to search for information, and can be used to record anything the user sees and hears.\n\nBy spending a plot point, the iLink can be shielded from hacking for the scene, unless the hacker also uses expends a plot point. A plot point can be spent to generate information based scene assets at a maximum trait die of the iLink\u2019s rating.\n\nAn iLink requires a minimum of a d4 Neuropozyne dependency.\n\nOmni Cyberbrain: d10-d12+8 \u2013 An advanced form of the iLink, a full integration of a biochip with the cerebral cortex. Like the iLink, the Cyberbrain provides access to the net as well as the capability to record and structure data. It also allows for easy multi-processing of data. A person with a cyberbrain can perform actions in the net simultaneously with actions in the meatspace, without penalties. It also is required for all advanced implants. When accessing the net, add the asset rating to any rolls to search. Alternatively, the full asset rating can be used by itself while the user is making other actions in the physical reality.\n\nBy spending a plot point, a cyberbrain can be enhanced by one die step for the scene. This causes an immediate Neuropozyne withdrawal.\n\nA cyberbrain requires a minimum of a d8 Neuropozyne dependency.\n\nTitan X93 Active-Camo Suit: d10-d12+d12 \u2013 The titan X93 is a cutting edge active camo suit that incorporates many technologies into it\u2019s design. The plans for the X93 were stolen a year ago, and since that time many models have become available through back channels and the black market, usually with custom modifications by the black market designers.\n\nAny rating higher than d12 requires a (CB) Cyberbrain implant to take advantage of the advanced features.\n\nd10 \u2013 The basic model adds a d10 to all stealth rolls. This is active camouflage that works against sight only. Appears like a shimmering translucent body when active.\n\nd12 \u2013 As above, but provides a d12 to stealth. This also allows it\u2019s stealth to function against heat sensors and against multispectrum cameras.\n\nd12+4 \u2013 As above, ... (truncated)",

        "text":"Welcome to the RiddleVerse Blog\n\nThe world's first cash prize riddle solving contests. Multiple contests everyday.\n\nHow to Use Your Trivia Skills to Win Cash in The RiddleVerse\n\nWe all know that guy. You may be the guy. We all\u00a0want to be him. The one who never misses Trivia Thursday at your local watering hole because he simply dominates, effortlessly. No cheating, either. He\u2019s not the one Googling under the table, calling lifelines, or asking Siri (she\u2019s useless anyway). A nerdy adrenaline junkie that gets a rush when he nails the correct answer from the deep recesses of his brain. The natural high is free and so are the winners\u2019 beer buckets. Once the moderator calls out his slightly raunchy, but always clever, team name you know it\u2019s on.\n\nThe Trivia Master is one to be admired. A savant with a unique set of skills to tap into his brain with precision. While the rest of us have the answer on the tip of our tongues, beer bucket boy over here has already written down the correct answer. He\u2019s not necessarily more intelligent than you or me (multiple intelligences are a thing), but he just has specific mental skills and abilities that make trivia his bag.\n\n\u201cWhat are they and how do I hone such skills,\u201d you ask?\n\nThese mental faculties may be the key to slaying the trivia world. Use these techniques to help tap into your own world domination in the RiddleVerse. It could be the difference between you and $15K per day. That\u2019s a lot of beer buckets.\n\nLink Your Knowns With Your Unknowns\n\nYou know the feeling when something is on the tip of your tongue? One way to recall information is to link what you do know with what you\u2019re trying to remember. Link each fact to more than one other fact, feeling, smell, sound, location, or story. Finding these connections can lead you to solving the trivia question or riddle. For instance, at trivia night, they play a song and the question asks the release year. Envision where you were when the song came out. Jamming out in your car when you just turned 16? Feel the breeze? Do the math and you have your answer.\n\nIn other words, what information do you know that can lead you down a path to this answer?\n\nPractice with this: Pythagoras Memory Technique \u2013 can help develop quicker recall speed and give you practice creating linkages.\n\nForget What You Think You Know\n\n\u201cThe most characteristic feature of stupidity is not the ability to think, or lack of knowledge, but the certainty with which ideas are held.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Edward deBono, established the term \u201clateral thinking.\u201d\n\nTrivia and riddle masters alike know to never trust a clue. Honing your ability to see the possibilities of a clue from all angles will help you get to the correct answer faster. What you see isn\u2019t always what you get, and the real pros understand how to use the question itself in order to find the answer. This is called lateral thinking.\n\n\u201cLateral Thinking is a deliberate, systematic creative-thinking process that deliberately looks at challenges from completely different angles. By introducing specific, unconventional thinking techniques, lateral thinking enables thinkers to find novel solutions that would otherwise remain uncovered. Lateral thinking focuses on what could be rather than what is possible.\u201d Source.\n\nCrossword puzzle clues can often be a great lateral thinking exercise.

        "text":"Team Fortress 2\n\nTeam Fortress 2\n\n68 ratings\nF2P Vs P2P\nBy snailsalad\nWe uncover the truth in the longest argument in tf2 history.\n\nWhat's this difference between a F2P vs a P2P. A F2P is someone who got the game after the Uber update and a P2P is someone who payed for the game. Considering F2P can describe millions of people, let's change the topic from F2P vs P2P, to the Freemium vs the Premium.\n\nWhat's the purpose of this guide? To answer the argument once and for all about the Freemium players vs the Premium players. Now if your one of those people who don't like to read alot. Feel free to skip to the Conclusion section where everything will be wrapped up there. So now let's begin.\nFreemium's and Premium's: What are they?\nSo what is a Freemium and What is a Premium?\n\nFreemium=A player that has not purchased any item from the MannCo. store.\n\nPremium=A player that has purchased an Item from the MannCo. Store and\/or purchased the game before it went free to play and was given Premium by default.\n\nSo now that you know the difference (although most of you probably knew the difference before), We will now hear both sides arguments and therefore determine our conclusion. So let's start with the Freemium's arguments first.\nFreemium: Hat's don't make you better at the game.\nThis statement is partially incorrect and let me tell you why. Yes, a hat does not improve your skill. Wearing an unusual does not make you the best player and wearing a Gibus does not make you the worst. But then why is it partially incorrect then? That's because there are different advantages to wearing hats. For example.\n\nConsidering the fact that the tf2 community judges people based on their hats, depending on which hat you wear could be the difference between life and death. Ex. A player wearing a gibus hat might be underestimated and targeted by the other team as an easy target, meaning more enemies coming after you to try and get some easy kills, where as a player wearing an unusual hat might be overestimated by the team and have fewer people try and attack. Alternatively, this can be the other way around. Some people might ignore a player with a gibus thinking they might not be much of a threat and focus down an unusual wearing player instead. But what about Mvm? It's a lot more one-sided in Mvm. Considering a player wearing a gibus will almost immediately be kicked (I've seen it happen) unless they can prove their skill. So ultimately, wearing different hats can have different advantages depending on the situation. So no they don't make you better, but they can still help you.\nFreemium: I know this one Freemium and he's better than most Premiums\nWe have all heard this one \"I'm a free to play but I'm really good at the game\". Yes, and there's no reason you wouldn't be. This one can be summed up rather quickly.\n\nBeing Freemium does not mean you're a bad player, it just means you didn't pay for the game. That's it. You can be Freemium and still be a good player. And you can also be Premium and be a bad player. Whether or not you paid for the game or not will not determine your skill. Moving on.\nThe Gibus\n\nAh yes, the gibus'. The hat most commonly associated with the Freemium. But why? Let's start with the ghostly gibus. It's an easy to obtain hat, simply dominate another player wearing any gibus. I can see why it's considered a Freemium hat because it's easy to get. Therefore meaning any most players wearing any of the gibus's will be accused as a Freemium and doubted. But what about the other gibus's. Leaving the 2009 ghastlierest gibus out of this. The ghastly gibus was given out around Halloween 2011 and to anyone who visited a secret web page. And the Ghastlier Gibus was given out around Halloween 2010.\n\nSo, the ghostly gibus, it's easy to obtain unlike the other gibus's, So anyone wearing it doesn't deserve as much respect as someone wearing the other gibus's right? Wrong. Wearing the ghostly gibus just means you like that hat. Same with the pyrovision goggles for people who like the look of pyroland.Because they like the hat does not mean they should be accused of being a bad player.\nPremium: Premium's have more dedication than Freemiums.\n(I know this image has nothing to do with dedication but I just like the look of it.)\n\nIt's true, as much as I hate to admit it. Premium players do have more dedication than Freemium players. Since Premium's have put money into the game they want to get the most for their dollar, whereas Freemium's only do it for fun. Like everyone else, we play Team Fortress 2 to have a good time, but Premium's are dedicated to getting the most playtime for that 140$ they just spent on the new update. However, this is not true that Premium's have more dedication than all Freemium's. There are some dedicated Freemum's who play Team Fortress 2 a lot. So yes. Most Premium's have more dedication than Most Freemium's.\nPremium: Freemium's don't have any skill\nSome. We've all seen the Gmod skits of the typical F2P and they're doing all these dumb things. In reality, it's not true. Freemium's aren't bad. And you saying they're bad is not helping them to improve. It's not like you were some all-powerful god of Team Fortress 2 when you started out. Everyone started out bad, even those Primeval warriors, the beta testers, were not always good. So why not help the new generation to improve. Remember that picture back in the Freemium section of the Premium picking on the Freemium. You know how much that happens, a lot. And it needs to stop. There's no benefit to picking on people that are worse than you. You know that saying \"Pick on someone your own size\" Well in tf2 it seems to be \"Pick on somebody smaller than you\" And it should stop.\n\nBut how? How can it stop? Simple. Help them. Volunteer as a coach. If you see somebody who's bad at the game, take a minute and explain what they're doing wrong and how to improve instead of trying to boost your ego every time you see one. Heck, when I bought Tf2 back in 2008, I wasn't no god then, and I'm still no god now. So please, just stop picking on the Freemium's and maybe, just maybe, they'll actually get better, and they don't even need to be Premium to do so.\n\nHowever, there are 2 exceptions in the section. The Newb and the Noob. The Newb player just got the game and has no idea what to do. They might beg for free hats and ask players to help them get an achievement. But, everyone started off at this stage. Well, everyone except those guys with the Primeval Warrior badge. Then there's the Noob. This guy only wants attention. He'll specifically try to be annoying and not respond to what other players say. They are new, and they will not get better. They don't care about tf2. How do I know if I'm dealing with a Noob? If the other person is clearly being obnoxious and not listening then the best thing to do is to ignore him and not give him the attention.\nHat's and the MannCo. Store\n\nSo what bonus do regular hats have to do with anything. if only gibus's and unusuals have any sort of bonus then what about the hats on the MannCo Store? It doesn't matter. These items are nice, and If you're wearing them, it means you like it. Simple as that. So what about the MannCo. Store? If you buy something from it then that means you wanted it. So those \"In between\" hats are just because of personal preference? Yup. Hat's are nothing but a personal preference. It's that simple. But what about those promo cosmetics, like Bill's hat's and Earbud's? While most people have them just to show them off, I would assume they wouldn't be showing the item off if they didn't like it. It's that simple. If you like something, buy it, but nobody is forcing anybody to buy anything. Hats only prove your dedication, not your skill.\nNone of this matters and nobody should even care. Just play the game and stop caring about everyone else. It doesn't matter what you have and it doesn't matter your skill. Just play for fun it's that easy.\n\nThank you for reading this guide.
