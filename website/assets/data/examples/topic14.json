        "text":"5 Tips to Consider When Moving Your Family For Your Job\n\nIs relocation for a new job worth it for your family? Here are a few ways to evaluate if moving your family for your job is the right decision.\n\n1. Check-In with Your Family\n\nThe most significant discussion you can have with your family is making sure everyone is on board with this decision. Sitting your family down and openly discussing the positives and negatives of your relocation is a helpful way to answer any questions or ease any fears they might have about the move. Be prepared for your children to have uneasiness about this life change, as they most likely haven\u2019t had to deal with as much unfamiliarity in their lives as you have. Remember to be patient as it may take some time for them to fully grasp what it will mean to relocate their lives. It can also be helpful to come prepared with a list of a few positive aspects of your new city. Is there an amusement park down the street? Will you be living next to the beach? Are there any interesting museums or indoor attractions that they might enjoy? All of these things can help them better envision the move.\n\n2. Make Sure the Timing is Right\n\nWhile it may be an ideal time for you to make a career transition, make sure that the timing will work for your spouse as well. If your spouse recently started a new position, is finishing schooling or is in the middle of a big life change, it may not be the best time to relocate. If your spouse is willing to move, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your job is able to support both you and your spouse until he or she can find a new opportunity in the new city. If you have children, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you\u2019re not uprooting them at a crucial time in their schooling. For example, it\u2019s always easier to move in the summer before school starts so that they can have a fresh start at a new school in the fall versus in the middle of the school year. You\u2019ll also want to do your homework and make sure that the schools in your new area are up to par with your current city. After all, you wouldn\u2019t want to move across the country only to realize that the school system is below average.\n\n3. Calculate the Cost of Living\n\nRelocating is an expensive undertaking, and a new city means different pricing on everyday staples like groceries, housing, electric etc. Before you accept a new position, you\u2019ll want to realistically calculate the cost of living in your new city. Take a look at apartments or houses in the area and make sure that they are within your budget. If your new salary doesn\u2019t cover the cost of living in your new area, you may want to reconsider your relocation.\n\n4. Don\u2019t Forget About Moving Expenses\n\nOftentimes a make or break aspect of relocating is whether or not your new company will cover your moving expenses. Atlas Van Lines reports that a single person moving from a one-bedroom, Los Angeles apartment to one in Chicago could spend approximately $2,240 for professional movers to load and unload a single mobile storage container. This cost can triple when you\u2019re talking about moving an entire 5-person household. If your company won\u2019t cover your expenses, experts suggest doing a cost-benefit analysis to weigh the professional opportunities as well as the financial sacrifices of your move.\n\n5. Weigh What the Day-To-Day Will Be Like\n\nAfter you\u2019ve checked in with your family, weighed the cost of living and factored in moving expenses, the last thing you\u2019ll want to consider is what your day-to-day will be like. Each city offers something a bit different and while you may love living in New York City, you may not enjoy Los Angeles or vice versa. You\u2019ll want to weigh factors like weather, commuting times, transportation options such as public transportation versus driving, and extracurricular opportunities in your new city. If you\u2019re really involved in a church group or an artist community in your current city, you\u2019ll want to make sure that you can find something comparable in your new city. You\u2019ll also want to make sure that if you are relocating away from friends and family that you and your own family will be okay during the transition. It takes awhile to make new friends and build relationships and if you\u2019re not prepared for it, it can make the move a lot harder.",

        "text":"Wednesday, January 31, 2007\n\nI am cleaning up\n\nNo it is not spring time, it is the height of summer, hot and very, very humid but I am cleaning out this house!\n\nThis year with Charlotte at school everyday and Chanel at daycare two days a week I am vowing to be organised! Last year some time Patty listed her cleaning schedule with daily, weekly, monthly, six monthly and even annual chores. I kept it and although most of her routine is not relevant to me I will adapt it and change accordingly. One thing I remember her saying was if you are in a mess, give yourself the time to de-clutter and have bags for\n\n\nWell I haven't come across too much to put away. Gradually as Charlotte has grown out of clothes and toys they have gone to Chanel. But Chanel is growing out of things now. The baby toys are gone, the hand knitted baby clothes are gone (except for what my mum, nan and mother-in-law knitted). This is the tropics after all.\n\nAll my odd glassware that is not longer a set is gone, we have acquired far more along the way. Unused wedding presents, we will celebrate our 8 anniversary this May.\n\nThe girls bedrooms are looking lovely and tidy. I know it won't stay like that but everything has a home that it can go back to.\nFor now Chanel is not sleeping all the time in her bed so we still need the cot as well. When that goes she will have a lot more room. I have fairy lights for her room but she is still at the pull it apart stage so hopefully soon we can make everything prettier.\n\nI am particularly happy with my hallway cupboard, there is now some empty space in there.\n\nWell if you lasted this long, well done. Not the most interesting post.\n\nThanks for all the well wishes on Charlotte's first day of school. She had a ball. She came home hot, sweaty and grinning from ear to ear! She hardly ate any lunch, so finished it at home for afternoon tea. When I asked her why she didn't eat much she said \"Mummy I was too busy!\"\n\n\nTuesday, January 30, 2007\n\nLook out Grade One, here she comes!!\n\nToday is Charlotte's first day in Grade One. She looked so cute in her uniform. She went to preschool last year at the same school, so she already has some friends in her class and met her teacher last year but this year she is wearing the uniform and will attend five days a week.\n\nShe found her desk and started colouring in when we arrived. I stayed for awhile but she was happy so Chanel and I kissed her goodbye, she gave us a wave and we left her to it.\n\nI can't wait until 3pm this afternoon to hear all about her day.\n\nSunday, January 28, 2007\n\nComfort Cushion\n\nRemember that beautiful cushion cover that I got from Christina with all the stitching, well I am not so clever but here is the one I made. Modelled beautifully by Miss Charlotte wearing her Rhapsody Fairy Dress over her pyjamas - very stylish. Miss Charlotte starts Grade One in two more sleeps!!!!\n\nI am happy with my effort on the cushion cover. Look out Bonijo it is headed your way! Here is the back view!\n\n\nFriday, January 26, 2007\n\nAustralia Day\n\nToday is Australia Day. It is a public holiday. We are off to party this afternoon around at some friends house. Should be lots of fun.\nAustralia Day is the anniversary of the day the First Fleet landed in Sydney in 1788. For anyone interested here is some more info for you!\nWherever you are, have a great day!\n\nMonday, January 22, 2007\n\nA January Finish\n\nThis Panel has been quilted since before Christmas but now the binding is done too. I used a verigated thread for the quilting and I like how it has turned out. The backing is flannel pieced from two bunny rugs.\nIt is going to an aides orphan in South Africa\n\n\nSunday, January 21, 2007\n\nNew Goals.....\n\nNow I know I am early but I am starting to set goals for February..........\nBind Russ Quilt\nFinish Loretta's Sudoku\nMake Loretta' 40th Birthday Wall hanging\nStart BOM (first installment hasn't arrived yet!)\nJanuary has been a crazy month here, all I really want to accomplish this late is\nAnnie's dilly bag for her checker pieces\nBind Giraffe panel and send off.\nAll is do-able, now I need to get moving!\n(Just for something pretty to look at, here is a recent sunset on the lake)\n\nThursday, January 18, 2007\n\nHow special is this!\n\nI am very lucky to be involved with a small group of ladies that encourage, support and inspire each other. I have never met any of them in person, we 'met' through an online quilting group and formed our own little \"sub-section\".\n\nWe are currently running a comfort cushion swap. We were each given another in the group to make a cushion for, so when things aren't great you can hug or punch your cushion, whatever makes you feel better.\n\nMine arrived to day. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHRISTINA! The verse is lovely, but my favourite bit is the \"Notes for Jodie\" pocket bottom right.\n\nThat make three posts in one day, think I need to go do something more productive!\n\n\nToday's Photo Shoot\n\nLoretta phoned last night and said when she visited at Christmas she went home without any up to date photos of the girls.\n\nTo rectify this we got snapping this morning.\n\n\nApricot Jam\n\nPurists should look away now!!\nI made these little jars of jam yesterday using the Microwave. It was so quick and easy. It took a maximum of half an hour and no mess.\n\nAll you need is:\n500 g apricots\n\u00bc cup lemon juice\nMicrowave for about 6 minutes in a large container with the lid on.\nAdd 2 cups sugar, stir. Microwave for about 16 minutes with the lid off.\n\nThat's it!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI want to thank a lady named Helen who provided the recipe on an online quilting group I belong to. She says it also works with nectarines.\n\n\nMonday, January 15, 2007\n\nFound 'Um\n\nRemember before christmas when I couldn't find the checker pieces? Well I found them! They were in the bag I thought they were in but the bag wasn't were it was supposed to be! Can't blame that on anyone but myself. DH will get his back and still another set left!\n\n\nTuesday, January 09, 2007\n\nOur Tess is Home\n\nTess didn't get home last night, the vet kept her again to be sure, but we were able to pick her up at lunch time today.\n\nShe is far from well. Still sluggish on her back legs, I had to help her into the car and then when she went outside to inspect her turf she tried to break into a run and couldn't.\n\nRob the vet said he was very worried about her Sunday night, he stayed with her for a long while and then went back in later to check on her.\n\nWe are to keep her quiet for a few weeks as her heart will take the longest to recover, watch her bowel movements and eating to ensure there is no paraylsis and give her soft food to eat. Have some premium mince out defrosting right now.\n\nHer bark is still a squeak but like everything else it will improve in time.\n\nI have asked the girls to be quiet as Tess needs her rest so they sat beside her making sure she was resting.\nThis is an old photo of her as a puppy with Russ's work boots, she was so cute (she is seven and a half now, still cute, just bigger!). At the moment she is lying in the entry way asleep and I can't take a photo with out disturbing her. There is current photo of her on my Mapleton post.\n\nMonday, January 08, 2007\n\n\nWe took the girls and Tess the wonderdog on their first camping trip last week. We went to Flannagan's Reserve out west from here. We went there 'cause dogs are allowed if you keep them on a leash.\n\nIt was a full moon while we were out there and the silly birds got confused and were noisy throughout the night thinking the sun had risen when it fact it was the moon! We slept through their noise the second night.\n\nWe set up our site looking out towards the adjoining property. There were cows in there and kangaroos early in the morning.\n\nThe other side of the reserve was on the Logan River. We kept away from there just to be safer with the girls. It was very pretty though.\nChanel fought having an afternoon sleep and literally nose-dived into her bunk!\n\nThe down side when we got home was that our Tess had picked up a paralysis tick. We rushed her to the vet late yesterday and she is in Doggy hospital now. Hopefully she will be home tomorrow.\n\n\nTuesday, January 02, 2007\n\n\nAfter a crazy christmas time we took off for a few nights up to my SIL's little cottage at Mapleton, in the Sunshine Coast Hinterland. Gaye works in Japan, teaching English at University level, so she only gets back a few times a year.\n\nWe had a very relaxing time, walked a little, read a little, slept a little. The girls had a great time. We took some colouring in, two games - Junior Monopoly and Trouble and their baby dolls. No fighting and no \"I'm bored\".\nMapleton is on the Blackall Range and the soil is very red. Some lily ponds and beautiful gardens .......\n\nThe other great thing about going up there, is we can take our four legged family member with us. This is Tess the Wonderdog relaxing on Aunty Gaye's front deck ......\n\n\nOur Christmas\n\nA bit behind I know, just catching up. I hope everyone had a wonderful festive season and that 2007 is good to us all.\n\nOur festivities started on the Saturday evening before Christmas with a BBQ with friends. No I still haven't found the last packet of checker pieces but my DH came to the rescue and offered me the pieces from his Checker set that I made for his birthday last May! Bless him. I still need to make a little dilly bag for everything to go in, but Annie loved it and doesn't know she was supposed to have a bag as well. Here she is with my two playing in the Hammock....\nSunday was cooking and preparing for Christmas Day. Then to finish DH wall hanging. I had the idea of handprints for a long time and didn't really know what to do, so ended up cutting them out of felt and sewing onto another 9 patch snowball quilt. I thought it would only take me a couple of hours to sew them on. Wrong!! I finially finished at 3am on Christmas morning. It was worth the effort, I am happy with the result and DH has agreed to hang it in the entry of our house.\nWe had a lovely lunch with family and... (truncated)",

        "text":"Pigeons are merely a curiosity for some but can be a real nuisance in large numbers. Pigeon droppings are corrosive and can cause major damage to buildings.\n\nWhat is more, these birds carry parasites that can infest buildings. Rubber snakes, plastic owls, and aluminum plates are some ploys used to scare them away, but the effect will eventually wear off, as the pigeons realize that they are fake. You can also use repellent gel, a chemical paste that makes treated surfaces heat up the birds' feet when they land . This can ward them off for a good year or two depending on the weather. The last\u2014and best\u2014solution is to install Nixalite, a permanent barrier of stainless steel spikes pointing in all directions that keeps the birds away.\n\nWhatever solution you choose, be it repellent gel or Nixalite, be sure to rid the surface area of any bird waste beforehand.\n\n\n  \u2022 Scare off birds\n  \u2022 Keep all food where nothing can get at it\n  \u2022 Block off horizontal surfaces where birds might perch\n\n\n  \u2022 Eliminate potential food sources\n  \u2022 Limit access to perching and nesting sites\n\nDescription and development\n\nRock doves or domestic pigeons (Columbia livia )\u2014known to most simply as \"pigeons\"\u2014belong to the Columbidae bird family. They are very easy to recognize as their head is small in proportion to the rest of their body. Their bill is soft with a horned tip and plump base, while their tail is short and square. They are often confused with mourning doves, but the latter have a long, pointed tail.\n\nThe feathers of pigeons found in the wild tend to be some shade of gray, whereas those of their city-dwelling counterparts vary significantly in color.\nFemales lay one or two eggs in a nest made from assorted twigs and scraps. Nests are located in hard-to-reach areas, such as cornices, roofs, bridges, and balconies. Eggs take 17 to 19 days to hatch. Males and females both incubate the eggs and feed nestlings. When conditions allow, nesting takes place every season, enabling the birds to raise about 10 chicks a year\n\n\nBrought over to the Americas as domestic birds, pigeons have long since turned feral and now reside in cities, villages, and farms. In the countryside, they rely on crop fields for sustenance while in urban areas, they feed on plant matter, garbage, and insects\u2014not to mention the free meals they get from people in parks!\n\nPigeons mate for life; if they lose their partner for whatever reason, they quickly find another.\n\nAs keen observers of human activity, pigeons love vantage points with smooth, flat surfaces. They are also social creatures, and all members of a given colony share the same space for everyday activities.\n\nGo to top",

        "text":"Jandy 6\" Extended Lip Sheer Curtain Waterfall 1203CSC - Clear Lip\n\n\nWrite a Review Ask a Question\nProduct Number: 1203CSC\nSpecial Order Item - Usually Ships Within 1 to 2 Weeks\n\nFull Description\nJandy 6\" Extended Lip Sheer Curtain Waterfall 1203CSC - Clear Lip\n\nSheer Curtain Waterfalls produce a clear curtain of water that descends straight down from the unit. It is ideal for cantilever and swim-out installations. If this product is installed on a wall, the wall will be saturated by water giving it a refreshing look. The other option is to have it extend out from the wall, giving it a free-fall style.\n\nSheer curtain waterfalls make for a remarkable addition to any new, remodeled, or existing pool or spa. This will create a relaxed and elegant feel to any pool area, which will allow the swimmers to enjoy an enticing feature. This attraction is appealing to the eye and raises the standard for in-ground pools.\n\n  \u2022 6\" Extended Lip Waterfall\n  \u2022 3 Feet in Length\n  \u2022 Creates a clear sheet of water that descends gracefully to the pool surface.\n  \u2022 Clear Lip\n  \u2022 X-Baffle Construction\n  \u2022 PVC Construction\n  \u2022 Water feeds from the back of the waterfall.\n\nWaterfalls naturally narrow as they fall. Waterfalls should not be installed more than 3 1\/2 feet above the water surface or the sheet will start to break up.\n\nOne of the advantages of the Sheer Curtain Waterfall is the ability to provide a continuous sheet of water with a minimum of water flow. As a general rule, the Sheer Curtain Waterfall requires approximately 12 gallons per minute per foot. For a more dramatic effect, more water gallonage can be applied to project the waterfall further away from the wall.\n\nJandy 1203CSC",

        "text":"Wednesday, January 7, 2015\n\nAround the Browning Abode\n\nHi friends! Are you surviving the post-holiday grind? I have to admit coming back into the real world has been a little rough this year, but it helped that both Downton Abbey and Fixer Upper premiered this week : ) Are you guys watching??\n\nI spent a lot of Christmas break taking down Christmas, cleaning, purging and rearranging. I played musical decor with quite a few things, most of which was spurred on by redoing the shelves in the living room. I'm contributing to the Midwest Living Blog, and this month's topic is how to style your shelves. I had so much fun taking everything off our giant built-ins and starting from scratch. I pulled accessories from nearly every room of the house, and in the end I was thrilled with how it turned out! I can't show full photos yet, but above and below are some sneak peeks. I'll let you know when the whole thing is available over on Midwest Living.\n\nThat caused quite the shuffle in the other rooms though, as my usual vignettes had been pulled apart. I had already planned to redo the accessories in the hearth room in the new year, and had purchased several new accessories just for that room.\n\nI feel like this room is always the \"step sister\" to our living\/dining. I end up putting the things I really love in the living room, but the poor hearth room suffers. But in the end, all the new items went to the built in styling, and the amazing sign I bought for the mantel was an inch too tall (woops!). So I just filled up the shelves with things already on hand. It's still fresh and crisp for the new year.\n\nAbove is the beautiful Romans 12 sign which I had purchased for the mantel. It looks gorgeous in our kitchen! It's by House of Belonging and Aedriel, two very talented ladies.\n\nThe Christmas decor is down, but my paperwhites are still going strong and I'm loving the pop of green in the cold winter days. And you can also see our brand new stainless steel dishwasher...that was an unexpected but necessary purchase a few weeks ago : )\n\nTo balance out the sign in the kitchen, I added a new calendar from Rifle Paper Co and other fun accessories. Can you have enough gold in one room?\n\nMy favorite vintage street sign got kicked out of the kitchen, so into the hearth room shelves it went!\n\nI kept these shelves super simple, just using decor I had around the house. Again, I'm loving a pop of green right now.\n\nI ordered this fun zinc tray table from Magnolia Market (Joanna Gaines from Fixer Upper's store) a few weeks ago and love it tucked into this corner.\n\nThe living room stayed mostly the same, but I had to snap some photos with beautiful light after a snowfall coming in.\n\n\nI found the ikat table runner at TJ Maxx the day after Christmas. And don't you love the gold striped candles?\n\nWell there's what's happening at the Browning abode! New projects, new dishwasher, and lots of shuffling. What are you all up to in these first few weeks of 2015?\n\n\n\n  1. i just LOVE your home! love following you on IG and have finally made my way here as well. happy day to you! P.S. I'm the one who designed those wreath pillows on your couch! ;)\n\n  2. Your home is beautiful! I just painted my kitchen Paladian Blue, but your kitchen is making me want to whip out the paint brush and rollers again. It is beautiful! What color gray is that?\n\n    1. Nevermind, I just found the color on your source page. That was one of my guesses.\n\n      It is beautiful!\n\n  3. Your home is lovely as always, Courtney.\n\n  4. Excellent post man!\n    I strongly agree with your point that the Strong Relationships with your customer is the key,and Use the Language Your Customers Use. These two points are the main key points which we have to focus in B2B Marketing.\n    iphone 6 case Haze Gray\n\n  5. Your blog giving a nice things to take iphone 6, It is help full for us that give many thing related to to i phone 6, It helps to buy new iphone. Thank you for this blog.\n    Visit :- iphone 6 case Cyan Blue\n\n  6. I love love love your home. It is gorgeous! I am wondering, where did you find your coffee table? I need!\n\n\nWell hello there!

        "text":"How to prepare and stage your home for a quicker and efficient sale\n\nCategory Seller Tips\n\nMost home sellers want their home to sell fast and for top rand! There are proven ways in order to make your home stand out from the crowd, and to literally sell faster and for a better value. We have asked Antonie Goosen, the principal of Meridian Realty with offices in Stellenbosch and Betty\u2019s Bay, to share some of his thoughts in this regard. The following are some suggestions he has given. Disassociate yourself from your home It is natural to harbour emotions with regards to your own home. Home ownership is normally a very personal matter. The first step therefore is to make the mental adjustment that your home is only a product, competing with similar products, like in an appliance store. Try to remove yourself emotionally from your home, and start to see it in the light of it being a product that you are effectively putting on the market. De-personalise your home Hand in hand with the above mentioned, start to de-personalise your home. Pack up those personal photographs and family heirlooms. Buyers often struggle to see past personal artefacts, and you don't want them to be distracted. You want buyers to imagine their own photos on the walls, and it can often be difficult to do that if yours are there! You don't want to make any buyer ask, \"I wonder what kind of people live in this home?\" You want buyers to say, \"I can see myself living here.\" De-clutter!!! We tend to collect an amazing quantity of junk. Consider this: if you haven't used it in over a year, you probably don't need it. \u2022 If you don't need it, why not donate it or throw it away? \u2022 Clean off everything on kitchen counters and coffee tables; \u2022 Put essential items used daily in a small box that can be stored in a closet when not in use; Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will eventually need to do anyway. Rearrange Bedroom Closets, Kitchen Cabinets and Study areas Buyers love to snoop and will open closet and cabinet doors. Think of the message it sends if items fall out! Now imagine what a buyer believes about you if they see everything is organized. It says you probably take good care of the rest of the house as well. This means: \u2022 Neatly stack dishes. \u2022 Turn coffee cup handles facing the same way. \u2022 Hang shirts together, buttoned and facing the same direction. \u2022 Line up shoes. \u2022 Have your office and paper admin areas neatly organised; Rent a Storage Unit Almost every home shows better with less furniture. \u2022 Remove pieces of furniture that block or hamper paths and walkways and put them in storage. \u2022 Remove extra leaves from your dining room table to make the room appear larger. \u2022 Leave just enough furniture in each room to showcase the room's purpose and plenty of room to move around. You don't want buyers scratching their heads and saying, \"What is this room used for?\" Remove\/Replace Favourite Items If you want to take window coverings, built-in appliances or fixtures with you, remove them now. If the chandelier in the dining room once belonged to your great grandmother, take it down. If a buyer never sees it, they won't want it. Once you tell a buyer they can't have an item, they might covet it, and it could complicate your deal. Pack those items and replace them, if necessary. Make Minor Repairs \u2022 Replace cracked floor or counter tiles. \u2022 Patch holes in walls. \u2022 Fix leaky faucets. \u2022 Fix doors that don't close properly and kitchen drawers that jam. \u2022 Consider painting your walls neutral colours, especially if you have grown accustomed to purple or pink walls. (Don't give buyers any reason to remember your home as \"the house with the orange bathroom.\") \u2022 Replace burned-out light bulbs. \u2022 If you've considered replacing a worn bedspread, do so now! Make the House Sparkle! \u2022 Wash windows inside and out. \u2022 Rent a pressure washer and spray down sidewalks and exterior. \u2022 Clean out cobwebs. \u2022 Re-caulk tubs, showers and sinks. \u2022 Polish chrome faucets and mirrors. \u2022 Clean out the refrigerator. \u2022 Vacuum daily. \u2022 Wax floors. \u2022 Dust furniture, ceiling fan blades and light fixtures. \u2022 Bleach dingy grout. \u2022 Replace worn rugs. \u2022 Hang up fresh towels. \u2022 Bathroom towels look great fastened with ribbon and bows. \u2022 Clean and air out any musty smelling areas. Odours are a no-no. Scrutinize \u2022 Go outside and open your front door. Stand there. Do you want to go inside? Does the house welcome you? \u2022 Linger in the doorway of every single room and imagine how your house will look to a buyer. \u2022 Examine carefully how furniture is arranged and move pieces around until it makes sense. \u2022 Make sure window coverings hang level. \u2022 Tune in to the room's statement and its emotional pull. Does it have impact and pizzazz? \u2022 Does it look like nobody lives in this house? You're almost finished. Check Curb Appeal If a buyer won't get out of her agent's car because she doesn't like the exterior of your home, you'll never get her inside. \u2022 Keep the sidewalks cleared. \u2022 Mow the lawn. \u2022 Paint faded window trim. \u2022 Plant yellow flowers or group flower pots together. Yellow evokes a buying emotion. Marigolds are inexpensive. \u2022 Trim your bushes. \u2022 Make sure visitors can clearly read your house number. Now you are set Get yourself an exceptional agent with specialised knowledge and experience in your area, and let the viewings begin.

        "text":"Tuesday, 18 January 2011\n\npuddles and puppies............................\n\nThe flooding caused by the weekend's torrential rain is slowly draining away although we still have a lot of water lying on the fields and after last night's frost, a lot of it has frozen over!\u00a0 However, the sun shone today and we had a lovely walk down through the fields and round the great ponds which will hopefully disappear before too long.\n\nBack in October I mentioned that our working beardie collie had his girlfriend to stay while she was in season, and in early December she produced a litter of eight puppies who are now almost seven weeks old.\u00a0 The plan was always for us to have a puppy from this litter\u00a0and after several visits we have finally\u00a0made our choice\u00a0although we wont bring him home until next week.\u00a0 There are three dogs in the litter and it was a difficult decision to make as they're all lovely puppies.\u00a0 A friend in the village is taking one of the bitches and at the moment there are still two puppies available.\u00a0\u00a0 We have a few ideas about names, but we'll wait until he's here to decide what really suits him best.\n\n\nWednesday, 12 January 2011\n\nmist and magazines......................\n\nWhat gloomy, murky weather we're having!\u00a0 A chilly, damp fog has descended and walking the dogs this afternoon was like wandering through a strange, quiet, bluey-grey world\u00a0full of\u00a0 blurred,\u00a0ghostly shapes.\u00a0\u00a0 Another couple of inches of snow fell through the night but it's very soft and damp with the rise in temperature so at least walking is a bit easier.\u00a0\n\nWhat better way to cheer up a gloomy afternoon than to escape into pile of lovely new magazines and that's just what I did!\u00a0 \u00a0Not that there weren't masses of other jobs to do, but\u00a0 the lure of\u00a0 the February issue of Country Living was too strong.\u00a0 I've been reading Country Living since it first appeared\u00a0in the mid 80's and I still have every issue.\u00a0 They're stored in various boxes, bags and piles and\u00a0some day I would like to file them\u00a0in chronological order but\u00a0\u00a0I can't see that happening\u00a0anytime soon!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI think the February CL is\u00a0better than\u00a0the last few issues.\u00a0 I felt the magazine had been going through a rather stale phase but this is a very bright, interesting and inspiring issue.\u00a0 The Emporium pages feature lots of interesting bits and pieces and there's also a very good piece on food fraud which\u00a0is something we should all be aware of as it happens a lot more than we might think.\u00a0 I'm particularly delighted to see that Diana Henry is to be their new, regular, food writer\u00a0 as\u00a0I love her books especially Crazy Water Pickled Lemons which is full of wonderful recipes.\u00a0 There are also lovely crafts, marbled paper, fascinating interiors\u00a0 and all the other usual\u00a0features.\n\nI started to buy Country Homes & Interiors\u00a0regularly in late 2009 and I've been enjoying it\u00a0ever since.\u00a0 I particularly\u00a0like the food writing and have\u00a0discovered lots of lovely new recipes over the months.\u00a0 The February issue features egg recipes including\u00a0what sounds\u00a0like a delicious goat's cheese and leek souffle.\u00a0\u00a0 There's an interesting article about glove makers in Somerset\u00a0 and\u00a0some\u00a0clever ideas for\u00a0making bird feed\u00a0cones, bells, hearts and\u00a0trays\u00a0which look really\u00a0pretty and would no doubt go down well with the birds!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are also\u00a0the usual\u00a0 interiors features\u00a0 and a lovely\u00a0article about a collection\u00a0of snowdrops in Kent.\u00a0\n\n\nSaturday, 8 January 2011\n\nPersephone Books..................\n\nI have just discovered The Persephone Catalogue, brought out by Persephone Books in London.\u00a0 They specialise in reprints of novels, diaries, poetry and\u00a0cookery books, mostly by women and mainly from the early to mid-twentieth century.\u00a0\u00a0 It just arrived in today's post and I haven't had time to study it carefully, but even after a quick flick through, I've spotted several titles which I'd like to read.\u00a0 Throughout the catalogue there are photographs of beautiful vintage fabrics whose designs are\u00a0reproduced in the endpapers of the books.\u00a0 I will be placing an order very soon and for anyone else who's interested they can be found on\u00a0\u00a0http:\/\/www.persephonebooks.co.uk\/\u00a0 The catalogue itself is a work of art and will probably be my bedtime reading for the next couple of nights!\u00a0\n\nFriday, 7 January 2011\n\nlast minute sky...................\n\nThe temperature is dropping again!\u00a0 Last night it fell to minus 12 and today has been bitterly cold.\u00a0 It was a particularly dull, colourless day and when I took the dogs out this afternoon I almost didn't bother to take the camera with me.\u00a0 Thankfully I did and was rewarded with this spectacular skyscape which just seemed to appear from nowhere!\u00a0 We hadn't seen the sun all day but suddenly a warm glow\u00a0built up in the south west and this lovely sky transformed the afternoon!\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0to the east something similar was happening although less fiery.\u00a0 It was like a reflection in blue and pink and was quite amazing!\n\nFirst footing continues well into January around here and we tend to get all the routine jobs done by early afternoon so that we can set off and visit friends and neighbours to wish them a happy new year.\u00a0\u00a0 When first footing someone, you take something to eat, something to drink and something for the fire.\u00a0 We set off with a basket of bottles, jars of chutney, fruit cake, shortbread and lumps of peat and quite often the fiddle and guitar \u00a0just in case there's the chance of a tune! \u00a0 It's a lovely custom and we've had our share of first feet\u00a0as well.\u00a0 Long may it continue.\n\nfeasting sheep",

        "text":"\n\nTuesday, 4 August 2009\n\nplugging away\n\nYesterday was spent in the studio - pretty much literally. It was a nice day outside from what I saw of the world out there, the sun shining and a light summer breeze. But from 10 am until 5 pm, stopping at 2:30 for a little lunch, we worked on the midi tracks from last week.\n\nBeside the word 'tedious' in the dictionary there could be a picture of this. Songs are listened to, then fragments of songs are listened to, the notes in that segment adjusted ever so slightly for timing or pitch, the fragment listened to again, more adjustments made, listen again, move on to the next segment, rinse and repeat. I move between getting tired of the songs and being amazed, on hearing the finishing product, that I wrote such a good-sounding thing. Thankfully, I land mostly on the side of the latter and I still like my music.\n\nBut, for all this, it is a step that makes the music better and better. If we didn't do the tedious work the finished product would be sloppy and not reach its full potential. Yes, we're not going to launch it when we'd hoped. But we also won't have done a rush job on it that doesn't do the songs justice. Tim is amazing in how he brings all the bits and pieces together, adjusting and tweaking and doing all that tedious work and bringing the songs to a place that still manages to surprise me.\n\nAnd I returned home to some surprises. We are getting out house rewired, removing some electrical wiring and fixtures that are probably original to the 1940s. The first switchbox he opened was certainly vintage, with the wires sautered and taped (rather than using those little things we use nowadays that screw on and for which I'm sure there is a name that I don't know). D was off for the civic holiday so was able to help with the work. One discovery: on pulling off the board-and-batten siding near the back entry he confirmed that the construction of at least that part of the house is, indeed, logs and chinking. We'd wondered about that, so seeing the evidence is pretty cool. It also explains why the house is more than just cool in the winter! Logs with board & batten, and then siding. Insulation, anyone?\n\nToday I'm home, with more electrical work going on. It's going to be a chaotic, disruptive couple of weeks. Oh well, we'd hate for life to get boring...\n\n\nBooner said...\n\nThe \"little screw things\" are called \"marretts\".\n\n(And I believe you mean \"soldered\" instead of \"sautered\" :-))\n\nbarb said...\n\nAh, I knew they had a name. And soldered... my non-handyman-ness is showing!",

Unleash the holiday hygge, the outdoor range cooker is here!\n\nI know, I know it\u2019s nearly summer and I\u2019m talking about wood-burners but bear with; you are definitely going to want to hear this! In twenty years of writing about gardening I\u2019ve never come across anything like it: an outdoor wood-burner you can cook on, because wood-burners aren\u2019t just for Christmas!\n\nYou use it to heat and eat \u2013 think outdoor range cooker but with added summer-holiday hygge. Chill and grill by day, and come the evening, sit out under the stars and party like it\u2019s\u00a0the Caribbean not chilly Crediton.\n\nThe Heat & Grill is made by Chesneys, as loved by cheferati James Martin and interior designer Kelly Hoppen; they\u2019re best known for their ultra-efficient, environmentally-friendly wood stoves. Part of the new HEAT range, the less fancy version is called the Clean Burn, which is just an outdoor wood-burner and there\u2019s an upscaled version if you\u2019ve got a big family or are a natural party animal.\u00a0\n\nJust like your indoor wood-burner it has a flue but because it\u2019s built for outdoors, there\u2019s no installation cost and it has two wheels on the back, so it\u2019s a moveable feast (though yes, it\u2019s heavy and don\u2019t move when it\u2019s lit obvs!).\u00a0\n\nFill up the wood-burner with wood and kindling, light in the normal way and once the gauge on the top is up to temperature simply flip the lid, and cook a pizza, spatchcock a chicken, barbee some burgers \u2013 you can even bake focaccia or a cake, if you fancy.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also a baffle to flip down in front of the fire so you don\u2019t cook your legs, or hubby\u2019s, as let\u2019s face it, even men who don\u2019t know the oven from their elbow, love a beer and bit of burger flipping on a sunny summer afternoon.\u00a0\n\nWant to know the best bit?

        "text":"Couple buy house but 'can't get out of car' on narrow driveway\n\nBy Andrew Turton | Great Barr | News | Published:\n\nPaul and Zena Jones only discovered the parking problem when they went to move in.\n\nUsually drivers are adept at maneuvering into spaces which can be a tight squeeze - but this is one even Lewis Hamilton might struggle with.\n\nCouple Paul and Zena Jones say they have been stuck trying to park in the driveway next to their new home in Great Barr since they moved in.\n\nThey branded the situation 'frustrating' after claiming their driveway only measures 89 inches - or 7ft 4ins - wide.\n\nThey struggle to open the doors of their Ford Fiesta and claim to be unable to get out of the car.\n\nPaul, aged 34, has since set up his own Twitter page \u2013 @DeerParkNoDrive \u2013 in a bid to highlight concerns.\n\nThey also tweeted out pictures showing their friend's car to illustrate the issue.\n\nHaving seen the designs, the couple bought the house from developer Taylor Wimpey before it was built, in a shared ownership agreement for \u00a390,000 with housing association Walsall Housing Group (whg).\n\n\nThey moved into their home, in Deer Park Drive, in February this year.\n\nBut when they first arrived on the day they received their keys they were stunned to find the narrow driveway.\n\n\"We pulled the car on and couldn't believe it. We couldn't get the door open,\" said Zena, aged 54.\n\nThe couple claim the width of the driveway is 89 inches, narrowing to 86 inches where an electric box is positioned on a outer wall.\n\n\nAfter reporting the issue to Taylor Wimpey they feel they have yet to hear a resolution to the issue.\n\n\"It is really frustrating. We have exhausted all ways of trying to get them to listen,\" said Mrs Jones.\n\nMrs Jones said: \"We've had people look at it three times yet we're getting nowhere.\n\n\"All we want is a bit of communication. We keep being passed from pillar to post.\"\n\nHer daughter Sam, 26, had also tried to pull her Fiat 500 car on the drive but claims not to be able to open the door to get out.\n\nA Taylor Wimpey spokesman said: \u201cWe are in regular contact with the customer and are working collaboratively to resolve any issues.\n\n\"We apologise for any inconvenience which may have been caused, and hope to come to a mutually-agreeable conclusion at the soonest possibility.\u201d\n\nMark Tranter, whg\u2019s Director of Development, said: \u201cWe have been liaising with both Taylor Wimpey and the customer to ensure this matter is resolved.\u201d\n\nAndrew Turton\n\nBy Andrew Turton\nDigital Journalist\n\nDigital journalist based at the Express & Star's head office in Wolverhampton.

        "text":"Edit Article\n\nTwo Methods:Removing the Old HandleInstalling the New Handle\n\nThe handle on a toilet is an important component to any bathroom design. Not only is it integral to the function of the toilet, but the style and finish of the handle should also coordinate with the rest of the bathroom faucets and fixtures. If your toilet handle is corroded or out of date, replace it with a new one to keep your bathroom functioning in style.\n\n\nMethod 1 of 2: Removing the Old Handle\n\nBefore the new handle can be installed, the old handle needs to be removed from the tank properly.\n\n  1. 1\n    Shut off the water valve to the toilet and flush the toilet to drain any water from the tank.\n  2. 2\n    Remove the lid from the toilet tank.\n  3. 3\n    Unscrew the wing nut that holds the tank lever to the back of the handle. Set it aside to be reinstalled with the new handle.\n  4. 4\n    Unscrew the nut from the back of the handle. Toilet nuts thread in reverse; turn the nut clockwise to remove it.\n    \u2022 If the nut is plastic, use your fingers to loosen it.\n    \u2022 If the nut is metal, use a wrench to help loosen it.\n  5. 5\n    Pull the handle through to the front of the tank and remove the nut and washer from the back of the toilet tank. Discard these parts.\n\nMethod 2 of 2: Installing the New Handle\n\nToilet handles install similarly to the way the old ones are removed.\n\n  1. 1\n    Unscrew the washer and nut from the back of the new handle. The washer is a rubber gasket that helps prevent leaks. It sits up against the nut and slides right off once the nut is removed.\n  2. 2\n    Push the new handle's stem through the hole on the side of the toilet tank.\n  3. 3\n    Slide the washer over the handle's stem and screw the nut back into place. Remember that it threads in reverse; screw it on counterclockwise to tighten it.\n  4. 4\n    Lift up the toilet lever and push its end down through the hole at the end of the handle's stem.\n  5. 5\n    Screw on the wing nut to the end of the toilet lever to hold it in place.\n  6. 6\n    Turn on the water valve to refill the toilet tank.\n  7. 7\n    Flush the toilet to make sure the new handle works.\n  8. 8\n    Replace the tank lid.\n\n\n  \u2022 Toilet handles come in left and right hand versions, as well as front and side tank versions. If in doubt, take your old handle with you to the store to purchase a new one to ensure the new handle fits the tank properly.\n\n\n  \u2022 Do not over tighten the nut against the toilet tank. This may result in the porcelain of the tank cracking under pressure. Only tighten the nut enough to hold the handle securely in place without the handle jiggling when the toilet is flushed.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\n  \u2022 Wrench\n\nSources and Citations\n\nArticle Info\n\nCategories: Toilet Maintenance\n\nIn other languages:\n\nEspa\u00f1ol:\u00a0reemplazar la manija del inodoro,\u00a0Italiano:\u00a0Sostituire la Maniglia dello Sciacquone del Water,\u00a0\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439:\u00a0\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0435,\u00a0Portugu\u00eas:\u00a0Substituir a Descarga de um Vaso Sanit\u00e1rio,\u00a0Deutsch:\u00a0Einen Toilettenhebel austauschen\n\nThanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 56,179 times.\n\nDid this article help you?\nYes No\n\nan Author!\n\nWrite an Article",
