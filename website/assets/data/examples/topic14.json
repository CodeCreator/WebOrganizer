        "text":"Honey Cowl\n\nI\u2019ve had two skeins of Classic Shades yarn in my stash for quite some time \u2013 bought originally to make leg warmers, then I realized it didn\u2019t have enough \u2018bounce\u2019 and the results would likely be very saggy \u2013 and then the other day I ran across the Honey Cowl pattern and BOOM! I remembered about this yarn. \u00a0It is super soft and\u00a0snugly\u00a0 and the long color changes are nicely showcased in this slip stitch pattern. I\u2019m making the larger size (220 stitches) and with two skeins the cowl should end up about 8\u2033 wide. It\u2019s also fantastic commuter knitting, as every other row is plain stockinette.\n\n(almost half done; close-up of stitch pattern)\n\n\nAbout wonkydonkey\n\nYou want random? You got it. Mostly knitting and gardening, with some home improvements, pets, baking, family, and the occasional bad joke thrown in for good measure. This blog is mine; it is a place where I can insist upon proper grammar or break my own rules and degrade into slang on a whim. Either way, it's still mine.

        "text":"7 Challenge, Everyday Life\n\nWaste Not: Part 5 of the 7 Challenge\n\n7: An Experimental Mutiny Against ExcessLast month I was supposed to be working on the Waste part of the 7 challenge. When I began thinking about this part of the challenge, I thought I was already doing pretty well on that front. I have a family of four and we fill up our recycling cart at the same rate if not faster than our trash cart. Usually, our trash cart is only half full on the day the trash is picked up. I am guilty of looking at neighbors\u2019 trash cans on trash pick up day and thinking, \u201cWow. They are Wasters.\u201d Needless to say, there was a high horse to fall off there.\n\nAnd fall off I did. Because, while I do recycle absolutely everything I possibly can, the point remains that if I have something to recycle, that means I\u2019m buying something that\u2019s prepackaged. Deli meats, canned spaghetti sauce, boxes of noodles, yogurt cups, all that stuff comes in recyclable packages. And some things I consider to be necessary are packaged and aren\u2019t recyclable. I mean, when I think about all the Styrofoam egg cartons\u2026but how do you get around that? Aldi only sells one kind of egg!\n\nI guess it all comes down to how much trouble I\u2019m willing to go to in my attempts to reduce waste. I think I kind of phoned it in on this part of the challenge. And that is unacceptable. So I\u2019m doing a re-do in March. Here are the more specific goals for the month:\n\n-Start (and, please Lord, finish!) potty training Isaac in the second half of the month. He\u2019ll be 3 in June and with another baby due in July, now seems like it\u2019s time. My \u201cmethod\u201d relies heavily on not wearing a whole lot of clothing for the first few days of potty training, which is why I think this should take place in the warmer part of \u00a0the month. I greet this part of the challenge with a great deal of trepidation\u2013potty training my firstborn took about a year, and I am not exaggerating.\n\n-At least\u00a0try\u00a0to get Ella out of nighttime Pull-ups. I\u2019ve heard some parents have success with waking young children up and taking them to the bathroom before the parents go to bed. I\u2019m just not sure about this one. One problem is I go to bed about an hour to an hour and a half after my children. Is that enough time? Another problem is I abhor the drama that always follows when my poor little four-year-old is incoherently sleepy. To willingly bring that upon both of us is going to take some girding up of mental toughness. If anyone else has experience with methods for getting rid of Pull-ups at night, please share. I\u2019d really prefer not waking her up because I think she barely gets enough sleep as it is.\n\n-Sew a couple of handkerchiefs for myself. Yes, I just used the word \u201chandkerchief.\u201d And the word \u201csew.\u201d I hate, hate,\u00a0hate\u00a0buying Kleenexes. Which is why my husband is always asking in a very nice but what I hear as accusing tone, \u201cDon\u2019t we have any Kleenex?\u201d I just don\u2019t think to buy them, and when I do remember, I say, \u201cWe don\u2019t really need those.\u201d But my husband and my kids really enjoy a soft nose wipe for the winter months. And the allergy ridden spring months. And probably all the months in between. I could care less, I\u2019ll use a brown paper bag, but I do grab a Kleenex if they\u2019re handy. I\u2019d rather use something that\u2019s reusable, though. So, hello, old fashioned-ness. (I have the same goal for nursing liners, but I won\u2019t go into great detail there. Details about Kleenex usage are quite enough for one day).\n\n-Reduce our dependence on boxed cereal. There are lots of reasons this is a good idea, one of them being most cereal doesn\u2019t keep my kids full past 8:00 a.m. Another reason is a lot of those colorful boxes pose major recycling problems. Another reason is it\u2019s mostly gross and we throw out half of the box. Is there a drawback? Oh yeah, cooking and washing dishes before 8:00 in the morning. Dear friends, bring on the easy breakfast ideas.\n\nThose are the goals. I could think of more, but my children are pretending to be firefighters and I probably should go put a stop to their throwing open the front door and yelling \u201cFire, fire, EMERGENCY!\u201d for the whole neighborhood to hear. Because a false 911 call is even more wasteful than a Styrofoam egg carton.\n\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cWaste Not: Part 5 of the 7 Challenge\u201d\n\n  1. SarahJ says:\n\n    We do a lot of cereal\u2026 mostly because I buy it cheap with coupons\/sales\u2026 but one of my favorite breakfasts is to mix up my granny\u2019s Swedish bran muffin recipe one evening\u2026 the batter keeps for 2 weeks in the refrigerator so I can bake a dozen at a time\u2026 or more. I often just reheat the leftovers for the next morning. And add a banana. They are super filling and the kids love them.\n\n  2. Brittany L says:\n\n    I love doing those baked oatmeal in muffin tin \u201cmuffins\u201d, they\u2019re really good and easy to personalize. The best part is you can freeze them and take them out as needed. And good luck on the potty training!\n\n    1. MiaTheReader says:\n\n      Good idea, Brittany! I sure hope that recipe is on your Pinterest board because I\u2019m going to look for it right now.\n\nLeave a Reply to Brittany L\n\nYour email address will not be published.
