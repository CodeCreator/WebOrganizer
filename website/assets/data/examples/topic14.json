        "text":"Shop Etsy\n\nA Simple and Cute DIY Gnome Ornament\n\nDec 16, 2016\n\nby Andrea Greco handmade and vintage goods\n\nChristmas is a very big deal in my family, and\u00a0decorating\u00a0for the holiday is\u00a0a tradition I look forward to eleven long months out of every\u00a0year. This\u00a0adorable DIY\u00a0gnome ornament was inspired by my great auntie Jean \u2014 my crafting hero\u00a0\u2014 who always made the most charming\u00a0ornaments out of simple materials like walnuts and other natural elements.\u00a0I think Jean would definitely approve of\u00a0this little guy.\n\nYou will need:\n\nA walnut\nBlack fine-tip Sharpie\nCrafting felt, any color\nCrafting fur, white\nA tiny wood bead or button\nHot-glue gun\nEmbroidery thread\n\n\nStep 1:\u00a0Cut a roughly 2\u201d x 5\u201d rectangle from the\u00a0crafting fur to make the gnome\u2019s beard; the precise size you need may\u00a0vary with\u00a0the size of your walnut.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Fold the fur in half lengthwise and cut a small semicircle from the top of the folded edge near the fold; this creates the\u00a0shape for the top of the beard.\n\n\nStep 3: Apply glue to the back\u00a0side\u00a0of the fur near\u00a0the cut edge. Turn the fur\u00a0over and center it on\u00a0the walnut, pressing to attach. With a\u00a0Sharpie, draw eyes on the walnut above the beard. I drew two simple dots, but\u00a0you can also draw two half-moons for a sleepy look.\n\n\nStep 4: To make the gnome\u2019s\u00a0hat, cut a small felt triangle that\u2019s approximately 4.5\u00a0inches wide at the base and 3 inches tall on\u00a0the sides. Next,\u00a0apply a line of hot glue to one of the 3-inch\u00a0edges of the hat and attach it to the opposite 3-inch edge, creating a cone shape. Trim any excess from the base of the hat if needed.\n\nStep 5: Apply hot glue to the bottom inside edge of the hat, then affix the hat to the walnut\u00a0just above the\u00a0eyes. (Make sure to\u00a0position the hat\u2019s\u00a0seam on the back side.)\n\nStep 6:\u00a0Dot hot glue onto the wood bead and position it above the\u00a0fur beard\u00a0to create\u00a0the gnome\u2019s nose.\n\nStep 7: Once all the glue has dried, cut a 6-inch piece of embroidery thread\u00a0and use a needle to loop it through the top of the gnome\u2019s hat. Tie the ends of the thread in a knot and you\u2019ve finished your\u00a0ornament.\n\n\nYour gnome is now ready to spread holiday cheer, so hang him on the\u00a0tree and display with pride.\n\nExplore\u00a0DIY\u00a0Holiday Decor\n\n\nSign in to add your own",
