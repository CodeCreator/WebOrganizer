The components cooperate over several secure communication channels to achieve management information workflow and present information to operators and administrators. The most important data collected is the health of the managed objects; this health status is arrived at via models that affect the tactical placement of software probes called monitors.\n\nThis chapter endeavors to make these terms and relationships clear so that the job of deploying and supporting OpsMgr 2007 becomes easier and more effective. Those readers tempted to skip this chapter covering OpsMgr internals, definitions, and concepts are probably asking themselves, \"What practical use can I expect to get from reading this chapter?\" Some administrators avoid looking under the hood deliberately, and that's totally OK. For those individuals, we do recommend reading at least the \"Management Group Defined\" section of this chapter.\n\nSo, for those OpsMgr administrators who yearn to know exactly what is going on behind the scenes, this chapter is for you. We want you to understand the lingo and reasoning used by the software developers of Operations Manager. In doing so, we hope that more advanced material about OpsMgr will make sense more quickly to you, the OpsMgr administrator, when reading this book, using the product, or interacting with fellow professionals in the Microsoft systems management community.\n\nArchitectural Overview\n\nThis chapter looks at OpsMgr design and internals at two levels:\n\n  \u2022 The macro level\u2014We'll look at the computer roles that comprise a management group.\n  \u2022 The micro level\u2014We'll examine the objects that constitute a management pack, in particular its workflow and presentation of data to the operator.\n\nAs an OpsMgr administrator, you have no influence over server component characteristics\u2014these are hard-coded features of the Operations Manager software and hardware architecture. On the other hand, administrators can enjoy almost complete flexibility regarding the manner in which management packs are utilized.\n\nOpsMgr administrators of the smallest environments\u2014administrators who will run all applicable OpsMgr components on a single server and manage only computers and devices on their local area network (LAN)\u2014generally are less concerned about this section on OpsMgr architecture. In that small-scale scenario of the \"all-in-one\" management group server, there is much less to be concerned about with architectural considerations of the various OpsMgr computer roles (components) as long as you stay below capacity thresholds for that single server and its network segment. In this simplest OpsMgr environment, the only OpsMgr components not resident on the single server are the OpsMgr agents running on the managed computers on the network.\n\nHowever, many OpsMgr administrators will need to distribute multiple components across different servers, deploying OpsMgr roles across multiple computers. Even OpsMgr 2007 deployments on small business networks may include an Audit Collection Services (ACS) Component to centralize security event auditing, or an OpsMgr Gateway Server Component to monitor service delivery at a branch office where there is no Virtual Private Network (VPN) connectivity. Deploying the feature sets added when installing these additional roles, by definition, adds one or more physical management servers to the management group and requires an understanding of Operations Manager 2007 management group architecture. Chapter 4, \"Planning Your Operations Manager Deployment,\" and Chapter 5, \"Planning Complex Configurations,\" provide information on hardware specifications and sizing server configurations.\n\nManagement Group Defined\n\nA management group is an instance of the Microsoft end-to-end service management solution named Operations Manager 2007. Organizations may host several management groups (instances of OpsMgr on their networks) if appropriate for their business needs. Likewise, any managed computer or device can participate in one or more instances (management groups) of OpsMgr if appropriate. Most organizations of all sizes deploy a single management group, which is analogous to a single Active Directory (AD) forest or a single Exchange organization. Most organizations, including some very large ones, have their business needs met with just one AD forest and one Exchange organization.\n\nFigure 3.1 illustrates a default, single management group in an organization, and contrasts that with a more complex implementation one might encounter in a large organization. In the simple all-in-one example on the left in Figure 3.1, all OpsMgr components are installed on one server, which is the only OpsMgr server in the single management group serving the managed computers (agents) in the organization. Several hundred computers can be managed with an all-in-one deployment of OpsMgr 2007.\n\nFigure 3.1\n\nFigure 1 Contrasting the smallest with a very large OpsMgr 2007 deployment model.\n\nIn the complex large organization scenario on the right-hand portion of Figure 3.1, a single computer agent is reporting simultaneously to two management groups (known as a multihomed agent), while one of those management groups, through its Root Management Server (RMS), participates with several connected management groups. This creates an architecture capable of servicing tens of thousands of widely distributed computers.\n\nYou will seldom need multiple management groups to get the most out of OpsMgr 2007 since the product's design provides full functionality to all but the largest of organizations while still using a single management group. For the very large organization (over 10,000 computers or over 100 remote sites), deploying several OpsMgr 2007 management groups can distribute the workload. Connecting these management groups enables you to query multiple management groups from the same Operations console.\n\nBoth having more than one production instance of OpsMgr in your organization and having a computer or device report status to more than one management group are advanced configurations to accomplish particular business goals. We describe these situations in Chapter 10, \"Complex Configurations.\"\n\nServer Components\n\nHere are a dozen possible computer components, or roles, that can be deployed in an OpsMgr 2007 management group. Focusing now on what components constitute a single OpsMgr 2007 management group, let's begin with describing the core, or basic, server components. The core components are those that an OpsMgr 2007 deployment must include to have minimum functionality. These basic components (displayed in Figure 3.2) are installed in every management group, including the all-in-one server OpsMgr environment.\n\nFigure 3.2\n\nFigure 3.2 OpsMgr 2007 core components combined in one server, and distributed across dedicated servers.\n\n  \u2022 Operations Database Server Component\u2014The heart of the management group is the Operations database. The Operations database contains operational data about managed objects, the configuration store of what objects are managed, and all customizations to the OpsMgr environment. The Operations database is the central repository and processing point for all data in a management group. When you install an OpsMgr 2007 management group on multiple computer systems, the first thing to take place is installing the Operations database on an existing SQL 2005 database server running Service Pack (SP) 1 or later. The Operations Database Server Component can be clustered in high-availability environments.\n  \u2022 Root Management Server Component\u2014The first management server installed in a management group is the Root Management Server Component. Like all OpsMgr 2007 management servers, the RMS sends configuration information to managed computers and receives data from agents. The RMS alone runs some distinctive services that the entire management group depends on, and like the Operations Database Server Component, the RMS Component can be clustered. The RMS requires that the Operations database be available and accessible. The function of the entire management group also depends on the RMS; in high-availability environments you should consider clustering both the Operations database and the RMS components.\n  \u2022 Agent Component\u2014The Agent Component is used to monitor servers and clients. This is a Windows service that runs on managed servers and client computers. You might create an all-in-one server management group whose only purpose is monitoring network devices such as routers or switches; in that case, no agents need to be deployed. However, for most OpsMgr setups, the deployment of core management group components is not complete until one or more computers are selected for management and the Agent Component is installed. As we mentioned previously in the \"Management Group Defined\" section of this chapter, an OpsMgr 2007 agent can participate in more than one management group simultaneously.\n  \u2022 Console Component\u2014The OpsMgr 2007 console is the only application needed to interact with the management group, and it is used by both operators and administrators. Operations Manager 2007 implements role-based security to ensure an optimized experience for all users. There is also a web-based console ... (truncated)",

The assessments should help teams to improve how they build, test, and deploy software systems through identifying different kinds of improvements:\n\n  1. Team-focused improvements\n  2. Product-focused and Service-focused improvements\n  3. Organisation-wide improvements\n\nThe assessments should NOT be used to penalize teams, but to provide a shared drive towards improving practices and quality.\n\nTeams included in the assessments\n\nEvery team writing code, scripts, and\/or configuration for application software or infrastructure will benefit from being included in the assessments:\n\n  \u2022 Teams building user- and customer-facing websites and services\n  \u2022 Teams building internal services\n  \u2022 Teams building infrastructure to support other systems (including Platform teams)\n  \u2022 Teams building build & deployment tooling and scripts\n  \u2022 Teams configuring and testing COTS products as part of the software & infrastructure estate\n  \u2022 Any other teams with a primary focus on building, configuring, and testing software and infrastructure\n\nBy \"team\", we mean 6-10 person group that works together closely, usually called a\u00a0SquadScrum team, Product team, or Stream-aligned team\n\nAssessment criteria\n\nThe criteria for each dimension are taken from existing published books and online sources:\n\nHow to run the assessments\n\nThe assessment session itself should feel somewhat like a team retrospective session. The main difference from a normal retrospective session is that in the team assessment session the facilitator guides the discussion more firmly. There are many questions to discuss and it's important that the team discusses all of the criteria in the time available.\n\nAt the end of the assessment session, the team should feel encouraged and empowered to decide on what actions they want to take to improve their processes and practices based on the discussions.\n\n\nMany organisations find that running team assessments every 3 months provides a good result.\n\n\n  1. Find someone to Facilitate the assessment. This should be someone from outside the team, who is familiar with running team retrospectives.\u00a0\n  2. Book a time slot for 2 or 3 hours: for online sessions you could split this over 2 or more video call sessions, and for in-person sessions book\u00a0a room large enough for the team.\n  3. For online sessions, either use the card deck from Agile Stationery and screenshot or note down the results in a spreadsheet, or use an online poll tool to capture responses from people in the session. For in-person sessions, either use the card deck from Agile Stationery, or print the assessment sheets for each set of criteria, either using the ready-made A1 PDF (see Releases), or the individual assessment pages at A1 size if possible (use small margins):\n  4. For online sessions, show the Tired and Inspired criteria on the screen alongside the question. For in-person sessions, either print the details pages\u00a0as a guide or have the pages open on-screen to understand the context and details of each of the assessment criteria:\n    1.

For online sessions, have someone take notes in a document or shared whiteboard. For in-person sessions, bring lots of marker pens or whiteboard markers: red, blue, and green are best.\n  6. Include\u00a0someone who is familiar with facilitating retrospectives\u00a0(possibly a scrum master) in the session. They will be shadowing the facilitator during the session so the person from your team can facilitate other assessment sessions later.\n\nMake sure that the Facilitator understands the purpose of the session and is familiar with the assessment pages and questions.\n\n\nThe facilitator should familiarise themselves with the Spotify Squad Health Check approach before running the session. See How I Used the Spotify Squad Health Check Model for a good experience report, Squad Health Checks from SkyBet, and download instructions from Spotify (PDF).\n\nDuring the assessment:\n\n  \u2022 Keep the team on schedule by asking for some discussions to be held outside the session\n  \u2022 Write down the team scores and notes on the printed assessment sheets or ensure that scores and notes are captured in a digital tool.\n  \u2022 Take photographs of the completed assessment sheets for in-person sessions.\n  \u2022 Get feedback from the team on the VALUE and EXECUTION of the engineering assessment - smiley faces are sufficient!\n\n\nEach team assessment runs for around 3-4 hours, and the facilitator will run the team\u00a0through 10 sets of questions:\n\n  1. Team health check -\u00a035 mins\n  2. Deployment health check -\u00a010 mins\n  3. Flow check -\u00a010 mins\n  4. Continuous Delivery check -\u00a020 mins\n  5. Operability check -\u00a020 mins\n  6. Test coverage check -\u00a020 mins\n  7. Reliability and SRE - 30 mins\n  8. On-call - 15 mins\n  9. Security check - 30 mins\n  10. Team Topologies check - 20 mins\n\nThese timings leave space for two 10 minute breaks\u00a0during the assessment.\n\nRunning the Assessment session\n\nEach section has several questions. Each question should be answered as follows:\n\n  \u2022 The team (either as individuals or as a team) rate each of the criteria using\u00a0SAD (1 OR 2)\u00a0\/\u00a0MEH (3)\u00a0\/\u00a0YAY (4 OR 5)\u00a0based on the\u00a0Tired\u00a0and\u00a0Inspired\u00a0guidelines\n\n    \u2022 Tired\u00a0aligns to a low rating (1), and\u00a0Inspired\u00a0aligns to a high rating (5)\n\n    \u2022 If you used individual ratings, tally the ratings and\/or decide on a single team score from 1 to 5. You may find it useful to use different coloured pens on the printed sheet to indicate visually the different ratings.\n\n  \u2022 The\u00a0Trend\u00a0since the previous time is identified (going up, staying roughly the same, going down), if applicable\n\n  \u2022 An\u00a0Action\u00a0agreed to improve the score for that question over the coming months.\n\n  \u2022 Use the\u00a0Notes\u00a0column to indicate further information that you think is valuable for the coordinating team to know about.\n\n  \u2022 Make sure to complete to the\u00a0Date\/Name\/Facilitator\u00a0details\n\n  \u2022 For in-person sessions, take a photo of each completed sheet and send to\u00a0the person coordinating the assessments\n\n  \u2022 \u00a0Get team members to rate the assessment session itself in terms of: Value, Execution (sad, meh, happy faces)\n\nViral facilitation\n\nEach team assessment session has present one person who is shadowing the facilitator so that they can themselves facilitate future sessions. Each new facilitator should facilitate at least 2 sessions with other teams. In this way, the number of facilitators expands rapidly, enabling a minimal burden on the initial facilitators.\n\nCoordinating and interpreting the results\n\nAfter teams have each run an assessment session and sent their results, the coordinating group should collate the results from different teams to identify any areas that need improving across the organisation. Ask questions such as:\n\n  \u2022 Why does team ABC rate themselves as 1 for test coverage? What is hindering them?\n  \u2022 What can we do as an organisation to help... (truncated)",
