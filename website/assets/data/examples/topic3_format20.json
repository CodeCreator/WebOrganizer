The Statute provides that the regulations must include standards for determining when to obtain a CE and the type of CE to be purchased, and monitoring procedures for both the purchase process and CE reports. Also, the regulations must reflect that the Secretary will make every reasonable effort to obtain necessary evidence from the claimant\"s medical sources before obtaining medical evidence from another source on a consultative basis; develop a complete medical history covering at least 12 months if deciding that the claimant is not under a disability; and consider all the evidence in the claimant\"s case record. The Social Security Administration published proposed rules in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on April 20, 1987 (52 FR 13014). The final rules, published on August 1, 1991 (56 FR 36932), respond to comments, reflect and implement the statutory requirements, and clarify the Secretary\"s policy on giving weight to treating source opinions.\n\nThis issuance updates Office of Appellate Operations procedures based on the new regulations.\n\nExplanation of Content and Changes\n\nIn I-3-711:\n\n  \u2022 Subsections A. and B. now make a clearer distinction between remands for existing medical evidence and remands for consultative examinations or medical tests. Subsection B. also provides that remand for consultative examinations\/tests is appropriate only if the necessary evidence does not appear to be available from the claimant\"s medical sources.\n\n  \u2022 Subsection D. now reflects that, when requesting consultative examinations or tests, we will order only the specific examinations and\/or tests needed to make a decision on the claim. We will not order a complete examination unless it is required (20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 404.1519f, 404.1519n(d), 416.919f and 416.919n(d)).\n\n  \u2022 Subsection D. also contains instructions for requesting medical tests or procedures and incorporates the regulatory prohibition from ordering tests or procedures which may involve significant risk to the claimant (20 CFR 404.1519m and 416.919m).\n\nPersonnel who have questions about this issuance should telephone the Office of Policy, Planning and Evaluation at 756-9254.\n\n\nInsert in I-3-700:\n\nI-3-711, dated October 18, 1991, through I-3-711 C. cont., dated October 18, 1991 (2 pages).\n\nDate: October 18, 1991",

The particular case to which that decision relates arose when the rules were differently formulated, and in a situation where the applicant had already given his consent to the version proposed by the Examining Division. However, what was said by the Enlarged Board in that case can be considered generally applicable to new requests put forward at a late stage of the proceedings, i.e. when the applicant has already had at least one opportunity to amend the application and the Examining Division has already completed substantive examination of the application (see\u00a0T\u00a01064\/04).\n\nIn particular, applying the principles of G\u00a07\/93 to amendments filed in response to the communication under Rule\u00a071(3) (see\u00a0C\u2011V,\u00a01\u00a0to\u00a03) means that this communication does not constitute an opportunity for the applicant to call into question the outcome of the earlier procedure. In deciding whether to admit such amendments, a balance must be struck between the applicant's interest in obtaining a patent which is valid in all of the designated states and the EPO's interest in bringing the examination procedure to a close by the issue of a decision to grant the patent. At this stage of the proceedings, the substantive examination has already been completed and the applicant has had the opportunity to amend the application and therefore normally only those amendments which do not appreciably delay the preparations for grant of the patent will be admitted under Rule\u00a0137(3). It is, however, appropriate to admit separate sets of claims for one or more designated States that made a reservation under Art.\u00a0167(2) EPC\u00a01973 (see\u00a0H\u2011III,\u00a04.4) or for which prior national rights exist (see\u00a0H\u2011III,\u00a04.5).\n\nThe rejection of amendments proposed by the Examining Division in a Rule\u00a071(3) communication which have been introduced without prior consultation and agreement of the applicant (C\u2011V,\u00a01.1) does not amount to a request for amendment to which discretion under Rule\u00a0137(3) applies.\n\nQuick Navigation",

        "text":"I. Introduction\n\nDialing 9-1-1 is the most familiar and effective way Americans have of finding help in an emergency. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires all Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to provide direct, equal access to their services for people with disabilities who use teletypewriters (TTYs), which are also known as \"telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDDs).\"\n\nThis document is part of a technical assistance program to provide State and local governments and persons with disabilities with information about the requirements of the ADA for direct, equal access to 9-1-1 for persons with disabilities who use TTYs. This guidance is an updated version of the Department of Justice's earlier guidance entitled, \"Commonly Asked Questions Regarding Telephone Emergency Services.\" It explains in practical terms how the ADA's requirements apply to 9-1-1 services, including equipment, standard operating procedures, and training, and should be useful to 9-1-1 service providers, equipment vendors, participating telephone companies, and individuals with disabilities.\n\nDifferent emergency providers may have different capabilities and features. For instance, some larger providers have \"Enhanced 9-1-1\" or \"E9-1-1,\" which automatically identifies for 9-1-1 call takers the telephone number and\/or address of callers. Some providers have call distribution systems, which place incoming calls in a queue and distribute them to the next available call taker. Other, smaller providers, may not have these capabilities. This guidance can be useful to all types of telephone emergency providers, both small and large.\n\nA. ADA Coverage of Telephone Emergency Services\n\nTitle II of the ADA covers telephone emergency service providers and other State and local government entities and instrumentalities. The Department's regulation is published at 28 C.F.R. Part 35. To obtain a copy of the ADA or its implementing regulations, or if you have questions about the ADA, contact the Department of Justice ADA Information Line at (800) 514-0301 (voice), or (800) 514-0383 (TTY), or access the Department's ADA Home Page.\n\nQ: What types of telephone emergency services are covered by Title II of the ADA?\n\nA: The phrase \"telephone emergency services\" applies to basic emergency service -- police, fire, and ambulance -- that are provided by public safety agencies, including 9-1-1 (or, in some cases, seven-digit) systems. Direct, equal access must be provided to all services included in the system, including services such as emergency poison control information.\n\nQ: In areas without 9-1-1 services, are PSAPs still required to provide access for TTY users to the telephone emergency services?\n\nA: Yes. Where 9-1-1 is not available and a PSAP provides emergency services via a seven-digit number, it still must provide direct, equal access to TTY callers. It may do so either by having one line for both voice and TTY calls, or it may provide two separate lines -- one for voice calls, and another for TTY calls. Requiring TTY callers to call a separate seven-digit number is not allowed in areas where 9-1-1 is offered, because having to dial a seven-digit number is not equal to the ease of having to dial the simple, familiar 9-1-1.\n\nAs with 9-1-1, services for TTY calls on seven-digit numbers must be as effective as those offered for voice calls in terms of time of response, hours of operation, and other features. Also, PSAPs must ensure that TTY numbers are publicized as effectively as voice numbers and displayed as prominently as voice numbers wherever telephone emergency numbers are listed.\n\nSeparate Telephone Lines for TTY Users\n\nQ: Can a PSAP dedicate a separate seven-digit line for TTY calls?\n\nA: Yes, but TTY users must also have direct, equal access to all call-taking positions on 9-1-1 lines. A PSAP cannot require TTY users to call a seven-digit number when voice callers may dial the more familiar 9-1-1.\n\nB. TTYs & Telephone Relay Services\n\nA TTY is a device that is used in conjunction with a telephone to communicate with persons who are deaf, who are hard of hearing, or who have speech impairments, by typing and reading text. To communicate by TTY, a person types his or her conversation, which is read on a TTY display by the person who receives the call. Both parties must have TTYs to communicate. When typing on a TTY, each letter is transmitted by an electronic code called Baudot, which is sent from the TTY on the sending end of the call through the telephone line in the form of tones to the TTY on the receiving end of the call, the same way voiced communications occur between two parties. The receiving TTY transforms the tones back to letters on a small display screen.\n\nCommunication between two persons using standard TTYs can only occur in one direction at a time. Thus, both persons who are conversing cannot type to each other at the same time; they must take turns sending and receiving. A person sending a communication by TTY indicates that he or she has finished transmitting by typing the letters \"GA,\" which stand for \"go ahead.\"\n\nA person can also use a computer with a TTY modem and related software to communicate with someone who has a TTY or who has a computer with TTY software and a modem. Computers generally operate in American Standard Code for Information Interexchange (ASCII), an electronic \"language.\" A person who uses ASCII must use an ASCII\/Baudot modem and related software to convert the ASCII code into Baudot code, in order to communicate with another person who is using a Baudot-based system. Similarly, a person who is using a Baudot-based TTY must utilize conversion software to communicate with a person using an ASCII-based computer.\n\nTelephone relay services are provided by States, as required by Title IV of the ADA, and are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Relay services involve a communications assistant who uses both a standard telephone and a TTY to type voice communication to a TTY user and read a TTY user's typed communication to a voice telephone user. Telephone relay services are not as effective for emergencies, because they are far more time-consuming than calls between two TTYs.\n\nQ: Does Title II require that telephone emergency service systems be compatible with all codes used for TTY communications?\n\nA: No. At present, telephone emergency services must only be compatible with the Baudot format. Until it can be technically proven that communications in another format can operate in a reliable and compatible manner in a given telephone emergency environment, a State or local government agency is not required to provide direct access to computer modems using formats other than Baudot.\n\nQ: Can PSAPs rely on State relay services to answer emergency calls from persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, or who have speech impairments?\n\nA: No. The Title II regulation specifically prohibits emergency telephone service providers from relying on relay services. Relay services do not provide \"direct access,\" because they require the services of a third party and are far more time-consuming than direct TTY calls. However, if a person placing a call to a PSAP voluntarily chooses to rely on a telephone relay service, the PSAP must answer and respond appropriately to such a call.\n\nII. Direct, Equal TTY Access\n\nA. General Requirements for Telephone Emergency Service Providers\n\nThe ADA regulation requires 9-1-1 or other telephone emergency service providers to provide TTY users with:\n\n  \u2022 direct access; and\n  \u2022 an opportunity to benefit from the emergency services that is equal to the opportunity afforded others.\n\nDirect access means that PSAPs can directly receive TTY calls without relying on an outside relay service or third-party services.\n\nEqual access means that the telephone emergency services provided for TTY users are as effective as those provided for persons who make voice calls, in terms of:\n\n  \u2022 response time;\n  \u2022 response quality;\n  \u2022 hours of operation; and\n  \u2022 all other features offered (e.g., automatic number identification, automatic location identification, automatic call distribution).\n\nDirect, equal access requires PSAPs to have the appropriate equipment to communicate with people who use TTYs. It also requires them to use the proper procedures and practices when TTY calls are received.\n\nB. Equipment\n\nNumber of TTYs\n\nIn order to afford equal access to TTY users, every call-taking position within a PSAP must have its own TTY or TTY-compatible equipment. PSAPs must have systems that enable call takers to handle TTY calls as properly, promptly, and reliably as voice calls. Every call-taking position needs its own TTY equipment because experience has shown that:\n\nWith TTY or TTY-compatible equipment at each call-taking position, call takers can handle TTY calls as effectively as voice calls. Call takers at PSAPs that had only one TTY per center had significant difficulties handling TTY calls within their standard answering time. Sharing a TTY among several call takers may result in undue delay in obtaining the TTY and connecting it to the answering position. Transferring a TTY call from a non-TTY-capable answering position to a TTY-dedicated position may result in the call being disconnected or undue delay in answering the call. In some cases, transfers may result in the loss of enhanced features, such as automatic number identification and automatic location identification information. Each call taker needs to query every silent, open line call as a potential TTY call, as described in Section D, below. Because most PSAPs receive many silent, open line calls, often more than one at a time, each calltaker must have his or her own TTY equipment to be able to query all of those calls with a TTY.\n\nThus, PSAPs may not provide TTY equipment at only a limited number of positions, such as, at only a supervisor's position, or at only one dedicated call taker's line. PSAPs must have systems that r... (truncated)",

Range Safety Gradings:\n   Grade A: The range meets all the criteria specified in JSP 403.\n   Grade B: The range does not fully meet the criteria specified in JSP 403 but its continued use does not present an unacceptable\n   hazard provided remedial action is taken as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n   Grade C: The range does not meet the essential safety criteria specified in JSP 403 to the extent that continued use presents an\n   unacceptable hazard. Before further use, the identified failings should be rectified and\/or control measures put in place; or a\n   dispensation should be granted.\n4. Current Status:\n   a) Closed: The range has been decommissioned, all documentation has been permanently withdrawn by the Range Authorising\n   Headquarters and Annex C to Chapter 6 of JSP 403 Vol I has been completed. No inspection required.\n   b) Temporarily Closed: MOD Form 905 and 906, and\/or other range documentation have been temporarily withdrawn by the\n   Range Authorising Headquarters or Range Administering Unit. Situation should be reported to DLRSC but no inspection is required.\n   c) Active: Where the range is in normal use; or when neither a. nor b. above is applicable, the Inspector should consider the range\n   to be active and a full range safety inspection and report should be completed.\n\n                                                             Page 1 of 10                                          OPEN RANGE\n                                                                                                                            SECTION 1\n     Range Serial No:                                     Range Name (if any):                                       Inspection Date:\n\n                                                     SECTION 1\n                                               RANGE DOCUMENTATION\n1.

Mandatory Classifications\n\nBy determining the proper classification designation of each claim in a patent separately, and then assigning each separate classification designation to the patent, you can be reasonably certain that the claimed subject matter contained in the patent is retrievable. Each such classification is a mandatory classification. The Original classification (OR) is selected from among the mandatory classifications as being the highest in the schedule (superiority) of the class containing the controlling claim (see Section IV, A, above). The remaining mandatory classifications are designated as cross-references (XR) and the patent documents are so labeled.\n\n\u00a0B. Discretionary Classifications\n\nAlso designated as cross-references are any number of additional classifications that are deemed appropriate by the classifier or examiner, within the guidelines set forth below. These cross-references may provide for disclosure not encompassed by the claims or for claimed subject matter that may be useful in classifications other than the mandatory classifications deter\u00admined by the placement procedures in Section V. The question of what unclaimed subject matter should be cross-referenced, and where, must be left to the judgment of the classifier or the examiner familiar with the art. Since there is a presumption that unclaimed subject matter is not new, it may be of little value. However, this is not always true, and much of this subject matter should be cross-referenced to make it available to a searcher. There are no exact rules. When, in the judgment of the classifier or examiner, the subject matter is useful and is disclosed in sufficient detail and clarity to be used as a reference, it should be cross-referenced.\n\n1. Cross-References to Any Part of System\n\nUnfamiliar subject matter should not be ignored. If a specific composition, electrical circuit, joint support, etc., is disclosed, it should not be assumed that it is conventional or not useful merely because it is not claimed. A classifier or examiner having experience in such unfamiliar art should be consulted to determine if a discretionary cross-reference would be useful.\n\n2. Cross-Referenced Subject Matter Should Fit Subclass Definition\n\nSubject matter cross-referenced to a subclass should fit the definition of the subclass.\n\nHowever, since the ultimate objective is to aid the searcher, a large amount of discretion may be used.\n\n\u00a03. Techniques Used to Limit Cross-Referencing\n\nIn creating the USPC system, several techniques have been used to limit the need for discretionary cross-referencing. These consist of (1) proper positioning of subclasses in a class schedule and (2) search notes.\n\na. Cross-Referencing Between Classes\n\nA search note in the class definition of each of related classes generally precludes the need for discretionary cross-referencing. However, as in all discretionary cross-referencing, there may be a time when it is desirable to cross-reference even if there is cross noting. For example, if a claim is classified in a combination class, it may be desirable to cross reference it to the subcombination class even if the locations are cross noted. A patent classified in a class providing for a subcombination (e.g., a machine tool chuck) should not necessarily be cross-referenced to a combination class (e.g., machine tool) solely on the basis of the subcombination.\n\nb. Cross-Referencing Between Subclasses\n\nThe following general considerations apply to the placement of discretionary cross-references:\n\n  \u2022 When two subclasses (either in the same or separate classes) contain subject matter related in structure or mode of operation but which are separated on different functional bases, the provision of a search note in each subclass referring to the other subclass generally precludes cross-referencing from either subclass to the other.\n  \u2022 Two coordinate subclasses may have a combination-subcombination relationship with the subcombination subclass title consisting of the identical terminology of a portion of the combination subclass title or a subclass indented thereunder. If a search note is provided in the subcombination subclass indicating that the combination subclass or the subclass indented thereunder must be searched when conducting a search for the subcombination, then no cross-references are made from the combination subclass, or subclass indented thereunder, to the subcombination. However, a disclosure of a combination in a patent placed in the subcombination subclass may be cross-referenced if it is believed to be useful.\n  \u2022 When two coordinate subclasses have a genus-species relationship (the species subclass appearing first in the schedule), generally no cross-reference of such species is made to the genus subclass.\n  \u2022 When there are two subclasses, the first of which contains a great number of patents having disclosures directed to subject matter which could be cross-referenced to the second subclass but which fact is not evident from the titles of the subclasses, a search note is generally provided in the definition of the second subclass indicating that the first subclass must be searched and no patents are cross-referenced from the first subclass to the second subclass.\n  \u2022 Generally, no cross-reference is made within a class when the relative schedule position of the subclasses involved indicates that a search for the disclosure would include both subclasses.\n\nIn each of the above situations, it is quite common to find one or two cross-references, irrespective of the presence of a search note. Classifiers frequently do this to alert a searcher who may have overlooked the search note to a pertinent field of search.\n\nc. Cross-Referencing Between a Parent Subclass and Its Indents\n\nThe two most frequent types of relationship between a parent subclass and subclasses indented under it are (a) combination-subcombination and (b) genus-species.\n\n(1) In a subclass array including a parent subclass and indented subclasses of the type involving the combination-subcombination relationship\u2014that is, where the indented subclass is directed to subject matter of the parent subclass combined with an additional feature or with a perfecting feature\u2014a claim to the combination will be placed, as original, in the indented subclass directed to the first claimed feature. If the claim also recites an unprovided for additional feature or perfecting feature, the claim may, by discretion, be cross-referenced in the parent subclass.\n\n(2) In a subclass array including a parent subclass and indented subclasses of the type involving the genus-species relationship \u2014i.e., where the parent subclass is directed to a genus and an indented subclass is directed to a species\u2014a claim to the species provided for in the indent and to an un-provided for species is classified originally in the parent subclass and cross-referenced in the indented subclass.\n\nd. Search Notes in a Subclass Do Not Preclude Cross-Referencing in Its Indents\n\nA note in a first subclass may indicate that a second subclass should be searched in connection with a search for the subject matter of the first subclass. This does not preclude cross-referencing of a patent from the second subclass to a subclass indented under the first subclass and directed to a specific variant thereof.\n\n\u00a0C. Original Designation\n\nOnly U.S. patent grants classified with \u201coriginal\u201d (OR) classifications in a subclass are accorded evidential value to construe titles, definitions, and notes of the subclass. This is because discretionary cross-references often reflect a great deal of subjective judgment on the part of an examiner or classifier, and there is no distinction made between mandatory and discretionary cross-references in the labeling of patent documents. Thus, for the purpose of (a) resolving differences as to placement of a patent application or a patent or (b) demonstrating separate classifications or divergent fields of search in an examiner\u2019s requirement for restriction, only patents placed as ORs may be cited. There is no difference at all, with respect to reference value in an Examiner\u2019s action, between an OR and XR patent.\n\n\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office\nThis page is owned by Office of Patent Classification.\nLast Modified: 10\/16\/2012 3:36:51 PM",
