        "text":"\u2018Be kind. Be resilient. Remember that mistakes are part of the process.\u2019 \u2013 ArtAttack Interviews SOLO Award winner, Victoria\u00a0Lucas\n\nAfter following the progression of this year\u2019s SOLO Award since the competition was first announced, we are so thrilled to share\u00a0that a winner has been selected!\n\nHopefully, you had a chance to view\u00a0the incredible shortlisted artists\u2019 works on our\u00a0ArtAttack\u00a0App, which we were honoured to exclusively showcase on the\u00a0\u2018Curated Art\u2019 page. Well, one of these talented creatives\u00a0is now the big winner! We are thrilled to introduce Victoria Lucas!\n\nVictoria Lucas, \u2018Lay of the land (and other such myths,\u2019 Detail of installation, Dimensions variable, 2016.\n\nVictoria is a Sheffield-based artist represented by Mark Devereaux Projects. She received her BA (hons) in Fine Art (Sculpture) from Norwich School of Art and Design in 2004, followed by her MFA Fine Arts from the University of Leeds in 2007. Currently, she is a Fine Art Lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston.\n\nVictoria\u2019s\u00a0artworks are often initiated by a physical encounter with a place, site or landscape. By concentrating\u00a0on these contexts and their current or former inhabitants, she develops conceptual narratives that subvert and categorise events and myths using a site\u2019s materiality as a catalyst.\n\nWe had the chance to speak with Victoria about her SOLO Award victory and greater artistic practice.\n\nArtAttack: What is your first memory of creating art and when did you decide you wanted to pursue art as a career?\n\nVictoria Lucas: My experiences in education played a significant role in steering me towards a career in the arts. The processes involved in art-making gave me a voice I felt I didn\u2019t have in other subjects, and enabled me to question and challenge specific aspects of my social and cultural environment. Invaluable guidance and support from academic tutors and technicians throughout further and higher education enabled me to refine these processes and develop a critically informed art practice.\n\nI have many memories of art-making, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call the resulting objects resolved artworks. That came much later, once I had learnt how to communicate and resolve ideas. I would probably say that the work I made for my MFA Degree Show at the University of Leeds back in 2007 was the first time I felt that I was an artist.\n\nAA:\u00a0How did you hear about the SOLO Award and how did you decide which of your works to submit for the prestigious prize?\n\nVL: My current project was devised after I received an invitation to develop a new video work for an exhibition in the Mojave Desert in California last September. I was awarded a semester long sabbatical from the University of Central Lancashire, where I currently hold an academic position, and I spent one month exhibiting and researching in California before returning to my Sheffield-based studio to develop a significant body of work and a PhD proposal. I have submitted work for the SOLO Award before and wasn\u2019t successful, but I feel that this current body of work is much more conceptually resolved than previous submissions \u2013 mainly as a result of the uninterrupted studio and research time that my sabbatical provided. I begin a part-time PhD at Sheffield Hallam University in October 2016.\n\nVictoria Lucas, \u2018Psychedelic Westerns,\u2019 Detail of photograph in installation, Dimensions variable, 2016.\n\nPsychedelic Westerns, detail of photograph in installation, dimensions variable, 2016\n\nAA:\u00a0Your winning piece, \u2018Lay of the land (and other such myths)\u2019 seems to be inspired by the American Western film genre. Can you tell me the inspiration\/reason behind this choice? I am especially interested in the feminist aspects you seem to allude to in the \u2018Women on Horses\u2019 portion.\n\nVL: The only desert experience I had before venturing to California last year was through cinematic portrayals. When developing the video work prior to travelling to Joshua Tree for the exhibition, I began to consider my impending experience as a woman alone in the desert through selected films shot in and around the Mojave Desert. The films I found repeatedly portrayed the female character as secondary to the male protagonist, who subsequently controls, dominates and manipulates the woman in different ways. Psychological distress is misrepresented as a female trait rather than the consequence of an unhealthy, oppressive relationship and women are framed as sexual objects through the mechanics of film. Most interestingly, the female characters are portrayed as vulnerable if left alone in the desert, susceptible to abuse, rape or death if caught by the wrong man without a chaperone. Unsurprisingly, all of the film directors are male.\n\nExperiencing the desert first hand was a completely different experience to the cinematic representations that had warned me to stay indoors. I stayed at the isolated gallery site alone for a number of nights. There were no technologies of gender, no cultural controls over my body, no gender specific self-awareness, no threat of being kidnapped, raped or murdered like the films warned. This landscape took away the oppressive nature of my socially constructed gender and allowed me to know myself for the first time without a cultural veil. Subsequently, I was drawn to the Alabama Hills in Owens Valley as a site because the area was specifically used as a Hollywood film set in the early to mid 20th Century. The Western film genre cinematically retells the history of the American West, from a specifically white male perspective, whilst omitting the voices of women. This layering of truth and imagination felt like a rich context in which to explore notions of gender.\n\nOne example of the work developed as part of this broader project includes \u2018Women on Horses\u2019 (2016), which comprises found footage extracted from westerns filmed in the Alabama Hills. Each woman has been \u2018rescued\u2019 from their aggressive male pursuers through the editing process, and by \u2018freeing\u2019 them they ride through the landscape alone and on their own terms.\n\nVictoria Lucas, \u2018Lay of the land (and other such myths),\u2019 Detail of installation, Dimensions variable, 2016.\n\nAA:\u00a0When putting together a dynamic installation such as \u2018Lay of the land (and other such myths)\u2019 what is your artistic process? How do you decide the various elements you want to include in the work?\n\nVL: The fluctuating seam between what is reality and what is fiction with reference to place-making is an important aspect of my work. Psychological, political, historical and fictional contexts form primary resource material, and areas of popular culture are examined against historical mythologies and assumptions that I feel impact significantly on the need for a more gender-neutral system. Various theorists and scholars inform this research.\n\nI am also currently taking inspiration from the film industry, for example the gold boulders and photographic partitions in \u2018Lay of the land (and other such myths)\u2019 refer to constructed film sets that frame events and actions. I am interested in what we don\u2019t see, or what is obstructed from view when depicting a place or landscape cinematically. Video is a fantastic medium because it provides me with the freedom to generate a utopian, fictional reality that imagines a new form of liberation \u2013 away from the controlling agendas that frame contemporary society.\n\nVictoria Lucas, \u2018Repeating, Site Responsive Video Installation,\u2019 Lopped video, 14 mins., 2015.\n\nAA:\u00a0Any advice you can give to emerging artists trying to navigate the art world?\n\nVL: Maintain a balanced perspective.\n\nBe kind.\n\nBe resilient.\n\nRemember that mistakes are part of the process.\n\nBe critically informed and work hard.\n\nThe rest will follow.\n\nVictoria Lucas, \u2018Body\/Image,\u2019 Photographic Series (work in progress), 2016.\n\n\u2013 India Irving\n\nVictoria Lucas\u2019 winning\u00a0work, \u2018Lay of the land (and other such myths),\u2019 will be on view at her very own stall at the London Art Fair 2017 from 18-22 January.\n\nFor more on Victoria:\n\n\n\nFor more on the SOLO Award:\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"Sophy DiPinto, Fine Art Bookbinder\n\nSophy DiPinto is part\u00a0of our portrait\/interview series with\u00a0Emily \"Birdie\" Busch.\u00a0\n\nBirdie's challenge is to\u00a0tease\u00a0out candid\u00a0responses\u00a0from fellow artistic, industrious women. What muses! A link to all the interviews is at the end of this page.\n\n\nSophy DiPinto had a circuitous route to bookbinding. She graduated from University of the Arts in 1990 with a BA in Fine Arts, journeyed through the underground rock and experimental art scene, and back to one of her original loves.\n\nHer visual art persona BookGrrl is a hybrid, nodding to her shy and bookish side whilst honoring her more extroverted role as the co-owner of Dipinto Guitars whose home storefront currently resides on Girard Avenue in the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia. It\u2019s an institution for local musicians, like myself, and I have had my 1958 Electric Kay guitar serviced there and have always found myself googly eyed over the handmade guitars on the walls as I went to drop mine off.\n\nBut for this piece, more than guitars I dove into the intricate makings of Sophy\u2019s BookGrrl Bindery and her bound art books.\u00a0\n\nSophy's\u00a0links:\n\nHer interest in books as objects of art began in adolescence. Raised in a family of academics, her father an amateur binder, she had some amazing tools passed on to her and a love of being surrounded by books as a physical environment. A lot of her pondering deals with our evolving relationship with books, our current digital age, and reimagining how books can be used or perceived. I.e. A piece in her collection that is a reworking of pre-existing books, a kind of spliced and diced patchwork, is rebound and titled, \u201cYour World Explained to You\u201d by The Rich White Men Who Own It. Another piece entitled \u201cSociety Face the Future\u201d\u00a0 is a book rebound with old statistical graphs on the top half of the pages juxtaposed by flattened food wrapping sewn on to the bottom half, a kind of stark history meets present visualization.\u00a0\n\nBookGrrl Bindery is a mainstay in the Philadelphia Craft Scene. In addition to her more esoteric art pieces she also uses a lot of repurposed covers for creating journals, iPad covers, and boxes.\u00a0\n\nAs she says in her artist statement, \u201cMost people are not avid readers and yet they mourn the loss of books, what are they really mourning?\u00a0 With my work I seek to strip down books into the elements that people relate to in order to re-forge the connection, and also maybe point out that the past was not always so great, and maybe some things should be let go.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat is a career\/creative moment you are proud of?\u00a0\n\nFor my BookGrrl work,\u00a0 definitely getting my work picked up by the Philadelphia Art Museum gift shop was a big deal. I have been bookbinding in some form or another since college, it\u2019s only been in the past 5 years or so that I started really making a push to get my work out there and grow it beyond a side project into an actual business.\n\n\nAbove: Sophy is wearing National Picnic's midsection-y modern tee and Tencel palazzos.\n\nAs far as DiPinto Guitars is concerned, it\u2019s always a surprise to me when I look back on the company.\u00a0 We have been in business for over 25 years now and every day I am astonished that we are still going strong. The pandemic has been tough for us to be sure, but we have weathered so many storms over the years, it\u2019s just another one to cross off the list.\n\nWhat are you listening to now? What are you looking at? What recipe\u00a0 you feeling?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI have been listening to way too many news podcasts!! This has been such a stressful and confusing year, in all aspects of life I have been gravitating toward the old favorites, comfort food, things that offer some sense of normalcy and stability.\u00a0\n\nRight now I have bluegrass and old-timey country in rotation. Ralph Stanley, Doc Watson, Bill Monroe, but also some Holly Golightly and Freakwater thrown in for good measure, that sort of thing.\u00a0 I think right now I\u2019m drawn to the timelessness of that sort of music, it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s stuck in any particular decade or era. And while I\u2019m not listening to much new music, I really really miss going to shows!\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to see live music again!\n\nWhat am I looking at? I have a reproduction copy of Owen Jones \u2018Grammar of Ornamentation\u2019 that I could look at all day long.\n\nAs far as reading, my mom got me started on a Nancy Mitford kick, she was a contemporary of Eveyln Waugh, and has the same lighthearted yet devastating way of storytelling.\u00a0 I also just read \u2018Wow, no thank you\u2019 by Samantha Irby, it was a quick, hilarious read.\n\nMy new favorite recipe is Korean style oven-fried rice, it\u2019s easy to make and super yum! I am vegetarian, so I just substitute vegetarian sausage, it\u2019s great!\n\nI also just got a big bag of lentils, so I want to try a bunch of lentil recipes this winter.\n\nHow do you define your own personal style or approach to clothes?\n\nI can be super fussy about my clothes.\u00a0 I want to be comfortable, but for me a big part of being comfortable is also feeling that I\u2019m put together well.\u00a0 It\u2019s a little bit of a feedback loop, if I feel like I look good, well, that goes a long way to making me feel comfortable. It works the other way too, if I don't feel like I look good that can make me super uncomfortable, so anymore I am very particular about only getting clothes that, as they say, spark joy, and resisting those that don't. And it has to have pockets!!\n\nWhat would be your advice to a teenage girl clothing and style wise that you wish you had received?\u00a0\n\nSo much confidence comes from how you see yourself, if you are comfortable in your clothes you are that much more likely to be comfortable in your own skin.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean comfortable as in sweatpants, I mean comfortable as in \u2018this is what I want to be wearing\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, could be over the knee boots with 5\u201d heels or a pair of old Birkenstocks, if that is what you want the world to see you wearing, your clothes will make you happy.\n\n\nAbout the interviewer:\nEmily \"Birdie\" Busch\u00a0is\u00a0one of\u00a0National Picnic's\u00a0social content contributors.\u00a0Living\u00a0in Germantown, Philadelphia, she has been\u00a0songwriting\u00a0and recording independent music for a solid decade. She has created a constellation of connect-the-dots that has people listening to her music all over the world.\u00a0Read\u00a0Birdie's extended\u00a0bio here.\nWe put together a guide that lists\u00a0our muses's businesses, art, or merchandise that you can eat, drink, collect, or support.\u00a0Click here for the guide.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nPlease note, comments must be approved before they are published",

My intention is to capture what I'm perceiving in others around me and I intent to tell a story as it unfolds.

        "text":"Production Designer, alum Patrick Hanenberger behind \u2018Rise of the Guardians\u2019 look and feel\n\nby November 20th, 2012\n\nEven if you\u2019ve missed all the great stories in the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly,\u00a0you\u2019ve no doubt heard that DreamWorks Animation\u2019s latest film Rise of the Guardians\u2014which takes childhood fantasy figures like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny and reimagines them as mythological heroes in an epic fantasy adventure\u2014comes out in theaters Wednesday, Nov. 21.\n\nAnd right in the middle of all that legendary action is the film\u2019s production designer, Art Center\u2019s own Patrick Hanenberger, who graduated from the College in 2003 with a degree in Transportation Design and is currently teaching a\u00a0Visual Communication course.\n\nWe recently caught up with Hanenberger to ask him about his role in Guardians, how he ended up working in animation and which lessons from Art Center have stuck with him.\n\nDotted Line: First of all, how did you go from being a Transportation Design student to a production designer for animated films?\n\nPatrick Hanenberger: I studied Transportation Design at Art Center and it taught me problem solving, 3D modeling, sculpting, sketching, designing around the human figure, rendering, research and most importantly presentation. These are all skills I use on a daily basis and are universal in any kind of design field. I always knew I wanted to work in movies and animated movies are great for designers since every single little detail needs to be designed and modeled. During Art Center I developed my portfolio to be very content based, which meant I always designed my vehicles for a specific story. After graduation I got a job as a visual development artist and from there on over the last eight years worked my way up to become production designer.\n\nDL: What did your role as production designer on Rise of the Guardians entail?\n\nPH: As production designer you are in charge of the design of the movie. Along with many talented artists you design everything from characters to environments, costumes and color palettes. Basically you are in charge of the overall look and visual feel of the movie and work with almost every department to realize it along the way.\n\nDL: What was your biggest challenge on Rise of the Guardians?\n\nPH: The movie was incredibly complex and very ambitious. We wanted to created a Lord of the Rings meets Avatar for kids. Both of those inspirations are massively daunting.\u00a0Re-designing the icons of childhood was also a very difficult task. We wanted these mythological characters to feel contemporary and meaningful\u2014something kids today could relate to and understand; not idealized and romanticized.\n\nDL: Are there any specific lessons or instructors from Art Center that you constantly think back to while working on your projects?\n\nPH: I still quote some of my most influential teachers all the time. The biggest thing I tried to infuse into our art department was the \u201clearn to learn\u201d attitude which Bob Kato hammered into my head when I was a student\u2014never stay put, constantly challenge yourself and teach yourself to improve yourself. A big influence on me was also Frido Beisert and his work ethic.\n\nDL: What do you teach in your Visual Communication 6 course?\n\nPH: Karen Hofmann and I are designing a new class which re-thinks the traditional Visual Communication class a bit. The class still teaches students how to most effectively present their work, but it does so in a more sequential way. Students are given time constraints for their presentations and have to do a different pitch every week, using a different technique (e.g. a simple animation, story board pitch or sizzle reel). The class is also entirely Web-based so students present their homework every week from their website.\n\nDL:\u00a0Any advice for prospective or current students interested in following in your footsteps?\n\nPH: Work hard and be nice. Your skills are only 50% of the battle. You need to have excellent communication, problem solving and presentation skills. You also need to be able to take direction and adapt to ever changing work environments. You also need to be a pleasant person to be around since the world is a village and this industry is tiny.\n\nFor more on Rise of the Guardians\u2014on which current Entertainment Design student Perry Maple also worked as a concept artist\u2014visit the film\u2019s website.\n\n\nVisionary director Zack Snyder stops by Art Center\n\n\u2018Tron\u2019 at 30: How Art Center helped power the grid\n\n\u2018Little Miss Sunshine\u2019 directors talk filmmaking from script to screen\n\nPrint Friendly\nBookmark and Share\n\nOne Response to \u201cProduction Designer, alum Patrick Hanenberger behind \u2018Rise of the Guardians\u2019 look and feel\u201d\n\n  1.

        "text":"Andrea Talmelli, composer and president of Society of Italian contemporary music shares his fascination about composing and creativity.\n\nAndrea Talmelli\nWhat does music mean to you personally?\n\nA natural need that I always felt when I met music and decided to live with her. The joy of listening, playing, writing and communicating with music has led to the weakening of so many other important interests in my life.\n\nDo you agree that music is all about fantasy?\n\nWithout serious study, consistency and research continue, the imagination, even when it is recognized, may not be enough or will end very soon. Of course, fantasy is a preliminary and indispensable condition for expressing this creative talent that is part of being an artist.\n\nIf you were not a professional musician, would would you have been?\n\nHard to say why the choices I could have made were many but I did not do it for the need that I had to live this adventure with music. I graduated in law and was offered a job as a bank manager. I refused. But I can not say how much this is due to the fact that we sneak into our lives by often deciding for ourselves or with ourselves.\n\nThe classical music audience is getting old, are you worried about your future?\n\nI do not worry about the future if we think there will always be people, young and old, who will love music and classics in particular. I notice it when I give \"listening\" lessons to people of all ages and all walks of life who follow me with indisputable pleasure and interest. I'm worried, though, because I know we live in a society that does everything to make learning more complex and cultured music more difficult. This affects the ability of people to grow and improve.\n\nWhat do you envision the role of classical music to be in the 21 century? Do you see that there is a transformation of this role?\n\nThings could get worse because it is the society itself that takes directions that I do not always like: technological progress is important, but it produces too strong acceleration that often confuses values and the connections, and which represent a challenge for the psychophysical possibilities of people to control them. Power is concentrated more and more in the hands of the few, and they have no heart to emancipate people from old and new conditions, which can also be misery and cultural and moral poverty. I would not like to be pessimistic and generally am not. But I wonder what music could do if world was really going in this direction.\n\nWhen I say that classical music is searching for new ways, what would come to your mind?\n\nMusical art is always and always its time, so we must understand its reasons, even when it manifests itself in forms that we try to understand and accept. And it will be time to say for yourself what's left of this incessant creative becoming beyond fashion and business.\n\nDo you think that the classical musician today needs to be more creative? Whats the role of creativity in the musical process for you?\n\nThe role of creativity is central and decisive. It has always been. Not only in art. It is in all the human sciences, in research and even in social and political life. Unfortunately, we often forget our two cerebral hemispheres, one of which concerns only creative intuition. This is not only complementary to the cognitive-linear one. I think that writing music as well as listening involves balancing the two aspects of our mental process.\n\nDo you think we musicians can do something to attract young generation into the classical music concerts? How will you proceed?\n\nEach of us can do our part, according to our own abilities. The school, the composers, the performers, the producers who now have more responsibilities because of the many resources of technological innovations, including the Internet. But I was also going to extend the field to public and private administrators, advertising and sponsorship of classical music not only by benefactors but also by cultural investors.\n\nTell us about your creative process. How did you start working on your favourite composition?\n\nCertainly my sacred song \"If it's a man\" written in youth on the emotional wave of reading Primo Levi's book that I had the pleasure of personally experiencing and discussing with him the fundamental theme of \"memory\" . I started working after meeting important works on this subject by authors such as Penderecki, Nono, Petrassi and Shostakovich.\n\nWe, Moving Classics TV, love the combination of classical music with different disciplines: music and painting, music and cinematography, music and digital art, music and poetry. What do you think about these combinations?\n\nThis is one of the most interesting novelties of our time, the fusion of different artistic expressions. This often requires synergy between different artists who can collaborate together by changing the traditional way of understanding the artist. Thanks to technology advancing at impressive rates, we now have a wealth of experience in this regard. But beware, because it's getting harder and harder to distinguish something that's really original and creative today beyond the fascination of wonders than the many things you can do with technology, but can also become commonplace too early.\n\nCan you give advice to young people who want to discover classical music for themselves?\n\nOnly a few of them can do it on their own, if they already have a solid training. I recommend experiencing the excitement of going to live concerts that are always very useful if you want to listen to the most established repertoire from the history of music. But I think it should be a serious school, which is not put at the service of commercial fashion, which could \"educate\"young people to listen to classical music. When that happens, the results are incredibly numerous, but that's why they also need competent teachers.\n\nNow it is a common practice in the media to talk that the classical music is getting into the consumption business, do you agree? We are speaking about the supply and demand rules and how to sell your \u201cproduct\u201d in your case your compositions. How do you see it?\n\nIt is right that there is also demand and supply in art. After all, there has always been this rule. The thing, however, is very complicated because today's rules are too focused on 'consuming' by the need to reach as many buyers as possible; a commercial law that too often reduces the quality of art. It is right, therefore, to protect, even with the appropriate financial support, the serious work of many artists who work independently of these requirements. It would be really bad to lose this freedom and this creative effort, a condition sine qua non for the quality of art and the evolution of languages.\n\nDo you have expectations what regards your listeners, your audience?\n\nOf course. Recover as much as possible an essential relationship of communication through music without losing honesty to myself and what I want to express again.\n\nWhat projects are coming up? Do you experiment in your projects?\n\nI always like to have an excuse to write offered by other artistic expressions: the combination with poetry certainly, but also with painting. Recently, I made a compositional triptych on Composition VIII of Kandinskj. But I also like to experiment with creativity using new tools such as those offered by computer music. Although somewhat scary for the infinite universe of possibilities it presents. Country:\n\nPosted in Piano and tagged ,",

        "text":"The Palm Has Grown Bigger Than Me. Joanna Rajkowska in conversation with Dorota Jarecka\n\n18.09.2007, Warszawa (Gazeta Wyborcza)\n\nphot. Jacek Piotrowski\n\nI wanted them to stop repeating like a mantra that they've come here to see Auschwitz and ask instead, \u2018Why are you digging this hole?'\n\nOn Plac Grzybowski in Warsaw, where the Jewish quarter used to be, where today there's a church, a lawn, a taxi rank, the exit of the once-busy and now empty street called Pr\u00f3\u017cna, you set up the Oxygenator, a pond. Water spray floats over it, the aerating machine hums silently. Is it a park feature? A monument? Is it connected with the history of the place?\n\nPlac Grzybowski is a dead zone. Winos come here to lie on the benches, people walk their dogs here, or wait for the bus, but it won't occur to anyone to take a blanket and lie on the grass. I didn't want to make a monument because any monument will kill this place. On this square, Marek Edelman supposes, the last battle of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising took place. It's a traumatised place but it isn't the historical trauma that's the problem but rather the fact that it's never been worked through. I don't have to know history to realise that something is wrong here, that it isn't a normal part of town. Just look at how people move here. My mistrust of language is profound, but I trust the body. I watch places and what they do to our bodies. You don't want to be here, you stiffen.\n\nPlac Grzybowski is cut off from the city, the streets that start here are dead-end streets, like Pr\u00f3\u017cna or Bagno. It's no man's land, nobody's place.\n\nThe Oxygenator is to change this?\n\nIt did so even during the preparations. The square is on the intersection of many routes, but the people moving along them never meet.\n\nIsraeli tourist groups pass through the square, accompanied by armed bodyguards. The Israelis go down Pr\u00f3\u017cna to the synagogue on Twarda, or in the opposite direction. There's no way anyone can wander off from the group. It always struck me as odd that they smiled at my dog but even the dog wasn't a reason good enough to start a conversation. In the spring, we had to carry out excavation works on the square, it was the conservation officer's requirement. A hole one metre deep was dug up. That was already a pretext to come and talk. The bodily mechanics suddenly started changing, people started to lean, to hunker down. And that was my point, to cause them to stop repeating like a mantra that they've come here to see Auschwitz and ask instead, \u2018Why are you digging this hole?'. I told them the simple story: there'd be a pond, flowers, ozone, spray. Polish Jews talked to an archaeologist who recounted the history of the place to them: that in late 18th century the town hall of the Grzyb\u00f3w jurisdiction stood here, then a market with wooden stalls, replaced, in the interwar period, by a beautiful green square, replaced, during the siege of Warsaw in September 1939, by a graveyard, later exhumed. You could see remnants of coffins in the ground. The elder residents knew the history of the All Saints Church which had a heroic record during the war - the parish priest, Father Godlewski, saved Jews, sent three thousand Jewish children to the Aryan side.\n\nI had a clash with the former curate of that church, the one who allowed the Antyk bookstore, which sold anti-Semitic literature, to operate there. He made a terrible scene that I didn't ask him for permission to build a pond in front of the church. That bookstore was one of the reasons for making the Oxygenator - the suffocating, hypocritical atmosphere, the toxin.\n\nI realised that the local residents hated the Israeli groups. The coaches park in front of the church. The parking lot is a major nuisance because they never turn the engines off. The air is heavy with exhaust fumes. I went to them myself, asking them to turn the engines off lest we suffocate.\n\nPeople came up to me to ask whether we were building a monument of the victims of the Volhynia massacres. When they learned we weren't, they were happy.\n\nThe square is a potential meeting place for very different people - Catholics, Polish Jews, Israelis, the Vietnamese who live in large numbers in the nearby Za \u017belazn\u0105 Bram\u0105 estate. My idea was to create a place where they don't have to seek consensus but can be as they are - with their different mindsets, different memories - and yet they can feel each other's presence. I wanted the illusion of a heavenly place where you breathe fresh air.\n\nWarsaw is full of traumatic places. Should we set up ponds in all of them?\n\nIf I was to build the Warsaw of my dreams, I'd cut through the blocks to make corridors and open the old routes, the kind of by-passes, which would make it possible to feel the organism of the city, because the city is a bloodstream. You can find its remnants in language. I love the sound of street names like Wilcza, Ho\u017ca, Aleje Jerozolimskie, T\u0142omackie, Szmulki, the way Varsovians pronounce them. There's exoticism in them because they're Polish, Jewish, Russian at the same time. My father's family comes from Warsaw. After the Uprising they were put in a transition camp with other civilians, and then they escaped from a transport to Auschwitz. Before the war, my great-grandfather and grandfather were dentists, prosperous ones, lived on Marsza\u0142kowska, where there was the office and then, in the next room - it was an enfilade apartment - a gambling joint. It is probably from them that I've inherited the gene of zing, risk, and destruction. When I moved here from Cracow, I was firm I'd live in Aleje Jerozolimskie. I thought that if I had a number of street names to choose from, then let it be this one. That apartment was like the railway switch, I got divorced in it. In 2000, I moved to Praga, to a loft without heating and bathroom. I had a crisis there, nothing to write about.\n\nTwo years later, you placed the palm tree in Aleje Jerozolimskie. Are these events connected?\n\nNo, they aren't. The palm was a consequence of my trip to Israel. I went there with Artur \u017bmijewski in March 2001. I was on holiday, he was pursuing his plan to visit kibbutzim and the local Holocaust memory rooms where you can see documentary films from the war and a piece of soap made from human fat.\n\nWe spent a couple of weeks in Jerusalem, in the hotel by the Damascene Gate, in the Arab part of town. It's a famous place because that's where Palestinian activists and Israeli dissidents meet - such as Mordechai Vanunu, for instance. The hotel is run by Hishan, an Arab, who this year got hit by a rubber bullet on some barricade and is paralysed. Only we didn't know about all this at the time, for us it was just an ordinary sleazy hotel full of tourists. I looked at them, listened to their conversations, and felt sick. They were like an island, completely detached from the reality at hand. And yet when we were there, you could the cannonade over Bethlehem all the time. We'd buy a beer, go to the park. Every time we sat on the bench, there was an explosion. We used to joke there was a button in the bench that activated the explosion. We wanted to understand something. We talked to Jews, to Arabs. You can't comprehend what's going on there. Everyone has his story, and everyone is right. At the same time, we couldn't leave the place, we got the \u2018Jerusalem syndrome', something kept us there, we delayed the departure date several times.\n\nAfter coming back we tried to write an essay about the political situation in Israel. We couldn't finish it. I remember how we sat in Artur's stuffy apartment, the sun was bursting through the windows, I was pacing the room, and suddenly I say, \u2018Let's write that the conclusion of our trip will be to plant a row of palm trees alongside Aleje Jerozolimskie!'. When I came home, I thought, hey, that's a great idea.\n\n\nSuddenly I realised where I was. What the name \u201cAleje Jerozolimskie' meant. Something clicked. I went to the library on Koszykowa and started reading. It was like that: in 1772, the year of Poland's greatest misfortune, August Su\u0142kowski set up a settlement for Jews beyond the bounds of town. It was called Nowa Jerozolima and was located roughly where the street Towarowa runs today. It survived two years. The Jews did great and became a competition for the Warsaw merchants and artisans. The merchants sued Su\u0142kowski for harming their interests by setting up the settlement. They won. The houses were destroyed, the Jews driven out, the property confiscated. But the name remained. First Droga Jerozolimska, then Aleja Jerozolimska, and finally Aleje Jerozolimskie.\n\nYou know, for me it's always these flashes of intuition. I trust thinking freed from the rational mode. Only then do I start analysing what I came up with and start to calculate. The row of palm trees was unrealistic. I decided it had to be a single tree, placed at some distance from the passers-by so that you had to make an effort to reach it. Rondo de Gaulle'a was a perfect place. It was to be like a girl from a rural suburb, impudent and kitschy. We measured the proportions of the surrounding buildings with architect Micha\u0142 Rudnicki to define the proper height. We wanted it to be lofty and strange, that's why it's so tall.\n\nThe palm, unveiled on December 12, 2002, proved highly controversial. Threatened by removal several times, attacked, defended. Did you expect it'd be perceived as a political provocation?\n\nNot at all! I was a virgin in terms of working in public space. I only knew that I had done it, that I had debts, that the leaves were too short, and that I had to dissociate myself from the whole thing not to go mad. The web forums were full of shit. When I saw a Christmas show on TV with the palm in the background, I called TVP to complain: how can they use my palm on Rondo de Gaulle'a as a Christmas decoration!\n\nI didn't realise that a work placed in public space, even if under the CCA's patronage, functions in completely different way than an exhibition in Uj...

        "text":"Interview with studio photographer Helen\u00a0Thurwell!\n\nWe recently held a press day for the main cast of The Sweet Shop at MWS Studios. Within the very busy day, our photographer Helen Thurwell set up her studio and took shots of the actors in character. You can read an interview with Helen by clicking \u2018read more\u2019.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n1. How did you get involved with the project?\n\nI had worked previously with one of the Production team.\u00a0 Tom was pleased with the work I did and asked me if I would like the opportunity to do the stills for the film.\n\n2. As a follow up, can you please tell the readers how you got your start in\u00a0photography?\n\nI used to work in a structural design department and one of the guys there sold me his old film camera for \u00a3300.\u00a0 I sent a couple of pictures off to some national magazines and they got in.\u00a0 I decided I preferred it to design work so I quit and went back to college.\u00a0 While I was at college I spent a lot of time building up my portfolio and got my first paid booking a couple of months after finishing through my website designer.\u00a0 It was a portfolio for the NUTS girl of the year and I was so nervous I nearly dropped my camera!\u00a0 That was a few years ago now and my business has gone from strength to strength.\u00a0 Photography is all about Networking, you can\u2019t just be a good Photographer, you need to be good at talking to people as well.\u00a0\u00a0 You also need to push yourself outside your comfort zone.\n\n3. What sort of preparations did you do before the project and how familiar were you\u00a0with the cast members before getting the job?\n\nI used to watch Gemma as Lisa on Hollyoaks.\u00a0 I looked on the Internet at the cast members to see what pictures were there and what worked.\u00a0 I spoke to the team about what was needed from the shoot and planned how much time it would take.\n\n4. Taking on a project as different as Film Photography it must have been a daunting\u00a0task. What were some of the concerns you had starting out and what were your biggest\n\ngoals for the project? It was a daunting task, but actually it wasn\u2019t as scary as a Wedding! The key was good planning.\u00a0 The shots needed to be showing the character the cast were playing.\u00a0 This meant we could really have some fun with Susan who plays a model, getting some really Zany and strong model poses, in contrast Gemma\u2019s character was quite girl next door so it was important to communicate this in the images.\n\n5. There have been a lot of changes in recent years in camera technology with the\u00a0transition from film to digital. What camera did you use for the project and do you\u00a0prefer the old style cameras that did not do as much of the work?\n\nI love the way that film is valued so differently to digital.\u00a0 Each picture had a lot more thought go into it, whereas with digital you can just press a delete button and that shutter click cost no money.\u00a0 I used a Canon 50D for the shoot.\u00a0 When I first started out I was using a 350D which is arguably a consumer end S.L.R camera.\u00a0 I think the most important thing is knowing how to take a great picture.\u00a0 I got fantastic results with that camera, as I knew it inside out. If you have a top spec camera and only ever use it on automatic it is like driving a Ferrari with a 30mph speed restrictor.\n\n6. How was working with Gemma and the other cast members and what were some moments\u00a0that stood out?\n\nWhen I first walked in I was a bit nervous and overcompensated by walking around grinning at nothing and shaking everyone\u2019s hand I probably appeared slightly deranged. Susan Hoecke was hilarious, the moment that really stood out was when I was doing Gemma and Seb\u2019s photos together and Susan came bursting in shouting at Gemma get off my man! She had a really great personality.\u00a0 Working with all the cast was great, as they just knew how to pose and have fun in front of the camera.\u00a0 The worst bit was when my lights stopped firing when I was doing Gemma\u2019s pictures, but she was really chilled and laid back about it and it was soon fixed. Vanessa was a real extrovert, which was great, as so was the character she was playing! Matt was a naturally very funny and down to earth, he was so relaxed and patient. Seb was lovely and I did fall in love with him a bit! I think he will be one to watch, as this is his first film.\n\n10. With your character portraits, what did you attempt to capture about each\u00a0character and did you have a favorite?\n\nMy favorite character to Photograph was Susan\u2019s as we could really go so over the top with the poses. \u00a0I found Gemma the hardest to portray as I needed to find something to pick out and almost make a caricature of for the photos, for instance like I did with Matt and using a camera with a wide angle lens to give a crazy perspective. It was hard to do this with Gemma as her character was almost a polar opposite to Susan\u2019s and I also needed to depict this.\u00a0 I ended up using less contrast in the editing to give a softer feel to the images and going for the more traditional poses, as her character was more traditional than the others.\n\n11. What does black and white photography offer as opposed to color in your opinion?\n\nYou can create mood and atmosphere simply by taking a colour image, turning it black and white and making the black areas really black.\u00a0 I used this technique with Matt\u2019s pictures to give him a slightly sinister edge to his character. The really over contrasted strong black and white images are great for showing a really strong character. I put less contrast into Gemma\u2019s black and whites for a softer more feminine pure feel. Black and White images can look really classy, contemporary or Traditional so they are very diverse.\n\n12. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently and if so, what?\n\nI think I would have worked with two camera bodies if I did this type of shoot again, as normally I don\u2019t change my lens too often in a shoot but this was different and it would have saved time.\n\n13. What projects do you have upcoming?\n\nThis month, I have a Wedding booking Saturday and I am also doing a booking at Newbury Racecourse for M.W.S media this week. I have a family portrait on Sunday, two proms and a 60th birthday party. I also have a fashion shoot for a shop in a field! \u00a0On top of this I am going back to school for the day to talk about working as a freelancer.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nYou can find Helen\u2019s website at www.helensarah.com and she is MWS Media\u2019s choice for any photography that we do.\n\n\nOne Response to \u201cInterview with studio photographer Helen\u00a0Thurwell!\u201d\n\n  1.

I\u2019m having\n2-3 exhibitions in the year time. I\u2019m photographing\npeople for 18 years now. All that you can name a portrait.\n\nTwo years ago Mikolaj Grynberg started working on his project Many Women.\nIt started with a series of pictures of various women form the artist\u2019s closest\ntitled Many Women-Warsaw. The photos were exhibited at a train\nstation in Rio de Janeiro.\nNext to them the artist set up an ad hoc photo\natelier, to which he would invite\nfemale passers-by. They thus became\nsubjects for the next photo-series.\nThe brasilian even was a happening,\nthe spectators were random passers-by,\njournalists and invited guests.\nThe Central De Brasil show lead to creating another exhibit,\n\nMany Women \u2013 Rio\n, very different form the Polish sequence as it was\na photo-record\nof random and unique encounters. Mikolaj Grynberg decided to continue and expand his project. In urban\nspaces all around the world the artist repeats the scenario form\nRio de Janeiro: he shows the exhibit Many Women \u2013 Warsaw and\nat the same time invites random local women to be photographed\non the spot. Within last four months Grynberg has finished a few\nnext, very successful parts of this project in Kiev \/Ukraine\/,\nMexico City \/Mexico\/ and Lima \/Peru\/.\nMany Women is a testimony of emotions that occur during a unique\n20 minute encounter between the artist and each of the photographed\nwomen. Time from being noticed in the crowd to exposing the last of\n12 film frames. Teasing curiosity, fascination, shyness, joy, pride,\nmelancholy, even anger and desire captured in a black and white\nframe. Universal emotions, where geographical and political borders\nvanish. The photos are made in b&w and are the lith prints.\n\ninvited by Joanna Kinowska\nup to you: we're looking for a strong support to realize this\nproject in Sweden. Any ideas? The media patron of the project\nis \"Wysokie obcasy\" magazine and the main support is from\nthe Promotional Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Poland.\n\ngruppo F inbox: Walter, Shanghai, China\n\nClose but far away\n\nthe loud silence\n\nIf you take a car.\nDrive for ten hours to the north from Stockholm.\nThen take on your cross country skies.\nAnd ski for about one hour, mostly up hill.\nThen cross some creeks,\npass some scooter trails,\nsome sleeping bears.\n\nIf you do that.\nAnd you are still alive.\nYou might end up in this place.\n\nHere where the silence is more present than anywhere else.\nLoud even.\n\nHere it is just traces of civilisation\nIt is almost like one of those diseases,\none of those where the body is repelling a part of the body.\n\nThis is the repelled part.\nA lost limb.\n\nThe place where our civilisation said:\n\u2013Hey, no one could possibly want to live there anyway\u2026\nWe outsource it to somewhere closer.\nAnd call it Skansen or whatever.\nThen we have it within reach.\nSafe and packaged.\n\nBut just like the sandwiches wrapped in plastic.\nIt doesn\u2019t taste quite as good.\nNot quite the same.\n\nSo every year\nI come here, by car and skies.\nVisiting the repelled part.\n\nAnd I listen to the loud silence.\n\nPhotos and thoughts: christofer grandin\n\n[Soldiers] A Pro Ad",
