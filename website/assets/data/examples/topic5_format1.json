        "text":"Pentax K-5 IIs\u00a0Review\n\nApril 3, 2013 | Mark Goldstein | |\n\nReview Roundup\n\nReviews of the Pentax K-5 IIs from around the web. \u00bb\n\nI reviewed the Pentax K-5 II in November 2012 and found it to be an excellent DSLR, well worth the Editor's Choice accolade. Pentax have been bold in introducing the IIs variant which, like the Nikon D800E, is an option with no anti-aliasing (AA) filter to reduce the full sharpness potential of the sensor.\nRead the full review \u00bb \u00bb\n\nIn our review of the Pentax K-5 II, we briefly touched on the camera's sister model, the K-5 IIs. The IIs is identical to the K-5 II except that its anti-aliasing filter has been removed. In practice, this should increase sharpness, with the possible side-effect of aliasing, moir\u00e9, and other image artifacts. We've seen this tactic elsewhere recently, most notably with the Nikon D800 and D800E siblings. But the K-5 II has the distinction of being the first APS-C\nRead the full review \u00bb \u00bb\n\nThe Pentax K-5 IIs ($1,299.95 direct, body only) $1,007.79 at Amazon sets itself apart from the nearly identical K-5 II$959.99 at 42nd Street Photo by something it lacks: a low-pass filter. Elminating this filter allows the camera to capture sharper detail, although it comes at the risk of picking up moir\u00e9 color patterns in certain shooting situations. Like the K-5 II, the 16-megapixel camera shoots at an impressive 6.2 frames per second, is sealed for use in harsh weather, and delivers excellent photos even at high ISO settings. It's on a par with our Editors' Choice Sony Alpha 77$1,479.99 at 42nd Street Photo, but a disappointing video experience prevents it from ousting that camera from its perch.\nRead the full review \u00bb \u00bb\n\nWith the K-5 IIs, Pentax has the most feature-rich DSLR currently available - again. This DSLR camera boasts built-in stabilization, automatic horizon correction, a dual-axis digital level, class-leading weather-sealing, a large 100% coverage viewfinder, a 3\" LCD with 921K pixels, ISO up to 51200, 7 FPS continuous shooting, live-view and a wealth of unique photographic controls and image parameters. All this in a sturdy and relatively compact pro body. In addition to its photographic capabilities, the Pentax K-5 records full 1080p HD movies, either with a built-in mono microphone or an external stereo one.\nRead the full review \u00bb\n\nEntry Tags\n\nhd video, hd, 3 inch LCD, 1080p, 16 megapixel, full hd, DSLR, prosumer, pentax, dustproof, freezeproof, digital SLR, 7fps, filter, anti-alias, k5 IIs review, k5 IIs, k-5 IIs, Pentax K-5 IIs Review\n\nTracker Pixel for Entry",

        "text":"Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Aren\u2019t Fully Disabled When Toggled Off in Control Center on iOS 11\n\nApple has confirmed that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are not fully disabled when toggled off in Control Center on iOS 11.\n\nEven when toggled off in Control Center on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 11 and later, a new support document says Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will continue to be available for AirDrop, AirPlay, Apple Pencil, Apple Watch, Location Services, and Continuity features like Handoff and Instant Hotspot.\n\nToggling off Bluetooth or Wi-Fi in Control Center only disconnects accessories now, rather than disabling connectivity entirely.\n\nIf Bluetooth is turned off, the iOS device can't be connected to any Bluetooth accessories until one of these conditions is met:\n\n  \u2022 You turn on Bluetooth in Control Center.\n  \u2022 You connect to a Bluetooth accessory in Settings > Bluetooth.\n  \u2022 It's 5 a.m. local time.\n  \u2022 You restart your device.\n\n    While Wi-Fi is disabled, auto-join for any nearby Wi-Fi networks will also be disabled until one of these conditions is met:\n\n  \u2022 You turn on Wi-Fi in Control Center.\n  \u2022 You connect to a Wi-Fi network in Settings > Wi-Fi.\n  \u2022 You walk or drive to a new location.\n  \u2022 It's 5 a.m. local time.\n  \u2022 You restart your device.\n\n    Apple made this change in the iOS 11 beta, and it gained more attention after the software was publicly released yesterday.\n\n    iOS 11 users can still completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for all networks and devices by toggling them off in the Settings app.\n\n    Apple says users should try to keep Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on for the best experience on an iOS device.\n\n    (Thanks, FlunkedFlank!)\n\n    Related Roundup: iOS 11\n    Tags: Control Center, Bluetooth\n\n    Discuss this article in our forums\n\n  \u2022 Bluetooth LE Standard Gains Mesh Networking for Improved Smart Home Connectivity\n\n    The Bluetooth Special Interest Group today announced that its Bluetooth technology has been updated with support for mesh networking, designed to create large-scale device networks by connecting multiple Bluetooth devices to one another.\n\n    Bluetooth calls these \"many-to-many\" connections, which can support just a handful of devices or up to thousands. In a home setting, the mesh feature will be useful for connecting smart home devices to one another to establish a network that spans an entire house, with no areas that are out of range.\n\n    Mesh networks are an improvement over single-point connections because a Bluetooth signal can be transmitted from device to device, reaching further distances. Some products, like the ZigBee-based Philips Hue line of lights, already use mesh networking techniques that are similar to what's being implemented today.\n\n    Bluetooth mesh also has many commercial uses, because it creates a reliable network with no single point of failure, it can scale to support thousands of nodes, it supports multi-vendor interoperability, and it offers industrial-grade security. Bluetooth SIG believes Bluetooth mesh will be essential for commercial building and factory automation.\n\n    \"By adding support for mesh networking, the Bluetooth member community is continuing a long history of focused innovation to help new, up-and-coming markets flourish,\" said Mark Powell, executive director for Bluetooth SIG, Inc. \"In the same way the connected device market experienced rapid growth after the introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy, we believe Bluetooth mesh networking can play a vital role in helping early stage markets, such as building automation and wireless sensor networks, experience more rapid growth.\"\n    Existing devices that support Bluetooth 4.0 or 5.0 can be updated with support for Bluetooth mesh, but implementing support requires a firmware update.\n\n    Bluetooth mesh networking specifications and the tools that qualify Bluetooth products with networking support are available on the Bluetooth Website. Bluetooth SIG told The Verge that it often takes approximately six months for manufacturers to adopt new Bluetooth technology, but mesh could start rolling out sooner because it doesn't require new hardware.\n\n    Tag: Bluetooth\n\n    Discuss this article in our forums\n\n    Bluetooth 5 With 4x Longer Range and 2x Faster Speed is Officially Approved\n\n    The Bluetooth Special Interest Group today announced that the Bluetooth 5 standard has been officially adopted, which means manufacturers are now able to build it into their devices.\n\n    The next-generation Bluetooth standard offers longer range, faster speed, a larger broadcast message capacity, and better interoperability with other wireless technologies.\n\n    Compared to existing Bluetooth 4.2 protocol, Bluetooth 5 offers four times the range, two times the speed, and eight times the broadcast message capacity, bringing whole home coverage and more reliable connections between connected devices.\n    \"This means whole-home and building coverage, as well as new use cases for outdoor, industrial, and commercial applications will be a reality. With the launch of Bluetooth 5, we continue to evolve to meet the needs of IoT developers and consumers while staying true to what Bluetooth is at its core: the global wireless standard for simple, secure, connectivity.\"\n    With the debut of Bluetooth 5, SIG's Bluetooth naming convention will drop all references to version and point number going forward, simplifying marketing.\n\n    Devices that adopt Bluetooth 5 will be available within two to six months, meaning the next-generation products Apple plans to debut in 2017, including the iPhone 8, may offer Bluetooth 5 support.\n\n    Discuss this article in our forums",

        "text":"CES 2014: A Look at the New SanDisk Wireless Drives [VIDEO]\n\nIn this video, Larry Becker, from the Kelby Media Group, speaks to Anurag Malhotra, from SanDisk, about their new wireless media and flash drives.\n\nPhotoPlus 2013: Sandisk Wireless Media and Wireless Flash Drives\n\nSanDisk showcased two compact wireless storage devices. The wireless media drive is smaller than the average wallet and can stream content, including 1080p video, to up to five devices simultaneously. It charges via micro USB, and can run for up to eight hours when charged. There is no embedded storage; it comes with a full-sized SD card, which can be removed and upgraded to a max capacity of 128GB.\n\nThree Ways To Protect Your Photographs\n\nDo you put all your eggs into one basket? Let's clarify\u2014are all your memories on one memory card? They really shouldn't be. Nothing can be more painful than losing a lot of those great moments from parties and the kids' soccer game, or the evidence from your car accident. Here are some ideas on how to protect those memories.\n\nPhoto from Musee Mccord Museum\n\nNew Solid-State Hard Drives for Notebooks\n\nSolid-state hard drives have always been faster than their disk-based counterparts. With no heads to move or platters to spin, solid-state hard drives offer the fastest storage space money can buy. Solid-state hard drives also use less power than traditional drives, making them ideal for mobile use. SanDisk\u2019s G3 2.5-inch solid-state hard drives are intended for use in notebook computers.\n\n\n32GB microSDHC Card from SanDisk\n\nMemory card maker SanDisk has begun shipping a 32-Gigabyte microSDHC\u00a0card, which the company claims to be the highest-capacity card available in a form factor so tiny that it fits on a dime.\u00a0The card's storage is\u00a0double the capacity of SanDisk's 16GB microSDHC version. The 32GB\u00a0card comes with a 5-year limited warranty and will carry a suggested retail price of $199.99. It is expected to be available from B&H\u00a0in April.\n\nNew and Noteworthy Photo Gear\n\nThe first thing that strikes you when you see Casio's new Exilim EX-G1 is its wedge-like shape. With few exceptions, most point-and-shoot cameras are as boxy as a '64 Chevy Impala. Not so Casio's Exilim EX-G1, which has lines reminiscent of the far sexier-looking '65 Chevy Impala, a car that to this day remains a true head-turner. (What a difference a year makes!)\n\nThanks for the Memory Cards\n\nThe film of the digital age - memory cards - were dealt their biggest hands ever at CES even as two leading camera manufacturers seemed to abandon their largely proprietary formats in favor of the emerging SD card standard.\n\nWhat camera companies don't promote in their new product announcements at CES can speak volumes. Sony, for example, introduced new cameras and camcorders that instead of incorporating its proprietary Memory Stick Duo card format contained slots for SD or micro SD cards.\n\nSubscribe to RSS - sandisk",

Once complete, the facility will offer over 70,000 m2 of gross floor area and over 6,000 racks in total.\n\nThe FDC houses the landing station of the new Asia Submarine-cable Express (ASE) which connects key financial hubs in Asia with the shortest possible route that boasts industry leading network latency of less than 43 milliseconds from Hong Kong to Tokyo and less than 64 milliseconds from Singapore to Tokyo. Furthermore, the FDC is collocated with NTT Communications\u2019 global network node that connects to Europe and North America.\n\nThe Hong Kong Government is committed to promoting the development of high-tier data centres. Today the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate houses a cluster of 12 high-tier data centres, occupying a total of 20 hectares of land and the Hong Kong Financial Data Centre of NTT is the latest addition to this impressive data centre family. These centres with stringent performance requirements provide valuable support to the business operations and growth of both our local and international enterprises,\" stated Ms. Susie Ho Shuk-yee, JP, Permanent Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Hong Kong.\n\nNextiraOne Picks Equinix UK for Cloud Infrastructure\n\nNextiraOne, a European multinational company based in Paris that designs, installs, maintains and supports business communications services for over 60,000 private and public sector organizations, selected Equinix\u2019s LD5 International Business Exchange(IBX) as the primary data center to support the roll-out of its new modular private cloud infrastructure portfolio.\n\nThe new Equinix LD5 facility is located on same campus in Slough, England, as its LD4 data center. \u00a0The Equinix campus is linked by more than 1,000 diverse dark fiber links into Central London with global access to more than 900 network providers. \u00a0The location (just outside of London) provides access to transatlantic cables for low-latency connections to New York.\n\n\u201cThe past twelve months have seen a significant increase in the number of businesses consolidating IT legacy systems, which have proven costly to update and slowed commercial growth. By locating in Equinix, we will not only be able to deliver our services to customers but also have direct access to a prospective client base of cloud driven customers and partners through Equinix Marketplace portal,\" stated Geraint Davies, head of business development, Data Centers, NextiraOne.\n\nSeparately, Equinix received an award from the European Commission Joint Research Center that oversees the EU Code of Conduct (CoC) on Data Center Energy Efficiency for the company's new International Business Exchange (IBX) data center in Amsterdam (AM3). The new AM3 facility is build to LEED Gold standards.\n\nOkinawa Open Laboratory Targets SDN\n\nA new Okinawa Open Laboratory has been established by NTT Communications, NEC and IIGA Co. with a mission to develop software-defined networking (SDN) and cloud computing technologies.\n\nThe laboratory, which is located in Okinawa IT Shinryo Park in Okinawa Prefecture, will invite engineers from private companies and academic organizations in Japan and other countries to work at the facility on the development of SDN and cloud-computing technologies and verification for commercial use.\u00a0\n\nThe three companies set up the Okinawa Open Laboratory in cooperation with Okinawa Prefecture, which aims to become a leading ICT base in Asia. Yukio Ito, Senior Vice President and concurrently Director of Service Infrastructure at NTT Com, has been named Director of the new facility.\n\nSee also",
