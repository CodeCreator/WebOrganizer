Projections of high school graduation rates show a 25% decrease in the number of graduates between 1989 and 1991, while the demand for entry-level service employees is expected to increase. MCC will not only be competing with other colleges for this pool of high school graduates, but also with service industries that will be offering graduates attractive entry-level jobs. To deal with these demographic and economic trends, MCC should: (1) position itself within the community as the school to go to while holding a job because of its convenient location and transferable education; (2) adapt its college services for working students; (3) intensify relationships with those local service industries in greatest need (e.g., department apparel, and grocery stores; restaurants; gasoline stations; hotels, motels, and campgrounds; and amusement and recreational services); (4) consider cooperative education programs that rotate work and education time periods; (5) schedule relevant courses and programs to correspond to the slack time of particular service industries; and (6) encourage industries to offer their staff opportunities to earn college degrees through adjustable hours, tuition reimbursement, or alternative work\/education.

Changes in the nature of the legal profession and the market, the cost of legal education, and most recently the purpose of the third year of law school, have each been at the center of professional conversations, public debate and media stories about reform.\n\nLike my colleagues at other law schools, I am certainly involved with these critical conversations. I am also working with GGU Law faculty members and program leaders to launch and execute a comprehensive three-year action plan this fall. The plan will provide clear strategy and guidance and more importantly, tackle critical areas that address the needs of students from the time they enter law school through their transition into the profession.\n\n\nArticle from the Spring\/Summer 2013 issue of Golden Gate Lawyer.",

Effects on bilateral trade during and after the cold war.\nCoco-authored with Marina Murat, Pedro Degiovanni\nShortabstractUniversity students tend to build friendship and social ties that may last for a life time and evolve, in some cases, into business links. Latin American students have conspicuously started to move abroad during the sixties and seventies of the last century. With the end of the cold war, outgoing numbers grew rapidly. Do these movements influence the bilateral trade flows between students\u201f countries of origin and destination? And, if they do, is this influence constant through time? Is it related to the types of goods traded, or to specific characteristics of sending and receiving countries? This paper tests the effects of students\u201f movements from eleven Latin-American countries into nine OECD economies on bilateral trade flows during years 1971 to 2012. We use several cofactors, different econometric specifications and controls for endogeneity. Our main results are that education networks have positive and significant effects on bilateral exports and imports. In particular, the impact of students on trade is higher during the cold war period than afterwards, when the proportion of differentiated goods traded increases, but the political, cultural and institutional similarities between origin and destination countries improve significantly. We find the impact of education networks to be robust to different specifications and regressors. Governments should implement specific policies to trigger international student movements.\nPresenterMarina Murat",

Members of a group may reject the definitions and labels by outsiders and may also disagree among themselves about what they should be called. This Essential Tool uses U.S. Census Bureau ethnic\/racial categories, because socioeconomic data collected by the federal government is almost always reported according to these categories. The categories are White (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, Black (non-Hispanic), Asian\/Pacific Islander, and American Indian\/Alaskan Native (the categories are listed in descending order of population size).\n\nOf course, within each racial\/ethnic category there are numerous distinct subgroups, each with a unique historical and cultural background. There are nearly 300 American Indian tribal groups; the Hispanic category includes people of different racial backgrounds (including Black and White) from regions spanning thousands of miles; and the Asian\/Pacific Islander category combines persons with roots in the highly diverse regions of South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific Islands. As might be expected, one problem with ethnic\/racial categories is that they can obscure important differences among subgroups. For example, on a variety of socioeconomic measures (e.g., education, income, health, etc.), Asians as a group tend to score above the U.S. national average while Pacific Islanders tend to score below the average. However, these differences become hidden when the two groups are combined in the reporting of data, and their strengths and needs can become obscured.\n\nIn addition to the great diversity among subgroups within the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s ethnic\/racial categories, there are many variables among individuals within subgroups on a wide range of attributes, such as degree of identification with their traditional culture versus American mainstream culture and their facility with standard English\u2014an estimated 18% of the U.S. population speak a language other than English at home (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003a). These considerations strongly support the idea that individualization is an essential ingredient for cultural competence. At the same time, however, the process of individualizing services and supports will be enhanced when transition personnel are aware of and understand the broader cultural context in which individual youth and their families live.\n\nThis part of the Essential Tool provides a broad statistical comparison of primary ethnic\/racial groups, followed by descriptions of challenges that tend to be more serious for CLD youth. These challenges tend to be most significant for youth and families living in conditions of poverty and marginalization, whether they are of White or CLD heritage (Greene & Nefsky, 1999). CLD populations, however, tend to have much higher rates of poverty.\n\nStatistical Comparisons of Ethnic\/Racial Groups\n\nTable 1 provides a statistical snapshot of U.S. ethnic\/racial groups on a variety of population, disability, and education indicators. Two differences stand out between Whites and the CLD groups as a whole. One is that all of the CLD groups have median ages much lower than Whites. This means that larger percentages of CLD group members are of school age. In addition, projections of the U.S. population for 2020 and 2050 indicate that CLD groups are growing at a faster rate than Whites. These population trends have considerable significance for educators as the proportion of CLD students grows in classrooms across the country. As schools serve a growing number of CLD students, they will need to enhance their cultural competence in order to support positive outcomes for all their students.\n\nTable 1.

In comparing numbers, it should be remembered that different sources may use different definitions of ethnic\/racial categories and different methods of determining membership in categories.\n1 U.S. Census Bureau (2001b).\n2 U.S. Census Bureau (2000).\n3 U.S. Department of Education (2002).\n4 Wirt et al. (2003).\n5 Harvey (2001).\n6 U.S. Census Bureau (2003b).\n7 Horn and Berktold (1999).\n8 Snyder and Hoffman (2003).\n\nThe second major difference between White and CLD groups is that CLD groups (with the exception of Asians\/Pacific Islanders) have much higher rates of poverty than Whites. According to the 2000 census, about 9.9% of Whites and 10.2% of Asians\/Pacific Islanders live below the poverty level, compared to 21.4% of Hispanics, 22.7% of Blacks, and 24.5% of American Indians\/Alaskan Natives (Wirt et al., 2003). Poverty has a negative impact on a host of factors relevant to academic achievement (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). Poverty also is associated with higher disability rates across all age groups due to such factors as limited availability or accessibility of health insurance and medical care, including prenatal care, greater exposure to environmental toxins, and higher likelihood of employment in physically dangerous jobs (Fujiara & Yamaki, 1999; Smart & Smart, 1997).\n\nThe poverty rate for students with disabilities has been estimated as 28% compared to 8% for those without disabilities (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001a). The National Academy of Sciences conducted a comprehensive analysis of the literature on special and gifted education placements (Donovan & Cross, 2002). The authors concluded that overrepresentation of some CLD groups in certain special education categories, and underrepresentation in gifted education programs, is primarily related to higher poverty rates. At the postsecondary level (college, community or technical college, or trade school), it appears that many barriers to education success for CLD persons with disabilities also are related more to the effects of poverty than to cultural or linguistic factors. For example, one study found lack of money to be the greatest \u201ccontextual barrier\u201d faced by CLD families seeking access to postsecondary education for their children (Geenen, Powers, Vasquez, & Bersani, 2003). Another example of a poverty-related barrier is that residents of high poverty neighborhoods are the least likely to have computers and Internet access at home (Wilhelm, Carmen, & Reynolds, 2002).\n\nBarriers to postsecondary education faced by many CLD youth with disabilities may limit their transition options. Their relatively low rates of attending postsecondary education programs are reflected in Table 2, which shows that the proportion of college students reporting a disability is considerably lower for each of the CLD groups (with the exception of American Indians\/Alaskan Natives) compared to Whites. In addition, compared to their White counterparts, CLD college students with disabilities are more likely to abandon their studies or to take longer to complete a postsecondary program (Blackorby & Wagner, 1996).\n\nTable 2.

The core assumptions underlying strengths-based approaches include:\n\n  \u2022 All youth have strengths;\n  \u2022 The motivation of youth may be enhanced when others point out their strengths; and\n  \u2022 Failure of a youth to acquire a skill does not mean a deficit but instead indicates that opportunities and appropriate instruction to obtain the skill have not been provided (Epstein & Sharma, 1998).\n\nPositive behavioral supports are an example of a strengths-based approach for people with severe disorders whose behavior limits their successful functioning in integrated settings. This approach works best when functional assessment is used to identify and address factors surrounding the individual that contribute to the behavior problem.

The first two chapters of the dissertation investigate how local institutions and policies affect the development performance. The last chapter studies the relation between the foreign interaction and regional development.\n\nThe first chapter studies the fertility history in the late 19th and the earlier 20th century. The paper documents that when compared to the cohort of female who were born in 1860 in the U.S., those who were born in 1880 experienced a 35% decline in the average number of children given birth to over their lifetime. Two important forces behind this observation are documented: (1) the agricultural sector had a higher fertility rate, so when the share of the agricultural sector declined, the aggregate fertility rate followed; (2) the education reform starting 1890 induced parents in the rural area to substitute away quantity of children for quality. A two-sector overlapping-generations model that features both endogenous fertility and schooling choice to evaluate the effects of the education reform is built. Through counterfactual analysis, it is found that the education reform accounts for one fourth of the declines in the fertility rate, and that of the agricultural employment share drop, together with more than half of the skill intensity increase in the model. The shutdown of quality-quantity trade-off channel by exogenously fixing the fertility rates would reduce around one fifth of the structural transformation generated in the model.\n\nThe second chapter investigates the peculiar behavior of agricultural fertility in the agricultural sector. The fertility rate of female in agricultural sector during the Baby Boom period was peculiar. Compared to a 42% economy-wide increase, the cohort fertility rate for those who were affiliated with the agricultural sector increased only by 18%. This paper argues that the adoption of tractor reduced the labor requirement and increase in the years of schooling that induced reduction in fertility. It can also be found in the cross-sectional data that the adoption of tractor was negatively correlated with the family member usage and positively correlated with the school attendance rate among the children with farmer parents. An overlapping-generations model is proposed that captures the salient observations found.\n\nThe third chapter attempts to explore the interplays between trade and institutions. A staged development framework with multi-period discrete choices to study the colonization of Hong Kong, which served to facilitate the trade of several agricultural and manufactured products, including opium, between Britain and China. The chapter provides a complete characterization of the endogenous transition from the pre-Opium War era, to the post-Opium War era and then to the post-opium trade era, which span the period 1773-1933. It is shown that the low opium trading cost as well as the high warfare cost initially postponed any military action. Nevertheless, the high valuation of the total volume of bilateral trade and the rising opium trading cost eventually led the British government to declare the Opium Wars, which established the legalization of opium trade and the colonization of Hong Kong. It is also shown that, in response to a drastic drop in opium demand and a rising opium trading cost, it became optimal for the British government to abandon opium trade soon after the founding of the Republic of China.\n\n\nEnglish (en)\n\nChair and Committee\n\nPing Wang\n\nCommittee Members\n\nCostas Azariadis, Francisco Buera, Limor Golan, B.

The participants were students involved in the course \"Teaching and Learning about Africa\" at the University of Illinois and the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Students were able to participate in their native country while interacting with others abroad. The course explored various topics related to education in South Africa, the United States, and the world. The research questions were: What do students learn in a cross-cultural online environment? and What does an online environment add to or detract from cross-cultural education? Data from the interviews were coded into categories, and later as broader themes emerged, these were linked to the two research questions. Online survey data were analyzed using statistical methods. The theoretical framework for the study included both sociocultural (Dewey, 1902, 1915, 1916) and critical pedagogy perspectives (Freire, 1970). The discussion explored how challenging the students' worldviews through online chat sessions, assigned readings, and assignments cultivated a problem-posing and authentic educational atmosphere, which offered students the chance to think critically, learn, and grow both academically and personally. In addition, an interpretation of how the development of trust, openness, and textual communication influenced the students' participation in this course was explored.\nIssue Date:2009\nDescription:220 p.\nThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2009.\nOther Identifier(s):(MiAaPQ)AAI3362767\nDate Available in IDEALS:2015-09-25\nDate Deposited:2009\n\nThis item appears in the following Collection(s)\n\nItem Statistics",

However, information security topics are challenging to teach in traditional computer laboratories mainly due to restrictive information technology policies. In the literature, virtual computer laboratories have been proposed to address the challenges of providing students with hands-on learning experiences in information security. While the literature mainly focuses on technical aspects of virtual computer laboratories and related hands-on activities, pedagogical aspects of hands-on activities are overlooked. Our experiences with a virtual computer laboratory have shown that hands-on activities which are designed based on a prescriptive, step-by-step approach do not always achieve the expected learning outcomes. In this paper, we propose Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle as a framework to design hands-on activities in virtual computer laboratories, and we argue that hands-on activities designed based on this framework enhance student learning outcomes. We illustrate how the stages of Kolb's model can be incorporated into hands-on activities and present results from two empirical studies to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The empirical findings in the first study suggest that hands-on activities designed based on the proposed framework are more likely to increase student interest and competency compared to step-by-step hands-on activities. In the second study, the collected data is analyzed using structural equation modeling to determine the relationships among the factors affecting student learning outcomes as a result of hands-on activities. The results of the second study show that student-to-student interaction is an important factor determining student learning experiences.\n\n\nKonak, A., Clark, T.K. & Nasereddin, M. (2014).

Literature shows that teachers are exiting the teaching profession at an alarming rate, and there are various and intertwined reasons compelling teachers to leave their jobs.\n\nResearch purposes: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of retention factors on work engagement.\n\nMotivation for the study: Turnover among teachers is high, and many teachers are leaving the profession during their early years of teaching. An empirical investigation of the relationship between retention factors and work engagement and the results of utilising retention factors and work engagement to facilitate employee retention is needed.\n\nResearch approach\/design and method: A quantitative design was used, and 278 questionnaires were collected from a convenience sample of teachers from public schools in the Tshwane Municipality.\n\nMain findings: Correlational analysis revealed significant relationships between retention factors and work engagement. Multiple regression analyses revealed that retention factors significantly predict work engagement. The main practical contribution of this study is the way in which it has demonstrated that retention factors relate to and predict work engagement.\n\nPractical\/managerial implications: Organisations should provide their employees with improved compensation, training and development, and career opportunities as this may improve employees\u2019 work engagement. Therefore, organisations should determine whether employees are satisfied with these retention factors as provided in the organisation.\n\nContribution\/value-add: This study adds to the psychological attachment theory by suggesting that employees satisfied with retention factors in their organisations are more likely to be engaged.\n\n\nretention factors; work engagement; compensation; work\u2013life balance; career development; training and development; vigour; dedication; absorption.\n\n\nTotal abstract views: 648\nTotal article views: 852\n\nCrossref Citations\n\nNo related citations found.",

The package of new initiatives--dubbed the Canada Opportunities Strategy--not only partially reversed an earlier period of fiscal restraint but also brought a new emphasis on direct forms of student assistance such as grants, bursaries, and tax credits. However, programs such as the Canada Millennium Bursaries and the Canada Education Savings Grants, despite their focused approach and innovative structure, came to be regarded as weak policy tools when measured against their ostensible goals of widening access to post-secondary education and efficiently targeting student assistance on the basis of need. The new policy regime also failed to fulfil nearly two decades of previous efforts by policy-makers to transform Canada's student debt program into a systematic income-contingent loan program. We offer explanations of this pattern of policy inconsistency and incoherence by examining the awkward challenges of intergovernmental relations in the Canadian federal system as well as the fragmentation and competing goals now evident in student assistance policy networks. We contrast the student finance policy regime with the arguably more coherent set of research and innovation policies established by the federal government during the same period. We use policy network analysis as our theoretical framework, and we use data from our extensive interviews with higher education stakeholders and policy-makers to provide empirical support.

        "text":"Motivating public employees; changing the public sector from inside\n\nMotivating public employees; changing the public sector from inside\nIt is not possible to link the personal or professional public sector employees motivations\nwith one isolated \"factor\" or \"element\".\nLikewise, it also depends on the perspective through which observe the situation. It can be\nseen from the perspective of the employee through the achievement of personal and \/ or\nprofessional reasons.\nIt can also be approached from the perspective of the heads of the public sector through the\nappropriation of efficiency in organizational processes they lead to improved results. A last one\ncould be from the perspective of the organization itself, depending on the work area and a specific\nprofile to fulfill its obligations to the public.\nWhat is determinant for people to choose, to start or continue, their careers in the public\nsector is a question that cannot be answered universally due to the infinite number of possible\nreasons for some of the persons involved in the development of processes. In turn, it depends on the\ncontext in which the question is made.\nIf the question arises with pretensions to intervene the current processes of an organization\nto improve the achievement of results, it could be say that the motivations are the continuous\nnegotiations between employees and the organization for the alignment of objectives; i.e., that both\nthe organization and the employee are heading to achieve the same objectives in a look now\n(present) the organizational ideal (future).\nIn this context, necessary elements such as a strong economic proposal (compensation) or\nexcellent leadership to align and coordinate the interests of the parties.\nMoreover, if the question arises preventively, i.e., not to intervene a current situation but\nplan a future situation, we could say that the motivations of employees (elected according to\nspecific criteria) rest on solid definition of the values and objectives the organizations to which it is\nlinked (or seek to link a future through a selection process), leaving the other elements as\nremuneration and leadership in the background.\nAmong this universe of interpretations, a tentative answer would be that the motivations of\npublic employees are more than a list of items; a series of complex processes (organizational\nculture) series whose actors to employees (human resources), the heads (results) and the\norganization itself (reason for being), which is developed over time by negotiating items such as\nleadership, remuneration and organizational values to achieve goals.\nIn this perspective, I would like to emphasize that while there is no single formula to\ndetermine the nature of the motivations of public employees (or enlarge them), but we can certainly\nfragmenting the processes factors in order to analyze not as a reactive process (motivations as a\nstimulus for action and reaction), but as a reflexive process (the ability to determine the key points\nfor planning with foresight before starting any organizational process).\nThus, it is worth addressing the issue in two stages as proposed by Schott, Kleef and Steen;\nthe identity of the institution (what, how, when and why of their work) and the identity of the\nworker of the institution (what, why and how).\nThis concept, since the theory of identity is defined as the \"self\" as the reflection \"which\nemerges out of the interaction with these complex social structures and provides the link between\nthe environment and personal behavior\" (Schott, Kleef, & Steen, 2014a, p.693).\nThereby, it could identify a typology of motivations based on the determination of the\npersonality of the organization and the profile of the potential workers to establish processes that\nenable proactive labors and relationships over negotiations for the development of the daily chores.\nWithin the logic of the joint work is based on the principle that people are the ones who\nmust adapt to institutions where they have to perform their work. How we refer to a specific sector\n(public sector), human talent as a minimum requirement should be a primary interest in serving the\ncommunity (which is the basic idea of working in the sector).\nIn this regard, the same authors claim that people who work in this sector \"can be described\nas a personal orientation or commitment toward the public interest\". (Schott, Kleef, & Steen, 2014c,\np.692). In other words, they must have some specific characteristics before start doing any public\njob. This characteristics must work as a personal and professional motivations in relation to their\nprofessional features.\nThe personal and professional motivations, from the perspective of Weibel, Rost, and\nOsterloh (2010) can be addressed from two perspectives; that of extrinsic type and those of intrinsic\ntype. Referring to \u201cextrinsic,\" is defined as the kind of motivations that seeks \"personal needs\nindirectly, that is, extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to separable\noutcomes: such as monetary compensation\" (Ryan & Deci, 2000, p.58).\nIn turn, referring to the type \u201cintrinsic\u201d motivations are those that are \u201cthought to be\nintrinsically rewarding if they are perceived to be interesting, That is, to be challenging, enjoyable,\nor purposeful\" (Weibel, A. Rost, K., & Osterloh, M., 2010, p. 389).\nConsidering the above contributions, it could be argued that the motivation must come or be\npart of the characteristics of people seeking work in the public sector (qualities and motivations of\nreflective type) before imposing or trying to influence them from external level (generating qualities\nattempt reactively).\nIn brief, the public sector worker has a specific profile with defined characteristics that can\nget in tune with the characteristics of a public organization; which means that personal, professional\nand organizational motivations are in complete harmony to the search for a common goal.\nSchott, C., van Kleef, D.

What are the causes of this trend? Suggest some possible solutions to it.\n\n\nThe rate of youth crime is on a rising trend in many countries which causes a heated debate on the reasons and solutions of this worrying phenomenon. I would analyze the causes and solutions in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, the insufficient parenting is responsible for the juvenile delinquency. Children from the family lacking cares tend to be more violent and rude than others from the family full of love. Then, the schooling which oriented student\u2019s scores may overlook the education of being a legal-abiding citizen. What\u2019s more, the press should be blamed for the increasing trend of youth crime because the pieces of coverage contains large amount of violent and sexual stuff. Some movies and novels even glory the violence. Young people have no immune to tell the right from the wrong and easy to imitate others to break the law.\n\nFacing with this more and more dangerous trend of youth crime, we have to solve the root causes of this phenomenon. To start with, parents should spend more time and energy on the education of the youth. The family is the most important element in the formation of young people\u2019s personality. Secondly, schools are expected to change the model of score-oriented education to ones foster generalists who are excellent in all aspects. Last but not least, the government should supervise the press and limit young people\u2019s access to porn and violence.\n\nThe development of young people decides the further of our society. We should pay more attention to the youth crime and solve this problem from the root. Only in this way can our society booms in the future.\n\n\n\n2.\u4e3b\u4f53\u6bb51\uff1a\u5206\u6790causes, \u4e09\u70b9\u539f\u56e0\n\n3.\u4e3b\u4f53\u6bb52\uff1a\u63d0\u51fasolutions \u4e09\u70b9\u5efa\u8bae\n\n\n\nThis essay is excellent. Your student should be very proud of themselves. There are many strengths here and I shall address those first.\n\nThe written papers are assessed on four different points:\n\n1.Task Achievement.\n\n\nThis is how well the student has answered the question. It is the easiest way for students to get points, and this essay answers the question excellently. It makes three great points, offers clear solutions and has a nice well thought out conclusion. I was very pleased with this part of the essay. And if I were the examiner I would put this in the region of a 6 with an eye towards the 7.\n\n\n2.Secondly, Coherence and Cohesion.\n\n\nThis looks at how well the essay flows and how it is linked together and this again was done excellently. There was no repetition, while at the same time it had a natural flow. I was impressed with this and would score it at least a 6 and would seriously be considering a 7 here.\n\n\n3.Lexical Resource.\n\n\nThis looks at the vocabulary used. Again this was incredibly impressive. The student used vocabulary that showed a high level of education. This perhaps was the most impressive part of the essay. Vocabulary such as juvenile delinquency, score-orientated and root causes will gain the examiner's respect. A few times the student made mistakes with their lexis. Legal-abiding should be law-abiding. I'm thinking perhaps the student was confused between law-abiding and legally binding. However this even further goes to show the impressive extent of the student's vocabulary, and trying to do something difficult and making mistakes is far far better than to keep it simple and all correct.\n\n\u8fd9\u4e00\u89d2\u5ea6\u662f\u8bc4\u5224\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u540c\u6837\u8be5\u4f5c\u6587\u7ed9\u4eba\u7559\u4e0b\u6781\u4e3a\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c55\u793a\u4e86ta\u6240\u53d7\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6559\u80b2\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u5168\u6587\u6700\u8ba9\u4eba\u96be\u5fd8\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8ejuvenile delinquency, score-orientated and root causes\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u7528\u8bcd\u4f1a\u8d62\u5f97\u8003\u5b98\u7684\u5c0a\u91cd\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u6b21\u7528\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f8b\u5982legal-abiding\u5e94\u8be5\u662flaw-abiding.\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u52a0\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba9\u4eba\u4fa7\u76ee\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u9ad8\u96be\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u5c1d\u8bd5\u9ad8\u96be\u8868\u8fbe\u800c\u72af\u9519\u8981\u8fdc\u8fdc\u6bd4\u7528\u8bed\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u4e0d\u72af\u9519\u8981\u597d\u3002\n\nSome mistakes here (but please do not be disheartened because the vocabulary really was brilliant)\n\n\n1.Glory the violence should be glorify the violence.\n\nGlory is a noun. Glorify is the verb. Glorious is the adjective\n\n2.Young children have no immune Should be Young children have no immunity\n\nImmune is an adjective. Immunity is the noun.\n\nSo it could also have correctly said: young children are not immune..\n\nThis is in the region of a 7 due to its highly sophisticated vocabulary, however a harsh examiner could potentially drop the grade to 6 due to these mistakes.\n\n\n\n4.Grammatical range and accuracy.\n\n\nNow I do not in any way wish for this student to be disheartened because I mean it when I say I was highly impressed with this work and that it was of a very high standard. However, this essay contained no complex grammar. The tenses it did use were correct but your examiner wants to see examples of higher level grammatical structures.\n\n\nTo be specific, we want to see perfect tenses, passive tenses and relative clauses. I understand that it's not easy to add in this grammar when the topic naturally lends itself to simple grammatical structures but it is important for the student to try. My own suggestions would be to try something like\n\n\ninstead of 'insufficient parenting is responsible for the juvenile delinquency' \uff0cto put, 'insufficient parenting has been blamed for juvenile delinquency.'\n\nHere you'd have the present perfect and the passive in one sentence. This would make any examiner extremely happy.\n\n\nInstead of 'The family is the most important element in the formation of young people\u2019s personality.' The student could have written: 'Family has always been the most important element in the formation of young people's personality.'\n\nI think perhaps this student will feel a little frustrated at this suggestion because their English is of such a high standard that they are answering the question quite naturally and do not want to stop to artificially add complex grammar; especially when it is normal to answer without it, even to a native speaker. But examiners want to see that difficult grammar, they really do!\n\n\nThe second issue with the grammar is overuse of 'the'. There are many times in which there was no need for it, for example:\n\n\nFirstly, the insufficient parenting is responsible for the juvenile delinquency.\n\nThe student needs to be careful of this, although it does show an understanding of the language and it is far better, in the eyes of the examiner, to use it when it should not be used, than to not use it when it should.\n\n\nThe score for this is tricky and your examiner may even look in the region of a 5. Not because it was terrible, but because there were simply no examples of anything complex.\n\n\nA level 6 is a student who tries to use complex grammar but who makes some mistakes with it.\n\nA level 5 is a student who uses simple grammar with a fair amount of accuracy. What would make the examiner choose the 6 however, is that at no point is it difficult to understand. However if you have a harsh examiner, you may find them grading you a 5.\n\n\nThe public descriptors of a 5 are:\n\nUses only a range of structures.\n\nAttempts complex sentences but these tend to less accurate than simple sentences.\n\n\n\nThe public descriptors of 6 are:\n\nUses a variety of complex structures.\n\nProduces frequent error-free sentences.\n\nHas good control of grammar and punctuation but may make a few errors.\n\n\n\nHere you can see how an examiner may grade as low as a 5.\n\nThere were times during the grading of this essay that I even started looking as high as an 8 in certain aspects. This is how impressed I was at points of this essay.\n\nOverall this text is looking in the region of a 6.\n\nWith more complex grammar and more accurate use of its sophisticated vocabulary, it could be raised easily to 7.

Understanding this relationship is important because the implicit or explicit recognition of document genre by users has been shown to improve document usability and aid in the production of web documents (Yates & Sumner, 1997). The first stage of our research is richly descriptive in nature: our goal is to identify, describe and classify (a) web document genres used by persons in three different social systems (grade- and high-school teachers, journalists and medical residents) and (b) the work tasks associated with these genres. Our data collection methods will be largely inductive and will involve observation of and interviews with targeted users in their work environment. Analyses will rely on content-analytic methods (Katz, 1966) applied to a foundation of user descriptions and researchers' notes. The resulting classification of web document genres and associated tasks will be faceted in nature (see, e.g., Kwasnik, 1992, for a discussion of its advantages) and, it is hoped, sufficiently flexible to accommodate future, unanticipated web document genres. A presentation at Connections 2005 will report on the progress of this two-year, NSF-funded study that began in October 2004.",

Originally approved in June 1969, the grant became operational for the school year 1970-71.\n\nIn addition to faculty salaries, supplies, professional consu1tation, fees, etc. the grant provides trainee stipends for selected students participating in the program. Both first and second year students in the graduate program are eligible for field placement at John Adams High School where they spend two days per week as school social work trainees.\n\nThe unit is currently instucted by an MSW social worker who is a faculty member of the School of Social Work at Portland State University. The instructor provides a variety of training experiences for students including direct services to clients and families, supervision, consultation, program development, teaching and research. The primary focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program. at Adams High School. Secondarily, this study will attempt to answer three basic questions:\n\n  1. Can a graduate school social work field instruction program in public school social work on the elementary and secondary levels be evaluated?\n  2. Can an ongoing instrument be developed allowing for evaluation of program and individual instruction?\n  3. Can the study provide analytical data for the program director's evaluation of the effectiveness of his training?\n\nThis study was undertaken by the authors because of an interest in program evaluation as an integral function of professional social work practice. We feel agencies, particularly those financed through public funds are increasingly being pressured to not only quantify, but to qualify program effectiveness. Funding bodies now require evaluative research documenting direction and effectiveness of social programs.\n\nFindings of this study should be of value not only to the funding source and the program director, but also to other students who in the future may wish to conduct similar studies in evaluation of graduate social work field instruction.\n\nThe following chapter discusses the background and development of John Adams High School and the educational climate that made possible the inclusion of this training program as a part of the learning experiences offered. Chapter III deals with the objectives of the training program. Chapter IV examines evaluative research. Chapter V develops the methodology of the research.\n\nThe charts and statistics used are examined in Chapter VI. The data are presented and analyzed in Chapter VII. Summary, conclusions and recommendations are then set forth in the final chapter.\n\n\nA joint project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Social Work, Portland State University.\n\nPersistent Identifier",

        "text":"Nursing Education System\n\nAccording to Chen (1996, pp. 129-149), the first collegiate nursing program was started by Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). This was a five-year program established in 1920. The first secondary level nursing school was established in 1930. The PUMC program remained the only tertiary program in Chinese education until 1952 when the communist government restructured the education system to accommodate the higher education system. However, the political upheavals delayed the implementation of the higher education program until 1980s (Xu et al., 2000, p. 208). Nursing education in Poland was established later than in China, i.e. 1911 (Sztembis, 2006, p. 102). However, the development rate of nursing education in Poland was faster compared to that of China. Polish nursing education ceased in 1914 with the rise of the First World War (Sztembis, 2006, p. 102). According to Wolska-Lipiec (1987, p. 42), most of the teachers and graduates of the school joined the military to train the society on the modalities of caring for the wounded and participating in the civil sanitation. Secondary education in nursing was introduced in 1960s, while the university-based programs were introduced in 1980s (Sztembis, 2006, p. 104). Government and Nursing Organizations Influencing Nursing Education: Comparison of Poland and China. Nursing education in China was predominantly influenced by the missionaries (Xu et al, 2000, p. 207). The horizon for the Chinese health care has been expanded by programs such as the WHO collaborating center in Nursing and Midwifery, Heart to Heart and the Project Hope which have been sponsored by the government and other non-governmental organizations (Xu et al, 2000, p. 208). The prominent source of financial support is China\u2019s Medical Board (CMB), which is an offshoot of Rockefeller Foundation (Xu et al., 2000, p. 212). CMB provides resources for faculty training, purchasing the reading materials and capacity building. In Poland, the programs aimed at preparing women for care of patients were funded by the collaboration of the American Red Cross and Rockefeller Foundation (Sztembis, 2006, p. 103). The Polish Nursing Association undertook the process of redesigning nursing through seeking support from the politicians and leaders. The 1990s witnessed the establishment of the Independent Nursing Section in the Ministry of Health which later culminated into the Department of Nursing. The self-governing body of Polish nurses, i.e. Nursing Chambers, acts as the formal representation of the nurses at the national level. Current System of Nursing Education: Comparison of Poland and China The Chinese system requires a candidate to go through the secondary nursing programs. Zhuake programs, which are equivalent to the associate degree programs in the U.S., and Baccalaureate programs for them to be registered nurses (Xu et al., 2000, p. 209). The secondary nursing program acts as a basic academic unit of a nursing school. The secondary nursing programs occur in two forms. the first, which enrolls high school graduates and a second that admits the middle and junior high school graduates. Post secondary nursing program in China has three levels: Baccalaureate, Zhuanke and Graduate (Xu et al., 2000,",

Each team will identify and explore an emerging technology. This will be a technology that may already exist, but is drawing attention because of new applications, anticipated impacts or potential controversies. Examples could include: My portion of this paper is Cultural Considerations: we have chosen (Robtic surgery as our topic) Cultural Considerations: This is a really important section. Consider the elements that comprise the culture and subcultures. Compare the United States use of the technology with that of other nations around the world. What is about Americans that brings about innovation, or has America declined in terms of technical innovation, scientific research and development? Look at advertising for the technology, the use of celebrities or stars or heroes, the applications (e.g. sports and nanotechnology) and the values represented by the culture. What has priority and why? An example: IBM was spelled out in xenon atoms. Why were these letters chosen instead of something else? What new words have been added to our vocabulary from this technology? \u201cHorseless carriage\u201d was used long before the term \u201cautomobile.\u201d \u201cWireless\u201d preceded Wi-Fi, and webcasting preceded podcasting. \u201cBroadcast\u201d was a term adapted from agriculture long before it was used for radio and television The team will explore the technical, social, cultural, moral and ethical issues presented by the technology. Guidelines\n\nAll teams will be assigned at the start of the first week. The first deliverable is due on the Sunday of Week 1, so students must get organized and into the project immediately. Each team will select a Team Leader, who will be responsible for the coordination of the research and the submission of assignments. Team members will remain on the assigned team throughout the duration of the class (in the project world, project managers seldom have the opportunity to select their own team members!). It is highly recommended that each team develop its own Team Contract to clearly define expectations, strategies, and timelines. Emphasis is placed on both individual contributions and the final product of teams. You will communicate with your team through team meetings (online) and team discussion threads. Team members who fail to participate in an assignment will not get points for that assignment. With those parts of the Team Project where a group grade will be assigned, all team members must submit a copy of the team\u2019s work. When an assignment is completed, the Team Leader will distribute the finished product to all team members, and each team member must submit this copy to the Dropbox,\n\nThe Task\nThe primary focus of the team is to research and assess the issues associated with a specific emerging technology. The team will produce a formal research paper in APA format, with each team member contributing 10 pages of text. The paper will provide the basis for a 20-minute team presentation. The following Required Elements must be researched and included in the final project. What follows is a list only, and is in no way an outline: * A brief description of the technology and an explanation of the associated science * The historical development and context of the technology * Political and legal influences\n\n* Economic questions and considerations\n* Psychological considerations and sociological effects\n* The technology in its cultural context, media influence * Implications for the environment\n* Moral and ethical implications\nTo properly analyze the various elements of the project, research will cut across disciplines and include academic, scientific and industry sources....\ntracking img",

Caron\n\nPepperdine University - School of Law\n\n\nThis Essay explains the pedagogical theory behind the new Law Stories series of books to be published by Foundation Press. The Law Stories series is intended to enrich the use of the case method of instruction in the law school classroom. By focusing on fewer cases and pausing for an in-depth review of the seminal cases in the field, the professor can empower students to construct their own schematic understanding of the area of law. Cognitive science teaches that such active learning produces more lasting value to students who are better equipped to process new information and solve new problems within the context of their self-constructed schemata. Professors thus should resist the temptation to do this work for students, conveying our schemata in a top-down fashion, with students playing merely a passive role in receiving this oracular wisdom. As a result, Professors should not sacrifice depth of coverage at the alter of scope of coverage; rather than rush through the signature cases in our subject in order to get to the latest hot topic or fashionable theory, professors should savor the opportunity to unpack with our students what it is that makes these cases central to a deep understanding of the field. The Law Stories series provides the raw material to enhance the study of the foundation cases in different subjects. As the initial book in the series, Tax Stories provides an in-depth examination into ten pivotal United States Supreme Court cases in the development of the federal income tax that provide fresh insights both into particular doctrinal areas of tax law as well as issues of wider application across the tax law.\n\nSuggested Citation\n\nCaron, Paul L., Back to the Future: Teaching Law Through Stories.

We are interested in their role as risk taking institutions, because we see risk as a pre-condition for sustainability. This paper will explore the relationship between sustainability, emergence, universities and a high level graduate attribute \u2013 global citizenship. We will explore this relationship by proposing a model that frames the theory of sustainability as a quality that emerges from a system. Emergence occurs from unmanaged multiple actions at the local scale and is more likely to occur in environments with greater risk and diversity. Emergence is only identified from the scale above where actions are taking place, so an emergent model of sustainability emphasises the space and interaction between the scales of action and observation. Australian universities play an important role in this space between the scales. They are both actor and observer, and trainers of the present and future actors and observers. By choosing to have higher level graduate attributes like leadership and global citizenship, universities are taking a risk in selecting and advocating for the attributes they think our future thinkers and leaders should have. We present the research design and some preliminary data that aims to determine if the global citizenship graduate attribute can serve as an example of universities' engagement between the scales to help create a sustainable future.\n\nStatistics for USQ ePrint 23504\nStatistics for this ePrint Item\nItem Type: Conference or Workshop Item (Commonwealth Reporting Category E) (Speech)\nRefereed: Yes\nItem Status: Live Archive\nFaculty \/ Department \/ School: Current - USQ Other\nDate Deposited: 31 Jul 2013 05:12\nLast Modified: 18 Jun 2017 23:27\nUncontrolled Keywords: emergence; sustainability; graduate attribute; global citizenship\nFields of Research : 05 Environmental Sciences > 0502 Environmental Science and Management > 050203 Environmental Education and Extension\n13 Education > 1303 Specialist Studies in Education > 130303 Education Assessment and Evaluation\nSocio-Economic Objective: E Expanding Knowledge > 97 Expanding Knowledge > 970105 Expanding Knowledge in the Environmental Sciences\nE Expanding Knowledge > 97 Expanding Knowledge > 970122 Expanding Knowledge in Philosophy and Religious Studies\nE Expanding Knowledge > 97 Expanding Knowledge > 970113 Expanding Knowledge in Education\n\nActions (login required)\n\nView Item Archive Repository Staff Only",
