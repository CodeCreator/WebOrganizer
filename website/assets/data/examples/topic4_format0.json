In: Postgraduate Annual Research Seminar 2005.\n\n[img] PDF\n\n\nIn the information age, higher education institutions in Malaysia are implementing academic computing to provide better education services and remain competitive in a global knowledge industry. It encompasses the utilisation of staff, infrastructure (hardware and software) and services (technology, information content and human resources) which enable and support the management and delivery of academic programmes in teaching, learning and research. Research by UNESCO (2004) shows that many Asia-Pacific countries including Malaysia lack the proper framework to assess and evaluate IT implementation in higher education. Seven main areas of academic computing are identified. They include teaching and learning, research and publication, infrastructure, information services, institutional support, plan and policy and assessment. These areas encompass a total of thirty-four components. To determine the importance of these components within the Malaysian context, a pilot survey was conducted on a selected higher education institution. This research discusses the results.\n\nItem Type:Conference or Workshop Item (Paper)\nUncontrolled Keywords:academic computing, assessment, framework, higher education\nSubjects:H Social Sciences > H Social Sciences (General)\nQ Science > QA Mathematics > QA75 Electronic computers.

Using detailed administrative data for Germany for numerous birth cohorts across different regions, we follow workers from labor market entry onwards and estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of vocational training choice, labor supply, and wage progression. Most particularly, our model allows for labor market frictions that vary by skill group and over the business cycle. We find that sources of wage growth differ: learning-by-doing is an important component for unskilled workers early on in their careers, while job mobility is important for workers who acquire skills in an apprenticeship scheme before labor market entry. Likewise, economic downturns affect skill groups through very different channels: unskilled workers lose out from a decline in productivity and human capital, whereas skilled individuals suffer mainly from a lack of mobility.

On the basis of this approach the pricing is then as per the industrial trends in the society, region or community. This approach presumes that patients are price sensitive (ABS, 2014).\nRelated value methodology: by this method the fees is linked with the worth of the services being delivered and treatment been undertaken. This methodology takes the skill set, timing, and risk into consideration.\n\nps\u4ee3\u5199 \uff1a\u533b\u7597\u8d39\u7528\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u5b9a\u4ef7\u89c4\u5219\n\nThere is mostly full shortage of knowledge on how the course has to be assessed for delivery of patient care. Rather than focusing on the expenditure of treatment for patients with particular circumstances in the full cycle of care, the service providers combine and assist the expenditures on the basis of the speciality on the kind of service they provide. This word assessment of expenditure shows that lots of successful and effective service providers are not paid appropriately. It also means that some of the inefficient providers get a little incentive to improve (Gosbee, 2012). How many were there is a need for institutions to be fined if the improvements made by the lesson are the requirement for Great sleepy. The service providers focus on largely paid facilities and try to reduce time by shifting of expenditures to other stakeholders.",

We are interested in their role as risk taking institutions, because we see risk as a pre-condition for sustainability. This paper will explore the relationship between sustainability, emergence, universities and a high level graduate attribute \u2013 global citizenship. We will explore this relationship by proposing a model that frames the theory of sustainability as a quality that emerges from a system. Emergence occurs from unmanaged multiple actions at the local scale and is more likely to occur in environments with greater risk and diversity. Emergence is only identified from the scale above where actions are taking place, so an emergent model of sustainability emphasises the space and interaction between the scales of action and observation. Australian universities play an important role in this space between the scales. They are both actor and observer, and trainers of the present and future actors and observers. By choosing to have higher level graduate attributes like leadership and global citizenship, universities are taking a risk in selecting and advocating for the attributes they think our future thinkers and leaders should have. We present the research design and some preliminary data that aims to determine if the global citizenship graduate attribute can serve as an example of universities' engagement between the scales to help create a sustainable future.\n\nStatistics for USQ ePrint 23504\nStatistics for this ePrint Item\nItem Type: Conference or Workshop Item (Commonwealth Reporting Category E) (Speech)\nRefereed: Yes\nItem Status: Live Archive\nFaculty \/ Department \/ School: Current - USQ Other\nDate Deposited: 31 Jul 2013 05:12\nLast Modified: 18 Jun 2017 23:27\nUncontrolled Keywords: emergence; sustainability; graduate attribute; global citizenship\nFields of Research : 05 Environmental Sciences > 0502 Environmental Science and Management > 050203 Environmental Education and Extension\n13 Education > 1303 Specialist Studies in Education > 130303 Education Assessment and Evaluation\nSocio-Economic Objective: E Expanding Knowledge > 97 Expanding Knowledge > 970105 Expanding Knowledge in the Environmental Sciences\nE Expanding Knowledge > 97 Expanding Knowledge > 970122 Expanding Knowledge in Philosophy and Religious Studies\nE Expanding Knowledge > 97 Expanding Knowledge > 970113 Expanding Knowledge in Education\n\nActions (login required)\n\nView Item Archive Repository Staff Only",

Truly parallel tests are inevitably linked, but not all linked tests are parallel. In temporally ordered assessments like the three parts of the Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP), where forms for infants\/toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children track the achievement of desired results using the same underlying constructs, the last couple of levels of the earlier assessments will be linked to the first couple of levels in the later assessment. On a practical level, linking is important because, although the three DRDP instruments have been designed to work well in three well-defined age-groups (Infant\/Toddler, Preschool and School Age), there are contexts where a perspective across pairs of these instruments is needed.\n\n\nAnnual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, San Francisco, CA\n\nPDF icon KarelitzParrishYamada2006.pdf1.17 MB",

        "text":"JITE v39n1 - At Issue - NAITTE: What is Our Niche?\n\nVolume 39, Number 1\nFall 2001\n\nNAITTE: What Is Our Niche?\n\nGeorge Rogers\nPurdue University\n\nIn a 1999 address to the membership of the National Association of Industrial and Technical Teacher Educators (NAITTE), Professor Eugene Martin challenged NAITTE members to chart their association's course for the future. Martin ( 1999 ) noted, \"associations that survive the times meet the challenges head-on, and leap forward into the new millennium having found ways to seize the moment through their ability to anticipate the future\" (p. 2). Professor Martin questioned whether NAITTE was willing and\/or able to accept the challenge.\n\nBuilding on Martin's remarks, then-President of NAITTE Theodore Lewis presented an article in Volume 37 of the Journal , outlining NAITTE's competitive edge. Lewis proposed that this edge has four dimensions. The first dimension is NAITTE's tradition of scholarship, whose core component is the Journal of Industrial Teacher Education . NAITTE's second competitive edge, according to Lewis, is the quality of the association's members. Since its formation, members of NAITTE have also been the leaders in our professions, industrial arts teacher education, trade and industrial teacher education, technical teacher education, and industrial\/military training. This spectrum of the various facets of industrial teacher education has also been an edge for NAITTE when compared to more narrowly focused groups ( Lewis, 2000 ). Lewis noted that our association's fourth competitive edge is its contributions to the development of young teacher education faculty. NAITTE members, and Journal editors in particular, mentor new faculty in their professional development related to research and scholarship. Lewis concluded by postulating that the competitive dimensions presented were true of the past, and challenged the current membership by asking \"What will give us the edge in the future?\" (p. 108).\n\nI contend that the competitive edge that NAITTE requires if it is to continue its leadership role in the future is very similar to its founding principles. NAITTE was founded in 1937 to develop cooperation among educators engaged in the preparation of teachers in industrial arts, trade and industrial education, and technical education. To me, this founding principle says \"teacher education\" above all other distinctions drawn. Today more than ever, the small pockets of university faculty engaged in industrial teacher education need a flag to rally behind. Many of today's programs are isolated and grouped with faculty members who have no idea what industrial teacher education encompasses. A cursory look at the Industrial Teacher Education Directory ( Bell, 2000 ) indicates only a very small number of departments that are devoted solely to industrial teacher education.\n\nWhy do I contend that to foster our competitive edge in this new millennium, NAITTE must use the rallying flag of industrial teacher education? The answer is clear to me: we cannot and should not be all things to all constituent groups. We must shore up our foundation and build to new heights on that solid footing. If we choose to identify the \"could be served\" ( Martin, 1999, p. 3 ) to include a broader arena, it will have less structural integrity. However, if we select our \"could be served\" as industrial teacher educators, our foundation will be true and well grounded.\n\nIn a 1997 article, Ken Gray argued that human resource development (HRD) and industrial teacher education can and should circle their wagons in a single camp called \"workforce education and development\" ( p. 82 ). Gray noted that these two areas share a common mission, \"to improve the occupational status of the individual student\/client\" (p. 82). Additionally, Gray noted that these two groups share a common base of knowledge.\n\nIn a rebuttal to Gray's ( 1997 ) article, Jeffrey Flesher ( 1998 ) argued that HRD and industrial teacher education, while sharing some interests, do, in fact, have unique missions and should therefore not be labeled as a single profession. Flesher stated that HRD and industrial teacher education \"do not have a single unified philosophical foundation\" (p. 73). Gray observed that HRD programs, which grew out of industrial teacher education, now overshadow their teacher education counterparts at many universities. The HRD profession has grown substantially over the past two decades; and while its historical roots may be tied to industrial teacher education, it is now its own profession. In spite of Lewis's contention that NAITTE is still relevant to HRD ( 2000 ), I would argue that the HRD profession has established its own competitive edge and that industrial teacher education is not included in that mission. Industrial teacher education is a unique field of teacher education.\n\nMartin stated \"unless an association has a strong foundation from which to build and maintain a program of work, it will never have the opportunity to seize the moment by anticipating the future\" (p. 2). It is true that the size of the industrial teacher education enterprise has diminished greatly over the years. So, from a numerical standpoint, it may appear that the best course for our future survival is the broadening of our membership base. However, if our association capitalizes on the need by industrial teacher educators for a unifying agency, we can rebuild our niche of industrial teacher education with a smaller, yet truer, foundation.\n\nTechnology teacher education, trade and industrial teacher education, technical teacher education, and industrial\/military instructor training do have some distinctive attributes, but they share similar missions. Industrial teacher education's mission is to prepare professional educators for employment in middle schools, high schools, technical schools (community colleges), industry, or the military. This mission of preparation of professional educators must comply with various state departments of education and teacher certification guidelines, along with university graduation requirements and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) criteria. One-person industrial teacher education programs need an association, such as NAITTE, from which to build both support and scholarly activities.\n\nBased on the four dimensions of NAITTE's competitive edge proposed by Lewis ( 2000 ), I believe that our association can and will achieve great things in this new era. To continue the tradition of scholarship, the Journal must continue to be our flagship. In order for this to happen, all NAITTE members must reinvigorate their own scholarship, which translates to publishing in the Journal . We, as industrial teacher educators, must also utilize the Journal's scholarship in our teacher preparation courses and professional development activities. The nurturing and mentoring of new industrial teacher education faculty is the responsibility of all NAITTE members. NAITTE membership and submission of manuscripts to the Journal should be an integral component of any graduate program in our field.\n\nNAITTE's competitive edge with regard to the quality of its members has been, and continues to be, outstanding. However, members must publicize their relationship with NAITTE along with their other accomplishments. We must counteract our non-visibility, commented on by Martin ( 1999 ): \"NAITTE never surfaced as an organization whose counsel was sought or revered\" (p. 6). Initiatives such as the Trade and Industrial Teacher Education Standards and the Technology Teacher Education National Science Foundation proposal spearheaded by Zuga and Lewis must carry the NAITTE label.\n\nAlthough Lewis ( 2000 ) identified the eclectic composition of NAITTE as being one of the association's competitive edge dimensions, I contend that this is the area NAITTE must examine. As Martin ( 1999 ) noted, \"we sometimes lose our focus or the reason why we even exist at all, in trying to be all things to all people\" (p. 6). Therefore, who are the professionals that NAITTE desires to rally around its flag? What is our 21st century niche?\n\n\nBell , T.P. (2000-01). Industrial teacher education directory .

        "text":"Professors of Practice\n\nThe statement that follows, prepared by a subcommittee of the Association's Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure, was approved for publication by Committee A in November 2004. Comments are welcome and should be addressed to the Association's Washington office.\n\nThis subcommittee has been asked to comment on a category of full-time non-tenure-track faculty appointments known as \"professors of practice.\" While appointments to these positions and similarly titled positions such as \"practice professors,\" \"professors of the practice,\" and \"professors of professional practice\" have commonly been reserved for practitioners who are appointed because of skills and expertise acquired in nonacademic careers, such appointments are also being offered to individuals with academic backgrounds. These latter professors of practice are principally engaged in teaching and are not expected to be significantly involved in research activities, but they can be distinguished from the large majority of other full-time non-tenure-track teaching faculty in a number of ways. They are usually appointed following a national search. Their academic performance is regularly evaluated according to criteria appropriate to their positions. The length of their renewable term appointments is typically five years rather than one year. Their salaries and benefits often approach those of probationary and tenured faculty members, although they do not match them. They may also have more opportunity to participate in departmental and institutional structures of faculty governance than is ordinarily the case with full-time faculty not on the tenure track, including the opportunity to serve as department chairs.\n\nBy 2001, the number of all full-time non-tenure-track faculty in U.S. colleges and universities was just over 213,000, or 34 percent, of nearly 618,000 full-time faculty members.1The actual number of professors of practice is unknown, but their current number appears to be relatively small. The administration of a major research university in the South estimates that some 10 percent of its entire faculty consists of professors of practice, with their numbers spread across all fields of study (more than one-third of this institution's faculty, most of them in the medical school, are not eligible for tenure). At a research university in the Northeast, limits have been placed on the number of professors of practice; for example, they cannot exceed 20 percent of the institution's law school faculty.\n\nThis new category of appointment, while small, merits com-ment not only because it might grow substantially, as has been true of other full-time appointments off the tenure track since the late 1960s, but also because the category illustrates an anomaly in how colleges and universities treat faculty members who are not eligible for tenure. On the one hand, institutions have sometimes taken steps to improve the professional status of non-tenure-track faculty. This happens, for example, when part-time appointments are converted to full-time appointments, or, as with professors of practice, when salaries and benefits approach those received by probationary and tenured faculty. The AAUP has encouraged these efforts.2\u00a0On the other hand, the more closely the responsibilities, benefits, and privileges of full-time non-tenure-track faculty come to resemble those of faculty who have tenure, the more anomalous is the failure to accord to these faculty members the safeguards for academic freedom that accrue with tenure. A university president has described professors of practice as \"premier participant[s] in the education of students,\" but notwithstanding their crucial role in carrying out this fundamental activity, he proposes to deny them the procedural protections that the tenure system provides.\n\nThe AAUP has long held that all full-time teachers, irrespective of their titles, should either be tenured or probationary for tenure, except for those appointed under special circumstances (for example, short-term replacements for faculty members who are on leave). Following from this basic position, the AAUP has been sharply critical of full-time non-tenure-track appointments, pointing to the adverse effects of these appointments for individual faculty members, for students, for academic freedom, and for the academic profession as a whole.3\u00a0 We see no need to repeat these arguments here. The argument that non-tenure-track appointments endanger academic freedom is yet more compelling, however, when aimed at professors of practice.\n\nSome advocates of establishing professorships of practice have joined with recent critics of tenure to argue that the protection of tenure is appropriate only for research scholars and is unnecessary and inappropriate for those faculty members whose primary obligation is instruction. This argument demeans instruction, especially in institutions where teaching is valued as more than the retelling of what is discovered through research. Even the presentation of a subject that simply recounts what is widely accepted in an academic field of study may incur controversy at a particular time or in a particular locality. More important, the argument fails to appreciate the need for teachers to be free to express themselves fully and frankly in the classroom. Colleges and universities seek to instill in their students a mature independence of mind. Teachers guide students in learning, through instruction and example, how to think independently in order to form their own judgments. Independence of thought is also a characteristic of the successful teacher in higher education. The student thus learns from the teacher, but the learning is diminished if the academic freedom of that teacher is not secure. Freedom in teaching, no less than freedom in research, suffers if faculty, subject to periodic review and serving in positions renewable indefinitely at the pleasure of the administration, fear losing their positions because their opinions are deemed too controversial. Nor is the freedom of faculty to speak their minds without fear of reprisal limited to what they might say in the classroom. Their academic freedom encompasses the right to express opinions on all manner of issues having to do with their institution and its policies and practices.\n\nProfessors of practice are expected to be deeply engaged with students, colleagues, and administrators on a myriad of controversial educational issues, many of which will almost certainly arouse strong opinions. At the same time, professors of practice are necessarily beholden to others\u2014senior tenured colleagues, department chairs, deans, provosts, or presidents\u2014for continued appointment. Because they serve indefinitely at the discretion of others, professors of practice might reasonably assume a stronger need than their tenured colleagues to be cautious in expressing their opinions. The safeguards of tenure are intended to reduce this threat to academic freedom.\n\nWe think it important to observe, however, that providing professors of practice with the opportunity to participate meaningfully in institutional governance carries its own limitations. On the one hand, the faculty's voice, including the voice of those faculty who are not eligible for tenure, should be heard across the range of issues that bear on its responsibilities for teaching and research. On the other hand, participation in governance by faculty who can never have the protections of tenure, and who therefore occupy positions of permanent insecurity, can erode the independence of the faculty's voice. The fundamental solution to this problem is neither to reduce nor to expand the role of professors of practice in the governance of their institutions, but to ensure that they are accorded tenure's protections.\n\nWe think it also important to emphasize what AAUP investigating committee case reports have concluded about the termination of appointments of long-serving full-time nontenured faculty members.4\u00a0Consider the following situation. A professor of practice is notified in her fourteenth year of full-time service that her appointment will not be renewed beyond the next academic year. She is provided an explanation in writing for the decision and is offered the opportunity to file an appeal with a faculty committee to contest the notice. If the action against the faculty member is viewed as a nonreappointment, then her having been provided with a written statement of reasons and an opportunity for faculty review would be in accord with Association-supported standards of academic due process in a case of nonreappointment.\n\nAAUP investigating committees have consistently concluded, however, that an action of the sort described above should not be viewed as a case of nonreappointment. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure calls for a seven-year maximum period of probation, to be followed by either tenure or nonretention. Faculty members who are continued in full-time service beyond the probationary period are considered by the Association to be entitled through length of service to the safeguards of academic due process that accrue with tenure, even in the absence of institutional regulations to that effect. In the case described above, the AAUP would expect the professor of practice to have the opportunity to contest the stated grounds for nonretention in an adjudicative proceeding before a faculty hearing body, with the burden of proof on the administration to demonstrate adequacy of cause for the proposed termination of her services.\n\nWe recognize that those who support professor-of-practice appointments, while they respect principles of academic freedom and tenure, would prefer to carve out an exception to these principles with regard to full-time teachers who are not expected to expand knowledge through research and publication. But severing the connection between teaching and tenure impair... (truncated)",

It is an applied field of study aiming at the application of descriptive research outcomes in regular instructional settings. The present study was designed to critically review the process of instructional design at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU). It was survey study. Population of the study consisted of 120 academicians of different academic department of AIOU. Survey was conducted through questionnaire for academic staff. It was revealed that need assessment is not done before conceiving the outlines of a course. Also the course did not contain sufficient activities, picture and illustrations. It was also found that did not confirm the course objectives. The study recommended that proper of the course writers for distance learning may be arranged.\n\nAnahtar kelimeler :\n\u00d6zet \u0130ngilizce :\n\nTam metin (T\u00fcrk\u00e7e) :\nPayla\u015f :\nBenzer Makaleler\nYorum Yap\n  \u2022 Ad\u0131n\u0131z :\n  \u2022 G\u00fcvenlik Kodu :\n  \u2022 Yorum :",
