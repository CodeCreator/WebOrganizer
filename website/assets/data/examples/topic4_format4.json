        "text":"Anyone any experience with essay writing services?\n\nCasting around for some work. One obvious possibility is the various essay writing services out there. I should be able to turn out an econ essay after all.\n\nAnyone got any experience as a writer of them? As a supplier to these companies? Any suggestions and all that?\n\nI have something of a feeling that this is generally being done by Third World types and the rates of pay reflect that but who knows, maybe that\u2019s not true?\n\n19 thoughts on \u201cAnyone any experience with essay writing services?\u201d\n\n  1. One obvious destination of your writing skills is to cast your bread on the waters of e-reader publishing, such as Amazon Kindle. All you need is an MS Word document and a cover image, register, upload your stuff, choose a published price, and Bob\u2019s your proverbial relative.\n\n    I suggest a theme for your first novelette: a fat, lefty-lauded, twat who knows feck-all about anything, whose pronouncements are pounced on by other twats as genius, but which inevitably contain schoolboy fallacies.\n\n    Oh, and he\u2019s got an inferiority complex because he\u2019s only got a tiny dick.\n\n  2. Bloke in Germany in Hong Kong\n\n    You seem determined to earn as little as possible from it.\n\n    Because most audiences are small you have to have a speciality that keeps the group of suppliers small to earn a living, and customers who give a shit about quality. General writing to a low standard for an audience of 1 is therefore a bad move.\n\n  3. BiG does have a point.You have the writing talent so worth looking for a wider field to exploit it.\n    Agrees with my philosophy. Look for what people want. Actually LOOK & actually WANT. Not try & flog what\u2019s easy for the flogger. Then work out a way to supply.\n\n    I suffered watching Shades of Grey, last night. I think it may have been in Spanish. (Watched as in sat in the same room & occasionally made random comments to give the illusion of being awake) But there seems to be an inexhaustible female demand for S&M novels.\n\n  4. Um, you have made me think. I could start an essay with something like \u201cWhen I asked Ralph Miliband if he knew a good pub on Fleet Street\u2026..\u201d or \u201cMonty wanted to know where the tanks were, so I told him they were stuck on a hill in The Teutoberger\u2026..\u201d and then go on to the economic implications.\n\n  5. BiS\n\n    Tele5. My wife watched it too. I read a book and grunted from time to time. She thought it wasn\u2019t THAT bad. Me, it was worse than I expected and my expectations were already rock bottom. Vacuous was the word that came to mind, as it does (to paraphrase the Mogg).\n\n    Soft porn for women. Still as you say. There is obviously a market (all female this one) and it seems to be a big one.\n\n    Needs satisfying (the market I mean).\n\n  6. Out of interest, bb, your\u2019s get frisky. Mine did. Maybe the benefits of Tim moving into the market would be more nooky & better control of the household finances.\n\n  7. I\u2019ve not come across these services before. Isn\u2019t it cheating?\n\n    I looked up a UK service which charges \u00a3122 per 1,000 words for its \u201c2:2\u201d service, delivered within 7 days. There\u2019s also the 2:1 (\u00a3138) or the 1st (\u00a3275).\n\n    On that basis the rate for the writers must be pretty poxy, even at \u20181st\u2019 level.\n\n    They claim not to reuse essays but presumably recycling content (at least partially) is the best way to generate a profit.\n\n    I wonder how they do it? It occurs to me that the most profitable method for something like this would be to pay an Indian postgrad tuppence to do each one, then pay a native English speaker to quickly edit and sharpen up the prose.\n\n    I think I\u2019d have a go at the spanky porn first\u2026\n\n  8. They will recycle essays, randomly inserting from a range of quotes \/ paraphrases.\n    The lecturers get their own back by doing minor changes to essay questions each year. So what would get you an A2 one year with a particular essay will get you a E16 the following year as its not answering the question.\n\n  9. The other issue with any sort of re-used content is that the widespread use of software like Turnitin which looks for plagiarism or copying: sell the same chunks of boilerplate a couple of times and it\u2019ll start setting off the warning flags.\n\n    Besides, in some fields essay-writing has been automated for decades:-\n\n  10. A year or so ago I got an email from one of these sites asking me to sign up as a writer. I thought: may as well, I can turn down stuff if I\u2019m busy or not interested.\n    So I invested 30 minutes in typing up details. Subsequently never heard a squeek. You can\u2019t speculatively send them stuff as you don\u2019t knopw what stuff is needed. Whether you can make money from these things will depend on exactly which services you sign up with, and how much they bother to ask you for stuff. It\u2019s the classic neoliberal precarious zero hours exploitation, initt. \ud83d\ude42\n\n  11. Essay writing services, Tim? If it became common knowledge that you were facilitating cheating, your reputation would be seriously damaged. And the Tuber would gloat. So don\u2019t do it.\n\n  12. @Tim Worstall. This sounds desperate. I prefer your other idea (new site with advertising). You could perhaps tag on a paid for \u2018subscribe to \u2018my essays\u201d section which offers answers on the type of questions commonly dealt with on Economics degree courses within that. Depends on how distasteful you might find having to argue both the left and right perspective rather than just demolishing the former.\n\n  13. An after thought\u2026I hear from a friend of a friend that there are mega-bucks to be made from re-writing doctoral theses in good English for Gulf state students at Cambridge.\n\n    The science was there, just not the English. Supervisor tells student to improve English: student hires help, as his government pays\u2026.Not sure how you tap into such networks, but you are talking (I believe) \u00a35000 for 25 hrs editing (\u00a3200 hr).\n\n    Once, I had a contact at a German university. She paid me \u00a330 to correct her tenses and vocabulary in papers to be published in Enhlish language journals. It took me 30 minutes a paper at most.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

I chose A, but didn't feel good about any of the answers. I thought that B was incorrect because the author of passage A provided that these flat tax systems are inherently less complex, making tax avoidance significantly more difficult. They even reference the flat tax system in Estonia, where there are \"no schedule of rates, no deductions.\" I ruled out B based on this information in the text, as I thought the simplistic nature of the flat tax system would get rid of the loopholes and special deductions referenced in B and would have an easy retort to the author of A had they responded with B.

We aren't looking to respond to the entire argument presented by Author A, but only to the last argument she made, which basically boiled down to \"high earners are paying the same as lower earners anyway, so progressive taxes don't really work and we should switch to a flaw tax.\" Author B's response could be what answer B says, that the problem isn't that the tax is progressive, but just that it has too many loopholes. Don't scrap the progressive tax and switch to a flat tax, but just fix the loopholes!\n\nGet the most out of your LSAT Prep Plus subscription.\n\nAnalyze and track your performance with our Testing and Analytics Package.",

The troubles appear to start almost right from the appointment of a non-academic as Director.\n\n[ Aside: Just the other day, I linked to the first chapter (pdf) of Amanda Goodall's Socrates in the Boardroom: Why Research Universities Should be Led by Top Scholars. While academics are no angels, appointing a bureaucrat \/ businessman as the first director of an academic institution is pretty atrocious. ]\n\nBack to IIM-Shillong. Here's some background on Director Ashoke Kumar Datta:\n\nDutta's profile includes 40 years of erratic corporate experience and does not list any academic credentials. Directors and faculty at IIMs are generally required to have a PhD in their subject.\n\nMr Dutta's biodata lists his qualification as PGDM from IIM Calcutta and 2 years on the doctoral program of Case Western University between 1971-73 (he left without receiving the degree).\n\nAt the time of his appointment Mr Ashoke Dutta was already past the age of 60, a fact which should have disqualified him from what is meant to be a five year term.\n\nAnd here's a partial list of some of the shady things that an academic institution would be ashamed to put on its website:\n\na) Daily faculty meeting for 1 hour between 9 and 10 am with no specific agenda\n\nb) Administrative staff being invited to attend faculty meetings where they have no locus standi\n\nc) Administrative staff interrupting lectures on minor pretexts.\n\nd) Officer on Special Duty (Finance) sending emails questioning professors on issues related to CAT interview selections\n\ne) Professors being humiliated in faculty meetings, intimidated verbally and through memos; and being told by the director \"you are welcome to leave\" if they raised their voice on any issue, including issues like CPF (contributory provident fund) not being provided by IIM Shillong, as per prevailing laws of the land.\n\nThere's a lot more in that report, and all pretty shocking. Go read the whole thing.\n\n\n  1. Anonymous said...\n\n    But is IIM Shillong (or any other IIM for that matter) an academic institution?\n\n  2. Anonymous said...\n\n    This is not really very surprising.\n    At least the point (e) is pretty common in one iit. There the director sends humiliating e-mail to faculty member (with copy to all faculty members). They also try to deny some part of CPF to the people who left before 7 years of service. Verbal abuse is also common.\n\n    The bottom line is in Indian system, institute heads do have a lot of power. Often they have strong political connection. Individuals just can't fight against them.\n\n  3. pradeepkumar said...\n\n    Anonymous must spell out the name IIT directors, who do all sort of these things.

Check with your Department Chairman.\n\n  16. Anonymous said...\n\n    Dear Abi and others,\n\n    Things may vary a lot among even iitx. When I join IIT Guwahati 4-5 years back that time there was no start-up grant for each faculty. Rather HOD used to give the money from the money dept. had (which was not same for each faculty member). Now, they have changed for the better and give start-up grant for each faculty member.\n\n    My point is it is hard to generalize everything. Do you people really know that all new iits give individual start-up grant?\n\n    One caution to the person who asked this question - never ever believe verbal assurance. Ask for a signed letter.",

        "text":"No. of Recommendations: 1\nEvery time I go into an interview, I figure out one more thing that I should have done, sigh! I'm hoping I didn't screw up too badly this time around but not holding my breath. Since I have so much of it still going around in my head, I'm guessing it would help if I share it here.\n\nI've learned that going into an interview is like selling your services. Unfortunately, I'm not a seller. I even have a hard time \"selling\" my work to my boss when evaluation time rolls around. So, I was thinking of the time we were soliciting quotes for building a patio in our house. The highest bid won the business because: they worked with us to figure out what we needed, they proposed several solutions that would meet our needs, and they showed us what they have done and could be done in our property.\n\nI also remember one of the contractors that I talked to. He listened to our needs, told us he could do the job and gave us the quote. He didn't discuss different alternatives, didn't show us what he has done or explain how he came up with the estimate. Unfortunately, I have had interviews go like that. I missed all the opportunities to tell the hiring manager why I was perfect for the job.\n\nWith that in mind, I set out to prepare for this last interview. For the \"tell me about yourself\" question I talked about how my experience meets their requirements. I even went out and told them exactly that in the interview. In the past I have thought that by listing my accomplishments I would imply that there is a match. I decided I needed to explicitly say it for them to know it.\n\nOn the flip side, I missed the opportunity to explain how I am \"uniquely\" qualified for the position. I recognized this opportunity after the fact since it came in by them pointing out the gap that I may have in my experience. Now that I think about it I also got asked why I wanted to move from hardware to software. The truth of the matter is that everyone has a gap unless they were the ones doing the exact same job in the exact same company before. So, I need to shift away from focusing in the deficiency, figure out how I would cover the gap, and explain how my past experience can help in covering the gap much better than anyone else. I need to remember that what they are really asking is how they can justify to their upper management hiring someone outside of their group to do the job. I hate those missed opportunities!\n\n- zol\nPrint the post Back To Top\nNo. of Recommendations: 1\nI hate those missed opportunities!\n\nYou might send a thank-you email to the interviewer and add the sales pitch you think you should've given. Not too long and wordy, mind, make a brisk point or two. You might also mention how much you'd enjoy working for him\/her or with their team or customers\/suppliers, whatever is most appropriate.\n\nWhenever I interviewed for professional jobs, I sent a thank-you note (later a thank-you email) and reiterated my good fit with their needs. It didn't always work, but usually. One hiring manager thought I wasn't a good fit for the job, but hung onto my info and contacted me 6 months later when she was staffing up a new department. I was her first hire there!\n\nBefore getting professional jobs, I was always offered positions on the spot. When someone articulate, upbeat, nicely groomed and dressed goes after a low-end job, they usually blow away the competition. At least that worked for me in decades past.\n\nEasy for me to pontificate now that I'm retired...I doubt I'd fare so well in today's job market.\n\nWhile prepping for teaching a class this fall in user interface design (DH is a college computer science instructor), a few minutes ago my husband found a book of mine on that subject that I used in that job referenced above. heh.\nPrint the post Back To Top\nNo. of Recommendations: 1\nI'm going to second alstro's advice. If you can send a follow-up email, it will give you a chance to not only thank them for their time, but also to emphasize any points you want to make about why you're a good fit for the position. Possibly even why the gap could work to their advantage.\n\nI landed the job I have now a little over 4 years ago. At an appreciation dinner in April, I had the opportunity to talk about all the changes our office had been through in the past 18 months. My former boss was in attendance. I pointed out how excited I had been to get the job and mentioned that I had even sent a follow-up email to him expanding on why I was the right person for it. He smiled at me from the audience and said \"And that's what put you over the top\"\n\nPrint the post Back To Top",

        "text":"Musical Devices.....\n\nPosted by: C H O P I N\n\nMusical Devices..... - 12\/07\/07 01:33 PM\n\nPart of my music course requires me (and the others who took music) to sit an exam that tests our listening abilities. This is my weakest area, I usualy only get around 60 - 70 %, which is ok, but not fantastic, so I would like to push myself further in order to acheive better grades. Although our teacher tells us about different musical devices, he doesn't really explain what they do in the music.\nThe hardest part of the exam is when a piece of music is played and we have to pick out the musical devices used in the piece and then explain what \"atmosphere\" it gives the music and how. Picking out the devices isn't too bad but trying to put what it does for the music is quite difficult (for me). I was wondering if there were any general patterns for certain devices used in music that provide the listener with an inflicted atmosphere. For example:\n\n1.) A pedal is a sustained or repeated note in the bass (usualy), an inverted pedal is a sustained or repeated note higher up on the grand staff. But how does a pedal inflict a mood? does a pedal allways create tension?\n\n2.) Imitation is where a phrase is repeated with a small variation to make it more interesting than the first (original) time. How can a repeated phrase inflict a certain atmosphere or feeling?\n\n3.) Sequencing is similar to imitation except the phrase is repeated at a different pitch.\n\nThats a handful of musical devices I can think of, but trying to explain WHAT the acheive in the music is very hard... any tips?\n\nIn the exam they played the theme from harry potter, and asked what musical devices made it sound \"magical\"... I wasn't really sure how to approach the question... I mean what does make it sound magical and mysterious?\n\nAny advice on handeling questions like this would be GREATLY appreciated...\n\nThanks all,\n\nPosted by: Morodiene\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/07\/07 02:34 PM\n\nInteresting question, but wow, most of this stuff is just intuitive, and so I never sat down and pinpointed what it does, so here goes:\n\n1) Pedal doesn't always create tension. It can also be very calming, like a drone. It would have to depend upon the context in which it is used. For example, if you have a piece that has harmonic motion to it and all of a sudden you have a pedal, then it will create tension until that harmony changes. However, if a piece begins with this, it will most likely set up a drone-like effect, making it seem very calm and unmoving.\n\n2) Imitation\/repetition in this case is not assigned to any particular feeling. Repetition is found in nature and so we repeat because it gives clarity to what is being said (whatever feeling that may be). The human brain is designed to pick up on patterns, so this device makes it interesting for the listener as well. But clarity and interest in and of themselves are not feelings. They are just a qualities.\n\n3) Same as above. The more variation in a repetition, the more interest it gives the listener, like a puzzle to figure out the pattern.\n\nAs far as what musical devices make the harry potter theme sound magical (without having heard it recently), my guess would be the harmonic structure (use of secondary chords), instrumentation, and allusions to pieces we already associate with \"magical\".\nPosted by: C H O P I N\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/07\/07 04:02 PM\n\nThanks Morodiene, the questions we get are suprisingly difficult, and hitting exatly what the examiners want as answers seems to be very hard indeed. They also played us the james bond theme (about 5 times) and we had to fill in a table. One side of the table said \"musical devices used\" the other said \"the atmosphere it creates\".... I lost count of how many times I repeated myself, saying \"so and so made the music exciting\"\nPosted by: Morodiene\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/08\/07 10:10 AM\n\nIf this is not a composition class, I can hardly see the point. There is a difference between recognizing something that needs to sound a certain way, and saying what the outcome is of that particular device. Even in composition, I don't teach it in this manner, however.\n\nAre they expecting that each \"musical device\" has one affect it produces? Or do they think that there might be several outcomes depending on the listener and the context in which the device is used?\nPosted by: Gyro\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/08\/07 10:57 AM\n\nYou're having trouble on the second part\nbecause you're taking it too seriously\nand thinking that there actually some real\nsignificance to it. There is none.\nThis is just typical academic bull___\nand has no real-world meaning. The way\nto get good grades is to simply parrot\nback what the teacher wants you to say.\nTrying to strain yourself, looking for\na meaningful answer, is useless, because\nthere is no meaningful answer except\nwhat the teacher wants to hear--from your\nlectures, class discussions, textbook, etc., you\nneed to figure out what kind of answers\nthe teacher wants, and then simply give him\nthese kinds of answers, even if they\nmight seem completely stupid.\nPosted by: pianojerome\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/08\/07 11:16 AM\n\n\nWhy would professors teach this \"typical academic bull____\" if it doesn't make any sense, if it isn't meaningful, and if it is just \"completely stupid\"? How would they even come up with it in the first place, if it didn't make some meaningful sense to them?\nPosted by: C H O P I N\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/08\/07 03:41 PM\n\nAlthough Gyro's post may seem \"out of the box\" it does seem to have a ring of truth... Firstly Let me answer Morodiene. GCSE music consists of a group of kids (some with musical backgounds and a handful with none). To get the GCSE in music we have to compose a piece of music (25%) perform a solo piece and an ensemble piece (25%) then work at an \"integrated assignment\" which is a mixture of all 3 skills, which is also worth 25%. Finally we have the listening paper. Also 25%.\n\nSo to answer your question, nope it's not a composition class, I wish it was! By the looks of things the examiners seem to want a musical device that does one thing... There doesn't seem to be any prizes for your own opinions, and how it makes you feel (because the papers are marked from example answers!!!!) In that respect Gyro's point appears to be right, tell them what they want to hear. But what DO they want to hear?\n\nSeems rediculous to me.\n\nPosted by: keyboardklutz\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/09\/07 02:23 AM\n\nI've just started a GCSE music class. I taught OCR for about 10 years but haven't taught any since the boards rewrote their syllabi (about 4 or 5 years ago).\n\nMuch of education is as Gyro paints it - the marking is done by independents who are paid by the script. I've heard some subjects are so hard up for markers they're offering it to undergraduates. So yes, find what they want to hear. The questions you posted do seem a bit daft but they're not difficult as long as you have your list of devices and their affects in your head. Ask you teacher for a comprehensive list that you could commit to memory. Which board are you taking?\n\nOn a more positive note - that's easily done, the rest (learning about music) is a joy which enriches you.\nPosted by: C H O P I N\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/09\/07 09:31 AM\n\nI believe I'm on AQA, not OCR (my ICT is OCR though) Finding what they want to hear is quite difficult sometimes, and I do need a comprehensive list like you suggested, wether or not my teacher has one or not, we'll see.\n\nIn the James Bond question, with the table, I listed imitation as a musical device, (the tune repeats a lot with different instruments and variations) but I was at a loss on how to explain \"what atmosphere\" it provides. I mean, surely I'd have to put something like: \"The phrase that is repeated gives an atmosphere of excitement throughout the piece\" ?\n\nThere was also alot of dissonance, Usualy dissonance is used to cause distress, or in this case it seemed to be used as a resolution to the piece's musical climaxes.\n\nFurthermore I ended up repeating my self alot ( especially in these paticular styled questions), the piece was exciting throughout, so what am I supposed to put under \"atmosphere\" when all of the devices appear to do simillar things?\n\n\nPosted by: keyboardklutz\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/09\/07 10:01 AM\n\nIf you can find any youtube or other links with exactly the music your describing I can answer some questions.\n\nWith the James Bond, off the top of my head, the initial low chromatic ostinato intro gives an expectant spooky atmosphere - something slithering? sliding?. The second note in the theme forms a tritone (devil's interval) with the accompaniment. The theme itself is stepwise in the minor giving the effect of someone creeping up on you\/him. The key, because of the chromatic movement, is not very clear. Again indicating a dangerous\/insecure atmosphere.\n\nYou should also be able to write like this about your own compositions. Also, get yourself a long list of suitable conjunctions.\nPosted by: John Citron\n\nRe: Musical Devices..... - 12\/09\/07 12:57 PM\n\nThis sounds more like a music philosophy class than a practical music class.\n\nBut I think I know what your instructor is looking for. Music is made up of different textures. By adding and subracting and controlling these textures in different ways through rhythm, tempo, and dynamics, music can represent different moods.\n\nA good example would be the use of repeated strings in a disonant key to represent tension. Dissonance alone creates tension, but by repeating this with stringed instruments, the tension can build up more. Think \"Jaws\" or some other scary movie where the strings are used like this.\n\nMusical textures can also be used to represent other devices such as bells and tambourines when they are not available on the piano, for example. Mozart does this in his Rondo a la Turca with the arpeggiated bass line and grace notes. These represent th... (truncated)",

I'm going to the party Ms. Jessica is hosting. She has really good snacks and rules. Hop on over and check out this party. It's a BYOB! Grab your beverage and link up!\n\nOne more day to enter my give away! Few have entered many will win!!\n\n\n  1. I am the worst at just setting things down..

I don't even know how to spell embarrassed.\n\n  5. Ms. Jessica's linky has been fun! It brought me to your blog as a new follower! Did you get one of those super cool pencil sharpeners that everybody is talking about? I tried to get one and they are all sold out right now. Big bummer!

I read an article one that said \"it'll take you five seconds to put it away now, but five minutes later\" (because at that point you'll have a whole pile to put away!)

        "text":"March 2nd, 2010\n\nCharacteristics of Good Teachers\n\n\nOccasionally we need a reminder like this: based on a thorough literature review, Paul Ramsden, a noted researcher on teaching and learning, along with several co-authors offered this description of good teachers.\n\n\u00b7 Good teachers are also good learners; for example, they learn through their own reading, by participating in a variety of professional-development activities, by listening to their students, by sharing ideas with their colleagues, and by reflecting on classroom interactions and students\u2019 achievements. Good teaching is therefore dynamic, reflective, and constantly evolving.\n\n\u00b7 Good teachers display enthusiasm for their subject and a desire to share it with their students.\n\n\u00b7 Good teachers know how to modify their teaching strategies according to the particular students, subject matter, and learning environment.\n\n\u00b7 Good teachers encourage learning for understanding and are concerned with developing their students\u2019 critical-thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and problem-approach behaviors.\n\n\u00b7 Good teachers demonstrate an ability to transform and extend knowledge, rather than merely transmitting it; they draw on their knowledge of their subject, their knowledge of their learners, and their general pedagogical knowledge to transform the concepts of the discipline into terms that are understandable to their students.\n\n\u00b7 Good teachers set clear goals, use valid and appropriate assessment methods, and provide high-quality feedback to their students.\n\n\u00b7 Good teachers show respect for their students; they are interested in both their professional and their personal growth, encourage their independence, and sustain high expectations of them.\n\nThe description sets the bar high. But it so ably captures the essence of what we should aspire to be and do for our students.\n\nReference, Ramsden, P. D., Margetson, E. M. and Clarke, S. Recognizing and Rewarding Good Teaching. Canberra: Australian Government Printing Services, 1995.\n\n  \u2022 Teachers are learners. From my Christian education learning, I discovered that the Hebrew words for teach and learn are the same. So\u2026 teachers are intense learners.\n\n    Great characteristic list of teachers.\n\n  \u2022 Great post! These are things I am always striving to do!\n\n  \u2022 Sebastian Tharakan\n\n    This reminds me of a quotation of Literature Nobel Laureate: Rabindranath Tagore, who reminds us that a teacher should always be a student; always willing to learn and re-learn in his quotation which runs thus: \"\u201cA teacher can never truly teach unless he is still learning himself. A lamp can never light another lamp unless it continues to burn its own flame. The teacher who has come to the end of his subject, who has no living traffic with knowledge, but merely repeats his lesson to his students can only load their minds not quicken them.\u201d Dedicated teachers teach not just because it is their job; but more because, teaching is their passion, and it is this passion that impels them to constantly strive towards improvement and excellence.\n\n  \u2022 1. Educators must think Teachering is \"Fun\".\n    2. Must be of th type who sees the glass is half full. Must possess a positive mental attitude.\n    3. Must always been looking for that approach that opens the door to learning\u2026it might be taking something that is occuring in the news that has public attention and tailoring it into the topic of the day.\n    4. Must not let the administrators get in the path of being honest with the student(s).\n    5. Must always speak the truth! Once credibilty is lost\u2026it is lost!\n\n  \u2022 All fine and good, but administrators don't get that. I still see good teachers leaving because administrators put up all kinds of roadblocks to progress. Case in point, Building Information Modeling to hand drafting and 2D CADD. Guess who wins, not the future for students. Moving the old goats is more difficult than moving a mountain.\n\n    I disagree with the glass half full comment, understanding that it maybe the glass is to large or that the fluid is to small should also be evaluated.\n\n  \u2022 I like to tell students, \u201cAll you need to get a good grade in this class is motivation. The bad news, my friends, is that if you don\u2019t have it you may not even pass.\u201d The same is true for college instructors. All you need to succeed is motivation. Motivation to become a subject matter expert. Motivation to put in the time to prepare. Motivation to develop your skills as an instructor. Motivation to care about your students\u2019 success. The bad news, my friends, is that if you don\u2019t have it you may not even pass.\n\n  \u2022 Most of all, a good teacher should WANT to be a teacher. As a professional who always try to improve his\/her status in order to be a better teacher hour by hour, day by day.\n\n  \u2022 G.Deepika\n\n    a good answer",
