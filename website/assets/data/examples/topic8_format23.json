        "text":"Safe Tan Review\n\n...for ordinary people looking for an extraordinary tan!...\n\nClick HERE for Tanning Facts & Information.\nRead different Tanning Articles HERE.\nTanning Basics HERE.\n\nThis self tanner has NO bad smell; in my opinion, it's quite odorless!\nI really like the natural color- you can build it and build it to get a really deep tan, if desired.\nHighly Recommended!!\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 is designed to allow anyone to look better - without exposing your skin to the harmful effects of the sun, and without the use of harsh chemicals and preservatives!\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 provides instant natural colour immediately - without the mess or damage caused by other methods of tanning! No streaking, staining or smell! It's special formula adjusts to each individual's skin tone, providing you with a tan that not only looks natural, but also fades like a real tan.\n\nSafe, long lasting and economical to use, the joy of using Safe Tan\u2122 is that it's simple, easy and quick to apply!\n\nInstant colour means you can see exactly where you've applied colour. Once you understand how it works, it's virtually foolproof. And even if you do happen to make a mistake, it's fully washable within the first hour.\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 dries almost immediately - except for the luxuriant moisturizers, leaving you with rich warm colour and beautifully soft skin.\n\nWith Safe Tan\u2122, you control the colour. Spray directly from the bottle onto your body \/ skin or the paddle applicator, and then spread \/ blend the colour. The instant colour allows you to see exactly where you've been.\n\nOnce you've finished your application, it's easy to quickly check your skin to ensure you have even, smooth colour. If you've missed an area - simply apply colour to those areas.\n\nAnd if you've made a mistake - there's no need to panic... Safe Tan\u2122 is fully washable for the first hour after application. The end result is no missed areas or patchy application!\n\nSafe Tan\u2122's easy application means it's also great for 'touch ups', camoflaging white strap marks etc. and maintaining your tan - face and body.\n\nSafe Tan\u2122's carefully designed blend of moisturisers and carriers take the colour and emollients down into three layers of skin*.\n\nSo unlike many other self-tanners, it's not a topical application sitting on the surface. As your skin naturally exfoliates, it simply exposes the tanned lower layers beneath.\n\nThe result is that your tan fades gradually and naturally just like a real suntan.\n\nYou have the choice to allow your tan to fade, or if you want to maintain your desired tan, simply re-apply about once a week.\n\n* These 3 layers of the skin are found in the surface layer of the epidermis - otherwise known as the stratum corneum. As there are no blood vessels located within the epidermis, Safe Tan\u2122 does not cross the blood barrier.\n\nThe ultimate compliment to a beautiful tanned body.... a natural and healthy tanned face!\n\nAt last it's possible to have an easy, safe, and fool-proof 'outdoor look' on your face. No orange hued self-tanner look.\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 uses only facial grade moisturisers and doesn't discolour nails, hair, eyebrows or other facial hair. It can be applied over the eyelids and ears to create a believable, natural tan - tanning your face to perfection.\n\nSome people even find that being able to tan your face so easily reduces the need for foundation \/ makeup.\n\n[Note: As the skin on your face exfoliates more quickly than the rest of your body (due to more frequent washing etc.), re-applying on your face every 3 - 4 days will maintain your desired colour. And the best part is - it will only take you a few minutes!).\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 has a cold pressed Aloe Vera base. Aloe Vera is a hydrator of skin, as well as a moisturiser and emollient; it provides a wide range of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides.\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 also contains NO preservatives, emulsifiers, allergens or irritants. It offers only the best emollients, nutrients, humectants and skin care ingredients.\n\nOne of the most unique benefits of Safe Tan\u2122's special Aloe-carriercombination is that it takes the colour and emollients right down to 3 layers of skin.\n\nSo when you put Safe Tan\u2122 on, you're actually hydrating and moisturising your skin - evening out the vagaries of pigmentation caused by years of exposure to hostile environmental pollutants and irritants, and also smoothing out fine lines in the skin's surface. The result on the skin is a smoother and more even appearance, while it mutes veins and hides flaws.\n\nYou not only end up with warm rich colour, but beautifully soft skin!\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 doesn't contain harmful AHA's.\n\nRecent studies sponsored by the FDA's (Food & Drug Administration) Office of Women's Health, have confirmed that applying an AHA to the skin can make people more susceptible to the damaging effects of the sun, including sunburn.\n\nSafe Tan\u2122 does not contain harsh chemicals which normally create a reaction on the surface of the skin, and which are a major cause of odour or offensive smell.\n\nAs there is no odour or offensive smell, this makes Safe Tan\u2122 pleasant to apply, and is an especially important factor for anyone sensative to odours and chemical smell (including pregnant women).\n\nSafe Tan\u2122's unique formula works with the skin's natural Amino Acids, and adjusts to each individual's skin tones. This gives a realistic and natural colour and your own unique tan.\n\nThis differs from the self-tanner formulas, which often contain chemicals that react with Melanin in the skin, which can then result in the skin taking on an unnatural orange hue.\n\nBecause Safe Tan\u2122 works with each individual's skin and takes colour down 'into' 3 layers or skin* - this explains why Safe Tan\u2122 is suitable for anyone - regardless of age, sex, skin type or colour.\n\n[* This is in contrast to many 'topical' self-tanners where colour sits on the surface of the skin, and why individuals are often faced with the difficult and frustrating task of trying to 'match' a product or colour to their skin.]\n\nIt's significant that the formula in Safe Tan\u2122 does not contain chemicals that are designed to react with the skin's melanin, - the level of which (i.e. melanin) differs individually in the skin of each person.\n\nThe colour in Safe Tan\u2122 is absorbed down into 3 layers of skin. So as the skin is sloughed off and the lower layers are exposed, - thanks to the carriers, the skin underneath is already tanned and moisturised.\n\nTherefore the tan fades out naturally and gradually just as with a real suntan. There's NO blotchy fade out, rusty elbows, knees and ankles etc.\n\n\nwuzzyangel said...\n\nHaha it's got the sponge brush!! I'd feel like I was painting myself! :) But it would apply it better then spray alone!\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nI can't seem to find Safe Tan anywhere. The product on the link you posted \"Buy Safe Tan Here\" looks nothing like the product you have pictured. Please help! Thank you!\n\nWhitney & the full effect said...\n\n@anonymous They totally re-did their packaging wow!! This post was back in 9\/13\/2009 so a couple of years makes a bit of a difference :)",

Very nice for picking up and applying very sheer layers of pigmented blush or bronzer, and you can work the colour up subtly. Though I do find I prefer a fan brush for cheeks, as it gives similar coverage, but it tends to give a better shape to the area, and better control. This brush isn't much for blending, you'll need to use something else to really blend out products, as the fine, long white fibres are just a bit too long to be able to blend on their own, and the denser black bristles underneath aren't really able to blend properly because of the length of the longer fibres.\n\nOne thing I do find this useful for is for applying my EL Double Wear foundation, as I've found it gives a more natural, airbrushed effect than a denser stippling brush or foundation brush, as it's a very heavy coverage foundation, and the very fine bristles allow for sheerer application. The brush does tend to soak up liquid products, so a spritz with water before dabbing into the foundation is a must, I find it helps it glide along a little easier too. I tend to work section by section, stipple, then smooth the foundation over with the fine bristles, and give a gentle buff to finish. I also find the Double Wear is a little heavy on bristles, and will dry hard if I forget to wash a brush straight away, so I prefer to use a cheaper brush so as not to accidentally damage them.\n\nAs with a lot of the e.l.f. products, they price is nice, the quality reasonable (especially given the price), but it's not a super star or anything. A good little stand by, it's not going to hurt to have it, or break the bank. You might find some suitable applications for it, you may not, depending on the uses you require it for.\n\nIs this review helpful?

I mean ok, for that price (3$) it's really not that big of a deal, but it's not as good as a lot of people are saying. For my taste it's not dense enough and sucks up quite a lot of product. If you don't wash your brushes too often, you can swipe your face with the leftovers (I have only used it with foundation though, it probably does a good job with cream blush). It is soft though and still does a relatively good job at creating a nice finish. But you'll need to work in the product REALLY well and take your time on this. So it's definetely not a brush to use in a hurry. But as I said, it does a relatively decent job. But I would not recommend it.\n\nIs this review helpful?

I haven't used any other stippling brushes as I have only just started studying for my make-up artistry qualification but I have used many other methods of applying foundation, including an airbrush system and in my opinion this stippling brush has given me a much better finish! I was only intending on doing light coverage but once you see how nice the finish is, you kinda wanna take it all the way! I love love love this brush and I can't wait to use it on my models, I think that considering its price you should go for it, I mean if you don't use it with a liquid foundation like I did (maybelline dream satin liquid, light porcelain my perfect shade!) then I'm sure you could find another use for it as it can be used with dry or wet products, all in all I say give it a chance!\n\nIs this review helpful?

With all these great reviews you'd think this was ACTUALLY a dupe for a Mac 187, it's not, it's not even close!\nThe picture shown above looks so much more abundant hair-wise than what it actually is. It's sparse, and soaks up all liquid foundation, instead of putting it on your face. If you use expensive foundation, this is a huge con.\nBut wait ladies, I've found some good uses for this. If you do like to stipple on your foundation, I find taking a hair band (clean n new of course) and wrapping it around the base of this to have a little more control over the brush, and add some density. But id rather spend more money for a better brush when using expensive foundations to stipple on.\nThis is also good to use for blushes or bronzers that are too pigmented, since it lacks density, it doesn't pick up a lot of color. I don't wear liquid foundation regularly, but I do use this for my highly pigmented blushes to save myself from a clown face. I will definitely not repurchase this. Next time I'll be going for the Sonia kashuk I think.\n\nIs this review helpful?

        "text":"Saturday, May 23, 2015\n\nNail Butter Review\n\nAs promised, here is my review of a product that has been popping up all around the nail community lately - Nail Butter.\n\nWhat is Nail Butter? In summary, it is a 100% natural cuticle moisturizer (it can be used all over, it is not just limited to hands), made on a farm in Athens, Georgia. Their entire faq page is here.\n\nLet's jump right into it, shall we?\n\nI've been using this as my nighttime cuticle moisturizer for a few weeks. Although the instructions say to use it twice a day for 30 days, and once thereafter, I have found that once in the evenings is plenty for me since my nails and cuticles are already pretty healthy due to my many years of nail art and keeping them up.\n\nTexture: This stuff is really creamy and a tiny bit goes a long way! It soaks in quickly and doesn't leave too much of a greasy feel once it has absorbed. It feels light, but you can tell is has thicker, highly moisturizing oils in it.\n\nScent: Currently Nail Butter is only available in a gardenia scent, but I received a tester of their new lemongrass scent. After almost a month, I still haven't decided if I like the smell or not. Honestly, I think I would have preferred gardenia, and the only floral scent I really enjoy is lilac. The lemongrass is just.... odd? It is hard to describe. At first sniff, you get a nice whiff of lemon, but then there is a funky after-smell that I just don't like. It is a bitter sort of spicy (not the good spicy) tinge that unexpectedly hits you in the face. I haven't quite gotten used to it yet, but I do plan on trying their suggestion of de-scent-itizing it a bit - leave the jar open for a few hours to let the smell dissipate some. Hopefully that'll work!\n\nPackaging: Usually I'm not a stickler when it comes to packing, but I think it is worth mentioning how cute this jar is! It is a thick smoked glass, and it feels very high-quality and durable - it is much heavier than I'm used to for a nail treatment! I do prefer unbreakable things simply because I have a two-year-old and sometimes grabby toddler hands happen, but keeping it where she can't reach it isn't difficult. So I have no issues with the packing - I actually quite like it!\n\nPrice: Nail Butter can be purchased\u00a0here, for $24 USD, shipping included. But there is a lot of product in there. You can't even tell I've used any of it, so it will last me forever!\n\nI don't have any \"before\" shots of my cuticles just because, as I mentioned, they are already pretty healthy, so I didn't see a physical difference in my nails or skin, but they did feel extra smooth and wonderfully moisturized with Nail Butter!\n\nYea, yea. I did my nails to match the jar, I thought it'd be cute. :)\n\nOverall, I do like Nail Butter and recommend giving it a shot despite the price tag, especially if it is as easy as leaving the jar open to get rid of some of the smell. I do think it would be beneficial if it came in a smaller, maybe trial, size with a cheaper price, because personally, I would rather spend 1\/4 of as much to test it before committing to a full-size. I think it works well and lives up to the claims, I just wish it was a different scent or maybe came in a variety of scents! So really I have mixed feelings about it. A smaller quantity and a different scent (mostly the scent, the amount of product really isn't that important), and I would be giving it 10 stars!\n\n*Press Sample*\nProtected by Copyscape Duplicate Content Finder",

        "text":"Drugstore Find: Tree Hut Shea Sugar Scrub Brazilian Nut\n\nI discovered this at Ulta last year while hunting for a new sugar scrub.\u00a0 I love the Bath & Body Works sugar scrubs but at $20+ a piece they are too pricey for me to buy regularly. I was hoping there was a cheaper alternative, and this Tree Hut sugar scrub is similar enough and only $7.50.\n\nOut of the scents they have I like the Brazilian Nut the most. This is a large 18 oz jar. I prefer sugar to salt in body scrubs as the salt hurts after I shave. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m supposed to use this before I shave, but then I take all the oils off my legs shaving. What I like about sugar scrubs is the oil that\u2019s leftover on my skin makes the need to lotion up after a shower not necessary. I like that you can just towel dry and get dressed.\n\nThe grains in this are small, some sugar scrubs can be larger and more abrasive. This one gives a good exfoliation, without the abrasive feel. The scent is slightly sweet, and has a nut oil scent, kind of similar to Ojon hair stuff. This scrub does leave less oils behind after rinsing than Bath & Body Works, so if you like to be really greasy after using a sugar scrub you may have to add some extra oil to the scrub to make it more greasy. \u00a0\n\nThe main ingredients are: sugar, glycerin, Brazil nut seed oil, shea butter fruit, safflower seed oil, evening primrose oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, macadamia seed oil, orange oil and walnut shell powder.\u00a0\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Usually I buy rather expensive liner and don't trust drugstore brands, but I'm impressed by this. The liner draws like a crayon, which doesn't work if you want a thicker line, but is great for precision. I'm not sure how things will work over time, as the tip dulls, but my wing has never looked better!\nSuzanne I.\nMilford, MA\n106 reviews\nBeauty Junkie Expert Level 4\nI absolutely love these Kajal liners. The black one is a staple in my collection and perfect for this time of year. They smudge so beautifully making it super easy to create the perfect dark Smokey eye. Smokey eyes are so popular and essential to many awesome Halloween looks. Another great use for these liners is using them as a base. Put this dark liner down and pip a duochrome, holographic or glitter shadows on top. The dark base will really make your shadow pop and intensify. Maybelline is also super affordable!\nGrace G.\nSanta Rosa, CA\n42 reviews\nBeauty Junkie Expert Level 1\nReview for: Onyx Rush more...\nGreat eyeliner. Long lasting. Doesn\u2019t smear easily, or run. I bought this at Walgreens. The applicator makes it a little difficult to apply, but once you get the hang of it, it works great. I would definitely recommend this product!\nJaunnette L.\nGrand Jct, CO\n277 reviews\nBeauty Junkie Expert Level 2\nReview for: Midnight Brown more...\nOh so bad. I mean it didn't claim to be smudge-proof, just waterproof. But even so it should have lasted more. Two hours of no sweating, no humidity, nothing strenuous. In two hours it transferred above my crease, below my eyes, and my eyelids swelled along the lash line when i washed it off. I thought it might at least work as a waterline color since it's supposedly waterproof but it was totally gone from there in two hours. I returned it to the store.\nTalullah B.\nNew Orleans, LA\n72 reviews\nBeauty Junkie Expert Level 1\nI used this for some of my eye and face makeup for a spooky Halloween look. I use a little body oil to soften it up and help it blend out. The thick tip was great when using on the larger portions of my face.

I struggled to get it to blend nicely for a smokey eye and it it not precise enough for eyeliner. I am unsure how to use this but it was very pigmented. It worked well for a halloween skeleton look! It was difficult to get off.\nLisa P.\nBrooklyn, NY\n15 reviews\nBeauty Junkie Expert Level 1\nReview for: Onyx Rush more...\nThis eyeliner is dark and pigmented. However, it is too thick and it gets all over the place because it is not precise.

I've been collecting a couple of purple lipsticks from different brands for a while now (no dupes of course). But none is as versatile (for wearing) as this colour. You can wear this casually: at work, going to uni, preparing for an interview, while meeting friends, at a bar night out. It's just the perfect brightness and purply tone. It goes fantastic with nude, simple make-up look. It's extremely pigmented with one swipe and MOST IMPORTANTLY it doesn't feather\/bleed over the lip line after application. It's lasts a damn long time\/ isn't drying (like illamasqua lipsticks) too. I'm in the city for over 8 hours and I only re-apply lightly after a meal.

IMO, this is a great starter lipstick for a person who likes edgy yet wearable lips. price *might* be an issue for some, but TBH it's a really good value. it's part of the permanent line-up, so you can get it anytime!\n\n1 out of 1 user found this review helpful.\n\nSkin Tone: Light-Medium - Skin Type: Normal-to-Oily - Undertone: Neutral",

        "text":"Ewa M HM Sekret Wiktorii\u00a065DD\n\nI bought this bra, because 1 I love the way it looks, and 2 because I wanted to try an unlined Ewa bra. I kept going back and forth on what size to get, because there wasn\u2019t a lot of info on unlined bras in my size, as well as a lot of info for this bra in particular. I ended up going with 65DD, because I figured if it was too small it could be a \u201csexy time\u201d bra. However, even though I sized down, it was still too big.\n\nThe straps\n\nThe straps are wide set. Actually, too wide for me. I tried this bra on a few times (for mere seconds\/less than 5 minutes), and everytime it felt uncomfortable. My shoulders aren\u2019t particularly narrow, so that something to keep in mind if you are interested in this bra.\n\nThe cups\n\nWhen I bought this bra, there were only 2 other people that had owned this bra, and they were both nice enough to measure their bras. Both of them listed the depth as being around 8.1 inches (20.57 cm), with a width of 4.9 inches (12.45 cm). Those 2 measurements work out for me, with the depth possibly being too small. Well, with the bra I received, the depth was 9 inches (22.86 cm), which is too deep for me.\n\nThe top of the cup is also open. It\u2019s not like other unlined halfcups that have an elastic piece that goes across the top. There is space between my breast and the top of the cup. I think because the straps are set so far apart, the sides of the cup come up high on me, and irritate my skin.\n\nThe gore\n\nThe gore is too high and too wide for me. The gore is 3 inches (7.62 cm) high, and about .75 inches (1.91 cm) wide. \u00a0If this were a Comexim it would be okay, because the wires are soft, but this isn\u2019t Comexim, it\u2019s Ewa, so the Cleo like wires are painful for me.\n\nThe band\n\n\nThe band is TTS, and firm. Sizing up wasn\u2019t necessary (thankfully since that wasn\u2019t something that crossed my mind). The band does stretch to 30 inches (76.2 cm). The band has 4 rows of \u2018eyes\u2019 (I do find it interesting that some of my Ewa bras have\u00a03 and some have 4)\n\n\nI like the way this bra looks (just not on me), and while I would like to reorder it in a smaller cup size, with my luck the band would run small. I also don\u2019t think I have the breasts for unlined halfcups. I haven\u2019t come across one unlined halfcup that I love yet. They all seem to emphasize my natural shape instead of providing some sort of uplift.\n\n\n\nOne thought on \u201cEwa M HM Sekret Wiktorii\u00a065DD\n\n  1. Before reading your review, I ordered the HM Sekret Wiktorii in my usual EM size, 65F. Now I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll be too deep for me. Your 65DD\u2019s 9\u2033 depth is what most of my fitting bras\u2019 depth measure as. \ud83d\ude26\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

Start Here!\n\nPosted by on in Beauty Subscription Boxes, New Subscription Boxes, PinkSeoul Reviews, Subscription Boxes for Women | Tags: | 14 comments\n\nPinkSeoul Mask Subscription Box Review + Coupon \u2013 April 2016\n\nThis post may contain referral\/affiliate links.

The\u00a0PinkSeoul\u00a0Box is $39.95 every two months with retail value over $60. The\u00a0PinkSeoul\u00a0Plus Box is recommended for subscribers age 35+, $49.95 every two months with retail value over $80. These two boxes are shipped bi-monthly and each box contains at least 4 full-sized items plus an accessory item. The\u00a0PinkSeoul\u00a0Mask\u00a0Box is $29.95 every month with 10 customized\u00a0mask\u00a0products and an accessory item.\n\nThis review is of the\u00a0PinkSeoul\u00a0Mask\u00a0Box for Oily skin types.\n\n\nThe Subscription Box:\u00a0PinkSeoul\u00a0Mask\u00a0Box\n\nThe Cost: $29.95 per month + free US shipping\n\nCOUPON:\u00a0Save 10% off your first box with code MSA10.\n\nAnd for a limited time only, receive a bonus washing hairband with your first Mask Box!

Be sure to figure out what your skin type is because, for example, some ingredients are more compatible with dry skin than with oily skin.\n\n\n\nEach box includes a detailed info card. PinkSeoul stated that they will now be alternating between an accessory item and a full-size cosmetic\/skincare item each month. I think alternating is a wonderful idea. Plus, who doesn\u2019t love full size products?\u00a0The info card also has some FAQs and useful tips on sheet masks (i.e. don\u2019t reuse sheet masks!)\u2013 be sure to read through them, they\u2019re great.\n\n\nElizavecca Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask \u2013 $14 (on sale for $11.95)\n\nI\u2019ve seen this product around before\u2013 it\u2019s a bubbling wash-off mask. PinkSeoul describes this as a \u201cdeep cleanser and pore cleansing clay mask in one.\u201d The mask has a thick mousse-like texture in the jar. It smells earthy and a little chemical-y. I\u2019ve documented the process below. Basically you just scoop out a liberal amount of mask and start applying to the face. I suggest applying with the flat tip of the spatula because it gives you more smooth, even coverage than your fingers would. The mask begins its bubbly transformation upon contact with my skin. At minute 1, it\u2019s a tame fizzy foam. By minute 10 I had a full-blown monster foam face. Even then the mask. Kept. Bubbling. Please don\u2019t smear too much under your nostrils like I did unless you like snorting foam.\n\nThe mask is quite difficult to wash off. It took 3-4 minutes to rinse my face. I will try washing it off in the shower next time. There was a strange phenomenon that occurred during the washing process: my sink started bubbling! Bubbles started oozing out of that extra hole that sinks have to prevent water from overflowing. It is really strange but also mesmerizing to watch bubbles push its way out from seemingly nowhere.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend it for the \u201cfun\u201d factor\u2013 you know, take a few selfies, scare your family, record it for posterity\u2013 but the arduous cleaning process prevents me from using this frequently.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some selfies of the wash off mask and the mysterious bubbling from my sink.\n\n\nTonymoly Intense Care Snail Hydrogel Mask \u2013 $8 (on sale for $6.50)\n\nThis is a hydrogel mask, which is made of a gel-like material instead of your usual pressed cotton. Hydrogel masks allow \u201cmore moisture to be locked in and absorbed into your skin\u201d and requires more delicacy when applying since it can tear if you pinch it too hard. It\u2019s also more expensive than your usual $2-3 sheet mask. This Tonymoly one contains snail secretion filtrate which helps improve skin tone, skin cell regeneration, and replenish moisture. There are not one, not two, but three different types of plastics protecting the two-piece hydrogel mask. There was a lot of peeling involved. It has a neutral smell\u2013 not great, but not unpleasant either\u2013 and fades quickly. It doesn\u2019t slide off my face like some other masks tend to do and does not feel sticky after use.\n\nBanobagi Vita Genic Jelly Mask (Relaxing) \u2013 $5.95\n\nThis mask is soaked in \u201cliposome jelly\u201d instead of usual watery essence and contains aloe vera and 8 types of vitamins to calm and soothe sensitive skin. I didn\u2019t enjoy wearing the Banobagi mask from March\u2019s mask box. The texture was too gooey for me (I think my exact words were \u201cmedical lubricant\u201d). Despite that it is a super hydrating mask and I\u2019d recommend it to those who can handle the gooeyness.\n\n\nSecret Key Starting Treatment Mask \u2013 $5 (on sale for $3.95)\n\nThe highlighted ingredient of this mask is galactomyces ferment filtrate and aloe. Galactomyces is a type of yeast.\u00a0If you think yeast skincare is strange, then you should know SK-II\u2019s popular Pitera ingredient is basically yeast as well (and it sells for so much!). The fermented\/filtrated version contains a lot of things to help improve skin tone, hydrate, brighten skin, and increase elasticity. The mask fit is average but the essence feels great. I could barely detect any scent. There was so much essence left over in the packaging that it would be a waste not to use it up! The mask slowly slid down to my upper lip, which would typically bother me but it hydrated and softened my lips so much! An unexpected new use for ill-fitting sheet masks \u2013 lip hydration. This one leaves my face a little sticky afterwards.\n\nSNP Diamond Brightening Ampoule Mask \u2013 $3\n\nDiamonds. Apparently this mask contains sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, and diamonds. I\u2019m trying to think about all the practical uses for diamonds but \u201cskin hydration\u201d really isn\u2019t one of them. Honestly, though, I like these SNP sheet masks because they fit well and feel great on my face. I\u2019m always happy to receive more.\n\nLeaders Amino AC-Free Mask \u2013 $3\n\nLeaders is a great sheet mask brand. This one has 17 kinds of amino acids, AHA, BHA, and snail mucin. The mask is thin and the water\/gel-like essence has a slight fragrance that disappears quickly after opening. The best part\u2013 the fit is perfect on me! It fits every contour of my face and adheres snugly to the skin. My face feels slightly tacky after use but it doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable.\n\n\nThis is how much essence is left in the Secret Key mask pouch. So much!\n\n\nSkinfood Propolis & Bee Venom Mask \u2013 $2\n\nThis mask has propolis and bee venom. Propolis is an anti-bacterial, soothing, and anti-inflammatory ingredient that my acne-prone skin loves. If you have bee allergies please be aware that this contains bee venom.\n\nSkinfood Bird\u2019s Nest Mask \u2013 $2\n\nBird\u2019s nest extract in this mask helps give skin deep hydration. The fit is average. The essence is creamy instead of the watery essences I\u2019m used to. These Skinfood masks stayed moist for quite a long time\u2013 but that is partly due to me layering a lot of extra essence from inside the packaging. My face did feel a little tacky afterwards.\n\n\nEtude House Vitamin Complex Mask \u2013 $2\n\nEtude House has a series of sheet masks with different featured ingredients. I\u2019ve tried a couple before. This one contains vitamin complexes with skin brightening and purifying properties. The fit is decent and the scent is pleasant. The essence feels slightly tacky on my face after use.\n\nEtude House Royal Jelly Mask \u2013 $2\n\nThe royal jelly mask has royal jelly extract, which hydrates and smoothes the skin. I\u2019m in a \u201cbee everything\u201d skincare phase right now so this is great!\n\n\nIt\u2019s Skin Nutrition\/Yellow Mask Pack \u2013 $3\n\nThis mask pack last several uses. The thick paste is pale yellow and has a honey-like consistency. It smells strongly of honey and the scent doesn\u2019t go away quickly. It made me really hungry while wearing the mask. Although I struggled a little to wash off the thick mask, my skin was left feeling smooth and nourished!\n\nThe Face Shop Mascream Sheet samples\n\nThese are sample-sized sheet masks. They\u2019re ridiculously small and would be appropriate for your pet guinea pig. I love how cute these are! PinkSeoul says to use one for each cheek for a hydration boost.\n\n\nThe sample mask even has eye holes!\n\nVerdict: The PinkSeoul Mask Box delivers on awesomeness once again. My favorite Tonymoly Snail Hydrogel Mask\u2013 it\u2019s pricey but the hydrogel masks do make for a whole new masking experience. Total retail value comes to around $45.35, and that\u2019s with PinkSeoul sale prices. I think this is a solid sheet mask subscription for people who want both variety and quality. The potential is even higher now that they\u2019re including a full-size beauty or skincare item every other month. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to what PinkSeoul has to offer in future months!\n\nAlso, PinkSeoul is currently having a promotion: for a limited time, if you sign up for a new PinkSeoul Mask subscription they\u2019ll include a bonus washing hairband in your first box!\n\nWhat do you think of April\u2019s PinkSeoul Mask Box?\n\nWritten by Nancy Su\n\nNancy Su\n\nNancy used to be a Candy Crush addict but then she became addicted to subscription boxes instead. Now she has a particular interest in Korean\/Asian beauty after seeing the wonders it has done to her skin. She\u2019s constantly in search of new lippies, s... (truncated)",

The material and workmanship are at least as good, if not better, than made-to-measure or other bespoke tailoring that normally costs several times as much. I ordered the dark grey version, and the nice thing about this suit's design is that it is a real cross-over from the 1950s to the 1960s...which is perhaps how the original stylist for \"Goldfinger\" intended it.\n\nRating: 5 of 5 Stars!
