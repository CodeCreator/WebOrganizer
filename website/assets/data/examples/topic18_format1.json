McLee, who presided over the United Methodist Church\u2019s New York region and once lived in Dallas, died Saturday, Sept. 6. The LGBT ally was 58 years old.\n\nAccording to the UMC News Service, the Brooklyn native was called to ministry while attending Dallas\u2019 St. Luke \u201cCommunity\u201d Church. There, under the leadership of\u00a0Rev. Zan Wesley Holmes Jr. he\n\n\u00a0immediately immersed himself in the life of the church, including its many social justice ministries, Holmes recalled. Among other activities,\u00a0McLee sang in the choir, volunteered with\u00a0the church\u2019s prison ministry, served in its AIDS ministry\u00a0and registered voters.\n\nTrained as a lawyer, he enrolled in SMU\u2019s Perkins School of Theology where he received his Master\u2019s of Divinity. He didn\u2019t give up on social justice causes, including his outspoken stances on LGBT equality once he joined the church.\n\nThe UMC\u2019s official policy believes being LGBT is \u201cincompatible with Christian teaching,\u201d forbidding clergy from performing LGBT weddings. Pastors violating the policy often go to trial.\n\nMcLee advocated against such trials. After a complaint was filed against the Rev.\u00a0Thomas Ogletree, who is retired, for officiating at his gay son\u2019s wedding, McLee called for \u201cthe cessation of church trials\u201d related to same-sex marriage.\u00a0\u201cChurch trials produce no winners \u2026 trials are not the way forward,\u201d McLee said at the time.\n\nThe full story is here.\n\n\u2014\u00a0 James Russell\n\nRev. Bill McElvaney has died\n\n\nMcElvaney, seated, officiated the marriage of Jack Evans, 84, and George Harris, 80 in March.\n\nThe Rev. Bill McElvaney, an ardent LGBT ally who faced scrutiny for officiating same-sex marriages despite his denomination\u2019s disapproval, has died.\n\nIn March McElvaney, the pastor emeritus at Northaven United Methodist Church, officiated the wedding of longtime congregants\u00a0Jack Evans, 84, and George Harris, 80. The very public ceremony, which was covered by this publication and others, was not held at Northaven but instead the neighboring Midway Hills Christian Church. Later that month, he was suspended from the church.\n\nAt the time of his suspension, he told the Voice that given his age, he\u2019d rather be on the right side of history.\u00a0\u201cI owe the Methodist church a lot, but what I do not owe the Methodist Church is my soul.\u201d\n\nHe recently announced he would no longer undergo treatment for liver cancer after four years.\n\nFollow the blog this week for more information.\n\n\u2014\u00a0 James Russell\n\nThinking 2 steps ahead\n\nTheologians, ministers gather at Brite for \u2018Beyond Apologetics\u2019 discussion on LGBTs\u2019 future role in religious communities, efforts\n\nTammye Nash\u00a0 |\u00a0 Senior Editor\n\nJoretta Marshall and Stephen Sprinkle\nJoretta Marshall and Stephen Sprinkle\n\nFORT WORTH \u2014 Where do we go from here? That\u2019s the question at the heart of a project called \u201cBeyond Apologetics: Sexual Identity, Pastoral Theology and Pastoral Practices,\u201d an ongoing symposium with its next installment set for Thursday, Oct. 7, at Brite Divinity School at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.\n\nThe event will feature six scholars and pastors, representing five different schools, talking about new ways of thinking about ministry with LGBT people after the battle for acceptance is over.\n\n\u201cOriginally, this project was organized to do two things,\u201d explained the Rev. Joretta Marshall, openly lesbian pastor of theology and pastoral care and counseling at Brite and co-director of the project.\n\n\u201cThe first thing was to bring scholar practitioners together for conversation to try and answer the question, \u2018What would we be talking about if we didn\u2019t always have to focus on gaining acceptance of TLGB people\u201d in churches, Marshall said.\n\n\u201cWe want to go beyond defending TLGB people in the churches and start figuring out what those next conversations will be about. For instance, I am hopelessly involved in the United Methodist Church. It is in my blood and in my bones. But there is still a debate within the UMC over whether we [LGBT people] should be welcomed into the church. We want to get past that so that we can work on transforming the world, on bringing justice to the larger community.\u201d\n\nThe second piece of the equation, Marshall said, was equally important: \u201cEducational institutions should make a difference in the places where they live. We wanted to invite the community in to participate in these discussions and to let them know that Brite is a place where we talk about these things.\u201d\n\nFor the Rev. Stephen Sprinkle, the openly gay associate professor of practical theology and director of field education and supervised ministry at Brite, the idea that a theology school in Fort Worth, Texas is host to such a discussion, is an amazing accomplishment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a gathering of LGBTQ scholars of faith in Texas before. Not like this,\u201d said Sprinkle, one of the six speakers participating in the Oct. 7 discussion.\n\n\u201cThis is the first meeting of its kind here, but it won\u2019t be the last. That was the experience that we had in Oklahoma\u201d last February when the first discussion in the project was held at Phillips Graduate Theological Seminary in Tulsa. He explained that the project was first conceived as a partnership between the two sister seminaries \u2014 Phillips and Brite \u2014 and six speakers participated in a public event held at Phillips that followed the same format to be used at Brite.\n\nThe whole idea, Sprinkle said, is to plan for the future and prepare pastors, churches and the public for the day when LGBT people are already part of the church and can truly give their own unique gifts to its efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are thinking two steps on down the road. We\u2019re thinking outside the box, to use the clich\u00e9. The question is, if we are not having to constantly think about creating space enough for the LGBT community to be accepted, then we can think about how to move the LGBTQ community into a richer, more whole position to contribute to the church\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201capologetics\u201d refers to advocacy, Sprinkle explained. In thinking \u201cbeyond apologetics,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhat we are saying, as LGBT scholars, is that congregations and nonprofits already have everything they need in order to include LGBT people. They already have the know-how, the theology. We believe the arguments for inclusion have already been made, and made very well. The question now is, what do we do to take things to the next stage of development?\u201d\n\nIn his part of the discussion, Sprinkle will focus on his work in documenting anti-LGBT hate crimes and in advocating for the passage of hate crimes laws that include protections for LGBT people. He used his own work and its future direction as an example of the focus of the project overall.\n\n\u201cWe argued for years and years for a hate crimes law. We\u2019ve got that now. But the reality is, we are still being killed. So what are we, as an LGBT community, going to do to understand who those dead are to us? How will that shape our identity?\u201d Sprinkle said.\n\n\u201cWe have to move beyond being just a loose association of people with a variety of concerns on a variety of issues to become a real people that remember and honor our dead. That is what a community does,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cAfrican-Americans can list their people who died in lynchings. Jewish folk have never forgotten the 6 million lost in the Holocaust. Japanese-Americans remember those who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But we as an LGBT community seem to have a hard time even acknowledging that members of our community are still being killed. So what I am trying to do is to think down the road about how we can strengthen this community by remembering the thousands who were murdered because they were just like us.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the project \u2014 although one who won\u2019t be at the discussion next month at Brite \u2014 is Darnell Moore with Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. He is, Sprinkle said, \u201cone of the most dynamic and most original thinkers I have ever seen.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s focus, Sprinkle said, is finding a new way to think about coming out.\n\n\u201cPeople are often afraid to come out because it compromises them and they are vulnerable. What Darnell says is that it is time that we begin to invite people in, really invite them in, and have something to invite them in to. What would it really mean to say to the majority culture all around us, \u2018Stop being tourists in our lives. We will share with you what we have, but you have to come to us.\u2019\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re talking! Now we\u2019re really thinking!\u201d Sprinkle continued. \u201cFrom now one, there won\u2019t be just one National Coming Out Day a year. There won\u2019t be one day of silence in the schools. From now on, the LGBTQ community can be seen as a powerhouse of innovation and creative thinking. We approach that already in the arts and entertainment. But we don\u2019t seem to be secure enough or understand ourselves well enough to be confident doing that in other spheres.\u201d\n\nFor Marshall and Sprinkle, the idea that such new ways of thinking are being birthed here in Fort Worth is reason for celebration, and for hope.\n\n\u201cI came here in 1994, and I was open and out [as a gay man] from the time I first showed up,\u201d Sprinkle said. \u201cBut it has been a fight. Then when we decided to invite Joretta [to join the faculty] and she accepted, I knew we were turning a corner.\n\n\u201cThis project represents a new era at Brite. Fort Worth is the reddest of the red in a red state. And here we are, co-hosting this powerhouse event, this first-of-a-kind academic gathering of people of faith, right under the nose of the Southwest Baptist Theological Seminary!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable in a way,\u201d he said. \u201cI still have to pinch myself to believe it\u2019s real. But it is real. And it is a sign that the time is right to take these next steps.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018Beyond Apologetics\u2019\n\nThe Beyond Apologetics Project will hold a public symposium Thursday, Oct. 7, beginning at 7 p.m. in the Robert Carr Chapel at Texas Christian Universit...
