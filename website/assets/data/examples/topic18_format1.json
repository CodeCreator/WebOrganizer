This lecture was given in the year 1380 AH in Tehran, Iran.\n\n  \u2022 In the Presence of the Beloved\n\n    We live in a world in which the fight for the material is omnipresent. We fight to obtain everything material but no matter how much we are never satisfied due to the fact that we always want something that we do not know what it is but that causes us to feel empty and in need. This emptiness can only be filled by seeking Allah swt. The present book is a collection of lectures about dua delivered by Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi. It consists of four parts. The first part concentrates on the importance of supplication in general. The other three parts deal in detail about Dua al-Iftitah, Dua Abu Hamza at-Thumali and Dua Makarim al-Akhlaq.\n\n  \u2022 Ta\u2019qibat al-Salat - Rituals Succeeding the Ritual Prayers\n\n    Ta\u2019qibat al-Salat - Rituals Succeeding the Ritual Prayers Afzal Sumar Following a question from a gentleman about the sequence of the ta\u2019qibat al-salat as practiced and taught by the Messenger of God (saw) and the Imams (as), the author has embarked on the journey of giving the best answer. In order to help answer the question the author has used works of demonstrative law (al-fiqh al-istidlal) which are taught and studied at the inter-mediate level of the Hawza curriculum. *********************************** A couple of months ago, a certain gentleman from Mombasa Jamaat (Kenya) asked an interesting question on an email list-serve to which I belong. He wished to know the sequence of the ta\u2019qibat al-salat as practiced and taught by the Messenger of God (saw) and the Imams (as). Though the question was very specific and clear but to discern the authentic practice and teachings of the Prophet and the Imams from their sunna, would require a researcher to delve into the\n\n  \u2022 Resurrection, Ma'ad\n\n    The present work discusses the subject of \"Resurrection\", which is one of the volumes of the \"Splendid Light of Wisdom\" Collection with the aim to increase the level of knowledge in the young generation\u2019s mind, and will enable them to comprehend and to know more deeply, the clear and erudite thoughts of this learned thinker; so that it may open a new path in front of them.\n\n  \u2022 Community Building, Part 3\n\n    This series of papers studies the importance of community-building and Prophet Muhammad\u2019s efforts to implement it. This part further builds upon the concept of truthfulness in Islamic theology and is moral system; of Allah as the true being, revelation as the truth, the prophets\u2019 mission to serve the truth, and the importance of communities striving to become truthful.This series is based on a nine-session course conducted by the author on Community Building at the Islamic Centre of England in London in 2009.\n\n  \u2022 Book Review - scripture, poetry and the making of a community: Reading the Qur'an as a literary text\n\n  \u2022 Unclear (Mutashabih) Verses According to the Will of Lady Fatima Al-Zahra\n\n    This article examines the personal requests and counsel in the will of Fatima Al-Zahra and offers an analysis of the events that revolved around socio-political issues.\n\n  \u2022 The Social Functions of Imamate\n\n    This paper investigates the existence and impact of Imamate. Imamate is a divine institution, and the Imam is responsible for administering the affairs of society through being linked to the main source of guidance \u2013 Allah.\n\n  \u2022 Intercession and Intermediation\n\n    Shafa\u02bfah and tawassul can be compared to the links, connections and networks that people use in this life to acquire what they seek. These means and intermediaries should be approved, set and introduced by God, and one should not take them as any independent source of impact, for there is no independence whatsoever for anyone other than God, whether in this world or the next.\n\n  \u2022 Quran strategy on its Own Preservation, Part 1\n\n    This paper explores the practical measures taken to ensure the Qur\u2019an\u2019s survival as an unadulterated text, exploring the following areas to display these strategic stylistic methods\n\n\nI attained realization of God, may He be glorified, by the dissolution of resolutions, and by the solution of complexities.\n\n- Imam Ali (a) -\n\nNew to Islam\n\nDiscover Islam by browsing through material selected from our Library that is particularly appropriate for those who are new to Islam.\n\nWho are Shi'a & Sunni?\n\nUnderstand the commonalities & differences between the two major schools of thought in Islam, and find out more about Islam as taught by the Prophet & his family\n\n\nSign up for Al-Islam.org newsletter\n\nSign up to get notified when new books & articles are added to Al-Islam.org\n\nOur Sub Projects",

The camp will be held from June 17th through the 19th and is open to boys and girls ages 9 to 13. Drop off is on the 17th at 3 pm and pick-up on teh 19th at 5 pm.\n\nRecently the question came up if parents could join their children during this time since it is a short camp (only 3 days) and it would make it hard for some parents to travel quite far to drop off their children and then come again to pick them up. The management team has come up with the following solution: If you - parents - would like to stay at the farm during the three day weekend you are most welcome to do so. The children can have their camp unemcumbered and we can certainly use some folks who can do some service.

Huseman, Staff Writer, Dallas Morning News\nPosted April 22, 2011\n\nThe smell of cinnamon wafts through the intersection of Gurley and Graham avenues in East Dallas. It's not the only thing emanating from Kalachandji's Indian restaurant and its adjoining Hare Krishna temple, whose pristine grounds stand in stark contrast to the aging homes around it.\n\nThings are starting to change in the Mount Auburn neighborhood \u2014 mostly at the hands of the Kalachandji's community. \"The whole neighborhood was built by the Ford Company in the '30s for their workers,\" said Danny Thomas, manager of the restaurant. \"They were cheap houses back then that were built without foundations. They sink into the ground.\" Members of the temple have begun moving into the surrounding houses, remodelling them and becoming active in neighborhood groups.\n\nDallas's only Hare Krishna temple was founded in 1971 in a building that once housed Mount Auburn Christian Church. The restaurant opened a few years later, with the goal of sharing a unique brand of vegetarianism with the Dallas community.

It would also criminalise people who are homeless if they are caught sleeping on the street. Such a law would certainly affect Food For Life, which is based in the Soho Street temple, and Food For All, which is based at Matchless Gifts in Kingscross.\n\nProtestors have vowed that they will clog up the courts if Westminster council proceeds with its proposed ban on rough sleeping and soup runs in parts of the borough. Hundreds of protestors turned out recently for a street protest to oppose the ban, which the local authority wants to introduce through a new bylaw. Protestors included volunteers, church representatives, homelessness charities and rough sleepers.\n\nAlastair Murray, deputy director with the homelessness charity Housing Justice, said the new law would \"effectively criminalize compassion.\" (Click here for the full article)\n\nResponse to the GBC Strategic Planning Committee for Temple Development\nby Niscala dasi\nPosted April 16, 2011\n\nIt is encouraging to know that our GBC are interested in finding the best way for making our temples successful, by surveying all the temples and finding out what works. If it is an impersonal survey, for the purpose of gathering statistics, leading to the passing of numerous resolutions for people they have never met, never spoken to, much less having gotten to know, then it will do more for the cause of depersonalization than for temple development and reform, and devotees will feel more than ever, reduced to numbers. When we are driving dangerously we are warned \u201cyou may become just another statistic!\u201d, an idea that makes the skin crawl with horror, yet it is where we are at, if the only importance our leadership can assign us is numerical- how many books we have given out, how much money collected, etc\u2026\n\nYet there is another way to do a survey\u2026 asking the devotees personally, their needs, problems, observations. Or if that is not possible to do in person, then much can be learnt from the various devotee forums, maybe even coming down to their level and taking part in the discussions, to find out what they find lacking in the temples.

We're looking for an articulate, dynamic devotee--someone with fresh ideas, who can work on a team, and who has a love for Srila Prabhupada's BBT and his books. Good English skills a must. An ability to express yourself in writing a serious plus.

We would have to get a professional security company to steward the event - the costs were going into thousands and thousands of pounds.\n\nThis year I phoned the head of police again - just in case, to try my luck. Again he spoke of 6 months of planing and huge fees. But some how Lord Caitanya sitting in his heart gave him a push and he told me to go ahead as there was a loophole in the law - which he explained to me. That was it - lets have Rathayatra with Lord Caitanya and Jaganath down the busiest street in London on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nSrila Prabhupad murti from Radha Krishna Temple in Soho left his Vyasasana and came out on a palanquin.

The book can be accessed and downloaded at the following addresss\n\nClick Here\n\nThis is the first book in the series of Vaisnava acharyas' works that we are planning to print and put up online. The idea is to make a comprehensive repository of Vaisnava acharya\u2019s works which confirm to good standards. Many available works have been done for commercial reasons (Loi bazar editions) and many others are simply not available. To make the matters worse, many of the brilliant works rendered by devotees like Kusakrtha Prabhu have gone out of circulation. In today\u2019s situation, a seeker would end up running from pillar to post if he were to look for an authentic edition of a book which is somewhat complete with original verses, transliteration etc. Of course there are many devotees who are producing excellent books in this field.

Instead he will lift his glory from their lives. He reluctantly took his glory from Israel as illustrated in Ezekiel, and nobody even noticed, for the priests were busy with their secret things. Whatever you give your time and attention to the most is what is influencing your character and is becoming your idol. Too many go to church, going through the motions on Sunday and the rest of the week devote themselves to their own pursuits and pleasures and wonder why they can't feel God's presence. God desires to dwell among his people. But when they don't like to retain the knowledge of God, when they prefer an appearance of godliness with no power it will lead to destruction.\nSermon Comments (1)\n\n\u00a92002-2019 SermonIndex.net\nPromoting Genuine Biblical Revival.\nPrivacy Policy",
