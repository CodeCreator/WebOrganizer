        "text":"Philips product warranty\n\nTo check the warranty\u00a0policy, period and terms for your product, please choose between below categories.\u00a0\n\nWarranty policy for Personal Care, Mother & Child Care, Household products and Health products\nPersonal care\n\nWarranty policy for Personal Care, Mother & Child Care, Household products and Health products\n\nThe Philips Warranty is set internationally and generally by Philips at Two years which may vary dependent on product category & promotional\/marketing activities from consumer\u2019s date of purchase.\n\n\nSeveral product categories may carry a different within-country warranty period brought about by market dynamics and marketing activities. Therefore, when a consumer is purchasing a product with a longer warranty period, they are in effect getting an extended warranty for this extra period of time within the country of purchase only.\n\n\nThe Philips Warranty is applicable to new product sales and to the end-consumer only in possession of a proof of purchase document. It is not a warranty against stock in trade, demonstration stock, refurbished stock, returns, damage clearance or similar stock. Philips does however honour a limited warranty with respect to dealer stock described in the document herewith below.\n\n\nThis Warranty policy only covers products sold and supplied by Philips South Africa Commercial Pty Ltd.\n\nWarranty Periods:\n\n\nTable A: For Domestic use:\n\nProduct category\nPersonal Care (Male Grooming & Beauty)\n2 Year\nDomestic Appliance (Kitchen Appliance & Garment Care)\n2 Year\nFloor Care Appliance\n2 Year\n\nSaeco \/ Philips (Coffee) *\n\n*Saeco sold before Sep 2016 carry one year and Saeco sold after carry 2 years\n\n2 Year\nTable B: For Domestic use:\nProduct category\nPersonal Care (Male Grooming & Beauty)\n1 Year\nDomestic Appliance (Kitchen Appliance & Garment Care)\n1 Year\nFloor Care Appliance\n1 Year\nSaeco \/ Philips (Coffee)\nNot For Commercial\u00a0use\nAll the abovementioned periods are covered by both spare parts and labour and are applicable from the\u00a0end-Consumer\u2019s date of purchase.\nDealer Demo\/Floor Stock\n\nDealer Floor Stock warranty will be accepted where the product has failed within the period as indicated in the above Commercial Use table (Table B).\n\n\nRepairs submitted to ASCs must indicate that they relate to stock units\n\nA copy of the delivery docket or Philips invoice to the retailer for the product must accompany the warranty repair\n\n\nWhere the retailer is unable to provide a copy of the delivery docket or Philips invoice, then the warranty period shall be limited to the date of manufacture (as determined from the serial number) plus the applicable period listed in the Commercial Use table (Table B) above, plus twelve weeks.\n\n\nOutside of this period, if a product fails and has not been sold, it is not classified as a warranty repair and repair cost will be for the retailer\u2019s account. Philips will however honour a Warranty period of 3 months from date of sale for Dealer Floor Stocks sold outside table B.\n\nLack of Proof-of-Purchase\n\n\nIt may arise that products were sold into a commercial environment or for domestic use under certain\u00a0circumstances such as gifts where the proof of purchase is often difficult to ascertain. In such\u00a0circumstances, the age of the product from the date of manufacture (as determined from the serial number) will determine warranty eligibility as follows:\n\n\nTable C: For Domestic Use\n\nProduct category\nPeriod of Warranty from Date of Manufacture\nPersonal Care (Male Grooming & Beauty)\n2 years plus 12 weeks*\nDomestic Appliance (Kitchen Appliance & Garment Care)\n2 years plus 12 weeks*\nFloor Care Appliance\n1 year plus 12 weeks*\n\nSaeco \/ Philips (Coffee)\n\n*Saeco sold before Sep 2016 carry one year and Saeco sold after\u00a0carry 2 years\n\n2 years plus 12 weeks*\nTable D: For Commercial Use\nProduct category\nPeriod of Warranty from Date of Manufacture\nPersonal Care (Male Grooming & Beauty)\n1 year plus 12 weeks*\nDomestic Appliance (Kitchen Appliance & Garment Care)\n1 year plus 12 weeks*\nFloor Care Appliance\n1 year plus 12 weeks*\nSaeco \/ Philips (Coffee)\nNot for Commercial use\n* The extra 12-week pipeline allows for shipping time of the product from factory to purchaser\nWhere there is any doubt as to whether the product is covered by the warranty, please contact Philips\u00a0Customer Care Centre, who will then advise whether or not the product will be covered. Ensure you have the correct product model & serial number details at hand.\nWarranty Repair Eligibility\n\nTo entitle a successful warranty repair, a consumer must return to the retailer or contact a Philips appointed ASC (Authorised Service Centre) only, and produce:\n\n\n  1. An Invoice or sales docket showing positive proof of purchase\n  2. Complete product\n\n\nNote: In some circumstances the customer may not have a proof of purchase for a legitimate reason e.g. the product was a prize or gift. Where this is the case the age of the set from the date of manufacture will determine eligibility under the warranty as per the table C and D. Failure to supply some of the accessories with the product for repairs may result in a delayed Turn-Around-Time and restrict a successful repair\n\n\nIf you are unsure of the nearest Philips ASC, please contact the Philips Customer Care Centre (0800 212170) or visit the ASC locator on the Philips web-site\n\nThe Philips International warranty which applies to products purchased outside South Africa is for a period as referred to in Table A and B from consumer\u2019s date of purchase.\n\n\nWarranty repairs will be accepted for products purchased by the owner whilst he\/she was abroad, providing the claimant attaches a copy of the sales receipt and stamped warranty card when submitting the product for repair.\n\n\n(The reason for both documents being required is due to the high level of grey imports that occur in some overseas countries)\n\n\nThe International Warranty is not transferable and South Africa\u2019s CPA is not applicable to products purchased abroad.\n\n\nFor the repair claim to be accepted by Philips and in addition to the above, all purchase, product and consumer details must be provided as is standard practice for locally marketed products.\n\n\nAfter sales Service (during and after the Warranty period), is available in all countries where the product is officially distributed by Philips. In countries where Philips does not distribute the product, the local Philips Service organisation may also provide service although there may be a delay if the appropriate spare parts and technical support\/manuals are not readily available.\n\n\nThe sales receipt must clearly indicate the retailer\u2019s name and address, the purchase date and description of the product.\n\n\nExceptions to the International Warranty:\n\n\nSome product categories are country specific and may not carry an international warranty as these are market specifically produced.\n\n\nThe local country\u2019s warranty conditions supersede the International Warranty.\n\nProduct Repair & Returns\nPhilips does not operate Philips-owned service repair centres. Therefore, after-sales repair products must not be returned to Philips South Africa Commercial (Pty) Ltd. Repairs should instead be sent to the nearest Philips appointed ASC only. Product returns require a pre-authorisation issued by Philips before any returns are possible.\n\n\n14 (Business) days credit \/ exchange & CPA obligation\n\n\nThe Retailer may either have a faulty product repaired or may exchange the product for the consumer if faulty within 14 (Business) days of purchase.\n\n\nFor a retail credit claim perspective, the following criterion apply:\n\n\nProduct must be faulty, with original packaging, complete and all its accessories, within 14 (Business) days of purchase (proof must be supplied)\n\n\nPhilips reserves the right to verify and test products including at dealer\u2019s premises prior to credit or replacement\n\n\nProduct must be complete with all its components and \/ or accessories to qualify for full credit\n\n\nShavers and Personal Care will not be exchanged and\/or Credited if used due to hygiene reasons but will follow a repair process instead\n\n\nPhilips will arrange the return\/collection of such faulty goods from the retail stores and for this purpose RAV (Return Authorisation Voucher) reference will be supplied.
