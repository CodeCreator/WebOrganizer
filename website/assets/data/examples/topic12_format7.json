        "text":"What is the Purpose of a Risk Assessment?\n\nThe purpose of a risk assessment is to ensure that a workplace is safe to work in and all individuals involved are appropriately protected from hazards. The process of a risk assessment involves firstly identifying hazards within a work place, and then subsequently implementing control measures.\n\nEmployers have the responsibility to ensure that the workplace which is used by their employees, work associates and customers, is safe enough to work in.\u00a0Risk assessments\u00a0have the purpose of ensuring that the workplace is a safe place through a process of checks and balances. A risk assessment brings to light all hazards in the workplace and protects employees from these hazards by implementing control measures.\n\nRisk assessments have the purpose of effectively ensuring four aspects of health and safety requirements are maintained:\n\n1) Risk assessments allow the prevention of occupational risks\n\n2) Risk assessments provide information to employees, work associates and customers which otherwise would not have been circulated around the workplace. This is because risk assessments highlight hazards and inform individuals of how these hazards have been effectively managed, to ensure individuals they are safe within their workplace.\n\n3) Risk assessment training will allow individuals in the workplace to be thoroughly educated and trained in their workplace\u2019s health and safety procedures.\n\n4) Risk assessments will ultimately help an organisation to comply with health and safety requirements. Risk assessments will create a culture of health and safety compliance as it demonstrates the organisation\u2019s commitment to safety and protection. This will subsequently relay a message to employees and customers to comply and maintain this health and safety standard.\n\nIf a risk assessment is not carried out, then the repercussions can be severe. For example, if an employee is injured within your workplace due to them dealing with a hazardous chemical substance when they have not been protected with necessary protective wear, the employer will be held responsible. The employer may be faced with fines of negligence and this can be crippling.\n\nTherefore, to avoid severe repercussions, it is always wise to train your staff in risk assessments and management. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the UK have published the necessary steps involved within a risk assessment.\n\nWhat will happen if a risk assessment is not carried out by an employer?\n\nThe Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, states in its Regulation 3 the necessity of conducting risk assessments. Failure to carry out a risk assessment, which has the purpose of maintaining safety in the workplace, will leave the employer liable for injury. An employer can be accused of being negligent, or for breaching their statutory duties.\n\nThe UK case of Kennedy v Cordia (Services) LLP, exposed an employer being held liable for the injury of one of their employees in December 2010 in Glasgow. Miss Kennedy was a home care provider, visiting individual people\u2019s houses, whilst being employed by Cordia (Services) LLP. However, the risk assessment carried out by Cordia (Services) LLP did not take into account the footpath by one of Kennedy\u2019s house visits, which was icy and resulted in Miss Kennedy slipping and injuring herself. This incident took place following weeks of bad winter conditions, yet the employer carried out a risk assessment which categorised the risk of slips or trips as \u2018tolerable\u2019.\n\nFollowing Kennedy\u2019s incident the case was taken to court and Kennedy\u2019s employer was found guilty of breaching the Management Regulations and the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at Work Regulations 1992. It was ruled that the employer had not considered providing its employees with protective equipment following some similar incidents which had occurred previously.\n\nIt is clear that as an employer you must ensure the purpose of a risk assessment is achieved and upheld in order to protect the workplace.\n\nGet New and Exclusive Insights Direct to Your Inbox!",

Cord blood, just like bone marrow, contains an abundant amount of stem cells which can be used to treat many types of diseases.\n\nCord blood banking is the storage and preservation of cord blood at a facility for future use. There are two types of cord blood facilities: private and public cord blood banks. Private banks are facilities which store and preserve your baby's cord blood for a fee, usually costing between $1500-$2400 initially and between $100-$150 annually for storage. Public banks, on the other hand, are facilities which you can donate your baby's cord blood free of charge.\n\nThe donated cord blood is then available for use by anyone in need of a stem cell transplant. If choosing to store or donate your baby's cord blood, notify the cord blood bank of your choice (private or public) as soon as possible, ideally before the 34th week of your pregnancy.\n\nThe cord blood collection procedure is both safe and painless for you and your baby. The blood is collected immediately after the birth of your baby and before the delivery of the placenta. Once your baby is delivered, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut and the blood is collected from the umbilical vein. The procedure only takes a few minutes. The cord blood must be collected within 15 minutes after your baby is born. The blood can be collected using either a syringe to remove the blood (syringe method) from the vein or by allowing the blood to drain by gravity into a collection bag (bag method).\n\nOnce the blood is collected, a medical courier takes the specimen to your desired facility\u2019s laboratory to process, test and freeze (cryopreserve) the blood. Your baby's cord blood will be analyzed to ensure a large enough sample of stem cells have been obtained and tested for the presence of any infectious disease. Testing will also include HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigens) typing which is used to find a donor and recipient match when the cord blood is needed. When the cord blood is needed, the facility thaws and prepares the cord blood for transplantation.\n\nCord blood was once thought of as medical waste, but with the advances in technology, it can now be used to save lives.

        "text":"Yellow Fever Outbreak in Northern Uganda (01.06.11)\n\n\nThe Ugandan Ministry of Health recently announced that there are several laboratory-confirmed yellow fever cases as part of an ongoing disease outbreak in northern Uganda. \u00a0The outbreak started in early November and to date has only affected the northern districts of Uganda; however, CDC has a long-standing recommendation for all travelers to Uganda to obtain the yellow fever vaccine based on the ongoing nationwide risk of yellow fever disease. Because this is an evolving situation, details of this outbreak are limited.\n\nThis is the first confirmed outbreak of yellow fever in Uganda since the 1970s. In response to the outbreak, the Ugandan Ministry of Health is planning a mass vaccination campaign in the affected districts.\u00a0\n\nYellow fever occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America and is spread to people through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Initial symptoms can include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, backache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nRecommendations for US Travelers\n\nYellow fever is always a potential health risk in Uganda. However, this outbreak of human cases suggests a higher risk of infection for travelers to northern Uganda at this time. It also highlights the necessity of preventive measures, especially vaccination, before travel.\n\nUS citizens residing and traveling in Uganda are advised to avoid travel to northern Uganda unless they have been vaccinated against yellow fever within the past 10 years. If you have been vaccinated recently, do not travel to northern Uganda for at least 10 days after receiving the vaccine since it takes 10 days for the vaccine to be effective.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Get vaccinated:\n    \u2022 CDC recommends that all travelers 9 months of age and older traveling to Uganda receive yellow fever vaccination.\n    \u2022 Uganda requires yellow fever vaccination for travelers 1 year of age and older arriving from countries endemic for yellow fever.\n    \u2022 Talk to your doctor to make sure you do not have any medical conditions that might prevent you from receiving the vaccine. If the doctor advises you not to get the yellow fever vaccine because of medical reasons, you should not travel to Uganda at this time, especially the districts involved in this outbreak.\n  \u2022 For additional information, see CDC yellow fever vaccination recommendations and requirements for Uganda.\n\n  \u2022 Prevent insect bites:\n    \u2022 When outdoors or in a building that is not well screened, use insect repellent on uncovered skin. Always apply sunscreen before insect repellent.\n      \u2022 Look for a repellent that contains one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of lemon eucalyptus\/PMD, or IR3535. Always follow the instructions on the label when you use the repellent.\n      \u2022 In general, repellents protect longer against mosquito bites when they have a higher concentration (%) of the active ingredient. However, concentrations above 50% do not offer a marked increase in protection time. Products with less than 10% of an active ingredient may offer only limited protection, often just 1-2 hours.\n      \u2022 The American Academy of Pediatrics approves the use of repellents with up to 30% DEET on children over 2 months old. Protect babies less than 2 months old by using a carrier draped with mosquito netting with an elastic edge for a tight fit.\n      \u2022 For more information about the use of repellent on infants and children, please see the \u201cInsect and Other Arthropod Protection\u201d section in Traveling Safely with Infants and Children in CDC Health Information for International Travel 2010 and the \u201cChildren\u201d section of CDC\u2019s Frequently Asked Questions about Repellent Use.\n      \u2022 For more information on the use of insect repellents, visit Insect and Arthropod Protection in CDC Health Information for International Travel 2010.\n    \u2022 Wear loose, long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors.\n    \u2022 Spray clothing with repellent containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent for more protection. (Remember: Don't use permethrin on skin.)\n\nVisit the Uganda destination pages on the CDC Travelers\u2019 Health website for information about other steps to take to ensure a safe and healthy trip.",

        "text":"fish disease - Ciliate\n\nfish disease\n\nA.2. Ciliate\n\nParasites are usually moved by using vibrating hairs (cilia). Parasites are usually infects the skin, fins and gills of fish. As for some diseases caused by the ciliate include\n\n1. lchthyophthiriasis\nThe reason is lchthyophthirius multifiliis. The disease is often called white spots disease in accordance with the resulting clinical symptoms. Types of fish that can be infected by this disease is almost all types of freshwater fish. including ornamental fish. The size of many fish are fish infected seeds or if the adult size Mas fish will be infected. Clinical symptoms are easily observed with the white spots on the infected body part. infected fish rubbed his body on the bottom \/ wall of the container cultivation.\n\nFish seen gasping for air, especially when the parasite infects the gills. In such circumstances the death of the fish will usually high, because the fish susceptible to interference due to absorption of oxygen from fish gills infected.\n\nPrevention of this disease among others\n- Use of water quality balk\n- The equipment used should be disinfected prior\n- Keep the water temperature at the level of 28 \u00b0 C.\n\nTreatment of infected fish can be done in a way: soaking fish infected with a mixture of 25 ppm formalin for 24 hours. Move the fish into the water with a temperature of 28 \u00b0 C will help these parasites knocked out.\n\nCauses are: Trichodina sp and Trichodinella sp. Trichodina sp. infects the skin and fins gills, while Trichodinella sp. Infect the gills of fish. But the situation\n\nTrichodina infection was so severe that we can meet infect gills. These parasites infect nearly all types of fish both freshwater fish or saltwater fish, especially in the seed stage. Clinical symptoms of infected fish is a fish is weak, the body color is not bright \/ dull, and often rubbed his body on the wall or bottom of the pool. Water quality is not good, especially low oxygen content, density of fish that are too high to support the emergence of the disease.\n\nTransmission of this disease can be through water or direct contact with infected fish. Disease prevention can be done by way of improvement of water Mutua, and reduce the density of fish. Treatment for the infected fish can be done by soaking the fish in 40 ppm solution of formality for 12-24 hours.\n\n3. Tetrahymena sp.\nThe disease is primarily in ornamental fish and catfish in the early stages of life (seeds), and is a facultative parasites found only in fresh water. There on the skin and fins, but are sometimes found in the gills. Clinical symptoms can be observed is rather dull color of fish, fish movements slow, and if this parasite infects the gills of the fish will be seen gasping for air. Conditions that trigger this parasitic infection is poor water quality and fish density is too high.\n\nPrevention: the improvement of water quality and the environment and reduce the density of fish. Drugs that can be used to treat the infected fish is the same as those used to treat disease Ichthyophthiriasis.\n\n4. Epistylis spp.\nThis parasite is a common parasite found in Southeast Asia. Infected fish, especially freshwater fish such as catfish, carp, gurame, Tawes fish and generally are found in freshwater fish. Clinical symptoms: lean fish, eat, breath visible mengap advance if these parasites infect the gill cover. Can cause mass death in a nursing seedlings when aggravated by environmental conditions, occurs mainly in fish seed. Prevention: improvement of water quality, hygiene and subtracting the container density cultivation.\n\nTreatment for the infected fish among others can use the drugs normally used to eradicate infectious diseases caused by Ichthyophthirius multifiliis.\n\n5. Oodinium sp.\nThis parasite has a typical structure of a bulge that resembles cytoplasam roots, which serves as a pasting. Cytoplasmanya looks like foam that is equipped with a small partikei (granule). Essentially oval or sperical. At this stage the parasite does not have many flagella and do not swim. This parasite infects primarily freshwater fish and other freshwater fish. While contained in sea water fish is Amyloodinium sp.\n\nFish can be deadly within a\nbrief without showing clinical symptoms typical. Parasites can infect the skin, fins, gills, mouth and even eyes. Clinical symptoms include: bleeding in fish skin mat therefore the disease is known as Hama \"velvet disease\". If the parasites infect the gills of the fish will be seen gasping for air.\n\nPrevention: controlling the entry of water include the use of filters, and carry out acts of quarantine for new fish coming for at least 14 days. Eradication of these parasites can be done by placing the infected fish at a temperature of 24-27 \u00b0 C in the dark state. NaCI at a dose of 30,000 ppm by immersion for 5-15 minutes can eliminate these parasites. Acriflavin at 0.2-0.4 ppm concentration for long-term submersion. For sp Amyloodinium eradication can be done by soaking the fish in fresh water.\n\n6. Chilodonella spp.\n\nChilodonella spp. Much has been reported from Malaysia, and Indonesia Pilippina. Infect freshwater fish, especially lelean catfish, gurame and infect 50 species of ornamental fish. This parasite infects the skin, fins and gills of fish and sometimes in large numbers. Factors that support this parasitic infection is low temperatures that helped the less good is the condition of fish. These parasites attached to the host's body with the help of vibrating hairs (cilia) that are on the ventral part of the body.\n\nWhile its movement is supported by a row of hairs on his body shakes. Clinical symptoms: the infected fish showed the irritating symptoms of movement, jumping surface water, does not react to stimuli and the stimulus fish will eventually weak. Fish mucus-covered blue-gray.\n\nWhen it infects the gills have gill hyperplasia, so the fish will be seen gasping for air. Prevention: keeping condition \/ sepaya water quality remains good, minimizing the content of organic materials, and subtracting the density of fish. Treatment can be done by using a drug commonly used to Ichthyophthirius multifiliis.\n\ncetak halaman ini\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

Since many animals have more acute hearing that humans this may be a normal response to an abnormally loud sounds or it may become a phobia. These fear responses may be transient, and decrease as the animal gets used to the noise. However, a significant proportion of individuals will become sensitised, in other words the response will increase with repeated exposure. The particular response of an individual animal to noises will vary between individuals. Cats will usually try and escape or hide, whereas dogs may show a range of responses such as barking, seeking owner attention, pace, pant or vocalise. These responses can be severe and animals can be in distress throughout periods of exposure to noises, and for a prolonged period afterwards.\n\nThere is accumulating evidence that phobias can be treated successfully using behavioural modification techniques, such as desensitisation and counter-conditioning. These programmes can take some time, especially in cases where the response has been present for a long time, or is particularly severe. Therefore, owners are advised to consult their veterinary surgeon several months before fireworks are anticipated.\n\nOther statements\n\n\nReferral (behaviour)\n\nFurther information\n\nHow to keep your pets safe (Defra)\n\n\nPets and Fireworks (RSPCA)\n\nBSAVA members Member Only\n\nIf you are a BSAVA member please log in to access additional content.

        "text":"HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer\n\nPhoto of a woman being vaccinated (PantherMedia \/ Adam Gregor) Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections play a critical role in the development of cervical cancer. There is a vaccine against these sexually transmitted viruses. It targets the most common of the cancer-causing viruses, but does not provide complete protection against cervical cancer.\n\nCervical cancer is nearly always caused by infections with specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infections only occur in humans, affecting skin and mucous membrane cells. They can be spread through direct contact with infected skin or mucous membranes. HPV infections usually go unnoticed, don't cause any symptoms, and clear up on their own. In rare cases, though, they gradually lead to the development of cervical cancer over many years or decades.\n\nThere are currently more than 200 known strains of HPV. Some cause warts on the skin (also called papillomas). About 40 different types of HPV can infect skin and mucous membranes in the genital area. These viruses are transmitted sexually, but they are spread through contact with skin and membranes, and not through body fluids.\n\nBecause they are very common, it is estimated that as many as 90% of all sexually active women and girls are infected.\n\nAs well as having the vaccine, regularly going for screening can help prevent cervical cancer. Abnormal cells (dysplasia) can usually be discovered in this way and removed if necessary.\n\nWhat do HPV vaccines protect against?\n\nHPV vaccines offer protection against the types of HPV that are most likely to cause cervical cancer. Infections with these viruses can cause cells to change and possibly develop into cancer. One of the available vaccines can prevent genital warts (condylomas) too. Although these warts are often unpleasant, they aren't dangerous.\n\nthe\u00a0vaccines can reduce the number of women with abnormal cervical cells that have changed so much that they are likely to develop into cancer (also known as high-grade dysplasia, or CIN 3). This suggests that the vaccines also provide protection against cervical cancer in the long term.\n\nSince August 2017, the only vaccines available in Germany are Cervarix and Gardasil 9. Cervarix provides protection against HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for about 60 to 70% of all cases of cervical cancer. It doesn't offer any protection against genital warts. Gardasil 9 provides protection against a total of 9 HPV types which are responsible for about 75 to 90% of all cases of cervical cancer. It also offers protection against genital warts.\n\nHPV vaccines don't have any effect on pre-existing HPV infections or genital warts.\n\nWho is the vaccine intended for?\n\nIn Germany, HPV vaccines are offered to girls between the ages of 9 and 14. The costs are covered by statutory health insurers. Girls over 14 who haven't had the vaccine should be vaccinated by the age of 17 at the latest. Some statutory health insurers cover the costs for women above this age too. The question of whether boys should also be offered the vaccine is still being considered. In order to prevent young women from becoming infected with HPV, it is recommended that they be vaccinated before they become sexually active, if possible.\n\nWhat does the vaccination involve?\n\nThe vaccine is injected into the muscles of the upper arm. It doesn't contain viruses that are able to reproduce inside the body. Instead, it contains proteins that are like the outer coat of HPV viruses. Although the vaccine can't cause an infection, it still triggers a response from the body's immune system. Protective antibodies are made.\n\nHPV vaccines usually involve\u00a0two injections that are given five months apart. If the second injection is given before the five months are up, a third injection has to be given a few months later. Three injections are also needed if the girl is older than 14 when she has the first injection.\n\nHow well do HPV vaccines work?\n\nResearch has shown that HPV vaccines are very good at preventing HPV infections caused by the viruses that they target. They reduce the likelihood of cervical cells changing and becoming abnormal, and also lower the risk of cervical cancer.\n\nIf the protection lasts a long time, the following could be expected:\n\n  \u2022 Without an HPV vaccine: About 30 out of 1,000 women would develop cervical cancer at some point in their lives \u2013 if they don't go for cervical screening.\n  \u2022 With an HPV vaccine: About 10 out of 1,000 women would develop cervical cancer at some point in their lives \u2013 if they don't go for cervical screening.\n\nIn other words, HPV vaccines could prevent cervical cancer in about 20 out of 1,000 women.\n\nThey would also prevent the need for surgery to remove pre-cancerous abnormal tissue. This is because women with high-grade dysplasia (abnormal cervical tissue with cells that have changed a lot) have such a high risk of cervical cancer that they are advised to have the abnormal tissue removed.\n\nOne of the vaccines, Gardasil 9, also greatly reduces the risk of genital warts.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccine will depend on whether a girl already has an HPV infection when she is vaccinated. It is less effective in girls who have already been sexually active.\n\nHow long does the protective effect last?\n\nIt is currently not clear whether the vaccine offers long-term protection or whether it will have to be given again (booster shot) at some point. The studies in this area have lasted six years at the most. The vaccine continued to offer protection during that time. This suggests that the vaccine is effective in the long term too. But because cervical cancer usually develops over several years or several decades, more time is needed to be sure.\n\nWhat are the side effects of the vaccine?\n\nHPV vaccines weren't found to cause any serious side effects in the studies. They may lead to various temporary skin reactions where the shot was given, including pain (in 90 out of 100 vaccinations), skin redness (in 30 out of 100 vaccinations), and swelling (in 40 out of 100 vaccinations). Problems such as indigestion, headaches, tiredness or muscle pain may also occur, but are less common.\n\nSome girls may faint after having an injection. Because of this, it is important to stay at the doctor's for about 15 minutes afterwards.\n\nThe vaccination shouldn't be given to girls who have a fever. If the first vaccination causes an allergic reaction, a second dose shouldn't be given.\n\nAuthorities worldwide have been monitoring reports of possible side effects of HPV vaccines since their use was approved. Due to the sheer number of girls who are vaccinated, the coincidental occurrence of new illnesses in some girls following HPV vaccination is to be expected. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), there is no indication that the illnesses that developed after receiving the HPV vaccine were actually caused by the vaccine.",

Some individuals seem to be very sensitive to cold which results in poor blood circulation in the extremities. This is not a serious condition and resolves rapidly with aid of symptomatic measures.\n\nChilblains: Incidence, age and sex\n\nChilblains can affect an individual of any age group. However it is more frequently seen in older adults. The incidence of chilblains is seen mainly in cold and humid weather conditions.\n\nSigns and symptoms of chilblains: Diagnosis\n\nThe clinical features of chilblains generally occurs a few hours after exposure to cold temperatures and affect chiefly the skin of fingers, toes, face and earlobes. The inflammation of blood vessels of the skin may present with redness and swelling of the affected areas. Individuals may also complain of intense itching over skin lesion. Occasionally, an individual may only present with redness of the nose. The inflammation of the blood vessels may cause progressive swelling of the vessel lining wall which in turn results in reduced circulation of blood. This may bring about numbness and bluish discolouration of the affected skin signifying impaired blood flow.\n\nCauses and prevention of chilblains\n\nChilblains occur due to increased sensitivity of some individuals towards cold which results in sluggish circulation of blood, especially affecting the extremities. Various factors like anaemia, nutritional deficiencies or hormonal imbalance may result in this condition. Positive family history has also been known to play a role in causation of chilblains. Chilblains are seen mainly in places where weather is cold and humid. Physical exercise and wearing appropriately warm clothing in cold temperatures may help in preventing this condition.\n\nChilblains: Complications\n\nGenerally this condition is mild and do not result in any severe health concerns. However, the skin lesions may get secondarily infected by bacteria in extremely rare instances. Some individuals have also experienced ulceration of skin lesions, typically called \u2018acral ulcers\u2019. But in maximum individuals, chilblains resolve within a few hours without any residual health problem.\n\nChilblains: Treatment\n\nChilblain is a mild condition which can be easily prevented or can even be managed effectively later. It is important to provide warmth to the affected area if it has become red and swollen. Rub the area vigorously to increase blood circulation. Application of calamine lotions may also help in soothing the itchy skin. Alternatively steroid creams may be prescribed to reduce itching and soreness of skin.
