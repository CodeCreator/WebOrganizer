        "text":"Home \u00bb Student Services \u00bb For Current Students \u00bb College Policies \u00bb Academic Policies & Procedures \u00bb General Policies\n\nGeneral Policies\n\nAbsences for Pregnancy or Childbirth\n\nIn accordance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, absences due to pregnancy or related conditions, including recovery from childbirth, shall be excused for as long as the student\u2019s doctor deems the absences to be medically necessary. When the student returns to the College she shall be reinstated to the status she held when the leave began, which includes the opportunity to make up any missed work. The College may offer the student alternatives to making up missed work, such as retaking a semester, taking part in on-line instruction, or allowing the student additional time in a program to continue at the same pace and finish at a later date.\n\nFor more information, please contact the either the Registrar at registrar@necc.mass.edu, or the Dean of Academic Advising, Articulation, Transfer, Testing and TRiO at advising@necc.mass.edu.\n\nAbsence for Religious Reasons\n\nStudents who, due to religious beliefs, are unable to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirements on a particular day, shall be excused from any such examination or study or requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study, or work requirement which they may have missed because of such absence on any particular day, provided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon the school. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to said students such opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to students for availing themselves of the provisions for an absence for religious reasons in accordance with Chapter 375, General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nAcademic Ethics and Plagiarism\n\nPlagiarism is a very serious violation of academic ethics and the NECC Student Code of Conduct. The college expects all students to maintain high standards of academic honesty and integrity.\n\nPlagiarism is defined by the College to be the use of any other person\u2019s research, images, words or ideas as though they were your own, without giving appropriate credit to the original source. If a student uses another person\u2019s research, images, words or ideas he\/she must give credit to the original source through proper citation (consult the instructor about this requirement), regardless of whether the use is a direct quote, or it is incorporated into his\/her own work.\n\nInstructors are required to provide students with a clearly written definition of plagiarism applicable in their discipline as part of the course syllabus that they provide during the first two weeks of each course.\n\nPlagiarism may range in severity from unintentional omission of credit, to intentional, dishonest representation of borrowed work as one\u2019s own. In most cases, plagiarism will be dealt with by the faculty member in charge of the course, and students will be sanctioned according to the severity of the offense.\n\nStudents\u2019 academic offenses, as outlined in the Regulations Governing Student Conduct (see Student Code of Conduct at www.necc.mass.edu\/collegepolicies), are usually handled by faculty members and\/or their supervisors, with the procedural protections mentioned in the Regulations Governing Student Conduct.\n\nStudents are responsible for understanding what plagiarism is in each of their classes. The college\u2019s definition and that of their instructor will be used as a criterion against which all plagiarism allegations will be judged. Instances of plagiarism will be addressed first by the instructor who discovers, or is made aware of, the incident. Instructors must discuss the evidence of plagiarism with the student prior to taking action. Instructors who take action as a result of a plagiarism incident may report such action to the vice president of academic affairs. There shall be a range of penalties at the discretion of the instructor which may extend to a recommendation to the vice president of academic affairs for expulsion from the College. The vice president of academic affairs may take disciplinary action against students who are reported for plagiarism.\n\nStudents have a right to file a grievance if they feel that the action taken in the alleged plagiarism case discriminated or abrogated their individual or student rights. Students may contact the vice president of enrollment management and student services office for detailed information regarding the Board of Higher Education\u2019s Student Grievance Procedures.\n\nAssessment of Program and Institutional-Level Learning Outcomes\n\nNECC\u2019s commitment to student success involves the evaluation of student work at the program, department, and\/or campus levels to help ensure that students are achieving the learning outcomes identified by our programs and the college. This process may include the collection of such evidence as student classroom products or classroom-associated reports of student knowledge or skill demonstrations. All collected products will have any identifying information removed before they are reviewed. Results from these reviews are then aggregated to provide an overall view of students\u2019 outcomes achievements. Assessments carried out at the program, department, and\/or campus levels will not impact students\u2019 course grades. The process of assigning grades will continue to be the responsibility of the course instructors. Any student who does not wish to have their products collected for program, department, or campus-level assessment can opt out by notifying their instructor.\n\nAttendance and Participation\n(NP Policy)\n\nFor classroom, laboratory, videoconference, and clinical courses, students are expected to attend each meeting of each class in which they are enrolled. For online courses, students are expected to participate at a level acceptable to the instructor.\n\nDocumenting Attendance in Distance Education Courses\n\nChanges to federal financial aid regulations in recent years have highlighted the importance of accurate reporting on student attendance and participation in all courses, including online courses. To stay in compliance with federal financial aid regulations, the college is providing the following procedural guidance for faculty filling out non-participation rosters for distance education courses.\n\nTo quote from the Federal Student Aid Handbook:\n\n\u201cIn a distance education context, documenting that a student has logged into an online class is not sufficient, by itself, to demonstrate academic attendance by the student. A school must demonstrate that a student participated in class or was otherwise engaged in an academically related activity, such as by contributing to an online discussion or initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a course-related question.\u201d FSA Handbook, Volume 5, Chapter 2, 5-60.\n\nFor practical purposes, this means that a student needs to be more than merely logging in to an online course (without showing any other kind of active participation) to be considered in academic attendance. Given the wide range of approaches used to teach online courses, monitor student activity, and assess student performance, individual faculty members are best positioned to determine whether their students are in attendance in a distance education course. However, to stay in compliance with federal financial aid regulations, that determination must consist of something more than a student just logging in and out of a course.\n\nIn every case, the class instructor has full and final authority to decide whether a student is permitted to make up work missed through absence or lack of participation, and on what terms. Attendance and participation policies are noted on each course syllabus.\n\nFaculty have the academic authority to remove students from their class for nonattendance or non-participation. A non-participating (NP) student is one who has excessive absences, has missed quizzes, tests or papers, or otherwise has failed to meet the participation standard clearly delineated in the course instructor\u2019s syllabus.\n\nAn NW grade is assigned when non-participating students are removed from a class. Although the NW grade is not included in students\u2019 grade point average, it may have other adverse consequences.\n\nA student may be removed from a course for inappropriate classroom behavior that is in clear violation of the student code of conduct published in the Student Code of Conduct and NECC Policies & Procedures (see www.necc.mass.edu\/collegepolicies). Faculty must follow notification procedures as prescribed in the code and should not use the NP Policy for this purpose.\n\nHome Schooling Policy\n\nAll home school students, without a high school diploma or GED, are eligible to apply for admission to a degree or certificate program provided they have successfully completed an approved home school program in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws or the laws of their home state.\n\nTo determine whether a student has participated in an approved home school program, the student shall submit, with the application for admission, evidence that the home school program was approved by the student\u2019s school district\u2019s superintendent or school committee. Additionally, if the home schooled student is under the age of compulsory attendance, which is sixteen (16) years old in Massachusetts, a letter from the student\u2019s school district\u2019s superintendent or school committee is required stating that the student is not considered truant and would not be required to attend further schooling or continue to be home-schooled if the student has completed his\/her home school program before the age of sixteen (16).\n\nThe College reserves the right to limit or deny enrollment of any student under the age of sixteen (16) in a course of program based on a case-by-case consideration of a variety of f...

        "text":"School Behavior Expectations\n\nClick here to download a PDF version of this School Behavior Expectations bcl_1518398722.htm\n\n\n\nThe team at David W. Long Elementary is dedicated to working with families to foster a school climate that promotes collaboration in the development of a positive climate for our students. By structuring such a climate, our students will develop the necessary academic and social skills to contribute to our classrooms and society. The staff at David W. Long is committed to providing each child a superior education by engaging instruction and challenging learning experiences in a safe environment which encourages students to think logically, to learn cooperatively and independently, to respect and value diversity, and to develop a lifelong desire for learning that continues beyond the classroom walls. In order to ensure that all students are able to develop the skills necessary to be successful, the staff in collaboration with parents and students has developed school-wide expectations as a guide of how we expect our Rangers to behave while they are at school. To ensure the development of a positive, safe learning environment for all students, those who do not meet the behavioral expectations outlined in our plan may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\nStudents are required to meet four main expectations at all times. All other expectations are developed based on the four school-wide expectations listed below:\n\n1.Be Respectful\n\n2.Be Responsible\n\n3.Be Cooperative\n\n4.Be Safe\n\nSafety Expectations:\n\n1.For their own safety, students may only be on campus when adult supervision is provided. For this reason, students may not be on campus before 7:55 a.m. If you need to drop your child off prior to 7:55, please contact our Child Care Coordinator. There should be no running or playing in front of the school while they are waiting.\n\n2.Students who ride their bikes to school must provide their own lock to lock up their bike during school hours. The school and Etiwanda School District will not assume any responsibility for any theft or damage to anything left in that area. Bikes must be walked at all times on all parts of the campus including the sidewalk of the front traffic loop. Students are required by law to wear helmets while riding their bicycles. Students must adhere to all Bicycle Safety Rules and Vehicle Code Rules or they may lose the privilege of riding a bike to school. Skateboards, roller skates, roller blades and scooters may not be used on campus.\n\n3.Behavior that may cause harm or injury to other students will not be tolerated and will be dealt with in a serious manner, which may include suspension from school. Such behavior includes fighting, rock throwing, pushing\/shoving, hitting, kicking, and other similar harmful behaviors.\n\n4.Playground games such as football, \u201cplay fighting\u201d, tag, etc., which could cause the risk of injury are not allowed at any time. Unsafe use of the playground equipment is not allowed. Students shall follow school determined rules for all games. Students will care and use all equipment properly.\n\n5.Students must remain in assigned areas where proper supervision is provided. When students arrive they will enter campus through the cafeteria. Only students will be allowed to enter campus through the cafeteria. At 7:55, students will be allowed to proceed onto campus and should hang up their backpacks and proceed directly to the playground. At recess, students may not be in the hallways, behind the classrooms, or out in the corners of the field. Failure to remain in the designated areas will result in consequences.\n\n6.Running or playing in the hallways, restrooms, or hard courts is unsafe and not allowed.\n\n7.When the bell rings, students will:\n\na.Freeze- get off equipment, hold playground balls, and kneel quietly.\n\nb.Wait for a teacher\/proctor to blow the whistle.\n\nc.Walk to their assigned line returning all equipment to the ball carts on the way.\n\nd.Sit quietly in their line, keeping their hands to themselves, and wait for their teacher to arrive.\n\n8.During dismissal, students who are being picked up will wait calmly on the sidewalk of the traffic loop. Students who are walking home will use all crosswalks and begin walking home immediately. Playing or running in the grass area in front of the school during high traffic times is not safe and is not allowed.\n\nRespectful and Responsible Behavior\n\n1.People, including other students, are to be treated with respect. Rudeness or defiance of authority of any adult on staff will not be tolerated.\n\n2.Students are expected to take pride in their school by being responsible for cleaning up after themselves and putting all trash in the proper containers while in their classrooms, the cafeteria, the playground, and the restrooms.\n\n3.Gum chewing is not allowed. Students may eat healthy snacks at recess only under the shade structure. Glass containers, soda, and candy are not allowed on the playground. Students are not allowed to share food with their peers due to the high risk of allergies that other students may have.\n\n4.Profanity and obscene gestures are never allowed and may result in serious consequences.\n\n5.Articles of value such as cell phones, video games, playing cards, fidget spinners, and other toys should not be brought to school as they are a distraction to the learning environment. The school will not be responsible for items that go missing. If a student finds an item of value, it should be turned into the Lost and Found cart in the MPR.\n\n6.Restrooms are to be used for their intended purpose only; playing in the restrooms is not permitted.\n\n7.Name calling, teasing, or being rude to fellow students will not be tolerated.\n\n8.Students may not bring playground equipment from home. The school supplies playground equipment to be used during recess and PE.\n\n9.Students are to respect school property and the property of others. Misuse or vandalism may result in the natural consequence of repairing or replacing the damage.\n\n10.Students are expected to support the proper environment for learning by following classroom expectations and procedures as set forth by the teacher.\n\nCafeteria Expectations\n\nDuring lunch or while the students are in the MPR, students will:\n\n1.Be respectful and cooperative while waiting in the lunch line. Behaving inappropriately may result in being moved to the back of the line.\n\n2.Sit in the assigned location as directed by staff and remain seated until a proctor has dismissed the table and the table is clean.\n\n3.Use good manners and use inside voices.\n\n4.Eat their own lunch and do not play with or throw food.\n\n5.Clean up any messes or spills that they have caused. Help those around them clean up.\n\n6.Throw away any left over lunch trash in the trash cans after they have been dismissed by the proctor.\n\n7.Walk in the MPR.\n\n8.Follow dismissal procedures as directed by the proctors.\n\nPlayground Rules\n\nWhile at snack recess and lunch recess, students will:\n\n1.Be aware of their space and keep their hands and feet to themselves.\n\n2.Be kind to others by using kind words and being a friend to others.\n\n3.Listen to the proctors and follow directions the first time they are given.\n\n4.Play games in the appropriate area abiding by the school developed rules while taking turns and including others that want to play.\n\n5.Have good sportsmanship while playing.\n\n6.Stay within the designated playground boundaries (stay away from the classrooms on the hard courts and away from the fences on the field).\n\n7.Eat snacks in the designated area under the shade structure and throw away trash in the trash cans.\n\n8.Freeze when the bells rings and kneel until the whistle blows. Walk safely to return equipment to the ball carts and line up.\n\n9.Sit and wait for their teacher keeping hands and feet to themselves.\n\n*Playground balls will be provided by the school, students may not bring balls or other toys from home to play with.\n\nPositive Behavior Recognition\n\nAt DW Long, we establish positive supports to promote a learning environment that allows all students to learn in an atmosphere that values education. Students who demonstrate respectful, responsible, cooperative, and safe citizenship by meeting our classroom and school-wide expectations will be recognized in a variety of ways:\n\nCitizenship grades on report cards\n\nRanger of the Month Awards\n\nRockin\u2019 Ranger bucks\n\nGotcha Tickets (positive phone calls home)\n\nOther forms of recognition both in the classroom and around campus.\n\nDisciplinary Consequences-Suspensions\/Expulsions\n\nThe main objective of our Student Behavior Expectations policy is to teach students to manage their own behavior and learn to interact in a way that promotes a positive school climate. When a problem arises we begin a process of reviewing expectations, administering a consequence, and alerting parents if the problem continues. We are committed to an intervention-based approach, attempting other means of correction prior to suspension from school.\n\nIf a student engages in negative behaviors that violate our four main expectations, they will be dealt with in a variety of ways depending on the severity of the misbehavior, its impact on others, and the number of times the misbehavior has occurred. These consequences may include: removal from the game\/activity, time out, loss of recess privilege, detention, and if warranted, suspension. In severe cases, the student may be recommended for expulsion. Students may be issued an office referral or fill out a \u201cThink Sheet\u201d and parents will be notified if deemed necessary by the teacher and\/or the administrator. Acts considered major defiance will not be tolerated and may result in immediate suspension of the student from school. Listed on the following are suspendable offenses per the California Education Code.\n\nThe following are serious offenses according to state law and Education Code Sections 48900:\n\n(a)(1)Caused\/Attempted\/threatened physical injury or\n\n(2)Will...

        "text":"Outreach privacy notice\n\nThe University of Birmingham works with schools and colleges to deliver outreach activities to learners who are under-represented in higher education and have the potential to progress. This work is known as widening participation.\n\nWe aim to help young people to:\n\n  \u2022 do their best at school or college by providing outreach activities to support improvements in attainment, study skills, motivation and confidence\n  \u2022 learn more about higher education, apprenticeships and other career pathways to decide on the right path for them\n\nWe do this by delivering a range of outreach activities such as University taster days, summer schools, masterclasses, study support and mentoring.\n\nThis privacy notice provides information about how the University uses the personal data we collect and process about you. It supplements our webpage\u00a0Data Protection \u2013 How the University Uses Your Data.\n\nIt is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep your personal information updated during your relationship with us.\n\nWhat personal data will be processed?\n\nWhen you apply for outreach activities\n\nWe will process the personal data you or your school provides to us when either you or your school\/college make an application for your participation within an outreach activity\/programme. This data will include some or all of the following:\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 your name, home address and other contact details you may provide\n  \u2022 your email, your user name, your computer\u2019s IP address, MAC address and device name\n  \u2022 your date of birth and year group\n  \u2022 your gender\n  \u2022 your learner ID number (UPN\/ULN)\n  \u2022 the name of your school\/college and in some cases, your previous school\/college (e.g. if you took your GCSEs there)\n  \u2022 your qualifications\/grades\n  \u2022 whether you are entitled to free school meals\n  \u2022 whether you are in care or are a care leaver\n  \u2022 whether you are a young carer\n  \u2022 information about your home life such as whether your parents\/carers have been to university and your household income). We will assume that you have obtained consent from those individuals before you supply their contact details to us.\n\nIf your school or college provides this information to us, we will assume that they have your consent to do so.\n\nIn addition to this, we may need to process some data about you that is classed as \u2018special category\u2019 or sensitive personal data. This includes data about your ethnicity and health\/disability data. Ethnicity data is important, as it enables us to carry out our statutory obligations\/conditions of funding as we need to ensure our outreach activities are targeted at learners who are under-represented in higher education. We may also request data about your health or any disability you have which will be used to provide help or reasonable adjustments at events. Access to, and the sharing of, your special category personal data are controlled very carefully. Special category data is also used for research and statistical purposes, but not in a way which will involve making any decisions about you personally or putting measures in place which relate to you personally.\n\nEngagement data and tracking outcomes\n\nIf you are accepted on to an outreach activity, we will monitor your engagement within the activities for the duration of the activity and evaluate the impact these activities have had in terms of your attainment, aspirations and where you go after school\/college.\n\n  \u2022 we will collect the outreach engagement data using registers within events\n  \u2022 from time to time you may be asked to complete evaluation forms, so that you can provide feedback on outreach activities\n\nObtaining information about you from third parties\n\nAt key points in your educational career we may ask your school\/college to provide us with information about you, such as your exam results and what qualifications you are studying and where, and education data from your Individual Learner Record (ILR) which is held by your college.

That is, it contains your dates of attendance, a list of all the courses you took, all the academic credit you received for these courses, and the grades you earned in the process. Also, it contains information on whether or not you were ever dismissed, for academic or other reasons. If you were granted credit towards your degree from another institution or any other source, your transcript contains this information as well (although not the list of specific courses or grades, just the total number of credits accepted.)\n\nPolicy Procedures\n\nWhen a course is entered onto your transcript, it is there to stay. Courses that you drop during the first four weeks of the semester don't show on your transcript. But if you withdraw later in the semester, the course will show permanently on your transcript. Similarly, if you repeat a course, your previous attempt, together with the grade earned, stays on the transcript. The previous grade no longer counts in your cumulative GPA, but the record of your having taken the course remains.\n\nTranscripts are either official or unofficial. If you need an unofficial copy for your own information, is available online. When signed on to Web Banner, go to Student Services, then Student Records and then Academic Transcript. You can print it for your own use.\n\nIf a graduate school, an employer, or another college needs to see your transcript, however, they want an official one. Official transcript requests are not accepted by mail, fax or email. Requests for official transcripts must be ordered online. The Office of Registration and Records has contracted Credentials Inc. to manage all official transcript request orders. Your official transcript is maintained by the State University of New York College at Brockport and is bound by the federal law FERPA (Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974.)\n\nYou must provide your Brockport Banner ID number or your SS#, a valid email address and a valid credit card number in order to use this service to place an order. You will receive confirmations of your order, its status and any issues that may need your attention. If problems arise, Credentials Inc. must be able to communicate with you. If communication isn't possible, your order will be automatically cancelled after 30 days.\n\nIf there is a hold on your record, it must be cleared with the department\/office that placed the hold there before the transcript can be released. You will receive an email from Credentials Inc. regarding any holds and will be given the telephone number of the department\/office to contact regarding\u00a0clearance. Once cleared, Credentials Inc. will automatically notify Registration and Records to release the transcript.\n\nUnofficial Transcripts\n\nUnofficial transcripts can be accessed through Web Banner for students who were in attendance at The College at Brockport in 1983 and later. When signed on to Web Banner, go to Student Services, then Student Records and then Academic Transcript.\n\nStudents who attended Brockport prior to 1983 must send a signed request to the Office of Registration and Records for an unofficial transcript. Please note that an unofficial transcript will only be sent to the student's home address. Unofficial transcripts are free of charge.\n\nLinks to Related Procedures and Information\n\nTo complete a transcript order form,\u00a0click Transcript Request Information from the options to the left and follow the prompts to order the transcript.

This statement is based on the Best Practices Guidance for COPE Journal Editors.\n\nEthical Guidelines for Journal Publications\n\nPublication of articles in the journal Jurnal Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia examined by peers is an important building block in the development of a coherent and respected network of knowledge. This is a direct reflection of the work quality of the authors and the institutions that support them. The reviewed articles support and embody scientific methods. It is therefore important to agree on the expected ethical standards of conduct for all parties involved in publishing actions: authors, journal editors, peer reviewers, publishers and the public.\n\nUNITRI\u00a0PRESS as a publisher of Jurnal\u00a0Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia carries out its trust duties for all stages of publication very seriously and we recognize ethical and other responsibilities. We are committed to ensuring that advertising, reprints, or other commercial revenue have no impact or effect on editorial decisions. In addition, UNITRI\u00a0PRESS\u00a0 of the University Tribhuwana Tunggadewi and the Editorial Board will assist in communication with other journals and \/ or publishers where this is useful and necessary.\n\nPublication Decision\n\nEditor Jurnal Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia is responsible for deciding which articles are submitted to the journal to be published. The validation of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers should always encourage such decisions. Editors can be guided by the policy of the editorial board of the journal and are limited by the legal requirements as currently applicable with respect to defamation, copyright infringement and plagiarism. Editors can negotiate with editors or other reviewers in making this decision.\n\nThe game is fair\n\nThe editor at any time evaluates the manuscripts for their intellectual content irrespective of race, sex, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, nationality, or political philosophy of the author.\n\n\nThe editor and any editorial staff should not disclose any information about the manuscript submitted to anyone other than the relevant author, observer, potential observer, other editorial advisor, and publisher, as appropriate.\n\nDisclosure and conflict of interest\n\nUnpublished material disclosed in submitted manuscripts may not be used in the research editors themselves without the written consent of the author.\n\nViewer's Tasks\n\nContributions to Editorial Decisions\n\nPeer reviews help editors in making editorial decisions and through editorial communication with authors can also assist authors in improving papers.\n\n\nAny elected referee who feels ineligible to review research reported in the script or knows that a quick review may not have to notify the editor and excuse himself from the review process.\n\n\nManuscripts received for review should be treated as confidential documents. They may not be indicated or discussed with others except as authorized by the editors.\n\nStandards of Objectivity\n\nThe review should be done objectively. The personal criticism of the author is not correct. Referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.\n\nSource Recognition\n\nReviewers shall identify relevant published works that have not been quoted by the author. Any statement that observation, derivation, or argument has been previously reported should be accompanied by relevant citations. The reviewer should also seek the editor's attention if there are substantial or overlapping similarities between the text under consideration and other published papers that have personal knowledge.\n\nDisclosure and Conflict of Interest\n\nSpecial information or ideas obtained through peer review should be kept confidential and not used for personal gain. Reviewers may not consider manuscripts in which they have a conflict of interest resulting from competition, collaboration, or other relationships or relationships with any of the authors, companies, or agencies linked to the paper.\n\nAuthor's Duties\n\nStandard reporting\n\nThe author of the original research report must present an accurate report on the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. The underlying data should be accurately represented in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient details and references to enable others to replicate the work. Fraudulent or intentionally inaccurate statements are unethical and unacceptable behavior.\n\nData Access and Retention\n\nAuthors are required to provide raw data in connection with papers for editorial reviews, and must be prepared to provide public access to the data (consistently), where possible, and should be in any event. be prepared to keep the data for a reasonable time after publication.\n\nOriginality and Plagiarism\n\nThe authors shall ensure that they have written works which are completely original, and if the author has used the work and \/ or the words of others that have been quoted or quoted appropriately.\n\nDuplicate, Redundant, or Simultaneous Publication\n\nA writer should not generally publish a script that explains essentially the same research in more than one major journal or publication. Sending the same script to more than one journal simultaneously is unethical and unacceptable publishing behavior.\n\nSource Recognition\n\nAppropriate recognition of the work of others must always be given. The author should cite publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the work reported.\n\nPaper Stamps\n\nAuthors should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, implementation, or interpretation of reported research. Anyone who has made a significant contribution should be registered as a coauthor. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of a research project, they must be recognized or registered as contributors. The appropriate author must ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no coauthor are incorporated on paper, and that all co-authors have reviewed and approved the final version of this paper and have approved the submission for publication.\n\nDisclosure and Conflict of Interest\n\nAll authors should disclose in their text any financial conflicts or other substantive conflicts that may be interpreted to influence the outcome or interpretation of their manuscript. All sources of financial support for the project should be disclosed.\n\nFundamental mistake in published work\n\nWhen a writer finds significant errors or inaccuracies in his published work, it is the duty of the writer to immediately notify the journal or publisher editors and work with the editor to retract or correct the paper.\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism Policy\n\nPlagiarism Policy\nPlagiarism Includes But Unlimited to:\n\nReferring and \/ or quoting terms, words and \/ or sentences, data and \/ or information from a source without citing sources in the citation notes and \/ or without adequately mentioning the source;\nReferring and \/ or citing random terms, words and \/ or sentences, data and \/ or information from sources without quoting sources in citation notes and \/ or without adequately mentioning sources;\nUsing the source of ideas, opinions, views, or theories without adequately declaring the source;\nFormulate the words and \/ or sentences themselves from the source of words and \/ or phrases, ideas, opinions, views, or theories without adequately declaring the source;\nSubmit a scientific paper produced and \/ or published by others as a source of scientific work without adequately disclosing it.\n\n\nJurnal\u00a0Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia will ensure that any published article will not exceed 20% equality score. Plagiarism screening will be done by Jurnal\u00a0Akses\u00a0Pengabdian\u00a0Indonesia using Plagiarism Turniti... (truncated)",

        "text":"Policy on Religious Accommodation for Missed Classes, Assignments, and Exams\n\nThe University of Chicago is home to students of all the world\u2019s major religions and, though firmly a secular institution, values the rich diversity of spiritual expression and practice found on campus. It is therefore the policy of the University that students who miss class, assignments, or exams to observe a religious holiday must be accommodated as follows: (i) absences may not be counted as a missed class in any course in which attendance is a measure of academic performance; (ii) reasonable extensions of time must be given, without academic penalty, for missed assignments; and (iii) exams must be reasonably rescheduled without academic penalty. Where a religious holiday occurs during the first week of the quarter, students who miss the first meeting of a class due to religious observance may not be dropped from the course roster, provided that they have given advance notice to the instructor of record of the need to miss the class due to a religious holiday.\n\nStudents must inform their instructors in writing of their need to observe a religious holiday reasonably well in advance of the absence, preferably at the beginning of the quarter. It is incumbent on the student who misses a class to catch up on any material discussed and assignments given during that class period. As a guide to students and to instructors in planning their courses and assignments, a list of religious holidays where observance may compete with the demands of the academic calendar can be found here. This list is not a designation of religious holidays recognized by the University; it is simply an aid for planning purposes.\n\nAny instructor with concerns regarding either a given holiday or the academic implications of a particular student\u2019s religious observance of holidays may seek guidance from the chair of their department; dean of their school; the Vice Provost for Academic Leadership, Advancement, and Diversity; or the Dean of Rockefeller Chapel. Additional resources include the area Dean of Students and the director of Spiritual Life.",
