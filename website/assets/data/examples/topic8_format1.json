Gianni Versace put color in the runaways and magazine layout like never before, \u00a0and made it into fashion. \u00a0Soon after his death, the fashion world saw fashion in black and white again literally. Everything he did in the fashion world turn to an instant worldwide sensation.\n\nAnd so he created the term supermodels creating voluptuous unknown names into power houses. These beautiful women chosen by fashion mogul Gianni Versace embraced the fashion runaways and sold out magazines . Gianni Versace was known to be a nurturer of fashion almost like \u00a0a fashion father figure to this powerful new models. When he started paying models like Linda Evangelista over $20,000 dollars per show just to walk down his runaway they became supermodels.\n\nAccording to the New York Times :\n\n\u00a0The show brought together the supermodels that Gianni Versace helped create \u2014 Carla Bruni, Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Helena Christensen \u2014 and the new generation of celebrity models that Donatella Versace says is the first in decades to exude the requisite confidence: Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and now Kaia Gerber, Crawford's daughter.\nSupermodels like Naomi Campbell immediately tweeted to Fashion House Designer Donetella Versace:\n\nThere were tweets like, A show to remember. For the 20th anniversary of the death of Gianni .\nBack then it took a super fashion mega designer like Gianni Versace to create the supermodels. Now things are a little different because a name like Kaia Gerber will become an overnight success by simply being Cindy Crawford daughter. Let us look at it this way, she just started doing her first fashion show and she is all over the fashion runaways promoting big names like\n\nCindy Crawford, a supermodel of the 1990s along with her daugher now fashion model daughter Kaia Gerber who is just 16 years old.\n\nOn September 20, 2017 Kaia Gerber tweeted out her first fashion show.\n\nIf Gianni Versace would have been alive today, the fashion industry would certainly be totally different than what it is today. Uniting and creating a dominance and breaking new grounds. That is what Gianni Versace would have created.\n\nI think i am too really have to break barriers every day..most of the people are blind, said Gianni Versace in 1994 interview with Charlie Rose. Gianni Versace was comfortably genuine, almost humble to a sense and that is how he broke barriers.\n\nGIANNI VERSACE The last Haute Couture Show 1997 Ritz Hotel Paris by Fashion Channel\n\nSeptember 17-23 2017 Week 3\n7.4 magnitude Mexico City Earthquake Trend: My Daughter is Buried and No One Looking For Her?\nMAPS the World's Largest Marine Protected Area Milan Fashion Week 2017: How Sustainable will Milan Fashion Week Be?\nLondon Fashion Week Ban Fur Petition\nBREAKING NEWS: 7.4 Magnitude Mexico City\/ Terremoto en Ciudad de Mexico 7.4\nMartial Law Declared in London\nSeptember 10-16 2017 Week 2\nDecoding Jose Maria Lee Hurricanes.html\nInspiring Others at Fashion Week\nLondon Fashion Week Ban Fur Petition\nProtest at Fashion Week\u00a0\nLondon Fashion Week 2017\u00a0\nNew York Fashion Week Sept-13, 2017\nNorth Korea Fires Missile\u00a0\nAfter Irma's Aftermath IRMA Moving Northward Near FT.

        "text":"CATEGORIES\uff1aLouis Vuitton\n\n\nBackpacks are no longer boring schoolbags, they\u2019re hip, stylish and are trending like no tomorrow. For now, the Palm Springs Backpack is stealing every show in the House of Louis Vuitton. The reason is because of its classic style, the simplicity and the flawless material. The updated Montsouris Backpack is a different design due to its distinctive look. It\u2019s introduced for the Fall Winter 2017 Collection, now let\u2019s talk about that!\n\n\nThe Original Louis Vuitton Montsouris Backpack (Now Vintage)\nInstagram @fashionphile\n\nThe Design\n\nThe Louis Vuitton Montsouris Backpack is made to be a chic city bag. The look is modern and it\u2019s a feminine update of the historic Montsouris model. The older version is no longer available and it\u2019s considered a \u2018vintage\u2019.\n\nIf compare the old with the new backpack, the biggest differences are the Monogram Canvas color and the brighter-version of the long straps. The front features two long drawstrings, which is secured by a buckle. The drawstring is useful, but it\u2019s also stylish.\n\nThe front pocket is hidden inside and it appears to be \u2018one\u2019 with the design. It comes with a top handle in case you want to hand carry, but you can also carry it on your back with those beautiful back straps. Those back straps are thin and feminine, unlike the thicker version on the\u00a0Palm Spring Backpack.\n\nThe Interior\n\nBackpacks are always roomy and easy to carry. The interior of this bag is made with one large compartment and a flat pocket.\n\nThe Sizes And Prices\n\nMeasuring 10\u2019 x 11.4\u2019 x 3.5\u2019 inches, priced at $1830 USD, \u20ac1390 euro, \u00a31300 GBP, $2370 CAD, $15200 HKD, \u00a514100 CNY, \u00a5218160 JPY via Louis Vuitton boutiques.\n\nTags: Louis Vuitton Backpack MONTSOURIS\n\ncomnum(0) tbcount(0) tbcount(165)\n\n\n\n\nLuxury backpacks are no longer a thing of the past as Chanel is slowly but surely bringing them back in circulation. Ladies, you need not fret as Chanel Chevron and Diamond Quilted Urban Spirit Backpack is here to stay.\n\nFirst released in the Spring Summer 2016 Collection, the demand for this backpack is getting bigger so Chanel might reintroduce this handy backpack lifesaver for their next collection.\n\nSay goodbye to those days when backpacks are marketed only for high schoolers since the time has come for you to wear this in style wherever you go. If you prefer the classic style, the timeless appeal of the Urban Spirit Backpack in diamond quilting might be your best bet. And if you are looking for that modern touch, the Urban Spirit Backpack in Chevron quilting is the bag to choose.\n\nA work of art with their own distinct style, you can always have the two if you couldn\u2019t decide which one to choose. Featuring a front flap and the iconic CC logo, this backpack quite resembles the Classic Flap Bag but this one comes with a long bottom. Also worth noticing are the straps, which are partly designed with Chanel\u2019s signature interwoven chain links.\n\nWhich one would you rather pick?

Introducing, the Aliosha backpack \u2013 a sleek, funky bag that\u2019s power-packed with space, functionality and unique design elements. This is totally the bag to have!\n\nThe Aliosha backpack was made for everyday wear \u2013 it has a durable black leather and fishnet exterior which is made to last for future uses (we\u2019re talking about years of use here). It has a techno-chic black pyramid mesh and holodot design, which is reminiscent of sci-fi stuff all guys dig (Matrix, anyone?).\n\nFor the fun-loving, techy man who\u2019s always on-the-go, this backpack offers multiple pockets and a spacious interior which gives more room for gadgets (an iPad maybe, car keys, a wallet, headphones, and others). The organized dudes would love this baby, it has everything they need!\n\nPriced at $1895 USD or \u20ac1295 EUR, you can get this baby via Christian Louboutin\u00a0online boutique.\n\n\n\nTags: Christian Louboutin Backpack ALIOSHA\n\ncomnum(0) tbcount(0) tbcount(393)\n\nA Look Back at the Most Important Bags of 2014\n\n\nTags: Chanel Backpack Graffiti\n\ncomnum(0) tbcount(0) tbcount(475)\n\nGucci Bamboo Backpack\n\n\n\nIt was just a matter of time before Gucci came up with their own Backpack. But who had thought that they would mix the style with elements from the \u2018Classic Bamboo\u2019 Collection. It\u2019s a clever move to differentiate theirs from the rest.\n\nBut anyways, I hope you don\u2019t mind I use the word again: \u2018they are super cute\u2019. The size is very lady-like if you can imagine it clinching on your back. I love the buckle on the back, I love the extra tassels that slings when you are on your way downtown, I love the Bamboo closure on both side pockets.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a sophisticated style with a retro edge.\n\nA bamboo handle is crafted on the top (for the moments when you want to carry it by hand), the signature is exactly how I like it \u2013 printed on the center, small and gentle.\n\nMade from leather, with front double pockets, it comes with a flap with buckle closure and interior drawstring closure (so basically, with double security!) The double shoulder strap can be adjusted and the edges are hand-painted. The inside has an open pocket and phone case. Measuring 12.2\u2019 x 11.8\u2019 x 3\u2019 (W x H x D), priced at $2,590 USD via Gucci\u00a0e-store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Gucci Bamboo Backpack\n\ncomnum(0) tbcount(0) tbcount(513)\n\nKate Spade Classic Molly Backpack\n\n\n\nAnd so it has begun.\n\nEven Kate Spade has joined the \u2018Backpack\u2019 Club, soon we will have so many choices than we cannot pick.\n\nI love backpacks; they are great and can be very handy. They are also easy to store essentials, especially when they are heavy like books or laptops. And I love the way it sits on our back.\n\nBut then, too many backpacks in your wardrobe is not cool. Backpacks are great for occasions, or travelling. Would you rather have 10 gorgeous tote bag or 10 backpacks?\n\nPresenting the Kate Spade Classic Nylon Molly Backpack.
