C. Penney; and its air-conditioning\u2014seventy-two degrees, year-round! Two years later, the Toledo\u00a0Blade\u00a0published a front-page article about the photo-takers and people-watchers who gathered around the mall\u2019s marble fountain, \u201cthat gushing monument to big spending and the shopping spree.\u201d The story quoted an anonymous businessman: \u201cThe water has a great calming effect on a person, especially when you\u2019ve been badgered all morning.\u201d This week, Woodville is being torn down.
