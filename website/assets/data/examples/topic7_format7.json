They are passionate about travel and are even sometimes called the wanderers of the Chinese Zodiac.\n\nSo, is it possible for two horse soulmates to find long-lasting love? Can two nomadic personalities travel the course together? Will the urge to travel ultimately send them down opposing paths? For two people so much alike, what kind of obstacles will they have to overcome to be together forever?\n\nChinese Horse Horse Compatibility. The Horse Horse relationship together can typically mean just an extra dose of good times.\n\nHorse Horse Love Compatibility\n\nChinese Love Compatibility\n\nDate of Birth:\nPartner's Name\nPartner's DOB\n\nThe great thing about two horses in love with each other is that they immediately recognize a deep bond. They see the similarities in each other and the tendencies to wander and feel restless. They are kindred spirits and often experience an instant and outright interest. Because horses are generally fun loving, not to mention bright and lively, the Horse Horse relationship together can typically mean just an extra dose of good times.\n\nHowever, the impulsive nature of horses can make things difficult from time to time. They love attention. Obviously there are times when two horses will war for the limelight, leaving the losing party to feel eclipsed by the winner.\n\nTo make things even trickier, a horse can change their mind at any given moment. Two horses dating each other means two fickle attitudes that are constantly changing. They won\u2019t always change at the same time in the same direction either.\n\nWhen it comes to romance, horses begin with a lot of energy and intensity. They have a fiery passion to pursue their new interest. The idea of love is a magnificent thing to them and they will jump wholeheartedly into a new romance. They are familiar with the art of seduction. Sexually the horse man and horse woman in bed will use every method in the seduction handbook to woo their new love.\n\nThat intensity is tempered by the fact that horses are the most erratic creatures in Chinese Astrology. Their minds, moods, and opinions are ever changing like the wind. Sadly, this means that the male horse and female horse friendship can lose steam quite suddenly. And one day just no longer have the same feelings they did before.\n\nSuddenly the Horse-Horse breakup will occur and they will move onto something else \u2013 a new conquest, whether work or love related. Other horses will definitely recognize this urge and they understand it, but that understanding is not enough necessarily to bridge a longstanding attachment.\n\nThe Chinese Horse zodiac sign tend to be complicated creatures, desiring affection and familiarity, but then feel stifled once they find it. They can fall in love freely, as flirtation and persuasion both come naturally to them. They\u2019re found to be bright and lively and their attendance at parties makes things very interesting.\n\nTheir love of wandering extends beyond travel into their everyday lives. Horses can find themselves moving from one project to another without any breathing room in between. Like many others, they seek acceptance. Yet at the same time, their flexibility and autonomy are crucial for them to maintain.\n\nThough they might not show it, horses often feel inferior and seek out new groups (no doubt another part of their wanderlust) to engage in. They have a tendency to be impatient, which can drive others to feel their needs are being overlooked. The very much have a need to solve problems themselves rather than waiting for others to decide the best course of action. This can result in others being pushed away, but at the same time this trait of the horse contributes to their success rate.\n\nThe Horse is very much self-sufficient and can find themselves bored with typical jobs doing a daily grind. They will work through the boredom to advance. However, a lack of concentration on the broad view can lead to romantic exchanges and business engagements concluding too soon for them. It\u2019s a shame, considering how they have an inherent ability to supply encouragement and pull off a tremendous amount.\n\nThe feelings between two horses in a marriage often are mirror images of each other. A strong attraction will beget a strong attraction. However, a high percentage of love compatibility can\u2019t stop stress from entering the relationship. There are various personality obstacles to overcome. Yet, if they can find inner peace, both of them, together, it is entirely possible for them to settle down and enjoy a long, happy relationship. Finding inner peace allows them to slow their wanderlust and appreciate more of what they have.\n\nHorse & Horse Chinese Horoscope Compatibility Rated 3 Hearts!\n\nRead also: Corresponding Star Sign",

        "text":"What are Padrinos?\n\nEveryone has heard the term, but what are padrinos exactly? Well, in english, it directly translates to two things, either \u201cgodparents\u201d or \u201csponsors\u201d, and both definitions play an important role in the latino community. \u00a0Padrinos and madrinas are ultimately the fairy godparents that are there for you throughout your life and especially during your big life events. Traditionally, during big events like quinceaneras, weddings, and baptisms, padrinos are chosen to accompany the person (or persons) being celebrated during the church ceremony and throughout the reception. Traditionally, they also help pay for the religious items used in the ceremony, like the bible, cross, rings, etc.\n\nNowadays, padrinos contribute in many more ways too. Some offer monetary gifts to help the person(s) being celebrated and their family pay for the party. Others choose to help by donating their time and effort to help make things like food or decorations, or who help with the tiny-but-important details, like buying the party favors and drinks.\n\nMaria with her Padrino\n\nHere is a quick break down of all the potential padrinos and madrinas that you could have at your quinceanera or wedding:\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos and Madrinas\n\nPadrinos and Madrinas are there to help you with whatever you may need, but they aren\u2019t only there to help you financially. They are also there to be your mentors, someone to go to when help is needed. They can help guide the quincea\u00f1era through their next steps in life. This wedding and quinceanera tradition is still widely used, especially within the Mexican community. Your padrinos can be any of the following:\n\n  \u2022 Friends\n  \u2022 Family\n  \u2022 Neighbors\n\nIt can be anyone close to the quinceanera\/novios or someone who just wants to help!\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos de Honor\n\nThe Padrinos de honor are the main padrinos of your quinceanera or wedding. This is not to say that the others are not as important, but these, in particular, will accompany you throughout your whole event. In most cases, the Padrinos de Honor are typically the same ones from your baptism.\n\nThey will play a huge part in the ceremony, especially for a quinceanera. They will sit or stand near the quincea\u00f1era at certain times and present her with some of the important ceremonial items (see below). They are also traditionally supposed to help pay for most of the party, but, in today\u2019s day, you can have as many people help out as you want!\n\n  \u2022 Padrinos (Godparents)\n\nSome quincea\u00f1eras and couples also have actual padrinos (godparents) from baptism, communion, or confirmation. They are typically involved throughout your entire life, \u00a0including presenting you to one of the Catholic sacraments. They often help out with big life events in one way or another, since they have already been around for so many of them in the past.\n\n\nPadrinos can be chosen by the person and family holding the event, but many padrinos usually offer themselves to be a padrino. Padrinos are some of the most important people that will participate in your event. If you have padrinos already in place or have yet to choose them, accept every bit of help \u2014 it goes a long way in planning your party! When accepting, always keep in mind that their help comes from a place of love and excitement for the person(s) being celebrated.\n\nIf you are celebrating a quinceanera, make sure to check out our planning guide on quinceanera traditions here.\n\nDiscussion2 comments\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Parents encourage their sons to play with toy guns and rejoice when boys can stand up for themselves. Every Russian man internalizes such principles as not letting others to hurt himself or his family, being able to physically challenge an attacker, protecting the weak, and always resisting an urge to cry.\n\nBehind the brick wall\n\nAlthough not every Russian man manages to correspond to the values imposed by the society, most Russian males strongly believe that their calling in life is to protect and provide for their family, support their parents, children and wife. Russians even have a saying to describe men - \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439 which means \"as if behind the stone wall\". The saying is used in the sense that a man is strong and reliable like a solid wall behind which a woman can hide and forget all her fears and worries.\n\nGentle and romantic\n\nDespite everything, Russian men are very romantic at heart. They are capable of experiencing deep feelings and know how to be loyal and faithful. When a woman awards her beloved one with affection the man becomes caring and gentle, gives flowers and presents to his darling. Russian men feel shy about their weaknesses and rarely open their heart before strangers. However they stay open to their wives and are able to address any concern.\n\nCareer and success\n\nIn Russia, it is traditionally believed that a man must be more successful at work as compared to a woman. Building a career is easier for males and they usually earn higher salaries as compared to females. Still there is no absolute guarantee against economic difficulties. If a man fails to succeed in life he can experience difficult times, which in turn causes increased alcohol consumption to relieve the effects of stress. During such difficult times, it is important for Russian men to find support from the loved ones who can understand and support the man.\n\nMale friendships and entertainment for men\n\nRussian men place great importance on friendships. In Russia, men tend to build their friendships for years and male friends often become as close as relatives. The companies of male friends often entertain themselves with such traditional activities for men as fishing and hunting. Fishing and hunting are the hobbies of practically all men in Russia. Russian women do not normally participate in these traditionally masculine activities, preferring to stay at home and wait patiently for their husbands to come back.\n\nGot questions?\n\nAsk them in the Russian Questions and Answers \u2014 a place for students, teachers and native Russian speakers to discuss Russian grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and other aspects of the Russian language.\n\nCopyright 2001-2022 MasterRussian.com | Privacy Policy | Contact Us\n\n--> \ufeff Search MasterRussian\n\nCustom Search\n\nEnglish\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0Russian\u00a0dictionary\n\nLike MasterRussian on Facebook\n\n\u00a0RSS | iGoogle | My Yahoo!\n\n\ufeffWord: \u0440\u0430\u0437\nMeaning: time, one, once\nPronunciation: [rahs]\nLearn Russian words more... \u00bb\n\n\n\n\nRussian: \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f\nEnglish: Watch for cars\n\n\nMasterRussian on Twitter",
