Committed to building community and making programming more accessible, Brenna is an organizer of NodeSchool Toronto, a volunteer instructor for Ladies Learning Code, and a former bootcamp instructor for HackerYou.\n\nBrenna loves mixing code with math and geometry, which led her to create, and continues to inspire her experiments with SVG and D3.js.

For many JS beginners, this will be the first programming language they encounter. And if that wasn't challenging enough, there's also immense cultural pressure to live up to unrealistic standards of what it means to be a successful JS developer today.\n\nIn this talk, we'll debunk the myth of the \u201creal JavaScript developer\u201d - a magical creature who knows it all, writing perfect code in the hottest new framework without ever needed to stop and take a break. We'll look at simple strategies to help beginners on their journey learning JavaScript and also come up with a more realistic definition of what it means to be a successful JavaScript developer today.\n\nBecome a Sponsor\n\nBy sponsoring Front-Trends, you'll reach thousands of professional web developers (both at the event and online once videos are posted).\n\nCheck out our sponsorship opportunities or get in touch with us at [email\u00a0protected] for more information.",

By looking at log files and using tools such as Google Analytics, we can see who is using a site and in what way, and then we can make decisions about how to improve the site to best achieve the goals of the site.\n\n\u2013 SEO \u2013 Search-Engine Optimization\nSearch engines \u2013 specifically Google \u2013 are often the primary way new readers find sites. There are techniques we can use to make sure that people find your site.\n\n\u2013 Site Maintenance\nDevelopment is only one part of running a website. Once the site is live and the developers have gone, there are still the weekly or monthly updates and tweaks that your current staff are too busy to do. But at the same time, there isn\u2019t enough work to justify hiring someone even on a part-time basis. In that scenario, I can work on a regular arrangement to do a monthly or quarterly \u201ctune-up\u201d where I make sure your Drupal or WordPress site is up-to-date and make any content changes you need.\n\n\u2013 Media Production\nI make and maintain websites. These days I do far more customization of existing content management systems (CMSs such as Drupal, WordPress, etc.) than I build sites from scratch. Also, I now do as much user experience design, content development, and usage analysis as I do coding.\n\nI am a generalist and think of myself more as a \u201cweb mechanic\u201d than \u201cweb engineer\u201d. I develop web applications and also troubleshoot other people\u2019s applications when they don\u2019t work.\n\nIn terms of specific skills:\n\nI use everyday:\nPHP, MySQL, CSS, Photoshop\n\n\u2026 every month:\nFlash, JavaScript, ColdFusion\n\n\u2026 and have used:\nASP, Perl, shell scripting, AfterEffects, ProTools, and lots more",
