I have been a great fan of it, and have waited months for an update. The writing is exquisite, the plot is tremendously enjoyable - and I am not one to comment on stories unless I enjoy them tremendously.

When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?\n\nThis story is canon-compliant with the Harry Potter universe, but the characters and settings are all original.

But I soon became (crazily enough) an avid Alex\/David shipper.\nCan I speculate on what I think may happen next? I'm only putting this down in a review so I can check in later, and hope that I was right... or at least see how ludicrous my assumptions were!\nI think that the Governor-General will find out about the letter, and Alex will get in trouble.\nI think that the locket will resurface and it will be a means for Alex to communicate with her father.\nI think someone else will try to kill her.\nTell me if I guess right, okay? Actually, don't tell me. I love the surprises... especially the ones your stories hold!\n\nAuthor's Response: Well, you'll get at least one answer in the next book. ;) Thanks for the review, and I am glad you enjoyed the story!\n\nAlexandra Quick and the Lands Below by Inverarity\n\nRated: 3rd-5th Years \u2022 275 Reviews Past Featured Story\n\nSeventh grader Alexandra Quick returns to Charmbridge Academy.

I wait and check my email every day for an update on Alexandra. I have no idea if I'm your only reader, but even if I am, can you promise to keep writing about Alexandra and her father? The stories fascinate me, and I always am looking forward to more!\n\nAuthor's Response: Thank you so much. I do plan to keep writing about Alexandra and her father. Book Three is in progress now.",

I was on an airplane headed to a conference in Florida. I was supposed to be writing a completely different book, one with a deadline looming. This young woman strolled into my imagination and was beset by ninjas who wanted to take something she had.\n\nMind you, I had no idea what she had, why she had it, who the ninjas were and why they wanted it or anything else. I wrote the few paragraphs, tucked them away and returned to the book with the looming deadline.\n\nMelina kept pestering me, though. How did she learn to fight so well? Did she have special abilities? How did she get them? What was she carrying? To whom? As I learned more and more about Melina, I met her friends and her family and saw more and more of the situations in which she found herself. She had me hooked.\n\nIt seemed like every time I turned around, I learned something that fit perfectly into the book. There are special Chinese vampires called kiang shi? There are underground tunnels in Sacramento from when they raised the city? There are grow houses in suburban developments? Everything around me seemed to be begging to be put in this book and I hate to disappoint something that actually begs for me something, a fact my children know all too well.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved the stories where an ordinary someone becomes a hero when thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Melina is not exactly ordinary, but she longs to be and she is definitely a small cog in the very big wheel that makes her world turn. The moment the ninjas jump her starts a chain of events that force her to change from a twenty-something slacker with no direction into a heroine who fights for herself and everyone else who doesn\u2019t have anyone to fight for them. She transforms herself from being simply the protagonist to being a true hero and I love her for it. Telling her story in Don\u2019t Kill the Messenger was an incredible pleasure for me and I think you\u2019ll enjoy reading it.\n\nI\u2019ve loved getting to know Melina and her world and am looking forward to returning to it for the next installment of Melina\u2019s adventures next spring. I\u2019d love to hear from you about what you think. Please stop by my website at for contact information and more information about my other projects.\n\n\u2014Eileen Rendahl\n\nBack to Top",

After 20 years spent trying to live a regular life working in the software industry, where I met my wife and did normal stuff, I finally succumbed to science fiction-itis in 2011, and now earn my living writing science fiction novels.\n\nI\u2019ve also very proud to have published other authors through imprints: Greyhart Press, The Repository of Imagination, and Human Legion Publications.\n\nLast time I counted (early 2019) I\u2019d sold just shy of 250,000 books since 2011.\n\nMy most popular books are set in the Human Legion Universe of military SF\/ space opera or the mech mayhem of the Four Horsemen Universe, created by Mark H Wandrey and Chris Kennedy. If you click or tap on the image, you can join the Legion and get free books. Or you can find out more at humanlegion.com\n\n1 Response to About me\n\n  1. Hi Tim!

        "text":"Jeanne Fiedler\n\nBelow Are Your Selected Attending Tradeshow\n\nI have both published books and have written all over the web. I try to write naturally, honestly and sincerely. I touch on subjects such as nature, spirituality, philosophy, politics, trauma, loss, grieving, growing, happiness, love and more. I have a Transformative Language Arts certificate that helps me, if traditional methods don't work, to use another way to teach myself and others. I write for the beauty of it and also because it can be so helpful as a release of negativity. I use photos to write about. At Blurb Publishing, I write books that have both photos and poems or stories and illustrations, where all the photos are my own. I have published books also by Bookwhirl Publishing and Xlibris Publishing, and I plan to write more and grow and develop as a artist.\nMy story is a message of hope. I hope to have a bestselling book to use as a venue to demonstrate my methodology. I want to keep writing and increase the sales of my books. I would also like to find someplace where I can teach and help people through writing and journaling. I love writing and making books and would like to spread my message all over the world. My books are simple and don't give readers complex meanings to decipher. I just would like to uplift and bring joy to them and, in doing so, help them and myself to grow and transcend negative circumstances.",
