        "text":"packing light for summer\n\nPacking light while keeping fashion in mind\n\nWe are going to talk about how to packing light while keeping fashion in mind, and how Halftees can help you transition several different dresses and tops to make the outfits to look different. This way you\u2019re not packing so much but you\u2019re getting lots of different looks with Halftee.\n\nPacking light for summer fashion\n\nA: Noelle is the travel expert. She has traveled a ton! But I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s so much of a packing-light expert. I remember traveling to Germany a couple of years ago with her and she lost her huge bags, and I was secretly excited because of how big it was. If we would've had to travel around Germany with that darn bag--oh it was so bad, she was devastated. It all came back and eventually worked out.\n\nN: It didn\u2019t come back for about 5 days, but this is what I learned about packing: you do not bring a check-in suitcase. You really have to have a carry-on suitcase with you because almost always there are\u00a0mishaps when you check a bag. At least three times my checked bag has gotten lost going to Europe.\n\nI\u2019m one of those people that have to have a lot of things because I\u2019m always thinking what if you need a dress or a pair of dressy shoes or tennis shoes or whatever-you just never know. I have learned to pack so much stuff in a teeny little suitcase, get everything in there, carry it on, throw it in your overhead compartment on the airplane and it\u2019s with you!\n\nHere is how I do it: I\u2019m telling you, I can pack about three pairs of jeans, a couple different shirts, and a couple different dresses. The thing\u00a0is, I probably air on the high side of the makeup and the shoes, but when it comes to the clothes this is what\u2019s super fun about Halftees. We can have a few dresses, a few tops, and intermix them with different styles of Halftees. So on my trips, I always bring the tank, always bring the \u00be-because\u00a0what if it gets a little chilly, always the basic, and a lace because sometimes I want to dress things up.\n\nWhat I can do is pick out a few basic dresses, and maybe I\u2019m putting a tank under it, maybe I\u2019m putting a lace under it, or maybe a basic--do you see where I\u2019m going with this? Intermixing Halftees with basic pieces like these changes the whole look and saves all the excess space Halftees avoid in your suitcase.\n\nHow to keep it tight: I roll my clothes so that I can stack more makeup into it. I can layer up my dresses, shirts, one jacket, some beachy pants, t-shirts, and a few different styles of Halftees all in a carry-on and still have plenty of room left.\n\nI also found that cute makeup bags are the most efficient way to store makeup and keep things as flat as possible. They just spread out.\n\nIt is so refreshing to pack light because you have less stuff to drag around.\u00a0\n\nA: I travel really heavy with skirts, because I feel like skirts are lighter--they can be dressed up or they can be dressed down. I throw in a basic, a fun color for a tank so I can get a pop of color, and I\u2019ll pack literally two or three skirts. I\u2019d rather go to Disneyland in a skirt anyday than jean shorts. That\u2019s my two cents: Skirts are the way to go.\n\nN: I could literally roll and layer my clothes forever. The most important point is that I\u2019m trying to scale back on the clothes, and amp up the shoes and the makeup. You can do that by adding a few Halftees so you can swap your shirts and get different looks with different styles of Halftees. \u00a0\n\nWhere do you go on\u00a0vacation? How do you pack light? What are some of your tricks that you like to do when you\u00a0pack your bags and try to pack as much as possible? Throw some fun colors in there like stripes, and pinks, and blues. It really looks like a different outfit with new Halftees under them. Happy vacationing!\n\n\nLeave a comment\n\nAll blog comments are checked prior to publishing",

        "text":"Tuesday, September 23, 2008\n\nBeautiful Belles: Twiggy\n\nA series focusing on beautiful women throughout history with important contributions to the arts and entertainment industry and charity -- and a fabulous sense of beauty, inside and out!\n\nWho do we have to thank for long, lush lashes that go on for days and days? Why, Twiggy, of course. The first super-thin supermodel became famous in the 1960s for her big doe eyes, long eyelashes, and -- no surprise here -- her rail-thin frame. (Yes, there were ultra-skinny models before Kate Moss!) Weighing only 90 pounds when she was discovered at the age of 16, Twiggy -- born Lesley Hornby -- became known for the high fashion mod look created by English fashion designer Mary Quant.\n\nTwiggy's popularity and fascination only continued to grow after she was discovered. Her short hair was utterly modern and married the masculine\/feminine side of fashion effortlessly. She was even regarded as one of the faces of \"Swinging London\" -- yes, the era made famous by Austin Powers!\n\nTwiggy's sense of style and beauty is truly iconic. One cannot think of the mod period without associating her along with it. Her big doe eyes were always, always accented with loads of black mascara -- and it's rumored that she would even\ndraw on an extra layer of lashes underneath her eyes for more volume! She kept the rest of her look simple, paring the traditional smoky eye with a nude glossy lip and clear, fresh skin. And let's not forget that hair! Her chopped, boy-meets-girl haircut came at a time when most women revered long tresses. This haircut even inspired me during my college years, when I decided to chop off all my hair!\n\nRecent fans of Twiggy will recognize her from her years as a judge on America's Next Top Model -- a role which, sadly, has now been handed over to Paulina Porizkova. But Twiggy is still out and about, modeling for Marks and Spencer and acting in various movies and television shows. She's appeared The Blues Brothers, Pygmalion (as Eliza Doolittle), The Boy Friend and Edge of Seventeen, just to name a few of her many credits. And all the while, she's looking absolutely fabulous. Her hair is longer and blonder, her makeup is softer, but she still embodies that girl from the 1960s with her beautiful big eyes and dewy skin.\n\nNot only contributing to the fashion, beauty and entertainment worlds, however, Twiggy has donated her time and money to Breakthrough Breast Cancer -- a charity in the UK which supports breast cancer education and research.\n\nTwiggy is truly a fashion and beauty icon. One can only hope she continues to make the arena interesting in years to come!\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\nBlog Widget by LinkWithin",

No zips, no fuss.\n\nI used 1.5m of fabric, which may have been a bit too substantial\u2026\n\n\u2026but it twirls delightfully!\nI love it. I want six of them. I\u2019ve already picked my next fabric (polkadots! or maybe stripes.)\nMeanwhile, all of my flats seem to be \u2013 simultaneously \u2013 having the soles walked out of them, so I bought a new pair in the Wittner sales \u2013 aren\u2019t they adorable?\n\n20 thoughts on \u201cDIY: Oui Oui!\n\n  1. perfect!\n    Love your DIY skirt its simply devine, you look so fun and carefree in these pics\n    the shoes are delightful too xxx\n\n    ps I have bought myself some of that yellow bird seed material and am making my daughter a dress with it as I cant get over how stunning you look in yours xxx\n\n  2.

It is the best skirt ever to make AND wear \ud83d\ude00\n    It looks lovely on you!\n    That is amazing material, I hope when next we meet we can organise a fabric shopping adventure together!\n\n  6. Please!!! I know that your magnificent necklace is a present of your sister, but would it be possible to know if we can buy him(it) on Internet? If the shop which sells this magnificent necklace has a web site? I live in France and to me, I know a creator who makes this kind of thing but it is frightfully expensive. Thank you very much beforehand about is your answer. Beautiful day to you!\n\n  7. Oh, I keep coming back to read if you've written here that you're going to share all the DIY details.\n\n    Please tell us you will. Please. Pretty please. xx\n\n  8. That's great, Sarah-Jo! It's the cutest fabric, isn't it?\n\n    Me too, Michelle\u2026 I still couldn't find the exact fabric I was looking for though. Something with bold navy & white stripes.\n\n    Hi Katie, I didn't use a pattern, but I'll do a proper DIY post with sew-as-you-go instructions soon, I promise!\n\n    I'm actually tempted, Chantelle\u2026 the Frocks & FrouFrou shopfront, with full skirts & remixed bow cardigans!

        "text":"doing things the victorian way\n\nTag Archives: beauty\n\nI really don\u2019t understand America\u2019s obsession with daily hair washing.\u00a0 I blame it on ad campaigns and ignorance mostly but it makes me a bit angry. It irks me in particular when people assume that, pre-WWI, everyone walked around with greasy, smelly hair (and also that everyone smelled in general, but that\u2019s a different post). Our society is so much healthier now, isn\u2019t it?\n\nLet me dish out some science here \u2013 the scalp and body only produce as much oil as it needs to be healthy. The reason modern folks \u201cneed\u201d to wash their hair everyday is because they wash their hair everyday. Your scalp is just trying to fight back. The more you strip the oil, the more oil your body produces in order to compensate. I only wash my hair once a month, and even then without any soap, and it looks perfectly fine. In fact, it\u2019s incredibly healthy, shiny, and soft because I\u2019m not damaging it on a daily basis. It also grows like a fiend. I know it sounds gross by modern standards but I\u2019ve even had several beauticians ask me what my secret is. Seriously, stop spending so much money on hair care products and just stop washing it so often. You can thank me later.*\n\nAll right, lecture over. On to Victorian Hair Care!\n\nrosemarySoap was incredibly harsh back in olden times and the average person didn\u2019t have the luxury of running water. That meant hauling and heating water to bathe and, as someone who does that, I can attest that it\u2019s a big pain in the ass. So, at the very least by necessity, washing hair didn\u2019t happen often. Instead, there were many remedies and solutions to keep hair looking healthy and I\u2019ve listed just a few of the healthier treatments below.\n\n  \u2022 To Strength Hair and Improve Growth \u2013 A handful of box (buxus sempervirens) leaves added to a pint of boiling water. Infuse until cold, drain liquid and add to it several drops of alcohol to preserve. If box leaves are unavailable, add instead one ounce black tea.\n  \u2022 For Dandruff \u2013 Beat thoroughly one egg yolk, one pint of rain-water, and one ounce of rosemary spirit. Use warm and massage into scalp repeatedly.\n  \u2022 To Wash \u2013 Boil one pint of water with a handful of bran and a dash of white soap, and wash with this solution once every two weeks. Next, rub a beaten egg yolk into scalp and let it remain for several minutes before rinsing with warm water.\n  \u2022 To Maintain Healthy Hair \u2013 Brush 100 strokes twice a day, being sure to maintain a clean hair brush by washing it in warm water and bicarbonate of soda.\n  \u2022 In Between Washes\u00a0 \u2013 Add five sprigs of fresh rosemary to a pot of boiling water. Infuse until cold, drain liquid and add several drops of alcohol to preserve. Rinse hair weekly with mixture, being sure to massage scalp.\n  \u2022 To Prevent Hair Loss \u2013 Steep six ounces of boxwood shavings in twelve ounces of alcohol, at room temperature, for two weeks. Strain and add two ounces of rosemary spirits and two ounces of spirit of nutmeg. Rub into scalp morning and night.\n  \u2022 To Soften Hair \u2013 Beat four egg whites until frothy and apply to the roots of hair, leaving to dry. Wash clean with equal parts rum and rose water.\n  \u2022 For Growth-Inducing Pomade \u2013 Boil half a pound of green southern wood, a pint and a half of sweet oil, and half a pint of port wine. Strain and add two ounces of bear\u2019s grease.\n\nI haven\u2019t tried all of these nor, perhaps, should anyone but I can attest to using both egg and rosemary. Rosemary has natural astringent properties and, in between washes, I regularly use it on my scalp to keep oil at bay and promote growth. I also wash my brush every other day and brush my hair often, as the action helps redistribute the oils throughout the hair \u2013 a natural conditioner.\n\n* Note: It\u2019s really hard to wean yourself off of daily washing, I know. If you\u2019d like to give it a try, I suggest lengthening the time between washing as opposed to going cold turkey. When going cold turkey, your scalp doesn\u2019t realize you\u2019ve stopped abusing it and, thus, it still produces the same amount of oil. Try, instead, to wash every other day for a week, every three days for the next week, every four days, et cetera. Your scalp will rapidly adjust and you won\u2019t have to worry about going to school or work looking like a 50\u2019s greaser.",

        "text":"Can You Restore Lashes?\n\nA few months ago I received a sweet little surprise that I have been dying to try inside of my monthly beauty subscription box, Birchbox. It was the new Restorative Lash Treatment and Mascara by Ojon. It has been on my must-try list and I was considering purchasing this product just a few days before its surprise arrival. Can you say #Winning?\n\n\nJust in case you are wondering about the brand Ojon, let me spill the beauty tea! As you know, the air is filled with smoke, smog and pollution, which cause damage to the hair along with regular styling, the sun, diet and stress. Ojon\u2019s mission is to help you transform your hair to perfect health with their hair treatments formulated from a 500-year beauty secret from the remote regions of the rainforest in Central America. The key ingredient inside of the treatment is the golden elixir obtained from the nut of the Ojon tree.\n\nThe golden elixir is hand extracted precious oil with natural ingredients, which creates natural affinity for the hair to restore radiance, bounce and body. It also offers vibrancy to repair even the most damaged hair. The products are made with natural ingredients that are 100% essential oils. The products are made without parabens, mineral oils and other harmful ingredients.\n\nOkay, so now you know all about Ojon and their mission, let me give you the Glam it or Slam it and my final grade!\n\nThe Glam: This product\u00a0is pretty cool because it\u2019s multifunctional and we all know I love products that serve more than one purpose. It\u2019s a treatment on one side and mascara on the other. The treatment side conditions the lashes to give them life and yes, it did that. The conditioning treatment seemed to separate my lashes more than if I had applied mascara alone.\n\n\nWith Mascara (Brand X on\u00a0the left and Ojon on the right) \u00a0and Restorative Lash Treatment\u00a0\n\nThe Slam: The mascara side is supposed to offer long luscious come hither lashes but when I used it a few times, I got regular lashes and irritated eyes. The mascara side was a disappointment to say the least. Even with three coats, it was just blah. This was quite the disappointment because the conditioning side was nice. Boo\u2026Hiss\n\n\nNo mascara or Restorative Lash Treatment\n\nMy final grade for the Restorative Lash Treatment by Ojon is 3 out of 5 smooches\u2026MUAH. This multifunctional product is not so multifunctional after all. The conditioning side is good but the mascara, not so much. If I am going to pay $21 for mascara it better give me long, full luscious lashes that I can\u2019t live without and won\u2019t irritate my eyes plus the conditioning side should offer the benefit of growing my lashes\u2026IJS! If you are interested in trying this mascara, head over to and make your purchase at your risk\u2026LOL. Happy Shopping!\n\nClick here for reuse options!\nCopyright 2014 Beauty School ScArlet\n\nMy Beauty Play Date with Mary Kay\n\nLast week I had a makeup play date with my new favorite Mary Kay Consultant, Curtrice. I can\u2019t believe how much fun I had testing, trying and playing with the new colors and the Mary Kay at Play line. It\u2019s funny because I was not a huge Mary Kay fan because the brand did not appeal to me. I tried it years ago and it was just\u2026blah and it never occurred to me to try it again until I met a consultant by the name of Curtrice.\n\nDuring our makeup play date, she showed me the new colors, trends and the at play line. The colors are vibrant, fresh and exciting. The application was smooth, the eye shadows did not crease and the staying power was long lasting!!! I enjoyed the products so much that I purchased a few \ud83d\ude42\n\n\nMy favorite product so far has to be the Lash Love Mascara in Plum. It offers a different option to the normal black or brown colors. It helps my brown eyes sparkle just a little bit more and it extends the length just a little bit more.\n\n\nI also have a fondness for the Mary Kay at Play Eye Crayon in Purple Smoke. \u00a0It\u2019s a multifunctional product and we all know how much I love products that have 2 or more functions\u2026LOL. You can use this as a liner or smudge it into a shadow. The color is very soft purple with a hint of silver\/gray smoke. It glides on very easy and has great staying power.\u00a0 I liked it so much that I purchased 2 of them.\n\n\nI must say that I am pleasantly surprised with my Mary Kay products. I also purchased some skincare but I have not had a chance to try it out. But, when I do\u2026a review will be following!!! LOL. This just goes to show that even if a brand does not appeal to you or if you don\u2019t like a few products\u2026it doesn\u2019t mean the whole brand is not worth a try. If it were not for Curtrice, I don\u2019t think that I would have tried the products again. Thank you Curtrice for all of your help and excellent customer service!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for reuse options!\nCopyright 2013 Beauty School ScArlet\n\nProduct Review on Lights Camera Lashes by Tarte Cosmetics\n\nAre you looking for a new mascara???\n\nI am always nervous to try a new brand of mascara because I don\u2019t know what to expect. Will it clump, irritate my eyes or flake??? So when I recently ran out of my go to mascara, I had to talk myself into trying something new.\n\nOn one of my many journeys to Sephora, I asked a makeup specialist what would she suggest for someone who has allergies and sensitive eyes. She had 3-4 suggestions but Tarte Cosmetics was the brand I decided to purchase. I went with it because they are known as a high performance natural brand. Their products are made without all the things known as fillers that are no good!!! They are a cruelty free brand and they don\u2019t test on animals. I don\u2019t know about you but this sounds all good to me so I am ready to give them a try!!!\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s just say that I am totally smitten by the name alone and how clever it is. I love the unique packing of purple faux leather casing\u2026just adorable!!! But I digress because the real question here is\u2026did it work???\nHere\u2019s what I liked: It gave my lashes length that I have never experienced with any other mascara!!! I usually have to use 3-4 types of mascara to do the job of 1. As you can see, my lashes do not exists, so this gave me hope, faith and lashes\u2026LOL. It also curls, gives volume, defines and conditions. I have been using this mascara for over a month and I can honestly say that my lashes do not fall out as much and my eyes are not irritated. The best thing is that it can be easily removed with my makeup wipes.\nHere\u2019s what I didn\u2019t like: (insert crickets here) because I loved everything about it!!! My overall review if you have not guessed by now if 5 out of 5 smooches\u2026MUAH!!! Lights, Camera Lashes cost $19 and can be purchased at Sephora or\nFor advice and tips follow me on twitter @abeautyscarlet\n\nClick here for reuse options!\nCopyright 2013 Beauty School ScArlet",

I was in awe of the packaging and what it promised. To be a lipgloss\/lip treatment that feels cushioning on your lips while it still delivers color and high shine gloss.\n\nHere is the Skinny on the Color Elixir by Color Sensational from Maybelline:\n\nFall under the spell of the elixir effect\nHyper-saturated color, ultra cushiony feel\nThe new hypnotic lip sensation\n\nLook how the bottom looks like a Lipstick!\n\nThis lipgloss feels so good going on, it almost feels like a lip treatment. It feels like a lip gloss and treatment in one. It feels soft and very very cushiony. I think those truly are the best words to describe how it feels going on. The feeling does not go away quick either, it last for quite a while. It also leaves a very glossy looking effect to you lips. I only bought the Color Elixir in one color because I was not sure if it was going to deliver, but I will be definitely going back for more. There are 20 shades to chose from, which means 19 more for me to pick from and 20 for you. I will update this post once I purchase more with swatches of more colors. I decided to play it safe with the first color I picked and get a very pretty beige nude for the Fall. You can never go wrong with a beige nude.\n\nI love these types of applicators.\nThe really help with precision and getting right\nup into the cupids bow of your lip!\n\"60 Nude Illusion\" Swatched\nI had to get the right lighting to show the true color.\n\u00a0It looks a tad orange in the previous pictures!\nI had too many Lights on!\nUpdate: As promised, I went back for more shades and I would like to share them with you!! I definitely think they are worth the money and will be such a treat this winter! The winter and cold weather tends to dry out lips more often and I felt these were an investment in my lips. These Hybrid Lip Gloss\/Lip Balms will be just what I will be grabbing for in those harsh cold months!\n\nStill in Love with the Packaging!\n\nTop to Bottom: \"075 Fuchsia Flourish\" \"050 Caviar Couture\"\n\"100 Petal Plush\" \"045 Amethyst Potion\"\u00a0\nSwatched:\u00a0\u00a0\"075 Fuchsia Flourish\" \"050 Caviar Couture\"\n\"100 Petal Plush\" \"045 Amethyst Potion\"\u00a0\n\nVery Pigmented!! I love how these lip gloss\/balms look the same color in the tube on your lips!!\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI am so excited to share these with you. I think this lip gloss was a steal for under 8 dollars for all the benefits it includes and how good it feels on your lips. Please let me know if you have tried the Color Elixir and if you like them. I am loving them and I know your lips will love them too.\n\n\nSik Glam",

All I want to do is spend the day in my coziest pjs, wrapped up in a snuggly blanket with a cup of hot cocoa and binge watch Christmas movies on the Hallmark channel. Anybody else feel me? There really is nothing better than being nice and toasty inside when it\u2019s so cold outside! With the holidays looming, the never ending list of errands makes this cozy dream impossible. Leaving my house is inevitable, and while dealing with the frigid temperatures is a given, dressing in comfy cozy pieces makes it more bearable!\n\nWhen shopping for cozy pieces for around the house AND for going out, I always check the Topshop section at Nordstrom. Not only do they carry the cutest knits and outerwear, but they also have a great selection of cute pj sets and loungewear.\n\nMy favorite thing about winter break is spending lazy mornings around the house, before running errands in the afternoon. I love waking up, staying in my pjs and enjoying a cup of coffee while catching up on emails or wrapping presents. Enjoying a lazy morning is not something I get to do during the work week, and I can\u2019t tell you how much I enjoy it! After a lazy morning, I feel refreshed and relaxed and ready to take on the rest of the day! This pj set is one of my current favorites! I love that I can wear it year round and I can\u2019t get enough of the print! Paired with this cozy robe, I am all set for a lazy morning! Both of these pieces would make great Christmas gifts!\n\nWhen heading out to run errands and get lunch with E (another one of my FAVORITE winter break activities\u2026teachers don\u2019t get to go out to lunch during the work week!), I opt for cozy knits that will keep me warm. While I love layering up, I also love a cute sweater dress. It\u2019s one of my favorite ways to feel comfy and cozy all while feeling cute and put together! This sweater dress is SO warm! It\u2019s made of a thicker knit, so it\u2019s perfect for the winter! Styling tip\u2026pair your sweater dresses with over the knee boots in the winter.

        "text":"Hello friends! Today I\u2019m talking about the new Pacifica Crystal Matrix eyeshadow palette that I was lucky enough to win in an instagram giveaway. I\u2019m not usually a huge eyeshadow wearer, but I\u2019ve been getting much more interested in makeup lately so this came at just the right time. Have you seen this palette yet? It has 10 shades,\u00a0all of them with a shimmer finish (so you shine like a crystal, or something like that). I was a little iffy about the shimmer finish of them all, probably due to flashbacks of when I first started wearing makeup in high school and had no idea how to do it, and would usually top off my look with a mountain of glitter. Because, you know, mid 2000s fashion was\u00a0fantastic. (or not)\n\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\nAt first glance, this is a very cute lil palette. It\u2019s small and simple, which is good for someone like me who isn\u2019t looking anything too elaborate. I like the holographic crystals in the background, playing off of the whole unicorn-magic-beauty theme going on lately. There\u2019s a nice variety in the shades: several neutrals, a deep green, a few purples. It As I mentioned, all 10 shades have a shimmer finish, which is more apparent when applied to my eyes than it is in the swatches. The package describes this palette as \u201chighly pigmented mineral eye shadows in a range of your new super wearable favorite colors\u201d. Fair enough! These shades are pretty basic, but not boring.\n\nI love that the shadows are vegan and cruelty free, as well as formulated with pretty clean\u00a0ingredients (depending on how you view mineral makeup). This palette retails for 17.99.\n\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\n1. Affected 2. Spaced out 3. Faceted 4. Prism 5. Comet\n\n6.\u00a0Reflector\u00a07. Mars 8. Stolen Stars 9. Meteor 10. Ice\n\n\nWhen the package says highly pigmented, I expected it to be\u2026 well\u2026 highly pigmented. It is not. Even the deep green, dark brown, and plum colors, which appear pretty pigmented on the swatches, start to melt away once you begin to blend.\u00a0I had to layer a\u00a0lot\u00a0to get the following look, as the deep brown I was applying in my crease kept disappearing. My favorite shade is the white in the top left corner, which, when applied, actually is an iridescent pinky shade. It reminds me of a beautiful Mac shadow I used to use in high school for the same purpose (brightening the inner corners). I left this on for a few hours, but my eyes started to get itchy, so I removed it and didn\u2019t get to see how long lasting it is. This is my first time using mineral eyeshadow, so I\u2019m not sure if my eyes didn\u2019t like one of the ingredients, or if I possibly got a little too close on the lower lash line. I don\u2019t have a problem with mineral powder foundation, so it\u2019s hard to say.\n\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\nI ended up liking this more than I anticipated! It\u2019s a nice, natural look that I wouldn\u2019t feel too over-the-top for work. The shimmer finish didn\u2019t end up being too much, and the shades blended together nicely (if not a little too nicely, as the powder starts to disappear). As I mentioned, I did have to apply several layers before the color popped, but that just makes it a little easier to avoid overdoing it.\n\nI used the shade Faceted all over my lid, followed by Mars as a darker shade in the crease. Like I said, it kept melting away, so I ended up using the shade Spaced Out to deepen the outer corners of my eye. I went all over with Prism, then brightened the inner corners and under the brows with Comet.\n\n\nI don\u2019t love this palette, but there are a few shades I like enough to continue to use, namely Comet and Prism. If I hadn\u2019t received this, I probably wouldn\u2019t have purchased it, but I am happy I have it. If you\u2019re looking for a good basic palette for natural every day looks, I think this would probably be a great choice for you. If you\u2019re looking for something that really packs a punch, in pigment and colors, then probably not for you.\n\nPacifica Crystal Matrix Eye Shadow Palette Review & Look | Odessa Darling\n\n(I don\u2019t know what to do with my face in these photos, can you tell?)\n\nThanks for reading!

It was followed by some postpartum depression struggles, along with a false positive pregnancy test that I was told was called a \u201cchemical pregnancy\u201d.

        "text":"Tuesday, January 3, 2012\n\nFirst Experience: Eyelash Perm\n\nOut of curiosity, I decided to try Eyelash Perm, which is a process to permanently curl eyelashes.\n\nFirst of all, let me explain to you my obsession towards eyelashes. To me, curling lashes and applying mascara are like two sides of a coin. If I didn't get to do one of those, might as well not do it at all. Unfortunately, more often than not, my only option is to left my lashes bare because I don't have enough time to curl my lashes. And that's pretty much what leads me to try eyelash perm. I did the process at Dandis Beauty Care at Taman Anggrek.\n\nBasically the process is similar to hair perm, only in shorter time. The whole process takes about 45 minutes while I was lying down. First, to keep my lashes curled, the lady who did my lashes (I don't know what to call her. Anyone enlighten me, please?) roll my lashes and stick it to a white sticky rod. Like this picture below.\n\nExcuse the weird eye. I wasn't allowed to open my eyes so I had to peek through to take this picture.\n\nAfter that, she put the perming solution on my lashes using cotton pad and then I wait for fifteen minutes with cotton pad covering my eyes. The next step is to put neutral, again, all over my lashes. For the second step, I waited for ten minutes. I basically was just taking nap there.\n\nBy the way, while looking at my lashes, the lady told me that I have some broken eyelashes. She assumed it's from curling my lashes too harsh (Bingo!). Ugh! I didn't realized that. I'm a bit of a freak when curling my lashes, they have to be perfectly curled. I sometimes accidentally pull one or two strands of my lashes but I thought that was it and the rest was fine, apparently they're not. Gaahh!\n\nWell, back to eyelash perm. After about 45 minutes, I was done. My lashes felt sticky after the process because of the rod. That explains why the lashes on my picture above looks messy. Different than hair perm, you're allowed to wet your hair immediately after the process.\n\nThe lady told me to put on mascara, which I carried with me, immediately after the whole process. She also told me to put eyelashes serum. She offered one from Dandis but it was too expensive. So on my way home I dropped by at L'oreal counter and purchased L'oreal Renewal Serum at IDR 149k. The sales lady also offered me their Double Extension Renewal Serum Inside mascara as an addition for the eyelash care but I didn't think I need anymore mascara at the moment so I skipped. I expect this serum will fix my breakage problem. The lady who did my perm told me if I took care my lashes intensively, I'd get to fix my problem. So I have my fingers crossed with this serum.\n\nHere's the result, a day after the process.\n\nThis is my first time doing eyelash perm so I don't have any comparison. But I'm kinda disappointed with the result as it's not as curly as I expected. The process just gives me a little lift at the tip of my lashes but not really curled all the way to the root. Which is weird, because judging from the picture, looks like my lashes was already curled from the roots. Anyway, I'll still give it another chance though. I was advised to stay away from eyelash curler for a while until the curl went away. The perm will last for approximately one or two months and I'll probably come back at the third month. We'll see.\n\nIf you're interested in doing eyelash perm, the service is available at Dandis for IDR 200k.\n\n\nFifi said...\n\nVery informative post! I think the curl looks good and it must be nice not having to curl your lashes anymore before applying your mascara. Hehe.\n\nHave you tried eyelash extensions? I would love to get them done but I'm afraid they will ruin my natural lashes. From what I've seen they do look hot as they enhance the volume of the lashes significantly.\n\nMarcelle said...\n\nThanks Fi. It does look good with mascara on though it's doesn't completely meet my expectation. Guess I'll just have to settle with it for the next couple weeks.\n\nAnyway, eyelash extension doesn't really appeal to me.\n\nTemenku ada yang extension. Tapi agak2 ribet gitu, karena lama2 extensionnya memang bakal rontok. Dan kalo kita sering kucek2 mata, extensionnya bakalan lebih cepet rontok. Kayanya perawatannya agak2 high maintenance ya, mesti hati2 banget >__<\nI don't think I have patience to deal with that. If I did it, I'm pretty sure I'll ruin it.. :D\n\n13vyl looxperiments said...\n\nthanks for sharing, marcelle! duh, i might have broken lashes as well without realizing it.\n\ngotta love the time saving factor from having curled lashes though :D\nhope to hear further feedback after the 3rd week or so! :)",
