        "text":"MUA 'Pretty Pastels' Palette Review and EOTD\n\nPosted by on Friday, July 08, 2011\n\nI was totally pscyhed when I saw these MUA palettes and was lucky to recieve two to review. The first one I'm going to show you is called 'Pretty Pastels'. I find it's a really sort of 'spring' feeling\npalette for me - pretty much every spring time is all about pastel colours. I don't mind wearing pastels on the nails, but it's a bit of a new concept for my I don't really wear pastel shades as they usually just fade to white on me. I was hoping that these'd be different but...nope, sadly. Although I do quite like the light brown colour as a sort of brow highlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nWahey, it's like I'm staring at you a billion times. Feel free to be creeped out.\n\nUnfortunately, doing this EOTD was a bit of a pain in the arse, in all honesty. I think the amount of kaolin clay used in them made them chalky and hard to work with, and even worse wet (in large quantitites. They were good using a small amount as eyeliner). I'd apply some of the pink shade, go back to do the blue and find a lot of the pink had run out. Reapply and it all fell out over the blue shade. This took way longer than it should have.\n\n\n\nThese all contain a little shimmer\/micro glitter in them, which I found made them a bit tricky to remove as the glitter clung for dear life around my skin, even when swatching. Where I think I'll be using these is as liner for a pretty pastel (ignore the pun. I genuinely didn't plan it. Promise) pop of colour for looks and stuff. Wet a brush, dip into the colour and line away. Who knows, maybe next spring I'll be rocking these as liners...probably not as actual eyeshadows, however.\n\nAnyone picked up this particular palette?\n\n\n  1. You haven't sold them to me. They sound pretty rubbish. But you have to say it as you see it.\n\n  2. I don't like this palette much, especially when I compare it to what I'm used to from their single shadows. I wouldn't buy it myself.\n\n  3. Hmm they do look like very pretty colours and seem quite pigmented in the swatches you'v done but the chalkiness is pushing me away from trying it out myself.\n    Thanks for the review =]\n\n  4. I would love to get the glitter palette but this mua pro line is hard to get hold off.\n\n  5. OMG WOW @ the EOTD O_O Your eye make-up is SO stunning!!\n\n  6. Ugh, chalky eyeshadow is the worst. You did a great job with them though!\n\n  7. I can't fault the colours, Sara, but the formulation was a no-no for me :(\n\n    Are you in the UK, Beautyshades? If so, you can now order from Superdrug's website as a lot of instore stock seems to have sold out.\n\n    Ahaha, thanks Anna :P Nowhere near as pretty as yours though!\n\n    I know, ChaosButterfly :( The only thing that annoys me more than chalky eyeshadow is chalky, unpigmented matte eyeshadow. That makes me raaaage.\n\n    Thanks for your comments!\n\n\nHi! I'd love to hear from you :)\n\nPowered by Blogger.\n\nLiving Legends",

        "text":"\u2022 93,670 \/ 1,382,556\n  \u2022 20 \/ 9,867\n  \u2022 9,296 \/ 54,914\n\nTriple Helix Spiral\n\nIt all started here on BMEzine with a photo of a girl with triple helix spiral in her ear. I was fascinated by how it looked and I couldn't get it out of my mind.Since then I had been planning to get a triple helix spiral for about five months and had done a fair amount of research on local studios that did this piercing. I ended up with two studios in mind, Urban Piercing in Reading and Area 51 in Basingstoke. I had previously had my septum pierced at Urban Piercing and had a great experience there but I had heard great things about Area 51 and was curious. When I looked into Area 51's studio I found out that they had a half-price deal on wednesdays. Half-price piercing? My mind was made up, I was off to Area 51.\n\nI got on a bus with my boyfriend and went all through the countryside before getting off in Basingstoke and had lunch so that my blood sugar was nice and level. After about a half-hour of butterflies I found the studio and went in. They have a great range of body jewellery which I had a quick look at and then went up to the counter and asked for the piercing. I was given in the standard form to fill in - no I don't have any nasties in my blood, no I don't have a clotting issue etc. and signed on the line. No turning back, this was it! I paid a brilliant \u00a317.50 due to the half-price offer and the owner Duncan introduced himself as my piercer.\n\nI chose a 1.6mm purple titanium spiral which would be the target jewellery and we went into the back room. He gloved up and cleaned my ear first then marked the rough position to see if I was happy with it (it was spot on) and then marked the entry and exit points of the three twists on the spiral. Duncan then laid all the bits and pieces out (this place is cleaner than my local hospital by a long way) and got started. He did the three piercings without hanging around so it hurt less than expected but the last one made me flinch. I had previously picked out three sterile labrets which would be used until they had healed and then the spiral would be threaded through. As is always my luck I chose to have all three as purple labrets but he only had two left so I had to have a green one and two purples. As Duncan explained to me, having them heal as separate piercings would put less pressure on the whole area and if I knocked it by accident it wouldn't interfere with the other two holes.\n\nAfter Duncan cleaned me up he showed me the piercings and I was over the moon. The whole process from entering the room to leaving took a little over five miniutes and was very professional. I think that despite also having a great experience at Urban Piercing I will continue to go to Area 51. I now have to wait patiently and keep cleaning the piercings for at least another week before I can get the spiral threaded in but I am so excited to see the finished piece.\n\nOn the bus ride home I think I felt every bump in the rtoad as me ear was throbbing. Each time we drove over a bump I would wince and my very caring boyfriend found it very funny. I warn you now fresh piercings, public transport and rumble strip are never meant to go together!\n\nI have now been caring for my piercings for three weeks and they are a bit of a pain. Despite doing my best to lay on my left side I seem to roll over in my sleep. My ear is a bit sore now from sleeping on it which temporarily sets back the healing time. I'm not sure there is any real way to prevent this but I will keep up with my sea salt soaks and try and prop my head up on a pillow so I can't lay flat on the piercing. I know cartillage piercings are a real bitch to heal anyway but three together is pushing it a bit, for me anyway. I hope that in the next few weeks I will be able to thread the spiral in so that it can do the final bit of healing exactly in line.\n\nUpdate: It has been a week since I typed the last piece and I have managed to get the spiral in today with the help of a trusty insertion pin. It took a few goes and a fair amount of swearing as it is really fiddly to do without scraping the inside of the piercings. This has been one of my most complicated piercings so far but I think that in the end it was really worth it. It looks kick ass now!!\n\n\nsubmitted by: nymphetamine\non: 27 June 2010\nin Industrials and Orbitals\n\nUse this link to share:\n\nComments (1)\n\nadd a comment\n\nmiss victoria\nThursday, May 2, 2013 @10:30 p.m.\nHello dear, hope you are doing great, am miss Victoria but my friends call me Vicky i must say this i developed an interest on you immediately i view your profile and you are such a nice person which every human on earth will like to have as a friend and i was moved to let you know. please i will want you to writes on me via my e-mail (Victoriayak26@yahoo.com) i have something very vital in my private life to share with you i will tell you more about my self when you writes back at me on my e-mail box. and you will get my pictures too. i awaits your response; remember love has no boundaries kisses.\n\nBack to Top",

        "text":"Sunday, 21 February 2016\n\nSuperdrug Flirty Exotic Fruits and White Chocolate Body Spray\n\nFor Christmas I had asked for body sprays and perfumes because I was running seriously low on them and needed to stock up. I don't know about you, but I feel anxious going out without any on! One of the sprays I\u00a0received\u00a0was the Superdrug 'Flirty Exotic Fruits & White\u00a0Chocolate' body spray. Quite frankly I don't know what is so flirty about spray but I gave it ago nevertheless.\n\nThere are pros and cons to this body spray. One pro is that it does smell really nice! I'm not so sure about the 'exotic fruits' but the white chocolate really comes through in the smell which even my boyfriend noticed. I certainly don't mind smelling of chocolate! Another pro is the price: \u00a31.29, but currently at sale price of 63p! So if you are someone who is on a budget this is definitely handy.\n\nHowever, a big con is that the smell doesn't last very long. It probably lasts about an hour if that, which certainly doesn't make it a long lasting body spray. To keep up the smell you would have to reapply regularly throughout the day which won't help it last a long time. It lasted about a month for me but would have lasted a much less amount of time had I taken it out with me and reapplied throughout the day.\u00a0\n\nFor the cheap price tag and the fact that it is Superdrug's own brand and not a company specified in the field of body sprays, to be honest I wasn't expecting amazing results anyway. If you're looking for something that'll last you'll most likely have to go for a slightly higher price point. But overall if you're on a budget and need something to just carry around with you then this would be an option to consider.\u00a0\n\nWhat body sprays do you use?\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

They are a cosmetics company that sells fabulous products and gives a portion of their proceeds to aid in the stoppage of human trafficking. If you check out their website, there is a shop and there is a whole section designed to educate visitors on human trafficking.\nTheir mission statement (from their website):\u00a0Our mission is to help garner awareness for human trafficking by raising funds through cosmetics, to provide resources for those on the forefront of change, as well as victims of trafficking.\nThey donate a minimum of 20% of the profits from each purchase to various groups and charities supporting the stoppage of human trafficking. They also have a few suggestions if you'd rather donate directly to the charities. I thought this is a fabulous idea. We all know how much we spend on our beauty products. Why not buy a beauty item that can give back? :)\nRadiant Cosmetics are produced in the USA and are never tested on animals. Their paraben free makeup items\u00a0include\u00a0Lipsticks, Lip Glosses, Blushes, Mascara, and Mineral Foundation.\n\nI decided to pick up a few items and share them with you. The items pictured above are Radiant's moisturizing lipstick in Park Avenue and blush in Sunkissed.\n\n\u00a0Here is a pic of Park Avenue. Its a really deep red-fuschia shade. I really like it as its a daring shade for me. Sunkissed is also a great peach-bronze blush. It does give me that just in the sun look. I have both swatched on my wrist below. The pigmentation of each is quite good. I wore the lipstick out one day and never had to re-apply it.\u00a0\n\nLovelies, go check out Radiant Cosmetics. Pick up a lipstick and help fight human trafficking! Thank you Radiant Cosmetics for having Beauty with Heart!\n\nI purchased these products for review (and use!) and the thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nThanks for stopping by. I do love reading all your comments and try to respond to each and every one!\nThank you, Lovelies :D",

        "text":"June 30, 2010\n\nThe Dainty Petal is my Hair-Do Hero\n\nI am blessed to have a wonderful little girl. This little girl was born with a lot of hair, and by the time she was about two and a half, she really had a lot of hair.\n\nJust look at those long, gorgeous locks. This was when she was almost three.\n\nHowever she has always been what I like to call a 'free spirit', and never liked to be tied down with things such as clothing or hair-ties, clips, bows, etc. She also is not a big fan of sitting still long enough for me to do her hair.\u00a0\n\nOne of the problems is I'm not really skilled in the area of doing hair, so it always takes me longer that it should.\u00a0\n\nSo when she was almost three, I decided it would be nice to see a little more of her face more often and we went to get her first haircut. It was cute, but...\n\n...I kind of got a little sad every time I thought of those long, baby-fine, beautiful locks.\n\nBut then I would think of times like this and and the way she wouldn't leave a ponytail in her hair, and remember why it was probably better that her hair had been cut.\n\nMy little wild child is five now and her sitting-still skills have come a long way from when she was two or three. I figure it's about time that I improve my hair-doing skills as well.\u00a0\n\nFortunately, I have some help.\n\nAdopt a 'Do - Cute Girls Hairstyles\n\nMy friend sent me a link to this website the other day, and it has already proven to be very useful to somebody like me.\u00a0It's also helping my girl get more excited about having her hair done because she can look at the pictures or videos of the hair-do's and pick one that she wants me to try.\n\nBut I'm even more excited about another hair-do help I found out about recently.\n\n\u00a0My cousin Stefanie opened a shop called The Dainty Petal. She creates and sells the cutest hair-clips, headbands, and earrings. All of her items are handmade by her. I showed her website to my girl, and she was so happy. She had the cutest little smile on her face while we browsed through all of Stefanie's creations. I told her she could pick some out to buy. I believe that The Dainty Petal will be my hair-do hero. Not only has the shop already helped my girl become more excited about having her hair tamed by some cute hair accessories, but those accessories will also help my sometimes successful and sometimes not-so-successful attempts at doing hair look cute no matter what.\n\nNow I'm pretty sure only about two or three people read this blog, and I think you already know about The Dainty Petal, but if anyone else happens to read this post, make sure you go visit The Dainty Petal\u00a0and share it with your friends.\n\nAnd when you visit, you'll notice the website's cute design which was created by Stefanie's sister Hilary at Simply Yours. She creates the BEST custom blog designs, so make sure you check her site out too.\n\nI was thinking it was time to go do some hair now, but I just asked my girl if she wanted to pick out a hairstyle, and she reminded me that we did her hair yesterday, and she is just going to have a hairstyle every other day... so not today, but tomorrow. Oh well... baby steps. \u00a0She's adorable with crazy hair too.\n\n1 comment:\n\n  1. Love this Shay! This is why I am terrified of ever having a little girl.. I can't even do my own hair let alone a little girl's hair. Hopefully if I ever do get a girl, I will luck out with an adorable girl like yours so that it won't matter what the hair looks like. :)\n\n    Oh, and thanks for the plug. You are too sweet!",
