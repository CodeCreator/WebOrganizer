        "text":"Mailing List Code of Conduct\n\nBeta! ------- This policy is not finalized. Please send feedback and thoughts through a relevant OSI mailing list, or the OSI Contact Form. Introduction ------------------- The OSI's mailing lists aim to facilitate constructive discussion of issues related to open source and further the goals of the OSI. We can achieve this, in part, by behaving well towards each other, so that the broadest diversity of participants - both amateur and professional, new and experienced - feel that the lists are welcoming and useful. This code of conduct helps maintain that environment by capturing the conduct we aspire to when we participate in discussions at OSI. We Strive To: ------------- *Be friendly and patient* 1. We are volunteers, and so a sense of fun is part of why we do what we do. Be positive and engaging, rather than snarky. 2. If someone asks for help it is because they need it. Politely suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where appropriate. Avoid aggressive or vague responses. *Be civil and considerate* 1. Disagreement is no excuse for poor conduct or personal attacks. A community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive one. 2. If you would not feel comfortable saying something to a co-worker or acquaintance, it is probably not appropriate on an OSI list either. *Assume good faith* 1. Remember that licensing questions are often very complex and difficult to assess. If you disagree, please do so politely, by disputing logical errors and factual premises rather than by attacking individuals. 2. If something seems outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it. Ask for clarification, rather than assuming the worst. *Respect time and attention* 1. List members are often busy people. As a result, we value concision and clarity. Emails that are brief and to the point take more time to write, but are repaid many times over when other members of the list make the same effort. 2. Conversations should remain focused and on-topic. If you must change the topic, start a new thread by changing the topic line of your emails. Also, avoid flooding the list with long threads by reading the entire thread first, instead of responding quickly to many emails in a short period of time. 3. New members are welcome, but should be careful to respect the time and energy of long-time list members by doing research in FAQs and with search engines before asking questions. *Disclose potential conflicts* 1. List discussions often involve interested parties. We expect participants to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and disclose those interests to other project members. 2. When in doubt, over-disclose. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address, so that the lists\u2019 decisions are credible even when unpopular, difficult or favorable to the interests of one group over another. Interpretation -------------- This code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter. Enforcement ----------- Most members of the OSI community always comply with this code, not because of the existence of the code, but because they have long experience participating in open source communities where the conduct described above is normal and expected. However, failure to observe the code may be grounds for reprimand, probation, or removal from the lists. If you have concerns about someone\u2019s conduct: * *Direct contact*: it is always appropriate to email a list member, mention that you think their behavior was out of line, and (if necessary) point them to this document. * *On-list*: discussing conduct on-list, either as part of another message or as a standalone thread, is always acceptable. Note, though, that approaching the person directly can be better, as it tends to make them less defensive, and it respects the time of other list members, so you probably want to try direct contact first. * *Moderators*: You can reach the list moderators (Luis Villa and Karl Fogel) through the addresses they use for on-list communication. Further Context --------------- Other resources, while not formally part of this code of conduct, can provide useful context and guidance for good behavior. 1. Chapter 6 of Producing OSS, by OSI board member Karl Fogel, describes common best practices for mailing list participation, particularly [\u201cYou Are What You Write\u201d]( and [\u201cAvoiding Common Pitfalls\"]( 2. [RFC 1855](, particularly section 2.1.1 (\u201cUser Guidelines for mail\u201d), also provides useful guidelines for sending good emails. 3. [The Ubuntu Code of Conduct]( provides useful guidance for group leaders. This policy was inspired by [the GNOME Code of Conduct](, [the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](, [the Ubuntu Code of Conduct](, and other codes listed at [the OpenHatch list of project codes of conduct]( [Comment\/Improve.]",

In this article, Jurgen Appelo, author of Management 3.0: Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders, describes the scientific reason to empowering people in the first of his two-part series.\nLike this article? We recommend\n  \u2022 It is said that power corrupts, but actually it\u2019s truer that power attracts the corruptible. The sane are usually attracted by other things than power.\n  \u2022 David Brin, scientist, author (1950-)\n\nManagers are authorized by shareholders to grow the business and hire other people (and other managers). But to make the best use of self-organization in their business, they need to distribute control and delegate their authority. This article, the first in a two-part series, describes the scientific reason to empowering people, the seven levels of authority, and the \u201cauthority board\u201d as a simple mechanism to delegate control to self-organizing teams.\n\nAnarchy Versus Governance\n\nAgile software development is a great success because it works through self-organizing teams. Self-organization is a lot like anarchy, which some people think is a bad thing. But agilists are \u201cbenevolent anarchists.\u201d In Agile software development, anarchy is applied in a good way.\n\nThe word anarchy stems from the Greek word anarcho. It means \u201chaving no ruler.\u201d People use the word in two situations:\n\n  \u2022 Absence of order (presence of disorder)\u2014in other words, chaos.\n  \u2022 Absence of imposed (top-down) order\u2014in other words, complexity.\n\nThis is depicted in Figure 1. Governance, the presence of top-down order, stretches from complexity into order. And anarchy, the absence of governance, stretches from complexity into chaos.\n\nFigure 1 Governance versus anarchy\n\nSome people believe that anarchy equals chaos. But nature is anarchistic, and yet ecosystems are complex, not chaotic. And traffic in Brussels is anarchistic. But the daily flows of traffic are complex, not chaotic. Likewise, a well-functioning Agile team is also complex, not chaotic.\n\nManagers are authorized by shareholders to grow a successful business. For managers, the challenge is to make sure that the \u201canarchistic teams\u201d behave in a way that is valuable to all stakeholders.\n\nI often compare managers to gardeners (Figure 2). An unmanaged garden is typically full of weeds, not beauty. From a biological perspective, there\u2019s no difference. Either way, the ecosystem in the garden is self-organizing. It takes a gardener (authorized by the owners of the garden) to turn an anarchistic garden into something that the owners will enjoy. Likewise, it takes a manager (authorized by shareholders) to steer self-organizing teams in a direction that delivers value to the shareholders.\n\nFigure 2 The gardening metaphor\n\n  \u2022 + Share This\n  \u2022 \ud83d\udd16 Save To Your Account\n\nInformIT Promotional Mailings & Special Offers\n\nI would like to receive exclusive offers and hear about products from InformIT and its family of brands.

        "text":"Privacy Policy for App\n\nPrivacy Policy is a critical issue that every app developer must address. Also, there are an increasing number of jurisdictions that now have legal requirements regarding privacy practices. If the app developed by you using the SDK of LG Developer site collects and processes the personal and non-personal information of end users, please follow these guidelines. You also must comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to data protection and privacy.\n\nCollection Limitation and Security\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid security compromises of personal information is not to collect the information in the first place unless your app has a specific and legitimate reason for the collection. So, here are the brief privacy tips for designing and developing apps.\n\n- Minimize your data collection in the first place.\n- Develop your app to protect the security of your user's data in its collection, storage, and use.\n- Make your use of social features transparent, if any, so that users are aware of when they're sharing data socially.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nYour app should include a privacy policy that addresses topics such as what kind of information your app collects from or about your users, how that information is used, with whom it is shared, and how users can make privacy-related choices within the app. You should use plain language and avoid technical jargon, to help your end users understand easily. You should provide a mechanism for obtaining end user consent to the collection and processing of their information in accordance with the user\u2019s privacy policy before the collection of any such information. If possible, provide a control mechanism that allows a user to easily change permissions. You should not collect any information from end users (whether personal or otherwise) unless the appropriate consents have been given.\n\nCollection of Sensitive Information\n\nAn app's collection of sensitive personal information raises important privacy concerns. You should only collect access and use end user\u2019s information to the extent necessary for providing the app. The minimized and indispensable data collection will be preferred to avoid any needless troubles, problems or issues of compliances. After the information collection, put in place appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to secure and protect end user information. Please note that LGE is entitled to legal immunity on your app\u2019s privacy policy issues that caused any claims, suits, losses, damages, costs and expenses.",

        "text":"OAuth 2.0 Policies\n\nLast modified:\n\nThe applications and services you design and build with Google APIs must do more than provide value to users and businesses. We also require that they be secure and provide the appropriate level of privacy demanded by users. The following policies are part of the Google APIs Terms of Service. They apply to all developers who use OAuth 2.0, which includes OpenID Connect for authentication only. The policies below are a minimum set of requirements; we recommend that you take any additional steps necessary to ensure that your applications and systems are safe and secure.\n\nComply with all terms of service and policies\n\nThe use of Google API Services, which includes our implementation of OAuth 2.0, is governed by the Google APIs Terms of Service and Google API Services User Data Policy. In addition, the use of OAuth 2.0 is governed by this policy. Please read these documents carefully, as well as any other terms or policies that apply to any other Google products or services you are using. Be sure to check for updates periodically as these documents are occasionally updated.\n\nRegister an appropriate OAuth client\n\nEvery app that uses Google's OAuth 2.0 infrastructure for authentication or authorization must have at least one registered OAuth client. You must create a separate OAuth client for each platform on which your app will run, such as a web server, an Android app, an iOS app, or a limited-input device. You must choose the client type that best matches the platform. For instance, you should not use a \"web\" client type for your native Android or iOS app. You can register OAuth clients in the Google API Console. Please note that additional terms apply to your use of the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nIf you use Apps Script, OAuth clients are automatically created on your behalf, and you are still subject to the policies on this page. If you need to modify or manage your OAuth clients, you must switch your script project to a standard Cloud project.\n\nSome Google development platforms, such as Firebase and Actions on Google, automatically create Google Cloud projects and OAuth clients on your behalf. If you develop on these platforms, you are still subject to the policies on this page.\n\nUse separate projects for testing and production\n\nFor the purposes of these requirements, a \"production\" app meets the following criteria:\n\n  \u2022 It isn't for personal use. An app is considered to be for personal use if it's not shared with anyone else or will be used by fewer than 100 people (all of whom are known personally to you).\n  \u2022 It isn't used for development, testing, or staging.\n  \u2022 It isn't for internal use; that is, restricted to people in your Google Workspace or Cloud Identity organization.\n\nSome policies and requirements only apply to production apps. For this reason, you must create separate projects in the Google API Console for each deployment tier, such as development, staging, and production.\n\nMaintain a list of relevant contacts for the project\n\nProject owners and editors must be kept up-to-date. We'll send emails to those accounts when there are notifications about your project or updates to our services. Organization administrators must ensure that a reachable contact is associated with every project in their organization. If we don't have updated contact information for your project, you might miss out on important messages that require your action. This could result in the loss of your access to the Google APIs.\n\nGoogle Workspace users: Associate your project with an organization\n\nAt this time, your projects aren't required to exist within a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity Organization resource. However, you're strongly recommended to create new projects in an organization and migrate existing projects into an organization. This configuration allows your project to benefit from enterprise management including intra-domain usage. It can also prevent your project from becoming orphaned if the current project owner leaves your organization.\n\nHandle client credentials securely\n\nTreat your OAuth client credentials with extreme care, as they allow anyone who has them to use your app's identity to gain access to user information. Store your OAuth client information in a secure place and protect it, especially your client secret, just as you would a password. Where possible, use a secret manager, such as Google Cloud Secret Manager, to store client credentials. You must never commit client credentials into publicly available code repositories. We highly recommend that you avoid committing them to any code repository.\n\nHandle user tokens securely\n\nOAuth 2.0 tokens are entrusted to you by users who give you permission to act and access data on their behalf. Never transmit tokens in plaintext, and always store encrypted tokens at rest to provide an extra layer of protection in the event of a data breach. Revoke tokens when you no longer need access to a user's account or when your app no longer needs access to permissions that a user previously granted. After the tokens are revoked, delete them permanently from your application or system.\n\nAccurately represent your identity\n\nProvide a valid name and (optionally) a logo to show to users. This brand information must accurately represent the identity of the application. App branding information is configured when you set up OAuth 2.0 in the Google API Console Consent Screen page.\n\nFor production apps, brand information must be verified. Google can revoke or suspend access to Google API Services and other Google products and services for apps that misrepresent their identity or attempt to deceive users.\n\nIf you use Apps Script and want to verify your brand information, you must switch your script project to a standard Cloud project. If you use a Google development platform that manages OAuth clients on your behalf, such as Firebase or Actions on Google, your app settings there are used to configure your brand information. However, you must still use the Google API Console to submit your brand information for review.\n\nOnly request scopes that you need\n\nYou must only request the smallest set of scopes that are necessary for providing functionality knowingly chosen by the user. You must request scopes that require the least amount of access to user data necessary to provide that functionality. For example, an app that only uses Gmail APIs to occasionally send emails on a user's behalf shouldn't request the scope that provides full access to the user's email data. Data that you receive from Google APIs must only be used in the way that you represent to your users.\n\nYour project configuration in the Google API Console Consent Screen page must match the list of scopes requested by your app. When a change in app functionality or in Google APIs necessitates an update to the scopes that are used, you must revoke the tokens with the previously-used scopes that are no longer in use at the earliest opportunity and update your project configuration in the Google API Console. Proper configuration is particularly important for scopes that require verification; if an app is no longer approved to use them, Google may revoke tokens that contain these scopes at any time without notice.\n\nIf you use Apps Script, the OAuth client that's automatically created for you is configured to use the scopes that Apps Script identifies from your script. If your script requires different scopes, you must specify these scopes explicitly in your script's manifest file.\n\nSubmit production apps that use sensitive or restricted scopes for verification\n\nCertain scopes are classified as \"sensitive\" or \"restricted,\" and they can't be used in production apps without review. If your production app uses sensitive or restricted scopes, you must submit your use of those scopes for verification. You can submit for verification in the Google API Console from the Consent Screen page.\n\nIf you use Apps Script and you're writing a production script that uses sensitive or restricted scopes, you must switch your script project to a standard Google Cloud Platform project before you submit your use of those scopes for verification.\n\nOnly use domains you own\n\nOnly use redirect URIs and JavaScript origins that refer to domains that you own, that you have been authorized to use (for example, as part of your employment or as a vendor or contractor of a business), or that you have been explicitly given license to use (for example, as part of a service agreement for an identity management platform).\n\nHost a homepage for production apps\n\nEvery production app that uses OAuth 2.0 must have a publicly accessible home page. The homepage must include a description of the app's functionality, as well as links to terms of service and a privacy policy. The homepage must exist on a verified domain under your ownership.\n\nUse secure browsers\n\nA developer must not direct a Google OAuth 2.0 authorization request to an embedded user-agent under the developer's control. Embedded user-agents include, but are not limited to, software libraries that allow a developer to insert arbitrary scripts, alter the default routing of a request to the Google OAuth server, or access session cookies. All browsing environments must allow the user to verify the current connection to the Google OAuth server including the requested URI and connection security information.\n\nUse secure JavaScript origins and redirect URIs\n\nOAuth 2.0 clients for web apps must use redirect URIs and JavaScript origins that are compliant with Google\u2019s validation rules, including using the HTTPS scheme. Google may reject OAuth requests that don't originate from or resolve to a secure context.\n\nWhen you obtain consent for multiple scopes, a user might choose to grant one or more requested scopes or deny the request. If a user doesn't grant a scope that you requested, you need to disable any related functionality in your app and not make any related API calls tha... (truncated)",

Finding it difficult to manage code changes from multiple developers? TortoiseSVN is an excellent tool that may help solve many of your configuration management problems, as Stephen B. Morris explains.\nLike this article? We recommend\n\n\"Who Broke the Build?\"\n\nThe question above is heard often in large software development projects. In the old days (2\u20133 years ago), breaking the build was all too easy because many companies had just a single mainline code branch. In such setups, developers made changes locally, tested, and then checked the new code into the main line. Forgetting to check in one part of a change could break the main line for everyone except the single developer who made the change!\n\nNowadays, things are a lot more stable, as most organizations embrace more sophisticated repository usage policies; for example, using task branches. This trend is also due in no small part to the adoption of test-driven and test-oriented development. With these practices, software is subjected to fairly rigorous unit testing and integration testing before submission into the repository. Tools such as Subversion help a lot in ensuring that all the required changes are checked in successfully. This, in turn, helps in avoiding the problem of a broken build.\n\nAs I\u2019ll discuss shortly, TortoiseSVN provides some useful tools for forensic testing of build breakages. However, it\u2019s important to remember that even with the best will in the world and the most rigorous check-in policies, it\u2019s always possible to break the build. One example is when some changes are not fully checked into the repository\u2014developer X makes five changes and checks in only four changes. Subversion helps to avoid this class of problem in the way the client software manages all changes to the working copy. However, Subversion isn\u2019t foolproof. Suppose I create a new class file and forget to call the command svn add. Subversion won\u2019t know about the new file, even if I instantiate the class elsewhere in my code. In other words, I\u2019ve just broken the build.\n\nThe area of Subversion clients is rich in offerings. You can use the basic command line if you\u2019re a text kind of person. Many developers prefer to use a graphical solution; the Eclipse plug-in (called Subclipse) is a good example. Each approach has its merits, but in my opinion TortoiseSVN combines the benefits of both approaches into a single solution. You get the fine-grained control of the command line as well as a more intuitive GUI perspective. However, in computing nothing is free, and you may find that the use of TortoiseSVN adds some overhead to your machine. Loss of performance as a result of using TortoiseSVN is one of the small downsides to this technology.\n\nAside from the potential for a performance impact, I like the fact that TortoiseSVN works right out of the box. Once you install it, you can start to use it immediately, with no need for any complicated configuration.\n\n  \u2022 + Share This\n  \u2022 \ud83d\udd16 Save To Your Account\n\nInformIT Promotional Mailings & Special Offers\n\nI would like to receive exclusive offers and hear about products from InformIT and its family of brands.
