        "text":"Finding Some Network Marketing Tips And Information\n\nSome people are passionate and excited about the newness of network marketing. For some, network marketing is a much-needed source of income. If you are willing to dedicate yourself and remain focused, it is possible to bring in a steady income.\n\nMany think that quantity will result in more sales in network marketing; however, it has been proven that quality beats quantity every time. It is to your benefit to have individuals that are able to cultivate their own downline so that they are creating profits for the whole network.\n\nIf you have a unique and different niche you might not know who to market to or know where to find the people who might be interested. Give your idea a fighting chance by presenting it to potential customers.\n\nWork on building an email database for current and future use when building a network marketing business. Regardless of whether you buy the list or use comments from your site, you should have a very large list if you want to grow your profits.\n\nBe someone who is revered in network marketing. Use your creativity to create a campaign that stands out. Using an original approach will attract attention and your competitors might try imitating you \u2013 which will just remind people of your campaign. Don\u2019t copy someone else, try creating your own niche.\n\nConsider structuring your network marketing website as a learning tutorial. Providing clear, easy-to-follow tutorials and how-tos can boost traffic and encourage visitors to spend more time perusing your site. Both of these things increase the chance of picking up new members for your network, as well as increasing your advertising revenue.\n\nWhen coming up with content for your marketing website, don\u2019t be afraid to try new things. All of your marketing media can use this boost. Be sure to hit every point.\n\nYour marketing strategy must focus on upholding the values and business qualities that have made other distributors\u2019 leadership management so successful. If you can mimic their successful thought processes, then you can borrow on their success.\n\nGet some people to come to your website! This is no easy task, but getting it done can mean the difference between success and failure in network marketing. Once you have lured a viewer to your page, you have a better opportunity to sell your products, and make this person aware of just how valuable your service is to him or her.\n\nNetworking marketing is a business. One common pitfall is to treat network marketing lightly. With the right amount of effort, network marketing could become a very successful, full-time job. Research before you begin and, if you need to, take training courses online or locally.\n\nCustomers love feeling like they got a great deal. When choosing a company for your network marketing venture, try to find one that issues coupons that you can pass on to your potential buyers. You can use coupons in different ways. You could give them to preferred customers or as a prize for a raffle. The reduction in price and feeling of inclusion is enough to make most people proceed with the purchase.\n\nKeep an eye on the clock. It is easy to become distracted when you are using the internet. Keep a schedule and use that schedule to stay on task.\n\nYour team should hold regular meetings. If everyone is supposed to stick together and help each other, then they need to be meeting, coming up with a game plan, and working as a team towards goals. Your team needs to meet so it can work together to do it\u2019s best.\n\nParticipating in internet forums is a great way to become better at network marketing. You can find tips from experienced users here, without having to pay for their advice. Search for a forum which matches the business you\u2019re in or is just generally about network marketing, and spend some time there daily learning all you can.\n\nWith all the different marketing channels out there these days, there is no excuse for hitting a snag in your marketing efforts. There are always going to be new businesses, people and ideas out there on the web trying to get their piece of the pie. Those who are able to follow these tips and others like them will be the ones to succeed.",

        "text":"How You Can Start Selling Online\n\nHow You Can Start Selling Online\n\nIf you came to this post looking for the inside scoop on online shops, we\u2019ve got some bad news: we aren\u2019t going to be talking about them. You won\u2019t find any mention of plug-ins or sale prices. You won\u2019t even find sales strategy mentioned on this page. Why? Because selling online starts way before any of that.\n\nSelling a product or even a service online isn\u2019t about having an online shop, running a sale, or even advertising your products on a Facebook business page. Selling online\u00a0starts with having something worth purchasing. You need a product or a service that people don\u2019t even know they want yet. You need a product or service so remarkable that people can\u2019t say no to it.\n\nHow do you get to that point? For starters, you need to know your market, your story, and where first impressions actually happen.\n\nThree Things to Know Before Selling Online\n\nSolve a challenge for a niche group.\n\nBefore you start developing a marketing strategy, researching product design, or even reaching out to potential customers, you need to understand that selling is all about solving challenges. And, when it comes to starting something new, you need to be targeting the right buyers. In his book, All Marketers Are Liars, Seth Godin theorizes that there isn\u2019t one market, but millions of markets. When you\u2019re starting out, you need to know which of those millions of markets you\u2019re talking to.\n\nIn order to be successful at selling online, you need to target a niche group. The masses are already solving their challenges with another product and most likely won\u2019t be responsive to the change you\u2019re bringing to the market. The niche group though, the ones on the outskirts of the masses, are going to be more receptive to the change.\n\nGo after that group. Understand that group. Make that group your people. If they love you and your product, they\u2019ll spread the word.\n\nCreate a story worth sharing.\n\nBefore your product, idea, or service can spread, you have to create a story worth sharing. That niche market you want to be a part of needs to feel connected to who you are and what you\u2019re doing. They have a set view of the world and you aren\u2019t going to change that. What you can do is frame your story in a way that appeals to them.\n\nIn creating your story, you need to do everything in your power to remain authentic. If you start telling a story that isn\u2019t true, then the market you are trying to reach, won\u2019t buy into the story. When no one buys into the story, no one shares it.\n\nYour story needs to be true to who you are as a brand.\n\nDesign everything to be a first impression.\n\nWhen does a first impression actually happen?\n\nThat\u2019s a trick question because we\u2019ll never actually know. In website design, we\u2019d like to say it\u2019s the home page or maybe a specific product\/service page. The truth is, though, the first impression can happen on any page or even long before a potential customer discovers your website.\n\nThat means, everything you design, write, create, publish, or are a part of has the potential to be the first impression. No one likes to admit it, but we do judge a book by its cover. If the cover isn\u2019t appealing, we won\u2019t pick it up. That first impression needs to be authentic, yes, but it also needs to be impressive. Every piece of your brand (your product\/service, messaging, logo, website, flyers, employees) needs to present the same, united message.\n\nGetting started with your strategy before selling online.\n\nIt all comes down to having the right strategy. You need to know where and when to connect with your target market before you start selling online. The team at Iconic Digital loves helping businesses, established and startup, figure out the different moving pieces of the puzzle. We\u2019ll talk about your product or services, how they benefit your customers, and what exactly your story is. From there, it\u2019s all about creating the right image, message, and brand.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Let\u2019s talk!\n\nThe following two tabs change content below.\n\nJason Hutcheson\n\nA hard working, scrappy entrepreneur with a passion for helping others succeed by mixing sales technique, creative design, and digital marketing into a potent cocktail of awesome sauce.\n\nLatest posts by Jason Hutcheson (see all)",

        "text":"You have a great idea, a smart business plan, and even a good target market. It seems like the sky's the limit for what your startup company can achieve. Unfortunately, the only thing your startup lacks is capital.\n\nFundraising using investors can be time-consuming, tiring, and take you away from the core of your business. This is why some entrepreneurs are blazing their own path and using their own savings as funding. Using the IRS\u2019s ROBS program, or Rollovers as Business Startups, company founders can roll their 401(k) into startup capital.\n\n\u201cWhen launching Ascendify, we wanted to devote our time to building an innovative product that would transform the recruiting industry, and not let anything (like fundraising) distract us from those goals,\u201d said Lauren Smith, co-founder of the talent acquisition platform. \u201cSo, for our first round, we decided to skip the more traditional investor route and invest in ourselves instead.\u201d\n\nI had honestly never heard of ROBS before, but after some research, I discovered using ROBS to fund your startup is tricky and won\u2019t be the right choice for every fledgling company. To get an idea of best practices, I spoke with Smith about how they succeeded using ROBS at Ascendify:\n\nHave a solid business plan\nAs dicey as it can be to start a new company from scratch, now you\u2019re getting your retirement savings involved. If your company goes under, you can say goodbye to the savings invested in your startup. This is why it\u2019s essential to have a solid business plan before rolling over your funds.\n\nMake sure you believe in your product, company, or service and be very honest with yourself about the likelihood of success.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to Ascendify, we saw a need in the marketplace for our talent acquisition platform and we\u2019ve since won industry awards for our product,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe felt confident the business would succeed and this confidence came from a realistic view of our market.\u201d\n\nHaving an established business plan helps you navigate more effectively, which is probably why 60 percent of businesses launched with ROBS funding in 2010 were franchises.\n\nDon\u2019t do it on your own\nAs an entrepreneur, you might be tempted to start traveling the road to ROBS funding alone. This isn\u2019t a good idea, due to the complexity of these rollovers. While you can avoid the penalties and fees usually associated with withdrawing your 401(k) early, you\u2019ll want someone who understands complicated IRS tax law.\n\nThe mechanism allowing for rollovers is called the ERISA, or Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. This act allows workers to be in charge of their own destinies, at least where their retirement plan is concerned. Like most tax laws, the ERISA is extremely complicated -- meaning it\u2019s easy to step out of line by accident. If you want to avoid an audit or hefty fees, you\u2019ll want to bring in the experts to keep you on track.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure we were IRS compliant, and following the letter of the law,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo we partnered with Benetrends because they understand the ins and outs of tax laws, having implemented these funding programs for over 30 years.\u201d\n\nOffer stock options\nCompliance with regulations is a big part of successfully using ROBS to start your business. You certainly don\u2019t want to run afoul of the established rules, since the IRS can be real sticklers. For instance, a prohibited transaction can set your company back 110 percent or more in penalties.\n\nOffering stock options to employees is a good way to maintain compliance. Many startup companies would initially offer stock until ROBS funding was approved. Then the stock options would disappear. This practice is prejudicial against new and less highly-compensated employees. So, you\u2019ll want to offer your workers stock options to find great talent for your company and stay compliant in the process.\n\nConsider profit sharing\nUsing ROBS means taking your existing 401(k) and rolling it over into a newly established retirement plan for your company. When it comes to this new retirement plan, you can either decide to offer employees a robust 401(k) or a simple profit sharing plan. If you go down the profit sharing path, know that you\u2019re not locked into sharing every year in which you\u2019re profitable.\n\n\u201cAt Ascendify, we offer profit sharing because we realize that these types of employee benefits are critical to attracting top talent in Silicon Valley,\u201d Smith said.\n\nOffering these perks, whether it\u2019s 401(k) matching or profit sharing, can be a great tool for luring the talent your company needs. You need to scoop up great candidates before your competition, and for startups, it\u2019s even more important to hire the right people. Offering some perks to sweeten the deal is a great way to get this talent interested in your new company.\n\nThese tips are useful if you\u2019ve decided to use ROBS funding to kickstart your startup. This program won\u2019t be right for every new company, but if you decide to invest in yourself, it may be worth the risk.\n\nHave you used the ROBS program for startup funding? Do you have some tips to share in the comments?",

        "text":"Monday, 10 April 2017 14:17\n\nHow to Calculate Late Payment Costs\n\nNot being paid on time is one of the biggest worries facing small business owners. Trying to recover outstanding debts can feel like a very lonely process if you are not aware of the help available.\n\nOne important thing to remember is this - as a creditor, the law is on your side. Since 1998, UK businesses have been legally entitled to charge interest on overdue payments owed by another company.\n\nThe UK was the first country in the EU to pass such a law, and has led the way on promoting fair and equitable payment practices ever since. In 2013, the legislation was strengthened further to allow businesses to charge debtors for costs incurred for debt recovery. In practice, this means that hiring a debt recovery agency is essentially free to the creditor if the debt is recovered along with the additional late payment penalties.\n\nSo what are the rules for charging late payment penalties? How do you calculate the interest, and what restrictions are there?\n\nKnowing When to Charge\n\nAccording to the late payments legislation, a bill is considered overdue the day after the agreed credit period ends, or if no terms are explicitly agreed between the parties, by default 30 days days after the invoice has been issued.\n\nIn practice, most businesses come to an agreement between themselves on payment terms, which is acknowledged in the law. Private businesses can agree terms of up to 60 days. If they want to extend this, there has to be express agreement from both sides that they consider this fair and any extended credit must not be \u201cgrossly unfair to the creditor\u201d. Although the legislation itself stops short of actually specifying what constitutes grossly unfair.\n\nCalculating Interest\n\nThe interest you are allowed to charge on late payments is calculated by statutory interest, which is 8 per cent plus whatever the current Bank of England base rate is for business transactions. So if the current base rate is 0.5 per cent, that means you can charge interest at 8.5 per cent.\n\nThat is the annual rate, or the interest you would charge if a customer did not pay for whole year. To work out the actual rate for however long the debt remains unpaid, the best thing to do is to calculate a daily rate. To do this, find 8.5 per cent of the total debt and divide by 365:\n\nDaily Interest = (Total Debt x 0.085)\n\nEach day the client does not pay, that daily interest owed is added on.\n\nClaiming Costs\n\nBusinesses chasing late payments are legally entitled to claim \u2018reasonable costs\u2019 for recovery from the debtor. This includes any fees paid for assistance from debt recovery specialists. In addition, since 2013, companies have also been able to charge a fixed fee for late payment by way of compensation. The rates are as follows:\n\n\u00a0Outstanding Amount\n\nFixed Penalty Fee\n\n\u00a0Up to \u00a3999.99\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a31000 to \u00a39999.99\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a310,000 and over\n\n\nYou can get our free late payment calculator app for both iOS and Android phones by visiting our site or by searching for \u201cSafe Collections\u201d on your app store.\n\nHow to Claim Penalties\n\nThere is no obligation on the part of suppliers to notify customers of their intention to charge interest for late payments, although many choose to refer to their statutory rights in their terms and conditions.\n\nPenalties, including all interest, costs and fixed sums for compensation, are only charged once, i.e. at the point when the debt is settled. In practice, once you receive agreement to pay, or the original debt is paid off, you would need to issue another invoice detailing the additional charges payable. Remember VAT is not applicable on either the interest or fixed cost element of the penalties and must not be charged.\n\nOver 150 Years Of Industry Experience\n\nOur modest but highly skilled team has a combined total of over 150 years of experience in commercial credit management and B2B debt collection.

When you are trying to live off of your investments, you want some stability in your monthly income. You do not want to be living comfortably one month and scraping to get by the next.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Choose annuities: Selecting investments based on the annuity payment is a good way to provide some stability in your portfolio. When you have a regular payment coming in from your stock or bond, you will be able to budget accordingly.\n  \u2022 Invest 10%: Make it a habit to invest at least 10% of your paycheck towards your retirement. In the beginning you may feel a little pinched, but won't feel it after a while. This investment approach can make a sizable difference in your lifestyle after retirement.\n  \u2022 Consider other investments: There are plenty of investments out there that will provide you a regular income besides stocks and bonds.

        "text":"Skip to content\n\nAnother employee absence... I'm in need of HR advice!\n\nAnother employee absence...      I'm in need of HR advice!\n\nManaging absences can be tricky, so here are some of our tips on managing absence in your company:\n\n\n1. Make sure that everyone understands the rules\nThe best piece of HR advice is to set up a procedure for absence management before it becomes an issue. We write Absence Policies for our HR Advice Line clients to ensure staff know how to report their absence, how much they will be paid (SSP or company enhanced sick pay) and how the company will deal with persistent short term absence or long term illness.\n\nThis makes it easier to apply the policy consistently and ensure that you are fair in your dealings with absent staff.\n\n2. Monitor absence\nManagers should be given the responsibility of monitoring their own team\u2019s absences and conducting return to work interviews with staff on the day they return. Return to work interviews have been proven to reduce short term absences as staff know they will meet with their manager to discuss their illness. However, they also help spot trends or work related issues which may be causing ill health and show that you are interested in the employee\u2019s wellbeing.\n\n3. Follow your own rules about sick pay\nIf your contracts of employment only give Statutory Sick Pay, it is important not to pay full pay for the odd day off sick. We advise our HR Advice Line clients on the importance of being consistent, not only in their treatment between employees, but also in how they treat short term and long term illness.\n\nAn employee who is paid for a day off for his Monday migraine may question why this does not apply to his 3 months\u2019 absence for stress.\n\n4. Set trigger points for taking action on sickness levels\nThere are various ways of measuring sickness levels, such as the Bradford Factor, which score absence based on the number of occasions and duration. This will put the spotlight on staff who have many one day absences over someone who has been off for 5 consecutive days with flu. Once someone\u2019s absence score has reached a trigger point you should meet with the employee to discuss their attendance and look into any underlying medical issues. Our HR Advice line provides documents and guidance on how to deal fairly with short term or long term absences as they need different treatment.\n\n5. Deal with short term absence\nAny good Absence Management Procedure will include a series of meetings where the manager and the employee can explore the reasons for absence and whether or not there are any work based factors, underlying medical or lifestyle issues.\n\nHR advice should be sought if managers suspect that the employee\u2019s absence is not genuine and a medical report from their GP will often help to clarify the situation. Action plans of support and targets for attendance should be discussed and put into place.\n\n6. Handle long term absences\nIt is important to keep in touch with staff who are on long-term sickness absence. Employers often ask our advice about this as they are afraid of being perceived as harassing the employee or putting them under pressure to return to work. However, if this is handled sensitively it keeps the communication channels open and makes it easier for the employee to return at the right time.\n\nWe can advise our HR Advice Line clients on how to use Occupational Health Specialists to provide expert medical opinions on when an employee might return and any adjustments that might help, such as a change of duties or a phased return.\n\nUnderstanding your duties under the Equality Act is important especially where an employee may be considered to have a disability.\n\n7. And understand the 101 other reasons why your staff may be absent!\n\nAbsence is one of the biggest issues that employers ask us about on the HR Advice line, but not all absence is related to illness. We also advise and support our employers to deal with absences such as:\nMaternity, paternity, adoption, parental, shared parental, dependent emergencies, compassionate, unauthorised, jury service, holiday, religious pilgrimages, sabbaticals and snow!\n\nOur HR Advice Line offers clients unlimited HR support and advice on all of the situations above. As your HR Advisor we can write appropriate policies, provide letters to meet the situation, attend difficult meetings with you and your staff and recommend specialists such as Occupational Health Advisors.\n\nInformation about our HR Advice line service is provided here.

        "text":"Money may be the most talked about wealth contained within your estate, but the riches of your experience and wisdom can mean even more to family members down the line. Reinforcing family traditions can be built into your estate plan alongside your wishes regarding your money, property, and belongings. After all, what makes a family a family is its values and traditions \u2014 not its finances.\n\n\nIt\u2019s an excellent idea to hold a family meeting in which you discuss the \u00a0things that matter most to you. In addition to the value of sharing your wisdom, you can also make contention among your heirs less likely if they understand the reasons behind your choices. This is just one of the many reasons to have a family discussion about your legacy and your estate plan.\n\n\nHow to tell your story through your estate plan\n\n\nIt\u2019s a delight to get to hear your elders\u2019 stories of their fondest memories and wildest adventures, as well as the struggles they overcame to get the family where it is today. This wisdom provides meaning for a financial legacy that otherwise might just be viewed as a windfall. As part of your estate and legacy planning, you can decide to record your own personal history. Here are a few ways:\n\n\n  \u2022 Audio files: With the broad range of audio formats available today, you can record in the way that\u2019s easiest for you \u2013 anything from a handheld cassette recorder to the Voice Memos app on your iPhone. There are some easy-to-use digitizing services that can compile your stories into audio files to make available to your family and descendants.\n\n\n  \u2022 Video files: The same goes for home movies and other video recordings. Older film formats can be easily digitized and organized along with the videos from your phone. Today\u2019s technology also makes it easier than ever to add narration (and context) to a video, making the story all the richer.\n\n\n  \u2022 Photo albums: Many families have prized photo collections that catalog generations. It\u2019s a tragedy when something like this is lost in a fire or extreme weather event, or even misplaced in a move. Creating a digital database is a favor to your family in more ways than one: Not only will they have access to these memories at any time, they can also feel secure knowing that these family treasures won\u2019t be lost anytime soon and that multiple copies can be made for the different branches of the family.\n\n\n  \u2022 Letters and other writings: If you enjoy writing, you can also include handwritten or typed letters or stories to your family members in your legacy plan to be received and read at the time of your choosing. You can also include past letters and postcards that might be tucked away in the attic. It\u2019s not only a personal delight to relive the memories of the past by reviewing your old letters and postcards, but it\u2019s also a great way for younger generations to get to know and sincerely appreciate your life journey and legacy.\n\n\nPassing your values to the next generation\n\nSome estate planning strategies blend your finances and personal values. For example, we might have a discussion on some of your core values in life. Whether you feel most passionate about the need for your beneficiaries to travel and gain worldly experience, continue a unique family tradition like sailing or astronomy, or support meaningful charitable or spiritual work, we can draft trusts that contain funds specifically set aside for these endeavors.\n\n\n  \u2022 Educational trusts: If you value education, you might want to set up a trust to fund undergraduate and graduate degrees, med school, study abroad, or even community classes for your family\u2019s future generations. Because of sharp increases in educational costs within the U.S., your grandchildren will likely stand to benefit immensely from an educational trust.\n\n\n  \u2022 Incentive trusts: Similar to the way educational trusts set aside wealth for the purpose of funding a beneficiary\u2019s schooling, incentive trusts can also help steer the course of your descendants\u2019 lives be encouraging some paths while discouraging others. For example, an incentive trust could contain instructions for disbursements to be released when the beneficiary is working a part or full-time job. Or if family vacations were an important part of your upbringing, you could set aside funds specifically for your grandchildren to experience the same wonderful tradition you enjoyed.\n\n\n  \u2022 Charitable trusts or foundations: Charitable trusts or foundations establish a family legacy of supporting a particular cause, but they also have the added financial benefit of reducing income and estate taxes. They are an excellent way to help a charitable organization that\u2019s central to your core values and make your name associated with that philanthropic effort for generations to come.\n\n\nAre you curious about exploring a few of these options in your estate and legacy plan? Contact Slawson & Slawson\u00a0today, and we can schedule an appointment to go over your many options for showcasing your memories and values in a long-lasting way that truly benefits your family",

Do you panic? Ask for help? Give up and go shopping (on credit)? Whether you're dealing with a sudden emergency, unpaid child support, or a job loss, there are some things you can do to gain control of your finances and bounce back when you're short on cash.\n\n1. Stop Spending\n\nMan holding empty wallet\nImage Source\/Getty Images\nThis is the first step. Think over what you have planned between now and your next paycheck. Are there social plans requiring spending that you could postpone or cancel? Would it be possible to cook dinners using only what you already have in your pantry or freezer? Look for ways to stop the flow of money out of your bank account right now, and avoid the temptation to purchase additional non-essential items.\n\n2. Re-evaluate Your Monthly Spending\n\nMost families spend quite a bit of money on non-essential - yet standard - items. For example, consider eliminating your cable or satellite TV service - or at least switching to a lower-cost option for a while. In addition, consider the money you may be spending on the convenience of a cell phone or text messaging. These are luxuries that can be eliminated when you are short on cash.\n\n3. Create a Budget\n\nIf you don't already have a plan in place for how you're going to spend your money each month, now is the time to create one. Use our free budgeting tool for single parent families to plug in your monthly income and expenses and play around with which items you can reduce. In addition, remember that living on a budget is intended to help you free up your money so that you can spend it where you really want to, rather than unintentionally spending more than you can afford each month.\n\n4. Resolve Outstanding Debts\n\nThis is also a good time to follow through with any friends or relatives who may owe you some money. In addition, if you do not receive child support, and you've never applied for it, this would be a good time to begin the process of filing for child support. Most likely, even in the best of circumstances, it will take some time before your child actually receives this type of financial support, but this is as good a time as any to begin that process. Keep in mind, too, that it's your child's right to be supported financially by both parents.\n\n5. Trim Some More\n\nBefore you begin thinking about taking on another job, look for additional ways to cut your spending. Simple techniques such as drinking water instead of soda or fancy coffees can really trim your monthly spending. Look for ways to save at least as much as you hoped to make with a second job. For example, if you really need another $300 to get by each month, look for ways to save $300 before you take on another job (which could put extra strain on your family).\n\n6. Maximize Your Income\n\nFinally, you may come to the conclusion that you do, indeed, need to look for ways to earn extra income. If possible, look for options that would allow you to work from home, around your family's schedule, or perhaps even allow you to bring your children with you. For example, consider spreading the word in your area that you are available for child care in the evenings, or that you can take care of pets on the weekends.\n\n\u00a92014 About.com.

        "text":"Tax Tips to Keep in Mind When Selling a Home\n\nIf you sell a home, you may qualify to exclude from your income all or part of any gain from the sale. Below are some things you should keep in mind when selling a home:\n\nOwnership and use.\u00a0To claim the exclusion, you must meet the ownership and use tests. During a five-year period ending on the date of the sale, you must have:\n\n  \u2022 Owned the home for at least two years.\n  \u2022 Lived in the home as your main home for at least two years.\n\nGain.\u00a0Those who sell their main home and have a gain from the sale may usually be able to exclude up to $250,000 from their income or $500,000 on a joint return. Homeowners who can exclude all of the gain do not need to report the sale on their tax return.\n\nLoss.\u00a0You experience a loss when your main home sells for less than what you paid for it. This loss is not deductible.\n\nReported sale.\u00a0Those who cannot exclude the gain from their income must report the sale of their home on a tax return. Those who choose not to claim the exclusion must report the gain on a tax return. Those who receive a\u00a0Form 1099-S,\u00a0Proceeds from Real Estate Transactions, as part of the real estate transaction must also report the sale on their tax return.\n\nMortgage debt.\u00a0Some must report forgiven or canceled debt as income on their tax return. This generally includes people who went through a mortgage workout, foreclosure, or other process in which a lender forgave or canceled mortgage debt on their home. Those who had a written agreement for the forgiveness of the debt in place before January 1, 2017, might be able to exclude the forgiven amount from income.\n\nPossible exceptions.\u00a0There are\u00a0exceptions to these rules\u00a0for persons with a disability, certain members of the military, intelligence community and Peace Corps workers, among others.\n\nMultiple homes.\u00a0Those who own more than one home can only exclude the gain on the sale of their main home. They must pay taxes on the gain from selling any other home.\n\nDo you have the support you need to manage your small business bookkeeping?

        "text":"How to Buy U.S. Stock Shares\n\nAfter the miserable years the U.S. stock market had between 2000 and 2010, many investors think it might be time for a turnaround. Although experts contend that you never know the perfect time to buy, purchasing shares of U.S. stocks isn\u2019t as easy as it may seem. There is much to learn, as you'll have to decide which brokerage account to open, which stocks to buy and then complete the trade to purchase your shares. Luckily, all these tasks fall into a few basic areas you\u2019ll need to study before pressing the \u201cbuy\u201d button or calling your broker to purchase U.S. company shares.\n\nWrite your goals in actionable, concrete terms. The National Endowment for Financial Education recommends that you start any investment plan by making a list of goals that have a set time table to reach and are reasonable to obtain. By completing this exercise, you\u2019ll narrow the list of thousands of U.S. companies in which you can invest down to a more manageable number that may suit your financial goals.\n\nPlace enough money in a brokerage account to purchase U.S. stocks and cover your trading costs. People who don\u2019t want to trade alone or are uncomfortable making stock-picking decisions without professional help may be well served using a full-service brokerage company. You\u2019ll have access to investment professionals who are licensed to help you buy suitable U.S. stocks for your goals. Ask your friends for recommendations of good brokers they may know. Check the track record and background of any prospective financial advisor by using the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) BrokerCheck website (see Resources).\n\nPlace money instead in an online or discount brokerage account if you\u2019re comfortable completing research, making trades and tracking your U.S. stock portfolio alone. By choosing a discount broker, you won\u2019t receive the help of a professional, but you\u2019ll save some money on trading costs. Find and compare a few different online or discount broker fees, trading tools, and services before deciding to open an account.\n\nList U.S. companies you enjoy or admire, or whose products you use, to begin your research tasks. Long-time investment pro Peter Lynch recommends buying shares in companies you know because you\u2019re more likely to understand why they\u2019re profitable and the possible stumbling blocks that may stand in their way in the future. Use research tools online through websites such as Etrade Clearstation, Yahoo! Finance and MarketWatch Bigcharts to scan company revenue and profits, find news about management changes and product offerings, and track charts displaying historical share price trends.\n\nPurchase U.S. companies by executing buy trade orders. You\u2019ll want to decide between market and limit orders to buy your shares. Market orders trade immediately at the best available price. You\u2019ll want a limit order when you\u2019re worried you may overpay for a stock. Limit orders are placed at a price below the market, in the hopes that the price will descend, triggering your trade.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAs a former financial advisor to companies and individuals for 16 years, Joe Andrews knows financial planning and marketing from start-ups to personal budgets.

        "text":"4 steps to align your talent and change strategy\n\n\n14 August 2017\n\n\n1 rating\n\nIf change is the new norm, why do we still deal in static job roles?\n\nAsk yourself when was the last time your job description was updated? You might have had tweaks here and there but I would take a bet that it certainly hasn\u2019t been updated year on year. However, we\u2019re asking people to change all the time.\n\nSo that\u2019s our challenge. When we\u2019re taking people through change all the time, how do we ensure our change and talent processes line up?\n\nBeyond getting your Change Director and Talent Director to sit down together (which is an excellent idea if you can make it happen!) I believe that there are four keys steps to work through:\n\nStep one: Consider the context of your change\n\nBefore thinking about your talent strategy, it\u2019s important to have absolute clarity on the context of your change. While our research suggests there are five key contextual factors for change to consider (you can read more on those here), two of these factors are particularly relevant for talent, namely: the level of change momentum and the culture of the organisation.\n\nFirstly, change momentum refers to the speed and scale of the change occurring. So, for example, if your organisation is growing at a fast pace and requiring you to bring on many new employees it\u2019s vitally important to respect your existing talent. If not managed carefully, bringing in new talent might mean that your existing talent feels overlooked and potentially become disengaged if they are not provided the opportunities that they want. The worst-case scenario is that you start to lose existing talent just as you\u2019re bringing in new talent to aid your growth strategy.\n\nSecondly, think about talent in terms of the culture. Who are the people that stand out and embody what your organisation is truly about; the company\u2019s values, behaviors, attitudes, and essence. Identify these cultural icons in your talent pool, get them championing the change and they can unleash a driving force like no other. Lose them and your change could take an unexpected turn for the worse.\n\nStep two: Define where you need to get to\n\nIt\u2019s not just about where your organisation needs to get to, but where you need your people to be too. It\u2019s important therefore to have a clear set of leadership capabilities based on your future needs and this can be a fairly straightforward step if you have a very well-defined business strategy and fully understand the leadership implications.\n\nFor example, if you have a new system implementation taking place, you\u2019re probably going to need leaders who are really strong communicators, so they can engage people with the change and the new system. However, if your current talent strategy is focused on developing leaders who are more results driven and less communicative, you may suddenly find your change and talent strategies are somewhat out of alignment with each other.\n\nStep three: Be clear on where you are now\n\nConduct a gap analysis, comparing where you are now from where you need to be; while this may sound like an obvious step, this is actually where we see organisations fall down the most. Often people don\u2019t recognise the biases that they may bring to these conversations and feel that instead, they intuitively know where they are now. Understanding in detail what is experienced at different levels of the organisation is the key part of this step and should be given just as much time and effort as the others. You need to gather all the data to get a true and complete picture of where you are currently in terms of talent and where you need to be.\n\nSpecifically, we recommend exploring the gap at two levels:\n\n\n  \u2022 Capabilities: When it comes to change, some of the capabilities will be more important than others and these include: adaptability, resilience and a tolerance for ambiguity. Change is often messy and therefore it\u2019s important that your leaders feel confident in the direction the organisation is going in but are OK that the \u2018how\u2019 of getting there may not be crystal clear at times.\n\n\n  \u2022 Readiness: This isn\u2019t just about leaders aligning with what is happening within the organisation, but also whether your leaders understand enough about what is going on. Do they really buy into the change? Have they been able to create their own story around why the change is a good idea? But more importantly, are they ready for the change? In order to engage others with the change, it\u2019s vital that your leaders feel empowered to bring others on board with it.\n\n\nOnce you have a full picture of your capabilities and readiness, you can start considering how to plug the gaps you might have.\n\nStep four: Plug the gaps\n\nOnce you have a clear picture of what you have now and what you need for the future, deciding on how to plug the gaps should be fairly easy. Tools such as assessment centres, diagnostics and 360s are a great way to benchmark your leaders prior to developing interventions.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if you\u2019ve identified gaps within the communication of change you might need to provide opportunities for people to make sense of the change. Ways to achieve that could be through a series of leadership forums, town halls or lunchtime sessions. Leaders and managers leading the change may also need to develop their storytelling skills.\n\nPlugging the gaps could also involve bringing new people on board so you\u2019ll need a robust recruitment strategy to ensure you\u2019re finding people with the right skills. If you\u2019re under pressure to recruit quickly don\u2019t fall into the trap of focusing on capabilities alone. A bad cultural fit can have a much larger negative impact on the business than taking a few more weeks to find someone who fits from a capability and culture standpoint.\u00a0\n\nAligning your change and talent strategies is not an easy task but hopefully, these four steps help provide some guidance on where to start and the elements to consider.

        "text":"Business Problem Solving: How to Keep that Entrepreneurial Tunnel Vision\n\nJune 20, 2017 Sample HubSpot User\n\nFocus isn\u2019t easy.\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur, you have a natural urge tugging you toward the next shiny business idea. While your\n\n\nBusiness Problem Solving: How to Keep that Entrepreneurial Tunnel Vision\n\nentrepreneurial spirit is excellent, however, and sure to bring you rewards later, you must first focus on the business you\u2019ve already started.\n\n\nLack of focus can cause you to lose opportunities \u2013 it could even be the demise of your budding business.\n\n\nSo if you find yourself daydreaming about better ideas or jumping from business to business, now is the time to regain your tunnel vision.\n\n\nThe Hard-and-Fast Facts: A Motivator to Keep on Point\n\nEntrepreneurs are critical to the success of today\u2019s economy.\n\n\nAs an\u00a0entrepreneur, you\u2019re adding to the national income, stabilizing the job market, and adding healthy competition. Furthermore, the\u00a0Small Business Association\u00a0says that 99.7% of U.S. employers are small businesses and in 2010, there were 27.9 million small businesses, with 18,000 of them having more than 500 employees.\n\n\nThe survival rate for new small businesses can be discouraging, though \u2013 50% fail in the first five years, and only one-third make it for ten years.\n\n\nTo beat the odds, you need laser focus.\n\n\nEssential Business Problem Solving: Start with Developing Serious Tunnel Vision\n\nReady to develop a tunnel vision that keeps you motivated, on track, and successful? Utilize these three tools:\n\n\n1. \u00a0Visualize the Future\n\nThe term \u201cvisualize\u201d might make you feel as though you\u2019re attending a life improvement seminar, but the idea holds value.\n\nVisualize your objectives in the distance ahead of you. Give yourself attainable goals to move toward \u2013 the larger office in the corner, the big, cushy retirement, or whatever makes you stay on top of the business you\u2019re already in.\n\n\n2. \u00a0Deploy the 'One Thing Principle'\n\nThe book The One Thing gives us a theory that you can do one thing that will make everything easier.\n\n\nThere\u2019s always one thing \u2013 and if you have to create a to-do list to tackle it or devote an entire week to the \u2018one thing,\u2019 do it. Stay on the one thing and consider anything that doesn\u2019t contribute to it useless.\n\n\n3. Stop Second Guessing and Time Wasting\n\nOnce you have a strategy, move forward with it. Don't second guess your line of attack and don't deviate from the strategy. Don't shift markets, don't add features to products in development, and don't consider another strategy until you're positive the one you made is going to fail. All the switching back and forth wastes valuable time.\n\n\nNow is the Time to Deploy Your Entrepreneur Tunnel Vision\n\nNow you know you need just one thing to focus on each day and that you should only perform tasks that take you to that one thing. Stop second guessing and wasting time on ideas and you\u2019ll spend more time on actions rather than reactions.\n\n\nWhen you visualize the one thing, move toward it, and only do steps to achieve it, you will regain your focus and ultimately find success\n\n\nTags: Business Management Small Business",

        "text":"How To Refinance Everything In Your Life\n\nBy Kali Hawlk | May 2, 2016\n\nEver wished you could have a do-over on the terms of your auto or student loan? Guess what? The benefits of a refi aren\u2019t just for homeowners.\n\nLet\u2019s play a little word-association game. What comes to mind when you hear the word \u201crefinance\u201d? If you answered \u201cmortgages,\u201d you\u2019re not alone. A mortgage is the one type of loan that\u2019s probably most frequently associated with refinancing. But refinancing goes beyond just helping people give their mortgages a makeover: Did you know that the concept of a refi can apply to just about any kind of loan, from your student loans to your auto loan?\n\nWhether you\u2019re renting a pricey studio apartment in San Francisco, CA, or a home in Richmond, VA, if you\u2019re a renter with any type of loan, it\u2019s worth understanding how the process works \u2014 and how it can help you.\n\nHow can renters take advantage of refinancing?\n\nYou can refinance almost any type of debt, not just mortgages. If you have car loans or student loans, for example, you may be able to refinance them. Refinancing simply means you\u2019re taking one loan and replacing it with another, with the new loan having different (and preferably more favorable) terms than the old one. You may want to refinance a loan to get a better interest rate than your original debt carries or to reduce the monthly payment you make. You can also consolidate many loans into a single one. Any of these outcomes can make personal debts easier to manage \u2014 and therefore easier for you to repay.\n\nIf you have a variable-rate loan and long for a more stable monthly payment, you may want to refinance simply to secure terms that present a little less risk. For example, swapping that variable-rate loan for a loan with a fixed interest rate could help with budgeting. But if you\u2019re thinking about refinancing a loan to enjoy one or more of these potential benefits, it\u2019s important to understand that there are two kinds of refis to choose from: rate-and-term and cash-out.\n\nWhat you need to know about rate-and-term refinancing\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in refinancing something like an auto loan or student loans to get a better interest rate or change the loan term, consider rate-and-term refinancing. This type of refinancing can be beneficial to borrowers if you originally took out your loan when interests rates were much higher than what you can get today. It\u2019s also helpful if you need to alter the amount of your monthly payment. A refi can update the loan term, and changing the length of that term will impact how much you owe each month.\n\nWhat about cash-out refinancing?\n\nCash-out refinancing offers you an interesting option. Going with this type of refi means that your new loan is for more than your existing loan. You get the difference between the new loan and the old in cash. It\u2019s great to have this extra money in hand, but keep in mind, this increases the debt that you carry. You\u2019ll need to repay the entirety of the loan plus the cash you received, and you\u2019ll have to pay interest on all of it.\n\nBefore refinancing everything, consider the downsides\n\nWhile both these refinancing options can be helpful to borrowers, there are some downsides. Just because you carry some debts doesn\u2019t mean a refi will help you manage your repayment or will save you money over time.\n\nIf you want to refinance student loans, for example, you need to remember that this process replaces your old debt with a new one \u2014 and that new loan will come with new terms and benefits. Some federal loans are eligible for benefits like payment programs or even loan forgiveness. If you refinance, you could be disqualified from accessing that repayment help.\n\nAnd refinancing any loan comes with a cost. You\u2019ll be originating a whole new loan, so expect to pay fees just like you did when you originally borrowed the money. This could eliminate any savings you\u2019d accrue over time via a lower interest rate, so always do the math before making your decision. Refinancing could cost you more money in interest over time too. Changing the terms of your loan may lower your monthly payments, but it could also mean you make those payments for a longer time. Stretching out the life of your loan also means paying more in interest. It\u2019s important to weigh the costs, because you might be surprised to find that continuing to pay down your current loans could remain the best option for you.\n\nBottom line: Should you consider refinancing your loans?\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to refinance the loans in your life will depend on your personal situation. Are you doing well in managing the repayment of your debts? If so, you may be better off continuing to do what you\u2019ve been doing to pay down those balances and reach debt freedom. If, on the other hand, you could secure a lower interest rate, get a more manageable monthly payment, or enjoy better terms on a new loan, consider refinancing. Refinancing isn\u2019t just for homeowners, so don\u2019t be afraid to find out if a refi could improve your financial life.\n\nWould\u00a0you refinance student loans or your auto loan?

        "text":"Is It Time to Incorporate Your Small Business?\n\nJigsaw metaphor for Incorporated\n\nIf you\u2019re the sole proprietor or partner in your small business, you\u2019ve probably thought about incorporating at one time or another. If your business is growing and your structure no longer works best for you, incorporation could have significant advantages.\n\nFor one, incorporating your business can give you more credibility with potential lenders, suppliers, customers, investors and employees. And there are other more tangible benefits too.\n\nBenefits of Incorporating\n\nLimited Personal Liability\n\nA corporation is a legal body with the rights of an individual. It can own property, conduct business, incur liabilities and sue or be sued. As a sole proprietor, you assume all the liability of your company. Once you incorporate, your liability is limited to the extent of your shareholdings. Your personal assets, such as your house or car, cannot be seized to pay for business debts.\n\nUnlimited Owners\n\nAn incorporated company can have an unlimited number of different owners. Incorporating also makes it easier to transfer ownership in the business, as owners can buy and sell their shares in the company.\n\nAbility to Raise Money\n\nIncorporating provides you with more opportunity to raise capital for growth and development. Rather than just borrowing money, you can issue shares in your corporation. For the most part, equity capital won\u2019t have to be repaid and incurs no interest.\n\nEmployee Incentives\n\nA corporation can offer shares to employees as a form of profit sharing. This gives employees a stake in the success of your business and incentive to improve performance.\n\nTax Advantages\n\nBy incorporating your business, you can establish your own salary. This can work to your advantage at tax time. In addition, small Canadian private corporations get taxed at about half the regular rate on the first $500,000 of active business income each year.\n\nTransferable Ownership\n\nThe death or withdrawal of a shareholder doesn\u2019t mean an end to a corporation, because it is a separate entity from those who own it.\n\nThe Downside\n\nIncorporating your small business will cost you both money and personal effort. Your corporation must maintain separate accounting records from those of its owner(s). You\u2019ll have to provide financial statements and file separate tax returns. You will also pay fees to incorporate, as well as annual registration fees.\n\nYou Have Decided to Incorporate. Now What?\n\n1. Decide whether to incorporate federally or provincially.\n\nIncorporate federally if you want to conduct business in all provinces and territories. If you incorporate provincially, you can only conduct business in that particular province. Keep in mind, you can incorporate in more provinces later if you decide to expand. Federal incorporation costs less initially, but requires more to set-up, more annual paperwork, and additional annual filing fees.\n\n2. Choose a corporate name.\n\nA corporate name should be made up of three elements: a distinctive portion that identifies your company; a descriptive portion that outlines the company\u2019s function; and a legal element, such as Limited, Incorporated or Corporation. You will be required to do a name search. If you are incorporating federally or in a province such as Ontario, you must conduct a NUANS search. \u00a0Alternatively, you can register a numbered corporation and operate under a different trade name. \u00a0You must register this trade name with the Province of Ontario and obtain a Master Business Licence.\n\n3. Prepare incorporation documents.\n\nGenerally, you will need to prepare the following:\n\nVisit Corporations Canada for full instructions. Be sure to check your province\u2019s document requirements to incorporate provincially. Find out more about incorporating in Ontario here.\n\n4. Apply for incorporation.\n\nIncorporate federally online or by mail or fax. Find a list of provincial websites here. For federal incorporation, there is a fee of $200 (online) or $250 (offline).\n\nOne Response to \u201cIs It Time to Incorporate Your Small Business?\u201d\n\n  1. visit my homepage\n\n    Posted 1459 days ago\n\n    Hello there, You may have conducted an admirable job.

        "text":"Personal loans are best for when you need financing for something of a personal nature.\n\n\nThis could be to fund a holiday, pay for the wedding of your dreams or to buy a lavish item of sorts.\n\nRegardless on what you decide to buy with your personal loan amount, repaying it back as soon as possible should be a priority. It is one way to ensure that you are saving money overall and not paying more than you should be on anything.\n\nWith a few professional tips you can decrease the total amount of interest you are repaying but also save time repaying your loan. This is especially useful if you are planning on applying for another loan to fund your next venture or desired item.\n\nMaintaining an excellent credit score is how you can ensure that you qualify for the loan amount that you would like to apply for. And lenders will have no problem approving loans for credit-worthy applicants.\n\nAll you need to do is use one or more of the tips below to make sure you repay your personal loan in record time.\n\nBi-weekly repayments\n\nYou can divide your repayment amount by two and repay these amounts every two weeks. The more repayments you are making, the more you are saving. Why? Because less interest is accumulating. On a yearly basis, by doing so, you will also make one additional payment per annum. If you are able to stick to this method throughout the duration of your repayment, you could save over several months\u2019 worth of interest.\n\n\nConsider rounding up your payments\n\nThis is a small trick that could potentially save you a lot in the long run. You will be paying extra without even noticing a difference to your cash flow. For example, if your personal loan repayment is R1\u00a0221.20 \u2013 consider paying R1\u00a0300.00. The extra funds might go unnoticed to you but will save money with each payment you round to the next highest figure.\n\nExtra repayments\n\nExtra repayments are the best way for you to save when repaying your loan. Use any additional funds you receive to repay your loan to ensure that you are lowering the interest that is charged to the principle amount per annum.\n\n\u2039 prevnext \u203a",
