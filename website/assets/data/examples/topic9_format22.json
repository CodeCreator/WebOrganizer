You may be wearing a number of different hats, playing the role of marketing strategist, website development lead, campaign manager, content writer, social media guru, and brand police, just to name a few. How do you get it all done? It may sometimes feel impossible, especially if you have hundreds of franchise locations to oversee.\n\nEver wish you could just clone yourself?\n\nFortunately, there are ways to streamline your digital franchise marketing efforts so you don\u2019t have to feel like you\u2019re constantly being pulled in a million different directions. With the right strategies, tools, and support, you can turn chaos into a well-oiled machine that allows you achieve your marketing goals on time and within budget. What better way to show your bosses that you\u2019re truly an expert at your job?\n\nBelow are a few tips for mastering franchise marketing without having to clone yourself:\n\nHire a Marketing Team & Delegate: As the marketing mastermind at your franchise, your skills are best used guiding your franchise network\u2019s overall marketing strategy, monitoring its overall success, and maintaining strong communication with your franchisees\u2014rather than handling all the miniscule details of coding a website or managing numerous pay-per-click advertising campaigns.\n\nThis is where it\u2019s helpful to hire an Internet marketing partner that can handle all of the day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on the big picture (and get everything done). It helps to work with a single, full-service digital marketing company rather than several vendors for each different area of your marketing. Why deal with the struggle of getting all your different vendors on the same page and working together when you could have one partner that seamlessly integrates your website design, search engine optimization (SEO), online advertising, social media, and more?\n\nSimplify the Process of Tracking Your Data: Why dig for data (which can take up hours of your time) when you could have it automatically generated and clearly laid out for you? Here at Scorpion, we offer our franchise clients an online marketing platform that makes it easy for them to track website traffic, organic rankings, PPC campaign performance, leads, and more. All you have to do is login and you have a wealth of data that shows you exactly how your various digital marketing efforts are performing, which is great for tracking your return on investment (ROI).\n\nAccording to HubSpot\u2019s 2015 State of Inbound report, proving return on investment (ROI) of marketing activities was the number one challenge of both B2B and B2C marketers. And 32% of digital marketers and enterprise companies said making analytics actionable was one of their top three challenges, according to a 2016 study by Experian.\n\nTo take you analytics a step further, we make it possible for you to integrate our platform with your customer relationship management (CRM) system so you have a more complete picture of how your marketing campaign and leads are tied to your customer acquisition and revenue. Read more about our award-winning marketing platform.\n\nPre-Schedule Your Content: Consistency is key when blogging and engaging followers on social media. If you are only posting your content sporadically when you have pockets of time, you risk slipping out of the spotlight and losing the interest of your followers. With a good content management system (CMS) and social media management platform, you can pre-schedule your posts so they\u2019re ready to go at the right time. That way you can work on your content in bulk when you have the time and not have to worry about gaps in your posting schedule.\n\nHaving trouble generating enough content ideas to keep up with the demand? Try using content strategy tools such as BuzzSumo, which allows you to identify the highest trending content for certain keywords. This is a great way to get ideas for your own franchise blog and social media content.\n\nAre you a franchise marketer who needs support?

        "text":"Management - Finding Top Talent\n\nCreative Ways To Attract Star Employees\n\nFinding Top TalentWhen he needs to find the next great employee for his company, Mike Michalowicz often ditches conventional wisdom. \u201cI\u2019ve learned not to recruit upon experience,\u201d says Michalowicz, founder of consultancy Profit First Professionals. \u201cThe best employees should be recruited on their attitude, their intelligence, their energy and their values. Those elements cannot be trained or taught \u2013 that\u2019s just what they bring to the table.\u201d\n\nAre you willing to think a little differently to recruit the very best employees? If you are, keep reading for strategies that can make your search a success.\n\nLeverage Your Employees\nA free and effective way to find great new workers is to ask your current staffers for leads. \u201cThere\u2019s that saying: Birds of a feather flock together. Intelligent people prefer to hang out with intelligent people. People with strong energy like to hang out with people with strong energy,\u201d Michalowicz says.\n\nThe key, according to Michalowicz, is to identify people within your organization that have traits you\u2019re looking for in a new employee. Then, mine their personal networks for candidates. \u201cAsk your best employees who else they know and admire, and they\u2019ll turn you on to people just like them,\u201d he says.\n\nAmy Rees Anderson, managing partner of REES Capital and contributing writer for Forbes magazine, uses her employees as talent scouts. If they witnessed great service \u2013 whether it was at a drive-thru window or another customer service position \u2013 \u201cwe have little cards that our employees can hand someone,\u201d she says. \u201cIt tells them we\u2019re hiring and gives them a website to go to for an application.\u201d\n\nAnderson\u2019s philosophy is this: you can learn a lot about a person by being their customer. \u201cYou\u2019re getting them in their natural environment,\u201d she says. For example, you can see how that person handles a rude customer, since \u201cyou\u2019re seeing them in their natural habitat, and you can make a judgment call,\u201d she says.\n\nBe Inexact With Online Ads\nAnderson has learned not to be too precise with the want ads she posts on sites like Monster and LinkedIn. \u201cYou have to be willing to not pigeonhole the exact skillset you\u2019re looking for,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that when we got too specific on a job description, people would respond by listing exactly what we said we wanted.\u201d\n\nSo, Anderson started to take a totally different approach by posting they were searching for people, not positions. \u201cWe said, \u2018We\u2019re looking for people whose values are important to them, and we\u2019re going to figure out how to use you in our company,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nAfter hiring them, Anderson then trains new employees in a unique way. \u201cOnce the person is hired, we\u2019d let them have exposure to every area in the company,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d see where they tended to gravitate toward, what they seemed to have a passion toward and what they had ideas about.\u201d\n\nCreate Tests Within Ads\nMichalowicz likes to develop \u201cmini tests\u201d within his online ads in order to gauge the attention to detail of prospective employees. \u201cWe\u2019ll post an ad on Craigslist, but instead of listing a two-paragraph ad like our competitors, we\u2019ll make ours into a mini novel,\u201d he says. \u201cEmbedded in the ad, we\u2019ll say, \u2018If you\u2019re in fact reading all these details, we want you to respond to the ad in an email with this specific subject line.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat that does, Michalowicz believes, is instantly root out people who are just sending back generic answers. \u201cIf we get 100 responses, maybe five of them will have the subject line exactly how we want it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe method to getting a great employee is filtering out the bad ones, and that ad filters out the bad ones.\u201d\n\nMichalowicz accidently stumbled upon another test by making a simple mistake. His firm ran an ad misspelling the word \u201cmeticulous\u201d \u2013 an error one prospective candidate noticed. She got the job. \u201cThat person didn\u2019t feel threatened by authority when she identified the problem,\u201d Michalowicz says. \u201cThat was a mistake, but it\u2019s now become a test. We will actually have a misspelled word embedded into the ad.\u201d\n\nAsk for Video Cover Letters\nMichalowicz prefers applicants who submit their cover letter in video, not written, form.\n\n\u201cMost respondents don\u2019t do it,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone has the capability \u2013 you can use your smartphone \u2013 and they convey their energy on it.\u201d\n\nOnly two applicants submitted an online cover letter for one of Michalowicz\u2019s recent job postings. His company ended up hiring one of those two applicants. \u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d he says. \u201cWe spent almost no time having to go through those interviews, and this one person just outshined everybody else.\u201d\n\nMichalowicz asks applicants to post their videos on YouTube, which helps create additional interest for his company. \u201cTheir friends see it, and now there\u2019s a conversation about my company\u201d and they will apply as well, he says. \u201cAgain, good people hang out with good people, so it\u2019s a great subtle advertisement to find what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nPush Personality Profiles\nAnderson was originally skeptical of using a test to help with hiring \u2013 until she came across Wonderlic\u2019s Comprehensive Personality Profile. Anderson says the test gives you an indication of an individual\u2019s personality, and lets you know if they would do better in a position where they\u2019re working with data or interacting with others.\n\nWonderlic\u2019s tests have helped Anderson determine the temperament and mentality of prospective employees. Anderson says the test answers important questions such as: \u201cAre they somebody who\u2019s going to perform because they care about competing against their own best? Or do they care about competing against other people?\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s important, because if they\u2019re in it just to beat others, they can be a bit of a loose cannon.\u201d\n\nIf they\u2019re in it, though, to beat their best, they\u2019re more likely to be a team player, Anderson believes. \u201cThis is someone who\u2019s going to do their best in spite of what everybody else does,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s really the kind of personality we look for.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Forget Outgoing Employees\nSome of Michalowicz\u2019s best staffers are those who left for one of his competitors, but eventually decided to return. \u201cWhen I have a key employee leave to go to a competitor, I make sure they\u2019re taken care of at our organization until the last day,\u201d he says. \u201cThen, we tell them, \u2018We wish you great success. Would you mind if I check in with you to see how things are going?\u2019\u201d\n\nMichalowicz was able to talk a former employee into returning once she found out her new position wasn\u2019t as wonderful as she thought it would be. \u201cWhen you land at a new place, you find out the grass really isn\u2019t that much greener, and often it\u2019s not at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s on us as the owner to keep the door open and keep the communication going.\u201d\n\nCase Study",

        "text":"Advice That Will Surely Help You In Affiliate Marketing\n\nSome people say that the internet has taken the entertainment industry\u2019s place, as one of the only recession-proof venues in existence. If that\u2019s true at all, then it\u2019s only true because of the billions of product choices that you can find online. As an affiliate marketer, you have free reign to choose which products you want to sell. Use this information to help you make the best decision.\n\nOne thing to beware of with affiliate marketing programs is alienating your customers. Make sure that the products and services offered by your affiliates are ethical and offer good value for customers\u2019 money. Nothing will poison the opinion of a visitor to your website faster than directing him or her to a scam. Conversely, helping a visitor find a product he or she is interested in can make them appreciate your site.\n\nPick a layout for your site that matches the image you want to portray. You want to make sure the style of your site matches the items that are on it. You don\u2019t want to throw viewers off by having a site that looks nothing related to the types of products that are available on it.\n\nBe honest to your readers and disclose your affiliations. Readers know an affiliate ad when they see one, and they will appreciate your honesty. It\u2019ll make them feel better about supporting you by using your referral link. Furthermore, honesty is important in generating a loyal reader base that will continue to generate money in the future.\n\nWhen selecting an affiliate marketing program, make sure to consider the needs of your site\u2019s audience. You want to select a product that is relevant to your readers, otherwise it will make you appear like a con artist that is just after their money. Focus on your niche market and recommend only products and services that are relevant to them, and they will be more likely to follow links and buy.\n\nIf you find the website of the product owners not very well done, you can easily find affiliate link cloaker tools. These programs allow you to link any page from the company\u2019s website. Link your audience directly to the page where they can buy the product if your own website provides enough content.\n\nTo increase the success of your affiliate marketing, discover the type of tracking software a company uses before you join their affiliate program. If the program does not track all of your sales, then you will not receive credit for all of the viewers that you refer to their company.\n\nIf your website is sports-related, you already know what your visitors are going to be interested in. Keep your affiliate links sports related, otherwise they probably won\u2019t click on it. You are most likely to get visitors from that link if it is directly related to your website.\n\nBeing an affiliate is all about the product, as we alluded to in the opening of this article. However, it\u2019s also about following the other steps listed here, in order to achieve your ultimate goal. You will never stop learning about marketing as a whole, nor should you. You should follow helpful advice anywhere you can get it. Start with this article and continue to be a student of the genre.",

Here is an article to help you get started.\n\nAn internet home based business is probably one of the easiest and most inexpensive to set-up. If you want to set-up your very own online business, you can do so anytime without having to go through the complications involved in offline businesses. If you start setting up your own Internet home based business now, you will surely be surprised of how easy it is than you may have initially imagined it to be.\n\nThe first and most obvious step in building your Internet home based business is to choose a product to sell. The best products to sell today are those that are electronic in nature and can be easily delivered through the Internet. This can be an eBook, audio format, software or a video. To maximize potential profits, make sure that you have an interesting and unique product which will catch the attention of your target audience. It is also best to go for a product which is generally popular, or is promising enough to be popular to your target market.\n\nOnce you have decided on a certain product or products to sell, your next step is to create a site where you will sell your product on. Your site will be very important in your Internet home based business. It will be best if you can register a domain name that fits your product the most. You should also find a reliable yet affordable web host to make it easy for you to manage your site. If you have good website design skills, make a site that is neither too flashy nor graphic laden. What you want is a site that is appealing, yet not too overt to turn off potential customers.\n\nYou need to make sure that everything about your site is quick and easy to use. Your payment processor should be set in place. It might be best to go for payment channels such as PayPal as it is free and easy to set-up. In the same way, your Internet home based business site should also feature a product delivery that is automatic and instant. Not only will this be best for your customers, but this can also save you time as you will not need to email the product or send a download link after payment has been made.\n\nThe content of your site will have a big contribution to the success of your Internet home based business. You have to come up with an attractive heading that will instantly catch your viewer's attention. More importantly, your site should contain detailed information on the product that you are selling. You can ask for feedback from previous customers and put them as testimonials and endorsements.\n\nIt will also be a great idea to drive traffic into your site through proper keyword research and search engine optimization. Joining discussion forums, article marketing and social bookmarking are also all equally effective means to market your product to the rest of the world. Remember that the success of any Internet home based business goes as far as its accessibility to its target customers. So, bank on a good product and market effectively.\nAbout the Author\nExperience how it is like to earn big money within the comforts of your home through the Internet.
