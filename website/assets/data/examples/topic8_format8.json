        "text":"Salon & Spa Policies\n\nMissed Appointment Policy\n\nPlease understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services. Our appointments are confirmed two business days in advance because we know how easy it is to forget an appointment you booked months ago.\u00a0 Since the service is reserved for you personally, a MISSED APPOINTMENT fee will apply.\n\nAs a courtesy, we offer text and\/or email confirmations that are sent out two business days prior to your appointment date. However, if we are unable to reach you please understand that it is your responsibility to remember your appointment dates and times to avoid late arrivals, missed appointments and the missed appointment fee.\n\nWe Require At Least:\n\n  \u2022 24-hours notice for appointment cancellations\n  \u2022 48 hours notice for Spa Package cancellations\n\nGuests who cancel their appointments without proper notice or do not show up for their reserved appointment times are considered a \u201cmissed appointment.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Policy\n\nInnovations is a family owned business operated by family focused employees. We take the safety and well-being our child guests, as well as, the comfort and relaxation of our adult guests very seriously. In the event you must bring a young child into the salon, please provide proper supervision for them in the form of an additional caretaker. Unfortunately, the salon cannot provide childcare services. Also, young children in carriers\/strollers may not be placed near the service areas or held in the lap.\n\nWe kindly request ONLY those receiving services be present in the service areas. Older children, (12+) capable of sitting quietly and unsupervised, may wait in the provided seating area. While this policy helps ensure that all guests enjoy a relaxing salon experience, it was created with your child\u2019s safety in mind.\n\nOur salon is not child-proof. Sharp instruments, hot styling tools, chemicals and a busy, congested area make for a potentially dangerous environment for young children.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your compliance with our child safety policy.\n\nPrices Policy\n\nWe are constantly expanding our services to bring you the latest and greatest. Although we make every effort to keep our website and spa menu updated, please note that prices and services are subject to change at any time.\n\nOur salon staff works on a \u201cLevel System\u201d which measures experience and years of dedication. Those at higher levels are more often educators and lecturers that have established a high client demand. This encourages stability and allows our employees to grow and prosper based on years of loyalty and dedication to their profession and clients. We provide artists at every level to best suit the needs of our clients.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nPlease notify Guest Services before reserving your appointment if you have high blood pressure, allergies, any other physical ailments or disabilities, or if you are pregnant. If you have any concerns at all, please let us know. If at any time during your services you experience discomfort, please alert your service provider immediately.\n\nPayments & Gratuities\u2019\n\nWe accept cash, MasterCard and Visa. Personal checks are also accepted accompanied with a valid drivers license.\n\nGratuity is not included in the service fees listed on our menu.",

It is also important to keep a record of your booking on hand. If you have entered the wrong phone number we will not be held responsible if you do not receive a confirmation text due to incorrect details. If your regular phone number is often unattended please provide us with an alternative contact number and save your booking to your calendar.\n  \u2022 Bang Bang Beauty Bar will not hold appointments. If you have contacted us for an appointment and we are waiting to hear back from you to confirm a given time we will not hold that appointment until you have confirmed it.\u00a0\n  \u2022 We kindly ask that clients notify us of the need to reschedule or cancel appointments at least 24 hours before the scheduled appointment.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Cancellations of your scheduled appointment must be made no less than 12 hours prior to your scheduled appointment time. If less than 12 hours notice is given 10% of your booking fee will be charged.\u00a0\n  \u2022 If you do not show up to your scheduled appointment or cancel within 1 hour of your appointment this is considered a \u201cNo Show\u2019. You will automatically forfeit a fee of 30% of the cost of your booking and you will be required to pay the remaining cost of your missed appointment before you can make any further bookings.\n  \u2022 Regular No shows or cancellations are a no go. Re-offending clients will have to prepay future appointments, will be denied access to the online booking system and given restricted hours \/ days in which they can book.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Running late to your appointment puts stress on our schedule. If you think you are going to be late to your appointment please let us know as soon as possible so we can make a note on your booking and do our best to accommodate.\n  \u2022 If our team decides they can see you, but has to reduce your treatment to prevent interrupting other appointments, the original charge for the appointment will still apply.\n  \u2022 If you are late to an appointment without notice or have missed the majority of your appointment this is considered a \u2018No Show\u2019 and we will charge 30% of the cost of the appointment immediately and require the balance of your to be paid before you can make any further appointments.\u00a0\n  \u2022 If your appointment has to be rescheduled because we are unable to accommodate you, this is considered as a \u2018No Show\u2019 and we will charge 30% of the cost of the appointment immediately and require the balance of your to be paid before you can make any further appointments.\u00a0\n  \u2022 It is not acceptable to show up late and ask for a reduced treatment, while expecting to be charged for the lesser time.\n  \u2022 Booking in for a particular service and then changing your mind at your appointment as to what service you require is not acceptable. We designate the correct time for each client. If you request for a lesser treatment the original booking will be charged. If you request for additional treatments, please discuss with your therapist to see if this can be accommodated. When making online bookings, it is your responsibility to make sure you have booked all the services you require at your appointment.\n  \u2022 Letting us know ahead of time if there is a possibility of needing to reschedule \/ revise your appointment is much appreciated. It is likely we can accommodate moving you to a more appropriate time and adding or subtracting services if several days notice is given.\n  \u2022 If you act in any way that is abusive towards staff or clients, we have the right to deny service and to ask you to leave the premises.\n  \u2022 We encourage parents to visit our salon without children (aged 12 and under), unless the child is attending an appointment. We mean no disrespect to our client\u2019s with children and put this policy forward with respect to our clients well being and that of our staff. Your treatment and the attention of your therapist is of the utmost importance to us and past experiences have helped us arrive at this policy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 We work in a semi-open studio. In any given space we use sharps, needles, chemicals & hot wax \u2013 these are not only hazardous to children but dangerous to our clients and staff in the event of unexpected noise or movements. Children (aged 12 and under) in or near these spaces pose a risk to the salon for OHS and for insurance reasons.\n  \u2022 We have a waiting area in our salon space, however it is not encouraged to leave children (aged 12 and under) unattended in this area. Please consider supervision for all children in this area. Loud noises in the waiting area or treatment rooms is unacceptable.\n  \u2022 If children must attend an appointment with you and require Ipads, phones, etc they must have headphones or no sound. Again this is important for the concentration of our therapist and the respect of other customers.\n  \u2022 Please contact us if you have any queries or concerns regarding our Children Policy.\n\nPrivacy Policy | Last updated 05\/04\/2020\n\nWe, at Bang Bang Beauty Bar, respect the privacy of our clients and users of this site.
