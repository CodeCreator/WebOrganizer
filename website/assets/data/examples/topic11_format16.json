        "text":"Game Providers\n\nIt remains the fact of the matter that the game providers themselves shape the entire casino experience. No matter how good the extra facilities that are being provided may be, the entertainment itself is derived purely from the quality, thrill and fun of the games. It is for this very reason that Spinsify UK makes sure to select only the very best game providers of the industry, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. There are a number of features that we particularly look out for when it comes to selecting our game providers.\n\nOf these, one of the key components is the age of the casino itself, with Spinsify\u00a0giving preference to new ones. Now, this may sound illogical to our customers as experience masters all, but we have our reasons for this. This is because new casinos dish out extravagant gaming bonuses in a bid to radiate from the intense competition in the market.\n\nWhat is more, the newer the casino, the more up to date they are with the trends and features of the time, offering fun gaming opportunities, quirks and bonuses all in an attempt to lure in more customers.\n\nMoreover, we make sure that all of our game providers are certified, with them possessing authentic licenses to maximize the security situation of the entire process. Additionally, gaming licenses provide greater insight into much more than just security. They also reflect on the range of gaming options up for selection, the bonuses being offered, the validity and integrity of their terms and conditions and even the payment options they accept.\n\nLastly, we strive to ensure that all of our game providers are mobile compatible as this provides our users with greater mobility and flexibility in the entirety of their fun game playing experience.",

They're designed to fold and unfold without damage, so they're totally portable, and store in a very small space. When the game's over, just fold 'em up and go!\n\nThis set continues the Cardboard Heroes tradition of great miniatures and accessories at a low price. Each set gives you four towers and four walls (plus assorted castle goodies) - set them up as a full castle or two smaller strongpoints. And you can add sets to make your fortress the envy of the surrounding kingdoms!\n\nWhile supplies last, every Walls and Towers set purchased from Warehouse 23 will be accompanied by two sheets of hoardings to cover the towers.",
