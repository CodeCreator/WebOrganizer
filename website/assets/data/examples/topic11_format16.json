        "text":"Goal Bonanza\n\nGoal Bonanza is a blockchain technology that aims to disrupt the $3 trillion global betting industry. Find out how it works today in our Goal Bonanza review.\n\nWhat Is Goal Bonanza?\n\nGoal Bonanza, found online at GoalBonanza.com, is a self-regulating, blockchain-powered football (soccer) betting platform based on ERC20 tokens.\n\nThe platform aims to offer a fresh and new football betting experience using lottery-like crowd betting. The crowd bets on 10 possible final score outcomes. Based on how much money is bet, the crowd drives the potential returns. Goal Bonanza doesn\u2019t set the odds themselves. They let the crowd set the returns based on which scores are most and least popular.\n\nOverall, Goal Bonanza aims to offer a better betting experience than traditional bookmakers and betting exchanges, which offer unattractive odds and low returns. The bigger the crowd, the bigger the potential returns will be.\n\nGoal Bonanza\u2019s whitepaper describes one example of how their platform could be used for exciting gambling opportunities:\n\n\u201cImagine $100,000+ in returns on $1 bets by successfully predicting the final score of a football game out of 10 possible outcomes.\u201d\n\nHow Does Goal Bonanza Work?\n\nGoal Bonanza\u2019s basic process involves users choosing football scores from 10 possible options. You can choose a 0-0 draw, for example, a 1-0 home win, a 0-1 away win, and other combinations. Or, you can choose the \u201cGoal Bonanza\u201d option, where you pick any other final score.\n\nYou can choose from competitions in most major football leagues and competitions, including the EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Eredivisie, Liga, Liga Do Brasil, Argentina Primera Division A, CSL, FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2020, EUFA Champions League, EUFA Europa League, and COPA Bridgestone Libertadores.\n\nIn addition to this system, Goal Bonanza will apply gamification mechanics to engage and motivate users to play in order to win rewards, badges, and points. These symbols are used to elevate the player\u2019s status and privilege while showing their talents, expertise, and accomplishments.\n\nOverall, these systems are designed to tap into \u201cbasic desires and needs of users\u2019 impulses which revolve around the idea of profits, status, achievement, competition, and community collaboration.\u201d\n\nThe ecosystem revolves around an ERC20-compliant digital token built on Ethereum. Goal Bonanza doesn\u2019t require the use of fiat currency. That means it\u2019s outside the legal jurisdiction of gambling regulatory bodies, and it\u2019s considered a non-regulated stateless business.\n\nBy year 3, Goal Bonanza has an oddly specific earnings target: the company claims they\u2019ll reach a total of 6.34 million active players and generate earnings of $74.9 million.\n\nWhat Types Of Problems Does Goal Bonanza Seek To Solve?\n\nGoal Bonanza aims to solve the following problems in the betting world:\n\nLicensing And Compliance:\n\nMany gambling websites consistently struggle to remain compliant and regulated. Goal Bonanza is a stateless, non-regulated cryptocurrency platform that is not subject to any regulatory or licensing requirements.\n\nUnique Customer Proposition:\n\nMost betting platforms offer the same basic betting experience. Goal Bonanza aims to attract users with a unique feature \u2013 like picking football scores from 10 possible outcomes.\n\nLack Of Privacy:\n\nIdentity verification requires substantial personally identifiable information, including forms of identification, credit cards, and bank account details. Goal Bonanza allows users to play without any type of identification. There are also no records of deposits or withdrawals.\n\nLow Returns:\n\nBetting platforms provide low returns and unattractive odds designed to favor bookmakers and the house. Goal Bonanza doesn\u2019t set the odds and potential returns \u2013 the players do. That means the bigger the crowd, the bigger your returns will be.\n\nThe Goal Bonanza ICO\n\nThe Goal Bonanza pre-ICO is scheduled for October 1 to October 31. During the pre-ICO, 1 ETH = 15,000 GOAL tokens.\n\nThere will be 5 rounds of the main ICO, with each round lasting 6 days. The ICO is scheduled for November 1 to November 30. The base rate for tokens during the ICO will be 1 ETH = 5,000 tokens.\n\nWho\u2019s Behind Goal Bonanza?\n\nGoal Bonanza is led by founding partner Veljko Ristic, CTO Jon Santillan, and Chief Advisor Jacob Lopez.\n\nThe company was founded in 2017 and lists its headquarters in Makati, Manila, Philippines.\n\nGoal Bonanza Conclusion\n\nGoal Bonanza aims to change the world of football (soccer) betting using a decentralized gambling platform. That platform involves picking football scores from a range of 10 different options, or clicking the \u201cGoal Bonanza\u201d button to choose a score from outside of those 10 options. There are no odds \u2013 the crowd sets the odds by choosing the most and least likely scores for any particular match.\n\nTo learn more about Goal Bonanza and the ongoing ICO, visit online today at GoalBonanza.com.\n\n[FREE] Get Our Best Crypto Trading, Mining & Investing Hacks:\n\n*Action Required* Enter Your Email To Get Insight For Trending Coin News & Reviews\n\nI will never give away, trade or sell your email address.

It is the successor corporation to Colt's earlier firearms-making efforts since 1836. Colt is known for the engineering, production, and marketing of firearms, most especially between the 1850s and World War I, when it was a dominating force in its industry and a seminal influence on manufacturing technology. Colt's earliest designs played a major role in the popularization of the revolver and the shift away from earlier single-shot pistols. Although Samuel Colt did not invent the revolver concept, his designs resulted in the first very successful ones.The most famous Colt products include the Colt Walker, made 1847 in the facilities of Eli Whitney Jr., the Single Action Army or Peacemaker, the Colt Python, and the Colt M1911 pistol, which is currently the longest-standing military and law enforcement service handgun in the world and is still used today. Though they did not develop it, for a long time Colt was also primarily responsible for all AR-15 and M16 rifle production, as well as many derivatives of those firearms. The most successful and famous of these are numerous M16 carbines, including the Colt Commando family, and the M4 carbine.\n\n\n  \u2022 Fully licensed by Colt, the maker of the longest-standing military & law enforcement service handgun\n  \u2022 Full metal serrated slide, barrel, and frame\n  \u2022 Detachable full metal magazine\n  \u2022 Takes conventional 12g CO2 magazines\n  \u2022 Working on-frame beaver-tail safety, hammer, magazine release button\n  \u2022 Integrated hopup unit for maximum range\n  \u2022 1:1 scale authentic replica\n  \u2022 Fixed Front and Rear Sights\n  \u2022 340~360 FPS high power output with dead-on accuracy\n  \u2022 Realistic hard kick blowback action\nDimensions: 225mm x 140mm\nMuzzle Velocity: 340~360 FPS (Measured w\/ 0.20g BBs and CO2 Magazine)\nMagazine: 17rds\nGas Type: 12g CO2 Cartridge\nFiring Mode: Semi Automatic, Safety\nSystem: Gas Blowback\nHopup: Yes, Adjustable\nPackage Includes: Gun, Magazine, and Manual\n\nManufacturer: Cybergun (Licensed by Colt).

It has a satisfying weight to it and the controls are pretty comfortable. I can operate every feature both wearing and not wearing gloves. It has a very crisp blowback action that kicks about as much as a real steel .22lr handgun, which is very nice for an airsoft gun. I also bought two additional magazines and they work just as well as the one that the gun came with. If I don't do a lot of rapid shooting I can get 4+ 17rd magazines off before the CO2 cartridge runs out as long as I give the mag roughly 30 seconds of warming up in my hand after reloading it each time. If I shoot quickly, it easily holds enough gas for 2-3+ full loads. Speaking of capacity, I think that 17 rounds is just about right for a sidearm. When you compare it to the real 1911's capacity of only 7 rounds there really is a big difference. Sadly extra mags are a bit costly, but they are gas mags after all. I like that this gun is styled after the M1911A1 that the U.S. used in WWII up until the 80's, and the Colt trademarks make it great for themed matches of that time period. I have however noticed that the finish on the metal is a bit thin and is easily prone to scratching as I learned when using my first holster, a plastic one. It left some rubbing marks on the slide but this is purely cosmetic. That may still be a con for some, though. Personally, I think that the wearing adds character to the weapon. I have not tried to remove the orange tip and I do not plan to do so. I have not chrono'ed this gun but I did notice that while playing in an outdoor match it was not able to penetrate through thick brush and hit a target about 15 yards away, but shooting at a man-sized target without cover I can easily hit my mark from that distance. Realistically speaking, that's pretty much all you're probably going to be using a sidearm for anyway. The iron sights are not bad for an airsoft gun, but not the greatest at distance either, however when firing rapidly and watching the path of your bb's it looks like you're shooting a laser out of your gun. As an added bonus, this gun even field strips pretty realistically. I don't think I will ever be replacing this gun as my main sidearm, but if it ever broke for some odd reason I would buy another in a heartbeat. Overall I believe that this is a fantastic airsoft gun and it is one of if not THE BEST of the airsoft 1911's on the market. If you are looking for a durable, reliable sidearm that could also be used for themed matches or re-enactments, look no further.\n\n-Feels very nice in the hand, pleasant weight and ease of use\n-Very nice, hard kick for an airsoft gun\n-CO2 lasts a decent amount of time, especially when not shooting rapidly\n-Decent capacity\n-Classic design with COLT TRADEMARKS good for themed matches\/re-enacting\n-Finish scratches easily and gives a weathered look (may not be a pro)\n-Reasonably accurate\n-Very reliable\n-Field stripping is realistic\n\n-Additional magazines are expensive.\n-Finish scratches easily and gives a weathered look (may not be a con)\n-Will not punch through thick cover but it's an airsoft gun for crying out loud\n-Doesn't shoot .45 ACP\n\nIn my humble opinion the pros certainly outweigh the cons, so do yourself a favor and get your hands on one of these bad boys.\nby devyn m. on 07\/01\/2016\n\"I bought this gun (used) at a local shop. This is the best pistol I have ever owned. I have had it for 2years and have NEVER had any problems with it\n\nThe most acrate gun ever 60 ft +\n\n\n\nby Kai R. on 06\/23\/2016\n\"This is my favorite airsoft gun of all time, it really does justice to it's real life WW2 counterpart. It has a beautiful finish, which gets a nice battle hardened look after lots of use. Since it is CO2, it requires a lot of lubricant to keep it working properly without breaking. Make sure before buying this that you have good knowledge of where to lubricate CO2 guns, not lubricating it properly will shorten it's life span significantly. It has pretty good kick, for an airsoft gun. The way the gun handles is very close to a real gun, having to rack the slide upon inserting a magazine, combined with the kick makes it a real joy to fire. I don't have a chronograph, so in terms of FPS all I can say is that it is not really felt at all if wearing jeans. Accuracy is pretty good for a handgun, but it isn't pinpoint like non-blowback co2 guns. But from my point of view, that adds to the realism. Hop-up is rather easy to adjust, but requires field stripping to do. I have not had a chance to use it in a game, but I'm quite sure it would be able to challenge other handguns quite well.\n\nHeres a summary of the pros and cons:\n\n-Very Realistic\n-Beautiful finish that gets nice wear after a lot of use.\n-Good kick for an airsoft gun\n-Low enough FPS to get into most fields\n-Requires a lot of care, making it not so good for newer airsofters.\n\nQuestions, Answers and Comments\n\nDiscuss about Colt 100th Anniversary Licensed Full Metal M1911 A1 Airsoft CO2 GBB by KWC (350 FPS Version) with your friends and fellow shoppers!\n\nComment or answer questions for a chance to win awesome prizes.
