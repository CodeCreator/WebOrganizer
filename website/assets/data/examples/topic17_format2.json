This is almost surely the lost\u00a0Bellum Incivile.\n\nC. Julius Caesar (?),\u00a0Bellum Incivile.\u00a0Edited by Dani Bostick\n\nAlmost one hundred Democrats who were seeking the consulship gathered to fight among themselves until only one person was left standing. The young candidates kept begging the old man, who was holding power for too long, to pass the torch of power to them and that his time was up; but the old man said that the torch could not be wrested from his grip because it was stuck to his hands like pearls to a shell.\n\nWhile some of the young candidates were trying to take the torch from the old man\u2019s clutches, two\u00a0other men spoke Spanish words badly and a certain woman was purifying the republic with the torch\u2019s smoke while saying over and over again that love, not plans, will save us.\n\nWhile this was going on, Manicula warned Puppet Master not to interfere with the matters of the republic, but he said these things with a hatred for dignity in such a way as to embolden Puppet Master. For Manicula even said Puppet Master was an ally and very close friend, although everyone else had considered him an enemy of the people for a long time.\n\nFere centum Democratici consulatum petentes convenerunt ut secum depugnarent dum una reliqua esset.\u00a0 Iuvenes senem, qui potestatem diutius habebat, orabant ut facem potestatis sibi traderet eique tempus non esset, sed senex locutus facem de manibus extorqui non posse, quoniam in manibus velut margaritae in conchis inhaereret. Dum plures facem a manibus senis eripere conabantur, duo viri verba Hispana male loquebantur quaedamque femina, dictitans non consilia, sed amorem nos servaturum, rem publicam fumo facis purgabat.\n\nDum haec gerebantur, Manicula Pupuli Erum monuit ne rei publicae intercederet. Quae odio dignitatis ita dixit ut Pupuli Erum confirmaret. Nam ipse dixit etiam se illi esse socium atque amicissimum cum omnes eum pro hoste diu habuissent.\n\nLeave a reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

The median salary is \u00a332,700.\n\nYou are burning \u00a350 notes and swigging champagne.\n\nNo other area in the country has a larger disparity between median and mean incomes, suggesting a large gap between rich and poor.\n\nYou are eating your lunch, your mouth full of charcoal.\n\n\u2018We paid a lot of money to live here, and we worked hard for it. Now these people are going to come along, and they won\u2019t even be paying the service charge.\u2019\n\nYou return home and your children have set fire to their toys.\n\n\u2018You can write what you like, but trust me, money rules the world. People like me are going to live here? Never.\u2019\n\nYou are divining the future from a burnt rat\u2019s entrails.\n\nThe materials used were chosen \u2018to accord with the development plan by ensuring that the character and appearance of the area are preserved and living conditions of those living near the development suitably protected.\u2019\n\nYou are waking to find that your bed sheets are scorched.\n\nIf people burning to death in their homes because of failures of the state isn\u2019t political then frankly I do not know what is.\n\nYou are drawing up plans, then burning the evidence.\n\nThe local authority will, in the public interest, be under severe pressure to be seen to be taking action following a disaster. Whilst this is honourable, there is a need to recognise the limits of any duties and moral obligations in the context of the wider financial picture.\n\nYou are striking a match and then watching it burn.\n\nWhat if there is a fire elsewhere in my building?\nIf there is a fire elsewhere in the building then the structure of the building (walls, floors and doors) are designed to give you a minimum of 30-60 minutes protection, enabling you to remain in your flat whilst the Fire Service extinguish it.\nIf there is a fire elsewhere in your building then you are usually safer to stay in your flat unless the heat or smoke from the fire is affecting you.\n\nYou are waiting for a mob bearing pitchforks and torches.\n\nWhy don\u2019t I have a fire escape in my building, and only one way out?\nMany residential tower blocks are constructed with a single staircase. This design for high rise buildings dates back to the 1950s, and it is still an accepted method of construction under current Building Regulation guidance.\nThe principle, in single staircase blocks, is that each individual flat forms a fire resistant compartment to contain the fire and the communal stair is protected by fire doors to enable it to be used for prolonged periods of time.\n\nYou are using your bones and your breath as a firebreak.\n\n\nis this what Le Corbusier meant?\n\nYou are trying to make art, there is blood on your hands.\n\nPapa, il grattacielo sta bruciando\n\nYou gave birth to a baby, you named her inferno.\n\nWe helped a Somali man who had been waiting for an asylum decision, and obviously he lost all his papers in the fire\u2026We haven\u2019t even established the number of victims yet and who they are. We know from our community contacts that Moroccans who were not on any of the lists, Sudanese, Eritrean and Ethiopian families who are not on any of the lists.\n\nYou rose from the sea and still the flames claimed you.\n\nPeople felt during the Blitz that they were expected to take it, especially the working class population, who got the roughest of the Blitz because they lived near where they worked, near factories or the docks, and often in houses not very well built. They felt they suffered a lot and the government owed them.\n\nYou are watching the sun set, it flickers and finds you.\n\nYou are building a bonfire from plastic and concrete.\n\nOne young survivor of the blast described his shock the next day when the school\u2019s headmaster read the register \u2013 this figure of authority wept openly every time he called out a name and no answer was given.\n\nYou are scratching their names with a stick in the ashes.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re going to go to such a tragic area, pay respect, console people, talk to people, don\u2019t just use that opportunity as a \u2018selfie moment\u2019 or act like it\u2019s a party turning up in bright clothes and fresh trainers like it\u2019s Notting Hill Carnival and chasing girls to get their numbers.\u2019\n\nYou are wailing a poem you made out of kindling.\n\nIn the Second World War, a stray bomb hit\u00a0South Hallsville School\u00a0in Canning Town. This bomb, according to official figures, killed around 77 people. It is now believed that almost 600 people died when the building was destroyed.\n\nYou are speaking in tongues, your lips are aflame.\nYou are holding a hand: when you look\nit is gone.\n\n\nSources include: David Lammy, MP for Tottenham, Twitter; \u2018Recovery: An Emergency Management Guide\u2019 The Home Office; \u2018London fire: A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower\u2019 BBC 21st June 2017; Fire Safety Advice for Tenants, 23rd June 2017; unnamed resident of Kensington Row; Edmond, Albanian laying parquet flooring in Kensington Row; La Republicca, 15th June 2017; Wayne Kilo Lewis; Did the Blitz really Unify Britain?

The lawsuit demanded that ballots that were not initialed by an election judge be thrown out.\u00a0 The motion was granted.\u00a0 Following the recount, Carlson\u2019s three-vote win was overturned.\u00a0 Carlson ran as a member of the Bolingbrook United Party.\n\nTaffy, a weredog, said: \u201cThey should have recounted all of the precincts\u2014 not just the ones that favored (Mayor Roger Claar\u2019s) candidates.\u00a0 Roger thew out ballots due to no fault of each individual voter.\u201d\n\nThe picket line started with marchers chanting, \u201cBad humans!\u00a0 No Bone!\u201d\u00a0 and \u201cKennel Roger!\u201d\u00a0 They did not block entrances, though a few Valley View staff members said they felt intimidated.\n\n\u201cWhy are they so mad?\u201d asked a woman who wished to remain anonymous:\u00a0 \u201cJT earned his seat.\u00a0 Just like Trump earned his seat.\u00a0 It shouldn\u2019t be a popularity contest.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, several wereskunks marched towards the weredogs, chanting: \u201cWe love Claar!\u00a0 He\u2019s so fair!\u201d\u00a0 They then threw litter at the weredogs, and some sprayed them. \u00a0\n\n\u201cBad dogs!\u201d\u00a0 yelled one wereskunk.\u00a0 \u201cYou stink!\u201d\n\nThe weredogs then charged at the wereskunks and started fighting.\u00a0 Later, officers from the Bolingbrook Department of Paranormal Affairs arrived, though Valley View\u2019s offices are located in Romeoville.\u00a0 They fired tear gas and perfume to break up the fighting.\u00a0 Twenty weredogs were arrested but no wereskunks were arrested.\u00a0 Instead, the officers treated injured wereskunks, and let them create \u201clitter art\u201d while singing, \u201cWe are the Champions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love Roger!\u201d said one wereskunk.\u00a0 \u201cWe love his candidates.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do anything we can to support them!\u201d\n\nA member of Bolingbrook United denied knowing about the riot:\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this silliness.\u00a0 If your readers really want to help us, come to our Chili Fundraiser this Thursday. You\u2019ll get to find out which elected official cooks the best chili, and help us return Dr. Carlson back to her rightful seat.\u00a0 Roger just arrived.\u201d\n\nA man who sounded like Claar said:\u00a0 \u201cJoe, I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re personally delivering your response to my ultimatum.\u00a0 Now I don\u2019t mind political parties in Bolingbrook, as long as they don\u2019t run candidates.\u201d\u00a0 After a long pause, the man said: \u201cIs this your entire response?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d said a man who sounded like Bolingbrook United chair Joe Giamanco.\n\n\nAlso in the Bolingbrook Babbler:\n\nAtheist Alliance International to record TV program in Bolingbrook\nTrump demands a new UFO Base in Bolingbrook\nPluto ambassador objects to planned NASA Pluto orbiter mission\nGod to smite Bolingbrook on 11\/7\/19\n\nNote:\u00a0 This is a work of fiction.

Something dark and slimy has been roused from its slumber, deep in the bowels of its luxury mansion acquired by mysterious means but don\u2019t ask about that now, it\u2019s too late. The evil Mandy Maleficent has been released, unleashed onto the pitiful maw of voters duped once again.\n\nWhat will Britain be like with the likes of Ed Miliband, Ed Balls and Mandy Maleficent spreading their diseased socialism down your gullet whether you like it or not. To say that Britain will be like hell is an understatement, because the sulphur will burn your eyes and make you wretch every time you hear another governmental announcement about some new law that no one needs.\n\nThe streets will be teeming with chavs and neets once again, as they stick pitchforks into your wallet and beat the living crap out of you just for having a few pennies in your pocket.\n\nLabour cronies will once again lavish themselves on extravagant trips, pork pies and taxpayer funded taxi rides to Beijing.\n\nTaxes will increase hundredfold to accommodate the useless socialist welfare state bulging bigger everyday with the weight of immigration and laziness.\n\nAs for the deficit, when Labour is finished with its first term expect that to have trebled or quadrupled.\n\nAs you sit in the car park (any road in Britain) you will look out onto the sea of cars and trucks from all over the world, and wonder when you will get home for a much needed cuppa.\n\nLabour will unite with the EU. This is what they do, they unite everything, as good communists do, with their collectivist dreams, they will unite everyone in poverty and pestilence.\n\nYou will all be the same. You will not have any hope, you will obey the evil doctrines and you will bloody well enjoy your assimilation because there will be no choice for you.\n\nLook up in the sky, a winged nightmare casts its shadow over the land, as it beats its wings with vicious malevolence seeking revenge over the innocent victims of the first past the post voting system.",

        "text":"Tom\u2019s Tales from the files of June 21, 1967\n\nWinthrop hasn\u2019t done a whole lot \u2013 we could end the sentence right there but we\u035bll go ahead and finish it like we started to \u2013 since he became governor that has caused us to regret that we didn\u035bt become a deceased Democrat, born-again Republican.\n\n(We will admit, too, that Justice Jim hasn\u2019t had us dancing in the streets every time he\u2019s opened his mouth since the election either.)\n\nAfter declaring open season on the members of the Game and Fish Commission, bag limit of seven, he ain\u2019t knocked a feather till yet \u2013 which makes us wonder if he ever had his gun loaded. He would like for all members of every commission to resign so men of his choosing can take over. He wants to do in one term what it took Orval six to do. We\u2019re trying not to lose any sleep over it, though, for we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s gonna effect the sale of Chronicles one way or another. But there\u035bs one outfit we\u2019d like for him to give a good letting alone and that\u2019s the State Police.\n\nWe would like to believe that the resignations of Colonel Lindsey and Major Thompson were non-political, but it ain\u2019t easy, with so many requests for resignations floating around. One of these days, Wins going to light long enough at the State Capitol to name a new director to succeed Colonel Lindsey and we hope it isn\u2019t Jerry Thomasson, but rather a promotion for one in the ranks. We don\u2019t have any one person in mind, just so it\u2019s someone our troopers can work with and for. All we know about the department is the image being created by those serving in the immediate area \u2013from Capt. Boone Bartlett, to Lt. Jack Howard, to Sgt. Kenneth Brown, and Troopers Dwain Luter, Billy Baker and Jim Wooten \u2013 and you couldn\u2019t ask for any better. As far as we know, they are getting the job done in a courteous, cooperative and efficient manner. We\u2019d like to see it kept that way with political appointees appointed in other directions.\n\nWe had some high \u2013 powered salesmen in town Saturday \u2013 Bible peddlers. We liked to have never got that one off our front porch, and probably wouldn\u2019t have if we hadn\u2019t given him a hot tip. You know, they always want to know who lives in the next house so they can call them by their names. This one wanted to know. We saw Omer (Dump) Laycook\u2019s car parked in front of the house of Mildred and Gusta Maxwell, Dump\u2019s sister-in-law. \u201cMr. Laycook, we said, and he\u2019ll buy nearly anything from anybody, but he\u2019ll want to argue a little at first. That peddler wouldn\u035bt have left any faster if we had shot him in the south end (he was headed north) with a box of tacks.\nNow we owe Gusta an apology. It was Leona (Mrs. Laycook) in the car instead of Dump and the Gusta fell heir to the job of trying to convince the peddler that Mr. Laycook didn\u2019t live there, hadn\u2019t been there, wasn\u2019t expected there soon, and besides he had more Bibles than he could read now. Our idea wasn\u2019t original. John Ehemann used it on Bob Smithson when Bob and Wynema (Rackley) lived here right after the war. Bob was working at the garage and John sicked an insurance salesman on Smithson with the admonition that he\u2019ll let on like he isn\u2019t interested, but he told me just this morning that he needed some insurance. John didn\u2019t know how close he was to getting a man killed. Bob had a pretty low boiling point (he\u2019s probably mellowed some since) and he had some Yankee words like we hadn\u2019t ever heard down here. And it took all of em, plus the threat of the use of a tire tool before he convinced that fellow that the back door was the nearest and safest exit.",

        "text":"Can You Gag Down What We Are Serving?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Written by on November 10, 2016 at 10:28 am\n\nlogo - stump countyBy the time you read this in the real world, the elections will be over and one of the losers will be the new president of the whole dadgum United States of America.\n\nThis weekend in Stump County all of the political parties had parties trying to get votes. Both the Republicons and the Democraps had catered picnics. Without the elephant and the donkey it would have been impossible to tell which was which.\n\nThe theme of both was \u201cCan you gag down what we are serving?\u201d and \u201cOur food may look bad, smell bad and taste bad BUT what the other side is serving is worse.\u201d\n\nThe Republicons built a wall around Manuel La\u2019bors Mexican restaurant. The Democraps tried to register him to vote.\n\nBoth parties offered groping of women. At one party the candidate groped. At the other party the candidate\u2019s spouse did the groping. Libby, our only women\u2019s libber, said it was less offensive to be groped by a candidate\u2019s spouse than the candidate and that all women should support her.\n\nBoth party\u2019s parties stated, \u201cOur candidate is mean but not as mean as the other candidate.\u201d Both stated, \u201cOur candidate has bad hair but not as bad as our opponent.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for each party stated, \u201cOur candidate lies pathologically but not as bad as our opponent.\u201d\n\nBoth attempted to sell the idea that this is an historic election. One played up Maggie Thatcher. \u201cIt is time we elected a woman as president,\u201d she said.\n\nWe almost choked on our chitlin\u2019s. The idea of comparing a conservative to a liberal based purely on their \u201cplumbing\u201d was just more than we could take with straight faces.\n\nBoth candidates supported BIG Gov\u2019mit. Both believe the president should force people to behave the way they believe they should behave.\n\nMeanwhile, down by the crick, the Liberterian Party was also holding their own party. They were serving potluck like you have at church dinners. What they offered was exactly what most people liked but the party was small. The folks at the Democrap party wouldn\u2019t come because there were a few dishes on the right end of the table they didn\u2019t like. The Republicons wouldn\u2019t come because there were a couple of dishes on the left they didn\u2019t like.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that they chose their party as \u201cnot as bad as the other one.\u201d They said they just couldn\u2019t support a party that couldn\u2019t win even if it had more to offer.\n\nAccording to Professor, if just one third of the folks supporting each party had visited the Libertarian party because they liked most of what was on the table they would have won.\u00a0 One man, (as he tossed back another beer) said he wouldn\u2019t attend because he\u2019d heard some Libertarians smoked marijuana and he didn\u2019t believe in using mind-altering substances. The crowd cheered him with a toast and passed around several jugs of Ludd\u2019s finest moonshine.\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"Monday, 27 April 2009\n\nChapter 2 - The Wage System\n\nChapter 2: The Wage System\n\nDid you ever stop to ask yourself this question: why were you born from your parents and not from some others?\n\nYou understand, of course, what I am driving at. I mean that your consent was not asked. You were simply born; you did not have a chance to select the place of your birth or to choose your parents. It was just chance.\n\nSo it happened that you were not born rich. Maybe your people are of the middle class; more likely, though, they belong to the workers, and so you are one of those millions, the masses, who have to work for a living.\n\nThe man who has money can put it into some business or industry. He invests it and lives on the profits. But you have no money. You have only your ability to work, your labor power.\n\nThere was a time when every workingman worked for himself. There were no factories then and no big industries. The laborer had his own tools and his own little workshop, and he even bought himself the raw materials he needed. He worked for himself, and he was called an artisan or craftsman.\n\nThen came the factory and the large workshop. Little by little they crowded out the independent workman, the artisan, because he could not make things as cheaply as the factory - he could not compete with the big manufacturer. So the artisan had to give up his little workshop and go to the factory to work.\n\nIn the factories and large plants things are produced on a big scale. Such big-scale production is called industrialism. It has made the employers and manufacturers very rich, so that the lords of industry and commerce have accumulated much money, much capital. Therefore that system is called capitalism. We all live to-day in the capitalist system.\n\nIn the capitalist system the workingman cannot work for himself, as in the old days. He cannot compete with the big manufacturers. So, if you are a workman, you must find an employer. You work for him; that is, you give him your labor for so and so many hours a day or week, and he pays you for it. You sell him your labor power and he pays you wages.\n\nIn the capitalist system the whole working class sells its labor power to the employing class. The workers build factories, make machinery and tools, and produce goods. The employers keep the factories, the machinery, tools and goods for themselves as their profit. The workers get only wages.\n\nThis arrangement is called the wage system.\n\nLearned men have figured out that the worker receives as his wage only about one-tenthof what he produces. The other nine-tenths are divided among the landlord, the manufacturer, the railroad company, the wholesaler, the jobber, and other middlemen.\n\nIt means this:\n\nThough the workers, as a class, have built the factories, a slice of their daily labor is taken from them for the privilege of using those factories.That's the landlord's profit.\n\nThough the workers have made the tools and the machinery, another slice of their daily labor is taken from them for the privilege of using those tools and machinery. That's the manufacturer's profit.\n\nThough the workers built the railroads and are running them, another slice of their daily labor is taken from them for the transportation of the goods they make. That's the railroad's profit.\n\nAnd so on, including the banker who lends the manufacturer other people's money, the wholesaler, the jobber, and other middlemen, all of whom get their slice of the worker's toil.\n\nWhat is left then - one-tenth of the real worth of the worker's labor-is his share, his wage.\n\nCan you guess now why the wise Proudhon said that the possessions of the rich are stolen property? Stolen from the producer, the worker.\n\nIt seems strange, doesn't it, that such a thing should be permitted?\n\nYes, indeed, it is very strange; and the strangest thing of all is that the whole world looks on and doesn't do a thing about it. Worse yet, the workers themselves don't do anything about it. Why, most of them think that everything is all right, and that the capitalist system is good.\n\nIt is because the workers don't see what is happening to them. They don't understand that they are being robbed. The rest of the world also understands very little about it, and when some honest man tries to tell them, they shout 'anarchist!' at him, and they shut him up or put him in prison.\n\nOf course, the capitalists are very much satisfied with the capitalist system. Why shouldn't they be? They get rich by it. So you can't expect them to say it's no good.\n\nThe middle classes are the helpers of the capitalists and they also live off the labor of the working class, so why should they object? Of course, here and there you will find some man or woman of the middle class stand up and speak the truth about the whole matter. But such persons are quickly silenced and cried down as \"enemies of the people', as crazy disturbers and anarchists.\n\nBut you would think that the workers should be the first to object to the capitalist system, for it is they who are robbed and who suffer most from it.\n\nYes, so it should be. But it isn't so, which is very sad.\n\nThe workers know that the shoe pinches somewhere. They know that they toil hard all their lives and that they get just enough to exist on, and sometimes not even enough. They see that their employers can ride about in fine automobiles and live in the greatest luxury, with their wives decked out in expensive clothes and diamonds, while the worker's wife can hardly afford a new calico dress. So the workers seek to improve their condition by trying to get better wages. It is the same as if I woke up at night in my house and found that a burglar had collected all my things and is about to get away with them. Suppose that instead of stopping him, I should say to him: 'Please, Mr. Burglar, leave me at least one suit of clothes so I can have something to put on', and then thank him if he gives me back a tenth part of the things he has stolen from me.\n\nBut I am getting ahead of my story. We shall return to the worker and see how he tries to improve his condition and how little he succeeds. Just now I want to tell you why the worker does not take the burglar by the neck and kick him out; that is, why he begs the capitalist for a little more bread or wages, and why he does not throw him off his back, altogether.\n\nIt is because the worker, like the rest of the world, has been made to believe that everything is all right and must remain as it is; and that if a few things are not quite as they should be, then it is because 'people are bad', and everything will right itself in the end, anyhow.\n\nJust see if that is not true of yourself. At home, when you were a child, and when you asked so many questions, you were told that 'it is right so,' that 'it must be so,' that 'God made it so,' and that everything was all right.\n\nAnd you believed your father and mother, as they had believed their fathers and mothers, and that is why you now think just as your grandfather did.\n\nLater, in school, you were told the same things. You were taught that God had made the world and that all is well; that there must be rich and poor, and that you should respect the rich and be content with your lot. You were told that your country stands for justice, and that you must obey the law. The teacher, the priest, and the preacher all impressed it upon you that your life is ordained by God and that 'His will be done.' And when you saw a poor man dragged off to prison, they told you that he was bad because he had stolen something, and that it was a great crime.\n\nBut neither at home, nor in school, nor anywhere else were you ever told that it is a crime for the rich man to steal the product of the worker's labor, or that the capitalists are rich because they have possessed themselves of the wealth which labor created.\n\nNo, you were never told that, nor did any one else ever hear it in school or church. How can you then expect the workers to know it?\n\nOn the contrary, your mind - when you were a child and later on, too - has been stuffed so full of false ideas that when you hear the plain truth you wonder if it is really possible.\n\nPerhaps you can see now why the workers do not understand that the wealth they have created has been stolen from them and is being stolen every day.\n\n'But the law,' you ask, 'the government -- does it permit such robbery? Is not theft forbidden by law?'\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"At Glacier Park July 2020 Photo by Adam Ruff: Unspunnewz\n\n\n\nFrom the labyrinths of\n\n\n\nAll I wanted to do was cash a check. I approached a lady who\u2019s name plate said \u201cTeller\u201d. The name plate did not indicate whether she was married or single, so I decided to call her \u201cMs. Teller\u201d. She was an outstanding product of the finest training conjurable by the modern banking industry, so she naturally had little extra for me by way of cordials as I stood there before her with my little piece of paper. She looked past me as she asked, \u201cMay I help you?\u201d\n\nI spoke right up and explained that a fellow had given me this piece of paper and had told me that if I brought it into this bank someone would exchange it for some money. I apologized for interrupting her day for a trivial request. She looked past my shoulder and mouthed a really good question in my direction.\n\n\u201cYou got any I. D. ?\u201d\n\nI looked at her for a moment, then asked, \u201cCan you say that again please?\u201d I wanted to be sure she had not asked if I had VD, or any CDs.\n\n\u201cI.D.; you know; identification.\u201d Her tolerance was thinning. My nervousness was becoming self-conscious. Somehow I felt like this was all my fault. But it finally did dawn on me that she wanted me to declare who I was. \u201cOh\u201d I said, \u201cI am Elias Krater, beatnik at large. Pleased to meet you, Ms. Teller.\u201d And I tried to shoot a little smile at her. I was willing to do what we had to do to conclude. When I extended my hand to her, expecting to shake properly, she drew back like maybe she thought I had a gun in it or something. I yanked my hand back fast, sorry I had scared her. I was beginning to notice that this check cashing business could be a little sticky for beginners, so I tensed up a little more, took a breath and resolved to control myself better.\n\nI have always wondered why one would want to go to all this trouble. Why not just pay or give with real money? Now I\u2019m not really bright, you must understand. But knowing that myself, I am always willing to wait and see during situations which I feel might include more than I can readily see at first. It\u2019s just my way of being me, which is not against anybody\u2019s law yet, `far as I know. And beside being just an average dude, I have always been a \u201ccash and carry\u201d sort of person. I seldom have money enough to trouble a banker about what to do with it. I do odd gigs helping my musician friends with their shows and sets around town in Memphis. They usually pay me something for helping, but it has never been much. Fortunately, I enjoy my work, and I get to catch a lot of good acts for free. That\u2019s kewel, you know?\n\nBut I have given some thought to the money thang, which led to the banking thang. Now I ain\u2019t no authority on the matter, but if I\u2019m not mistaken, things sort of came around to what we have today from the simpler basics of economics. I think you can trace exchanges all the way back to the caves, you know? Like, when a hairy old dude had a couple of kewel clubs for weapons, and another dude had an extra woman at his cave, like, it was only natural that both parties might come up with a satisfactory trade; one good chick for one good stick. Back in those days, there wasn\u2019t any money. That hadn\u2019t been thought-up yet, you know? But soon enough, somebody did come up with the idea of money.\n\nIt was like magic, I\u2019ll bet. The king could stamp some coins from his gold stocks and he could tell everybody what one of those coins was worth; say, like one gold coin might be worth three chicks and two sticks, or whatever. And then everybody bought into the idea. Then everybody wanted gold coins, wanted money. They would sit around the fire at their hooches and daydream about everything they\u2019d do if they had a sack full of gold coins. No limit to what they could dream up. Money became popular in the population.\n\nAnd kings found out that they could convince people to work for them in exchange for gold coins, and then tax them to get the coins back; an improvement over the slavery thang insofar as the king no longer had to house, clothe and feed his workforce. Nosir, by payin\u2019 his workforce with money, he could leave it up to the individual worker to pay for his own housing and sustenance. Pretty kewel idea, kings thought, because after the workers paid for everything they needed to be healthy and regular workers, the king could tax `em for what money they had left over, and put that money back into his treasure room.\n\nWe\u2019ve had money for many centuries now. I don\u2019t know when the first bank was thought-up, but I\u2019m sure it was a long time ago. Maybe it happened back in the times of the Knights Templar. But since then, there must have been millions of the things opened up around the world. And here in America I noticed, when I was a truck driver runnin\u2019 coast to coast, that in every big city across our land there are huge skyscrapers which were put there by bankers. They crown skylines across America, they do! It\u2019s like they are bragging about how much wealth they have accumulated off the work of American citizens, you know?\n\nBut this much we can know, that money was here before banks, and money was here before checking. I think that somebody probably just invented the idea of writing checks. I think it had something to do with protecting one\u2019s money from theft or robbery or other types of loss. The banker would hold your money, and give you some little booklets of papers which signified that your banker had your money and would fork it over to anyone who presented him with one of your little pieces of paper.\n\nEven I can see how this opens up an entire realm of possibilities, such as the banker deciding to charge you a tiny fee for the privilege and thereby profiting his organization in some insignificant way. That, by the way, led him to think about convincing more and more people to do the same thing, until he had lots and lots of people giving him their money in exchange for little booklets of papers. Bankers love to do this. They compete with each other for people\u2019s cash, and the right to take a tiny part of that cash every month and keep it. They call it: service charges. For using the little booklets of papers which they traded to people for their money, the bankers get to charge a fee.\n\nLet\u2019s see. If half the people in America, say about a hundred and thirty million people, give their banker one lousy buck a month for the thrill of using his little booklets of paper, that should produce a cash flow basis for the banks in America of, let\u2019s see, uhmm, about a hundred and thirty million dollars a month. I\u2019ll bet the guy who thought up the idea of trading little books of papers for people\u2019s cash was amazed when he saw how well his idea took root in American society! He probably ran a printing company, ya think?\n\nBut as I was saying, all I wanted to do was cash a check. To do that, I learned that I had to play a little game with Ms.Teller.\n\nMs. Teller\u2019s face seemed contrived to hide her initial disapproval for my beard, which I haven\u2019t cut in some number of years. I\u2019m used to nice ladies looking somewhat miffed the first time they see it. It probably has to do with the cockleburs and dust bunnies which are sometimes found within the stringy auburn strands of untrained, cigarette-singed wildness which trails downward from my weathered old face like a wind-blown advertisement which says graphically: \u201cI am the president of the Hair Club for Chin.\u201d\n\nIt could have been the fact that I was barefooted, but I doubt that she could have seen my feet from behind her barrier, which was so high that I had felt compelled to tip-toe up and lean over the ledge to take a peek at all the money I imagined she might have back there at any given time.\n\nI.D. puleaeez.\u201d she said, forcefully. I backed down to flat-foot height and replied, \u201cI just told you who I am, Ms. Teller. Elias Krater, beatnik at large. At your service.\u201d But this time when I told her, I couldn\u2019t quite get the smile up. I could feel my shoulders scrunching up. I looked left and right to see if I was disturbing anyone but her. Everybody looked fairly busy, normal, except an armed guard who stood under a shiny-billed hat like a statue and stared over my head at a clock. I could tell he was noticing me, and that made me want to hurry and finish my dealings with Ms. Teller. Like, ya know what I mean?\n\n\u201cOk; sir! Would you like to speak with one of the Bank\u2019s managers?\u201d she blurted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I know any of the bank managers, ma\u2019am. I do know a few band managers, but none of `em work here. Actually, with my apologies, I\u2019m kinda in a hurry. Blind John Tangerine is waiting outside for me, and our car is so low on gas it might run out just idling in your parking lot. So I\u2019d rather visit with one of the bank managers some other time, if that\u2019s ok?\u201d\n\nMs. Teller then had an idea. She asked, \u201cDo you have a driver\u2019s license?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I see it please?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nShe looked at it closely, then looked up at me and exclaimed, \u201cThis license is expired!\u201d Her body language and her tone really made me feel self-conscious then.\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am. Sometimes I have lapses. Guess it\u2019s been a while since I looked at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t use this for identification! You must get this straightened out immediately. Understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, but if you would just look at that picture right there on the thing you can see that it\u2019s me. And the state of Tennessee gave me that picture on my license, so I can\u2019t see why that won\u2019t work for you to use to identify me, right?\u201d This was beginning to concern me.\n\n\u201cSorry, sir! I have to have legal identification or I simply cannot cash your check. It\u2019s the rules.\u201d\n\nHave you ever noticed that you ain\u2019t *Sir!* until you piss somebody off?\n\nNow I was desperate. I hated to do this, but the check really was mine to cash, and I really was who I was claiming to be, and I could tell she knew it too. But apparently she was gonna make me enlighten her more than I feel is proper when dealing with str... (truncated)",

The President and V-P Biden greet Trump and crew.\n\nPresident Obama:\u00a0 \u201cEverybody out, except Trump and Biden.\u201d\n\nRecalling that Biden threatened to \u201ckick Trump\u2019s ass out behind the gym\u201d and that Obama is a black guy, Trump looks worried and watches as his PR flack and Secret Service people leave him unattended.\n\nObama and Biden bust out laughing and slap hands.\n\n\u201cL-M-A-O, dude,\u201d Obama chortles.\n\n\u201cYou heard the expression, Be careful what you ask for?\u00a0 This is it,\u201d Biden says.\n\nTrump:\u00a0 \u201cUh, uh, well\u2026.\u201d\n\nObama and Biden can\u2019t stop laughing.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really expect to win, you know,\u201d Trump says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucked,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cRoyally screwed,\u201d Biden adds.\n\n\u201cYou think everybody was up your ass while you\u2019re a candidate, once you get to the big-boy chair, somebody is trying to take your head off every minute,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cYeah, some ass hole like you.\u00a0 How you gonna like that, a sensitive fellow such as yourself, having millions of you on your case night and day?\u00a0 You\u2019ll get arthritis in your fingers from tweeting angry comebacks,\u201d Biden says.\n\n\u201cOh, boy.\u00a0 What should I do?\u201d\u00a0 Trump asks.\n\n\u201cTry not being a lying, white supremacist shit head, for starters,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cIf you screw up, admit it quickly and put it behind you,\u201d Biden says.\u00a0 \u201cThe more you try to deny and dance around it, the worse it gets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue, and it wouldn\u2019t cost me a vote,\u201d Trump says.\n\n\u201cThat was then, this is now,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cApologize publicly to the President, that would be a good start, if you actually want to bring people together,\u201d Biden says.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSure, I will, and I apologize now, to you Mr. President, for all the crazy birther and Muslin shit I said. \u201c\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re way late for that.\u00a0 But, tell you what you could do.\u00a0 You could tell Congress to quickly approve Merrick Garland for SCOTUS and approve my backlog of judge appointments,\u201d Obama says.\u00a0 \u201cThe Republicans were nagging me to appoint Garland, then when I said, OK, they turned against it, just because it was my idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is fucked up, I know,\u201d Trump says.\u00a0 \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis side of climbing up the Washington Monument and jumping off?\u201d Biden asks.\n\n\u201cJoe, Joe, we\u2019re not going to be like that,\u201d Obama says.\u00a0 \u201cWe talked about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about saying you didn\u2019t really mean that crazy shit, like hating on women, black people, refugees, Muslims, Mexicans -- you know, your laundry list of people to blame for old white people\u2019s problems and insecurities,\u201d Biden says.\n\n\u201cCan I wait and do that at the inauguration speech?\u00a0 I want these Republicans to keep kissing my ass a little longer;\u00a0 they doing back-flips to kiss the ring.\u00a0 It would be sickening if it wasn\u2019t so delicious,\u201d Trump says.\n\nObama and Biden look at each other.\n\n\u201cNope, you gotta do that quickly, before the people burn down Trump Tower with you in it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard there is a well-coordinated plot to do just that,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cA plot!\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t my Secret Service people -- and they are great folks, by the way, they really are -- why didn\u2019t they say anything?\u201d Trump asks.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell you about the multiple plots to burn you out?\u00a0 Dude, they must already hate you,\u201d Biden says.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s the intern tail around here?\u00a0 I heard it\u2019s terrific.\u201d Trump asks.\u00a0 \u201cJFK, Clinton, everybody else but Nixon, probably, has dipped into the intern pool.\u201c\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a myth anymore.\u00a0 Ken Starr ruined it,\u201d Obama says.\u00a0 \u201cOnce in here, nobody gets laid.\u00a0 What with the long hours, the constant stress, listening to butt holes such as yourself and the Republicans in Congress, there\u2019s no going down, going down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to be at least four years before you grab any pussy,\u201d Biden says, \u201cand by then, you\u2019ll either be dead or unable to get it going.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your fake hair will turn white and fall out,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Trump says.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t go for Melania,\u201d Biden says.\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019ll be bonding with her bodyguards and driver.\u201d\n\n\u201cShit.\u00a0 This is sounding worse by the minute,\u201d Trump says.\n\nObama:\u00a0 \u201cWell, you could request that she has female guards and drivers.\u201d\n\nTrump:\u00a0 \u201cMelania swings both ways, you know.\u00a0 Actually, I could watch, and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, look at the time,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cCan we do this again?\u00a0 I really need help,\u201d Trump says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call you,\u201d Biden says.\n\n\u201cI think this went well, don\u2019t you?\u201d Trump asks as they get up to leave and shake hands.\n\n\u201cYeah, a blast,\u201d Obama says.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to the press, I want it to look like things went well.\u00a0 Is it OK if I call you my nigga?\u201d Trump asks.\n\n\u201cIs it OK if we call you Little Putin?\u201d\u00a0\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a

You are already imagining them budding again in the moon of the tender grass, after a season of hard winter moons creating their stark, bare forms \u2026 In prayerful gratitude to Wakan Tanka, you cry: \u2018Hoka hey!\u00a0 It\u2019s a good day to die, Grandfather!\u00a0 Life is good!\u2019\n\nThe buffalo scouts have seen a great host of them traveling not far to the north of you, and your thoughts turn to the people behind you, their travois loaded with the tipis, poles, and supplies that will soon become a village near this river you sense will be a comfortable base for the coming hunt.\u00a0 You picture the children\u2019s gleaming eyes, excited to prove their worth as helpers in this undertaking that is so essential to their families, and more importantly, to all of the people.\n\nAs you approach the mighty cottonwoods, and slow your pony a bit, your eyes see glimpses of the shining water through the trees.\u00a0 But your mind is half on the images of your first Sundance one moon ago, and the many days of prayer and intentional suffering that you were proud to have endured for the well-being of your people.\u00a0 Vestiges of the pain from the sharp and thin bone skewers the holy man had pierced through your chest, then fastened to the Great Tree in the center of the circle\u2026praying to the spirits of the four directions, until you fell backward, releasing the bone from your flesh.\u00a0 Aiiy, such hard and sweet misery it was.\u00a0 But the people will have meat and robes this winter, and the children will grow strong with the berries and plants that the river\u2019s moisture provides, and the white man\u2019s sickness will not reach us here this far to the south!\n\nThe white men were killing the buffalo for robes and tongues, leaving their skinned carcasses to rot in the sun.\u00a0 The white men kept coming and coming, rivers of them wanting to fence off the land\u2026and kill you.\u00a0 You were herded like beasts into smaller and smaller \u2018reservations\u2019, where your people starved because the food they promised you in exchange\u2026never arrived.\u00a0 Some warriors left the reservation to hunt for food for the people; sometimes they killed white people who attacked them, sometimes they were killed.\u00a0 We knew that they wanted us gone.\u00a0 They\u2019d stolen your children and carried them off to white families and Indian schools, where they were forbidden to be Lakota, and turned into white children with no families to succor them.\n\nBut one night at the Sundance during the moon of red cherries, knowing of the plans for the soldiers to force your people into small plots of land, Sitting Bull had a vision: soldiers would fall into their camp like grasshoppers from the sky.\u00a0 He and the other tribes organized the warriors who refused to die like penned cattle, and made an alliance with several other tribes.\u00a0 They camped by the Little Bighorn River.\n\nYou can see the battle that ensued when George Armstrong Custer\u2019s Seventh Cavalry came to annihilate your people, not knowing how many you were, nor of your firm resolve to live another day.\u00a0 It\u2019s the stuff of legend that you witness, and will only know later how flawed and poorly executed Custer\u2019s plans had been.\u00a0 But what you see is your warriors in splendorous attire, painted with the symbols of the visions, fighting as though they were all Crazy Horse, who believed bullets could not pierce his flesh!\u00a0 Ah, you smell the gunpowder, see the blood\u2026and can\u2019t help rejoicing when the white soldiers die in massive numbers.\u00a0 You may or may not have seen Old Yellow Hair go down to his death, but if you had, I reckon that you would have cheered.\u00a0 The white man\u2019s belief in God-given Manifest Destiny was in tatters\u2026 for now.\n\nThe tribes scattered, knowing that the army would seek vengeance.\u00a0 The ensuing chases of different clans and tribes you can see as though from a vantage point in the sky.\u00a0 You witness the privations, the capitulations, the pain of the decisions thrust on the leaders.\u00a0 Nothing pretty came of any of it; the soldiers and the government were determined to end The Indian Problem once and for all.\u00a0\n\nWhooosh; the times are now so very hard.\u00a0 The people have been herded onto lands decreed by the Great Father in Washington, and are starving and threadbare with broken promises.\u00a0 The Sundance has been forbidden, so your spirits are weak.\u00a0 In secret, some are beginning to practice the Paiute Wovoka\u2019s Ghost Dance, sent to him in a vision; the hope it brings is spreading throughout the plains.\u00a0 Wovoka had said that if the people practiced it in an impeccable manner, the white man would be vanquished from the lands, and the buffalo and all the Ancestors would be brought back to life.\u00a0 In addition, carefully sewn Ghost Dance shirts would make the wearers\u2019 flesh impervious to bullet fire.The 60 million buffalo (Tatanka) that had roamed the plains were now all but extinct now; fear of Lakota Oyate extinction must have permeated the air.\n\nBut now, sensing that the dance spoke of a major rebellion, the anxious white settlers had convinced the government to initiate a program to rid your people from the lands that they coveted.\u00a0 The shining metal, gold, had been discovered in the sacred Black Hills Paha Sapa), and they had stolen it back from you\u2026since your people would not sell it to them.\u00a0 For who can claim to own the land that the creator has given to all of us, providing food, shelter, water and holy sites?\u00a0\n\nOfficers were sent to arrest the ringleader Sitting Bull; he and several of his band were shot dead in the ensuing struggle.\u00a0 The rest fled to various encampments, then fled again\u2026\u00a0 One day 350 of your Minneconjou cousins were surrounded by soldiers, disarmed, and driven to Wounded Knee Creek (?ha?kp\u00e9 \u00d3pi Wakp\u00e1la) under Porcupine Butte, and wrought a furious vengeance on your people, murdering 300 of you in cold blood: women, children, and men.\u00a0 Women and children, fleeing the battle, some with infants in their arms\u2026were gunned down like dogs.\u00a0\n\nWhen civilians were hired by the army days later to bury them, they were loaded into a mass grave on the hill above the battle site.\u00a0 Several live infants were found, wrapped in their dead mothers\u2019 arms.\u00a0 Perhaps you are seeing yourself as one of them, feeling yourself as one of them, and are wondering what may have become of you later.\n\nOr perhaps you are watching those few still left being loaded onto wagons, being sent back to the Pine Ridge Reservation.\u00a0 You may even be among them, grieving and defeated, stunned into silence.\u00a0 Hoka hey; it\u2019s a good day\u2026to die\u2026You certainly don\u2019t ask to be shown the arguments among the military afterward, nor to see the several Medal of Honor recipients whose awards were for chasing an murdering those escaping women and children.\u00a0 Or perhaps you do; who am I to say?\u00a0 Did you ask to hear of the callous and ugly support offered by so many notables of the day?\u00a0 The newspaper editors for whom whole cities and counties in the West have been named?\n\nA simple form of Abracadabra \u00a0magic brings you to the gates of the prison on Alcatraz, and you are shown those doughty American Indian Movement folks who had decided to Occupy it as an example of what they claimed your people were promised in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, granting the Lakota and associated tribes the rights to property abandoned by the federal government.\u00a0 One notable Occupier was poet and musician John Trudell, who broadcast a daily radio program from inside the prison, the pesky devil.\u00a0 That bold move was one of the early harbingers of the First American roots movement to reclaim their languages, spirituality, cultural traditions, and above all: pride.\n\nNow I can see that you are being whisked of in time to a second Wounded Knee time, this one the iteration of AIM and associated activist tribal members Occupying the church near the site of the original massacre.\u00a0 This daring feat, Alcatraz, and other instances of Native American and the Lakota, having stood up to The Man, demanding rights and sovereignty, helped to spawn COINTLEPRO, whose evil doings were meant to crush dissidence of any sort, but special attention was paid to uppity Blacks and uppity Reds.\u00a0 Danger: \u2018wild people of color rising up\u2019 caused white America to quake in their boots.\u00a0 White man fear: what is its origin?\u00a0 That question has launched a thousand ships, erudite essays, and psychological treatises.\u00a0 Never mind.\u00a0\n\nThe Occupation was spurred by the failure of your tribe to impeach and remove from office one evil BIA-backed Richard Wilson, under whose rule began a reign of terror on the traditionalists at Pine Ridge, over 50 of Wilson\u2019s enemies were shot and killed, with absolutely no legal consequences.\u00a0 Dickie\u2019s private militia, called the GOON Squad (Guardians of the Ogallala Nation) was closely allied with the FBI, who had brought them weapons to use against their own people.\u00a0 Use them they did.\u00a0 Was one of the murdered possibly...
