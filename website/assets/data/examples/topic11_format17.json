If you want to go for more power, use a Life Orb.\nPersonally, I prefer no item or a consumable berry so that Mienshao can use Acrobatics.\nHow about Fight Gem in that case?\nFlying Gem. When you use Acrobatics the Flying Gem will be consumed before acrobat checks for if there is any item, thus making this attack UBER strong\n0 votes\n\nDo not use bulk up on mein shao use a sweeping set with maybe choice band meinshao is packed with power and speed but lacks defence you may lose him if you bulk up and waste a turn\n\nanswered by\nChoice Items are terrible for Mienshao.

I have a second story house in the living large section and two of my sims where whoohooing outside near the beach line and fence when I decided I wanted to look up my inventory, I clicked the furniture icon and low & behold my whoohoo blur disappeared completely, I inially thought it was the fact that I clicked the furniture icon BUT it wasnt because when I clicked off it the blur still wasnt there...It was the fact that I have a two story home and it was set to 2 level....I zoomed in and the blur was still gone and it was super cute...kinda felt like a perv peeping in on my sims but they do hug very passionately, the kiss passionately and the look into each other was just super cute and I'm not sure why EA blur it at all theres nothing shocking or inappropriate about it. It also still showed the hearts fainlly floating from them as well.\nGuest answered:\nAdded 29th May 2013, ID #589899\nYou cannot remove it, it is supposed to be there, anyway why would you want to\nGuest answered:\nAdded 12th Oct 2013, ID #605312\nThe reason why there is blur is because kids might be playing it and they need to keep it but if you're an adult or teen this is how you do. It: Make your sims whoohoo go to settings change the language to fran\u00e7ais (YOU MUST HAVE ICLOUD FOR THIS PART) and if somthing pops out tap on the green one then exit settings then turn the language back to english then theres no blur for whoowhooing TRUST ME IT WORKS\nGuest answered:\nAdded 13th Oct 2013, ID #605409\nAll I did to get rid of it was change the language to Spanish (espanol or how ever you spell it ) then DID NOT PRESS THE RED BUTTON press back and it was gone.

Try it!\n\nGuest answered:\nAdded 19th Mar 2014, ID #620169\nSo first you need to have a two-story house. Get the sims to woohoo outside of the house. Then Click the button to go up the house.

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nRole-playing Games Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for gamemasters and players of tabletop, paper-and-pencil role-playing games. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nThe group I play with and I really like the fantasy setting of D&D 3.5. However, we find the rules a bit cumbersome, particularly in complex battles. We would still want the system to include rules for non-magic combat and also magic items (including weapons and armour).\n\nI have recently started playing World of Darkness (Vampire: the Masquerade) and I really like the different levels of success. The whole idea of the skill level giving you a \"dice pool\" and you having varying numbers of successes really appeals to me. It provides much more interesting gameplay than the success\/fail of D&D.\n\nIs there any system that uses this concept of different levels of success but that is primarily written for fantasy (medieval world containing magic) rather than horror?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\nAs this is a game-recommendation question, please adhere to the FAQ, the rules for subjective questions as outlined in Good Subjective, Bad Subjective and our rules for game recommendations. All responses must cite actual experience or reference others' experiences!\n\n5 Answers 5\n\nup vote 11 down vote accepted\n\nWhite Wolf materials:\n\nThere are two White Wolf released games set in medieval times...\n\n  \u2022 Vampire: The Dark Ages\n    while focused on vampire characters, it can easily be run for normals, using the Sorcery discipline for magic use (including additional paths from various other old-WoD supplements).\n  \u2022 Mage: The Sorcerer's Crusade\n    This one is focused upon Mages, which in the old-WoD pretty much makes them equivalent to demi-gods of legend. Still, it has some elements that make it useful for a high fantasy game.\n\nAnd a couple more that can be adapted:\n\n  \u2022 Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game\n    Highly detailed combat rules oWoD variant. While technically modern \u00fcber-powered martial arts, it can do fantasy fairly easily. Especially if you add the sorcery paths from WoD Sorcerer. Note that World Of Darkness: Combat is adapted from this one.\n  \u2022 Hunter: The Reckoning.\n    A purely Mortal game, near the end of the old WoD line; I don't have it, but have read it. Again, for mages, use WoD: Sorcerer instead of Mage. Add WoD: Combat for the same detailed combat mechanics as Street Fighter.\n  \u2022 World Of Darkness (New WoD core)\n    This is actually a generic ruleset. It can be used to do a variety of genres, but this will requires some work.\n\nOther Dice Pools with counting successes\n\n  \u2022 Burning Wheel\n    An excellent game, using only d6's for the dice pool, aimed broadly at European-ish cultures circa 1200-1600. Multiple levels of combat detail, which can be slowly layered in. Current edition is Burning Wheel Gold - lovingly referred to as the \"gold brick\" by fans. Don't be intimidated by size; almost half of the book is lifepath options, and almost half is optional rules. General complexity higher than White Wolf's system. The truth is, tho', that BW simply checks for whether you succeeded or not - excess successes have little meaning outside of combat, and even then, far less than WW\n  \u2022 Arrowflight\n    1st edition. Out of print, hard to find. Still, an excellent dice pool game. Simple - on par with White Wolf's. 2nd Ed has a brief (1\/2 page) option to use a dice pool, but that is poorly worded. Still, the rest of 2E is still compatible with the 1e dice mechanics, and is in print. Excellent setting. Unusually, the dice are rolled for low numbers being successes. Stat d6's for skill or less (with skill adjusted for difficulty). Fun combat, but pretty deadly in 1e.\n  \u2022 Mouse Guard\n    Named after the comic of the same name. Same basic task system as Burning Wheel, but streamlined and much different in the details. To quote the author, \"Not \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022ing Burning Wheel Light!\" Would require some adaptation for more classic fantasy... some of which has already been done. There is a free adaptation supplement for doing Rangers of the North in Middle Earth. No magic.\n  \u2022 Sorcerer\n    rules-light pick-your-favorite-kind-of-dice dice pool system. Advice on tone setting by which size of dice to use. Successes are counted against opponent's best die... so both sides can succeed with multiple successes. Interesting but not overly detailed combat. Focused mostly on the demon summoning, but the Sword & Sorcerer supplement thrusts it into classic swords and sorcery fantasy, with magic items as demons.\n\nDice Pools using Roll & Total\n\nThese are a roll a pool of dice (usually d6's) and total them, comparing to a target number. I don't think they're what the OP is looking for, but the ones I'm listing are pretty well regarded.\n\n  \u2022 d6 Fantasy (OOP, but PDF available free legally via RPGNow.com)\n  \u2022 EABA\n    BTRC's generic system. Has excellent ability to do fantasy, tho' the various fantasy settings for it are pretty dark. Roll stat+skill dice, total the best 3.\n  \u2022 The One Ring\n    Recent offering from Cubicle 7; uses 1d12 plus (skill)d6. Has a system for counting quality of success other than just beating the TN by a large margin; each 6 rolled on the d6's increases quality of success. late 2011 offering. In print and PDF.\n  \u2022 Legend of the Five Rings, 7th Sea, and Legend of the Burning Sands\n    AEG's d10 dice pool. Roll stat+skill, keep (total) stat worth of best dice. Dice open end. Excellent, L5R in print. LBS may still be available new. Noted for strong rules\/setting connections, simple mechanics, and excellent combat.\n  \u2022 Orkworld\n    Out of print. Still, often available used. Excellent rules, but the winter rules are badly broken, unless you want everyone starving. Roll many, keep best single die, with multiples of a given die increasing the best die. 4,4,4,4 is a 7, while 4,4,5,6 is just a 6. All d6's.\n  \u2022 Tribe 8 (and other Silhouette System games)\n    Roll skill d6's, count best, but note that multiples add +1 each, in a manner similar to Orkworld. Tribe 8 is post-holocaust fantasy, with magic, and decent combat; it's the same mechanics as Heavy Gear and Jovian Chronicles, and so the vehicular and mass combat mechanics from those can easily be ported in if that's your desire. All d6's.\n  \u2022 Savage Worlds\n    Roll Stat Die + Skill Die (+1d6 if PC) and total. Well regarded generic system. Has several good fantasy settings.\n  \u2022 Cortex System\n    Roll Stat Die + Skill Die for TN+. Only called a dice pool on RPGGeek because of a poor initial definition and the pain of recalibration of the database. Note that Cortex Plus is a different engine, really, that evolved out of Cortex. Cortex's first game was Sovereign Stone; the second was Serenity; only after Serenity was the system named.\n\nDice Pools doing more than count successes\n\nNot all take the one-dimensional approach of a set number of successes.\n\n  \u2022 Reign and other One-Roll Engine games.\n    The dice pool is rolled, and looked at for both height (what number got 2+ dice showing) and width (how many showed that number). I found it cumbersome to grasp, poorly worded, and not at all easy to use. Some swear by it, others swear at it.\n    Most noted for the rules for Reign for running groups and landholds.\n  \u2022 Warhammer FRP 3rd Edition\n    Note: 1st and 2nd editions are NOT dice pool systems at all!\n    Roll a nuber of dice, dice from stats are one type, from skill a second type, etc. (Blue attribute d8's, Red Stance d10's, Green Stance d10's, Yellow skill d6's, white boon d6's, black penalty d6's, purple resitance d8's.) Some symbols represent success, others represent side benefits, others still side effects, and others reduce success or side benefit effects. Simple, but not to everyone's tastes. Expensive, too - core box is $80 list price last I checked. Component driven, too. No numeric dice included nor used - just the symbolic ones. Substitution may be difficult.\n  \u2022 Houses of the Blooded & Blood and Honor\n    dice pool is split - some dice are rolled to see who gets to contribute, while others are set aside to determine how much one gets to contribute... Everyone who rolled 10+ on the rolled dice gets to contribute, with the highest determinging success or failure and keeping all dice set aside; others making 10+ lose half the set aside dice, while those not making 10+ lose them all. Anyone with set-aside dice gets to (in order) say one thing true about the task. This makes for very simple rules, and very fun fights. B&H, while Japanese themed, is much easier to grasp the mechanics from. HotBlooded is more machiavellian in scope, and has lots of fight-crunch, politics crunch, and funkiness. Neither is big on magic, tho'.\n  \u2022 Brute Squad\n    Warning: EXPLICITLY PVP Game\n    Excellent satirical game. Does some fun stuff with dice and tasks. Not for everyone. (My wife won't even consider a repeat.)\n\nNot Fantasy, but still worth considering for adapting, various types of dice pool:\n\n  \u2022 Marvel Heroic Roleplaying (and other Cortex Plus games)\n    Roll many, keep 2, and level of effect is by largest type of dice left uncounted. As with many highly narrativist games, this system can easily be reskinned to fantasy. Once players grasp the dice mechanics (took about an hour when I tried it with friends online), things really started to flow. If going to Fantasy, most non-mages would have gear as one \"power set\" and use skills; one could add normal level skills into the mix easily (they're defined, just not used for supers); wizards would add one power set per type of magic. Magic items might be power sets of their own, as would companion animals.\n  \u2022 Space 1889\n    Available in reprint edition. Combat is roll many, count successes. Non combat is roll and total. Since it's victorian era setting, there are good rules for melee. Inspired heavily by the Martian Chronicals of Edgar Rice Boroughs... pretty much, Sword & Sorcery Fantasy with Guns and flying steamships.\n  \u2022 Dogs in the Vinya... (truncated)",

Each has it's pros and cons. If you focus too much on the outside, yes, you'll give their outside shooters fits and you'll probably be called for less fouls, but their low post players will have an easier time inside as will players that drive to the hole. You'll also be out of position for many rebounds. On the other hand, if you focus on stopping the inside game, you'll give a good passing team many open outside shots, but you'll have more players in position to rebound and you'll probably be called for more fouls by concentrating your defenders in one area.\nAll Forums > Hoops Dynasty Basketball > Hoops Dynasty > Defensive Positioning\n\nTerms of Use Customer Support Privacy Statement\n\nPopular on WhatIfSports site: Baseball Simulation | College Basketball Game | College Football Game | Online Baseball Game | Hockey Simulation | NFL Picks | College Football Picks | Sports Games\n\n\u00a9 1999-, Inc.

        "text":"Latest in Gaming\n\nImage credit:\n\nThe Queue: Cho'gall is back in black\n\nAlex Ziebart\n\nWelcome back to The Queue,'s daily Q&A column where the team answers your questions about the World of Warcraft. Alex Ziebart will be your host today.\n\nOn the last edition of The Queue written by yours truly, I included a mind-blowing video on how to properly eat chicken wings. Today, I bring you something equally as mind blowing. How to properly peel a banana. And now, on with the show.\n\nBoombaclot asks...\n\n\"Do you believe that WoW has truly gotten easier or just maybe that the WoW community as a whole have become better players? Yes you have your scrubs but I know my WoW game has improved vastly since I started playing in Vanilla WoW.\"\n\nOh man, flamebait! My favorite! My opinion is that it's a little from column A, a little from column B. While there's still content in WoW that requires a significant amount of skill and dedication, most of the content is much easier than it was in The Burning Crusade (which I think was more difficult than vanilla WoW). On top of that, I do think that average skill level is higher now than it was in vanilla WoW. Players are better at multitasking with their abilities, they understand base mechanics better due to there being more reliable game resources out there, all of that sort of thing. So yes, the game is easier, but we're also better at it.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean there's no hard content in WoW. Absolutely not, because there is. The problem is that the hard content is incredibly gated and tucked away, and is made less intimidating by the fact you can do most of the hard stuff in 'easy mode' first. Anub'arak in Trial of the Grand Crusader is hard. Super hard. But if you can almost nap through the fight in the normal mode of the dungeon, the bite is taken away. Fights that are truly difficult in hard mode don't form a reputation for being hard, because they're ridiculously easy on normal mode. Everybody says, \"Anub'arak is so easy!\" when they really mean Anub'arak's normal mode is easy. Kind of silly. I'd like to see more of the hard content be like Algalon: Legitimately hard, no matter how you approach it.\n\nBlizzard could certainly make the content as hard as they want, so player skill isn't going to make or break the difficulty of the game. But I think that the average skill level is higher now than it was two or three years ago, and it's something they take into consideration when designing encounters.\n\nJohn asked...\n\n\"Any word on flying restrictions in Cataclysm, like Cold Weather Flying? Or will we be able to fly anywhere from 80?\"\n\nNo word yet. At least, none that I can remember. This is a question you should write down and ask us again once the Cataclysm beta starts.\n\njtrain asked...\n\n\"Will there be a Shattrath\/Dalaran equivalent in Cataclysm? I don't remember if they mentioned one or not. I have a long list of reasons why I'd love to go back to just using the home cities again, including lag, lag, lag, lore, lag, lag...\"\n\nWe're going to be using our original, faction-specific capitals in Cataclysm. Orgrimmar\/Undercity and Ironforge\/Stormwind will be the big sexy hubs again. There will be neutral quest hubs, like Deepholme and all of that sort of thing, but the capital cities will be faction-specific again.\n\nNayr asked...\n\n\"So, now that the Queue is \"Ask a Beta Tester\", \"Ask a Lore Nerd\", and \"Ask silly questions\", is there anything else we need to know about? Will you be coming home late at night with lipstick on your collar?\n\nDoes Mrs. Queue need to be scared?\n\nPlease, Queue, think of the children!\"\n\nNever fear, Nayr! Ask a Beta Tester will be its own spiel when the Cataclysm beta kicks off... probably. Maybe. It depends on if they both have sustainable popularity or not, hopefully they do. Ask a Lore Nerd and The Queue have been folded in together because both columns were basically the same format, and suffered equally from community burnout on current content. It's really hard for us to answer pie-in-the-sky questions like, \"Do you think Tirion Fordring will become the new Lich King and implement player housing in 2013?\" We don't mind throwing a \"Maybe!\" at a question now and then, but it was getting a little crazy. So by combining the two, hopefully we'll have a better product in the end.\n\nAsk a Beta Tester will probably (key word is probably) come back on its own for the Cataclsym beta, and go away again when it ends.\n\nSlaytanic asked...\n\n\"It appears that the dominant bad-guy faction in Cataclysm will be the Twilight Hammer. I've seen a couple of these tribes in remote places, like northern Silithus or BFD, but never anything really extensive behind their origins. Is there any current quest lines I can do in-game to get caught up on this faction's lore?\"\n\nThe Twilight's Hammer clan was originally a clan of orcs (and ogres) from Draenor, which had Cho'gall (the first ogre magi) as its chieftain. After the various \"holy crap orcs are storming through the dark portal halp\" wars, the Cho'gall dropped off the map and the clan evolved into something a bit... different. The Twilight's Hammer clan twisted into something of a cult, where people of all walks of life following Cho'gall's teachings and worshiped the Old Gods. This is why you'll find them wherever you find an Old God's taint, like Silithus, Blackfathom, Ulduar, and now all over the place in Cataclysm.\n\nIn the comic, Cho'gall is back in action and resurrecting C'Thun while mutating into some freak... thing. When Deathwing comes back, he's sort of going to be a herald of the Old Gods, so the Twilight's Hammer are going to be his pets, more or less.\n\nHave questions about the World of Warcraft?

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nRole-playing Games Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for gamemasters and players of tabletop, paper-and-pencil role-playing games. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nIt's my understanding that WOTC is releasing a string of 4e products under a label they're calling \"Essentials\", that there's substantial revisions\/errata attached to this product line, and that the primary goal is to provide a superior learning curve for players who are new to RPGs.\n\nMy question is this: What problems or deficiencies in the existing 4th edition architecture, perceived or real, are the Essentials revisions intended to address? Also, am I correct in understanding that all extant 4e products will be revised as needed to be fully compatable with the new version of the rules?\n\nshare|improve this question\nI'd attach a \"ddessentials\" tag if there was one. Please note that I have no interest in starting a 4.5e skubwar (which is why I was suprised to note that the 4e tag reads \"4.0\"), and forgive me if I've totally misunderstood the scope of the Essentials line - I can't isolate the signal from the noise that WOTC PR is putting out, and anywhere else I go the subject will invariably devolve into trolling and flamewars. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 1 '10 at 23:02\nI think this will be divisive and cause arguments, and that it'll be hard to get decent answers to it given that essentials isn't even out yet. I'd consider waiting to ask this question until anyone could answer it in anything other than opinions. \u2013\u00a0 mxyzplk Sep 1 '10 at 23:06\nI took a shot because I'm a masochist. There are people with Essentials books in their hands answering questions, and some of my answers are based on what they've said. If this gets flamey I'll vote to close, but I'd like to see if we can manage to avoid Edition Wars, because I think that'd be a substantial accomplishment. Also -- added the tag because I think Essentials-only is going to be a reasonable way to want to play the game. \u2013\u00a0 Bryant Sep 1 '10 at 23:23\nIt's definitely a question that's historically been prone to some ugly debates, but it's still ultimately a question that I think needs answering, if only because I don't know the answer myself. More importantly, I think that we need to be able to talk about potentially divisive things, like controversial edition changes or revisions, if RPG Stackexchange is going to distinguish itself above other RPG communities. The ratings structure gives us a great way to filter out the trolls, and I think it'd be a shame if we failed to use this platform to its utmost potential. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 1 '10 at 23:38\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 14 down vote accepted\n\nKudos for tackling the tough subject with grace. I'll see how well I can answer this. If anyone thinks I've gotten evangelistic, please let me know and I'll try and modify my answer to reflect your concerns.\n\nWhat Is Essentials?\n\nThere will be several products released this year and early next year under the Essentials banner. Here's a list of the key ones. If you get those, you will have a core set of rules that allows you to easily play and run D&D 4e.\n\nThere are few core changes or errata that originate with Essentials. Combat works the same way, magic works the same way, and so on. There have definitely been a lot of errata and rules changes over the last two years, and Essentials will include all of those, but Essentials in and of itself is not the reason for those changes. For better or worse -- and there are arguments in both directions -- WotC decided to aggressively fix balance problems in 4e. That's not new to this release.\n\nThe classes presented in Essentials -- fighter, cleric, rogue, wizard, druid, paladin, ranger, and warlock -- are not the same versions as those we've seen so far. In some cases they're pretty similar, and in some cases they're fairly different. However, they are fully compatible with existing characters of those classes, in two key senses.\n\nFirst, you can take an Essentials wizard and plop her down in a campaign next to a wizard as presented in the Player's Handbook and nothing at all needs to be changed for either of them. The core gameplay is completely compatible, again. D&D 4e is designed so that classes are heavily modular; a given class can have multiple builds which function differently, and one class may gain powers differently than another, but in the end you're just rolling an attack and applying damage and\/or conditions.\n\nSecond, material from Essentials serves as a resource for existing classes and vice versa. For example, you can choose Essentials wizard powers for your classic wizard without problems. Likewise, an Essentials wizard could take PHB wizard powers. No need to house rule or adjust. In some cases, this won't make sense -- for example, Essentials fighters don't have dailies, so they can't take PHB fighter dailies -- but even in that case an Essentials fighter could take a PHB fighter utility power.\n\nAll that said, Essentials is going to feel different. Fighters, for example, work much more like third edition fighters. I suspect some people will want to play Essentials-only games, and I think there's good reasons why you might want to do that. Further, if you learn to play an Essentials fighter, there'd be a slight learning curve if you then wanted to learn how a classic fighter works.\n\nWhy Essentials?\n\nOnly Wizards knows for sure, but they've talked about a bunch of things. They want to have a better entry point into the game. The Starter Kit will be sold in Target for $20, and that's a lot more accessible than telling new players they need these three $35 hardcover books.\n\nThey also clearly want to attract players of older editions. As noted, the fighter is simpler and does away with some of the immersion problems people have had. The classic 4e fighter is centered around powers, and the Essentials fighter returns to the mode of just using basic attacks -- but doing cooler things with them.\n\nI believe that Wizards would like to have a new core rule set that collects all those errata. I don't find the PHB to be useless... but I also get most of my rules info from my DDI subscription at this point, and I'm really looking forward to the compiled Rules Compendium. It's a pain looking up finer rules points in three or four different places.\n\nWhat Happens To Old Stuff?\n\nNothing. There is not going to be anything like the Complete Class line which made the old class books obsolete. Essentials options don't overlap with classic options; if I want to play a two-weapon fighter who gets by on mobility, the Tempest Fighter from Martial Power is probably still the right way to go. The monsters from the first three Monster Manuals are completely functional and don't need to change -- at worst, you might want to up the damage for the ones from MM1 and MM2. The campaign books don't need new editions. Etc.\n\nMost of the books announced for 2011 are not Essentials books; they don't have the Essentials name and they don't have the Essentials trade dress. I believe the intent is that they'll be equally useful whether you have the old core books or the new Essentials books, which makes sense because it's theoretically the same game.\n\n\nThe proof is in the pudding. A few core rules are changing with Essentials. Racial traits are slightly different here and there, for example, but in all cases the changes are optional rather than forced. Magic items get a new rarity scheme, and I don't know exactly how that's going to interact with old magic items.\n\nAll the above wall of text is what I think, but I do want to look at the books and find out for myself.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThat almost answers my question, and I'm going to take the blame for opting for inoffensiveness over clarity. The fact of the matter is, I like 4e as a whole, but there are specific elements about 4e that I don't like, and that I wish would change, and \"errata\" means \"changes\" - the thing you mentioned about fighters working more like 3e fighters really sounds interesting to me, for example. However, I was under the impression that it was closer to release than it apparently is. I may have simply asked this question too soon. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 1 '10 at 23:44\nI gotta admit it'll be easier to answer in about a month. I know some of the new fighter stuff, but not all of it. \u2013\u00a0 Bryant Sep 1 '10 at 23:52\nThat's a lot ... so it's like 4.5 that's backwards compatible ... great. \u2013\u00a0 C. Ross Sep 14 '10 at 15:37\n@C.Ross: Less that, I think, than a version of 4E that's geared toward people whose favored editions were those before 3rd. From what I've seen of the Essentials stuff, it's very much \"can I play a character like the one I played in the 1980s in your game?\" \u2013\u00a0 Jadasc Sep 14 '10 at 15:53\nOkay, good enough. Fighters hit things with swords instead of using powers? I'm sold. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 16 '10 at 18:34\n\nUntil we get the books in our hands we can't be sure what changes Essentials will hold for the core rules. But remember this D&D 4.0 is an exception based system. In that it is similar to Magic the Gathering. MtG is not the same as it was back when it was first released. However it is the same game. What makes it different is the mix of card that is part of the core set. Despite not playing for a number of years I am confident I can go buy a deck of magic cards and starting playing. I will definitely have to learn new strategies and new ways of building my decks. But I am still playing the same game.\n\nAnd this looks to be the situation with Essential D&D. Instead of just the core Fighter there will be the Essential Fighter and so on for the rest of the classes. You will have status effects, at-will powers, encounter powers, and perhaps a few dailies. And you will still have to read the text carefully and understand the standard terms.\n\nIf they do the Essential Red Box right then it will be a lot easier for people to pick up and try 4e D&D. In addit... (truncated)",

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nWe're playing 4e Thunderspire Labyrinth and we've decided to let the tank play a large (2x2) Minotaur.\n\nHe has all of the stats from the Minotaur player character in the Players Handbook 3, but he's a large creature. He will be a Battlerager Fighter.\n\nThe labyrinth has several hallways that are only two squares wide and many doorways that he'll have to use Squeeze just to go through.\n\nWhat are the advantages this will give him and what are the disadvantages?\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nup vote 16 down vote accepted\n\nThere are some major advantages and major disadvantages to playing a large PC. Here are a couple I can think of right off the top of my head\n\n\n  \u2022 Access to Large weapons. This increases the weapon die size by one.\n  \u2022 As a defender they have the ability to draw in more targets there are 12 squares around them instead of 8.\n  \u2022 larger close bursts.\n  \u2022 defender aura more powerful as its an opportunity action and affects all squares around you.\n  \u2022 Some monster races have threatening reach, a property that should be very difficult for a PC to achieve (there is no always on threatening reach for PCs, and for good reason, it provides way too much area of control).\n\n\n  \u2022 squeezing when passing through narrow hallways (grants CA)\n  \u2022 more flanking opportunities for enemies (grants more CA)\n  \u2022 more adjacency means more potential hits absorbed\n  \u2022 marks mean less as you can only enforce 1\/round\n  \u2022 reduced ability to use cover and concealment (not a big deal for defenders but its a valid disadvantage to other roles)\n\nPersonally the only thing I find game breaking is the larger bursts, but that will be up to your discretion as DM. I don't think things that are designed to target a max of 8 creatures should get to go up to 12. But its possible that the trade offs of being able to be flanked more ways, and having to squeeze out weight the advantages of extra targets and more damage.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThe character also cannot traverse through any area that requires a Medium character to squeeze. Considering the game does not assume there exist Large PCs, these might exist and will be impossible for the Minotaur to get through. \u2013\u00a0 Erik Mar 11 at 20:48\nBesides narrow hallways, I would be concerned about doors. \u2013\u00a0 DCShannon Mar 12 at 1:38\nI can confirm all of this. A while ago I had someone who played a large Dragonborn (which I was 100% OK with; slightly envious, even). He did have trouble with most doors, and he almost got stuck in a narrow tunnel once, but everything else in the story made it worth it. Something I would add is that, roleplay-wise, a large creature is far more impressive; I had NPCs react accordingly to the giant, even (especially) other Dragonborns. \u2013\u00a0 Linkyu Mar 13 at 0:06\n\nI'd add these points to those already enumerated by @wax eagle.\n\n\n  \u2022 Large WardensDDI may mark much more creatures.\n  \u2022 Even it is fuzzy and not really covered by rules, someone would eventually try the minotaur-riding gnome tactic.\n\n\n  \u2022 A Large creature has less safe-path choices while traversing patches of difficult, hindering or challenging terrain.\n  \u2022 Reduced space for maneuvering out of close quarters. Two enemies could lock a Large creature in a corner, forcing it to squeeze or bull rush.\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nI'm a level 900 wizard in Gemcraft: Labyrinth, with around 8500 skill points. My general goal is to create a Y\/O\/L supergem that goes in a trap, with a B\/C\/P before it that slows\/stuns\/armor-shreds things to soften them up for the killing gem.\n\nI used to play this game religiously, but fell out of it after not being sure how to proceed with high-level Endurance runs.\n\nI have max stats in everything that has a cap except for Banisher (decreased banishment cost, but who needs that? If you're letting things leak, you're playing the game wrong), and Poison\/Bloodbound masteries. Focus gives me 800% extra min\/max mana, Replenish gives me 275% mana gain over time and kill, and Resonance gives me 225% extra damage. At this point, I'm not sure which stat I should be prioritizing. With a higher starting mana, it will cost much less to get more mana in the long run. Mana over time and per kill makes it easier to get better gems faster, and damage is...damage.\n\nI'm also wondering how much summoning I should be doing during certain parts of the game; how many gems on which waves, and what grades should they be? When should I stop summoning? Also the ratio of orange to lime to yellow in the killgem, as well as when to squish out the orange. Other tips in general would be appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I play with setting at max aside from Waves Get Tougher Faster.\n\nshare|improve this question\nI've used this as a guide in the past, but I've found it to be inefficient. \u2013\u00a0 Confuzzledmaniac Aug 10 '12 at 19:17\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nBrowse other questions tagged or ask your own question.",

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nI've heard numerous interviews with Miyamoto stating that he'd love to see Link to the Past on the 3DS with 3D. As well it's my understanding that a few games on the 3DS Virtual Console (Excitebike?) have 3D added into them.\n\nAre there any differences between the 3DS version of \"Link's Awakening\" and the original or DX version?

It does include the Color Dungeon found in the DX version, and is in colour.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nOne little addition to your stellar answer would be that if you hold START while selecting the game from the 3ds menu you can play on an awesome 3D purple gameboy color. Which adds a little \"newness\" to playing this on the 3ds but really doesn't change any gameplay elements. :] \u2013\u00a0 stay Apr 12 '12 at 4:10\n@stay I am really not sure what you mean here - do you mean the GameBoy image that shows on the upper screen of the selection menu will be a purple GBC? Mine started out that way... \u2013\u00a0 Ashley Nunn Apr 12 '12 at 4:44\nActually if you hold down the start button while selecting the game from your 3DS menu it will make your top screen have an awesome purple gameboy color \"frame\". Which if you turn your 3D on it will look basically like a real gameboy color.. same goes for the original gameboy games and the new gamegear games. :] \u2013\u00a0 stay Apr 12 '12 at 4:58\n\nThe short answer is no. There's no 3D* and the game has no major changes.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor tweaks to non-gameplay elements:\n\n  \u2022 Grandma Ulrira no longer has her \"YAHOO!\" shout; it's been replaced with \"HELLO!\" and \"YIPPEE!\".\n  \u2022 Effects that make the screen flash (e.g., capacity upgrades) have been slowed down greatly, like most other Virtual Console games.\n  \u2022 Mamu's song loses the spotlights, which were done by rapidly flashing parts of the screen\n  \u2022 The photobook no longer allows you to print pictures. The game ignores the A button entirely, so you can't even get the \"Error 02\" message.\n  \u2022 Inaccurate emulation bugs sometimes lead to minor music and graphical inconsistencies\n\nThe actual changes to the game itself have been verified by examining the game's content. The ROM itself is a standard Link's Awakening ROM with an included text-based patch (applied in real-time).\n\n* Holding Start or Select when starting the game will render the game at original size (no filtering) with a faux-Game Boy Color border around it. The game screen is slightly sunk into the border using 3D effects.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
