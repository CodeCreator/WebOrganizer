        "text":"Behavior-Based Safety: Myth or Magic?\n\nWhen it was introduced, behavior-based safety (BBS) was seen as a magic panacea for everything that ailed safety programs. \u201cIt was the Swiss Army Knife of safety programs. It could take care of everything,\u201d says Ron Bowles, director of operations for Portland, Ore.-based Strategic Safety Associates. \u201cNow people realize that it is just one tool and more are needed.\u201d\n\nDecades after the initial launch of BBS programs, the process has lost favor with many safety managers, who claim the cost \u2014 such programs can be expensive \u2014 and the long-term results are not what they expected.\n\nSome experts argue that expectations for BBS were unrealistic from the start, while others believe the process has been corrupted at some companies, transformed into an auditing program that assumes a \u201cblame the employee\u201d attitude about safety failures. \u201cBehavior-based safety makes the assumption you know what behaviors you should be doing,\u201d says Robert Pater, managing director of Strategic Safety Associates. \u201cIt assumes you know what to do and need to be reminded to do it.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, that approach failed at many companies, says Larry Hansen, CSP, ARM, author and principal of L2H Speaking of Safety Inc.\n\n\u201cMy intro to behavior-based safety was being asked by my employer at the time to go to an Indiana food distribution company to analyze the safety program,\u201d remembers Hansen. \u201cAt 9 a.m., I walked in the door and the general manager said, \u2018Stop right there. I just bought a gun, and the next SOB who mentions behavioral safety\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nHansen said the company had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a behavior-based safety program and it had failed miserably. \u201cIt never had a chance,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a poor manager and a sick organization. They bought into it because they thought it said what they wanted to hear about the cause of incidents, what I call PDDT: people doing dumb things. In other words, employees are the problem and a BBS program can \u2018fix\u2019 them. It's a core misconception that leads to failure.\u201d\n\nThe Myth\n\nJim Spigener, vice president of BST Inc., a global safety consulting and solutions firm that was one of the pioneers in the concept of BBS, says BBS caught fire because \u201cfor years and years and years, there wasn't much new in safety. Then someone seized on the fact that management might want to pay attention to employees. But very few companies were ready to embrace the whole movement.\u201d\n\nEven without a total commitment to changing the safety culture with BBS as a part of that process, BBS caught on \u201cbecause it was getting results and it seemed to make sense,\u201d says Spigener.\n\nBBS was meant to be part of a bigger safety system, he adds, mentioning what he calls the \u201cfatal error\u201d of assuming that BBS in some form or another works as the only approach necessary to improve safety and reduce incidents.\n\n\u201cBBS, the way people talk about it now, is really a myth,\u201d says Spigener. \u201cA lot of companies jumped on the bandwagon, grabbed a BBS program off the shelf and now are disappointed with the results. And unions have a very good case for going after traditional BBS programs [that \u2018blame\u2019 the worker]. Traditional BBS programs don't examine what drives employees to be in a hazardous situation.\u201d\n\nHansen offers a perfect example to illustrate Spigener's point. Hansen says he visited a facility that incurred repetitive losses from injuries employees suffered running up the lunchroom stairwell. Finally, an employee fell and broke his leg, at which point management adopted a BBS program, installing monitors in the hallway leading to the stairwell to remind employees to walk up the steps and to reiterate the company policy, which called for no running. Despite the focus on employee behavior, employees continued running up the stairs until a second major incident occurred, leaving an employee paralyzed. Finally, someone got smart and began to examine systemic causes for employee behavior that ran contrary to company policy and, even, common sense.\n\n\u201cThey weren't asking the most basic question of employees: \u2018Why are you running up the stairs?\u2019\u201d says Hansen. \u201cThe answer was, \u2018There aren't enough chairs in the lunchroom.\u2019\u201d Employees knew, says Hansen, that if they were late entering the lunchroom, they had to stand to eat their lunches.\n\n\u201cBehavior-based safety done right can be very effective at helping you discover what's wrong with an organization, find the core organizational causes of risk,\u201d Hansen adds. \u201cDone wrong, it can be used to mask organizational and management failures.\u201d\n\nIt's the Culture, Stupid\n\nE. Scott Geller, Ph.D., talks of attending a session at a safety conference where the presenter asked audience members if they had been injured in a workplace incident and then asked, \u201cHow many [incidents] were caused by another person? An equipment failure? Your behavior?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the majority raised their hands when he asked if their behavior caused the incident, he said, \u2018I rest my case,\u2019\u201d Geller, alumni distinguished professor at Virginia Tech and director of the Center for Applied Behavior Systems in the Department of Psychology, remembers. \u201cBut he didn't go to the next step and ask the next question: \u2018What influences behavior?\u2019 It all happens as part of the culture.\u201d\n\nBBS has its virtues, says Donald Eckenfelder, CSP, P.E., the principal consultant with Profit Protection Consultants and a past president of the American Society of Safety Engineers, but it also has its faults, one of which is the lack of focus on the overall safety culture and environment at a facility. To its credit, Eckenfelder says BBS:\n\n  \u2022 Focuses on the human side of safety;\n  \u2022 Defines safe and unsafe behaviors;\n  \u2022 Encourages safe behavior and discourages unsafe or destructive behaviors;\n  \u2022 Involves employees in safety;\n  \u2022 Requires management to put its money where its mouth is; and\n  \u2022 Engenders commitment and passion, especially in the early phases.\n\n\u201cThere are clearly good things about behavior-based safety,\u201d says Eckenfelder. \u201cBut there is more negative than positive\u201d in many of the BBS programs companies have adopted, he adds.\n\nFor example, many BBS programs, as packaged by the provider or used by the customer, don't deal with the causes of safety failures; they deal with the symptoms. \u201cBehaviors of employees are a long way from the root cause,\u201d says Eckenfelder.\n\nIf corporate management supports and encourages safe behavior by eliminating root causes \u2014 such as engineering, process, communication or training failures \u2014 then employees are more likely to want to adopt safe behaviors. Employers, managers and supervisors who actively and vocally support safe production and put money and resources behind that support are less likely to get pushback from employees regarding safe behavior.\n\n\u201cSafety isn't primarily a technical problem or a behavioral problem,\u201d Eckenfelder points out. \u201cIt's a cultural problem. If the culture's wrong, nothing else works.\u201d\n\nHe notes that when we walk into clothing stores or restaurants, we know if the culture is good or bad. \u201cCan't you feel the culture?\u201d Eckenfelder asks. \u201cIf they've got the culture \u2018right,\u2019 you say to yourself, \u2018Wow! I'd really like to come back here.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the quickest way to ensure safety culture failure, experts agree, is to try to \u201cforce\u201d safe behavior on employees.\n\nExperts equate such pressure to a parent telling a teenager how to behave \u2026 and say it gets about the same response. As Robert Pater, managing director of Strategic Safety Associates, says, \u201cYou can't mandate people to monitor themselves. You can invite them to do it. Forcing change creates pushback.\u201d\n\nIf you really want behavioral change, says Pater, \u201cemployees have to see the value of change. They have to believe they can change. They have to know how to change. They have to practice, because behavioral change doesn't happen from one exposure. And the new actions have to be reinforced through acknowledgment, celebration and external monitoring.\u201d\n\nThe key to true, positive behavior change, adds Bowles, \u201cis to create an environment where, rather than have safety as something that is being done to me or for me, it's something that's being done with me or by me. Once I begin to own it, I can have incredible success.\u201d\n\n\u201cReal change happens inside out,\u201d Eckenfelder adds. \u201cPeople get better because they change their attitudes, not because there is pressure placed on them from the outside.\u201d\n\nBBS and Beyond\n\nEveryone we spoke with agrees that one of the original basic concepts of BBS \u2014 pointing out to employees how they contribute to a safe work environment by informing them when they are performing safe or unsafe acts \u2014 can be an essential part of a system that contributes to a healthy safety culture.\n\nAnd encouraging all employees to take an active, thinking role in their safety and the safety process is a step in the right direction, says Geller, another of the pioneers of BBS.\n\nGeller now says he believes in \u201cpeople-based\u201d safety. He promotes what he calls ACTS \u2014 actions and coaching, which are behavior-based, and thinking and seeing, which are people-based.\n\n\u201cThe key challenge to safety is to inspire people to be self-accountable. We need to transition from programs that promote other-directed accountability to ones that promote self-directed accountability,\u201d says Geller.\n\nIn order for any system or program to be successful, he adds, the corporate culture must be taken into consideration. \u201cWhat works for Coca-Cola is not going to work for a company with a different culture,\u201d Geller points out. \u201cThe cookie-cutter approach never works.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201cfixing\u201d employees without fixing a broken culture never works either, says Pater. \u201cBBS was sometimes used as an excuse to not make changes to the corporate culture,\u201d he notes. \u201cIn other words, \u2018I'm OK, you're broken.\u2019 We need to move beyond that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason I lack a thorough understanding of the movement is because I abandoned the process very early in my career f...

        "text":"News | New Products\n\nGravure Versus Flexo Printing Part 2\n\nLast month I outlined the rapid growth of flexo printing in packaging and suggested that gravure printing had been out-marketed in North America by a very determined flexo community, which continues to gain share. Gravure printing today has many technical advantages for the packaging market that sometimes are overlooked. In addition there have been enough gravure improvements to warrant a reassessment of some of the old paradigms of cost, setup time, and run length.\n\nTechnical Aspects of Gravure\n\nThis is a very simple process with only a single impression to be set, so there are few inherent variables making for high quality print within the run and from run to run. Line and process can be combined on a single deck with the possibility of running fewer total color stations on the job. It is possible to carry very heavy ink films in gravure and maintain print resolution. With a commonly used solid cylinder, about 9 wet lb\/ream can be delivered. This is about three times the flexo rate. If you compare the two ink delivery systems, there are two ink film splits in flexo and only one in gravure. The advantage of this is that gravure is capable of producing unmatched white ink opacity, vivid metallics and fluorescents, and many other specialty effects and functional coatings not achievable in flexo. The gravure inking station allows use of very strong solvent mixtures that often are high in acetate content, which, in turn, allows for more possibilities in ink formulations. The high line resolution of gravure is a plus for small packages when ingredient labeling type is challenging for flexo.\n\nManufacturing Aspects of Gravure\n\nMany times comparisons are made between state-of-the-art flexo presses and old clunker gravure equipment. The current situation is that new flexo and gravure presses are about equivalent for features, amenities, and also for cost. All of the advanced robotic controls and features for flexo are available for gravure, so the playing field is now level. This requires that the traditional chart for gravure break-even analysis (see figure) be revisited. Opinions are numerous, but data is rare.\n\nOne analysis1 available online makes a good case for gravure economics and is backed with data. The essence of the argument goes like this: The prepress cost of gravure should be spread over repeat runs when the durability of the cylinder comes into effect and run length is less relevant. The cost of producing gravure cylinders is not proportional to the design complexity but is fixed and based on unit area of engraving. With flexo, the cost of plates increases with complexity of design.\n\nManufacturing improvements continue for gravure and include laser engraving of cylinders. Lightweight sleeves are available now and allow for easy handling, storage, and shipping.\n\nMarketing of Gravure\n\nThe Gravure Assn. of America and Packaging & Label Gravure Assn. Global are good forums for initiatives to promote gravure printing in packaging. If the history of flexo packaging growth is an example, it will take initiative and dedication from the supplier community to clearly define and optimize the steps in the total gravure workflow and communicate this process with print buyers.\n\nThere are indications that gravure as a process is beginning to take this initiative. We should see some interesting developments and an increased level of competition as these two processes battle over their share of the market.\n\n\nProcess improvement expert David Argent has 30+ years of experience in process analysis with particular emphasis on ink and coating design and performance.

        "text":"Main Menu\n\nConcrete Overlay Used for More than Just Concrete Floors\n\nDugout roof of the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nWhen the Cincinnati Reds had to redo two cracked and peeling dugout roofs, they needed a decorative concrete contractor who could not only repair the cracked slabs, but get that Reds red right.\n\nFortunately, David Stephenson and his company, American Concrete Concepts Inc., are color experts. \u201cWe\u2019re really good with color,\u201d says Stephenson. \u201cYou want purple concrete, we\u2019re the guys to talk to.\u201d\n\nThey were also, evidently, the guys to talk to about red concrete \u2014 after some experimentation, Stephenson and his team managed to produce an overlay in the precise shade of the Reds\u2019 logo.\n\nWhile matching that color was quite a challenge, it was not, by a long shot, the worst obstacle they faced when they were hired to refinish the dugouts at the team\u2019s Great American Ball Park three years ago.\n\nThe dugout tops \u2014 concrete slabs, roughly 10 feet by 100 feet each \u2014 were in bad need of help for a number of reasons. For one thing, they were painted. For another, Cincinnati\u2019s climate is not the most gentle in the country. Between the snow and ice of Ohio winters and the blistering heat of the summers, the paint got a regular beating just from being outside. \u201cIt gets real hot in the summer,\u201d says Stephenson. \u201cThe paint boils off!\u201d\n\nOn top of the weather, there was also foot traffic to contend with. It\u2019s from the dugout roofs that the Reds cheerleading squad stirs up the crowds\u2019 enthusiasm. Stephenson says they will sometimes even let fans cheer on the players from there. Given that the Reds stadium is host to over 150 events a year, that\u2019s a lot of wear and tear.\n\nAesthetics was not the only problem with the dugout tops. Over the years, the slabs had cracked pretty severely, and during rainier months, the players below were getting dripped on \u2014 and they weren\u2019t happy about it.\n\nA look a the designed logo that is on top of the dugouts at the Cincinnati Reds stadium,So between the paint bills and their increasingly soggy ballplayers, the Reds management knew they had to do something to address the problem. Finding that solution was up to Doug Gallant, head groundskeeper for the Reds stadium. Gallant knew concrete was still the way to go, but Stephenson says it was up to him to educate Reds staffers on what exactly could be done with it. \u201cAll they knew,\u201d says Stephenson, \u201cwas concrete was probably more durable than paint.\u201d\n\nBefore getting the job, Stephenson had to spend some time informing the Reds of their decorative concrete options. \u201cThere was a month of basically giving them an education on concrete and what all you can do with it,\u201d he says.\n\nUnfortunately, by the time they were sold on the idea, Stephenson and his crew had only three weeks before spring training started to schedule and complete the work. \u201cThey were putting bases on the field,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cThey were ready to play ball as we were starting the job.\u201d\n\nTheir time crunch was complicated by the fact that, the week the work was to be done, it rained for four days straight. In an open stadium like the Great American Ball Park, this presented a huge problem for Stephenson and his crew. The steady drizzle during the four days they were working meant they were constantly covering and uncovering the slabs.\n\n\u201cWe used tarps and fans and basically babysat the job through,\u201d says Stephenson.\n\nIn order to give the dugout a clean surface, as well as stop the leaking, Stephenson used Elite Crete\u2019s Thin-Finish white overlay. But before they could apply it, the existing surface needed some serious work. A new paint job season after season had resulted in many layers of paint that had to be ground away before they\u2019d have a bondable surface. The dugouts may have been built to support dancing cheerleaders, but they would never stand up to enormously heavy walk-behind grinders. Thus, all of the surface prep was done with hand-held angle grinders, wrapped in plastic bags on account of the rain.\n\nOnce the overlay was down and set, it came time for the more delicate work. The logos \u2014 the Reds logo for the home dugout, and the National League logo for the away team\u2019s \u2014 were fairly complex designs. To get the required detail took multiple overlapping vinyl stencils. \u201cThey had to be laid out perfectly in an outdoor environment with wind and rain,\u201d says Stephenson. Using batches of Thin-Finish with integral acrylic colorants, Stephenson and his team were able to get the resolution and detail that the Reds were looking for.\n\nOn a job like this, accuracy is paramount. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with something that\u2019s going to be on ESPN throughout the year,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cIt took a lot of skill.\u201d\n\nThis fall, Stephenson and the ACCI team will be returning to the Great American Ball Park to revisit their handiwork. Not because it\u2019s failing \u2014 on the contrary, the only maintenance the dugout tops have required is resealing. But the Reds changed hands in 2006 and the new owners have altered the lettering on the team logo. They wanted the dugouts to reflect the updated design, so they gave Stephenson another call.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back out there to change it up,\u201d says Stephenson, who expects to be starting the work in September, after the baseball season is over. This time, he\u2019s looking forward to having more than three weeks to do the job.",

Learn more about this aggressively growing agricultural conglomerate.\nBy |\nFrom farm to table: Calata Corp covers the food chain\nThe agriculture industry continues to be a significant driver in the growing national economy. During the first half of this year (2014), it grossed a total of P776.5 billion, more than 11% higher compared to its overall revenue in the same period last year, according to data from the Bureau of the Agricultural Statistics. That growth was spurred by the continuous expansion of crops and livestock subsectors.\n\nIt is the best time to get into agribusiness. Entrepreneurs who are considering venturing into the agriculture industry should check out available opportunities from Calata Corporation, a publicly listed agribusiness group.\n\nThe agricultural conglomerate has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a mom-and-pop retailer of agriculture products in Plaridel, Bulacan. The store was originally named J. Melvin\u2019s Trading when it opened in 1977. In 1999, it was incorporated as Planter\u2019s Choice Agro Products Inc.\n\nIt was in 2001 when its current chairman and CEO Joseph H. Calata took the helm. The business was renamed and took significant growth strategies. Since then, it has been counting milestones, one after another.\n\nCalata\u2019s advocacy\n\ncalata_corp_logo.pngCalata has a personal advocacy to entice entrepreneurs and investors to support the national agriculture industry by engaging in businesses that involve food production. \u201cAgriculture is cool. We should change how we look at farming as a difficult and tedious endeavor. It can be easy but profitable,\u201d he asserted.\n\nCalata proudly boasts about his company\u2019s farm-to-plate business model. \u201cWe currently cover the entire food chain from cultivation of crops to delivery of meat products to the market,\u201d he said.\n\nFarming phase\n\nAt first, the company developed its own pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides and branded those as Agri, which it also used as a retail brand that distributes not just those in-house products but also multinational brands like Bayer, Syngenta, Sinochem, and Monsanto, among others. The retail chain now has 116 stores in Luzon. It aims to bolster its chain to about 1,000 locations nationwide through franchising, with the guidance of Franchise Corporation (Francorp) Philippines.\n\nCalata partnered with Argentina\u2019s SiembraDirecta Corp. for enhanced corn farming utilizing the latter\u2019s more effective and efficient planting and harvesting technology. The partners manage a mechanized corn farm in Echague, Isabela. Harvested corn is then turned over to another phase of the firm\u2019s business.\n\nagri_calata.pngFeeds and meat supplies\n\nThe company teamed up with China\u2019s largest agribusiness firm, New Hope Group, to manufacture its own brand of livestock feeds called Golden Bean, which is available to local hog raisers.\n\nThe feeds are supplied to Calata\u2019s own roster of contract hog and chicken growers. The company directly buys livestock from animal raisers who use Golden Bean. The produce is turned over to the next phase of the business.\n\nLastly, having a significant stake in the Galicia Group, which is the supplier of meat products to Puregold supermarkets, Calata has ventured into supplying pork and chicken to food retailers, which has a direct connection to consumers.\n\nCalata Corp assures support for the country\u2019s agriculture industry through various means.

        "text":"Donald's Market\n\nUpgrades expected to save $11,000 a year on electricity costs\n\nNina Winham\n\nWhen it comes to improving your business, sometimes it seems you just can't afford the investments you'd like to make. Other times, you can't afford not to invest.\n\nIncreasingly, energy efficiency falls into the second category. With great gains in efficiency now available from relatively simple technologies, rebates from BC\u00a0Hydro that significantly reduce payback times, and skilled contractors who are increasingly savvy about helping you save money on your electricity bill, this is a great time to get started on energy conservation \u2013 and save money month after month.\n\nTo demonstrate the value of undergoing an \"energy makeover,\" BC\u00a0Hydro recently teamed up with Donald's Market, an independent grocer based in Vancouver. Now, Donald's expects to save about $11,000 a year on electricity at its Commercial Drive location, and the store offers a better customer experience than ever before.\n\nIt started with an energy assessment\n\nThe first step at Donald's was to do an energy assessment to determine the market's needs, and the options for the best energy efficiency gains. Karl Horvath of Quantum Lighting and Dennis Arduini of CT Control Temp Inc. assisted with the market makeover.\n\n\"What we do first is check to see the type and age of equipment the company is using, and then we determine where the best savings would be,\" says Arduini. \"New refrigeration cases are so much more efficient than older models, sometimes a full replacement is in order. But if that's not in the budget, upgrades or improvements can still improve their operating costs.\"\n\nFor his part, Horvath noted issues such as fluorescent lighting located directly above shelving instead of where it would best illuminate the product, a waste of electricity that left customers in the dark.\n\n\"As the population ages the light levels become more and more critical,\" he says. \"People just can't read in a dark retail place, and if they can't, they'll stop shopping, or you'll have less opportunities to retail to them.\"\n\nYou can assess your options for energy efficiency by working with contractors who are members of the Power\u00a0Smart Alliance. You can also get started on your own, using our \"Energy Walk-through\" series as a guide.\n\nLighting: strategic and efficient\n\nNew technologies have greatly improved not only efficiency, but also the colour rendering and visual comfort of various types of lighting. In addition, lighting practices have become more targeted to users' needs, and more strategic.\n\n\"What most people are looking for now is to dovetail energy efficiency needs with making sure their lighting meets their retail strategy,\" says Horvath. \"By doing so, they can not only get the gains from reduced operating costs but also help push their sales forward.\"\n\nAt Donald's Market, that meant upgrading and repositioning older fluorescent lights over grocery aisles, work areas and checkouts with more efficient T8 fluorescent tubes with electronic ballasts and matching light levels to the tasks in each area. Outside the front door, T12 fluorescent tubes over produce bins were exhibiting an annoying \"flicker\" and were upgraded to T8 vapour-proof luminaires that use 25-35% less energy.\n\n\"The old lighting just pushed out a lot of bland light,\" says Horvath. \"It made the product look poor, it washed it out with a bluish grey light.\"\n\nBringing colours to life was also a goal of the new lighting over the indoor produce area, where lights were repositioned away from pooling light on the floor to highlighting the enticing colours of eggplants, ripe tomatoes, and leafy greens. Halogen HIR floodlights were the pick for this area, with LED strips used inside produce cooler cases.\n\nDonald's owner, Gary Joe, is delighted with the improvement. \"These lights really enhance the product, and they don't damage it either,\" says Joe. \"It's like the change from regular TV to HD TV \u2013 the lights not only save energy but they also give a crisp look, and it's easier on the eyes. We look back now and go wow, what a difference lighting can make.\"\n\nA triple improvement was achieved inside coolers and freezers with glass doors (housing dairy products, frozen foods, etc.). Here, internal fluorescent tubes were both sending glare into customers' eyes, and throwing off heat that caused the refrigeration equipment to work extra hard. These were replaced with directional LED strip lighting that uses less energy, produces less heat, and allows a customer to see a wider range of product on the shelf instead of squinting and pulling away.\n\nFinally, incandescent lights in the walk-in cooler were replaced with CFLs (compact fluorescent lamps) and an incandescent exit sign was replaced with a highly-efficient LED version. The total estimated savings from lighting improvements is more than 58,000 kWh of electricity per year, or nearly $3,500.\n\nLighting Savings Summary\nArea Existing Retrofit Savings\nEntrance areas (front of building under awning) T12 strip lighting 1 x 8 T8 vapour proof luminaires 10,019 $593.10\nExterior entrance (rear of building) HID high pressure sodium luminaire Metal halide wall packs 2,453 $145.21\nProduce department 400W metal halide down lights Removed 11,826 $700.10\nProduce department 50W MR16 track lighting heads Halogen HIR floodlights 6,771 $400.87\nCashiers area, grocery aisles, meat, produce, work area and offices 2 x 4 recessed luminaires (T12 and magnetic T8) 2 x 4 recessed T8 recessed luminaires (4 lamps) 18,370 $1,087.49\nGlass door freezers and coolers (vertical) T8 40\" lamps LED strip modules 1,989 $117.72\nMeat and yogurt cooler cases T12 and T8 luminaires Convert to LBF electronic ballasts and 30W T8 lamps 2,606 $154.28\nOpen produce cases T8 lamps Horizontal LED strip modules 2,015 $119.28\nWalk-in cooler Incandescent CFL 1,012 $59.90\nCommon areas Incandescent LED exit sign LED exit sign 1,183 $70.01\nTotal from lighting\u00a0\u00a0 58,242 $3,447.95\n\n\nRefrigeration technology has also improved significantly over the years in terms of energy efficiency. However, the cost of completely replacing older refrigeration cases can be high, discouraging companies from seeking efficiencies.\n\nDonald's Market helps prove that there are alternatives to replacement \u2013 fixes for older equipment that can save energy, and money.\n\nA major factor in reducing the cost of energy for refrigeration is to prevent the loss of what you've already invested in: cold air. That means placing barriers between warm and cold areas wherever possible.\n\nDonald's implemented three such technologies: night covers on upright refrigerated display cases, strip curtains at the entry to their cold storage area, and an \"air curtain\" at three different entrances.\n\n\"For a smaller store like Donald's, night curtains are the best option to save money right off the bat,\" says Dennis Arduini of CT Control Temp. \"Especially on those older cases, you get a huge amount of cold air that's spilling out, with warm air from the store going in, so the units have to work that much harder to maintain their temperature.\"\n\nThe night covers are a retractable plastic cover, like a window blind, that are pulled over the case opening during closing hours, keeping the cold air in place.\n\n\"You don't need a technician to put them in, they're relatively inexpensive and the payback is very good,\" says Arduini. \"And there's a BC\u00a0Hydro incentive that adds to the value.\"\n\nSimilarly, strip curtains stop chilled air from spilling out of a busy cold storage area, while still allowing people to walk in and out with ease.\n\nAir curtains help with the same issue \u2013 but they block air from moving between the store's interior and the outdoors.\n\n\"The air curtain provides a very thin band of air from the unit downwards to the floor, preventing the outdoor air from infiltrating into the store,\" explains Arduini. \"The majority of problems happen in the summer, when warm humid air comes in. Then the air conditioning has to work harder and the humidity levels go up so you get condensation on your refrigerated product.\n\n\"You're using extra energy and the end result still isn't as good because your product is affected.\"\n\nAir curtains \u2013 if adjusted properly (a firm steady air flow) \u2013 save far more energy than they use.\n\nA final fix at Donald's Market was to replace the motors in refrigeration cases and walk in coolers (which keep cool air circulating) with electronically commutated motors (ECM's) which operate more smoothly and efficiently. Arduini says although all the motors were replaced at once at Donald's, most retailers opt to replace them one by one, as motors burn out.\n\nThe total energy savings from Donald's refrigeration improvements is estimated at more than 130,000 kWh per year \u2013 or about $7,600 in electricity costs. That brings the total energy savings for the Grocery Store makeover to about $11,000 a year.\n\n\"Energy is our second highest cost, after wages,\" says Gary Joe. \"So it's really significant to be able to save money there; it makes a big difference.\"\n\nRefrigeration Savings Summary\nArea Existing Retrofit Savings\nCold storage No strip curtains Strip curtains 26,600 $1,574.72\nMain entrance \/ main exit \/ rear loading doors No air curtains Air curtains 74,211 $4,393.29\nDairy cases No night cover Night cover 3,876 $229.46\nReach in refrigeration cases (dairy, meat, produce and freezer) No ECM's ECM's 22,888 $1,304.60\nWalk in coolers No ECM's ECM's 2,693 $153.48\nTotal from refrigeration\u00a0\u00a0\n130,267 $7,655.56\n\nComposting, recycling and more\n\nThe grocery store makeover included consultations with the Green Table Network and the City of Vancouver's Climate Protection Program. Donald's Market has now established a store composting program, improved recycling practices, and water conservation measures.\n\nIn addition, Joe says they are working to reduce packaging, and switch to better environmental alternatives (such as eliminating styrofoam) where possible. He's also taking his learnings... (truncated)",

        "text":"It is the crack of dawn when Elizabeth wakes for her morning prayers at 5:30 am. She is roused by the first birds chirping for the day\u00a0and starts to get her seven children ready for school.\n\nOnce the children are on their way, her farm work begins where Elizabeth cuts a trench with a practiced swing of her hoe. She toils for hours \u2013 weeding, planting and harvesting her crops. It can be backbreaking work and at 40 years of age, it does not get any easier.\n\nHer next big task is to collect firewood. Like most African women this burden falls on her and she spends hours collecting for cooking and heating in the absence of electricity or gas. She also needs to walk about 4 km daily to go to rivers and springs because of the lack of piped water and wells near her home.\n\nAt around midday she goes home to prepare lunch for her children who are coming back from school for lunch.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s a welcome reprieve from the daily grind of being a farmer, but as soon as lunch is finished, she is back in the fields again maintaining the small plot of land.\n\nTired from the day\u2019s activities she returns home to prepare dinner by 6.00 pm so that the children can eat early before they get too sleepy. It is a simple meal of ugali\u00a0(a stiff cornmeal porridge) served with chicken, prepared with love and care over a wood fire stove.\n\nThe children are fed and asleep. Finally, some peace at 8:00 pm when she recites the last Islamic prayers for the day.\n\nElizabeth was like many women farmers in Africa \u2013 working from dawn to dusk and beyond to survive as a subsistent farmer. But in 2015 at a village meeting, she heard about a new initiative to encourage farmers to grow cotton.\n\nLiving on the breadline meant that Elizabeth was wary of any new initiatives that did not guarantee a good return. There was too much to risk for the family. Elizabeth relied on cashews as a cash crop, but over the years the price had plummeted. There was no reliable buyer, leading to her living a vicious cycle of risk and poverty.\n\nHer ears pricked up when she heard that there was training, support in land preparation, provision of seeds and assistance with marketing from Base Titanium \u2013 a mining firm that was supporting farmer development near their Kwale mine \u2013 and Inclusive Business partner Business for Development.\n\nShe was excited about joining the local co-operative and was provided with all the inputs she needed to start growing cotton. She learnt that the costs of the inputs are deducted after the sale of produce \u2013 therefore reducing the financial risk to farmers.\n\nIt was the training that Elizabeth found to be the most useful. Armed with new knowledge, she felt confident in applying the new approaches, and achieved an excellent yield for her cotton and improved her income. She then applied similar techniques to her corn, sorghum, soybean and cowpea crops.\n\nNow, thanks to a combination of cotton, sorghum and soybean, the family has three cash crops to earn them a decent income. Elizabeth can now provide food security for her children, pay for school fees easily and give them a good education, use the extra money to improve their standard of living through improving the house and getting regular medical check-ups etc.\n\nElizabeth still works from dawn to dusk, but now her efforts are finally reaping rewards and she is now able to provide a better life for herself and her family.\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day\n\nHappy International Women\u2019s Day. This is an important day to celebrate and recognise all the work that women like Elizabeth are doing, and that it is integral to support them to achieve the SDGs.\n\nWomen are often viewed as the backbone of smallholder agriculture. Thanks to Inclusive Business models which provide them with training and tools, they are given the support needed to get out of the vicious cycle of poverty. Which not only means they can support themselves,\u00a0 but also support their whole family to live happier lives.",

On July 9 the decision was made to cut power and phone service to low lying buildings at the plant -- including the computer center. The DRP\/Test machine for another Monsanto Site was located there! It was decided to move this machine to the World Headquarters Campus about 30 miles from the plant so testing and maintenance could continue. Following shutdown, on July 10 power was cut and transformers pulled.\n\nPreparation began to minimize the effects of the flood that weekend. Raw material and finished product as well as the PBX, personal computers, office equipment and supplies were moved to higher ground or off-site. Volunteers from Carondelet, other plants and corporate headquarters began building \u201cCOOLEY DAM\u201d, a sandbag levee between the plant and the river. The levee was named for the plant manager.\n\nOn July 12 it was decided to move all critical computer processing to World Headquarters and business operations to another building north of the plant. A temporary office was set up with phones, furniture, PC\u2019s, office supplies, etc.\n\nCellular phones and modems were distributed by Monsanto\u2019s DRP group.\n\nFor computer processing, the in-house HP DRP machine was used. This system had recently been delivered, configured and had a pre-test run on July 8 (just a few days before disaster struck). Recovery began immediately from back-up tapes. Since Carondelet uses an HP Classic machine and the DRP machine is an HP Spectrum, a migration was required with the recovery.\n\nMIS personnel from several of our locations worked feverishly to recover computer processing. The operating system, critical applications and electronic mail were functional by July 13. During recovery, prewired phone lines were installed to allow for dial-in access. A 24 port pad was installed at the temporary office to the X.25 WAN providing quick access to all systems. Necessary printers were also attached to the pad.\n\nOn July 18 the River Des Peres levee broke, breaching \u201cCooley Dam.\u201d Water flooded the warehouse, engineering, Admin and Lab buildings. Although damage was extensive, much was saved because precautionary steps had been taken.\n\nBusiness ran smoothly, although production ceased. In preparation for production start-up, more applications were added to the DRP system.\n\nJust when we thought production could begin, electricity was once again cut and an evacuation was ordered for the plant and the temporary office on July 30th. Fifty-one propane tanks located less than one mile away at another company\u2019s premises floated from their cradles. Some of the tanks began to leak and an explosion was imminent. Of course, this occurred during the month-end closing cycle!\n\nOn August 3 plant personnel were relocated to Monsanto\u2019s World Headquarters Command Center to complete closing. PC\u2019s were set up to access all critical systems. Closing was successful, checks were printed and delivered on time. The following weekend (Aug 7-8) the evacuation order was lifted. The crisis had been resolved safely without explosion.\n\nOn August 9, everyone returned to the plant and temporary office. For the first time since July 18 the computer center could be reached by land rather than boat. Extensive cleanup and decontamination were required before re-entering water soaked buildings.\n\nThe Carondelet plant was able to return to operations exactly one month after the initial threat. The plant came back strong, setting record production in the first full month following the flood.\n\nThis has been a learning experience for Monsanto. For many years we have tested our ability to recover from a disaster; however, we had never attempted to return. The difficulty is merging files restored to the DRP machine (the critical ones) with files and applications not restored. Further complicating the restoration was a migration from a Spectrum to a Classic Machine.\n\nAlthough this was a tragedy for the Carondelet Plant, things could have been worse had they not been prepared.\n\nJeanne M. Grimes, CDRP, is on the Computer Task Group with Monsanto, headquarter in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nAdd comment\n\nSecurity code",

The Korean-based steelmaker, beside astir 6.5 percent of gross revenue approaching from stainless steel, is the world's fourth or 5th largest, depending upon amount produced or flea market capitalization.\n\nAccording to the company's 2006 annual report, POSCO exports much than 70 percent of its steel products intersectant Asia, largely to China, Japan and southeastern Asia. In effect to register in flood nickel prices, the steelmaker proclaimed it would open engineering nickel-free unsullied steels. So did European steelmakers ThyssenKrupp and Outokumpu, which has to a great extent relied on its primary solid solution products.\n\nWould a uninterrupted mass meeting in the moly rate develop in the aforementioned rebound metallic element just this minute suffered?

He believes by 2015, the metal terms could get 'interesting.'\n\nBut, this wasn't the most primitive inkling of brewing worry for atomic number 42 buyers. In early May, one merchant told American Metal Market magazine, \"We retributive don't have any endow accessible.\" He lamented that original moly producers, likewise well-known as action producers, have 'nothing to market correct now.'\n\nOn June 18th, China is foretold to denote the export quotas for molybdenum products it has assigned to a constrained figure of exporters. Potential labor disputes at cu mines in Mexico and Chile could added eat up available metallic element provide after that in June. A Chilean labor spokesperson warned of a 'hard and long work stoppage.' Molybdenum deep-mined as a event of cu harvest accounts for around 60 percentage of the planetary supply.\n\nPost ads:\n600 Thread Count Egyptian Cotton Attached WATERBED Sheet \/ 600 thread count FULL\/QUEEN 3pc Duvet Set \"WHITE\" \/ 600 Thread Count Percale Egyptian Cotton Sheet Set, Queen, \/ 600 Thread count Queen size Sateen Stripe Sheet Set 100% \/ 600 Twin Extra Long size Solid Sheet Set, 100% Egyptian \/ 600-Thread-Count 100% Egyptian Cotton (NOT MICROFIBER \/ 600-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton 600TC Duvet Set and 2 \/ 600-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton 600TC Sheet Set, Twin, \/ 600-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton Duvet Set and 2 Shams, \/ 600-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton Sheet Set, Olympic Queen, \/ 600TC Cotton Rich FULL\/QUEEN SOLID BLUE DUVET COVER SET BY \/ 7 PCS King Size Luxury Jacquard Comforter Bed Set \/ 7 Piece Cal King Sydney Bedding Comforter Bedding Set \/ 7pc King size Santa Grey embroidered Comforter set By \/ 7pc Queen size Pacifica Coffee Comforter set By \/ 7pcs Faux Silk Leopard Skin Flocking King Size Comforter \/ 7Pcs King Amaryllis Jacquard Bed in a Bag Comforter Set \/ 7Pcs King Dahlia Brown and Rose Bedding Comforter Set\n\nAt this pace, molybdenum evaluation could be completely wedged as proterozoic as this summer. By close year, if former molybdenum harvest doesn't speedily acceleration to unite the demand, the valuation climate could turn for end-users. Some traders consider moly prices could soon tread softly preceding past charge peaks two years ago. \"Things are going to get a lot firmer because there's a shortage of material,\" one merchandiser according in advance this week. \"There's not a lot on the ground.\"\n\nAccording to unlike down-the-road forecasts, the sorcerous economic process numeral is 460 cardinal pounds of metal. Adams predicts that projected occidental world call for could make this ingestion by 2015. Others agree to unassailable moly demand could bring this reference point activity a few eld closer.\n\nAnother concern is one we highlighted in a abovementioned nonfiction.\n\nstockinterview.com\/News\/11082006\/Roasting-molybdenum.html USGS metal goods professional Michael Magyar warned of a bottleneck, \"... we can't roasted more than more moly authorization now. No one is actively permitting for much preparation capability in North America.\n\nAdditional preparation size is, however, future online this time period or next, courtesy of Molymet. Adams points out, \"With the ontogeny in pressure a new roaster, the massiveness of the new Molymet roaster is needed both two eld.\" Adams further explained, \"Without further land a roaster constriction could hap in 2011. Molymet campaign other roaster going on for this time, but this would merely permit another two eld sarcoma.\"\n\nIn his presentation, Adams glimpsed in the in store. While western planetary pressure should keep to annually mushroom by three percent, call for in China and the C.I.S. could loudening by more than 10 proportionality every year. \"The cooperative worldwide upshot would be an annual progress charge per unit of nearly 4.5 percent,\" he predicted. \"Western mines will have to rise productivity by at tiniest 6 percent per year.\"\n\nAs we and others have concluded, Adams forecast, \"Increased end product at capital (moly) mines will be needed to crowd the gap forgotten 2009.\"\n\nWe presume delegates from the subaltern metal mining attendees emotionally began pop bubbly corks after Adams proclaimed this barb. But it was his next two points which investors should digest:\n\no New or shuttered original mines will have to amenable by 2011\n\no By 2013, ongoing opening mines and Climax could be at capacity\n\nHigh-Level Growth in the Molybdenum Chemical Market\n\nHaving researched mo for more than than one year, lone just now did a brace of technical experts () relief us comprehend how more mo is used in the electrical device tubes of atomic and chemical process vegetation. Because of the varied applications for this metal, there is smaller number faithful data something like the mo plane figure than in others we've explored, e.g. metallic element.\n\nWe carry on to accumulate facts for our side by side publication, \"Investing in the Great Molybdenum Bull Market,' and will offering our elaborated research in ripe August.\n\nWe have unconcealed two strong-growth areas for atomic number 42 applications.\n\nIt's not simply the metal bazaar which uses mo. Although the unstained and low metal markets suggest in the order of common fraction of atomic number 42 usage, the fastest growing open market appears to be catalysts in the moly chemical flea market.\n\nAccording to a interpreter for the Albemarle Corporation, moly intake in the accelerator unit could vegetate by more than 30 proportion by 2011. The natural science plane figure could consume as noticeably as 30 million more pounds in the 2006 to 2011 instance interval.\n\nThe planetary catalyst open market is anticipated to reach US$13 billion in sales this yr. Of this the gas refining two-dimensional figure should have astir 35 million pounds of mo. The moly is previously owned as a hydroprocessing (HPC) activator.\n\nGrowing intercontinental emergency for rough oil, dynamical gasoline specifications and physique in call for for air power and technologist oil should impart to molybdenum necessity.\n\nBecause the general point of crude oil has to a large extent deteriorated, finished the ult 25 years, much atomic number 42 could be used up as a accelerator during the plant method. Sulfur pleased in U.S.-imported oil has doubled complete this aforesaid time length. Molybdenum-based catalysts are utilised to fish out sulphur from petroleum, petrochemicals and coal-derived liquids\n\nTighter specs ended the historical 15 age have demanded a high acting activator and more restrained metallic element in those catalysts. Over this clip frame, catalyst economic process per tub of unskilled oil has multiple - an mediocre cancer charge of five pct per period of time.\n\nOne industry trained expects global HPC activator advance to every year indefinite quantity by eight per centum linking 2006 and 2010. Molybdenum uptake for this use could amplification by 46 proportionality done 2010. Annual body process could growth to more than 60 million pounds of atomic number 42.\n\nLack of New Primary Mining Supply\n\nThe ideal mo concentrates one sold by the atomic number 29 producers, as event mining, cover 40 - 45 percentage Mo. Concentrates from first producers repeatedly norm 50 - 55 per centum.\n\nAs a result, primary mo production dealing proposal a more lucky compact. Technical moly, as well famed Mo03 (molybdenum trioxide) specifies 57 proportion Mo and contains smaller amount than 0.05 percentage atomic number 29 and 0.1 proportionality sulphur. Primary metal producers deal in concentrates near minor amounts of hurtful atmospheric condition.\n\nBecause the compress is 'cleaner,' smaller amount roasting is enforced to acclivity the material to school oxide specification. Less electricity is exhausted to force the multi-hearth furnaces during the roasting course of action. The cleansing agent prim... (truncated)",
