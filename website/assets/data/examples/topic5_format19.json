The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.\n\n233 ppi233 ppi\u00a0\n\nTechnology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.\n\nScreen-to-body ratio58.36 %63.03 %\u00a0\nColors16 777 21616 777 216\u00a0\nFeaturesLight sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass (Corning Gorilla Glass)Light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass\u00a0\nCamera5 megapixels5 megapixels\u00a0\nFeaturesAutofocusAutofocus, Geo tagging\u00a0\nCamcorder1280x720 (720p HD)Yes\u00a0\nFeaturesVideo callingVideo calling\u00a0\nFront-facing camera2 megapixels0.3 megapixels VGA\u00a0\n\nProcessor - The processor is the main computing component of a phone and is a major factor when it comes to the overall speed of the device.

It uses satellites in order to detect your location. Works best in clear weather. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. \u201cAssisted\u201d means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization. GLONASS - GLONASS is a global positioning system, developed by the Russian Federation.
