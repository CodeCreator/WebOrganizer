It\u2019s measured in \u201cpixels per inch\u201d, or ppi. The higher the number, the more detailed and good-looking the display is.\n\n141 ppi146 ppi\u00a0\n\nTechnology - There are two main screen technologies currently used in phones and tablets: LCD and AMOLED. The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.\n\nColors262 144262 144\u00a0\nTouchscreen\u00a0Yes\u00a0\nFeatures\u00a0Light sensor, Proximity sensor\u00a0\nCamera\u00a03 megapixels\u00a0\nFeatures\u00a0Digital zoom, Geo tagging\u00a0\nCamcorder\u00a0Yes\u00a0\nFeatures\u00a0Video sharing\u00a0\nBuilt-in storage0.1 GB0.189 GB\u00a0\nStorage expansionmicroSD, microSDHC up to 16 GBmicroSD, microSDHC\u00a0\nTalk time6.86 hours\nthe average is 12 h (745 min)\n3.00 hours\nthe average is 12 h (745 min)\nStand-by time21.0 days (504 hours)\nthe average is 20 days (492 h)\n10.4 days (250 hours)\nthe average is 20 days (492 h)\nCapacity900 mAh1000 mAh\u00a0\nspecifications continue after the ad\nMusic player\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFeaturesAlbum art cover, Music recognition\u00a0\u00a0\nGSM850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz\u00a0\nUMTS850, 1900 MHz850, 1900 MHz\u00a0\nDataEDGE, UMTS, HSDPA 3.6 Mbit\/sEDGE, UMTS, HSDPA 3.6 Mbit\/s\u00a0\n\nPositioning - This field shows the positioning systems supported by the device. There are three main types: GPS, A-GPS and GLONASS. GPS - This is one of the most widespread global positioning technologies, developed and maintained by the U.S. government. It uses satellites in order to detect your location. Works best in clear weather. A-GPS - A-GPS stands for Assisted GPS and is the industry standard for positioning and navigation. \u201cAssisted\u201d means that it can use local wireless networks, in addition to satellites, for quicker and more precise localization. GLONASS - GLONASS is a global positioning system, developed by the Russian Federation. It\u2019s very similar to GPS, but isn\u2019t so popular in cell phones.\n\nBluetooth2.1, EDR2.0\u00a0\nUSBUSB 2.0Yes\u00a0\nFeaturesMass storage device, USB charging\u00a0\u00a0\nOtherComputer syncComputer sync\u00a0\nOther features\nNotificationsMusic ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, SpeakerphoneMusic ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones (72 voices), Vibration, Phone profiles, Speakerphone\u00a0\nSensors\u00a0Accelerometer\u00a0\nOtherVoice dialing, Voice commands (Speaker independent), Voice recording, TTY\/TDD, Push-to-TalkVoice recording\u00a0\nOfficially announced\u00a030 Mar 2009\u00a0\n\nTo see the full specifications with in-depth details click here.\n\nLatest stories",

This means that out of 100 PCs with exactly the same components, 41 performed better. The overall PC percentile is the average of each of its individual components.\nProcessorWith a good single core score, this CPU can easily handle the majority of general computing tasks. Despite its good single core score this processor isn't appropriate for workstation use due to its relatively weak multi-core performance. Finally, with a gaming score of 60.8%, this CPU's suitability for 3D gaming is good.\nGraphics23.7% is a below average 3D score (RTX 2060S = 100%). This GPU can handle older games but it will struggle to render recent games at resolutions greater than 1080p. (Note: general computing tasks don't require 3D graphics)\nBoot Drive50.3% is a reasonable SSD score. This drive enables fast boots and responsive applications.\nMemory16GB is enough RAM to run any version of Windows and it's more than sufficient for nearly all games. 16GB also allows for very large file and system caches, software development and batch photo editing\/processing.\nOS VersionWindows 10 is the most recent version of Windows, and the best to date in our opinion.\nMotherboardGigabyte GA-H61M-DS2 \u00a0(all builds)\nMemory11.7 GB free of 16 GB @ 1.6 GHz\nDisplay1920 x 1080 - 32 Bit colors\nOSWindows 10\nBIOS Date20140930\nUptime3.3 Days\nRun DateDec 04 '19 at 15:11\nRun Duration111 Seconds\nRun User VNM-User\nBackground CPU5%\n\n\u00a0PC Performing as expected (59th percentile)\n\nActual performance vs. expectations.

        "text":"The quality of the web hosting service that you will receive for your websites depends not only on the features which a particular plan comes with, but also on the hardware your web applications run on. Increased CPU speeds, for example, indicate that the processes running on the hosting server will be performed quicker, while more physical memory (RAM) means that more processes can run together. The grade of the hardware could also influence the general performance and dependability of the server. Since the hosting service today features not only file storage, but also databases, e-mails, logs, etc, more processing power is required to run all of the system processes and to make sure that they function properly and with no lag. If the hardware is not powerful enough, the result will be sluggish sites or even service timeouts as the machine will not be able to deal with all requests to the sites hosted on it.\n24-core servers, hardware in Shared Web Hosting\nIn case you obtain a shared web hosting account from our company, you will be able to reap the benefits of a very powerful setup which will provide amazing performance of any web application which you decide to host on our end. We've employed a revolutionary cloud platform where each and every aspect of the hosting service is managed by an individual cluster of servers. Each machine which is part of any of the clusters contains 64 GB RAM which will enable you to run many different apps, while the speed of your sites shall be guaranteed by powerful 24-core processors and solid-state drives. Every cluster can be extended by attaching additional machines for even more substantial power, which means that there isn't any upper limit for the system resources which our clients could use at any given time. Unlike many competitors, we don't run everything on just a single machine and we do not save on the hardware at the expense of effectiveness.\n24-core servers, hardware in Semi-dedicated Hosting\nIf you buy a semi-dedicated hosting account from our company, it will be generated on an advanced cloud Internet hosting platform which employs brand new and amazingly powerful hosting servers. 24-core processors plus 64 GB RAM will ensure that all your Internet sites will operate fast and with no service interruptions. The overall system resources that we have at our disposal are virtually endless since we use a cloud platform where every single part of the service is taken care of by an entire cluster of servers. If we need extra power, we just attach more machines where they are required and if we want additional disk space for files or databases, we put more solid-state drives. The SSDs which all of our servers use will enhance the speed and stability of your websites even more.\n24-core servers, hardware in VPS Web Hosting\nIn case you acquire a virtual private server from our firm, it will be generated on a powerful machine, so all the system resources which are listed in the plan characteristics on our website shall be guaranteed all of the time. Every single physical server is equipped with multiple processors with a total of 24 cores and 64 gigabytes RAM. Due to the fact that our VPS plans are scalable, we make sure that in case all clients on the server opt to upgrade, there'll be ample system resources, so you can use what you've paid for at all times. What is more, all the physical servers include solid-state drives that are considerably quicker when compared with the classic HDDs, so your websites will perform at their top speed. The server configuration is among the basic reasons behind our service level guarantees as we never make any kind of compromise regarding the hardware and you will always get the very best possible web hosting service.\n24-core servers, hardware in Dedicated Servers Hosting\nThe dedicated servers that we offer have several hardware setups so as to give you a choice to get the ideal one in terms of the system resources you need and the funds you have, but all of them are really powerful and will give you outstanding performance for any kind of Internet site. Depending on what you wish to run, you can use up to 12 CPU cores with over 24 GHz processing speed along with as much as 16 GB of physical memory entirely for your web apps. All parts that we use for the servers are tested carefully both before and after the server is assembled to make sure that there's no faulty hardware. In case any kind of issue occurs nonetheless, the support crew that is available 24\/7 in our US datacenter can easily change any part and recover the adequate functioning of your server in no more than a few minutes.",

How to integrate Icecat LIVE JavaScript.\nMaximum scan size*\n216 x 356 mm\nOptical scanning resolution*\nHow many pixels a scanner can see. Most commonly, this is measured in dots per inch (dpi).For example, a typical flatbed scanner will use a scanning head with 300 sensors per inch, so it can sample 300 dots per inch (dpi) in one direction. To scan in the other direction, it will move the scanning head along the page, stopping 300 times per inch, so it can scan 300 dpi in the other direction as well. This scanner would have an optical resolution of 300 x 300 dpi. Some manufacturers stop the scanning head more frequently as it moves down the page, so their machines have resolutions of 300 x 600 dpi or 300x1200 dpi.\n600 x 1200 DPI\nColour scanning*\nIndicates whether this product scans in colour.\nDuplex scanning*\nFeature of computer scanners and multifunction printers (MFPs) that allows the automatic scanning of a sheet of paper on both sides.\nInput colour depth\nColour depth of the input into the product. The colour depth is either the number of bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel, in a bitmapped image or video frame buffer, or the number of bits used for each color component of a single pixel. High-end laptops have 24-bit colour depth.\n24 bit\nFilm scanning*\nDevice made for scanning photographic film directly into a computer without the use of any intermediate printmaking. It provides several benefits over using a flatbed scanner to scan in a print of any size: the photographer has direct control over cropping and aspect ratio from the original, unmolested image on film; and many film scanners have special software or hardware that removes scratches and film grain and improves color reproduction from film.\nGray scale levels\nFlatbed scan speed (b\/w, A4)\n0.25 sec\/page\nScanner type*\nA scanner is a device that optically scans images, printed text, handwriting, or an object, and converts it to a digital image. Common examples found in offices are variations of the desktop (or flatbed) scanner where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning. There are different types of scanners e.g. flatbed, pen, sheet-feed.\nColour of product*\nThe colour e.g. red, blue, green, black, white.\nSensor type*\nA sensor is a convertor than measures a physical quality (light, temperature etc.) and displays this electronically on a device.\nDaily duty cycle (max)*\nThe maximum percentage of time a machine or piece of equipment can be in operation for in one day in relation to the time it must remain out of operation. For instance, a max daily duty cycle of 30 percent means it will operate for a maximum 30 percent of the day and then not be used for the other 70 percent of the day.\n30000 pages\nInput capacity\nAuto document feeder (ADF) input capacity\nNumber of sheets this product can hold in its ADF tray; expressed in sheets\n50 sheets\nPaper handling\nMaximum ISO A-series paper size *\nISO A-series sizes (A0...A9)\nDifferent sizes of paper from A0 (big) to A9 (small).

The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays.\n\nScreen-to-body ratio26.89 %31.26 %\u00a0\nColors16 777 216262 144\u00a0\nFeaturesLight sensor\u00a0\u00a0\nCamera2 megapixels3.2 megapixels\u00a0\nAperture size\n\nAperture size - The aperture of a camera is the opening through which light travels before it reaches the camera sensor.
