        "text":"Who we are\n\nE-mail Print PDF\n\nWe are (PCAI) PARAGON CHRISTIAN ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL, INC. -\u00a0 PCAI is officially and legally recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) and holds a \"Group Status\" in which it has\u00a0been given the\u00a0authority by the IRS\u00a0to issue the 501(c)(3) to qualified\u00a0religious organizations referred to as \"subordinates.\" Each ministry (subordinate)\u00a0is autonomous and sovereign operated by its' own governing board.\n\nPCAI was organized and chartered in 1976 under the name \"Christian Ministries\" - a local non-denominational religious organization in Monroe, Louisiana.\u00a0In 1988, the leadership with over forty years of ministry experience, met to discuss a fresh vision for soul winning, evangelism, church planting, missions, and Christian education.\u00a0 During this meeting they\u00a0expanded the\u00a0organization nationally and internationally under the name of Association of Evangelical Gospel Assemblies. In 2011 the primary legal\u00a0name\u00a0was changed to PARAGON CHRISTIAN ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL, INC. to\u00a0better express the vision and purpose of the ministry maintaining the former name as a tradename. Our desire is to reach out\u00a0to the whole Body of Christ with the ministry resources God has given us.\n\n\nPCAI\u00a0can help you receive your ministry credentials (Licensed & Ordination through our ministerial\u00a0fellowship)\u00a0for qualified applicants (both men and women), and offers the 501(c)(3) tax exempt status under our group exemption to various types\u00a0faith-based charitable and\u00a0religious based ministries.\u00a0 We can do in 30 days what would take one to three years if you acted alone in obtaining your 501(c)(3) status directly from the IRS. What a great benefit! You can remain independent...yet connected (autonomous and sovereign). Being a fellowship, we differ from a denominational structure. \u00a0As such, we adhere to\u00a0and believe\u00a0that your\u00a0Christian nonprofit organizations should operate autonomously. Therefore, all property and assets are held in the name of your ministry and under the\u00a0guidance of your board of directors.\u00a0To be in compliance with the IRS rulings, we only require that the president of the board hold credentials\/membership with PCAI.\n\n\nAlready obtained your 501(c)(3)? We offer an affiliation program for ministries for the purpose of fellowship and networking.\nOne of the primary missions of\u00a0PCAI is fulfilled through its educational divisions - Omega Bible Institute & Seminary and Evangel Christian University of America - training hundreds of indigenous ministers and those wanted to learn more about the Bible\u00a0in many countries and in the USA. Students from numerous denominations enroll in a par excellence study program to earn a bachelor, master, or doctorate degree.\u00a0 When you become a member of PCAI, you become part of the vision to educate laymen and ministers around the globe for the glory of God.\u00a0\n\nA ministry TO and FOR ministry professionals,\u00a0PCAI is committed to helping individuals like YOU move forward in the work HE has called you to. Our General Executive Board & Leaders have many years of experience and stand ready to pray for you and assist you in the expansion of your ministry. They are also available to you in times of need and in your personal spiritual growth.\u00a0\n\n\nOur calling and purpose is to \u2026Serve, Equip and Assist You in Fulfilling\nYour God-Given Call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername Password Remember Me Lost Password?

Quentin Young and Claudia Fegan advocate for HB 311, Rep. Mary Flowers 'Health Care for All' Illinois Act'\n\nPaying For Universal Health Care - And Not Getting It\n\nOriginal Research from HCAI\n\nHB 311, the Health Care for All Illinois Act, could save nough to provide health care for all. Comprehensive, universal health care for all Illinoisans doesn't need to mean higher taxes and more spending.\n\nThis study from HCAI shows that nearly $18 billion of Illinois current health spending is diverted to useless administrative tasks inherent in a for-profit private insurance-based health system.\n\nIllinois can recover that $18 billion and use it to provide universal care - but only if we're willing to cut out the parasitic private insurance industry.\n\nRead the full study here\n\nHow Can We Afford Universal Health Care?\n\nWith a looming $2 billion deficit in the state budget, how in the world can Illinois afford a single payer universal health care system?\n\nThe answer - confirmed by the state's own independent financial consulting firm - is that the system pays for itself. By removing $17 billion in wasteful private insurance paperwork, Illinois' single payer system would provide comprehensive, universal coverage without raising Illinoisans health spending. In fact, for the majority of Illinois families and businesses, the single-payer program would be a tax cut.\n\nThis HCAI financing paper explains the program in detail.\n\nSingle Payer in Illinois\n\nFor more information on single-payer organizing in IL, check out the web site of the Illinois Single-Payer Coalition.\n\nClick here for upcoming single-payer events in Illinois.\n\nPNHP Illinois supports Occupy Wall Street and all Illinois Occupy movements.\n\nIn November 2011 the leadership of PNHP IL adopted the following statement of support for Occupy Wall Street and all Occupy movements in IL.\n\nClick here to read the statement\n\nIllinoisans already pay enough for comprehensive universal health insurance - we just don't get it. This is becasue private insurers and the administrative waste they generate consumes nearly a third of our health spending. Replacing insurance companies with a single public payer would save Illinois more than $17 billion per year, enough to cover everyone. Single payer bill HB 942 (\"The Illinois Universal Health Care Act,\" formerly \"The Health Care for All Illinois Act\") would do this.\n\nRead a Summary of the Single-Payer Plan\n\nAnswers to Frequently Asked Questions\n\nClick here to Learn More\n\nHB 311 'Health Care for All Illinois Act' co-sponsors Rep.
