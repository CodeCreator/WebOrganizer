Currently, 74 out of our 96 children are attending school, but we do not have enough funds to send the last 22 of them to\u00a0the School Systems of Jinja, Uganda. We are in need also to buy food at the orphanage that will provide for a full month that will cost $270.00, including all the spices and cooking oil we require for the month.

We pay the Orphanage rent every month of $350.00 for all the Orphanage buildings, we call upon anyone willing to help the less fortunate.\n\n    We call upon everyone who is willing to donate whatever you have, big or small, it can make a difference and change the lives of our children as well!It is good to give and giving with all your heart!

It is a great compliment to those pupils that are chosen, as it shows that their peers have placed their trust in them.\n\n\nDuring the year, the Council take part in a variety of activities which help to provide information about the well-being of our pupils and how to make our school a better place for everyone.\n\nChristmas Card Delivery:\n\nThis year each class created some shared Christmas cards to deliver to our business neighbours in the village.

We also regularly look around the school at our learning environment and make suggestions as to how it could be fun and engaging for us.\n\n\nOur latest project was \u2018Healthy Living\u2019 and in the dining room we devised a plan to put up a display called \u2018A Minion ways to be healthy\u2019 where the whole school could be involved in sharing their healthy lifestyle tips!\u00a0\n\n\n\nWritten By Lauren Hobbs (Sapphire class school council representative)",

This requires knowledge of the interdependent components that together constitute the \"environment\", as well as a commitment to protect this environment by improving the manner in which water, land and energy are utilized by humans.\nThe Department's research activities have several general areas of activities. One focuses on water and includes hydrology, geochemistry, land-plant-atmosphere interactions and oceanography. A second activity is in the use of stable isotopes for reconstructions of paleoclimatic and of biosphere-atmosphere dynamics, and a third is in the area of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and cloud physics. A fourth area of research is in planetary sciences. \u00a0The Department is distinguished by the interactions among scientists from different backgrounds and expertise, which is critical to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the global environment. We also promote international collaboration based on short- and long-term visits for research and training by scientists who complement existing activities in the Department. The interdisciplinary nature of the Department is well reflected in the academic training of the research students. Their backgrounds vary enormously from physics and mathematics through geology to biology. We encourage the participation of students who are interested in not only investigating in depth a specific subject, but who are also interested in a broader, more integrative approach to science.\n\nScientistsShow details\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Brian Berkowitz\n\n    Prof. Brian Berkowitz\n\n    Development of chemical methods for remediation of water polluted by organic compounds and heavy metals.\n    Fluid flow and chemical transport in groundwater systems.\n    Percolation, scaling and statistical physics models of structural and dynamic processes in geological formations.\n    Experimental and theoretical analysis of reactive transport and precipitation\/dissolution patterns in porous media.\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Dr. Itay Halevy\n\n    Dr. Itay Halevy\n\n    The co-evolution of planetary climate and geochemistry on multiple timescales\n    The geological and geochemical history of Earth, planets and satellites\n    Global biogeochemical cycles and their interaction with the climate system\n    Drivers and consequences of episodes of global climatic and geochemical change\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Jacob Karni\n\n    Prof. Jacob Karni\n\n    Carbon dioxide dissociation using concentrated solar energy\n    Development of directly irradiated solar receivers.\n    Energy transport in particles seeded flows at high temperature.\n    Development of alternative fuels and their production methods using solar energy\n    Carbon dioxide dissociation using concentrated solar energy\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Dr. Yohai Kaspi\n\n    Dr. Yohai Kaspi\n\n    Geophysical fluid dynamics\n    Atmospheric dynamics on Earth and other planets\n    Storm track dynamics\n    Geostrophic turbulence\n    Climate dynamics\n    Planetary interiors\n    Gravitational signature of internal dynamics on giant planets\n    Jets on giant planets\n    Internal tides\n    The Juno mission to Jupiter\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Ilan Koren\n\n    Prof. Ilan Koren\n\n    The twilight zone - convective clouds and their interaction with the free atmosphere\n    Collaboration with:\u00a0 NOAA-ESRL Boulder CO.\n    Anthropogenic Effects on Clouds and Precipitation and the Derived Climate Forcing\n    Collaboration with:\u00a0 NASA-GSFC, UMBC\n    Cloud microphysics and dynamics\n    Cloud classification and cloud textures and morphology\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Yinon Rudich\n\n    Prof. Yinon Rudich\n\n    Health effects of atmospheric particulate matter\n    Ice nucleation by atmospheric particles\n    The transport of microorganisms in the atmosphere and their possible biogeochemical effects\n    Optical properties of atmospheric organic aerosols\n\n  \u2022 Picture of Prof. Dan Yakir\n\n    Prof. Dan Yakir\n\n    Developing the use of stable isotopes (in particular, 13C, 18O, 15N, 2H) as tracers of biogeochemical cycles on land.\n    Environmental and climatic influence on the exchange of trace gases and energy between plants, soil and the atmosphere.\n    Climatic influence on the natural abundance of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in CO2, O2, H2O and organic matter.",

        "text":"Keep Kids Safe\n\nUnderstanding Educator Childhood Sexual Abuse\n\nIt is important to understand why\u00a0and how\u00a0childhood sexual abuse shapes a child for a lifetime. The long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse can follow survivors throughout life. Additionally, these consequences tend to disguise themselves as a difficulty adjusting to or difficulty coping with the responsibilities of normal adulthood.\n\nThe emotional scars of child molestation in a trusted setting, like a school, do not easily fade. Indeed, they often impact the child as they grow into an adult, their adult relationships, and even the relationships with their own children. Unfortunately, victims of educator childhood sex abuse are much more likely to find themselves in dysfunctional or even abusive adult relationships.\n\nFor families trying to understand how to best support a child that has experienced sexual abuse in a school environment, it\u2019s important to note that children who are disbelieved, blamed, or ostracized experience a greater sense of betrayal than those who are supported, believed, and shown understanding.\n\nPreventing Educator Childhood Sexual Abuse\n\nEducation and information is the key to stopping sexual abuse in a school setting. Pedophiles engage in a predictable behavior which starts with a grooming process and ends with the molestation of a child. Knowing what to look for and what to do when you see such behavior is the key to stopping sexual abuse before it occurs.
