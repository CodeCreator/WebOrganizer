In its report filed in 1977, the Msekwa Commission underscored the need for on the need to keep the laws of Tanzania constantly attuned to the changing Tanzanian society. No law, Msekwa Commission pointed out, which is not constantly nourished with new ideas, can be an effective instrument for revolutionary change in any society. Such a law will sooner than later become a mere irrelevance to society.Law Reform Commission of Tanzania Act Cap 171 [R.E 2002] concretised recommendations of Msekwa Commission and established Law Reform Commission as a law reform agency with wide ranging responsibilities that include to:\n\n  1. reform laws of Tanzania so as to bring them to fit changing socio-economic circumstances and aspirations of people of Tanzania;\n  2. undertake studies and propose reform of the philosophy underlying the various laws;\n  3. recommend new laws, statutory institutions that give new dimensions to the existing law, and\n  4. propose new laws, new principles, new remedies, new machinery and to meet the challenges of law as Tanzanian society strive to meet the expectations of every citizen.\n\nThe Commission was established under the Law Reform Commission of Tanzania Act Cap 171 [R.E 2002]. It took two years of hard work under the able Chairmanship of the late Justice Yona Mwakasendo to physically bring the Commission into operation in 1983. Hon. Mwakasendo chaired the Commission from\u00a0 1983 to 1984. Other most distinguished Tanzanians who served time as Chairmen of Law Reform Commission include:\n\n  1. Hon. Justice Damian Lubuva- from\u00a0 1984 to 1985. Justice Lubuva is now Chairman of the National Electrol Commission (NEC);\n  2. Hon. Justice (rtd) Hamisi Msumi- from 1986 \u2013 1990;\n  3. Hon. Justice (rtd) Raymond Mwaikasu- from\u00a0\u00a0 1991 to 1995;\n  4. The Late Hon. Judge (rtd) Anthony Bahati- from 1995 to 2006;\n  5. Hon. Justice Ibrahim H. Juma- from\u00a0 2007 to 2013.\n  6. Hon. Judge Aloysius Mujulizi from March 2013 to May 2017\n\nSecretary of the Commission is the chief executive officer responsible to the Commission for the day to day operations and the management of the records of the Commission. Several distinguished public officers have served as Commission Secretary during the past twenty five years:\n\n  1. Mr. Nathaniel Issa- from\u00a0 1984 to\u00a0 1990;\n  2. Hon. Justice (rtd) Stephen E.N. Ihema- from\u00a0 1990 to\u00a0 1999;\n  3. Hon. Justice Bethuel M.K. Mmilla- from\u00a0 2000 to\u00a0 2002. Hon. Mmilla is a Judge of the High Court of Tanzania;\n  4. Hon. Lady Justice Mary S. Shangali- from\u00a0\u00a0 2003 to 2003. Hon. Shangali is a Judge of the High Court of Tanzania;\n  5. Hon. Mathias M. Chikawe- from\u00a0 2003 to 2005.\n  6.

Korosso from 2012 to 2014. Hon Korosso is now the Judge of High Court of Tanzania\n  9. Mr. Casmir Kyuki\u00a0\u00a0 to date\n\nLaw, the subject matter of reform touches all aspects of life and livelihood. Reform of the law must of necessity involve more than the Law Reform Commission. In this day and age of monumental national, regional and global changes reflected in international treaties and agreements, Law Reform Commission alone cannot single handedly undertake reform activities without close expertise and cooperation from other sectors and from an informed public opinion. Law Reform Commission will strive to cultivate and nurture a close working relationship with all the three branches of State power. The Commission will assist to inform the public who in return will provide the Commission with suggestions of areas requiring law reform.\n\nTo cultivate an informed public opinion, Law Reform Commission will make available to the general public important documents that influence or otherwise informs the executive, legislative and judicial activities taking place in Tanzania. You will find on this website the following documents which inform the law reform process:\n\n  1. Treaties and Conventions that United Republic of Tanzania has so far ratified;\n  2. Updated Index of the Laws of Tanzania;\n  3. List of all Subsidiary Legislation;\n  4. Judgments and legal principles discussed by the Court of Appeal of Tanzania;\n  5. Reports and Position Papers on Law Reform; and\n  6. Laws of East African Community.\n  7. Ongoing reforms programmes\n\nLaw Reform Commission of Tanzania hopes this site will be a useful to all and a ready source of ideas and suggestions on law reform.\n\nPowered by WordPress | Designed by: Premium WordPress Themes | Thanks to Themes Gallery, Bromoney and Wordpress Themes",

        "text":"Keep Kids Safe\n\nUnderstanding Educator Childhood Sexual Abuse\n\nIt is important to understand why\u00a0and how\u00a0childhood sexual abuse shapes a child for a lifetime. The long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse can follow survivors throughout life. Additionally, these consequences tend to disguise themselves as a difficulty adjusting to or difficulty coping with the responsibilities of normal adulthood.\n\nThe emotional scars of child molestation in a trusted setting, like a school, do not easily fade. Indeed, they often impact the child as they grow into an adult, their adult relationships, and even the relationships with their own children. Unfortunately, victims of educator childhood sex abuse are much more likely to find themselves in dysfunctional or even abusive adult relationships.\n\nFor families trying to understand how to best support a child that has experienced sexual abuse in a school environment, it\u2019s important to note that children who are disbelieved, blamed, or ostracized experience a greater sense of betrayal than those who are supported, believed, and shown understanding.\n\nPreventing Educator Childhood Sexual Abuse\n\nEducation and information is the key to stopping sexual abuse in a school setting. Pedophiles engage in a predictable behavior which starts with a grooming process and ends with the molestation of a child. Knowing what to look for and what to do when you see such behavior is the key to stopping sexual abuse before it occurs.
