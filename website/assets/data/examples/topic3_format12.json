Our goal is to provide you with intelligent, effective legal representation that resolves your issues quickly so you can move on with your life. North Carolina law can be difficult, but Bata Law Office, P.A. can assist businesses and individual clients in navigating through the complexities.\n\nGetting results for clients for more than three decades\nThrough meticulous attention to detail and in-depth knowledge of North Carolina law, attorney Rudolph A. Bata, Jr. has earned a reputation as one of the most capable legal minds in the region. He goes over every detail, no matter how small, with you so you get a clear understanding of every aspect of your case. We believe that when both the client and the attorney are on the same page, the results are far more likely to be positive. At the Bata Law Office, P.A., you will find:\n\nA renowned attorney Attorney Bata has received many accolades over the years, included the respected BV Distinguished Peer Review Rated by Martindale-Hubbell, awarded in recognition of his professionalism and ethics and the care he offers his clients.\nAn attorney who puts his clients first At the Bata Law Office, P.A., we want to build a foundation of trust with everyone who comes to us for assistance. Solid communication between us improves your chances for a favorable outcome in your case.\nA dedication to the people of North Carolina Attorney Bata has been helping the people of North Carolina for decades. He is an active participant in community activities and cares deeply that all of his clients from the area get the justice they deserve.\n\nAreas of practice\nAt Bata Law Office, P.A., we serve clients in the following areas of the law:\n-Business Law\n-Estate, Will and Trusts\n-Real Estate\nMain Office\nMain Office\n225 Valley River Avenue, Suite B\nMurphy\u00a0 NC\u00a0 28906\n  \u2022 828-837-8684\nEstate Planning\nExperienced North Carolina trust and estates attorneys can draft your last will and testament\nA will is essential at every stage of your life, providing you with the opportunity to distribute your property, establish care for your children and otherwise express your wishes for what will happen upon your death. A will is necessary if you intend to leave property to someone who is not your blood relative, e.g., a domestic partner, a friend or a charity. If you die without a will, the court determines how your property is distributed, who cares for your children and even what happens to your beloved pet and the decisions the court makes might not reflect your desires.\n\nAt Bata Law Office, P.A., we have more than 30 years of experience drafting wills for clients and can assist by drafting a valid will to ensure your intentions are honored.\n\nChanging your will\nAs your life evolves, so may your estate plan. You may need to update your will throughout your life. We draft valid codicils that address changes in your financial situation, marital status, parenthood status, philanthropic interests and general lifestyle decisions.\n\nAppointing a guardian\nYour will allows you to make decisions about the future care of your minor children. This is especially crucial if you are a single parent or in the event that both parents die in a common incident. If you have not named a guardian for your children, the court appoints one, who may make parental decisions contrary to what you would have wanted. In your will, you can also make arrangements for the care of your pets, naming a guardian to take responsibility for them.\n\nCreating an optimal estate plan\nDrafting an effective will requires more than filling in a form. If a court determines that your will is invalid, your desires will not be honored upon your death. We meticulously draft your will and consider all aspects of your estate plan. We review your family arrangements, financial situation and philosophical goals to guide you in making the best estate planning decisions, and we draft your will accordingly.\n\nValuing and managing the estate\nWe assist executors with the arduous process of collecting, managing, valuing, protecting and liquidating the assets of the estate. We have a team of experts available to assist in every aspect of estate probate. When appropriate, the firm calls upon accountants, financial advisors, real estate agents, property managers and other professionals to assist with executor duties. We can access expert opinions about unique assets such as antiques, rare books, automobiles and other collectables for accurate valuation, management and possible sale.\n\nRudolph A.

Often, this is because they believe they cannot afford an attorney, hope the problem will resolve itself or believe they can handle the matter by themselves. No matter what the reason, failing to contact an attorney soon after legal issues arise can have disastrous effects, because delays may prejudice your rights or cause the matter to increase in severity. Moreover, if you are contemplating suing someone, you need to be aware of deadlines imposed by law.\n\nEven if you are not faced with a lawsuit, legal advice may give you helpful information about your rights or responsibilities. An attorney can help you understand what you might be entitled to receive and how to secure what is yours.

We welcome and receive referrals from attorneys, the local courts, and, of course, past clients.\n\n\nThe legal process can be intimidating. Doing it yourself can be cost-effective, but it needs to be done procedurally correct.

When you contract with us, you can be assured that every hour billed by us is directly billable to your client at a profit. The advantage to using an independent paralegal service is that there is no need to factor in employee overhead costs that cut into the bottom line and frees up an attorney to take on additional clients and exponentially increase their billable hours.\n\n\nWe provide guidance and support for those going through the divorce process.
