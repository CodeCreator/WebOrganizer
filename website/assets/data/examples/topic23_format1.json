Hit the gym or spend time in the spa, swapping between the likes of saunas, Jacuzzis, Turkish baths and counter current pools. The best Spanish ski hotels are home to some awesome swimming pools, where panoramic windows let you paddle among the peaks (usually swimming hats and flip flops are essential). Add private or helicopter transfers to your booking for a truly special stay.\n\nSpain\u2019s ski hotel food & drink\n\nThe bigger hotels have their own bars and restaurants for guests to use, letting you enjoy good food and vino without having to stray far from your room. Buffet restaurants serve a huge selection of international cuisine, while a la carte restaurants menus mix regional and international dishes. Tapas bars are popular in these parts, and well worth experiencing whether you\u2019re after a drink and a snack or a delicious Spanish dinner. Sometimes food\u2019s included on a B&B basis, providing breakfast on-site then letting you choose where to spend dinnertimes.

This year\u2019s exhibition will take place at the new Achill Island Brewery in Bunnacurry. The exhibition will be open from 12 noon to 4pm and will be showing off the very best that Achill has to offer.\n\nAdmission is free to the public.\n\nScroll down for location map.\n\nLocal businesses, community groups and individuals who wish to become exhibitors should contact Achill Tourism on 098 20400 or email\n\nAchill Expo 2017\n\n\nAchill's New Beach - Dooagh Beach Born Again\n\nAchill Island has a new beach for 2017! For the first time since 1984, an extensive sandy beach has returned to Dooagh Bay. Just in time for the start of the summer season, the ocean has deposited thousands of tons of sand onto the formerly rocky \u2018beach\u2019. Now that the high Spring Tides have passed, it is expected that the new sandy beach will remain in place for summer 2017. The amazing reappearing beach has been reported worldwide, including the BBC, ITV and CNN. Scroll down for links to full stories, images and video.\n\nWhy beaches lose their sand \u2013 and then suddenly reappear \u2013 academic explanation for the magical reappearing beach in Dooagh.\n\nBelow: BBC News interviews Emmet Callaghan of Achill Tourism:\n\nAbout Dooagh\n\nIn 1987 the oarsman Don Allum completed the first westward crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, departing St. Johns, Newfoundland and landing in Dooagh Bay 77 days later.\n\nEnglish novelist Graham Greene shared a cottage hideaway in Dooagh with his mistress, the American Catherine Walston, in the 1940s. Greene wrote parts of the novels The Heart of the Matter and The Fallen Idol while in Dooagh.\n\nThe headland on the east side of Dooagh Bay, Gob Ellainne, is where the painter Paul Henry stood in 1910 and tore up his return train ticket to London, vowing to stay in Achill: \u201cAs I wandered round \u2026 and looked down on Dooagh and to the noble cliffs of Achill Head, I felt that here I must stay somehow or another. I would not go any further\u201d.\n\nAchill Island continues to inspire artists and writers. Painter Camille Souter lives and works in Dooagh, and the island has many Galleries and Craft Shops showcasing the work of artists, sculptors and photographers.\n\nDolphins and basking sharks are regular visitors to Dooagh Bay (see Whale, Dolphin & Shark Watching).\n\nScoil Acla, one of Ireland\u2019s oldest summer schools, was founded in Dooagh in 1910. Scoil Acla continues to provide tuition and performances in traditional Irish music, culture and arts. The summer 2017 programme runs from 22nd \u2013 29th July.\n\nIn 2014 heavy storms exposed a shingle bank at Dooagh Beach which was investigated by archaeologists from the nearby Achill Archaeological Field School and found to contain a pony graveyard dating to the mid-19th century. See Dooagh Pony Graveyard (2014). The Achill Field School is Ireland\u2019s longest-running archaeology field school and offers tours and introductory courses as well as accredited courses for undergraduate students.\n\nIn former times, the same spring storms that revealed the beach in 2017 and shingle bank in 2014, would regularly rip seaweed and wrack from the seabed and deposit it onto the beach. On such occasions, a bugle would be sounded to notify villagers and the wrack would be divided to be used as fertilizer in the surrounding fields. Today, seaweed from Achill\u2019s Atlantic waters is used at Achill Seaweed Baths and also as an ingredient in the new Achill beer from Achill Island Brewery. The bugle is now used to signal the start of currach races at the annual Dooagh Day festival.\n\nAchill Island already boasts five Blue Flag beaches plus one more at nearby Mulranny but it is hoped that the pristine sand at Dooagh may become the island\u2019s sixth Blue Flag beach.\n\nDooagh beach, May 2017\nDooagh\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 beach, May 2017 (above)\n\nDooagh beach before and after\nDooagh beach before and after (above)\n\nDooagh 'Beach', March 2017\nDooagh beach, March 2017 (above)\n\nBook Launch: My Father's Wake by Kevin Toolis\n\nBAFTA winning film maker, playwright, director and writer Kevin Toolis, whose father hails from Achill, launches his book \u2018My Father\u2019s Wake \u2013 How the Irish Teach Us to Live, Love and Die\u2019 in Ted\u2019s Bar, Cashel, at 7.30 on Wednesday 25th October 2017.\n\nKevin Toolis introduces the book:\n\nOn a remote Irish island, close to shore, at the bedside of a dying man, in the company of the mn\u00e1 caointe, with the sound of the rosary booming off the ceiling, I felt both the revelation and the burden of My Father\u2019s Wake descend on my shoulders. I saw a way of dealing with death that dwelt amongst us as far back as the fall of Troy, long before the blinding of our Western Death Machine. My task was to help with the remembering.\n\nIn my all death hunting, I have been often graced by the kindness, generosity and painful heart-exposed honesty of hundreds of other lives. I hope the words here offered will be a reward for the time vested in a passing stranger and my debt in some measure repaid. Now my work is done. My promise, to the best of my ability, fulfilled and the work of others begun \u2013 to judge these words and journeys amongst the living and the dead and act upon them if they so wish.\n\nMay you too find in death the same grace I found in my father\u2019s wake.\n\nKevin Toolis is the writer of My Father\u2019s Wake: How the Irish Teach us to Live, Love and Die.\n\nToolis is a BAFTA winning film maker, playwright, director and the founder of manyriversfilms.\n\nI have made a number of films on the terrorism in the Middle East that have been nominated for Emmys and won a BAFTA. For more info and to buy any of these films go to Or to watch clips from Kevin\u2019s films go to\n\nToolis is the author of a classic account of the Irish Troubles Rebel Hearts: Journeys Within the IRA\u2019s Soul, a study of the IRA.\n\nKeem Bay in World's Top 10 Beaches\n\nKeem Bay on Achill Island has been listed among 10 of the world\u2019s most breathtaking beaches, according to the Irish Independent. Taking its place alongside beaches the Seychelles, Tahiti, Big Sur California and other global locations, Keem is the only Irish beach listed in the paper\u2019s Travel Top 10. Travel writer P\u00f3l \u00d3 Conghaile says this of Keem: \u201cFramed by cliffs, undeveloped save for an old stone cottage and heaven for snorkelers and sea kayakers, it\u2019s a first impression that lasts a very long time.\u201d He recounts how on his most recent visit he was told by a lifeguard that a sea kayaker had just been paddling with a basking shark.\n\nFull article: 10 of the world\u2019s most breathtaking beaches.\n\nFisherman's cottage, Keem Bay, Achill Island\n\nRare White Lobster on Display in Achill\n\nWhite lobster at Achill Experience\n\nA very rare white lobster has gone on display in an Achill aquarium after being caught in local waters. The one-in-a-million lobster was caught recently by fisherman Charlie O\u2019Malley in pots close to Dooagh Bay. In 25 years of fishing, it is the first white lobster Charlie has seen. The ghost lobster has distinctive white colouring, instead of the usual blue, due to the absence of a chemical compound called astaxanthin. The young lobster \u2013 it is estimated to be three or four years old \u2013 was spared from the dinner table when Charlie delivered it to the Achill Experience, a visitor attraction that includes an aquarium. The as-yet-unnamed lobster is the main attraction at Achill Experience and has gained much media interest including a report on RTE television news.\n\nRTE Report \u2013 with video\n\nAchill Experience website\n\nAchill Experience facebook\n\nRTE1 Ryan Tubridy Show - Tuesday 30th May 2017\n\nAchill Island welcomed the RTE Radio 1 Ryan Tubridy Show to Keel on Tuesday 30th May 2017. Ryan and his team were touring Ireland\u2019s Wild Atlantic Way for the week. On the day before, he visited Dooagh\u2019s new beach and also went horse riding on Keel beach. The show came live from The Beehive in Keel and Ryan stayed overnight at Bervie guest accommodation, also in Keel. Among the local businesses interviewed on the show was Terence Dever of the Achill Experience and Francois Colossi of Pure Magic Achill.\n\nView photos and videos from Ryan\u2019s visit to Achill on the Ryan Tubridy Show facebook page.\n\nRyan Tubridy horse riding on Keel beach, Achill\nRyan Tubridy outside Bervie guest accommodation, Keel, Achill Island",
