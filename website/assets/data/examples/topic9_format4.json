There's no other way, aside from a long, slow process of flat nominal pricing (but real drops, inflation considered). Given that even the NAR's recent, pie-in-the-sky median home price showed a 4% YoY drop (and those guys don't net out improvements or other fake price raisers), I'd say Marko's going to be wrong by about 10-20%.\n\nWe shall see.\n\nReport this comment\n#12) On February 26, 2008 at 5:19 PM, clintspicks (89.80) wrote:\n\nI just canceled my card, then called back to see if they had charged\u00a0me any interest on my small balance (because I wasn't going to pay it).

The question should be, how do we collect the revenue from those that use the roads?\n\nFuel taxes and vehicle registration fees come to my mind. Registration fees are capped at $43, so they can\u2019t provide all of the revenue requirements but they could provide a sizable portion of our needs. A 10- cent fuel tax would contribute about $100,000 annually. Both of these methods are transparent and representative of road usage.\n\nA property tax levy will have winners and losers, with little hope for any correlation between road use and those that pay for them.\n\nDon Coats\n\nThe Dalles\n\n\nUse the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.\n\nSign in to comment",

        "text":"Monday, April 18, 2011\n\nBaxter Med Delivery To Wipe Out Prism Pharma -- And Thus, Carrie Cox's [Conflicted] Chair Is No More\n\nSo ends a short-lived, conflict riddled, three month stint as board chair -- for Carrie S. Cox (the ex-Schering-Plough EVP):\n\n. . . .Baxter International Inc. announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Prism Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company based in King of Prussia, PA. Prism Pharmaceuticals has developed and received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for multiple presentations of Nexterone\u00ae (amiodarone HCl), an antiarrhythmic agent. The Nexterone product portfolio, which does not contain polysorbate 80 or benzyl alcohol, includes the first and only ready-to-use premixed intravenous (IV) bag formulations as well as vials and a pre-filled syringe.\n\nThe terms of the agreement include a total consideration of up to $338 million, consisting of an upfront cash payment of $170 million at closing and up to $168 million in future sales-based milestone payments. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011, subject to customary closing conditions and expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. This transaction is not expected to have a material impact on Baxter's 2011 financial results. . . .\n\nSo long, Ms. Cox. Under Baxter's aegis, this IV med product will be a huge seller -- the strength of Baxter's network with care facilities will be the key. All in all, a great result for the manifold venture investors in Prism.\n\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nCondor - Are you so driven by your venom toward S-P that you really think this is an appropriate headline?!\nAfter less than a year as CEO of Prism, Carrie Cox will walk away with a windfall...and a great return for Prism's investors. Losing her \"chair\" is hardly a problem!\nLet's see a little more honest reporting from this site...\n\n\ncondor said...\n\nGee, Anonymous -- I do appreciate your input, even if the point of it seems. . . unclear.\n\nTo recap, here:\n\nI was pointing out that -- under applicable Sherman and Clayton Act rules, she ought to have been more than a little concerned about sitting on the boards of one or more competitors, in the human health sector. I was noting that she seems oblivious to such nuances.\n\nThat was January 2011. I note now that she has seen the company taken out by Baxter. That solves her conflict. It is also the shape of many such deals to come, as Reform rolls out, in earnest, in 2011 -2014. The small will get rolled up into the large. That is a fact.\n\nBut don't kid yourself, Anon. -- the skills of one Ms. Carrie S. Cox (whatever those might be!) had almost nothing to do with Baxter's buy-out deal.\n\nShe -- as ever -- was just on the Ferris Wheel (up top) at the right moment -- that's all.\n\nDo stop back -- I highly suspect you are the one who also thinks me a racist. And, I do find that perspective fascinating. BTW, I do think Merck is poised to report a strong Q1 2011.\n\n\ncondor said...\n\nAnd so, Anon. I just edited my headline -- to be more precise -- courtesy of your input.\n\n\ncondor said...\n\nUpon reflection, I actually thought my graphic (above) made my point painfully obvious -- but so be it.\n\nNamsate, Anon.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nI thought my point was clear, but I understand why you might have difficulty hearing it. To be more direct, I believe you owe Carrrie Cox a grudging acknowledgement that she has puled off one of the better biotech deals of the year to date. It's interesting that you wish to hold CEOs accountable for every activity that occurs on their watch, e.g. Fred Hassan, but you want to opine that Carrie Cox had almost nothing to do with a buyout deal of her company! I thought you might be capable of more intellectual integrity...\n\nBy the way, I have many concerns with your agenda and your biases, but racism is not one of them. That must be another 'anonymous' whom you have pissed off along the way....\n\nCondor said...\n\nGee Anon. --\n\nUnless you are Ms. Cox, you seem unduly easily pissed off. Feel free not to read my little rants, or comment on them, if they vex you so.\n\nIn any event, Baxter essentially fleeced Cox (if she even had anything to do with the deal).\n\nThe target has an FDA approved med, selling well -- and it fits perfectly in Baxter's much wider channels. Yet about HALF of the buyout is CONTINGENT. Contingent on the target meeting \"milestones\".\n\nIf she was involved, my opinion is that she didn't help her own shareholders get the best possible deal -\/ she just saw a payday, after three months on the job.\n\nSo I guess we will agree to disagree.",

Taxes are a huge reason why i buy anything off the internet, if not THE reason.\n  5. Uhm... Califirnia is not alone in \"use tax\" laws. 45 other states share the view that sales tax due, if not collected by the retailer, must be remitted directly by the consumer. Laws on the books for more than 50 years in most states.\n\n    Hopefully Congress will finally get involved and fix this imbalance -that local retailers must collect, while remote retailers can ignore the sales tax collection issue because 45 years ago the Supreme Court thought it would be too difficult - clearly it is not today.\n  6. Tygerstrike\n\n    Tygerstrike TS Enthusiast Posts: 827 \u00a0 +93\n\n    Well in one aspect, this might help our economic growth. It will no longer make internet purchases so cheap and might help the brick and mortar stores in your very own town\/city. I can understand looking for a cheaper price, but in doing so business is taken from the city in which you live, it may even be taking business from YOUR job. And when business can't make money they fire ppl.\n  7. Article is wrong, Amazon starts collecting sales tax in Texas on July 1, 2012. That's according to the 10-Q Amazon filed with the SEC on April 27th. From the 10-Q -\n\n    \"\u201cWhile we continue to believe the assessment was without merit, in April 2012, we entered into a settlement with the State of Texas that included an agreement to collect sales taxes on applicable sales transactions for our U.S.-focused internet retailers beginning July 1, 2012, resolution of Texas sales taxes up to that date, certain commitments related to capital investment and job creation in the state, and an immaterial payment to the state,\u201d\n  8. Rick\n\n    Rick TechSpot Staff Topic Starter Posts: 6,324 \u00a0 +56\n\n    That is a significant mistake... Thanks for letting us know.\n  9. Um... read the title. It clearly states that taxes in Texas WILL be in July. :oops:\n\nSimilar Topics\n\nAdd New Comment\n\nTechSpot Members\nLogin or sign up for free,\nit takes about 30 seconds.\nYou may also...\n\nGet complete access to the TechSpot community.

Generally, the cash distributions do just that, but if you've recovered all of your basis, any additional cash distribution is taxable gain when received. The bigger problem is that you've ignored the part where you have to report and pay tax on all of the various items reported on the K-1 you receive each year - and use them to adjust your basis as well.\n\nCopyright 1996-2017 trademark and the \"Fool\" logo is a trademark of The Motley Fool, Inc.

I find some of the ideas about market fundamentals very informative, but try as I might, I cant find any that could possibly drive this market higher.

Carmell226\n\n    Carmell226 Mouseketeer\n\n    Aug 1, 2008\n    If you do, please tell me if you think it works. We are looking into it and I am just curious what others have to say.\n  2. bored\n\n    bored Mouseketeer\n\n    Apr 7, 2010\n    Yep used it. Now owe nothing but mortgage, two paid for cars, no credit cards, 6 months reserve in savings. It's nothing but common sense he teaches, but sometimes you need to just hear it a different way for it to get thru your head. Best thing that ever happened to my family.\n  3. DrMomof3\n\n    DrMomof3 DIS Veteran\n\n    Jan 9, 2010\n    We're in our 1st month of Dave Ramsey and we're big fans! I really think the Dave Ramsey plan is a life-saver. We're working together on our budget and enjoying the \"game\" of not spending $$$. It has brought us together and helped us see the light at the end of the tunnel!\n\n  4.

JumpinJ\n\n    JumpinJ Earning My Ears\n\n    Mar 24, 2010\n    I didn't follow the 'Dave Ramsey' method exactly... a little over a year ago when I was extremely stressed about the consumer debt I had racked up I discovered a website called Enemy of Debt. HE was following the total money makeover. I did some reading about zero based budgets, downloaded his awesome budget spreadsheet and took it from there.\n\n    I followed my own 'modified' version of it, which worked for me. Paid off all my debts (except my car which I am making extra payments on now) in about 7 months.\n\n    It was tough, required much self sacrifice and self control, but definitely worth it. The most important thing is the motivation!\n\n  6. sumertime\n\n    sumertime Mouseketeer\n\n    Aug 2, 2007\n    We also did a modified version. We didn't do the envelope\/cash system, but we did the debt snowball and paid off a student loan and 2 cars in 6 months. Our only debt is our house, and we refied to a 15 year loan so it will be paid off before my first goes to college. We also have a large chunk in savings and maxed out a ROTH IRA this year. I only wish that we had started it earlier.\n  7. castleview\n\n    castleview I'm on my 103rd attempt to grown\n\n    Mar 4, 2004\n    Modified Dave user here also. Yes, he's great for getting out of debt. As far as stocks advice, I'm not sure.\n  8. disneylove69\n\n    disneylove69 DIS Veteran\n\n    Oct 21, 2008\n    Debt free but mortgage as of last month and more then 6 months of expenses saved. Now in the investment period. It definatley works if you work it. All common sense. If you have debt you can't afford to buy anything. CASH IS KING. No credit.\n  9. StacyMarie\n\n    StacyMarie DIS Veteran\n\n    Feb 25, 2009\n    Faithful follower! No debt. Cash is the only way!\n  10. Vaughn4380\n\n    Vaughn4380 Mouseketeer\n\n    Aug 13, 2009\n    I don't use his methods (mainly because I don't keep a balance on my credit cards and only have vehicle and home loans), but I have friends who have used his method and speak highly of it.\n  11. sydneysmom\n\n    sydneysmom needing a vacation....soon!\n\n    Sep 16, 2009\n    :cloud9:We've been on it for over 3 years now. It's truly the best thing that we've ever done. When my DH and I were dating, he was already doing it and introduced me to the system. ( I had a car payment, cc debt...it wasn't good). But then I went on a budget, did the envelopes, etc. It took all the pressure of bills off.\n\n    We continued it when we got married. We refinanced the house to a 15yr mortgage and we're working hard at paying that off. Honestly, I wouldn't live without our budget or the envelopes again. :goodvibes it's a RELIEF not to panic everytime the mail comes and there's a bill in there. I used to be scared to balance my checkbook, open a bill.....not anymore. we don't fight about money at all. The only thing we might have a \"disagreement\" over is how much we're putting into savings this particular week. That's not too bad of a disagreement !!\n\n    Once you get going, it's actually kind of fun. Because you'll see your savings grow. We just did a HUGE bathroom remodel on both bathrooms and paid cash for everything. While some people might take out a home equity loan or put it on their CC....we're done and it's paid for. :cloud9:\n\n    I would totally recommend using it. It's a very liberating way to handle your finances and brings such a sense of peace. I can't talk highly enough about Dave Ramsey. :hug: Good luck !!\n  12. smkiya\n\n    smkiya <font color=deeppink>Sorta new. ;) Still gets a ta\n\n    Mar 6, 2009\n    I've been following his advice since January and I wish I'd known of him sooner (I'd be debt free by now). I don't do envelopes either, but I have been using a budget spreadsheet, knocked down monthly expenses, and have been throwing snowballs left and right. I've been selling stuff and working OT to help do it. I will be taking a vacation this August (which isn't recommended), but have modified it to be super cheap, and will work beaucoup OT for a couple weeks specifically for this trip and will only use the money over my normal pay for that paycheck to pay for it. We were originally scheduled for a Disney Cruise with a couple days at the parks. I cancelled that and now we're doing Hilton Head Island, SC at Disney's resort. Sooo much cheaper, especially with the discount I got! I haven't used a credit card in over 5 months and will never use one again! We will be debt free except for the house in 12 months! It feels great having a plan!\n  13. Jennifer823\n\n    Jennifer823 DIS Veteran\n\n    May 15, 2007\n    I've been using a website called whatsthecost.com, it's a website that you plug in your numbers and it will give you a plan on how to \"snowball\" your debt. Went there this morning to plug in my monthly progress and the site wasn't there! :confused3 Any better ones out there? Does Dave Ramsey have a spreadsheet program?\n\n    I've got to say, the snowball program is great though. You can see your progress on your debt and it really gives you hope!\n  14. PatsMom\n\n    PatsMom <font color=blue>Sometimes has Dory moments!<br><f\n\n    Feb 17, 2000\n    I am not a Dave Ramsey fan but his system seems to work for a lot of people. I disagree significantly with some of his advice like attacking the smallest debt first - I believe you need to attack the highest interest rate debt even if it is larger. But getting debt free is sound advice no matter how you achieve it.\n  15. ICF\n\n    ICF DIS Veteran\n\n    Jan 2, 2004\n    yep I'd agree with that.\n\n    He's also wrong on credit cards being evil......\n  16. AmongMadPeople\n\n    AmongMadPeople We're all mad here...\n\n    Feb 24, 2010\n    I have to agree with you to some degree. When we started paying down debt less than a year ago, we had 3 high balance debts, one small car loan, and a student loan in forbearance. I think the snowball method only works if you have lots of debt scattered across many sources - then I can see the benefit. But it made no sense for us to work on paying off my car when we were racking up 20% interest on CC debt.\n  17. mrudman\n\n    mrudman DIS Veteran\n\n    Jan 3, 2008\n    I do sort of a modified version of it... but so wish I had started it years and years ago! It's actually kind of fun once you start.\n\n    We do the envelope system, started it in October, and that alone has taken so much pressure off the way we see our finances.\n\n    We have 6 monthly bills, and 4 of those we don't keep envelopes for (electricity, water, phone, tv)... they just get paid as they come in.. I know exactly when they arrive, and I just make sure to leave that money in the bank.\n\n    The 5th monthly one is our house loan, so most of one paycheck per month gets transferred to the bank that we have our house loan at...we both get paid every other week, so we usually use one of the paychecks that falls closest to the due date of the house loan.\n\n    The 6th monthly one is our Visa..that's one area where we differ in Dave Ramsey... we bought a camper using the Visa... but got a decent APR on it, and should be paid off by the end of the year.... have paid off about 6k in 8 months and have 7k to go.\n\n    We also do not use cash for car gas.. we leave enough in the bank to cover that, so that we can both just pay at the pump.\n\n    Every payday I go to the bank, withdraw all the excess money (money not mentioned above), and divy it up into all our envelopes. We keep envelopes for all bills that are bi-montly\/every 3-month\/yearly\/and incidentals. Our list includes car insurance, house insurance, sewer bill, trash, license plates, my nursing insurance, kid's activities (bowling, gymnastics, piano, psr), memberships (zoo, AAA, girl scouts, weekly newspaper), school pictures, and also do envelopes to cover co-pays (for prescriptions, doctor appts, dentist appts), car repairs, house repairs\/improvements, and entertainment.\n\n    At this point we're also keeping an envelope that we're using as a savings.. we're going to Alaska in 2 months, so have been saving up for that since we started this system...this is another thing Dave Ramsey would say never to do... we could've probably had the visa almost paid off with the money we have put toward the cruise, but I disagree that you should not be taking vacations unless you have no debt. My daughters are at the age where I want them to experience things, and if it takes me 1 year longer to pay off our visa so that we can build memories like this, so be it, :).\n\n    Like I said above though, i really wish I had thought to use this system years ago.. we could've been in so much better shape financially.. but I guess better late than never, :).\n  18.

The only brand that fitted the \"inspires loyalty\nbeyond reason\" test for me is Marmite. Does it fit the other attributes of\nLovemark?... \"owned by the people who love them?\" - let them try changing\nit and see what happens!, would I protest if it was no longer there? -\nabsolutely, is it infused with mystery? - mmm not really, sensuality? -\nMarmite! I don't think so... intimacy? - be serious!. Therefore, on an\nunrepresentative sample of one (similar bases to the \"nomination\" of\nLovemarks) Lovemarks doesn't seem to add a great deal to the understanding\nof building great brands.\n\nThe ultra slick Lovemarks website pretty much sums it up for me, very\nflashy wrapper, very little product substance.\n\nDavid Taylor (from Where'sTheSausage)\n\nRob, Hi, thanks for popping in.

        "text":"Comments on: Revisiting the equity premium A slice of lime in the soda Mon, 21 Jul 2014 23:33:47 +0000 hourly 1 By: johnhhaskell Sat, 22 May 2010 14:12:49 +0000 If you assume that companies would not be profitable for decades, would you then buy equities at a lower expected return to treasuries? Of course not.\n\nSchrager also seems to confuse ex-ante and ex-post in her attempt at an article and to have a definition of \u201cequity premium\u201d that changes while she\u2019s writing. No wonder her conclusion is so weak.\n\nBy: dirt2624 Fri, 21 May 2010 15:55:23 +0000 WOW \u2013 from all of the research I have done, the equity risk premium varies with 10 year B and B- corporate bonds premiums compared to 10 year US treasuries for the US market. Please run the numbers and think hard on the subject as to why this seems true. (could it be that they are about as risky \u2013 hmmm)\n\nOf course this describes the major index relationship and individual companies will vary depending on their characteristics. Large companies with great balance sheets will have a lower premium as will high growth companies until their growth rates falter.\n\nI get such a big chuckle out of the \u201cFed Model\u201d and the idiots that promote it. It is best used to measure over-valuation rather than under valuation. Stick to the 10 year B and B- corportes, making suitable adjustments for individual companies, and over the long run you will gain an understanding of valuations.\n\nBy: tcolemanuf Fri, 21 May 2010 00:07:35 +0000 Equity premium, sounds like hocus pocus to me. Schrager is almost correct\u2026\n\nEquities are inherently riskier than Treasuries. Equity prices must ultimately reflect and compensate investors for that risk or no one would hold them in their portfolio.\n\nThe reason you hold them in your portfolio is the earnings. Thus, the earnings should be higher than that of comparable investments. Using Shiller\u2019s data set you can see from 1887 to 1960 the earnings yield averaged 4.53% spread over long term interest rates. Since then it has averaged -0.28%. Why did this happen; when did it become OK to accept a riskier asset class but with less of a stream of income? When it became a ponzi-esque game of the greater fool.\n\nBy: RyanT Thu, 20 May 2010 23:04:27 +0000 I feel that the equity premium is mostly a repercussion of the great depression. To a large extent, an entire generation that was too scared to invest set the stage for a major rebound which we call the equity premium.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems easy to say that in 2006-2008 these gains were finally sucked dry and the equity premium was at an end. Now, however, I believe this second \u201cgreat recession\u201d has set the stage for a new equity premium. The longer the market stagnates and the most fearful the public becomes, the more gains are bottled up for future investors who are willing to jump in.\n\nI am personally tossing small chunks of cash into stink bid day-orders on blue chip stocks with high yields. This way I control my exposure to short term movements (and recent volatility means I can get discounts of 3-5%) and am paid 4-7% while I wait. These dividends continue to build my cash position.\n\nI also hold a significant amount of fixed-income which I may back off in months or years.\n\nBy: cjkubx Thu, 20 May 2010 22:34:12 +0000 You can see historical equity premiums for 17 countries over 100 years as published by Professor Elroy Dimson. \u00a0\/documents\/Jacf1.pdf\n\nThe world averaged Geometric Mean equity premium of 4.6% and Arithmetic Mean equity premium of 5.9%\n\nIf it is believed there will be no equity premium then the value of equities should fall, increasing the earnings yield and increasing the equity premium. Though it is not guaranteed for any given year or decade it should over time persist. This has persisted for centuries.\n\nInteresting point, growth is not necessary for high equity returns; in fact, I prefer low or no growth. Please read Jeremy Siegel\u2019s Stocks for the Long Run.\n\nBy: wcw Thu, 20 May 2010 22:23:36 +0000 Back when the market was truly stupid in the late \u201990s, TIPS yielded 4%, indicating the market had priced in a new era where productivity was going to soar and real returns were going to be well over 4%. That was pretty crazy. By contrast, expecting private enterprise in a propertarian system designed and run by capitalists to deliver real returns below TIPS is almost equally crazy.\n\nCurrent long-dated TIPS will deliver real returns a bit under 2%. As a result, if you believe equities are vaguely rationally priced, you should mark their expected real returns at greater than 2%. DeLong says 4%? That may be overoptimistic, but it\u2019s in the discussion. Get 1% population growth, 0.5% immigration, excellent 2.5% productivity growth and no significant diminution in profit share, and you\u2019re getting close. I\u2019d be more comfortable with lower productivity growth myself, but I doubt we register a long-run 0%.\n\nOne aside: you\u2019re confusing premiums over cash and over bonds. I like to use \u2018real return\u2019 instead of the former (since cash returns roughly equal inflation), reserving the phrase \u2018equity premium\u2019 for the expected long-term return premium over long treasuries.\n\nBy: maynardGkeynes Thu, 20 May 2010 21:47:03 +0000 Brad says 4 per cent.\n\nThe U.S. Equity Return Premium:\nPast, Present and Future\nJ. Bradford DeLong\nProfessor of Economics, U.C. Berkeley\nResearch Associate, NBER\nKonstantin Magin\nVisiting Assistant Professor, U.C. Berkeley\n\nFor more than a century, diversified long-horizon investments in\nAmerica\u2019s stock market have consistently received much higher returns\nthan investors in bonds: a return gap averaging six percent per year.\nThis is what Rajnish Mehra and Edward Prescott (1985) labeled the\n\u201cequity premium puzzle\u201d: the premium return on equities does not\nseem to be matched by any obvious factor that makes the marginal\nutility of wealth in states of the world when equities are cheap\nsufficiently higher than in states of the world when equities are\nvaluable. The existence of this equity return premium has been known\nfor generations. More than eighty years ago financial analyst Edgar L.\nSmith (1924) publicized the fact that long-horizon investors in\ndiversified equities got a very good deal relative to investors in debt:\nconsistently higher long-run average returns with no more risk. We\nconclude that the equity premium puzzle has not been solved: it\nremains a puzzle. And we conclude that we anticipate the equity return\npremium to continue, albeit at a smaller level than in the past\u2014perhaps\nfour percent per year.\n\nBy: winstongator Thu, 20 May 2010 20:57:20 +0000 Assuming a positive equity premium is sort of like saying that equities are always a can\u2019t miss investment. Isn\u2019t the first rule of economics that there is no free lunch? Sometimes stocks are priced such that they are a good bet going forward, and sometimes not? Wouldn\u2019t that have to translate into a variable equity premium, with that variation including trips into negative territory?\n\nBy: winstongator Thu, 20 May 2010 20:53:46 +0000 This quote seems self-contradictory, \u201cEquities are inherently riskier than Treasuries. Equity prices must ultimately reflect and compensate investors for that risk or no one would hold them in their portfolio.\u201d [Schrager] The risk is partly observed in the volatility \u2013 varying prices. With the price varying, is the risk compensated properly all the time? Is the risk really moving, or is the rate at which the risk was compensated for going from under to over or somewhere between?\n\nSub-prime loans are inherently riskier than prime loans, however some sub-prime MBS\u2019s were not yielding that much more than prime MBS\u2019s (AAA rated tranches at least). You might even have a sub-prime loan with a teaser rate charging less of a premium than a really solid prime loan.\n\nOption-ARMs further that point. An option-arm 100% financing no-doc loan is inherently riskier than a fixed rate prime loan fully-doc\u2019d. Which yielded a better rate for the initial period? The extra risk was negatively compensated!\n\nBy: AGreenInvestor Thu, 20 May 2010 20:24:15 +0000 I think that the risk free asset which is the US Treasury might have to undergo a definition change soon if the 100% sovereign debt and high fiscal deficits situation comes to a Greek Pass",
