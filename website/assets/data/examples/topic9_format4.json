I guess alot of people were joining the VIP membership, so he increased it.\n\n    Just to clarify, the front-end product is $77, but the upsell is if you want more in depth coaching, which WAS the 2 payments of $197, but has now been increased to 3 payments of $197.\n  \u2022 Profile picture of the author seanybyrne\n    Interesting all right...\n\n    How do you get traffic to your number?

I almost did. I have bought so many WSO offers and I finally realized what was happening to me. The way they advertise them is genious. They get me all pumped and whipping out the credit card in minutes. But the truth is no of these WSO has ever contributed to my bottom line.\n\n    Look, some of these WSO offers are good. There is one now for auto blog commenting for $15, that would be a good benefit to some people. Its also has to do what you do with them after you buy them. Unfortunetly they always advertise them as \"next big thing\" and it turns out to be a let down in the end. (for me that is). And I almost bought the Auto Blog Software! LOL. The marketing is just soooo effective. But resist the temptation and take a day to think and research the product. It will save you time and money\n\n    I beleive that the Mobile Money Bandit will give you a list of Pay Per Call campaigns that you can find for Free (look at Ringrevenue, then sign up for the companies using Ringrevenue) I also believe that MMB will tell you how to tap into Mobile PPC. Just go to Google Mobile Ads or Microsoft Ad Center. And then they will rehas the same old Google Places, website building and link building info that is readily available to all of us for free on the web (and warriorforum is a great resource)\n\n    Correct me if Im wrong about MMB, but what are they really going to show us? Why would they risk their current success by selling the system to rest of the world. So do the math. they claim to make 145K per month using this system. The system cost $77. So if they are making abot 3K per day, they would need to sell 40 WSO a day to match that effort and warrent this HUGE risk. 40 a day is 14,600 sales a year. It just doesnt make sense why they would sell their system for so cheap if they are making so much money. How in the world could they maintain a 40 sales per day number? And how long could this program be relavent?\n\n    The only answer could be the following:\n    1. They are NOT really making 145K a month from this system\n    2. The system is untested and unproven, but in theory would work\n    3. Is a waste of time and money\n\n    If you interested in Pay Per Call it is nothing different the Pay Per Click. All the same rules apply. You have to build good sites and get good traffic. If your looking for Pay Per Call clients just do a quick Google search.\n\n    Hope this helps\n  \u2022 Profile picture of the author perswealth\n\n    I get what you're saying, but given that you haven't purchased the product, then you really have no business commenting on this thread, as it is for people that have actually bought the product and used it and have a USEFUL opinion.\n\n    Look, we've all been suckered into buying worthless stuff that didn't do anything for our bottom line, I'm with you on that. It's an experience i'm sure everyone on this forum has had. If you haven't, consider yourself in the minority, and you probably haven't been around the block that long.\n\n    And are there bad people out there selling junk to separate you from your money, unfortunately, yes. That's the world we live in. It is what it is.\n\n    BUT, to say that EVERYONE is peddling junk without even trying the product is not only doing a disservice to the people that are interested in buying the product, but also to the product owner that created the product.\n\n    You say that you have generated several million dollars online? Congratulations. Personally, I applaud you. I assume it wasn't easy. I do OK online (not millions), and it has been VERY hard, and VERY frustrating, but worth it.\n\n    So i'll also make an assumption that you are a product owner in some form or another.

        "text":"\nApple Whenever we're talking market share and Macs, it'll inevitably get late. There are different means of measuring market share, and different ways to interpret the resulting data, usually leading to heated debates about who is right and who isn't. Ars decided to take a look at the different methods of measurement and see what they mean.\nPermalink for comment 350567\nTo read all comments associated with this story, please click here.\nLies, damned lies, and statistics\nby elsewhere on Wed 25th Feb 2009 05:56 UTC\nMember since:\n\nBrowser statistics are interesting, but irrelevant, unless they're coming from a company like Google, which is one of the only web entities I would consider to be large enough in global userbase to overcome cultural, lingual, market and regional biases in terms of relevancy. Not perfect, but much better. But since Google et al. don't release browser stats, which is actually a shame, everything else represents a biased-sample.\n\nMarket share is an ambiguous concept. Most references to market share refer to % of dollars sold. 90% of the global organizations could be running Debian on all of their servers, but Microsoft would still dominate market share because that remaining 10% is paying for their Windows licenses.\n\nMore relevantly, Apple's average retail price is more than double their closest competitors, so Apple can sell half as many systems as anyone else, while still maintaining market share.\n\nUnit share is more interesting, because it covers the number of units that a manufacturer actually sold, rather than the cumulative value of the units they sold.\n\nThis is where the numbers game comes into play.\n\nIn Jan 08, Apple laptops represented 15% of all laptops sold in the US, but that dropped to slightly over 13% for Jan 09. Yet, Apple sold more laptops in Jan 09 than Jan 08. More interesting, their market share in terms of retail dollars spent is almost exactly flat between Jan 08 and Jan 09.\n\nWhich metric do you want to go by? You can argue Apple's unit share is dropping, you can argue that Apple is increasing their unit shipments, or you can argue that their market share is flat. This is the game that marketing people like to play.\n\nI'm not an Apple fanboi by any means, but I have to say, in business terms, Apple is doing phenomenally well in the retail space. They're effectively maintaining their market position despite being more expensive than the competition (when looking at the average price of the overall units sold).\n\nThere's a couple of interesting factors that will come into play. First of all, netbook sales are becoming fairly significant in terms of units shipped, although they're a relative drop in the bucket in terms of dollars spent. Netbooks weren't even on the map for most of 2008, but starting around September, they made a noticeable impact in unit sales.\n\nThe increase in netbook sales, considering Apple doesn't sell one, does somewhat dilute the stats for the other top tier companies and that will impact the average sell price those manufacturers are seeing for their products. Does this impact Apple? Not directly, but in a stressed economic time, it does raise the question of whether existing customers will be spending money to purchase new Apple systems versus the convenience of a much cheaper netbook for portability.\n\nThen there is the fanboi factor. One thing Apple has done a remarkable job of is building a fanatically loyal userbase. On this aspect I don't have hard numbers to go by, but I'd suspect that Apple probably tops the other manufactuers in terms of customer willingness to remain with the brand. The fanboi factor comes into play with that segment of customers that will never choose an alternative platform. But the fanbois only represent a segment of the existing market, the question is how large? There are a number of \"casual\" customers that chose Apple over the last couple of years, versus the long-term Apple users, but again, the question is, how many?\n\nApple, regardless of how people try to do the mathematics comparing their products against competitors, is a premium brand. It commands a premium price, and Apple earns a premium margin. Good for them, they've clearly been doing something right.\n\nStill, given the current economic condition, there's a very valid question of how long Apple will be able to maintain their market with that premium pricing. As I pointed out above, Apple's average sell retail price for each laptop is more than double that of their closest competitors. Apple may be dropping slightly in terms of unit share, but they are still second in terms of dollar share. Will Apple be able to rely on existing customers being able to upgrade to newer systems? Will Apple be able to rely on agnostic customers they may have gained over the last few years being willing to pay a premium to upgrade? Will Apple lose out in the consumer choice between a newer Apple or a much cheaper but practical netbook?\n\nI'm not bothering to look at desktop sales, because that's a whole separate set of numbers that I'm too lazy to analyze, since they're pretty much plummeting overall for every manufacturer, including Apple.\n\nApple has been doing something remarkably right with their product marketing, and it has been working for them. Though I don't use a Mac, and can't envision myself doing so any time in the near future, my hat is still off to them for that. I do think that the next year will be a remarkable test of how loyal a customer base they have, and their true ability to recruit new customers. That's where the numbers will become interesting, and the spinning of them, even more so. I'm not willing to place bets one way or the other, at this point.\n\nJust my rambling 2c...\n\nReply Score: 2",

I have this on my cardinal list of rules for day trading, but somehow in the heat of the battle i still often forget this rule or kist fail to realize the stock is making new highs or lows.\n\n    Anyone have similar experience?\n  2. Same problem. For some reason after a good run up (or down) that top is just to hard not to take, even though I berate myself for the loss, and taking what is generally a countertrend trade; I find I continue to do so. Although I must say that I am learning to just take a few ticks and then bail.\n\n    Make 'em pretty, Chris\n  3. Great point silk. They are making those new highs for a reason.\n  4. I'm guilt of doing the same at times. It's so damn tempting :D\n\n  5. It's for the simple fact that it is easier to trade counter-trend than get in on a trend that already started without you...\n\n    TM Trader\n  6. Don't agree with you guys. 52 week high list can be wonderful to work with on the short side, but you have to be selective and screen the stocks with further parameters.\n\n    Example: Ericy is now on 52 week high, whereas their competitor NOK is at quite low levels and there is a good correlation between them. Also I consider NOK fundamentally superior to ERICY in every aspect. So I will do a pair trade and short into the strength of ERICY.\n\n    IMHO a lot of stocks at 52 week high are just ticking time bombs if you take overnight positions on the long side. Take a look at VISX.\n  7. about to get burn by SNDK this coming Friday morning.\n\n    SNDK gives true meaning to 52 wk high.\n  8. Hi LSU,\n\n    I don't really understand what you mean(due to my bad English). Please specify what your intention is.\n\n    Have played SNDK several times in the past, but haven't been looking at it for some time.\n  9. Silk,\n\n    Thats a bit surprising coming from you.\n\n    I look at 52wk hi\/lo everyday, not to fade but to go with the flow especially f the big boys NEED to buy\/sell.\n\n    In fact, I'm looking at one this morning. Can't give it away but it sounds like, \"pigs be snortin'\".\n\n    Happy Trading.\n\n  10. Now take a look at UTSI. This is what I mean by ticking time bomb.\n\n    If you now hang in there on the long side with an overnight position due to 52 week high, you are getting hammered like a piece of meat. :cool:\n    #10 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sep 9, 2003",

        "text":"Thursday, November 22, 2007\n\nHome equity loan\n\nA home equity loan (sometimes abbreviated HEL) is a type of loan in which the borrower uses the equity in their home as collateral. These loans are sometimes useful to help finance major home repairs, medical bills or college education. A home equity loan creates a lien against the borrower's house, and reduces actual home equity.\n\nHome equity loans are most commonly second position liens (second trust deed), although they can be held in first or, less commonly, third position. Most home equity loans require good to excellent credit history, and reasonable loan-to-value and combined loan-to-value ratios. Home equity loans come in two types, closed end and open end.\n\nBoth are usually referred to as second mortgages, because they are secured against the value of the property, just like a traditional mortgage. Home equity loans and lines of credit are usually, but not always, for a shorter term than first mortgages. In the United States, it is sometimes possible to deduct home equity loan interest on one's personal income taxes.\n\n\nAdrian said...\n\nHome loans have become a big headache to avail, this is my personal experience. In paper we might come across to so many promises making us secure them easily but the fact is something else. When we are looking to make the most of it some hindrances are bound to make things difficult for us. I was therefore wondering about the Grant applications if they can be of reliable help.\n\nanusuyaw3solutions said...\n\nI have read this post.

The US dollar, which measures the buck\u2019s relative value against its major peers, rises 0.22% to 98.49.\n\n    Meanwhile, renewed risk-on trades expected to be seen on the European stocks will further boost the risk currency \u2013 the USD, and hence, weigh further on the major.
