        "text":"Xenophobia Research Paper Sample: The Nature Of Xenophobia\n\nThere are many vices of the modern society that deserve attention and are regularly debated. Among them, there are racism, homophobia, sexism, anti-Semitism, chauvinism, etc. All of them are undoubtedly begotten by society itself and never exist out of their carrier. There is one term which may incorporate all above mentioned \u2013\u00a0Xenophobia.\n\nessay on xenophobia\n\nWhat Is Xenophobia\n\nXenophobia is hatred, intolerance or dislike of someone or something strange, unfamiliar. It is incomprehensible, inconceivable, and therefore dangerous and hostile attitude towards unknown. It can cause animosity in relation to the principle of national, religious or social division, etc. Occasionally one can refer to it as obsessive fear of other people, that is a phobia in the clinical sense.\n\nAccording to the term, all people in the world are more or less xenophobic. All of us are hostile to something unknown. Unknown has been mistreated and misunderstood for ages. People hate what they do not understand. On the individual level xenophobia can be a bias. On the level of collective consciousness it can turn out to be the second Nazism, genocide or even worse. The world has the association with the fight against intolerance. It has become intolerant to intolerance so much perversely that even more dramatic and huge hatred was already born.\n\n\nIt is a tragedy that xenophobia is applicable in politics and affect the minds of normal liberal people with the superstitions and numerous cliches, stereotypes and bias. Thus, Xenophobia is often equal with nationalism. However, there is a significant difference between these two concepts: the supporters of nationalist views do not necessarily have negative feelings towards other nations, ethnic groups or religions, but xenophobic people do have such. On the other hand, the xenophobic people can call their views \u201cnationalist\u201d to make them more attractive. In fact, it is obvious that they simply veil their xenophobia by means of familiar and widely accepted notions as if it justifies them.\n\nXenophobia research paper\n\n\nXenophobia in its concrete manifestations also can be similar to chauvinism. Very often fiction authors use the term to refer to the fear or hatred of the inhabitants of other planets. All that concerns collective unknown can fit in this notion. Growing like a snow ball, bias turns into the bias of bias and approving of particular stereotypes one uses to break something. The world is so perverted that former fighters for freedom are the prisoners of their own freedom. Those who rebelled against being like everybody now are the same because the world turned upside down.\n\nThere are numerous examples of its manifestations, it is obvious, however, the nature of phenomenon\u00a0is enigmatic. Sociologists, however, stick to the idea that a natural typical to human fear of the unknown is the basis of the xenophobia. The viewpoint that the current practice of intentional cultivation of xenophobia is a proven method of controlling a group of persons is quite reasonable speculation, indeed. The matter is that by all means society is striving to develop without even thinking of by which means. It is obvious that it is just time to make at lest one new step in human evolution and depart from the primitive propositions and think before the thought in your mind emerges what it may cause for the others. Intolerance to the so called cultivated tolerant may sometimes be more reasonable than vice versa. Think of it.\n\nxenopobia sample paper\nYou are welcome to our web if you need to write papers on controversial and original topics.

Factory based mass production replaced independent artisans, who now worked for business firms (Volti, 2009, p. 187). The workers became dependant on businesses to provide facilities to work in, tools to work with, and wages to take home, creating a society of employees (Volti, 2009, p. 187). Since work and income was now dependant on the factories, workers need to find homes in relative proximity, thus leading to higher density of individuals within the urban areas surrounding the manufacturing centers. With urbanization came a need for production and transportation of food to the growing cities. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, this food was generally produced locally on the surrounding farmlands with only the occasional delicacy imported from a foreign land. While factory work was hard and the hours long, people chose it over subsistence farming as it lead to a better standard of living for themselves and their offspring. Bertha Black remembers her family\u2019s move to a mill town: We all went to work, in the Amazon Cotton Mill and we all worked there all our lives. We were all anxious to go to work because, I don\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t like farming. It was so hot from sunup to sundown. No, that was not for me. Mill work was better. It had to be. Once we went to work in the mill after we moved here from the farm, we had more clothes and more kinds of food than we did when we was a farmin\u2019. And we had a better house. So yes, when we came to the mill life was easier (Rivoli, 2009, p. 110). Thus began urbanization which continues to this day, with 50% of the global population residing in urban centers (Satterthwaite, 2010, p. 1). This urbanization is directly coupled with wealth, where the \u201cmore urbanized a country, the higher the individual incomes (Satterthwaite, 2010, p. 1)\u201d. The United States, one of the top 20 global incomes per capita (World Bank, 2011, p. 1), supports this, as...\ntracking img",

        "text":"Democratic sovereignty\n\nBy \u201csovereignty\u201d we refer to the ultimate authority within a given polity. During the Middle Ages the sovereign was a person, typically the monarch. With the advent of the modern nation state, the sovereign became an impersonal agency: the nation. The nation can be an elusive entity. At first, it entails no definitive bond between the people that make it up. Secondly, it is interpreted as atemporal, which implies that whatever common bond may exist, it is not only between the generations in existence. By that we mean that a nation is not equivalent to the actual citizens or people of a given state, as it also encompasses all possible citizens or people of the state. There ostensibly is no finality to the nation.\n\nNotwithstanding some of the mysticism involved in defining the nation, international relations are very much dependent on this concept. No wonder they are inter-national. However, the contemporary international order does adopt a prosaic view of nationhood, stripping it of its early modern pretences on temporal transcendence. A nation qua sovereign can only be a nation state. This is a reflection of the actualised right of peoples to self-determination. Nation states transcend the life span of any given generation of their people only for as long as that is deemed necessary, and only by means of convention. A stateless nation may indeed be talked about as a nation, but it is never considered sovereign.\n\nSovereignty, or else self-determination realised as state-formation-state-institution, means that the state legitimised by its people, and recognised as such by the international community, can pursue its own policies without intervention from other states. This is a centuries-old conception of statehood that is often termed \u201cWestphalian\u201d in reference to the Peace Treaty of Westphalia (1648 C.E.). The Westphalian tenets of statehood imply the following:\n\n  \u2022 Territoriality: every state must have a clearly defined territory over which its sovereignty may be made manifest and be applicable;\n  \u2022 Continuity: every state continues to exist as a state even if its people may change or its legal order undergoes a period of crisis;\n  \u2022 Independence: the capacity for self-determination that, when applied globally, entails the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another state;\n  \u2022 Equality: every state is equal to any other state in its capacity as a state;\n  \u2022 Uniformity: the state is understood as the primary actor of diplomatic affairs in the international order and is treated as a single personality;\n  \u2022 Nationhood: the identification of the state with a given culturally-defined people.\n\nPerhaps a more precise concept for describing this type of sovereignty is \u201cnational sovereignty\u201d, which is in terms of statehood equivalent to \u201cnation state sovereignty\u201d. From a democratic perspective, there is nothing intrinsic to national sovereignty which guarantees the normative ends of the decentralised distribution of power. The \u201cnational will\u201d or the \u201cnational interest\u201d can be\u2014and has been\u2014evoked by all sorts of abusers of powers as a means of justifying their machinations. Various states in the international community are indeed recognised as sovereign nations even though they do not have strong, adequate, or any institutions in place to preserve the decentralisation of authority. As such, a normative theory of statehood cannot remain limited to the understanding of sovereignty as national sovereignty, unless it attaches to it its own significations to the point where it has nothing in common with the prevailing definition.\n\nWhile it may be useful and perhaps tactically prudent to interpret nationhood in a way that it incorporates democratic principles, it generally is preferable to coin new terms for the sake of avoiding confusion. If a certain notion can be both democracy and its opposite, then it does not really help us understand what a certain proposition\u2019s actual meaning may be. One shrewd enough can use such polysemy to their advantage or, conversely, one sloppy enough may inadvertently obfuscate some of the issues involved.\n\nWe sometimes come across the phrase \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d, while there is a certain alter-establishment tendency to interpret \u201cpopulism\u201d as a positive term that indicates the capacity of the people to be sovereign. These views are interesting and fecund, yet they are insufficient to a democracy.\n\nTheir first limitation is that they place a disproportional emphasis on the internal aspects of sovereign authority. This forces them to downplay the importance of the essence of the Westphalian state: non-interference from other states. A sovereign people without a strong state that has an equal standing in the global order, will always be exposed to external threats or to pressures that may undermine its conventions. Sovereignty of such a sort would be a sovereignty manqu\u00e9.\n\nThe second tension in this line of over-evaluating the populace, is that it cannot easily fit with the vertical dimension of political organisation, especially for more complex formations of state, such as a federal system. If it is only or primarily the people who are sovereign, then the legal-institutional order of the state will have to be very weak so as not to impede or limit the popular will. A near-obsolete framework of rules can eventually be the cause of disorder, either due to the inability of the system to place sufficient constitutional checks on the distribution and exercise of power, or because the popular sovereign will descend into an ochlocratic tyrant.\n\nDemocracy is a compound term made up of the words \u201cdemos\u201d and \u201ckratos\u201d. The former signifies the body of citizens, those who participate in the commons. The latter means state, understood as an interweaving web of laws, institutions, and convention-based intersubjective relations. As was considered in the previous chapter, democracy is not the \u201crule of the many\u201d. It is the instituted decentralisation of power.\n\nFor sovereignty to entail democracy, we need to adopt an eclectic and synthetic approach which will isolate and indeed combine the positive elements from the seemingly polar views of [nation] state sovereignty and popular sovereignty. We may rework these into a democratic sovereignty, which will stand for the virtuous cycle of legitimation and accountability between the demos and the kratos, the citizens and their state.\n\nThe feedback loop of democratic sovereignty can be understood in light of the following:\n\n  \u2022 Within a given political tradition (a civic nation), the body politic proceeds to delegate its authority to various groups of decision-makers. This typically occurs through periodic elections.\n  \u2022 In such a national tradition, the body of citizens does not act in a legal-institutional vacuum. There are rules in place which guarantee the horizontal and vertical decentralisation of power.\n  \u2022 The political representatives are bestowed with the authority to take decisions on behalf\u2014and in the interest\u2014of the demos. Among the decisions are the promulgation of laws, the distribution of scarce resources, the qualitative features of cultural experience, the conduct of environmental policy, and so on. These set precedents for future processes of legitimation.\n  \u2022 The judiciary operates in parallel as an arbiter of the applicability of the laws. Its jurisprudence has an impact on the polity, for it sets parameters within which certain policy initiatives may be realised.\n  \u2022 The judiciary does not decide arbitrarily. It accounts for the prevailing conditions, the legal order, and its jurisprudential traditions to deliver rulings that are in line with practical necessity and the state\u2019s primary law. A judiciary that would seek to become a tyrant on the rest of the state would be overruled by means of a constitutional reform, or the state would implode.\n  \u2022 A constitutional reform will, at some point involve the body of citizens, either directly via a referendum, or indirectly, via their representatives.\n  \u2022 The representatives cannot permanently deviate from their voters\u2019 concerns, for that may eventually impact their status as representatives.\n  \u2022 The citizens of a state are not defined independently of the state\u2019s legal-institutional framework. It is a certain set of legal provisions that may make one a citizen of the state.\n\nUnder the scope of democracy, state and citizens cannot be seen as separate. National sovereignty alone implies a distorted version of the common good. Popular sovereignty in its own capacity entails a very weak institutional framework that may expose the state to external threats or to internal self-destructive propensities for injustice. Whereas the combination of these two means that the culturally-historically defined demos will operate within a certain milieu of laws, institutions, and statehood to realise the res publica as practical morality that is indeed common to all and universally good.",

Historically, these approaches have focused on redistribution. At the same time, these approaches have all but ignored recognition. We argue that a more holistic approach that addresses both redistribution and recognition is necessary. Further, we attempt to show that our approach is consistent with the tenets of liberalism. By conceiving of Aboriginal politics as such, the state may be better able to address claims. We begin by providing a theoretical overview of redistribution and recognition, respectively. Then, we proceed to show how redistribution and recognition must work together in an adequate account of justice with respect to Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Finally, we offer a conception of Aboriginal politics that fulfills this desideratum, and integrates the principle of recognition and redistribution in a way that is within the bounds of liberalism.\n\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the helpful comments and support of Angela White, Charles Jones, discussants who provided feedback on an earlier draft at the annual meeting of the Canadian Political Science Association, and the helpful feedback of the anonymous reviewers.\n\nCreative Commons License\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 4.0 License\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 4.0 License.",

When Trump won the Republican race, they all thought it was positive news for them. Clinton\u2019s campaign team worshipped data so much that they forget the other crucial aspects of campaigning. Mook used analytics as a decider, rather than as a guiding tool (Allen and Parnes 206). The campaign team, and even Bill, thought that it was all too easy for them. They also depended on Obama\u2019s support to tip the scales to their favor; it was clear to them that Hillary Clinton would be the first woman President of the United States (Allen and Parnes 211).\n\nMook relied too much on the modern campaigning and neglected to pay attention to what Trump was doing on the ground. The team completely ignored any advice that warned them of the possibility of Trump winning the election and thought that they had everything figured out. According to them, Trump was unpopular among the minorities, particularly the Hispanics (Allen and Parnes 215). More importantly, he was not qualified to be a president. While they were counting on this inane facts, Trump\u2019s campaign team was using a very different approach towards winning the election. Instead of focusing on the competitive states, he concentrated on the Rust Belt States, which had many electoral votes (Allen and Parnes 216).\n\n\nIn this chapter, the authors posit that Clinton\u2019s campaign team was so convinced they would win the election that they ignored Trump\u2019s strategies of wooing the voters. While they were focusing their attention on the media and in advertisements, Trump was striking a chord with white middle-class voters in states holding a majority of the electoral votes. The analytics approach adopted by Mook was failing him, which was not apparent at the time because his belief of an inferior candidate as their opposition had blindsided him. They thought it was all too easy because Trump was unpopular. It turned out Clinton was more unpopular than Trump.\n\nHave study documents to share about Shattered - Inside Hillary Clintons Doomed Campaign? Upload them to earn free Studypool credits!",

The thesis investigates the role of local organisations of the unemployed in contentious activities. More specifically, it looks at the forms of collective action these local organisations are engaged in, and asks about which conditions lead to the disruptive activities considered crucial for poor people\u2019s actors. This is done by analysing different empirical sources: semi-structured interviews, participant observation, surveys, and expert interviews. In order to describe the forms of contentious engagement seen and the role of local organisations, the second part employs an analytical descriptive approach. In an attempt to explain the tactical choices of organisations of the unemployed I link four different conditions (access to resources, access to the field of institutionalised actors, belonging to a counter-cultural network and movement experience) to the use of disruptive activities. Combining all four conditions I then carry out a Comparative Qualitative Analysis (QCA). One important insight of the thesis is that contentious action by the poor can be stabilised over time. Further, the thesis also shows that the two fields of local organisations are characterised by different features. Some features, for example the existence of certain types of organisations - as defined by their preferred activities - can be explained by the political system and, more particularly, by the institutions of contention present in each country. However, there are also many similarities between the fields, showing that national opportunity structures explain only some aspects of contentious action. In looking at the conditions leading to the use of disruptive action, the thesis shows that political opportunities are just one of several other factors that explain types of contentious engagement. The thesis disconfirms the assumption of the central role of exclusion from centres of political and discursive power and the lack of resources in accounting for disruptive action. It is more important that organisations of the unemployed belong to a counter-cultural network, defined as a necessary, albeit not a sufficient condition for disruptive action. en\ndc.format.mimetype application\/pdf\ndc.language.iso en\ndc.relation.ispartofseries EUI PhD theses en\ndc.relation.ispartofseries Department of Political and Social Sciences en\ndc.rights info:eu-repo\/semantics\/openAccess\ndc.subject.lcsh Pressure groups -- European Union countries\ndc.subject.lcsh Political participation -- European Union countries\ndc.subject.lcsh Lobbying -- European Union countries\ndc.title The Welfare State we're in: Organisations of the unemployed in action in Paris and Berlin en\ndc.type Thesis en\ndc.identifier.doi 10.2870\/70296\neui.subscribe.skip true\n\nFiles in this item\n\nThis item appears in the following Collection(s)\n\nShow simple item record",

Ryn Transaction Press, 2003, from Intercollegiate Review, Fall\/Winter 2004\n\nMany Enlightenment ideologues hoped to see fulfilled in America all the dreams of the Age of Reason: an empire of unfettered minds, natural rights, unbounded human benevolence and progress, the first fruits of a world reborn. Impatient utopians soon despaired, however. Faced with ratification of a conservative Constitution rooted in the long Western tradition of classical and Christian civilization, they turned their imaginations to the promise of revolutionary France. Nevertheless, some Americans persisted in their secular millennial expectations for the United States. Foremost among these at the opening of the twenty-first century are those whom Claes Ryn calls \u201cnew Jacobins.\u201d In America the Virtuous, Ryn analyzes the defining elements of their worldview. In his own words, his \u201cstudy aims to identify, illustrate, and analyze a general ideological phenomenon, a powerful tendency of thought, imagination and action with its own distinctive logic and momentum.\u201d That tendency, in Ryn\u2019s estimation, is leading America toward profound disorder.\n\nNeo-Jacobinism, like its original embodiment more than two centuries ago in revolutionary France, displaces a concrete, localized, rooted, classical and Christian view of man and society with an abstract, universalized, restless, Enlightenment and Romantic view. To some degree, Ryn is carrying into the twenty-first century the ideological argument between Edmund Burke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Ryn stands with Burke, Irving Babbitt, Wilhelm Roepke, and Russell Kirk against Rousseau, John Locke, the French revolutionaries, and\u2014perhaps surprising to many conservatives\u2014Leo Strauss, and, particularly, Allan Bloom. While he does not hesitate to name names, Ryn\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose is not to classify particular individuals but to identify a particular intellectual-political dynamic with its own inner logic, to show how certain ideas belong together and form a coherent, if philosophically highly questionable, ideology.\u201d\n\nThe strength of Ryn\u2019s analysis is his identification of deep discontinuities in American history and experience: namely, transformations of leadership, ethical conduct, political philosophy, social and economic structures, language, historical consciousness, and national self-perception and ambitions. Ryn roots American civilization in the heritage of Greece and Rome, Western Christendom, and British culture. America emerged from a particular past, a concrete\u00a0 historical experience. America is indebted to that past for its culture, political institutions, and freedoms.\n\nNew Jacobins, however, viewing the past as a dark prison from which humanity must be liberated, construct an alternative America that fulfills Enlightenment dreams of emancipation, abstract natural rights, and unbridled democratism. Their interpretations of the American founding, canon of state documents, and cultural identity\u2014 while perhaps ideologically alluring\u2014are at odds with historical reality. While seeming to advocate \u201ctraditional values,\u201d they are actually revolutionaries who subvert the decentralist constitutional democracy of the founders. While seeming to defend the Western tradition from its enemies, New Jacobins advance a \u201csecular, ahistorical, and egalitarian\u201d appropriation of that tradition. Despite their rhetoric of piety toward tradition, they are the enemies of \u201cpre-Enlightenment Western civilization.\u201d Whereas America\u2019s \u201cold moral ethos\u201d acknowledged the binding authority of tradition and custom and the contingencies of particular circumstances, Neo-Jacobin consciousness is ahistorical, universalist, and driven towards greater and greater concentrations of power. In fact, Ryn argues, \u201cwhat the new Jacobins defend as Western civilization is actually but a small and relatively recent part of it, chiefly that part which came to political prominence with the French Revolution and that finds its other beginnings in the rationalism of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and its precursors.\u201d\n\nIf America is an \u201cidea,\u201d as the new Jacobins insist, then it is properly defined, now and always, by exceptionalism, universalism, democratism, restless innovation, and ideological imperialism. To the new Jacobin mind, the American story is one of unbroken, triumphalist continuity and robust good health. If, on the other hand, as Ryn contends, America over the past two centuries has actually abandoned its moorings and jettisoned the ballast of its classical and Christian heritage, then the American story is discontinuous and headed, perhaps, to an unhappy ending. Most alarmingly, America has abandoned its longstanding fear of power and pride; instead, \u201cthe signs are now everywhere that the will to dominate is breaking free of such traditional restraints.\u201d Ryn blames the new Jacobinism for transforming the more modest old republic into an aggressive, ideological, revolutionary state bent on empire and driven to remake the world in its own image.\n\nRyn\u2019s analysis is disturbing and provocative. It provides a framework within which to organize a range of slogans and policies into a coherent pattern of thought and conduct. From one angle, however, there is something inescapably authentic about the neo-Jacobin temptation. While recent enthusiasms for America as a messianic \u201cuniversal nation\u201d may represent a discontinuity from earlier American self-conceptions, there are also clearly continuities here, and these continuities need to be exposed and their implications understood. This is not a criticism of Ryn\u2019s painstaking analysis, but a doorway into further in\u2022quiry, perhaps of a more historical nature.\n\nWhat do we make of, and what do we do, with the messianic, meliorist, liberationist impulse that in one form or another, to one degree or another, has been with us for four hundred years? A type of redemptive universalism came to the New World with the Puritans and reappeared from time to time even among the most sober-minded of the founders. From \u201cGod\u2019s American Israel\u201d to Cr\u00e8vecoeur\u2019s \u201cnew man,\u201d from Yankee nation-building in the Civil War to Wilsonian social-gospel globalism in World War I, America has wrestled with this expansionist revolutionary tendency. There is something about Jacobinism that is persistently and in some sense genuinely American. At the dawn of the twenty-first century we are perhaps merely witnessing the further evolution of a contagion that we have carried in us from the beginning. Doctrines and impulses that we once consciously and deliberately suppressed are now allowed to run free. A more extended analysis of how and when these checks were removed in our history may provide a key to reinstating these checks institutionally, culturally, and personally.\n\nRyn has not written a book for the lazy, impatient, or haphazard reader. As hard as it may be for his likely opponents to accept, his analysis is refreshingly non-ideological. He ponders his subject with impressive care and attention, taking time to define terms, to trace the redefinition of familiar terms, to establish context and proper categories, to reaffirm hierarchies of obligation, to dichotomize between true and false notions of particular principles, and to distinguish between appearance and reality. Despite its provocative thesis and bold analysis, Ryn\u2019s is in fact a cautious book that patiently makes its case, limits its implications, guards the careful reader from misinterpretations, and points out wherever necessary what it is not saying. Anticipating misunderstanding, Ryn frames and fences his argument at every turn. A proper reading of this book requires the all-too-rare mental habits of attention, discrimination, and judgment.\n\nRyn offers more than diagnosis, however, and his book is infused by hope. This is not a work of despair and cynicism, nor is Ryn nostalgic for a world lost beyond recovery. Indeed, he sees little left for conservatism to conserve. Despite the dreams of mere traditionalists, \u201cthe old Western civilization cannot return. It has been too badly damaged.\u201d Instead, the task is one of reconstitution of the cultural preconditions of the well-ordered city. To that end, American civilization needs to re-appropriate the best of the Western tradition to meet new times and circumstances. Urgently, America requires \u201ca new moral realism,\u201d a foreign policy based on what Ryn calls \u201cresponsible nationhood,\u201d and a return to limits personally and nationally, including \u201cthe rediscovery of responsibilities that are near, immediate, and concrete.\u201d\n\nThe task, then, is not to win elections and capture positions of political power, but to renew the culture. The greatest responsibility rests with those who help shape the mind and imagination of the rising generations to offer them a coherent, compelling alternative. America requires the reaffirmation, by each of us, of the qualities of character necessary for authentic constitutional self-government\u2014modesty, discipline, demonstrated ability, and a due sense of limits and proportion.\n\nAmerica the Virtuou...

A critical look at the commercialization of Afghan demining. Working paper series, WP 01\/2008. Centre for the Study of Global Governance, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK.\n\nDownload (1222Kb) | Preview\n\n\nAfghanistan is considered the birthplace of humanitarian mine action -- the clearance of landmines and unexploded munitions from land intended for civilian use. The demining methods and protocols developed there in the early 1990s were exported to mine-affected countries all over the globe. However, Afghan demining is in a period of momentous change. After 16 years of UN-led and NGO-implemented mine action, the last few years have seen the influx of commercial demining companies. This has the potential to enhance the capacity of Afghan demining, through greater profit-driven efficiency, innovation and specialization. Moreover, it is unlikely that many NGOs would be able, or willing, to do mine and UXO clearance tasks for the Coalition and Afghan militaries. Thus some involvement of commercial companies in Afghan demining should be welcomed. However, there are also several possible disadvantages to commercialization. Firstly, without tight controls and a clear regulatory framework, using commercial companies risks lowering the quality and safety of the demining process. Secondly, turning demining into a purchasable commodity risks drawing demining resources away from those who need mine clearance the most, as those who can pay get demining first. Finally, commercialization, which has seen the growing role of private security contractors in demining, has occurred in tandem with the merging of US aid and security policy in Afghanistan. As a result, there is a danger that neutral \u2018humanitarian space\u2019 for demining may be reduced.\n\nItem Type: Monograph (Working Paper)\nOfficial URL:\nAdditional Information: \u00a9 2008 Matthew Bolton\nLibrary of Congress subject classification: J Political Science > JZ International relations\nD History General and Old World > DS Asia\nSets: Research centres and groups > LSE Global Governance\nIdentification Number: WP 01\/2008\nDate Deposited: 24 Mar 2009 16:16\n\nActions (login required)\n\nRecord administration - authorised staff only Record administration - authorised staff only\n\n\nDownloads per month over past year\n\nView more statistics",

ISSN 2663-371X.\n\nIn Regeneraci\u00f3n, the anarchists of the Mexican Liberal Party, from 1911 to 1918, called on the American and European proletariat to carry out a world revolution that would end capitalism and all forms of authority. Their intention was to make them aware that they would expropriate all the means of production, so they stayed in Los Angeles, California, where they had the conditions to edit Regeneraci\u00f3n and have multiple contacts with the acrat press in the United States and Europe. Based on the aforementioned publication, it is shown that they conceived their activity as part of the anarchist revolutionary struggle that had already begun in Mexico and sought the help of the workers of the world, both to arrive in our country and to expand expropriations in the world.\n\nThe anarchists of the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM) have been analyzed as part of the revolutionary process in Mexico. From that angle, a series of statements about his performance have been made, which have become a common space about his revolutionary intentions. However, their insistent call for world revolution is not addressed, forcing a more complex interpretation that does not adhere to the limited explanations that emerged in the post-revolution.\n\nPalabras llave : world revolution; anarchists; Partido Liberal Mexicano; Los \u00c1ngeles; border.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7 resumen en Espa\u00f1ol | Portugu\u00e9s \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7 texto en Espa\u00f1ol \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7 Espa\u00f1ol ( pdf )",

Using the case study of an online administrative approval system in Jiangmen, China, this study explores the political mechanism behind the adoption and implementation of local e-government projects. We propose a framework for analyzing the adoption and implementation of e-government projects that encompasses three aspects: environment (political institutions); process (perceptions of information technology, power relations, and strategic interaction); and performance. The political environment shapes people\u2019s perceptions of information technology and provides motivations and constraints for relevant stakeholders. Stakeholders choose different strategies and actions based on their positions in the power structure, which finally influences the performance of the project. In this study, due to local government leaders\u2019 motivation to seek political achievement and subordinate agencies\u2019 strategic responses in the Chinese political system, the online system finally turned into a symbolic tool that did very little to improve government performance.\n\nKeywords: e-government; performance; political institutions; power relations; technology symbolization\n\nView full article(PDF)\n\n\nTo link to this article: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/0020852320915637",

Advocates of inclusive liberalism argue that the participatory spaces created by the good governance agenda have increased the political space for NGOs focused on popular empowerment and policy influence. More radical critiques cast NGOs as apolitical brokers of neo-liberal development which distract from, or are disinterested in, more progressive development possibilities, including questions of redistribution. Drawing on a qualitative study of civil society organisations in Western Uganda, this paper argues that attempts to promote the participation of rural people in inclusive liberal governance spaces has proved less effective in enhancing their political capabilities than strategies based on economic associational development. Whereas strategies for enhanced inclusive liberal participation engage with the formal de jure rules of the game in ways that either sidestep or re-enforce the de-facto patronage-based political system, associational membership can catalyse shifts in the socio-economic power relations required to enable poor people to gain political agency in ways that begin to undermine patronage politics. This has important implications for both the theory and practice of political capabilities development among disadvantaged groups.\n\n    If you experience problems downloading a file, check if you have the proper application to view it first.

        "text":"Globalization and Democracy Some Argue\u00a0Essay\n\n  \u2022 Length: 7 pages\n  \u2022 Sources: 10\n  \u2022 Subject: Government\n  \u2022 Type: Essay\n  \u2022 Paper: #28894453\n\nExcerpt from Essay :\n\nThat said, Goodhart believes that global governance, if pushed too far into sovereign nations' doings, can in fact undermine popular sovereignty as \"a viable conception of democracy\" but it is not doing that and in fact, in a globalized world that is increasingly interdependence needs a new kind of democracy. The new sovereigntists' views are normative while Goodhart's are more along the lines o positivism. Basically, Goodhart argues that in a globalized world, global governance arrangements (such as certain actions and components of the United Nations) can strengthen constitutional democracy, and it can do this by \"\u2026limiting the power of special interest, securing individual rights, enhancing the quality of democratic deliberation, and increasing capacities to achieve important public purposes\" (1051).\n\nIn concluding, Goodhart explains that while globalization is not easy to define in simple terms, at a \"minimum it connotes increasing global interdependence,\" which, when aimed towards a more democratic world order, can only be a good thing (1055).\n\nThe English School\n\nAndrew Linklater describes the English School as an approach to international politics (from the distinctly British perspective) that embraces the idea that sovereign states do form a society, but that society is \"an anarchic\" society in that the citizens do not have to bow down to a \"higher power\" (Linklater, 2009, p. 84). The English School can be described in general as more positivist than normative in that it sees states as they are rather than what they should be. Linklater believes that members of the English School \"seem distinctively realist at times\" and moreover the English School argues that international relations is based on gravitating towards \"the middle ground, never wholly reconciling themselves to either point-of-view\" (that is, realism or idealism) (85).\n\nWhat does the English School believe about globalization and democracy? First of all, in recent years the English School has taken a more \"explicitly normative stance on questions of poverty and human rights\" which is something of a departure because during the Cold War years the English School stressed the importance of \"\u2026order rather than justice or prosperity\" (Linklater, 88). Secondly, the modern society of states -- this being the first \"truly global one\" -- does not depend on an \"international political culture\" in the same way the European society of states depended on a shared political culture in the nineteenth century (Linklater, 90). Moreover, there is a \"growing consensus\" in the West vis-a-vis the need for \"democratic government\" in the international community, or at least some kind of constitutional safeguards for \"human rights\" (Linklater, 97). If democracy is to be promoted in the developing nations, to \"\u2026achieve justice for the peoples of the Third World,\" there has to be a \"radical redistribution of power and wealth from the North to the South, Linklater explains (101). One of the hopes for global stability is that the international community must take responsibility for states \"\u2026which are no longer economically or politically viable\" (Linklater, 102).\n\n\nAt the top of this paper Eichengreen explains that there are competing arguments as to whether globalization promotes (or helps) democracy, or not. On page 293 Eichengreen notes that the idea of globalization leading to the positive promotion of democratic ideas is not new, but in fact Kant (1795), Schumpeter (1950), Lipset (1959) and Hayek (1960) all had the same belief: free trade and capital flows, and a fair distribution of resources, does raise incomes and does in fact lead to the kind of economic development (in any country, rich or poor) that \"fosters demands, for democracy.\" That is the philosophy that this paper embraces. Although conflicting views of globalization and democracy are presented, the bottom line for this paper is that globalization is not the culprit that some believe it is, and in fact, given the dynamics that Eichengreen puts forward, globalization can and does enhance democratic values.\n\n\nEichengreen, Barry, and Leblang, David. 2008.

The first discussion of affirmative action was in Executive Order 10925 on March 6, 1961. President Johnson introduced this policy as a method of redressing discrimination that continued even with the civil rights laws and constitutional guarantees. Affirmative action was enforced for the first time on September 24, 1965. The focus of this policy was to make sure active measures were being taken to give blacks and other minorities the same opportunities for promotions, raises, scholarships, school admissions and financial aid that whites enjoyed. Initially, this policy was to be temporary until the playing field was level for all Americans.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the late 70s, flaws of the policy were becoming evident in the course of its good intentions. Reverse discrimination was becoming an issue, such as the Bakke case. A medical school rejected Allan Bakke, a white male, two years in a row. The school had accepted less qualified minority applicants instead. They had a separate admissions policy for minorities, reserving 16 out of 100 places. The Supreme Court banned inflexible quota systems in connection with affirmative action programs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A backlash by angry white men began to mount against affirmative action. To conservatives, the system opened doors for jobs, promotions or education for minorities while shutting it for whites.

It was put into law three decades ago to give minorities and women special consideration in employment and education. Generally, goals and timetables are set within the institution for increased diversity. With today\u2019s form of affirmative action, an admissions officer faced with two equally qualified applications can choose the minority over the white or a manager can hire a women instead of a man. These decisions are not to be made based on quotas, give preferential treatment to unqualified candidates, nor harm anyone due to reverse discrimination.\n\nNeed Writing Help?\n\nGet feedback on grammar, clarity, concision and logic instantly.\n\nCheck your paper \u00bb\n\nHow to Cite this Page\n\nMLA Citation:\n\"Affirmative Action.\" 19 Mar 2018\nTitle Length Color Rating \u00a0\nEssay about Affirmative Action - Affirmative action caught in tale of the two cities of Boston, Massachusetts and Denver, Colorado.

Consequently, the liquidationist newspaper has resumed publication after an interruption of one and a half months. (The previous issue of this weekly\u2014No. 6\u2014appeared on July\u00a05, old style.)\n\nThe information published in Nevsky Golos No.\u00a07 provides the best confirmation of the appraisal of the actual significance of the liquidators in Russia which was given in our Central Committee\u2019s letter to the Vorstand.[1]\n\nIndeed, early in July the paper suspended publication. Needless to say, the liquidators and their friends bent all their efforts to revive it. The results of their efforts during one and a half months (July and half August) are reported by Nevsky Golos itself (No.\u00a07) as follows:\n\nThis newspaper has received, for the replenishment of its funds:\n\nJuly. From 14\u00a0persons, 25\u00a0rubles each (I.\u00a0F., P., G., M.\u00a0I., K., L., K. F., L., B., Vsh., Lv., Vl., V.

Total, 281.11 rubles.\u201d\n\nSuch is the account published by the liquidators themselves. Their work and their links with the masses during the one and a half months present the following picture:\n\nCollected in all . \u00a0 . \u00a0 . \u00a0 . \u00a0 . \u00a0 . \u00a0 . \u00a0 . 827.11 rubles\n\n\u00a0 Initiating group, Moscow . . . . . . . 35 rubles\n\u00a0 A group of friends in Paris . . . . . 8.54 \u201d\n\u00a0 Private contributions by individuals:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 35 contributions amounting to . . . 708 \u201d\n\u00a0 15 \u201d \u201d \u201d . . . 75.57 \u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Total . . . . . . . . . . 827.11 rubles\n\nEveryone knows, as Plekhanov stated in print (Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata No.\u00a016) as far back as April\u00a01912, that the \u201cinitiating groups\u201d are groups of liquidators.\n\nAnd so, the liquidators were helped, at the most trying moment, when their paper had suspended publication, by:\n\none group of liquidators in Russia\n\none group of friends in Paris\n\n35 well-to-do persons, each of whom contributed an average of 20\u00a0rubles (over 40\u00a0marks each)\n\n15 private individuals, each of whom contributed an average of 5\u00a0rubles (over 10\u00a0marks each).\n\nWas not our Central Committee justified in asserting that the liquidators in the Russian working-class movement were of no account at all?\n\nThe liquidators refer to the \u201cCaucasian Regional Committee\u201d. Not a single workersgroup in the Caucasus has sent \u00a0 them a single contribution during those one and a half months.\n\nThe liquidators would like to have the help of the Bund and the Lettish Social-Democratic organisation. Not a single workers\u2019 group, either in the Bund or among the Letts, has sent them a single contribution during one and a half months.\n\nDuring the same period (July to August\u00a014) Pravda, the St.\u00a0Petersburg daily newspaper of the anti-liquidators, published accounts of 41\u00a0group collections by workers in various parts of Russia, including oil-field workers (Grozny fields, Terek Region) (Pravda No.\u00a060) and Jewish workers in Lepaya (Pravda No.\u00a067). We venture to think that this aid from workers means more than all the talk and declamation of the \u201cCaucasian Regional Committee\u201d, the Letts and the Bund.\n\nNo aid in the world, and no \u201cconferences\u201d with the Letts, the Bund, etc., can transform the liquidationist nothing in the Russian working-class movement into a something.\n\nLet the German comrades undertake the not too arduous task of collecting the documents on the position of the R.S.D.L.P. and verifying them\u2014after all, Russia is not Central Africa, about which any kind of \u201ctall stories\u201d can be told. The German comrades probably want to end this strange, gelinde gesagt,[2] situation in which they get their information on the Italian, Swedish and any other socialist movement from openly published documents, while their information on the Russian socialist movement is obtained from privately communicated fables and gossip.\n\n\n[1] Executive Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany.\u2014Ed.\n\n[2] To put it mildly\u2014Ed.\n\n[3] The manuscript bears no title; the title given here has been supplied by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the C.\u00a0C. of the C.P.S.U.\n\nWorks Index \u00a0 | \u00a0 Volume 18 | Collected Works \u00a0 | \u00a0 L.I.A.

Through defining a structure for mapping and classifying the measures, key policies and actions designed to promote gender equality in science were identified. The resulting profiles of national policies and statistics relating to women in science were then analysed to determine the extent to which the identified policies and actions were associated with changes in the proportions of women in science in the EU.\n\nThe national policy reports indicate that much progress has been achieved since the last Helsinki group\u2019s report on national policies on women and science (Rees 2002). All the studied countries now have equal treatment legislation, and only three countries (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Israel and Switzerland) do not have a ministry with responsibility for women\u2019s issues or a Statutory Gender Equality Agency. Five more countries (Denmark, Estonia, France, Latvia and Spain) have declared their commitment to gender mainstreaming since 2002, leaving 12 countries (32%) out of 38 with no mainstreaming plans. All but two countries (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro) offer women\u2019s or gender studies courses within their universities, and sex-disaggregated statistics are becoming more available, with only three countries not reporting such data (Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro).(\u2026)\n\nT\u00e9l\u00e9charger le rapport (164p. en): Benchmarking policy measures for gender equality in science_2008",

In many industries management found itself, without the disciplining sanction of redundancy, in a weaker position vis-\u00e0-vis organised labour than ever before. For a time, up to the late fifties, the most common reaction on the part of the bosses was to make the best of this situation, to give way to labour\u2019s demands wherever the only alternative was a stop in production, and to pass on higher costs in the shape of higher prices. The boom was on, and such a boom as never before.\n\nInflation was something to be deplored, publicly, but as long as profit margins could be maintained it was not felt as a real problem. However, competition in world markets increased yearly, and with a semi-stagnant economy the bargaining power of labour became more and more of a problem; the never-forgotten dream of a totally malleable and disciplined working class returned, and Chancellors, industrialists and bourgeois economists sought with increasing energy to find ways of achieving the ultimate aim of any ruling class: a working class that knows its place and keeps it, that demands no more than the ruling class is willing to offer, and that is prepared to pay the costs of its rulers\u2019 blunders. This article will attempt to examine some of the strategies adopted by the ruling class and to show the implications for the working class movement in the sixties. The double burden, firstly of Conservative economics, which involved stop-go monetary policies aimed at successively releasing and shutting off demand in response to the vagaries of the political trade cycle, and secondly of an enormous expenditure on armaments that devoured approximately half of the annual investible surplus, produced an economy that was on the surface stable, but that grew at a rate lower than that of any other developed economy. From 1950 to 1955 the real national product per man-year in Britain rose by 1.8 per cent, and from 1955 to 1961 by 1.6 per cent. (The comparable figures for the two periods in other countries are respectively: West Germany, 6.0 and 3.5 per cent; France, 4.3 and 3.5 per cent; Italy, 5.4 and 4.1 per cent; Netherlands, 4.4 and 2.6 per cent; United States, 2.8 and 1.4 per cent.) [1] From 1954 to 1962 Britain\u2019s share of exports in world trade fell from 20.1 to 15.2 per cent. [2] The balance of payments has been continually precarious; their relatively healthy situation recently reflects not an increasing success on the part of British exporters but an advantageous change in the terms of trade, to the detriment of the primary-producing countries. [3] More equable terms of trade for the primary producers would make the British balance of payments problem more acute; there are signs that recent trading agreements in some commodities will act to raise the prices of raw materials. [4]\n\nPartly because of the benefits of the 1949 devaluation of the pound, the effects of stagnation were not at first felt, for export prices rose more slowly than did home prices without unduly reducing profit margins; and with a boom on abroad, prices there rose fairly quickly, even if not as fast as in Britain. However in the late fifties and early sixties a series of chronic balance of payments problems showed up the structural weaknesses of British capitalism in bold relief.\n\nThe \u2018liberal\u2019 Tory policy of deflation to create unemployment, so as to cut down wage increases and price increases, was shown to be bankrupt; a large volume of output was lost, and there was no improvement in British capital\u2019s competitive position. To bring unemployment to levels where it would have been effective as a price-cutting mechanism was politically too dangerous, even for a cynical Treasury. It became clear that other policies would have to be found, and from the late fifties we have seen successive attempts by Tory Chancellors to find a viable way of increasing the rate of growth of the economy \u2013 the costs of the new policies of course to be passed on to the working class the best way possible.\n\nThree main policies have been proposed, each in effect amounting to a different tactic in one overall strategy, an attempt to reduce the power to bargain of the working class and its representatives. The first is the method whereby capital and the state unite \u2013 as in the National Economic Development Council \u2013 in an attempt to involve the upper echelons of the representatives of the working class in responsibility for some aspects of decision-making, and so to neutralise them as opposition forces. The second is less subtle, and has the longest heritage. It is the tactic of open conflict, whereby the employers, with or without the assistance of the state, are prepared to take a strike or other forms of industrial action (after assessing the likely outcome) as a calculated attempt to weaken the labour force. The third is relatively new to Britain, and has been most highly developed in the US, where unions are persuaded to sign long-term contracts which guarantee an annual rise in wages (and sometimes other benefits) for all workers, in return for the abandonment, for anything from two to five years, of the right to make any further claim on the employers. These tactics, with all kinds of variation, can be found alone or in combination in the history of all the countries of the Western bloc since the war, and their frequency of use is likely to become greater as competition increases.\n\n2. A National Incomes Policy?\n\nThe current attempt by the government and the employers (and by some trade union leaders) to persuade the working class to accept some sort of incomes policy falls into the first category. With it goes parallel effort to persuade the working class that \u2018we are all in it together,\u2019 that the interests of each individual and class are those of the whole \u2018nation,\u2019 to obscure the realities of class society in a fog of slogans of co-operation. The legitimate interests of the working class become the sectional interests of a selfish minority. This idea of society as a harmonious whole has a long heritage, but the forms it takes today are clearly related to the rise of large-scale monopoly capitalism. [5]\n\nThis ideology has appealed particularly to the right of the Labour Party, whose theoreticians long ago lost sight of any adequate notion of class; Crosland is the chief exemplar, but official Labour Party policy hurries along in his footsteps. With the right of the Labour Party go the TUC and the majority of the union leaders, anxious for respectability, for knighthoods and the plaudits of The Daily Mail. Of course this is no new development; caution and moderation have been the stock-in-trade of the big union leaders since long before the General Strike. The colour of the Government has made no difference. [6]\n\nNow the process is being taken further, with the National Economic Development Council, where a fairly willing TUC is quietly coming to accept its part in the planning of capitalism. Under a Labour Government this process is likely to be taken still further, and its implications for the official trade union movement are very clear. A national incomes policy of the sort proposed by the Labour right (and enthusiastically supported by some of Harold Wilson\u2019s strange new friends) would be likely to involve much more centralisation of power in the hands of the TUC, which would have to be able \u2018to speak for all and to enforce its word.\u2019\n\n\u2018It will certainly mean the relegation of the present collective bargaining machinery to a secondary place in the structure since the crucial decision, of the size of the general increase for any one year, will be taken elsewhere ... It also means that the central skill of many union leaders, that of negotiator, will be less important, with consequent effects on their general status.\u2019 [7]\n\nIn return for this loss of function, however, they will perhaps be offered compensations:\n\n\u2018It would probably require a number of the most influential and respected union leaders to take a step up from their position of union secretary to some higher position, perhaps in the government.\u2019 [8]\n\nThe TUC is not likely to be averse to developments of this sort, hoping that its voice may become more influential in the shaping of national policies. And, given the opportunity, there can be no doubt that that voice will speak in very moderate and reasonable tones.\n\nOf late, much to its sorrow, the sweet and reasonable voice of the TUC has not been heard very loudly in the corridors of Whitehall, despite its strenuous efforts to gain the ear of many a civil servant and Cabinet Minister:\n\n\u2018The growing frustration experienced by the Council can be seen from a study of the reports which its specialists committees make to Congress. Here one can read of the failure of the Economic Committee to influence budgetary policy; the Production Committee records its criticisms of Government plans for high-unemployment areas; and the Education Committee reports its unsuccessful attempts to secure the implementation of the Crowther Report. But the decline in influence can be seen at its most tragic in the field of Social Insurance and Industrial Welfare; topics of great concern to the unions, where the General Council\u2019s past achievements have been considerable ...\u2019 [9]\n\nThe TUC has failed to get the number of Factory...

Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this conference is to re-establish a Leninist framework on the national question in the International Communist League and to break with the Great Power chauvinism that has marked certain aspects of the politics and functioning of the International. A fight in Canada that began in the fall of 2016 revealed that since its inception, the Canadian section had an Anglo-chauvinist, assimilationist program for Quebec. This struggle generated strong opposition from an Anglophone layer of historic International Executive Committee cadres who were the source of the line on the national question in Canada and elsewhere. Particularly since the fall of the Soviet Union, part of the international leadership has adapted to U.S. imperialism, mimicking attitudes of dominance toward the neocolonial countries under its boot. The purpose of this conference is to effect a fusion with the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois comrades and elect a new international leadership that will implement a sharp break with the politics of oppressor chauvinism.\n\nAs soon as they founded our tendency, Jim Robertson and Geoff White sought its international extension. But in 1974, as the \u201cDeclaration for the Organizing of an International Trotskyist Tendency\u201d was being signed (see Spartacist [English edition] No. 23, Spring 1977), a number of American cadres embraced an anti-Leninist position on the national question. This perversion of Leninism was both facilitated and exacerbated by the preponderance of the American section in the International. This line was established in opposition to comrade Robertson: already in 1976, he proposed calling for Quebec independence, a proposal that was unanimously rejected. This conference is committed to re-establishing revolutionary Leninism and fighting to reforge the Fourth International.\n\nBecause of the intense upheavals brought about by this fight in the International, this conference effectively has an emergency character, although, formally, it has been regularly convened. This document is therefore focused on the essential conclusions of the past several months, rather than on important changes in the world political situation, which is characterized by the rise of right-wing populist forces in many countries, the election of Trump in the U.S., growing interimperialist rivalries and the possibility of major military conflicts, notably with the deformed workers states. The overriding question for our organization is how to rearm ourselves programmatically and forge a new leadership that will be able to take on these new developments. Fundamentally, we are faced with the central question of the workers movement: revolutionary leadership.\n\nII. For the Forging of an International Leninist Leadership\n\n\u201cOn the basis of a long historical experience, it can be written down as a law that revolutionary cadres, who revolt against their social environment and organize parties to lead a revolution, can\u2014if the revolution is too long delayed\u2014themselves degenerate under the continuing influences and pressures of this same environment....\n\n\u201cBut the same historical experience also shows that there are exceptions to this law too. The exceptions are the Marxists who remain Marxists, the revolutionists who remain faithful to the banner. The basic ideas of Marxism, upon which alone a revolutionary party can be constructed, are continuous in their application and have been for a hundred years. The ideas of Marxism, which create revolutionary parties, are stronger than the parties they create, and never fail to survive their downfall. They never fail to find representatives in the old organizations to lead the work of reconstruction.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u0007James P. Cannon, The First Ten Years of American Communism (New York: Lyle Stuart, 1962)\n\nIt\u2019s precisely the task of reconstructing the ICL that this conference is facing. In order to truly break with Anglo-chauvinism in the party, it is necessary to reclaim our own programmatic continuity on the national question, i.e., the positions developed by Marx and Lenin. Through this fight, we seek to reassert the revolutionary, proletarian and internationalist program of Lenin\u2019s Third International, codified in the first four Congresses of the Communist International (Comintern, or CI).\n\nForging a true International, already a difficult task after the Bolsheviks took power, became an ever-greater challenge for the proletarian vanguard with the degeneration of the Russian Revolution and the CI. Trotsky was never able to effectively consolidate an international collective, due to his extremely difficult objective situation in exile, a lack of material resources and the murder of Trotskyist cadres. After Trotsky\u2019s death, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) [led by James P. Cannon] was the section best situated to take on the leadership of the Fourth International. Rather than stepping up to the challenge and taking the leadership of the International, the American Trotskyists withdrew into isolation, without it being truly imposed on them. Comrade Robertson remarked in 1974:\n\n\u201cSo Cannon backed off, and we\u2019re stuck with the job. He stuck us with it doubly. Because he was a lot better than we are\u2014and when I say \u2018he\u2019 I mean not only Cannon personally but the immediate working crew that made up the \u2018Cannon regime\u2019....\n\n\u201cWell there was a Cannon regime, and they were doing the best they could. But they didn\u2019t accept the international challenge, and yet it is an obligation. Yes, if you know that you don\u2019t know anything, go patiently, quietly, perseveringly; struggle with the greatest patience and attention for international collaborators. We have to go that way, not back off and wait in national isolation for somebody else to come forward and say, \u2018I can do it,\u2019 and then we say, \u2018all right; we\u2019ll give you our authority.\u2019 We have to persist; we have to intervene.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u0007\u201cJames P. Cannon Memorial Meeting,\u201d Spartacist (English edition) No. 38-39, Summer 1986\n\nDrawing critical lessons from the SWP, from the inception of our tendency, our founding cadres actively sought to break out of their isolation in the U.S. They understood that such isolation would inevitably lead to deformations. Being an internationalist demands a very high level of consciousness: it is necessary to understand the pressures associated with one\u2019s social and national origins in order to fight them. The backwardness of the working class as well as the strength of U.S. imperialism are powerful pressures that operate on the SL\/U.S. Comrade Robertson fought relentlessly to develop the consciousness among Anglophone comrades of the importance of learning other languages and getting experience outside their national terrain. In fact, he long sought to move our international center from New York to Paris but never succeeded, due to the lack of resources in the French section. Despite all his efforts, part of the American leadership developed a chauvinist, anti-internationalist line, opposing national liberation struggles in multinational states. This line caused us incalculable damage, greatly limiting our ability to extend internationally, especially in non-Anglophone oppressed nations. There was a sharp contrast between our approach in places where comrade Robertson was actively involved in the work, such as the British Isles and Ceylon, where we had a Leninist position, and places where he had very little involvement, such as Canada or Spain, where our line was openly chauvinist.\n\nThe Trotskyist position on the Soviet Union was a central programmatic reference point for our tendency. The fall of the USSR marked a key turning point in history and also for the internal life of our organization. This event came after years of working-class retreat in the West, and these objective developments coincided with comrade Robertson, the main architect of our internationalist politics, leaving the center. These accumulated factors led a layer of cadres to become deeply disoriented and to call into question our revolutionary purpose. The loss of a revolutionary proletarian compass led successive party regimes to seek shortcuts through a series of opportunist campaigns. Up until 2008, successive regimes proved themselves unable to provide true Leninist, internationalist leadership to the ICL. Already expressed in our chauvinist line, our adaptation to the pressures of American society was magnified by this opportunism, which is always an adaptation to a national terrain.\n\nDuring this period, the Leninist conception of party building was thus largely subordinated to opportunism and an adaptation to American imperialism. There was resistance to integrating non-Anglophone cadres into an effective international leadership collective, as well as hostility to building strong national sections. The International Secretariat had a tendency to utilize the sections outside the U.S. as satellites in the service of opportunist campaigns, as during the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d and the Mumia campaign. The drift away from building a vanguard party had an impact on the treatment of comrades most oppressed by society: they were generally neither seen nor trained as Marxist cadres and leaders of the International. Rather, they were developed as \u201cgood\u201d activists and used as foot soldiers in \u201crank-and-file\u201d work. Thus, bourgeois social relations were reflected within the party and tended to reinforce the oppression felt by these comrades.\n\nOur practice in the last decades is in sharp contrast with the attempted fusion with Edmund Samarakkody\u2019s group (\u201cAgreement on Unification of the Revolutionary Workers Party [RWP] of Sri Lanka with the International Spartacist Tendency,\u201d 20 June 1979):\n\n\u201c(2) real, full, frequent, regular participation in IEC meetin...

The whole authority of the Constitution rests upon it. If they did not consent, it was of no validity. Of course it had no validity, except as between those who actually consented. No one\u2019s consent could be presumed against him, without his actual consent being given, any more than in the case of any other contract to pay money, or render service. And to make it binding upon any one, his signature, or other positive evidence of consent, was as necessary as in the case of any other contract. If the instrument meant to say that any of \u201cthe people of the United States\u201d would be bound by it, who Edition: current; Page: [4] did not consent, it was a usurpation and a lie. The most that can be inferred from the form, \u201cWe, the people,\u201d is, that the instrument offered membership to all \u201cthe people of the United States;\u201d leaving it for them to accept or refuse it, at their pleasure.\n\nThe agreement is a simple one, like any other agreement. It is the same as one that should say: We, the people of the town of A\u2014, agree to sustain a church, a school, a hospital, or a theatre, for ourselves and our children.\n\nSuch an agreement clearly could have no validity, except as between those who actually consented to it. If a portion only of \u201cthe people of the town of A\u2014,\u201d should assent to this contract, and should then proceed to compel contributions of money or service from those who had not consented, they would be mere robbers; and would deserve to be treated as such.\n\nNeither the conduct nor the rights of these signers would be improved at all by their saying to the dissenters: We offer you equal rights with ourselves, in the benefits of the church, school, hospital, or theatre, which we propose to establish, and equal voice in the control of it. It would be a sufficient answer for the others to say: We want no share in the benefits, and no voice in the control, of your institution; and will do nothing to support it.\n\nThe number who actually consented to the Constitution of the United States, at the first, was very small. Considered as the act of the whole people, the adoption of the Constitution was the merest farce and imposture, binding upon nobody.\n\nThe women, children, and blacks, of course, were not asked to give their consent. In addition to this, there were, in nearly or quite all the States, property qualifications that excluded probably one half, two thirds, or perhaps even three fourths, of the white male adults from the right of suffrage. And of those who were allowed that right, we know not how many exercised it.\n\nFurthermore, those who originally agreed to the Constitution, could thereby bind nobody that should come after them. They could contract for nobody but themselves. They had no more Edition: current; Page: [5] natural right or power to make political contracts, binding upon succeeding generations, than they had to make marriage or business contracts binding upon them.\n\nStill further. Even those who actually voted for the adoption of the Constitution, did not pledge their faith for any specific time; since no specific time was named, in the Constitution, during which the association should continue. It was, therefore, merely an association during pleasure; even as between the original parties to it. Still less, if possible, has it been any thing more than a merely voluntary association, during pleasure, between the succeeding generations, who have never gone through, as their fathers did, with so much even as any outward formality of adopting it, or of pledging their faith to support it. Such portions of them as pleased, and as the States permitted to vote, have only done enough, by voting and paying taxes, (and unlawfully and tyrannically extorting taxes from others,) to keep the government in operation for the time being. And this, in the view of the Constitution, they have done voluntarily, and because it was for their interest, or pleasure, and not because they were under any pledge or obligation to do it. Any one man, or any number of men, have had a perfect right, at any time, to refuse his or their further support; and nobody could rightfully object to his or their withdrawal.\n\nThere is no escape from these conclusions, if we say that the adoption of the Constitution was the act of the people, as individuals, and not of the States, as States. On the other hand, if we say that the adoption was the act of the States, as States, it necessarily follows that they had the right to secede at pleasure, inasmuch as they engaged for no specific time.\n\nThe consent, therefore, that has been given, whether by individuals, or by the States, has been, at most, only a consent for the time being; not an engagement for the future. In truth, in the case of individuals, their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, even for the time being. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, without his consent having ever been asked, a Edition: current; Page: [6] man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that other men practise this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own. In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self-defence, he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself. Because, to save his own life in battle, a man attempts to take the lives of his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot\u2014which is a mere substitute for a bullet\u2014because, as his only chance of self-preservation, a man uses a ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights, as a stake against those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, in an exigency, into which he had been forced by others, and in which no other means of self-defence offered, he, as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was left to him.\n\nDoubtless the most miserable of men, under the most oppressive government in the world, if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of thereby ameliorating their condition. But it would not therefore be a legitimate inference that the government itself, that crushes them, was one which they had voluntarily set up, or ever consented to.\n\nTherefore a man\u2019s voting under the Constitution of the United States, is not to be taken as evidence that he ever freely assented to the Constitution, even for the time being. Consequently we have no proof that any very large portion, even of the actual Edition: current; Page: [7] voters of the United States, ever really and voluntarily consented to the Constitution, even for the time being. Nor can we ever have such proof, until e... (truncated)",
