I am a fashion blogger with aspirations of becoming a well-known stylist and designer. I am currently enrolled at Savannah College of Art and Design pursuing an M.A. in Luxury and Fashion Management.\n\n\nI graduated from Florida International University in Spring 2016 with two degrees: a B.S. in Broadcast Media and a B.A. Psychology. While pursuing my undergraduate degrees, I interned for several companies including Ocean Drive Magazine. I was also invited to become a co-founder of the Venezuelan Student Alliance which became my first exposure to a leadership role. I began as events coordinator and made my way up to the presidency of the club.\u00a0\n\nAs a young girl, I developed an interest in fashion and the arts; something that has influenced me throughout my life. In January 2014, I decided to combine my studies and my passions and created a blog. Moda Addicted is a space where I practice my writing with the purpose of inspiring young women to be their better selves. The fashion and lifestyle blog purpose is to inspire readers, through my outfits and photographs, and tips on how to remain in style and have an enjoyable social life without spending much money on it.\n\n\nMy goals include to become a well-known fashion stylist and to put to practice my luxury management skill and create my own clothing label.",

I didn\u2019t know how or when but it had to happen. 2 years ago I joined make-up school next to my job. Locked myself in my room and watched youtube videos 24\/7. \u00a0And i got all the questions. The \u201dhow are you going to do this?\u201d the \u201dWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d \u201dCan you find a \u2018real\u2019 job in Make-up?\u201d And i would say with a straight face: \u201dI will succeed and it will happen. 100% sure.\u201d I often get the sarcastic \u201dyes, sure you can\u201d or that i souldn\u2019t be so confident\/arrogant because it\u2019s not that easy. And that\u2019s true, it\u2019s certainly not easy. But it\u2019s SO worth it.\n\nAnd now 2 years later i worked with the best brand. Tom Ford, Estee Lauder, Urban Decay, Rotterdam Fashion Week and a lot more. And i\u2019m loving it! Something i didn\u2019t even dare to dream about before. Nothing is more important in life than doing something that makes you happy. And i am lucky enough to say i am a very happy girl!\n\nWith this I want to say to everyone who can\u2019t see the light anymore at the end of the tunnel, or for everyone who think they can\u2019t. YOU CAN. I know it\u2019s cliche but if you really want something, you really can.\n\nFrom now on i want to share my story, my make-up advices, turotials, reviews and my life with you! I hope you will join my journey. And if you have any questions (about everything) please reach out to me!!\n\nThank you for visiting this website and.. stay tuned!",
