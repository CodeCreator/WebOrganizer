        "text":"Progression is not always met with acceptance. Sometimes the odd feelings that come with changing culture must be fought and hope must flare in the darkest of unexplored corners. \u00a0\n\n\nA man and woman are sitting in a restaurant. The atmosphere is light and brilliant, full of happiness and comfort. The waiters and waitresses are kind and steadfast. The scenery is lovely. Everything is going right. Then, the bill arrives.\n\n\nThe man begins to pull out his wallet, a natural response for him. What he doesn\u2019t expect is the woman to pull out hers as well. She grins knowingly at his confusion, his eventual opposition for what she wants to do. Her goal? To pay for the both of them. The two will debate but both sides will remain adamant. Let\u2019s pause this vision and ask a question. Why are the two people doing what they\u2019re doing?\n\n\nFor the man\u2019s case, the possible drive force behind his thought process could be tradition and faith his ability to be there for the people in his life. This is his date, a woman he respects and wants to take care of. For hundreds of years it has been this way. The male is supposed to take care of the female. It\u2019s a gentleman\u2019s duty. Isn\u2019t it?\n\n\nFor the woman\u2019s case, there is also a possible drive force fueling the divergence of her thought process. Apart from specific details, examples such as paying off a debt or remembering a previous favor, she can be opting for two things. One, she can be exercising her independence. That yes, she too can take care of her date. A second, she has the simple desire to pay the bill regardless of the situation.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s significant is both persons giving each other the floor for presenting their arguments. Below the opposing sides is acknowledgment that both are able to take care of the other. Regardless of how the situation turns out, the necessary key point to absorb is the idea of a woman being able to take on the role of the protector as well. The idea that she doesn\u2019t always have to be taken care of. The chivalry can exist and for some people, it\u2019s a requirement in their partners. However, a woman paying the bill for a date doesn\u2019t need to be seen as a foreign action or a way to undermine her partner. It could be a simple logical thing.\n\nAn efficient step towards equality.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nParamjot Kaur\nYouth Ambassador\n\nTo write is to paint thoughts into existence.

I went from seven and a half stone at the age of 11 to a massive 17 stone by the time I was 16, even though I was a mere 5\u20198 in height.

        "text":"No More Vikings\n\nHis sweat smelled like Cheetos and he wore a kilt.\u00a0 Yes, my date on this balmy, humid, moisture dripping late July Sunday afternoon fancies himself a Scottish Viking plunked down in the middle of central Pennsylvania.\n\n\nLest anyone think I deem every date over 6\u2019 as Viking in stature because of my previously recounted encounter with a certain Ginger Viking, I feel the need to clarify that this time it was the gentleman who described himself as \u201cA Geek Brain in a Viking Frame\u201d in the opening tag of his online profile.\u00a0 He even reinforced it with a photo of himself ensconced in a horned helmet.\u00a0 \u00a0Be still my quivering loins!\u00a0 Actually, for a 5\u20192\u201d sapiosexual this combination can be quite alluring.\n\n\nI don\u2019t have a physical type per se.\u00a0 I have dated men exactly the same height as me and men who top out at 6\u20196\u201d.\u00a0 P.S.\u00a0 One of those did not give me a crick in the neck to kiss while standing.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure all you smart folks can guess which one.\u00a0 They have been thin and meaty and every variety in between.\u00a0 However, there is a certain visceral appeal to tall, burly men for a sturdy farm girl like me.\u00a0 I might be pocket size in height but the rest of me is soft and fleshy, strong and sturdy, Rubenesque instead of waif.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0There is an instinctual tremble in my lower gut to men who look like they can toss me around my own bed with ease.\u00a0 And maybe with a growl\u2026\u2026\n\n\nAnd isn\u2019t that the whole point of dating?\u00a0 To find someone enjoyable with whom to converse and then toss each other around naked?\n\n\nA Geek Brain in a Viking Frame certainly sounds like someone who might understand my references to Sonic Screwdrivers, entertain a debate on how the zombie genre is actually intense social commentary with bonus special FX make-up AND be able to pick a farm girl up and throw her on the bed all manly, where\u2019s my mead, I just sailed my longboat across the bitter Atlantic and conquered EVERYONE style.\u00a0 It always sounds good on paper. \u00a0In theory, and internet dating algorithm magic, we should be a perfect union.\u00a0 OK Cupid said so, weighing in at a confident 99% match.\u00a0 The Interweb never lies, right?\n\n\nTo be fair, I knew about the kilt pre date.\u00a0 We had seen each other\u2019s pictures but he also did the we-met-online real people version of \u201cI\u2019ll be wearing a red carnation in my lapel, meet at the top of the Empire State Building, life is a Nora Ephron movie\u201d by telling me he would be the super tall one in the kilt by the picnic tables.\u00a0 We were meeting for a free concert in the park (no super awkward moments over who pays the check this time!) with some time before to take a walk and try out our conversational compatibility before it might be drowned out by the funky fresh beat of The Pimps of Joytime.\u00a0 No, no I did not make that up and it brings me great glee to say it even now.\u00a0 So much so I might just do it again.\u00a0 The Pimps of Joytime.\u00a0 Pimps, you are welcome for the free publicity\u2026..\u00a0 Hmmmm, that didn\u2019t come out right\u2026.. \u00a0My original thought before being distracted by fun band names is that I am totally judgment free on the kilt.\u00a0 Be you, be free.\u00a0\u00a0 However, being judgment free doesn\u2019t mean the 12 year old boy in me isn\u2019t currently karaoking a very inappropriate scrotal parody of Tom Petty\u2019s Free Fallin\u2019.\nAt least it\u2019s a breeze free day.\n\n\n\nWho am I to judge anyway?\u00a0 I\u2019m a 36-yr-old showing up in Heidi Ann braids like I\u2019m getting ready to climb up the mountain and milk a goat for my grandfather.\u00a0 The sturdy farm girl in me rears her head again!\u00a0 There\u2019s no escaping one\u2019s roots.\u00a0 Call me Swiss Miss Girl if you must but braids keep my neck cooler.\u00a0 A bun tends to make me look a bit Amish.\u00a0 This is central PA so it\u2019s not that far-fetched.\u00a0 Please Google it up if you\u2019re unaware of the religious sect that eschews modern convenience and made my learning to drive as a teenager a game of Frogger:\u00a0 Horse and Buggy Edition.\n\n\nSo, I knew there would be a kilt even though there isn\u2019t any restaurant serving haggis around and the Renaissance Faire grounds are a good 20 minutes north.\u00a0 What I did not know is that his posted pictures were all fresh out of the Just For Men dye job box and it had been quite some time since a revisit to the Rite-Aid.\u00a0 Before the tsking starts about skipping my stones on the well, aren\u2019t you shallow pond, I actually prefer salt and pepper, or straight up gray, and people who embrace aging instead of bowing to the oppressive cult of youth perpetrated by the commercialism juggernaut that permeates our culture these days.\u00a0 I\u2019m also for doing things that make you feel better about yourself, so if it involves tinfoil and combing in some squid ink, comb away!\u00a0 What I don\u2019t care for is a jarring discontinuity between what one puts forth as truth and what is actually truth.\u00a0 I try to be exceedingly honest these days before I meet a new man in person because life is too short for bullshit.\u00a0 If they don\u2019t bolt or Casper, we\u2019re already a leg up on someone being tied to a bedrail.\u00a0 Apparently, and unfortunately, not everyone shares this view.\u00a0 I really could have cared less about his gray beard and his bald head if I had known but all his pictures were of a hale and hearty raven haired Viking with a full and bountiful beard.\u00a0 I felt duped from 50 paces out.\u00a0 But I\u2019m trying to be all 7-11 Open these days and I get the impetus to smudging the online truth to put yourself in the best light.\n\n\nI committed to an outing and I don\u2019t flake.\u00a0 Even when my second impression via super-awkward first meeting hug is the wafting scent of stale corn chips leaking out his skin and directly into my nostrils.\u00a0 I wish I didn\u2019t recognize that smell but I do.\u00a0 Years of a myriad of unwanted scents from working in healthcare tells me this is very much the aroma of unwashed men, with incredibly poor grooming habits, sweating profusely.\u00a0 At the hospital, they sweat from pain and fever.\u00a0 Here, it\u2019s the late afternoon sun beating down.\u00a0 I use every ounce of will not to look at his toenails for fear I become the sturdy, white farm girl version of Usain Bolt and sprint the fuck out of here.\n\n\nI take a deep breath (upwind), smile, and agree to drop our blankets in the concert area before setting out for our conversational constitutional.\u00a0 Yes, more sweat.\u00a0 Sure, great idea.\u00a0 The park has a large man made pond with ducks to feed and even a swan or two.\u00a0 A walking path encircles the whole she-bang and we set out to trek around it, mosquitos and West Nile be damned.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The conversation is pleasant enough, if not a bit stifled and lacking a certain zest.\u00a0 His grown kids, him going back to school at 40-something.\u00a0 Plenty of geek related topics, touching on Game of Thrones and World War Z.\u00a0 The book, not the movie.\u00a0 Read.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Studies show readers tend to have more empathy and we sure could use that in our current cultural and political state\u2026\u2026 but I\u2019ll get back on topic before I start a tirade about joining the resistance and donning a pussy hat of my own.\u00a0 Back to July and pre-What clipartfest.comthe Fuck Did We Do Election.\u00a0 He likes going to goth dance nights in his kilts.\u00a0 I can only imagine the smell at 2 am after a night of glow sticks and Industrial music.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though about walking with a man over a foot taller:\u00a0 My stubby legs literally can\u2019t keep up unless I STRIDE.\u00a0 He\u2019s STROLLING.\u00a0 I\u2019m STRIDING.\u00a0 For every step he takes I must take two.\u00a0 My own sweat is gathering in the small of my back, rolling from the under swell of my breasts and down my sides.\u00a0 Thanks to the shower I took pre date, I\u2019m pretty sure I smell like clean sweat and not stale corn chips but who knows at this point?\u00a0 It\u2019s all mingling together with the pungent smell of duck shit.\u00a0 After our ten thousandth trip around I realize sandals may not have been the best choice.\u00a0 I dressed for a leisurely Sunday stroll and an open air concert enjoyed from a blanket with fireflies in the dusk and people watching, not a death march a la Stephen King as Richard Bachman Long Walk style.\u00a0 I can feel the blisters forming on the pads and arches of my feet.\u00a0 Cheeto Sweat is not worth band aids over bleeding blisters.\u00a0 Luckily, it\u2019s almost show time for some Pimps.\u00a0 Oh, but I\u2019m more than ready for a little Joytime.\n\n\nThe next few hours are quite joyful in music.\u00a0 I people watch and dog watch and kid watch.\u00a0 I often go to these summer concerts alone in this park, spreading my blanket out and watching the hipsters hula hoop, the dogs sniff each other, and the kids roll in the grass.\u00a0 The concerts themselves are always a great way to wrap up a weekend.\u00a0 The Scottish Viking and I talk some more but after a bit I lay back and stare at the trees above us, letting the music pound through my sternum and under my ribs.\u00a0 I let it wash over me.\u00a0 I bop my head against the blanket, against the earth below it, a tree root digging straight into my lower back.\u00a0 I let myself go and be here, in this moment.\u00a0 There is no date, no Scottish Viking reeking of stale snacks.\u00a0 Only me with the feel of the cooling grass under my bare toes flung over the edge of the blanket, only the beat bopping the braids right out of my hair.\u00a0 I open my eyes to the dimming sun, watching the bats swirl through the trees above now that the moon shines more brightly.\u00a0 The Scottish Viking, trying to assert his Grown Man Gothness and Look At Me Nonconformity remarks bats are among his favorite animals.\u00a0 I close my eyes so he can\u2019t see me roll them in the remnants of light.\u00a0 Remark it\u2019s time to pack it up.\n\n\nCheeto Sweat obliges and offers me a ride back to my car I left outside the park since his truck is close.\u00a0 I weigh my options of another long walk on my burgeoning blisters or another ten minutes with him in a more enclosed space.\u00a0 I choose a ride.\u00a0 At least he\u2019s a touch self-aware enough to roll the windows down.\n\n\nHe drops me at my car and we don\u2019t bother to pretend there will be a second date.\u00a0 It\u2019s obvious there is no chemistry here.\u00a0 Maybe it was the off kilter pheromones.\u00a0 Maybe it was me.\u00a0 Maybe it was him.\u00a0 M...

I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend!\u00a0Mine was pretty great\u00a0: ) Lots of relaxing and snuggling with the boy between Friday and Saturday. I couldn't get enough of being wrapped up with a blanket on the couch with Ryan. It was so cold....I hate going out because I have to put what seems like 20 layers on just to stay warm! On Sunday the weather got a little nicer and the temp was up around 50 so we ventured out to run some errands and such. Although I did get dressed up for a date on Saturday night (which was amazing-sushi!), the rest of the weekend my outfits didn't get past this point....\nWeekend by thesweetashleylife (<~~~Click to view items)\nI had to have my scarf, boots, and wool socks. Yes, I even asked if I looked like a teeny bopper, with my boots and skinnies.....Ryan assured me that I could 'pull it off'. Haha I'm not sure if I'm happy with that or sad! Either way, I stayed warm!\n\nEven though we spent a lot of time at home, we still had some fun! We drank this season's first batch of eggnog (someone might have spiked it...), ate\u00a0pizza, watched movies (Perfect Host, which was pretty good) and laughed at some SNL goodness. I even made two more wreaths yesterday to ship out. So, add productive to the list!\n\nThis morning I've been\u00a0trying to figure out my holiday schedule. Between figuring out time off from work, figuring out a moving schedule, figuring out the time we'll be spending with family (here and in KY), plus all of the normal stuff--I can't keep track of it all!

Woodchuck, Kel and Squirrel lived on the west coast at that time and met us in Seattle when we there to board a cruise to Alaska. Unfortunately all of them have dropped out of the bloggosphere. We read about their adventures on Facebook, but it is not the same. \u00a0Woodchuck (aka Bob) and Kel have become good freinds, they now live in northern Indiana and we see them from time to time. \u00a0I should let Squirrel know I am going to be in Portland in a \u00a0week or so.\n\nAnd now through the Bloggerpoloza we have met a new and larger circle of friends. \u00a0I have seen a couple of you outside of the gathering and I look forward to meeting more. \u00a0I have to make it Wales one of these days.\n\n\n  1. I would LOVE to meet squire john gray in person; such a loveable chap, don't you think? I have spoken with him by telephone.\n\n    many of the people I have met thru blogging are the salt of the earth. others...well, I have to avoid due to toxic temperaments. some have quit blogging, others have crossed the rainbow bridge to the atmosphere, others I have lost interest in over time. but there are so many people to be discovered yet!\n\n    I am glad I have met you and sweet bear thru the magic of the internet connections!\n\n  2. I've met a few bloggers and they were all fantastic.",

How many people would love to lose weight before they get married.. probably everyone and I was granted the best gift ever. My MGB from March 2009 allowed me to have an amazing wedding with dancing and kneeling and jumping.. It may sound strange to say this but as a 350lbs person these experiences would be totally different.\n\nMy wife is amazing.. the best friend.. the best companion. She has been with me at 350 and now at 170. She is one of the reasons I decided to have the MGB and I am thankful to God that I made the decision to have it done.\n\nHoneymoon here we come!\n\nNewer Posts Older Posts Home",

        "text":"Housing Homeless Youth Takes Trust, Love\n\nTaking care of the homeless is an ongoing problem in Alaska and it\u2019s not limited to adults. There is also a large, and less visible, population of homeless kids. During the day they might be in school, indistinguishable from other students. But at night, they\u2019re couch surfers. These kids may be avoiding an unsafe situation at home, or they\u2019re over 18 \u2014 between childhood and adulthood \u2014 and simply have no options.\n\nKCAW visits with a family in Sitka who participates in a host home program \u2014 the only one in Alaska, and one of very few in the nation. They take in kids from ages 16 through 21 who have no place to go and give them a home.\n\nThere\u2019s this family in Sitka that has homeless teenagers living in their house. It might make some people nervous \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to raise a teenager or being one for that matter \u2014 especially when dealing with all the problems that come with being homeless. The family, a longtime married couple, looks past what the kids might seem like on the outside and look inside for who they really are.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had children in our home that people are just dumbfounded that we let them into our home,\u201d the host dad says. \u201cTheir jaw drops. My response is, I don\u2019t know this person you\u2019re talking about. Kids make mistakes. If they make mistakes in a different environment, that\u2019s a different deal.\u201d\n\nThe couple is part of a program run by the nonprofit Youth Advocates of Sitka, or YAS. It places homeless youth with families in the community. We\u2019ve been asked to keep the resource parents\u2019 names confidential to protect the identities of the homeless teens they\u2019ve hosted.\n\nThe resource dad says most of the people they invite into their home have really become part of the family.\n\n\u201cI call them all my children,\u201d he said. \u201cLong after they\u2019re gone, many of them have grown up, and have bought their own homes and their own cars, have their own families, and have moved to different parts of the United States. For us it\u2019s about family. We wanted to have a large family and sometimes things don\u2019t turn out the way you think, but it\u2019s been a blessing for us because now we can still have a large family.\u201d\n\nClients can be 16 through 21 years old and are able to stay in a home for up to 18 months. The program is funded by a federal grant and is the only one of its kind in Alaska.\n\nThe couple has hosted more than a dozen youth over the five-year life of the program. They also take younger foster care kids. Since they always wanted a big family, they\u2019re committed to having the same dynamic in their house.\n\n\u201cI have five sisters and three brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s the oldest of 7. So we\u2019re very comfortable with large families. We know what it\u2019s like to share food and do dishes and have to think of others\u2026we encourage family dinners. Every night. That\u2019s really important. We both come from families where everybody, no matter what your schedule was, you had to be home at a certain time.\u201d\n\nCultivating healthy relationships can be really hard, especially if trust has been broken in the past like it has been for many of these youth. And the host mom believes that to have a healthy relationship, love isn\u2019t necessarily required.\n\n\u201cA big thing is communication and trust,\u201d said the host mom. \u201cTrust is a huge thing. A lot of times, we\u2019ve had conversations with our kids or with each other about what matters most, love or trust? You know, you don\u2019t need to have both to have a healthy relationship. But having trust is so much bigger.\u201d\n\nLove is unconditional; trust is not. They say that to cultivate and keep trust, you have to avoid so-called \u201cdeal breakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you violate emotional, physical, spiritual\u2026those kinds of things are deal breakers.\u201d It usually comes down to physical abuse or emotional abuse.\u201d\n\nOther deal breakers are using alcohol, pot and other substances that might play a large role in some of the lives of these kids. This is a clean home \u2013 they don\u2019t even drink a glass of wine at dinner.\n\n\u201cSo, they\u2019re able to see that kind of a lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little different for them to experience that, and to learn how that kind of lifestyle is and to know that it\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0accepted into their home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to create is an environment where they have to be dishonest with us,\u201d\u2018 said the host dad. \u201cSo, we really try to foster dialogue and an environment where they\u2019re going to feel safe to talk with us. Some can\u2019t handle it. Their substances are very important to them, so have to leave the house.\u201d\n\nAnd the program has some deal breakers, too. In order for the youth to qualify for the program, they have to be willing to set some goals of their own and work toward becoming independent.\n\nJessica Clark is the family resource center program manager of YAS. She meets with clients to make an individual plan. She says just setting goals helps a lot of people get on their feet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard people say, I would like to be a rockstar,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working with youth, it\u2019s really easy to be like, come on now, you\u2019re homeless and you wanna be a rockstar. Let\u2019s talk about reality. The reality is, if you start listing what you need to have in line and do to be a rockstar, you\u2019ll find out that it\u2019s a lot of the same job skills that you might need, minus maybe the music part.\u201d\n\nJust as each person\u2019s life plan is individualized, so is the home placement. All different types of families take part in the program, and a lot of care is put into matching up the family and youth in a situation that they all feel good in.\n\n\u201cWe always keep in touch with them,\u201d said the host dad. \u201cThey call us up, they still come over. Even years later, the kids do. To say hello, wish us happy birthday. It\u2019s like having older kids when you\u2019re\u2026I feel like an old man, because I\u2019m going to my kid\u2019s house\u2026\u201d\n\nListen to the full story\n\nDownload Audio",

Full of wonder and full of entertaining explanations and questions. Five teeters on the edge of home and world in this delirious new experience called \"school,\" a place where baby brains become full with education, friendship, growth and development. Five is magical. Five is inspirational. Five loves being five.\n\nAnd five years after her arrival on this earth, she is, to me, delightful, wonderful and inspirational. Kyrie, five years later, has grown to include all of you in her life, to include many other children in heaven waiting for their parents, friends, family.\n\nI love that she shares a birthday with perhaps our number one fan, Susan, aka Easter Bunny. Kyrie also shares a birthday with my dear godson, who has volunteered at several of the foundation's events. Born on Labor Day five years ago, perhaps that was a sign, too, of the work that would be presented to all of us to fight this fight, to protect kindergartners' brains.\n\nI believe that we received a birthday gift for Kyrie last night. It's something that I've alluded to in the past couple months, and in a few weeks, I hope to share some good, big news\u2014a gift that could mean a lot to the foundation.\n\nAnd in the spirit of appreciating the 5-year-olds in your life or remembering what 5 years old was like with one of your children, I hope you'll come September 18 to celebrate this journey with us.\n\nHappy birthday, sweet Kyrie. We love you dearly and miss you terribly. Thank you so much for bringing incredible joy to your parents and for showing us a new reason to be generous with our time, talent and treasure. Please continue to stay with us as we keep working to save children just like you.\n\nNo comments:",

        "text":"Thursday, May 19, 2011\n\n\nPart I:\u00a0 Baby Moses\nMy big 20-week ultrasound was Monday morning, and we learned that Baby Moses is a BOY!\u00a0 I realize the odds were roughly 50\/50 that this baby would be male, but I was still shocked.\u00a0 As in, I didn't know how to react, I asked the ultrasound tech to look again just to make sure, I still have trouble calling the baby \"he.\"\u00a0 I was just very convinced this one was a girl.\u00a0 My intuition regarding pregnancy seems to be worthless.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDaniel and I can't decide yet what we want this little guy's name to be.\u00a0 We looked at a list of Old Testament names online the other night, and it was just comical.\u00a0 We were trying to find some fresh options in all seriousness, but we ended up in fits of laughter multiple times.\u00a0 You know how sometimes you're in situations at church where you have to read some weird biblical name out loud, and someone makes a joke about how you should name your kid that?\u00a0 It was like that, except we're actually trying to figure out what to name our kid.\u00a0 We still have plenty of time to decide, but I am a psycho and want this baby to have a name yesterday.\n\nBaby Moses, if you read this someday, please know that my thinking you were a girl and failing to have a name ready for you is no indication of how I feel about you.\u00a0 I love you just as much as I loved your older brother when he was \"in my tummy.\"\n\nPart II:\u00a0 Baby Ben\nIt's that time again -- time for a new round of Funny Stuff Ben Says and Does!\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 For a little while, Ben knew Daniel's and my first names.\u00a0 But now when you ask him what Mommy or Daddy's name is, he answers, \"Honey.\"\n  \u2022 \u00a0He has a freakish memory.\u00a0 We can read a book or sing a new song once or twice, and he can suddenly fill in the blanks if you ask him to.\n  \u2022 While reading a favorite book about a visit from Nana, he showed extra interest in the page where Nana gives the little-girl protagonist a nightgown.\u00a0 I usually call the nightgown \"pajamas\" to keep it somewhat relevant to my non-nightgown-wearing son, but I explained it a little further this time, and the following conversation ensued:\nMicah: That's a nightgown.\u00a0 Girls wear nightgowns.\nBen: Giwls wear nightgowns.\nMicah: What do boys wear?\nBen: Boys wear... shirts.\nHe states both of these facts several more times, then out of nowhere...\nBen: Giwls wear... nuffins! (hysterical laughter)\nI had no idea this sentiment was one boys spontaneously created before age two.\u00a0 I am in big, big trouble.\n  \u2022 \u00a0He's started calling things \"cute.\"\u00a0 Mommy is cute, Baby Moses is cute, a random baby at the library was cute, animals are cute, etc.\u00a0 And he raises the pitch of his voice when he says it.\n  \u2022 He thinks it's really funny to say that things smell like pepperoni (which sounds extra cute when you can't say the letter R).\n  \u2022 We took him to Lowe's recently, and he is in love.\u00a0 He talks about the \"tool store\" alllllll the time now.\u00a0 The morning after the Lowe's trip, I loaded him in the car to go to Wal-Mart and told him we were going to the store.\u00a0 He excitedly asked, \"Tool store??\u00a0 See jigsaws?\u00a0 Miter saws?\"\n  \u2022 On that same special trip to Lowe's, we bought him a pink sprinkler - an item he dreamed up and has specifically requested for weeks.\u00a0 Apparently our green sprinklers weren't cool enough for him.\u00a0 I didn't even know pink sprinklers existed, so we pretty well had to get it when we saw one for under $3.\u00a0 Maybe someday it will get warm enough to go outside and play with it.\n  \u2022 Have I mentioned before that he is insanely opinionated?\u00a0 And bossy?\u00a0 He will tell you to sit on the floor, and then get upset because he actually wanted you to sit one foot to the left of where you sat.\u00a0 He also tells us frequently, \"No say that!\"\u00a0 I considered it a milestone tonight when he, without being told to ask nicely, said to me, \"No say that, Mommy.\u00a0 Pwease.\"\n  \u2022 He sort of has an imaginary friend?\u00a0 Her name is Goggy (which is all the more bizarre because I had an imaginary friend named Coggy when I was a kid).\u00a0 Goggy started out as a nonsense word that Ben made up to amuse himself.\u00a0 So we might ask, \"Ben, what do you want for breakfast?\"\u00a0 And he would reply, \"Goggy (hysterical laughter)!!\"\u00a0 Somehow over the course of a few weeks, Goggy has morphed into a person that he randomly talks about.\n  \u2022 One of his new favorite play areas is a \"cave\" I made him on our loveseat.\u00a0 The cave is really not that awesome, but crawling in\/out and throwing items in\/out of it entertains him for long stretches.\u00a0 We're talking minutes at a time, people!\u00a0 He also cleans his cave with an ear thermometer, which he calls a \"dust-buster\" (the handle part really does look like a dust-buster -- props to my clever boy on that one).\n\n    Parenting at this stage is quite an adventure.\u00a0 It's more and more fun all the time to see the sweet, cute, witty parts of his personality develop.\u00a0 But I have to get more and more creative to manage the strong-willed, whiney, stinkery parts that are also developing.\u00a0 I complain too often about those latter parts because they sometimes take up a lot of the day, but I honestly LOVE having a toddler.\u00a0 He is a gift that I do not take for granted!\n\nSunday, May 15, 2011\n\n\nOne of the 30 Before 30 items I've been most excited about is paying a surprise visit to my parents.\u00a0 I started realizing, though, that if I waited much longer, I would either have to fly by myself with two kids or pay for an extra plane ticket to make Daniel come with me.\u00a0 So when some of my oldest, dearest friends tried to convince me to pop into central Arkansas at the end of April, I (very, very excitedly) agreed.\n\nme, Rebecca, Whitney, Angela\nThese are my girls :)\u00a0 We try to get together and go to a major-league baseball game at a different park every summer, but two of us didn't stagger our pregnancies very well this year.\u00a0 So we settled for a minor-league game in Little Rock, followed by a little sleepover.\u00a0 We also got to celebrate Whitney's daughter's first birthday and go to a baby shower for Rebecca (who is expecting baby Caroline at the end of June).\u00a0 Have I mentioned that I love these girls?\u00a0 Because I love these girls.\u00a0 I'm beyond thrilled that I got to spend some time with them and celebrate fun things in their lives.\n\nMy girls knew I was coming, but they were just about the only ones.\u00a0 But even with all my secrecy, I didn't quite get to surprise my parents.\u00a0 I knew I would have to call my dad before I got there because I needed a ride from the airport from someone who had a car seat.\u00a0 Then he had to spill the beans to my mom because she kept trying to make plans that interfered with our arrival.\u00a0 So they both knew a few hours before Ben and I landed in Little Rock.\nHis hair was almost this curly the whole trip.\u00a0 That Southern humidity is crazy.\n\nI mentioned here that I was nervous about flying with Ben.\u00a0 I wish I had wasted all those valuable minutes worrying about something else because he did soooo well.\u00a0 I'm still in shock.\u00a0 Everything about flying was the coolest thing he had ever seen.\u00a0 The wings!\u00a0 The machinery (he still talks about \"machine-wee\") inside the wings!\u00a0 All the people!\u00a0 With suitcases!\u00a0 Different colored suitcases with handles!\u00a0 The air conditioner things above our heads!\u00a0 He was hilarious.\u00a0 And never shed a single tear while we were flying (I gave him raisins or jelly beans during take-off and landing, just in case).\u00a0\n\nHe was also pretty excited about seeing Nana, Granddad, and the rest of the familial crew.\u00a0 So excited that he barely slept the entire trip.\u00a0 We never managed to get him to bed on time, and he would wake up around 6am and talk, talk, talk to himself.\u00a0 For at least 30 minutes, non-stop.\u00a0 I guess he had to review all the fun things he had been doing?\u00a0 Who knows.\nA smooch from aunt Mindy (my big brother's wife)\nWe were there Wednesday night through Monday morning, and we squeezed in time with all my siblings, both sets of my grandparents, and a handful of aunts, uncles, and cousins.\u00a0 I can't really remember the last time I went home when it wasn't a holiday, so it felt kind of nice to see everyone without having crazy holiday rushing-around.\u00a0 I'm counting the trip as a success all around.\u00a0 Thanks to all of you who made it possible and made it special!\nCould they BE any cuter?\u00a0 Cale and Jude (big brother's sons), Ben\n\nPS - I did a terrible job of taking pictures (I was having too much fun to bother), so most of these were stolen from my mom.\u00a0 She has more pictures and stories on her own blog here and here.\n\nSunday, May 8, 2011\n\nHe knows me so well.\n\nDaniel took Ben to Target this week and let him pick out a Mother's Day gift for me.\u00a0 According to Daniel's account, Ben understood that he was picking something for Mommy, and he was adamant in his choice.\u00a0 All I can say is, that kid has my tastes pegged:\n\nYou can't tell here, but it has a purple leopard-print design on the other side.\u00a0 It also has a companion cup with a more masculine dog and the message \"King of My Castle.\"\u00a0 After this home run, I think I'm going to let Ben do all our Christmas shopping this year :)\n\nAs excited as I am about that cup, I'm a teensy bit more excited that I've trained Ben to give me \"special kisses\" on command (excuse his pre-nap crankiness, please):\n\nWe are having gorgeous weather here this weekend, and I am maybe a little too excited to wear some of my favorite Spring clothes before I'm too spherical to fit into them.\u00a0 And since I'm rather fond of the dress I wore this morning, I made Daniel take Baby Moses' first official belly picture.\u00a0 Here he\/she is at 19.5 weeks:\n\nI am indescribably thankful for Ben and Baby Mo.\u00a0 They are treasures, and I can hardly believe I get to be their mom.\u00a0 I'm also more and more grateful all the time for my own mom.\u00a0 It's fun to be at a stage of life where I still need her support\/advice\/wisdom\/mothering, but I can also call her just to talk as friends.\u00a0 I can't do my mom justice in a few sentences here, so I'll just sum it up with a big ol' I LOVE MY MOM!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis year on Mother's Day,...

Imagine already trying to keep up being in a country where they speak a whole different language. Not only did I have to learn spanish for everyday life, but I would have the added task of learning the special vocabulary that the Christian community in Argentina uses. As well, I would become aware of the many cultural differences between the Argentine church and the culture of church I grew up in.\n\nThere are many differences and I can't highlight them all in one blogpost. As best as I can, I've tried to bring to life the world of the Argentine church through video, blogs, pics and various forms of social media. One of the biggest differences I notice in the church culture down there is that exclaiming \"OMG\" \"Jesus Christ\" as an expression in daily life isn't considered an insult or taboo the way that it would be in the North American church. If I stubbed my toe and yelled \"FOR CHRIST SAKE\", I might end up with a pep talk about taking Christ name in vain.\n\nMonday, May 21, 2012\n\nFueling Up on Food, Fun & Friendship at Full City Coffee House\n\nSome of the biggest waves ever recorded that have knocked surfers off their surfboards often began with a small breeze of wind causing friction against the calm ocean water. Here in BsAs we've seen just about everything and in many ways we've been here done that. However, every so often someone comes along with an amazing idea that sweeps us off our feet the same way a wave can wipe surfers out.\n\nIt was a day that began just like any other day but the events of the day wound up being anything other than ordinary. I kept hearing a variety of sources rave about Full City Coffee House and how this was one of the best things to ever happen to the food scene down in BsAs.\u00a0 I came expecting to taste just the food but I left the caf\u00e9 that day with something more than just food............friendship :)\n\nMonday, May 14, 2012\n\nSlithering Past those Sneaky Serpents of Stress and Separation\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that some may be out there looking at my life at feeling green with envy. The grass always looks greener on the other side....when you don't see the price the other person has to pay. For me, seeing the world and making friends on other continents is a perk that I wouldn't trade anything int he world for. But this perk has a price that costs more than even the\u00a0costliest ticket to Buenos Aires. And that is the effects of\u00a0separation\u00a0when it comes time to leave. \u00a0What makes\u00a0separation\u00a0even more difficult is when you happen to have someone in particular that actually does not deal well with\u00a0separation.\n\nMonday, May 07, 2012\n\nUntangling the Mysteries of Tango\n\nOne of the best decisions I ever made was to get tangled up in the world of Argentine tango. Not only did I meet people from all walks of life in the lessons and milongas....I gained respect and bragging rights among my peers. This is because most modern day Argentines do not dance tango. In the minds of many of the youth, this is what people their grandparents age do or something that you read about in history books. It's so funny to see the puzzled expressions come to their face when I tell other people my age that I dance tango :O\n\nAmorous Alpacas\n\nAmorous Alpacas",

        "text":"Lesser-Known Georgetown Traditions\n\nLesser Known Traditions\n\nKicking off Homecoming weekend this Friday is Traditions Day 2014, taking place on Copley Lawn. From noon\u00a0to 3 p.m., you\u2019ll be able to enjoy free GUGS burgers, a cappella performances from several groups and (obviously) free T-shirts. More information can be found on the Facebook event, but it\u2019s sure to be an awesome afternoon.\n\nWhile the day is meant to celebrate some of Georgetown\u2019s famous traditions, 4E is here to add some newer, lesser-known traditions that you might not have heard of yet.\n\nThe counter at Epi\u00a0\n\nEveryone know about the tradition of sitting on John Carroll\u2019s lap that every freshman partakes in because that\u2019s been the tradition for years now. With Epi open\u00a024\/7\u00a0you can partake in the\u00a0tradition of sitting on Epi\u2019s counter at 2 a.m. until a cashier inevitably asks you to to get off. Plus, the counter\u00a0has the added benefit of being a little easier to get onto than John Carroll.\n\nThe\u00a0line at Eat & Joy\u00a0\n\nMost recent grads and current juniors and seniors remember the glory of Tuscany, which was put out of business unceremoniously over the summer of 2013. Eat & Joy has stepped up to the plate to fill the void left by Tuscany, and (assuming they don\u2019t also mysteriously go out of business one day soon) they have\u00a0become the newest Georgetown tradition.\n\nThe Healy tunnels\n\nDisclaimer: 4E does not condone trespassing. With construction all over campus (I think I\u2019ve reached my limit for complaining about this), there\u2019s no way to access the Reiss rooftop anymore; the Healy tunnels are just waiting at the heart of campus to be discovered!\n\nThe Hot Chick\n\nDuring practically every tour of Georgetown\u2019s campus and neighborhood, prospective freshmen hear about the Chicken Madness at Wisey\u2019s and how it\u2019s a must-have. In my two years here, though, I have come to largely prefer the Hot Chick for its simplicity and originality. If you haven\u2019t had it yet, you need to get one (or three, and eat them all in one sitting).\n\nWhile you might not have heard of some of these traditions until now, we can guarantee you\u2019ll soon be making them a part of your usual Georgetown tradition routine.\u00a0So, on Friday for Traditions Day and throughout Homecoming Weekend, inaugurate these newfound traditions as an integral part of your Hilltop experience.\n\nGifs: imgur.com; Photo: georgetown.edu\n\nLeave a Reply",
