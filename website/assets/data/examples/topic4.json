In every competitive examination there is a section of Quantitative Aptitude. This section is quite tricky and a difficult one. On the other hand, it contains more marks too. The candidates mostly fail to clear the competitive exams as they are not able to clear the cut-off in this section as it carries more marks than other sections.\n\nIn order to succeed in the competitive exams, the students must try to improve their performance in this section. Quantitative Aptitude is also an important section in the Bank Exams too.\n\nThis article provides tricks for improving the Quantitative Aptitude scores in Competitive Exams.\n\nTips for improving scores in the Quant Section while attempting the Question Paper for different Competitive Exams:\n\n  1. Start with the easier questions- While attempting any questio paper, the candidate must keep in mind that the Quant section is quite difficult and if they start off with the questions that they are not enough confident then they might end up in not answering the full question paper.\n  2. Manage your time properly- As all of us are aware that the time is limited for answering the question paper, thus there is a requirement in order to manage the time sufficiently. If the candidate is unable to do so, then he\/she will not be able to finish the question paper in time.\n\nThis is because the Quant section has\u00a0Math calculations involved and if the candidate takes too much time in solving this section then all other sections will be left behind. So, here the importance of time management arises.\n\n  1. Do not rush- The candidates are advised not to get tensed and anxious in the exam hall. Be calm and try to solve questions. The questions that are difficult to be solved must be kept aside and try to solve those which seems easier.\n\nTips for a Good Preparation of the Quant Section:\n\n  1. Start Practicing Elementary Maths- The questions in the quant section involves mathematics that we might have studied in school. The formulae are also same for the calculations. Therefore, to get a good grip in this section the candidate is required to practice simple and basic maths.\n  2. Practice Mock Papers- In order to have an idea about the questions that are asked in the exams, the need is to practice mock papers and previous years\u2019 question papers. It will help a lot as there are different types of questions that are asked in the exams.\n  3. Memorise Important Formulae and Tables- The different formulae must be memorized by the candidate in order to save time during the examinations. Also, the cube roots and square roots must be learnt so that the calculations can be easily solved.\n\nSo, this was all regarding improving the Quant Scores in Competitive Exams. Hope it was useful.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nWith a degree in Engineering, Saswati Ghosh is a content writer by profession.

They all took to improve what they show of themselves to others with whom they work. They do training for the improvement of the image with specialists, we must recognize that not always successful, but the fact is that concern for the image is in all or almost all. By listening attentively to the voices of teachers never heard worrying about the image. If you listen to the owners of private schools to talk about the image of the school, talking and marquetin is to grow the confidence of parents in this school who run and want to be seen as a company \u2026 (like more the word than the word school.) Achieved with great effort that the school has some pictures supposedly business. Some presentation in the entrance hall, the front of the building, perhaps the children's uniforms, the brochures to promote institution is usually from the business style of designs and formats used.\n\nWhat s happening in the schools attended by poor children in the system? Here the teachers do not speak of the image. Do not listen to say anything about the image of the school or on the image itself. Why? The teachers of poor children do not talk about because they build image image all the time. For even more opinions, read materials from Cyrus Massoumi. They are the image and know it. There will be exceptions, certainly.\n\nUsually, that teacher that looks tired, not having gone through the salon, with a somewhat worn dust, many books in his backpack, in a hurry to make and build, always a free hand to caress a tousled head, always a smile to lift the spirits, with sharp eyes to give confidence to set limits firmly, pleasant voice to comfort, memory to remember qualities and highlight them with words of support and encouragement, is the daily scene of Argentina's poorest schools . No brochures, business undecorated, without thinking too much, because there is no time, only with the passion of every day in the service of education to construct, modify and deconstruct what moves us as a society: knowledge. Knowledge are the defining images of Argentine teachers. The daily actions, even under the most adverse conditions, and build knowledge promoted the image of Argentine teachers, where poverty abounds and children demand attention. Perhaps some time when poverty begins to decrease and worried about the image, that image, that of the brochures, for now the image is carried inside, deep inside. Maybe one day the poverty of students and teachers is less than at present and the heads move to the hairdresser more often, gaurdapolvos and not look as faded uniforms, entrance halls schools more comfortable, the rooms have furniture new computers are latest generation and the images of poverty are transformed into images of greater development and prosperity. If we add to the general welfare passion for .. teach how to give good image to achieve education in Argentina Must we wait too long for it? and if we start now?",

I know we are all always looking for or at least get excited when we learn of free outings for our home schooled children. Well I had a play date scheduled for this past Tuesday because it was winter break in our county so my daughter's school-age friends were out of school and available to come over. I decided not to take winter break along with the school system but we did take a couple of half days and a really awesome field trip! This is what today's post is all about. Our really, really awesome, super fun, free, educational field trip!\n\nThere's a place in south GA called Callaway Gardens. It is really beautiful in the spring and summer months, well, because it is a garden:\n\n\"Open since 1952, Callaway Gardens is the centerpiece of 13,000 acres nestled in the southernmost foothills of the Appalachians.\u00a0 Founder Cason Jewell Callaway longed for a place where man and nature could abide together for the good of both, and now more than half a century later, his retreat continues to offer solace, inspiration and discovery for all who come here.\"\n\nWe, however found out from my friend, that Callaway was offering free admissions! This is of course due to it being winter which is definitely off-peak season for a nature retreat in the South. Well, the dear old people of Callaway Gardens were probably not expecting it to hit 75 degrees during their off-peak season, but opportunistic moms like myself and my friends waited patiently until just such a day come upon us and pounced on the golden opportunity!\nBirds of Prey Show at Callaway Gardens\n\nI called a field trip, packed a lunch, called another homeschooling mom of 5 and we hit the road. Literally. We are not in the closest proximity to Callaway so it was more like a road trip for us but was still well worth it. We watched an awesome Birds of Prey show that included interesting facts about Raptors or wild birds of prey. We learned about the Red Hawk which is one beautiful animal. We also learned about the Horned Owl and a couple of more beautiful birds. We also ducked as these lovely creatures flew ans swooped over the crowed. It was a great experience for the kids! Especially since my friend's kids were coverning birds in their curriculum this past week. We however had just finished covering insects. NO worries though, Callaway had us covered. There's a beautiful butterfly atrium where they breed butterflies and have a number of cocoons and chrysallis on display so that we could observe the different stages of a catepillar turning into a butterfly. Very educational for my two girls. Inside of the atrium though was several species of butterflies fluttering all around. It was magical.\nChelsea in the long sleeve pink tee inside the butterfly atrium and Madison attempting to catch a butterfly!\n\nWe also enjoyed feeding large fish off of a bridge at Discovery Center and seeing all of the different types of flowers beginning to bloom as we walked from station to station.\n\nIn closing...I'd like to say that if you are new to home schooling like me, take this tip for things to do. Think about all types of attractions business whose peak times have passed, pull up their websites and search for free admissions! You're sure to stumble upon something good.\nWe need a better camera!\nChelsea and Madison playing in the fountain inside of the butterfly atrium\n\nI will add pictures of our outing soon...\n\n*What did you do on Winter break or over the weekend? Please feel free to share below!!!\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nShare This\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text":"What happened to higher education?\n\nPublished: December 18, 2013\nThe writer is associate professor in the departments of Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Boston University\n\nThe writer is associate professor in the departments of Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Boston University\n\nThe \u2018Pakistans\u2019 of pre- and post- May 11 have somehow become two separate entities. In pre-May 11 Pakistan, there was a discussion, although at times hollow, but nonetheless a discussion on innovation, research and above all higher education. Most parties had discussed some aspects of higher education in their mandates and promised an increased investment and broad support. In the post-May 11 Pakistan, discussion of higher education, as a tool for nation-building, has all but disappeared from national discourse.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the custodians of higher education. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) is suffering. Without any permanent leadership, its voice has been muted. Worse still, we do not even know if it resides in the federal government or the provinces. The inter-provincial bickering on the future of the HEC is mired with distrust and suspicions and is, perhaps, the only discussion on higher education at the moment in the country. While it remains unclear whether the HEC resides with the federal government or not, higher education certainly does not reside in the hearts of our politicians.\n\nIt would be one thing if the only thing that needed fixing with higher education in Pakistan was the HEC, its leadership and its future home. The problem, unfortunately, is much bigger than that. Pakistan\u2019s crises are much bigger than the sum of blocking Nato supplies and a power shortfall. There are many other problems lurking in the shadows that threaten to deny us a better future. Rampant poverty, an alarming rate of maternal and child mortality, our inability to contain diseases that the rest of the world has been able to eradicate \u2014 all deserve serious and immediate attention. Ironically, many of these are addressed through a better, more informed workforce and a stronger national capacity, which is an outcome of a robust higher education system.\n\nThe current governments, both in the federal capital and in the provinces, have made it clear what their priorities are. Unfortunately, most of them are associated with short-term solutions or sickening political posturing. The long-term investment in our human capital through improved and sustained quality of higher education is not on the agenda.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves some tough questions. The politicians and their favourite media pundits continue to talk about Pakistan\u2019s future and its position in the greater region and the world. Those who are more optimistic also talk about the promise of our youth and the potential of our human capital. Yet, there is little action, if any, to channel these human resources. What more could be a sign of a diseased political system, if the mere discussion of investment in higher education polarises our politicians? Higher education is supposed to be a great equaliser and the grand unifier of all political stripes, the guaranteed ticket for social mobility and a high-return investment for a better future.\n\nWe have somehow convinced ourselves that once we fix our energy and security issues, we can then pay attention to education, health, poverty alleviation, human development and the like. I wish it worked that way. It does not. Firstly, fixing security and energy is not going to happen overnight, irrespective of promises made in pre-election Pakistan. More importantly, governance and planning is more than just about solving one problem; it is about setting the nation on a course for a better tomorrow.\n\nImproving our national capacity, through improved higher education, to solve the challenges of society cannot wait. We may agree or disagree on the role of the HEC in the federal government, but we cannot remain indifferent to the role of higher education in society.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, December 18th, 2013.\n\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n\nFacebook Conversations\n\nReader Comments (8)\n\n  \u2022 Liaqat Shabbir\n    Dec 18, 2013 - 1:15AM\n\n    I have a suspicion that HEC will soon have a new chairman. I think I even know who it is. Former LUMS VC Dr. Adil Najam is back in Islamabad recently and has been seen with Sartaj Aziz and Ahsan Iqbal recently. I hear he had refused the job earlier when he was offered but maybe he will agree this time.\n\n    But secretly I hope he will say no again. He is a real serious scholar and would be too waste to turn a scholar into a babu.\n\n\n  \u2022 Basit\n    Dec 18, 2013 - 2:32AM\n\n    Sir, the problem is that all of us view the problems from our own perspective. You, as a higher educationist, believe that spending funding on university education wil solve most of our problems. I, as associated with secondary education, believe that key to our progress is having an informed public with solid basic education and govt should focus most of its energies on primary and secondary education. Just like in the west, public\u2019s right is up to secondary education and the rest is the topping so to speak. Basic education coupled with work opportunities for the educated unemployed youth is our answer rather than full focus on higher education so that our youth, after getting higher degrees, can fly away just like they have been doing.\n\n\n  \u2022 Rehan\n    Dec 18, 2013 - 2:58AM\n\n    PM has not said anything, anything at all, about higher education even once. Sad! Really sad!\n\n\n  \u2022 x\n    Dec 18, 2013 - 6:13AM\n\n    Namal college\u2019s first batch recently graduated which shows at least one politician is doing his philanthropic work regarding higher education. Also, PTI\u2019s education city in KPK has sparked a lot of interest among foreign universities and this seems to be a very well thought out, promising enterprise. Security situation and law and order will also need to be improved to ensure that the education city remains a center of excellence in learning not marred by security threats or hooligan student political parties.\n\n\n  \u2022 Goraya\n    Dec 18, 2013 - 10:49AM\n\n    Wishful thinking that Prof Najam will take over HEC. I heard him speak last week at sdpi and there was no indication. I am surprised he is still positive on Pakistan after how we have treated him. Leading HEC is just full if disgrace and I dont see him accepting.\n\n\n  \u2022 Ali\n    Dec 18, 2013 - 5:58PM\n\n    Although Prof Najam is well respected in his area of expertise, somebody with a physical sciences\/mathematics\/engineering background needs to take the helm.\n\n    The social sciences will not aid Pakistan\u2019s development in any significant way. They are great if you live in a developed country but in a developing country you will get the best return for your investment by investing in productive disciplines such as engineering etc.\n\n\n  \u2022 Rumormonger\n    Dec 18, 2013 - 8:26PM\n\n    Higher education has seen such an anti-climax in Pakistan. The public sector universities will not see those hey days again I am convinced. No political government will fund higher education through HEC.\n\n\n  \u2022 Dec 18, 2013 - 10:42PM\n\n    Before Higher education there should be a lower education too.Recommend\n\nMore in Opinion",

The primary focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program. at Adams High School. Secondarily, this study will attempt to answer three basic questions:\n\n  1. Can a graduate school social work field instruction program in public school social work on the elementary and secondary levels be evaluated?\n  2. Can an ongoing instrument be developed allowing for evaluation of program and individual instruction?\n  3. Can the study provide analytical data for the program director's evaluation of the effectiveness of his training?\n\nThis study was undertaken by the authors because of an interest in program evaluation as an integral function of professional social work practice. We feel agencies, particularly those financed through public funds are increasingly being pressured to not only quantify, but to qualify program effectiveness. Funding bodies now require evaluative research documenting direction and effectiveness of social programs.\n\nFindings of this study should be of value not only to the funding source and the program director, but also to other students who in the future may wish to conduct similar studies in evaluation of graduate social work field instruction.\n\nThe following chapter discusses the background and development of John Adams High School and the educational climate that made possible the inclusion of this training program as a part of the learning experiences offered. Chapter III deals with the objectives of the training program. Chapter IV examines evaluative research. Chapter V develops the methodology of the research.\n\nThe charts and statistics used are examined in Chapter VI. The data are presented and analyzed in Chapter VII. Summary, conclusions and recommendations are then set forth in the final chapter.\n\n\nA joint project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Social Work, Portland State University.\n\nPersistent Identifier",

Topics covered will include congressional investigations, federal regulatory agency jurisdiction and procedure, and areas of federal criminal law that are most relevant to legal practice in Washington, DC. The seminar's primary focus will be those areas of Washington legal practice in which administrative and regulatory law, federal criminal law, politics, and public relations intersect to create special problems and challenges for attorneys in government and private practice. A \"case study\" approach will be used to analyze these topics from both perspectives, examining the legal obligations and professional responsibilities of both government lawyers and private counsel. Highlights of the course include analysis of the Watergate, ABSCA, Iran-Contra, Whitewater, and Clinton-Lewinsky scandals.",
