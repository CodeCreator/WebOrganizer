        "text":"Teaching How to Read Mathematics\n\nAt this time of year many teachers are picking the calculus book for their class to use next year. At the same time you will find teachers complaining, quite correctly, that their students don\u2019t read their math textbooks. Authors, editors and their focus groups try their very best to make books \u201creadable,\u201d to no avail, since students won\u2019t read them anyway.\n\nMaybe this is because students have never learned to read math books, because no one has ever taught them how. Have you? Here are some thoughts and suggestions gathered from several sources that may help.\n\nFirst, some obvious (to us) comments, which, alas, probably won\u2019t make much of a change in students\u2019 ways:\n\n  \u2022 It takes time to read a math book. Unlike a novel or a non-fiction book, a few pages of mathematics will take longer than reading a story or essay.\n  \u2022 Readers should stop every few lines and make sure they understand what they\u2019ve read\n  \u2022 Readers should have pencil and paper handy both to take notes, to draw graphs, to work through some of the examples.\n  \u2022 Math books contain examples to help the reader understand what\u2019s going on; so readers should work (i.e. with paper and pencil) through the examples.\n  \u2022 Readers should make note of what they don\u2019t understand and ask about it in class.\n\nHere are some things you can do to help your students at all levels learn to read a mathematics textbook. The sooner students learn to read mathematics the better. Work with your pre-Algebra and Algebra 1 teachers (or earlier) to get them started. The sooner the better, but if they have not done it before they get to your calculus class do it then.\n\n  1. Start with short reading assignments and spend some time before and after discussing both what they read and how they read it. Do not do this forever, rather\n  2. Don\u2019t reread the text to them or follow the text exactly in you class discussions; make them responsible for understanding what you\u2019ve assigned them to read. Of course, you should answer questions on anything they didn\u2019t understand, but expect them (eventually) to learn from what they read.\n  3. A brief but structured reading organizer can be a help. Have them make notes on what they read in a form like this:\n    1. In your textbook read section ___.__, \u00a0pages ____ to ____\n    2. What is this section about? What is the main idea?\n    3. There are ____ new definitions (or vocabulary words) in this section. For each, express the definition in your own words, include a drawing if appropriate.\n    4. There are ____ new theorems (rules, laws, formulas) in this section. For each, write its hypothesis and conclusion and explain what it means in your own words, include a sketch if appropriate.\n    5. Which application or example was most interesting or instructive for you? Why?\n    6. Is there anything you find confusing or do not understand in the reading?\n\nThe next day in class meet in groups of 3 or 4 and compare answers: Does everyone in the group agree on the new vocabulary? Which paraphrase is better? Which example\/application was the most interesting? Why? What questions do you still have?\n\nHold the students responsible for doing this work by not repeating what they have just read as a formal lesson on the same material. Approach the material from a different way; probe their understanding with questions.\n\nInstead of a lecture on the material they read, just have a discussion on it. Let the students lead the way explaining what they think the text means, why the examples were chosen, and what they are still unsure of.\n\nIn my next two posts I intend to discuss definitions and theorems in more detail \u2013 their structure and how to help students use the structure to increase their understanding.\n\nThe Electronic Discussion Group or EDG run by the College Board for AP Calculus which has now become the AP Calculus Community is an excellent source of help and information. Some of the ideas here are taken from an EDG discussion on helping students read mathematics textbooks. I\u2019ve also used and expanded ideas from Dixie Ross, Stephanie Sains, Jon Stark, and David Wang that appeared on the EDG. Thanks to them all.\n\n3 thoughts on \u201cTeaching How to Read Mathematics\n\n  1. Mr. Macmillan, I have learned so much from you through your blog. Can you help me further by explaining the scoring statistic of 2012 and 2011 exams. I could not understand why there are more than 6 questions. And which is split in two. If split then how to explain which question has what mean score. My students asked for mean score of let\u2019s say # 4, 2011 FRQ. What would be that. 2.29? Or 2.74? Thank you so much.\n\n    Sonal Patel\n\n\n    \u2022 One of the BC questions (2011 BC 3 listed as questions 3 and 4) contributes to the AB sub-score on the BC exam. Part 3A was part of the AB sub-score, 3A, 3B and 3C all counted to the regular BC score. The means for this question are listed in two parts, one for the AB (called question 3) and the other for the BC only (called question 4). The overall mean for this question is the sum of the parts. (listed as 3 to 4). Questions 4 to 6 were renumbered as 5 to 7.\n      I hope that makes sense.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"How common is it really?\n\nPhoto Credit: Neal Fowler\n\nOne of the most common job seeker complaints\n\nAccording to the AARP, in 2013 alone there were 21,396 claims of age discrimination filed in the US. Most people won't even bother to file, so you have to think the actual number of incidents is much, much higher. Those claims were filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, based on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which \u201cprotects workers 40 and older from personnel decisions based solely on age in hiring, firing, layoffs, promotions or demotions.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Guardian, however, it's not only older people who have reason to be frustrated. The UK Department for Work and Pensions published a report in 2012 saying that \u201cexperiences of age discrimination were more common for younger groups, with under 25s at least twice as likely to have experienced discrimination than other age groups.\u201d\n\n\nFree bonus: The Midlife Job Search Report is a handy guide I compiled for older job seekers. Download it now. gives 2 definitions for ageism:\n\n  1. discrimination against persons of a certain age group.\n  2. a tendency to regard older persons as debilitated, unworthy of attention, or unsuitable for employment.\n\nMost people tend to think of the latter when the topic comes up, but if the UK DWP is right, the first ageism definition should be the more common one and young people are suffering from a double-whammy: not only are they being discriminated against, their claims of discrimination are being discriminated against too. It's ironic that there might be bias among claims of bias.\n\nWhat about you: have you ever felt age discrimination on the job search?\n\nVote now:\n\nHave you ever felt age discrimination on the job search?\n\nQuestion of the article\n\nWhat do you think of the claim that young people might suffer from ageism more than older people?

I like to help people.\n\nThis Post Has 5 Comments\n\n  1. Brian Krueger\n\n    I used to work for a large tech company (which will go unnamed) which used the term \u201cnot a culture fit\u201d as a way to indicate that a candidate was considered to be too old to fit in with the young culture. In my own personal job search, I was once told that I had too much experience for the role. Yes, age discrimination happens.\n\n  2. Jacob Share\n\n    Brian- when you were told that you have \u2018too much experience\u2019 for a role, how much experience did you have relative to what was required by the job description?\n\n  3. Brian Krueger\n\n    I had, at the time, about 20 years experience (yes, that put me over 40) and the role was asking for 5-10 years of experience. Normally most employers would be thrilled to hire a more experienced candidate, but in this case, the employer clearly wanted a younger candidate. Like most situations of this type, it worked out well in the end. I ended up in a better role at a better company.\n\n  4. Steve Brady\n\n    As a professional resume\/LinkedIn profile writer I know first hand how ageism is a problem for both older and younger job seekers alike.\n\n    The key for each group is to zero in on what the employer really needs and to place a laser focus on that throughout all of your career building materials.\n\n  5. Jacob Share\n\n    Brian- to be blunt: you shouldn\u2019t have applied for that job, and like so many job seekers, you set yourself up for a fall. Steve nailed it; laser focus on employer needs is where it needs to start.\n\n    For others (Brian knows this already): although heavily abused, over-qualification is a real thing. If I advertise needing a car to get from A to B, and someone cold calls me about their Ferrari, they really shouldn\u2019t be surprised when I tell them it\u2019s not what I need.\n\nLeave a Reply to Brian Krueger Cancel reply",
