Previously, Tom was Vice-President of Market Development at Speakeasy (now Megapath), a leading provider of small business VoIP and data services. After joining the company in 2003, Tom helped Speakeasy transition from a consumer-focused ISP into a nationally-recognized small business communications leader. Tom and his team implemented an inbound marketing system that helped grow sales from $50 million in 2003 to $100 million in 2008. Additionally, Tom played a role in several key transactions and partnerships. These included Best Buy\u2019s 2006 acquisition of the company, a co-marketing agreement with VA Software (Slashdot.org), and a wireless network divestiture to TowerStream, the largest such transaction in the company\u2019s history. Prior to this, Tom worked for Visto Corporation (now Good Technology), negotiating private-label software distribution agreements with leading wireless carriers in North America and Asia. Tom previously held multiple positions in sales, consulting, and product management with Concur and Semaphore Corporation. Tom holds a Masters in Business Administration and two B.A. degrees from the University of Washington. In his spare time Tom enjoys yoga, running, snowshoeing, and driving his Eurovan along the Northwest coast for outings with Seattle-based Surfers, a meetup.com group he started in 2013.\n\nWe collaborate with people who have experience and\/or certifications in the following categories:\n\nMarketing Automation \u00a0\u2013 e.g., Hubspot, Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, Net-Results\n\nCRM \u00a0\u2013 e.g., Salesforce.com, Sugar CRM, Microsoft Dynamics\n\nSEO\/SEM \u00a0\u2013 e.g., Moz PRO tools, Google Analytics,\u00a0Google AdWords, and Microsoft AdCenter\n\nSocial Media Monitoring \u00a0\u2013 e.g., HootSuite Pro, Radian6, Sysomos\n\nWe also maintain a network of graphic designers, HTML\/CSS coders, copywriters, and audio\/video production experts.\n\nSend your resume or LinkedIn profile URL to info@falconrygroup.com.\n\nAs our business expands, we\u2019re looking for proven, scalable strategies for growing revenue. On a colleague\u2019s recommendation, we hired Tom to educate our leadership team on current marketing and sales best practices. We liked how Tom managed our time, and we learned a lot. Instead of speaking in abstract marketing buzzwords, he engaged us in plain business English. Rather than pitching solutions to problems we don\u2019t have, he shared real-world case studies and then answered our questions. This helped us apply the concepts to the business we\u2019re now building. Hiring Tom was a good investment. I\u2019m pleased to recommend him.\n\nPresident, Corporate Real Estate Management Firm\n\nTom's sales background, combined with his creativity, intellect, and entrepreneurial drive make him a highly effective marketing leader. Tom has a keen understanding of sales and marketing metrics. He is analytical and results-focused, but places a high value on relationships. It was clear that individuals at all levels of the organization enjoyed working with and for Tom. From a partner perspective, he was demanding but always open and fair. It comes as no surprise that he has chosen to pursue the opportunity to build a small business, and with Tom\u2019s integrity, work ethic, and relentless passion for customer value I\u2019m confident it will be a huge success!\n\nReferral Partner\n\nTom has been a great manager and mentor. Not only did he provide the guidance needed to fulfill my responsibilities, he also provided great opportunities for me to demonstrate my skills and abilities and expand my role.\n\nJunior Marketer\n\nTom is a fun guy to work with and a great guy to know. He provided thought leadership, structure, and results in every assignment he took.\n\nVP Marketing, Software Firm\n\nTom has consistently demonstrated strong analytical skills in solving market development problems and highlighting customer insights, and he developed clear strategies to resolve these challenges. Tom is a great asset for any organization seeking to better understand its marketing and sales options and keep an eye on its customer acquisition costs.\n\nVP Product, Telecom Firm\n\nTom lives up to his name as 'The Lord of the Leads'. I collaborated with Tom on a project for one of my medical device clients that involved developing several different demand generation ideas and programs in a very short amount of time. He is extremely knowledgeable, listens to client feedback and hits the mark delivering quality content. I would certainly work with Tom again.\n\nPresident, Healthcare Consulting Firm\n\nWhat a pleasure it was to work with Tom. I was consistently impressed with Tom's ability to articulate a clear connection between marketing program expenditures and both expected and actual returns. He was completely willing and able to hold himself and his team accountable for results over time, constantly adjusting tactics, identifying trends and leading indicators, confident in what he knew and also clear as to what was not yet knowable. As a plus, I found Tom to be personable and approachable. It was great to have him on the team and I would appreciate the opportunity to work with him again in another setting.\n\nCFO, Telecom Firm\n\nTom is a consummate professional. Solid, articulate, professional, polite, appropriately pushes back when necessary. Tom gets along with everyone. He builds relationships and keeps the balance on the professional side, certainly with clients. I have a bird\u2019s eye view of what he\u2019s up to. He has strong relationships with everyone he interacts with. The one thing that you get with Tom that you can\u2019t get anywhere else: you get to the meat of the matter. He\u2019s very good at finding a different perspective. Five words to describe Tom: Consummate professional, smart, insightful, easy to work with and valuable.\n\nVP of Sales, Business Media Firm\n\n\n\nShare and Enjoy",
