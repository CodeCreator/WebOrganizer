        "text":"Adios A&amp;N: Clothing store leaves Mall\n\n\nBefore Christmas, it was business as usual at the A&N store on the Downtown Mall. Some of its narrow aisles were impassable, crowded with bulky parkas and flight jackets; others were blocked with boxes.\n\nAfter the holidays, seemingly without warning, the discount sportswear retailer sold its last Nikes December 31 and papered over its windows.\n\n\"All good things come to an end,\" says Ron Britt, operations manager for the 52-store, 137-year-old Richmond-based chain. Having new A&N stores at Seminole Square and Pantops, \"really was enough to cover Charlottesville,\" he says.\n\nAnd the Downtown Mall is \"a little rough for a retailer,\" Britt points out. Besides lower sales, the store at the corner of East Main and 5th Street SE, which had been there since Britt started with A&N 35 years ago, had no back door, he says. The 100 to 150 boxes the store got each week had to be unloaded on Water Street and hiked up a block and a half to the store's front door. \"It was pretty tough on employees,\" he says.\n\nThose employees will be transferred to the two other stores. But downtown residents who shopped at A&N now have fewer nearby shopping options.\n\n\"I can't think of another store on the Downtown Mall with such a broad appeal and such affordable prices,\" says Antics owner\/ inveterate bargain hunter Amy Lemley, who liked the store's funky-style accessories along with its basic wear. \"Everyday I would see mothers and children, high school-age people, and other shoppers headed there,\" she says.\n\nAnd the store filled a need for residents without cars who needed staples\u2013 a need that will not be filled by the entertainment-destination kind of businesses and boutiques populating the Mall. \"You don't say, 'I need some socks and underwear\u2013 let's go to the Downtown Mall,'\" says Lemley.\n\nAubrey Watts, Charlottesville director of economic development, would like to continue to see a variety of retail options downtown, but says that A&N's passing is \"part of the orderly, economic redevelopment of downtown.\" When a new business comes in and refurbishes a property, it becomes more valuable. He cites Woolworth's transformation from five and dime to upscale paper purveyor Caspari.\n\n\"I think that's healthy,\" says Watts. \"Worse would be to see it boarded up and sitting empty.\"\n\nLandlord Gabe Silverman, for one, will miss A&N, where he bought all his Levis and sneakers. \"I liked it for what it sold\u2013 not food, not fru-fru,\" he says. \"If CVS were to go, that's the last place for the average person to shop.\"\n\nHe expects no problems finding a new tenant for the one-story, circa 1920 store. \"Lots of people are lined up to rent or buy,\" Silverman says.\n\n\"It'll probably be another stupid restaurant,\" he predicts.\n\nWhere are you going to find bargain apparel on the Downtown Mall now that A&N has headed for the 'burbs? The athletic store closed its doors New Year's Eve.",

        "text":"Paris fashion week faces a dilemma\n\nDo designers embrace the exhuberant trends that swept through New York, London and Milan or stick with a minimal aesthetic?\nDries van Noten\nA model wears a creation designed by Belgium's Dries van Noten for his ready to wear spring\/summer 2011 collection in Paris. Photograph: Christophe Ena\/AP\n\nParis fashion week, which began on Tuesday, faces a dilemma: stick with the minimalist aesthetic championed last season, and risk looking outdated. Or embrace the exuberant 1970s trend that has swept New York, London and Milan fashion weeks, and look derivative.\n\nAs outdated and derivative are to fashion what rocks and hard places are to the wider world, this is not an enviable position.\n\nSix months ago in Paris, C\u00e9line and Stella McCartney were at the forefront of a return to minimalism. But now, with those clothes newly available in boutiques, fashion in New York, London and Milan has already moved away from minimalism in shade and shape, towards bold colour and print, peplums and flared trousers.\n\nMilan, which six months ago found its schedule shortened and its importance sidelined, has had rave reviews for last week's shows. Even after the fashion industry moved on to Paris yesterday, Italian fashion seemed reluctant to relinquish the limelight. Roberto Cavalli took centre stage in Paris with a gala dinner for 800 to celebrate his 40th anniversary in fashion \u2013 held in the grand halls of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, the left bank alma mater of Degas, Fragonard, Ingres and Monet.\n\nParis's situation is emblematic of how the fast pace dictated by the internet is rewriting the archaic rules of the fashion industry. Live streaming of catwalk shows and the rise of a generation of fashion bloggers have forged a direct connection between catwalk and customer, a relationship strengthened by booming online coverage. In the US, Conde Nast has funded a heavyweight relaunch of competing against its only site, suggesting that the magazine company is investing in an online future. As a result, the genteel rhythms of glossy magazines have been steamrolled in favour of a voracious appetite for the new.\n\nThe dramatic about-turn now happening in fashion may encourage more labels to follow the example of Burberry, which now allows customers to \"click and buy\" direct from the runway, thus sidestepping the concern that the clothes will be out of fashion by the time they hit stores several months later.\n\nThe first day of Paris shows offered little clue as to whether the city would stick or twist. Dries Van Noten, the first big show of the week, had moved locations from a grand, gilded salon to a chilly, dusty concrete strip next to the Seine and the show began in distinctly stripped-back style \u2013 starting with an outsize black cotton blazer over a simple white cotton skirt. But the mood lightened with silk dresses in sky blue and plaster pink, painted with Japanese-style florals: intricate crysanthemums in intense colours, blossom on delicate branches, and sculptural orchids. These were summer dresses perfectly judged to please his grown-up, slightly cerebral customer. But as that customer is not much swayed by trends, it did not serve as a weather vane.\n\nBritish design talent is increasingly dominant in Paris fashion. To the stellar names already on the schedule \u2013 McCartney, John Galliano (at Christian Dior), Phoebe Philo (at C\u00e9line), Hannah MacGibbon (at Chloe) and Stuart Vevers (at Loewe) are added the debuts of Giles Deacon at Emanuel Ungaro, and Sarah Burton, who after 12 years in the Alexander McQueen studio was appointed head designer after his death.",

        "text":"\nMake us your home page\n\nIt's healthy to give your nails a bit of a breather\n\n\nSpecial to the Washington Post.\n\nI grew up in New Jersey, often stereotyped as the land of big hair and long nails. I have been getting regular manicures and pedicures for as long as I can remember without ever worrying about the potential hazards of these little indulgences. That is, until a friend recently proved those urban legends true by contracting a nasty fungal infection after having her toes painted \u2014 and at a high-end spa, to boot!\n\n\"In general, today's nail cosmetics and nail salons are quite safe,\" says New York dermatologist Richard Scher, a professor emeritus at Columbia University. \"However, there is a small risk of adverse effects that are not incredibly common but are something that people should be aware of.\"\n\nTo start, he cites the potential for allergic reactions to chemicals, including formaldehyde and acetone, that are found in some nail products. And you can't always trust labels: Last month, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control released a small study showing that several \"toxic free\" polishes actually contained one or more chemicals that have been linked to cancer and birth defects.\n\nScher also urges caution with gel manicures, which are cured under a UV light and removed with acetone. In addition to possible skin damage to hands from repeated exposure to the UV lights that cure the polish, Scher warns that acetone can cause itching, dryness and flaking or peeling skin.\n\nWashington dermatologist Ella Tombs contends that these treatments use only small amounts of UV light for short periods and don't pose a real health risk. She worries more about technicians who scrub too vigorously underneath your nails or push back cuticles too far, both of which can cause injury and allow bacterial or fungal infection.\n\n\"You don't want people to cut or clip your cuticles at all, since it can traumatize and damage them and open you up to an infection,\" she adds, noting that cuticles serve as a skin barrier to germs.\n\nWhat precautions should someone getting a manicure or pedicure take before heading off to the salon? First and foremost, it's important to bring your own instruments - such as clippers, nail files and pumice stones - to avoid picking up germs from another client, says Washington podiatrist Erika Schwartz: \"If salon employees are just dipping their instruments in some kind of solution, that's not going to kill bacteria and fungus,\" she advises. \"They should be using an autoclave, a type of machine for sterilizing instruments.\"\n\nWith flip-flop season under way, the American Podiatric Medical Association offers these additional tips regarding pedicures:\n\n\u2022 Schedule your appointment first thing in the morning, when foot baths are typically cleanest. If you're not a morning person, make sure that the salon filters and cleans the foot bath between clients using bleach and other disinfectants.\n\n\u2022 Resist the urge to shave your legs before receiving a pedicure. Freshly shaven legs or small cuts on your legs may allow bacteria to enter.\n\n\u2022 While it's okay to use a pumice stone, foot file or exfoliating scrub to remove calluses or dead skin on your feet, avoid foot razors. These tools can do permanent damage if used incorrectly and easily cause infection if too much skin is removed.\n\n\u2022 Don't round the edges of your toenails. This type of shape increases the chances that painful ingrown toenails will develop.\n\n\u2022 Finally, it can be worthwhile to give your nails a break from the latest and greatest shade of polish every now and again \u2014 this is especially so for the toes.\n\n\"People like to have pedicures done straight through the summer or even all year long, but the problem with that is nails don't get an opportunity to breathe,\" says Washington podiatrist Howard Osterman, who notes that chemicals in nail polish can eat away at the top layer of toenails, resulting in changes in color or texture that may or may not be a sign of a true medical issue. \"Fungus grows in dark, moist environments, so anything that doesn't let air dry it out \u2013 such as nail polish \u2013 can allow fungus to (grow) underneath,\" he explains, noting that clear nail polish isn't any better than colored, since it's the enamel itself that's the problem.\n\nOsterman points out that pretty hues can also mask infections, skin cancer and other medical problems, and he suggests at the very least changing your polish frequently, so you can keep a close eye on the state of your nails.\n\nIt's healthy to give your nails a bit of a breather 05\/18\/12 [Last modified: Friday, May 18, 2012 4:30am]\nPhoto reprints | Article reprints\n\n\nJoin the discussion: Click to view comments, add yours",

In what is widely being considered a step in the right direction, LVMH and Kering, who between them own Gucci, Saint Laurent, Vuitton et Dior, will stop using size zero (UK size four) models.\n\nThey have unveiled a charter \u201cto ensure the wellbeing of models\u201d which will also ban the use of girls under the age of 16 for photoshoots or fashion shows where they\u2019d be representing adults. On the eve of the start of New York Fashion Week, it was announced that these new measures were being taken to look after models. However, the companies are also addressing criticism they\u2019ve faced that the fashion industry encourages anorexia and eating disorders. What\u2019s more, last Paris Fashion Week in February, the working conditions of models came under intense scrutiny.\n\nCEO of Kering, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, has said that the company would like to move quickly and react strongly so that things really change. He added that he hopes others in the industry will follow. Antoine Arnault, a member of the LVMH board of directors and son of CEO Bernard Arnault, says the charter will \u201cchange things completely.\u201d Earlier this year, France banned the use of unhealthily thin models as part of a new law targeting \u201cunrealistic body images\u201d and eating disorders. Models are now required to provide a doctor\u2019s certificate attesting to their overall health and proving their body mass index (BMI) sits within a healthy range in order to work. What\u2019s more, French magazines are legally obliged to indicate when a photo of a model has been retouched or photoshopped, or else they face a \u20ac37,500 ((\u00a334340.62) fine.\n\nThis is despite the fact that two years ago, then Vogue UK editor Alexandra Shulman spoke out to say she does not believe using skinny models encourages eating disorders in girls or gives them body confidence issues. But it\u2019s safe to say the move by LVMH and Kering has been widely met with praise. \u201cOther fashion houses must start following suit,\u201d one person reacted on Twitter. \u201cA deadly, disgusting trend that has no place in fashion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Independent\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nBe the First to Comment!\n\nNotify of",

        "text":"Chanel attacked for felling trees for Paris fashion show\n\n\nPARIS (AFP) -\u00a0Karl Lagerfeld created a spectacular mid-winter wood for his Paris catwalk on Tuesday (March 6), but immediately fell foul of environmental activists who accused him of felling century-old trees for the show.\n\nThe veteran German creator turned the Grand Palais into a forest, with tonnes of dead leaves strewn on mirrored steps and nine tall mossy trees planted down the middle of its vast nave.\n\nTrees had also been chopped down for the rows of benches for his guests, including Hollywood star Keira Knightley, British pop singer Lily Allen and former French first lady Carla Bruni Sarkozy.\n\nThe France Nature Environment group later condemned the show as \u201cheresy\u201d, accusing the luxury brand of trying to \u201cgive itself a more green image which is completely divorced from the reality of protecting nature.\u201d\n\nIt said that whatever point Chanel was trying to prove with the show \u201chad failed.\n\nNature is not chopping down trees in a forest, putting them up for a few hours for a show and then throwing them into a skip.\u201d\n\nThe brand \u2013 whose PVC-themed collection last year raised eyebrows at a time when plastic pollution is hitting the headlines \u2013 should be \u201csetting an example\u201d, the group said in a statement.\n\n\nFashion critics, however, had praised the set, with Harper\u2019s Bazaar declaring that the \u201crunway may be (Lagerfeld\u2019s) best yet\u201d. It loved the \u201clife-like forest\u201d he conjured up that \u201cseemed to extend infinitely\u201d.\n\nThe 84-year-old creator had sent out a dark and classy collection Tuesday that eschewed the bubblegum girliness of Chanel\u2019s haute couture show in January.\n\nThe few pinks and electric blues he allowed to seep into the show were confined to handbags and the very Audrey Hepburn leather opera gloves worn with a series of black lace slip dresses.\n\nThe final Lagerfeld touch was that the gloves, like his own, were fingerless.\n\nWith his controversial wispy beard that so divided opinion at January\u2019s fuller now, the \u201cKaiser\u201d took one of the briefest bows of his career after the show, allowing photographers little chance to check its progress.\n\nSome critics had then found it shockingly \u201cscruffy\u201d for the world\u2019s pre-eminent style guru, who had not changed his look in two decades.\n\nLagerfeld began the show with a run of full-length black coats matched with sparkling gold tights, one coat feathered at the shoulders and cuffs which gave it more than a hint of French Empire dash.\n\n\nEarthy, autumnal colours dominated, lit up with the glint of embroidered crystals and glitter, as he ran through the gamut of Chanel\u2019s classic tweedy looks \u2013 city slickers bringing a touch of ever-so-tasteful glamour to the horsey country set.\n\nThe whole top of one particularly striking coat with burnt orange velvet collars and cuffs was covered in a fall of delicate applique dark green and burnished gold leaves.\n\nThis was not the gold of the nouveau riche but the distressed sheen of old money.\n\nThe veteran picked up and ran with its mottled glow in a line of darkly burnished gold and copper boots, suits and skirts.\n\nFront-row stars including French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis drooled over Lagerfeld\u2019s new big bags and accessories. They included a \u201clog\u201d handbag so close to the real thing you might risk losing it in the woods.\n\nChanel\u2019s trademark long, pearl necklaces also made a reappearance, with former supermodel Cindy Crawford\u2019s 16-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber wearing earrings featuring the brand\u2019s double C logo.\n\nSouth Korean star Hoyeon Jung and British model activist Adwoa Aboah also walked in the 80-look show.",
