        "text":"Log Out | Member Center\n\n\n\nGluten-free beauty products in demand among some customers\n\n  \u2022 Los Angeles Times\n  \u2022 Published Monday, April 21, 2014, at 12 a.m.\n\n\nAmy Soergel\u2019s lip gloss was making her sick. The problem, she realized, was gluten \u2013 hydrologized wheat protein, to be exact. Then she went to the hairdresser who used a shampoo that made her neck burn. Again, it contained gluten.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s hidden gluten in many places you may not consider,\u201d including stamp and envelope glues, toothpaste and lip balms, said Soergel, who has a store, Naturally Soergel\u2019s, near Pittsburgh that caters to people with allergies. Indeed, for people with celiac disease, a bit of gluten that might get swallowed from a lipstick or a stream of shampoo in the shower can be enough to cause illness.\n\nA slew of gluten-free skin care products have come on the market, including items from well-known companies such as Murad, Dr. Hauschka, EO, MyChelle, Suntegrity, Acure and derma-e. Many are sold in Whole Foods and other health food stores. If they\u2019ve been certified by a third-party agency, an icon usually appears on the packaging.\n\nAvalon Organics and Jason \u2013 two moderately priced health food store standards from the company Hain Celestial \u2013 recently released Avalon Organics Gluten Free Cucumber products and Jason gluten-free lotions, washes and hair products.\n\nEmma Froelich-Shea, the company senior vice president of marketing and research and development, says she was skeptical at first that such products were needed, thinking gluten \u2013 which is found in wheat, barley and rye \u2013 was only a food issue. But wheat protein is used as a binding agent for skin-firming creams and hair products that aim to strengthen hair, she says \u2013 and she was won over by customer demand.\n\nBob Zahradnik launched Coldstream Natural from Gainesville, Fla., about six months ago, selling gluten-free tooth creams and mouthwashes. \u201cAny trace materials in oral care products will definitely present a risk to people with a gluten sensitivity,\u201d Zahradnik said.\n\nCustomers of derma-e, a 30-year-old company that started with a vitamin E cream, prompted the company to change, says Jennifer Norman, the vice president for marketing. Most of its products had no gluten, and the company reformulated the rest. \u201cIt shows the amount consumers are researching products. In the last year, it\u2019s been almost an explosion of interest in gluten-free,\u201d Norman says.\n\nThe Whole Foods 365 house brand recently released a line of gluten-free bubble baths. Tilth Beauty, a year-old line of 14 products that includes anti-aging serums and moisture creams, contains no gluten, and no synthetic coloring or fragrances, genetically modified ingredients or petroleum-based products.\n\nDermatologist Jenny Kim, associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of California-Los Angeles\u2019s David Geffen School of Medicine, says some people thought that gluten-free skin care was simply a trend, in part because gluten molecules are too large to penetrate through skin. But that\u2019s only true for skin that\u2019s healthy and intact, and not necessarily for people with eczema or other skin conditions.\n\n\u201cSo we don\u2019t really know how the molecule is going through the skin, but certainly that needs to be studied,\u201d Kim said. Reactions, including rashes and respiratory problems, have been documented.\n\nClaire Duggan, one of the three sisters behind the LifeStinks brand of deodorants, says their motive was to help heal one sister after years of illness. They studied natural healing and eventually came up with a deodorant formula that they offered to share with clients, Duggan said.\n\n\u201cNo one cared that I could teach them how to make it. They said, \u2018If you make it for me, I'll buy it,'\u201d she adds. That led to LifeStinks, a powder deodorant in lavender or cedar wood scent that is made in their basement and is available online and in some health food stores.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into it to be gluten-free,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cBut, boy, have we found it has so mattered to our customers.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\nThe Wichita Eagle welcomes your comments on news of the day.

She's magnetic on the screen, of course, but she's also a beauty jack-of-all-trades. Lawrence has a fearlessness when it comes to her hair that we really admire. She's game to try everything at least once. Brown hair! Platinum blond! Curly locks! The lob!\n\nThat last style has been Lawrence's signature for months, and she wears it beautifully. But Lawrence is a chameleon, which is why we weren't surprised to see a brand new hairstyle on her at recent event for her film, Passengers. She swapped her legacy blunt locks for something, well, longer. Some might say she's giving off Victoria's Secret vibes. (Read: We're saying it.)\n\nShe looks awesome. For this particular event, the Oscar winner styled her longer locks with loose, easy curls. The result? So much slayage. See Lawrence's new hair for yourself in the picture, below:\n\nPHOTO: Europa Press via Getty Images\n\nWhere are the Victoria's Secret vibes, you ask? Well, the Angels have a history of sporting long, free-flowing hairstyles on the runway, and Lawrence's new tresses match that aesthetic to a tee. (Although, we're excited to see the lingerie brand is finally expanding its definition of \"sexy\" hair\u2014at least 6 different models walked with short hair; three of which with natural afro-textured hair.) If we hadn't been at the filming and backstage before the show, we'd swear she was gearing up to hit the runway.\n\nIt's got all the airy movement of an Angel, see:\n\nPHOTO: Getty Images\n\nIt's important to note that this all isn't Lawrence's real hair. Like we said, she's been \"lobbing\" it up for weeks, so this new style is the result of some pretty amazing extensions. (Refinery29 reports it's the handiwork of L.A. salon Nine Zero One's Riawna Capri and Nikki Lee, who only use bonded Great Lengths extensions at the salon.) There's definitely an art form to successfully pulling off extensions, and Lawrence nails it\u2014both here and with this Elsa braid she wore yesterday.\n\nI mean, look at that magnificence.\n\nPHOTO: WireImage\nPHOTO: WireImage\n\nIf you're interested, peep this handy-dandy extensions guide to learn the tricks of the trade.\n\nExcuse me while I call my hairstylist to see if I can pull off this blond hair.

With the help of their mothers, they learned why they should\u00a0embrace and celebrate\u00a0their natural hair textures.\u00a0\n\nNow Dove has pursued another\u00a0way to get young girls of all backgrounds\u00a0feeling confident.\u00a0\n\nThey partnered with bestselling author Taiye Selasi\u00a0to create a children's book \"Love Your Curls\" featuring poems and short stories aimed to inspire appreciation for one's curly hair texture, The Huffington Post reported.\n\nIn the interview with Huffpost Black Voices, Selasi reflected feeling self-conscious of\u00a0her natural hair texture as a young girl. At the time, she didn't think society considered her hair to be beautiful. She described feeling a\u00a0shift for the better when artists like\u00a0Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu made their debuts while\u00a0embracing\u00a0natural hairstyles.\u00a0She used her experience to help shape the purpose and mission for her book.\u00a0\n\n\"It was a journey \u2013 one that I hope that little girls can take faster than I was able to,\" Selasi told HuffPost.\u00a0\n\nSelasi's experience can particularly\u00a0be identified with many other\u00a0women of the African diaspora.\u00a0\n\nThere has been a boom in recent years of\u00a0natural hair blogs\u00a0and YouTube channels celebrating natural hair for women of color, but one book in particular takes on the natural hair conversation and puts it in the context of history.\n\n\"Hair Story: Untangling The Roots of Black Hair In America,\" written by Ayana D.\u00a0Byrd and Lori L.\u00a0Tharps, addresses how in the early 1900s, Black people had to take on Eurocentric characteristics to attain the \"American dream.\" Natural kinky hair, for\u00a0example, was suggesting undesirable characteristics that went\u00a0against the \"status quo.\"\n\nDove and Selasi want to bring people of all races, cultures\u00a0and experiences\u00a0together to celebrate their curly hair and to appreciate its beauty.\u00a0\n\nSelasi's\u00a0\"Love Your Curls\" is available for download. \u00a0\n\nCheck out Selasi's interview with HuffPost below:",

We thought wrong. Today on Instagram, the singer debuted a brand new pastel hair color, a fresh minty green hue on the tips of his extreme fade 'do.\n\nMalik's dabbled with green hair before. Back in 2015, the \"Still Got Time\" crooner treated his short buzz cut to a Joker-level lime green dye job that bordered on punk (well, as close as a rebellious onetime boyband-er can get to punk). This new iteration of green-hued hair reads less severe (as far as Instagram Story evidence goes) with what appears to be an ombre situation into his natural, dark hair color.\n\nCan Malik make green tips a legit grooming move among adults (Jared Leto aside)? We'll have to wait and see. It could be the next wave rebel style hair moves now that the bleached buzz has hit critical mass. But if any man can influence the menswear world's hair trends, it's Zayn Malik.\n\nWatch Now:\n\nRoger Federer Shows You How to Dress for a Snow Day",

The Indianapolis natives have been friends for years and began working professionally together when Leppert brought Larkins\u2019s jewelry line into G. Thrapp Jewelers, where she worked.\n\nIn 2016, the friends opened their first jewelry store together, Metalmark Fine Jewelry, in Denver, Colo., where Larkins lives. The women then decided it was time to open a location closer to their hometown and settled on Carmel, opening a shop at 211 W. Main St. in Oct. 2017.\n\nFrom left, Samantha Hurst Larkins and Mary Leppert recently opened Metalmark Fine Jewelry store in Carmel. (Submitted photo)\n\n\u201cIt took us a while to find a place,\u201d Larkins said. \u201cOur broker said we should go check out what\u2019s going on up on Main Street in Carmel. We drove up there and I thought it was amazing. We checked out the space and pretty much signed on the dotted line.\u201d\n\nMetalmark specializes in eclectic jewelry not found in typical jewelry stores.\n\n\u201cThe range of the jewelry is completely individualized,\u201d Larkins said. \u201cYou could buy a $90 leather bracelet or a $10,000 pair of diamond studs. We\u2019re trying to empower our guests to find something they love. We\u2019re passionate about our jewelry, and we would wear it ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe space was designed with guests\u2019 comfort in mind.\n\n\u201cThe space in Carmel is totally different,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cWe have a kitchen island right in the middle. We wanted people to feel like they\u2019re in someone\u2019s home so that they could just come over and sit down at the island with a glass of wine or just sit and talk about jewelry.\u201d\n\nBoth women have degrees from the Gemological Institute of America. Larkins creates custom-made pieces by request.\n\n\u201cWe want our clients to feel like they\u2019re part of a family,\u201d Larkins said. \u201cWe want them to stay and linger over the jewelry.

They are spitting on our culture, and it\u2019s upsetting.\u201d\n\nHistorically, each feather placed on a headdress has spiritual significance\nand would have to be earned through an act of compassion or bravery.\n\nKarlie Kloss wearing an Indian headdress during the taping of The 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show\n\n\nFollowing a barrage of complaints, the fashion house has now agreed not to\ninclude the traditional garb in any future marketing materials or catwalks.\n\nKloss later posted on Twitter that she was \u201cdeeply sorry if what I wore during\nthe VS Show offended anyone.\u201d\n\nA Victoria\u2019s Secret spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry that the Native American\nheaddress replica used in our recent fashion show has upset individuals.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologize as we absolutely had no intention to offend anyone.\n\n\u201cOut of respect, we will not be including the outfit in any broadcast,\nmarketing materials nor in any other way.\u201d\n\nkloss tweet\n\n\nSome Native Americans slammed the company\u2019s short apology, with one saying it\nsounded like \u201can automated response\u201d.\n\nThousands have commented on the outfit on the company\u2019s Facebook page, with\none commenting: \u201cMy way of life is not a fashion statement.\u201d\n\nBut while many have condemned it, others praised Kloss\u2019s attire as artistic,\nurging those offended to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Victoria\u2019s Secret stir follows a string of similar incidents.

(Photo by Vianney Le Caer\/Invision\/AP)\n\nThis is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Armed with a battalion of celebrity ambassadors, L\u2019Or\u00e9al took over the historic Paris Mint building to stage a Paris Fashion Week extravaganza. Offerings from Elie Saab, who went 1970s, and Vivienne Westwood, who stylishly towed a line between ethnic and punk, made for a frenetic pace of shows on Saturday.\n\nHere are some highlights of the day\u2019s Spring-Summer 2020 ready-to-wear displays:\n\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s celebrated female empowerment at its third fashion show, which featured actresses Helen Mirren, Andie MacDowell and Eva Longoria giving turns as models and was broadcast to over 40 countries.\n\nThe French cosmetic giant\u2019s display still was less ambitious than last year\u2019s edition, which took place on the Seine River, or the one staged in the center of the Champs-Elysees that literally stopped traffic in 2017.\n\nNonetheless, Mirren, Longoria, MacDowell and Dutch model Doutzen Kroes energized spectators at the evening show, joining Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello, Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and American model-actress Amber Heard and others to showcase a collection of carefully crafted looks.\n\nWhatever the styles lacked in unity \u2014 they harked from diverse design houses that included AMI, Balmain, Dries Van Noten, Elie Saab and Giambattista Valli \u2014 they made up in razzmatazz.\n\nA strong-shouldered tuxedo mixed with a 70s jabot collar shirt on Mirren and contrasted with more feminine styles, such as a trapeze-shaped, shoulder-less coral gown or the dazzling pearl-hued ruched number Longoria wore.\n\nThe L\u2019Or\u00e9al brand\u2019s cachet in makeup could not go unnoticed. Kroes and other models were made to look nymph-like, thanks to makeup director Val Garland and hair baron Stephane Lancien.\n\nPetite Cabello was in a self-deprecating mood ahead of her catwalk showing, telling AP: \u201cDo you guys know you\u2019re talking to a model? The shortest model that ever walked the runway.\u201d\n\nThe modelling turn also brought out the jitters in Desperate Housewives star Longoria, who confessed \u201cit terrifies me. This is not my comfort zone. I\u2019m not a runway model \u2014 full disclosure.\u201d\n\nMacDowell, meanwhile, praised the brand\u2019s inclusive ethos.\n\n\u201cLast year was the first time I had been on the runway since my 20s, and I started modeling in Paris. So it\u2019s full circle for me to be back,\u201d the 61-year-old \u201cGreen Card\u201d actress said.\n\n\u201cI think (it\u2019s) really interesting to represent mature women and to show that we\u2019re still fashionable and we can do it just like anybody,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nA vivid red screen flanked the Elie Saab runway inside the grounds of a Paris institution, the Michelin 3-star restaurant Alleno Paris at the Pavillon Ledoyen.\n\nThe Lebanese designer got decorative and turned the style-dial firmly back to the 1970s. Small circles were a key theme.\n\nThe circles, at times, appeared controlled, such as the tiny perforated eyelets on a sporty white mini dress with long tassels.\n\nLater, the theme had a boho vibe: a petite sunflower print adorned a floor-length black gown worn by a model styled with her hair in an Afro.\n\nA silk gown in rich electric blue had a looser-than-normal silhouette and a waist that was tight without being cinched. Thick banding led the eye down to a sumptuous full skirt that gently grazed the floor.\n\nThe collection indicated that Saab, who found fame with va-va-voom cinched-waist looks, seems to be moving out of his comfort zone.\n\nAnd it\u2019s paying dividends.\n\n\n\nMinimalism with a hint of equestrian-style utilitarianism.\n\nThat was the simple formula deployed with style in French designer Nadege Vanhee-Cybulski\u2019s spring collection for Hermes.\n\nReports that Hermes\u2019 womenwear is overtaking its menwear sales momentum has added scrutiny to Vanhee-Cybulski\u2019s discreet designs that split fashion critics into two camps.\n\nSome welcome the slight geometry and attention to the famed Hermes house codes that she has brought since taking over in 2014. While, others see the sometimes austere, minimalist designs as an unwelcome direction for the powerhouse synonymous with luxuriance.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s well-executed show, a fine geometry defined the silhouette: Be it in a sporty graphic vest, or a dolphin-gray sweater with Asian-style arms and angular banding at the waist.\n\nBut cinnamon-colored segmented leather looks were the 55-piece-collection\u2019s best.\n\nThey towed the line, in a sort of compromise, between the two camps of critics: Shimmering crisply with luxuriance while remaining understated.\n\n\n\nDesigner Andreas Kronthaler merged his signature urban punk with fresh tribal styles for the Vivienne Westwood show set amid dark brooding light.\n\nThe mood seemed to suit Kronthaler: it resulted in a spring collection that moved the house of Westwood in a welcome, more focused direction.\n\nA gargantuan pointed hat \u2013 part high priestess, part Marie Antoinette \u2013 was paired with a bathing suit bodice, a great detail that set the tone for a display of quirky contrasts.\n\nEthnic jewelry abounded along with knee-high soccer socks. A pale silver headdress billowed fabric ribbons that nestled eccentrically on a pair of loose culottes.\n\nA checkered pattern on loose or gathered skirts cut a fine contrast with a metallic blue double-breasted jacket that had the gigantic round shoulders and glimmer of the 1980s.\n\n\nThomas Adamson can be followed at\n\n\nAmy Serafin contributed to this report\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

        "text":"View Slideshow\n\nCALAIS, France \u201cMine is one of the most beautiful professions in fashion: Making others happy with an idea,\u201d Hubert de Givenchy declared here on Friday at the opening of an exhibition dedicated to the couturier\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cI am happy because I did the job I dreamt of as a child,\u201d the 90-year-old said at a press conference, where he offered\u00a0recollections about his professional and personal relationships with some of his prominent clients, \u00a0as well as the lifelong object of his admiration and respect, Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga.\n\n\u201cHubert de Givenchy,\u201d scheduled to run until the end of \u00a0the year, is housed at the Museum of Lace and Fashion in Calais, the capital of France\u2019s historic lace manufacturing region.\n\nThe exhibition spans more than 80 costumes and accessories drawn from private collections; the archives of the Givenchy fashion house; other institutions such as the Palais Galliera and Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga museums, and the lace museum\u2019s own collections.\n\nShazia Boucher, cocurator of the exhibition, said the designer\u2019s work was driven chiefly by his love of fabric and his admiration of the feminine form, which he thought needed to be equally respected in each design. Givenchy was known as the rare couturier who would visit factories to keep fully abreast of textile development, as well as do personal house calls for his clients.\n\nHis love of textiles \u2014 from modest calico to opulent furs and even man-made fabrics \u2014 results in a focus on textural play throughout the exhibition, which is divided into thematic sections that feature a selection of day clothes, accessories and eveningwear richly decorated with feathers, sequins, beads, fringes and even vinyl. \u201cI created styles for the fabrics I chose,\u201d he explained to the press corps.\n\n\u201cThis is the couturier\u2019s outlook on his own career,\u201d Boucher said during a preview, explaining that the friendships that forged his identity was a reflection of his deep involvement in each step, from selection to styling.\n\n\u201c[Hubert de Givenchy] is a very modest man, and is loath to speak of himself,\u201d said Eloy Mart\u00ednez de la Pera Celada, cocurator of the exhibition. \u201cHe often says that if he can cut a good pattern, it is thanks to Balenciaga; if he can drape, thanks to Madame Gr\u00e8s. He references his mentors freely and often.\u201d\n\nThe museum\u2019s focus on lace manufacturing helped cinch the couturier\u2019s agreement to mount the show. \u201cHis maternal grandfather managed the tapestry manufactures des Gobelins and of Beauvais, and craftsmanship is important to him,\u201d said de la Pera Celada, who has worked with Givenchy on previous exhibitions, including several on Balenciaga.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I remain fascinated by the design and creation of lace,\u201d de Givenchy said. \u201cI have used much lace in my career, although never as well as [Cristobal] Balenciaga, who was the king, the emperor of lace, who knew how to [really] use it in harmony.\u201d\n\n\u201cGivenchy is well-known to the larger public for iconic designs or perfume, but it was important to highlight Mr. de Givenchy\u2019s full contribution to fashion,\u201d said museum director Anne-Claire Laronde. The exhibition had been discussed since the museum\u2019s opening in 2013, and showcases some of the 60 Givenchy designs recently donated by collector and designer Dominique Sirop, a one-time collaborator of the couturier\u2019s.\n\nStarting with a copy of the Bettina blouse \u2014 faithfully reproduced from the original pattern \u2014 from Givenchy\u2019s 1952 breakthrough collection and ending with a trio of bridal gowns, the designs on display include the Duchess of Windsor\u2019s mourning coat, a gown created for French midcentury model-du-jour Capucine \u2014 a 1952 photograph published in defunct lace trade publication Arachn\u00e9 failed to name Givenchy as its designer \u2014 as well as scores of creations for clients and friends such as Audrey Hepburn and Jackie Kennedy.\n\nA further section focuses on three of these professional relationships-turned-friendships, showcasing outfits for the Duchess of Windsor, Jackie Kennedy\u2019s opera gown from her 1961 state visit to France and designs for\u00a0Hepburn.\n\nEnclosed in mirrors, one exhibit focuses on two iconic Hepburn outfits: The evening dress from the 1961 film \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d and the lace cocktail outfit from 1966\u2019s \u201cHow to Steal a Million.\u201d\n\nAnother section highlights Givenchy\u2019s love of art, and the colorful designs inspired by artists such as Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Sonia Delaunay. Several tableaux feature cocktail-appropriate daywear and richly decorated eveningwear, hinting at a Soulages-like appreciation for black.\n\nThe final section is dedicated to bridal gowns, the finale of any couture show. A wall of hats that closes the exhibit reminds the viewer of the opinion shared by the designer and Balenciaga that hats punctuate an outfit.\n\nThree installations about perfume are dotted throughout the show, focusing on scents created under Givenchy\u2019s tenure such as L\u2019Interdit, created for Hepburn and the first perfume to use a celebrity for its promotional imagery.\n\n\u201cBefore Audrey [Hepburn], there was Jacqueline [Kennedy],\u201d he said, whom he met in the 1950 when she was still Jacqueline Bouvier and a young journalist in Paris, and who continued to be a client when she married John Fitzgerald Kennedy. \u201cShe was a very modern woman,\u201d he reminisced. \u201c[After her husband\u2019s election], she still came but very discreetly because the United States [wasn\u2019t] too fond of the idea of their First Lady being dressed by a French couturier.\u201d For her 1961 state visit, \u201can hour before she left to meet the General [de Gaulle, France\u2019s then-president] in Versailles, we received a call from her private secretary to let us know we were dressing her for the duration of her visit,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t peep a word to the press.\n\n\u201cYou all know the story of my meeting with Audrey [Hepburn],\u201d he noted with humor, referencing his expectation of Katharine Hepburn and his meeting with Audrey instead. \u201cShe arrived in my life in adorable manner, to ask me to make clothes for her movie \u2018Sabrina.\u2019 From the moment I met her to the moment she left us, we had a beautiful friendship but we also worked with joy with an exceptional person.\u201d\n\nHighlighted through the exhibition and in his own words is the importance of collaboration. \u201cBe it the petites main or the premi\u00e8re d\u2019atelier, [each design] is the work of a team,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he admitted to not following current industry affairs much, he wished for \u201cnew blood bringing fresh ideas, and for [fashion to truly] understand there had been a change in epoch. The times demand easy things,\u201d he said, noting that fashion is no longer the deeply codified art form of his time. \u201cThe challenge is to find that easy in a chic, harmonious and elegant way.\u201d\n\nAs a conclusion, \u201cevery time I considered stopping, something came up,\u201d he said.\n\nBorn Hubert James Marcel Taffin de Givenchy in a family of Protestant nobility in northern France, Givenchy came to fashion through the work of Balenciaga, which he discovered as a child in magazines. Despite familial disapproval, he went on to work for designers Jacques Fath, Lucien Lelong and Elsa Schiaparelli before launching his own house in 1952.\n\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton took a stake in the house in 1988 and Givenchy remained at the design helm until his retirement in 1995. Succeeding him were John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, Julien MacDonald and most recently Riccardo Tisci, who held the position for 12 years but stepped down last January. His successor, Clare Waight Keller, will show her first designs for the house in October.\n\nCalais\u2019 lace and fashion museum previously hosted exhibitions on Dutch experimental couturier Iris Van Herpen (2013), Balenciaga (2015) and French couturier Anne-Val\u00e9rie Hash (2016).\n\nA collective exhibition focusing on contemporary creation and couture, titled \u201cHaute Dentelle,\u201d is planned for 2018, ahead of the creation of a permanent fashion exhibit.\n\nload comments\nblog comments powered by Disqus",

AFP PHOTO\n\nSouth Korean plus-size model Vivian Geeyang Kim\u00a0 AFP PHOTO\n\nSEOUL: In a country with beauty ideals that pre-makeover Barbie would struggle to meet, South Korean plus-size model Vivian Geeyang Kim is facing down online trolls in her defiant campaign to persuade curvy women they have nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\nKim has modeled for US firms, but at 165 centimeters (5.4 ft) tall and weighing 70 kilograms, she was described as \u201ctoo skinny\u201d for some full-figure fashion show work in America.\n\nBut in her looks-obsessed homeland, she is constantly mocked and ridiculed on social networks as \u201cflat-out fat\u201d or \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn South Korea, the ideal weight for women is 50 kilograms, and many women who weigh more than that think they are fat,\u201d the 30-year-old said.\n\n\u201cThat is a ridiculous, impossible standard that cripples many South Korean women\u2019s self-esteem. And that has to change,\u201d she told Agence France-Presse after a recent photo shoot.\n\nSouth Korean plus-size model Vivian Geeyang Kim poses for a photo shoot in order to update her online clothing shop at a studio in Seoul. AFP PHOTO\n\nSouth Korean plus-size model Vivian Geeyang Kim poses for a photo shoot in order to update her online clothing shop at a studio in Seoul. AFP PHOTO\n\nKim, who is a US size 10, runs an online clothing shop and publishes a fashion magazine specifically for plus-size women in South Korea\u2014a first in a country where beauty is defined by rail-thin teenage K-pop stars and TV actresses whose diets are strictly controlled by their management.\n\nRadical surgery\n\nThe pressure to conform is such that many turn to the country\u2019s $4.6-billion plastic surgery industry which offers everything from a nose-job to radical double-jaw surgery.\n\nIn a 2013 study by Samyook University in Seoul that surveyed 154 female university students in the normal weight range\u2014a body mass index between 18-23\u2014almost 95 percent said they were unhappy with their bodies.\n\nMore than 60 percent felt they needed to lose weight.\n\nThe sort of weight-loss advert that was banned earlier this year in Britain for its image of a bikini-clad woman and the slogan \u201cAre You Beach Body Ready?\u201d would barely raise an eyebrow in South Korea.\n\nSimilar products are promoted on posters pasted on subway walls and women\u2019s toilet stalls, showing models mocking \u201clazy girls\u201d or asking questions like: \u201cHow long are you going to roll around like that?\u201d\n\nIt is precisely this type of widespread, casual body-shaming that Kim is seeking to tackle head-on.\n\n\u201cPeople hate it when a \u2018fat girl\u2019 like me parades her body without looking ashamed \u2026 they say I should not be seen in public or on the media,\u201d Kim said.\n\nHer public stance has triggered an online backlash that has included death threats and vicious abuse that, in some cases, she has responded to with lawsuits.\n\n\u201cDespite all this, I love my job,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to send this message to girls like me out there that they are not alone and they are beautiful no matter what.\u201d\n\nNo opportunity\n\nAfter a failed bid to compete in a local modeling TV reality show, she left for the United States in 2010, where she eventually worked a number of full-figured shows.\n\nOn her return, she searched for similar opportunities in the South Korean fashion scene\u2014 only to realize that there were none.\n\nAccording to Lee Chung Chung, a prominent Seoul fashion designer, using models of varying sizes in magazines or fashion catalogues is still a foreign concept in South Korea.\n\n\u201cThe beauty ideal among many of our customers is being thin \u2026 and we have to cater to that demand to sustain sales,\u201d Lee said.\n\nGong Ji-Woo, head of Seoul-based New Face Model agency, said demand for plus-size models was \u201cnon-existent\u201d\u2014with the exception of some TV shopping channels where they are shown eating food products or trying exercise machines.\n\n\u201cI do feel the need for more development in plus-size model runways and programs,\u201d Gong said.\n\n\u201cBut in order for this to happen, Korean clothing companies and the fashion industry must change to accept them\u2026 rather than for a one time event or our amusement,\u201d he added.\n\nGoing it alone\n\nShut out of the mainstream, Kim set up\u2014and models for\u2014her own quarterly magazine which offers fashion and styling tips for plus-size women and well as advice on how to deal with bullying.\n\n\u201cI hear heartbreaking stories from so-called \u2018fat girls\u2019 all the time\u2014being constantly abused and mocked by their own families, bosses, friends and strangers on the street or on the Internet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHonestly, some of them are not even that fat. But here, the standard of \u2018thin\u2019 is just way too cutthroat and only women as slim as K-pop band members can satisfy that norm,\u201d she added.\n\nAmong her many fans and clients is Baek Soo-Jung, 31, who said Kim had created a sorely needed safe refuge.\n\nAlso a US size 10, Baek said she had been mocked by her own mother, who once refused to take the same bus with her because of the shame of being called \u201cmom\u201d in public by a chubby daughter.\n\nBaek said Kim\u2019s store was the first to produce pretty, well-fitting clothes, instead of the \u201cdull, baggy, ill-fitting sacks local brands call plus-size clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless of my size, I am a human and a woman who wants to feel pretty and to love myself\u2026and Kim is the person who started this conversation in this country,\u201d the 31-year-old said.\n\n\u201cShe took a big, brave step for all women like me.\u201d AFP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow our commenting guidelines.\n\nComments are closed.",

You know, by wearing them a lot?\n\nHigh-end Italian clothing brand Golden Goose is getting some serious blowback this week after the internet noticed it was\u00a0selling intentionally roughed-up sneakers \u2015 made to look like they\u2019re dirty and held together with tape \u2015 for $530.\n\nAccording to Golden Goose\u2019s website, the \u201cSuperstar,\u201d as the shoe is called, consists of a \u201ccalf suede upper\u201d featuring a \u201chot application of coloured tape\u201d and intentionally worn laces.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCrumply, hold-it-all-together tape details a distressed leather sneaker in a retro low profile with a signature sidewa\n\nTwitter users weren\u2019t happy that Golden Goose is charging such a hefty price for the sneakers, with some accusing the brand of \u201cmocking poverty.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDefenders, however, point out that Golden Goose has been selling distressed clothing for years.\u00a0\n\nThe company was involved in this same type of controversy in 2016, when it sold similarly stressed shoes for similarly outrageous prices. \u201cThe company \u2026 is actually proud to highlight its pioneering role in the booming of the distressed look, one of the current biggest trends in fashion,\u201d Golden Goose said at the time. The company did not immediately reply to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOn the plus side, if you\u2019re actually interested in dropping $530 on these artificially beat-up shoes, Nordstrom is selling them \u2015 and apparently offers free shipping!",

        "text":"Zac Posen Casts Mainly Models of Color at NYFW Fall 2016 Show\n\nZac Posen\u2019s fall\/winter 2016-2017 ready-to-wear collection debuted this week. It\u2019s one of the darkest, most mysterious, and uncommon collections that were shown during NYFW. We all know Zac Posen\u2026 everyone knows his stunning dresses, his skills for glamorous eveningwear. Everyone remembers at least one celebrity that rocked Posen on a red carpet, conquering the entire media attention. So, what happened to Posen\u2019s collection this time?\n\nZac Posen Fall\/Winter 2016-2017 RTW - NYFW\n\nThis is not the usual eveningwear you expected. No clich\u00e9s, mermaid tails, fitted waists or anything else you were expecting. Instead, we saw a show of 50 gowns, or it would be more correct to say 50 evening and daytime looks that were not necessarily gowns. Summer dresses in a fall color palette, or an office wear that could be considered inappropriate or too dressy\u2026 an experiment in one word.\n\nAs if we were not confused enough, this time the American designer also presented a row of tailored pantsuits that could be worn from daytime to nighttime, with a few accessory additions. The collection was not limited to dresses and contained some very great trousers, loose fitting and almost formal due to the color concentration and fabric.\n\nThe entire Zac Posen fall 2016 collection is in deep, intoxicating jewel colors, including intensely dark blue, red, as well as a very light doze of brown and purple. Back to the actual designs, some of the silk dresses displayed incredible draping skills, while some of the tracksuits were constructed and tailored in utmost detail. An overlying theme of the week, asymmetric lines and cuts were also noticed. Most of them were on the hem and necklines \u2013 who said you need to have two sleeves, one will do just fine!\n\nMoreover, just in case you need to make a statement when entering the room, we\u2019ll add some flare of fabric on your back, just so the visual effects are guaranteed. This is probably what was on Posen\u2019s mind when he was creating these intense looks. It nearly seems like some of the drama was caged in Posen and has finally broken free on the catwalk.\n\nSo, can you picture a dark-skinned model wearing a navy dress and a navy cloak over it, walking down the runway fiercely? Sounds like a scene from a Game of Thrones episode, but this is just Posen\u2019s drama flattering our desires.\n\nThe Posen effect was enhanced with hair and makeup. While there were no consistent hairstyles: we saw some dark lips for selected looks.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been a Posen fan for a while, we hope this painted a smile on your face. His latest collection means that eveningwear doesn\u2019t have to be uncomfortable, risky, heavy or even full of malfunctions. It can be casual, laid back and relaxed, while you can really enjoy your time and look Posenishly fabulous at the same time.\n\nThe collection will hit the stores in summer!\n\nPhotos courtesy of Vogue\n\nRecent Posts\n\nNaomi Campbell Hosts the Charity Event Fashion For Relief at Cannes\n\nOne of the most recognizable and influential models Naomi Campbell is still in-demand regardless the fact that she turned 47 yesterday.

        "text":"The Bulgari anniversary stamp.\n\nSPECIAL DELIVERY: After Rewrite the Future, a charity project with the Save the Children organization launched in February, Bulgari is now commemorating its 125th anniversary with an unusual partner \u2014 the Poste Italiane. The special edition stamp worth 77 cents features a 1965 yellow gold and platinum necklace dripping with amethysts, turquoises, emeralds and diamonds. On Friday, Poste Italiane will issue 3.5 million pieces of the stamp. Philatelics may try their luck in the post offices of Rome, Milan, Venice and Naples, where it\u2019s available, and online at An article detailing an extensive history of the brand, penned by Bulgari Group chairman Paolo Bulgari, complements the purchase.\n\nThe Bulgari stamp joins two others dedicated to Made In Italy products \u2014 the Fiat 500 and the Lamborghini Miura. Other activities scheduled to mark Bulgari\u2019s anniversary include a retrospective called \u201cBetween Eternity and History\u201d that will be held on May 22 in Rome, followed by a party. At the same time, the firm will showcase 15 high jewelry designs and eight exclusive timepieces worth an estimated 3 million euros, or $3.9 million. The pieces will be auctioned off in December in New York, with all the proceeds going toward the charity.\n\nThis story first appeared in the April 27, 2009 issue of WWD.\u00a0 Subscribe Today.\n\nTWICE IS A CHARM: PPR chief Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault and his wife Salma Hayek on Saturday reprised their wedding, this time in Venice. The couple reportedly said \u201csi\u201d again at the La Fenice Theatre and later dined al fresco inside a rose-filled Punta della Dogana, the museum of contemporary art owned by the Pinaults. Some 200 guests \u2014 including Edward Norton, Lucy Liu, Jacques Chirac, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Valeria Golino \u2014 glided down the canals to attend the event. The couple were first married last year at a small ceremony in Paris and have a daughter, Valentina Paloma.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL EXAMPLE: As president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Diane von Furstenberg has championed copyright protection. So she was naturally shocked when she was being accused late last week of having designed a jacket that resembled one by Canadian label Mercy. \u201cWhen I saw it on the Internet, I thought, The print is completely different,\u201d von Furstenberg told WWD. \u201cBut then I saw something about the style with the bow, so I am not sure.\u201d She immediately contacted her design team and found that the woman who designed the item no longer worked for her. \u201cI am finding out the information, and I have asked my attorney to contact [Mercy\u2019s designers] and say that we are investigating,\u201d von Furstenberg said. \u201cI am mortified that something like that could happen here. I will do what is necessary to do, and if indeed there was an infringement, I will compensate and will use this example to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again \u2014 not just for me, but for everybody.\u201d\n\nREUSE, RE-WEAR, RECYCLE: Add Rodarte to the growing list of young New York designers Michelle Obama is giving a publicity boost. For her meeting with Jordan\u2019s Queen Rania on April 23, Obama pulled a fall-winter 2007 Rodarte dress from her closet \u2014 a pleated, sleeveless taupe number she purchased at Ikram and had previously worn to a dinner during the Democratic National Convention last summer, pairing it on both occasions with the same Erickson Beamon pearl necklaces. Adhering to the \u201cshop your closet\u201d mantra, Obama donned the Moschino bow blouse and Junya Watanabe cardigan (this one in pink) the same day for a Take Your Child to Work Day event for White House employees. Obama had previously worn the blouse and a blue version of the sweater during her visit to Europe in early April.\n\nis set to look heavenly when he reprises his role as Robert Langdon in \u201cAngels & Demons,\u201d the film based on the best-selling novel by Dan Brown.
