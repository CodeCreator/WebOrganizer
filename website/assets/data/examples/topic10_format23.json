Also if you are looking for something loaded with fiber that doesn't have the consistency of wood pulp give this a try. When mixed with milk or juice the chia flour takes on an almost creamy consistency. I highly recommend it.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nvery good\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on May 11, 2008 | Verified Purchase\n\nI wanted to add to my daily fiber and saw that chia was also high in Omegas. I mix it in a drink with lots of other healthy stuff and like the taste. The texture took a little getting use to but now I'm fine with it.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nProbably a good food but does have a taste...\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Aug 05, 2008 | Verified Purchase\n\nPart of the blurb was that chia was universally usable in any recipe since it had a neutral tastt and texture, but it doesnt, it is slightly chewy and tastes a little like flax...I suppose the omega three part of it. However it can blend into smoothies and baked goods.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nLove it.\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Jun 04, 2008 | Verified Purchase\n\nReally delicious. And that matters if you are thinking of drinking it frequently. I need a very high protein diet (blood sugar issues etc) but don't want to rely on any one source. So each morning I vary my protein shake. Every third day is my favourite when I have hazelnut milk and 5 tsp of this lovely chia seed. Worth noting, by the way, that Salba - sold by Iherb for more than twice the price of this Chia seed - is just 100% Chia seeds! And not even pre-ground. The ground seeds are fresh - no ranicd oil tastes which can be risk with pre-ground omega 3 seeds - and dislove moderately in nut\/rice\/soya milk. I do add a bit of stevia for sweetness. But the chia has a decent taste and is somewhat sweet and nutty. Certainly nicer than soya protein powder or rice protein powder. In addition, it has tons of excellent fiber and my body thanks me for that a few hours later!!! No bloating either. Only gripe: the label is inaccurate, also the iherb listings. Chia has a lot more protein than is listed here. 5 heap tsp is about 20 -22g. Same as a good sized steak! Oh, and lots of amazing healthy oils thrown in for free. Great price, great product, entirely natural.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nvery delicious\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Nov 14, 2008 | Verified Purchase\n\ni use this in bread baking. it adds a nice chewy texture and nutrition.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nGreat product!\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Feb 10, 2015 | Verified Purchase\n\nI'm vegetarian and this is a great source of omegas for me! The taste is mild and you can add it to your breakfast smoothie, yogurt or almost anything! Better than the seeds because with them you might have problems with them to digest properly... :)\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nLovely & Light\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Apr 22, 2014 | Verified Purchase\n\nLovely & light, fluffy chia. I add it to breads, baking etc\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nHealthy Origins, White Chia Flour, 12 oz (340 g)\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Jul 16, 2013 | Verified Purchase\n\nlike this product, but as I began to use it I understood that I like whole seeds too. So no need to buy it as flour\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nNew to Chia\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Jan 27, 2013 | Verified Purchase\n\nJust caught on to the value of Chia. This is a great way to add it to your diet. Works in many recipes without effecting taste.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nWhite Chia Flour\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Aug 22, 2011 | Verified Purchase\n\nA good substitute in recipes for chia seeds\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n1-10 of 17 total\n\n1 2",

The beer was clear initially, but since the bottle is so small, I was able to get the entire contents into the glass with one pour, including the sentiment. Atop the liquid is a splendid looking crown of almond colored foam that sports a rough hewn surface and is substantial enough to hang around for a bit. Thick bands of pocked lace are a bonus. I'm impressed so far and I haven't even smelled it yet.\n\nThe nose is solid, even if it fails to 'wow' me as much as the appearance. It's tart and fruity and acetic acid-like and oaky and all the things that Flanders red ales are known for. It's a perfect example of the style, if not quite the standard bearer. If I was to nitpick, I'd ask for more intensity and more complexity.\n\nMy first impression is that I'm not quite as impressed as I was with the much less-heralded Mestreechs Aajt and Monk's Flemish Sour Red. Rodenbach is intense, but it's more intensely acidic than it is intensely flavorful or intensely sour. The flavor profile is another step down from the nose in terms of (a lack of) complexity.\n\nAccording to the label, the beer is 75% fresh and 25% aged in oak. Even though I can appreciate the wood, more would nice. This beer needs more of quite a few things in fact. Again, it's a faithful version, just not a stellar one according to my taste buds. I had originally thought that the 250 ml bottle would be way too small, but it's turning out to be just about about right.\n\nThere's very little wrong with the mouthfeel from where I sit. By the same token, it doesn't distinguish itself either. It's on the thin side with the exception of a nod toward lightly viscous on the finish. A generous amount of fine-bubbled carbonation adds some amount of mouth interest.\n\nRodenbach Classic is a disappointment. I've come to enjoy this style and was expecting an explosion of tart, funky, oak-accented fruit... and didn't get it. I don't remember where I finally located a bottle, but from now on, whenever I get the urge to drink a beer of this style, I'll be content with the Monk's Flemish Sour Red that I can get mere minutes from my front door. Here's hoping that Rodenbach Grand Cru blows the roof off the joint.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n11-02-2006 21:18:31\u00a0|\u00a0More by BuckeyeNation\nPhoto of BeerNutta\n\n\n4\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev 0%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\n\nA = Poured out of the bottle dark mahogany.

As it warms, there's some leather, chinese plum sauce, and even some grapefruit.\n\nThe effervescence explodes in the mouth. The mouthfeel is not puckeringly sour, but it is still quite light & thin. There is no bitterness that I can discern.\n\nQuite a remarkable drink. I would drink one glass as an aperitif. I couldn't have it as a session beer.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n10-19-2006 08:00:46\u00a0|\u00a0More by vancurly\nPhoto of SkeeterHawk\n\n\n4.22\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +5.5%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nThis beer is really assertive from the very beginning. There is a dry impression with some noticeable roast that helps accent this dryness. There seems to be a bit of oxidation in this example that I am not sure is from actual oxidation from age, or from the aging in the barrels that breath. There is a very subtle dryness to this beer that makes it seem very well attenuated. There is a whole bunch of fruit in this beer and you can pick out the cherries in particular. The cherries are such a big player that it almost gives the beer an impression of the Black Cherry Kool-Aid.\n\nAs the beer warms a bit, there is a much more earthy flavor coming out. It really gets woody after it sits for a while. After you have been sipping this beer for a little while, there is a noticeable acidity that lingers on the back of the throat much like a Stout beer, but without the coffee like aftertaste. It leaves a cherry-like impression to linger for some time. This is a nice beer. It is nice to have a beer that is this light on the alcohol, yet still this big on flavor.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n10-03-2006 03:41:09\u00a0|\u00a0More by SkeeterHawk\nPhoto of LarryV\n\n\n2.68\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -33%\nlook: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.5\n\nI found this to be a really disappointing beer. Aroma wasn't bad, but the overwhelming sourness once I tasted it turned me right off. Reminded me of drinking apple cider and had apple cider vinegar overtones. It was a chore to drink a 10.5 oz glass of this.\n\nServing type: on-tap\n\n10-02-2006 00:56:37\u00a0|\u00a0More by LarryV\nPhoto of rarevos\n\nNew York\n\n4.33\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +8.3%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5\n\nPoured from bomber into Ommegang ale glass.\n\nA: Pours a murky reddish-brown, more brown than red. Head is light tan and doesn't stick around for long. Remains as a thin layer of tiny bubbles.\n\nS: Cherry, oaky aroma with a touch of plums and strawberries at the back.\n\nT\/M: Cherry woodiness up front, and, as with a gueuze, you can tell that some sourness\/tartness is building. It's moderately acidic toward the middle as it builds to become lightly vinous right before the swallow. Some ripe, dark fruit emerges here, like plums, sour cherries, and red wine grapes. Finish is sour, lightly chocolatey, and with a mildly bitter tail. Very, very good.\n\nD: This isn't as sour or as fruity\/vinous as Duchesse de Bourgogne, but they're two pretty different beers, so that's not a knock. This one is milder, mellower, and has some roasty, woody sweetness to round out the many flavors.\n\nThis is a sour beer that doesn't beat you up with sourness. A series of complex flavors work with the tartness\/sourness to produce something really unique, and I can't wait to try and pair this with some authentic Flemish cuisine. Low abv% means that you're not limiting yourself to just one beer. I'm not sure I would drink a ton of these, but a bomber is just about right.\n\nI usually keep some of this on hand in my cellar, and I'm always glad for it. For me, this is a classic, a really unique beer. One of my favorite comforting beers.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n10-01-2006 23:26:54\u00a0|\u00a0More by rarevos\nPhoto of Beertracker\n\n\n4.68\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +17%\nlook: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5\n\nRodenbach Classic (Red) should be served at (47-53F) from a traditional flute or stemmed goblet. The Red (Classic) is a combination of 75% fresh ale & 25% barrel aged ale and pours up very softly with plenty of Belgian lace. The translucent reddish-light brown body is offset beautifully by a fluffy, cream colored head. The nose is ripe with fruity complexity and some sweet candy apple undertones. The classic Flanders aroma has some subtle oak character, light oxidation and a noteably sharp sourness. Hints of aged Balsamic vinegar, cordial cherries, red currants and fresh green apples spring to mind. The first sip creates an initial sourness upon the palate that seems to shock every taste bud on the tongue! Once the initial acidity fades, some sweet caramel apple and bitter almond characters emerge intermingled with the sharp sourness. The winelike finish is decidely tart, dry (oaky & tannic) and slightly astringent. The medium body is alive with a zesty carbonation that creates some prickly carbonic acid, as it glides past the lips.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the quintessential classic for a Flanders Red Ale. I'm very pleased to see this world class beer make its long awaited return to the United States. However, I feel that the \"rebirth\" of this classic has come at some cost, as it has lost some of the earthy \"wildness\" and complexity that it previously held. This highly regarded Flemish Sour Ale is still one of my all-time favorites and I highly recommend that if you're a sour beer fan that you seek some out! Enjoy Rodenbach Red as an apertif or try it paired with some blue cheese stuffed crabcakes. For a traditional treat... try enjoying a glass with your next breakfast or brunch?

This review is from doing a side by side with 08 and 11.\nThe beer pours a amber red color with the 08 being a duller and murkier color with the 11 vibrant and clear. They both have a light tan head that fades quickly and sticks to the glass.\nThe 11 smell like a cherry and clove bomb, spicy, honey and alcohol. The 08 smells amazing much more balanced then the 11 with the smell a bit candy like.\nThe taste follows suite to the nose on both beers, the 11 was dominated by belgian flavors with clove, cherry and alcohol. The 08 tastes fantastic, its sweet yet spicy, the clove has faded off a lot revealing a balanced cherry and honey to mesh with the belgian flavors.\nThey both have a medium body and good carbonation. The 08 in my opinion is leaps and bounds better then the 11, if I get anymore bottles this year I will be putting them away for awhile.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n11-13-2011 20:41:51\u00a0|\u00a0More by BdubleEdubleRUN\nPhoto of jmerloni\n\n\n4.9\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +26.9%\nlook: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5\n\nA - Mahogany to ruby in coloration, with a small but heavy cream-colored head that laces fairly lacklusterly. But this is one of the only beers whose color I haven't been able to quite describe. It's a color I've never seen and I guess it's special in that way.\n\nS - Incredible smell. Light, FRESH maltiness, dark fruits which you can already tell are perfectly acidic and perfectly sweet in all the perfect, balanced places.\n\nT - Off the charts delicious. Tastes like how an 11% beer should taste without all the alcohol. Achieves a very impressive flavor profile between malt and and hop. Really, really impressed by the flavors here. They're really pleasant. Cherries! Honey malts. Fresh, west coast IPA hops. An incredible mix. Almost just jawdropping.\n\nM - Medium to light bodied, not very carbonated. Incrediblly profession makeup of each sip in this beer, though.\n\nD - One of the only beers I've ever tried that is just unmistakably elite. And one of the only beers I've ever encountered where a brewery just set out to make it great. It doesn't fit any real description nor style. Troegs just set out to make a great, elite beer, and they have with Mad Elf, they absolutely have.

Smudged born date.\n\nPoured a lucid tea color or light ruby red. Slight head, dissipated quickly. No lacing to speak of.\n\nSmells of belgian yeast, bananas and a hint of cherry. Not well projected.\n\nTaste is a just slightly tart, effervescent blend of spiced fruit and honey. The balance between honeyed sweetness and cherried tart really is perfect here, and I can't believe that the blend works as well as it does though. I can see some however, potentially finding this a little bit like cough syrup. It stops just short of synthetic for me, but more sensitive palates or supertasters may have a hard time with this one. Plenty effervescent, lot of boozy cherry in on the background, as those tertiary flavors take off into the drydown.\n\nOverall, really a unique beer that stands alone next to a slew of dark, stouty winter seasonals. I started off not liking it initially, as it was just so vast different from anything that I was used to, but working my way through the bottle really had me enjoying it at the end.

Super funky and cheesey, really great.\n\nt - Tastes of funky cheese, sour fruits, oak, citrus hops, floral hops, earthy notes, light must, acedic notes, barnyard funk. Again, super funky, really awesome.\n\nm - Light to medium body and low carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink beer.\n\no - Overall this is a fantastic gueuze and an improvement on the Classic Gueuze, which is one of my all time favorites. Another winner in the Lou Pepe series, I think I would rank this very slightly behind the LP Kriek and in front of the LP Framboise. Super funky and cheesey, would love to get some bottles of this one.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n03-07-2012 02:20:52\u00a0|\u00a0More by mdfb79\nPhoto of oline73\n\n\n4.53\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +0.9%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5\n\nPoured from a bottle into a flute.

Sour citrus aromas emanate immediately from my glass. These aromas are accompanied by notes of musty mushrooms and urea. A very tart first sip; my lips pucker and it feels like my cheeks have turned inside out. Ah yes this is going to be a good Cantillon offering.\n\nFairly low carbonation for a Gueuze, though strictly speaking this is not one, as it only has three year old Lambic in it. This is quite lemony and not as funky as some Lambic derivations. The brettanomyces character is pretty subdued, but there are definite musty-leathery notes here. A bit of vinegar adds to the acidity. The beer finishes with a slight tannic astringency, which seems fairly typical. My only complaint is that perhaps this bottle could have used a bit more complexity. The good\/ variable thing about Lambic is that the next bottle is likely to be quite a bit different, so perhaps my complexity is hidden in the next bottle.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n01-15-2004 03:04:18\u00a0|\u00a0More by Gueuzedude\nPhoto of Rochefort10nh\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n5\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +11.4%\n\n11-25-2011 23:42:21\u00a0|\u00a0More by Rochefort10nh\nPhoto of mendvicdog\n\n\n4.25\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -5.3%\n\n03-10-2013 17:07:31\u00a0|\u00a0More by mendvicdog\nPhoto of beernads\n\n\n4.5\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +0.2%\n\n09-16-2013 00:21:52\u00a0|\u00a0More by beernads\nPhoto of corby112\n\n\n5\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +11.4%\n\n11-21-2011 10:14:18\u00a0|\u00a0More by corby112\nPhoto of imperialking\n\n\n4.5\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +0.2%\n\n11-30-2011 05:22:07\u00a0|\u00a0More by imperialking\nPhoto of weeare138\n\n\n4.33\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -3.6%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\n2004 vintage on tap at Teresa's Next Door...\nAppears a light, slightly hazed gold with a small, white head that quckly dissipates into a mild bubbly cap.\nSmell is of funky barnyard, horseblanket, honey, earthy, musty, with hints of apple, and oaky vanilla.\nTaste is of the mentioned aromas with notes of nectarines, and apricots.\nMouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, effervescent, and lightly sour on the finish.\n\nServing type: on-tap\n\n09-11-2007 19:44:10\u00a0|\u00a0More by weeare138\nPhoto of lacqueredmouse\n\n\n4.6\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +2.4%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5\n\nAfter a St. Patrick's Day filled with Imperial Stouts (no Guinness, here), we figured we should hit something lighter, and when @LaitueGonflable mentioned that he'd \"love something sour\" there was no question about what was next.\n\nThis was the 2008 vintage, tasted in 2012.\n\nPours a slightly hazed, but refined golden colour, with a mild, frothy but lively head of pure white. Ah, Gueuze really is the champagne of beers, isn't it? Fine bead of carbonation and a fluid but solid body that holds its carbonation well. Looks really excellent.\n\nNose is classic gueuze, with refined peppery overtones, mingles with earthy aromas and a sharp plastic character. Latex rubber, slight resin, wine cork, cellar, dust. Oh, it does such a wonderful job of riffing on the classic aromas, while still maintaining its basis. Lovely.\n\nClear and clean on the palate, and surprisingly mellow, without the biting, oesophageally challenging acidity that marks many a Cantillon brew. Light vinous characters, with a touch of oak, some banana leaf, and a hint of pepper, but without the bite or the piquancy. Oh, it is so very refined and sophisticated. It perhaps doesn't have the intense complexity of some gueuzes, but there's something very special about the smoothness, the roundness and the clean power of it. It's just lovely.\n\nFeel is clear and bright, with a very fine carbonation that only goes so far as to enliven the palate; never to overwhelm.\n\nReally gorgeous beer. In fact, very near sublime. It's so smooth, and yet with all the refined haughtiness of the best gueuzes. I love that the acidity is so restrained. It makes for a less raw and powerful, but more sophisticated brew. Really, the skill that has gone into its preparation is astonishing.\n\nServing type: bottle\n\n03-17-2012 06:49:19\u00a0|\u00a0More by lacqueredmouse\nPhoto of yourefragile\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n3.75\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -16.5%\n\n01-18-2013 01:26:24\u00a0|\u00a0More by yourefragile\nPhoto of tempest\n\n\n4.55\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +1.3%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5\n\nLabel reads 2006, corks says bottled in 2008. Aside from dates, the bottle is in French and Dutch as it was brought back from the Netherlands. I've been having a fair number of amazing oude gueuzes lately, and this hits all the marks, but goes just a little deeper. Yes, there's the sharp lemon-lime juice sour\/acidic tang that pulls at the back of your jaw. There's the toasted oak, but also with a hint of ash and pepper. And then I also taste a not inappropriately cheesey funk like you'd get from a nice, fatty blue cheese. What else? Mmmmm, there's a light fresh garden herb and celery note, dry white grape, and wheat cracker. God damn this beer is amazing.\n\nUPDATE 6\/14\/10: Had a bottle from 2005.
