The roastiness is up front as well, but it's well balanced and so complex, very enjoyable indeed. The coffee notes stay in the nose, not in the flavor at all.\nM-The mouthfeel is huge and cream with a lively carbonation which is nice for a change, (most beers this big are lightly carbonated, but this one has a little more) it also has a nice and balanced finish.\nO-Overall I had a great experience with this beer.

The raw sugars brought up the rear.\n\nMouthfeel \u0096 This was close to full in the body and had a very playful mouthfeel.\n\nDrinkability \u0096 This was a complicated but fine malty Imperial Stout.\u00a0(504 characters)\n\nPhoto of TCHopCraver\n4.07\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +4.1%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4\n\nTasted with zoso1967 on 2\/16\/11.\n\nRyan pours pretty dark brown, bordering on black. The head is a buoyant one and a half fingers, even though the bottle was split two ways. This head is a dark khaki color with large bubbles contained within. The lacing is very sticky on my snifter and full of curvy arches and dots.\n\nThe smell is very caramelly and chocolaty... much like a Rollo candy. A little roastiness is apparent in the bouquet, especially when I agitate the beer. I get just a small amount of coffee and a pretty decent amount of sherry in my olfactory. Overall, the smell is pretty sweet for an Imperial Stout.\n\nThe taste is pretty sweet and a little fruity, but in a good way. The caramel-chocolate vibe carries over from the smell and combines with a dark fruit taste at the outset of the sip. Starting at the swallow, the roast and coffee characteristics jump on my tongue and lend a nice dry, bittersweet flavor to the aftertaste.\n\nThis is a medium-bodied mouthfeel for the style, perhaps even a little on the light side. It is very smooth on my taste buds, though, with a roasty and drying finish.\n\nR.S. is quite tasty and very drinkable for the style. It is smooth, sweet, roasty, and consistent. It is not as complex and multi-layered as other Imperial Stouts that I have had, but it is enjoyable and kind on my palate.\u00a0(1,338 characters)\n\nPhoto of tbryan5\n3.83\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -2%\n\nPhoto of SanFranJake\n4\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +2.3%\n\nPhoto of nickadams2\n3.88\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -0.8%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5\n\nA_Dark brown with dark red edges.

Head has pretty good retention and leaves some spotty lacing.\n\nS - Lots of chocolate and roasted malt in the aroma, with a bit of char. Smell has a bit of sweet chocolate and mostly bittersweet chocolate.\n\nT - The taste is a pretty big letdown after the aroma. Huge amount of char and some sourness, though it doesn't taste like infection sourness. Some dark fruits, milk chocolate and bittersweet chocolate, but covered up by the intense char and sour character. Ashy finish.\n\nM - Even on a warm summer night, this seemed quite thin. Dry, bitter, ashy feel.\n\nO - Started strong enough, but the taste was pretty unpleasant and the mouthfeel quite disappointing.

I\u0092ve had other Imperial Stouts and this one did not meet what I expected it to be. The head retention was decent at best; the aroma was a bit acrid with soured roasted grain. It had a good sweetness but it was lost in a downward spiral of estery alcohol and acidic roasted grain. No balance and even the dark fruitiness got lost in the mix.\n\nDon\u0092t get me wrong I love Imperial Stouts but this one just did not make the cut.\u00a0(473 characters)\n\nPhoto of Mora2000\n4\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +2.3%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nThanks to Barzigkin for sharing this bottle.\n\nPours dark brown to black with a tan head. The aroma is coffee with roasted malt. The flavor is raisins, roasted malt, coffee and some bitterness from either the hops or coffee. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. A solid imperial stout.\u00a0(285 characters)\n\nPhoto of magictrokini\n4.08\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +4.3%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4\n\nExcellent. Black pour with a dense tan head. Coffee, cocoa, and thick roasted malts just pound you in the face. Velvety smooth mouthfeel and taste. The coffee, chocolate, and cherries are prevalent throughout the taste, but not to the extent that it drowns out the subtle currants and alcohol. Let this one warm a little before drinking it, its well worth it.\u00a0(359 characters)\n\nPhoto of ironlung\n4.35\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +11.3%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nA: Dark as midnite with no head(of course).

It is so mellow, and all the booze is even better hidden.\n\nM: Subdued. Not as thick\/sticky as the non-cask. Some hot alcohol lingers as I exhale.\n\nD: I perfer the non-cask, but this is a great change. The wood mellows out this monster well!\u00a0(471 characters)\n\nPhoto of jondeelee\n4.45\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +13.8%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5\n\nRyan Sullivan's Imperial Stout opens with a thick whiff of malts, which bring a tantalizing blend of dark and light aromas. Included in these are chocolate malts, heavy cream, coffee, light tobacco, caramel, and a touch of Grape Nuts cereal-like lighter grains. Brown sugar, toffee and vanilla linger around the edges, joined by a smidgen of old port and cognac. Hops add just a touch of citrus backing, bringing subtle hints of bitterness to counter the sugars. The overall effect is beautifully balanced and nuanced, hampered only by the aromas' slightly weakened state: the volume knob seems to have only been set at eight instead of ten.\n\nOn the tongue, the beer opens dark and rich, with an immediate shot of brown sugar, fig juice, vanilla, and chocolate malt. These are quickly joined by caramels and toffee, then heavier layers of ash and tobacco, with hints of black malt, providing a layering effect. The darker flavors come to dominate the flavor profile as the beer sits on the tongue, set off by a perfect balance of citrusy hops, which provide subtle pine resin and grapefruit rind bitterness. The aftertaste is more of the darker flavors, as well as a lingering hop bitterness and touches of ash, and lasts for a long time. Mouthfeel is an odd-feeling medium, given the flavors, and carbonation is medium-low.\n\nOverall, this is excellent Imperial Stout, and it says much of the flavors that the 10% ABV is completely hidden beneath them. The mouthfeel is surprisingl... (truncated)",

Highlights a number of great hops in both flavor and aroma. Very common of a northwest IPA and nice to see a bold IPA in the northeast. The bottle I had was 20 days old, so still fresh and relatively young.\n\nA little more malt body or higher lovibond would give more balance and tone down the hops and make it a better transition IPA while still focusing on the hop profile.\n\nOverall this is a very hop forward IPA and very good for what I expect for the style\n\nPhoto of StoutHunter\n4.02\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +12%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nI got a bottle of City Steam's Innocence Ale last week in a trade with @Motozappa, Thanks a lot! I've never heard of this brewery till Motozappa mentioned it and I'm interested to see what this beer is all about, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.\n\nA- The label looks really nice, it's got a nice design to it with a provocative librarian in the middle and they even recommend it to librarians, I think it's pretty eye catching, I know if I saw this on the shelf it would catch my eye. It poured a orange color that took on slightly golden hue and it took on more of a darker orange color when held to the light with two fingers worth of dense looking off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and left a good amount of spotty and patchy lacing behind. This was a very nice looking beer, I really liked the color and the head and lacing weren't bad at all.\n\nS- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness and it's followed by the hops being the first to show up and they impart some light floral and light piney hops aromas with the citrus and fruit hops sticking out the most with some nice grapefruit and citrus rind aroma with a nice and slightly lighter juicy aspect in the background. Up next comes the malts which impart some caramel malt and bread crust like aromas with some lighter sweet malt aromas in the background along with a very light amount of doughy yeast. This beer had a pretty good aroma, the hop profile was nice and it had good balance to it.\n\nT- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness followed by the malts being the first to show up this time and they impart some nice caramel malt and bread crust flavor with a slight grainy flavor in the background along with a very light amount of doughy yeast. Up next comes the hops which impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma, but there's also a light spicy hop aspect and the citrus rind hops seem to stick out the most, but not by much. On the finish there's a slightly higher amount of medium bitterness with a grainy, caramel malt and citrus rind hop aftertaste. This was a pretty good tasting beer, it had nice balance to it and it wasn't overly bitter.\n\nM- Smooth, clean, a little crisp, on the slightly thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it was true to style and it worked well with this beer.\n\nOverall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of an IPA, the description on Beeradvocate says that this is a traditional and old school IPA and I think it fits in to the category well, instead of fancy hops it relies on balance and I like that. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, not too filing and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, if I had another one I would drink it and I think two or three of these would be the prefect amount for me. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, it was pretty much perfect and neither aspect was too overpowering. What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't any aspect that was lacking. I would buy this beer if I ever had the chance and I would recommend it to people who like simple and drinkable IPA's. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it pretty much delvered everything that It said it would, but I'm not sure this one will be the talk of the librarian community. This beer made for a good first impression of this brewery and I hope I can try some more of their beers. Good job guys, this was a very solid IPA and I hope to try some more of your beers in the future.\n\nPhoto of mttaylor1066\n3.92\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +9.2%\nlook: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nI see that others have rated this lower than I do. Not sure why. I think this is a robust IPA with only a small deficiency on the nose.\n\nI like the substantial body on this beer and the color is right in the IPA range. There isn't a lot of hoppy fragrance on the nose. But, on the other hand, the Czech hops don't make much of an appearance in this brew.\n\n\nPhoto of tigg924\n2.93\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -18.4%\nlook: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.5\n\nAppearance: high carbonation, 1 inch head, hazy, amber in color\n\nSmell: pine and citrus hops with light caramel\n\nTaste: grapefruity citrus hops dominate with piney and earthy hops along with bready caramel\n\nMouthfeel: Bitter with light sweetness and a dry bitter aftertaste, light body, high carbonation\n\nOverall: An average IPA that is on the bitter side but true to style. Not bad, but nothing distinguishes this one from countless other IPAs I have had. I will pass on this in the future.\n\nPhoto of Flounder57\n3.78\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +5.3%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75\n\n12 oz bottle was poured into a pint glass.\n\nAppearance: This beer poured a one finger head that reduced to a thin layer. It is a hazy copper amber color with a little bit of clarity and bubbles seen coming up through the glass. Nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank.\n\nSmell: Citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, caramel, and grassy hops.\n\nTaste: Tangerine, grapefruit, orange, grassy, and lemon\/lime hops followed by caramel malts and mild hop bitterness.\n\nMouthfeel: Smooth, a little bitter, a little creamy, medium bodied, and medium carbonation.\n\nOverall: Pretty nice IPA from Hartford. A new reason to stop there when driving on 84.\n\nPhoto of johnnnniee\n3.74\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +4.2%\nlook: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75\n\nOn tap at the source.\nComes to the table a solid golden amber with a decent head that leaves lots of lace on the way down. Smells of bitter citrus and earth with lots of caramel maltiness to back it up. Old school aroma reminds me of Harpoon. The flavor follows the aroma with lots of grapefruit and lemon pith with hints of pine and a bit of caramel and brown bread to back it up. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Nice old school IPA I enjoyed it.\n\nPhoto of Thads324\n2.63\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -26.7%\nlook: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 2.5\n\nFreshest keg on tap at the brewery:\n\nPours a lovely deep amber with copper hues. Pillowy white head that never dissipates fully. Solid lacing.\nAromas of super sweet caramel and toffee. Some grassy floral hops and a very small hint of pine and citrus.\nTaste starts watery, then very sweet. Lots of caramel and toasty toffee. Very sweet sugary flavor. The hops start in the middle, solid bitterness but no discerning flavors really. Very muddled. Too much going on for one hop to shine through. Just not good at all.\nMouthfeel is medium, heavily car... (truncated)",

Initially, its smell was much more prominent, almost floral. You can smell the brown shugga' in there.\n\nNice and malty tasting, but not unbalanced. This beer's hoppy, but the hops aren't the main attraction. It's the molasses!\n\nThis label declares this ale to be an experiment. As far as I can tell, the data shows that this beer rocks.\n\nMarty, Dec 17, 2005\nPhoto of davemarc87\n4\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -0.5%\n\ndavemarc87, May 28, 2014\nPhoto of RoyalT\n4.15\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +3.2%\nlook: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4\n\nAppearance \u0096 The body was a beautiful slightly-darkened orange and the head was incredible. This was one of the nicest heads that I\u0092ve seen. It rose up mightily, going down slowly as it laced the glass and formed huge volcanic-like pits.\n\nSmell \u0096 Classic SOA aroma. The toasted malts are big and well-complimented by a sweet mix of molasses, maple, caramel, toffee, and, yes, lots of brown shugga\u0092. The alcohol comes out in the nose as well, warning the drinker that this one is serious.\n\nTaste \u0096 Yeah, baby. This is super sweet with all the afore-mentioned sugars plus a nice malt backbone. I think there may even be some hops to balance out this huge Lagunitas offering but it\u0092s hard to tell. Yes, there is a little piney hop to this one.\n\nMouthfeel \u0096 Sweet and creamy like sugar water with a bit of hop. I literally found myself biting at the ale as I held it in my cheeks.\n\nDrinkability \u0096 This went down really fast for an ale on the edge of an ABV double digit midget. I will definitely buy again.\n\nUpdate \u0096 I first tasted this with a 2003 vintage so thought I would re-review with an \u009204 just for kicks. It is really a gorgeous all to stare at.\n\nThe hops are much bigger at the nose then I remember. Maybe I have a fresher bottle? Anyway, at a dollar to two dollars cheaper than other ABW\u0092s of the same class, this is a steal. I\u0092m upping my Appearance and Smell by half a point and buying a case to cellar.\n\nRoyalT, Dec 18, 2003\nPhoto of DanGeo\n3.75\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -6.7%\n\nDanGeo, Apr 26, 2014\nPhoto of tectactoe\n3.95\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -1.7%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4\n\nPours a copper, orange-amber hybrid color with pretty good clarity that is only compromised by a slight haze that drifts up and down the glass in the very center. A musky, off-white head forms on top of the beer, remains small, and holds fast as a thin ring along the top.\n\nBrown Shugga's aroma is that of a strong, syrupy, peppery hop, right alongside sweet, booze-filled plums and raisins. Heavy, heavy caramel and toffee on the nose, sugary and sweet. Again, lots of hop aromas are coming out of this as well; spicy, herbal, ashy, oily, and pungent. I can't tell if this is an overly-hopped malty ale or an overly-malty IPA of sorts. It's got enough of a hop aroma to smell like a malty DIPA, but it could also pass off as a hopped-up barleywine with a malt structure like it has... I guess we'll see.\n\nBrown Shugga is pretty thick and syrupy on the palate without being overly abrasive, though it is a bit sticky. The flavor profile that hits your tongue is complex and hard to exactly pin down. Heavy caramel and toffee make up the backbone; molasses, syrup, burnt brown sugar, booze, ripe raisins, sweet plums - this beer is a malt bomb, and that's a FACT. Sweet and sugary as they come with lots of residuals that stick to the palate and seem to hang on for dear life...\n\n...BUT WAIT! Here come the hops - pungent, earthy, herbal, ashy, oily, and providing a bitterness that cuts through the sweetness at the last minute to provide a balance that you never thought would be possible after the first moments of the sip. The gradient of flavors across my palate still has me wondering exactly what kind of beer this really is. Talk about smearing style guidelines! Some boozy black cherries and leafy hops fade into the aftertaste with a sweet and sugary decrescendo. Carbonation was medium, maybe on the low side, with a fairly thick body.\n\nPretty tasty. Almost reminds me of an aged DIPA, but where the hop character is still fairly heavy and robust after the aging. Then again, it could be a malty-ass barleywine with quadruple the amount of hops used. Sweet, but not sickeningly so. Nice balance when all's said and done. Though the booze is noticeable, it's still fairly easy to throw back for being nearly 10% ABV.\n\ntectactoe, Jan 27, 2013\nPhoto of ExtraStout\n4.08\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +1.5%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4\n\nPours a crystal clear ruby-brown with gorgeous, jewel-like highlights. Thick but small head that fades to a dusting and collar. Aromas of citrus, pears and yeast, along with a bit of zesty sweetness. On the palate, bitterness and brisk carbonation start things off, followed by thick, sugary sweetness and a touch of bitterness at the back of the tongue.\n\nNot very complex, however -- it's mostly just varying levels and characteristics of sweetness. Mouthfeel is marked by slick malts, alcholic heat, and prickly carbonation, with the alcoholic detracting signficiantly. Overall, this beer is nothing exceptional but it does exude the quality this brewer is known for. It's curious to see what this much brown sugar does to a beer. It needs more balance and a bit more complexity to be truly compelling.\n\nExtraStout, Nov 21, 2012\nPhoto of OhioBobcat\n4\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -0.5%\n\nOhioBobcat, Sep 27, 2014\nPhoto of MadScientist\n4.43\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +10.2%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5\n\nA: A medium copper with excellent clarity. A persistent, light-tan head made of small, creamy bubbles. Leaves some lacing on the galss.\n\nS: A strong hops aroma with lot citrus, pineapple, some pine and a some tropical fruit. Blindfolded, think I was about to get into a very nice Double IPA. There is a light malt sweetness and a moderately-strong, flowery alcohol aroma.\n\nT: Tastes like hops candy with an aggressive hops bitterness countered by a moderate malt sweetness and a strong citrus hops flavor. The hops have the same citrus, pineapple and resinous pine flavor noted in the aroma. The malt has a little caramel flavor. All of this is blended with a moderate alcohol that is somewhat sweet. The balance is bitter with a big malt support. The finish is somewhat dry and the aftertaste is of lingering bitterness.\n\nM: Medium-full bodied with a moderately-strong level of carbonation.\n\nO: Lagunitas has always been a true and constant friend of the hophead and this is a good example of their generosity. An assertively bitter American Barelywine with a huge hops bill in the nose, flavor and bittering. bit more sweetness than the average American Imperial IPA.\n\nMadScientist, Dec 08, 2012\nPhoto of jono0101\n4.5\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +11.9%\n\njono0101, May 18, 2013\nPhoto of brownbeer\n4.05\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +0.7%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4\n\nPours clear amber with a small head.\n\nThe nose is a hop bomb. Big, bright, fruity hops, floral with caramel tones.\n\nHop forward in every sense with the body being somewhat syrupy, a hit of brown sugar and sweet caramel malt midway finishing with bitter hop acids while somehow maintaining a chaotic balance.\n\nLagunitas seems to be the hopheads brewery. I thought this would be, not really sweeter because it's sweet, but maybe less hoppy. Awesome stuff that'll sneak up on you if you aren't careful.\n\nbrownbeer, Dec 15, 2009\nPhoto of npala86\n4.25\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +5.7%\n\nnpala86, Nov 26, 2013\nPhoto of kayaeye\n4.15\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +3.2%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5\n\nJust poured this into my Terminator stout pint glass that is the keeper of all my ales.\n\nA - Great caramel color in the glass, with less than a finger head. Fizzes out quickly.\n\nS - Earthy at times, with a sweet aroma to start. A little sense of citrus tickling the nose hairs.\n\nT - At first it was a bit much. the warmer it got the more I wanted. The high ABV is subtle and unassuming. The sweetness lingers on the lips and back of the tongue. Good balancing with the malts.\n\nM - Very easy on the way down. Carbonation is mild.\n\nD - For me the warmer it got the better it seemed. It seemed to expand in the mouth and the heat of the ABV came through. I could drink this all night!\n\nkayaeye, Dec ...

There's roasted malts, a bit of toffee, and a hint of grapefruit.\n\nTaste: The flavors here are really well-balanced. Nice roasted malts with some hops in the background. Coffee and cream slowly come into the mix and lemon & grapefruit come in at the finish and into the aftertaste. While definitely flavorful, there is something nice and subdued here; it isn't trying to knock the drinker over with hops or anything else.\n\nMouthfeel: Incredibly smooth. Medium-bodied and creamy, with only a hint of super-light tingly carbonation. Could possibly be a bit heavier.\n\nDrinkability: For a beer of this style, and this strong, it is extremely drinkable.\n\nIf I were to have one real complaint, it is that it is perhaps too easy to drink! Though rather pricey, it is well worth trying. I'll certainly get some more bottles if I can. To me, this is a perfect definition of what an \"extreme beer\" should be - doing something unusual _and_ making it taste good.\n\n\u00a01,169 characters\n\nPhoto of TheDoorman\n4.79\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +23.5%\nlook: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5\n\nDamn good beer.

Aggressive pour gave a one finger head. Color is light beige and seems creamy. Retention is ok and lacing is really good.\n\nS: The smell is just awesome. Lots of milk chocolate forward with coffee a little bit in the background. Very strong vanilla and molasses. There seems also to have some dark fruits like: black cherries, raisins and over ripe strawberries. A little bit of cinnamon. Some very faint grapefruit and piny resins. Sadly, the overall smell isn't strong enough for the 5.\n\nT: Well, this is nowhere as hoppy as the other ABA I had (Pionni\u00e8re from Dieu du Ciel), but this is mighty tasty. Again, the malts are what dominates here with notes of milk chocolate, powdered cacao, coffee, vanilla and quite a lot of molasses. Some fruits like I said before: black cherries, raisins and over ripe strawberries. Light hop presence in the form of grapefruit and pine resin (but more than in the smell). Again, some spices like cinnamon and cardamom. Again, this was really really good.\n\nM: Very smooth feel with light carbonation. Heavy but so smooth you don't notice it. A little bit sticky. Really drinkable.\n\nO: Well, this was a really smooth and tasty Black IPA. This is definitively more on the imperial stout part of the taste spectrum of the ABA (rather than the IPA side). I really really enjoyed this beer and I can't wrap my mind around the fact the score is lower than what I expected after tasting it. Only the issue of pricing is what I'd consider the reason for the score.\n\n\u00a01,658 characters\n\nPhoto of Stevie_Janowski\n4.75\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +22.4%\n\nPhoto of mdvatab\n4.7\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +21.1%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5\n\nPoured from 12oz bottle into imperial pint glass.\nBottled in 12\/2010\n\nAroma: Malted milk, dark chocolate, earth, & faint mulch aromas.\n\nAppearance: Pitch black body, tan head, cascading foam, dense 3 finger head settles to rocky 2 fingers. Clumpy foam clings to sides of glass.\n\nFlavor: Very malt-forward. Dark chocolate & caramelized sugar. Hops show up in bitterness at end.\n\nMouthfeel: Full body, creamy carbonation, & excellent viscosity.\n\nOverall: I really enjoyed this beer! Just the right amount of carbonation, hops, and body. While it's not what one would call a session ale, I could drink one of these each night and be very happy. If only it were more readily available at a lower cost!\n\n\u00a0697 characters\n\nPhoto of drpimento\n4.67\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +20.4%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5\n\nYammy Mammy! Damn fine beer. Got damn fine beer. Surprised after the bs commercial description. Poured a small tan head with good lace. Color is almost opaque red brown black. Aroma is malt hop yeast.

Pours a thin velvet cappuccino foam. Intense staying power.\nChocolate whafts overpower everything else, hard to tell, but maybe some pine and yeast in there.\nThe flavor Is luxurious, a sucker punch of malt and alcohol, then the long slow embrace of hops. Whets then tingles. It's impossible to escape the coco and java. Belgium yeast is readily apparent as are American hops.\nAmazing beer, so rediculously complex with overwhelming subtleties\n\n\u00a0495 characters\n\nPhoto of Metalmonk\n4.57\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +17.8%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4\n\nA \"Black Belgian Style Double India Pale Ale\" brewed in collaboration with Stone--I love Stone, and am totally on BrewDog's side too, so I was anxious for this one.\n\nPours a tan head, creamy and foamy and with a hell of a lot of firmness to it. Leaves big streaks of lace on the glass. The color is a very deep, deep dark...what...brown? Black? Kind of neither, somehow, as you can see some burgundy-like highlights through it, although it's nearly opaque...can't decide between brown and black, so I'll just call it hella-dark.\n\nNose is wonderful, throwing a remarkably perfume-y hops character over perfectly charred grains which bring to mind coffee and seriously dark toffee.\n\nI had this sitting outside of the fridge for about 30 minutes on a very warm day before drinking it (no A\/C here!), so it's got only the slightest chill on it. Maybe that's why I'm thinking this is tasting so damn incredible right now, because the flavor is full, round, complex and completely satisfying. Notes of chocolate, alcohol, coffee, marshmallow and fig are strongest, although with the hops being perfume-like, fruit-like (mostly pineapple!), herbal and grassy all at once, those brighter elements add a lot more character and make this beer especially complex. Bitter dark roast coffee and an almost dark-fruit tartness sticks around longest in what is a very long finish. As much as I love Belgian and Belgian-style beers, I don't think \"Belgian\" ever when drinking this. So who knows what that's all about, but who cares? As the label says: \"Substance over the scriptures of Style...\" and this has PLENTY of substance.\n\nA little bit sticky, helping the flavors in the finish ride out a long time. This is about as chewy, round and creamy as your finest big stouts out there.\n\nAh geez, this is killer. Maybe a little too rich to make it insanely drinkable, but, damn, yeah, it's killer. I know of no other way to put it, and see no more reason to write about it. Time to just kick back and enjoy this extraordinary, ultra-flavorful, complex beast of a beer.

        "text":"Honey & Pear from Lupicia Tea\n\nHoney & Pear from Lupicia TeaI\u2019ve had a lot of flavored Green Teas over the years, but, not as many flavored Houjicha green teas.\n\nHoujicha (also sometimes spelled Hojicha) is a Japanese green tea that obtains it\u2019s rather unique, toasty flavor from being roasted over charcoal.\u00a0 I love the roasty-toasty flavor of Houjicha, and because it is somewhat lighter in flavor I find it to be particularly enjoyable after meals and quite comforting later in the evening.\n\nHoujicha is also a great alternative for those who find the grassy flavor of most green teas a little off-putting.\u00a0 Instead of tasting grassy or vegetative, Houjicha teas have a sweet, caramel-y taste that is absolutely delicious!\n\nphoto of Japanese Pear from Wikipedia\n\nThe flavor of the Houjicha is the strongest flavor of this cup, but I like how the flavoring of the Japanese pear and honey accent the toasted flavor of the tea.\u00a0 The flavoring is subtle but sweet.\u00a0 The caramel-like tones of the Houjicha meld so well with the pear and honey flavors \u2013 it is truly lovely.\n\nAs the tea cools, I find that the pear flavor pops a little more \u2013 making this an ideal choice for iced tea.\u00a0 I still would prefer this one hot though.\u00a0 I think that the roasted flavor of the Houjicha a very comforting, autumnal taste for me, and I like hot tea in the cooler weather.\n\nLupicia describes this tea as\n\nHoujicha flavored with juicy Japanese pear and honey offers a refreshing fruity taste.\n\nThis tea has it\u2019s own sweet flavor to it that I find it is quite satisfying without the addition of sugar.\u00a0 I really love this blend \u2013 it\u2019s like comfort food in a teacup!\u00a0 Yum!\n\nHoney & Pear from Lupicia Tea\n\nOne Comment\n\n\nNice review I love pear teas mabe this one Is worth a try.

        "text":"Home Free Treats Review\n\n04 September 2009\nFood allergies are a big problem for many families. Nut, egg, milk, and all sorts of other allergies can make finding treats that your kids can enjoy a real challenge. My dear friend Melly's son has food allergies and we often discuss how he misses some of the \"goodies\" his siblings get to eat. If only there was a great tasting treat that met his dietary requirements! I was thrilled to find out that such a product existed when I was asked to review Home Free Treats. We were sent Organic Chocolate Chip and Organic Chocolate Chip Mini cookies to try. I figured my kids would be great taste testers. They have no allergies, but if kids who were not used to eating allergen free, organic, healthy snacks approved...well I figured most kids would.\n\nTristen tried the first cookies and was a bit wary. He said the texture was different. But, upon his second bite he said that they tasted really good. With a glass of milk, he really enjoyed the cookie as an afternoon snack. With Ashley, it was love at first bite. She devoured her cookie and then several of the mini cookies. She informed me we should buy these cookies instead of Oreos. This is high praise indeed! So,m the kids gave them two thumbs up!\n\nI really enjoyed the cookies. They are not overly sweet like a lot of regular store bought cookies are. They have a lovely spice to them, which was a nice change from your everyday chocolate chip cookie. My neighbor Lynette really loved the mini cookies. She loved that 6 cookies had 8 grams of whole grain per serving, only 140 calories, and much less sugar than many \"100 calorie cookie packs\". We both thought they were much more satisfying than other \"low cal\" cookie snack options, making them great for those of us watching what we eat. We both think we would buy these rather than the low cal cookies we've snacked on before.They are much more filling and frankly taste a whole lot better. They have closer to a homemade flavor than any cookie you can buy in a store, which was a pleasant surprise. So, the adults give it two thumbs up as well!\n\nSo, if you are looking for an organic, peanut free, tree nut free, egg free, dairy free snack option I urge you to check out Home Free Treats. They are a fantastic snack option not just for those with allergies, but for all of us. These are treats you can truly feel good about when you give them to your children.",

TOP 3 FAVOURITES (very excellent) 1st - Spectrum Naturals Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (*clean, good taste) 2nd - Dynamic Health Laboratories (*clean, good taste) 3rd - Coconut Secret, Raw Coconut Vinegar (*clean, good taste) 4th - Jarrow Apple Cider Vinegar (*clean, good taste) Disappointments: 5th - Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (*tasted and smelled mouldy!) 6th - Eden Foods, Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (*tasted and smelled mouldy!) We will purchase spectrum naturals from now on. ..........Click YES if this was helpful and feel welcome to read my other reviews\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nA terrific vinegar\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Jun 16, 2012 | Verified Purchase\n\nThis vinegar, which is made from coconut, is better than apple cider vinegar. It does the same things, generally, but is less harsh tasting and has greater nutritional value. A tablespoon dissolved in a glass of water will still prevent bladder infections, improve digestion, create an alkaline environment internally, and even help you sleep. I like it better than acv, although I still use both kinds. I always keep a bottle of this in the cupboard. I can't say enough about how useful this product is.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nMilder than cider vinegar\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Jan 07, 2011 | Verified Purchase\n\nMy husband uses this to help with athritus in his hands. He origionally use cider vinegar which also worked but he finds this one a lot more palatable. This suggests to me that it may be a little more naturally beneficial for the body especially as it is raw.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nDelicious, pleasant tasting milder vinegar in a glass bottle\n\nPosted by PurplePegasus on Jan 04, 2014 | Verified Purchase\n\nIt comes in a glass bottle. Unlike the leading brand of apple cider vinegar with \"mother\" which has a huge hole, this one has a flow restrictor at the tip of the bottle making it easy to pour drop by drop, or shaking and pouring it a bit faster. Taste is delicious, even though it doesn't taste of coconut, it tastes of vinegar, a bit milder than the ACV. I am using a few drops in water upon rising and throughout the day for weight loss. ACV helped me lose weight and I'm hoping this will do the trick as well. I love that it is organic and well priced. Thank you for another great find!\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nFrom Australia\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Aug 29, 2011 | Verified Purchase\n\nI use this vinegar in salad dressings. It is not too strong and makes a very good salad dressing base with oil and the coconut secret sweetener.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n\nPosted by archeiherb on Jul 14, 2016 | Verified Purchase\n\nMiss the BRAGG's apple cider that was a discontinued item on iherb.I'm so lucky to find this coconut vinegar which is completely without any coconut flavor,just like regular vinegar.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nfalse amino acid content data at manufactor`s site\n\nPosted by healthseeker on Sep 11, 2014 | Verified Purchase\n\nIf you visit manufactor`s site, you can find \"amino acid content\" table at it`s site. Data in this table is false. You can see that over 80% of coconut sap are amino acids. This is just impossible.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nFrom Lithuania\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Jan 03, 2012 | Verified Purchase\n\nI really liked this vinegar better than apple vinegar. I am becoming raw foodist and search for products, that are of raw food grade, this what this vinegar is. I use 1 tablespoon of this vinegar with warm water before my main meals a day. It reduces my weight day by day as it speeds up fat burning in the body. You have to combine excercising and food to have the best benefits for loosing weight, but this vinegar is perfect additional remedie for chasing away these useless excess fats:) Very good!\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nCoconut vinegar\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on Jun 08, 2016 | Verified Purchase\n\nThis vinegar taste so much better than apple cider vinegar especially when added with coconut secret raw coconut nectar. I take it cold with ice in the day and hot at night. So addictive\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nawesome taste\n\nPosted by iHerb Customer on May 03, 2017 | Verified Purchase\n\nThis is my favorite vinegar - raw, unprocessed, with live cultures, and it has the best taste of all vinegars! I keep ordering it even though it raises the shipping costs way too much, especially if I want to order more than two bottles at a time.\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n1-10 of 81 total\n\n1 2 3 4 5",

There is a cocoa tan head that sticks in sheets on the glass and some microbubbles that pop out at the surface.\n\nS- The pungent green fresh hop pellets aroma blends with some black char notes and some hints of black roasted malt come through in the finish.\n\nT- The slightly sweet chocolate black roasted malt has an inky quality that grows as it opens and some pungent pine wood bitterness in the finish. There is a mellow char note with some chicory hints underneath and a tart hop note in the finish aswell.\n\nM- The medium-full mouthfeel has a slight slippery finish\n\nO- The mellow char and dark roasted black malts with slight sweetness is strong and nice and the tart green pungent hops are interesting with the chocolate qualities.\n\nPhoto of Brewganja\n4.66\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +16.2%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5\n\nSmooth hoppy, fruity start with a bold chocolate finish. It grabs your taste buds before even hitting them. Amazing mixture of hops. A great dinner stout, light but just as filling as any other stout. A great beer to pair with a meat filled meal. Let it breathe for ten minutes and it tastes more like a stout than an ale.\n\nPhoto of mjc3151\n3.65\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -9%\nlook: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75\n\nPurchased 22 oz. bomber from Three Floyds Brewpub in Munster, Indiana.\n\nStout? More like a Black IPA. It did have some coffee notes, but the mouthfeel and taste had more IPA characteristics than stout characteristics.\n\nThis is a solid beer that people should try. Personally I will not buy this again because there are better and cheaper beers out there, but that should not deter others from trying the beer themselves.\n\nPhoto of alphaacid9000\n3.76\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -6.2%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75\n\nNot what I expected at all out of this one.\n\nDefinitely a FFF beer.\n\nDark brown to black with an off-white head. Excellent lacing\n\nAromas of hops and more hops - pineapple, tangerine and even some apple\n\nFlavor was tough to nail down. Tasted like your normal black IPA but just could not quite nail it down. Very bitter, similar citrus notes as in the nose, hay, slight roast and dark fruit.\n\nOveral - Nice black IPA - Love the artwork.\n\nPhoto of Vonerichs\n3.76\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -6.2%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75\n\nDark brown body with a really nice tan spongy head.\n\nIt's not very aromatic, but it has a scent if piney hops and some light char with a little cocoa.\n\nThe combination of a lighter mouthfeel, higher carbonation, and hop forward contrast with the malt makes it feel more like a black IPA than a stout. The flavors are pine, bakers chocolate, and the finish is a distinct diet root beer.\n\n3F does great hoppy stouts but this one missed the mark for me. Like I said, it's more of a black IPA than a stout.\n\nPhoto of Jaycase\n4.24\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +5.7%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25\n\na: black like toxic sludge. mocha colored creamy, medium sized head\n\ns: roasted maltiness. some dark chocolate. toffee. occasional whiffs of bitter hops\n\nt: piney hop bite at the outset. charred roated malts & dark chocolate come in midway and through the finish\n\nm: full bodied, creamy & chewy. finishes a touch dry.\n\no: I agree with others that this seems more like a Black IPA. For what it is I thought it was quite good and quaffable. Nice roasty and chocolate flavor. If this is what municipal waste tastes like then perhaps we should give it a chance.\n\nPhoto of emerge077\n4.24\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +5.7%\nlook: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25\n\nBrownish black body, mocha colored foam on top, at least an inch or so. Some minimal lacing around the edges, and a broken surface skim.\n\nSoftly hoppy and roasty aroma, the combination reminds me of Alpha Klaus.\n\nBitter and resiny, some citrus peel and roasty char in the background. Medium bodied and smooth, medium carbonation. Resiny green hop aftertaste that sticks in the teeth. Seems more \"black IPA\" than anything, but that's just me. Overall it's enjoyable to drink, regardless of style.\n\nPhoto of smakawhat\n4.33\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +8%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25\n\nPoured on tap into a 4 oz. taster at Pizza Paradiso Dupont DC. From notes.\n\nA light brown tan collar is presented, with a good thin puck. Body is very dark, walnut black to brown and very opaque.\n\nNose has very mild soft roast character, and dense chewy malts hinting at molases and cookies. Softness abounds, with hints of dry powdered milk chocolate.\n\nPalate first sip brings real nice sweet roasting lingering malts. There's a wonderful pine sensation almost spruce with a mix of citrus on the finish. Hints of resin, and more cookie and milk chocolate follow. The roast character builds with good warmth, but strangely the chocolate angle is milky and sweeter as opposed to getting bitter. Feel is solid and fine without a big detraction, but nothing spectacular or serious impressive.\n\nOverall this sort of reminds me of Narwhal in a way, but with a different spin and take with a mild hop angle accenting some citrus slightly on the end. Very nice.\n\nPhoto of mtomlins\n4\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -0.2%\n\nToxic Revolution\nPoured from a bomber into a stemmed tulip glass and shared with friends\nThanks to iguenard for the bottle!\n\nEven after a year-ish of age on this bottle, the hops are still potent, very surprising. A nice deep body, black with a creamy head. As noted, this had a really hop nose along with ample roasted malt, cocoa, dark chocolate. The taste was also very dry from bittering hops as well as dark roasted malts, char, burnt coffee, cocoa nibs. It had a nice round, full mouthfeel and a nice amount of carbonation.\n\nPhoto of ThickNStout\n4.09\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +2%\nlook: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4\n\n22oz bottle from the Three Floyds store (Munster, IN). 10.00. No bottle date but presumably they wouldn't sell old beer at the brewery. Served in a Three Floyds teku.\n\nPours a deep, near-black, brown with two full fingers of dense khaki head. Nice even islands of lace left on the glass as I drink it down.\n\nSmells like an imperial black ale. Big piney and citrus hops with nice charred malts blending in.\n\nTaste follows the nose somewhat but much more complex. It's almost like hoppy chocolate. Pine, chocolate, candied grapefruit peel, milky lactose-like sweetness, charred malts, creamed coffee and mildly floral. A very slight alcohol bite. Really intetesting stradling of stout and black ale.\n\nCreamy and a tad oily medium body with nice soft carbonation. Lingering bittersweet hop chocolate aftertaste.\n\nAnother hopped up treat from Three Floyds. Plenty of tasty roasty sweet stout goodness with more hop character than many IPAs I've tried. Zero problem finishing the bomber on my own in one sitting. I bought one to age but after tasting this I don't think that second bottle is going to last very much longer.\n\nPhoto of brewtus\n4.52\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +12.7%\nlook: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5\n\nPoured into teku. Pours black with a two finger light tan head. Smell is milky, roasty, some chocolate, woody. Taste of licorice, plenty of balanced hops, cedar, lactose, some peppercorn, some dark chocolate. Texture is as expected. Overall this is a great hoppy stout with a lot of dark fruit flavors and tons of back licorice. Very unique, and very enjoyable.\n\nPhoto of qcbeerguy\n2.91\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev -27.4%\nlook: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3\n\nhalf pint at three floydsFloyd's.\n\nblack as midnight, tan head that did not last.\n\ncatty hop aroma, no roast or any other dark aromas.\n\nhoppy taste with a hint of roast behind it\n\nmouthfeel is average at best.\n\na total disappointment of a beer.\n\nthe description is much better than the beer.\n\nPhoto of Rope\n4.04\/5\u00a0\u00a0rDev +0.7%\nlook: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25\n\nPoured into a pint glass.\n\nDark brown, almost black. Looks like a porter, but the head is 2-3 fingers thick and a beautiful tan.\n\nSweet, wouldn't be surprised if there were citra hops in this. The front of the nose is that standard burnt stout.\n\nThe slight tropical fruity taste is quickly overpowered by the bitterness of the stout. Then the hop bitterness overtakes the stout.\n\nLeaves the mouth feeling clean, but the taste lingers a long time. You can roll the taste in your mouth like cigar smoke.\n\nVery interesting, and enjoyable version of an Imperial Stout.

        "text":"Review: Samuel Jones, Exeter | Sugar Pink Food\n\nReview: Samuel Jones, Exeter\n\n\"Based in the heart of Exeter's bustling quayside development, Samuel Jones offers comfortable casual dining and drinking with a fresh and contemporary urban feel.\"\n\nThis area of the quay has also been host to many failed night clubs, pubs and restaurants. \u00a0This particular venue has been left empty for a long time so when I heard that St Austell Brewery had injected over a million pounds to turn it into a new pub restaurant, I was excited to see their vision.\n\nSt Austell has been a family brewery business since 1851, based at St Austell, Cornwall. \u00a0They produce a range of cask ales that are supplied 150 tied houses. \u00a0Samuel Jones is their latest venture and from the minute I looked at the website I was impressed to see that they had really done their research.\n\nSamuel Jones, one-time JP, Alderman, Sheriff and Mayor of Exeter, was a man of the people who worked to bring clean water, regulated power supplies and improved healthcare to those who lived in the city. \u00a0The warehouse location for the pub restaurant was Samuel Jones\u2019 physical legacy to the people of Exeter, as he intended it to revert to city ownership at the end of the 31 year lease taken out by his company, W.L. Jones and Sons in 1878.\n\nThe site was previously owned by the Devonshire Cider Company and housed a marine store and a rag depot before Samuel\u2019s outlay of \u00a32,000 created the building the restaurant occupies today. The inauguration of the warehouse was the event of the year, with the Mayor and elected officials enjoying a feast memorable enough to be mentioned in the Exeter Evening Post 22 years later! \u00a0The family of Samuel Jones were invited to the launch of this restaurant, and were so happy to see his legacy kept alive.\u00a0\n\nThe outside is smart but also in-keeping with the surroundings. \u00a0It has been cleaned up and looks very welcoming, a million miles away from the empty warehouse that has been there for years. \u00a0The inside has a very strong contemporary yet\u00a0urban feel with bare brickwork and lots of wood, and I love the massive bar centre piece.\u00a0\n\nDue to it's unique location it boasts some impressive views out over Exeter's historic quayside. \u00a0They have made the most of this with lots of seating available outside, which will be perfect for the Summer. \u00a0Sadly the weather wasn't that great when we went, but what a view to eat your lunch to!\n\nWe went on a Saturday lunch time and the venue was packed. \u00a0Our waiter was very helpful and explained the menu and drinks on offer. \u00a0We went for a local strawberry & lime cider that was absolutely delicious! \u00a0Their entire menu shows that, where possible, their chefs use fresh local produce, cooked on the premises to create their meals. Their ingredients are grown, reared or caught in and around Devon and Cornwall and they minimise the use of pre-prepared food on their menu- an instant thumbs up from me! \u00a0They also have an exclusive\u00a0robata coal grill which means they can produce amazing smoked and slow cooked meats.\u00a0\nI decided to go for something that normally I avoid when I see it on the menu. \u00a0The reason for this is that I have never had a nice one when eating out- a macaroni cheese. Their macaroni cheese is made with truffle oil, savoury topping and roasted garlic bread. This is easily the nicest macaroni cheese I have ever had in a restaurant. \u00a0There was lots of cheesy flavour and the truffle oil really sets the dish off. \u00a0I really enjoyed it and the garlic bread was perfect for mopping up the delicious cheese sauce. \u00a0The macaroni was lovely and rustic chunky!\nNick really struggled with what to choose. \u00a0The daytime menu is simple but each individual thing sounded so delicious! \u00a0There are hot dishes as well as a selection of sandwiches. In the end he chose to test the robata grill and went for\u00a0Beef Brisket- smoked and cooked for 14 hours served in a brioche roll with smoked tomato & pepper salsa and some chips. When he bit into it there were lots of positive groans. He said that the beef literally melted in the mouth and it was the best he has ever had! \u00a0The chips were chunky and perfectly crispy on the outside and light and fluffy in the middle. \u00a0 A refreshing change is that their sauces on the table were not your standard tomato ketchup. \u00a0The bottles were \"handmade in Devon\" and offered smoked garlic and tomato or spicy tomato sauce. \u00a0The garlic one was next level... so delicious in fact that I had to have some on my plate to dip my bread into!\n\nWe were showed the pudding menu, but as delicious as it looked we couldn't fit anything in. \u00a0We were really impressed with everything about Samuel Jones; from the rich heritage being kept and promoted throughout, locally sourced and fresh ingredients to the helpful and attentive waiting staff. \u00a0The location is fantastic and an amazing atmosphere to eat in. \u00a0I can't wait to go back and try out their evening menu!\n\nFor more info and full menus, please see their website\n\nFood ***** Service ***** Atmosphere *****\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",
