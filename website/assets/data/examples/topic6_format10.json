        "text":"MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA - DECEMBER 12: Lana Del Rey performs at the 2014 Breakthrough Prizes Awarded in Fundamental Physics and Lif\nSteve Jennings\/Getty Images for MerchantCantos\n\nYesterday, a teaser lyric video for Tim Burton's upcoming film Big Eyes featured a stunning title track by none other than the Queen of Movie Music,\u00a0Lana Del Rey. Now, the full audio for both \"Big Eyes\" and another\u00a0Big Eyes song,\u00a0\"I Can Fly,\" have leaked, and the high drama from the two selections seems perfect for the flick at hand.\n\nBoth \"Big Eyes\" and \"I Can Fly\" have the bones of a typical Lana production: Sprawling orchestrations, captivating (to the point of creepy) vocals and lyrics so direct and deep they force you to stop and catch your breath.\n\nBig Eyes\u00a0follows the disintegrating marriage of painter Margaret Keane and her husband Walter, who took credit for Margaret's artwork and presented it to the world as his own. Given the amazing director, the intensity of the plot lines and the Oscar-winning talent involved (O HAI Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz!), Lana's style works perfectly with the soundtrack for what's sure to be an incredible film.\n\nAnd hey, it's not like she's new at this whole \"sing the perfect tune for a massive film\" game: This will be the third major release she's been attached to in the past two years, with \"Young and Beautiful\" serving as the runaway hit of The Great Gatsby soundtrack and her take on \"Once Upon A Dream\" resounding long after the opening weekend of Maleficent.\n\nListen to \"Big Eyes\" and \"I Can Fly\" in full below ...\n\n... And get ready for the theatrical release of Big Eyes on December 25.",

        "text":"Dynasty season 2 spoilers: Dominique Deveraux coming on board\n\nDynastyGiven all of the changes happening these days within the\u00a0Dynasty\u00a0world, it made a certain degree of sense that the CW series unveil someone new, someone iconic to the original series brand. With that in mind, we introduce you now to Dominique Deveraux \u2014 at least the new incarnation for the sake of this show.\n\nAccording to a new report coming in now via DeadlineER\u00a0alum Michael Michele is ready to take this role by the horns through the end of season 2 and, potentially, as a series regular moving forward into season 3. Maybe this role will help to compensate for the departure of Nicollette Sheridan, whose final appearance as Alexis Carrington is coming your way tonight. (If you didn\u2019t hear the reports, Sheridan is departing the series in order to spend more time with her ailing mother.)\n\nSo what do newcomers to the series need to know about Dominique? Check out the character description below \u2014 we think it offers up a pretty good sense:\n\nDominique Deveraux is the matriarch of the Colby family and half-sister of Blake Carrington, a fabulously elegant, self-made woman, known for her outrageous fashion sense and penchant for drama. Dominique will return to Atlanta after a long stint in New York City where she spent the past several years seeking fame and adulation\u2026 to no avail. Now Dominique is home to reconnect with her estranged children, but does she really want to be part of their lives, or will she just disappoint them all over again? And what will the Carringtons have to say about her sudden, mysterious return?\n\nWe can answer that last part for you: The Carringtons are probably going to be upset. Why? Because nobody returns to the world of Dynasty unless they want something \u2026 and they will do virtually everything in their power in order to get it. We expect this here and we also expect her stay to be a fairly memorable one. There\u2019s no telling if we\u2019ll get a new Alexis either this season or next (more than likely, that part will be recast) but until that point, it makes some sense for there to be a new pot-stirrer in the mix. We just don\u2019t think that Dominique is going to be all that eager to forge these reconnections for long. It\u2019s an ego thing. She tried to make it in New York and when she didn\u2019t get that recognition there, she\u2019s doing her best in order to get a little slice of that elsewhere. We don\u2019t exactly think her kids are going to be chomping at the bit for her approval when they feel like she ditched them to begin with.\n\nExpect this part to be juicy. Also, expect for there to be fighting.\u00a0Dynasty\u00a0is a show of secrets, a show of shouting, and a show of shade. We like to think that if they put that on a poster, they\u2019d have an even better shot of a season 3 \u2026 even though the ratings and its international performance were enough to get it a renewal regardless.\n\nWant to get some more information when it comes to\u00a0Dynasty?\n\nThen remember to head over to the link here right now! Remember, a new episode is airing on The CW Friday night.\n\nWhat do you think about this casting? Be sure to share right now in the comments. (Photo: The CW.)\n\nLove TV?

Mountain's episode was shot near La Ceiba, a city in northern Honduras. His partner was police officer Teresa Owens from Satsuma, Fla.\n\nHis wife Blair indicated her support of her husband to the Reno Gazette Journal: \"I think (Mountain) being out there doing something that is tremendously difficult and happening to be trans while doing it is an incredibly public statement that he is not going to let public policy dictate his life and what people in the trans community can and can't do,\" Braverman said. \"Sometimes even I can forget how powerful it is to live visibly.\"\n\nOn his Twitter, Mountain explained why he wanted to be on the show, citing the desire to play an active and non-stereotypical role in public as a trans person:\n\n\"I wasn't drawn to appearing on @NakedAndAfraid despite the nudity requirement--it was an alluring feature. I felt, as a trans guy, that stripping down would be a relief, a way to get it over with & just finally say the unsayable, widely and publicly,\" one tweet in the thread reads.\n\nHe went on to say:\n\"To be an openly trans person doing something beyond transitioning, dating, losing a job, or being harassed in a bathroom\u2014to be in the public square, able to act rather than simply being acted upon\u2014It's a big deal,\"\n\n\"Naked and Afraid\" showrunner Mathilde Bittner told the Gazette Journal that Mountain's survival experience and charisma made him a great candidate for the show, and that she was happy he was open to discussing his transgender identity, though he was given the option to keep it private if he wanted.\n\n\"At the end of the day the people who make it through this challenge are the ones who have the will and the skills,\" Bittner said. \"It really doesn't matter if you are gay or straight or transgendered. If this is something you want to take on, bring it on.\"\n\nWatch a clip from Quince Mountain's episode of \"Naked and Afraid,\" which aired June 16 below:\n\n\nAdd New Comment\n\nComments on Facebook",

        "text":"Firework Fridays\n\nBollywood superstars have locked all festive weekends over the next year, leaving no major Friday for small films.\n\nMumbai,\u00a0November 19, 2012\u00a0| UPDATED\u00a014:25 IST\nFirework Fridays\nBollywood superstars have locked all festive weekends over the next year, leaving no major Friday for small films.\n\nBig film releases have become synonymous with holiday weekends. With every superstar gunning for the Rs 100 crore club with each new release, the Khans, the Devgns, the Kumars and the Bachchans seem have divided the festive Fridays among themselves, although as this Diwali was an example, clash of the titans always remains a possibility.\n\nTill recently, the divide was clear-cut. Eid belonged to Salman Khan, Diwali belonged Shah Rukh Khan while Aamir Khan made mega impact for a while with his Christmas releases.\n\nNot anymore. With only half a dozen festive Fridays at hand and our superstars often releasing more than one film a year, clashes are bound to happen. As it did this Diwali, between SRK's Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Ajay Devgn's Son Of Sardaar. What's more, as the years roll, these big-ticket clashes are bound to get uglier than they did this Diwali.\n\nStrong strategy goes behind the release a film on a festive date. Movies get the benefit of an extended weekend, which in turn rakes in big moolah in a shorter span time.\n\nFilms featuring superstars ride big money, and budgets are on the rise every year. Extended opening weeks help quick recovery and this is easily possible during festive weekends,\" says trade analyst Taran Adarsh.\n\nMost big films are made on a budget of anything between Rs 60 to 80 crore, and they are expected to do business worth Rs 100 crore or more. Smart marketing naturally becomes vital, though it is not always a win-win situation.\n\n\"The number of releases is increasing every year. And not every big film clicks. Festive weekends provide a safety net,\" opines Adarsh. Entertaining content is ultimately the decider. SRK's Om Shanti Om did wonders at the box office on Diwali 2007, but his much hyped Ra.One fizzled out on Diwali 2011. Similarly the Akshay Kumar-Aishwarya Rai starrer Action Replayy flopped on Diwali 2010 though Golmaal 3, released on the same date, was a winner.\n\nIn recent times, 2006 Diwali saw SRK's Don raze Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar's Jaan-e-Mann. Similarly Shahid Kapoor-Rani Mukerji's Dil Bole Hadippa flopped on Eid 2009, the same day as Salman's Wanted became a blockbuster.\n\nToo many releases on the same festive weekend can also spell doom. Diwali 2009 saw a clash between All The Best, Blue and Main Aurr Mrs Khanna. All three films failed.\n\nThe next 12 months or so will see every big Friday opening a mega release. Salman returns with Sher Khan on Eid after taking over Christmas this year with Dabangg 2. Independence Day will see Amitabh Bachchan in Satyagraha, though Akshay Kumar's Naam Hai Boss may also release on the same day. Hrithik Roshan's Krrish sequel is slated for next Diwali, according to the buzz in the industry.\n\nAamir Khan plans to release his next, PK, on Christmas 2013.\n\n(Release dates are subject to change; all figures according to industry estimate)\n\nAjay Devgn\nReturns with: HIMMATWALA during Holi 2013\nOpens on: March 29, 2013\nBudget: Rs 50 crore\n\nThe buzz: Ajay and director Sajid Khan are lining up the remake of Jeetendra- Sridevi's 1983 blockbuster Himmatwala for Holi. Sajid earlier streamed the mahurat shot live on the internet, in a first of sorts. The film introduces Telugu superstar Tamannah Bhatia who will reprise Sridevi's role. Sajid has confidently claimed the film will cross the Rs 100 crore mark within a week. He recently recorded the famous song Taaki o taaki with live orchestra comprising 100 musicians, as it was done in the past.\n\nAjay Devgn, Amitabh Bachchan & Kareena Kapoor\nReturn with: SATYAGRAHA during Independence Day\nOpens on: August 15,2013\nBudget: Rs 50 crore\n\nThe buzz: Prakash Jha's political drama casts Big B as a social activist, said to be based on Anna Hazare. Kareena Kapoor plays an international journalist reportedly inspired by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Ajay Devgn will be seen as Big B's son. Subhash Ghai makes a comeback on the same day with his new romance, Kaanchi. The lead cast is to be decided but Ghai has signed Mithun Chakraborty and Rishi Kapoor for pivotal roles. Akshay Kumar's Naam Hai Boss may also open the same day.\n\nAnushka Sharma & Aamir Khan\nReturn with: PK during Christmas 2013\nOpens on: December 25, 2013 (unconfirmed)\nBudget: Rs 40 crore\n\nThe buzz: Aamir Khan's film 3 Idiots with director Rajkumar Hirani still remains Bollywood's highest grosser. So, when the actor-director duo returns with PK next December, expectations will be sky-high. PK is said to be a satire about corruption in India, with the focus being on the education system. Anushka Sharma pairs opposite Aamir for the first time and the film might have a second hero. Aamir will start shooting for PK after the release of Talaash and once he has completed one more schedule for Dhoom 3.\n\nSalman Khan & Sonakshi Sinha\nReturn with: DABANGG 2 during Christmas 2012\nOpens on: December 21, 2012\nBudget: Rs 50 crore\n\nThe buzz: Returning as Chulbul Pandey, Salman rides huge expectations with Dabangg 2. Sonakshi Sinha returns as Chulbul's heroine Rajjo. Salman has promised a double dhamaka with two item numbers. Malaika Arora Khan will be gyrating to Pandeyji seeti bajaye while Kareena Kapoor joins the circus with a song titled Fevicol. Dabangg 2 promises bigger action and more comedy, Chulbul Pandey- style. Reports say the television rights of the film have already been sold for a whopping Rs 45 crore.\n\nPriyanka Chopra & Hrithik Roshan\nReturn with: KRRISH sequel during Diwali 2013\nOpens on: November 3, 2013 (unconfirmed)\nBudget: Rs 60 crore\n\nThe buzz: Rakesh Roshan reportedly plans to release the new Krrish flick on Diwali and the film brings back son Hrithik in his superhero avatar. Priyanka Chopra returns as the superhero's love interest while Kangna Ranaut and Vivek Oberoi play mutant villains. Hrithik has been sweating it out for the film and was recently injured while shooting. The makers have promised a never- before spectacular for the final hero- villain showdown.\n\nSalman Khan & Angela Jonsson\nReturns with: SHER KHAN during EID 2013\nOpens on: August 8,2013\nBudget: Rs 100 crore\n\nThe buzz: If it's Eid, it's got to be Salman Khan. Continuing his tryst with the festival after 2009's Wanted, 2010's Dabangg, 2011's Bodyguard and this year's Ek Tha Tiger, Salman is readying Sher Khan for next Eid. According to the industry buzz, Salman is set to play the role of a superhero in this film. Although heavy-duty action was initially planned, the script is being reworked to make the film higher on drama and romance given Salman's ailment, trigeminal neuralgia. The buzz is Angela Jonsson (pic left) will play Salman's heroine.\n\n\nFour biggies that have rocked on festive weekends.\n\nDilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge\n\nReleased on Diwali 1995, the film marked the rise of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as Bollywood's best romantic pair lately, besides announcing Aditya Chopra's advent as a director.\n\nKuch Kuch Hota Hai\n\nThe Diwali 1998 release was a hit with youngsters. Karan Johar's debut directorial feature defined new-age campus romance. David Dhawan's Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, released on the same day, became a superhit, too.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n3 Idiots\n\nReleased during Christmas 2009, 3 Idiots is Bollywood's highest-grossing film till date, earning close to Rs 385 crore. The Kapoor comedy based on Chetan Bhagat's bestseller, Five Point Someone, was directed by Rajkumar Hirani.\n\n\nReleased during Eid 2010, Dabanggcatapulted Salman Khan to the No. 1 position. Debutant director Abhinav Kashyap mixed retro-masala action with Hollywoodish western spoof in a small town set-up. Salman's maverick cop Chulbul Pandey has been one of the most unforgettable characters ever.\n\n\nTo get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on\n\nFor news and videos in Hindi, go to \u0924\u093e\u091c\u093c\u093e\u0924\u0930\u0940\u0928 \u0916\u093c\u092c\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0906\u091c\u0924\u0915.\u0907\u0928 \u092a\u0930 \u0906\u090f\u0902.",

        "text":"Local filmmaker sketches French-Jewish cartoonist\n\nIf anyone still thinks comic books or graphic novels are strictly kids\u2019 stuff, a few minutes with Parisian cartoonist Joann Sfar will erase that misconception.\n\nSan Francisco filmmaker Sam Ball\u2019s evocative and marvelous documentary, \u201cJoann Sfar Draws from Memory,\u201d introduces us to the iconoclastic Jewish artist and filmmaker who topped France\u2019s bestseller list with \u201cThe Rabbi\u2019s Cat.\u201d\n\nInspired by his grandmother\u2019s tales of life in Algeria in the 1920s, Sfar set his talking-cat saga in a neighborhood where Jewish, Arab and French traditions coexisted and overlapped.\n\nSam Ball\n\nBall says, \u201cThere\u2019s a line in our film from Joann: \u2018I wanted to show Jewish kids that their ancestors came from North Africa\u2019 \u2014 which is true of about half of France\u2019s Jews \u2014 \u2018and I wanted to remind Muslim kids that there were Jews in North Africa, and they more or less got along for centuries.\u2019 There\u2019s no reason to have nostalgia because it wasn\u2019t idyllic, but there is something that has been lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoann Sfar Draws from Memory\u201d airs on KQED following its appearance in the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival. Sfar\u2019s screen adaptation of \u201cThe Rabbi\u2019s Cat\u201d won the C\u00e9sar for best animated feature last year and is just beginning to reach the U.S.\n\nBall, whose numerous short documentaries include a moody portrait of New York Jewish cartoonist Ben Katchor, \u201cPleasures of Urban Decay\u201d (2000), and \u201cA Bridge of Books\u201d (2001) about the National Yiddish Book Center, was born in France and is fluent in French. He says it\u2019s misleading to view France as an anti-Semitic country, despite the anti-Jewish attacks of recent years.\n\n\u201cFrance, I think, has a complicated relationship toward ethnicity in general,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Jews are unique in that. But there\u2019s a great fascination in mainstream French culture with anything that has to do with former French colonies, and \u2018The Rabbi\u2019s Cat\u2019 fits that craving.\u201d\n\nArtist Joann Sfar at work in a Parisian caf\u00e9 and a drawing (below) from his book \u201cMaharajah.\u201d photo\/sophie constantinou-citizen film\n\nSome of Sfar\u2019s appeal \u2014 and certainly his sensitivity \u2014 stems from the fact that his father is Algerian and his mother is French (with Ukrainian roots), which makes him Sephardic-Ashkenazi.\n\nFor his part, Ball served as associate director of the SFJFF from 1996 to 2000 and started the New Jewish Filmmaking Project \u2014 which he continues to produce through his company, Citizen Film \u2014 with the film festival the following year. His list of current projects includes a film about \u201cPearls of Yiddish Poetry,\u201d the column Yosl and Chana Mlotek wrote for the Forward for many years.\n\nIn other words, Ball is a maven on films about Jewish culture and Jewish artists.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s refreshing to see depictions of Jews that aren\u2019t about gefilte fish or the Holocaust or Yiddishkeit, as much as I love Yiddishkeit,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a movie about the creative process. That\u2019s probably the central preoccupation of the film: How do you take what you\u2019ve been given, both in terms of what\u2019s been handed down to you and your own lived experience. It\u2019s through the act of creation that you grapple with that.\u201d\n\nThe one-hour \u201cJoann Sfar Draws from Memory\u201d is preceded by Ball\u2019s \u201cPeople of the Graphic Novel,\u201d an entertaining, rapid-fire summary of the history and evolution of the comic book. From the creators of \u201cSuperman\u201d to serious artists such as Will Eisner (\u201cThe Plot: The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion\u201d) and Art Spiegelman (\u201cMaus\u201d), Jews played a major role.\n\nWhen Ball embarked on \u201cJoann Sfar Draws from Memory,\u201d he discovered the\n\n41-year-old artist\u2019s vast illustrated diaries filled with the everyday incidents in his young children\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cJoann told me that there\u2019s something Chagall said that really resonates with him: \u2018If you want to keep people safe, you put them in paintings.\u2019 For Joann, he puts them in comic books.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoann Sfar Draws from Memory\u201d screens at 10:30 a.m. Sunday, July 29 at CineArts in Palo Alto and airs that night at 11 p.m. on KQED Channel 9.

At $28 million in receipts, The Final Destination cruised to #1, and raised the question: Will this be yet another Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter situation where the supposed franchise-ender will not be anywhere close to the last entry? Look for Final Destination: A New Beginning in theaters two years from now, perhaps in mind-blowing 4-D.\n\nThe Weinstein Company\u2019s counterintuitive strategy to siphon off viewers from its own movies paid off\u2014or didn\u2019t\u2014with Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Inglourious Basterds holding strong at #2 in its second weekend with $20 million (total gross now at $73 million and counting) and Zombie\u2019s Halloween II putting in a relatively strong showing at #3 to the tune of $17.4 million. It\u2019s hard to say whether the Weinsteins would have benefited by putting more distance between its releases, but their troubled company finally has some good news to report. Rounding out this week\u2019s wide (or in this case, semi-wide) releases, Ang Lee\u2019s Taking Woodstock rode middling reviews to dismal box office, limping in at #9 for $3.7 million.\n\nIn limited release, The September Issue, a documentary profile of Vogue editor Anna Wintour, was a massive hit at $40,000 per screen, cruising on the interest drummed up by the Wintour-inspired book and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Big Fan also enjoyed a healthy $13,000 per screen average, the second best in the specialty market. Both films are rolling out\u2014Big Fan more slowly than The September Issue\u2014to other cities within the next couple of months.\n\n\nMore detailed numbers at Box Office Mojo.",

Markle's half-sister has come forward in a shocking new interview, calling the Suits actress \"shallow, narcissistic, and bent on social climbing.\"\u00a0\n\n\nSamantha Grant, Markle's 51-year-old sister who lives in Florida and is suffering from multiple\u00a0sclerosis, gave three different interviews in the last week, bashing her younger sister who she claims she raised herself. After talking to UK's\u00a0Mirror about Markle, Grant told the Sun that her half-sister has always wanted to be a princess and has a soft spot for redheads. Grant then spoke to Radar Online and unleashed on her sibling.\u00a0\n\nMore from CafeMom:\n\n\"The royal family would be appalled by what she's done to her own family,\" Grant told Radar. \"The truth would kill her relationship with Prince Harry.\" Grant didn't get specific, but she continued to bash her sister, saying, \"He wouldn't want to date her anymore because it puts her in a bad public light. I certainly don't think Harry or his family would want to associate with her afterwards.\"\n\nIt's certainly no surprise that people are coming out of the woodwork, attempting to out any skeletons humanitarian Markle may have in her closet. But giving three interviews in a week -- interviews that state nothing other than \"she's narcissistic\" -- is shady, and likely will be dismissed by everyone.\u00a0\n\nThat said, regardless of whether or not people believe Grant, Prince Harry's relationship with Markle is sure to draw some criticism from the royal family. After all, Markle is an actress, she's a few years older than Harry, and she has already been married before. Slightly different from Kate Middleton.\u00a0\n\nThe heart wants what it wants, though, and if Harry and Meghan are the real deal, there's no stopping them. Eventually, the royal family will come around and she'll be yucking it up with the queen's corgis at Balmoral on Christmas. It just might take some time.\u00a0\n\n\nImage via\u00a0Splash News\n\nRead More >",

We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands.\u201d\n\nRegarding Mr. Turner, Jackson says, \u201cAidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I\u2019m sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kili.\u201d\n\nThrow in some rumored star turns from David Tennant (!!), Bill Nighy, Stephen Fry, Andy Serkis, and James Nesbitt, and you have a potential ensemble that\u2019s almost embarrassingly amazing.
