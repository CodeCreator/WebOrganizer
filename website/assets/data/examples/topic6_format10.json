Public humiliation, sexual assault and laughing at dead bodies are all part of the YouTube shock repertoire, but a YouTube personality who calls himself \u201cArab Andy\u201d managed to find the limits of both good taste and the law with his latest stunt.\n\nAccording to University of Washington police, a man \u201cwalked into a classroom in Savery Hall on the University of Washington campus, filming with a phone in his hand.\u00a0He asked for everyone\u2019s attention and a pre-recorded message emitted from a speaker on his jacket, announcing something to the effect of \u201cThe C4 is charged\u201d and a countdown began. People ran from the room and activated the fire alarm on their way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were in a reception in our conference room \u2026 listening to our chair talk about our year\u2019s worth of stuff \u2026 then this man, who was about six foot one comes in the doorway and says \u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t recognize him, so I say are you supposed the be here \u2026 then he didn\u2019t really say anything but then he pushed a button that said, \u2018Attention, attention, attention\u2019 then there was a long gap and it said \u2018C4 device activated, the countdown has begun,\u2019\u201d a faculty member told the campus newspaper.\n\nA livestreamed video from \u201cArab Andy,\u201d since taken down by YouTube but found by\u00a0Gizmodo, shows \u201cArab Andy\u201d walking into a classroom, and you can clearly here the audio playing from a speaker. The streamer apparently made it out of the building without anyone interfering, but a later clip shows police arresting him on a sidewalk. During the arrest, \u201cArab Andy\u201d told police \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing. That was TTS [text to speech]. That was a donation.\u201d\n\n\u201cArab Andy\u2019s\u201d main gig is allowing viewers to pay small amounts of money for him to play a media clip of their choice through a speaker in public places. According to\u00a0Gizmodo, a donation of just $4.20 was responsible for the fake bomb stunt.",

It follows beautifully-dressed Anna Kendrick when she goes from one club to another with three guys. \"At midnight, she came to collect the souls of the wicked men,\" so it was explained. Director David Ayer furthermore said, \"In this world, Anna's sort of this shape-shifter, I guess you could say.\"\n\nAs for message behind the video, Ayer had this to say to MTV, \"No matter how big you are, how important you are in this temporal world of ours, there's somebody more important. You have to answer for your sins, and that's a little bit of what this video is about. And the person who sort of represents the power in this video isn't, like, some hardcore gangster guy, but little old Anna Kendrick kinda being her shy self.\"\n\n\"Pow Pow\" appears in LCD Soundsystem's third studio album \"This Is Happening\" which has been on sale since May this year.\n\nLCD Soundsystem's \"Pow Pow\" music video\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nRequired fields are marked with *\n\n\n\n  1.

I wondered how I could find the stamina to perform it with an audience close by,\" she says.\n\nGalvin is playing the lead in Lorilei - A Meditation on Loss by Tom Wright, a dramatisation of a woman's attempt to save the killer of her six-year-old son from the death penalty. \"I have always been opposed to the death penalty,\" Galvin says. \"But you always wonder how you would feel about it if someone you loved was murdered.\"\n\nLorilei is the second death-row play by Wright and the director, Nick Harrington, who took the critically acclaimed This is a True Story from La Mama to London in 2001.\n\nThe production, which featured Wright as a death-row inmate with an IQ of just 54, was highly praised by the Guardian newspaper and Time Out magazine.\n\nBut Harrington says the spur for the new show was the opportunity to explore the issues from a fresh angle, using interviews and court transcripts. \"This is from the perspective of someone who suffered grievously when her six-year-old son was murdered, (who) rose above the barbarism of the death penalty,\" he says.\n\nHarrington, who worked as a volunteer lawyer at an anti-death penalty centre in New Orleans five years ago, met Ricky Langley, the man convicted of the crime, when he was on death row. \"I spent a couple of hours with him in jail on the same trip that I received the diary that became the basis for True Story.\"\n\nHe had no intention of dramatising the case, but Langley won an appeal on a technicality and a re-trial was held earlier this year. The play unfolds as a mystery, with the audience uncertain of the result until the conclusion.\n\nHarrington was impressed by the stand taken by the boy's mother, Lorilei, who asked that her full name be withheld. \"She didn't have to get involved, and, after taking a stand, she received real heat from the district-attorney prosecuting the case and even from members of her own family.\"\n\nLorilei had to travel about 1500 kilometres from South Carolina, where she moved after the murder, to attend court proceedings in Louisiana, but the district-attorney refused to pay her a living allowance until ordered by the presiding judge.\n\n\"She wasn't playing the expected role as the victim's mother,\" he says. \"As a result, she believes the only person who has supported her is her 11-year-old son.\"\n\nActress Anna Galvin was emotionally touched by the story.\nPicture: Shannon Morris\n\nBut the woman's stand even confused Langley's defence lawyers, who claimed in a submission that she had forgiven him for the murder.\n\n\"That wasn't true. She has never forgiven him, but she does not believe in the death penalty. She believes in grace and doesn't want his life taken in her son's name,\" he says. \"What she does say is that her son would have forgiven him.\"\n\nLorilei blames the system for releasing Langley into the community after an earlier conviction, even though he warned he was not in control of his impulses.\n\nWhen he killed the boy, he believed he was killing a dead brother whom he claimed was ordering him to commit evil deeds. Harrington says Lorilei went on a binge of drugs and alcohol after the murder in New Orleans in 1992; she was pregnant with her second son.\n\nThe Bible featured in her rehabilitation therapy but Harrington says he is not sure how religious she is.\n\n\"God hangs in the air, as he does in a lot of southern stories,\" Harrington says. \"But I think she believes in every person's right to be given an opportunity to be redeemed.\"\n\nGalvin, who studied drama in Oxford after graduating from Melbourne University, was visiting her family when Harrington showed her the script. Most of her previous work was in television series such as The Sentinel, and while she was intimidated by the power of the script, she welcomed the chance to return to the theatre.\n\n\"Los Angeles nearly killed my passion for acting,\" she says. \"The quality of a lot of television scripts is soul-destroying.\" She has concentrated on getting Lorilei's accent right, after speaking to her on the phone. \"Her tenacity is amazing, and I don't want anything to get in the way of people appreciating that,\" she says. \"She wasn't lucky enough to have a huge education and she is not super articulate but she showed amazing courage.\"\n\nLorilei is keen to see the production but it is organised on a non-profit basis so can't cover the air fare to bring her to Australia.\n\n\"But True Story toured to London and I would love to take Lorilei to North America where it would be possible for her to see the show,\" Galvin says.\n\nWhen the season ends, she intends to return to the scripts she is working on - one a romantic comedy she hopes will be a money spinner, and the other an historical drama she has been researching for five years.\n\n\"I would love to see it developed as a co-production with Australia because I would love to get back here with a professional base,\" she says.\n\nLorilei opens at La Mama tonight and runs until November 9. Internationally-renowned human rights lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, will answer audience questions after tomorrow's show and on Friday.

November werden die Thrasher Witchery ihr neues Album \u201cIn His Infernal Majesty\u2019s Service\u201d via Century Media Records ver\u00f6ffentlichen. Parallel dazu k\u00fcndigt Chefdenker Jensen auch ein neues Line-up an.\n\n\u201cWe've sadly had to part ways with two members prior to this album; long time band member Martin Axenrot and live member (and recording member-to-be) Emperor Magus Caligula. Martin's departure is purely down to him being too busy with his other musical endeavors and Caligula had to leave the band over an unfortunate medical condition involving his hearing. These are both serious losses for the band and we wish them all the best in the future. We have however been able to find more than able replacements for our two lost brethren: Chris Barkensj\u00f6 on the drums and Angus Norder on vocals. They both bring fresh blood and fresh ideas to the band and you can clearly hear that they both have made it necessary for us \"old members\" to step up our game a notch or two!\u201d\n\n\u201cMusically, I wanted to make this album more raw than the previous ones. Perhaps as raw as the first album even. I really didn't want to over-work things, as I myself enjoy music that comes more from feeling and enthusiasm than music that has been contemplated and construed. This album is recorded by Daniel Bergstrand at his Dug Out Studio in Uppsala, Sweden. Even though Daniel has been a high profile name for ages within the Metal community, I've never had the opportunity to work with him before. I have to say that Daniel is really easy to work with. All around a great guy and he immediately understood what I was looking for production-wise when I spoke to him about the album. My main request was that I wanted a raw and unpolished production. I really dislike productions where you can hear that the band has had ages to complete just one song. Where there might be a month's worth of coffee breaks between the guitar takes etc. I wanted it to sound like a real band that is playing together. My second request was that I wanted the drums to sound like on Van Halen's \"1984\" album. I seriously love that aggressive middy drum sound. I think Daniel did an amazing job and I know that he rates this production very highly on his own personal list of albums he's worked on\u2026\u201d\n\nHier sein Kommentar zum Coverartwork:\n\n\"Long-time friend of the band - and designer of many things associated with WITCHERY - Andreas Diaz Pettersson was once again called upon to create the artwork for our new album. He has a great ability to create artwork that really stands out within the scene, without compromising on quality or with the essence of the band. We are very pleased with what he has created for us, and we think the artwork is a great addition to the overall massive quality and appeal we truly believe this album to have.

Just one day after her ex-wife demanded a raise in spousal and child support, the \"I'm the Only One' singer fired back by filing her own court documents in which she calls her ex-wife \"angry and vindictive.\"\n\nOffering proof of Michaels' nastiness, Etheridge included an e-mail sent by the former \"Popular\" actress. \"Children should really be placed first, Melissa, I encourage you to try it this time around with these two of your children,\" the letter read. \"You know, Melissa, that I did not give birth to these two children to give them away to your various staff members and girlfriends to raise.\"\n\nIn the e-mail, Michaels allegedly also told Etheridge, \"You have to support so many households because you BROKE SO MANY HOUSEHOLDS, silly. If you had decided to have one ounce of integrity\/honesty as a person or partner, you would NOT be in this predicament. Think about it.\"\n\nAside from that, Etheridge also accused Michaels of accidentally burning son Miller Steven with a cigarette. Therefore, she is asking a judge to install a smoking ban for both Michaels and herself whenever they are around their twins. \"The children have allergies and I am concerned about their exposure to second-hand smoke,\" she added.\n\nIn her custody-related documents, the two-time Grammy winner additionally requests for more time with the kids since she believes Michaels is against an equal custody deal. On the reason behind the thought, the \"Come to My Window\" crooner said that her ex has accused her of not having the \"maternal instinct\". A hearing is set for May 22.\n\nMichaels herself filed a settlement conference brief on Monday. In it, she claimed she needs more than the $23,000 per month to live on because she grew accustomed to living at over $128,000 a month during her long-term relationship with Etheridge, and now \"has limited income and virtually no savings.\"\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nRequired fields are marked with *\n\n\n\n  1.
