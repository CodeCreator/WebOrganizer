Ahhh...all gorgeous tags! Love them ALL!\n\n  2. These are SO beautiful! Each one of them is stunning in its own ways, Emily! My favorite is the white embossed holly!! You should enter this challenge (tag-themed) as well: http:\/\/cas-ualfridays.blogspot.com\/2011\/11\/cfc28.html\n\n  3. They are beautiful tags but unfortunately these were created before our challenge was began on the 11th at CAS-ual Fridays :) We'd love to have you create more so you can play in the challenge!\n\n  4.

Such is the case with the above card produced by Leanin\u2019 Tree. After ten years, the edges are a bit dog-eared but I remain mesmerized by Darryl Trott\u2019s art; particularly now that I have discovered Key West! This piece could have been painted in a dozen locations throughout the Keys yet it was inspired and created in Australia. On the back of this Leanin\u2019 Tree card is a testimonial written about Darryl many years before his untimely death on 9th June 2004 following a heart attack,\n\n\u201cOne blustery day in Australia, Darryl Trott, with a roll of paintings under his arm, felt the wind holding back his bicycle as he rode to his job as an advertising designer. In his frustration, Trott realized he also felt stymied in his career and so, he resolved to leave his job and concentrate on painting. Largely self-taught, Trott is still perfecting his style of depicting the exotic and everyday blooms he paints.\n\nLuscious tropical orchids sparkle with dew and perky, spring crocus thrust up from the barren ground. Each painting explodes with a mass of blooms. Darryl Troll believes that flowers should be painted in their natural habitat, as their subtle shades of color alter when they are cut. The artist maintains a home in the United States but spends much of his time painting in his retreat near the rain forest in Australia. Trott explores the infinite variety of flowers found throughout both countries, in cultured gardens as well as open fields.\u201d\n\nLimited Edition prints of Darryl\u2019s work are still available.\nIf you google his name, several sites offer his work.\nOur favorite is: www.ozimagesgallery.com\/g-darryl-trott.html\n\n\nPattie Mosca said...\n\nThis is so peacefully beautiful..I can see why you could not part with it!!!!!!!!!!\n\nCheryl Finley: said...\n\nThis is gloriously enchanting...I feel like I could walk right into this and become a part of its transluscent and luminous beauty. I will come back to visit this vision often Royce.\nThank you for the portal!\n\ntj said...\n\nI saw his work in a gallery in Australia...absolutely and utterly beautiful! You feel as though you can walk into one of his paintings.",

Needlepoint of all the places you've puked in public anyone? \u00a0Ok, not funny. I had pretty much forgotten about the blog until today.\n\nI had my eureka moment when I realized that I already had the venue to use my new map making ideas! \u00a0Maybe you wouldn't think of a map and recipe as going hand in hand, but I think that's perfect! \u00a0I'm looking for a challenge, some constraints, a focus. I see my blog, with new life, as a post accompanied by a map. \u00a0Hand drawn most likely, but maybe collaged, stitched, knit, whatever. \u00a0I'm sure you can tell I'm all about the analog!\n\nI also was thinking about maps as a way to tell stories and how to intertwine maps with narrative. \u00a0I instantly thought of Dora the Exporer, where every episode is essentially a narrative, planned out in a map. \u00a0Check out this youtube video (on mute if you enjoy your sanity) to see what I'm talking about. \u00a0I think this could be a good starting point for posts that have a story behind them.\n\nThis is my hand drawn map of my walk to work every day, which takes about ten minutes:\n\n\nPlease sign in or sign up to comment.",

        "text":"Portrait Photography\n\nPortrait photography is one of my favorite types of photography; I think its because I have always loved studying artist pantings and how some of these incredible artists captured the light but mainly (Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) captured the person, their inner soul in oil.\n\nI remember a few years ago, we went on a holiday to Crete and my wife had her portrait sketched by a young guy and it was incredible how he captured my wife's personality perfectly, the detail was perfect, he caught on canvas the smile and look that I knew so well and only someone truly skilled could see.\n\nPhotography is all about seeing the person as they truly are, it involves not just looking but really seeing that person through the lens of the camera.\n\nTo be a real artist with the camera, you have to study the person in an instant and help the camera create the image that you see in front of your eyes, it quite often requires you moving to maybe a different side of the shot or helping the subject look in another direction.\n\nMany people say they hate having their photograph taken because they feel they never look good in photographs, (I must admit I'm the same) but this is due to people not capturing the personality of that individual and not studying the person before firing the shutter.\n\nI recently took some photographs of this beautiful Bride (Jessica)\u00a0and I found it incredible how she would look so different depending on where I stood to take the photo (Images shown here) this is so true when taking portrait photos or wedding photographs.\n\nSo many of my Brides say how they have never had such amazing photos taken of them, one such Bride said \u201cI cant believe its me, I look lovely\u201d this is down to composure, looking for the light and being a part of the photograph before you fire the shutter.\n\nSo learn to look and not just see and you will find that you too can capture the real person in the portrait.",

        "text":"Sunday, March 09, 2008\n\nThe Daily Drawing\n\nI started another blog on January 1st called The Daily Drawing, taking heed of an art school adage about 'doing a drawing every day'. I've made it simple and small, and I have done one drawing every day - 69 drawings so far at 7 x 7 cms, all in black on pre-cut squares of heavy etching paper that I had lying around. It's been a good way to use up scraps! I don't do any philosophising on the blog - no titles other than the date of the drawing, and no commentary... and I thought it would become a chore when I started out, but it's quite the opposite. In fact, these little drawings may be the most important work I'm doing at the moment.\n\nFor one thing, I have to cast my anxieties aside. There isn't room to fit anxiety into 7 square centimetres, but anyway you can't be precious about a drawing that size. My stepson asked me how I decided where to start drawing on each square, and the answer is that I don't make a conscious decision, mostly I just put my pen down until it touches the paper and start drawing, and the end of the image is wherever the edge of the square happens to be. Tiny things though they are, these little squares have freed me up. The rules are quite simple: I'm not allowed to edit, I'm not allowed to accumulate drawings on a different day to the date of that drawing (no cheating! It's one drawing each day), and if I don't like the outcome I have the option of turning the square of paper over and starting again on the other side, but I can't throw it away and get another square - I scored and tore 370 pieces of paper, so there are only 4 spares in case I'm travelling and lose my bag or something. I guess if I'm travelling and lose my luggage I might be allowed to re-draw the ones I've lost, but I'll decide about that if and when it happens.\n\nThe benefits of doing this have been huge. For one thing, it's started me drawing again, and in a much less self-conscious way. I've been drawing in cafes, Ella's riding\/ballet\/piano\/swimming lessons, while waiting in the car, just before I go to bed, while I'm cooking... anywhere, really. And it's been fun. And I've been looking at what I'm drawn to draw and it's been quite illuminating. I'm drawing what I see around me. Not with a purpose in drawing a particular thing or in a particular style, nor with the object of presenting myself or my life in a certain way. I draw what catches my eye, and often it is little things: the way block lettering on a magazine cover falls down a page and the letters beneath each other form a random line with irregular spacing... the way in which a tiger on a bag of rice is drawn using lines, not sketched in an anatomically detailed sort of way... how the thatched roof of a cabana contrasted with the shapes of the leaves next to it... how the cheese board looked once I'd laid the table when friends were late coming over for dinner... the pattern on my daughter's flip-flops.\n\nSo I wonder if I should be painting the same things. Maybe next year's project should be a painting a day! Colour would bring added complexity to the idea, although it would be more difficult to paint spontaneously in a cafe... No, I'm thinking that this is all a scaled down version of my view of life. If I find it hard to paint because I'm not sure what I'm trying to 'say', perhaps I should look at these little pictures and recognise that 'my style' is in them. What I'm drawing is what I'm trying to say, so perhaps I should try painting it as well. There are plenty of other artists who paint domestically, as it were. What about Morandi? And there's an Australian artist whose work I really like called Peter Atkins, some of whose source material apparently comes from things like packaging that he sees around him.\n\nTime I loosened up in paint, anyway, and did some experimenting.\n\n\nSnippety Gibbet said...\n\nI enjoy looking at your daily drawings. Little vignettes with such a beautiful, simplicity of line. It makes me want to keep my own little sketch pad with me all the time.\n\nscb said...\n\nThanks, Snippety! Kind words... I'd get that sketch pad out! Doing those little drawings has just been brilliant for me, and although there's a long way to go before the end of the year, I can see myself reconfiguring the project in 2009 to allow myself to continue drawing like that every day. Sara x\n\nJan said...\n\nPeter Atkins is one of my absolute favs! He is so inspirational. I like your blog too. I'm off to checkout the Daily drawing one now. And yes, you've (almost) inspired me to try this.\n\n\nRelated Posts Widget for Blogs by LinkWithin",

        "text":"The Visual Art Of Looking Good Grooming Workshop - My Signature Programme Logo\n\nThere will always be some things that we want to do but have been putting it off as other issues crop up all the time. One of them is to come up with the logo design for one of my signature programmes - The Visual Art of Looking Good. Yes, as most of you may already know, it is my 1-day grooming workshop. I've done four runs of it this year and look forward to receive more participants come 2011.\n\nHaving a logo for each of my workshops and programmes is important. As every workshop programme is different, each logo too is designed differently as the logo itself helps to brand and \"sell\" the workshop programme.\n\nHaving mulled over for a while and coming up with different designs, I've finally decided to go with this one as it connects most with me.\n\nUnveiling the winning logo design...\n\nAs ladies make up the majority of my participants, it only felt natural to use a lady's face. But then you can't see the entire face as she eyes with her subtlety and confidence. For all my male supporters out there, fret not. If the number of guys enrolling for the workshops pick up, I'll design a male version of this logo as well :)\n\nIn every workshop, it is also my hope (together with the participants') that everyone receives a breakthrough towards the end. The breakthrough can come in any form - whether it be the certain realisation that you have been getting it wrong all these years by way of wearing your worst colours or that particular aha moment that you are now more appreciative of your own body's unique assets. There is no better way to represent transformation than using a butterfly. The butterfly's metamorphosis from the ugly caterpillar to the beautiful creature it now is is the essence of the entire workshop - just come spend a day with me, and be enriched and wowed by what you can literally see in your own transformation when you walk away.\n\nFinally, while the stripes are aesthetically pleasing to most, they also create a playful and fun environment under which learning takes place. You can associate this to a real piece of visual art.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n\nPin It\n\nRight Click\n\nNo right click",

        "text":"Thursday, October 10, 2013\n\nMy Fuji X-E1 thinks its a Hasselblad\n\nTaken with a Samsung Galaxy III\n\u00a0After playing with the new 27mm Fuji pancake lens for awhile, I changed the camera to record RAW + jpg in black & white mode. I find myself creating more abstract images this way, and it reminds me of when I used my Hasselblad 500C. Loved that camera and the square format. Now I have it again with the X-E1.\n\nHere are a few shots I did over the past few days. Many of them are complete abstractions. Others border on abstraction, and some are just straight. I used to see and create differently with the Hasselblad and find myself doing the same thing with the Fuji.\n\nBlur shot of the city at night\n\nThe nice thing about shooting in both RAW and jpg is that I still have the full RAW information if I want to change my mind and go back to color.\n\nAbstract lights out of focus.\n\nNo comments :\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text":"Under Westminster Bridge\n\n\nIt\u2019s always important to keep an open mind and learn from other photographers. While in London, I took a walk along the South Bank and noticed another photographer crouched in the passageway under Westminster Bridge. He had found the perfect angle for the situation and I took over his spot after he left. The low winter sun bouncing off the warm stone gave a lovely glow and the view of the Palace of Westminster through the archway was very nice. I didn\u2019t have my tripod, so this was a handheld shot at 100 ISO and f6.7, with a shutter speed of 1\/90. Usually that is too slow, but I braced myself on the wall behind and tried to hold my breath as I took the shot. To my surprise, it turned out reasonably well. I tried to bring out the warm tones a little in LR and overall, I really like the end result.",

        "text":"A Celebration of Cranes, Willows and Wetlands Centre, November 2014. Image by Nisha Haq\n\nLast weekend I got to witness the illuminated finale of many months hard work and the atmosphere was truly celebratory and even a little festive.\n\nSaturday was a stunning day with clear skies and surprisingly warm for late November, perfect weather for the evening\u2019s planned procession at The Willow and Wetlands Visitor Centre in Stoke St Gregory. On my arrival I must admit I was a little apprehensive parking in a field that already looked suspiciously muddy and may prove tricky to drive out of later in the dark, however the tractor parked by the gate was reassuring, these guys were prepared to tow us out if need be and after all this is Somerset, home to the best events that seem to always take place in barns and muddy fields!\n\nI was greeted in the big barn being used for rehearsals by the two crane sculptures that were made during Somerset Art Works Open Studios. The pair were busy perfecting their \u2018Crane Walk\u2019 and the logistics of rubbing beaks without colliding or completely missing one another. Each crane had a team of 5 people to ensure that it processed safely and elegantly; flapping it\u2019s black feather fringed wings as it danced along.\n\nThe cavernous space within the barn soon began to fill as children from North Curry, Stoke St Gregory and Heathfield schools started to arrive and claim the various lanterns, headdresses and costumes that they had made under the guidance of artist Sarah Butterworth. You can read about one of their recent workshops here. Of course children do not tend to travel unaccompanied, so relatives and friends soon found themselves also carrying a dragonfly lantern and joining the procession \u2013 my Ma being one of them, she had a fantastic time.\n\nTo accompany this hive of activity and the last minute technical issues of insuring all the lanterns were lit was the sound of The Big Noise Street Band who were warming up and rehearsing for the first time with the children from Stoke St Gregory School who were to sing a song that they had written especially for the occasion. Leaving all the commotion, excitement and nerves behind I headed out to find a spot to watch the procession\u2026\n\nDue to start at 4.30 it wasn\u2019t actually that dark, Dusk was just beginning as the spectacle began and it was lovely to witness the lanterns glowing against the subtle colour change of the sky \u2013 a silhouette of a tree, heavy with mistletoe formed a serene and natural festive backdrop. In contrast the music was up beat, the children\u2019s song they had written full of fun and the audience clapped and revelled in the spectacle celebrating all the hard work that had gone into making the costumes, headdresses, lanterns and music. At this point in the proceedings I thought that if I did get stuck in a muddy field and had to get the car towed out by a tractor it would have been worth it and would only add to the evening\u2019s adventure!\n\nAs for the cranes at the centre of all these glowing celebrations they were obviously oblivious to the dancing puppets, but I am sure if they had been close by instead of settling down somewhere safe for the night, they too would have been rubbing noses and swirling to the beat of the band.\n\nCongratulations and thanks must go to the many volunteers and school pupils who took part in the Great Crane workshops, everyone who took part in the procession, SAW\u2019s Beccy Swain for coordinating the entire project, artist Sarah Butterworth for organising all that glue, tissue and willow, and of course our hosts for the evening, Nicola and Jonathon Coate at the Willows & Wetlands Visitor Centre, I am sure everyone went home with a smile on their face.\n\n\nDo check out THE GREAT CRANE BLOG for past, present and future community arts projects and events\n\nPublished on December 15, 2014 \/\/ Zoe Li\n\nSAW Blog\n\nWelcome to the\u00a0SAW Blog.

        "text":"Discover The Fascinating Cats Let Nothing Darken Their Roar 2011 Calendar!\n\nI know that you might not understand the calendar's title yet.\u00a0 Just bear with me and I promise it will be worth the wait!\n\nIf you love art, design and type, you're going to swoon for the Cats Let Nothing Darken Their Roar 2011 Calendar, as I have.\n\nSince 2006, Noa Bembibre has created these fascinating calendars that are comprised of phrases that include the letters of the month. Take the title for instance. If you highlight certain letters, you'll see a word form: Cats Let Nothing Darken Their Roar. Isn't that amazing?!\n\nNoa started out with making just 30 copies back in the beginning and now makes a limited edition of 500 copies.\n\nThe calendar is printed in four colours on 16.5\" x 11.6\" matte paper, finished with signature black ribbon binding and silver print packaging.\u00a0 And for the first time, the 2011 calendar includes a little black pencil, made exclusively for CLNDTR by Viarco in Portugal.\n\nThe 2011 Edition is unfortunately sold out (you can share mine in the meantime!), but you can sign up to be notified of the latest releases.\n\nThere aren't many wall calendars that you keep the pages well after the year's passed. This one, you will.\n\nStephanie Dickison\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 the knack | Stephanie Dickison 2017.",
