The symposium consists of four sessions; \u201cCritical ocean issues in Asia and Oceania\u201d, \u201cImpacts of ocean pollution in Asia and Oceania\u201d, \u201cImpacts of climate change on the oceans in Asia and Oceania\u201d, and \u201cImpacts of human activities on fisheries in Asia and Oceania\u201d. In the afternoon of November 12, a special talk will be given on \u201cHow science communities could help secure marine ecosystem and fisheries production in Asian and Oceanian countries\u201d (tentative) by a special guest from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).Oceans and their services mean much to Asian and Oceanian countries where the people rely heavily upon fish and shellfish as protein source, and the cultures are tightly linked with the oceans. It is therefore very unfortunate that some of these countries suffer from serious pollution problems of the coasts, and several are predicted to be highly vulnerable to future oceanic environmental alterations, such as climate\nchange. Nevertheless, not much effort has been given to project potential alterations of ocean environment and ecosystem, and consequent impacts on fishery production of the regions. Adaptation measures against negative human impacts require accurate understanding of how marine environment 1ill be affected, how marine ecosystem will respond, and how fishery production could be optimized under predicted conditions. Our goal is to identify the most pressing issues on the oceanic environment, ecosystem and fisheries of the regions, to contribute to elaborating adaptation measures, and thereby to help protect livelihood of the people living in the regions.\n\nNagasaki University Sophistication Budget\uff08\u5927\u5b66\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5316\u63a8\u9032\u7d4c\u8cbb\uff09,\u00a0JST-MOST Strategic Japanese-Chinese Cooperative Program on \u201cClimate Change\u201d (\u65e5\u672c\uff08JST)\u30fc\u4e2d\u56fd\uff08MOST)\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u6d41 \u3010\u6c17\u5019\u5909\u52d5\u3011\uff09,Sustainable Aquatic Food and Environment Project in the East China Sea\uff08\u6587\u90e8\u79d1\u5b66\u7701\u7279\u5225\u7d4c\u8cbb\uff09,\u00a0Research Initiative for Adaptation to Future Climate Change\uff08\u9577\u5d0e\u5927\u5b66\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u8ab2\u984c\uff09,\u00a0Graduate School of Fisheries Science and Environmental Studies\uff08\u6c34\u7523\u30fb\u74b0\u5883\u79d1\u5b66\u7dcf\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u79d1\uff09,\u00a0Center for International Collaborative Research\uff08\u56fd\u969b\u9023\u643a\u7814\u7a76\u6226\u7565\u672c\u90e8\uff09\n\nAtsushi Ishimatsu, Kiyoshi Soyano, Shigenobu Takeda, and Atsushi Hagiwara\nGraduate School of Fisheries Science and Environmental Studies, Nagasaki University",

This international event takes place every year on or about June 5th, and in past years cities such as Barcelona, Tokyo, and Moscow have served as the primary hosts. Festivities; however, are not limited to the host country alone. Celebrations are simultaneously held in all over the world.\n\nWorld Environment Day 2008 was the first WED to be organized in the Library of Alexandria. Given the fact of a tight budget and the planning issues due to the collaboration with other organizations, the event was very well organized and successful. The number of participants exceeded the expectations.\n\nThe collaboration between the three organizations, Bibliotheca Alexandrina, British Council, and Wadi Environmental Science Center,\u00a0was intended to govern the partnership to deliver the \u2018World Environment Day Event\u2019 to be held in Cairo on 7th\u00a0 June 2008 and in Alexandria on 12th\u00a0 June 2008.\n\nThe purpose of the partnership collaboration between the PSC, WESC and the British Council is to design and deliver a successful activity to mark World Environment Day in Cairo and Alexandria. Our shared aim was to work together to contribute to greater public awareness of the habits affecting\u00a0the Environment negatively and the impact of human actions on the environment, particularly amongst young people.\n\n\nOn 12 June 2008, the Planetarium Science Center celebrated the World Environment Day (WED) 2008 with the theme of \u201cKick the Habit!\u201d\n\nThe objective of the event is to increase public awareness of negative environmental habits which are contributing to the Climate Change problem. Moreover, it aims at increasing the sense of civic engagement by empowering the normal Egyptian citizen with enough knowledge base needed to take actions against the negative attitudes towards the environment in\u00a0the Egyptian society.\n\nThe day\u2019s agenda was to shed light on environmental issues; empower people to become active agents of sustainable and equitable development; understand that communities are pivotal to changing attitudes towards the environment; and advocate partnership, which will ensure all nations and peoples enjoy a safer and more prosperous future.\n\n\n\nNews Center\n\nMid-Year Program 2019",

As in previous years, the Challenge will consist of several events including the Virtual Manufacturing Challenge, the Micro-Robot Challenge, Solutions In Perception Challenge, and the Modular and Reconfigurable Robot Challenge. We, the SpaceMaster Robotics Team, are taking part in this years challenge.\n\nThe challenge, organized this year organized by the University of Southern California (Polymorphic Robotics Lab) and is based on the previous editions of the ICRA Robotic Planetary Contingency Challenges. The team has to, with limited resources, be able to solve an unexpected problem within the given timeframe of the challenge (usually a few hours). The problem occurs in a planetary surface scenario where the team is not able to leave the habitat. The robot will leave the habitat thru an 'airlock' and can be tele-operated or autonomous.\n\nUnlike the previous years of this competition where CKBot hardware were supplied by the conference, this year, the teams are expected to bring their own robotic modules, tools, and software. The robotics modules or components will be like \"Lego\" building blocks that you can quickly build necessary robots to solve the problems given at the site. There will be a constraint on the space and weight for all equipment. These constraints serve two purposes: one is to simulate the resource limitation one might have in real situations, the other is to limit the scope of the preparation and transportation for this event and make it more portable. more\n\nSpace Master Robotics Team @ICRA : Robot Challenge\nNews The challenge just started, more infos are here!\nPosted by SMRT May 10\nMilestone We got some funding for the ICRA 2011, Modular and Reconfigurable Robot Challenge in Shanghai this year!\nPosted by SMRT Feb 12\n\nLatest Project: SMRT @SMURFS\n\nSpaceMaster Robotics Team\n\nSpaceMaster Robotics Team Members\n\nSpaceMaster Robotics Team\n\nA student team consisting of members formerly studying in the Joint European Master in Space Science & Technology (SpaceMaster) programme.

In particular, the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit regularization.\u00a0Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, and applying them to these empirical results, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of implicit self-regularization.\u00a0 For smaller and\/or older DNNs, this implicit self-regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there appears to be a ``size scale'' separating signal from noise. For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of heavy-tailed self-regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems. Moreover, we can use these heavy tailed results to form a VC-like average case complexity metric that resembles the product norm used in analyzing toy NNs, and we can use this to predict the test accuracy of pretrained DNNs without peeking at the test data.\n\n\nDr. Martin is the founder and chief scientist for Calculation Consulting, a consultancy and software development company specializing in machine learning and data science. He received his PhD in Theoretical Chemistry from the University of Chicago.\u00a0 He was an NSF postdoctoral fellow in the Theoretical Chemistry and Physics\u00a0department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and the National Center for Supercomputing and its Applications (NCSA), working with neural networks and early forms of deep learning.\u00a0 Dr. Martin has devoted 30 years of his life to the academic study and business practice of numerical scientific computation, machine learning, and AI.\u00a0 Having worked over 20 years in Silicon Valley, he has applied machine learning in AI with companies like eBay, Aardvark (acquired by Google), BlackRock, and GoDaddy.\u00a0 He was instrumental in making Demand Media the first billion dollar IPO since Google.

Total economic losses from these 12 events have reached nearly $52 billion, and there have been more than 1000 weather-related death this year.\n\nCould some of these deaths have been prevented; could the economic losses be reduced?\u00a0 \u00a0I think so and that is why we have launched a new initiative to build a Weather-Ready Nation.\u00a0 This effort is designed to improve America\u2019s responsiveness to weather events with the ultimate goal of saving more lives and livelihoods.\n\nNation\u2019s Newest Environmental Satellite Successfully Launched\n\nAn arc of light illuminates the pre-dawn sky at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., as a Delta II rocket launches with the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) spacecraft payload.\n\nNPP is vital for NOAA\u2019s weather forecast mission\n\nAmerica\u2019s newest polar-orbiting satellite roared into orbit this morning, setting the stage for enhanced weather data NOAA scientists will use to develop life-saving severe weather forecasts days in advance.\n\nThe NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force, Calif., at 2:48 a.m. PDT aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket. At approximately 3:45 a.m. PDT, the spacecraft separated from the Delta II to the delight of NOAA and NASA officials.\n\nNPP is a NASA Earth-observing satellite and features five new instruments that will collect more detailed information about Earth\u2019s atmosphere, land and oceans.\u00a0 NASA will use NPP as a research mission, while NOAA will use the data for short and long-term weather forecasting and environmental monitoring.\n\n\u201cThis year has been one for the record books for severe weather,\u201d said Dr. Jane Lubchenco, under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator. \u201cThe need for improved data from NPP and the next generation satellite system under development by NASA and NOAA has never been greater.\u00a0 They will enhance our ability to alert the public with as much lead time as possible.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, data from polar-orbiting satellites like NPP allowed emergency managers and communities to prepare for severe weather events . Five days before a destructive and deadly tornado outbreak in Alabama and parts of the Southeast in April, NOAA forecasters were able to see the early atmospheric signs of the storm system developing and issue timely warnings.\u00a0 NOAA\u00a0 full release",

In this model, the two systems are also connected to their own... view more\u00a0\n\nCredit: (c) by Shabir Barzanjeh, Andr\u00e9 Xuereb & Matteo Aquilina\n\nQuantum computer parts are sensitive and need to be cooled to very low temperatures. Their tiny size makes them particularly susceptible to a temperature increase due to the thermal noise that is produced by environment and or other components nearby. Dr Shabir Barzanjeh, a postdoc at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria), together with Dr Andr\u00e9 Xuereb from the University of Malta and Matteo Aquilina from the National Aerospace Centre in Malta has now proposed a novel method to keep quantum devices cool. Their approach, which they have proven to work theoretically, relies on quantum interference.\n\nIf a hotter object is placed next to a cooler one, the heat normally has only one option: it can only flow from the hotter object to the cooler one. Therefore, if one wants to cool an object that is already cooler than its surroundings, like it is done in a household fridge, an effort has to be made to achieve this. A new method for cooling down the elements of quantum devices such as qubits, the tiny building blocks of quantum computers, was now theoretically proven to work by a group of physicists.\n\n\"Essentially the device we are proposing is working like a fridge. But here we are using a quantum mechanical principle to realize it,\" explains Shabir Barzanjeh, the lead author of the study and postdoc in the research group of Professor Johannes Fink. In their paper, they studied how thermal noise flows through quantum devices and they devised a method that can prevent the heat flow to warm up the sensitive quantum device. The secret lies in an additional heat bath, in other words: besides the object that needs to be cooled and the object that produces heat, there is a third object that can store heat, a so-called \"heat bath\". This heat bath is connected to both other devices, and the researchers showed that it is possible to control its heat flow such that it cancels the heat coming from the warm object directly to the cool one via special quantum interference.\n\n\"So far, researchers have focused on controlling signal, but here we study the noise. This is quite different because a signal is coherent, and the noise isn't\". Concerning the practical implementation of the mechanism that adds the phase shift to the thermal noise, Shabir Barzanjeh already has some ideas. It could be a mechanical object that vibrates, and maybe radiation pressure could be used to control the oscillation. \"Now it is the time for experimentalists to verify the theory,\" he says.\n\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.",

It is believed that the largest lobster ever\u00a0recorded\u00a0is\u00a044 pounds! There are a few aquariums around the country that have 20-pound-plus lobsters. McSchmick\u00a0could grow larger but our aquarists believe it will take a while\u00a0to notice\u00a0any growth. Lobsters are 10-legged crustaceans closely related to shrimp and crabs.\u00a0They are found in all of the world\u2019s oceans, as well as brackish environments and even fresh water. This particular lobster is an American lobster, found in the North Atlantic. Lobsters typically molt at least once per year.\u00a0 During this process, they shed their entire shell (or exoskeleton), leaving behind a replica of their bodies. They then hide for several days to a week or more while their new shell hardens.\u00a0 Sometimes the lobsters even eat their molts, as it is a great source of calcium to help their shells harden.\nPrevious Post\n\nFeatured Stories\n\nsea-turtle-swim-test Animal Rescue Update: The First Patients of Cold-Stunning Season\n\nIt was a busy holiday weekend for our Animal Rescue and Animal Health teams as they triaged 30 sea turtles that stranded on the coast of New England.\u00a0\n\nRead the full story\n\nleopard-shark-kelp-forest You Asked, We Answered: Do Sharks Make Noise?\n\nDolphins make clicking noises and whales emit deep, low hums to echolocate and communicate, but what about sharks?\n\nRead the full story\n\nRelated Stories\n\nEnd of Year Roundup: Baby Animals\n\nPublished December 12, 2017\n\nSpecies Spotlight: Green Honeycreeper\n\nPublished December 08, 2017",
