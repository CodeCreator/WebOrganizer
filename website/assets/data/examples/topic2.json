This will probably involve running a command such as this:\n$ . ~legion\/setup.sh\n$ source ~legion\/setup.csh\nThe exact syntax will depend on what kind of shell you are using and where your Legion files are installed (i.e., the value of ~legion will depend on your individual Legion net). Consult your system administrator for more information.\n\nAbout object permissions\nIf your system administrator has enabled Legion security, the objects that you create while logged in cannot be used by any other users. If you wish to share your objects you will need to give other users permission to read, write, or execute objects.\n\nFor our purposes, \"read\" methods are defined as methods that obtain but do not modify an object's state, \"write\" methods are methods that modify an object's state, and \"execute\" methods are methods that run an object.\n\nThis command works on common Legion object types: context, file, class, tty, implementation, host, and vault objects all fall into this category.\n\nChanging object permissions\nYou can use the legion_change_permissions command to give other users permission to read, write, or execute your objects. There are specific lags to add [+] or remove [-] read, write, or execute permissions on objects. So, if you wanted to allow user bob to be able to read your file object foo, you would enter:\n$ legion_change_permissions +r \/users\/bob foo\nThis lets bob \"read\" your object foo.\n\nOther relevant on-line documents:\nClick on the to go to the page.\nLogging in to a running Legion system\nLegion graphical user interface\nIntroduction to Legion context space\nContext-related commands\nHow to start remote programs in Legion\nSample makefile for remote programs\nAdapting a parameter space study for Legion\nObject permissions\nLegion tty objects\nRunning a PVM code in Legion\nRunning a Legion MPI code\nRunning native MPI code\nQuick list of all Legion commands (1.6.4)\nUsage of all Legion commands (1.6.4)\nStarting a new Legion system\nUsing Legion security features\nLegion host and vault objects\nAdding host and vault objects\nBrief descriptions of all on-line 1.6 tutorials\n\nLast modified: Fri Jun 4 14:37:26 1999\n\n[an error occurred while processing this directive]",

Every department in the company had their own systems which had the data. The staff of respective department had to spend large of time to collate all the information and come up with the metrics to present. Moreover, there was a need for a common person to consolidate the metrics across department and prepare a pitch with the information which was then used in the review meetings.\n\nWe initiated a business transformation initiative followed by building data aggregation and custom analytics. A need was identified to develop dashboards that present enterprise with operational and performance metrics used for periodic business performance review. The departments covered various business functions such Audit, Admin, Communications, Consumer, Finance, Investment, IT, HR, Operations, etc.\n\nFollowing approach was followed to come up with the transformation strategy\n\n  \u2022 Analyzed the data from each department along with the KPA and KPI required for performance review\n  \u2022 For every KPI looked at the data source and its availability\n  \u2022 Since the data sources of different kind involving databases, excel files, enterprise API, etc., we developed custom ETL programs to transform the data to the required format\n  \u2022 Developed custom analytics from the common data source to present the KPI metrics\n  \u2022 Designed and developed compelling user experience using using interactive and animated charts, graphs and various other rich elements.\n\nLatest technologies such as HTML5, D3, AngularJS were used to make the interface rich and responsive.\n\nKey Features implemented were\n\n  \u2022 Rich Internet Web Application\n  \u2022 Front-end and Back-end Partitioned\n  \u2022 RESTful Web services with JSON output\n  \u2022 Thick Client, MV based Single Page Application\n  \u2022 Single Sign-on making access to dashboards easy for CXOs\n  \u2022 Intuitive interface having KPI strips, Metric Tabs and Domain sections with\n  \u2022 Rich graphs.\n  \u2022 Business data organized in groups and sub groups with creative easy drilled down or roll up.\n  \u2022 Graphs showing trends over time periods, comparisons and distributions across peer areas.\n  \u2022 Many types of graphs such as Pie charts, Line graphs, Bar charts, Stacked Bar charts, Tables, Geo Maps with Locations, Scatter plots, etc implemented using D3.JS\n  \u2022 Graphs have options to Select, Filter, Segregate, Search, Combine, Split, Roll up and Drill down\n  \u2022 ETL to transform the business data in various formats\n  \u2022 Migration from Tomcat\/MySQL to IBM WebSphere\/Oracle\n  \u2022 About 40+ Dashboards for various OPCOs developed and delivered successfully\n  \u2022 Test automation using Protractor",

        "text":"Google Wave Pisses Me Off\n\nThe hyptasticness that is Google Wave continues to annoy me as a Flash developer and RIA enthusiast. Now I preface all of this by admitting that I haven\u2019t used it; maybe when I get an invite this thing will be worth all of the finger grease that keyboards have endured as people talk about it. And I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not impressive; it is. It\u2019s a great demo, it does some very cool stuff. I\u2019m not annoyed at Google Wave, I\u2019m annoyed because everything that people like about that demo was doable 3-5 years ago with Flash. Flash Remoting, Flash Communication Server, and our much better user interface capabilities pretty much could have created Google Wave. Now I understand that there\u2019s some excitement because this is built on open standards with a more open model, but people don\u2019t get excited about standards- they get exited about vision. And that\u2019s what kills me.\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Silverlight developer or a Flash developer; the technology platform you\u2019ve got is years ahead of what Google Wave is built on. Yet with all of our UI prowess, our design sense, and our pure and simple technical superiority with things like real time communication and scalability we haven\u2019t built very much that captures people\u2019s imaginations the way that Google Wave has. I think we lack the vision.\n\nI think it could be argued that in some cases we\u2019re TOO visionary. If someone had actually built Google Wave 3-5 years ago it wouldn\u2019t have made the same impact because people wouldn\u2019t have realized what it meant. In the RIA world we live in the bubble of the future. I genuinely think that most of us look 3-5 years ahead because that\u2019s where our technology puts us. When people don\u2019t get what we\u2019re trying to pitch we just move on to the next thing. Look at Augmented Reality. Possible with Flash for a couple of years now but it\u2019s just starting to get some main stream attention. RIA developers seem permanently entrenched in the Technology Trigger of the Hype Cycle and we don\u2019t seem to be able to follow things through to the Plateau of Productivity.\n\nPart of the Wave hypefest is probably because of the world\u2019s love\/hate relationship with Google. When they do something everyone goes nuts and that\u2019s because they really do have the power to change the web. They did it once, they\u2019re big, they\u2019re smart, they can do it again. But there are a lot of smart people in the RIA world. Big companies like Microsoft and Adobe and small ones like Aviary and Picnik. We just don\u2019t seem to encourage the visionary demos, the ones that make people rethink how they\u2019ll communicate and interact. I don\u2019t know if that has to come from the big companies directly or whether it\u2019s something we can encourage startups to do. We don\u2019t have a technology problem; if that was all it took we\u2019d be cranking out Wave-esque demos all the time. We just don\u2019t seem to be able to look at the entire scope of what we\u2019ve been doing for the past couple of years and put it together in a game changing way.\n\nI don\u2019t have a solution, but if you\u2019ve got suggestions, I\u2019m all ears.\n\nShow Comments\n\nHide Comments\n\nComments are closed.",

Devised by Matthew Skelton of Conflux, it is used as a key part of the Software Delivery Assessment at Conflux, but can be used freely by anyone (subject to the CC BY-SA license below).\n\nThe assessment uses and builds on the well-known and proven Spotify Squad Health Check model.\n\nTranslations: Japanese (ja \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5)\n\nThe assessment covers ten dimensions in total:\n\n  1. Team Health\n  2. Deployment\n  3. Flow\n  4. Continuous Delivery\n  5. Operability\n  6. Testing and Testability\n  7. Reliability and SRE\n  8. On-call\n  9. Security and Securability\n  10. Team Topologies team interactions\n\nThese ten dimensions cover key aspects of modern software delivery in a form that enables teams to self-assess their strengths and practices.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Overview: see slides 32-38 in Continuous Delivery at scale\n\n\ud83c\udccf Card deck: make the assessment fun and interactive by using the Software Delivery Assessment printed card deck from Agile Stationery. Developed in collaboration with Conflux, the card deck has Tired and Inspired indicators for each of the assessment criteria, together with emoji cards for quick-fire voting from team members. The card deck works for remote assessments too!\n\nAssessment cards from Agile Stationery Five emoji voting cards\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018-2021 Conflux Digital Ltd\n\nLicenced under CC BY-SA 4.0 CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\nPurpose of the assessments\n\nThe aim of the assessments is to promote and sustain a positive working environment for building and running software systems where:\n\n  \u2022 Changes to software are built, tested, and deployed to Production rapidly and safely using Continuous Delivery practices\n  \u2022 Processes and practices are optimised for the flow of change towards Production\n  \u2022 Software is designed and built to enable independent, decoupled deployments for separate families of systems\n  \u2022 Software is designed and built in a way that addresses operability, testability, releasability, security, and reliability\n  \u2022 Problems in Production are always detected by teams before customers and users notice\n  \u2022 Responsibility and accountability for software changes lead to empowerment and ownership\n  \u2022 Working with software is rewarding and interesting\n  \u2022 Being on-call and supporting the software is sustainable and valuable\n  \u2022 People feel confident to challenge poor practices and approaches\n  \u2022 Teams have a clear mission and well-defined interaction patterns with other teams\n\nFundamentally, the assessments should help to unblock and enable teams so they can succeed. The assessments should help teams to improve how they build, test, and deploy software systems through identifying different kinds of improvements:\n\n  1. Team-focused improvements\n  2. Product-focused and Service-focused improvements\n  3. Organisation-wide improvements\n\nThe assessments should NOT be used to penalize teams, but to provide a shared drive towards improving practices and quality.\n\nTeams included in the assessments\n\nEvery team writing code, scripts, and\/or configuration for application software or infrastructure will benefit from being included in the assessments:\n\n  \u2022 Teams building user- and customer-facing websites and services\n  \u2022 Teams building internal services\n  \u2022 Teams building infrastructure to support other systems (including Platform teams)\n  \u2022 Teams building build & deployment tooling and scripts\n  \u2022 Teams configuring and testing COTS products as part of the software & infrastructure estate\n  \u2022 Any other teams with a primary focus on building, configuring, and testing software and infrastructure\n\nBy \"team\", we mean 6-10 person group that works together closely, usually called a\u00a0SquadScrum team, Product team, or Stream-aligned team\n\nAssessment criteria\n\nThe criteria for each dimension are taken from existing published books and online sources:\n\nHow to run the assessments\n\nThe assessment session itself should feel somewhat like a team retrospective session. The main difference from a normal retrospective session is that in the team assessment session the facilitator guides the discussion more firmly. There are many questions to discuss and it's important that the team discusses all of the criteria in the time available.\n\nAt the end of the assessment session, the team should feel encouraged and empowered to decide on what actions they want to take to improve their processes and practices based on the discussions.\n\n\nMany organisations find that running team assessments every 3 months provides a good result.\n\n\n  1. Find someone to Facilitate the assessment. This should be someone from outside the team, who is familiar with running team retrospectives.\u00a0\n  2. Book a time slot for 2 or 3 hours: for online sessions you could split this over 2 or more video call sessions, and for in-person sessions book\u00a0a room large enough for the team.\n  3. For online sessions, either use the card deck from Agile Stationery and screenshot or note down the results in a spreadsheet, or use an online poll tool to capture responses from people in the session. For in-person sessions, either use the card deck from Agile Stationery, or print the assessment sheets for each set of criteria, either using the ready-made A1 PDF (see Releases), or the individual assessment pages at A1 size if possible (use small margins):\n  4. For online sessions, show the Tired and Inspired criteria on the screen alongside the question. For in-person sessions, either print the details pages\u00a0as a guide or have the pages open on-screen to understand the context and details of each of the assessment criteria:\n    1. Team Health\n    2. Deployment\n    3. Flow\n    4. Continuous Delivery\n    5. Operability\n    6. Testing and Testability\n    7. Reliability and SRE\n    8. On-call\n    9. Security and Securability\n    10. Team Topologies team interactions\n  5. It is valuable to capture details and nuances of the discussions around each question. For online sessions, have someone take notes in a document or shared whiteboard. For in-person sessions, bring lots of marker pens or whiteboard markers: red, blue, and green are best.\n  6. Include\u00a0someone who is familiar with facilitating retrospectives\u00a0(possibly a scrum master) in the session. They will be shadowing the facilitator during the session so the person from your team can facilitate other assessment sessions later.\n\nMake sure that the Facilitator understands the purpose of the session and is familiar with the assessment pages and questions.\n\n\nThe facilitator should familiarise themselves with the Spotify Squad Health Check approach before running the session. See How I Used the Spotify Squad Health Check Model for a good experience report, Squad Health Checks from SkyBet, and download instructions from Spotify (PDF).\n\nDuring the assessment:\n\n  \u2022 Keep the team on schedule by asking for some discussions to be held outside the session\n  \u2022 Write down the team scores and notes on the printed assessment sheets or ensure that scores and notes are captured in a digital tool.\n  \u2022 Take photographs of the completed assessment sheets for in-person sessions.\n  \u2022 Get feedback from the team on the VALUE and EXECUTION of the engineering assessment - smiley faces are sufficient!\n\n\nEach team assessment runs for around 3-4 hours, and the facilitator will run the team\u00a0through 10 sets of questions:\n\n  1. Team health check -\u00a035 mins\n  2. Deployment health check -\u00a010 mins\n  3. Flow check -\u00a010 mins\n  4. Continuous Delivery check -\u00a020 mins\n  5. Operability check -\u00a020 mins\n  6. Test coverage check -\u00a020 mins\n  7. Reliability and SRE - 30 mins\n  8. On-call - 15 mins\n  9. Security check - 30 mins\n  10. Team Topologies check - 20 mins\n\nThese timings leave space for two 10 minute breaks\u00a0during the assessment.\n\nRunning the Assessment session\n\nEach section has several questions. Each question should be answered as follows:\n\n  \u2022 The team (either as individuals or as a team) rate each of the criteria using\u00a0SAD (1 OR 2)\u00a0\/\u00a0MEH (3)\u00a0\/\u00a0YAY (4 OR 5)\u00a0based on the\u00a0Tired\u00a0and\u00a0Inspired\u00a0guidelines\n\n    \u2022 Tired\u00a0aligns to a low rating (1), and\u00a0Inspired\u00a0aligns to a high rating (5)\n\n    \u2022 If you used individual ratings, tally the ratings and\/or decide on a single team score from 1 to 5. You may find it useful to use different coloured pens on the printed sheet to indicate visually the different ratings.\n\n  \u2022 The\u00a0Trend\u00a0since the previous time is identified (going up, staying roughly the same, going down), if applicable\n\n  \u2022 An\u00a0Action\u00a0agreed to improve the score for that question over the coming months.\n\n  \u2022 Use the\u00a0Notes\u00a0column to indicate further information that you think is valuable for the coordinating team to know about.\n\n  \u2022 Make sure to complete to the\u00a0Date\/Name\/Facilitator\u00a0details\n\n  \u2022 For in-person sessions, take a photo of each completed sheet and send to\u00a0the person coordinating the assessments\n\n  \u2022 \u00a0Get team members to rate the assessment session itself in terms of: Value, Execution (sad, meh, happy faces)\n\nViral facilitation\n\nEach team assessment session has present one person who is shadowing the facilitator so that they can themselves facilitate future sessions. Each new facilitator should facilitate at least 2 sessions with other teams. In this way, the number of facilitators expands rapidly, enabling a minimal burden on the initial facilitators.\n\nCoordinating and interpreting the results\n\nAfter teams have each run an assessment session and sent their results, the coordinating group should collate the results from different teams to identify any areas that need improving across the organisation. Ask questions such as:\n\n  \u2022 Why does team ABC rate themselves as 1 for test coverage? What is hindering them?\n  \u2022 What can we do as an organisation to help... (truncated)",
