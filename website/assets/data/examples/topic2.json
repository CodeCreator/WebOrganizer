These, my friends, are the Show Notes.\n\nIntroduction to Your Hosts\n\nPyCon 2010 Reflections\n\n  \u2022 Mike and Chris were impressed by the community and the group focus\n  \u2022 Ruby sucks. Mike said it. Bring it, kids.\n  \u2022 Titus likes Distribute and Pip. Who knows why?\n  \u2022 What can we learn from PyCon for regional conferences like PyOhio?\n  \u2022 Dave\u2019s done a lot of thinking about testing\n  \u2022 He finds that nothing lets him test the way he wants.\n  \u2022 He uses nose, mock, and dingus\n  \u2022 Mote might be good for BDD, but Dave finds it lacking.\n  \u2022 Dave hates documentation. Tests could be like documentation, and would be more accurate over time.\n  \u2022 Mote parses the output more like a narrative, almost like a spec, instead of \u2026..F\u2026.\n  \u2022 We work with a large system, and rest assured, code is not documentation. Tests could be.\n  \u2022 Oh..we ramble about this for a while. PyCon? What\u2019s PyCon? Oh\u2026right\u2026the Testing BOF.\n  \u2022 There was a Testing Goat. Terry Peppers is somehow responsible for it. Mike Pirnat needed one. Gary Bernhardt was the goat. We want pictures. \u2018Nuff said?\n  \u2022 Look into Mike\u2019s .vimrc. Behold the wonder.\n  \u2022 Right. PyCon. Remember Pycon? David Beazley\u2019s talk on the GIL was dead sexy.\n  \u2022 The Brandon Rhodes\u2019 discussion of the Dictionary Object. Awesome.\n  \u2022 Chris thought Titus\u2019s talk on Continuous Integration frameworks was great.\n  \u2022 Oh look. Back to testing. We like talking about testing. Look for a show or two on testing. Wait! Don\u2019t leave!\n  \u2022 Chris was impressed with the diversity of the community and how friendly people were.\n  \u2022 And about the vendors. What did we think about the vendors? We like Swag. And sometimes we buy books. And hats.\n  \u2022 \u201cI use vim, so I don\u2019t really need an IDE.\u201d Flame. Discuss.\n  \u2022 We generally have a good opinion of companies using open source and who participate in the community.\n  \u2022 We enjoyed hacking together, especially on Mike\u2019s snakeplan.\n  \u2022 We need DCVS achievements. Like games. But better.\n  \u2022 Catherine Devlin\u2019s cmd2 was sweet.\n  \u2022 You might be eaten by a grue.\n  \u2022 Python is used by the military to create simulations. Thanks, Eric Silverman!\n  \u2022 Atlanta, however, was\u2026meh. We\u2019d prefer Cleveland. We\u2019re not biased. Nope. And it\u2019s not Detroit, right?\n\n\n  \u2022 Contact us by leaving a comment or by emailing feedback [at] frompythonimportpodcast.com\n  \u2022 What topics do you want? Who do you want to hear from? Let us know!\n  \u2022 Our Identi\u2019ca group is fpip\n  \u2022 Let Steve Holden know we\u2019d love a bottle of Scotch.\n\nDownload MP3 | Download OGG",

        "text":"Fork me on GitHub\n\nA new year a new name ( 2017-01-02 )\n\nRubyX compiles ruby to binary\n\nThe previous name was from a time in ancient history, three years ago, in internet time over a decade (X years!). From when i thought i was going to build a virtual machine. It has been clear for a while that what i am really doing is building a compiler. A new thing needs a new name and finally inspiration struck in the form of RubyX.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a shame that both domain and github were taken, but the - versions work well too. Renaming of the organization, repositories and changing of domain is now complete. I did not rewrite history, so all old posts still refer to salama.\n\nWhat i like about the new name most, is the closeness to ruby, this is after all an implementation of ruby. Also the unclarity of what the X is is nice, is it as in X-files, the unknown of the maths variable or ala mac, the 10 for a version number? Or the hope of achieving 10 times performance as a play on the 3 times performance of ruby 3. It\u2019s a mystery, but it is a ruby mystery and that is the main thing.\n\n2. Type system\n\nAbout the work that has been done, the type system rewrite is probably the biggest.\n\nTypes are now immutable throughout the system, and the space keeps a list of all unique types. Adding, removing, changing type all goes through a hashing process and leads to a unique instance, that may have to be created.\n\n3. TypedMethod arguments and locals\n\nClose on the heal of the type immutability was the change to types as argument and local variable descriptors. A type instance is now used to describe the arguments (names and types) uniquely, clearing up previous imprecision.\n\nArgument and locals type, along with the name of the method describe a method uniquely. Obviously the types may not be changed. Methods with different argument types are thus different methods, a fact that still has to be coded into the ruby compiler.\n\n4. Arguments and calling convention\n\nThe Message used to carry the arguments, while locals were a separate frame object. An imbalance if one thinks about closures, as both have to be decoupled from their activation.\n\nNow both arguments and locals are represented as NamedList\u2019s, which are basically just objects. The type is transferred from the method to the NamedList instance at call time, so it is available at run-time. This makes the whole calling convention easier to understand.\n\n5. Parfait in ruby\n\nParfait is more normal ruby now, specifically we are using instance variables in Parfait again, just like in any ruby. When compiling we have to deal with the mapping to indexes, but that\u2019s what we have types for, so no problem. The new version simplifies the boot process a little too.\n\nPositioning has been removed from Parfait completely and pushed into the Assembler where it belongs.\n\n6. SOML goodbye\n\nAll trances of the soml language have been eradicated. All that is left is an intermediate typed tree representation. But the MethodCompiler still generates binary so that\u2019s good. Class and method generation capabilities have been removed from that compiler and now live one floor up, at the ruby level.\n\n7. Ruby Compiler\n\nFinally work on the ruby compiler has started and after all that ground work is actually quite easy. Class statements create classes already. Method definitions extract their argument and local variable names, and create their representation as RubyMethod. More to come.\n\nAll in all almost all of the previous posts todos are done. Next up is the fanning of RubyMethods into TypedMethods by instantiating type variations. When compilation of those works, i just need to implement the cross function jumps and voila.\n\nCertainly an interesting year ahead.",

The latest test cycle (with the test re-enabled)\npassed on all platforms with Java 6 (including Windows). With Java 5,\nthe tests only passed on Windows. No Java 5 results were reported from\nthe Solaris and Linux variants.\n\nDoes the test pass with Java 5 in your (OS\/X) environment?\n\nKnut Anders\n\nView raw message",

Nominate new content that should later be of type 'course'.\n\nAll nominations should be listed somewhere.\n\nWhat's the best way to do this?\n\nFor 1. I thought about using the Flag module and then just make a view where all nodes with nomination flag are listed.\n\nFor 2. I'm not sure, maybe I use webforms and the admin has to transfer it into a node of type 'course'. But how do I get a list of new AND existing nominated content?\n\n\nHow about using modules Node_convert, and Flag (which is obviously a must have for what you're looking for)? About Node convert (from it's project page):\n\nadds a menu tab \"Convert\" on the node view page, i.e. node\/1\/convert, which gives the ability to convert the node from its current node type to another node type. The module provides the means to transfer all the field values of the current node type into fields on the destination node type, or discard them.\n\nI'm using Node_convert already for long time, works great. It allows for implementing a lifecycle (or workflow?) to start from a node that is only just something like an idea (or suggestion, question, issue, abstract, etc). Those ideas that get the highest votings, are the ones that seem to make sense to handle with highest priority. Compare it to a 'Question' with a lot of votes, but with hardly any (or no) answers.\n\nWhen the node's content evolves (read: the more effort\/details added to it), I convert its content type to finished products like (eg) a recipe, a redbook (already from my Drupal 6 days a few years ago).\n\nBy combining it with some type of access module (related to either taxonomy or content type) I can make it more restrictive to give access to it. E.g. public to start from, then \"authenticated\", and in the end only for roles such as \"subscribers\", \"students\", etc.\n\nMaybe you also want to consider Fivestar and\/or Voting API (I have the impression that \"Voting\" is a kind of synomym of what you mean with \"Nominate\").\n\nAnd of course: use Views as you are considering already. To continue my samples above: using some basics Views reports, you can easily massage it all in a todo list also.\n\n| improve this answer | |\n  \u2022 thanks for your input, sadly node_convert does not support all of the field types I need (e.g. paragraphs) but I keep this one in mind for another project. \u2013\u00a0scar May 18 '15 at 14:45\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
