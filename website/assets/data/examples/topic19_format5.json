        "text":"What is the printing technology used in our process?\n\nAdditive manufacturing or 3D printing is a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process, where successive layers of material are laid down in different\u00a0 shapes.\n\nWhat is the maximum size of the model that can be built?\n\nMaximum build size:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 28 L x 15 W x 15 H cm\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11.0 L x 6.0 W x 6.0 H inches\nObject bigger then the mentioned limits can be printed in parts and then glued together.\n\nWhat is the accuracy of the printing?\n\nModels can be printed in three accuracy settings of 100\/200\/300 microns.\nCommercial jobs are undertaken in the accuracy of 100 or 200 microns.\n\nWhich file formats are supported by 3D printer?\n\nThe standard file formats supported and preferred are .STL, .OBJ and .THING, other formats like STEP or Parasolid are also supported using conversion software. All standard CAD software can export the files in .STL or .STP (STEP) file formats.\n\nWhat is the material used for printing?\n\nPolylactic Acid or PLA is a biodegradable plastic , a plastic substitute made from fermented plant starch (usually corn) is quickly becoming a popular alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics. With lot of features that make it great for 3D printing \u2014 it doesn\u2019t give off fumes like ABS does, or warp nearly as much. It\u2019s also really shiny.\nPLA is hard but slightly brittle, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s easily breakable \u2013 it is strong, just that when it does give, it\u2019s more likely to snap than bend. And it also stays flexible for a short while as it cools, which can be handy. It also does not warp and crack of during making of larger objects.It comes in various attractive colours like red, green yellow, blue, brown, black and white.\nA Density: 1.23 # 1.25 g\/cm\u00b3\nA Melting Point:173#178 \u00b0C\nA Glass Transition Temperature:50#80 \u00b0C\nA Tensile strength: 2360 to 10000psi\n\nWhat are the colors available?\n\nMaterial is available opaque and translucent colours. Available colours are red, green, blue, black, white, yellow, purple, gold, solver, grey and few other colours.\n\nCan we print objects in multiple colours?\n\nObjects are normally printed in single colour but by pausing the printer at different heights and changing the filament colour,one can get interesting multi-colour models.\n\nWhat is the min. feature size that it can print properly?\n\nAny feature which is less than 1.0 mm cannot be printed properly. We will recommend at least a width of 1.25-1.5 mm for thin wall components.\n\nWhat is the approximate printing time?\n\nA cube of 3cm will take approximately 2 hours to print including the model preparation time. Depending upon the hollow spaces time can be less. Time will also depend on how many support structures are used for overhang features.\n\nCan the model be painted?\n\nThe models once printed can be also painted using acrylic paints.\n\nCan the models be joined?\n\nBigger size models can be printed in parts and later can be joined using Elfy\/Fevikwik.\n\nCan the model break after dropping it on the floor?\n\nThe models can withstand a fall to the floor, if dropped from a height of 6 \u2013 10 feet.\n\nWhat is the approximate cost of the printing a model?\n\nThe printing cost will depend upon the bounded box volume of the model or the time it takes to print a model. Please send us the model information for the exact estimate.\n\nAny care has to be taken to preserve the 3D printed model?\n\nThe printed models are left in a car\/vehicle exposed to sun for a long time then the models can warp or twist spoiling the shape.\nIt is strongly recommended to keep the model indoors or under shade. For outdoor\napplication, it may survive in case there is proper ventilation.\n\nHow do we create models that we want to print in 3D?\n\nModels can be printed in any well known CAD software like NX, Catia, Solid\nEdge, Solidworks, Inventor, IronCAD, Pro\/Engineer etc. Other simple to use software can be also used, some of them are\n\u2022 Tinkercad\n\u2022 123D Design\n\u2022 3D Tin\n\u2022 Blender\n\u2022 Wings3D\n\u2022 Meshmixer\n\nAre there some website from where we can downlo ad the model that we want to print?\n\nYes there are several sites which offer free or paid ready made models in .STL or .OBJ format which can be directly printed in 3D.Some of sites are as follows;\n\u2022 Thingiverse\n\u2022 Grabcad\n\u2022 My Mini Factory\nOne can also download 3D vector art to be printed in various colours or even painted in acrylic colours to beautify jewellery boxes, phone cases or items of personal use.\nSome of such sites are as follows;\n\u2022 Vectorclip\n\u2022 Vectorart 3D\n\u2022 Woodwisdom\n\nHow is PLA different from ABS material ?\n\nPLA Filament\n\nPLA is made from plants rich in starch like sugar beets, corn and wheat. It is both commercially 100% compostable and 100% biodegradable. Compostable means that\u00a0 it can be broken down into water, carbon dioxide and biomass, will not produce any toxic material and can support plant life. Biodegradable means\u00a0 that it can be broken down over time through a process involving microorganisms\u00a0 (fungi or bacteria). However, the process can create methane at a rate 62 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide.\n\nABS Filament\nABS is a petroleum based plastic and not safe to use for products which may come into contact with food.\n\u2022 More brittle than ABS\n\u2022 Shinier and smoother\n\u2022 Can droop if it gets too hot, for example, if it is left in a hot car in the summer time\n\u2022 Usually turns white along the high stress zone when it is bent, then breaks into lots of little pieces\n\u2022 Even though it is made from plants, it may contain dyes and binders which are not food safe\n\u2022 Smells sweet when it is being printed\n\u2022 Strength is relatively equal to ABS\n\u2022 Impact resistant and tough\n\u2022 Hard\n\u2022 Glossy\n\u2022 Petroleum based\n\u2022 Flammable\n\u2022 Prone to cracking if cooled too quickly\n\u2022 Usually bends before it breaks\n\u2022 Has a strong, toxic smell when it is being printed\n\u2022 Strength is relatively equal to PLA",

For example some species have very distinctive calls (e.g. Corn Crake, Quail, Savi's Warbler) but can be extremely difficult to see. In fact attempts to see them could be disturbing to such sensitive species, and this should be discouraged. Some other species are difficult to identify by sight alone (e.g. Marsh Tit and Willow Tit) but much easier by call, so in these cases one could consider that a seen-only record is not acceptable!\n\nWhatever you decide, we suggest you mention it in the 'comments' for a record if you have only heard a species.\n\nPlease Log in to join the conversation.",

        "text":"\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Robins: Wintering\n\nQ. What do robins wintering in the north eat?\n\nA. Robins switch diets in fall. They turn from earthworms to berries and other fruits. Because some forms of fruit\n(such as mountain ash berries and crab apples) remain available all winter long even in the north, a few robins can stay in an area with food enough to support them all winter. These robins are most often found in areas where there is a bit of open water from a nearby spring, stream, river, or large lake, and where there are fruit trees. The water and fruit get them through the season.\n\nQ. Doesn't a robin know enough to migrate south? I live in Canada (or one of the northern states). There is a robin wintering in my neighborhood.\n\nA. Robins are a migratory species, but their migration is far more complicated than simply a shift southward. There seems to be a great deal of individual variation in where they spend the winter, though males are far more likely to remain in the north than females. There are good reasons. Come spring, the male\u2019s main job is to find and defend a territory. The females\u2019 main job is to create and lay the eggs. This requires a lot of good nutrition and food energy, so females go where they are sure of good food supplies in winter. Yes, they have to use up food energy to migrate north. But migrating and laying eggs are easier for well-nourished birds.\n\nQ. Won't the cold hurt robins? There are robins staying in our town in Ontario all winter. Next week the temperatures are supposed to be lower than 20 below zero.\n\nA. Cold temperatures don't hurt most birds\u2014as long as they have food. As nights grow cooler during fall, northern birds start growing more down feathers close to their bodies. These feathers work like a down jacket. The down feathers insulate the birds, keeping the heat of their bodies inside. The robins make their body heat by shivering; as long as they have food to give them energy, they can survive extreme cold.\n\nQ. Should I be feeding a robin wintering in my backyard? I live in northern Minnesota.\n\nA. Robins only spend the winter in areas where there is some food available, so feeding them isn't necessary. Nevertheless, a lot of people enjoy offering them food, creating a special bond with this homey and pleasant bird. Robins will NOT take birdseed. Sometimes they'll take frozen fruit, though it's often hard to teach them that fruit in a feeder is food! (Robins learn at an early age that fruit grows on trees and shrubs. They simply do not expect to find it anywhere else.) One of the best kinds of food for wintering robins\u2014and the easiest for them to discover\u2014is mealworms. You can put out a dozen mealworms on a sunny day when the temperature is above freezing, and nearby robins will often notice their wiggly movements and investigate. Once robins discover the mealworms, they'll come back even when the temperature is below freezing and the mealworms are stiff. Then if you start offering fruit in the same spot, the robins are more likely to notice it. Some favorite robin foods are blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. You might as well buy bags of frozen fruit for them, since it will freeze outside anyway!\n\nMike Houle developed this heated birdbath system for feeding his wintering robins.\n\nOne of Journey North's correspondents from Wisconsin used a heated bird bath to keep mealworms thawed and moving. He thought this would allow him to feed his whole flock of wintering robins, but one of the robins took over and defended the bird bath food source against all the other robins in his yard. This arrangement still helped the other robins, who were sharing the fruit on neighborhood trees, because now there was one fewer bird to share with, and it made the one particular robin VERY happy!\n\nQ. Do robins need water in the winter?\n\nA. In northern climaes where ponds, rivers, streams and lakes freeze ove in the winter, a bird's most available water source is often snow. But it tkaes energy to melt snow. Birds needs to drink and, if possible, bathe even in the winter. Dirty feathers lose much of their insulating properties, so a clean bird is a warm bird. If you have a heated birdbath and worry about birds bathing and then being unable to fly off in sub-zero weather when the water freezes on them, you can modify the birdbat. to allow them to drink but not bathe. Cover the top of your birdbath with a pice of plastic-coated quarter- or half-inch hardware cloth. Or lace twigs or small branches across the top. Either method will allow the birds to stay dry while they drink through the openings.\n\nQ. This winter we have seen them by the dozens and hundreds! Why? We live in Texas (also asked by Florida residents) and aren't used to seeing robins.\n\nA. The robins have likely dropped in because they discovered a rich food source.\n\nJourney North Home Page \u00a0 Facebook Pinterest Twitter \u00a0 Annenberg Media Home Page\nCopyright 1997-2016 Journey North.

Presence of fire whirls. Strong convection column.\n\nIs there a warning system for wildfires?\n\nA Red Flag Warning is issued for weather events which may result in extreme fire behavior that will occur within 24 hours. \u2026 A Red Flag Warning is the highest alert. During these times extreme caution is urged by all residents, because a simple spark can cause a major wildfire.\n\nCan you predict a wildfire?\n\nUsing different projections of temperature and precipitation, scientists predict where and when wildfires are most likely to occur. \u2026 Using computer models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), scientists create maps showing areas that will be more susceptible to wildfires.\n\nWhat is the biggest wildfire in history?\n\nAmerica\u2019s Most Devastating Wildfires\n\nFire Date Acres Burned\nThe Great Michigan Fire October 8, 1871 2.5 million\nHinckley Fire September 1, 1894 160,000\nYacolt Fire September 1902 Over 1 million\nThe Big Burn August 1910 3 million\n\nWhat should you never do during a wildfire?\n\n5 things you should never do in a fire\n\n  \u2022 Breaking windows. \u2026\n  \u2022 Opening hot doors. \u2026\n  \u2022 Returning for your belongings. \u2026\n  \u2022 Hiding. \u2026\n  \u2022 Do not use lifts. \u2026\n  \u2022 Use the appropriate fire extinguisher. \u2026\n  \u2022 Call the emergency services. \u2026\n  \u2022 Escape.\nIT IS IMPORTANT:\u00a0 Can you use a home fire extinguisher more than once?\n\nCan you grill during Red Flag Warning?\n\nWhen Red Flag Warning conditions are in effect, the wind has the highest potential to blow fire embers that can easily ignite fast-burning wildfires. Visitors may use propane cook stoves during their stay and are encouraged to regularly check weather conditions before choosing to grill outdoors.\n\nHow do you spot a wildfire?\n\nOne of the ways fires are detected is by lookout stations. These are situated at a location with extensive visibility and have associated structures manned by a lookout observer whose prime purpose is to locate and report wildfires.\n\nHow do you survive a wildfire?\n\nWhile in your home:\n\n  1. Stay calm, keep your family together.\n  2. Call 911 and inform authorities of your location.\n  3. Fill sinks and tubs with cold water.\n  4. Keep doors and windows closed, but unlocked.\n  5. Stay inside your house.\n  6. Stay away from outside walls and windows.\n\nWhat two things should you do before a wildfire approaches your house?\n\nRemove lightweight curtains. Move flammable furniture to the center of the room, away from windows and doors. Shut off gas at the meter; turn off pilot lights. Leave your lights on so firefighters can see your house under smoky conditions.\n\nCan a wildfire be prevented?\n\nCautiously burn debris and never when it\u2019s windy or restricted. Prineville District fuel crews burn debris piles to reduce summer fires and keep firefighters safe. \u2026 If you plan to burn debris on your private property, make sure you have water nearby (such as a garden hose) and never burn anything if it\u2019s windy.\n\nIT IS IMPORTANT:\u00a0 Your question: How can you tell if wood is good to burn?\n\nWhy is studying the weather helping in predicting the fires?\n\nAll fires need three things \u2014fuel, oxygen, and heat\u2014to ignite and be sustained. Weather can influence each of these factors, which is why it is called fire weather. Air temperature contributes to wild fires as a heat source.\n\nTame a raging fire",

They use desalted oligos and find by sequencing that over half the clones are \"perfect\" and note that using purified oligos will improve the \"hit rate\" but that for high throughput work it is not necessary. They believe that using a good anneal\/clone protocol is crucial to their high success rate. They also include a kinasing step in this procedure if needed. If you do not need to kinase your oligos, you can resuspend them to equimolar concentrations and skip to step 5.\n\n1. Bring sense and antisense oligos to 10 pmol\/ul by adding 100 ul r.o.-quality water per well (oligos started as separate plates, normalized to 1 nmol per well, and were sent to us lyophilized).\n\n2.

        "text":"Q. \u2013 Who are you?\n\nA. \u2013 Well, my name really is John Dee and I am a private meteorologist.\u00a0 What that means is that I provide custom weather forecasts to persons looking for a higher end and hopefully more accurate forecast than they can get for free from places like the National Weather Service and media.\u00a0 A little more information about me can be found in the About John section of the site.\u00a0 The one thing I would like to make clear is that I am NOT RETIRED!!!\u00a0 I maintain this site in addition to my full time job responsibilities.\u00a0 Since those other responsibilities pay my bills, I need to tend to them first.\u00a0 As a result, this site may not be updated all the time.\u00a0 But then again, it is free!\n\nQ. \u2013 John, your forecasts are generally pretty close, but it seems like you might be a little optimistic on the amounts at times.\u00a0 Am I just imagining that?\n\nA.- Well, let me first say that I am pretty conservative by nature and that carries over into my forecasting style.\u00a0 I usually do not put a ton of emphasis on the \u201cwild card\u201d possibilities of a weather forecast- just to try and be in the spotlight .\u00a0 I find the weather generally exciting enough without having to hype it.\u00a0 However, I am a snow lover and want snow to fall on me, or by me as much as anyone else.\u00a0 Because of that, you may find my snowfall forecasts to be a little on the optimistic side.\u00a0 I am aware of my optimism for snow and try and filter that out of my forecasts, but it is very hard!\u00a0 So if you find my forecasts a little optimistic, that is the reason. Another thing to keep in mind that the 5-10 day forecast is for a 6 day period, almost a full weeks time period. So when you see areas of the UP painted in Pink in the winter, that means a foot of snow is possible in a weeks time. Pretty close to average for the lake snow belts of the UP all winter long.\n\nQ. \u2013 Sometimes when I go to the different pages on the site, they are not updated, even by late in the day.\u00a0 Is it me?\u00a0 Or you?\n\nA. \u2013 The honest answer to that question is it could be both.\u00a0 There are times when my full time paying job keeps me too busy to be able to update items on this site.\u00a0 It is rare, but can happen.\u00a0 It may also be the way you have your browser set to handle viewing pages.\u00a0 To see the freshest page every time you need to set your browser to load that page fresh every time you visit.\u00a0 There are tips on how toset that up here.\n\nQ. \u2013 I love the snow cover maps, but sometimes they are not updated or do not show how much snow is on the ground in areas I am interested in.\u00a0 Is there places I can go on the internet to get additional snow cover data?\n\nA. \u2013 As mentioned in the first question, I am not retired.\u00a0 Sometimes my full time job keeps me too busy to be able to update everything on the site.\u00a0 I usually choose the snow cover maps for two reasons.\u00a0 1) They usually do not change all that dramatically from one day to another and 2) Most of the data that I use to create my custom snow cover maps can be found in my links section, so you can go there to see how much snow is on the ground for a particular location if my maps do not have what you are looking for.\n\nQ.- How often does the snow get cleared from the platform?\n\nA. Every morning.\n\nQ.- I see tracks in the snow by the snow station, what are they?\n\nA.\u00a0 Early in the winter, the tracks are from deer that roam the property. Once the snow gets deep, the deer \u201cyard up\u201d and any tracks after that are from me clearing snow off the satellite or snow station.\n\nQ.- Sometimes it looks like you have piled snow up around the snow gauge, am I seeing things, or is that true?\u00a0 And if so, why, are you trying to make it look like more snow is on the ground that is really there?\n\nA.-\u00a0 One thing you can always count on me to do is to never lie about how much snow is on the ground up here.\u00a0 I feel that one of the main reasons why the site is getting over 10 million hits a month is because the visitors know they can trust what I say.\u00a0 Thus, I think the worst thing I can do is to ever lie or misrepresent the snow conditions up here.\u00a0 Now, with that said, I do throw snow up against the snow gauge from time to time.\u00a0 The reason for that is because the snow gauge will either block out the snow from falling directly against it or the winds will swirl around the gauge and cause a depression to form in the snow right against the gauge.\u00a0 I will throw snow into the depression to bring it up to the same level of the snow around it, taking care to use loose snow so that it will compact at roughly the same rate as the surrounding snow.\u00a0 Also, if I ever throw too much snow in there, then I make sure to remove enough so that it is level with the surrounding snow.\nAs a side note to this, I will from time to time take pictures of the trails and post them to show the general conditions.\u00a0 However, I do not get too much into reporting trail conditions because they change on a daily basis and on weekends on an hourly basis.\u00a0 I have ridden down a trail Saturday morning on flat and great snow only to return that afternoon on 1-2 foot moguls.\u00a0 So please refrain from asking me what conditions are like.\u00a0 Anything I tell you could be completely different in just a few hours.\n\nQ.- Your historical weather page says you have picked up 10\u2033 of snow in the past 2 days, but yet your snowcover has only increased by 3, what gives?\n\nA.-\u00a0 The majority of the snow we see in the Keweenaw is Lake Effect.\u00a0 It is very light and fluffy because it is composed mainly of air.\u00a0 After a period of time, gravity will cause the snow to settle and squish much of the air out of the snow.\u00a0 I have found that lake effect snow generally settles at a rate of about 6:1, meaning that over time, 6\u2033 of lake effect snow will settle to about 1\u2033.\u00a0 Much of the settling takes place in the first 24-36 hours after falling and then slows down over the next few days and may take up to a week to finally settle completely.\u00a0 The settling process is why we can have over 20 feet of snow fall in a season, but yet have only 4-5 feet on the ground.\n\nQ.- Does a cold or warm summer\/autumn give us a better chance of a warm or cold winter?\n\nA.- The honest answer to that is no.\u00a0 However, I will say this:\u00a0 The weather does like to balance things out in the long term.\u00a0 By this I mean if a location has been running significantly above average in temperature for an extended period of time (a few months or more), then there are better than average chances that the weather pattern will flip in an attempt to balance things out.\u00a0 Sometimes this flip comes at a time which matches up with the season and sometimes the flip will happen halfway through the season. Think of it this way- No drought lasts forever, no heat wave lasts for ever and no cold spell lasts for ever.\u00a0 Seasons can be hot or cold, dry or wet, but years are usually not significantly warmer or wetter than average.\u00a0 Over time, Mother Nature always likes to balance out the score.\nTo make this a little more clear, lets look at an example:\u00a0 Let\u2019s say that the temperatures from October through December 15th have been above by a meaningful amount.\u00a0 My \u201cbalance things out\u201d theory would say that it cannot stay warm forever and eventually things will need to go the other way to balance the temperature equation out.\u00a0 This does not mean that temps from Dec 16 through all of Jan and Feb will be below average.\u00a0 The below average temps might not arrive by the end of Jan or end of Feb or perhaps even the end of March, but sooner or later the weather will flip and things will cool off.\u00a0 The timing is what is important.\u00a0 Timing is everything EH?\nSo in a nutshell, a warm summer or autumn or both does not automatically mean the winter will be warm or cold.\u00a0 But the longer a region sees one weather anomaly occur, the better the chances become that the weather will flip flop to balance out the score card.\n\nQ.- Is there a connection between warm temps on the Great Lakes and more than average Lake Effect Snow?\n\nA.- The first thing to keep in mind is that the most important ingredient for LES (other than the lake being free of ice) is the atmosphere providing conditions suitable for LES cloud and snow development.\u00a0 No matter how warm the water might be, if you do not have the ingredients in the atmosphere available to make LES, it will not form!\nAs for the answer to the question at hand\u2026I cannot speak for all the Great Lakes, but it has been my experience that no matter what the Lake Superior temps are in the summer and autumn, by around Christmas time they are always sitting around 34-38 degrees. The big storms that occur in the autumn and early winter will stir up the lake and bring colder water up from below.\u00a0 Plus, the cold nights in November and December cool the lake off too. I suppose there can always be an odd year, and the lake could remain warmer than average into the depths of winter, but I have seen some very warm Lake Superior surface temps and by Christmas they were 34-38 degrees.\nSo the bottom line is: If you want lots of LES to occur off Lake Superior, pay more attention to the atmosphere than the lake temps!",

        "text":"Q: It has become common in the last year or two for manufacturers to offer GPS receivers, Glonass receivers and GNSS receivers. Are these receivers different? They seem to look the same.\n\nA: As most people in surveying know, GPS stands for Global Positioning System, a system created and maintained by the United States government. Glonass stands for GLObal NAvigation Satellite System, the satellite navigation system originally created by the Soviet Union that is now under the control of the Russian Federation. GNSS also stands for Global Navigation Satellite System; it is used as a generic acronym for any of the satellite navigation systems. The use of the term \u201cGNSS\u201d has become popular since the European Union created its new system named Galileo. Galileo is not an acronym; this system is named in honor of the famous Italian astronomer and scientist born in the 17th century.\n\nIn the United States, most manufacturers have offered satellite-based surveying technology using only the GPS satellites, but a few have also offered receivers with support for Glonass satellites. Typically, these were referred to as GPS-Glonass receivers. Even though Glonass satellites were launched beginning in the 1970s, the system has never had the design constellation of 24 satellites (21 operating plus three in-orbit spares). The number of operational Glonass satellites near the middle of this year was 16. Thus many manufacturers and users have been watching the Glonass constellation to determine if or when they should plan on operating surveying receivers with GPS and Glonass signals.\n\nThe Galileo system has only recently put into orbit the second of its test satellites; operational satellites are not expected to be placed in orbit before 2010. However, as the information about the signals broadcast by Galileo (and Glonass) is available now, many manufacturers are building their receivers with the (sometimes optional) capability to receive, decode and use those signals, as well. This can provide added positioning certainty or increase the possibility to determine position by using a few satellites from each different constellation in cases where there is significant signal blockage, such as in artificial and natural canyons, forested areas, etc. If you purchase a GNSS receiver today, you will only be able to use its GPS and Glonass capabilities. Once Galileo satellites become \u201clive\u201d and there are a sufficient number to make the system usable (even before it is declared fully operational), that same GNSS receiver may be able to use those new satellites. You should check with each manufacturer to determine what \u201cGNSS-capable\u201d means since it is not currently possible for you to test its Galileo system capability.\n\nQ: I understand that GPS uses a different coordinate system, even though surveyors develop coordinates on a plane coordinate system (State Plane, UTM, etc.) or a system devised by a local government agency--or even a completely arbitrary system developed for the conven-ience of the surveyor. Why not use the GPS coordinates in the future to enable easy conversion and use?\n\nA: GPS actually uses two types of GPS coordinate systems. One type, called the satellite reference coordinate system, is unique to each satellite in the system because it is based on each individual satellite\u2019s orbit parameters. The satellite reference coordinate system (remembering that all satellite orbits are elliptical) will not be described in detail here, but one of the axes connects the points of apogee and perigee (points farthest and closest to the Earth\u2019s center of mass), and the origin of the system is at the center of mass of the Earth.\n\nThe other coordinate system, the one more familiar to most surveyors, is often referred to as Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF). This system, also called the geocentric coordinate system, provides the terrestrial frame of reference so that points on Earth, whose positions have been determined by observing the satellites, can then be related to each other. In this system, the Earth\u2019s center of mass is the origin, the Z axis coincides with the polar axis (though it is defined much more rigorously), the X axis passes through the Greenwich meridian (0o longitude) at the equator and the Y axis passes through the eastern 90th meridian (90o east longitude) at the equator. All satellite reference coordinates are converted to ECEF using four angular parameters that are defined or, more properly, measured for each satellite. Thus, when your GPS receiver determines your position (autonomously or using point positioning), it uses Cartesian coordinates but not the way you commonly use them with Z representing the \u201cup\u201d direction. Once the position has been determined, if desired, the X-Y-Z position in the ECEF system may be converted to latitude, longitude and height (i.e., spherical coordinates where \u201czero height\u201d is the reference ellipsoid--WGS84, not \u201csea level\u201d).\n\nWhile the X-Y-Z coordinates of ECEF may be used to uniquely define a point on Earth, they are not convenient for surveying purposes for several reasons. The first reason is that the coordinate values are very large (we are a little under 4,000 miles, or approximately 21 million feet, from the center of mass). But the other two reasons are more important: ECEF coordinates don't coincide with our concepts of north, south, east and west, which makes visualizing points, lines and planes difficult; and the coordinates are also difficult to visualize with relative differences in heights. Thus, in practice, GPS coordinates typically require at least one more conversion to get to some type of geodetic or plane coordinate system.\n\nGIAA is a trade association of manufacturers, suppliers and distribution partners encompassing the present and emerging technologies in surveying, GPS, engineering, construction, GIS\/LIS and related fields.\n\n\nRegular Members:\n\nLeica Geosystems Inc.\n\nMagellan Professional\n\n\nSokkia Corp.\n\n\nTrimble Navigation Ltd.\n\nAssociate Members:\n\nPOB magazine\n\nThe American Surveyor magazine\n\nProfessional Surveyor magazine\n\nAffiliate Members:\n\nCrain Enterprises Inc.",

        "text":"What is a Cartesian diver and how does it work?\n\nWhat is the purpose of Cartesian diver?\n\nThe Cartesian diver demonstrates the concept of density as a function of mass and volume. In the bottle\u2019s uncompressed state, the medicine dropper floats because there is not enough mass in the volume of the medicine dropper to make it sink (i.e. its density isn\u2019t great enough).\n\nWhy does the Cartesian Diver float at first?\n\nAs the water level rises in the diver, it becomes less buoyant and the diver sinks. As you release the pressure on the bottle, the compressed air expands and forces the water back out. The diver floats to the top of the bottle because now it is more buoyant.\n\nWhat made the Cartesian Diver to float again?\n\nWhen the pressure on the container is released, the air expands again, increasing the weight of water displaced and the diver again becomes positively buoyant and floats.\n\nWhat gas law is the Cartesian Diver?\n\nBoyle\u2019s Law describes the relationship between pressure and volume. Increasing pressure on a gas will decrease its volume. When the sides of the diver are pressed, the water is forced into the dropper, decreasing the volume of air in the dropper.\n\nIT IS INTERESTING:\u00a0 Where can you scuba dive in South Africa?\n\nWhat gas law is the Cartesian Diver experiment?\n\nPascal\u2019s law states that a pressure applied at any point on a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. When the bottle is pressurized (squeezed) the pressure within the entire bottle and Cartesian diver is increased.\n\nWhat do you mean by Cartesian?\n\n[ kahr-tee-zhuhn ] SHOW IPA. \/ k\u0251r\u02c8ti \u0292\u0259n \/ PHONETIC RESPELLING. adjective. of or relating to Descartes, his mathematical methods, or his philosophy, especially with regard to its emphasis on logical analysis and its mechanistic interpretation of physical nature.\n\nWhy is my Cartesian Diver not working?\n\nTroubleshoot the diver if it is not working.\n\nIt should just barely float, with the air bubble (the top of the dropper, the bend in the straw, etc.) just above the water. Make sure that the bottom is sealed for homemade divers, and add a little more or less water to the eyedropper to get the right balance.\n\nWhat happens to the balloon when you squeeze the bottle?\n\nWhen you punch a hole in a bottle, the air molecules in the bottle have an exit. They are pushed out as a balloon fills the space inside, resulting in room for the balloon to inflate. If the hole in the bottle is then plugged, the balloon stays inflated even when the mouth is removed.\n\nDoes the diver do work on entering the water?\n\nThe dive must be executed with grace and precision and should conform to the judges\u2019 \u201cexpectation of what the dive should look like in the air.\u201d Finally, the diver should enter the water gracefully and with limited splash.\n\nIT IS INTERESTING:\u00a0 Is code raft a foundation?",

Q: Does a qSTAR qPCR Primer Pair amplify an exon junction in a cDNA target?\nA: Whenever possible, an amplicon by a qSTAR qPCR Primer Pair covers exon junction or junctions.\n5. Q: Primer Pairs and Standards\nA: My qPCR machine is not on the list of compatible machines on the website. Do you provide qPCR primer panels in plates compatible with other machines?;Yes, we can provide our primer panels in other plates within approximately one week of receiving the custom order. Please email the catalog numbers of the qPCR primer panels needed plus the catalog number and manufacturer of the plates to techsupport@origene.com. Our technical support scientists will prepare a custom quote that can be used to order custom panels.\n6. Q: If I provide a list of genes I want to assay, can OriGene prepare a custom qPCR primer panel?\nA: Yes, OriGene can design a custom qPCR primer panel. Custom panels are offered for human and mouse genes in 200 reactions format for purchase, delivered in 2-D bar code matrix tubes.\n7. Q: Where can I find the sequence of the primers in each panel?\nA: Each panel is delivered with a USB drive that contains a spreadsheet of primer sequences and locations.\n8. Q: How much primer pair is in each well?\nA: Each well in 200 reactions format contains 2 nmol of lyophilized primer pair. Please re-dissolve in 200ul of water so the final concentration is 10uM. Each well in the PCR plate contains 10pmol of primer pairs. The primers will be re-suspended once the PCR reagents are added to the plate.\n9. Q: What is a qPCR template standard?\nA: A gene specific qPCR template standard is a tube of linear DNA made from a full-length cDNA plasmid. The copy number of a template standard solution is determined by the PicoGreen method and calculation based on MW.\n10. Q: Can a template standard be used in a probe-based qPCR?\nA: Yes, as long as a corresponding probe is used.\n11. Q: In your protocol, it is recommended to make six serial dilutions with one log of difference, can I make more dilutions and with different dilution scheme?\nA: Yes, as long as it is diluted in the qPCR detection range and each dilution is mixed thoroughly.\n12. Q: Can I use my own buffer to dilute the template standard instead of the buffer in the kit?\nA: Yes, as long as the buffer has no negative effects on qPCR.\n13. Q: Does OriGene offer custom-made template standards?\nA: Yes. Please contact our Tech Support at techsupport@origene.com\n14. Q: What is the OriGene guarantee on qPCR primers and template standards?\nA: OriGene qPCR primers and templates are warranted for SYBR Green qPCR experiments. If your experimental results are not satisfactory, our scientists will work with you to pinpoint the problem and, if it is determined that our products are at fault, OriGene will refund your money in the form of a credit.\n15. Q: How should I calculate the copy number of my gene of interest?\n  1. If the cDNA templates in your samples are single-stranded such as cDNA from RT reactions, theactual copy number of your gene of interest is two times the number you got by comparing to theqPCR standards. For example, if the copy number of your gene is 5 copy\/-\u00aa+\u00eel from the standardcurve of a qPCR program, the actual number is 10 copy\/-\u00aa+\u00eel. The reason is that the first cycle for asingle-stranded sample is to make the complementary strand; therefore, there is one cycle delayin the PCR reaction compared to the double-stranded cDNA template standard's reaction.\n  2. If the templates in your samples are double-stranded, the copy number of your gene of interest isthe same as that calculated according to the qPCR standards.\n16. Q: I am writing a paper for publication and need to describe this product. How should I cite?\nA: We recommend that you refer to the product by its specific catalog number and refer to us as OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD). Furthermore, we'd love to hear from you when your paper is published. Inform us and we will send a gift.\n\n\nInc 5000 Healthcare Company\nAll Products by: Title | Price | Category | Popularity | Best Sellers Topselling Products by: Title | Price | Category | Popularity | Favorites\nPopular Categories: Popularity | Our Choices | All-Round Favorites | Title Topselling Categories: Popularity | Our Choices | All-Round Favorites | Title",

        "text":"Frequently Asked Questions (under construction!):\n\nPlease note: \u00a0these are not a compilation of actual 'frequently asked questions' about AGiR! in general, not yet, at least. \u00a0(Do please send in your questions via the 'contact' link!)\nHowever, we hope that these 'filler' items will help you start thinking about potential exposure risks and DNA damage, even from such common things like hair dyeing... \u00a0\n\nbut first,\ndrum roll...\u00a0\nhere is the first real 'frequently asked question' answered:\n\nWhy does AGiR! use a lower case 'i' in its logo?\n\nThe lower case 'i' is used because the idea is that 'Genomic integrity' is a new\u00a0big picture concept,\u00a0putting together all the molecular details (DNA, RNA, and the epigenome) that impact genomic integrity to affect genetic functions in cells.\nAdditionally, several AGIR's exist out there already, with all four letters in caps! \u00a0:)\n\nAnd here is another commonly posed question:\u00a0\n\nWhy does the 'donate now' button lead to a page with bank account numbers (like that IBAN one) instead of going directly to a standard credit card form?\n\nAs a public service association, AGiR! is not about making money, although we are very grateful for any contributions which can help us to spread information and promote research on genomic integrity. \u00a0Furthermore, AGiR! would like for people to make their donations thoughtfully, and many people prefer to use their e-banking, rather than credit cards which always include extra charges, so we provide the account details simply in this way. \u00a0Please do ask, if you would like to donate and using these numbers is a problem for you!\n\nWonder what the next common question might be...\n\nHere it is!!\n\nWhy is the '3d logo trio' in the AGiR! front page so very soothing?\n(at least a few people have asked me that!!) must give cause to wonder\u2026\n\nCouldn't say for sure\u2026 Something about the timing of it all?\nBut, it is another site (loxia studios) that made it for us\u2026\n(We like it very much, too!)\n\nhmmm, wonder again what might be next\n\nIn the meantime, here is some food for thought (primarily in relation to the hairdye\/DNA aspects of genomic integrity, which is of course only one of many issues in this regard):\n\n\nChemistry allows a variety of interactions between substances and DNA, some of them quite damaging.\u00a0\nChemistry also allows hair dye ingredients to persist in the hairshaft, giving colors of various shades. \u00a0\nUnfortunately, these ingredients might also thus be able to get right into the cell nucleus (where genetic information is both stored and utilized for gene expression), with negative impacts on genomic integrity.\n\n\nWhen mutations are really fixed in the genome is usually considered to be sometime during or after S phase of the cell cycle, when DNA is being replicated (synthesized). \u00a0When the damage occurs to DNA can be simply from an initial encounter (i.e. UV radiation) or from interactions of DNA with metabolites of the absorbed pre-carcinogen (i.e. arylamines like aminophenol). Genomic integrity can also be disrupted because of secondary effects, for instance faulty cell cycle checkpoints or the generation of reactive oxygen species inside the cell.\u00a0\nWhen someone gets their hair done, they may be exposed to many toxic ingredients, although avoiding the scalp (dyeing 'meshes') can limit this. \u00a0However, most of the ingredients get rinsed down the drain. Thus, this illustrates how all this is also an environmental public health issue.\n\n\nAnything with a benzene ring structure might easily slip into between bases of nucleic acids, leading to disruption of normal cellular processes like gene expression ('transcription') or DNA replication and induce mutations. Aminophenol is one hair dye ingredient which is also a carcinogen from cigarette smoke, and is used to simplify discussions in genomicintegrity.org, but obviously many chemical interactions occur during hair dyeing, and the final chemical conformations of these ingredients could result in final cellular impacts. Other chemical modifications of DNA bases or its backbone (alkylation, oxidation, etc.) also can lead to transcription and\/or replication stresses and ultimately fix new mutations in the genome after the activity of repair enzymes. \u00a0\n\nRemember, outright toxicity to cells is not so problematic as their survival with the key mutation(s) in the wrong gene(s).\n\n\nWhy? \u00a0Perhaps to increase mutations, providing a base for selection? \u00a0This can be argued, but the biologist realizes that most non-silent mutations are deleterious.\nWhy worry?? \u00a0Wide use of such products (even though already outlawed in some areas of Europe) by ever younger and broader populations is a serious cause for concern. \u00a0Increases in rates of cancer and diseases like autism might be related to this broad use.\n\n\nIn all cells, within the cell nucleus, is the happening place for genomic integrity \u00a0:) , where chromosomes of DNA go through cycles of gene expression and, in the case of a required cell division, replication. \u00a0For all cells, genomic integrity needs to be maintained throughout these cell cycles! \u00a0Additionally, genomic integrity is plastic, changed by experience, as in the case of developing immune cells which undergo error prone recombination, and perhaps even the nervous system. \u00a0While we each carry a patchwork of mutations, these need to function correctly together to maintain controlled growth, development and repair. \u00a0When the wrong hits put the balance out of whack, the organism has lost genomic integrity, and it (and the society it is part of) suffers.\n\nRachel Aronoff,\nJul 18, 2014, 8:48 AM",
