The logic of the relationship between baptism and eucharist is discussed in light of the reference of both to the kingdom, and tied to the various forms of Jesus' meal ministry in the gospels. The essay also speculates about what in the present context of Episcopal church life might be driving the trend toward open communion.

When most people think of a Rastafarian they think of a pot-head or a dirty dread. Rastafarian is just as much of a religion as any other religion. Rastafarians have very strong beliefs in many aspects of life they go further than just religious beliefs. \u201cA man without knowing of his past is like a tree without roots\u201d (Marcus Garvey). \u201cRastafarians do not believe Haile Selassie is Jah God and that the Rastas are the chosen people. They claim to know these things and would never admit to believing them\u201d (Robert Nesta Marley). Many people throughout the world have a hard time understanding what it means to be a Rasta. For many they look at Rastafari as only a religion and not as a way of life.\n\nRastafarians, Rastafaris, Rastas, or Ras Tafarians originated from the followers of the Rastafari movement. The movement is named for Ras Tafari Makonnen, who was crowned Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia in 1930. Rastafaris dislike the term \u201cRastafarianism\u201d because they reject the \u201cisms and schisms\u201d that characterize oppressive and corrupt white society. The Rastafarian movement began with the teachings of Marcus Garvey (1887-1940) a black Jamaican who led a \u201cBack to Africa\u201d movement. He taught that Africans are the true Israelites and have been exiled to Jamaica and other parts of the world as divine punishment. Garvey encouraged pride in being black and worked to reverse the mindset of inferiority that centuries of enslavement and ingrained on the minds of blacks. Garvey was regarded as a second John the Baptist and famously prophesied in 1927, \u201cLook to Africa, for there a king shall be crowned.\u201d On November 2, 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen was crowned emperor of Ethiopia (He ruled until 1974). At his coronation he took the name Haile Selassie, meaning \u201cMight of the Trinity.\u201d Selassie also took the titles, \u201cConquering Lions if the Tribe of Judah, Elect...\ntracking img",

In particular the role of \"bonding\" and \"bridging\" capital is discussed: bonding with other Jews, bonding with research colleagues of similar orientations; and bridging with Jews different from myself, Jews in different cultural\/societal contexts, between Jews and non-Jews, and between scholars of different orientations. The role of mentors as facilitating and non-facilitating gatekeepers is also discussed. The reflective exercise is recommended as a re-centering device for all scholars. Suggestions for investing in further research in Jewish studies follow the expansion of both bonding and bridging research capital opportunities, such as establishing a think-tank facilitating ongoing dialogue between qualitative and quantitative researchers, and researchers using different units of analysis, in Jewish studies; developing a common core of community study questions and subsidizing their inclusion in community studies; establishing an international question bank to increase comparability and standardization in upcoming surveys; expanding the North American Jewish Data Bank to be global; and reaching out for comparability beyond the community of Jewish studies research.

In our first edition we have translated these four words by \"Going forth is life, coming home is death.\" We still cling to the same meaning, but we believe we have improved the diction by translating \"Abroad in life, home in death.\"\n\nWe must grant, however, that we might translate, \"He who enters life must return in death,\" but this interpretation that \"he who is born must die,\" is objectionable mainly because it is too trivial for Lao-tze.\n\nThe second paragraph in this chapter is obscure and seems beyond hope of\n\np. 175\n\nmaking good sense. A literal translation reads:\n\n\"Life's followers [are] ten have three\nDeath's followers [are] ten have three\nIn man's life the moving to death places are also ten have three.\"\n\nThis may mean either ten plus three, i. e., thirteen, or of ten take three, viz., \"three in ten.\"\n\nIf the translation \"thirteen\" be correct, \"thirteen retainers\" might according to Chinese folklore mean the five senses and the eight apertures which make thirteen avenues of life. This interpretation is based on the view of the commentator Lu Tze who may be right, and his view becomes somewhat probable when we bear in mind Chapter 52, where Lao-tze speaks of the mouth and the sense-gates as beset with danger. There he declares that the sage who keeps these openings closed will to the end of his life remain safe.\n\nI applied to Mr. Ng Poon Chew for an explanation and he writes:\n\n\"The passage is very vague and obscure, its meaning is no clearer to me\n\np. 176\n\nthan to you. I have consulted a few good Chinese scholars and they were all baffled. The words shi yiu san, \"ten have three,\" may mean here \"thirteen\" or \"three out of ten.\"\n\nIf we translate \"three in ten,\" the reader will naturally ask, Three times three in ten make nine, where is the tenth? And we would answer, it is \"the man who bases his life on goodness.\" Three in ten are anxious to live, three in ten somehow are doomed to death, and other three in ten walk blindly toward death; they all live life's intensity. There is but one who is above life and death, and this is the man who bases his life on goodness.\n\nIn this case we interpret the word fu, \"footman, follower, retainer,\" in the sense of \"pursuer.\"\n\nWe have chosen the former interpretation which seems to us the most probable, but do not claim to have solved the difficulty.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\nThe last section of this chapter finds a striking parallel in Plato's Ph\u00e6drus,\n\np. 177\n\nin the same book and on the same pagina (248) that contains the reference to the supercelestial being which is colorless and shapeless, quoted above in our comments on Chapter 14. The passage in Plato reads: \"There is a law of destiny that the soul which attains any vision of truth in company with a god is preserved from harm until the next period, and if attaining always is always unharmed.\"\u00a010\n\nThe same idea is expressed in the famous ode of Horace, Integer vitae. The belief that a truly good man is miraculously protected in danger is not uncommon in folktales and appears to have been an integral part of primitive religion.\n\nAre these coincidences between Plato and Lao-tze accidental or are we to look upon them as echoes of a notion which in both the West and East have been inherited from a distant prehistoric past? The latter is certainly not improbable.\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\n\n\"Reality\" here translates the word\n\np. 178\n\nwuh, \"concrete things,\" and commonly occurs in the phrase \"the ten thousand things\" which means the entire world.\n\nThe character sh\u2018 = \"expansion\" is a synonym of wei in the sense of assertion. The sage fears to be or to appear or to claim too much. He avoids self-aggrandizement.\n\n\n177:10 Jowett's translation.\n\nNext: Chapter 54",

The purpose of this study is to look at the changes that have occurred in history. To help me explain this I will be using documentary and archeologically evidence. The church was very pleasant to visit. It was in a quiet little village that was not that busy at all. The church was hidden by bushes and hidden down in a hollow. In my coursework I will talk about the history of the church here is a brief history of the church, which will be explained fully later on in the work. The church has been there since the Saxon's times, the first mention of St Germans Church was made on December 5th 936. We know this because in the 930's King Athelsten was conquering Cornwall and had written all the places he had conquered. We think St German Church was a cathedral because they have that is was not a cathedral from 1052. The church was been the centre of pilgrimages (monks) which was set up between 1161 and 1184. The monks brought a lot of money to the church and the town but Henry 8th closed or monasteries and kicked all the monks out, no one would then buy the premises so they decided to rent out the premises, which that meant that St Germans Church started to lose money and so did the town as well. Then in 1592 the Elliot family brought the Church and made changes to it, they added their own family pew and rebuilt the North Aisle. Location Position St Germans Church is located next to the magnificent house if the Elliot's. The church is in South East Cornwall on the River Lyner. The Church is built in a hollow to protect it form the prevailing southwesterly winds. It is behind a large hill called Colgear Hill, which would give it protection from Cornish Pirates coming up the estuary. ...read more.\n\n\nThis had a very bad effect as it dwarfed the columns and spoilt the proportion of the arches. The south aisle was very unusual with a grand wall, posh large perpendicular windows, which was built, form the money the reliquary chapel and the monks. In the church you can see a diagonal line and markings where the old roofline, which is visible in the present of the south Aisle, and North tower. If you look towards this diagonal line at the back of the church you will see a Coat of Arms of King Charles, which was presented to the Cornish Churches for their help during the Civil war. Behind the coat of arms is the diagonal line of stones marking the original lean - to aisle edging onto the central nave. Parts of the Clerestory windows can still be seen above the aisle column. Originally there was a row of clerestory windows either side of the nave and above the lean - aisles to let light into the main nave. Chancel Disaster \"The parish church answereth in bigness the large proportion of the parish and the surploss of the priory, a great part of whose chancel, anno 1592 fell suddenly down upon a Friday very shortly after public service was ended, which heavenly favour, of so little respite, saved many persons' lives, with whom immediately before it had been stuffed and devout charges of well disposed parishioners quickly repaired this ruin.\" Carew wrote this in the 1590's. It was a paragraph form 'The Survey of Cornwall' The paragraph above tells about when the chancel fell and what was happening just before the chancel fell down. This is evidence that there was a chancel and it did fall down. The chancel fell down three times but disastrously in 1592, after which time the grant east window of ten lights erected in its present position. ...read more.\n\n\nI don't think it is reliable as some of the documents are because he is married to someone who has been brought up in and wouldn't want to make St Germans sound like nothing has happened so he could be a bit bias to her. Is it corroborated? Some of the information is corroborated but not everything is corroborated. Other comments Because the document was written in 18th century the language it is written is quite old. Document 5 Source Hendenam Cornish church guide, 'Parochial, history of Cornwall' What does it say? This document writes about all the history of the church in a very brief way. It starts at the beginning when the church was just founded, then goes on to when the church was first written about by Athelsten. Then he wrote about the Diocesan bishopric in Cornwall. It is a significance of the importance of the Celtic church. When threw creation of bishopric was moved to Crediton and Exeter. Then he goes to say how the church changed through time and how the Elliot's became in charge. Is it authentic? I think this is authentic because it is a church guide which a lot of people will be reading, they don't want to be reading lies so that is why I think its authentic. Is it reliable? I think this document is reliable because it has a lot of over documents that confirm this as well, which is good. It is also written by someone who has nothing to do with the church and which makes it unique. Is it corroborated? I think this document is corroborated with most of the documents. 1. A lot of evidence saying Athelsten wrote about the church first. 2. The creation of the Diocesan Bishopric 3. The Bishopric was moved to Crediton ands Exeter 4. The church was redecorated 5. The priory became owners of some relics 6. The Elliot's took over the church Other comments The guide isn't written in a language that is difficult to read and tell you a quick summary of everything about eh church which is very good. ...read more.\n\nThe above preview is unformatted text\n\nThis student written piece of work is one of many that can be found in our GCSE Places of Worship section.\n\nFound what you're looking for?\n\n  \u2022 Start learning 29% faster today\n  \u2022 150,000+ documents available\n  \u2022 Just \u00a36.99 a month\n\nNot the one?

A number of Cambodian Buddhist temples are not only monasteries inhabited by monks but also residential places for laypeople of various categories, including female ascetics called daun chi. Cambodians in general view lay ascetics as needy people who have no family to rely on in their old age; most monastic laypeople are elderly. In reality, if we focus on food, we can see that lay ascetics do not depend entirely on the temples in which they live. From detailed observations at three temples in Phnom Penh, it is clear that temples are supported by the Buddhist community in general but that food for monks and laypeople comes through different systems of supply routes that are partly connected to each other. This article first explores how these two different food supply systems are run and maintained. Second, by depicting how female ascetics get involved in food-related practices, this article examines their dual position: female ascetics are temple residents just like monks but remain in the lay category.\n\nKeywords: Cambodia, Buddhism, temple, food, monk, lay ascetic, daun chi\n\nI\u2003Introduction\n\nIn Theravada Buddhist societies, which consist of people ordained as monks and laypeople, what kinds of roles are played by lay ascetics living in temples? While there have been countless studies on Theravada regions in Southeast Asia, studies that focus on laypeople in particular, especially those based in Cambodia and Laos, are very scarce. Lay ascetics1) have mostly been described as part of the faithful lay community or just mentioned on a footnote level as temple inhabitants who are subordinate to monks.\n\nWhile so-called revival movements of the bhikkhun\u012b (fully ordained female monk) order have recently taken place in Sri Lanka and Thailand, no such movements have occurred in Cambodia so far. It is believed that Cambodia has never had bhikkhun\u012b,2) but it has female renouncers in the lay category called daun chi (\u178a\u17bc\u1793\u1787\u17b8) or yeay chi (\u1799\u17b6\u1799\u1787\u17b8).3) There are some research works that focus on daun chi. Nobue Hamaya (2004) has carried out fieldwork on daun chi in Siem Reap and described their temple life, including their social engagement. Elizabeth Guthrie (2004) has provided historical analyses of laypeople\u2019s practices based on the key word \u201cpuos (\u1794\u17bd\u179f)\u201d and focused on one daun chi, who was a meditation teacher. The Buddhist Institute, Cambodia (2006) has surveyed daun chi life in one district and submitted concrete data on female renouncers\u2019 attributes. All of these works have given us thought-provoking analyses and presented new findings, but we still cannot see clearly who lay ascetics are and what it means to live as a temple resident within the lay category. For example, ANLWC,4) a socially engaged Buddhist group that Hamaya wrote about, is unique to Cambodia, but its activities are very limited in region and even its name is not known widely among daun chi in general. As far as I have observed, most lay ascetics are not social workers or meditation teachers or Buddhist university students but seem simply to live in a temple. Therefore, to understand the general situation of daun chi, focusing on a particular group or prominent persons is probably not enough. What kind of human relationships do they have within a temple community? In order to understand lay ascetics better, we probably need to not only focus on daun chi but also observe a temple as a whole, including monks and other people.\n\nThis article focuses on, among various aspects of Cambodian Buddhist temples, food supply for temple residents, placing an emphasis on the roles and practices of lay ascetics. I use the word \u201cpractices\u201d here in a broad sense; it means not only, for instance, purely religious practices in search of enlightenment, but also daily activities in Buddhist temples. I try to analyze Cambodian Buddhist temples through the real lives of lay temple inhabitants in order to understand how the religion \u201clives\u201d in today\u2019s Cambodian society.\n\nIt has often been said that in Theravada Buddhist societies, temple going is part of people\u2019s everyday lives\u2014and Cambodia is no exception. More than 90 percent of the total population of Cambodia is thought to believe in Buddhism, which is the national religion as defined in the Cambodian constitution. In fact, people have a number of occasions to visit Buddhist temples\u2014such as during Buddhist festivals, most of which are national holidays. On a \u201cprecept (p. s\u012bla)5) day,\u201d which occurs four times in the lunar calendar, temples in both urban and rural areas are crowded with people gathering to \u201cseek precepts (\u179f\u17bb\u17c6\u179f\u17b8\u179b)\u201d from monks. As a daily practice, many families place freshly cooked rice and other food in the alms bowls of monks who come to their threshold in the morning. It is very common for laypeople to invite monks to chant at rituals held in their homes, including funerals, memorial rites for the deceased, and ceremonies wishing for a long life for living parents.\n\nTemple-goers tend to be middle-aged or elderly. The institution of the Buddhist temple has much to do with people\u2019s life stages. In other words, Cambodians have a clear idea that their life as older people will naturally entail activities such as visiting a temple to listen to monks\u2019 dhamma talks (\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u178a\u17c2\u1784\u1792\u1798\u17cc), receiving and keeping lay precepts, serving the monks by doing chores in a temple, preparing for festivals, and even becoming lay ascetics or monks living in a temple.\n\nThese activities, especially those occasions where laypeople have contact with monks, have one practice in common: offering food to monks. Besides placing food in the monks\u2019 alms bowls, which is the most direct act, people also bring food to monks on precept days. In addition, when people invite monks to their houses to chant, if the monks are there before noon they are always offered a meal.\n\nToday, Buddhism in Cambodia follows the Theravada tradition, which originated in Sri Lanka. Following the teachings of Theravada Buddhism, monks must live only on food offered by others. For laypeople, giving food to monks is one of the most important religious obligations in support of Buddhism. This basic relationship between monks and laypeople has been described by many scholars. For example, Masaki Onozawa ([1982] 1995), who studied Thai Buddhist society, points out that there are two kinds of aspiration among Thai Buddhists: monks aspire to supreme enlightenment (p. nibb\u0101na), while laypeople aspire to make merit (p. pu\u00f1\u00f1a) so as to realize a better life in this world and the next. Onozawa explains that monks and laypeople are in an interdependent relationship through the exchange of materials (food and donations) and Buddhist \u201cmerit\u201d: material to monks and merit to laypeople.6)\n\nThis view of the relationship between monks and laypeople can also, in general, be applied in Cambodia. So what about lay ascetics? They live in temples but are not ordained as monks, so they cannot go out for alms. Sumiko Yamazaki (2011) provides a unique analysis of conflicts in Buddhist communities about food gathering\/offering activities in a Lao-speaking area of Stung Treng Province, but she takes into account only food for monks, not food for lay ascetics.\n\nTherefore, this article will examine the food supply in Cambodian Buddhist temples based on information collected in my own fieldwork, focusing on laypeople\u2019s lives and practices.

In any case, in this article I take a voatt to be a temple. In 2013 there were 4,676 temples in Cambodia (AKP 2013).9) In the plains region that includes the capital, Phnom Penh, and its surrounding provinces, there is a very high density of temples as well as population; almost every commune has more than one temple.10)\n\nA voatt\u2019s compound normally contains the main hall (\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179c\u17b7\u17a0\u17b6\u179a, p. vih\u0101ra) with a sacred area (p. s\u012bma) marked by sacred stones buried underground, where ordination ceremonies are held; the monks\u2019 dining hall (\u179f\u17b6\u179b\u17b6\u1786\u17b6\u1793\u17cb11)), where laypeople gather on precept days and for various other ceremonies; and the monks\u2019 huts or dormitories (\u1780\u17bb\u178a\u17b7, p. ku\u1e6di).

It argues for an indigenous origin of Pentecostalism in Rajasthan, as it is a product of local Spirit revivals in the existing churches and the missionary activities of Indian Pentecostals. It also reveals that both the intra-church as well as extra-church issues place Pentecostals in a \u2018missio-ethical dilemma.\u2019 The thesis aims to suggest \u2018a contextual missiology of the Spirit,\u2019 as a new model of contextual missiology from a Pentecostal perspective, which has emerged from this study. The inherent theological characteristics of Pentecostalism underline the pneumatological foundation of a contextual Pentecostal missiology. As a contextual missiology of the Spirit it has certain contextual features. By dealing with the global-local tension, it can be considered a glocal missiology. It is capable of promoting ecumenicity at various levels, and so it is an ecumenical missiology. By empowering people to engage in spiritual as well as socio-political issues, it aims to be a transformational missiology. As it is concerned with the well-being of the community, it has the potential to become a public missiology.\n\nType of Work:Ph.D. thesis.\nSupervisor(s):Anderson, Allan\nSchool\/Faculty:Colleges (2008 onwards) > College of Arts & Law\nDepartment:School of Philosophy, Theology and Religion\nSubjects:BR Christianity\nBX Christian Denominations\nInstitution:University of Birmingham\nID Code:294\nThis unpublished thesis\/dissertation is copyright of the author and\/or third parties.

        "text":"William Petersen on the Concept of an \u201cOriginal\u201d Text\n\nWilliam Peterson (1950 \u2013 2006) was one of the most erudite scholars when it came to New Testament textual criticism. He was probably best-known as one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Tatian\u2019s\u00a0Diatessaron, the most prominent early harmony of the four gospels, likely composed around the year 170 CE. About five years after his death, a volume of Peterson\u2019s collected essays was published by Brill. I recently revisited one essay in the middle of that volume, as it relates directly to the question I\u2019ve been exploring regarding current debates about the status of the designation \u201coriginal text\u201d to describe the text being reconstructed by New Testament textual critics. The essay is titled, \u201cWhat Text Can New Testament Textual Criticism Ultimately Reach?\u201d and it was first published in 1994!\u00b9\n\nPetersen\u2019s essay is divided into three parts. Part 1 sketches the problem in two ways. First, he notes the difficulty of defining what is meant by the \u201coriginal\u201d text, particularly when it comes to the text of the New Testament. Petersen uses the gospel of Mark as his example, asking whether our understanding of the \u201coriginal\u201d Mark is based on fourth-century (or later) manuscripts or on the minor agreements between the gospels of Matthew and Luke, since most scholars believe that Matthew and Luke both had access to their own copies of Mark\u2019s gospel.\n\nSecond, Petersen points out the fact that despite the monumental nature of recent discoveries of early Christian papyri, as well as the work being done on the citations of New Testament texts among the early church fathers, our critical editions of the Greek New Testament have remained virtually the same since the text of Westcott and Hort, which relied heavily on the fourth century manuscripts, Sinaiticus (\u05d0) and Vaticanus (B). Here\u2019s how Petersen describes the situation:\n\nThe papyri have been trumpeted as offering a text which is \u201ccloser to the original\u201d than any other extant evidence. Yet it is simply a fact that\u00a0nowhere in the\u00a0entire apparatus for the gospels in Nestle-Aland27\/UBS4 is there a\u00a0single instance where a reading supported\u00a0just by the papyri, or by\u00a0just the papyri and Patristic evidence has been adopted as the text. This poses an awkward question: If, as alleged, the papyri preserve a text \u201ccloser to the original,\u201d then why do they not contribute any new readings to the critical text? (221-222)\n\nPart 2 of the essay illustrates this problem with three examples. For the sake of brevity, I\u2019ll only focus on the first, which is drawn from the pericope about the rich young ruler (Matthew 19:17\/\/). Here is the text (with parallels) from the current critical edition (NA28):\n\nMatthew 19.17 Mark 10.18 Luke 18.19\n\u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.\n\n\nMark and Luke have identical texts, with Jesus responding to the rich young ruler by saying, \u201cNo one is good except God alone.\u201d In Matthew\u2019s gospel, however, Jesus\u2019 response is briefer, \u201cThere is only one who is good.\u201d\n\nPetersen points out for his readers that Justin Martyr (c. 150 CE) almost certainly quotes the Matthean version of this pericope, but he includes the phrase \u201cmy father in the heavens\u201d afterwards.\n\nJustin Martyr (c. 150 CE): e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n\nPetersen goes on to show that this longer reading in Justin Martyr is actually found in several early Christian sources. He notes the following examples (225-226):\n\n  1. Tatian, Diatessaron (c. 172 CE), as per Ephrem Syrus, Commentary on the Diatessaron, XV.9:\n    \u2022 \u071a\u0715 \u0717\u0718 \u0720\u0721 \u071b\u0712\u0710 \u0710\u0712\u0710 \u0715\u0712\u072b\u0721\u071d\u0710\n  2. Irenaeus, Against Heresies, I.20.2 (pre-185 CE):\n    \u2022 \u0395\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n  3. Hippolytus, Refutation of All Heresies, V.7.25\u00a0(pre-222 CE):\n    \u2022 e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n  4. Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, V.10.63 (c. 207 CE):\n    \u2022 e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1\n  5. The Pseudo-Cementine Homilies XVI.3.4 (c. 260 CE):\n    \u2022 \u1f41 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 e\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2\n  6. Old Latina MS e (Mattew; 5th cent.):\n    \u2022 Unus est bonus, pater.\n  7. Old Latina MS d (Luke; 5th cent.):\n    \u2022 Nemo bonus nisi unus Deus pater\n\nThese witnesses, which are are all early and broadly distributed, support Justin\u2019s citation of Matthew\u2019s text. This means, as Petersen notes, \u201cthe oldest-known version of this Matthean pericope contains the phrase \u2018my Father in the heavens'\u201d (226, emphasis original). Yet despite this evidence our critical editions continue to present Matthew\u2019s text as only \u03b5\u1f37\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f41 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2.\n\nThis leads to Part 3 of Petersen\u2019s essay. Given the early nature of the textual variant and its attestation above (with similar evidences for the other two examples he provides) why have we not changed our critical editions to fit this evidence? Petersen argues, once again, that textual critics have become too attached to the so-called \u201cAlexandrian\u201d or \u201cNeutral\u201d text represented by the later fourth century majuscules \u05d0 and B. \u00a0Instead of allowing earlier witnesses (i.e. the papyri and especially the patristic sources) to play a crucial role in determining the earliest form of the text of the New Testament, critics tend to use them merely as witnesses in support of readings that were already preferred on the basis of \u05d0 and B. More controversially, Petersen states that certain \u201ctheological standards\u201d are also keeping critics from adopting Justin\u2019s version of Matthew 19:17, since these theological standards would deem that particular variant \u201cunacceptable\u201d (234). In fact, this is Petersen\u2019s explanation for why these variant readings were not retained in the manuscript tradition: \u201cthe reading was suppressed because\u00a0in later times it was no longer\u00a0theologically acceptable\u201d (231, emphasis original). What makes them theologically unacceptable, according to Petersen, is that they are adoptionistic in nature. But this sort of explanation of the evidence seems reductionistic, and it fails to take account of all the available evidence we have on this particular variant. As Holger Strutwolf notes in his article entitled, \u201cOriginal Text and Textual History,\u201d\n\nWhat is strange about [Petersen\u2019s] theory is that the supported orthodox reading, which is supposed to have pushed away the reading that later came under suspicion of heresy, did not become the majority reading. Quite the contrary, it is attested only by very few, but very old and good witnesses, while the majority of manuscripts support a reading that is far from sounding more orthodox. In fact, the majority reading appears as heretical and dogmatically incorrect as the text of Justin.\u00b2\n\nIt therefore seems very unlikely that this particular variant is another case of the so-called \u201corthodox corruption\u201d of scripture. In any case, one does not have to agree with Petersen\u2019s explanations for why the variant given above is excluded from our critical editions in order to see the value of his broader contention.\n\nSo, in the end, how does Petersen answer the question posed by the essay\u2019s title? Here is how the essay concludes:\n\nThe question facing textual critics today is not \u201cHow far back\u00a0can\u00a0we go?\u201d\u2026we can go back to the time of Ignatius,\u00a0c. 107 CE. Rather, the question is \u201cHow far back do we\u00a0wish\u00a0to go?\u201d The answer to this question is never stated openly; rather, it must be intuited from the sources used to construct the critical text of a particular edition.\n\nAt present it appears that the furthest back we wish to go is the third century, and the method we use is the agreement of the papyri and the uncials. If, however, we really wish to\u2026reconstruct the text \u201cas close as possible to the original,\u201d then we must avail ourselves of the Patristic sources\u00a0and take their witness seriously. And unlike the papyri, the use of Patristic evidence will, as our exhibits have shown, significantly alter the shape of the critical text. (235)\n\nWorks Cited\n\n\u00b9 William L.

A.D.), and is in three strata associated with the three leaders, al-Ash\u2018ari, al-Baqilani, and al-Ghazali. Such a development, of course, is principally of interest for the internal history of Islam and the evolution of Muslim theology, but it had its influence also on the transmission of Arabic thought to Latin Christendom in two ways: (i.) directly, in that al-Ghazali was established as one of the great Arabic authorities when the Latins began to study the interpreters of Aristotle, and his teaching is quoted by St. Thomas Aquinas and other scholastic writers; and (ii.) indirectly, because a considerable part of the work of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) takes the form of controversy against the followers of al-Ghazali; his Destruction of the Destruction, for example, is a refutation of al-Ghazali's Destruction of the Philosophers. It thus becomes imperative to know something about the position and teaching of al-Ghazali and the influences which prepared the way for his work.\n\np. 209\n\nSuch a movement as orthodox scholasticism was inevitable. The position at the end of the third century was quite impossible. The orthodox Muslim adhered strictly to tradition, and entirely refused to admit \"innovation\" (bid\u2018a): he had been forced into this position as a reaction against his earlier ready acceptance of Plato and Aristotle as inspired teachers, for the later errors of the Mu\u2018tazilites showed what extremely dangerous conclusions could be drawn by those who came under Hellenistic influence, and the more accurately the Greek philosophers were studied the worse the heresies gathered from them. Orthodox thought held itself carefully aloof from the Mu\u2018tazilites and philosophers on the one side, and from the Shi\u2018ites and Sufis on the other, confining itself to the safe studies of Qur\u2019an exegesis, tradition, and the canon law in which at Baghdad the reactionary influence of Ibn Hanbal was predominant. The whole of the third century had been a time of reaction on the part of the orthodox, very largely due to the unfortunate attempt of al-Ma\u2019mun to force rationalism on his subjects. Al-Ghazali tells us in his \"Confessions\" that some sincere Muslims felt themselves bound to reject all the exact sciences as of dangerous tendency, and so repudiated scientific theories as to eclipses of the sun and moon. All speculation lay under a ban, because it led to \"innovation\" in belief or in practice; it was contrary to orthodoxy to use the methods of Greek philosophy to prove revealed doctrine as much as it was to impugn it, for both alike were innovations\n\np. 210\n\non the traditional usage; nothing was known of spiritual matters save what is actually stated in the Qur\u2019an and tradition, and from this nothing could be deduced by the use of argument, for logic itself was a Greek innovation, at least as applied to theology: only that was known which was actually stated, and no explanation of the statement was lawful. Thus, when Ahmad ibn Hanbal was examined by the inquisitors of al-Ma\u2019mun he replied only by quoting the words of the Qur\u2019an or tradition, refusing to draw any conclusions from these statements and admitting no conclusions drawn, keeping silence when arguments were proposed to him, and protesting that such examination as to religious belief was itself an innovation.\n\nThis position was hardly satisfactory to those who had inherited any part of the Hellenic tradition, and it ultimately became impossible. An organic body which cannot adapt itself to its surroundings is doomed to decay. The Islamic state had sufficient vitality to meet the new conditions introduced by its expansion to Syria and Persia, and now the time had come for Islamic theology to adapt itself to the new thought that was invading it. As we have seen, the philosophers al-Kindi and al-Farabi were loyal Muslims, and had no suspicion that their investigations were leading to heretical conclusions, and such was undoubtedly the case with the earlier Mu\u2018tazilites also, but results had justified the orthodox in a suspicious attitude towards \"argument\" (kalam). Now, towards the close of the third century the attempt to find an\n\np. 211\n\northodox kalam appears as a movement which originates with the Mu\u2018tazilites, of whom a section of the more conservative sought to return to an orthodox stand-point, and to use kalam in theology in defence of the traditional beliefs as against the heretical conclusions which were in circulation. Following a somewhat later usage we may employ this term kalam to denote an orthodox philosophical theology, that is to say, one in which the methods of philosophy were used, but the primary material was obtained from revelation, and thus one which was closely parallel with the scholastic theology of Latin Christendom.\n\nWe have cited the name of al-Ash\u2018ari as representative of the first stage of this movement, but it is equally represented by the contemporary al-Mataradi in Samarqand and by at-Tahawi in Egypt. Of these, however, at-Tahawi has quite passed into oblivion. For long the Ash\u2018arites and the Mataridites formed rival orthodox schools of kalam, and al-Mataridi's system still has a certain vogue amongst Turkish Muslims, but the Ash\u2018arite system is that which commands the widest assent. Theologians reckon thirteen points of difference between the two schools, all of purely theoretical importance.\n\nAl-Ash\u2018ari was born at Basra in 260 or 270, and died at Baghdad about 330 or 340. At first he was an adherent of the Mu\u2018tazilites, but one Friday in A.H. 300 he made a public renunciation of the views of that party, and took up a definitely orthodox position; in the pulpit of the great mosque at Basra\n\np. 212\n\nhe said, \"They who know me know who I am; as for those who do not know me, I am \u2018Ali b. Isma\u2018il al-Ash\u2018ari, and I used to hold that the Qur\u2019an was created, that the eyes of men shall not see God, and that we ourselves are the authors of our evil deeds; now I have returned to the truth; I renounce these opinions, and I take the engagement to refute the Mu\u2018tazilites and expose their infamy and turpitude\" (Ibn Khallikan, ii. 228). From this it will be perceived that the doctrines then regarded as characteristic of the Mu\u2018tazilites were (i.) that the Qur\u2019an was created, (ii.) the denial of the possibility of the beatific vision, and (iii.) the freedom of the will.\n\nIn the period after this change al-Ash\u2018ari wrote a controversial work against the Mu\u2018tazilites, which bears the name Kitab ash-Sharh wa-t-Tafsil, \"the book of explanation and exposition\"; he was the author also of religious treatises called Luma \"flashes,\" Mujaz \"abridgment,\" Idah al-Burhan \"elucidation of the Burhan,\" and Tabiyin \"illustrations.\" His real importance, however, lay in founding a school of orthodox scholasticism, afterwards more fully developed by al-Baqilani, and gradually spreading through the Muslim world, although strongly opposed on the one side by the falasifah, who saw in its teaching the introduction of traditional beliefs limiting and restricting the Aristotelian doctrine, and on the other side by the more reactionary orthodox, who disapproved the use of philosophical methods as applied to theological subjects. This use of philosophy\n\np. 213\n\nin the explanation and defence of religion came to be known as kalam, and those who employed it were called mutakallamin.\n\nIn dealing with the old problems of Muslim theology, such as the eternity of the Qur\u2019an, the freedom of the will, etc., the Ash\u2018arites do seem to have produced a reasonable statement of doctrine, which yet safeguarded the main demands of orthodoxy.\n\n(a) As to the Qur\u2019an, they held that it was eternal in God, but its expression in words and syllables was created in time. This does not of course mean that the expression was due to the Prophet to whom it was revealed, but to God, so that the doctrine of literal inspiration was asserted in the strictest form. Nor was it thus created when it was revealed, but long before in remote ages when it was first uttered to the angels and \"august beings,\" and was afterwards disclosed by the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad. This, which is now the orthodox belief, has furnished an opportunity for controversy to Christians and modern rationalists, who have fixed upon the use of particular words, introduced into Arabic as loan words from Syriac, Persian, and Greek, and appear in the Qur\u2019an: how, they ask, can it be explained that words revealed at a remote period of past eternity, long before the creation of the world, as it is commonly asserted, show the influence of foreign languages which were brought to bear upon Arabic in the 7th cent. A.D.? and Muslim apologists, who have always maintained the absolute\n\np. 214\n\npurity of Qur\u2019anic Arabic as one of the evidences of Divine origin, seem to regard this as a serious difficulty. The view that the Qur\u2019an is eternal in substance, and thus in substance revealed to the Prophet, who was left to express it in his own words, which would thereby show the limitations of his time, is not admitted by the orthodox. It will be noted also that the Ash\u2018arite teaching evades and does not answer an old difficulty: if the substance of the Qur\u2019an is the wisdom of God and is co-eternal with Him, even though emanating from Him, we have something other than God, namely, His wisdom, eternally existing with Him, and this can be represented as parallel with the persons of the Christian Trinity, so as to be inconsistent with the absolute unity of God.\n\n(b) This brings us to the attributes of God generally. The Ash\u2018arites in this controversy side with the traditional school against the philosophers. Of the ten Aristotelian categories... (truncated)",

        "text":"Page is loading...\n\nSession 9: An Examination of the Status of Laws in the Religious System\n\nPrinciples of Islamic political theory\n\nIn relation to philosophy and the Islamic political theory, it must be borne in mind that there are some people who accept all its principles, some who acknowledge some of them, and, some who accept none of them. Nonetheless, in a bid to elucidate and establish this theory, it is imperative to explain these principles. Since some of these principles are self-explanatory, we shall mention and explain them briefly, and only explain other principles which require more space for discussion and examination.\n\n1. Law\n\nOne of the principles and presumptions of the discussion is society\u2019s need for law. As it was said earlier, another principle in the Islamic political theory is that law must be sanctioned by God. Its implementer must also have the permission of God. To say that law must be divine is that God Himself enacts the law and reveals it in the Qur\u2019an, or the Prophet (s) or an infallible Imam (\u2018a) is given the authority to enact the law, or those who are vested with authority by the Prophet or an infallible Imam (\u2018a) enact different orders in diverse circumstances.\n\nTherefore, we shall have three types of divine law:\n\n1. The law which God Himself has enacted; in which the Prophet (s) or any infallible Imam (\u2018a) does not have any role;\n\n2. The law which the Prophet (s) or an infallible Imam (\u2018a) has enacted by the authority vested in him by God;\n\n3. The variable orders which certain individuals enact with the permission of an infallible Imam (\u2018a) and will be binding for the Islamic society because their source can finally be traced to the will of God.\n\nThus, God Himself directly enacts the law and His decrees are mentioned in the text of the Qur\u2019an. However, with respect to the implementation of the law, God is not the agent or implementer. The implementer must be the one who is present in society and can be seen by the people, bids and forbids, and implements the laws.\n\nIt refers first and foremost to the Prophet (s) or an infallible Imam (\u2018a), and at the second level, to the person who is granted executive authority by the Prophet (s) or an infallible Imam (\u2018a); i.e. those who at the time of the Prophet (s) or in the presence of an infallible Imam (\u2018a) were sent as governors and rulers to Islamic territories and provinces to implement those laws. During the period of ghaybah, the fuqaha, who are appointed through general designation, are responsible for implementing the laws.\n\nWhat has been mentioned so far broadly deals with the macrocosm of the Islamic government viz. legislation and implementation. The judicial organ in reality is part of the executive body and because of its special importance it enjoys an independent status.\n\nStatus of natural laws and statutory laws\n\nOne of the principles and presumptions of our discussion is the need of codifying law for society. The second principle is, according to our view, the binding law is that which is directly or indirectly enacted by God. Those opposing this view say that society is not in need of law whether it is enacted by God or anybody else. This theory has no proponent today because nobody can deny this need of society. Nowadays, even in a village where only a few people live, the existence of laws and orders to be followed by people is regarded imperative.\n\nIn the past, however, when living conditions were simple, some believed that they were not in need of statutory laws. According to them, the intellect alone could discern a set of natural laws by knowing the natural law, and there was no need of special people to enact laws. In the past, the theory of natural right and natural law was initially presented to human societies in such a way that if they were asked, \u201cWhich law should we abide by?\u201d they would answer, \u201cLook at your self or look at the universe to learn which law is prevailing, and the same law will prevail in society,\u201d proving that even the theory of natural law has clearly accepted the principle of the need for law.\n\nNo thinker has ever claimed that mankind is not in need of any law, even natural laws. The bone of contention among philosophers is: which is sufficient\u2014rational, natural, or divine law? That is, are laws which all people can discern by their intellect sufficient for society? Or, do we also need specific statutory laws?\n\nAs we have said, if ever it was imagined in the past that natural laws, rational laws, or \u2018rational independents\u2019 [mustaqillat-e \u2018aqliyyeh] were sufficient to meet the needs of society, today the said assumption is unacceptable. Neither is there any point of raising and examining it. Nowadays, by just looking around, every person realizes that he needs hundreds of social and international laws in his complex domestic, external and international situation.\n\nAmong social and domestic laws are laws related to traffic and transportation. If there are no traffic laws what will be the state of transportation and traffic in every city and town? If the speed of a vehicle and its right of way (whether left or right) and all the other traffic and driving rules are not determined, what will happen? In which part of the world are a group of people leading a safe and sound life in spite of non-observance of these laws?\n\nIt is true that driving rules are not uniformly codified in all countries. In countries like Britain and Japan the driving seat is on the right side while driving on the left side of the road, while in all other countries including Iran, it is the opposite\u2014but driving rules are codified anyway and the drivers are aware of the rules, knowing on which side of the road to drive. The above example is among the cases that shows the indispensability of law in society. Certainly, this necessity can also be felt in other issues such as family and international law.\n\nOne of the instances which show the exigency of the enactment of international laws is the issue related to the Caspian Sea, which is a source of dispute on the exploration of its natural resources among littoral states. It cannot be accepted that every state can exploit the Caspian oil, gas and other resources without any law. In fact, there has to be a sort of regime that stipulates the extent of exploitation of Caspian air, sea and underground resources by every littoral state. The problems existing among the littoral states on account of the absence of a governing regime have paved the way for the need to enact laws and rules for the just division of resources.\n\nSo, the imperative of enacting laws and rules in the light of human needs is being felt. For example, there had been no conventions, agreements and laws on the seas, air space, deserts and others until recently, because mankind was not in need of them yet. However, as a result of more interaction among people, groups, nations, and countries, the need for such laws was felt.\n\nSince law defines the extent of rights of every person and society, the Noble Qur\u2019an has specially mentioned the need of law in social life. It should be noted that existence if law in a general sense is not confined to the social life. In fact, if a person wants to lead a humane life and achieve excellence in it, he needs law.\n\nMoral laws are sufficient for personal life but social, national, international and political issues need laws to ensure justice between conflicting groups. For example, if a state takes more than its share of the Caspian, war and conflict will ensue, so the need to codify socio-political laws becomes clear. The collective need of law is thus axiomatic.\n\nEvery intelligent, sane person knows that in the absence of law, social life, human comfort, and human prosperity are endangered. In view of the instances we have mentioned, it is evident that natural law is not sufficient. We are in need of statutory laws because reason [\u2018aql] enjoins the observance of justice and fairness, but, to determine an approach that will guarantee justice and fairness we need another law.\n\nFor example, reason dictates that the Caspian natural resources should be justly divided among the littoral states. The question will then be raised: How should one \u2018justly divide\u2019 them? Does \u2018just division\u2019 mean that a country with the largest area, littoral area, or most littoral residents along the Caspian have the lion\u2019s share? The reply to such questions should be given by a legal reference authority. In most cases, the existence of a legislator is necessary. Now, let us see who should be the legislator.\n\n2. Laws possessing divine and religious source\n\nThe claim of Islam is that God has enacted laws and revealed them to the Prophet (s). So, after accepting the first principle which is the need for law, the second principle is to accept religion as the source of legislation. At this stage, there might be people in a Muslim country who do not accept Islam. In the same manner, there might be a person in a non-Muslim country who accepts the same.\n\nA person who doubts the existence of God also does not accept His religion and law. In the first stage, it can not be proved for him that the law should be enacted by God and basically for a person who denies God, the idea that \u201cThe law should be divine\u201d is unacceptable. We have to first prove the existence of God through scholastic and philosophical arguments and then the existence of the Prophet (\u2018a) and true religion theologically. Finally, we need to prove that a law which God directly or indirectly enacts becomes binding on the believer.\n\nWe have stated earlier that a person might believe in God and the essence of religion and apostleship [nabuwwah], but might not accept that social law has to be enacted by God. According to him, man has to engage in supplication, worship and litany with God and go to the mosque or any house of worship, but his social life has nothing to do with God for which He must himself enact a law. Such a belief is unacceptable in I... (truncated)",

        "text":"Daniel 9:24-27, By Amber Brooke\n\nDanielIn this chapter, it is one of the few scriptures in the bible that gives an actual time frame in the prophecy. In this Daniel is looking at the prophecy of Jeremiah, who said that Israel would be in bondage to the Babylonians for 70 years, which at this point are almost over. Daniel is praying and confessing the sin of the people, who have become very comfortable being in bondage to the Babylonians, and are not ready to be freed. The Angel Gabriel comes to shed light what is going to happen to the Jews, which is who the prophecy is about.\n\nDaniel 9:24 says, \u201cSeventy \u2018sevens\u2019 are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place\u201d \u201cSeventy sevens, which is most likely referring to weeks in the sense of years, even though there are some scholars who do believe that this could be an infinite amount of time. I believe that it is in years, so to look at it as 490 years, are set for the Jews to bring righteousness to the Holy City. This time frame will be broken up, it does not all happen at once. So 490 years has been set aside for \u201cyour people and your holy city\u201d, the people that this is referring to is the Jews, and the holy city is Jerusalem, although there are some scholars that believe that the people that they are referring to are \u201cspiritual Israel\u201d and the holy city is heavenly Jerusalem, but this is not supported. By referring to the Jewish people it is an answer to Daniels prayer directly.\n\nMoving on, it then says to finish transgression, wish could be taken to mean either \u201cto complete, at an end, finished, accomplished, spent\u201d (Miller, pg. 259) or \u201cshut up, restrain, withhold\u201d (Miller, pg.259). Either of this would work, but it is looking at the next phrase that gives us a better understanding that it is probably referring to \u201cto finish\u201d. The transgressions that they are talking about is mans sin against God, this did not end with the crucifixion of Christ, it will not end until the return of Christ. Putting an end to sin, and then to atone for wickedness. Putting an end to sin is just that, the end of sin. Atoning for the wicked is those that are guilty of a crime and to wipe that out.\n\nThe \u201ceverlasting righteousness\u201d is the end of the 490 years, this is when all is set right and Christ has come back. This is the eternal reign. The \u201csealing up vision and prophecy\u201d is that every true, God-ordained prophecy, will be complete. There will not be any that have not been fulfilled at this point. There will be no more prophecy after this because Christ will be revealed, and there is not a need for it anymore. To \u201canoint the Most Holy\u201d is referring to making the holy city, Jerusalem, the city that it is intended to be. Not in the ruin that is was then, or the divided city it is now.\u00a0 This could also be taken as a literal reference, as a future temple that will be built, as described in Ezekiel.\n\nIn review, Daniel 9:24 is a timeframe of what is to come, and what must happen before the return of Christ. An exact amount of years is given, which a rare thing to find in the bible, as well as a list of rebellion ending, sin stopping, crime ending, completing of all God-given prophecies, and the anointing of the Holy City.\n\nDaniel 9:25 tells us \u201cKnow and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven \u2018sevens,\u2019 and sixty-two \u2018sevens.\u2019 It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench but in times of trouble. The start of this verse tells us that it is important; by saying \u201cknow and understand\u201d Gabriel is telling Daniel to pay attention.\n\nThe first two sections of the seventy sevens will end with the coming of Christ. Out of the three decrees, the decree of Cyrus, the decree of Artaxerxes to Ezera, and the decree Artaxerxes issues to Nehemiah, only the last one actually specifically refers to the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Although there are scholars for each of the decree who believe that is the correct one, and it is not too far of a stretch to assume that the other two would allow for the Jews to return to Jerusalem.\n\nThe decree to rebuild the city, which was in ruins at this time, \u201cwith streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.\u201d This is not talking about building a trench, as in a moat, because it would not make sense to build something like that around Jerusalem, but what it was probably talking about was a, \u201ctrench cut into the rock outside the city walls in order to increase the exterior height of the wall\u201d (Miller, pg. 267). The term, \u201cbut in times of trouble\u201d most have taken to believe as the struggles that were had under Nehemiah\u2019s government when Jerusalem was being rebuilt.\n\nNext, we have Daniel 9:26, \u201cAfter the sixty-two \u2018sevens,\u2019 the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.\u201d This is after Jerusalem has been reconstructed in the first 49 years, and then there was the passing of the 434 years passed, a few major events would take place.\n\nJesus has come, as we saw in Daniel 9:25, but now He is \u201ccut off\u201d, that we can take literally, and we all know to be true, the anointed one was crucified. When it refers to having nothing, I personally take that from the people\u2019s perspective, in that everything that Jesus had done in his years on earth were for nothing. He is now dead and has been turned away by his disciples. The next part of this verse is extremely important, Daniel is being told that the city is going to be destroyed again, not by the Babylonians, but by the Romans, and this tells us that they are the people of the ruler who will come in the seventieth seven, as the antichrist. So, here we are told clearly that the antichrist has the European-Roman tie.\n\n\u201cThe end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.\u201d The flood does not mean a literal flood with water, but a flood of destruction that swept over Jerusalem. Two of the major views that I have found on this are if the end is referring to when the Romans destroy the city in A.D. 70 or the destruction that will take place in the end times. War has been spoken until the end, which could make sense in both views, there was obviously was when the city was destroyed, as well as we know there will be war in the final times.\n\n\u201cHe will confirm a covenant with many for one \u2018seven.\u2019 In the middle of the \u2018seven,whom\u2019 he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him\u201d Daniel 9:27, the final seven years are left for the future, this is where the gap between the sixty-ninth year stops, and then the coming of Christ, which is know as one of the most momentous events, at the end of the final seven.\n\nHe will confirm a covenant with many for one \u2018seven.\u2019 This is referring to the Antichriwhois making an agreement with, and this is where there is some differences of opinions. Some think that this is the unbelieving Jews, while others think that it is with the true believers, but it is most likely with the Jewish people as a whole, as the Israel nation. What this treaty is, we do not know, but a good guess would be that it includes protection, along with other stipulations, with the way the world is going right now, it is not hard to imagine that this is too far fetched of an idea. This will supposed to be for seven years, but half way through the agreement. This is when the persecution of believes will become even more intense, he will demand that worship of God is stopped, and eventually that the citizens will give their alliance to him before God.\n\nThe temple will be changed into something that will cause offense to Jews, but this is not going to last forever, the prophecy will ring true and the Antichrist, along with his followers will be judged harshly, while the Messiah will come back as promised.\n\nThese verses spell out what will happen, Christ will come, He will die, the Holy City will be destroyed, a ruler will come, cause mass destruction and sin, but the true king will come back as promised. The kingdom of God will reign forever.\n\n\n\nFord, D. (2007). In the heart of daniel: An exposition of daniel 9:24-27.

        "text":"Lewis Christianity Creation Evil and\u00a0Term Paper\n\nExcerpt from Term Paper :\n\nMcGrath's comments above suggest periods of conceptual adjustment as observers of the Christian faith worked to make explanations for the presence, even the commonality, of sin as it exists in spite of God's innate goodness.\n\nSo again, to the idea that Christianity's incredible facets couldn't rationally be reached by outsiders to the faith with some guesswork does not hold up against the process by which we know Christianity came to be. McGrath points out that in this discussion on how best to reconcile sin with God's innate goodness, Christianity was in a place of coming into its own identity. Answering questions such as this quandary on the dualism of good and evil would be very much a part of 'guessing' the structure of Christian faith as it were, but directly within the framework allowed by the basic tenets relating to God, man and the universe.\n\nThe text by Lewis demonstrates this way of thinking by supplying a reason for man's sinfulness that is explained through a theological lens. For Lewis, the presence of a certainty with regard to the presence of God means that any discussion geared toward the reconciliation of human sinfullness also quite naturally predispose us toward some understanding of this in contradiction to the goodness of God. So for Lewis, the will toward sinfulness that is demonstrated in the universe is not unlike the will for insubordination demonstrated by human beings with free will to their human superiors. Accordingly, Lewis remarks, \"the same thing arises in any regiment, or trade union, or school. You make a thing voluntary and then half the people do not do it. That is not what you willed, but your will has made it possible. It is probably the same in the universe. God created things which had free will. That means creatures which can go either right or wrong. Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong; I cannot.\" (p. 131)\n\nIn addition to arguing that the presence of human sinfulness fits within the construct of a universe created by a good god, the text by Lewis concedes once again to a shortcoming where imagination is concerned. Perhaps this should be unsurprising for an author who would create works of enduring fiction which were highly derivative of Christian scriptures. For one whose process of creation occurred thusly, a certain admission to being unable to imagine the very concepts that predicate Christianity does not reveal much about the way that an outsider might guess or imagine. The consequence of Lewis' faith is an inability to imagine a universe in which this exact form of faith did not yet exist. However, because we as scholars studying human history do know this fact, we are hard-pressed to accept Lewis' ignorance to these things as a strong enough reason to blindly accept the certainty of Christianity. Our acceptance to this notion must begin first with a belief in the inherent truth of certain rules and must proceed to knowledge of therefore established facts.\n\nJesus Christ:\n\nThe same is true of Christian's origins, which center largely on the events relating to the birth, death and rebirth of Jesus Christ. Again, as we attempt to consider this narrative from the perspective that this is something which must be true because it could not have been imagined, we evaluate the claims relating to the history of Jesus as being deeply couched in pre-existent religious tradition and, consequently, we evaluate many of the myths surrounding Jesus as fitting into already established ideas about the omnipotence of God and the inherency of human sinfulness as discussed above. And certainly, the perceived connection between the martyrdom of Jesus and the occurrence of Original Sin in the Garden of Eden would help to fit Jesus into a narrative framework ordained by a just God. As the text by McGrath points out, \"just as Israel knew God first as Redeemer and then as Creator, so did the early church first know Jesus as Lord and Savior, and then begin thinking about what this meant in Christological terms. Thus, in the order of Christian experience, the 'work' of Christ precedes all debates about his 'person.'\" (p. 122)\n\nIn this regard, we can see that Christian ideology has preemptively removed the possibility of speculation, guessing and even historical inquisition where Jesus is concerned simply by elevating matters of his presumed divinity above biographical facts such as those relating to his practice of the Jewish faith. By considering this orientation, one might ultimately be able to prove and demonstrate that, in fact, Jesus was a person who lived according to the rules of Judaism and, in doing so, delivered to his followers a faith that was inherently formed by the forces which preceded it. In order for one to accept the statement provided above by McGrath, one would have to enter into the discussion with unempirical acceptance of certain ideas.\n\nTo this end, we consider the article by Polkinghorne, which demonstrates this very same circular approach to the relationship between Christianity and the scientific community. . For Polkinghorne, science and religion are not exclusive from one another. Quite to the contrary, this article contends that the two forces are actually deeply interdependent. On this point, Polkinghorne states that \"here we are concerned, not with metaquestions about the patterns and structure of the physical world, but with metaquestions about how historical process is to be understood. This shift of attention corresponds to a transition from natural theology to a theology of nature. We are not now looking to the physical word for hints of God's existence but to God's existence as an aid for understanding why things have developed in the physical world in the manner that they have.\" (p. 118) The article by Polkinghorne suggests that it is actually possible to reconcile the relationship between faith and science by recognizing that faith has a role in the scientific process. Much like McGrath's assertion regarding Christianity and Jesus here above, in the author's view stated here above, if one is to begin scientific propositions initiating from the idea that God does exist, one may be able to 'prove' a host of claims regarding the certainty of creation claims or ideas about evolution. In other words, by promoting a process of scientific inquiry that starts with the acceptance of God, one does become capable of 'guessing' the constructs that define Christian beliefs. In other words, here especially, it is possible to see the fundamental flaw in the thinking by Lewis. As a rationally thinking outsider, one could plausibly arrive at many of the conclusions that are fundamental tenets of the Christian faith simply by beginning with the propositions of Godly design and human stewardship as denoted by the story of creation. So for Lewis to suppose that we might be unable to guess the things from which Christianity is derived shows a lack of imagination on the part of the author and a desire to dovetail the whole of his observations on the world, universe and man into a simple framework that begins and ends with an all-powerful and unseen creator.\n\n\nFor the rational outsider such as myself, it is actually quite easy to imagine a point in the history of mankind in which it was seen as necessary to construct as yet unreached conclusions about the relationship between man and the universe such as might have related to the contrast between God's goodness and human sinfulness or to the explanation's for the emergence of Jesus Christ. Moreover, I find it plausible that the evolution of man's understanding of this relationship must have surely involved the demand to fit explanations into certainly culturally or politically accepted molds of power distribution. Therefore, resources such as those examined here and especially that provided by Lewis, contrary to the ambitions of their authors, do far more to reveal the sociological and human vestiges of invention in the Christian faith than they do prove that God exists with a certainty not to be debated, questioned, studied or doubted.\n\n\nLewis, C.S., Mere Christianity.

Jesus having taught with all authority and persuasive\u00adness that His word should not be over\u00adcome; so that we may rightly regard as oracular responses28162816\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u1f7b\u03c2. those utterances of His, such as, \u201cYe shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them and the Gen\u00adtiles;\u201d28172817\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Matt. x. 18. and, \u201cMany shall say unto Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten in Thy name, and drunk in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils?\u00a0 And I shall 351say unto them, Depart from Me, ye work\u00aders of iniquity, I never knew you.\u201d28182818\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cf. Matt. vii. 22, 23.\u00a0 Now it was perhaps (once) probable that, in uttering these words, He spoke them in vain, so that they were not true; but when that which was delivered with so much authority has come to pass, it shows that God, having really become man, delivered to men the doctrines of salvation.28192819\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u1f75\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f79\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1.\n\n3.\u00a0 And what need is there to mention also that it was predicted of Christ28202820\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b5\u03c6\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u1f7b\u03b8\u03b7 \u1f41 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f79\u03c2. that then would the rulers fail from Judah, and the leaders from his thighs,28212821\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd. when He came for whom it is reserved (the king\u00addom, namely); and that the expectation of the Gentiles should dwell in the land?28222822\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u1f75\u03c3\u1fc3.\u00a0 For it is clearly manifest from the history, and from what is seen at the present day, that from the times of Jesus there were no longer any who were called kings of the Jews;28232823\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u03bf\u1f54\u03ba \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1fbd\u0399\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1f77\u03b1\u03bd \u1f10\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u1f71\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd. all those Jewish institutions on which they prided themselves\u2014I mean those arrangements relating to the temple and the altar, and the offering of the ser\u00advice, and the robes of the high priest \u00adhaving been destroyed.\u00a0 For the prophecy was fulfilled which said, \u201cThe children of Israel shall sit many days, there being no king, nor ruler, nor sacrifice, nor altar, nor priesthood, nor responses.\u201d28242824\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cf. Hos. iii. 4.\u00a0 Quoted from the Septuagint.\u00a0 And these predictions we employ to answer those who, in their perplexity as to the words spoken in Genesis by Jacob to Judah, as\u00adsert that the Ethnarch,28252825\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Termed by Rufinus \u201cPatriarch.\u201d being of the race of Judah, is the ruler of the people, and that there will not fail some of his seed, until the advent of that Christ whom they figure to their imagination.\u00a0 But if \u201cthe children of Israel are to sit many days without a king, or ruler, or altar, or priest\u00adhood, or responses;\u201d and if, since the temple was destroyed, there exists no longer sacrifice, nor altar, nor priesthood, it is manifest that the ruler has failed out of Judah, and the leader from between his thighs.\u00a0 And since the prediction declares that \u201cthe ruler shall not fail from Judah, and the leader from between his thighs, until what is reserved for Him shall come,\u201d it is manifest that He is come to whom (belongs) what is reserved\u2014the expecta\u00adtion of the Gentiles.\u00a0 And this is clear from the multitude of the heathen who have believed on God through Jesus Christ.\n\n3524.\u00a0 And in the song in Deuteronomy,28262826\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deut. xxxii. also, it is prophetically made known that, on account of the sins of the former peo\u00adple, there was to be an election of foolish nations, which has been brought to pass by no other than by Jesus.\u00a0 \u201cFor they,\u201d He says, \u201cmoved Me to jealousy with that which is not God, they have provoked Me to anger with their idols; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people, and will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.\u201d28272827\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deut. xxxii. 21.\u00a0 Now it is possi\u00adble to understand with all clearness how the Hebrews, who are said to have moved God to jealousy by that which is not God, and to have provoked Him to anger by their idols, were (themselves) aroused to jealousy by that which was not a people\u2014the foolish nation, namely, which God chose by the advent of Jesus Christ and His disciples.\u00a0 We see, indeed, \u201cour call\u00ading, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble (are called); but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and base things, and things that are de\u00adspised, hath God chosen, and things that are not, to bring to nought the things which formerly existed;\u201d28282828\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cf. 1 Cor. i. 26\u201328. and let not the Israel according to the flesh, which is called by the apostle \u201cflesh,\u201d boast in the presence of God.\n\n5.\u00a0 And what are we to say regarding the prophecies of Christ in the Psalms, there being a certain ode with the superscription \u201cFor the Beloved,\u201d28292829\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ps. xlv. 1, 2. whose\u201d tongue\u201d is said to be the \u201cpen of a ready writer, who is fairer than the sons of men,\u201d since \u201cgrace was poured on His lips?\u201d\u00a0 For a proof that grace was poured on His lips is this, that although the period of His teach\u00ading was short\u2014for He taught somewhere about a year and a few months\u2014the world has been filled with his teaching, and with the worship of God (established) through Him.\u00a0 For there arose \u201cin His days right\u00adeousness and abundance of peace,\u201d28302830\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cf.

        "text":"Today is December 16, 2018 -\n\nLekh Lekha 5774\n\nHaftarah Parshat Lekh Lekha\n(Isaiah 40:27-41:16)\nOctober 12, 2013\n8 Heshvan 5774\n\nThis week\u2019s haftarah was likely selected to accompany Parshat Lech Lecha on account of the midrashic association of Abraham with the verse: \u201cWho has roused a victor from the east, summoned him to service?\u201d (41:2) While Isaiah most likely intended this verse to refer to Cyrus, the Persian king who overcame the Babylonians and freed Judea from subjugation, still, other elements of its message resonate with Abraham\u2019s image as the founder of the great monotheistic tradition. If Abraham is acclaimed by the Jewish tradition as the great \u201ciconoclast\u201d who liberated God from enslavement to the natural realm, it was Isaiah\u2019s message which removed God from temporal restraints: \u201cHe who announced the generations (korei hadorot) from the start \u2013 I, the Lord, who was the first and will be the last as well.\u201d (41:4) (See Professor Yochanan Muffs, The Personhood of God, p. 13)\n\nWhat is implied in the words: \u201cHe who announced the generations from the start\u201d? According to Professor Shalom Paul, this verse informs us that God makes known in advance what will happen. He sets forth the periods of time and the events in every generation as He does here by announcing the emergence of Cyrus as king. (Isaiah 40-66, Mikra L\u2019Yisrael, pp. 116-7) In the words of Rabbi Joseph Kara (13th France): \u201cHe called forth Cyrus before he was born, well before the future when he would come into existence; even before the king of Babylonia arose and who would in the future destroy the Temple. It is he who I called \u2019Cyrus, My shepherd\u2019 who will fulfill all that I desire.\u201d For this particular worldview, God is freed from the constraints of time and events because He has predetermined their outcome.\n\nIn the Mishnah, Rabbi Akiva applies this verse to those things about human existence which seem predetermined: \u201cHe (Rabbi Akiva) used to say: The father transmits to the son physical attractiveness and strength and wealth and wisdom and years and the number of generations before the end (of time) for it is said: \u2018He announced the generations from the start.\u2019 (excerpted from Eduyot 2:9)\n\nBoth Isaiah\u2019s prophecy and Rabbi Akiva\u2019s interpretation rescue God from the constraints of time since both presented God as the author of the world\u2019s events both large and small. This viewpoint, though, creates another theological problem. What about free will? Rabbi Akiva captures this anomaly in a seemingly self-contradictory Mishnah: \u201cEverything is foreseen and freewill is given\u201d (Avot 3:15) This philosophical dialectic is not easily resolvable. It is a religious dynamic which is basic to our lives and goes to show that from our perspective, not all questions have simple answers.\n\nAbout This Commentary\n\nThis study piece is offered as a service of the United Synagogue Conservative Yeshiva.

After dealing with the concept of Christian dualism and its historical development, the essay pays attention to the sovereignty of Catholic Church and highlights how in last years the CEI (Italian Conference of Catholic Bishops) - in conjunction with the Holy See - has taken on particular importance in the relationship between State and Catholic Church. Then there is a comparison between two issues which have had unexpected results: the Eight per thousand and the marriage. With regard to the Eight per thousand, in consideration of the economic crisis, the Author proposes that Catholic Church may accept a temporary reduction of the sums devolved to her or may use such sums in order to strengthen the projects in favor of the common good. With regard to the marriage, in consideration of the violation of religious marriage freedom, the Author hopes for a clarification by the State or, otherwise, the adoption of the personal statutes .\n\nDownload in PDF format",

Calvin holds indeed that in that age of his, God raised up Evangelists to rescue the Church from Popery Instit lib. 4. cap. 3. \u00a7 4. and Mr. Hooker in his Ecclesiastical policy, lib. 5. Sect: 78. tells us out of Eusebius eccles: hist: lib. 3. cap: 34. that in Trajan\u2019s days many of the Apostles Disciples and Scholars who were then alive, sold their possessions, which they gave to the poor, and betaking themselves to travel, undertook the labour of Evangelists, that is, they painfully preached Christ, and delivered to them who as yet never heard the doctrine of Faith. Concerning Prophets, I have before shewed out of Justin Martyr dial: cum Tryph: Iud. That in his days there were still some in the Church, who had an extraordinary gift of prophesy, and such there have been also in other places, and at other times. Of which there might be diverse instances given, I shall here speak somewhat, first of the work of Prophets and Evangelists.\n\nTheir Work and Administration, I conceive to be partly ordinary, partly extraordinary. Ordinary, because the higher degrees. Eph. 4. 11. are comprehensive of the lower, not contrariwise, a Pastor doth the work of a Teacher, an Evangelist doth the work of a Pastor and Teacher, a Prophet doth the work of an Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher, an Apostle the work of all those, which I have also before touched, following Chrysostom, and Mr. Bayne. Prophets and Evangelists edify the Church by preaching as well as ordinary Pastors, 1 Cor. 14. 3. Eph. 4. 11. 12. 2 Tim. 4. 2. 5. From which Scriptures and others of that sort, as Tit. 1. 5. 1 Tim. 3. 15. Some have collected that Evangelists had a fixed charge in some certain Church, which they attended and took the oversight thereof for the work of the Ministry as often, and as long as other pressing and public occasions of the Church could permit. See Zepperus de polit: eccl: lib: 2. cap: 1. Aret: probl: Theol: loc: 62.\n\nI say again the work of Prophets and Evangelists was extraordinary, for the distinguishing or characteristical property of a Prophet, i.e., the outmost he could do, which the ordinary officers could not do, nor any other, but an Apostle, is the opening of great secrets or foreshowing things to come, by the special and extraordinary inspiration of the holy Ghost. Their very name intimateth so much for \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 and \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9 come from \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 I foretell. According to which sense of the word, all these were called Prophets of old, who foretold things to come, as Magicians, Astrologians, Prognosticators, Nativity or figure-casters, &c. See Olivarius de Prophetia pag: 9. 10. The Priests and Interpreters of the Oracles were also called Prophets, and the Apostle Tit: 1. 12. calls Epimenides a Prophet of the Cretians, qui quasi praesenserit futura, saith Erasmus. As likewise saith he, because that book of Epimenides out of which that verse is cited hath its title \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd de oraculis. But in the Church notion of the word which the Fathers took from Scripture: Prophecy is a prediction of things to come from a special inspiration of the holy Ghost.\n\nBut what is the distinguishing work and characteristical property of an Evangelist, i.e., that which an ordinary Pastor and Teacher might not do, and which none else could do but an Apostle or a Prophet? That I may speak to this more clearly, \u2018tis to be remembered, that the word Evangelist is not here taken in that restricted vulgar sense, for a pen-man of the holy Ghost writing Gospel; for in that sense there were but four Evangelists, and two of them Apostles. But this is not the Scripture notion of the word, which tells us that Philip and Timothy were Evangelists, Act. 21. 8. 2 Tim. 4. 5. And that Christ hath given Evangelists to his Church for the work of the Ministry. Eph. 4. 11, 12. Now if we take the word as the Scripture doth, the proper work of an Evangelist i.e., that which none but an Evangelist as an Evangelist, or he who was more than an Evangelist could do, I conceive to stand in two things: the first is, to lay foundations of Churches, and to preach Christ to an unbelieving people, who have not yet received the Gospel, or at least who have not the true Doctrine of Christ among them. So Philip the Evangelist preached Christ to the city of Samaria, and baptized them before any of the Apostles came unto them. Act. 8. 5. 12. And if the 70 Disciples Luke 10 were Evangelists (as many think, and Calvin Instit: lib: 4. cap: 3. 4. thinks it probable) their proper work as Evangelists, was to preach the Gospel to those cities which had not received it. Their second work is a traveling and negotiating as Messengers and Agents upon extraordinary occasions, and special emergencies which is oft times between one Church and another, and so distinct from the first which is a traveling among them that are yet without. Of this second there are diverse examples in Scripture, as 2 Cor. 8. 23. Phil: 2. 19. 25. 2 Tim: 4. 9. Tit: 3 12 Act: 15 22 25. In this last example, although some are of opinion that Silas was of Jerusalem, and had an ordinary Ministerial function there, yet the best writers do commonly reckon Silas among the Evangelists, and I do not doubt but as he was a Prophet, Act. 15. 32. so also an Evangelist, which may appear by his traveling through many places, in the work of preaching the Gospel, sometimes with Paul, as his fellow labourer and helper: Act 16 19 &c. 17. 4. 10. sometimes with Timothy, Act: 17. 14. 15. & 18 15.\n\nNow when I call these works and administrations of Prophets and Evangelists extraordinary, my meaning is not, that they are altogether and every way extraordinary even as Apostleship. For I dare not say that since the days of the Apostles there hath never been, or that to the end of the world there shall never be any raised up by God with such gifts, and for such administrations, as I have now described to be proper to Prophets and Evangelists, i.e: the fore telling of things to come, the traveling among Unbelievers to convert them by the preaching of the Gospel, and between one Church and another, upon extraordinary errands. But I call the work of Prophets and Evangelists extraordinary in Calvin\u2019s sense (expressed by him in the place before cited) i.e., it is not ordinary like that of Pastors and Teachers, which hath place constantly in the best constituted and settled Churches. Shortly, I take the word Extraordinary here, not for that which ceased with the first age of the Christian Church, but for that which is not, neither needeth to be ordinary. And so much of their work:\n\nAs for the vocation of Prophets and Evangelists, 1. I cannot pass without an animadversion, a passage in Mr. Hookers Ecclesiastical policy. lib: 5 sect: 78. where he will not have the Prophets mentioned, 1 Cor. 12 28. to be reckoned with those whom he calleth (after the then common idiome) the Clergy, because no man\u2019s gifts or qualities can make him a Minister of holy things, unless Ordination do give him power; and we nowhere find Prophets to have been made by Ordination. If we shall take the word Prophets so largely as to comprehend all who have any gift of Prophesy, and so Prophetesses also, I shall not contend against that which he saith, but if we shall understand that the Apostle in that place doth enumerate not only diversities of Gifts, but diversities of Administrations, which God hath appointed in the Church (and this may easily appear by comparing v. 28. with v. 4. 5.) and so take prophesy for an Administration or Service in the Church as well as a Gift; surely it was not without a Mission or Vocation thereunto. For as they were extraordinary Ministers, so they had an extraordinary Mission or Ordination as well as the Apostles, Luke 11. 49. Christ saith, I will send them Prophets and Apostles, and 1 Cor: 12 28. God hath set or appointed Prophets in the Church. Yea as their work was partly ordinary and common to Pastors and Teachers, so a Prophet was examined and allowed by an Assembly of Prophets, as well as an Elder by an Assembly of Elders, which I gather from 1 Cor: 14 32. And the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets.\n\nTouching the Vocation of an Evangelist, the Author of the Queries concerning Ordination, quest. 19. to elude our argument for the standing ordinance of Christ, for Ordination of Ministers drawn from 1 Tim. 4. 14. answereth among other things, that Timothy being an Evangelist, and Evangelists being (by common consent) extraordinary by Calling, he had no need to pass through the common door of Ordination. The extraordinariness of Evangelists is not so much without controversy, as he would bear his reader in hand, as may appear by what I have but now said: Neither can he prove that at that time, when the Presbytery laid hands on Timothy, he was even then an Evangelist or more than a Presbyter. However, this I will say, that as the work, so also the Vocation of Evangelis... (truncated)",

        "text":"Reviews of\n\nExperientia, Volume 2: Linking Text and\u00a0Experience\n\nIn Colleen SHANTZ, Rebecca Dean, Rodney A. WERLINE, Society of Biblical Literature on March 11, 2015 at 9:43 pm\n\n\n2015.03.07 | Colleen Shantz and Rodney A. Werline, eds.\u00a0Experientia, Volume 2: Linking Text and Experience. Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2012.\n\nReviewed by Rebecca Dean,\u00a0Pembroke College, Oxford.\n\nMany thanks to SBL Press for providing a review copy.\n\nThis book forms the second volume of collected essays on the subject of religious experience within early Judaism and early Christianity to emerge from the work of the Society of Biblical Literature group of the same name. The earlier volume, subtitled\u00a0Inquiry Into Religious Experience in Early Judaism and Christianity, represents the first collective attempt to explore religious experience within the field of biblical studies, and as such much of its focus is upon establishing the parameters of the category, and exploring potential avenues for accessing and analysing relevant material in ancient texts. The second volume, subtitled\u00a0Linking Text and Experience, is intended to build upon these foundations, with particular attention being paid to new possibilities for research within the field.\n\nIn the first chapter Colleen Shantz provides a commentary on what has all too often been absent in biblical scholarship throughout the last century. She offers an explanation for the lack of engagement with the subject of religious experience and ascribes this absence to factors such as embarrassment over the ecstatic excesses of early Christianity and Judaism, discomfort at the historical misappropriation of the term, the increasing dominance of cultural explanations and the associated tendency to reduce claims to religious experience to\u00a0nothing more\u2019\u00a0than culturally constructed language, and finally, the simple difficulty one finds in defining both\u00a0religious\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0experience. Shantz situates the contributions of the subsequent chapters plainly within this context, thus enabling those who are new to the field to quickly grasp its contours and idiosyncrasies.\n\nRodney A. Werline\u2019s contribution focuses on theodicy within the Psalms of Solomon. He argues that the issue of suffering can neither be expressed nor resolved through the medium of theological argument alone, and emphasises instead the place of embodied experience within the outworking of this theme. This is expressed through two key trajectories within the chapter. The first is the re-framing of human suffering as the remembered discipline of teacher-student relationships within scribal education, with God as teacher and the scribes in the already familiar role of students. The second takes into account the performative nature of the Psalms, interpreting their physical enactment as a means of creating a feeling of oneness with self, community and cosmos that may offer some antidote to the problem of suffering.\n\nIn the third chapter Frances Flannery delineates the dual function of 4 Ezra as both an exoteric story of the consolation of desolation and an esoteric account of mystical experience. She uses theories of social memory and cognitive dissonance to explore the characterisation and transformation of Ezra, demonstrating convincingly the vital role of each of the seven episodes as instances of increasing revelation. Flannery elucidates not only the importance of the experiential dimension in the formulation of a full understanding of the book, but also its potential function as an esoteric, encoded account of mystical experience.\n\nIn the fourth chapter Istv\u00e1n Czachesz re-examines Paul\u2019s treatment of religious experience in Corinth using insights from contemporary neuro-imaging research. He connects findings from these studies to the social dynamics of the religious community at Corinth. Of particular significance to his research is the recognition of two forms of religious experience: volitional, characterised in practice by intellectual reflection and focused attention, and resonant, which tends to prioritise activities such as music and movement. Czachesz suggests that Pauls aim is to encourage a shift away from resonant to volitional experience. He argues that it is this difference in religiosity that is key to the understanding of the Corinthian correspondence, as opposed to the more typical emphasis upon socio-economic division.\n\nJohn R. Levison offers a detailed analysis of the Testament of Eve within the Greek Life of Adam and Eve. This Testament subtly subverts the prevalent ideology of Eve by her representation as a figure who, in contrast to Adam and the servant, was not easily deceived, and was not entirely to blame for the Fall. In this chapter Levison makes a compelling case that as well as offering an insight into the experiences of women within antiquity, the Testament of Eve can be interpreted as a lesson in flawed religious experience.\n\nIn chapter six Leif E. Vaage treats the theme of violence as religious experience within the Gospel of Mark. While he admits his reticence about the use of religious experience as a term due to the inherent difficulties of defining it adequately, he uses it as a vague category in order to analyse enacted violence within the Gospel, particularly that embodied within the Markan figure of Jesus. Vaage interprets the Gospel as a text of trauma in which the violent but ultimately defeated Jesus represents the unresolved ambivalence of a community that has survived the Jewish War (though not unscathed) to face a radically altered future.\n\nRobin Griffith-Jones\u2019\u00a0contribution to the volume concerns a re-examination of the text of Romans as a therapeutic text, offering its divided readership the means of re-definition of both self and church. It is suggested that\u00a0Paul\u2019s letter\u00a0portrays both of the imagined factions of libertines and legalists, representing aspects of both within the characterisation of the\u00a0\u2018I\u2019\u00a0figure within the Epistle, a literary strategy that underscores the interdependence of both factions. For Griffith-Jones, the act of engagement with this letter itself offers the means for healing: introspection and imagination are key features of this envisioned transformation.\n\nIn chapter eight Rollin A. Ramsaran turns his attention to religious experience within the epistle to the Galatians. He examines the participatory language within the epistle, suggesting that the\u00a0\u2018in Christ\u2019\u00a0language points to social religious experience, while the\u00a0\u2018Christ in\u2019\u00a0language may refer to experiences of divine interiority. In both cases, Ramsaran emphasises Pauls expectation that these experiences would be shared by the Galatian Christians.\n\nIn chapter nine Bert Jan Lietaert Peerbolte addresses the experiential setting of the writings of Paul using insights from the field of ritual studies. He offers an assessment of Pauls likely background in Jewish apocalyptic belief, and examines the textual evidence for Christian initiation rites, with a particular focus on the text of 1 Cor. 2:1-8 and the nature of the relationship between Pauls writings and the mystery cults. Peerbolte aims to demonstrate the significance of Christian baptismal practices, and the shared experience that reference to them invoked among the communities to whom Paul was writing.\n\nIn chapter ten, Carol A. Newsom focuses attention on religious experience in the Dead Sea Scrolls, offering two detailed case studies from the Hodayot and the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, texts that are likely to in some way have served a performative function within their community context. Newsom outlines the function of these texts as attempts to induce religious experience and to guide self-understanding.\n\nIn the final chapter, Angela Kim Harkins examines religious experience in two texts, Nehemiah 9 and Ephrems Hymns on Paradise, in the light of critical spatial theory. Harkins focuses on the idea of lived experience, exploring the function of these texts not simply in\u00a0describing the experiences of others, but also in\u00a0eliciting such experiences among those readers who seek to re-enact the text.\n\nInevitably, when assessing a work of this size, one ends up being more descriptive than analytical. However, this description in itself serves to demonstrate the breadth in both subject matter and approach that are to be found within the book. There is no doubt that these chapters succeed in their stated aim of building upon previous contributions to the field, and there is a welcome move forwards from the necessary work of the first volume in considering how religious experience ought to be defined and approached.\n\nThis book highlights a multitude of potentially fruitful avenues for further study, with the contributions of Levison and Griffith-Jones offering particularly promising models of inquiry. However, given the diversity that is contained within the present volume, it would have benefited from a conclusion as well as an introduction, with sufficient attention being paid to the articulation of a future vision for research within this field. Careful work has been undertaken in both volumes to gather together the disparate strands of inquiry into religious experience over the past century, but there is a risk that a continuing lack of cohesiveness could unravel some of this work. In the absence of a considered rationale for future inquiry it will be difficult to hold together the strands of such a complex category, thus perpetuating the fragmented approach that has characterised much of the work\u00a0to date.\n\nRebecca Dean\nPembroke College,\u00a0Oxford\n\u00a0[ at ]\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

ISSN 2074-7705.\n\nRecent decades have witnessed both a shift in sexual standards, and the loss of the Biblical authority which has traditionally motivated them. This has been the case even with Christians. It is therefore necessary to suggest a new motive for morality, especially in this area. A possibility is the idea of the imitation of Christ, adopting the principles on which he acted, which can be summed up as ken\u00f5sis, or self-limitation. Jesus was fundamentally limited through being incarnate; human beings are likewise limited, also with regard to their sexuality. Jesus adopted the practice of self-limitation, seen in his humility; Christians, in imitation of him, likewise should practise self-limitation. Indeed, the manifestation and practice of sexuality is fundamentally limited in any case by its very nature. If the principle of ken\u00f5sis is applied in the areas of marriage and divorce, and in related issues such as homosexuality or chastity, it serves to underpin what is a traditional set of practices in a way consistent with a Christian world-view.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7 text in English \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00b7 English ( pdf )\n\n\nCreative Commons License\u00a0All the contents of this journal, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License",

        "text":"Morny Joy: Gender and its Vicissitudes\n\n\n1 Leave a comment on paragraph 1 0 In the last fifty years, a revolution occurred that modified the accepted meaning and application of the word \u201cgender.\u201d Formerly, it had functioned simply as a term of grammatical attribution, indicating whether terms, usually nouns in non-English languages, were of a feminine, masculine, or neuter gender. Yet, more recently, the term \u201cgender\u201d has been involved in intense debates concerning its problematic relations with the notions of \u201csex\u201d and \u201csexuality.\u201d Most traditional religions have either attempted to avoid what they regard as the resultant highly politicized exchanges on this topic or have vigorously condemned such unwelcome developments.\n\n2 Leave a comment on paragraph 2 0 Certain secular feminist scholars, such as Judith Butler, Linda Nicholson, and Joan Wallach Scott, beginning in the 1990s, began to employ the term \u201cgender\u201d in ways that helped to dismantle the former meaning of the term. Their explorations in \u201cgender\u201d would play a crucial role in their own discursive analyses of both sex and sexuality. As a result, \u201cgender\u201d was employed as a powerful tool that helped to expose the inequities that have resulted from male dominance in the past and until the present era.\n\n3 Leave a comment on paragraph 3 0 Influenced by these secular women scholars, a number of feminists in religious studies, such as Darlene Juschka, have undertaken to employ the term, \u201cgender,\u201d in the discipline of the Study of Religion. Juschka appraises the forms of male domination and debasement of women, in addition to suggesting alternative perspectives. The theologian, Mary McClintock Fulkerson, has critically examined the role of compulsory heterosexuality in scripture. In response, she reinterpreted a biblical text, where she proposes a more inclusive reading of human sexual relations.\n\n4 Leave a comment on paragraph 4 0 These monumental shifts have occurred at the same time as the categories \u201csecular\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d have undergone intensive scrutiny of their own binary divisions. Certain advocates, e.g., Charles Taylor (2007) and J\u00fcrgen Habermas (2006, 1\u201325; 224\u201323), have endeavoured to find ways of introducing religion into the public sphere, while many secularists are strongly opposed to any move in this direction. Fundamentalists of various affiliations also support an agenda of a complete domination by religion in both public and private realms.\n\n5 Leave a comment on paragraph 5 0 At the heart of these disparate, though not completely mutually exclusive interactions, there is a power struggle that seeks not only to challenge heteronormative sexuality and gendered stereotypes but also to introduce more flexible modes of gender identification. Such a change would lead to the replacement of former monolithic and hierarchical institutions, be they religious or secular, that have closely monitored gender identity and sexual behaviour. In regards to religions, perhaps the greatest struggle is that of questioning the \u201ctruism\u201d that proclaims God\u2019s divine decree of heteronormativity with its inherent model of what is termed \u201ca gender binary.\u201d\n\n6 Leave a comment on paragraph 6 0 In this chapter, I will not be able to explore all the multiple variations and complexities of both the historical and contemporary developments that have informed the changing dynamics of gender. The main reason for this is, if I were to take into consideration all the variant positions, with their resultant responses and interrogations, they would require a book. In addition, each critical assessment, besides being both intriguing and challenging, needs to be examined in great detail. As a result, I have chosen to focus my article, using the framework of discursive analysis, on the different struggles involving gender, primarily in in the field of women\u2019s and gender studies, especially as they pertain to the Study of Religion.[1] My presentation, though basically chronological, presents what I term, \u201cvignettes,\u201d as a way of visiting the distinct topics as they feature in discourse analysis. It will include interchanges with the secular theorists and philosophers such as Judith Butler, Joan Scott and Linda Nicholson who laid the foundations for the revolutionary intervention of gender. Their work definitely had an impact on religion, although it also received harsh criticism from conservatively inclined persons.\n\n7 Leave a comment on paragraph 7 0 This study is a survey of the interactions involving gender, sex, and sexuality, and what Judith Butler initially named the \u201cheterosexual matrix\u201d (Butler 1990, 184).[2] It marks a time and place where extremely profound changes have occurred. What emerged was a dynamic and passionate movement that altered the status and gender roles of many women. The meaning of \u201cgender,\u201d once regarded as a type of culturally determined constraint, has been transformed. Women today do have access to affirming their own gendered identity, if they so choose. However, because of the variant influences and interests that have contributed to this contemporary construct called \u201cgender,\u201d and, even more recently, to strong objections alternative is theoretical claims, \u201cgender,\u201d in this present era, no longer occupies the predominant position it achieved in the 1990s (Scott 2010, 7\u201314). Other models of identity have since burgeoned and stimulated intense debates as to the future of \u201cgender.\u201d It is the dynamics of this intricate journey with its secular and religious implications that follows.\n\nGender Difference, Religion, and their Anomalies\n\n8 Leave a comment on paragraph 8 0 While the word \u201cgender,\u201d with its permutations and negotiations, reflects a contemporary conflict, it can also be claimed retrospectively as the result of a lengthy history where women have attempted to contest their subservience.[3] Historically, the superiority of the male of the human species has been generally acknowledged as virtually all-pervasive. To account for this disparity, specifically in what has been termed the \u201cwestern world,\u201d[4] a short selection of the philosophical, metaphysical, and religiously oriented antecedents that have informed its development is required.\n\n9 Leave a comment on paragraph 9 0 From a contemporary perspective, it may seem to be somewhat arbitrary, even disparaging, to cast blame on Aristotle for introducing a precedent of a human hierarchy where the female is regarded as defective. It is mainly Aristotle\u2019s theoretical and metaphysical works, especially the Politics and the Metaphysics, with their erroneous claims, that have informed much of western philosophy and theology until the twentieth century. Aristotle laid a foundation of misapprehensions about women that has resulted in misogynistic consequences.[5] It is not only the disparity in the attribution of male and female characteristics that is at fault. It is Aristotle\u2019s underlying metaphysical system that cemented his assumptions.\n\n10 Leave a comment on paragraph 10 0 One telling example of Aristotle\u2019s statements is found in the Politics: \u201cThe male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; the one rules, and the other is ruled; this principle, of necessity, extends to all mankind\u201d (Aristotle 1971, 1132: 1254b:1 10\u201315). In contemporary discourse analyses of views on gender, it is Aristotle\u2019s metaphysical system, with both its implicit and explicit assumptions, that have been found wanting. His infamous dictum that the female of the species was basically deformed, i.e., a \u201cmisbegotten male\u201d (Aristotle, Generation of Animals, II, 1943, 75 737a.28\u201329), also helped to establish the origin of women\u2019s inferiority in the western philosophical and theological domains. It is this metaphysical regime that is finally being challenged, although much of the contemporary terminology involved differs from the actual categories that Aristotle himself employed.\n\n11 Leave a comment on paragraph 11 0 Perhaps the most detrimental of Aristotle\u2019s indictments, however, was his remark that women were lacking in what was understood as the rational or deliberative faculty. Aristotle did allow that a woman may have an intuitive grasp of truth, but this insight was not reached by either deliberation or logic. It was a woman\u2019s purported \u201clack of authority\u201d over the irrational elements of her constitution that prevented her from exercising practical reason. It is in the Politics that Aristotle declares: \u201cFor the slave has no deliberative faculty at all; the woman has, but it is without authority, and the child has, but it is immature\u201d (Aristotle 1971, 1144: 1260a:10\u201315). It is pronouncements such as this that are deemed responsible for the stereotype of women\u2019s deficiency in both mind and body.\n\nGendered Observations by Women Scholars\n\n12 Leave a comment on paragraph 12 0 In the discipline of the study of religion, the terms \u201cgender,\u201d \u201csex,\u201d and \u201csexuality\u201d are words that, until quite recently, had not featured prominently. In previous centuries, religious decrees regarding sexual promiscuity were promulgated by clerical authorities, naming what sins to avoid so as not to incur punishment that entailed divine retribution. There were specific formulas directed at men and women, respectively, defining appropriate chaste, gender-specific, and god-fearing conduct. It is a particularly recent development that scholars in religion have taken to investigating these rules and have submitted them to what could be termed a discursive mode of \u201cgender analysis\u201d\u2015examining in detail the complex interactions of \u201cgender,\u201d \u201csex,\u201d and \u201csexuality,\u201d especially in connection with the dynamics of power.\n\n13 Leave a comment on paragraph 13 0 In 1976, Maryanne Cline Horowitz published a comprehensive article entitled simply \u201cAristotle and Woman\u201d (Horowitz 1976). It was one of the first to interrogate rigorously Aristotle\u2019s attitude toward women as is reflected in his writings. It also marked the beginning of a resurgence of critical interest...

The glory of his patience. We wonder, when we see a notorious sinner, how God can let his thunders still lie by him, and his sword rust in his sheath. And, indeed, when such are converted, they wonder themselves that God did not draw his sword out, and pierce their bowels, or shoot one of his arrows into their hearts all this while. But God, by such a forbearance; shews himself to be God indeed, and something in this act infinitely above such a weak creature as man is: 'I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man,' Hosea 11:9. When God had reckoned up their sins before, and they might have expected the sentence after the reading the charge, God tells them, he would not destroy them, he would not execute them, because he was God. If he were not a God, he could not keep himself from pouring out a just vengeance upon them. If a man did inherit all the meekness of all the angels and all the men that ever were in the world, he could not be able to bear with patience the extravagances and injuries done in the world the space of one day; for none but a God, i.e. one infinitely longsuffering, can bear with them.\n\nNot a sin passed in the world before the coming of Christ in the flesh, but was a commendatory letter of God's forbearance, 'To declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God,' Rom. 3:25. And not a sin passed before the coming of Christ into the soul, but gives the same testimony, and bears the same record. And the greater number of sins, and great sins are passed, the more trophies there are erected to God's longsuffering; the reason why the grace of the gospel appeared so late in the world, was to testify God's patience. Our apostle takes notice of this long-suffering towards himself in bearing with such a persecutor. 'Howbeit, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him,' 1 Tim. 1:16. This was Christ's end in letting him run so far, that he might shew forth not a few mites, grains, or ounces of patience, but all longsuffering, longsuffering without measure, or weight, by wholesale; and this as a pattern to all ages of the world; upotupwsin for a type: a type is but a shadow in respect of the substance. To shew, that all the ages of the world should not waste that patience, whereof he had then manifested but a pattern.\n\nA pattern, we know, is less than the whole piece of cloth from whence it is cut; and as an essay is but a short taste of a man's skill, and doth not discover all his art, as the first miracle Christ wrought, of turning water into wine, as a sample of what power he had, was less than those miracles which succeeded; and the first miracle God wrought in Egypt, in turning Aaron's rod into a serpent, was but a sample of his power which would produce greater wonders; so this patience to Paul was but a little essay of his meekness, a little patience cut off from the whole piece, which should always be dealing out to some sinners or other, and would never be cut wholly out till the world had left being. This sample or pattern was but of the extent of a few years; for Paul was but young, the Scripture terms him a young man, Acts 7:58, about thirty-six years of age, yet he calls it all longsuffering. Ah, Paul! Some since have experienced more of this patience; in some it has reached not only to thirty, but forty, fifty, or sixty years.\n\n2. Grace. It is partly for the admiration of this grace that God intends the day of judgment. It is a strange place: 'When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe in that day,' 2 Thess. 1:10. What, has not Christ glory enough in heaven with his Father? Will he come on purpose to seek glory from such worthless creatures as his saints are? What is that which glorifies Christ in them? It is the gracious work he has wrought in them. For the word is, endoxasqhnai en agioiV, to be inglorified in his saints, i.e. by something within them; for which they glorify Christ actively and objectively. As the creatures glorify the wisdom and power of God, by affording matter to men to do so, so does the work of God in saints afford matter of praise to angels, and admiration to devils. The apostle useth two words: glorified, that is, the work of angels and saints, who shall sing out his praises for it, as a prince, after a great conquest, receives the congratulations of all his nobility; admired, that the very devil and damned shall do; for, though their malice and condition will not suffer them to praise him, yet, his inexpressible love in making such black insides so beautiful, shall astonish them.\n\nIn this sense those things under the earth shall bow down to that name of Jesus, a Saviour; a name which God gave him at first: 'Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,' Philip. 2:9. And upon his exaltation did confirm, Heb. 5:9, when he was made perfect, i.e. exalted, he became the author of eternal salvation, and had the power of saving, as well as the name conferred upon him. They shall confess that he is Lord, Philip. 2:11, i.e. that he acted like a Lord, when he prevailed over all the opposition which those great sinners made against him. The whole trial of the saints, and the sentence of their blessedness, shall be finished before that of the damned, Mat. 25:85, 44. That the whole scene of his love, and the wonders of the work of faith being laid open, might strike them with a vast amazement. And that this is the design of Christ, to be thus glorified in his grace and power, appears by the apostle's prayer, ver. 11, 12, that the Thessalonians might be in the number of those Christ should be thus glorified in. Therefore he prays, that God would 'fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness,' i.e. that grace he so pleased and delighted to manifest, and carry on the work of faith with power; 'that the name of Christ might be glorified in them,' as well as in the rest of his saints. Ordinary conversion is an act of grace; Barnabas so interprets it, Acts 11:21, 23, when a great number believed; what abundance of grace then is expended in converting a company of extraordinary sinners!\n\nIt is the glory of a man to pass by an offence, Prov. 19:11, i.e. it is a manifestation of a property which is an honour to him to be known to have. If it be thus an honour to pass by an offence simply, then the greater the offence is, and the more the offences are which he passeth by, the greater must the glory needs be, because it is a manifestation of such a quality in greater strength and vigour. So it must argue a more exceeding grace in God to remit many and great sins in man, than to forgive only some few and lesser offences.\n\n(1.) Fulness of his grace. He shews hereby that there is more grace in him than there can be sin in us or the whole world. He lets some sinners run mightily upon his score, to manifest that though they are beggared, yet his grace is not; that though they have spent all their stock upon their swinish lusts, yet they have not drained his treasures; no more than the sun is emptied of its strength by exhaling the ill vapours of so many dunghills. This was his design in giving the moral law, finis operis; that is, the event of the law was to increase the sin; but finis operantis, was thereby to glorify his grace; 'Moreover, the law entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,' Rom. 5:20. When the law of nature was out of print, and so blurred that it could scarce be read, God brings the moral law (the counterpart of the law of nature) in a new edition into the world; and thereby sin hath new aggravations, as being rebellion against a clearer light, a swelling and breaking over this mighty bank of the law laid in its way. But this was serviceable to the fulness of his grace, which had more abundant matter hereby to work upon, and a larger field to sow its inexhaustible seed in, upereperisseusen, it did superabound. That grace should rise in its tide higher than sin, and bear it down before it, just as the rolling tide of the sea riseth higher than the streams of the river, and beats them back with all their mud and filth. It was mercy in God to create us; it is abundant mercy to make any new creatures, after they had forfeited their happiness, 1 Pet. 1:3, which, according to his abundant mercy, kata to polu, according to his much mercy. But it was uperpleonazousa cariV, overflowing, exceeding abundant, more than full grace, to make such deformed creatures new creatures, ver. 14 of this chapter.\n\n(2.) Freeness of grace. None can entertain an imagination that Christ should be a debtor to sin, unless in vengeance, much less a debtor to the worst of sinners. But if Christ should only take persons of moral and natural excellencies, men might suspect that Christ were some way or other engaged to them, and that the gift of salvation were limited to the endowments of nature, and the good exercise and use of a man's own will. But when he puts no difference between persons of the least and those of the greatest demerit, but affecting the foulest monsters of sin, as well as the fairest of nature's children, he builds triumphal arches to his grace upon thi...
