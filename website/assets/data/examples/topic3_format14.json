After practicing defense work for more than ten years, Mahaley is excited to bring her knowledge of the inner-workings of insurance companies to help individuals who have sustained serious personal injuries.\n\nAreas of Practice:\nPersonal Injury\nBusiness Litigation\nClass Action & Multidistrict Litigation\nConsumer Protection Litigation\nEstate & Trust Litigation\nFarm and Agricultural Product Defects\nHome Construction Defects\n\n\n\nMahaley was born in Union Springs, Alabama in 1973. When she was five years old, her family moved to Montgomery, but she returned to Union Springs frequently to visit family and friends and would often commute with her dad who worked for Bonnie Plant Farm. On these drives together, her dad would tell her stories of growing up in Union Springs during the 1950s and 1960s and how the civil rights movement impacted his life and the lives of his friends and co-workers on the Farm. It was these conversations that instilled in Mahaley the importance of being an advocate for the \"little guy\" as well as a healthy dose of skepticism for conformity and self-righteousness. Mahaley also learned the importance of education from her mom, who went back to school when Mahaley was young, earning a Masters in Education, and her dad, who went to law school at night and while working full time.\n\nMahaley graduated from Emory University in 1996 and decided to go to law school after working as an intern for the United Nations Association of the United States of America in New York, New York. She graduated from Emory University Law School in 2000, and joined the firm of L. Lin Wood P.C. in Atlanta, Georgia, where she was fortunate to represent high profile clientele such as John and Patsy Ramsey and Richard Jewell. In 2004, Mahaley began working for a large defense firm in Atlanta, where she cut her teeth handling general negligence, premises and automobile liability defense claims on behalf of nationally recognized insurance companies and their insureds. In 2007, she was promoted to partner and was recognized as a Georgia Rising Star by Atlanta Magazine. Despite her apparent success, Mahaley's roots ran deep, and when the opportunity presented itself, Mahaley was eager to return to her hometown and practice law with Jinks, Crow & Dickson, P.C.\n\nMahaley and her husband, Jody, live in Montgomery and have two sons, Duncan and Thomas. She looks forward to many more commutes with her dad, who also joined the Firm in 2012.\n\n\nHome\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lawyer Referral Login\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact Us\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Founding Members\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resources \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Alabama Directory\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 County Directory\u00a0\u00a0 City Directory\u00a0\n\nAccidents & Injury \u00a0\u00a0 Appeals \u00a0\u00a0 Banking & Finance \u00a0\u00a0 Bankruptcy\u00a0\u00a0 Business & Corporate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Civil Rights\u00a0\u00a0 Commercial Litigation\u00a0 Construction\n\nConsumer\u00a0 Contract\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Criminal Defense\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Divorce & Family\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DUI & Misdemeanor\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Education\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Elder Law\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employment\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Environmental\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nERISA Defense\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ERISA Plaintiff\u00a0\u00a0 General Practice\u00a0\u00a0 Healthcare \u00a0\u00a0 Insurance\u00a0\u00a0 IP & Technology\u00a0 Juvenile Law \u00a0 Landlord & Tenant\u00a0\u00a0 Maritime Law\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMediation & Arbitration\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pharmaceutical \u00a0 Product Liability\u00a0\u00a0 Public Sector\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Real Estate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Social Security\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taxation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trust & Estate\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Wills & Probate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Workers Comp\n\nThis website is in no way intended to constitute and does not constitute legal advice.

Greg works with physicians, hospitals, management and development companies, diagnostic and therapeutic healthcare providers, and investors and investment companies that work with healthcare companies. \u00a0He has assisted clients on a variety of matters including entity formation and capitalization; corporate governance and governing document preparation and negotiation; joint venture negotiation and regulatory structuring; business combinations, and purchases and sales of equity and assets; compliance program development and implementation; and civil and criminal fraud and abuse issues arising under state and federal health care fraud and abuse laws.\u00a0 Greg has served as the Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of both a publicly traded company that owned and operated an integrated health care delivery system, and a national supply chain services company that served the non-acute health care industry. Greg regularly acts as outside legal counsel and board advisor to small and medium sized companies.\n\nOutside the office, Greg enjoys golf and spending time with his wife Anna and their four daughters.\u00a0 He has served on, or consults with, several charitable and non-profit boards, including the Notre Dame School of Dallas, St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic School, Ursuline Academy, and Stairs, Inc.\n\nCredentials & Experience\n\nLearn more about your compliance partner.\n\n\n  \u2022 Texas A&M University, B.B.A. Finance (1986)\n  \u2022 Texas Tech University School of Law, J.D., Magna Cum Laude, Law Review (1995)\n\n\n  \u2022 Texas State Bar\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas\n  \u2022 U.S. District Court, District of Colorado\n  \u2022 U.S. Tax Court\n\nWant to learn more about ByrdAdatto?\n\nContent by Greg A.

Although based in Thompsons\u2019 Newcastle office, she also covers cases in the Yorkshire and Humberside region.\n\nHaving qualified in 2008, Harjinder specialises in professional misconduct work and represents union members mainly in the health sector, including nurses, midwives, paramedics and social workers. Some of her cases have included allegations of contributing to the deaths of patients and serious breaches of professional boundaries.\n\nHer main responsibilities involve acting for clients at all stages of the proceedings which include reviewing the evidence, advising clients on their case, preparing and advising clients on early responses to the regulator, preparing the case for interim hearings and final hearings.\u00a0 Her aim is always to provide sound advice to achieve the best and most lenient outcome for her client during what can be a very long and distressing process.\n\nHarjinder enjoys working for a firm that is committed to social justice. In particular she likes the fact that her work is different from other legal firms as all her clients are union members. Through the legal services the firm provides to trade unions she is able to represent clients who otherwise might not be able to afford the professional help and advice she can give them.\n\nWhen not at work, Harjinder enjoys spending time with her family.\n\nHarjinder's Case Experience\n\nLack of Capability and Competence Allegations\n\nHarjinder was asked to represent a health professional client who faced allegations relating to her capability and competence. Harjinder immediately submitted an early response to the Health and Care Professions Council along with evidence showing that the concerns raised about the client\u2019s practice had been resolved. The Council found there was no case to answer.\n\nSexual Assault Allegations\n\nFollowing serious allegations of sexual misconduct, Harjinder\u2019s client was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\u00a0 After hearing the very detailed defence that Harjinder prepared, the panel found that the allegations against the member could not be proven and therefore found there was no case to answer.\n\nSerious Dishonesty Allegations\n\nHarjinder represented a health professional in a case concerning very serious allegations of dishonesty, which the client admitted. Harjinder prepared a statement and advised the client on how to best to respond to the allegations in order to show the regulatory panel hearing the case that she understood the seriousness of her actions and would never again be dishonest.\u00a0 The hearing panel accepted the evidence and concluded that the most lenient sanction of a caution would be suitable.\u00a0\n\n\nClient Testimonials\n\n\u201cThank you for your help and support throughout this ordeal. I have what I regard as a result and am about to commence full time employment. It is always nice to have a kind reassuring voice at the end of the phone. Once again, thank you for your help, support and reassurance\u201d.",

Malinowski focuses his practice on highly complex, \"bet the company\" trials and litigation.\u00a0 He has defended corporate clients in serial mass tort litigation and trials, including both state and federal multi-district litigation.\u00a0 He specializes in the areas of medical device and pharmaceutical products liability defense, multiple plaintiff serial trials and related litigation, high-stakes financial and commercial contract disputes, high dollar lost business value and business interruption claims, and putative class action and mass groundwater and soil contamination cases.\n\nMr. Malinowski has a wealth of experience in all levels of high-stakes litigation.\u00a0 He has tried cases in state and federal courts and has handled every level of trial advocacy, including picking juries, in so-called \u201cJudicial Hellhole\u201d jurisdictions.\u00a0 He has extensive experience in cross and direct examinations of fact and expert witnesses at trial, as well as conducting summary judgment and Daubert dispositive motions hearings, both pre-trial and during trial, in courts throughout the country.\n\nOver the last several months, Mr. Malinowski has developed a specialty for successfully defending brand-name pharmaceutical companies against so-called \u201cinnovator liability\u201d claims by plaintiffs allegedly injured by exposure to generic drugs.\u00a0 This includes obtaining pre-litigation dismissals in courts in\u00a0Texas and Idaho based on the rejection of the innovator liability doctrine as a valid cause of action. (See W.D. Texas order.)\n\nMr. Malinowski is lead trial counsel for one of the world\u2019s largest petrochemical companies in serial state-court trials in Iberville Parish, Louisiana stemming from a plant explosion and subsequent two-year plant shutdown. For the past three years, he has actively prosecuted commercial contract claims against a large company that formerly co-owned and operated the plant under both breach of contract and contractual indemnification causes of action with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake. Trial in that matter is set for November 2020.\u00a0 From 2014 through early 2017, he litigated, tried and picked juries in multiple personal injury cases involving the same plant explosion.\n\nIn 2014, he successfully tried for a large pharmaceutical company a case on remand from one of the most active federal MDLs, achieving a defense verdict in Florida after the jury deliberated for less than 45 minutes following a three-week trial. \u00a0In that same litigation, he obtained summary judgment on various different independent legal grounds in multiple cases, including specific causation, general causation, and adequacy of the drug\u2019s warning. \u00a0He has also obtained a dispositive Daubert victory excluding a serial causation expert\u2019s opinion in its entirety as unreliable.\n\nMr. Malinowski regularly advises clients on various employment and labor controversies both before and after litigation has ensued. \u00a0He represents corporate clients in extra-jurisdictional document production disputes involving internal employment files and other highly sensitive corporate documents and assessments. \u00a0He also counsels clients on the proper handling and best practices associated with different garnishment proceedings throughout the country. \u00a0He leads interviews of potential corporate witnesses both before and after lawsuits are filed to develop a detailed understanding of the underlying facts necessary to present the best possible corporate liability litigation defense.\n\nMr. Malinowski has been heavily involved in some of the Firm\u2019s most notable recent cases. In 2018, he represented an industry sponsored recycling program as lead counsel in an anti-trust case pending in California.\u00a0 He represented a large Firm client in the defense of a substantial lost business value and business interruption case stemming from a train derailment at an industrial plant site, in which the plaintiff company sought hundreds of millions of dollars in alleged damages. \u00a0That trial, which was tried in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, lasted just one out of an anticipated three months before the parties reached a confidential settlement.\n\nMr. Malinowski also represented a medical device manufacturer in serial litigation involving surgical mesh used to repair hernias, and was part of the trial team for the first jury trial in that litigation, which resulted in a complete defense verdict that was subsequently named by The National Law Journal as one of the year's \"Top Ten Defense Wins.\" \u00a0He has actively participated in both pre-filing and post-filing investigations and corporate witness interviews regarding a recalled product for the same client, and helped develop winning litigation strategies from the ground up based on these investigations.\n\nMr. Malinowski has experience conducting extensive jury selection in state courts, often against high-profile local plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. \u00a0He has experience handling every aspect of trial practice. \u00a0He regularly conducts trial examinations of experts in medical, economic, financial, petrochemical, environmental disciplines, and corporate witnesses.\u00a0 Mr. Malinowski has conducted affirmative direct examinations of corporate witnesses at trial, and has defended employees in numerous depositions. \u00a0He also has prepared pre-trial mock jury presentations and represented some of the Firm\u2019s largest clients in high-stakes mediations. \u00a0He has been instrumental in the successful resolution of many of the Firm\u2019s complex cases, including Daubert summary dispositions and trials.\n\nMr. Malinowski is an active member of the National Association of Railroad Trial Counsel (NARTC). \u00a0He currently serves as a member of the executive committees on preemption and program issues for NARTC, and serves as a faculty member instructor for the NARTC\u2019s Annual Trial College \u2014 an intensive six-day trial techniques course attended by attorneys throughout the country. \u00a0He has also given numerous presentations on various topics throughout the country, including ethical and strategic trial strategies in high profile litigation.\n\nMr. Malinowski is a member of the Defense Research Institute and The John Carroll Society. \u00a0He was a summer associate at the Firm in 2001 and 2002, practiced as an associate beginning in 2003, and became a partner in early 2011.\n\n\n  \u2022 And The Defense Wins: DRI's The Voice recognizes Matt Malinowski as district court rejects innovator claims against Firm client Novartis\n  \u2022 Pursuing Sanctions Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927: An Underused Defense Strategy\n  \u2022 And the Defense Wins: DRI's The Voice recognizes Matthew J.
