They argue this new bounty should be shared-especially with hungry markets in Asia and Europe willing to pay a high price for the fuel. But long-distance transport of natural gas is one of the world's most expensive engineering feats, and it will require government approvals, community support, and billions of dollars in capital to take North American gas......\n\nRead Complete Article at Water Conserve: Water Conservation RSS News Feed\n\nYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\n\nLeave a Reply",

A British inventor, Henry Bessemer, is generally credited with the invention of the first technique to mass produce steel in the mid 1850s. Steel is the world's most recycled material and its properties remain unchanged no matter how many times the steel is recycled. Our infographic has been produced to show how steel is recycled, starting with the actual collection of the recovered materials being melted in a furnace, to being remoulded, used and then being collected for recycling.\nRead More",
