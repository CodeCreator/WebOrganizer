        "text":"We\u2019ve all made the promises before, but that doesn\u2019t stop us from making them again: We\u2019re going to focus on getting fit in the New Year \u2013 No, for real this time! \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to let the Chippewa Valley\u2019s cold weather be an excuse. If you\u2019re creative \u2013 and you can get your hands on the right equipment \u2013 this is a great time of year to work out, even outdoors. Here are some ways you can improve your body while enjoying the beauty of the Eau Claire area.\n\n\u00a0Beaver Creek Snowshoeing - Photo by: Andrea Paulseth\nOnce there\u2019s some powder on the ground, strap on some snowshoes and get outside. Whether they\u2019re lightweight aluminum or old-school wooden models, snowshoes will help you blaze a trail through the crisp stillness of a Wisconsin winter. There are plenty of great places to snowshoe in the Eau Claire area (here), including Tower Ridge Recreation Area, Beaver Creek Reserve, and Lowes Creek County Park. The latter location was the site of the 2015 U.S. National Snowshoe Championships, and on Feb. 13 this year it will host the annual Powder Keg Snowshoe and Fat-Bike Races. Check out corbapowderkeg.com for details.\n\n\u00a0Cross Country Skiing - Photo by: Elizabeth & Cindy Schultz, Volume One\nOur northern neighbor Hayward may be home to the world-famous American Birkebeiner, but the Chippewa Valley is no slouch when it comes to cross-country skiing, either. In the city limits alone, there are four groomed trails: Carson Park, Fairfax Park, Pinehurst Park, and the City Wells Area across from Riverview Park. Just outside town you\u2019ll find dozens of additional miles of trails at places like Tower Ridge, Beaver Creek, Lowes Creek, and the amazing Hoffman Hills State Recreation Area outside Menomonie, which features nine miles of trails of varying difficulty that are groomed for both stride and skate-style skiers.\n\n\u00a0Curling U.S. Mixed Doubles National Championship - Photo by: Andrea Paulseth, Volume One\nThis ancient Scottish sport is quite popular in Wisconsin, where we appreciate its competitiveness, civility, and the fact that you can drink beer in between sending 44-pound curling stones across the ice. (Remember: Drinking too much beer may work against your fitness goals.) The Eau Claire Curling Club, which has its home ice at the Eau Claire County Exposition Center, 5530 Fairview Drive, welcomes spectators during regular league play and during bonspiels, or tournaments, and holds periodic open house sessions where kids and adults can try their hands at the icy action.\n\n\nVolleyball at Wagners - Photo by: Andrea Paulseth, Volume One\nThanks to the wonders of 21st-century technology \u2013 i.e., a big, inflatable plastic dome \u2013 you can now play sand volleyball in the dead of winter in Eau Claire. The newly constructed Complexx at Wagner\u2019s Lanes, 2159 Brackett Ave., features three sand volleyball courts, a tiki bar, and space for 500 patrons for events like concerts and parties. And if volleyball isn\u2019t your thing, there\u2019s always bowling.\n\u00a0Gold's Gym - Photo by: Andrea Paulseth, Volume One\nFinally, if you just want to burn some calories shooting hoops, swimming laps, or going nuts on the elliptical machine, there are dozens of fitness centers, big and small, that can help you meet your goals. If you\u2019re traveling in the Chippewa Valley, some gyms offer days passes, while the Eau Claire YMCA will let members of any other YMCA use its facilities free of charge. In short, you won\u2019t break a sweat finding somewhere to break a sweat!",

        "text":"6 Players to Watch in Premier League\u00a02010\/11\n\nWell it\u2019s time for that obligatory Premier League Preview. However due to lack of time and the fact that several esteemed journalists (and some not at all esteemed) have previewed the league, I feel it\u2019s best to highlight 6 players who have all the tools needed to be proficient and\u00a0efficient\u00a0in the Premier League.\n\nIt\u2019s been a strange transfer window really. Very quiet bar the big spenders Manchester City and also a case of \u2018chase the hottest prospect around Europe\u2019 game (Loic Remy, Mesut Ozil) in which several managers have participated in and ultimately coming up with no signing.\n\nI\u2019ve imposed certain rulings here. Firstly I cannot go with obvious suggestions that media darling pundits have, so this means Javier Hernandez will not be selected due to the fact the world and his dog know he will be good this year and if you\u2019re a eagle-eyed World Cup viewer, you\u2019ll know exactly what he will bring to Manchester United. This also means no David Silva, Jack Wilshere, Gareth Bale, Joe Hart et al.\n\nThe other ruling is that I\u2019m going to try and highlight players outside the Big Four if possible unless I feel a certain player at a big club deserves attention. So sorry Joe Cole, but I wouldn\u2019t have picked you anyway despite the fact that you are clearly more \u00a0skilful than Lionel Messi, according to your club captain (surely a contender for Biggest Heaping of Pressure on an Overrated midfielder.)\n\nSo here we go, 6pointer\u2019s guide to 6 players you should put into your fantasy football team if you can:\n\n1. Mauro Boselli (Wigan)\n\nI\u2019ll be honest I was worried about Wigan at the beginning of this transfer window. Several players have left the club after their contracts expired, such as Mario Melchiot (who was beginning to become a liability anyway) and Paul Scharner. Other key players had jumped ship too, like Titus Bramble joining his former manager Steve Bruce at Sunderland.\n\nMartinez had a massive summer scouting mission ahead of him. Fortunately, he\u2019s managed to make some great signings. Antolin Alcaraz from Club Bruges, was instrumental in Paraguay\u2019s World Cup success, forged upon a tightly knit defence. Ronnie Stam has signed from FC Twente, who\u2019s continually improved there as a right-back and got a Holland call-up too.\n\nBut one thing that Wigan have always lacked at this level is an out and out frontman, who\u2019s capable of consistently performing. Step forward\u00a0Mauro Boselli. Signed from Estudiantes for an estimated \u00a36.5million, he swaps the bustling streets of Buenos Aires for a wet and windy Wigan.\n\nHe\u2019d managed to build quite a reputation for himself in Argentina, scoring 32 goals in 57 appearances for Estudiantes. He\u2019s an intelligent striker, who knows exactly where to be at the right time.\n\nMartinez describes him as \u2018a goalscorer, who lives to put the ball in the back of the net\u2019 and if he links up well with Hugo Rodallega or Jordi Gomez, I feel we might see a barrage of goals at Wigan this year.\n\nWhy Terry Venables thinks they\u2019ll be 19th I don\u2019t know, when Martinez has added some quality to a pretty ropey side. Boselli has even made a Argentinian call-up. You may see this as Diego Maradona experimenting, after all he\u2019s used about 50 players in the last 2 years, but you have to some sort of quality to challenge that front-line.\n\nHe could flop like so many South Americans before him in this league, but I feel the top scorer in the Copa Libertadores in 2009 might just be this season\u2019s best purchase, and will warrant a big move the year after.\n\nEDIT \u2013 23\/9\/10 \u2013 After seeing Mauro Boselli, live in the flesh, discount any information you see here. He looked sluggish against Preston. Sean St Ledger kept him in his pocket the entire night pretty much. Don\u2019t listen to me, I have sinned.\n\n2.Daniel Sturridge (Chelsea)\n\nOk, I\u2019ve broken the Top Four amnesty. But I don\u2019t think many people realise the quality of this young English centre-forward. This decision was mainly down to his performance in last week\u2019s Community Shield, where came on 2nd half replacing Nicolas Anelka. I feel this might happen a lot this year, since I think Anelka is under serious threat of finding himself at another club. He\u2019s hardly had a good summer either, and I think his time at a top level is coming to an end.\n\nThis is why I feel Daniel Sturridge is an ideal replacement. He has power and pace in abundance and Carlo Ancelotti found opportunity to play him a lot in the later months of last season, particularly in Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup winning side. He ended up with 4 goals in the FA Cup and finished as the leading scorer for Chelsea.\n\nIf Carlo Ancelotti\u00a0integrates\u00a0him more this season, we may well see Sturridge challenge for national selection. The future\u2019s bright for this young man I reckon.\n\n3.Jerome Boateng (Man City)\n\nIf you were to ask me last season where City needed strengthening, the answer is obvious. The back four last year began superbly but then collapsed as the season progressed. For all your attacking options, you need players capable of offering protection to a solid goalkeeper. Roberto Mancini has acted this summer and brought in German international Jerome Boateng from Hamburg. Of course \u00a311 million isn\u2019t cheap but compared to the \u00a324million City paid for Joleon Lescott, it looks a bargain.\n\nBoateng is a strong and versatile defender, capable of playing really anywhere across the defence. He\u2019ll thrive in this league, as he\u2019s renowned for last-ditch defending. He was unsung really in Germany\u2019s World Cup exploits, the plaudits of a free-flowing attack were well noted but it was underpinned by a strong defence. City should be improved this season as I think their major weakness has been sorted out to some extent.\n\n4.Dani Pacheco (Liverpool)\n\nHe\u2019s often been touted as the next best thing at Liverpool, but former manager Rafa Benitez never really used him or got the best out of him when he did. I think under Roy Hodsgon we may see that change. Pacheco was instrumental along with Sergio Canales in the Spanish side that were runners-up in this year\u2019s U19\u2019s European Championship in France. What Dani lacks in height, he makes up double in creativity and all-round trickiness, a general requirement of any Barcelona youth player.\n\nIf given the chance this season under Hodgson, he could link up well with a fully fit Fernando Torres (will this ever happen?) and we should see more of the man nicknamed The Assassin by\u00a0team-mates\u00a0due to his ability to score from anywhere.\n\n5.Graham Dorrans (West Brom)\n\nI feel it\u2019s only fair to highlight someone from the promoted teams, and while Charlie Adam seems a good pick, I\u2019ve decided to go with the Baggies playmaker. He was unbelievable last season in the Championship, and certainly worthy of his place in the Team of the Year. He\u2019s the\u00a0linchpin of the side, and his partnership with Chris Brunt was key to West Brom\u2019s promotion last year. He\u2019s an all-round central midfielder with a sweet shot on him too.\n\nI still think West Brom are relegation candidates, after all the club is a yo-yo side, but if they want to avoid the drop look no further to their young midfield driving force. All they need a good striker and they may have a chance to get mid-table. Even if West Brom go down, I get the feeling he won\u2019t find it hard to garner some Premier League interest.\n\nScotland, there is something to get excited about from a upcoming star.\n\n6. Pablo Barrera (West Ham)\n\nAnother player to shine in Javier Aguirre\u2019s exciting Mexican side, this winger could prove a real handful for some Premier League teams. The thing I remember most about Barrera at the World Cup was the torrid time he gave Eric Abidal in the France game (arguably Mexico\u2019s best performance at the World Cup). He looks nippy and a decent crosser too, something that West Ham will need to feed Carlton Cole up top, or maybe Frank Nouble if he\u2019s given a chance.\n\nThe 23 year old moved from Mexican side Pumas for \u00a34 million. I\u2019m not totally convinced about West Ham\u2019s plans under Avram Grant but I think Barrera could be a hugely\u00a0influential\u00a0midfielder for them.\n\nSo there we have it. Let\u2019s see next May how badly wrong I was.\n\n\nWorld Cup Preview \u2013 The Last\u00a016\n\nWell, so far, the World Cup has seen many talking points, arguably most off the field. The mass hysteria over the flight of the Jabulani football and the whurring of mutant bees around the grounds courtesy of that old friend, the vuvuzela. The French threatening a mutiny and also who could forget Robbie Earle selling his 36 tickets ( he had 400 in total for the tournament) for the Holland Denmark game to some lovely Dutch ladies. This World Cup has set a precedent for outrageous moments.\n\nWe\u2019ve had some great footballing moments in a World Cup\u00a0apparently\u00a0littered with terrible games if you believe the pundits. But this only makes it more fascinating, some of the \u2018dull\u2019 games have been great tactical battles, others have been exactly that: dull (England Algeria, France Uruguay being the 2 main examples). At the end of the day, if you are a pundit moaning at getting paid for being at a World Cup, then you need to re-assess how much of a prat you are.\n\nSome sides have fascinated, others have fallen flat at the first hurdle. Underdogs have shined in South Africa as well. New Zealand were unbeaten in the group stage but faced an flight back to Auckland whilst Italy became a country for Old Men after they finished bottom of Group F. Switzerland\u2019s tight defensive unit defeated the pre-tournament champions elect, Spain and Germany once again proved their tournament mettle with some convincing displays. And of course El Diego\u2019s faith in Saint Martin Palermo was proved right after he scored a goal. I honestly didn\u2019t predict that.\n\nHalf the fun of this tournament has been the off-screen stuff (such as watching Diego Maradona waltz around in a rather fetching monochrome number) but we now reach crunch-time. The Last 16.\n\nThroughout the years, we\u2019ve had some unbelievable ties and this year wil... (truncated)",

        "text":"7 trade targets for Patriots ahead of NFL's deadline\n\nThe New England Patriots are likely to be active in the trade market this month. They always seem to be.\n\nAnd while a few big names \u2014 most notably cornerbacks Marcus Peters and Jalen Ramsey \u2014 have already moved, those transactions may be just the beginning of an eventful 2019 trade deadline. There are a handful of players who could get traded, particularly at the Patriots\u2019 perceived positions of need: tight end and wide receiver. Rob Gronkowski doesn\u2019t seem to be walking in that door. (Though, N\u2019Keal Harry might be.)\n\nSo the Patriots could look to the trade market to bring in a talented pass-catcher for quarterback Tom Brady. Here are a few options.\n\n1. O.J. Howard, TE, Buccaneers\n\nDouglas DeFelice-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHoward finished 2018 with 34 catches for 565 yards and five touchdowns in 10 games, but the third-year tight end has mostly been a nonfactor in new coach Bruce Arians\u2019 offense. He would appeal to the Patriots because he\u2019s 1) a buy-low candidate, 2) he\u2019s on his rookie contract and 3) he fills a position of need. Howard would immediately become the top pass-catching tight end in the Patriots offense, which is devoid of a clear option.\n\nMore Stories\n\nPatriots 2020 free agency: Danny Shelton poised to capitalize on big season\n\nDanny Shelton has come a long way since this time last year. The New England Patriots had virtually no market in free agency, and found himself returning to the team which benched him during the 2018 season. He signed a one-year, prove-it deal, which landed him back in free agency this offseason. And the gamble paid off.\n\nAs Bill Belichick explained this season, Shelton took a major step forward in his on-field contributions in a new scheme in New England. He was well-suited for the Patriots' front, and got more play time, which yielded more production (61 tackles, 3 sacks)....\n\nRead the full article\n\nFrom The Web Ads by Zergnet\n\n10 offensive prospects for Patriots to watch at the 2020 NFL combine\n\nThe New England Patriots need offensive weapons after a down year. Quarterback Tom Brady had one of his worst statistical seasons in just about every passing category. And so as he is set to enter free agency, he seems to be patiently waiting for New England to signal it is going to prioritize helping him this offseason.\n\nThat will surely start in free agency, when the Patriots will be attempting to re-sign Brady while adding a handful of other skill players. But it will continue in the 2020 NFL Draft. So with the NFL combine taking place in Indianapolis this...\n\nRead the full article\n\nPro Football Focus predicts an aggressive free agency for Patriots\n\nPro Football Focus, the digital scouting service, thinks the New England Patriots are going to be bold in free agency this offseason. With quarterback Tom Brady apparently awaiting a better supporting cast after a rough 2019 season, Bill Belichick may take an aggressive approach in surrounding the quarterback with talent.\n\nNot only does PFF see the Patriots bringing Brady back in 2020, but it also sees the team signing a top receiver and tight end. No doubt, these signings would come hand-in-hand, with the two skill players contributing to this hypothetical scenario in which Brady elects not to leave...\n\nRead the full article",

        "text":"Vince Wilfork Believes Lockout Will Create a Change in Patriots Draft Philosophy and 19 Other NFL Thoughts\n\n\nVince Wilfork Believes Lockout Will Create a Change in Patriots Draft Philosophy and 19 Other NFL Thoughts It\u2019s only Hump Day, and this is already shaping up to be the busiest week of the NFL offseason. More so, with the lockout blockout and the draft on the horizon, it\u2019s amazing to think about the impact this week will have on the future of the league.\n\nThis edition of the Two-Minute Drill touches on both subjects and a whole lot more, including a couple of very interesting quotes \u2014 one about the Jets and another about the general uselessness of the annual rookie symposium.\n\n1. NFLPA executive Pete Kendall is one of the most knowledgeable sources when it comes to the labor negotiations, and I caught up with him Tuesday. My opinion for the last month was the players would need to win the owners\u2019 injunction appeal in order for there to be a full regular season in 2011. If the owners win the appeal, the only chance for a full season would come through negotiations for a new CBA, and the two sides are simply too far apart right now to believe that can happen. Plus, the owners will have every ounce of leverage if they win the appeal, so they\u2019ll have little need to back down from their stringent CBA demands.\n\n2. I asked Kendall about that, and here was his response: \u201cAt this point, any conversation or any discussions have to be under the framework of a settlement of a lawsuit. There is no collective bargaining going on, and I don\u2019t know if in fact there ever will be again. The union announced they\u2019re no longer a collective-bargaining unit for the players. So we\u2019ll see how this process plays itself out. There was court-supervised mediation that allowed for a conversation to take place between the two parties, and perhaps that will be the forum going forward.\u201d\n\n3. A couple things stand out there. First, Kendall said he doesn\u2019t know if there will ever be collective bargaining again, which means he doesn\u2019t know if the NFLPA will ever get back together. That\u2019s probably a stretch on Kendall\u2019s part, but it\u2019s very interesting to hear him say it\u2019s even possible.\n\n4. Next, Kendall couldn\u2019t even entertain the thought of collectively bargaining because it would conflict with the purpose of dissolving the union, which was for the players to try their hand in court. Therefore, if the owners win the appeal, the players\u2019 next course of action will likely be reforming the union and heading back to collective bargaining. But for now, they can\u2019t admit that because it would crush their stance in court.\n\n5. It\u2019s all speculation at this point, but the players\u2019 side is definitely less confident about winning the owners\u2019 injunction appeal than they were about winning the preliminary injunction ruling. Kendall, though, thinks Judge Susan Nelson\u2018s 89-page court ruling was worded so heavily in the players\u2019 favor that it might be more difficult for the Eighth Circuit to rule in favor of the owners. \u201cShe wrote a very tightly worded decision, and it may be difficult to overturn on an appeal,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n\n6. The Patriots have a reputation for not dealing with agent Tom Condon and his agency, CAA, and that resulted from some rocky negotiations with tight end Ben Watson. The Patriots haven\u2019t drafted a CAA client since, and that\u2019s important to note because Boston College tackle Anthony Castonzo, Wisconsin defensive end J.J. Watt and BC linebacker Mark Herzlich are all CAA products, and all three would be good fits in New England.\n\n7. I asked around the league to find out if it was common for teams to avoid certain players due to their agents and heard stories about several teams that follow the same pattern. One league source said, \u201cI know for a fact the Jets do it.\u201d\n\n8. Obviously, a rookie scale could change that approach, but there\u2019s still no certainty that it will be implemented for this draft class. Plus, teams know that agent could still be in place for their second contract.\n\n9. How crazy are these NFL draft rumors? Within the last few days, John Elway told reporters the Broncos haven\u2019t received a single call about their second overall pick. On Tuesday, NFL Network cited several general managers who believed the Redskins would move up to No. 2 to draft Blaine Gabbert. Obviously, this stuff can happen very quickly, but I find it extremely hard to believe Elway on this one.\n\n10. Had a good talk with Patriots backup quarterback Brian Hoyer on Tuesday, and I asked him what he thought about the Pats working out quarterbacks Jake Locker (a near-certain first-rounder) and Ryan Mallett (a likely second-rounder who has a slight chance to go in the first round). Hoyer was candid with his response: \u201cIt\u2019s a business. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to stay ahead of the game and keep working out, and whatever they decide to do, I\u2019m comfortable with it. There\u2019s always going to be some sort of competition, so I just assume every year there\u2019s going to be a new guy coming in. I\u2019ll just work hard to stay ahead of that.\u201d\n\n11. Hoyer has already beaten out third-round pick Kevin O\u2019Connell, Matt Gutierrez and Zac Robinson, among others, and I think Hoyer has a little bit of Tom Brady\u2018s attitude in him. As in, Hoyer won\u2019t let someone come in and outwork him for his own job. If the Patriots used a high-round pick on a quarterback, it might turn into one of the most fun battles to watch in training camp.\n\n12. The general consensus insists the Panthers will take Cam Newton with the No. 1 pick, but there\u2019s as much uncertainty this close to the draft as there has been in recent memory. One major contributor to the guess work: The Panthers can\u2019t negotiate with their potential picks, which has become a common tactic for teams that want to make sure they don\u2019t take a guy who could hold out.\n\n13. Vince Wilfork surprisingly mentioned Tuesday that he could get used to retirement. Though his 2011 season won\u2019t be in jeopardy, Wilfork did sound sincere with his explanation. He said he\u2019s been blessed with good health and doesn\u2019t want to wind up like the many players who live in pain after their careers. Wilfork is a very strong family man who lost both of his parents at a young age, so I really believe that he values a high quality of life after his career.\n\n14. In an unrelated note, Wilfork was asked if he thought the labor negotiations could affect the relationships between players and owners when the work stoppage comes to a conclusion. \u201cI hope no one holds a grudge against anyone,\u201d Wilfork said. \u201cWhen you resume, you\u2019re a team.\u201d\n\n15. Patriots left tackle Matt Light held a charity event Tuesday to benefit his foundation, which is geared toward helping young kids reach their potential through outdoor activities. He held a breakfast at the Liberty Hotel in Boston to teach fans about the intricacies of the lockout and labor negotiations.\n\n\u201cReally, the only reason that we do this is to raise money for the foundation, so the one thing I don\u2019t want to lose sight of is we do some amazing things with the kids in our programs,\u201d Light said. \u201cI\u2019ve been very proud of all the people that have supported us and the people that represent us in this room.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real treat for me to be a part of it, to have fun seeing our programs grow and see the work that we do all unfold in front of me. From my heart, this means a lot to me.\u201d\n\n16. The trials and tribulations of the league\u2019s quest for an 18-game regular season have been a very popular storyline for at least a year. Light thinks the 18-game proposal is off the table at this point, and Wilfork said, \u201cI haven\u2019t met one player that has vouched for it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n17. Of course, the players don\u2019t want 18 games, but everything I\u2019ve heard \u2014 which includes comments from a player representative \u2014 suggests the players would accept the 18-game proposal if the owners conceded to prorated salary hikes and increased health benefits and pension plans. The owners have shown very little willingness to work with those demands.\n\n18. Wilfork touched on the change in draft philosophy during this unique offseason, but he is excited about the Patriots\u2019 prospects. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be kind of different this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always gone with the best player available in the past, but with this year and free agency all screwed up, we\u2019ve got to draft on needs. We need somebody who will be able to come in and help us right away. With that being said, there are a couple things I think that can help us as a ball club, especially as a defense. There\u2019s a couple positions that I think we can go and attack and get to in the draft. With us having two picks in the first and another two in the second, I think we\u2019ll have a real good draft class. I think we\u2019ll do real well in the draft.\u201d\n\n19. It was an interesting experience while writing my \u201cTales From the Broke\u201d feature, hearing about the stories of players who made poor financial decisions and lost loads of money as a result. By the way, could you imagine being an unemployed 20-something who walks into a bank and lands a $500,000 line of credit? Amazing stuff.\n\n20. One note I didn\u2019t use in the feature: I asked an agent if he was concerned that the lockout might prevent his clients from attending the rookie symposium, where they learn about life in the NFL and these financial horror stories. Let\u2019s just say I got a very, very passionate \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, that\u2019s not even a thought in my mind,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI speak to my clients every single day. They\u2019re going to learn a whole lot more from me than they\u2019ll learn from anything at a conference. Honestly, out of everything I\u2019m worried about, that\u2019s reason No. 476.\u201d\n\nMore Stories\n\n\u00a9 2016 NESN",

        "text":"SEC teams with the best BCS title paths\n\nThis marks the final year of the BCS, and you better believe the SEC would love to close the BCS era with eight straight titles. It would also ensure that the league has even more momentum going into the playoff, which starts during the 2014 season.\n\nColleague Travis Haney took a look at which conference has the best playoff path starting next year. He makes a pretty good case for the SEC, which should be able to get its conference champion in every year.\n\nBut who can wait for 2014 title talk? Yeah, me either, so why not take a look at SEC teams with the best BCS title paths in 2013? Spring practice begins this month, so we might as well throw out some very, very early thoughts on teams' championship hopes.\n\nLet's take a look at which SEC teams have real BCS title shots in 2013:\n\n\nPros: The Crimson Tide still have Nick Saban. That should be reason enough to make Alabama the odds on favorite to win its third straight national championship and fourth in five years. But there are many other reasons why Alabama tops our list. The offensive line might have to be rebuilt, but Alabama returns the nation's most efficient quarterback in AJ McCarron, who could have easily opted for the NFL after his junior year, a beast at running back in rising sophomore T.J. Yeldon, a host of talent -- and explosiveness -- at wide receiver, and most of the pieces to last year's top-ranked defense. Some big names have to be replaced on both sides, but this team really is reloading in 2013. Also, if the Tide can escape Virginia Tech (in Atlanta) and Texas A&M (in College Station) early, Alabama could go through the year unscathed, with road games coming against Kentucky, Mississippi State and Auburn.\n\nCons: Forget the pressure. Saban doesn't allow pressure to eat at his players. What Alabama has to do is replace three studs on that offensive line. Barrett Jones, Chance Warmack and D.J. Fluker are all gone. Winning the battle in the trenches is essential to competing in the SEC, so Alabama's less experienced linemen have to grow up in a hurry. Also, no team can do it three times in a row, right?\n\n\nPros: Johnny Manziel is back and last year proved that the Aggies are tough enough to compete in the big, bad SEC. Kliff Kingsbury might not be calling the plays anymore, but there is a lot of young talent on offense, including wide receiver Mike Evans and running backs Brandon Williams and Trey Williams, that should still give SEC defenses fits. A&M gets Alabama at home in Week 3 and trade Florida for Vanderbilt.\n\nCons: The Aggies lost a lot from their 2012 team. Left tackle Luke Joeckel is gone, along with receivers Ryan Swope and Uzoma Nwachukwu, who combined for 98 catches for 1,398 yards and 15 touchdowns. The front seven has a lot to replace, including All-American defensive end Damontre Moore and linebackers Jonathan Stewart and Sean Porter. Kingsbury's sideline work with Manziel will be missed, and the Aggies have to play LSU, Ole Miss and Arkansas on the road.\n\n\nPros: Georgia will be down wide receiver Tavarres King on offense, but it shouldn't be too hard to find someone to help make up for the loss of his production with all those talented receivers. \"Gurshall\" returns and so does quarterback Aaron Murray, who could become the first SEC quarterback to throw for 3,000 yards in each of his four years on campus. Bringing back the entire starting five on offense will also keep this offense trending upward.\n\nCons: The Bulldogs lost 12 players who either started or saw significant time on defense. Jarvis Jones, Alec Ogletree and Bacarri Rambo are just a few of the big names that are gone. There certainly is talent remaining, but replacing all those players would be tough for anyone. Also, look at that schedule. The Dawgs start the year with Clemson, South Carolina and LSU before September even arrives. Losing more than one game during that stretch could all but end Georgia's title hopes.\n\n\nPros: The Gators lost some key players on defense, but coach Will Muschamp is bringing back a host of defensive talent that should do just fine in 2013. Marcus Roberson could be an All-SEC performer at cornerback, and incoming freshman Vernon Hargreaves III has the talent to start opposite him immediately. Ronald Powell returns to help out a young but very talented front seven that includes rising sophomores Dante Fowler Jr. and Jonathan Bullard. Also, the Gators should be very deep at running back and have a more complete offensive line in 2013.\n\nCons: No one is quite sure what to make of that offense. Sure, the Gators should be able to run the ball, even without workhorse Mike Gillislee, but what about throwing it? Jeff Driskel really struggled last year, and the Gators lost their best receiving option in tight end Jordan Reed. Florida will have to rely on five true freshmen to help at receiver, but Driskel has to increase his confidence and become a better presense in the huddle for this offense to improve at all. Florida also takes on Miami, LSU and South Carolina on the road.\n\n\nPros: The Gamecocks might be without Marcus Lattimore and Ace Sanders, but they should be very balanced on offense in 2013. South Carolina has two very capable quarterbacks to work with in Connor Shaw and Dylan Thompson, a talented group of running backs returning, led by rising sophomore Mike Davis, and more experience at receiver. One-man wrecking crew Jadeveon Clowney is back, and could be a legit Heisman candidate. South Carolina also spends the final month of the season at home.\n\nCons: Replacing Sanders will be tough because he did so much on offense and special teams. Clowney will have help up front, but South Carolina must replace its two-deep at linebacker. That's going to be quite the chore. Also, stud safety D.J. Swearinger, Spur DeVonte Holloman and cornerback Akeem Auguste all have to be replaced. Right now, this staff will have to rely on a handful of youngsters to help out this spring. The Gamecocks must also go to Georgia, Tennessee and Arkansas.\n\n\nPros: The offense has to be more well-rounded in 2013. Cam Cameron is in at offensive coordinator, and quarterback Zach Mettenberger made major strides during the last month of the season. All of his receiving weapons are back, the offensive line should be better and there is a wealth of talent still at running back. The Tigers also get Florida, Texas A&M and Arkansas at home.\n\nCons: The defense was gutted after the 2012 season. The defensive line has to be rebuilt, someone has to step in for Kevin Minter at middle linebacker and the secondary must fill in the holes left by Eric Reid and Tharold Simon. There is a lot of young talent on defense, but guys have to grow up quickly in Baton Rouge this year. Playing Alabama and Georgia on the road will be very tough as well.",

        "text":"Rudiger - hit or miss? How Chelsea's most expensive signings have fared\n\n\nChelsea have made their first major signing of the transfer window, signing centre-back Antonio Rudiger in a \u00a331million deal from Roma.\n\nThe fee sees the Germany international become the seventh most expensive signing in the club's history\u00a0and marks the highest fee they have paid for a defender.\u00a0But how have the six players who\u00a0cost more than him fared?\n\nTheir big-money acquisitions have not always gone to plan, so\u00a0here we take a look at the hits and misses among\u00a0their six costliest players.\n\n\n1. Fernando Torres (\u00a350m) - MISS\n\nChelsea's club-record swoop for Torres in January 2011 provoked anger on Merseyside, but Liverpool\u00a0never really missed him as the Spaniard failed to fire in his four-year spell at Stamford Bridge. Although he scored a pivotal goal in a Champions League semi-final triumph over Barcelona, Torres\u00a0found the net just 48 times in all competitions over three seasons, eventually leaving for AC Milan and then Atletico Madrid.\n\n2. Andriy Shevchenko (\u00a337m) - MISS\n\nA goal machine and Champions League winner with\u00a0AC Milan, Ukraine legend Andriy Shevchenko never hit the heights he reached in Serie A following his 2006 switch. Shevchenko looked a shadow of himself at Stamford Bridge and scored just 22 goals in 77 games, going back to Milan on loan before ending his career with Dynamo Kiev.\n\n3. Michy Batshuayi (\u00a333m) - MISS\n\nSo far, it is fair to say former Marseille hitman Michy Batshuayi's Chelsea career has not been what he hoped. Very much second fiddle to Diego Costa, Batshuayi's game time was limited last season, although he did score the goal that clinched the Premier League title at West Brom.\n\n4. Didier Drogba (\u00a333m) - HIT\n\nThis ex-Marseille striker absolutely lived up to the billing. A fearsome presence in the box with a flair for the spectacular, Drogba helped Chelsea to four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and converted the winning penalty in the shoot-out as they beat Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final, furthering his legendary status at the club.\n\n5. Michael Essien (\u00a332m) - HIT\n\nMichael Essien's arrival at Chelsea in 2005 brought about the end of a three-month-long transfer saga, but he proved worth the wait. His energy and physicality in midfield proved invaluable to Chelsea, the Ghanaian winning the Premier League twice and the Champions League once in a decorated nine-year spell.\n\n6. Diego Costa (\u00a332m) - HIT\n\nBooed by Chelsea fans as he knocked them out of the Champions League in 2014, Costa has become a hero at Stamford Bridge since making the switch later that year. His goals have fired them to two Premier League titles, but his difficult relationship with Antonio Conte could spell the end of his time at the club.",

        "text":"Projecting 10 Players Who Will Shock Scouts at the 2014 NFL Combine\n\nAlex SimsCorrespondent IIIFebruary 20, 2014\n\nProjecting 10 Players Who Will Shock Scouts at the 2014 NFL Combine\n\n0 of 10\n\n    Kevin C. Cox\/Getty Images\n\n    The NFL Scouting Combine, a widely covered and televised event where former college football stars just run drills, might seem like a silly practice, but the NFL Network broadcasts it for a reason.\n\n    Watching some of the greatest athletes in the world show off their abilities will be entertaining as always.\n\n    This year's class features a great crop of speedy playmakers like Brandin Cooks and De'Anthony Thomas who will have scouts looking at their stopwatches with wide eyes.\n\n    Additionally, the defensive class will boast remarkable physical prospects like Jadeveon Clowney and Khalil Mack, who will jump off the page just as they do in the film room.\n\n    Click to see 10 athletes to keep a close eye on in this weekend's (Feb. 22-25) NFL combine.\n\nWR Brandin Cooks, Oregon State\n\n1 of 10\n\n    Cooks had an unbelievable junior season for Oregon State.\n\n    The Lincoln High product won the Biletnikoff Award after tallying 1,730 yards and 16 touchdowns and wisely bolted for the NFL.\n\n    His production and skill set is similar to that of former West Virginia star Tavon Austin, who stunned scouts with a lightning fast 40 time, even after a great collegiate career.\n\n    Cooks will post a time close to Austin's 4.28-second 40-yard dash. He might not vault as high in the draft as Austin did, but he'll have a very impressive resume.\n\nDE Jadeveon Clowney, South Carolina\n\n2 of 10\n\n    Clowney said at SEC media days before the 2013 season that he ran a 4.46-second 40-yard dash.\n\n    When scouts actually see him running a time near that, it'll be shock-inducing.\u00a0\n\n    Also expect Clowney to run some incredibly impressive agility times at 6'6\", 274 pounds.\n\n    Clowney already looks incredible on film, and he'll add the paper resume to back that up, solidifying his place as one of the best players available in the draft.\n\nRB De'Anthony Thomas, Oregon\n\n3 of 10\n\n    Rick Scuteri\/Associated Press\n\n    For some reason, Thomas wears a watch while playing football.\u00a0Perhaps he does so to reiterate just how fast he is.\n\n    At the combine, he'll have scouts checking their watches as he runs incredibly fast times.\n\n    Thomas has elite speed, and he could flirt with the combine record 4.24-second 40 set by Chris Johnson.\u00a0\n\n    At Oregon, he anchored the Ducks' 4x100-meter relay team that qualified for the NCAA Championships. He also ran a 10.57-second 100-meter dash in high school.\n\nDT Caraun Reid, Princeton\n\n4 of 10\n\n    Few players have seen their draft stock rise as much in recent months as Princeton standout Caraun Reid.\n\n    Reid, named the FCS Defensive Player of the Year, earned a Senior Bowl invite and shined in that game\u2014a perfect preamble to what could be a great combine.\n\n    At 6'2\", 305 pounds, Reid has the size to succeed at the next level, and he'll approach the combine hoping to show that he has the athleticism too.\n\n    It takes a lot for small-school prospects to impress scouts, but Reid will make that happen.\n\n\nWR Robert Herron, Wyoming\n\n5 of 10\n\n    Troy Babbitt-USA TODAY Sports\n\n    Wyoming's Robert Herron will add his name to a wide receiver class that is already pretty crowded at the combine.\n\n    In a tumultuous season for the Cowboys, Herron shined as he caught 72 passes for 937 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\n    Herron is looking to add a great 40 time to his resume, perhaps in the 4.3 range, according to's Mike Huguenin.\n\n    If he does that, he'll solidify himself as having legitimate deep-threat potential.\n\nDE Dee Ford, Auburn\n\n6 of 10\n\n    Dee Ford was a part of Auburn's national title run in 2010 and stuck around for last year's surprising SEC title season as well.\n\n    At the end of a great college career, he's ready to stun scouts at the combine on his way to the pros, per Brandon Marcello,\n\n    \"I'm not nervous at all,\" Ford said Tuesday on the NFL Network. \"I'm prepared, I already know I'm trying to go there and shock the world. That's something I've been preparing for, for a long time. I feel like if you're not prepared then you're nervous, but I'm prepared.\"\n\n    At 6'2\", 240 pounds, Ford will be one of the most athletic defensive linemen at the combine.\n\n    While he's stacked up next to 300-pound tackles, Ford will stand out in Indianapolis.\n\nRB Charles Sims, West Virginia\n\n7 of 10\n\n    Former Houston running back Charles Sims elected to head to the Big 12 and spend his senior season at West Virginia.\n\n    The Mountaineers struggled on the field, but Sims was one of the bright spots leading the conference with 1,496 yards from scrimmage.\n\n    He showed some great versatility and athleticism, as well as speed and quickness in his 6'0\", 213-pound frame.'s Bucky Brooks envisions Sims as a Matt Forte-type back at the next level:\n\n    Studying Sims' game throughout the fall, I envision him having a\u00a0Matt Forte-like impact in the pro game. He has the ability to churn out 100-yard rushing games, but crafty offensive coordinators will take advantage of his versatile skills to make him a dynamic backfield weapon capable of tallying 100-plus scrimmage yards (combination of rushing and receiving yards) on a weekly basis.\n\n    Expect Sims to turn in solid drill times, as well as impressive jump numbers, showcasing that he will be just as dangerous catching the football as taking handoffs in the NFL.\n\nCB Bradley Roby, Ohio State\n\n8 of 10\n\n    Jay LaPrete\/Associated Press\n\n    Bradley Roby will be one of the most-watched prospects at the combine this year.\n\n    The Ohio State standout struggled through a tumultuous redshirt junior season and saw his draft stock slip after slip ups both on and off the field, as well as some injury trouble that kept him sidelined for the Orange Bowl.\n\n    He still has as high a ceiling as any corner in this draft, and he'll have the opportunity to show why in Indy. As detailed by Bill Rabinowitz of The Columbus Dispatchhe has the athleticism to do just that:\n\n    Roby said he is healthy now and intends to participate fully at the combine. He is considered a borderline first-round pick, but he could improve his stock with a strong workout. Roby has run the 40-yard dash in 4.31 seconds at Ohio State and hopes to match or surpass that in Indianapolis.\n\n    With his speed, athleticism and willingness to sacrifice his lean frame in run support, Roby has all the tools to be a success in the NFL.\n\n    Roby might end up as the fastest corner in this year's class.\n\nLB Khalil Mack, Buffalo\n\n9 of 10\n\n    Most college and pro football fans know Mack by now.\n\n    He's the linebacker for the MAC's Buffalo Bulls who could've been starting for the NFL's Buffalo Bills.\n\n    Mack is fresh off an insane season, where he tallied 100 tackles, 19 tackles for a loss, 10.5 sacks, three interceptions, seven pass breakups, five forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries.\n\n    One of the more intriguing prospects in the draft, Mack will likely go in the top 10, if not the top five in May. Some are even suggesting \u00a0he could end up as the No. 1 overall pick, hinted by Rob Rang of CBS Sports.\n\n    If he does make that jump, it'll be because he has a great combine. At 6'3\", 248 pounds, he has the ideal size. If he shows that he has the speed to go along at the combine, he could be too good to pass up on draft day.\n\nDT Ra'Shede Hageman, Minnesota\n\n10 of 10\n\n    Fans in Minneapolis could've been witnessing the next great physical freak along the defensive line last season.\n\n    Ra'Shede Hageman was named first-team All-Big Ten for Minnesota last year and at 6'6\", 318 pounds, he certainly looks the part of a professional defensive lineman.\n\n    At the combine, he could turn in some ridiculous numbers. In early February, Tyler Dunne of the\u00a0Journal Sentinel\u00a0credited Gophers defensive line detailing Hageman's insane speed and leaping ability:\n\n    At the NFL scouting combine, Hageman might put on a show.\n\n    \u201cHe\u2019s a very aggressive human being,\u201d Gophers defensive line coach\u00a0Jeff Phelps\u00a0said. \u201cHe\u2019s really a freak of nature. He\u2019s every bit 6-6, 300-plus pounds and really can run like a deer. He does some things that are unbelievable and I think he\u2019ll really wow some people at the combine.\u201d\n\n    Phelps adds that Hageman has a 36-inch vertical jump and can effectively pull off a 360-dunk on the basketball court.\n\n    A 6'6\", 318-pound man throwing down a 360 jam is a scary thought.",

        "text":"Atlanta Braves, New York Mets\n\nBraves: 3 moves to make to answer Mets\u2019 Francisco Lindor mega-trade\n\nMark Melancon, Atlanta Braves\n\nMark Melancon, Atlanta Braves. (Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have to respond to the New York Mets trading for Francisco Lindor.\n\nThough the Atlanta Braves are the favorites to win the NL East for the fourth year in a row, they will be pushed by the New York Mets, who just orchestrated a blockbuster trade with the Cleveland Indians, bringing shortstop Franciso Lindor to Queens.\n\nThe Braves and Mets have had one of the most heated rivalries in the National League since the late 1990s. Though Atlanta and New York have had their down cycles as organizations, the bitterness between these two teams and fanbases is never lost on anyone. Atlanta has to do a few things this offseason to prevent New York from possibly overtaking the Braves in 2021.\n\n3 moves Braves must do to respond to the Francisco Lindor trade\n\n3. Revamp depleted bullpen, so that it remains a team strength\n\nThough Braves Country anticipates it will get better with time, the starting rotation remains the club\u2019s biggest weakness heading into next season. While Max Fried was dominant all season long and Ian Anderson came alive in the postseason, manager Brian Snitker needs them to improve in 2021, as well as ace Mike Soroka to come back healthy after rupturing his Achilles this summer.\n\nAdding veterans Charlie Morton and Drew Smyly will likely be better than last offseason\u2019s additions of Cole Hamels and Felix Hernandez because anything will be an improvement over those two. But what this really comes down to is for general manager Alex Anthopoulos to revitalize that strong bullpen that kept the Braves in so many games the last two seasons.\n\nAnthopoulos rebuilt it on the fly two summers ago, as he traded for Shane Greene, Mark Melancon and Cody Martin ahead of the trade deadline. Though none of those guys are spring chickens, bringing Greene and Melancon back on short-term deals could be advantageous for Atlanta heading into 2021. Other guys will have to step up, but they were tone-setters in 2020.\n\nWhile guys like Tyler Matzek and A.J. Minter had outstanding seasons, adding Newnan native Will Smith was not as good. Though the Braves bullpen may not be as dominant as it was a year ago, the hope is for the starting rotation to improve enough to counterbalance any potential decline the bullpen could experience. Then again, a leaky bullpen is the bane of everyone\u2019s existence.\n\nArticles You May Like\n\nMichael Brantley reportedly spurns Blue Jays to sign with Astros\nDodgers Hall-of-Famer Don Sutton passes away at 75\nCould Curt Schilling\u2019s political beliefs cost him the Hall of Fame?\nJeff Passan savages so-called \u201creports\u201d of Luis Castillo-Yankees trade\nPhillies make desperate attempt to boost bullpen by signing Archie Bradley\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"2013 fantasy football best and worst\n\nNo surprise, Peyton Manning was the leading fantasy football scorer in 2013.\n\nMark J. Rebilas\/Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt\u2019s with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to the 2013 fantasy football season.\n\nBefore we fade to black, we must honor those top players that provided the most bang for the draft-day buck this year. Below are the best and worst fantasy football performers based on average draft position.\n\n\nBest: Andy Dalton\n\nADP: 12th Round\n\nFinished: QB3 in points scored\n\nRecap:\u00a0 Over 51 percent of his fantasy points scored came in five of his 16 starts this season.\u00a0 He threw 11 touchdowns with four interceptions (all in Week 17) over his last five games.\u00a0 Dalton was ranked QB9 in fantasy points scored during Weeks 9 \u2013 17.\n\nWorst: Tom Brady\n\nADP: 3rd Round\n\nFinished: QB13\n\nRecap:\u00a0 Brady\u2019s 25 touchdown passes were the fewest he\u2019s thrown in a 16-game season since 2006.\u00a0 His 60.5 completion percentage was his worst since 2003.\u00a0 He passed for less than 200 yards five times.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t help that his receiving corps was as green as they come and only had Gronk in the lineup for basically six games.\n\nRunning Backs\n\nBest: Knowshon Moreno\n\nADP: 15th Round\n\nFinished: RB5\n\nRecap:\u00a0 Although he did most of his damage in the first half of the season (eight touchdowns by October 20), Moreno did post the best stats of his career with 1,038 rushing and 548 receiving yards with 13 total scores and no lost fumbles.\n\nAfter his career high 37 carries in one game, Moreno and Montee Ball split the workload.\u00a0 So much so that the starter didn\u2019t receive more than 15 carries in the five games that followed.\n\nWorst: C.J. Spiller and Ray Rice\n\nADP: 1st Round\n\nFinished: RB27 and RB28\n\nRecap:\u00a0 Spiller and Rice were so consistently subpar, their fantasy RB ranking, based on total points scored, the second half of the season was RB26 and RB33, respectively.\n\nRay Rice finished with four touchdowns.\u00a0 His last score came on November 17.\u00a0 Spiller\u2019s two scores came two months apart at the beginning of October and December.\n\n\"We are going to give him the ball until he throws up. So he has to either throw up or tap out on the field.\" \u2013 Nathaniel Hackett on C.J. Spiller in the New York Daily News \u2013 August 16, 2013\n\nWide Receivers\n\nBest: Josh Gordon and Alshon Jeffery\n\nADP: 12th and 15th Rounds\n\nFinished: WR1 and WR8\n\nRecap:\u00a0 In eight of the Browns\u2018 last nine games, Gordon was targeted 10 or more times.\u00a0 He spent the month of November and first day of December breaking franchise and league records with 237 and 261 receiving yards in back-to-back games.\u00a0 His nine touchdowns are the most by a Browns\u2019 receiver in one season since Braylon Edwards in 2007 (16 TD).\n\nIn a much more crowded passing game, Jeffery managed to outgain Brandon Marshall by 126 receiving yards on 11 fewer receptions (89).\u00a0 Jeffery\u2019s 16 yards per catch were 10th-best in the NFL this season.\u00a0 He scored four touchdowns the last month of the season.\n\nWorst: Roddy White and Hakeem Nicks\n\nADP:\u00a0 4th and 6th Rounds\n\nFinished:\u00a0 WR55 and WR52\n\nRecap:\u00a0 Granted, White missed three games this season, but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more depressing, the fact that White failed to reach 1,000 receiving yards in a season for the first time since 2006 or that Nicks, who only missed one game, failed to score a touchdown in a contract year.\n\nThanks to a strong effort the last two weeks of the season (35.2 FP), White finished the second half of the season ranked WR25, but Nicks failed to crack the Top 50.\u00a0\n\nTight Ends\n\nBest: Julius Thomas\n\nADP: 15th Round\n\nFinished: TE3\n\nRecap:\u00a0 Peyton Manning does like to spread the wealth around the Broncos\u2018 receiving corps, but 2013 proved once again he still loves to target the tight end.\u00a0 During his time with the Colts, tight end Dallas Clark posted two double-digit touchdown campaigns in 2007 (11 TD) and 2009 (10 TD), but Thomas managed to scored 12 times on only 89 targets.\u00a0 So, 13.5 percent of the time Manning threw the ball in Thomas\u2019 direction, the play resulted in a touchdown.\n\nSecond Half Heroes\n\nI also want to pay homage to those fantasy football players who stepped up their game during the second half of the season.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of the players\u2019 fantasy football rank at their position and fantasy points scored Weeks 9 \u2013 17.\n\n\nQB2 \u2013 Nick Foles (244 FP \u2013 only one point behind Peyton Manning)\n\nQB4 \u2013 Ben Roethlisberger (206 FP)\n\nRunning Backs\n\nRB5 \u2013 Chris Johnson (132.9 FP)\n\nRB10 \u2013 Rashad Jennings (114.8 FP)\n\nWide Receivers\n\nWR14 \u2013 Cordarrelle Patterson (91.2 FP)\n\nWR24 \u2013 Jerricho Cotchery (75.9 FP)\n\nTight Ends\n\nTE9 \u2013 Marcedes Lewis (56.2 FP)\n\nTE11 (tie) \u2013 Brent Celek and Zach Ertz (50.8 FP)\n\nTE22 \u2013 Jordan Cameron (38.1 FP)\n\nFOX Fantasy Baseball Join or Create a Free League\nPlay Now!",

On the flip side there are scenarios for the list of teams mathematically eliminated from the playoffs to increase.\n\nThis week\u2019s 32 Observations will also look ahead to 32 players who could potentially be free agents in this upcoming offseason, along with some interesting tidbit about them.\n\n\nAFC East\n\nBuffalo Bills: Receiving tight end Scott Chandler has a Yards Per Route Run of 1.23, which is the lowest among tight ends with at least 400 routes run.\n\nMiami Dolphins: Defensive tackle Randy Starks is the only tackle to rank in the Top 6 in both Run Stop Percentage and Pass Rushing Productivity.

        "text":"5 Secrets to Be a Yogi\n\nThere are 5 secrets of Yoga \u2013 once you know these secrets, you can start your Yoga journey and become a Yogi or a Yogini. You will be able to unlock the infinite potential in you. You will get unseen treasures buried deep in yourself. These secrets and truths, if you do not know them, Yoga will become a cobweb of techniques. You will get stuck there with no progress. So, you must know these hidden truths.\n\nSecret No. 1: No progress in Yoga can be made without purification of nerves\u00a0\n\nMany people claim \u2013 \u201cYoga is not effective. What Yoga says aren\u2019t true and Yoga just gives a bit of flexibility \u2013 that\u2019s it, and nothing more.\u201d Actually, these people aren\u2019t wrong, they\u2019re right. You cannot reach the Himalayals if you start walking in opposite direction. And even if you reach, as earth is round, it\u2019s going to take a lot of time. Similarly, no progress in Yoga can be made in right direction, if you do not purify your nerves using the method of Nadi Shodhana. Nadi Shodhana purifies the nerves in your subtle body or Sukshma Sharira. These nerves are pathways or channels of Prana, the basic unit of energy. You should understand this \u2013 performing Yoga generates a lot of energy, but if these nerve pathways are blocked, this energy cannot reach at the right spots and, therefore, no benefit can be reaped. So, in order to unblock these energy channels, this technique of Nadi Shodhana is not only important, but necessary too. If you practice Nadi Shodhana twice a day for about 15 minutes, your nerve pathways will be unblocked in 3-4 months and then, you will be able to reap the immense benefits that Yoga has to offer. Your senses will become sharper and you will be healthier, and harshness of your voice will be reduced. Once it happens, you can ascertain that nerves in your subtle body are opening up. This is an open secret and if you do not know this secret, you cannot become a Yogi. In case, you do not know how to perform Nadi Shodhana, please watch my video on the same topic: Nadi Shodhana Yoga - Boost Your Brain Power.\n\nSecret No. 2: Yoga isn\u2019t gymnastics\u00a0\n\nYoga is not what most people think it is. It is NOT gymnastics. You can perhaps become a gymnast by getting into all sorts of weird poses, but you can never become a Yogi by doing all this. What some phony Gurus teach on the name of Yoga these days, that\u2019s crap. Vinnyasa is absolute crap. But, I don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s of no use. It might be a good exercise, but it is NOT Yoga. Whether you like it or you do not, but the truth is \u2013 Vinnyasa has nothing to do with Yoga. Yoga has been developed by those who were enlightened and groups of several such people worked over thousands of years one after another to come up with single Yoga technique. This is how Yoga developed. But, these days so called Gurus create their brand of Yoga without understanding it. They even do not know basics of Yoga. Unfortunately, Vinnyasa is one such bluff. If you want to get a good workout, it\u2019s fine. But if you think you\u2019re doing anything related to Yoga, it isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t even come under the limb of Asana as per Yoga. So, on the path to be a Yogi or Yogini, it\u2019s of no help. Do not get misled by all these so-called Yogas gurus. To tread the path of Yoga, you must practice \u201cYoga\u201d.\n\nSecret No. 3: Rhythmic breathing transforms you inside out\u00a0\n\nYou have immense potential, but it is yet to be explored. You have not tapped even a minuscule amount of your inner resources. Rhythmic breathing is the key that can help you unleash your hidden powers and lead you toward health, creativity, everlasting youth and self-realization. Breath is the bridge that connects body with mind. If you can breathe properly, you can control your body and mind. Our breathing is very haphazard. Yoga says \u2013 you should breath in a measured way, in and out. Join some mantra like Soham or Om while you breathe in and out. It\u2019ll make your breathing more harmonious. The more your practice, the calmer you become. You will become full of energy, you\u2019ll become healthy with a still mind and a healthy body, you will be prepared for advance techniques of Yoga to be a Yogi. If you want to know more about it, you can check out my blog-post on rhythmic breathing.\n\nSecret No. 4: Meditation is True Yoga\u00a0\n\nWhy to meditate, hmm? Do you want good health? Do you want a vibrant, yet peaceful mind? Do you want to be stress-free? Do you want to explore the realms of your consciousness, the unseen treasures that you possess, but you know not \u2013 meditation is the key.\n\nAs per Yoga, meditation is complete attention without any flickering. Meditation, if practiced properly, prolongs attention span and transforms the quality of perception. It sharpens your intellect and balances your emotions. There are several different methods of meditation, but their core is same. Be a witness to any object, inner or outer, in your consciousness. This object can be anything \u2013 a Mantra or Chakra or stream of thoughts. Just observe it by paying your full attention and do not force your mind at all. Just be aware of wandering mind. By and by, the quality of your consciousness will be transformed. By and by, more and more of your subconscious mind will come under conscious control. By and by, you will realize that you are beyond body and mind. By and by, you will get transformed into something, for which Vedas say \u2013 neti, neti \u2013 it cannot be described using language, beyond limitations. Meditation is yoga, yoga is meditation.\n\nSecret No. 5: Do it, do it, do it \u2013 this is the biggest secret\u00a0\n\nLast, but not the least \u2013 A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step \u2013 says Lao-tzu. Take that step and immerse in the ocean of Yoga to find peace, happiness, to find what can be found, to find you. It\u2019s the first step, also the ultimate \u2013 Do it, do it, do it!!! \u2013 arise, awake and stop not, till the goal is reached. Om!!!\n\nPS.

        "text":"Rivals\/VTO Georgia: Top story lines\n\nMORE: Rivals\/VTO page | Ga. D | Ga. O\nSunday's Sports Georgia Elite 100 in Marietta will feature many of the region's elite players. Coming into the event, here are five things Southeast analysts Keith Niebuhr and Chris Nee are excited to watch:\n1.Lawson the awesome\nCan anyone stop Rivals100 strongside defensive end Carl Lawson of Apharetta (Ga.) Milton? That is easier said than done. In December, the 6-foot-3, 245-pound standout was practically unblockable during practices leading up to the Rising Seniors Georgia Junior Bowl. Before the event, he was without an offer. Now, he has several, and they've come from many of the country's elite programs. Lawson is extremely explosive off the ball, and combines that quickness with tremendous strength (he bench presses around 450 pounds). Will Lawson do enough to boost his ranking? And will any offensive lineman give him a battle?\n2. Young guns\nThe group from the class of 2014 expected on hand is nothing short of sensational. Tyrone (Ga.) Sandy Creek receiver Demarre Kitt has already collected double-digit offers and is looking forward to competing against some of the top cornerbacks from the 2013 and 2014 classes. Defensive backs Nick Glass and Nicholas Ruffin, teammates at Atlanta St. Pius, are two of the country's most coveted sophomores. Offensive tackle Orlando Brown of Duluth (Ga.) Peachtree Ridge, whose father was a standout in the NFL, is 6-10, 360 pounds and already has double-digit offers. And don't forget about Georgia running back commit Stanley Williams of Bethlehem (Ga.) George Walton Academy. The ultra-talented Williams is one of the Peach State's fastest - and most exciting - players. Look for other top sophomores to emerge Sunday.\n3. Getting defensive in the secondary\nImage unavailable osqizb\nClick Here to view this Link.\nSimply put, there will be an enormous amount of talent in the defensive backfield. And you can bet those competing in this group will want to leave their mark and show the other players what kind of skills they have. Besides Glass and Ruffin, two other headliners coming in are Rivals250 prospect Jalen Ramsey of Brentwood (Tenn.) Academy and Marietta (Ga.) Kell's Brendan Langley. Ramsey, a cornerback who claims 20 offers with Ohio State being among the most recent, is coming off an outstanding performance at a Nike Combine a few weeks ago in Atlanta. Langley holds nine SEC offers and is a big and athletic corner. Some of the other notable defensive backs include Shon Akins of Norcross (Ga.), Trevellous Cheek of Lawrenceville (Ga.) Archer, Ali Groves of Stone Mountain (Ga.) Stephenson, Noel Padmore of Flowery Branch (Ga.) and Demetrius Monday of Fairburn (Ga.) Arlington Christian School. It also wouldn't be a shock if a few more big names show up.\n4. Better to receive\nThe DBs are strong, but the group of receivers expected isn't too shabby either. Four-star prospect Carlos Burse of Alpharetta (Ga.) will be worth watching closely. He possesses excellent size, good speed and a very solid set of hands. That's why schools such as Florida, Tennessee, Vanderbilt and Virginia Tech have offered. Kitt, who might be the best 2014 receiver in Georgia, is another standout. When he is on his game, Kitt stands out against the best of the best. Ryan Jenkins of Alpharetta (Ga.) Milton, Tyree Harris of Marietta (Ga.), Myles Campbell of Duluth (Ga.) and Darian Horn Jr. of Suwanee (Ga.) Peachtree Ridge are among the other receivers expected who likely will end up playing at the Division I level. Will Burse and\/or Kitt be the class of the group or will someone else emerge and steal the show? This group will be tested thoroughly by the defensive backs, and that should make for some exciting moments during the one-on-ones.\n5. The back attack\nRunning back is another position that will offer up truly outstanding talent. Junior Alvin Kamara of Norcross (Ga.) is a four-star prospect that is being heavily pursued by several major programs. He gained a good bit of notoriety recently when he received 105 letters in the mail on the same day from Alabama. Travis Custis of Hampton (Ga.) Lovejoy is another very good back, even though he doesn't receive as much publicity as some of the other players at his position in Georgia. Custis, who holds offers from programs such as Georgia Tech and Miami, is coming off a monster junior season. And, of course, you can't forget about the aforementioned Williams, the Georgia commit. Chaz Thornton of Toccoa (Ga.) Stephens County is another player to watch. While he is lacking offers, his film is impressive, and his speed and explosiveness should make him fun to watch in this type of setting. As is often the case, other less-heralded running backs are likely to emerge.\nImage unavailable osqizb\nClick Here to view this Link.",

Man, what a machine this guy is. - USA TODAY Sports\n\nOle Miss was the talk of college football this week, something we'll hope to cover in today's news and notes.\n\nOle Miss Rebels coach Hugh Freeze doesn't to hear about rumors without facts | ESPN\n\"TEH T$UN BARE$ I$ \u00a2H\u20acATIN\" allegations have been as intense as ever after Hugh Freeze and staff signed a consensus top-10 recruiting class this past Wednesday. That has, in no way, deterred the Rebel coaching staff, as they have both openly bristled at and replied to such criticism.\n\nHow Hugh Freeze signed Ole Miss' historic recruiting class | Andy Staples -\nIf you read one thing about Ole Miss' recent recruiting successes, make this be it. Truly an enjoyable read from Sports Illustrated's Andy Staples on the Ole Miss coaching staff and their approach to recruiting.\n\nNational Signing Day Winners | 247Sports\nWe're the biggest winners, even without Elijah Daniel and Chris Jones. Take that, everyone else.\n\nChris Kiffin Named 2013 Recruiter Of The Year |\nAfter helping Ole Miss haul in a consensus top-10 recruiting class that included several of the nation's top prospects, Rebel assistant coach Chris Kiffin was named the 2013 Recruiter of the Year by Nkemdiche and Tunsil were his primary responsibilities as a recruiter, so I'd say he sealed the deal there pretty well.\n\nRyan Buchanan: The Most Frat Quarterback In Ole Miss History?\nIt's a fanpost that I'm not going to put on the cover, but I do encourage you to read it anyway because, really, Ryan Buchanan is the most Ole Missish recruit in recent history. His first name is Ryan, he is a senior at Jackson Prep, and just look at his haircut. He's a four star quarterback and a five star fratter.\n\nOh boy, this is awkward.\nI wonder what they were thinking during this moment.\n\nOle Miss still in good spot despite last week's losses to UK and UF |\nGary Parrish is an advocate for both Andy Kennedy and Marshall Henderson. I mostly agree with his premise too. In spite of last week's losses to Kentucky and Florida, this team does control its own destiny. After beating a myriad of bodily fluids out of State this past Wednesday (Get this: signing day was so captivating that we almost forgot that our nationally ranked basketball team listlessly walloped Schtuyte in the Tad Pad that night.), the Rebels have a daunting road trip to Mizzou before a slew of winnable games to close out the regular season. Currently at 7-2 in the league, this team could very well finish with fewer than five conference losses, which would assuredly have them in the dance... right?\n\nLog In Sign Up\n\nLog In Sign Up\n\nForgot password?\n\nWe'll email you a reset link.\n\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\n\nForgot password?\n\nTry another email?\n\nAlmost done,\n\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that you have read our Privacy Policy.\n\nJoin Red Cup Rebellion\n\nYou must be a member of Red Cup Rebellion to participate.\n\nWe have our own Community Guidelines at Red Cup Rebellion.
