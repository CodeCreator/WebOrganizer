A As he eyed the vast array of his once-prized mane glimmering under the neon kitchen light, Greg felt his buzzed pate. Slowly, his hand moved over the entire surface of his scalp, confirming what he already knew to be true. It was all gone! A smile crept, hesitatingly, across his lips. He\u2019d been buzzed down to the nubs, one hundred percent! And to think, only minutes before, when he\u2019d been ushered into the kitchen and invited to take a seat in the makeshift barbershop, his treasured locks had dangled to his shoulders. Thick, full of body, healthy, shimmering, to die-for hair! And now, it laid in lifeless, discarded clumps all around him. His longhaired, bohemian look was a thing of the past; a very streamlined, traditional butch cut was the new Greg.\n\nMatt looked positively triumphant as he stood over the stunned and amazed Greg, clippers still in hand. The dazed fellow looked so different, shorn of the pretty-boy hair. The transformation had been nothing short of a work of art, one that had been months in the preparation phase and minutes in the execution phase. \u201cWhat a sharp crewcut!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201c\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d came the hesitating, amused response. \u201c\u201cHow do I look?\u201d The smile told it all. Matt was convinced Greg did not need a mirror to confirm that he\u2019d made the right decision, submitting to the clippers. But he would satisfy the boy\u2019s curiosity. He reached for the small mirror that lay with his barbering tools and held it in front of Greg\u2019s face. The dazed fellow blinked in disbelief for a few instants before the slight smile blossomed to a fulsome grin.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s what I call the perfect summer haircut!\u201d the proud amateur barber pronounced. \u201cGoodbye to hours wasted on hair care,\u201d he said scooping up a mound of the shorn locks from the cape and dramatically dropping them to the floor. \u201cHello, simplicity!\u201d Matt rubbed his hand rigorously across the top of the clipped pate before unfastening the cape and shaking the whole collection of cut hair to the floor of the kitchen.\n\nGreg picked up the mirror and looked again \u2013 it was hard to recognize himself without his long hair. What would everyone say about his transformed look? Although his friends had often heard Matt taunt him publicly about the tyranny of long hair, Greg had never, ever suggested that he was at all responsive to the idea of a tight crewcut! In IIn fact, he was always adamant \u2013 playfully so, as Matt was a dear friend \u2013 that his long hair was part of his identity. And now it was all gone.\n\nMatt busied himself with a broom, sweeping the shorn locks up into a gigantic mound. \u201cGood riddance, eh, Greg?\u201d he said gaily as he brandished a dustpan brimming with shorn, black hair on its way to the wastebasket. \u201cAnd you can get rid of all your longhair paraphernalia too \u2013 the blow dryers, curling wands, conditioners, hair sprays, gels, mousses, scrunchies, head bands, etc. I\u2019 II\u2019m going to keep you tightly clipped for a good long while, my friend,\u201d he said brandishing the huge set of Oster hair clippers before putting it into the barbering kit.\n\nGreg thought back to when he realized Matt was interested in giving him a heavy-duty haircut. IIt was the first time he\u2019d joined the guys in their Monday evening basketball activities. The rest of the fellows were dressed and ready to hit the bar, but Greg was stuck with some tangles to comb out. The catcalls bounced back and forth from \u201cLet\u2019s just leave him,\u201d to \u201cHurry up, Greg!\u201d Then he heard Matt say, \u201cThe fastest way to get him to the bar is through the doors of a good, old-fashioned barbershop!\u201d There had been some high-spirited laughs followed by one of the fellows shouting, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get out here now, we\u2019re coming in there with a pair of scissors!\u201d\n\nAt the bar, later that evening, when Greg was making a selection at the jukebox, Matt had sort of cornered him and posed the question, \u201cSo what do you say? How about letting me give you a nice, tidy crewcut? I got a pair of clippers at home that will take this mane of your down nice and tight!\u201d\n\nThe suggestion had sent a chill down his spine, but Greg was able to laugh off the offer by flicking his head and sending the locks flying in the direction of the would-be barber. \u201cNo thanks, not tonight anyway! I\u2019m rather fond of my hair.\u201d That was an understatement. Greg would normally die for his beloved hair.\n\nThe next week after basketball, a second offer came from Matt, again at the bar. It was after many beers had been downed, that Matt slipped up behind Greg and suggested, \u201cWell, then what about letting me give you a nice trim. Nothing dramatic. Just the tips.\u201d Greg recalled the delicious feeling of Matt\u2019s fingers fondling and stroking his beautiful, long hair. \u201cJust the tips,\u201d he repeated as he fashioned his fingers into a pair of shears and gingerly snipped off a few imaginary split ends, \u201c in my kitchen.\u201d\n\nUnexpectedly, Greg found himself desperately wanting to say yes to Matt, to be led into his kitchen \u2013 caped and shorn (well, trimmed). But, he used every nerve in his body to suppress this urge to agree. There was the obvious, tantalizing fear -- once under the cape, Matt pulling out the clippers and administering his original offer\u2026a tight crewcut!!? So, Greg suppressed the soft moans of delight that Matt\u2019s fingers on his nape elicited and said with as little emotion as possible in his voice, \u201cI just had my hair trimmed. MMaybe some other time.\u201d It was the truth, after all. He\u2019d just plunked down $42 at the salon for his monthly styling.\n\nThat night, Greg found it hard to sleep. WWhy had he not agreed to Matt\u2019s trim? He was desperate to be caped by Matt and given a haircut. Even if Matt ended up chopping away at his hair, he didn\u2019t care. No crewcut, of course, but he would allow the shears to slice through his prized locks and send a few inches of his precious hair to the floor. Why not? It would be fun. And it would always grow back. Next time Matt offered, he would say yes. He would say, \u201cLet\u2019s go for it! How about right now?\u201d?\u201d And then Matt would lead him into the kitchen and out would come the haircutting kit and cape.\n\nBut strangely, no further offer from Matt was forthcoming. IIt seemed like the more Greg tried to steer the conversation to his hair and his need for a good trim, the less Matt responded. Greg even started talking about the need to get a real haircut. \u201cThis long hair is really becoming such a pain\u2026.\u201d said Greg, putting his locks on the line.\n\nThen, one night, exactly six months after he first learned of Matt\u2019s interest in cutting his hair, Greg could stand it no longer. For months, he\u2019d been bursting with desire to be lead into the kitchen, caped and shorn. He even dreamed about having his long hair chopped short. Greg saw Matt at the same jukebox, where Matt had first cornered him. He was getting ready to select a tune. Greg bolted across the bar, throwing all caution to the wind. \u201cMatt, I need you to cut my hair. Tonight! I can\u2019t stand long hair another minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it!\u201d he answered quickly. \u201cTo the car, then!\u201d The two walked quickly to the door. As they exited into the breezy night air, Matt said to Greg, \u201cYou are going to look great with a crewcut!\u201d\n\nThat was the last thing said between the two of them until the clippers were snapped off and the hand first emerged from under the cape to assess the situation.\n\nAs they rode to the apartment, Matt\u2019s hand plunged into the thick ebony tresses and stroked them gently. TThen it was up the stairs to the apartment, the door thrown open, the neon light in the kitchen flicked on, the chair pulled to the center, the cape snapped opened and then fastened snuggly. And then, the clippers snapped on, followed by a firm, rhythmic pumping motion through the mass of locks, from forehead to crown and from nape to crown. Sharp, chattering steel teeth and mounds of beautiful hair falling away in sheaths, ushering a new era of baldy bliss.\n\nFrom the first clump he spotted on the cape to the last stroke up the bristly nape, Greg knew he\u2019d made the right choice! T TThere was no turning back, especially not with Matt by his side to keep him on the straight, narrow and butched!\n\nYour Name\nWeb site designed and hosted by Channel Islands Internet \u00a9 2000-2016",
