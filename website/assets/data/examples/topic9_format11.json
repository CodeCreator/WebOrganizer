        "text":"The winning aspiration.\n\nThe business strategy book, Playing to Win, has several approaches that can help product managers be successful. Our focus in this blog is on one of these \u2013 the need to establish a \u2018winning aspiration\u2019.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started \u2013 what is a winning aspiration? Let\u2019s look at each word in turn.\n\nWhat does it mean to \u2018win\u2019?\n\nIt\u2019s quite simple \u2013 are you beating the competition?\n\nTo work out if you\u2019re winning, you need to talk about the performance of your product in your market space. Targets for revenue, profit or customer numbers might be important, but they\u2019re not sufficient. To know that you\u2019re winning, you need to measure your performance compared to that of your competition. That means metrics such as market share, superior financial returns, higher customer satisfaction, or something similar. These can be difficult to find out.\n\nOf course, the reality is that most products fail to deliver against their commercial targets. And the book contends that unless you aspire to win, and put in the appropriate effort, the best you\u2019ll ever achieve is mediocrity. You need to aim high.\n\nBut, this is not how most product managers behave. For many, getting the product delivered is their target and they dislike setting in-life performance targets against which they may be held accountable. It feels scary. After all, if you don\u2019t tell people what you\u2019re aiming for then you can\u2019t be accused of missing the target!\n\nAnd, it\u2019s not how companies typically behave.\n\nMany invest significantly in launching a lot of products (spreading their bets) but then under-invest in making the products successful once launched. If, as a product manager, you ask for significant and sustained investment in your product it will probably come at the expense of investment elsewhere. Depending on how much confidence your company has in your product and marketing insight, this will either be considered positively \u2013 as a \u2018laser-like focus\u2019 on key products or will be considered negatively \u2018putting all our eggs in one basket\u2019.\n\n\nFigure showing how confidence and amount of products lead to positive or negative outcomes\n\n\nThat\u2019s why you hear of General Electric\u2019s requirement for its business divisions. They must be the leader or second in their market. That\u2019s because the leader has the biggest share of profit in a market. And they\u2019re prepared to invest heavily to succeed. If that doesn\u2019t work, they exit the market and focus elsewhere.\n\nAnd what is meant by an aspiration?\n\nThe aspiration is a statement about the future state you want your product to achieve. You might consider this the \u2018vision\u2019 for the product \u2013 it is an attractive, inspiring guiding statement of what we\u2019re aiming to achieve.\n\nHaving a winning aspiration is valuable because it helps keep everyone focused on what\u2019s important. It will help you develop your product canvasses, business cases, roadmap, product plans and strategy. It will help when there\u2019s a need to prioritize and decide how to deal with day-to-day demands for resources and change. And, it helps you stop doing sub-optimal things so you have the resources to focus on the activities that are most likely to deliver a high level of success.\n\nWhen it comes to defining your winning aspiration, it should focus on the customer and what they care about. So, for a mobile operator, the aspiration would not be to have the biggest mobile network, but it might be to let customers connect from more places and more easily than any other network. In this example, the winning aspiration would help network investment decisions \u2013 investment in partnerships for WiFi network and adding low-cost 3G network infrastructure to plug coverage gaps might align better with the winning aspiration than rolling out an ultra-high-speed network.\n\nWithout a winning aspiration, it becomes more likely that you\u2019ll simply react to competitor activity rather than taking proactive decisions.\n\nWhilst winning aspirations might be tweaked from time to time, they ought not to change often. They\u2019re being used to influence product investments and the allocation of internal resources. Flip-flopping from one winning aspiration to another will stop you from getting people onside and pulling in a consistent direction.\n\nWinning aspiration informs other documents\n\n\nThese are the dos and don\u2019ts for setting your winning aspiration copied from Playing to Win.\n\n  \u2022 Do play to win rather than simply compete. Define winning in your context. Paint a picture of a brilliant successful future for your product.\n  \u2022 Do craft aspirations that will be meaningful and powerful to your team and to your customers.\n  \u2022 Do start with customers rather than products when thinking about what it means to win.\n  \u2022 Do set winning aspirations for your products. Ask who are your customers and what does it mean to win with them.\n  \u2022 Do think about winning relative to your traditional and best competitors.\n  \u2022 Don\u2019t stop there. Develop the rest of your strategy in support of your winning aspiration.\n\nRead our Journal on Product Strategy to find out more.\n\nAndrew Dickenson\nDirector, Product Focus\n\nShare this page\n\nLeave a comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.

        "text":"Change Leaders Will be the GCs of the Future\n\nGilbert E. Forest\n\nGilbert E. Forest Egon Zehnder, Boston\n\nWhat distinguishes an excellent general counsel from a good or merely acceptable one?\n\nTo answer that question we recently mined information about more than 300 senior legal executives from among the thousands of management appraisals that we have conducted over the past several years. These evaluations are designed to help companies take stock of their available talent, improve development programs, conduct succession planning and understand their human capital following mergers or acquisitions.\n\nEvaluations are typically based on nine scaled leadership competencies: (1) Results Orientation, (2) Strategic Orientation, (3) Market Knowledge, (4) Collaboration and Influencing, (5) Developing Organizational Capability, (6) Team Leadership, (7) Change Leadership, (8) Customer Impact and (9) Functional Competency.\n\nLeadership Competencies Defined\n\n  \u2022 Results Orientation: Focusing on delivering and improving measurable business results. High performers improve the way things are done based on a thoughtful, calculated approach to risk.\n  \u2022 Strategic Orientation: Thinking long-term and outside one\u2019s own area. Requires business awareness, critical analysis and conceptualization of information in a way that defines the next steps. High performers challenge the current direction and propose new longterm direction.\n  \u2022 Market Knowledge: Understanding the market in which the business operates, including the competition, suppliers, customer base and regulatory environment. High performers segment the market and anticipate where it will go, based on understanding the drivers and the competition.\n  \u2022 Collaboration & Influencing: Working with and influencing those outside one\u2019s functional area to create a positive impact on business performance. High performers facilitate collaboration and partnerships.\n  \u2022 Developing Organizational Capability: Developing the long-term capabilities of others and the organization as a whole. High performers provide constructive behavioral feedback in a long-term career context.\n  \u2022 Team Leadership: Building effective teams in one\u2019s immediate organization. This applies to virtual or cross-functional teams, whether or not there is a formal leader. High performers build empowered teams that can develop and deliver on goals.\n  \u2022 Change Leadership: Transforming, aligning and energizing an organization. High performers create change leaders to propagate a new message.\n  \u2022 Customer Impact: Serving and building value-added relationships. High performers cultivate relationships and anticipate the customers\u2019 needs from their own perspective.\n  \u2022 Functional Competency: Mastering one\u2019s area of expertise, staying up to date, and sharing and disseminating that knowledge to drive business purposes. High performers act as business partners who can bring specialized expertise to the table when necessary.\n\nTogether, these competencies provide a predictive model of leadership for top executives of all kinds.\n\nThe results of our analysis carry interesting implications for boards and CEOs that are thinking about how best to develop top GC succession talent, and for individual legal executives who want to improve their performance. We compared the legal executives ranked as \u201coutstanding\u201d based on their competencies compared to those ranked \u201cgood,\u201d and \u201cacceptable.\u201d\n\nAmong the most striking findings was that, while functional competency (legal and regulatory knowledge in the company\u2019s areas of focus) was what distinguished the outstanding general counsel 15 years ago, today the bottom quartile in our sample have functional competency scores similar to outstanding GCs. Our data showed the functional competency level of all GCs to be generally high.\n\nAlthough CEOs have for some time been seeking more business-savvy GCs, the difference in market knowledge between outstanding and ordinary GCs is marginal. We would have expected outstanding GCs to be ahead of their peers in this competency.\n\nChange Leaders Will Be the GCs of the Future - Image\nFigure 1: Outstanding GCs and average CEOs\n\nWe found that outstanding GCs are significantly more skilled than their peers across the remaining leadership competencies. In addition, we found a meaningful negative correlation between time in one\u2019s role and competency level. Legal executives who rank highest have been in their current role for the shortest time. This suggests that many chief legal officers are simply not able to maintain as competitive a skill set over time.\n\nTheir replacements are being promoted with competency levels higher than those of their predecessors. This might suggest that once in the top roles, legal executives are not able to keep up with rapidly-changing demand for leadership competencies, so companies benefit from replacing them. It also suggests that legal executives need to find ways to benchmark and develop their skills to keep pace with the best in class. We advocate that legal executives understand and benchmark these competencies early in their careers.\n\nTrying to understand the gulf in skills between excellent GCs and their peers, we compared outstanding GCs to CEOs. The outstanding GCs have evolved leadership skills to the level of the average CEOs on almost every competency. They surpass the CEOs in collaboration.\n\nThe three gaps are in strategic orientation, change leadership and market knowledge. We believe outstanding GCs are outstanding because they emulate CEOs in order to be the business partners they seek.\n\nThese competencies are put into action in concrete ways by outstanding GCs. The GC of a $20B energy company has the lead attorneys sit down with their respective business executives annually and review the business plan, to determine where the legal department brings support and value. The lead attorney and the business leader agree on turnaround times, priorities and a cost\/benefit analysis of the services provided, and they agree in writing.\n\nTwo or more of these competencies often dovetail. For example, a GC in an innovation-driven Fortune 100 company asks his attorneys to spend two days per week working on-site in research and development to discuss innovation, and determine how to support it. The organization\u2019s team rating of the legal group and the legal team\u2019s satisfaction have never been higher\u2014 results that affirm the GC\u2019s skill at combining customer impact with team leadership.\n\nA comparison of outstanding GCs to outstanding CEOs provides a glimpse of the outstanding GCs of the future. Outstanding CEOs are seeking GCs whose competencies match theirs. Outstanding GCs already match top CEOs in collaborating and influencing, and are not far behind in developing organizational leadership.\n\nCompanies need to offer their legal executives development opportunities and establish development and leadership programs that will groom high potential internal legal talent for GC roles. Failing this, legal executives will continue to seek development opportunities by leaving their organizations.\n\nInvestment in top legal talent brings returns. Internal candidates with developed competencies clearly have the advantage in understanding the business. With an aging population and a complex legal and regulatory environment, companies not developing their internal legal talent will face an increasingly competitive environment for external recruits. Boards, CEOs and GCs must become aware of these competencies and establish plans that give their legal executives the opportunity to develop.\n\nAs the bar rises, today\u2019s outstanding GCs will likely strengthen their skills in the two areas where they lag outstanding CEOs: market knowledge, and change leadership. The outstanding GC of the future will be expected to perform on a par with outstanding CEOs in leadership competencies. As their work evolves, they are also likely to see new competencies emphasized.\n\nOver the next decade, the \u201csoft skills\u201d \u2013 those that address issues of people and the organization \u2013 will constitute a much higher percentage of the GC role than they have in the past. As companies become increasingly diverse, international, and collaborative, the emphasis on engaging thoughtfully with a wide variety of people, in contrast to using simple commandand- control levers, will grow. With demographic changes decreasing the pool of currently outstanding candidates, the emphasis on \u201cgrowing your own talent\u201d will also continue.\n\nWe also believe that as outstanding GCs continue to develop their skills, they not only will come to resemble outstanding CEOs in their level of competency, but will increasingly often become CEOs themselves.\n\nCo-authored by Stephen P.

        "text":"The Turtle Soup Economy\n\nGeorge L. Perry\n\nJazz great Cole Porter once sang, \u201cIs it the real turtle soup or merely the mock?\u201d It\u2019s a relevant question about the state of the current economic recovery as well. By late summer, a double dip recession had become a familiar forecast of U.S. economic prospects. The financial crisis in Europe remained unresolved and threatened to spread. And most data measuring current economic activity turned weaker. Today Europe\u2019s crisis remains unresolved, and the political difficulties that stand in the way of a fix have become even more apparent. But the recent data show a few brighter spots on the economic landscape.\n\nRetail sales, which had stagnated through the spring, rose at a 7 percent annual rate between June and September. New auto sales were part of the story, with domestic brands in September having their best month yet in the recovery. This spurt occurred despite continued declines in surveys of consumer sentiment, showing once again that such measures are not reliable predictors of aggregate consumer spending.\n\nManufacturing production has been another bright spot. After remaining flat between January and June this year, production rose at a 7 percent rate between June and September. A part of this rise was in production of business capital goods, a category that rises when business grows more optimistic about its own prospects. Business capital goods orders, which presage future production of machinery, equipment and aircraft, surged in July and August. But the surge came in orders for aircraft, many of which are for delivery years in the future. Aside from aircraft, recent orders imply only modest further gains in capital goods production.\n\nResidential construction remains deeply depressed, particularly for single family homes. Housing starts and permits for multi-unit buildings rose this summer from very low levels. And nonresidential construction seems to have bottomed out in the first half of the year.\n\nSlow employment growth has been the most disappointing feature of this recovery. Without faster employment growth, any pickup in consumer demand or in demand for capital goods will not be sustained. And the headline number for employment growth, which is based on firms\u2019 payrolls, averaged only 96,000 per month between June and September. However a separate BLS employment estimate, based on the monthly survey of households, shows a distinct pickup, with gains averaging 230,000 per month in this period. Which one to believe?\n\nFrom month to month, the household data are highly volatile, which is why they get so little attention when the monthly data are released. But over longer intervals they are as useful as the payroll data in assessing how the economy is growing, which suggests averaging the two into a combined measure. After monthly gains averaging 55,000 over the previous twelve months, this combined measure rose by 163,000 a month between June and September.\n\nAll in all, there is evidence the expansion has quickened. But the inference from recent data is highly tentative. And if current prospects are a bit brighter than three months ago, they are still far from bright enough. The double dip now seems unlikely, and this should be good enough for the stock market. But until we see growth above trend for an extended period, this will remain a mock expansion.",

        "text":"This Is What Makes Collaborative Philanthropy an Effective Approach\n\nThis Is What Makes Collaborative Philanthropy an Effective Approach\n\n\nPhilanthropists are continually seeking out ways to make their giving more effective, from creating unique giving structures to working closer with the communities being assisted. One of the oldest strategies for increasing impact is collaboration, which is evident in large community organizations like United Way Worldwide.\n\nIn recent years, the number of independent funder collaboratives has skyrocketed, which begs the question of how much collaboration really helps. Several researchers have begun looking at collaboratives to see how they function effectively and identify the reasons they might fail or succeed.\n\nA team of researchers recently set out to find concrete answers to this inquiry and published their results in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. Here is more information about their findings.\n\nUncovering What Drives Success in Collaborative Philanthropy\n\nThe researchers identified more than 125 articles and reports addressing philanthropic collaboratives. They then conducted an analysis of their findings to make recommendations about what these organizations should do and what they should avoid. Ultimately, the team uncovered important knowledge gaps, especially when it came to the question of whether or not collaboratives are effective structures for giving.\n\nPerhaps it is not surprising that these knowledge gaps exist. One of the inherent difficulties in studying collaboratives is that there is no perfect control group for comparison. Furthermore, structures across collaboratives vary dramatically, and leaders often prove reticent to speak openly about their failures.\n\nNext, the team decided to look deeply at 10 relatively successful collaboratives and 15 that had experienced considerable setbacks to help fill in the identified knowledge gaps. All of the included collaboratives pooled resources to fund initiatives rather than providing support while members pursued their own, individual philanthropy.\n\nThe successful collaboratives all had existed for at least three years, which gave leaders adequate time to reflect on their processes. The researchers conducted dozens of interviews and received surveys from hundreds of relevant parties. In the end, the team found that collaboration can drive incredible returns when executed well and effect results that no one could have accomplished on their own.\n\n\nThe Importance of a Unifying Investment Thesis in Collaboration\n\nOf course, no consistent recipe for success exists for collaborative philanthropic organizations. However, the researchers did find one prominent thing that all 10 successful organizations had in common: the presence of a clear primary investment thesis.\n\nThis thesis lays out exactly how the collaborative will achieve an impact that could not be accomplished by the individual members alone. This thesis also explored how the team could create value for both funders and grantees based on the types of goals that it hopes to pursue.\n\nEveryone involved with the collaborative needs to be on the same page about the investment thesis, which is not an easy thing to get right. Collaboratives should prioritize a primary thesis, according to the researchers. That way, everyone works toward the same goal.\n\nThese theses took one of several forms. Some theses focused on organization funding, which means finding proven, capable grantees and trusting them to develop their own programming. Other theses want to build more resilient fields by changing practices slowly over time to help organizations more easily carry out their strategies. A third thesis strategy involves working toward achievable milestones on the road toward population-level change. These three strategies are all valid, but very different, which is why it is so critical to get everyone in agreement.\n\nDeciding on the Optimal Investment Thesis for a Collaborative\n\nThe next question deals with how funders go about finding the right investment thesis for their collaboratives. The researchers found that this agreement usually came out of a discussion of how the collaborative members want to make an impact and the values they wish to bring to their work. When all of this information is on the table, it becomes easier to figure out a strategy that capitalizes on everyone\u2019s individual strengths and allows them to work together toward a common good.\n\nEvery collaborative goes through a startup phase, which is the ideal time for addressing this sort of question. One of the significant strengths of a collaborative is the different experiences, knowledge, and insight brought by each member. However, this strength can lead to downfall if balance is not found, and expectations made explicit, early.\n\nWhile the conversation about strategy should happen early, that does not mean plans should not evolve over time. Another key aspect of success for collaboratives involves flexibility. Each of the successful collaboratives studied by the researchers when through significant strategic modifications later in its lifecycle.\n\nOften, successful collaboratives were distinguished from failed ones by the ability to identify the need for change and the ability to achieve a new consensus. Both internal and external circumstances will shift and the investment thesis may also need to change as these shifts occur. Such a change will keep the value proposition high for donor-members so that everyone stays invested in the organization. When an organization does not change, people may start to withdraw and the collaborative will crumble.\n\n\nSorry, comments are closed for this post.",

        "text":"Is health care reform puncturing inflated profits?\n\nJust days after it was enacted, large companies are decrying the unintended consequences of health care reform. Apparently, it\u2019s exposing inflated profits at companies such as AT&T, Caterpillar, and Deere & Co.\n\nOn Friday, three days after the law was signed, AT&T made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying it would take a $1 billion non-cash charge in the first quarter to reflect changes in the tax treatment for its Medicare Part D subsidy.\n\nAT&T, though, was a little slow in its corporate fear-mongering. Caterpillar made its filing one day after the law was signed, warning of a $100 million after-tax charge. Deere, meanwhile, said its tax expense would be about $150 million higher.\n\nAnd we\u2019re probably just getting started. A strict reading of accounting rules require companies to book the charge in the quarter in which the law changed, even though the rules won\u2019t take effect for several years.\n\nAccountants I spoke with noted these are non-cash charges, but it will affect companies\u2019 reported net income. That, in turn, may erode the companies\u2019 market value. Already, some are predicting this will gut the stock market\u2019s recently rally. So far, though, shares of each of the companies have actually risen.\n\nThe tax issues involved are complex. When Congress enacted the Medicare prescription drug plan in 2003, it offered employers both a subsidy and a tax credit to continue providing their own benefits to retirees rather than shifting them to the government plan. The new health care law eliminates the tax benefit, but not the subsidy.\n\nSo what these filings are really saying is that for the past seven years, companies like AT&T have actually been inflating their income through tax benefits for retiree health care. It\u2019s not unlike the way companies padded profits from overfunded pensions plans in the 1990s, or goosed their reported income by not reporting employee stock options as a compensation expense.\n\nSo are these companies really reflecting a \u201ccost\u201d of health care reform, or finally coming clean with shareholders about yet another corporate welfare benefit?",

        "text":"Cyber Security\n\nmaclaren technology center\n\nOne concern many online users and businesses have is about the security of their personal conversations and correspondences. Nobody wants to have their correspondences stolen and snooped on by strangers for personal and security purposes. Furthermore, many online products make broad claims to the security and safety of their products, but how can we be sure that they work as advertised? Just because a company claims that its product is secure does not mean it is true. One of the limited options that consumers have is to rely on third party and independent reviews.\n\nOne such independent security reviewer is the Electronic Frontier Foundation. They recently made a very eye-opening and thought provoking review of online messenger products. Some of the criteria they based their evaluation on includes the following: Is your communication encrypted in transit; Is your communication encrypted with a key the provider doesn\u2019t have access to; Can you independently verify your correspondent\u2019s identity; Are past communications secure if your keys are stolen; Is the code open to independent review; Has there been an independent security audit.\n\nIt is important that security include end-to-end encryption, which means that the service company doesn\u2019t have access to the keys of the users. Only the users have the keys and it doesn\u2019t leave their possession. This means that the service company can\u2019t give up information without the consent of the users. It is also important that past communications are secure if keys are stolen, so if a key is compromised but the message deleted on a user\u2019s local machine, past messages are encrypted and can\u2019t be decoded at all because the encryption uses ephemeral keys which are routinely deleted. Finally, it is necessary to make sure that the identity of the corresponding participant can be verified when communications are in route, because a significant security risk exists in divulging information to a false identity. The perpetrator can glean and steal sensitive data, so this must be prevented with a robust verification protocol.\n\nSome of the top security performers in this analysis include products such as ChatSecure, CryptoCat, Pidgin, Signal\/RedPhone, Silent Phone, Silent Text, Telegram, and TextSecure. The best mass-market option was Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime products, although neither provides complete protection against sophisticated and targeted forms of cyber intrusion. Some of the messenger options analyzed were found to be vulnerable to surveillance by the service provider, such as email products from Google, Facebook and Apple; Yahoo\u2019s web and mobile chat; Secret; and WhatsApp. Even worse, some major messaging platforms have no encryption at all, such as Yahoo\u2019s desktop messenger, QQ, and Mxit.\n\nThis security analysis affirms the notion that individuals and businesses must be very diligent in protecting personal information, and this includes stringent research in the security of the products that one utilizes to secure important data. In this day and age, cyber security is something that most people take for granted, but as the system evolves to become more sophisticated and the world becomes more reliant on cyber technology, the importance for all users to protect themselves will become paramount. You cannot assume that any entity or product is safe based on general reputation or unconfirmed claims. Assuming these claims as truth without due diligence opens yourself up to risk which is the path to loss and damage.\n\nChoosing A Business Structure\n\n\nWhen starting a new business, one must carefully choose a business structure to make it a legal entity, which means that it can own property, own bank accounts, and pay taxes the same way that an individual person would. When contemplating which business structure to choose, one must weight the pros and cons as they all have different features.\n\n\u00a0A sole proprietorship is usually owned by a single person or a couple. With this business structure, the owner is personally liable for all business debts, can freely transfer the business assets, and report all taxes under personal income. This entity is good in its simplicity and lack of restrictions. However, it comes with a severe drawback of potentially being personally liable for all damages that a business may incur.\n\n\u00a0In recent times, Limited Liability Companies have become very popular, as they combine the limited legal liability of full corporations but have easier tax structures like sole proprietorships and partnerships. LLCs are powerful because they protect owners from the present and future debts of the business. They also provide tax benefits of pass-through business losses that can offset the owner\u2019s other nonbusiness income and distribution of profit that can be taxed at the owner\u2019s potentially lower marginal tax bracket.\n\nIn addition, if a business has multiple owners, it can operate as an LLC while electing for its tax structure to be treated as a corporate entity. If the owners of the LLC want to retain profits within the business to facilitate growth of the business, the recommended option is a C corporation tax election, where the LLC\u2019s profits are only subject to the beginning corporate tax rate of 15%, which is usually less than the personal marginal tax rates of individual owners. And if any of the owners wish to receive compensation, they can be paid W-2 wages for their work within this structure. However, if the owners prefer to withdraw substantial profits from business, the recommended option is the S Corporation election. This allows each owner to receive a pro rated share of the LLC\u2019s total profit as distributions that would be personally taxed at each owner\u2019s marginal tax rate. Furthermore, these distributions are not subject to Self-Employment Tax.\n\nWith general partnerships, partners share income and managerial duties, while each partner is personally liable for any debt. Members of general partnerships must file an informational tax return and file personal income taxes. General partnerships are the most simple business structure to form, as they only require that at least two people agree to be partners or conduct business and share profits even with an express agreement. They do not have to register or file organizational documents but usually must register a trade name unless the business operates under the names of the partners.\n\n\u00a0Corporations are complex structures with high legal costs. They are owned through stock and have complicated tax, licensing and regulation requirements. They must also follow complex procedures such as issuing stock certificates, holding annual meetings and keeping minutes, electing directors, and so on.\n\n\u00a0C-Corporations are distinct legal entities that are taxed separately from the owners and generally are not advised to own assets that appreciate in value. While they do protect against personal liability, they have some disadvantages with regards to taxes and operations when compared to an LLC or limited partnership. However, they may have lower tax rates if annual net income is below $75,000. S-Corporations protect their owners against personal liability and are not taxed as a separate legal entity. They have limitations on the number and type of eligible shareholders and have some tax and operating disadvantages when compared to an LLC.\n\n\u00a0When choosing a business structure, it is important to consult a tax accountant or attorney to make sure that one understands all the pros and cons behind the decision and makes the correct elections based on the situation. This decision should be based on a multitude of factors, including the type of business, the tax structure and benefits desired, who the owners of the business are, and the amount of capital and budget available to spend on a particular business structure. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOnline Business Marketing\n\nonline business office\n\nThe biggest challenge facing most online businesses is the difficulty in obtaining traffic. The problem here is if you\u2019re not getting traffic, you\u2019re not getting sales. Even if you have the greatest product or service in the world, it must be visible to consumers for it to sell and deliver the most value. Your business needs to be discovered by consumers. Whether it be through word-of-mouth, print and tv advertising, or online marketing, there needs to be some avenue of accessing the awareness of consumers.\n\nOne option for acquiring more traffic with online marketing is to pay for traffic through PPC search engines, which provides immediate qualified traffic based on keywords that you bid on. The goal is to bid on the top three positions, because these reach 80 percent of all internet users. Bidding on PPC search engine traffic also allows your site to get ranked in the search engines for free. The advantages of this method is the speed of delivery and flexibility in selecting which search terms you would like to advertise for. Disadvantages include the competitiveness of this industry, which drives up the prices of keyword ads and doesn\u2019t guarantee you will receive the amount of traffic that you intend.\n\nAnother option is to implement search engine optimization techniques that make your website available to address the search queries of users looking for information. By adding relevant content to your site and promoting it to other websites and as many viewers as possible, you can increase the brand awareness of the site and make sure it is hitting the public consciousness. One firm that specializes in SEO in Washington DC, states that 87 percent of all consumers search actively for products and services online. Furthermore, this DC SEO firm says that consumers are becoming more attached and dependent on their mobile phones for personal activities than ever before, which means online marketing is becoming more essential for being able to access these mobile consumers. This is a very powerful way of marketing bec... (truncated)",

        "text":"Sell, Don\u2019t Collect\n\n\nMany of the operations I have modeled recently have increasing inventory levels due to more aggressive lending, buying and forfeitures.\n\nSome of us like to sell our stuff, and some are genuinely afraid to let go of something. It never ceases to amaze me that so many operators still price their product to the moon. You would think they have never been to a\u00a0 Home Depot or Target in their lives.\n\nTypically our inventory falls into four general categories:\n(a) Premium inventory \u2014 hard to get, hard to keep, rare\n(b) Average inventory \u2014 run of the mill generic, mass-produced goods\n(c) Obsolete \u2014 aging or outdated, broken, missing pieces, less than useful\n(d) Gold \u2014 Scrap or resalable\n\nOnce we properly identify product by category, we can develop a plan to control our inventory levels.\n\nInventory Yield\n\nThe yield is the overall return on a particular asset category, such as loans or inventory. Here, we\u2019re focusing on the inventory yield.\n\nThe simplest way to calculate your yields are your average inventory turns (amount of $ cost rotations) of your inventory for any particular period sampled X your margins. Here are some examples:\n\n\u2022 100,000 cost of inventory turned 2 X a year with a 50% margin = 100% yield\n\u2022 100,000 cost of inventory turned 3 X a year with a 40% margin = 120% yield\n\u2022 100,000 cost of inventory turned 4 X a year with a 35% margin = 140% yield\n\nTo understand the yields better, if my annualized yield is 100 percent, then every average dollar of cost inventory I have in my store would return me my dollar plus another dollar. If my yield was 150 percent, then my return goes up to a $1.50 back on every $1 of cost.\n\nEvery day your inventory sits on the shelf you are loosing money. Inventory can become outdated, stolen, broken. If you operate on borrowed money, then your rate of return diminishes each day you look at it. Your cost of capital has to come into play \u2014 cleaning, pricing, displaying, merchandising, transferring, inventorying, testing and insuring all cost us money!\n\nDecreasing Inventory Yields means our level of profitability decreases with slower inventory turns as a result of inventory build ups in most cases or a lack luster desire to dispose of it.\n\nRecently in one of the multi-unit groups that I consult with, one of their area managers said, \u201cThere is so much out-dated and other inventory on the floors, we are unable to put the nice new stuff coming out on the floor.\u201d\n\nIf your store is tight for space front and back, this poses several problems. For starters, back rooms housing overstock reduces your back room storage capabilities. This equates to less return off your back room. It has been my experience that it is difficult to sell stock in the back rooms. This coupled with other product becoming dated, broken and stolen on the front end exacerbates the problem.\n\nWhy are companies like Wal-Mart and Target so successful? They sell massive amounts of product at very low margins. They\u2019re all about inventory turns.\n\nI believe all of us can concur that the economy is not improving and will only continue to get worse. As a result, we will need to remain vigilant in our efforts to offset continuous decreases in overall consumer spending. If we can make our inventory pricing structure attractive enough, we will be able to continue to carve out opportunities.\n\nInventory is a game of averages. In some cases we must take hits or lose our investments on poor inventory acquisitions. These can be bad loans, broken product, outdated product and so on.\n\nHaving said all that, here are some strategies for your consideration.\n\na. Premium Goods\n\nPremium goods attract consumers. This is typically product that is in very short supply and in high-demand. It should receive reasonable shelf life to illustrate the types of goods we take and offer.\n\nMany team leaders tend to over qualify B goods as premium goods. Large high-end flat panels, Rolex watches and other assorted product that is rare in availability falls into this category. DVD players, receivers, speaker systems, tools and other general merchandise doesn\u2019t.\n\nOur strategy for premium goods should be to keep it reasonably priced after doing our market study. There are a variety of ways to determine market values \u2014 eBay, Google and Froogle, to name a few.\n\nThese items should have some reasonable shelf life before more aggressive discounting should apply.\n\nb. Average Inventory\n\nAverage inventory is just that, average generic product that we generate on large levels on a daily basis. Too many times organizations get all wrapped up in margins and stop paying attention to their climbing inventory levels.\n\nCreating a sense of urgency because of limited availability creates more demand. If I came in to shop for DVD players and saw that you had 50 of them for sale, I could assume that if I came in next week, next month or even next year, you would probably still have 50 for me to choose from.\n\nIf you have only five of them, then the sense of urgency comes into play. The customer then feels he had better get it while it lasts.\n\nc. Obsolete and Aging Inventory\n\nMore of the inventory I see lately falls into the obsolete product category. Some examples would be:\n\n  \u2022 Digital Cameras \u2014 anything less than 8 to 10 mega pixels is already on the extinction list.\n  \u2022 35MM Cameras \u2014 few to no Options with these, with the exception of high-end manual SLRs \u2014 some schools offering photography courses do like their students to learn about their eye and the camera eye and so encourage the use of film \u2014 but this is diminishing. Exceptions are wide format or other high end cameras of yesteryear.\n  \u2022 Computers, Printers, Scanners \u2014 all this type of product is almost outdated the day it rolls off the assembly line. As we accumulate them, it will become increasingly difficult to dispose of them. Recently I saw an APPLE IIC (my first computer) in a pawnshop for $199, with no software, and the operator was serious.\n  \u2022 DVD \u2013 VCR Systems \u2014 Even HD DVD players are now outdated, since Blue Ray won the HD race. Systems that are not HDMI or SCSI capable are dinosaurs. We saw an end to 4-track and 8-track players, cassette players and VCRs \u2014 soon we\u2019ll see the end of CD and DVD players, and much more!\n  \u2022 DVDs and VHS Movies \u2014 VHS is about done and soon DVDs will be as well.\n  \u2022 CDs \u2014 The IPod and cell phone have just about eliminated CDs as we know them. I can put the equivalent of 5,000 CDs in my telephone and plug it into my car stereo, computer or TV. Recently, one of my multi-store operator clients had hundreds of thousands of CDs and VHS tapes in their inventories. They were going to scan UPC codes and list them on online. The effort required to scan, list, box, ship, inventory and get paid for this stuff is enormous. In the end they will lose a lot of the money they have invested in this dying inventory product. It also slows down their turns and yields. They have even lost income-producing storage space in their back rooms.\n  \u2022 Tools \u2014 construction around the United States has dropped off the cliff. Tools and general contracting tools are busting the seams of many shops.\n  \u2022 Obsolete \u2014 anything that is missing equipment or pieces, outdated, damaged, broken or simply obsolete. Your highest priority should be getting it out of your store. It looks bad on the shelves and reflects badly on you. You can donate much of this stuff to Goodwill, the Salvation Army or technical schools. You can get a tax write-off on your income statements, receive goodwill in your community and clean up your store at the same time.\n  \u2022 Aging \u2014 as inventory ages, many other things begin to happen. It increasingly becomes attractive for theft, gets broken and costs us money to continuously display, test, insure, inventory and or sell. This product should go through continuous write downs until it is disposed of. In a number of my past operations we would charge our team leaders an asset-carrying fee and a penalty against their bonuses for being so in love with this stuff. This has an amazing effect for liquidating this stuff.\n\nd. Gold\n\nGold is liquidable. Unlike televisions and tool boxes, you can convert this asset back to cash instantly and daily.\n\nI prefer to sell off gold assets every 30 days no matter what the market is doing. This is called cost averaging.\n\nIn the case of buying the product, if my hold periods are 30 days or less, why could I not pay up to 80 percent or 90 percent of melt value to buy it and try to get all or most of the business in my market area?\n\nTo put it another way, would you pay $80 or $90 for a $100 bill? Look at gold the same way. If you pay more to buy or obtain the gold in your market, you are really investing in yourself.\n\nThe secret is to sell frequently. This produces good cost averaging and will allow you to take little to no risk in paying premium dollars to acquire this product and gain on your competition.\n\nIf I only made a 20 percent margin on my scrap, and I sold it every 30 days (or 12 times a year), that would be a 240 percent return on my annualized dollars invested. Sure beats a 0 to 1 percent CD from the bank, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nProduct Treatment\n\nThis covers the four categories of product as I have described them. Considerations on how to treat these products are as follows:\n\n  \u2022 Identify premium goods and maintain good retail dollars for the rare and or exotic goods\n  \u2022 Identify your general run of the mill product, and begin aggressive inventory mark downs on this stuff. You can create in-store special areas, where you can stack up overstock goods and place them all in a sale price of $X categories, thus letting the customers choose and pick from the assortments. You sell one or two, you move one or two more in. This can be applied to overstock of anything \u2014 cameras, DVD players, tools. Recently I merchandised a group of stores in California. We created some $19.95 to $39.95 categories for DVD players and saw them fly out the doors. Pricing your ... (truncated)",

        "text":"How Fast Can a Credit Score Improve?\n\nby Russell Huebsch ; Updated July 27, 2017\n\nYou can ruin your credit score in a day, but it may take years before you become an excellent credit risk again. Focusing on boosting your credit score is a good idea, but also a long-term process. There are ways to boost your score dramatically in a matter of days, but not if you have legitimate red flags on your credit report.\n\nFastest Way Possible\n\nCredit reports sometimes contain errors, such as bankruptcies that belong to another person, or a creditor reporting an on-time payment as late. Rapid rescoring companies have special approval from the credit agencies to fix mistakes on creditor reports in as little as 72 hours. Normally, disputing an error with an agency takes 90 days before they remove the mistake. This service is only available through lenders and costs upward of $50 -- a meager sum compared to what you can save on a loan by deleting an error.\n\n\nPaying your bills on time and eliminating credit card debt gets you well on your way to improving credit score, even if the credit agencies probably won't update your report for another few months. A month or two of paying bills on time, however, probably does not do much for your score. The Motley Fool suggests that significant improvement in a score does not happen until after six to 12 months of perfect payment history.\n\nVideo of the Day\n\nThings You Can Do Right Now\n\nCredit experts, such as Liz Pulliam Weston of MSN Money Central, say borrowers should not use more than 30 percent of their available revolving credit limit -- called credit utilization. Ideally, you should pay off all of your credit card debt, but you can lower your credit utilization ratio by raising your limit. Ask your lender for a spending increase, but see if you can get one without a credit check, because an inquiry dings your score one to five points. If you have an old card, put a small charge on it and pay the balance each month. Creditors do not report accounts that you stop using for a few months.\n\n\nDo not cancel old credit cards. Part of your credit score comes from the average age on your accounts. If you already have several types of credit, such as an installment loan, credit card and retail card, avoid applying for new debt. You do not want to take on unnecessary debt or build history on a new account unless you are coming out of a bankruptcy or trying to get a good mix of loans.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRussell Huebsch has written freelance articles covering a range of topics from basketball to politics in print and online publications.
