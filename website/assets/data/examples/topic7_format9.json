        "text":"People Confess Why They're Really Single Right Now\nImage by Free-Photos from Pixabay\n\nIt's never easy to be honest with yourself. If you can hide behind the facade you've crafted from other people, then perhaps you can hide from it too. Truthfully, confronting that honesty is more important, as it'll allow you to move past it and grow beyond it. Just take a look at these people's stories below as they open up about why dating them might be a bit of a challenge.\n\nReddit user, u\/Niyi_M, wanted to hear about:\n\nWhy are you single?\n\nOh Yeah. The Worldwide Pandemic.\n\nhomer simpson relief GIF Giphy\n\nThere isn't a lot of people I know that are my type, and the pandemic is making it hard to meet anyone who I would be interested in. Also I kind of just have high standards when it comes to dating.\n\n\nStandards are always great, hope you find someone!\n\n\nWaiting For The World To Get Back To Going\n\nI'm shy, I have low self esteem, my confidence isn't the best, I have extreme social anxiety, and I'm afraid of rejection. I'm hoping to fix a lot of these problems after covid [disappears.]\n\n\nGiving Yourself Time To Heal\n\nI want to be single for awhile until the right one comes along. I've dated two guys this year and there was another guy in my life that I wanted to date but thank God I didn't. I'm over them now but the crap that I went through with them was unreal.\n\n\nRushing In To Fast\n\nBecause I always ruin the relationships I'm in.\n\nUsually by moving too fast. I literally JUST ruined one without meaning too. I really like this one more then the others tho, so let's hope I can turn it around \ud83d\ude43\n\n\nPutting Up Your Own Walls\n\nBecause I am overweight. I have confidence and know how to flirt I just have a hard time believing someone is actually attracted to me because i am overweight. But working on it now and should not be a problem soon!!!!\n\n\nUnable To Push Past High School\n\nI have always not dated for many reasons. In high school, I didn't see the point in dating. I was raised Christian, so dating was for marriage. I also knew I'd go abroad for university, so there was no point at the time because I knew I wouldn't marry that person.\n\nIn university, I was depressed and anxious most of the time. I had one or two guys try to talk to me, but because of my anxiety it really felt like an attack to have people show interest in me. I was actually interested in one of the guys, but my thinking was way too messed up anyway. I thought (and still think) he was weird for being interested in me.\n\nToday, it's because I need to heal from my childhood trauma, depression and anxiety. I know I won't be a healthy partner if I don't work on myself.\n\n\nSomething Beyond Your Physical Control\n\nI have MS and as a result I have ED and I just don't have the confidence. I don't think that a woman wants to be with a man who can't get it up naturally at my age. It's humiliating.\n\n\nthere's nothing humiliating about something you have no control over, and there's someone that will be understanding and patient with you.\n\n\nPrefer To Be Alone\n\nBecause I'm average-looking at best and probably require a lot of patience to get to know. I'm a bit shy, and maybe a bit closed off emotionally. I don't really like getting close to people at this point.I always end up looking like an idiot, and I don't think I could handle another disappointment.\n\n\nHanging On Tight To Someone Else\n\nlisa simpson GIF Giphy\n\nStill getting over someone else\n\n\nTime heals all, But writing down your thoughts will speed things up. It's easy to lose sight of the big picture when you're caught up in your emotions, the best way to heal is to start small. Shower every day, brush your teeth, eat real food, go to sleep early. It won't make you feel better over night but if you don't keep moving you drown. It sucks right now, and that's ok, no one said you have to be happy all the time. Remember that you are more than just your relationship. you love them and there's nothing wrong with that, but remember to show yourself that same love.\n\nYou've got this.\n\n\nAlways Competing\n\nWomen never see me as a romantic partner. More like I'm the competition. Lost count how many women would try and one-up me over the years growing up to adulthood. I still haven't forgotten when one called me a 'second class citizen' since I was known as the poor immigrant kid at school.\n\n\nLike What I Like, Unironically\n\nThere's a lot of reasons that I'm still single. I haven't dated anyone or have any plans to- I think I'm just simply not ready. I want to focus more on myself, like maybe sometime after I finish college so I'm not all over the place. I also have seen or heard\/read stories of relationships going downhill- and not in a pretty way either. Those really deter me from getting into a relationship because it can be stressful when taken in the wrong direction.\n\nBut for the personal side of things- I also prefer someone that shares the same interests as me without belittling my likes or dislikes or just my personal lifestyle. And that's about it all I can say really. This post was a bit long- I just had to get it off my chest I guess lol. I know I can't be in control of what, I prefer to be alone anyway. Maybe have a cat or two to keep me company.\n\n\nGiving In For Less Than You Think\n\nBecause I always ended up with me settling and waiting. I realized that you can't really change a person through just waiting and making excuses for them. So if you see those makings of red flags, you can't just wait for them to change for you, just because you tell them it's hurting you. Sometimes communication isn't good enough because the other person won't ever listen.\n\n\nConstant Work On Yourself\n\nI have a lot of things that I need to work on in therapy. I don't think it would be right to inflict myself on somebody else before I'm some nebulous quantity of \"healthier.\" Same thing with my debt and financial issues.\n\nThat's the main thing. Add our no-end-in-sight plague on top of it.\n\n\nWhen Love Is Anxiety\n\nhate myself, fear of intimacy, social anxiety. So feeling in love was so depressing and gave me so much anxiety. I never hated myself more when I knew he loved me back. And people didn't understand that i don't especially want sex in my life (asexual) so it's hard finding someone\n\n\nPeople tend to think that you have to love yourself before someone else can love you or before you can love someone.\n\nYou are good enough and deserving of love just by being here and alive.\n\nI would look into imposter syndrome.\n\nAlso, so many people are asexual (i'm grey asexual) and it's beautiful how much more openly common it is now.\n\n\nToo Long By Yourself\n\nI've been alone too long.\n\nHaving someone around might be handy, but would most likely bug the sh-t out of me.\n\n\nEven in the year 2020 I feel like I don't get enough alone time, and I live alone, WFH, and only leave the house once or twice a week. I can image trying to share my space with another person.\n\n\nA Later Bloomer\n\nBecause, due to religion and the way I was raised I thought even talking to a girl is a sin so I never really interacted with girls that much. I have basically 0 experience when it comes to talking to girls let alone dating.\n\n\nThe Trifecta From Hell\n\nA combination of depression, social anxiety and lack of any social skills\n\n\nDating Yourself Instead\n\nI am uncomfortable dating and prefer being single so my time is dedicated to what I need to do in my life\n\n\nYes! This leads to feeling lonely sometimes but I'm busy and I get over it. Online dating makes me nauseous and disgusted that I need to judge someone based on a few pictures.\n\n\nYour Own Worst Enemy Is Yourself\n\nseason 3 television GIF Giphy\n\nI'm lazy and have a low self esteem.\n\nI'm also very asocial.\n\n\nUnable To Move On\n\nBecause my wife died.\n\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. My husband died seven years ago, and I've discovered that I prefer living alone. So I'll stay single for the rest of my life.\n\n\nWant to \"know\" more?

There are too many ways for someone to misinterpret what you\u2019ve written, so if you want to be clear, and you have something important to say, skip technology altogether and communicate live and in person.\n\n2Do respect your neighbors\n\nWith everyone and their grandmother walking around with a cell phone, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll be talking in public at some point, often several times a day. But if you\u2019re in a crowded space \u2013 a restaurant, on the bus \u2013 and you\u2019re loudly telling the world about your latest breakup, trust us when we tell you that you\u2019re annoying everyone around you. We\u2019re not saying don\u2019t take the call \u2013 just keep your voice down and respect those around you.\n\n3Don\u2019t text and walk\n\nYou may have mastered the fine art of walking and chewing gum, but walking while texting is a whole other matter. We\u2019ve all seen those people so engrossed in the message they\u2019re furiously typing that they trip (sending their precious phone sailing into the street) or bump into everyone they get near. If you need to send a text that can\u2019t wait \u2013 while you\u2019re in motion \u2013 stop and move to the side before typing.\n\n4Do have tech-free live conversations\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than trying to talk to someone who keeps checking their phone. They nod, they smile, they murmur the occasional, barely audible \u201cMmm-hmmm,\u201d but you know they\u2019re more interested in their phone than in what you have to say. If you\u2019re talking to a real person, put your phone away or train yourself not to look at it every two seconds. Stealing furtive glances at your iPhone just makes you look like you have a tic \u2013 not to mention it\u2019s rude. When someone is talking to you, make sure they have your full attention \u2013 and they have yours.\n\n5Don\u2019t send one-word emails\n\nUnless someone asks for confirmation that you received their email, try to avoid sending one word emails that say things like, \u201cgot it\u201d or \u201cOK!\u201d Short, succinct emails are fine, but just make sure they say something worthwhile. Otherwise you\u2019re just clogging the inboxes of your friends and co-workers and they probably aren\u2019t happy about it. If someone has asked you to do something, it\u2019s fine to send a few words letting them know that yes, you can take on that project or that you\u2019ve taken care of whatever they requested, but if no followup is necessary, keep the one-word messages to a minimum.\n\n6Do think before you post\n\nWhen it comes to social networking, it can be so easy to just post \u2013 status updates, tweets, photos, comments \u2013 without really thinking. But it\u2019s a good idea to think about whatever you\u2019re planning to send out into cyberspace before you publish it. Will that status update offend someone? Will the photos you\u2019re planning to post embarrass anyone? Take a minute to go over what you want to say or post before you do it to avoid any social networking slip-ups.\n\n7Don\u2019t have multiple conversations\n\nIt\u2019s common to see people talking on their cell phones while talking to someone right there in front of them. How is this possible? They simply talk \u2013 not indicating who they\u2019re talking to \u2013 and it\u2019s the job of everyone else to figure out who is being addressed. There\u2019s a lot of \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you\u201d and \u201cWere you talking to me?\u201d happening in that conversation and it can be tiresome. If someone comes up to you while you\u2019re on the phone, indicate you\u2019ll be with them in a moment. Politely end your call, then begin a new conversation. Trying to have two conversations at once is not only rude but a waste of other people\u2019s time.\n\nTell us\n\nWhat is your technology pet peeve?\n\nShare with us in the comments section below!\n\nMore about technology\n\n4 Gadgets to make traveling easier\nEco-friendly tech products we love\n5 Hot tech trends to watch\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nComments are closed.",

        "text":"Here's How Your Love Life Will Change For Better Or Worse In 2018, Based On Your Zodiac Sign\n\nThese days between Christmas and New Year's are good ones to reflect on the last year and think about what you want to do differently in the next. Get rest while you can. 2018 will be a big year for love on an individual and collective scale. Between now and next January, this is how your love life will change.\n\n2017 saw optimistic Jupiter move through Libra, the house of love and relationships. Jupiter will spend much of 2018 in Scorpio, which means that whatever relationships that were started in 2017 will experience terrifying, exciting, and stimulating growth. For those who are starting out 2018 single, it means that this will be your year to change the way you fall in and out of love.\n\nJupiter isn't the only planet that is going to have a lot to say about your love life this year. In October, Venus will go into retrograde, journeying over the territories of Libra and Scorpio not once, but twice. This means that your relationship is going to be experiencing a major overhaul that might be painful, but it will open you up to more nourishment in the end. This will be the year when all of the obstacles that get in the way of your love get thrown out. Knowing Scorpio, some skeletons will be revealed in the process. Here is what 2018 will change about your love life, if the stars have anything to say about it:\n\nAries (March 21 To April 19)\n\nIn the past, you've approached love like a big, bright torch, Aries. Your fire is beautiful, but when your blaze gets out of control, it burns up everything in your path. In 2017, you experienced some explosions. 2018 will take a cinder from the wreckage and set it alight into a smokey, smoldering flame. This is new for you, since you have the tendency to burn through relationships. Let your light be a lantern you hold aloft as you journey all the way into the deepest, darkest reaches of love.\n\nTaurus (April 20 To May 20)\n\n2018 will have you changing the ways you get your needs met in relationships, Taurus. This is the year that you will pick up a spade and start tending to your garden. Find what seeds have been buried under the earth, and then, plant them to make a fresh start. If you're in a long-term relationship, this might mean adding something new to your partnership through traveling together. And if you are single or you find your current love coming to a close, this would be a good time to start turning that compost.\n\nGemini (May 21 To June 20)\n\nIn years past, Gemini, love for you was like attending a masquerade ball. Each new relationship was like another dance partner. You'd change your mask at the start of each trip around the ballroom, based on what you thought your partner would find beautiful. Like it or not, 2018 is here to strip off your peacock feathers, Gemini, and lay bare your naked truth. For you, this will be the year you realize that simply being the life of the party doesn't earn you lasting love. Focus on the practical acts that will tend to your love each day, so the seeds of first attraction have a chance to grow into something more mature.\n\nCancer (June 21 To July 22)\n\nIn love, you have the tendency to mix metaphors, Cancer, but 2018 will have you learning to cut to the chase. You need to be honest about your relationships and let people know what you are actually thinking. You need to show up for your feelings instead of constantly disappearing when the going gets tough. This year, your love life is going to hold your feet to the fire in terms of building and maintaining inner peace. This is the year to enter into better communication with your own feelings so you can then share your water with someone you really trust.\n\nLeo (July 23 To August 22)\n\nYou've always prided yourself on being a loud, flashy lover, Leo. 2018 is going to have you getting in touch with your most basic sense of self. This is the year you are going to start patching some cracks in your foundation. In the past, you have approached loving as a charitable act. You think that you are the one to heal everyone else into loving themselves. This year, you start exercising more humility in your relationships. Until you save yourself, Leo, you aren't saving anyone.\n\nVirgo (August 23 To September 22)\n\nLove for you in 2018 has you feeling comfortable in your own house, Virgo. In years prior, you didn't feel like you had something you could count on. As soon as your relationship was stable, then your work or health would snatch something else out from under your feet. 2018 will change things up for you, Virgo, by giving you more chances to relax a little bit. You've fought hard to get here. Treat yourself to a spa trip.\n\nLibra (September 23 To October 22)\n\nFor you, Libra, 2018 will be a year of overturning how you take action in relationships. In the past, maybe you sunk into routine relationships that ended up suffocating you. Maybe you built an empire based on getting along well with others. This year is going to require you to change the way you approach conflict, Libra. Your good-natured tendencies are very sweet for others to experience, but in love and relationships, you have the tendency to let other people walk all over you. For your own sake, leave your passive good nature in 2017.\n\nScorpio (October 23 To November 21)\n\n2017 held up a magnifying glass on your own methods of self-sabotage, Scorpio. In the past, you've had the tendency to lash out when people get too close. In 2018, you will stop letting fear of abandonment control you. That means you'll have to take stock of your own stinger. Why do you insist on slicing even the people who actually value you? Can you find a way to ensure you are protected without pushing everyone who cares about you away?\n\nSagittarius (November 22 To December 21)\n\nYour love phases tend to last longer than some other signs, Sagittarius. This year will flip-flop whatever you have been doing for the last two-and-a-half years. 2018 will be a year when you end up saying goodbye to either the single life, a committed partnership, or something that's been keeping you back from being where you really need to be right now. If you've spent a great deal of time single or flitting from one relationship to another, this will be the year when you meet someone who actually makes you consider settling down. You build your life on experiences, Sagittarius, which means this change in routine will be a good thing for your ever-wondering mind. Sit back and see what there is to learn.\n\nCapricorn (December 22 To January 19)\n\nIn the past, you have always been careful with your words regarding love, Capricorn. This year, you are going to change your approach to communicating your intentions. When you start being a little more spontaneous, you'll find that there are lots of opportunities opening up to you. When you try to plan for every little twist and turn, you miss the here and now. And besides, plans are made to be broken. Instead of burying your head in the sand when things don't go your way, this year you will start seeing every one of your failures as perfection itself.\n\nAquarius (January 20 To February 18)\n\nLove can fulfill you, Aquarius, but it will evade you as long as you continue to give it your full attention. This is the year when you realize that your relationships work best when you have time to pick them up, permission to put them down, and permission to go off and do something else. In past years, you tried to chase what your ego wants, but in 2018, your approach changes as you finally learn how to keep your cool. Stop trying so hard, and love will keep coming back to you.\n\nPisces (February 19 To March 20)\n\nThe warm, healing energy that you emanate, Pisces, draws wounded people to you. They think you are a miracle worker. And you are, to a point, but you also need to give yourself some of your own medicine. In 2017, your healer tendencies have left you depleted, which means that you're better off in 2018 introducing a little bit of distance into your romantic relationships. This would be a good time to entertain an online connection or meet someone out of your usual routine, like in a class or on a business trip.\n\nCheck out the entire Gen Why series and other videos on Facebook and the Bustle app across Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.\n\nCheck out the \u201cBest of Elite Daily\u201d stream in the Bustle App for more stories just like this!",

        "text":"10 Best School Holiday Activities to Keep Your Kids Entertained at Home\n\nbyFelice Dominique Albay\n  \u2022 Sep 15, 2020\n  \u2022 7 mins\n\nEvery school holiday, Singaporean parents are left scratching their heads, wondering how to keep their kids occupied while staying at home.\u00a0If you\u2019re one of them, good thing is we\u2019ve come up with a list of activities that will not only keep your kids entertained, but also allow them to learn new skills as well.\n\n1. Learn a new, kid-friendly recipe\n\nCooking with your kid is a good school holiday activity.\nPlenty of kids love helping out in the kitchen. It feeds their love for exploration and gives them a sense of accomplishment, knowing that they had a part to play in whipping up a delicious meal. Aside from entertaining them, this is a good life skill for them to develop. There are several easy recipes available online that won\u2019t require them to handle anything too sharp or too hot. Who knows, you might have a future chef or baker in the making!\n\n\n2. Try to finish a new book every week\n\nYou\u2019re a lucky parent if your child already loves to read. Several studies have shown the importance of reading to kids, even at a young age. Considering how much time you\u2019ll likely spend at home these days, it\u2019s a great chance to encourage this habit. Set a goal for your child to finish at least one new book every week during the holidays.\u00a0\n\nIf your child hasn\u2019t yet developed a habit of reading books, then consider enforcing reading blocks. Fifteen to twenty minutes of reading time per day is a good start. Depending on the age of your child and reading proficiency, you can structure these reading blocks in a few ways:\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 You can read to your children\u00a0\n  \u2022 Your children can read aloud to you (if they\u2019re able to)\n  \u2022 Silent reading time for the whole family\n\nIf you have older kids, you can task them with giving you a brief summary of the book they\u2019ve read and what they\u2019ve learnt. This way, they\u2019ll be able to develop their reading habits and improve their comprehension skills while bonding with you.\u00a0\n\n3. Play board games with the whole family\n\nFamily playing board game together\n\nBoard games are a great way to bond with the family, especially if you have older kids. It\u2019s an excellent alternative to allowing your kids to lock themselves in their rooms with their gadgets. You\u2019ll be surprised to know that several board games offer kids a number of benefits:\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Opportunities for early learning \u2013 Board games can teach young kids to identify colours, count spaces, and develop hand-eye coordination. It\u2019s also a great way to teach them the value of patience by waiting for their turn \u2014 traits that will serve them well into their adulthood. Educational board games such as Scrabble for Kids and Zingo are also good choices for parents who want their kids to learn new words.\n  \u2022 Stimulates the brain \u2013 Strategy games encourage healthy brain development in young kids and teens. They help to improve critical thinking abilities, reading comprehension, and cognitive skills.\n  \u2022 Teaches valuable lessons \u2013 You might not have noticed, but board games have a way of teaching us important lessons like how your luck can change at any minute or how it\u2019s okay to lose sometimes. They can also teach kids to be gracious when it comes to winning or losing and help them to understand that things will not always go their way.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Teaches children to focus \u2013 Certain board games take a while to finish and when played uninterrupted, these can help lengthen a child\u2019s attention span. However, parents and older siblings should also lead by example by focusing on the game and avoid checking their phones or doing other activities during the game.\n\n4. Upcycle materials for arts & crafts\n\nNurture your child\u2019s creativity by introducing them to some arts and crafts activities during the school holidays. Aside from going out to buy materials, you can challenge your kids to use whatever is available at home. Empty water bottles, tissues boxes, paper plates, paper cups, and old crayons can be put to good use and test your kid\u2019s level of imagination are some materials you can work with. Work with your child to upcycle these and turn them into something fun! Furthermore, upcycling these materials is a good opportunity to teach your children about the three R\u2019s for the environment: reduce, reuse, and recycle.\n\n5. Start a reward system for doing house chores\n\nParents doing household chores with child\n\nWith the entire family home for the holidays, there\u2019s twice as much to do around the house. One good way to keep the kids occupied during the school holidays is to have them help with household chores.\n\nOne good way to help young kids ease into the habit of doing chores is to set up a reward system. This will get them to look forward to chipping in around the house. The rewards can be anything from getting to choose what to have for dinner, getting to choose a movie to watch, or an extra helping of dessert after dinner!\u00a0\n\n6. Have a themed movie marathon\n\nHave you ever spent the first 30 minutes of movie night just scrolling through Netflix unable to decide which movie to watch? Yes, we\u2019ve all been there! You can avoid this problem by setting a theme for every movie marathon or better yet, getting your kids to choose one. If you want to take it up a notch, get the family together to prepare snacks to match the movie marathon theme! Here are a few theme suggestions:\n\n  \u2022 Jungle Theme: Tarzan, Jungle Book, The Lion King\n  \u2022 Sea Theme: Finding Nemo, The Little Mermaid, Moana\n  \u2022 Monster Theme: Monsters, Inc., Monsters vs. Aliens, Hotel Transylvania \u00a0\n\n7. Scrapbooking\n\nIf your child has a knack for arts and crafts, you can help to nurture their interest during the holidays by encouraging to them to create a scrapbook of family photos! Scrapbooking is a great way to store memorable photos as opposed to just keeping them in a plain photo album. If you don\u2019t already have a scrapbook at home, your child can make one from scratch using some brightly coloured construction paper! You can bind them together by punching a hole on one corner of the construction paper and then loop a loose-leaf ring through them. Scrapbooking will help you and your kids bond as you look back on all the memories you\u2019ve made together!\u00a0\n\n8. Try out some cool science experiments at home\n\nIf you want to do something fun and educational, then try doing a few science experiments with your kids at home. These experiments ensure that kids continue to learn something new and keep their minds active even while on holiday. Consider letting your child pick the science experiment or you can pick one together if you have a younger child. Try creating gooey slime, making your own lava lamp or creating a solar oven!\n\n9. Shoot a short movie\/role-playing\n\nPlaying dress up with your child is a great idea for the school holidays.\nIf it feels like you\u2019ve watched every kids\u2019 show that\u2019s available on Netflix, maybe it\u2019s time to consider creating your family\u2019s very own show with your kids! Shooting a short movie will definitely get your kids excited and unearth their creativity and imagination in no time. In fact, several studies reveal that role-playing can positively impact a child\u2019s social, emotional, and cognitive development. One idea is to re-enact a scene from your kid\u2019s favourite book! You can even help your kid make up the story and you can act it out together.\n\n10. Set up an indoor scavenger hunt\n\nHaving a scavenger hunt at home is another great boredom buster for kids. What\u2019s great about indoor scavenger hunts is that they\u2019re inexpensive, easy, and can be done with things you already have at home. However, instead of just picking out random things at home, you can add an interesting twist to your scavenger hunt. H\n\nStay safe at home with Income\u2019s Personal Accident Assurance\n\nWhile you may view your home as the safest place there is, kids do tend to be more accident-prone. Protect yourself and your family\u2019s well-being with Income\u2019s Personal Accident (PA) Assurance which covers accident-incurred injuries such as from falls and versatile coverage for permanent disability and medical expenses due to accidents. Coverage against 21 Infectious Diseases such as Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, and Dengue Fever can be added on too.

No friend in the group is similar and with everyone so different, there are bound to be fireworks along the way. The fuss and the excitement created by each of these species promises us nothing short of a trunkful of unforgettable memories.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the different types of friends that may exist in your group.\n\nThe Checklist\n\nGetting ready for the trip\nSource \u2013\u00a0The Legacy Project\n\nThis perpetual planner who makes meticulous contingency plans that rival the Sergeant\u2019s plans for a military coup. The lists will have lists which will drive the other friends crazy with it. But let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s that saviour\u2019s planning that will make the vacation a bit sane and will fix anything that goes wrong.\n\n\nThe Madcap\n\nAdventure is in the blood\nSource \u2013 travel.jumia.com\n\nThis friend with his \u2018dekh lenge yaar\u2019 attitude is the one who will forget to fill the petrol tank of the car to maximum on the road trip. It is this friend who\u2019ll think of it as an adventure when you lose your way and get lost either in the midst of a desert or a jungle. Looking for a rainbow at the end of a storm, the pal\u2019s optimism and carelessness will get on the troupe\u2019s nerves. But those antics will ensure an unforgettable journey.\n\n\nThe Dopey\n\nReady. Steady. Sleep.\nSource \u2013 disney.wikia.com\n\nYou are envious of this friend\u2019s ability to sleep anytime and anywhere. There might be a hard rock metal concert going on but will still be able to stretch out on the ground and pass out in seconds. But this lazy bum is going to irritate you with the habit of getting up at noon and being tired by doing even the tiniest of the things and wanting long naps.\n\n\nThe Juicehead\n\nWith a bottomless pit for alcohol and the motto in life, Daaru toh banti hai, this friend will be having a variety of booze bottles in different sizes at all times and will find the trip a waste if at least one bottle is not downed each day.\n\n\n\u00a0The Umpire\n\nLiving each moment\nSource \u2013 igotravel.co.za\n\nThe most sensible friend in the whole group, who is constantly trying to broker peace. The one who is constantly trying to mediate and coming up with compromises to satisfy everyone. This referee makes the trip a success by seeing to it that all the characters of the group don\u2019t end up killing each other.\n\n\nThe Workaholic\n\nReady to rule the world\nSource \u2013 hungryshark.ru\n\nThis slave to the work will be constantly on the phone and checking the mails. This lost comrade will be counting down the hours to get back to the office\u2019s distasteful coffee. The one who is always cribbing about not getting enough days off from work but once on the trip, will be raring to go back.\n\n\nThe Lovey-Dovey\n\nThis couple is busy turning the group trip into their honeymoon rendezvous. While they are indulging in their PDA, the group will give them either a wide berth or rag them, depending on the friends and the mood.\n\n\n\u00a0The Diva\n\nHead out of the city for your next kitty party!\nThe absolute Diva taking the center stage anywhere, everywhere\n\nThat snooty friend who is finding faults at every step of the way and will be expected to treated as royalty. From the linen of the bed to the water in the bathroom, from the food to the decor of the hotel, this friend will criticise till the tongue falls off. The Diva is the one who always wants to be the centre of attention.\n\n\nThe Luna Lovegood\n\nThe Luna Lovegood of the group is the one who actually believes in nargles and will be waging a war against the wrackspurts. The weirdo who is in another part of the universe, will spout out a philosophical comment and then go back to dreaming.\n\n\nThe Hermit\n\nBuilding dream castles\nSource \u2013 Rockpage.me\n\nThis lone wolf of the group is the one who is busy creating a utopia. Although with the group, this lost soul is still alone with the headphones on or is busy getting lost in the book. To talk to your buddy you\u2019ll be constantly pulling the headphones or snatching away the ever so interesting book and shouting at the top of your voice to get your buddy\u2019s attention.\n\nSo, do you recognise any one of your homie?

This can work in your favor, or against you, depending on the way you look at it. You need to make the most of this situation, and get to know her inside out. One of the ways to achieve this, is through constant questioning.\nWhat to Take Care Of\nshut up\nBe random and imaginative in your approach, and forget all conditions of normality. Be warned though, that there is a fine line between being abstract, and being perverted. Tread that line with caution.\nBe Spontaneous\nshut up\nBeing stuck in the middle of a conversation with nothing to say, is not a very pleasant scenario for most, as they may end up feeling completely undermined and foolish. To avoid facing such an occurrence, and other related relationship issues, you have to do your homework, and you have to do it right. You need to be spontaneous, and not sound like a prerecorded android that has downloaded an extensive list of conversation starters in its head, the night before.\nAsk About Her\nIt goes without saying, that the source of principal happiness for any woman is realized when she talks about herself and this acts as a great conversation starter for any guy wishing to spark a great conversation with a woman.\nboy proposing girl\nYou can ask something very simple like \"What is your worst nightmare?\", or you could adopt a different approach, and ask her some thought provoking questions like \"As a child, what did you want to become when you grew up?\"\nThe key to a healthy relationship, is to know each other inside out. Ask her about her siblings, her childhood memories, her fears, things she's passionate about, her embarrassing moments; the list is endless. Keep in mind, that she wants you to be interested in her thoughts and feelings, but at the same time, not be judgmental about them.\nscary woman\nPass a judgment only on rare occasions, because by doing so, you're running a very high risk of being faced by an endless barrage of verbal assault, along with an unlimited supply of scorn-filled glances. Here are some suitable examples for you.\nfear of dark\nHas the fear of the dark ever overcome your senses completely?\n~ What is your idea of true love and do you think it can ever be unconditional?\n\n~ What is more important to you, money or happiness, and can they both co-exist?\n\n~ Do you have a strong recollection of certain memories from your childhood from time to time?\n\n~ If you could picture your life forty years from now, what would you see?\nAsk About Yourself\nYou can ask her questions pertinent to you, and your role in her life. Maybe you could ask her what her first impression of you was, or you can conjure up some hypothetical scenarios, and ask her how she would react if you ended up behaving in a certain way, or saying certain things. You could even go ahead and ask her where she sees your relationship heading. But such questions usually result in a very somber and serious tone. Do not ask her if she feels that you have some habits which she wishes to change, as you may not like what you'll hear subsequently.\nWould you be comfortable if I developed a very strong bond with your best friend?\n~ If your partner ended up cheating on you, what would you do?\n\n~ If we were married and I got my dream job on another continent, would you leave your life behind and accompany me?\n\n~ What are the qualities you want in your partner, and do you feel that I can live up to those expectations?\n\n~ If I were an astronaut and had to leave the planet for a suicidal mission, would you mourn my loss or wait for me indefinitely?\nAsk About Her Friends or Family\ncrazy things\nYou could begin by asking her \"What is the craziest thing you've ever done with your friends?\" or you could even ask her who her closest friends are, and what she likes the most about them. Talk about what kind of rapport she wants you and her friends to share, but do not get over inquisitive about her friends, as it will annoy her. Be cautious in your approach, and do not get carried away, or ramble on with question after question, and sound like a game show host.\nYou could inquire about her family and the family members whom she is closest to. If you are thinking about a long-term relationship with her, then this is an area of her life that you will need to know more about sooner or later, so you may as well start as soon as possible.\nOut of all the people closest to you, who is the one person you can confide in completely?\n~ If your parents got a divorce who would you rather live with?\n\n~ If you could have a relationship with one male friend of yours, who would that be?\n\n~ If you could give up all of your friends for $5 million, would you agree?\n\n~ Which family member of yours would you name your child after?\nPlace the interesting questions in one of these categories, and think them over in your head before you go ahead and actually ask them. Over a period of time, you'll know how to ask genuinely intellectual questions that are fun to answer and help you to get to know her better. Here are some examples that you can take guidance from.\nsuper girl\nWho was your favorite cartoon character as a child?\n~ Which nickname did you hate the most when you were a child?\n\n~ Which is your favorite curse word?\n\n~ If you were to be marooned on an island with one person of your choice, who would it be?\n\n~ Do you pick your nose and rub it on the couch when no one is looking?\n\n~ What's the worst habit that you feel you have?\n\n~ If you could be anywhere in the world right this instant, where would you be?\n\n~ Can you see dead people?\nsuper girl\nWhat's the dumbest question you've ever been asked?\n~ If you could have any superpower you wish, what would it be?\n\n~ Which actor do you think is the most good looking?\n\n~ If that actor and your best friend were hanging over a cliff, and you could save only one of them, who would you save?\n\n~ Would you rather live in the mountains, or by the sea?\n\n~ Have you ever thrown up on somebody else?\n\n~ If you're having a miserable day and need to vent it out, whom do you call?\nYou could actively use your imagination and come up with a lot more fun questions to ask your girlfriend. Remember not to cross the line though, and don't ask things that are just plain juvenile and sadistic.",

        "text":"What Parents Can Learn from Their Kids: A Fresh Perspective\n\nIn May, my team and I completed\u00a030 interviews with inspiring moms\u00a0across the country. We got so much information and learned about how mommies literally manage their homes. I want to recap some of my favorite moments and share their insight on what they learned from their kids. Here is a list of some of my favorite take aways from our interviews.\n\n\nCelebrate accomplishments together.\n\nWhat did you learn from your kids?\n\n  1. Take risks!\u00a0Kids are fearless and we need to do that more in our own lives.\n  2. Everything is temporary. You can only pay attention to what is happening right now.\n  3. Kids teach us how to love, how to feel sadness, and JOY!\u00a0Take in their new perception on life and see what really matters.\n  4. Simplify! You can\u2019t control anything. Let it go! Our kids are gifts and they are not our property.\n  5. Love fiercely and\u00a0completely!\u00a0Patience is really all about practice.\n  6. There is not always a direct path from A to B; the detours are the best part. You can\u2019t plan for everything. Even though you still try to, you just can\u2019t.\n  7. Beauty comes from the inside. Strength is something you must become. Honesty is a gift that will never fail you.\n  8. Dance like no one is watching!\u00a0Learn how to be silly. As parents, love life the way your kids do and don\u2019t care what others think when you sing out loud.\n  9. Unconditional love.\u00a0Laugh, love, and be in the moment.\n  10. Never criticize.\u00a0Be the voice in your kids\u2019 lives and not the judge.\nSnacks are best enjoyed on a step outside.\n\nSnacks are best enjoyed on a step outside.\n\n\nWords are not always needed to bond.\n\nKids are the best teachers. They are unbiased and see the world for it\u2019s natural and simplistic beauty. They are able to easily find happiness and stay grounded in those moments. It is difficult to apply all of these insights at once, but if we take a moment to look at the world from our kids eyes each day, we may be able to add an extra dose of happiness into our own lives.\n\n\nWhen all else fails\u2026make someone laugh with a Popeye face!\n\nUntil Next Time\u2026\nKortney Peagram\nBe Strong*Be Brave*Be a Bulldog\n\nIf you like what you read, please like\u00a0Bulldog Solution\u00a0on Facebook\n\nType your email address in the box and click the \u201ccreate subscription\u201d button.

Their negative attitude is toxic to your own moods, and you probably feel like there is little you can do about it.\n\nBut that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.\n\nIf you want to effectively deal with negative people and be a champion of positivity, then your best route is to take definite action through some of the steps below.\n\n1. Limit the time you spend with them.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get this out of the way. You can be more positive than a cartoon sponge, but even your enthusiasm has a chance of being afflicted by the constant negativity of a friend.\n\n\nIn fact, negativity has been proven to damage your health physically, making you vulnerable to high levels of stress and even cardiac disease. There\u2019s no reason to get hurt because of someone else\u2019s bad mood.\n\nThough this may be a little tricky depending on your situation, working to spend slightly less time around negative people will keep your own spirits from slipping as well.\n\n2. Speak up for yourself.\n\nDon\u2019t just absorb the comments that you are being bombarded with, especially if they are about you. It\u2019s wise to be quick to listen and slow to speak, but being too quiet can give the person the impression that you are accepting what\u2019s being said.\n\n3. Don\u2019t pretend that their behavior is \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nThis is an easy trap to fall into. Point out to the person that their constant negativity isn\u2019t a good thing. We don\u2019t want to do this because it\u2019s far easier to let someone sit in their woes, and we\u2019d rather just stay out of it.\n\n\nBut if you want the best for this person, avoid giving the false impression that their negativity is normal.\n\n4. Don\u2019t make their problems your problems.\n\nThough I consider empathy a gift, it can be a dangerous thing. When we hear the complaints of a friend or family member, we typically start to take on their burdens\u00a0with\u00a0them.\n\nThis is a bad habit to get into, especially if this is a person who is almost exclusively negative. These types of people are prone to embellishing and altering a story in order to gain sympathy.\n\nWhy else would they be sharing this with you?\n\n\n5.\u00a0Change the subject.\n\nWhen you suspect that a conversation is starting to take a turn for the negative, be a champion of positivity by changing the subject. Of course, you have to do this without ignoring what the other person said.\n\nAcknowledge their comment, but move the conversation forward before the euphoric pleasure gained from complaining takes hold of either of you.\n\n6.\u00a0Talk about solutions, not problems.\n\nSometimes, changing the subject isn\u2019t an option if you want to deal with negative people, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be positive.\n\nI know that when someone begins dumping complaints on me, I have a hard time knowing exactly what to say. The key is to measure your responses as solution-based.\n\n\nYou can do this by asking questions like, \u201cWell, how could this be resolved?\u201d or, \u201cHow do you think they feel about it?\u201d\n\nUse discernment to find an appropriate response that will help your friend manage their perspectives.\n\n7. Leave them behind.\n\nSadly, there are times when we have to move on without these friends, especially if you have exhausted your best efforts toward building a positive relationship.\n\nIf this person is a family member, you can still have a functioning relationship with them, of course, but you may still have to limit the influence they have over your wellbeing.\n\nThat being said, what are some steps you\u2019ve taken to deal with negative people? Let us know in the comments.\n\nYou may also want to read:\u00a0How to Stop the Negative Spin of Thoughts, Emotions and Actions.\n\nRead Next",

        "text":"10 Uncomfortable Signs That Your Relationship Is Wrong For You\n\nafter-breakupYou can\u2019t be so immature to believe that just because you\u2019re helplessly in love with a person automatically translates to the two of you having a healthy relationship. In fact, a lot of times, people fall in love with individuals who are just downright wrong for them. And when that happens, it\u2019s always best to call it quits no matter how counter-intuitive it may seem to walk away from someone you\u2019re deeply in love with. It\u2019s better for all parties involved to just not be selfish about it. No matter how much you would want a relationship to work out, sometimes it\u2019s just not meant to be. Here are 10 uncomfortable signs that your relationship is wrong for you.\n\n1. Your friends and family don\u2019t approve of the relationship.\n\nWhile you shouldn\u2019t let your friends and family by making your own personal decisions for you, that doesn\u2019t mean you should be totally disregarding their sentiments about how you live your life. We are all human beings and we all need the perspective of others to survive. Sometimes, your biases could potentially blind you from the fact that you\u2019re in a bad relationship.\n\n2. You never feel completely comfortable with just being yourself when you\u2019re together.\n\nIn any relationship, you should always be made to feel like you can be yourself. You should never have to feel like you have to censor or suppress who you really are on the inside. Your partner should always be pushing and encouraging you to just be your natural self. They should make you feel comfortable with just being who you are.\n\n3. You are constantly afraid of being judged in the relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for us to always want the people we love to think highly of us. This serves as a form of motivation for us to always try to be better human beings. We never want to be a disappointment especially to the people we love. However, that doesn\u2019t mean we should be living in constant fear of judgment from the people we love the most.\n\n4. You see spending time with one another as a chore.\n\nTime is valuable and we never want to waste it on people, things, or activities that aren\u2019t important to us. So if you feel like spending time with your partner is more of a burden than it is a pleasure, then there\u2019s something really wrong with your relationship. That tells you that you don\u2019t really find it important to spend time with each other at all.\n\n5. You never feel like you are satisfied in bed.\n\nSexual satisfaction is always important in a relationship, especially in modern ones. Sex is a great tool for building physical intimacy with another person. It also helps build on trust, respect, and vulnerability in the relationship. So if the sex isn\u2019t good in a romantic relationship, it might be hard to sustain that passion for one another in the long run.\n\n6. You always feel exhausted and overwhelmed when you\u2019re together.\n\nRelationships were never designed to be easy. You always have to work hard to keep love alive. You always have to fight to keep someone you love in your life. But it also doesn\u2019t mean that life has to be hard and exhausting all the time. If the relationship is constantly making you tired, then maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s a toxic one.\n\n7. You don\u2019t feel motivated to put the effort into the relationship anymore.\n\nIf you were in a truly happy and healthy relationship, then you wouldn\u2019t really have any trouble trying to find motivation to work for it. The relationship is all about the grind of everyday life with the person that you love. But if you feel like you lack the motivation to keep things going, then the relationship is in real trouble.\n\n8. You don\u2019t really see your partner at your side when you think about the future.\n\nPart of being in a long-term relationship is being able to envision a happy and healthy future with the person you love at your side. But if you\u2019re unable to do plan out a future with your partner in mind, it may be because your relationship has no future at all.\n\n9. You secretly get relieved whenever they cancel on you.\n\nYou dread whatever time you have with one another because you know that something is just off. You see the time that you spend together as just more potential opportunities for shared awkwardness and bitterness. So you secretly hope that you don\u2019t have to spend time with each other anymore.\n\n10. Your instinct is telling you that something is definitely off.\nQuickest Ways To End A Fight\n\nAnd lastly, trust your gut. It\u2019s looking out for you. It only wants the best for you and you would be a fool to not pay it any mind. Trust your instincts. If your gut is telling you that there\u2019s something wrong, then it\u2019s highly likely that that\u2019s the case.",

Read More\n\nBy \/ June 20, 2017\n\nIn a late night experimental mood, I decided to see what the dating app life has to offer in terms of Jewish dudes out there, since in theory I would like to meet a fellow member of the tribe, or as one of my best friends calls them, \u201cboychiks.\u201d So I downloaded JSwipe and set up a profile.\n\nI\u2019m not impressed, folks. I have been on this app for less than 12 hours and already I have a LOT of advice for you, dudes. And I\u2019m not even talking about the shirtless pics. Because everyone\u2019s probably already told you to stop that. No disrespect meant to your hot Israeli IDF bod \u2014\u00a0it is quite spiffy, but JSwipe isn\u2019t really Grindr.\n\nHere are some other things you should really not be doing:\n\n1.\u00a0No bio.\n\nI mean, come on. Even if your pics are hot as hell, if I have no clue who you are, bye. This is basically 80-90% of profiles I\u2019ve seen.\n\n2. A bio that just says \u201cI hate bios\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s too much about me to fit into a bio.\u201d\n\nOy, aren\u2019t you special. Newsflash: we all hate condensing ourselves into a tiny pinprick but hello, if I can be bothered to put in the effort, so can you. Put on your big boy pants and deal with it. And yeah, I would hope there\u2019s more to you than can fit in a bio, but if you can\u2019t even come up with enough info or personality to fill half a phone screen, things are not looking great for the rest of you.\n\n3. A bio of only emojis.\n\nWow. Much impress. \u201cThat menorah emoji really speaks to my soul,\u201d said no one ever.\n\n4. One word bios.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d \u201cAdventure.\u201d \u201c.\u05e8\u05b0\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u201d \u201cCPA.\u201d \u201cNJB [Nice Jewish Boy].\u201d \u201cINFP.\u201d If you\u2019re going to use one word, it had better be something that represents you, and if these are the most interesting things you can say about yourself, that does not bode well.\n\n(Fun fact: The Most Interesting Man in the World is Jewish. Up your game.)\n\n5. Bios that say, \u201cI\u2019m new at this!\u201d and nothing else.\n\nWell, guess what, boychik \u2013 so am I, and I\u2019m already way better at it than you.\n\n6. Bios that place a weird emphasis on your height.\n\nLike either it\u2019s the only thing in the bio, or one of less than 5 characteristics you\u2019ve listed. I get that we are a people populated by men of small stature, so you feel special if you\u2019re 6 feet tall, but again, if your height is the most interesting thing about you, you need some more hobbies. (I don\u2019t care at all about height so personally any bio with height listed makes me roll my eyes.)\n\n7. Bios that tell me you have a sense of humor but back it up with nothing.\n\nJust because comedy and sarcasm is seemingly hardwired into our ancient culture and our less ancient celebrity icons, does not mean that you are automatically gifted with it. I too can claim to have a sense of humor. I included examples of it in my bio. Did you?\n\n8. Bios that include one sentence about you and then a trite inspirational quote.\n\nGreat, I can have a date with my shul\u2019s wall calendar that has as much to say as you do.\n\n9. Bios where your primary interest is traveling.\n\nLook, traveling is great. I\u2019ve done it. I too have pictures of myself surrounded by Jerusalem stone and silhouetted against the Western Wall! Imagine that. But I want to know what makes you interesting aside from the places you can afford to visit. I want to know that if we\u2019re stuck at home, you have enough conversation skills that I won\u2019t be bored to tears. Travel is not a substitute for personality.\n\n10. Bios that start in on what \u201cmost girls\u201d like or want and how you\u2019re different and special and shouldn\u2019t be judged by the standards \u201cmost girls\u201d use.\n\nJust stop. Your bio is a space to tell me about you, not about all your past failures with women and your subsequent bitterness and Nice Guy Syndrome, you schmuck.\n\nSarah Meira (SM) Rosenberg is a jill-of-all-trades, including but not limited to: publicist for the bestselling\u00a0Unofficial Hogwarts Haggadah, co-host of the\u00a0Nice Jewish Fangirls\u00a0podcast, freelance editor, former teen\u00a0novelist, and retired auto mechanic.

        "text":"Lesser-Known Georgetown Traditions\n\nLesser Known Traditions\n\nKicking off Homecoming weekend this Friday is Traditions Day 2014, taking place on Copley Lawn. From noon\u00a0to 3 p.m., you\u2019ll be able to enjoy free GUGS burgers, a cappella performances from several groups and (obviously) free T-shirts. More information can be found on the Facebook event, but it\u2019s sure to be an awesome afternoon.\n\nWhile the day is meant to celebrate some of Georgetown\u2019s famous traditions, 4E is here to add some newer, lesser-known traditions that you might not have heard of yet.\n\nThe counter at Epi\u00a0\n\nEveryone know about the tradition of sitting on John Carroll\u2019s lap that every freshman partakes in because that\u2019s been the tradition for years now. With Epi open\u00a024\/7\u00a0you can partake in the\u00a0tradition of sitting on Epi\u2019s counter at 2 a.m. until a cashier inevitably asks you to to get off. Plus, the counter\u00a0has the added benefit of being a little easier to get onto than John Carroll.\n\nThe\u00a0line at Eat & Joy\u00a0\n\nMost recent grads and current juniors and seniors remember the glory of Tuscany, which was put out of business unceremoniously over the summer of 2013. Eat & Joy has stepped up to the plate to fill the void left by Tuscany, and (assuming they don\u2019t also mysteriously go out of business one day soon) they have\u00a0become the newest Georgetown tradition.\n\nThe Healy tunnels\n\nDisclaimer: 4E does not condone trespassing. With construction all over campus (I think I\u2019ve reached my limit for complaining about this), there\u2019s no way to access the Reiss rooftop anymore; the Healy tunnels are just waiting at the heart of campus to be discovered!\n\nThe Hot Chick\n\nDuring practically every tour of Georgetown\u2019s campus and neighborhood, prospective freshmen hear about the Chicken Madness at Wisey\u2019s and how it\u2019s a must-have. In my two years here, though, I have come to largely prefer the Hot Chick for its simplicity and originality. If you haven\u2019t had it yet, you need to get one (or three, and eat them all in one sitting).\n\nWhile you might not have heard of some of these traditions until now, we can guarantee you\u2019ll soon be making them a part of your usual Georgetown tradition routine.\u00a0So, on Friday for Traditions Day and throughout Homecoming Weekend, inaugurate these newfound traditions as an integral part of your Hilltop experience.\n\nGifs: imgur.com; Photo: georgetown.edu\n\nLeave a Reply",
