        "text":"Union troops and gunboats made Civil War Yorktown a launching pad for Federal power\n\nDespite the confusion that gripped the Army of the Potomac during its August 1862 withdrawal from the outskirts of Richmond, one thing remained clear.\n\nSo critical a role did the deep-water port at Yorktown play in Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan\u2019s failed Peninsula Campaign that \u2014 even after retreating down the James River to Fort Monroe \u2014 he issued repeated commands urging that the run-down bastion be rebuilt and defended.\n\n\u201cPush the work laid out by the engineer officers with the utmost rapidity,\u201d McClellan ordered on Aug. 22, while waiting to depart from Old Point Comfort.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of vital importance that the (work) details be furnished and the work done in the shortest possible time,\u201d he added later that day.\n\n\u201cIt is imperatively necessary that the work required should be pushed forward with the utmost vigor.\u201d\n\nWhat the Union got when the soldiers of the 4th Corps finished was a strong forward outpost that repeatedly confirmed McClellan\u2019s vision.\n\nFort Yorktown not only provided a crucial harbor for the Federal blockade of the York River and the Chesapeake Bay but also a springboard for expeditions to the Middle Peninsula and Richmond.\n\nIt also became a vital magnet and refuge for thousands of runaway slaves, depriving the Confederacy of badly needed food supplies and labor.\n\n\u201cYorktown posed a constant threat to Richmond both because of its proximity by land and the ease with which you could send large numbers of troops from its wharves to the Richmond & York River Railroad on the Pamunkey River,\u201d historian John V. Quarstein says, describing the historic Civil War stronghold that Colonial National Historical Park will recreate Saturday and Sunday through the living history programs of \u201cFort Yorktown Sesquicentennial Weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have been even more important had the North had more enterprising commanders and used its resources better.\u201d\n\nYou can find the rest of my story on Fort Yorktown and the living history celebration planned by Colonial National Historical Park for the town's historic area this weekend in the Thursday or Friday paper.\n\nClick here to see a photo gallery of archival images documenting the stronghold during the Civil War.\n\n-- Mark St. John Erickson\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018, CT Now",

Former president Jimmy Carter, smiling charismatically, symbolically handed over the Panama Canal -- which is a few miles away from Fairchild's lovely girlhood home -- to Panama's president, Mireya Moscoso.\n\n\"It is yours,\" Carter said.\n\nThat Dec. 14 ceremony forshadowed what will happen today, when the United States officially relinquishes ownership of the canal and the beautifully landscaped communities surrounding it -- the Panama Canal Zone.\n\nMegan, sitting beside her mother as she stared at the screen, could see that Fairchild's heart was breaking. \"Mom,\" she begged, \"don't cry. It's okay.\"\n\nBut Megan couldn't comprehend that the most delightful part of her mother's childhood was being wiped out. Washington residents who migrated from the Zone -- they call themselves Zonians -- say anyone who hasn't lived in the 50-mile-long, 10-mile-wide Canal Zone can't possibly understand.\n\n\"I was in a funk all day,\" Fairchild said. \"It just seemed like part of my past was going away.\"\n\n\"When you try to explain it to someone who didn't live there,\" said Evelyn Sellers, of Manassas, \"they look at you like you're from another world.\" In a way, Zonians are from another world. They are very average Americans who lived almost like royalty in a paradise.\n\nLori Geiger, now a District resident, said her parents rented a house on land \"that's probably worth millions today.\" At dusk, the family would often lounge in an immense back yard, sipping iced tea under mango and coconut trees while watching the sun dip below the Bay of Panama at the mouth of the canal.\n\n\"It was beautiful,\" Geiger said. She cried when the Army reassigned her father to Fort Bragg, N.C., after three years in the Zone. \"It was May 30, 1978, on my birthday. I'd had some good friends and good times.\"\n\nFairchild's family home in the Canal Zone had a maid's quarters, like most other houses. \"We all had gardeners and maids,\" Fairchild said. \"Here, we're barely middle-class.\" As the rich do in movies, Zonians often claim that the help were not like workers. They were more like family.\n\nOrion Cronin Hyson's father, a ship pilot, had a house with a living room \"that opened to a patio that opened to a garden where there was a swiming pool with a waterfall. A baby pool went to a main swimming pool. It was living space.\"\n\nHyson, now of Bethesda, called the Zone \"an American socialist utopia\" because of its sultry tropical setting and the way it was meticulously run by an all-powerful U.S. government company called the Panama Canal Commission.\n\nThe PCC controlled the narrow isthmus. Along with operating the canal and collecting shipping tolls, it ran a strict community police force, built housing and managed the environment. It hired an army of workers who attended to every detail of the canal and its lush bedroom community, supplying everything from food to plumbers.\n\nEach week, gardeners worked on the Zonians' shrubs, courtesy of the PCC. The yardwork -- intended largely to help control mosquitoes that carried yellow fever and other diseases -- created a \"Fantasy Island\" aesthetic. The result was 50 square miles of manicured lawns greener, Zonians say, than anything on the mainland.\n\n\"Everybody's yard had flowers and shrubs that were maintained by the U.S. government,\" said Darrow Cronin, sister of Orion Cronin Hyson. \"It looked like a biological park.\"\n\nThe lawns and hedges pressed against jungle, and Zonians relaxed and fell asleep to the chattering of exotic birds, crickets and monkeys. It was an almost perfect world, a community so close that even in 1985, Zonians say, they identified more with the 1950s \"Leave It to Beaver\" version of America than with the popular \"Family Ties\" of that time.\n\nBut there was a price to pay for the Zone's 1 million Army personnel, civilian workers and their children. Many kids feared that the commission would ship out their family if they misbehaved.\n\nDarrow Cronin, for one, never felt that kind of pressure. \"It was not a police state,\" she said at her home in Alexandria. Cronin is a distinguished Zonian, a former homecoming queen at Balboa High School. She fervently supports America's involvement in Panama, and believes handing over the canal is a mistake.\n\n\"The political importance, the safety importance, the military importance is really misunderstood,\" she said. \"We created something that wasn't there already. We built beautiful houses and grocery stores. We created neighborhoods. We added a tremendous amount of value and life enhancement features to that country.\"\n\nBut the canal was built on Panamanian land. Carter believed that owning a territory that ran the length of Panama shamed America, prompting him to sign the controversial treaty that led to today's handover.\n\nIn 1977, Carter said that the canal accords signed in 1903 were unjust and that the United States \"did not understand clearly enough that the arrangement defined a certain element of colonialism.\"\n\nMost Panamanians hated the Zonians and considered them arrogant, said Juan Manuel Handal, who publishes an Internet newsletter about Panama. He recalled that many Americans never bothered to learn Spanish.\n\nDirectly across from the Canal Zone was the poverty of Panama City, which many Zonians ignored, even as the psychological gap between them and the Panamanians widened.\n\nWhether driving or traveling by foot, Panamanians were forced to pass through U.S. territory to get to the other side of their own country. \"I always felt a country within a country was not right,\" said Tom Sellers, of Manassas, who lived in the Zone for decades when his father worked for the PCC.\n\nBob Karrer, an amateur Zone historian and former Army lieutenant colonel who taught at the School of the Americas, is one of the few Zonians who, like Carter, believed that handing over the canal was good policy.\n\nStrategically, he said, the canal is \"not as important as it once was. None of our aircraft carriers can go through it. They're too big. I tell Zoneys: 'You really need to get over this. You can't turn back time.' In many ways, I'm a voice in the wilderness.\"\n\nWilderness is what the Panama Canal came from. The French, builders of Egypt's Suez Canal, first attempted the massive dig, starting in the 1880s. They failed miserably. Their digging machines bit gnat-like into the mud. Worse, workers and their families died horribly because the French failed to control mosquitoes carrying fever and malaria.\n\nThe United States took over the project in 1904. The Americans had learned from French mistakes, and they possessed more powerful machines. Slowly, the earth opened. The digging involved as many as 50,000 men at a time.\n\nRoughly 5,600 died during 10 years of construction. Ninety percent of the workers were black West Indians, many of whom died in the explosions that created Culebra Cut, a snaking nine-mile canyon at the Continental Divide. They mostly came from Jamaica and Barbados, in search of better pay. When the work was done, many returned home rather than live in black shanty towns that contrasted sharply with the spacious quarters built for whites and their families.\n\nIn those days, Panamanians welcomed Americans and their creation, sometimes called the Eighth Wonder of the World.\n\nBut that was then. More than eight decades later, Panamanians want control of their land. Most workers in the Panama Canal Commission are now Panamanian as U.S. citizens are being phased out.\n\nZonians complain openly that Panamanians will ruin the canal because they won't pay as much attention to detail as Americans. However, said Karrer, the amateur historian, \"the British said the same thing when the Egyptians took over the Suez Canal,\" which is running fine after 30 years in Egyptian hands.\n\nIn 1964, a group of Panamanian students who tried to hoist their flag at Balboa High School were attacked by Zonians. The incident led to riots, and Panamanian nationalists embarked on a drive to take over the canal.\n\nFifteen years later, after six years of negotiations, Carter signed a treaty. Most Zonians moved to states with sultry climates, such as California, Texas and Florida. They've set up Internet Web sites to give cyberhugs to long-lost friends.\n\nBut paradise was lost. What many found instead was culture shock.\n\nFor Orion Cronin Hyson, it meant life without warmth and friends. \"The States for me meant my mother's family farm in upstate New York, which was cold,\" Hyson said. \"Often it was gray. I was used to being surrounded by people -- a gardener, a nanny, a washerwoman who was around twice a week. In the States, we didn't have help.\"\n\n\"It's sad,\" said Geiger, recalling her three years in the Zone. \"It's as if something's been taken from me that I can never get back again. It's as if someone has wiped the community off the face of the planet. It's kind of spooky. It's kind of weird. It's as if someone has died.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 1999 The Washington Post Company\n\nNavigation Bar\nNavigation Bar\nYellow Pages",

        "text":"Visitors To Drayton Hall Sneak A Peek At History\n\nMay 18, 1986|By Tom Belden, KNT News Service\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 In a city full of historic homes and beautifully restored buildings, it is a challenge to find a place that stands out. But Charleston has such a home, and it's safe to say there probably is no other structure in this country quite like it.\n\nThe house is Drayton Hall Plantation, on the banks of the Ashley River north of the city, an incredibly preserved piece of pre-Revolutionary War history. Completed in 1742, Drayton Hall is considered to be the earliest and finest Georgian-Palladian-style villa ever built -- undoubtedly the oldest surviving example of a Georgian-Palladian country home in the South. This gem has outlasted an invasion of British troops and a marauding Union army, earthquakes and hurricanes, and periods of neglect.\n\nBut the most unusual feature about Drayton Hall is that for reasons not completely understood, it has never had any plumbing, wiring or gas lines, meaning it stands today much as it did in the 18th century. The house has been painted throughout twice, the last time in 1875.\n\nAccording to Drayton Hall's curators, it is the only unrestored pre- Revolutionary War house in America. Because most of its original furnishings have long since been lost or scattered, the house is not furnished, something that is startling at first glance. But what has been created is not another restored home full of period pieces, but an architectural museum, a monument to the most handsome extant example of an important piece of history.\n\nBefore or after a tour of the home, you're encouraged to walk around the grounds, including what were once formal gardens along the river. The builder of the house, John Drayton, was a wealthy, young planter whose family came to South Carolina from Barbados and settled on the Ashley in 1679, at Magnolia plantation, just up-river. During the Revolution, some members of the same Drayton family moved north, where many of their descendants live today.\n\nAt Drayton Hall, which took John Drayton four years (1738-42) to build, few crops other than rice and corn were grown. The house served as a business headquarters, in addition to a family home, for supervision of a farming empire that included numerous Drayton plantations.\n\nThe house was continuously occupied by members of the Drayton family until after the Civil War, when it survived being burned by the Union army only by being posted as a smallpox hospital; soldiers were afraid to get near it. In the years after the war, the Draytons fell on hard times and the house was used only a few weeks a year, and eventually was vandalized.\n\nDrayton Hall also was built as a showpiece of Palladian architecture, a style popular in England in the 18th century and appreciated by wealthy families in the colonies, too. The elements of balance and order in architectural details were followed carefully. The carved-wood ornamentation inside is the elaborate handiwork of the finest 18th century craftsmen in the Charleston area.\n\nDrayton Hall Plantation is open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily (closed Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day). Admission is $5 for adults, $2.50 for students. Telephone is (803) 766-0188.\n\nOrlando Sentinel Articles\nPlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors, reporters or any other editorial staff.",

Atkins. Thorp is reported to have paid $3,500 for the ranch and he is starting extensive improvements. In addition to his other mining interest, Thorp has also become the owner of the Old George lode, and is pushing work on it as fast as possible.\n\nWith all of the nearby mining activity, the Raw Hide Buttes Ranch is a very busy stop on the Cheyenne to Black Hills Stage Line. The purchase included a fine blacksmith shop where horses are shod at $2 each; a well stocked grocery and dry good store; stage station, telegraph office, post office and road ranch accommodations.\n\nThorp is making plans to bring a force of carpenters to his new holdings and have them make extensive changes in the store and the residence. As quickly as possible he plans to move his wife and five-year-old son, Russell Jr., from Fort Laramie to their new home. Mrs. Thorp being of pioneer stock, will be a capable helpmate in the operation of the stage station and road ranch.\n\nSigns of civilization moving into the area were evident last week as elections were again conducted. There was not much competition on the ballot for local officers in the Hat Creek precinct. John Groher was unopposed for justice of the peace, he received 19 votes and replaces J.R Keyes. W.A Crabe was also unopposed in his bid for constable. He too received 19 votes and will replace L.J. Brown.\n\nA new precinct was established north of here this year on the 999 Ranch. The new precinct is called Lance Creek because the ranch is located where Lance Creek runs into the Cheyenne River. Cowboys from that vicinity elected J.G. Stortz as the justice of the peace. He was unopposed and received 22 votes. In the race for constable of Lance Creek, I.C. Griffith polled 19 votes to John Kendrick's three.\n\nAt Rawhide Buttes, Charlotte H.

Now, several checkpoints on the river Thames in London are at record levels, although rainfall is set to finally subside.\n\nCounties in the southwest of England, like Cornwall, Somerset and Devon, were among the hardest hit by heavy storms in Britain, Ireland and northwestern France over the weekend.\n\nRail connections to Cornwall still faced severe disruptions on Monday, after a 24-hour period when no services were running at all. Low-cost domestic airline Flybe pledged to double its weekday flights from Newquay in Cornwall to London in a bid to alleviate problems.\n\nAlthough London and its surrounding area was largely spared the worst of the weekend's floods, the river Thames was hitting record levels at several points on Monday morning. Authorities issued severe flood warnings for 16 areas on Monday, mainly for regions close to the British capital.\n\nNetwork Rail representatives said the Thames' levels were putting other key commuter routes to the southwest of the country at risk. Military personnel from the army and navy were deployed in strategic areas along the Thames overnight, erecting makeshift flood defenses.\n\nCriticism of relief efforts\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron was scheduled to visit the southwest for the second time in four days to survey the damage.\n\nForecasters said that Monday was likely to be the driest day of the week, although river levels were set to continue rising in places as previous rainfall flowed downstream.\n\nBritain endured the wettest January ever recorded this year; some parts of the country have been flooded for more than a month.\n\nAmid public dissatisfaction with government disaster management, a member of Prime Minister David Cameron's cabinet and the Environment Agency have become embroiled in a row over who was to blame.\n\nmsh\/ipj (dpa, Reuters)",

HW spills out the side of the enormous Taku Glacier, and faces the lodge directly. It also features an 'ice falls' as calves escape through the smallish opening. HW is across the Taku River a mile or two. In 1930s photos in the lodge, there is almost nothing spilling through HW's hole. This to me indicates much more than 'glacial insensitivity' but actual growth in Taku since 1930. They know the glacier has been large enough long enough to have been spilling through HW way before 1930.\n\nThis story is inappropriate and should be flagged for moderation.

Kyle McCarter of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nHow the relics were discovered remains a mystery, but McCarter believes they were found during a construction project in Jerusalem in the past few years. They were turned over to scholars from their current owner, the London collector Shlomo Moussaieff, who purchased them on the antiquities market.\n\nWhile the exact date of the pieces of pottery are still in dispute, they are believed to come from anywhere between the 9th and the 7th century B.C.E.\n\nIn addition to providing additional proof of the historical authenticity of the Bible, the artifacts help explain how people lived in biblical times.\n\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t prove the Bible true. What it does do is bring to life, in an exciting way, the reality of the times,\u201d said Hershel Shanks, editor of the Biblical Archaeology Review, which is publishing an article on the relics in its November\/December issue.\n\n\u201cYou just stand in awe of something so close to reality from 2,700, 2,800 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe second piece of pottery supports a notion mentioned in the Bible \u2014 that the king was a protector of widows and orphans.\n\nThat relic records a widow\u2019s petition for a gift that had been promised to her late husband.\n\nIn biblical times, women could not legally inherit property \u2014 or the promise of property. It went either to a male relative or back to the king, who would then decide what to do with it.\n\n\u201cWhat she is proposing is that since the land was a grant from the king, he has the right to give it to her,\u201d said Frank Moore Cross, a professor emeritus at Harvard University.\n\nMcCarter said the finding \u201csheds light on a legal situation and a social situation. We want to know about the king, and we want to know about the private lives of individuals.\u201d\n\nDid the king grant the widow the property? Unfortunately, no one knows.\n\nBut there\u2019s hope of finding a more satisfying end to the story. McCarter said it is possible that more than two pieces of pottery were found on the site, but no one knows where \u2014 or even if \u2014 they exist.",

He is never short on great ideas to get the word out, and Joyce Baker is just a treasure for us with all of her history and knowledge of what\u2019s going on way back in the day,\u201d Foreman said. \u201cThe fact that the two of them came together for this video series is great.\u201d\n\nBaker has a personal stake in her trip down memory lane.

We were there for 30 years. It was a big thing in a little tiny town.\u201d\n\nBaker\u2019s Grocery became the social gathering spot because next door was Friendswood\u2019s post office.\n\nLittle did the Bakers know at the time, but one of their teenage employees went on to do more than know that a carton of eggs never goes on the bottom of a grocery bag.\n\nState Sen. Larry Taylor (R-Friendswood), who grew up in Friendswood, has often about how being a sacker in the store was his first job.\n\nPart of Baker\u2019s Grocery Store remains. The original site is now on the grounds of First Baptist Church of Friendswood and some of the walls will be part of the church\u2019s remodeled sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWhen my father-in-law built it, he built only the best,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe were so surprised.

His family also alleges widespread theft in the intervening years.\n\"Fabulously expensive watches, cars, weapons and other treasure disappeared,\" Jovanka's lawyer Toma Fila wrote in his memoirs.\nControversial figure\nTito is admired for driving out Nazi German occupying forces in World War II with his partisan fighters, standing up to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and founding the Non-Aligned Movement.\nHe made Yugoslavia one of the most prosperous communist countries, but political dissidents were jailed under his regime and critics denounce his personality cult and lavish lifestyle.\nThe bedroom of the \"De Gaulle\" saloon on \"The Blue Train\" specially built in 1959 for late communist Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito.\nHistorian Predrag J. Markovic said the initial lack of decisions from the state over Tito's possessions stemmed from concern that they would damage his communist credentials.\n\"It was awkward as it was ideologically unacceptable that he and Jovanka had a lot of luxury things,\" Markovic said.\nSome 70,000 belongings are now stored in depots at Belgrade's Museum of Yugoslav History, also home to Tito and Jovanka's mausoleum.\nIn one of the depots, Tito's suits and blue-and-white marshal uniforms hang from the ceiling and the shelves are full of model ships and planes, paintings, clocks and rifles -- Tito was a passionate hunter.\nGifts from Stalin, royals\nAmong the most striking objects are an abstract ceramic statue, a gift from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin before the two leaders split in 1948, and Nixon's stones from the moon, which were delivered to Tito by astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1969.\n\"We have no dilemma over what to do with the official gifts as they are state property in accordance with the law,\" said Momo Cvijovic, who has been working in the museum collecting Tito's belongings since 1978.\nYugoslav president Josip Broz Tito (L) arrives in Moscow in 1956 accompanied by Kliment Yefremovich Vorochilov (R), Soviet head of State and Nikita Khruschev.\n\"The inheritance proceedings are about his personal things... but that is a very complex and delicate problem.\"\nCvijovic explained it was not clear-cut whether some gifts counted as personal or official, such as a golden cigarette case Tito regularly used which was given to him by Greek or Ethiopian royalty.\nEven the late leader's clothes and 250 pairs of shoes are undefined as many of them were also presents, added Cvijovic.\nAwaiting the court's ruling with low expectations after so many years, Tito's heirs said they hoped to receive at least small mementoes of their famous forebear.\nSvetlana Broz said she would like one of his old identity cards \"and the binoculars he used in World War II as commander of the army that defeated Hitler\".\nHer half-brother Joska said he and his sister Zlatica had earlier asked for a ceremonial uniform and copies of his awards and decorations.\nBut he said they would now be happy with \"anything that will remind us of him\".\n\nMore World News",

The theory behind the ducking test was that if she sank, she was innocent, although she would also drown.\n\nSherwood may have been jailed until 1714, when records show she paid back taxes and with the help of then-Gov. Alexander Spotswood she was able to reclaim her property. She then lived quietly until her death at 80.\n\nBelinda Nash, 59, has been researching Sherwood for years and asked for the governor to exonerate the woman. A group annually remembers Sherwood with a re-enactment in the river.\n\nRe-enactment ceremony\nFor Monday\u2019s ceremony attended by about 60 people, the re-enactment took place on land \u2014 in front of the Ferry Plantation House, a historic home where Nash volunteers as director and, dressed in costume, tells visitors about Sherwood. The courthouse where part of Sherwood\u2019s trial took place was located on the old plantation property.\n\nNash\u2019s daughter, Danielle Sheets, was tied cross-bound, her thumbs to her toes, and placed in a small boat, just as Sherwood would have been.\n\n\u201cI be not a witch. I be a healer,\u201d Sheets shouted, in character. \u201cBefore this day be through, ye will all get a worse ducking than I.\u201d\n\nAlthough the skies had been clear, as the real Sherwood was pulled from the water, a downpour supposedly started. The sky remained clear Monday.\n\n\u00a9 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The company GeoModel was hired to use below-ground radar to locate the remains of half a dozen members of the Allen family, a founding family of the area. The remains are buried in a tiny forgotten family cemetery in a residential backyard in Great Neck Plaza. (July 15, 2013) (Credit: Jeffrey Basinger)\n\nThe North Hempstead Town Board voted on Thursday to hire a surveying firm and a title company as part of its efforts to restore a little-known family burial ground in Great Neck Plaza.\n\nThe town hired Mineola-based Sidney B. Bowne and Son to conduct surveys of the Allen family burial ground, adjacent to two residential backyards on Pearce Place in the village, as well as surveys of the three surrounding lots. The town will pay no more than $5,500 for the survey, $600 each for updates to two lots, and $400 for an update on one lot, and will receive one update for free.\n\nThe town also agreed to pay $3,000 to Advantage Title Agency for a title search on the properties.\n\nMORE: newsday.com\/greatneckplaza | Sign up for community newsletters\nTWITTER: @Newsday_TonH | @NewsdayTowns\n\nThe tiny burial ground holds the remains of six members of the Allen family, who were prominent landowners on the Great Neck peninsula, and an infant from another family. The seven were buried there between 1810 and 1861. The cemetery was in disrepair, with unrelated items stored on it and the headstones moved, until town historian Howard Kroplick began a campaign last year to restore it.\n\nThe town is working with the village and the Great Neck Historical Society on the matter, as well as members of the Allen family.\n\nLast week, an underground radar survey determined the exact burial locations of the six members of the Allen family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very closely with the village of Great Neck Plaza and hope to have that cemetery fixed and restored very soon,\u201d town clerk Leslie Gross said at the meeting. Her office provided the funding for the survey.\n\nOnce the survey work is done, the process of restoring the headstones and footstones, fencing off the property and creating signage can begin, Kroplick said last week.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\nAre Long Island hospitals up to your standards?\n\nYes No\n\nYour town\n\nGet the latest news and information about your community, all in one place.\n\nWhat's this?
