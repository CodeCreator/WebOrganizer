        "text":"Straight From Mickey\n\nWhen me and my family go back to our native south, \u00a0to visit family, one thing is an absolute. Before anyone is allowed to head back west, my little Greek mother, Madelyn, is going to gather all the family around the piano and everyone, (and this means everyone) sings as a family. The last song that we sing is the old Hymn \u201cOn Christ the Solid Rock I Stand.\u201d\n\nThis song has been proclaimed by Big Mama as the official family song. And by the way, I think that you should know that \u201cBig Mama\u201d is a matriarchal term of respect for the senior matriarch in a Southern family, not an indication of her size. If you wish to imply otherwise, you are on your own, as you could incur her Greek wrath.\n\nThe older I get, \u00a0the more I look forward to this family event and I love the feeling that comes as time stands still for a few minutes. I have learned to love and appreciate the strength that I draw from my Mother and Father, my little sister, and my two brothers. The roots of my raising run deep.\n\nI believe strongly that there is a lack of nutrition in the world today, and not all nutrition is food that you physically eat. \u00a0With all of \u00a0the pressure and stress that our fast paced society places on us, and with both parents working to make ends meet, we have stopped gathering our families together around the guitar, the piano, or on the patio. We have allowed the television to raise our children and have forgotten how important that the human touch really is. My wish for you and yours is, \u00a0that when you visit us at MickeyRay\u2019s that for a brief period of time, you are able to lay down your stresses, shut out the outside world, and enjoy one another.\n\nThe recipes that you get to enjoy here at MickeyRay\u2019s are authentic and are a product of years of developing them to perfection. Also included on the menu are several family recipes. We proudly serve only Certified Angus Beef and All Natural Premium Pork. Our recipes are made with the finest ingredients and the proof is on your plate.\n\nI am convinced that families and friends should gather up more often and I hope that if it is not around your guitar, your piano, or on your patio, that you will gather up with us at MickeyRay\u2019s, and while you\u2019re here you can gitcha a little sumpin sumpin!\n\nAll the best,",

I love eating the soup but this fell WAY short. I won't be making this again!\n\n0 users found this review helpful\nReviewed On: Feb. 1, 2013\nLighter Mexican Meatloaf\nThis was sooooo good, I did make alot of additions to this recipe though. I used the entire egg, also cut the recipe in 1\/2 bc I only had1 lb of turkey. added cheese, put in 1\/2 of the green ench sauce in the mix and topped the rest before putting in oven. small onion, garlic, rotel tomato sauce, cilantro, fresh thyme and oregano, canned mushrooms, and I used the homemade taco seasoning from this website as well. Really good, I cooked for about 1 hour at 350 and I had left overs from a family of 4. It was a huge loaf bc of all of the additions and it was sooo moist. I am def making this again! Thanks!\n\n24 users found this review helpful\nReviewed On: Mar. 2, 2012\nSlow-Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup\nThis was AMAZING...with the mods I made of coarse! I didn't really change much...I used green enchilada sauce and a pinch of sugar in with the 26 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes, used fire roasted green chilis in a can. Added a can of rinsed black beans. Didn't add cilantro to the soup, but instead as a garnish. Also, I used 3 baked chicken thighs, I would have added boneless skinless chicken to the crockpot, but I didn't have any and I didn't want to add the skin and all to the pot and worry about fetching it later so this time I baked em and removed the fat, skin and bones. I also used 2 pkgs of chicken bullion in the pot with the water. I let this cook on high for 4 hours since I added cooked chicken. I would go longer next time with raw chicken. The way to serve this is over some rice to make it more hearty and filling, squeeze some fresh lime juice over the bowl and top with a spoon of sour cream, green onion, cilantro, cheese and tortilla strips...I used bagged tortillas. OMG SOOOOO AWESOME!!!!! Thanks! I personally think that you should read over reviews and take into count the changes ppl made, it helps make it better, so I never make things as written I always make changes to our liking.

        "text":"Posted by\nThis blog has been 24 years in the making. Ever since I was a little red head, I\u2019ve been fascinated with food, fun and healthy living. I believe that every kind of food and drink can be made healthy, fun and most importantly, delicious.\nThere is a wonderful balance between all the tasty, indulgent, and decadent foods that can also be made wholesome, healthy, and enriching. Being in a kitchen is an absolute adventure and is something that I love. A supermarket is like a vacation. A liquor store an odyssey and a winery is like Disney World.\nWhen I see a basket of fruits, vegetables and seasonings I don\u2019t just see a basket of those things. I see an opportunity to create something magical. I want to share my belief that the planning and preparation of a meal and drinks is the most exciting part of that meal. I want every kitchen to be 3 dimensional and colorful and I want Healthy and Delicious to forever go hand in hand, like peas in a pot pie or cucumbers in a Bloody Mary!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"A Journey Through\u00a0Food\n\nA Roadmap:\n\nBorderless cooking\u00a0adventures in a small apartment kitchen with inspiration from Vietnam, China, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Thailand, France, Italy, Greece, and last but not least, the United States.\u00a0I hope that whoever reads this blog will join me on a journey of culinary exploration.\n\nIn this blog, you\u2019ll find recipes that range from authentic Asian to downright fusion. Growing up in the melting pot that is Southern California, it is hard not to be inspired by all the food cultures that surround you.\u00a0Most foods that I cook\/prepare tend to be in the \u201chealthy\u201d range because I \u00a0generally I to stay away from deep frying, baking, and sweets. However, I believe that food nourishes not only the body, but also the soul. So you may occasionally see some more \u201cjunky\u201d or comfort foods in this blog.\n\nWok Even Further with Me:\n\nI am mostly a self-taught cook who has been experimenting in the kitchen since I was eight years old. My teachers? My grandmother, father, Emeril Lagassee (the \u201cBAM!\u201d guy),Two Fat Ladies, Rachel Ray, Bobby Flay, Giada de Laurentis, Ming Tsai, Jacques Pepin, and the Iron Chefs. Full disclosure: I have not had any formal training in culinary arts. I hail from a family of cooks and pseudo-chefs who have worked anywhere from a street cart in Saigon selling freshly rolled rice noodles to full-scale Chinese Seafood restaurants. They have taught me the fundamentals on how to prepare and eat authentic Chinese and Vietnamese food through our shared family meals.\n\nAlthough my family\u00a0has a difficult time expressing the weight of their love, I\u00a0know for certain that I am loved whenever they serve me\u00a0a bowl of freshly steamed white rice crowned with slow-braised pork belly. Inevitably, cooking and food became the language through which my family communicated with me. Unsurprisingly, cooking is how I stay connected to my family\u2019s Chinese\/Vietnamese roots and also how I show love to others. Although I have never set foot in Vietnam or China, I feel more in-tune with my heritage whenever I simmer a pot of ginger chicken soup. It also allows me to share parts of my cultural identity to friends from different backgrounds.\n\n\nLook Out:\n\nI am usually not a \u201crecipe\u201d follower, but I have tried my best to document and quantify what I did to help you recreate the foods that I dearly enjoy.\u00a0I highly encourage you\u00a0to taste the food for seasoning\u00a0as you\u00a0cook or to make adjustments\u00a0to suit your personal taste. Beyond this, I am generally\u00a0a\u00a0fan of tasting something delicious and trying to recreate it and make it my own. Cooking is a creative, engaging process that is most fun when you add your own twist to it. Please share what variations you make so that I can continue to learn and grow in my cooking.",
