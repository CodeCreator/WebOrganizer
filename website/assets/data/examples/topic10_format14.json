I was referring to the sous-vide method you touched on above (my mind translated it as \"bag style\") sorry. I apologize if I seem a little obsessed with the clay pot\/slow cooker methods- I'm like a dog with a bone sometimes.

Pros\/Cons?\n\nThe Food Lab: How to Pick and Cook a Holiday Ham\n\nI know I'm a few years late to the party, but in researching a good recipe for our Thanksgiving ham I wanted to see what YOU had to say before deciding on how to cook it.\n\nI find it interesting that in your ham recipes you use a bag method to keep the juices in as opposed to a crock pot\/slow cooker or even a clay cooker. Any reason for this?\n\nOpen Thread: What Do You Want to Know this Thanksgiving?\n\nEarlier this year I purchased a Romertopf clay cooker and ever since it's been used on a weekly basis for delicious, juicy chicken. I'm not a big fan of turkey (it dries out SO fast) but with the inlaws coming for a visit I was considering making turkey in the clay cooker.\n\nMy problem? Crispy skin. The meat turns out tender and fall off the bone juicy, but I can't get the right skin crispiness. Taking the top off to brown the skin too long will dry out the breasts and not long enough will not crisp the skin.\n\nSpicy Tomato Corn Bread\n\nDumb question, do you dice the tomatoes or throw them in whole?\n\nTurmeric Chicken with Sumac and Lime from 'The New Persian Kitchen'\n\nCan you substitute the water for white wine perhaps?\n\nOblivia hasn't written a post yet.\n\nOblivia hasn't favorited a post yet.",

Everyone always gathered around the table in mom\u2019s kitchen, for conversation, for laughter and for good eats! My mother seemed to live in the kitchen, constantly baking, cooking, cleaning up. My brother Jeff used to tease her that he would keep her chained to the oven for a never-ending supply of her famous butter tarts! Dad had kitchen duty Friday nights. My four siblings and me always looked forward to pancake night! Dad would make thin Bavarian pancakes, something somewhere between a pancake and a crepe. They would be smeared with jam or sprinkled with cinnamon sugar or mom liked hers just buttered and rolled up. We grew up to the music of pots and pans clanging, eggs being cracked open and flying flour.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not baking or cooking I am thinking about baking or cooking. I read cookbooks like other people read novels. I love taking pictures of my creations or masterpieces as I like to refer to them sometimes. I wish someone would invent internet smell-a-bility and yes, I totally just made that word up \ud83d\ude09\n\nI live in Ontario, Canada.\n\n7 Responses to \u201cMeet Thea\u201d\n\n  1.

I need at least one dish in a day which makes me happy, otherwise I am not too fussy ;)\n\nGood food resembles good living. It is one of the best ways to pleasure your senses.\n\nI used to love cooking but over the past few years I could not devote time towards it since was mostly occupied with work. But now cooking is my new Love :)\n\nHonestly I don't like cooking on a daily basis like a routine cause I shrug routine and monotony. For me cooking is more like an art, where you completely soak yourself in the rich aromas of spices and flavors. It is one of the best ways to de-stress yourself and is very therapeutic. What can be more fun when you create and relish something yummy!!! After all good food is the best remedy for a lot of things! When your happy, celebrate with good food. When your sad, cheer up with good food.\n\nKindly note I am a vegetarian and a teetotaler so the recipes posted on this site will be vegetarian too. But then there are countless ways of cooking up the veggies cause Innovation has no Limitation :)\n\nSo come join me and be a part of this yummy journey.\n\nI hope you relish the experience and please drop in your feedback too for any suggestions or queries -\u00a0\nEmail me at savskitchen@gmail.com\n\nYou can also connect with me via - Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest And Google +\n\nTwitter - savskitchen\n\nFacebook -\u00a0https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/savskitchen7\n\nInstagram - savskitchen\n\nPinterest - savskitchen\n\nGoogle + -\u00a0https:\/\/plus.google.com\/101056641109998045826\n\nSavskitchen Grams",

        "text":"The story so far\n\nThey say that necessity is the mother of creation and in the case of Ethicoco, it was. Well, the father\u2026\n\nEthicoco was born out of dissatisfaction. My daughter suffers with nut and dairy allergies. Since she was a tiny baby, I have cooked from scratch, creating meals that suit her needs and are prepared with love. But when it came to Easter and Christmas it was all too easy to become disillusioned with the lack of high (or even medium!) quality chocolate and sweets available for her.\n\nSo one Easter, I decided to create my own. Nothing fancy, just some melted down dark chocolate, into a cheap egg mould and decorated hideously with sweeties. Artistically talented I am not, however this first step set me down the long road of discovering how chocolate is made and the fascinating ways I could do it myself from home.\n\nLike many hobbyists, I was more than happy pottering about in my kitchen, combining ingredients and searching for those perfect flavours that other dairy free chocolates flatly failed to deliver on. No doubt about it, my ego told me I could do better than what was on the market, but I never expected to make it my livelihood. Then came unemployment. For a whole year I was out of work, and that steady spiral down of self esteem; wondering what on earth I could do to support myself and my child.\n\nSo out of necessity, after finally getting tired of weekly job rejections, in 2014, came Ethicoco.\n\nThe Politics\n\nIt\u2019s all in the name.\n\nEthicoco strives to be ethical. Nothing is perfect, but I think carefully about where I source our base ingredients and only buy from ethical traders that guarantee no child slavery and offer decent prices for their growers. GM free, no chemical nasties and 100% recyclable packaging.\n\nI am creating chocolate for my daughter, why would I want other children or the environment to suffer for her enjoyment?\n\nI want my daughter to be proud of what we have achieved together. Just our little team of two.",

        "text":"Kamal grew up in Delhi in a huge joint family where food was always the focus of things. It was like the language of his family; the bonding factor. His roots in the food business took place at home where he realized the importance of the right mix and quality of ingredients to make mouthwatering dishes. From his grandparents he also picked up on nutrition and healing value of foods and Indian spices.\n\nKamal has always wanted to show the world the royalty of Indian cuisine. His debut into the catering and fast food business was through Moghul Express and Moghul Catering as a partner. Shortly, Kamal bought over the Moghul Catering brand and business, and has grown it many folds. He started the famous fast food and Indian sweets (Mithai) business, Mithaas, in Nov 2006 and has grown it to 4 locations in New Jersey. Urban Spice, the Indian fine dining restaurant threw open its doors shortly after Mithaas. He then got interested in a concept that explores the Indian cuisine beyond its traditional boundaries and caters to a more mainstream American palette. Papa Pancho, a pizza restaurant serving brick oven Italina pizzas with Indian ingredients and toppings opened in fall of 2013. Aarzu is Arora Hospitality\u2019s latest venture.\u00a0Located in Historic Downtown Freehold, Aarzu Modern Indian Bistro provides an exceptional upscale dining experience. When he is not working, Kamal likes to go trekking, eat out and try new recipes.",
