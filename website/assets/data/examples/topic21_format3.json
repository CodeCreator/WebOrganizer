        "text":"Ringing & Practice Times\n\nWe practice every Tuesday night from 7.30 to 9pm and\u00a0for Morning Service every Sunday from 9.45am to 10.30am.\n\nAccess to the ringing chamber is made via a door located on the north side of the tower.\n\nAs our Tuesday practice is so popular, we introduced a more structured approach to the practice in May 2008. \u00a0\n\nEach practice we have a different special method to concentrate on for the evening, thus we have a method for the night and people will know in advance what we will be ringing and can revise beforehand. It also ensures everyone, who wants to, gets to ring the special method, instead of some people getting a go and others missing out if we only happen to ring it once in the evening. Those who wish can treble, cover and if desired learn a touch knowing they will get chance to call it.\u00a0\n\nEach week we still have the standard methods on the menu, but we rotate between a Plain Bob week and a Grandsire week. Those learning Plain Bob Doubles should be quite capable of learning Grandsire Doubles alongside it so no one will stagnate in Bob Doubles.\u00a0\n\nRounds & Calls and Plain Hunt are on the menu as and when required i.e. for new ringers or for people moving from Doubles to Triples to practice hunting on higher numbers, or to practice Treble Bob Hunting which is the big step required between the plain methods and the treble bob and surprise methods.\u00a0\n\nOn the night we alternate between the standard method and the special method throughout the evening, trying to do equal amounts of each, obviously dependent on how many are present etc. There will not always be 5 Tuesdays in the month but we will stick to the schedule so everyone knows what is on if they miss a week\n\nBefore practice on the second Tuesday of each month we meet at 6.15pm at The Shama Restaurant in Bingley for a curry.\n\nSimulator Practice\n\nSimulator practices are\u00a0usually\u00a0held on the\u00a0first\u00a0Saturday of the month, from 10.00am to 12.00 noon. If anyone has a particular method they would like to try please let Jane Lynch know. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a31 will be requested from each ringer, this will be used to provide tea, or coffee, and biscuits. Any surplus cash will be put into our 'Simulator Fund' and used for any repairs to, or replacement of, the equipment.",

Our company offers customized fittings and repairs\u00a0for your clubs.\n\nA Golf Club and Ball\n\nPersonalize Your Clubs\n\nGetting the best clubs\u00a0for your body and form when playing this sport can mean a world of difference when you play. When a club is fitted to your specifications, it will swing like a dream. Our team looks at a variety of factors for customized clubs.\n\nDuring these fittings, we determine the size of your club's shaft based off your height. People that are taller experience a harder time with clubs because they do not have the ability to choke-up on the grip. If this is your case, then you will receive clubs with a longer shaft.\n\nWe also look at your form when you are swinging your clubs. How fast you swing, as well as what tempo you swing at, can tell us a lot about what size clubs you require. Through these two measurements, we will be able to make customized golf clubs.\n\nClub Repair for Any Damages\n\nCome to our shop if you have a broken or damaged club. We are able to apply new grips to your club, re-shaft your clubs, and adjust them to fit your needs. The shaft of your clubs can become bent when hitting balls close to obstacles such as trees. After years of use, rust or breakage can also occur. We are able to repair all of these issues as they arise.\n\nSmall adjustments are a quick and easy fix for our team. We understand that your needs for your clubs lie and loft could be different from\u00a0what we have available in store. Through evaluation of your swing, we will be able to create the perfect clubs for you.",

        "text":"Care tips\n\nCare and cleaning before use\n\nUsually new goalkeeper gloves are impregnated so that they can be stored for a long time without visible or noticeable changes occurring in the materials. To improve the grip, this should be rinsed out by hand before using them for the first time. For best results use lukewarm water and uhlsport goalkeeper glove cleaner. If the water is coloured when cleaning the gloves, then there are still residues of the impregnation left in the material. Keep washing until the water runs clear.\n\nCare and cleaning during use\n\nWash gloves regularly by hand with lukewarm water. Best of all, wash your gloves in the shower directly after the game. Washing your gloves in the washing machine is not at all recommended as this will dramatically shorten their useful life. \u00a0Our special uhlsport goalkeeper glove cleaner is recommended for stubborn stains. After cleaning your gloves are now clean and offer excellent grip.\n\nUsage instructions\n\nSoak the gloves thoroughly in the sink or under the shower. Apply some of the uhlsport goalkeeper glove cleaner to the palms, spread all over the gloves and wash thoroughly. Let it soak in for 30 seconds. Rinse the gloves thoroughly with clean water. Depending on how dirty the gloves are, repeat the procedure. Wear the gloves for a short period of time, then let them dry at room temperature whilst lying flat.\n\nAttention heat!\n\nDo not expose gloves to direct sunlight and do not put them near direct heat sources. If gloves are not going to be used for some time, then dry them and store in a dark place.\u00a0\n\nEcologically responsible\n\nuhlsport goalkeeper glove cleaner consists of 100% biodegradable surfactants. Do your bit for sustainability! Using small amounts of the glove cleaner goes some way to protecting the environment. A small amount is enough to clean the gloves.",
