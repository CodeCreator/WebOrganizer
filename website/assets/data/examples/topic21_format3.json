        "text":"Travel News\nTravel & Premier Team Pages\nWe have created links to the Southwestern District Connecticut Junior Soccer Association Website for all travel teams.\u00a0 This site is NOT maintained by SYSL and may not be up to date until just before the actual season. The SWD CJSA site is usually updated before the fall or spring seasons.\nTravel and Premier Soccer\nTravel Division\n\nTravel is for\u00a0players who achieve a level of play\u00a0high enough to\u00a0award him or her a place on a Travel team.\u00a0\n\nThere are two seasons for the Travel Program: Fall (Late August-November) and Spring (Late March-June).\u00a0 Winter training is organized on a team-by-team basis. It is expected that children on a Travel team attend winter indoor training if it is organized by the team.\n\nIn order to participate on a Travel team, a child has to try out. Tryouts take place in October \/ November for the Spring season, and in May \/ June for the Fall season.\u00a0 Details about tryouts are posted on this website and in local newspapers.\u00a0 If a child has to miss a tryout session, parents are encouraged to contact the Travel team for that child to arrange for a make-up tryout (held at the discretion of the team coach).\u00a0\n\nFees for Travel tend to be higher than for house to accommodate the need for registering the child with the Connecticut Junior Soccer Association. Parents can also expect additional training fees to cover the cost of professional trainers.\u00a0 At the U9 & U10 levels, SYSL subsidizes these training fees.\u00a0 Registration fees do not cover the cost of uniforms.\u00a0 At the beginning of a child's participation on a Travel team, a uniform kit is provided for each child on the team. These uniforms are NOT the property of the child, but are the property of the team. If a child leaves the Travel program, it is expected that the uniform will be returned to the team for redistribution.\u00a0 In older age groups (U11 and above) there may be the need to purchase an additional uniform for away games.\u00a0 The fees for these uniforms are NOT included in registration fees.\u00a0 The total cost to play on a travel team is roughly $400\/season exclusive of any additional uniform purchases.\n\nIn addition, members of the Travel Division also receive a free ticket to a New York Red Bull's game (parents, siblings and friends can also purchase tickets at a reduced rate from SYSL).\n\nBehavior Expectations\nAs a Travel player, children represent SYSL and the City of Stamford in play all over Fairfield County.\u00a0 As such a level of maturity and decorum is expected of children on these teams. In addition, a level of commitment is expected from both children and families to attend training and games.\n\nAt the U9 and U10 professional coaches and trainers are employed by the team to ensure fundamentals are the focus of the experience.\u00a0 These are developmental levels.\u00a0 At older ages, parent coaches are permitted, but teams may elect to continue to pay for a professional trainer.\n\nTime in Games\nThe amount of time in a game for a child in Travel is not guaranteed. Game time is dependent on the level of effort, commitment and talent that is expressed by the child as recognized by his or her coach.\u00a0\n\nFor additional information about Travel Division, please see the Travel section of the Website.",

We are extremely fortunate to have another great group of dedicated registrars. This task is very time consuming and stressful, so please thank these dedicated folks next time you see them.\n\nMost clubs open registration March-April. Be sure to act quickly. When open registration closes, players are then taken on a space-available basis. Also, if you are a returning player, and you register after open registration closes, you lose the option to automatically be placed back on your team from last year.\n\nStacey Lenderman (Select)\nLaura Wiengaertner (Rec)\nEastside FC\nColleen deCillia (Premier)\nDemaree Kieburtz\nLake Hills\nAmy Hunt (Rec and Select)\nMercer Island\nMindy Rowe (Micro\/Rec)\nStephanie Wyss (Select)\nBrinda Virden\n\nBirth Certificates: The first time a player registers with an EYSA club, it is mandatory that we have a copy of a certified birth certificate. (Hospital, and baptismal certificates are NOT acceptable.) Military ID and passports are acceptable. A certified copy of a birth certificate can be obtained from the state in which your player was born. Registrars have been encouraged to return registration forms to those who are missing this information.\n\nPlayer Age Groups: Click here for a link to the Player Age Chart for 2016, 2017 and 2018. New rules regarding player age were rolled out by US Soccer in 2016, and all clubs must adhere to these new rules as of 2017. Click here to learn more.\n\nUniforms\/Equipment: These can be purchased from your club. Each player, however, is required to purchase soccer cleats, shin guards and a proper size ball. Every player should also bring a water bottle to all games and practices.\n\nPractices: Each team coach sets practice times to his\/her convenience. Practice days will be made known to you by the coach in August. With the exception of the Eastside FC (Premier) teams, all of our coaches are volunteers.\n\nCost: Please consult your club as costs vary due to differences in field costs and programs offered. In general, fees are not refundable except in the case of injury or relocation out of the area prior to the start of the season.\n\nForms: Some of the paperwork required for special circumstances for registration or guest-playing with one of our teams can be found here.\n\nLinks to Rec Program Info\n\nRegistration for Fall 2017 Rec Soccer opens as early as April 1, 2018",
