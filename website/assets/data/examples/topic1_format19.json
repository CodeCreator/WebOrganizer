This fact applies to the classical tradition as well as to medieval architecture, and is particularly evident in architectural drawings and design from the Italian Renaissance onward. In this essay, I trace the shift from geometry-the primary tool for quantification in classical architecture- to numeracy that characterizes Renaissance architectural theory and practice. I also address some more general aspects of the relation between technologies of quantification and the making of architectural forms. ER -",

Sharaku\u2019s strikingly intense half-length actor portraits, often with highly exaggerated facial features, emphasized the individual personalities and idiosyncracies of the leading kabuki actors of his day.
