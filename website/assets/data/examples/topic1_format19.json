He worked with the Dresden gallery (1924-1928) and taught at G\u00f6ttingen University (1929-1933) before immigrating to England in 1933. In England Pevsner taught at Birkbeck College (University of London) and the Courtauld Institute, and lectured as the Slade Professor of Art at Cambridge (1949-1955) and Oxford (1969) Universities.\n    Pevsner was a scholar of Italian baroque painting, German sculpture and the 19th and 20th century architecture of England and Europe. It is as an architectural historian that he is best remembered, partly because of the astonishing amount of work he did in this area, and also because of his strong point of view. His polemical view is evident in his 1936 book Pioneers of the Modern Movement (later re-titled Pioneers of Modern Design) in which he first tried to persuade England to accept the Modern movement. He remained a persistent advocate for modern design and for historical preservation. Among his many publications are the following books: An Outline of European Architecture, the History of Building Types, and the monumental Buildings of England in 46 volumes, of which 35 were researched and written by Pevsner. Pevsner was an editor on the influential journal Architectural Review and edited the Pelican History of Art series which comprised 48 volumes. He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1967 and a knighthood in 1969. Pevsner died in 1983.\n\n    Administrative Information\n\n\n    Open for use by qualified researchers.\n\n    Publication Rights\n\n    Preferred Citation\n\n    Nikolaus Pevsner papers, 1919-1979, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, Accession no. 840209.\n\n    Acquisition Information\n\n    The Getty Research Institute acquired Pevsner's papers with his library in 1984. In addition, material was moved to the collection from accessions 840189 and 920028. Most of the books have been separated to the Getty Research Institute Research Library. Some heavily annotated books remain with the archive.\n\n    Scope and Content of Collection\n\n    The Nikolaus Pevsner Papers contain his research files on art and architecture, manuscripts for many of his articles and books, correspondence with scholars, publishers and artists, lectures, and a collection of clippings and offprints of his articles. These papers date from 1919 to 1979, with the bulk dating from his years in England. (N. B.: Penguin Press Ltd has retained the files for The Buildings of England.) A small file of personal items includes family correspondence, photographs, manuscripts, awards and diaries. The books in Pevsner's library, many annotated, have been separated to the Getty Research Institute, Research Library.\n\n    Arrangement note\n\n    The archive is arranged in seven series: Series I.
