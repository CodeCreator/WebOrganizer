        "text":"Skip to Main Content\nClose Menu\nCase Study\n\nState of Georgia\n\nUsing Federated Search to make it easier for constituents to find what they need\n\nThe Client\n\nThe State of Georgia\u2019s Digital Services team (DSGa) supports a network of over 100 websites running on Drupal. Georgia was the first state to adopt open source at an enterprise level, implementing the\u00a0first version\u00a0of its Drupal platform in 2011. Originally built in Drupal 7, DSGa began transitioning to a new Drupal 8 platform in 2019. Georgia\u2019s new platform has been developed to provide consistent, modern, and compliant websites that focus on the needs of Georgia\u2019s citizens.\u00a0\n\nThe Problem\n\nSites in the network need the capacity to search content from both their own site and other sites, regardless of the version of Drupal being used. While both platforms are hosted on Acquia and use Acquia Search, their Drupal 7 search solution could not incorporate content from the new Drupal 8 sites. This left the DSGa team in an awkward position: either lose functionality while they waited for sites to transition to Drupal 8 or delay the launch of the new platform until all sites were ready.\n\nFortunately, there was another option.\n\nThe Solution\n\nBack in 2016, with the announcement that Google Search Appliance was being discontinued, many government entities and universities started looking around for replacement options. At Palantir, we wanted to provide an open source option that could solve the following needs:\n\n  \u2022 A simple way to store, retrieve, and parse content\n  \u2022 A cross-platform search application\n  \u2022 A speedy, usable, responsive front-end\n  \u2022 A flexible, extensible, reusable model\n\nWhat we built is called Federated Search. With Drupal, Solr, and React working together, Federated Search is able to index data from completely arbitrary sources, standardize it, and then output it in an easily consumable way. This approach means more flexibility for site administrators and a cleaner experience for users.\n\nUsing\u00a0Federated Search, Palantir collaborated with DSGa and their development partners to re-launch network-wide search with added functionality in both Drupal 8 and Drupal 7 without any service interruption for site visitors. The scope of this project affected five separate technology organizations in addition to the more than 80 internal clients supported by the Drupal platform:\n\n  \u2022 Acquia, the hosting and search provider\n  \u2022 Digital Services of Georgia (DSGa), the internal product and support team\n  \u2022 Lullabot, the architects and implementers of the Drupal 8 platform\n  \u2022 Mediacurrent, the support vendor for existing Drupal 7 sites\n  \u2022, the creators of Federated Search and the search architects and implementation partners for\n\nImplementation required a clear communication of existing functionality, division of technical responsibilities, and coordination of testing and release schedules across both Drupal platforms. It also meant adapting the current search experience to new features available in Federated Search (most notably the built-in filtering capacity), and integrating the current predictive search feature into the Federated Search product.\n\nOur approach was to adapt to the existing project tools used by both Lullabot and Mediacurrent, and to use scrums to keep everyone informed of progress and blockers. We also had to consult with the Acquia Search team to ensure that the required configuration (which uses private key files to point each site to a single Solr index) was compatible with the architecture of Acquia Cloud.\n\nThe Results\n\nThe new search feature launched without a service interruption for site visitors while adding accessible search filters for site, content type, and date range. These features of Federated Search make it easier for constituents to find what they need, adding value to the existing service while making it sustainable as the platform shifts to Drupal 8. For both internal clients and development partners, the implementation bridging Drupal 7 with Drupal 8 lowered\u00a0the risk involved in the upgraded platform rollout.\n\nVersion 2.0 of Federated Search includes feature enhancements from this and other projects, adds improved search results, autocomplete, wildcard searching, default facet control, enhanced query parameters, and improved Drupal theming. Version 3.0 added support for the latest changes in Drupal, React, and Solr.\n\nWe were also able to use the work for to improve the product for use by anyone on the Acquia Cloud or Acquia Cloud Site Factory platforms.\n\nWant to Know More?\n\nContact us to find out\u00a0how Federated Search can help your organization unify its search experience.\u00a0You can also learn more about the work we did with the State of Georgia in our Acquia webinar:\u00a0100 Sites.

It usually has to be connected to the internet for full use. Since all the data and functions aren't housed on your device.\n\nA typical example would be social media. You can't see all of the information online unless you're connected to the internet since it is hosted in one of the company's remote servers. Another example is Saas-Software as a service application. It lets people use the functionality without taking the whole burden on their phones (power and storage wise)\n\nDifference between Cloud Apps and Traditional Apps\n\nThe main difference between a traditional app and a cloud-based app is where the infrastructure and data for the app exist. When you download a standard application from any store, you're actually downloading the entire software package on your device. So, you don't need internet connections to use it all the time (yes, like the photo editors!)\n\nWith the cloud app, the data and functionality are stored or partially or entirely online. Based on the app's nature, you might do some things without an internet connection but have to be online most of the time. (the social media apps!)\n\nCloud App Development Services Scopes Offered by Riseup Labs\n\nWe provide a flexible set of service components.
