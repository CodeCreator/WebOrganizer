The staff of respective department had to spend large of time to collate all the information and come up with the metrics to present. Moreover, there was a need for a common person to consolidate the metrics across department and prepare a pitch with the information which was then used in the review meetings.\n\nWe initiated a business transformation initiative followed by building data aggregation and custom analytics. A need was identified to develop dashboards that present enterprise with operational and performance metrics used for periodic business performance review.
