        "text":"When you hire a Highly Capable Copywriter \u2013 what are you really getting\u2026?\n\nA real copywriter\u00a0is a creative sales person behind a keyboard\u2026at least they are if their head is\u00a0screwed on.\n\n\u2026mind those rolling heads.\n\n\u2026Here, I\u2019ll make a guess: you\u00a0need a writer\u00a0with\u00a0a good understanding of psychology and of what drives people to buy \u2013\u00a0or drives people to go in one direction over another.\n\nI wrote a book about that: Grab \u2019em by the vowels \u2013\u00a0I\u2019d say it\u2019ll give you a good sense that I know what I\u2019m talking about \u2013 let me know if you want to flick through it\u2026\n\n\u2026or see the results. Email me if you\u2019d like to see the work I did that helped a startup take the lead in a race against the biggest finance institutions on our pretty planet\u2026\n\n\u2026When you hire a highly capable copywriter, it\u2019s not just about \u2018words\u2019. It\u2019s about driving profit in your business\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s another thing that can make a big difference: voice\u2026\n\n\u2026when your website, and your other advertising and marketing materials, have a distinctive voice \u2013 a voice that really talks to people. Then people will feel a sense of \u2018character\u2019\u2026they\u2019ll feel they\u2019re getting to know your brand, and they\u2019ll feel comfortable with it. Your brand will be a natural choice for them\u2026\n\nThis is one place I excel. I love nailing the voice for a brand.\n\nHere\u2019s a note from my client\u00a0Jim Leszczynski:\n\n\u201cThe voice is amazing. I have no idea how you were able to write something that sounds like it came from my mouth. I shared it with a few friends and they too said it was amazing how you captured \u2018me\u2019. You certainly have a talent for identifying something and giving it life through words.\u201d\n\nA note from my client Dawood Ghalaieny:\n\n\u201cRichard, One word. Perfect. This is Cellusys. You have captured it. Lets do it\u2026 ALL.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019re some voices I built \/ am building \u2026each page of blether is designed to generate specific feelings and motivations in people:\n\nA voice for MagicFriends.\n\nA snippet of the voice I\u2019m building for RebuildingSociety.\n\nA voice for Costa Rica Packet.\n\nA voice for a rebrand of Woodie\u2019s.\n\nA voice for ITCore.\n\nVoice for a technology\/telecoms company.\n\nVoice for Escher Technology.\n\nRoadmaster brand language.\n\nVoice for a fintech.\n\nVoice for Ulster Bank.\n\nA voice for Ms Brown, the M&M\u2019s character.\n\n\u2026I think one of the biggest reasons I can do \u2018voice\u2019 well, is: I love doing it.\n\nSolid principles of influence + a\u00a0voice that really talks to people = something really effective.\n\nHere\u2019s another job I did that fits that bill:\n\n\n\nMy thinking with that campaign was to appeal to our \u2018drive to nest\u2019 \u2013 our family values; and to the hero within us: be the person who takes care of those things that might just save your child\u2019s life\u2026with the sound of a child\u2019s voice as a powerful motivator.\n\n\u2026more to it than the more common \u2018just shock them\u2019 approach, which can feel less relevant to people.\n\nCopywriting is not about words\n\nIt\u2019s about words as tools. Words and visuals are one. A highly-capable copywriter who can also creative direct, art direct, and design \u2013 and who has a deep understanding of how the eye takes in words \u2013 a deep understanding of typography \u2013 and of how the ear takes in words\u2026will make you buckets of cash.\n\nYou\u2019ll see more about that here.\n\nAnd it\u2019ll be handy for you to know that I did the art direction and the design, as well as the copy, for every item on this page, and every item in my portfolio. Here \u2013 I\u2019ll grab just one piece o\u2019 art\u00a0outa my portfolio:\n\n\nI guess you\u2019ll be looking for a copywriter who can bring hints of story to your advertising, too\u2026\n\n\u2026because our brains are wired for story. That\u2019s what perks us up. When your product is integral to a story we relate to, we can feel at home with it. It can become a part of our lives.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to use recognisable \u2018story structure\u2019 in the copy. More importantly, story is about helping people feel \u2018realness\u2019. It\u2019s not about lies. We build the story from truths. It\u2019s about showing the people who are right for your business, a path that brings them to this thing that can help them (your product).\n\nI use\u00a0story in subtle ways, right through my writing.\n\nHave a scoot around my site. See a sense of real in my writing? Stuff you can relate to? Story\u2026?\n\nAnother thing you might want is easy-to-read copy, that feels kind of like a conversation\u2026\n\n\u2026because \u2018writerly\u2019 stuff is about the words themselves\u2026but you\u2019re not selling words; you\u2019re selling your product.\n\nSo here\u2019s something that\u00a0will get people involved in what you\u2019re saying: we need to make your copy so\u00a0people feel there\u2019s a person behind the words: someone talking to them through the page or the screen\u2026 Bring people this feeling, and they will be open to the messages you want to give them.\n\nNot every person who sells him or herself as a copywriter can bring you that feeling in their writing: the feeling of a conversation. In fact, most can\u2019t.\n\nHow are you finding my writing, on that score?\n\n\u201cI was spellbound on how you can \u2018talk\u2019 with your words. What an awesome gift you have\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2026that\u2019s what Rosemarie Robertson said about my work\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve nattered on about the psychology of influence, voice, story, conversation\u2026\n\n\u2026but what about how your product helps people?\n\nWe need to grab people and show them. Here\u2019s something I bet you wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore if it landed on your doormat. It throws you right into the proof of why the product is good: it doesn\u2019t give \u2018doubt\u2019 any opportunity to take hold in your mind.\n\nA job I did for UPC:\n\n\n\u201cYou want to know what a truly world-class, no-excuse, no-BS copywriter ought to be able to do? It\u2019s this: He ought to be able to write an ad that tells how good he is. Hell, if he can\u2019t sell himself, how can you expect him to sell your goods or services.\u201d \u2013 Gary Halbert\n\n\u2026you\u2019ve probably seen other copywriters\u2019 web pages \u2013 you\u2019ve seen what those people can do with words; or what they can\u2019t do\u2026\n\nNow how about my words \u2013 do they show you something\u2026? Did you almost forget you were reading? \u2026so your mind was simply taking in the messages\u2026\n\nIf you are thinking Yes, you might want to think: do these words show you this: you\u2019ve found a writer who can bring the minds of your customers to\u2026\n\n\u2026to an idea. To a place. Or to a click you want them to make\u2026\n\nIf you want to ask me if I will help you with your project, you can catch me here:\n\n\nIf I don\u2019t get back to you within a few days, maybe your email went into my spam folder. If you need to check I got your email:\n\nPhone or text: +353 87 357 4031\n\n\nPS: I am a highly capable copywriter. For us to work together, you will need a reasonable budget for the job, and I will need to be interested in the job: not just the budget \u2013 the job.\n\nIf you ask me to go ahead with a job, you are telling me you need a voice in your copy that really talks to people; that you need solid psychology that encourages people to think in specific directions; and hints of story that show people: this product is the one for you.\n\nTo fix a time to talk, or to see my portfolio:\n\n\nTalk soon.\n\n\n\nOr \u001ffind me at:\n\n\n+353 87 357 4031\n\nSkype id: RichardClunan\n\n...or sling a pigeon my way.",
