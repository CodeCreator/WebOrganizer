        "text":"About Linda\n\nI ride a Harley Davidson. How can I, a motorcycle enthusiast, help you to grow your business?\n\n1. Preparing for a Ride Before I hop on my bike and hit the road, I have to determine what clothing to wear and what to pack by looking at the big picture and what my main objectives are for the ride. A little advance preparation goes a long way to ensure that I get the highest level of safety and enjoyment from the ride.\n\nPreparation is important for your business too and I will ensure that all the services and programs in your business are ready to go forward with the same level of detailed planning, preparation and implementation so that you can enjoy your ride.\n\n2. Charting the Course Going the distance involves planning, and for longer rides it involved driving the route by automobile first. The trip is mapped out, the rest \/gas stops are scheduled, and I plan my ride accordingly to make sure I hit the targeted stops along the way.\n\nI will manage your projects with the same attention to details by defining the objectives, identifying milestones (rest\/gas stops) and then navigating the project so that it stays on course\n\n3. Group Riding Traveling on the road with a group of motorcyclists involves regular communication from the Lead Rider. This allows everyone in the group to have the greatest road experience by providing clear directions, identifying the ride objectives and expectations. It is also the Lead Rider who makes sure that members of the group don\u2019t get lost, reminds individual members that they are riding with a group, and keeps maximum safety in mind.\n\nI will make sure that everyone on your team is working together as a cohesive group so that they are always up to date, communicating regularly, and staying on track.\n\n4. Maintenance \u2013 A motorcycle is a finely tuned machine designed for maximum performance and equipped for the ride you want, whether it is for cruising or racing. Keeping the engine, tires, lubrication, brakes, etc. well maintained is imperative.\n\nYour business is a finely tuned machine as well. I will provide regular maintenance through in-depth analysis of systems and procedures, automation, and strategic planning. As the top mechanic in your business I will make sure that your business is tuned regularly so that you are getting the greatest profitability, revenue, and mileage out of your investment.\n\nWhether you are cruising along or moving full throttle to your next venture, I will take the curves with you, watch for bumps in the road, maneuver you through the chaos, and most of all, enjoy the ride with you.\n\nFor more about how I can help you Send me an Email!\n\nMore Linda facts:\n\n  \u2022 I worked in a large retail franchise corporation for 20 years before I became an OBM \u2013 How\u2019s that for stamina?\n  \u2022 I have worked in Training and Development, Strategy, and Operations \u2013 Loved every minute.\n  \u2022 I play Piano, dabbled in classic guitar, and I play the bongos and the Djembe \u2013 Music is my soul.\n  \u2022 I have my certificates in Journalism and in Alternative Dispute Resolution \u2013 Did I mention my right brain???\n  \u2022 I have two kids whom I have parented by myself. \u2013 They are my life\u2019s work.\n  \u2022 I learned to downhill ski, got my certification in SCUBA, and learned to ride a motorcycle\u00a0 \u2013 All after my 40th birthday!\n  \u2022 I am taking an Introductory Motorcycle Maintenance Course \u2013\u00a0 Continuously learning all the time\u2026redundant but true.",

        "text":"Carissa Reiniger is a\u00a0proud Canadian and New Yorker. \u00a0 Born and raised in the prairies of Canada and found her\u00a0second home when relocating toNew York in 2010. \u00a0Carissa lived\u00a0in Toronto for 6 years in between and has\u00a0been granted numerous opportunities to\u00a0spend time in other countries and build some roots in other places in the world- most recently, Melbourne, Australia!\n\nWhile building and running Silver Lining and advocating for small business is a huge part Carissa\u2019s life (which you will read all about in just a second) there is much more to her story.\n\nKnowledge of the small business sector comes natural to Ms. Reiniger\u00a0\u2013 but she is also well versed in making big choices, trying and failing, fighting anxiety, believing in something bigger and people. \u00a0Carissa was\u00a0home-schooled from grades one to nine after struggling in kindergarten with reading and a lot of anxiety. \u00a0She finally went back to school in grade 10 and experienced a radical shift from anxiety to accomplishment.\n\nA graduate of the University of Alberta and was almost a theatre major, Carissa finally realizes why her gut pushed her to pursue Psychology instead. \u00a0Realizing quickly that being in school for 9 years in order to get my PhD was not going to work, Carissa \u00a0spent less time worried about grades and more time fixating\u00a0about the rest of life. \u00a0During \u00a0her 4 years at the University she volunteered, had 4 jobs (at the same time!), ran summer camps, took big groups to Mexico to build houses, traveled and lived a lot of life.\n\nShortly after her last days at Alberta University Carissa moved to Toronto literally within 24 hours of her last\u00a0exam and landed a job at a big advertising agency in Business Development. \u00a0With that being said, she\u00a0quickly realized that working in a big company wasn\u2019t her niche, so she quit \u2013 and started Silver Lining\u2026..\n\n\nCarissa Reiniger was 22 when she started Silver Lining. \u00a0Her motivation to start Silver Lining \u00a0was because of the big conundrum in her surrounding world. \u00a0With ties to various corporate people that have sacrificed their passion\u00a0to make money and small business owners who have\u00a0sacrificed money to pursue their passion, Carissa decided it was time to make\u00a0money AND do what she loved (whiles helping others do so). \u00a0 Silver Lining \u00a0developed with that mission at hand; Carissa Reiniger began with interviewing 400 small business owners to figure out why it is so hard to grow a small business, built the SLAP (Silver Lining Action Plan) methodology in response, and has spent the last decade building a company that helps small business owners grow.\n\nSilver Lining\u00a0has worked with over 10,000 small businesses in 9 countries around the world and continues to provide them with tactful ingredients in order to help them succeed. \u00a0This was achieved by\u00a0completely changing their business model three times in those ten years to find a way that would allow them to help others fully while being sustainable. \u00a0While enduring big wins and big failures, Silver Lining continues to fip the funnel with continuos learning.\n\nIn addition to Silver Lining Carissa serves as\u00a0an advisor, investor and board member of numerous other businesses. She wrote her first book in 2008 called Stories From Our Black Books and ended up turning it into a company that included a play version of the book. These plays were also produces by Carrisa Reiniger herself and will be in production across Canada (more coming on that project soon!).\n\nSmall Biz Expert\n\nCarissa actively\u00a0writes, speaks and advises on\u00a0how to grow a small businesses and on issues related to small business. She is\u00a0an extremely strong advocate of getting corporations and governments to think differently about how they work with small businesses. In addition to all of the Partnerships and Projects that Carissa Reinger continues to work on, she has put together two major movements, The Coalition Committed to Growing Small Business and Thank You Small Business.\n\n\n\nCarissa has spoken at hundreds of events throughout her career. \u00a0Whether she is training small business owners on how to grow their businesses, speaking at events about the opportunity, responsibility and privilege of being a small business owner or speaking on a larger scale about the importance of small business to the economy, Carissa has spoken to tens of thousands of people and is always looking for new places to spread the message that small business is BIG and you can create the reality you want.\n\nSustainable Health Sustainable Wealth\u00a0\n\nInc\u2019s GrowCo Conference\n\nThank You Small Business 10 City Tour\n\n\nReleased in 2008, this book captures lessons from Reiniger\u2019s own growth journey as well the interviews she did with 100 additional business owners who built their businesses past 1M in revenue.\n\nReleased in 2010, this book teaches business owners how to build simple systems to get their head in the game and manage their overwhelming to do lists so that they always do what they say they will- including growing their businesses!\n\nReleased in 2013, this book tells us that we CAN change the economy one small business at a time and inspired the global movement that is on a mission to do exactly that.\n\n\n\nCarissa started Thank You Small Business \u2013 a global movement in support of small businesses. \u00a0In partnership with companies like Citrix, American Airlines, Nespresso, OnDeck (and more) TYSB has given free support \u2013 and thanks \u2013 to over 25,000 small business owners around the world. \u00a0TYSB is far from done and this movement\u00a0will continue to tell the message that small business is BIG.\n\nCarissa\u2019s passion for small business is just a piece of her larger determination to let people know that they CAN create the realities they want. \u00a0Life doesn\u2019t have to be as it is \u2013 if you have a dream and are willing to work hard, you can create the life you want. \u00a0 Her Creating Reality Project is a source of lessons and actual help for any person who is brave enough to have a big dream.\n\n\n4 + 12 =",
