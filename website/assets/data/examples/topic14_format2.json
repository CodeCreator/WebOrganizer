Attention!\nDolce and Baci:: shuffle nervously :: Attention, Sir!\nDad: M'Ladies, Would you please escort in our honored guest.\nBella and Chloe: As you wish.\n\nBella and Chloe leave the room. They return, escorting Smudge, one on each side.\n\nDad: Smudge, Present yourself to your family and kin!\n\nBella and Chloe lead Smudge until he stands before Dad, and then they solemnly move two paces away.\n\nDad: Smudge, Do you know why your family and kin have brought you here tonight?\n\nSmudge: No.\n\nDad: They are here to bear witness and affirm what I as head of this household am about to bestow apon you.\n\nBaci, Dolce, Magoo, Bella and Chloe look at each other and then at Smudge.\n\nDad: Tonight, You stood at the backdoor and growled for no apparent reason.\n\nSmudge: I might have.\n\nDad: Good. So you admit the action which is the cause of all this ceremony tonight. Do you know what was discovered apon hearing your growl at the backdoor?\n\nSmudge: I think so, I was growling at it.\n\nDad: But was it in your yard?\n\nSmudge: No. It was past the fence over near the...\n\nDad: It was over near the road. Not a real busy road but a dangerous road nonetheless.\n\nSmudge: Yes, You always told us to stay away from the road because it was dangerous.\n\nDad: Do you know what I saw when I went to investigate what you were growling at?\n\nSmudge: The furry cat that sometimes comes to visit us.\n\nDad: Yes. The furry cat that comes to visit our yard from time to time. You have done a great and noble thing dear furriend.\n:: Dad speaks to the other Cats ::\nWhen I looked to see what was bothering dear Smudge, I saw our dear furry visitor attempting to cross the road at the end of our block. Now our road is not extremely busy but other stupid humans drive too fast and without care and attention to felines and puppies who might be out for an unsupervised stroll. I saw this poor feline soul starting to cross the road. I yelled at the feline. The cat surprisingly turned back and did not cross the road. Now if its home had laid across the road's expanse it would have ran faster across the road. But it did not. It came back to our side of the road. The side of the road where its home must surely be. By your actions, Smudge, I was able to prevent an unknown furriend from doing something that might endanger it own life. To do something for someone or some furriend that you do not even know that is the greatest act of honour and compassion known on this Earth.\n\nAs the bean of this household, it is my honour to bestow upon you the rank and privileges of the Holy and Ancient Order of the Catnip. Rise now, Sir Smudge, and accept your honours.\n\n\n\n  2. Oh dear Smudge, we are so proud of you! Oops, we meant to say Sir Smudge!\n\n    Purrrrrrrs, China Cat & Willow\n\n  3. Go, Sir Smudge!\n\n    I hope everycat is getting on better in the house whapping or hissing!\n\n  4. Way to go Smudge! We all need to look out for each other, and you are setting a great example.\n\n    Good luck to your Dad in his job hunt.\n\n  5. Yay Smudge! You did a good thing!",

        "text":"Titanic Furniture Tale\n\nOne evening, just before a Society meeting, Maeve O'Dea who has recently moved into Lahardane from Dublin gave the Society this photograph and told us:\n\n\"The writing desk is from the Titanic. It originally belonged to an underwriter for Lloyds of London. When he died his sister gave it to my friend. There were originally two identical writing desks; one was destroyed in a fire. The Lloyds' underwriter knew someone who worked for Harland and Wolfe. They bought both writing desks.\n\nThe two writing desks were removed from the Titanic the night before it sailed, and were bought very shortly after the sinking in 1912. Nobody knew then what a legend Titanic would become.\n\nThe desk has the number 62 stencilled on its underside. It has weights to keep it steady. The Promenade Suites had corner desks, and it is said to be from that area of the ship. The writing desks on the Olympic were slightly different.\"\n\nWe were speechless!\n\nAfter Titanic sank craftsman must have been reproduced furniture as the interest in Titanic memorabilia grew. How can you tell a genuine piece of furniture from one made after the sinking, or can you?\n\nPlease Contact Us if you can shed light on this.\n\nSocial Networking",

        "text":"Saturday, November 25, 2006\n\nA weekend story\n\nAngel Antonius looked appreciatively at his tiny wooden workbench. Many millennia ago, he had carved it from a giant oak tree he had found after the great flood. He did not need the workbench to do his chosen task, but he found that it helped him focus. He needed that focus sometimes to help with the competing emotions of his chosen task. He ran his hand over the smooth finely-grained surface and once again felt connected to the earthly world he served.\n\u201cAntonius\u201d a small voice cried out, \u201cAntonius.\u201d\nAntonius saw the small Cherubim flying towards the area where he had positioned his workbench.\n\u201cMalachi.\u201d Antonius replied to his friend. \u201cI cannot talk now. I have to return to Earth.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Malachi responded. \u201cI want to come with you. I want to learn what you know and to help.\u201d\n\u201cAre you certain that this is the task you want for yourself?\u201d Antonius asked as he gestured to his simple workbench and the tattered hem of his robe.\n\u201cYou could fix your robe if you wished.\u201d Malachi answered. \u201cMany of the other angels think it is silly to have such a tattered robe.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not all joy and happiness, Malachi.\u201d Antonius stated, a slight frown creased his brow. \u201cMy task brings pain with the joy, tears with the laughter.\u201d\n\u201cBut you bring the kittens to earth.\u201d Malachi replied, \u201cAnd I do love the newborn kittens.\u201d\n\u201cBut I also bring the Lost Ones back to Heaven.\u201d Antonius stated.\n\u201cPlease, Can I help you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Antonius agreed. \u201cYou may help me.\u201d\nAntonius motioned for Malachi to follow him.\n\nThey walked together across the vast expanse of Heaven.\nMalachi noticed a simple cobblestone bridge. It shimmered with the colours of the rainbow. This side of the bridge was clear but the far side was concealed with a faint haze. Every so often, a human would appear. Sometimes they would be accompanied by a single cat or dog or bird or ferret or bunny or horse or other animal, other times they would be followed by several.\n\u201cIs that the Rainbow Bridge?\u201d Malachi asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Antonius said. \u201cWe built it soon after Humans befriended the first animal.\u201d\nAntonius and Malachi reached a small spot where there appeared to be thousands of newborn kittens all sound asleep. Antonius walked softly amongst the sleeping kittens. He looked lovingly down upon the tiny little furry bodies.\n\u201cHow do you know which ones to take?\u201d Malachi asked.\n\u201cThere are no wrong ones to take, Malachi.\u201d Antonius replied. \u201cEach has a purpose and a destiny set for it by God. I simply place them on their path.\u201d\nAntonius methodically picked from the multitude of sleeping kittens. The kittens barely stirred from their slumber as Antonius kissed them on their foreheads and placed them into the folds of his robe.\n\u201cCan I carry some?\u201d Malachi asked.\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d Antonius replied as he picked two small Siamese kittens and placed them into Malachi\u2019s hands. \u201cNow slip them into the folds of your robe for they get very cold.\u201d\nMalachi slipped the two kittens into his robes and grinned as he felt the kittens snuggle up to the warmth of his body. Antonius smiled.\n\u201cWe will go and deliver these beloved ones to Earth.\u201d Antonius said as he motioned for Malachis to follow.\n\nAntonius and Malachi stood over the sleeping body of the pregnant Siamese cat. She was sleeping soundly and did not stir at the presence of the two angels. Antonius looked at Malachi.\n\u201cTake your kittens and give them to their mother.\u201d Antonius guided.\n\u201cBut there are four within her, Antonius.\u201d Malachi asked. \u201cWhy did you have me bring only two?\u201d\n\u201cBecause that is all God said to bring.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the other two?\u201d\n\u201cThey were never meant to breathe the air of Earth.\u201d Antonius said. \u201cDo not fret for them. They will remain but a husk, an empty shell. Sometimes, that is the most merciful thing we can do.\u201d\nMalachi took the two kittens from his robe and placed them next to their mother.\n\u201cNow pay attention.\u201d Antonius began to sing softly to the mother cat.\nMalachi listened to the words of Antonius\u2019s song and grew sad as he heard each note and syllable leave Antonius\u2019s tongue. The forms of the two kittens slowly merged with the mother cat. When Antonius was done, Malachi saw that the angel was crying and that his tears fell softly on the still sleeping cat.\n\u201cWhy do you weep, Antonius?\u201d Malachi asked. \u201cIs not birth of a creature a joyous thing?\u201d\n\u201cThe creation of life is a joyous event.\u201d Antonius replied. \u201cBut life for these two will not be happy or pleasant. You wondered why we only brought two kittens. It is because the Humans who own this poor creature do not care for it properly and see it as a means to satisfy their own greed. Their callousness is why we could only bring two.\u201d\nAntonius brushed the tear from his cheek.\n\u201cCome.\u201d Antonius moved away from the sleeping cat and her ready to be borne kittens. \u201cWe have many more to deliver yet.\u201d\nMalachi followed Antonius to the next cat. Antonius once again pulled a certain number of kittens from the fold of his robe and placed them next the sleeping cat. Once again with his mournful song, he merged the kittens with their new mother. The act repeated itself over and over. Malachi thought his heart would break as he felt the loss Antonius carried in his song. Soon there were no more kittens in Malachi\u2019s or Antonius\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cWe have one more thing to do.\u201d Antonius said. \u201cFor now, we have to guide the cats and kittens who have passed back to Heaven.\u201d\nAntonius took Malachi to a dreary forlorn spot. The building might have once been a warehouse where Humans worked and toiled, but now it was blackened and lifeless. Antonius moved to a small corner where several charred beams and pieces of wood had collapsed. Malachi gasped as Antonius lifted the burnt wood away and exposed the still, scarred body of a cat.\n\u201cPoor cat.\u201d Malachi mourned, \u201cI hope she did not suffer.\u201d\n\u201cBut she did.\u201d Antonius replied. \u201cShe suffered most cruelly. But she gave her life in an attempt to save those she held most dear.\u201d\nAntonius gently moved the body of the cat and exposed the uncharred forms of three small kittens. Unlike their mother, their bodies bore no mark of fire.\n\u201cKnowing that she could not escape, she placed her body between her kittens and the fire in hopes of saving them with her sacrifice. But it was for naught, for although the fire did not touch them, the smoke surely did.\u201d Antonius noted. \u201cAnd now it is time to take them all home.\u201d\nAntonius knelt beside the still forms of the cats. He pulled one feather from his left wing and placed it on the ground in front of him. He then pulled another feather from his right wing and set it next to the other. Antonius repeated this pulling of feathers from his wings until he had four sets lying on the ground. He reached down to hem of his robe and pulled a thread from the silken cloth. Gently, he bound two feathers together with the thread and then he placed the feathers on the charred body of the mother cat.\nMalachi listened to Antonius as he worked on the feathers. Once again Antonius was singing, but the song was not mournful or sad. It was full of joy and happiness. Malachi was confused.\nAntonius placed his fingertips to his lips and then touched his hand to the feathers on top of the mother cat. There was golden shimmer as the feathers grew into a set of angel wings and attached themselves to the mother cat\u2019s back. As they grew and fixated onto the cat\u2019s body, the scars and burn marks from the fire faded. Antonius placed the feathers onto the kittens and placed a kiss onto each kitten. He sang as the wings appeared and smoke-filled lungs once again breathed clean air.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why your robe is tattered.\u201d Malachi stated.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Antonius replied. \u201cThis is why it is always tattered. Never more than thumb-width, but never less. My tattered hem is a reminder of all the cats I have brought back to Heaven. To repair it would not be right.\u201d\n\u201cBut why was the song placing the kittens on Earth so sad, but the song of their death so happy.\u201d Malachi asked.\n\u201cThe song of their birth is sad, because I know that I might be dooming them to a life of fear, pain and loneliness far from the grace of Heaven.\u201d Antonius said. \u201cBut my joy knows no bounds when I know that I have come to return them to Heaven. I am allowed to free them from their existence on Earth and bring them back into the light of God.\u201d\n\u201cSome of the cats will choose to stay at the Rainbow Bridge and wait for the Humans that cared for them.\u201d Antonius stated. \u201cBut Lost Ones, such as these, will come back with us to Heaven, for they have no one to wait for at the Rainbow Bridge.\u201d\nAntonius scooped up the three kittens and motioned for Malachi to pick up the female cat. The kittens purred and squirmed in Antonius\u2019 arms. The female cat looked over at her kittens and accepted that they were finally safe. She snuggled into Malachi\u2019s robe.\n\u201cNow we take them home.\u201d Antonius smiled to a beaming Malachi.\nMalachi smiled back and then briefly closed his eyes. The hem of his robe unraveled to match Antonius\u2019s. Only a thumb-width. No more. No less.\n\nFor Tilly who gained her wings this weekend.\n\n\n  1. That was beautiful and very moving.\n    It was a lovely way to remember Miss Tilly.\n\n\n  2. What a lovely story. It did an excellent job of making the Lady's face leak also. We're sure sweet Tilly is purring about this sweet memorial.\n\n  3. What a beautiful story and tribute to Miss Tilly.\n\n  4. Oh that story brought tears to Momma's eyes.

Jason was a small-time dealer and Bella used to be an aristocrat, at least that\u2019s what I heard. About the only thing they appeared to have in common was that both were short. Not so bad in a woman, but you could see he wasn\u2019t happy with it.

        "text":"Tigger and the snails\n\nThis is the free english translation of my former german post . A little story about a tomcat with happy end.\n\nTigger is a red tabby tomcat who\u2019s home is right under the roof in a nice little apartment. He lives there together with Susanne my friend and neighbor and with Bruni an old chartreux cat. They are both house cats and never go outside. Tigger is a shy gay and he is also a little scared. But he is very curious. So Tigger loves to explore the staircase sometimes.\nIn summer he spends much time on the roof. Up there is his kingdom where he is the unchallenged ruler. Tomcat Tigger has also the talent to hide so perfectly that nobody ever can find him when he doesn\u2019t want to be found. But one day this special talent was not for his good at all.\nOn a summer evening Susanne was looking for Tigger and could not find him. After some time she gave up and thought by herself: so or so I have no chance when he doesn\u2019t want to be found, he will surely be back in the morning when he is hungry. But what she didn\u2019t know, this time her poor tomcat hoped desperately that she would find him.\nSusanne went to sleep and in the next morning no Tigger was anywhere to be seen. Now she was very concerned and afraid that may be he was fallen from the roof. Our house is really high with five floors. So she hurried into the backyard to look for her tomcat. Susanne searched for him all over the garden behind every tree and in every bush\u2026he was not there. At last she went to the old external stair that leads down to the basement.\nAnd down there in a dark nasty corner she finally found him.\nTigger had big wide eyes and didn\u2019t move at all. He sat there like from stone and his fur was over and over covered with snails. That poor tomcat must have spent the whole night in this position, so scared that he could not move and all the snails had enough time to find a nice little place on him.\nSusanne touched him very carefully and tried to find out wether he was injured. She put all the snails from his fur and took him slowly into her armes. He seemed to be alright and Susanne went with Tigger into our house. The last stair she let him down just to see wether he can move and run normally. And for her big relief he could. Like a thunderbolt he run into the apartment and first of all on the litter box.\nAfter that he started to clean his fur and did not stop for at least two hours. The rest of the day Tigger slept in Susannes bed totally exhausted.\nSo the only explanation for this unwanted adventure was that he somehow came to the backyard over the staircase. Somebody has opened the door to the garden, Tigger slipped out and the door behind him was shut. And so poor Tigger had to spent all the night on a strange planet with strange noises and strange creatures.\n\nKommentar verfassen",

        "text":"by Rachel Palmiero\n\nI have a great life. I have dogs to bug, plants to eat, and a little pet door for my own personal use. If you haven't guessed who I am, my name is Delver. I'm an all black cat who lives with the Mylets. I'm extremely friendly and very curious. Enough about me. Let me tell you a little about my family.\n\nMr. Mylet is very tall. He has black hair, a black mustache, and very dark eyes. Even though he gets angry a lot, he is quick to make up. He yells and yells about how much he hates cats, but I've found that when no one else is home, he'll come and pet me. Last Christmas he even bought me a whole steak. He's a great guy as far as I'm concerned. Sometimes I've heard people call him Kyle. I just can't figure out why he has two names.\n\nMrs. Mylet has another name too. Hers is Robyn. If you ask me, that's a dumb name. It sounds as if she's a bird or something. Well, anyway, she is really nice, too. She's a really active person so a lot of the time she'll take me for a walk. That's fun because when I'm with her I get to go to places that otherwise I'm banned from. Like usually when I'm by myself, I can't go anywhere near the butcher's shop. For some reason when the butcher sees Robyn, he'll let me in. I'll never figure that guy out.\n\nHarmon, Forrest, and Lici (short for Alicia) are their kids. Harmon is six, Forrest is nine, and Lici is eight months. I like them when they play with me, but you know how kids are.\n\ncat line\n\nSo anyway, there is a little of my background. To tell you the truth, the reason I am writing this is to tell you about the day I found Neve and Kara. They are my best friends. You know up until now I could never see myself socializing with any other cats. I always hated them for stealing my humans, teasing my dogs, or maybe eating my food. Well, that is all in the past now. Here is my story:\n\nIt was Monday morning, and it had been one long weekend. On weekends Harmon and Forrest are home from school. It's not like I don't like them, but they get really annoying really fast. That particular weekend Harmon's friends were staying over, and Forrest had taken it upon himself to ruin it for them. He definitely ruined my weekend. Anyway, now it was Monday, and I was so glad they were gone. Usually Monday's are my favorite days, but for some reason this one just felt like it was going to be a bad one. I decided that I was just still a little fed up with the kids. They were still in a bad mood when they were getting ready for school.\n\nI was sitting on the couch at about 11:00 and had just woken up from a nap when I heard all this ruckus outside. I jumped down to look; but when I got to my pet door, it wouldn't open. I was sure that there must be some mistake! I mean, really, why in the world would Robyn and Kevin be mad at me? I started meowing to let them know that there had been some kind of mistake.\n\nRobyn finally heard me and came out to see what was wrong. She saw me pawing at the door but just kept talking about how they needed to keep me out of the way because of the movers. Then she went on to explain that grandpa was going to live with us and that I should keep out of the way until he was settled in. I couldn't think why they needed another human in the house.\n\ncat line\n\nI decided that I needed another nap to pass the time so I went to my favorite sleeping place, Lici's crib. After a good hour or so, I got up to see if this new person was a cat person. I found him sleeping in a chair in the living room and determined to wake him up. I jumped up and started meowing when Kevin came in and rudely threw me off. I simply jumped right back up and started meowing again. For a second time he threw me off! I resolved that if he was going to be stubborn enough to keep throwing me off, I was going to be stubborn enough to keep jumping up. I jumped up again. This time he squirted me with water so I decided I better get out of there before he decided to give me a bath. I ran to my pet door to find that it had finally been opened; it was about time!\n\nI walked out planning to go find Hector. He is the biggest, stupidest dog I have ever met! I found him under a tree chasing his tail. He is so annoying. Why would anyone want a thing like that around their house. My favorite thing to do is sit right where he can almost reach me but can't quite get at me because of his leash. So I did just that. You should have seen him bark and growl. He was so aggravated. I just sat back and laughed and laughed. I love to make him mad.\n\nAfter I got bored with that, I started walking back home when I heard it. It was two cats talking, and it sounded like they were going to investigate my dog. I ran over there to show them who was boss. I couldn't believe how they weren't intimidated by me. So, anyway, we ended up just talking for a while and found out we actually have a lot in common. All of us hated when other cats took over our stuff. We were all bored so we decided to go do something like chase another cat.\n\nOne day about a month later, we happened upon a man who was painting a fence. He looked like he needed some help so being the noble cats we are we went over to see what we could do. When he first saw us, he seemed nice enough. He even came over to pet us. We sat down and tried to figure out how one would paint a fence.\n\nred pawsred paws\n\nWe are really smart so it didn't take us long to figure out that all you had to do was get some of the red stuff on your paw and then stick your paw on something. That is exactly what we did so I don't know why that man got mad at us. I think he said something about how the sidewalk and grass don't need to be painted. If you ask me, they would look much nicer if you did. Well, anyway, that guy looked pretty mad so we ran over to my house to hide.\n\nUnfortunately Harmon and Forrest were in the middle of one of their famous fights. Lici was hungry or something because she kept crying. Robyn kept rocking her, but couldn't see that she needed food. I resolved that I needed to get her some. I asked Neve and Kara what babies like to eat, and they said what we eat. So I went to find her a fish to eat. I went to Forrest's room because he has a really big one. I just about had it out when he came in and started yelling at me. I couldn't make him understand that it was for his baby sister, and he just threw me out.\n\nI was going to have to find something else. At last I thought of Kevin's bird. It looked really tasty, and I had my eye on it for a long time. I figured Lici needed it worse then me, though. When I was trying to get the bird, Kevin came in; and he looked mad too. That was okay, though, because Lici had just stopped crying.\n\nHumans never appreciate what you try to do. So Neve, Kara, and I went to find something else to do. It seemed that every time we tried to have any fun, we got yelled at. Now we have just stayed out of the house altogether. Well, I still live there but I do my visiting outside of the house. Well, I have to go (Kara is calling), but that is my story.

Share it!\n\nby [?]\n\nI never hesitate about scraping out the work of days, and beginning afresh, so as to satisfy myself, and try to do better. Ah! that \u201cbetter\u201d which one feels in one\u2019s soul, and without which no true artist is ever content!\n\nOthers may approve and admire; but that counts for nothing, compared with one\u2019s own feeling of what ought to be.\n\n\u2014Meissonier\u2019s Conversations\n\nLife in this world is a collecting, and all the men and women in it are collectors.\n\nThe question is, What will you collect? Most men are intent on collecting dollars. Their waking-hours are taken up with inventing plans, methods, schemes, whereby they may secure dollars from other men. To gather as many dollars as possible, and to give out as few, is the desideratum. But when you collect one thing you always incidentally collect others. The fisherman who casts his net for shad usually secures a few other fish, and once in a while a turtle, which enlarges the mesh to suit, and gives sweet liberty to the shad. To focus exclusively on dollars is to secure jealousy, fear, vanity, and a vaulting ambition that may claw its way through the mesh and let your dollars slip into the yeasty deep.\n\nRagged Haggard and his colleague, Cave-of-the-Winds, collect bacteria; while the fashionable young men of the day, with a few exceptions, are collecting headaches, regrets, weak nerves, tremens, paresis\u2013death. Of course we shall all die (I will admit that), and further, we may be a long time dead (I will admit that), and moreover, we may be going through the world for the last time\u2013as to that I do not know; but while we are here it seems the part of reason to devote our energies to collecting that which brings as much quiet joy to ourselves, and as little annoyance to others, as possible.\n\nMy heart goes out to the collector. In the soul of the collector of old books, swords, pistols, brocades, prints, clocks and bookplates, there is only truth. If he gives you his friendship, it is because you love the things that he loves; he has no selfish wish to use your good name to further his own petty plans\u2013he only asks that you shall behold, and beholding, your eye shall glow, and your heart warm within you.\n\nInasmuch as we live in the age of the specialist, one man often collects books on only one subject, Dante for instance; another, nothing but volumes printed at Venice; another, works concerning the stage; and still another devotes all his spare time to securing tobacco-pipes. And I am well aware that the man who for a quarter of a century industriously collects snuffboxes has a supreme contempt for the man who collects both snuffboxes and clocks. And in this does the specialist reveal that his normal propensity to collect has degenerated. That is to say, it has refined itself into an abnormality, and from the innocent desire to collect, has shifted off into a selfish wish to outrival.\n\nThe man who collects many things, with easy, natural leanings toward, say, spoons, is pure in heart and free from guile; but when his soul centers on spoons exclusively, he has fallen from his high estate and is simply possessed of a lust for ownership\u2013he wants to own more peculiar spoons than any other man on earth. Such a one stirs up wrath and rivalry, and is the butt and byword of all others who collect spoons.\n\nProsperous, practical, busy people sometimes wonder why other folks build cabinets with glass fronts and strong locks and therein store postage-stamps, bits of old silks, autographs and books that are very precious only when their leaves are uncut; and so I will here endeavor to explain. At the same time I despair of making my words intelligible to any but those who are collectors, or mayhap to those others who are in the varioloid stage.",

Earlier I got lots of cherries, then a big crop of plums. Now it's time for pears and apples. First I'm going to tackle the pears. Lots of great pears are way up high -- of course!\nThese pears will make tasty eating!\nThe ladder couldn't get up under these branches, so I had to climb up to get to the apples. I'll be making a lot of applesauce this year.\nI think I've done enough fruit picking for now. It's time to supervise my minions. \"Get to work, minions!\"\nThe minions seem to be working well, so I can sneak in a little siesta.\n\nI have a lot of property to take care of. Some of it is set up for pasture, and some isn't. I'm taking a few minutes to look over a choice location for a new pasture (and prime grazing).\n[Molly's view]\n\nNow, I need to get the tractor out to mow this area down so I can get it ready to be a good pasture next year. I'll head to the barn to get out that old tractor...\n\nUh-oh. There seems to be a bit of a problem here!\nI think I've got it...\n\nOff we go!\n\nOne of the best times on the farm is relaxing on the porch after a hard day's work.
