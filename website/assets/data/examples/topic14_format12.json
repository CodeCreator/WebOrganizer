        "text":"About Puppy Crack\n\nPuppy Crack \u00ae originated with Wendy and Daniel Dorchester. Through our love and nutritional concern for their dogs, we became interested in all natural treats. From our home, we perfected a recipe for Puppy Crack using REAL ingredients such as: fresh beef liver, chicken liver, eggs, oats, gentle spices, and other wholesome ingredients.\nWe wanted to make a dog cookie without preservatives and human grade in quality. We also felt that shapes and sizes were just to please people; heck, dogs don\u2019t care.\u00a0 We wanted a treat we could give our Great Danes that would add to their healthy diet. \u00a0\nWe started working with a local rescue in Charleston, SC and realized that we wanted to give back through making the treats for the dogs that lived there. This blossomed into making the treats for fundraisers to help dogs with surgery and other health concerns.\u00a0 Here, we met two more rescuers, Jan and Brian Lambert, who adopted Mabel and Bosco, also Great Danes, and, as fate would have it, just happened to own a local bakery. Together, we started Rescue Me Dog Bakery and brought Puppy Crack out of the kitchen so we are able to share it with you and your furry friends.\n\nWith its shape comparable to a thin cracker, Puppy Crack \u00ae is perfect for dogs of all shapes and sizes, and is taking the Southeastern United States by storm.\n\nOur Purpose\u2026With a common love for ALL DOGS, our mission is to aid rescues in need of help. Puppy Crack \u00ae\u00a0helps pay for routine vet visits, neutering and spaying and more serious procedures. With your purchase, you can help an abused or neglected animal become whole again and ready to be adopted into a loving home. Your purchase will make a difference!\n\nEvery purchase of Puppy Crack helps support rescues and the neglected dogs they bring back to health!",

One year later we bought his halfbrother Calimero of Karma Tschangri and this was the point where everyone seemed to be satisfied. But .....\n\n\n...when we were visiting the boys' breeder in summer just to say hi, show him how proud we were of our beautiful dogs and take a look\u00a0at the 8 weeks old E-litter, we saw a wonderful sister of Calimero (out of the repeat breeding) who was returned to her breeder but unfortunately couldn't stay there since she would not get along with her mum.\n\n\n\n\nDalarna, already two years old, immediately caught my eyes and heart and I bet you already guess where she found her new home a few\u00a0weeks later :-). Since her breeder wanted her to be shown, this is where we got involved in dog shows and, after Dalarna became a champion and earned some additional titles, we decided to start breeding Afghan Hounds.\n\n\nSadly the breeder of our dogs died some months after we've bought Dalarna, and so Eirene, the bitch he kept from his E-litter was\u00a0looking for a new home .....\u00a0\n\n\nSince our boys were already used to a girl, we\u00a0 thought they might be enjoying another one and so Eirene joined us at the age of nine months. Now you already know how we got started. If you're interested about the progress of our breeding program and our further Afghan Hounds we would like to invite you to take a tour on our website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof Meadow Valley Afghan Hounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRia & Toni Wagner\n\n\nBolandenstr. 8\n\n\n68753 Wagh\u00e4usel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphone: 0049 (0)7254 73547",

        "text":"PDog Pet Home : About\n\nOur Story\n\nAmy Barker, CPDT-KA, and Daniel Pringle\nIn November 2013 we were given an amazing opportunity to buy Prairie Dog from Don and Cyndi Cutler, founders and owners since 2009. Thanks to them, Prairie Dog has become a community place in which people and dogs mingle (and get treats). We are proud to carry on their values and their dream in this adventure.\n\nThis is our first endeavor as business owners, but Prairie Dog embodies many things that we deeply care about. Before Amy began working at Prairie Dog in 2010 she had a career in the photography industry but had really discovered a passion for dog training while learning to live with her troublesome but lovable pound-rescued Husky-Malamute, Loki. While she\u2019d grown up with family dogs, Loki gave her a challenge that inspired her curiosity. She found a natural talent for working with dogs, interpreting dog behavior, and sharing her knowledge to create happy dogs and relieved owners. That experience motivated her to begin teaching at Diamonds in the Ruff, a positive reinforcement school focusing on the pet-owner relationship, and eventually became a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT-KA). Dan also grew up with pets and has a unique respect and care for animals. He\u2019s a librarian at Spokane Public Library, where he helps people find information and connect to resources to enhance their lives. This means you may not see him around the store much, but he\u2019ll be involved with our web presence here and on Facebook. In our free time, we can often be spotted outdoors hiking or snowshoeing with our Samoyed, Piper, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Declan.\n\nOur Values\n\nWe believe in the importance of nutrition to dogs\u2019 and cats\u2019 health, behavior, and overall happiness. We have learned from experience that animals will thrive on a natural and holistic diet honoring their evolutionary development and free from cheap fillers and byproducts. We saw our cat Casper live an almost annoyingly full life after bouncing back from two close call surgeries with struvite crystals thanks to a diet of high-quality raw food and herbal supplements. Loki also lived on to aggravate and delight us in spite of kidney problems when we changed him to a higher quality food. Our current four-legged family, including Piper, Declan (above), kittens Birdie and Frankie, and Griffin, a stripedy cat, continues to fill our days with love, joy, and gratitude because of the delicious, natural food they get. Not to mention the never ending supply of new toys, catnip, and bully sticks. The cats love to eat so much it seems like that\u2019s all they ever talk about!\n\nWe know the science behind pet nutrition is constantly evolving, so we strive to keep up-to-date on nutrition issues and monitor food manufacturers to make sure we\u2019re carrying only the finest pet food available. We will continue to employ people with special interests and expertise in health and animal behavior.\n\nThe second guiding principle we have is that small, local businesses provide things that you won\u2019t find somewhere else, like community and personalized service that points you toward products suited to the needs of you and your pets. We think businesses have an obligation to their customers and their local economy. We each have a role in a mutually beneficial relationship and by supporting each other we both win. And we take to heart our promise to give you the highest quality natural products we can find in a sustainable and responsible way.\n\nAbove all, we respect the special relationships people have with their pets. We consider it an honor to serve our customers, and believe that our store is one way to nurture the human-animal bond.\nOur Pets\nBargle Family\n\nDon & Cyndi's Farewell\n\nFive years ago we opened Prairie Dog Pet Mercantile. While we'd had experience in a variety of endeavors, this was a first in the retail industry. Our lack of knowledge was invigorating and intimidating. Thanks to you, our customers, the store was a great success.\n\nSeveral years ago we were fortunate to meet and hire Amy Barker. Most of our current customers know Amy well, since she's pretty much been managing the place for the past year or so. She's a Certified Professional Dog Trainer and now, a retail store owner. Amy and her husband, Dan Pringle, have purchased the Prairie Dog from us. They are off to a fast start, and hopefully in the next month or so they'll have news about a relocation to a new, larger store space (very near the present one). If you visit the Prairie Dog, you'll see the same faces you're used to: Stacy, Jesse, Kim, Cathy, and even sometimes--still--Don or Cyndi. (Selling the store doesn't mean we're gone forever!) More likely, however, you might spot us around town with a grandchild or dog in tow. Please say hi!\n\nWe're proud of the store's success and the \"Best of\" awards, but we treasure most the people and animals we've met. Over the past five years more than 5,000 unique people visited our store, along with more than 1,000 dogs, cats, a camel, several wallaroos, macaws, a hedgehog, and more (including a curious moose). We've made countless new friends, discovered new things about others and ourselves, and had a great time.\n\nAmy and Dan are looking forward to continuing the Prairie Dog tradition of great customer service, science-based nutrition information, training tips (and classes), and a broad selection of pet-related merchandise. In addition, they'll be adding their own enhancements to the business, putting their special touches on it.\n\nWe're excited for the opportunity they have, and we're deeply grateful for the loyal support and many kind words from our customers.\n\nThank you!\nDon and Cyndi Cutler\n\nOur Team\n\nKim Imel, LVT, CPDT-KA\n\nKim has been in the pet care industry, starting her career in veterinary medicine, since 1988 and has been a professional dog trainer\/instructor with Diamonds in the Ruff since 1998. Kim is the program coordinator for the Pawsitive Dog Training \u2013 Prison Program at Airway Heights Corrections Center, which is one of her greatest joys. In 2009 she joined the PDog team and loves working with the rest of the staff and all of the clients.\u00a0\n\nFor fun Kim enjoys spending time with family and friends, knitting for charity and working with and playing with her \u2018fur kids\u2019 which consist of two cats, Dawson and Ella, and two dogs, Mackenzie and Wrigley.\nAlice Holcomb\nAlice\u2019s background in retail makes her a great asset to customers looking for something new for their furry friends to try. With three granddogs and two rescued Maine Coon cats of her own, she has plenty of opportunities to spoil them with food, treats, and toys, giving her knowledge that she can share with you. A Master Gardener, she also loves working in her yard and spending time with her granddaughter.\n\nVicki Barker\nAfter 35 years in customer service, Vicki \u201cretired\u201d in December 2012. Now she spends her time snow skiing, swimming and doing Agility with her Border Collie rescues Sally and Oliver. She is also a dog trainer and assistant at Diamonds in the Ruff. She enjoys working with and training dogs. She and husband Bill raised two daughters and currently have a family of three cats along with the two dogs. She is excited to be learning more about Prairie Dog, pet nutrition and assisting Amy in the operation of the retail store every day.\u00a0\n\nKim Howard\nKim is a true farm girl and brings a real love for animals to Prairie Dog. She currently keeps a dozen chickens, one duck, two donkeys, a bossy tuxedo cat, two adorable Coonhounds and a special black Labrador retriever named Lucy on her spread outside of town. The hounds are a particular love of hers, and she has volunteered in the past with a local hound rescue. We are glad to have Kim on the PDog team.\n\nRyan Simmons\nRyan was raised north of Spokane in the small town of Newport. He has been around dogs and cats his whole life. There was never a time when there wasn\u2019t an animal or two in the house. Since moving to Spokane in 2008, Ryan has taught preschool and loves it! He also loves to go hiking, camping, and spend time outdoors with his golden doodle Louis (or Louie depending, on his behavior). Ryan is also a ferocious volleyball player.\nLisa Nielsen\nLisa was a polo pony trainer\/manager around the country and Canada for fifteen years before another career at FedEx.\u00a0On top of working at Prairie Dog, Lisa also runs the hydro-treadmill at PhysioPaws and loves helping dogs during their healing process. It is very rewarding.\u00a0Her current hobby is taking her English Setter Tux to conformation dog shows in the area. She and Tux are members of Spokane Kennel Club and Puget Sound English Setter Club, and have made many new dog show friends.\n\nDakota Eckenroth\n\nDakota grew up with dogs, but it wasn't until she started volunteering with rescues in Los Angeles that she discovered her passion for working with them. While trying to break into the film industry she filled her free time volunteering, starting with simple walks and working up to basic obedience classes with under-socialized dogs. She started a job at a doggy daycare, which also sold high quality pet food and products. This sparked an interest in pet nutrition. Combining her love of education and animals she started at Prairie Dog in spring 2016, where she now gets to talk to pet parents about their fur babies and learn from her awesome co-workers every day. In her free time she enjoys hanging out with her handsome mutt Fenris and exploring her new home of Spokane.\u00a0\n\nStephanie Recla\n\nStephanie grew up in an animal loving home. If there was ever an animal in need her family would bring them in and care for them. After three years of service in the Air Force and graduating college, she worked in the corporate world until drawn back to working with animals again. Her true passion is to be able to care for animals and learn everything possible about pet nutrition to give them the best lives we can. She currently has... (truncated)",
