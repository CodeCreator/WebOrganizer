Programming language support to ensure that programs correctly enforce their security policies would help, but, to date, no language has the ability to verify the enforcement of the kinds of policies used in practice---dynamic, stateful policies which address a broad range of concerns including forms of access control and information flow tracking.\n\nThis paper makes two main contributions. First, we present Fine, a new source-level security-typed language that, through the use of a simple module system and dependent, refinement, and affine types, can be used to check the enforcement of dynamic security policies applied to real software. Second, we define DCIL, a small extension to the type system of the .NET Common Intermediate Language, and show how to compile Fine in a type-preserving manner to DCIL. Our approach allows Fine programs to run on stock .NET virtual machines and to interface with .NET libraries. Additionally, our type-preserving compiler allows code consumers to download DCIL programs and check them for security while relying on a small trusted computing base.\n\nWe have proved our source and target languages sound, our compilation type-preserving, and have made a prototype implementation of our compiler and several example programs available.\n\n}, author = {Nikhil Swamy and Juan Chen and Ravi Chugh}, month = {August}, number = {MSR-TR-2009-98}, title = {End-to-end Verification of Security Enforcement is Fine (Extended version)}, url = {http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/apps\/pubs\/default.aspx?id=101585}, year = {2009}, }",

These noble individuals have selflessly given in the pursuit of community and open source excellence.\n\n\nJan Gei\u00dfler\n\nAfter school, Jan Gei\u00dfler worked for about 10 years as a Chef in different Restaurants varying from traditional regional to fine dining. Along the way he played in a semi-professional rock band, which occupied the rest of his life.\n\nGetting tired of working on weekends, public holidays and every night Jan decided at the age of 30 to do a fresh start in a different industry, so he began an apprenticeship as application developer at OScomputing AG in Frankfurt am Main. From that time on his focus has been building Web Applications in Java-Environments. Jan started using Liferay with Version 6.0.6, when a customer had requirements which Liferay nearly met. From that time on his company began to focus on using Liferay as a Portal Container and has developed various custom made solutions for different customers.\n\nJan started posting in the Forum to get help, because at that time the documentation was kind of not there. Now he tries to help other people, because he knows how difficult it can be starting to work with Liferay. He is also a big fan of OpenSource Projects, because they give you the possibility to participate, and you can always dig through the code to see why something is not working as expected.\n\nAniceto P Madrid\n\nAniceto P\u00e9rez y Madrid is CEO and founder of Innovasoft Proyectos y Servicios, based in Madrid, Spain. He started working with Liferay since version 4.2.\n\nAniceto has been focused in Liferay portlets using JSF technologies and Vaadin, and lately with Liferay MVC portlets. He has also worked with other plugins: ext, themes, services, and hooks, mainly to add or customize Liferay funcionality.\n\nThe long expertise in Java and other related technologies has led Aniceto to debug Liferay Portal source code. This and the launch of Marketplace and some customer requests have led Aniceto to actively contribute to Liferay in some areas, and also to be involved with the Liferay developer community, not only in the development area but also with active participation in Liferay Forums.\n\nOne of Aniceto's target is to replace current web platforms with Liferay and portletize customer bussiness apps because with Liferay a lot of work is already done. Not an easy task.\n\nAnother area of Innovasoft Proyectos y Servicios current activity are real estate, statistics and project management and retail mainly as web applications.\n\nAniceto has a Master in Communications by the Escuela Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicacion, Madrid 1983. He worked in digital radio communications, hardware, firmware, systems and softwate design, development, testing and integration. He founded Innovasoft Proyectos y Servicios in 1996 as a Software Consulting company for long-term relationship with customers. That strategy has soften the cuts due to current financial crisis.\n\nDavid Kubitza\n\nDavid came to Liferay while comparing different portal systems for his master's thesis in 2012. At first he didn't know anything about Liferay, and found it in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals. David works with different open source programs and always loved the way open source projects and communities work together, and so was very interested in Liferay.\n\nBecause Liferay has a community version that's free to use, David used it for a first try and was excited about it. David wrote his thesis at a mid-sized company and had to convince them. He showed them his first try with Liferay and the company decided to fund a prototype of it in using Liferay EE 6.1 GA1 as a test with a demo license. At the end of David's thesis they decided to start working on the production system with Liferay. Because of different requirements David had to do lots of different things in Liferay and also found lots of bugs. Coming from other open source projects, David is a regular IRC user and so visited the #liferay IRC channel to discuss bugs, features etc., get some help, and give some help back to other users.\n\n\nPrakash Khanchandani\n\nPrakash Khanchandani is currently working in Fulcrum World Wide\u00a0as a Senior Liferay Developer, creating liferay portlets and mentoring team members to pick-up Liferay.\n\nPrakash has been working in Liferay since 2009, starting with version 5.2 CE and has gone \u00a0through upgrades of 6.0 CE to EE --> 6.1 GA1 EE --> 6.1 GA2 EE.\n\nPrakash has always been a believer in increasing knowledge & expertise through sharing and he really like the healthy atmosphere of the Liferay community's sharing and open source philosophy where everybody benefits. Hence, he tries to share whatever he has learned from the community and give it in one form or the other through liferay forums, wikis and through other sites like stackoverflow.com [Prakash's profile].\n\nPrakash graduated from Mumbai University, India, in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering and started his career in 2007 with programming in C, C++ and Java. \u00a0For the last 4 years he has only been working on developing Java Web applications using frameworks like Struts 1.3, Spring, Hibernate and now portal development with Liferay.\n\nVictor Zorin\n\nVictor Zorin, an Enterprise Architect of MyOffice24x7, (also is known as a rocket scientist due his to PhD in Aerospace Technologies), based in Australia, started working with Liferay 8 years ago on Version 3.\n\nVictor has implemented a number of mission-critical real\u2013time solutions across many industries. These include defence, aviation, telecommunication, financial services, security, international trade, small and medium Enterprises. Most of his attention is now in the area of developing applications that enable effective use of Liferay Portal for Business, and not just as CMS\/collaboration\/intranet tool. Let Liferay be a better version of SAP!!!\n\nVictor enjoys working for and with Liferay Community with active participation in the forums, mostly in the development area. When Victor is dead tired he can be found walking the streets of Bayside, drinking long black in the local caf\u00e9s and sailing his 470 in Port Phillip bay.\n\nJignesh Vachhani\n\nJignesh has been involved with Liferay from the start of his career in 2008. Gradually, his interest increased toward Liferay with his experience. Initially Jignesh learned a lot and in fact is still learning from Liferay's Blogs, Wikis, and Forums. \u00a0He then started to contribute his own knowledge to the community using forum posts (more than 700 of them). Jignesh is also member of BugSquad.\n\nApart from his contributions on liferay.com, Jignesh has also started a blog \u00a0at www.liferaysolution.com around 2 years ago, sharing useful Liferay development tricks faced during project execution. \u00a0The blog currently \u00a0has more than 100 blog posts and more than 250,000 visitors (some of which are regular visitors). Jignesh is also an active member of LIUG (Liferay's India User Group) and recently coordinated a meetup in Ahmedabad area. He also guides and encourages other interested liferay developers to participate in liferay collaboration activity, especially within his organization (and Liferay partner, CIGNEX Datamatics) since 2008. Jignesh has been involved in more than 13 Liferay projects (from the US, UK, EMEA, and APAC) as a Liferay tech lead and have provided predominant solutions.\n\nJignesh completed his Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science in 2008 from Faculty of Technology (DDU, Nadiyad), and wants to contribute as much as he can to the Liferay platform directly or indirectly using liferay.com and its collaboration activity.\n\n\nJelmer Kuperus\n\nSince 1999, Jelmer Kuperus has been a Java Developer working for Orange11, a Dutch company. Jelmer is well known and very active in the security community and has discovered and reported security issues in notable software products such as Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player, Shockwave Flash, Acrobat Reader, ICQ, Winamp and many others.\n\nJelmer has been using Liferay on commercial projects since 2010, but begun his Liferay Community involvement as early as 2004, providing feedback to the open source community on ways to improve its architecture and security. He is very active on the forums (with 1000+ posts, most of which answers to questions posted in the development category), and has filed numerous bugs in JIRA, some of which are security related and include contributed patches that resolve the issue. He participated in the 100 papercuts program, and is always willing to help out on IRC when he has the time, and has also contibuted to Juan Fern\u00e1ndez' WordPress Importer Portlet, and most recently has been working on a Liferay plugin for Gradle.\n\nTejas Kanani\n\nTejas Kanani has been involved with the Liferay Community since 2009. He initially started with version 4.4.2 and is now using Liferay 6.1. He is active in BugSquad and also a member of Liferay India User Group(LIUG).
