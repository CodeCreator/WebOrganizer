DECIMAL_DIG is the minimum number of decimal digits required in order for any floating point type to survive the round trip to decimal and back, and it is generally larger than LDBL_DIG. since the exact formula is non-trivial, and defining it larger than necessary may be legal but wasteful, just define the right value in bits\/float.h.\n2012-02-25use __attribute__((const)) on arm __pthread_self functionRich Felker-1\/+3\n2012-02-15add float_t and double_t to math.hRich Felker-0\/+9\n2012-02-09replace bad cancellation cleanup abi with a sane oneRich Felker-37\/+0\nthe old abi was intended to duplicate glibc's abi at the expense of being ugly and slow, but it turns out glib was not even using that abi except on non-gcc-compatible compilers (which it doesn't even support) and was instead using an exceptions-in-c\/unwind-based approach whose abi we could not duplicate anyway without nasty dwarf2\/unwind integration. the new abi is copied from a very old glibc abi, which seems to still be supported\/present in current glibc. it avoids all unwinding, whether by sjlj or exceptions, and merely maintains a linked list of cleanup functions to be called from the context of pthread_exit. i've made some care to ensure that longjmp out of a cleanup function should work, even though it is not required to. this change breaks abi compatibility with programs which were using pthread cancellation, which is unfortunate, but that's why i'm making the change now rather than later. considering that most pthread features have not been usable until recently anyway, i don't see it as a major issue at this point.\n2012-01-20add prlimit syscall wrapperRich Felker-0\/+2\n2011-10-17fix some details in ugly stuff that doesn't belong in libcRich Felker-6\/+6\npatches by sh4rm4, presumably needed to make gdb or some similar junk happy...\n2011-10-15don't define wchar_t on c++Rich Felker-0\/+6\nit's a keyword in c++ (wtf). i'm not sure this is the cleanest solution; it might be better to avoid ever defining __NEED_wchar_t on c++. but in any case, this works for now.\n2011-10-05fix fcntl O_* flags for armRich Felker-4\/+4\nno idea why these 4 are permuted and the rest are standard\/generic\n2011-10-01typo (copy 2) in arm reloc.hRich Felker-1\/+1\n2011-10-01typo in arm reloc.hRich Felker-1\/+1\n2011-10-01first attempt at arm dynamic linkingRich Felker-0\/+26\n2011-09-22\"optimize\" arm __pthread_selfRich Felker-4\/+1\nactually this is just to avoid gcc being stupid and refusing to inline the function version, even when the size cost is essentially identical whether it's inlined or not.\n2011-09-22fix x86_64 user.h (previously was just a copy of i386)Rich Felker-48\/+13\n2011-09-22cleanup\/debloat i386 user.hRich Felker-43\/+11\n2011-09-22wrong __WORDSIZE in x86_64 headerRich Felker-1\/+1\n2011-09-21update syscalls with off_t arguments to handle argument alignment, if neededRich Felker-3\/+6\nthe arm syscall abi requires 64-bit arguments to be aligned on an even register boundary. these new macros facilitate meeting the abi requirement without imposing significant ugliness on the code.\n2011-09-19fix the definition of struct statvfs to match lsb abiRich Felker-44\/+18\nat the same time, make struct statfs match the traditional definition and make it more useful, especially the fsid_t stuff.\n2011-09-19cleanup redundancy in bits\/signal.h versionsRich Felker-372\/+31\n2011-09-19fix the type of wchar_t on arm; support wchar_t varying with archRich Felker-6\/+14\nreally wchar_t should never vary, but the ARM EABI defines it as an unsigned 32-bit int instead of a signed one, and gcc follows this nonsense. thus, to give a conformant environment, we have to follow (otherwise L\"\"[0] and L'\\0' would be 0U rather than 0, but the application would be unaware due to a mismatched definition for WCHAR_MIN and WCHAR_MAX, and Bad Things could happen with respect to signed\/unsigned comparisons, promotions, etc.). fortunately no rules are imposed by the C standard on the relationship between wchar_t and wint_t, and WEOF has type wint_t, so we can still make wint_t always-signed and use -1 for WEOF.\n2011-09-19fix incorrect long double parameters on arm (and other future ports)Rich Felker-10\/+10\nthis was the cause of crashes in printf when attempting to print floating point values.\n2011-09-18initial commit of the arm portRich Felker-0\/+2076\nthis port assumes eabi calling conventions, eabi linux syscall convention, and presence of the kernel helpers at 0xffff0f?0 needed for threads support. otherwise it makes very few assumptions, and the code should work even on armv4 without thumb support, as well as on systems with thumb interworking. the bits headers declare this a little endian system, but as far as i can tell the code should work equally well on big endian. some small details are probably broken; so far, testing has been limited to qemu\/aboriginal linux.\n2011-09-18cleanup more bits cruft (sysmacros and socket)Rich Felker-413\/+0\n2011-09-18more bits junk (tcp.h)Rich Felker-2\/+0\n2011-09-18move invariant netinet\/in.h stuff out of bits\/in.hRich Felker-290\/+0\n2011-08-23security hardening: ensure suid programs have valid stdin\/out\/errRich Felker-0\/+10\nthis behavior (opening fds 0-2 for a suid program) is explicitly allowed (but not required) by POSIX to protect badly-written suid programs from clobbering files they later open. this commit does add some cost in startup code, but the availability of auxv and the security flag will be useful elsewhere in the future. in particular auxv is needed for static-linked vdso support, which is still waiting to be committed (sorry nik!)\n2011-08-14typo in macro definitions for x86_64Rich Felker-1\/+1\n2011-08-06ensure the compiler does not move around thread-register-based readsRich Felker-2\/+2\nif gcc decided to move this across a conditional that checks validity of the thread register, an invalid thread-register-based read could be performed and raise sigsegv.\n2011-07-21socket headers macro adjustment - workaround for buggy programsRich Felker-2\/+2\nsome program was undefining AF_NETLINK and thereby breaking AF_ROUTE...\n2011-06-25fix some symbol resolution issues in dynamic linkerRich Felker-0\/+2\n1. search was wrongly beginning with lib itself rather than dso head 2. inconsistent resolution of function pointers for functions in plt\n2011-06-25move all limits that don't vary out of bits\/limits.h, into main limits.hRich Felker-53\/+2\n2011-06-25proper path searching for dynamic linkerRich Felker-0\/+4\nfirst, use $LD_LIBRARY_PATH unless suid. if that fails, read path from \/etc\/ld-musl-$ARCH.path and fallback to a builtin default.\n2011-06-18experimental dynamic linker!Rich Felker-0\/+54\nsome notes: - library search path is hard coded - x86_64 code is untested and may not work - dlopen\/dlsym is not yet implemented - relocations in read-only memory won't work\n201...
