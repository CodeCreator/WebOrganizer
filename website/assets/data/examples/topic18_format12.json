This may include a time of singing, a testimony and a thought for the day. It is appreciated by residents and staff alike.\n\nmighty-oaks\u00a0 Mighty Oaks is a project staffed by volunteers from Christian denominations in the town. Its aim is to give away high quality hot drinks to Alnwick\u2019s late nighters \u2013 currently serving between 10pm-1am on Saturday nights in the Market Place \u2013 and to demonstrate God\u2019s love in a practical way. We\u00a0rely on the donations of\u00a0individuals, churches and local organisations for which we are immensely grateful. We work closely with the local police and have a good relationship with them. The leaflets that we carry are funded by TES ( and our milk each week is generously provided by Willowtree Service Station, Alnwick.\n\nAs a church, we are strong supporters of Christians Against Poverty and have our own centre with a manager. We also have a large number of support workers who are all volunteers.\n\nCAP: Each year we look for the opportunity to sponsor an event to support CAP's work. Are you participating in a marathon, half-marathon, Lake Swims, cycling etc etc and would like to adopt CAP as your chosen charity? If so please contact Chris Friend at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\n\nHaving made contact with the community centre in 2011 and established the needs of the centre, a number of volunteers are now helping out by way of support for after schools clubs, administration and leaflet drops. This support for the Manager and her team has been well received and we look forward to an ongoing strong relationship.\n\nAs a church, along with other churches and organisations in the town we are partnering to help individuals and families who are on or below the poverty line. We do this through using agencies such as CAB for referrals and provide food parcels through the Salvation Army Shop acting as the 'frontline' as well as making sure that Surestart Childrens Centre and Gallery Youth are provided for. Currently the food store is based at ABC but we are hoping to find something more suitable and permanent in due course. There is a big and enthusiastic team of volunteers who help sort, pack and deliver parcels. A number of churches also hold emergency parcels so that local need can be met by local people.

        "text":"About the UsefulBible website\n\nDear Friends and Dear Readers,\n\nLet me invite you to study the Bible with us at usefulbible.com. We have more than 1500 articles for you to read, and several books that you can download freely.\n\nOur particular subject is what the original authors of the Bible believed. Our method is to study a whole Bible book, and every verse of that book in turn. However, if your time is short, you can turn to any article and read our notes on it.\n\nPeople across the world read our articles, and they differ much, both in their knowledge of the Bible and of the English language. We try hard to make our articles useful to everyone who uses the website. For that reason, all our articles are in EasyEnglish, a simple English system that Wycliffe Associates UK \/ MissionAssist UK designed, with a 2800 word vocabulary. For the benefit of those readers with a good knowledge of the Bible, we give plenty of Bible references. In that way, these studies can be the beginning of a much deeper study of the subjects.\n\nPerhaps it may interest you to know how this work began. Back in 2003, I was the speaker at a church meeting locally. The leader of that meeting was my good friend, Professor Barrie Wetherill, who set up Wycliffe Associates in the UK. Before the meeting, he spoke to me about the EasyEnglish Bible commentaries (books to explain the Bible) that they were writing to assist the work of Bible translation across the world. They needed people with skills like mine, and soon afterwards, I became one of their authors, then the leader of their commentary team.\n\nI was pleased to do that work for several years. However, I wanted to provided my readers with articles that would help them to study the Bible in more detail. That was why, in 2010, I set up usefulbible.com.\n\nIt is very wonderful to share these Bible studies with so many people across the world. However, it will be even more wonderful if, by them, you will learn to know God better and to trust him more. May the God of the Bible teach you through his own precious word!\n\nKeith Simons\n\nPlease write to me if you wish to tell me your opinions about any of the articles, or your experiences with the website. Please mention your country, and if you represent a church. Email: office3@usefulbible.com",

In 2011 the primary legal\u00a0name\u00a0was changed to PARAGON CHRISTIAN ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL, INC. to\u00a0better express the vision and purpose of the ministry maintaining the former name as a tradename.

We offer an affiliation program for ministries for the purpose of fellowship and networking.\nOne of the primary missions of\u00a0PCAI is fulfilled through its educational divisions - Omega Bible Institute & Seminary and Evangel Christian University of America - training hundreds of indigenous ministers and those wanted to learn more about the Bible\u00a0in many countries and in the USA. Students from numerous denominations enroll in a par excellence study program to earn a bachelor, master, or doctorate degree.\u00a0 When you become a member of PCAI, you become part of the vision to educate laymen and ministers around the globe for the glory of God.\u00a0\n\nA ministry TO and FOR ministry professionals,\u00a0PCAI is committed to helping individuals like YOU move forward in the work HE has called you to.
