Shri Gurujee is the source and inspiration in the\u00a0 construction of 217 Shirdi Sai temples in India and abroad , thus leading millions of devotees to tread the path\u00a0 of Sai \u2014\u00a0 shraddha and saburi\u201d.\n\nUnder the leadership of Shri Gurujee ,\u00a0 the Sai Movement in India has traversed the\u00a0 entire\u00a0 landscape of the country and today the entire spiritual landscape of India reverberates with the presence of Shirdi Sai devotees , catalysed by building of Shirdi Sai temples in almost all major locations ( including remote locations)\u00a0 in India\u00a0\u00a0 like Assam, HP, Jammu, Andamans , Kolkatta, Odisha , Bhatinda, Tirupati, Ambala, Dahej,Solan, etc .thus taking the teachings of humanism, tolerance, purity and love as taught by the perfect master \u00a0Sadguru Shri Shirdi Sai amongst\u00a0 the populace .These temples built under guidance of Shri Gurujee also undertake relief work\/ activities ( during natural calamities) etc . thus establishing that service of fellow beings is serving God.\n\nShri Gurujee has shaped up the Sai Movement into a gigantic spiritual force\u00a0 which helps the devotees to infuse their daily lives with purity of conduct as postulated and depicted in the \u201cShri Sai Charitra\u201d . Shri Gurujee \u00a0always emphasizes upon utmost relevance of daily reading of this sacred book \u201cShri Sai Charitra\u201d to seek answers to all the queries vexing the mind of a traveler.. ..\n\nDuring the Ardh Kumbh Melas and Purn Kumbh Melas (held in Prayag ), Camps \u00a0patronized by Shree Gurujee are organized wherein \u00a0Shri Shirdi Sai Idol `s are installed ; \u00a0prayers, discourses etc are organized\u00a0 \u00a0to take the teachings of the Shirdi Sai to people \/ devotees visiting the Kumbh , enthused with devotion\u00a0 .\n\nShri Gurujee has been instrumental in spreading the teachings of humanism , love and tolerance as taught by Shri Shirdi Sai\u00a0\u00a0 to make the world more cohesive functional unit by supporting the publications of scores of magazines in varied languages\u00a0 like Telugu, Marathi, Assamese, Odia, Hindi, English etc so that the teachings of the master reaches all . The sudden surge in the publications on Shri Shirdi Sai\u00a0 across the country stands witness to the growing urge of the people to seek more information about the teachings and life of the Shirdi Sai catalysed by the Sai Movement ushered in by revered Shri Gurujee ; innumerable\u00a0 temples\u00a0 built under His guidance \u00a0today help the devotees to find a reference point to start travelling within thus achieving harmony .Scores of websites today spread His teachings.\n\nShri Gurujee has extensively used music to take the teachings of Shri Shirdi Sai to His devotees. Music contained in CD \u201c Living with Sai\u201d , \u201cThubhyam Namami \u201d released by Times Music, India have popularized the teachings of Shri Shirdi Sai motivating its the listeners to visit Shirdi to learn more about the Sadguru Shree Shirdi Sai and follow the path of humanism as shown by Him.\n\nMedical Camps are organized by these temples to help provide relief to the needy thus establishing the principle ofnar seva , narayan seva(i.e\u00a0 serving human beings is serving God)\u00a0 amongst every one.\n\nWith blessings of Shri Shirdi Sai, millions of devotees of Baba living in almost all\u00a0 locations in India like Jammu, Kangra, Pilibhit, Guwhati, Andamans, Delhi, Moradabad, Allahabad, Surat, Ajmer,Chennai, Ahmednagar, Gurgaon, Sambalpur, Hubli, Kolkatta, Bhopal\u00a0 etc\u00a0 assemble together\u00a0 to partke the Sai ambrosia spreading the message of\u00a0 humanism and love .\n\n!!

The initiative helps bring young people to the Negev, specifically to low socioeconomic areas; improving the quality of life for all around them.\n\nThe Coalition is working with Young Communities on the second stage on the movement's development to help communities become sustainable.\n\nThis program supports and guides\u00a0young adult communities in their efforts to develop and provide significant and stable social service projects in the Negev. In this project the Negev Funding Coalition partners with the Jewish Agency as well as the Shahaf and the Gandyr Foundations, two leading Israeli philanthropic bodies in the young adult field.\u00a0\n\nGoals of the Project\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Identifying opportunities and building capacity and skills necessary for the implementation of the sustainable social projects, that are needed in the communities and meaningful for the participants\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creating a shared culture between young communities and the surrounding environment, as well as nine communities themselves\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Encouraging pluralism and tolerance through networking of different communities, religious and secular.\n\nWhat the Coalition does\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gives professional tools, assistance and support to the selected young communities in the Negev.

A feeling of shared endeavor, a shared spiritual labor. There is a lot of strength in our group, a sense of vivacity.\n\nWhat words characterize the project for you?\n\nInnovation, building a community, a feeling of being together, family, future, shared effort, caring for each other, giving, positivity, connection, ideals.\n\n\nHila Nahun-EfratiKama Community\n\nThe communal unit is a program to set up and assist young communities made up from across the social spectrum in the socio-geographic periphery of Israel. The program enables young people from all walks of life to receive the tools and guidance to establish a community and reveals to many young people the possibility of an active and leadership lifestyle in Israeli society.\n\nI am \"unbiased\" although I work in the program; I think that the young communities in Israel can create tangible positive social change in Israeli society and more. There will be more young people like these that can minimize the social and economic gaps between the center of the country and the periphery. And Israeli society will be more solidified and cohesive.\n\nWhat words characterize the project for you?\n\nInnovation, social change, community building, a feeling of being together, family, future, building the State of Israel, a shared effort, caring for each other, commitment, connection, ideals, modern Zionism.\n\n\nThe project enables the community to \"go up a notch\" in its productivity in putting projects in action, both those from point of view of the importance of setting up a community and also from the point of view of the projects' importance. The project gives a lot of professional tools, assistance and support without which it would be practically impossible to carry out this project.\n\n\nOnce a week, either Thursday evening or Friday morning, we set aside time for the community. The Community Day begins with a communal meal that different members of the community prepare. We talk about life in the community, make shared decisions and learn together about to concretize social interaction in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does\u00a0being part of\u00a0this Negev Funding Coalition project\u00a0mean to you?

        "text":"Growing up in rural North Carolina, the social environment matched well my proclivity toward being introverted. Even today, I am uncomfortable in large crowds. I also harbored an intense dislike, bordering on fear, of speaking in public or to strangers. Perhaps the majority of the problem hinged upon my severe speech impediment. Regardless of the cause, the idea of being a missionary, had I even ever entertained it, would have seemed more unlikely than becoming an astronaut.\n\nIt is a testimony to the fact that nothing is impossible with God. I serve as a missionary not because I desired to, or because I was equipped to, but rather because I am compelled to. God called me in such a way the call was undeniable and I now serve at His pleasure.\n\nAgua Viva Ministries was begun with the full knowledge that I had no real idea of what I was doing. My desire was to serve God, how exactly was a mystery. In the years that have transpired, I have learned more about God and myself than I ever imagined possible. On top of that, God has brought into my life some very amazing people, who have blessed my life tremendously by their friendship.\n\nIn the very beginning, there was a small group of guys who said they would stand with me. They became the Trustees of the ministry and were a source of great encouragement. God then began to bring strangers into my circle of acquaintances that rapidly grew into supporters both spiritually and financially.They also played a large role in helping me hear God\u2019s voice in formulating a vision for the ministry.\n\nI am incapable of expressing how grateful I am for what God has done in my life and the way He has accomplished it. Below are just a few bullet points to illustrate how this ministry has grown and God be praised for His goodness and faithfulness.\n\n  \u2022 1988 first trip to Costa Rica\n  \u2022 Nov. 1991 first trip into the Talamanca Region\n  \u2022 Sept. 1992 formed AVM\n  \u2022 Sept. 1994 purchased lot in Bribri where our home and operations base is now located\n  \u2022 July 1996 began construction on our present building\n  \u2022 Dec. 1996 Daisy and John married\n  \u2022 Feb. 1997 we held our first jungle medical clinic in Bajo Coen.

We greet you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ our Lord.\n    Butiiki Children's Ministry is a pro life giving Ministry. Its aim and mandate is to uphold the scarcity of orphaned, vulnerable, abandoned children with welfare problems that provide these little ones with the necessities of living.\n    It is also a Ministry for Youths and Widows empowerment. We have two branches, our main branch in Jinja holds 62 children and our secondary branch in Namutumba holds 34 children. The two branches are 65 km apart from each other, about 2 hours drive. At our main branch we have two caretakers and a cook, and at our secondary branch, only my mother volunteers as the caretaker.\u00a0\n\n    We currently have a need to send 22 children to school. Currently, 74 out of our 96 children are attending school, but we do not have enough funds to send the last 22 of them to\u00a0the School Systems of Jinja, Uganda.

        "text":"Our History\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church\u2019s heritage, history and growth have been intertwined with that of Lynchburg for over 200 years.\u00a0 Our church was founded in 1815 (some 29 years after Lynchburg was established in 1786) and has served its congregation and the Lynchburg community in four different church locations throughout those years and will into the future.\n\nAs one of the oldest churches in Lynchburg, we are grateful to have had the opportunity to provide a constant spiritual and educational influence in the Lynchburg community.\u00a0 A growing and transforming congregation has led in fostering new churches in the community as well as been leaders in education through the Weekday School and other educational opportunities.\n\nThe First Church\n\n\nThe First Church\n\nInstalled Pastor:\n\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr.William S. Reid (1822-1849)\n\nIn 1813 Dr. William S. Reid began the work of the church through meeting with members of the community in their homes.\u00a0 The beliefs and convictions of this group culminated in forming a new church, First Presbyterian Church, on March 20, 1815.\u00a0 Dr. Reid was appointed pastor at an annual salary of $300!\u00a0 At this time the congregation numbered 15, including two infants.\n\nPerspective: When the church was founded, James Madison was the 4th President of the United States, and Ludwig von Beethoven had just premiered his Symphony No. 8 at age 45.\n\nThe Second Church\n\n\nThe Second ChurchThe 2nd First Presbyterian Church fronting on Main Street in Lynchburg.\n\nNote the absence of a steeple!\u00a0 The building was dedicated in 1858 and served our congregation for almost 41 years.\n\nInstalled Pastors:\n\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. C.R. Vaughan (1849-1858)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Jas. B. Ramsey (1858-1870)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. E.H. Barnett (1870)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Richard Mc Ilwaine (1870-1872)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. William T. Hall (1872-1896)\n\nIn 1854 a severe storm badly damaged the steeple of the original building, requiring the construction of a new building.\u00a0 Then-Pastor Dr. Vaughan contemplated building the new church on the southeast corner of Church and 11th Streets, but property title difficulties caused the new church to be constructed on Main Street.\n\nPerspective:\u00a0During this period James Buchanan was our 15th President.\u00a0 As well, Abraham Lincoln and Stephan Douglas had conducted the first of their famous debates and Theodore Roosevelt was born.\u00a0\n\nThe Third Church\n\n\nThe Third ChurchThe 3rd First Presbyterian Church at 9th and Court Streets\n\nCertainly the steeple is prominent here!\u00a0\n\nInstalled Pastors:\n\n  \u2022 Rev. F.T. McFaden (1896-1904)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Jas. D. Paxton (1904-1930)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. F. Campbell Symonds (1931-1937)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Russell C. Stroup (1938-1950)\n\nBy the early 1880s the congregation had grown considerably.\u00a0\u00a0 By 1898 the congregation numbered 405 members and services were crowded at times. As well, the congregation was growing quickly \u2013 between 1896 and 1897 fifty-one members were added, an increase of 13%.\n\nPerhaps more significantly, by this time a large portion of the congregation now lived south of Main Street, putting them farther from the 1858 church. Dr. Hall, pastor at the time, noted in 1892: \u201cThe growth of the city has been steadily away from the location, increasing the disadvantages every year... We are moving now to get a position where we will be as convenient as possible to the whole congregation.\u201d\n\nSo, the cornerstone for the new (3rd building) was laid on July 5, 1899, at 9th and Court Streets.\u00a0 Between the sale of the old property and contributions, the entire $49,000 was underwritten.\n\nA new wing was added to the church in 1941 to house its Sunday schools and other community education programs.\u00a0 When the property was transferred to the City of Lynchburg in 1998, these spaces would be, and still are, utilized by the Lynchburg Police Department.\n\nDuring the World Wars of the 20th century, 57 men (7%) of the congregation served in the armed forces during World War I. \u00a0A total of 113 men and women served during World War II, 16% of the congregation at the time.\n\nDr. Russell C. Stroup, requested a leave of absence in 1942 in order to join the Chaplains Corps. He served in the 6th Infantry Division in the South Pacific and the Philippines, receiving the Bronze Star for heroism in action at Luzon. He returned to the congregation in 1945.\n\nPerspective:\u00a0In 1900 William McKinley was the 25th President.\u00a0 The Lynchburg Foundry was established, the US went on the gold standard and three local colleges were founded: Randolph\u2013Macon Woman's College (1891), Sweet Briar College, (1902) and Lynchburg College, (1903).\n\nThe Fourth Church\n\n\nThe Fourth ChurchThe 4th First Presbyterian Church \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1215 VES Road, Lynchburg in 1952\n\nInstalled Pastors:\n\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Emmett B. McGukin (1950-1967)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. S. Albert Newman (1965-1966)\n  \u2022 Rev. Herbert B. Barks (1967-1971)\n  \u2022 Rev. Robert A. Helstrom (1970-1976)\n  \u2022 Rev. Jerold D. Shetler (1971-1975)\n  \u2022 Rev. Edward K. Beckes (1974-1977)\n  \u2022 Rev. Timothy L. Croft (1976-1978)\n  \u2022 Rev. Bernard K. Bangley (1977-1980)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. John R. Killinger, Jr.\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Robert H. Bullock, Jr. (1981-1983)\n  \u2022 Rev. John H. Thompson\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Richard Harbison (1987-1997)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. Walter R. Smith (1989-2006)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. James J.H. Price\n  \u2022 Rev. Arthur F. Fogartie (1998-2001)\n  \u2022 Rev. L. Tyler Downing (2001-2005)\n  \u2022 Rev. Dr. John M. Scholer (2002-2014)\n  \u2022 Rev. Meggan Means Farwell (2007-2012)\n  \u2022 Rev. Peter A. Thompson (2016- Present)\n\nAs automobiles came into common use in the 1930s and 1940s, congregants increasingly moved to homes in the suburbs. By 1948 it was evident to members of the Session that the church would need to move.\n\n\u201c . . . Seventy percent of our active membership now resides in the Rivermont-Peakland area.\u00a0 Eighty percent of our Sunday School and eighty-seven percent of our cradle roll babies come from this section (of town).\u00a0 \u201cSince a church is a congregation rather than a building, we are already located in Peakland and it only remains for us to establish our physical facilities where our actual church is.\u201d\n\nThe church building was completed 1952 at a total cost of $490,000.\u00a0 Services began on September 6 of that year, conducted by Dr. Emmett McGukin in the new Sanctuary designed to hold 494 people. Dr. McGukin delivered the first sermon titled, \u201cThe Things Our Fathers Dedicated.\" \u00a0Dr. Stroup was present for the service and delivered a series of vesper services that month.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWhen the 3rd First Presbyterian Church building on Court Street was sold to the First Methodist Church, the contract of sale explicitly authorized First Presbyterian to remove five memorial windows and move them to the V.E.S. Road church.\u00a0 Three of the windows are installed in rear Narthex wall, one is installed in the front wall of the Chapel, and the fifth installed in the rear wall of the Sanctuary over the antiphonal organ.\n\nPlans for the new Sanctuary included installing new stained glass windows on both sidewalls.\u00a0 Funds were raised, and the Sanctuary now features stained glass windows depicting important events in Biblical history.\u00a0 To learn more about the stained glass windows at FPC\u00a0CLICK HERE (link to facilities page or directly to pdf).\n\nThe growth of the Church School, Youth Groups, Men of the Church, Women of the Church, Weekday School, and other church organizations resulted in a 1999 church addition that continues to provide our Fellowship Hall, kitchen facilities, and a number of classrooms.\n\nExpansion and growth continued with the \u201cOur Time To Grow\u201d campaign in the 1990s.\u00a0 Included were an expansion of the Fellowship Hall, expansion of the Narthex, and the addition of our Columbarium Garden.\n\nOur Mission\n\nCelebrating God\u2019s grace, Inspiring the next generation for Christ\u2026 each and every day!!!\n\nContact Us\n\n1215 V.E.S.

Classes learn different books of the Torah each year, starting with the story of creation, until the Jews leaving the desert and beginning to prepare to enter the land of Israel.\n\nLessons on each Jewish holiday will fill the calendar as we proceed from Rosh Hashanah and the High Holidays through the holiday of Shavuot. The students will have a deeper understanding of each holiday and its traditions and customs. Chabad Hebrew School will also host holiday celebrations for our students and their families.\n\nWhy do women and girls\u00a0light Shabbat candles? Why is Shabbat such a special day in the week? Why do we have a Mezuzah on our doors? Why is the bride veiled at a Jewish wedding? This class will teach basic Mitzvot to the younger grades and provide insightful meaning of more complex Mitzvot to the older grades.\n\nAs an added dimension to our student's Hebrew School education, we will be strengthening our students' Prayer skills through the use of a Siddur. All students in Grades\u00a06 are required to have a Siddur at all Hebrew School classes.\nOur goal is to instill confidence in our students' Prayer skills and to enable our students to participate more in Shul, as well as to increase their Hebrew reading and vocabulary skills.\nIn order to derive the most benefit from this enhanced curriculum development, standardized text has been chosen.\nThe\u00a0Siddur Tehilat Hashem\u00a0by Kehot was chosen for its many merits including:\n\n*Large clear print with vowels\n*Numbered lines\n*English Prayer instructions\nIf you need to order the siddur, the Hebrew School has received a bulk discount and we are happy to pass the savings directly to you. The cost price per Siddur is $25.\n\nThe older students of Chabad Hebrew School will follow any current event concerning Jewish issues and Israel. Students are encouraged to bring in newspaper clippings, and discussions will follow, keeping our students well informed of the world and its relationship to the Jewish people.\n\nArt projects are incorporated into our curriculum to add excitement to the upcoming holidays and Mitzvot. Our projects will have Jewish holiday and Mitzvah themes and will add a taste of Jewish life to your home. The younger students will be doing art more often than the older grades.\n\nChabad Hebrew School will offer a variety of extra curricular activities such as special guests, Shabbatons, field trips, contests, etc. These events will allow our students to experience Judaism in its entirety, both in and out of the classroom. More details will follow once the school year begins.\n\nChabad Jewish Centre of Georgina\n\nServing the Jewish Community in the Town of Georgina \u00a0 | \u00a0 (905) 909-8818",

        "text":"Since 1964, University Baptist Church has offered the INternational Neighborhood Coffee Hour (InCH),\n\na weekly opportunity for women from all over the world to gather to socialize, make friends, and improve their English language skills. The program is free, as it has been since its founding, and no pre-registration is required.\n\nTrained and seasoned volunteers lead small groups of women of different levels of proficiency to improve their conversational English skills. For more advanced speakers, ESL and ESOL groups are available. Other volunteers from the church and community provide refreshments and child care for preschool-age children.\n\nThe program follows the Ohio State University calendar; INCH meets every Wednesday that the university is in session, from 9:30 to 11:30am.\n\n\nLongtime UBC member Mary Riley founded INCH in the fall of 1963 with the purpose of providing a regular time of fellowship for international women who felt isolated in their new city because of a lack of language skills or because they had young children at home. The original group gathered for conversation, handiwork (e.g., knitting and quilting), and coffee.\n\nOver the years, more than 1,500 women have attended INCH, representing over eighty different countries. Many of them have been the wives of Ohio State students and visiting scholars; others have been immigrants, refugees, the wives of foreign executives, and new citizens of the United States. Currently, around 85 women regularly participate in INCH, and are accompanied by fifteen to twenty infants and toddlers. About twenty volunteers serve them. Wednesday mornings at UBC are lively, to say the least!\n\n\nAmanda McClafferty has been the director of INCH since 2012. A lifelong member of University Baptist Church, she came to INCH as a young child, accompanying her grandmother, who volunteered with the program for several decades. In her high school and college years, Amanda volunteered as a child care worker, tutor, and kitchen helper.\n\nA 2003 graduate of Ohio State, Amanda works as a teacher in the Columbus Public Schools. She and her husband Kyle are the parents of Stella, 10, and Molly, 6.\n\nAmanda says, \u201cMy experiences with INCH have truly enriched my life. I have early memories of seeing women from all over the world laughing, talking, and enjoying friendship with one another. As I grew, I took with me the knowledge that the world may appear to be large and full of challenges, but for two hours a week, the world was very small, and only as complicated as whether one enjoys coffee or tea with a cookie!\n\nGet more information about INCH\n\nName *",

This is a path that begins with the hearing of the Good News of Jesus as the one who gave his life for us so that we may have life, and who calls us to be his disciples. This announcement or proclamation of the Good News, when heard deeply and responded to personally, brings us into a living relationship with Jesus. As Pope Benedict XVI has shared, \u201cBeing Christian is not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea, but the encounter with an event, a person, which gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction\u201d (Deus Caritas Est 1).\n\nOur ongoing growth as disciples entails a deepening relationship with Jesus through prayer and our witness to his life in relationship to others, growth in knowledge and understanding of the faith, participation in the sacramental and liturgical life of the Church and sharing in Jesus\u2019 mission by making disciples of others.\n\nThe Catholic Life & Faith Formation team supports parish life in this encounter by sharing and advancing best practices for parish evangelisation and facilitating formation opportunities and resources that empower parishes to invite people into relationship with Jesus and to form their people in a living, explicit and fruitful faith.\n\nWe seek to support parishes and local communities of faith to be ever more effective agents of evangelisation, recognising that clarity of mission, leadership that bears fruit, and the creation of practical pathways for people to encounter Jesus and to live as His disciple are key to the spiritual vitality of our parishes and people.

Although Masonry is believed to be the oldest surviving fraternal organization in the world, the exact date of its founding is uncertain. Freemasonry can, however, be easily traced to sixteenth century Scotland although the first Masonic governing body was not founded until 1717 in London. By 1723, the Constitutions of the Freemasons were assembled and published, and although that document explicitly refers to an alleged meeting of masons in England assembled by Prince Edwin, the son of the tenth-century Saxon king Athelstan, there is no supporting evidence to this claim.

We believe that all believers are called to witness, and we believe that witnessing means telling others what we have seen, not telling them how we think they should be. It's about putting yourself in position to be asked about your faith, maybe years down the road.\n\nWith FaithNames, every email sent witnesses in two ways: though the footer at the bottom of the message and through the matching witnessing website.\n\nThe footer and the matching witnessing website are the reason FaithNames was formed.
