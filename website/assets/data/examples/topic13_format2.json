        "text":"Passing the Winter 1911\n\n\nWaiting For Antarctic \"Spring'\" To Launch Journey\n\nPassing The Winter, 1911\n\nAmundsen and his men passed the winter at Framheim working on necessary tasks and improving their equipment. At night they read books, played cards, or engaged in the ritual of the Saturday night sauna. The dogs roamed free and some even disappeared for a few days, but only a few failed to return. Amundsen assumed they fell into crevasses.\n\nOn August 24, the sun finally appeared above the horizon for the first time since April. This was the day Amundsen had thought to begin the run for the South Pole. He was familiar with how quickly the Arctic warmed up at the beginning of spring.\n\nLike Scott, he didn't adequately comprehend that \"spring\" and \"fall\" do not exist in Antarctica as lengthy periods bounding summer and winter. But with temperatures approaching -72\u00b0F (-58\u00b0C), Amundsen knew the dogs would have a difficult time, and Johansen warned against starting out so soon.\n\nSo day after day he postponed the start, and grew more restless with every lost moment. \"The thought of the English gave him no peace,\" one of the crew later noted. \"For if we were not first at the Pole, we might just as well stay home.\"\n\nAnother remarked, \"I'd give something to know how far Scott is today.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's not out yet, bless you!\" came the answer. \"It's much too cold for his ponies.\"",

        "text":"From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia\n\nRevision as of 06:38, August 29, 2012 by Romartus (talk | contribs)\n\nJump to: navigation, search\nKitten pile\n\nPoorly trained puppys attempt a kpuppy pyramid.\n\n\u201cI'm not saying it was aliens . . .\u201d\n~ The History Channel on Pyramids\n\nAlso known as the Seventh Great Thingamabobber of the World, Pyramids are large structures primarily notable for confusing the piss out of everyone. It is entirely unknown as what their creation, purpose, function, composition, history, total mass, and estimated value at Sotheby's are, although many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many persons have speculated on the topic, all of which boil down to essentially a dozen basic theories.\n\nThe Mystery of the Pyramids\n\nThe pyramids have remained an enigma since the fall of Ancient Egypt, though recent evidence suggests that even the Ancient Egyptians were bamboozled by them. Hieroglyphics have been found inscribed in the Pyramid of Khufu that Professor Jan Assmann has translated as \"Wait, you guys, what the fuck did we build this for again?\" [1] In his 1880 best-seller, \"Large Things We Don't Know What They Are,\" Prof. Assmann said of the buildings \"They're just, like, there, man. Smack dab in the middle of the desert, as if an enormous child with ADHD had dropped it in the middle of his sandbox to go chase after squirrels, forgetting it entirely. I therefore theorize that the pyramids were made by an enormous child with ADHD, who had dropped it in the middle of his sandbox to go chase after squirrels, forgetting it entirely.\" Professor Assmann went on to win the Nobel Prize for his work.\n\n  1. Dr. Heinrich Brugsch, on the other hand, translates it as \"Pharaoh Khufu has sand in his arse.\"\n\n\nThe \"Enormous Outhouse\" Theory\n\n13th century renowned Egyptologist Beno\u00eet de Maillet proposed that the magnificent pyramids were simply gigantic places to go to the loo. He formulated this after an especially long expedition to Egypt in which, in his excitement, de Maillet refused to take any bathroom stops. Upon arriving at the pyramid of Piye, de Maillet immediately dashed off his camel and ran around the pyramid looking for an entrance. Unfortunately, due to having approached the pyramid from the back, and also due to the pyramid being incredibly fucking huge, de Maillet was unable to make it inside before urinating in his trousers. Fortunately, a small antechamber was discovered soon after and repurposed as a lavatory by the whole team, before necessitating being filled in due to the \"god-awful smell.\"\n\nThe F\u00e4lschung theory\n\nHermann F\u00e4lschung claimed in 1889 that the Pyramids were a hiding place. According to his higly controversial study, the Egyptians used to hide behind the Pyramids when the Nazis were coming to get them. However, the egyptians then realized that the Nazis only targeted Jews, so they started using the Pyramids as a hiding place to suddenly pop up wearing white clothes in order to scare tourists. This theory was then proven to be crap.\n\nThe Toux theory\n\nIn 1900, the eminent egyptologist Jean-Jacques Toux pubished his study, in which he stated that the Pyramids are merely piles of construction waste. He argues that the Egyptians used Giza as a landfill site to dump all the stone that was left over when they built their temples and palaces.\n\nHowever, just two days later, Xuot Seuqcaj-Naej, another eminent egyptologist, claimed that the opposite was true: temples and palaces in egypt were built using leftover stone from the pyramids. Either way, both men claim that the egyptians were fond of the 3 \"R\"s of recycling, namely recycle, reuse, and reduce, especially in the recycling of stone, making the egyptians the first, and only environmentally-friendly civilisation in the world.\n\nThe Galenstr\u00f6m theory\n\nPathologist Olof-\u00c5ke Galenstr\u00f6m suggested in 1912 that the Pyramids were built by the Sphinx before it was petrified near them. However, this gives rise to the problem of who build the sphinx in the first place.\n\nThe Hamilton-Udder theory\n\nIn 1920, Sir Edmund Hamilton-Udder declared to have single-handedly built the Pyramids in May 1900. He said this was done during the night so no one could see him. However, this theory was later brought to question after his girlfriend's shocking revelation that they were haing a passionate love affair on that exact night when he was supposed to be building his pyramids.\n\n\nPyramid in Egypt are big, but they are smaller then Pluto, the dwarf planet\n\nThe Gl\u00f6ffensch\u00fctter-Jakobsberger theory\n\nThe German pseudo-scientist Helmut Gl\u00f6ffensch\u00fctter-Jakobsberger published his so-called study The Pyramids: Their Secret Energy Things in 1949, arguing that a superhuman race from outer space had built the Pyramids using their superior mental skills. He argued that the ancient Egyptians just could not have been capable of moving stones from one place to another.\n\nThe Egyptian theory\n\nThe Pyramids were originally thought to be tombs for the Pharaohs of Egypt, but it has recently been disovered that they are merely a practical joke played on future generations by the ancient. the idea seems to be that the dead mummies have a hell of a good laugh watcing us try to figure out why and how these structures were built.\n\nSince the \"Egyptian\" pyramids are currently located in the country of Egypt, some people speculate that they were made on-location, by the native inhabitatants. That's clearly ridiculous. If humans and camels were capable of making pyramids, why are there no photographs? Why haven't they made any in the last millennia of recorded history?\n\nSome Bibllical scholars claim that Jewish slaves built the pyramids. This is even sillier. There is not a single mention of bagels or Roth IRAs in Exodus, so it's obviously made up.\n\nAztec-Mayan-Incan Devolution Theory\n\nThe Aztec-Mayan-Incan peoples origins are clouded in old mysteries claiming that they were visited by Hyperborean sailors who were escaping their own dying worlds and taught the noobs how to build 'Good Pyramids' (square looking ones, as opposed to the hotels they had been thinking of renovating in Las Vegas). Only the Egyptians have been capable of building 'Great Pyramids' (Pyramid shaped looking tall ones with a missing golden apex on top). Since these Oceanic communities were bandied up together by the sweeping Spanish Inquisitional reforms of Cortez the Cabalistic Cow Farmer, who was competing with Columbus for control of the New World Order, the joint-three communities have forgotten how to build even Good Pyramids and nothing has survived into the modern era. All surviving knowledge from this historical time period has devolved and discombobulated.\n\nThe land mine theory\n\nThe pyramids were created by the Wookies as a weapon in their interstellar war against forks. Most of the bombs that rained down on planet earth eventually asploded, when triggered by their fork-proximity sensors. Since the people in Egypt use chopsticks, rather than forks, these bombs still remain.\n\nThe crystal growth theory\n\nThe pyramids are a kind of giant crystal, formed deep in the earth, like the ones found in all mountains. As the softer sandstone wears away, more and more of the harder crystal becomes visible.\n\nThe Superior Wisdom Theory\n\nProposed by Q. Laureate Bandersnatch in 1999, the Superior Wisdom Theory holds that whoever built the pyramids - although Professor Bandersnatch, in his book Superior Wisdom, or Where Kent Hovind Went Wrong, does not suggest who these people were - built them to pay tribute to their \"superior wisdom\" that the Earth was in fact pyramid-shaped, rather than the Flat Earth theory proposed by Joseph Stalin or the equally crazy Round Earth hypothesis advocated by those pesky Greeks. Professor Bandersnatch holds a PhD in Pyramidiocy from the University of the North-West Passage.\n\nThe Commemoration Gift theory\n\nThe mongols builted the Piramids and gifted them to the egiptians to honor their friendship. They carried the Piramids by the Nile (some crocodiles at the end of the interior laberynth of one piramid seem to confirm this). But the egiptians afforded the expensive travel, which eventualy leaded first to a resentment in the taxed people and later to a war between the Egiptian Empire and the Mongols. The Egiptians lost, because of millions of mongol soldiers were hidden inside the Piramids. After the liberation, the egiptians wanted to demolish the oprobius gift, but the colossal antiproject was delayed till the finalization of the big Wall, gifted to China.\n\nThe \"Tourist Attraction\" Theory\n\nRupert Murdoch proposed that the pyramids may have been built as a last-ditch effort to bump up the economy by raising tourism revenue from Greece and Arabia. In that case, it seems to have failed.\n\nThe \"Time Machine\" Theory\n\nPerhaps the pyramids were built in the future. That would explain everything.\n\nThe Scheme Theory\n\nDid you know...\nConstruction costs for these original pyramid schemes are believed to have been funded by Charles Ponzi of Boston, Mass.\n\nBernard Madoff attempted to sell a sheet of papyrus inscribed with the following:\n\nPyramid. A building giving away free wheat for:\n\n  \u2022 Bricks.\n  \u2022 Getting friends and then strangers to create a chain of referrals to boost financial reputation.\n  \u2022 Repeat until found out. Go to jail for 140 years.\n\nThe authenticity of this document has not been verified.\n\n\nIt may never be known why the pyramids were built.\n\n\u201cBut it was totally aliens.\u201d\n~ The History Channel on Pyramids\n\nSee also\n\nPersonal tools",

He arrived in Albanie with great force of men with a great navy. When they of the land knew it, they garnished them against him and defended their lands the best they might; then they sent word to King Arthur that King Madeglant was come in such manner into the land, with great plenty of folk, and that he should come presently to succour them or send them a knight so good as that he might protect them, and that in case he doth not so, the land will be lost. When King Arthur understood these tidings, it was not well with him. He asked his knights whom he might send thither. And they say, let him send Lancelot thither, for that he is a worthy knight and a kingly, and much understandeth of war, and hath in him as much loyalty as hath ever another that they know. The King maketh him come before him.\n\n\n\"Lancelot,\" saith the King, \"Such affiance have I in you and in your knighthood, that it is my will to send you to the furthest corner of my land, to protect it, with the approval of my knights, wherefore I pray and require you that you do your power herein as many a time have you done already in my service. And I will give you in command forty knights.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" saith Lancelot, \"Against your will am I not minded to be, but in your court are there other knights full as good, or better than I, whom you might well send thither. But I would not that you should hold this of cowardize in me, and right willingly will I do your pleasure, for none ought I to serve more willingly than you.\"\n\nThe King giveth him much thanks of this that he saith. Lancelot departeth from the court, and taketh forty knights with him, and so cometh into the land of Albanie where King Madeglant hath arrived. When they of the land knew that Lancelot was come, great joy had they thereof in their hearts, for ofttimes had they heard tell of him and of his good knighthood. They were all at his commandment, and received him as their champion and protector.\n\n\nKing Madeglant one day issued forth of his ships to do battle against Lancelot and them of the land. Lancelot received him right stoutly, and slew many of his folk, and the more part fled and would fain have drawn them to their ships, but Lancelot and his people went after and cut a part of them to pieces. King Madeglant, with as many of his men as he might, betaketh himself to his own ship privily, and maketh put to sea the soonest he may. They that might not come to the ships remained on dry land, and were so cut up and slain. Madeglant went his way discomfited. Of ten ships full of men that he had brought he took back with him but two. The land was in peace and assured in safety. Lancelot remained there of a long space. They of the country loved him much and gave themselves great joy of his valour and his great bounty, insomuch that most of them say ofttimes that they would fain have such a knight as was he for king, by the goodwill of King Arthur, for that the land is too far away; but and if he would set there a knight or other man that might protect the land, they would take it in right good part, and he should hold the land of him, for they might not safeguard it at their will without a champion, for that land without a lord may but little avail. They of the land loved Lancelot well, as I tell you. King Arthur was at Cardoil, and so were his knights together with him. He thought to be assured in his kingdom and to live peaceably; but what time he sate at meat one day in Cardoil, behold you thereupon a knight that cometh before the Table Round without saluting him.\n\n\"Sir,\" saith he, \"Where is Lancelot?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" saith the King to the knight, \"He is not in this country.\"\n\n\"By my head,\" saith the knight, \"that misliketh me. Wheresoever he be, he is your knight and of your household; wherefore King Claudas sendeth you word that he is his mortal enemy, and you also, if so be that for love of him you receive him from this day forward, for he hath slain his sister's son, Meliant of the Waste Manor, and he slew the father of Meliant likewise, but the father belongeth not to King Claudas.\n\n\nMeliant was the son of his sister-german, wherefore much grieveth he of his death.\"\n\n\"Sir knight,\" saith the King, \"I know not how the covenant may be between them as of this that you tell me, but well know I that King Claudas holdeth many a castle that King Claudas ought not of right to have, whereof he disherited his father, but meet is it that each should conquer his own right. But so much I tell you plainly, that never will I fail mine own knight and he be such as durst defend himself of murder, but and if he hath no will to do this, then well may I allow that right be done upon him. But, sith that he will not love his own death, neither I nor other ought greatly to love him and he refuse to redress his wrong. When Lancelot shall know these tidings, I know well that such is his valour and his loyalty that he will readily answer in reason, and will do all that he ought to do to clear himself of such a charge.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" saith the knight, \"You have heard well that I have told you. Once more, I tell you plainly, King Claudas sendeth you word that so you harbour his enemy henceforward and in such manner as you have done heretofore, he will be less than pleased with you.\"\n\n\nWith that the knight departeth, and the King remaineth at Cardoil. He sendeth for Briant of the Isles, his seneschal, and a great part of his knights, and demandeth counsel of them what he may do. Messire Ywain saith that he killed Meliant in the King's service, as one that warred upon his land, albeit the King had done him no wrong, and had so made common cause with the King's enemies without demanding right in his court. Nor never had Meliant appealed Lancelot of murder nor of treason, nor required him of the death of his father. Rather, Lancelot slew him in open war, as one that warred upon his lord by wrong.\n\n\"Sir,\" saith Messire Ywain to the King, \"Howsoever Lancelot might have wrought in respect of Meliant, your land ought not to be called to account, for you were not in the kingdom, nor knew not that either had done other any wrong, and therefore say I that King Claudas will do great wrong and he bring plaint or levy war against you on this account.\"\n\n\"Messire Ywain,\" saith Briant of the Isles, \"matter of common knowledge is it that Lancelot slew the lord of the Waste Manor and Meliant his son after the contention that was betwixt King Arthur and me. But, after that he had slain the father, he ought of right to have taken good heed that he did no wrong to the son, but rather ought he to have sought peace and accord.\"\n\n\n\"Briant,\" saith Messire Gawain, \"Lancelot is nor here; and, moreover, he is now on the King's business. Well know you that Meliant came to you and that you made him knight, and that thereafter he warred upon the King's land without reasonable occasion. The King was far away from the land as he that made pilgrimage to the Graal. He was told tidings that his land was being put to the worse, and he sent Lancelot to protect it. He accordingly maintained the war as best he might until such time as the King was returned. Meliant knew well that the King was come back, and that never had he done wrong to none in his court that wished to demand right therein. He neither came thither nor sent, either to do right or to demand right, whether he did so for despite or whether it was for that he knew not how to do it. In the meanwhile he warred upon the King, that had never done him a wrong nor refused to do him a right. Lancelot slew him in the King's war and upon his land in defence thereof. There was peace of the war, as was agreed on between you and the King, but and if any should therefore hold Lancelot to blame of the death of Meliant, meseemeth that therein is he wrong. For the others are not held to answer for them that they slew; but and if you wish to say that Lancelot hath not slain him with reason, howsoever he may have wrought aforetime in respect of his father, I am ready to maintain his right by my body on behalf of his.\"\n\n\n\"Messire Gawain,\" saith Briant of the Isles, \"You will not as at this time find none that will take up your gage on account of this affair, nor ought any to make enemies of his friends, nor ought you to counsel me so to do. King Madeglant warreth upon him and King Claudas maketh war upon him also. They will deliver attacks enough. But I should well allow, for the sake of saving his land and keeping his friends, that the King should suffer Lancelot to remain at a distance from his court for one year, until tidings should have come to King Claudas that he had been bidden leave thereof, so as that King Arthur might have his good will and his love.\"\n\nSagramors li Desirous leapeth forward. \"Briant of the Isles,\" saith Sagramors, \"Ill befall him that shall give such counsel to a lord or his knight, and the knight have well served his lord, albeit he may have slain in his wars a knight without murder and without treason, that he should give him his leave! Right ill will Lancelot hitherto have bestowed his services, and the King on this account give him his leave! After that, let King Claudas come! Let him lay waste and slay, and right great worship shall King Arthur have thereof! I say not this for that Lancelot hath need be afeared of King Claudas body to body, nor of the best knight in his land, but many things befall whereof one taketh no heed; and so King Arthur give leave to Lancelot from his court, it will be counted unto him for cowardize, and neither I nor you nor other knight ought never more to have affiance in him.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" saith Briant of the Isles, \"Better would it avail the King ...

        "text":"The Butcher And How He Was Cast Into The Vault Of The Curfew Tower\n\nTurning off on the right, the earl and his companion continued to\n\ndescend the hill until they came in sight of the Garter--a snug little\n\nhostel, situated immediately beneath the Curfew Tower.\n\nBefore the porch were grouped the earl's attendants, most of whom\n\nhad dismounted, and were holding their steeds by the bridles. At\n\nthis juncture the door of the hostel opened, and a fat jolly-looking\n\npersonage, with a bald head and bushy grey beard, and clad in a brown\n\nserge doublet, and hose to match, issued forth, bearing a foaming jug of\n\nale and a horn cup. His appearance was welcomed by a joyful shout from\n\nthe attendants.\n\n\"Come, my masters!\" he cried, filling the horn, \"here is a cup of stout\n\nWindsor ale in which to drink the health of our jolly monarch, bluff\n\nKing Hal; and there's no harm, I trust, in calling him so.\"\n\n\"Marry, is there not, mine host;\" cried the foremost attendant. \"I spoke\n\nof him as such in his own hearing not long ago, and he laughed at me\n\nin right merry sort. I love the royal bully, and will drink his health\n\ngladly, and Mistress Anne Boleyn's to boot.\"\n\nAnd he emptied the horn.\n\n\"They tell me Mistress Anne Boleyn is coming to Windsor with the king\n\nand the knights-companions to-morrow--is it so?\" asked the host, again\n\nfilling the horn, and handing it to another attendant.\n\nThe person addressed nodded, but he was too much engrossed by the horn\n\nto speak.\n\n\"Then there will be rare doings in the castle,\" chuckled the host; \"and\n\nmany a lusty pot will be drained at the Garter. Alack-a-day! how times\n\nare changed since I, Bryan Bowntance, first stepped into my father's\n\nshoes, and became host of the Garter. It was in 1501--twenty-eight years\n\nago--when King Henry the Seventh, of blessed memory, ruled the land, and\n\nwhen his elder son, Prince Arthur, was alive likewise. In that year the\n\nyoung prince espoused Catherine of Arragon, our present queen, and soon\n\nafterwards died; whereupon the old king, not liking--for he loved his\n\ntreasure better than his own flesh--to part with her dowry, gave her to\n\nhis second son, Henry, our gracious sovereign, whom God preserve! Folks\n\nsaid then the match wouldn't come to good; and now we find they spoke\n\nthe truth, for it is likely to end in a divorce.\"\n\n\"Not so loud, mine host!\" cried the foremost attendant; \"here comes our\n\nyoung master, the Earl of Surrey.\"\n\n\"Well, I care not,\" replied the host bluffly. \"I've spoken no treason.\n\nI love my king; and if he wishes to have a divorce, I hope his holiness\n\nthe Pope will grant him one, that's all.\"\n\nAs he said this, a loud noise was heard within the hostel, and a man was\n\nsuddenly and so forcibly driven forth, that he almost knocked down Bryan\n\nBowntance, who was rushing in to see what was the matter. The person\n\nthus ejected, who was a powerfully-built young man, in a leathern\n\ndoublet, with his muscular arms bared to the shoulder, turned his rage\n\nupon the host, and seized him by the throat with a grip that threatened\n\nhim with strangulation. Indeed, but for the intervention of the earl's\n\nattendants, who rushed to his assistance, such might have been his fate.\n\nAs soon as he was liberated, Bryan cried in a voice of mingled rage and\n\nsurprise to his assailant, \"Why, what's the matter, Mark Fytton?--are\n\nyou gone mad, or do you mistake me for a sheep or a bullock, that you\n\nattack me in this fashion? My strong ale must have got into your addle\n\npate with a vengeance.\n\n\"The knave has been speaking treason of the king's highness,\" said the\n\ntall man, whose doublet and hose of the finest green cloth, as well as\n\nthe how and quiverful of arrows at his back, proclaimed him an\n\narcher--\"and therefore we turned him out!\"\n\n\"And you did well, Captain Barlow,\" cried the host.\n\n\"Call me rather the Duke of Shoreditch,\" rejoined the tall archer; \"for\n\nsince his majesty conferred the title upon me, though it were but in\n\njest, when I won this silver bugle, I shall ever claim it. I am always\n\ndesignated by my neighbours in Shoreditch as his grace; and I require\n\nthe same attention at your hands. To-morrow I shall have my comrades,\n\nthe Marquises of Clerkenwell, Islington, Hogsden, Pancras, and\n\nPaddington, with me, and then you will see the gallant figure we shall\n\n\n\"I crave your grace's pardon for my want of respect,\" replied the host.\n\n\"I am not ignorant of the distinction conferred upon you at the last\n\nmatch at the castle butts by the king. But to the matter in hand. What\n\ntreason hath Mark Fytton, the butcher, been talking?\"\n\n\"I care not to repeat his words, mine host,\" replied the duke; \"but\n\nhe hath spoken in unbecoming terms of his highness and Mistress Anne\n\n\n\"He means not what he says,\" rejoined the host. \"He is a loyal subject\n\nof the king; but he is apt to get quarrelsome over his cups.\"\n\n\"Well said, honest Bryan,\" cried the duke; \"you have one quality of a\n\ngood landlord--that of a peacemaker. Give the knave a cup of ale, and\n\nlet him wash down his foul words in a health to the king, wishing him a\n\nspeedy divorce and a new queen, and he shall then sit among us again.\"\n\n\"I do not desire to sit with you, you self-dubbed duke,\" rejoined Mark;\n\n\"but if you will doff your fine jerkin, and stand up with me on the\n\ngreen, I will give you cause to remember laying hands on me.\"\n\n\"Well challenged, bold butcher!\" cried one of Surrey's attendants. \"You\n\nshall be made a duke yourself.\"\n\n\"Or a cardinal,\" cried Mark. \"I should not be the first of my brethren\n\nwho has met with such preferment.\"\n\n\"He derides the Church in the person of Cardinal Wolsey!\" cried the\n\nduke. \"He is a blasphemer as well as traitor.\"\n\n\"Drink the king's health in a full cup, Mark,\" interposed the host,\n\nanxious to set matters aright, \"and keep your mischievous tongue between\n\nyour teeth.\"\n\n\"Beshrew me if I drink the king's health, or that of his minion, Anne\n\nBoleyn!\" cried Mark boldly. \"But I will tell you what I will drink.\n\nI will drink the health of King Henry's lawful consort, Catherine\n\nof Arragon; and I will add to it a wish that the Pope may forge her\n\nmarriage chains to her royal husband faster than ever.\"\n\n\"A foolish wish,\" cried Bryan. \"Why, Mark, you are clean crazed!\"\n\n\"It is the king who is crazed, not me!\" cried Mark. \"He would sacrifice\n\nhis rightful consort to his unlawful passion; and you, base hirelings,\n\nsupport the tyrant in his wrongful conduct!\"\n\n\"Saints protect us!\" exclaimed Bryan. \"Why, this is flat treason. Mark,\n\nI can no longer uphold you.\"\n\n\"Not if you do not desire to share his prison, mine host,\" cried the\n\nDuke of Shoreditch. \"You have all heard him call the king a tyrant.\n\nSeize him, my masters!\"\n\n\"Let them lay hands upon me if they dare!\" cried the butcher resolutely.\n\n\"I have felled an ox with a blow of my fist before this, and I promise\n\nyou I will show them no better treatment.\"\n\nAwed by Mark's determined manner, the bystanders kept aloof.\n\n\"I command you, in the king's name, to seize him!\" roared Shoreditch.\n\n\"If he offers resistance he will assuredly be hanged.\"\n\n\"No one shall touch me!\" cried Mark fiercely.\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said the foremost of the Earl of Surrey's\n\nattendants. \"Yield, fellow!\"\n\n\"Never!\" replied Mark; \"and I warn you to keep off.\"\n\nThe attendant, however, advanced; but before he could lay hands on the\n\nbutcher he received a blow from his ox-like fist that sent him reeling\n\nbackwards for several paces, and finally stretched him at full length\n\nupon the ground. His companions drew their swords, and would have\n\ninstantly fallen upon the sturdy offender, if Morgan Fenwolf, who, with\n\nthe Earl of Surrey, was standing among the spectators, had not rushed\n\nforward, and, closing with Mark before the latter could strike a blow,\n\ngrappled with him, and held him fast till he was secured, and his arms\n\ntied behind him.\n\n\"And so it is you, Morgan Fenwolf, who have served me this ill turn,\n\neh?\" cried the butcher, regarding him fiercely. \"I now believe all I\n\nhave heard of you.\"\n\n\"What have you heard of him?\" asked Surrey, advancing.\n\n\"That he has dealings with the fiend--with Herne the Hunter,\" replied\n\nMark. \"If I am hanged for a traitor, he ought to be burnt for a wizard.\"\n\n\"Heed not what the villain says, my good fellow,\" said the Duke of\n\nShoreditch; \"you have captured him bravely, and I will take care your\n\nconduct is duly reported to his majesty. To the castle with him! To\n\nthe castle! He will lodge to-night in the deepest dungeon of yon\n\nfortification,\" pointing to the Curfew Tower above them, \"there to await\n\nthe king's judgment; and to-morrow night it will be well for him if he\n\nis not swinging from the gibbet near the bridge. Bring him along.\"\n\nAnd followed by Morgan Fenwolf and the others, with the prisoner, he\n\nstrode up the hill.\n\nLong before this Captain Bouchier had issued from the hostel and joined\n\nthe earl, and they walked together after the crowd. In a few minutes the\n\nDuke of Shoreditch reached Henry the Eighth's Gate, where he shouted to\n\na sentinel, and told him what had occurred. After some delay a wicket in\n\nthe gate was opened, and the chief persons of the party were allowed to\n\npass through it with the prisoner, who was assigned to the custody of a\n\ncouple of arquebusiers.\n\nBy this time an officer had arrived, and it was agreed, at the\n\nsuggestion of the Duke of Shoreditch, to take the offender to the Curfew\n\nTower. Accordingly they crossed the lower ward, and passing beneath an\n\narchway near the semicircular range of habitations allotted to the\n\npetty canons, traversed the space before the west end of Saint George's\n\nChapel, and descending a short flight of stone steps at the left, and\n\nthreading a narrow passage, presently arrived at the arched entrance in\n\nthe Curfew, whose hoary walls shone brightly in the moonlight.\n\nThey had to knock for some time against the stout oak door before any\n\nnotice was taken of the summons. At length an old man, who acted as\n\nbellringer, thrust his head out of one ... (truncated)",

        "text":"In the 1930's the Palazon family, residing in an apartment complex on the \"Gascon Gotor\" street, encountered a frightening ordeal when they started to hear maniacal laughter and voice coming from inside their home.\n\nThe poltergeist phenomenon quickly turned its attention to the young maid, Pascuala Alcocer. She had reported that the voice was tormenting her and that it came from the wood stove.\n\nThe Zaragoza Poltergeist\n\nAs the news of this poltergeist spread, thousands, of people started to visit the building. The spectators all came interested in hearing the so-called \"duende of Zaragoza\". The word spread so fast and so wildly that the London Times had made a report on the case. Taking it upon themselves to \"put an end to the circus\", local police and judges personally investigated the home and brought with them a few psychiatrists to analyze Pascuala Alcocer, informally putting the blame on her from the beginning.\n\nWhile investigating, the officials found more and more evidence to prove that this was not a hoax. The entity was reported to not only speak, but also to be able to see what was going on around the home. It would accurately state the number of people that were in a room at a time.\n\nWith no real answers to the strange events, the judges, police and psychiatrists assumed that Pascuala was using ventriloquism to create this hoax. They were in extreme pressure to come up with a solution to this hysteria, blaming the girl was the best way they could think of quieting the situation.\n\nAll the tenants in the building were evacuated, and the whole block was quarantined and Pascuala was removed from the premise. An architect was called to examine the whole building, corner to corner. Even the army was called in to investigate the case; all communications (radio\/telephone) were cut from the outside. The maniacal voice continued emanating from the wood stove, but now with a different attitude. It started yelling and insulting everyone in the room, telling them that it would kill them all!\n\nWhen the architect called a skilled mason in order to take some measurements of the kitchen, something else happened. The voice showed them it had knowledge of the building. While the man was measuring a certain part of the kitchen the voice said: \"Don't worry, it measures 75 centimetres.\" Of course when he measured, it was exactly 75 centimeters. The mason was so scared he left the building never to come back leaving his tools behind.\n\nArturo Grijalba was only a kid when the entity spoke to him. He was the building owner's son and the only remaining witness alive to this case. While the investigation was taking place, he had wondered into the kitchen to take a look at the kitchen for himself. When Arturo turned to his dad and said: \"Let's go dad, this thing is crazy\" a voice replied: \"Not crazy little one.\" in a guttural response everyone in the room heard it and were visibly shaken.\n\nAfter two months of insults and threats, the maniacal voice suddenly stopped. Like in all poltergeist cases, it manifested quickly and without warning and vanished the same way.\n\nPascuala was stigmatized with being the hoaxer, the police blamed the girl and her ability to \"throw her voice\", even though skeptics had retorted with the argument that Pascuala was not even near the neighborhood when these voices occurred during some of the investigations, the police and judges closed the case blaming Pascuala.\n\nShe lived a very reclusive life after this whole ordeal had ended. Never fully recovering from the blame what was put on her, she refused to socialize with the people of the city. In old age, she gave an interview about this incident. When asked where the voice was coming from, Pascuala answered: \"From the wall.\"\n\nToday, the building no longer stands it was demolished and in its place, stands a modern building with many residents, none of these have reported any strange occurrences.\n\nmade with love from\n\nHaunted Loctions Map\n\nmade with love from",

Jarvis' marvellous stories\u2014Police adapt themselves to new conditions\u2014Find our cache on the Red Deer.\n\nI had been told by the party who brought me the summons, as also in letters from the North, that this Chairman was going to put a stop to all trading and bartering on the part of missionaries, and I was therefore much surprised to find a postscript at the bottom of the summons, asking me to bring in to him \"a couple of good buffaloes.\" I smiled as I thought of the inconsistency of the thing, right here apparent; but what of the larger inconsistency of the thought held by many, that the missionary had no right to barter or trade with the people to whom he is sent. Here we were, without any currency other than that of kind, no banks or mint, a horse, a dog, a gun, a blanket, a fathom of cloth or print, a shirt or a coat or a cap, and on the other hand, a robe, or dressed leather, or fresh or dried provisions, or furs of any kind; these were the only currency of the times, and how in the name of common sense could one do without bartering. No; there must always be adaptation to conditions, as these are found; and there can be no general law but that of equity and right dealing, and, by the grace of God, there we stood, and would stand, notwithstanding anybody's opinion or ruling. My brother was going in, and also the Hudson's Bay Company was sending in a couple of men; so we made ready and started just before Christmas for the winter journey to the northern fort and little settlement on the bank of the North Saskatchewan. We found the snow deep and almost intact, and we were continuously braking the trail; but as there were four of us taking this in turn we made pretty good speed. We were using horse toboggans, long, flat, two-board sleighs.\n\nWe travelled all Christmas Day, but coming to the Peace Hills, where the town of Wetuskewin now stands, late Saturday evening, we went into camp and prepared to spend the Sabbath at this point. There was an abundance of dry wood, and we worked late gathering an immense pile of this, and made a good comfortable open camp, and then settled down to rest, even as the Lord had, in His infinite mercy and wisdom, ordained.\n\nSunday evening David brought out from his sled a munificent supper and made a special spread, and I asked him the reason of all this. He reminded me that this was the 27th of December, and my birthday, and that my good sister-in-law had thus made ready and commissioned him to bring out this supper and give us the feast if possible. I was delighted and grateful for this kind thoughtfulness, and we, as a little company, in the profound solitude of the time, most thoroughly took pleasure in this genuine surprise birthday feast. I had, in the strenuousness of my life for many years, hardly ever thought of these things. The Sabbath was the only day we aimed at observing.\n\nAt Edmonton we found things much the same. The Mounted Police had come with the winter, and were quartered in the Hudson's Bay Fort. Col. Jarvis was in command. Capt. G-uion was his second. Sergeant-Major Steele (now Col. Steele of Strathcona Horse fame) and the rank and file did the work. A few strange faces were to be seen outside of the police. The new Chairman pro tern. was on the ground, having taken seventy-three days to come from Winnipeg to Edmonton. No wonder the Rev. Lewis Warner found the great North-West interminable.\n\nWe held our district meeting, and by my handing in the two buffaloes at the opportune time we avoided the lecture on trade and barter which had been in preparation for us. From letters I met at Edmonton, I found I was authorized to engage a teacher for my mission, and at once I began to look around for a suitable person. A Dr. Very, who had recently come into the country, being recommended to me, I engaged him to return with us to the mountains. The Hudson Bay Company's men who had come north with us had loaded imp and started back almost immediately. For the first fifty miles of our journey we had the company of Col, Jarvis. He had sent on Sergt.-Major Steele and some nine or ten men, and proposed to travel with us until we caught up to his party. Their objective point was Buffalo Lake, where a large camp of mixed-bloods and Indians were wintering, and where it was reported that whiskey was plenty. It was a keen, cold winter's night, 'and we were in the open camp under the lee of some willows, and the Colonel gave us a graphic account of the trip from the Red River to Edmonton. The expedition of Sir Charles Napier into Abyssinia, which had become quite historic, was not in it with this most formidable journey which the Colonel gave us a very fiery description of. It was gross blasphemy which spoiled the whole business, and I felt I must take the wind out of his sails and let him down easy in so doing, for he was our guest for the time.\n\nAfter he had cursed the Canadian and British governments and the whole North-West country, the rivers especially, and wound up expecting us to applaud such wonderful heroism, I said to him, \"Colonel, nine or ten miles north of Edmonton there dwells, when at home, a French half-breed who, when the spring comes, will load his carts with his winter's trade and catch of furs and pemmican, and, with his wife and children, will take the trail you came by, crossing all the streams you crossed. In due time he will reach Fort Garry; then he will sell his furs and robes, and purchase his fresh supply of goods and articles of trade, load these on to his carts, turn his face westward, re- cross all the streams, now at their highest, reach his home north of Edmonton, put up several stacks of hay, fix up his winter quarters, mend his carts and harness, and having carefully stored his goods, he and his family, with the same horses and carts, will cross the Saskatchewan and travel out from two to three hundred miles on to the plains, make a big turn through the country, run buffalo, stand on guard day and night, make many bales of meat, make many bags of pemmican, and finally, being now well loaded, return over the long journey to their home north of Edmonton. And still, it is not yet winter; and thus this native has travelled about three times the distance you and your party did, Colonel; and they had no government behind them, and what they have done is a common occurrence in this Western country.\"\n\nIt is needless to say that the Colonel saw the point, and we heard no more about the greatness of the feat of crossing the plain' on an old trail in a summer's time.\n\nThat was a cold night in the lee of a big snow- bank and some willows it had caught on to, sparkling stars gemming the firmament, the great disc surcharged with frost-laden ozone from 30 to 40 below. To the Colonel, from the comfortable home and barracks of Eastern Canada, and my doctor teacher from London, England, and the ship's cabin, such a capacious, marvellous, sleepy, living- room as we were now in was a new experience. However, we had the huge campfire, and if we worked hard we could keep this up with a sparkling, laughing flame, which, for a few feet around, tempered the climate of our huge refrigerator. We sang a hymn, and knelt in prayer, and if the act of worship did not do any more, at least it hushed the blasphemous soldier, and it also thawed our backs for the little while we turned them to the big fire as we knelt in prayer.\n\nUp and on before daylight, and in course of a few miles we came up to the police outfit, some of whom, like their commanding officer, had now spent their first night in strong winter weather in the open. This was splendid discipline for these men, with the work they had come into the North-West to perform. Let but the native and the mixed-blood or lawless white man know that this force was always ready, through storm and cold and distance, then the law would be observed, and right there and then we would continue to lay the foundation of a peace-loving and law-abiding citizenhood.\n\nI was glad to see these Easterners show as much adaptability as they did. Many a hard knock did they receive. To be battling with the elements on unbeaten trails and under beclouded skies is the hardest kind of work, and the man capable of strong development would stay and learn in such a field as was now opening before these men.\n\nSoon our trails diverged, they to follow the sometime beaten roads to Buffalo Lake, and we to break a fresh one for ourselves, as already the tracks of our Hudson's Bay men were obliterated, except here and there where there was a bit of bush. We found the snow deep and drifts hard for our horses to break through, and our progress was slow, very slow; and yet we soon caught up to the Hudson's Bay men and passed them. I was ahead all the time, tramping a trail with my snowshoes, and keeping the most direct course. Our teacher doctor was in misery. He never dreamed of such horrible conditions. He seemed to take on melancholy, and we were afraid to let him out of our sight for fear of suicide. To make matters worse, provisions began to run short.\n\nWe had made a cache on the south side of the Red Deer. Last winter's experience had taught us a degree of caution, but still there were long miles between us and the cache, and the cold was steady, and the whole country from Edmonton to where Innisfail now is situated was as if there was no life in it. Tramp, tramp, and, struggle, and not only the doctor to watch, but now his horse was also playing out, and we had both man and horse to coddle and chirp up, and our rations growing smaller all the time. David and myself would sing and joke and try and laugh off the hardship, but the doctor was solemn and sour and ready to give up. As to our cache across the Red Deer, we had purposely never said anyt... (truncated)",

And no one came into the plain unnoticed by L\u00e1eg and yet he used to win every second game of b\u00faanbach from C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018A single warrior comes towards us, little C\u00fa\u2019 said L\u00e1eg. \u2018What manner of warrior is he?\u2019 asked C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018It seems to me that the chariot of the warrior is as big as one of the greatest mountains on a vast plain. It seems to me that the curly, thick, fair- yellow, golden hair hanging loose around his head is as great as the foliage of one of the tall trees which stand on the green before a great fort. He wears a purple, fringed mantle wrapped around him with a golden, inlaid brooch in it. A broad, grey spear flashing in his hand. A bossed, scalloped shield over him with a boos of red gold. A long sword, as long as a ship's rudder\n\n\"A long ... rudder, following LU and ST\n\n, firmly fixed and resting on the two thighs of the great, proud warrior who is within the chariot\u2019. \u2018Welcome is the arrival to us of this guest\u2019 said C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018We know that man. It is my master Fergus who comes\u2019. \u2018I see another chariot-warrior coming towards us also. With much skill and beauty and splendour do his horses advance\u2019. \u2018That is one of the youths of the men of Ireland, friend L\u00e1eg\u2019 said C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018To see my form and appearance that man comes, for I am renowned among them within their encampment\u2019. Fergus arrived and sprang from the chariot, and C\u00fa Chulainn bade him welcome. \u2018I trust that welcome\u2019 said Fergus. \u2018You may well trust, it\u2019 said C\u00fa Chulainn, \u2018for if a flock of birds pass over the plain, you shall have one wild goose and the half of another. If fish swim into the estuaries, you shall have a salmon with the half of another. You shall have a handful of watercress and a handful of sea-weed and a handful of water parsnip. If you must fight or do battle I shall go to the ford on your behalf and you shall be watched over and guarded while you sleep and rest\u2019. \u2018Well indeed, we know what provisions for hospitality you have now on the Foray of C\u00faailnge. But the condition that you asked of the men of Ireland, namely, single combat, you shall have it. I came to bind you to that, so undertake to fulfil it\u2019. \u2018I agree indeed, master Fergus\u2019\n\n\n{line 1605-1637} said C\u00fa Chulainn. And he delayed no longer than that conversing lest the men of Ireland should say that Fergus was betraying them to his fosterling. His two horses were harnessed for Fergus and his chariot was yoked, and he went back.\n\nEtarcumul remained behind him gazing at C\u00fa Chulainn for a long while. \u2018What are you staring at, lad?\u2019 said C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018I am staring at you\u2019 said Etarcumul. \u2018You have not far to look indeed\u2019 said C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018You redden your eye with that. But if only you knew it, the little creature you are looking at, namely, myself, is wrathful. And how do you find me as you look at me?\u2019 \u2018I think you are fine indeed. You are a comely, splendid, handsome youth with brilliant, numerous, various feats of arms. But as for reckoning you among goodly heroes or warriors or champions or sledge-hammers of smiting, we do not do so nor count you at all\u2019. \u2018You know that it is a guarantee for you that you came out of the camp under the protection of my master, Fergus. But I swear by the gods whom I worship that but for Fergus's protection, only your shattered bones and your cloven joints would return to the camp\u2019. \u2018Nay, do not threaten me any longer thus, for as for the condition you asked of the men of Ireland, namely, single combat, none other of the men of Ireland than I shall come to attack you tomorrow\u2019. \u2018Come on, then, and however early you come, you will find me here. I shall not flee from you\u2019. Etarcumul went back and began to converse with his charioteer. \u2018I must needs fight with C\u00fa Chulainn tomorrow, driver\u2019 said Etarcumul. \u2018You have promised it indeed\u2019 said the charioteer, \u2018but I know not if you will fulfil your promise\u2019. \u2018Which is better, to do so tomorrow or at once tonight?\u2019 \u2018It is my conviction\u2019 said the driver, \u2018that though doing it tomorrow means no victory, yet still less is to be gained by doing it tonight, for the fight is nearer\n\n\"for destruction is nearer tonight\", ST\n\n\u2019. \u2018Turn the chariot back again for me, driver, for I swear by the gods whom I worship never to retreat until I carry off as a trophy the head of yon little deer, C\u00fa Chulainn\u2019.\n\nThe charioteer turned the chariot again towards the ford. They turned the left board of the chariot towards the company as they made for the ford. L\u00e1eg noticed that. \u2018The last chariot- fighter who was here a while ago, little C\u00fa\u2019 said L\u00e1eg. \u2018What of him?\u2019 said C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018He turned his left board towards us as he made for the ford\u2019. \u2018That is Etarcumul, driver, seeking combat of me. And I did not welcome him because of the guarantee of\n\n\n{line 1638-1671} my fosterfather under which he came out of the camp, and not because I wish to protect him. Bring my weapon to the ford for me, driver. I do not deem it honourable that he should reach the ford before me\u2019. Then C\u00fa Chulainn went to the ford and unsheathed his sword over his fair shoulder and was ready to meet Etarcumul at the for. Etarcumul arrived also. \u2018What are you seeking, lad?\u2019 asked C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018I seek combat with you\u2019 said Etarcumul. \u2018If you would take my advice, you would not come at all\u2019 said C\u00fa Chulainn. \u2018I say so because of the guarantee of Fergus under which you came out of the encampment and not at all because I wish to protect you\u2019. Then C\u00fa Chulainn gave a flow (fotalbeim) and cut away the sod from beneath the sole of his foot so that he was cast prostrate with the sod on his belly. If C\u00fa Chulainn had so wished, he could have cut him in two. \u2018Begone now for I have given you warning\u2019. \u2018I shall not go until we meet again\u2019. said Etarcumul. C\u00fa Chulainn gave him an edge-blow (f\u00e1ebarbeim). He sheared his hair from him, from poll to forehead and from ear to ear as if it had been shaved with a keen, light razor. He drew not a drop of blood. \u2018Begone now\u2019. said C\u00fa Chulainn, \u2018for I have drawn ridicule on you\u2019. \u2018I shall not go until we meet again, until I carry off your head and spoils and triumph over you or until you carry off my head and spoils and triumph over me\u2019. \u2018The last thing you say is what will happen, and I shall carry off your head and spoils and I shall triumph over you\u2019. C\u00fa Chulainn dealt him a blow (m\u00faadalbeim) on the crown of his head which split him to his navel. He gave him a second blow crosswise so that the three sections into which his body was cut fell at one and the same time to the ground. Thus perished Etarcumul, son of Fid and Leithrinn.\n\nFergus did not know that this fight had taken place. That was but natural, for sitting and rising, journeying or marching, in battle or fight or combat, Fergus never looked behind him lest anyone should say that it was out of fearfulness he looked back, but he was wont to gaze at what was before him and on a level with him. Etarcumul's charioteer came abreast of Fergus. \u2018Where is your master, driver?\u2019 asked Fergus. \u2018He fell on the ford just now by the hand of C\u00fa Chulainn\u2019 said the driver. \u2018It was not right\u2019 said Fergus, \u2018for that distorted sprite C\u00falainn to outrage me concerning him who came there under my protection. Turn the chariot for us, driver\u2019 said Fergus, \u2018that we may go and speak with C\u00fa Chulainn\u2019.\n\n\n{line 1672-1707}\n\nThen the charioteer turned the chariot. They went off towards the ford. \u2018Why did you violate my pledge, you distorted sprite\u2019 said Fergus, \u2018concerning him who came under my safeguard and protection?\u2019 \u2018By the nurture and care you gave me, tell me which you would prefer, that he should triumph over me or that I should triumph over him. Moreover enquire of his driver which of us was at fault against each other\u2019. \u2018I prefer what you have done. A blessing on the hand that struck him!\u2019\n\nThen two withes were tied round Etarcumul's ankles and he was dragged along behind his horses and his chariot. At every rough rock he met, his lungs and liver were left behind on the stones and rocks (?). Wherever it was smooth for him, his scattered joints came together around the horses. Thus he was dragged across the camp to the door of the tent of Ailill and Medb. \u2018Here is your youth for you\u2019 said Fergus, \u2018for every restoration has its fitting restitution\u2019. Medb came out to the door of her tent and raised her voice aloud. \u2018We thought indeed\u2019 said Medb, \u2018that great was the ardour and wrath of this young hound when he went forth from the camp in the morning. We thought that the guarantee under which he went, the guarantee of Fergus was not that of a coward\u2019. \u2018What has crazed the peasant-woman?\u2019 said Fergus. \u2018Is it right for the common cur to seek out the bloodhound whom the warriors of the four great provinces of Ireland dare not approach or withstand? Even I myself would be glad to escape whole from him\u2019. Thus fell Etarcumul.\n\nThat is the story of the Encounter of Etarcumul and C\u00fa Chulainn.",
