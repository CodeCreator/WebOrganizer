By Liam Bastick, director with SumProduct Pty Ltd.\n\n\nA data file has been created with two columns, dates and data, viz.\n\nDates Challenge\n\nIs there a simple formula to put in cell G12 (yellow cell) which will return the most recent date at which the corresponding data was less than or equal to the value in the \u2018Target\u2019 cell (cell G14)?\n\nIt can be assumed that there will be at most one data point for each date, but the dates may not necessarily be in ascending order. \u00a0The ideal formula should take into account what happens if no date meets the criterion.\n\n\nTo be a successful solution, the formula had to allow for dates out of order and provide a meaningful output (i.e. not \u201c0\u201d) if there was no solution.\n\nIgnoring the error trap requirement, possible solutions include:\n\n  \u2022 An array function, e.g. ={MAX(IF($G$18:$G$40<=$G$14,$F$18:$F$40))}\n  \u2022 Database functions by building a \u201ccriteria table\u201d (sic) and using =DMAX(database,field,criteria) (I plan to explain DFunctions in March\u2019s column)\n  \u2022 SUMPRODUCT, e.g. =SUMPRODUCT(MAX($F$18:$F$40*($G$18:$G$40<=$G$14)))\n  \u2022 INDEX, e.g. =MAX(INDEX((F18:F40)*(G18:G40<=G14),))\n  \u2022 Including an extra column to identify dates that met the criteria, then finding the most recent date using the MAX() function.\n\nTypical solutions are provided in the attached Excel file.\n\nCommon mistakes included using the LOOKUP() function (this requires the dates to be in strict ascending order), getting the inequality the wrong way round and forgetting the error trap.\n\nIn summary, to solve this problem, you needed to find the most recent (biggest) date out of a list of dates that met a particular condition: one viable option is to consider an array.\n\n\nIn Excel, an array is a contiguous set of items in a single row (called a one-dimensional horizontal array or \u201cvector\u201d), or in a single column (a one-dimensional vertical vector), or in a table consisting of at least two rows and two columns (a two-dimensional array). \u00a0If you need more dimensions, you are better served with relational databases such as MS Access.\n\nArray formulae perform multiple calculations on one or more of the items in an array. \u00a0Array formulae can return either multiple outputs or a single result. \u00a0There are two types:\n\n  \u2022 Formulae that work with an array or series of data and aggregate it, typically using SUM(), AVERAGE(), MIN(), MAX() or COUNT(), to return a single value to a single cell. \u00a0Microsoft calls these single cell array formulae\n  \u2022 Formulae that return a result in to two or more cells (there are various formulae that will do this including MINVERSE(), LINEST() and TRANSPOSE()). These types of array formulas return an array of values as their result and are referred to as multi-cell array formulae.\n\nSome functions, such as SUMPRODUCT(), INDEX() and OFFSET() will allow you to work with an array in a single cell by just pressing ENTER. \u00a0However, Excel often needs to know you are working with an array formula, and this is performed by entering the formula using CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER. \u00a0This will result in the formula appearing in braces ({}). \u00a0These braces cannot be typed in.\n\nArray formulae allow you to perform tasks that would require multiple cells otherwise (hence some readers used an additional column).\n\nOur problem requires working with a list to return a single value, i.e. using a single cell array formula on a column vector.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the most common right answer (excluding the error trap):\n\n\nThe central formula, IF($G$18:$G$40<=$G$14,$F$18:$F$40), checks to see which data is less than or equal to the target value ($G$14) and returns the corresponding dates (otherwise it provides a default value of FALSE since the value_if_false in the IF(logical_test,[value_if_true],[value_if_false]) syntax is not defined).\n\nHence we get an array in the form {Date_1,FALSE,FALSE,Date_2,\u2026}. MAX() simply takes the largest value, i.e. the most recent date \u2013 easy!\n\nProblems with Arrays\n\nMulti-cell formulae can cause problems as the range of cells to hold your results must be selected before you enter the formula. \u00a0Once entered, the contents of an individual cell in a multi-cell array formula cannot be edited and \/ or deleted.\n\nEnd users may not understand your array formulae. \u00a0How many basic Excel users would understand the MAX(IF) array explained above? \u00a0Advanced users will all too often use an array function when there are simpler, easier to understand alternatives.\n\nLarge array formulae can slow down calculations significantly. \u00a0Worse still, they can simply stop calculating with no error message provided.\n\nIn conclusion, array formulae can be very powerful but they should be used sparingly.\n\nIf you have a query for this section, please feel free to drop Liam a line at or visit the website",

        "text":"Tecno H6 Latest Firmware Version With 5GB Free Internal Storage For Use\n\n\nTo all\u00a0Tecno H6\u00a0users, this post was specifically made for you guys. I assume we all know that Tecno H6 is of two versions or type, the old version with build number\u00a0H6-G325-20140923 \u00a0but has 2GB allocated free space for use and also the new version with build number\u00a0H6-G325-20150122S\u00a0 which comes with 5GB free space for use, yes you read me well, 5GB free storage for user use. Anyway, I can say I\u2019m so dissapointed at Tecno for not making the new H6 version with 5gb free space to be an OTA update or upgrade for the users of old version to just update or upgrade it using their device or flash via sp flashtools. Instead they decided to make a new H6 version with 5gb free space & selling it in the market, thereby leaving the users of old version with 2gb free space in darknes.\n\nAnyway, back to the main point of this post, to the users of old version of H6, I have come up with a reliable & trusted way to help you guys switch from the old version firmware to the new version firmware so as to enjoy 5gb free internal space for usage & other changes instead of 2gb.

        "text":"Advice That Will Surely Help You In Affiliate Marketing\n\nSome people say that the internet has taken the entertainment industry\u2019s place, as one of the only recession-proof venues in existence. If that\u2019s true at all, then it\u2019s only true because of the billions of product choices that you can find online. As an affiliate marketer, you have free reign to choose which products you want to sell. Use this information to help you make the best decision.\n\nOne thing to beware of with affiliate marketing programs is alienating your customers. Make sure that the products and services offered by your affiliates are ethical and offer good value for customers\u2019 money. Nothing will poison the opinion of a visitor to your website faster than directing him or her to a scam. Conversely, helping a visitor find a product he or she is interested in can make them appreciate your site.\n\nPick a layout for your site that matches the image you want to portray. You want to make sure the style of your site matches the items that are on it. You don\u2019t want to throw viewers off by having a site that looks nothing related to the types of products that are available on it.\n\nBe honest to your readers and disclose your affiliations. Readers know an affiliate ad when they see one, and they will appreciate your honesty. It\u2019ll make them feel better about supporting you by using your referral link. Furthermore, honesty is important in generating a loyal reader base that will continue to generate money in the future.\n\nWhen selecting an affiliate marketing program, make sure to consider the needs of your site\u2019s audience. You want to select a product that is relevant to your readers, otherwise it will make you appear like a con artist that is just after their money. Focus on your niche market and recommend only products and services that are relevant to them, and they will be more likely to follow links and buy.\n\nIf you find the website of the product owners not very well done, you can easily find affiliate link cloaker tools. These programs allow you to link any page from the company\u2019s website. Link your audience directly to the page where they can buy the product if your own website provides enough content.\n\nTo increase the success of your affiliate marketing, discover the type of tracking software a company uses before you join their affiliate program. If the program does not track all of your sales, then you will not receive credit for all of the viewers that you refer to their company.\n\nIf your website is sports-related, you already know what your visitors are going to be interested in. Keep your affiliate links sports related, otherwise they probably won\u2019t click on it. You are most likely to get visitors from that link if it is directly related to your website.\n\nBeing an affiliate is all about the product, as we alluded to in the opening of this article. However, it\u2019s also about following the other steps listed here, in order to achieve your ultimate goal. You will never stop learning about marketing as a whole, nor should you. You should follow helpful advice anywhere you can get it. Start with this article and continue to be a student of the genre.",

        "text":"How to Eat Radish Pods\n\n\nMost radishes are grown for their edible roots, which may be mild or pungent and are eaten raw or cooked in a variety of cuisines. The seed pods of radishes are also edible, and one family of radishes - Raphanas caudatus, often called \"rat-tailed radishes\" - is grown especially for its seed pods. These are a fascinating garden plant, and enjoyed a notable vogue during the 19th century. They have a pungent radish flavor when eaten raw or lightly cooked, and grow milder the longer they are cooked.\n\nThings You'll Need\n\n  \u2022 Radish pods\n  \u2022 Colander\n  \u2022 Paper towel\n  \u2022 Steamer\n  \u2022 Pot\n  \u2022 Wok\n  \u2022 Rinse the radish pods under cold running water in a colander. Allow the pods to drain for five minutes, and pat them dry with a paper towel. Pinch off the stem ends, if woody.\n\n  \u2022 Add the radish pods raw to salads or plates of fresh vegetables for dipping. They have a fresh, pungent radish flavor with a distinct heat, but with more complexity than a conventional radish. They make an excellent foil for strongly flavored greens and vinaigrettes, and also complement strong cheeses such as feta or goat.\n\n  \u2022 Steam the pods lightly as a side dish, or boll them in a pot of salted water. Steamed pods will retain more pungent radish heat than boiled pods, but both will mellow as they are cooked longer. Serve warm with butter or cold with olive oil and lemon or a light vinaigrette.\n\n  \u2022 Stir-fry the pods on their own as a side dish, or add them to your favorite Asian stir-fry or pad Thai. The pods retain much of their pungency when lightly cooked, making them an alternative to mild chilies in many dishes.\n\nTips & Warnings\n\n  \u2022 Pick the seed pods as soon as they fill out, but before they become dry and leathery. The seeds may be shucked from mature pods and eaten separately. The mature seeds are very strong, and should be boiled or steamed to moderate their flavor. They may be added to a dish of boiled or steamed peas for an interesting flavor combination.\n\nRelated Searches\n\n\n  \u2022 Photo Credit Jupiterimages\/Creatas\/Getty Images\nPromoted By Zergnet\n\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n  \u2022 How to Cook with Radishes\n\n    Radishes are rich in vitamin C and minerals, nearly calorie-free and serve as a great antioxidant.

        "text":"Driver Verifier Manager & Device Manager: Troubleshoot Driver Problems in Windows\n\nIf your Windows freezes frequently or is encountering frequent Stop Errors or BSOD\u2019s then, it is advisable to check if the problem is being caused by a faulty Driver. While in most cases, its usually the unsigned drivers which create problems, one cannot rule out the signed drivers too! Nevertheless, you can troubleshoot, identify & resolve common device driver problems with the help of the built-in Driver Verifier Manager & Device Manager.\n\nDriver Verifier Manager\n\nWindows has, what is called as, Driver Verifier Manager. Its a very useful tool to identify problematic drivers. To open it type verifier in charms bar \/ start menu search box and hit enter. The Driver Verifier Manager, tests each specified driver at startup. If it detects a problem, it identifies it and then stops it from running.\n\nDriver Verifier manager\n\nTo use the\u00a0Driver Verifier Manager, first select Create Standard Settings > Click Next > Automatically select unsigned drivers > Next. You will see a dialog box \u2018Loading driver information\u2019 at the end of which you will be presented with a list of unsigned drivers.\n\nThere are other options, too, to select at every step. Choose what you think would be most appropriate in your case. I have only mentioned unsigned drivers as they are usually suspect. This way Standard Settings will first be created.

        "text":"Usually the pocket square needs very little attending to. But just like everything else, your Creative Corgis pocket square might need some tender love and care from time to time.\n\nFor a quick and effective refreshing, steam it and let it cool on a flat surface. You can also iron it with the lowest temperature on the iron and a thin towel between for extra security. Try to avoid ironing on the edges. Since they have hand-rolled hems and stitched by hand they might crease and fold when ironed directly on top with a lot of pressure. Again, once ironed, leave it to cool down for a few minutes. All fabrics are more prone to creases when warm and humid.\n\nTo get a stain on a favourite piece of clothing is always a bummer, but the key to successful removal is time! Tend to your stain as soon as possible since the longer it sits, the harder it will be to remove.\n\nWhen looking dapper, one often adds a little perfume. A good tip is to put on your perfume before putting on your clothes and placing your square since the scent might stain on sensitive fabrics such as silk.\u00a0\n\nWine stains are sometimes inevitable, but not hopeless to remove! First action is to dab a little carbonated water on the stain. Make sure not to be too rough, so hydrate on a towel and gently pat your stained square with it.\n\nAfter a long week at the office or a late night of dancing, the best spa for both you and your pocket square is airing outdoors for a while.\n\nTry to avoid handling your square with greasy fingers. If due to a few cocktails and a late night greasy snack, this is unmanageable and you end up with stains, do not fret! Baby wipes or makeup remover wipes can get you a long way in dissolving the grease.\n\nGot chewing gum on your pocket square? Simply put your pocket square in the freezer and gently break off the chewing gum once it has stiffened. But please, if this happens to you, send us an e-mail and tell us your back story. It surely most be tremendous!\n\nIf you end up with stains you have no idea where they came from, put on a brave face and go to your trusted dry cleaner. It does not hurt if you flip a coin in a fountain on your way there. And if not even they can remove it, embrace it and consider it a part of life and a sign of good times. Fun and exciting days are sometimes a bit messy.\n\nFollow us for news!",
