        "text":"Investing For Income: Get Closer To Retirement\n\nInvesting for income\u00a0is a practice that everyone planning for retirement should consider. When you are trying to live off of your investments, you want some stability in your monthly income. You do not want to be living comfortably one month and scraping to get by the next.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Choose annuities: Selecting investments based on the annuity payment is a good way to provide some stability in your portfolio. When you have a regular payment coming in from your stock or bond, you will be able to budget accordingly.\n  \u2022 Invest 10%: Make it a habit to invest at least 10% of your paycheck towards your retirement. In the beginning you may feel a little pinched, but won't feel it after a while. This investment approach can make a sizable difference in your lifestyle after retirement.\n  \u2022 Consider other investments: There are plenty of investments out there that will provide you a regular income besides stocks and bonds. Consider renting out real estate or getting involved with the foreign exchange market.\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus",

        "text":"somesault festival\n\nCarrot and chickpea tagine with lemon\u00a0couscous\n\nPosted on Updated on\n\nCarrot and chickpea tagine with lemon couscous\n\nA dish served at Somersault festival from an outdoor Lia\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nMoroccan is one of those cuisines that combine sweetness, tanginess and aromas beautifully, transforming even the most basic of ingredients into deliciously opulent dishes.\n\nThis carrot and chickpea tagine is an ideal dish for outdoor cooking for the masses and can be executed easily in the most basic of outdoor kitchens, as we found out at Somersault festival at the end of July. The non-dairy ingredients not only make it light and healthy but also more suitable for camping and outdoor kitchens without refrigeration.\n\nWhat makes this dish, apart from the toasting of its aromatic spice mix, is the combination of ginger and onion which\u00a0are saut\u00e9ed at the first step of the dish. This pairing is not unique to Moroccan cuisine and I first came across it in Cambodia and then Kerala, where it seems to be the base for so many of the dry dishes that accompany family meals every day.\n\nThe accompanying lemon couscous is easy and quick to make. Its tanginess pairs well with the sweet spiciness of the tagine. In shortage of preserved lemons last month I used lemon and lime peel and much of their juice to flavour the couscous.\n\n\n(Feeds 4-5)\n\nFor Tagine\n\n1 onion\n\n4 garlic cloves\n\n1 T grated fresh ginger\n\n\u00be t ground cinnamon\n\n\u00bd t ground black pepper\n\n\u00bd t cayenne pepper\n\n\u00bc t ground cumin\n\n\u00bc t Ras-el-Hanout or couscous spice mixture\n\nA pinch of smoked paprika\n\nHandful of fresh coriander chopped\n\n5 carrots thickly chopped \u2013whole- (400g)\n\n5 cups precooked chickpeas, drained and washed\n\n2 T honey\n\nOlive oil for frying\n\nSalt for seasoning\n\n1 T lemon or lime juice (optional)\n\nFor Cous Cous\n\n4 T turmeric\n\nPeel of half a lemon\n\n2 T lemon juice and up to half a lemon\n\n3 garlic cloves (mashed or finely chopped)\n\n1.5 cup couscous\n\n\u00bc cup or a handful of chopped coriander\n\nSalt and pepper to season\n\n\n(One hour preparation and cooking time)\n\nFry the finely chopped onion and grated ginger (and a pinch of salt) in a little olive oil for a couple minutes.\n\nAdd the spices and fry for a bit more until translucent.\n\nAdd the garlic and fry for a minute or two at low heat -make sure it does not burn.\n\nAdd the carrots and stir fry until well coated with the spices.\n\nAdd the drained chickpeas and the lemon juice and a few pinches of salt.\n\nAdd a bit of warm water (just enough for the ingredients not to stick to the pan).\n\nAt the same time add the honey and some more olive oil.\n\nStir well, cover and simmer on low heat until the carrots are soft but still have a bite (usually twenty minutes).\n\nAt the end of the process add the fresh and finely chopped coriander and mix.\n\nWhilst the tagine is cooking boil one and a half cup of water.\n\nAdd some olive oil to a hot frying pan and fry the lemon peel and the turmeric.\n\nAdd the garlic and some salt and lightly fry but avoid burning.\n\nAdd the boiling water, season, mix and then stir in the couscous.\n\nTake off the heat and cover until the couscous rises and doubles in size.\n\nAdd the fresh coriander when the couscous is ready.\n\nTry and season to taste.\n\nLia\u2019s Tips:\n\nFor the tagine use a wide and deep frying pan, preferably twenty centimetres. This allows the liquid to evaporate more evenly and quicker speeding up your cooking time. It also means you don\u2019t need as much liquid to cook the carrots.\n\nAt the end of the cooking time there will be no sauce for this tagine but the dish should not be really dry. The honey and the added liquid should have formed a thin syrup that keeps the dish moist. If you run out of liquid as the carrots boil make sure you add enough to achieve this.\n\nThe dish is vegan but of course there is nothing stopping you from adding a couple of dollops of Greek-style yoghurt or some feta.\n\nYou can replace the fresh coriander with a tablespoon of dry coriander in the couscous if you would like.",

        "text":"Delete Temporary Windows Files to Speed Up Your Computer\n\ndelete temporary filesOver time, your Windows PC will build up temporary files. What are these temporary files for, you ask. Well, every time you run a program, temporary files are created periodically for backup purposes. This way, if the program happens to crash, the temporary files can potentially help you pick back up where you left off.\n\nThese temporary files are not automatically deleted after the program is shut down, so if you do not clean out these temp files regularly, you may have thousands of unnecessary files stored on your computer.\n\nAs you probably already know, these additional, unneeded files are taking up valuable space on your hard drive, which can ultimately contribute to much slower PC performance. There are many tools you can pay for that help remove temporary files from your PC, but this is easily a task you can perform yourself in Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7.\n\nYour first step should be to used the Disk Cleanup tool pre-installed with your Windows computer.\n\n  1. Click Start > Programs > Accessories > System Tools and then select Disk Cleanup.\n  2. After running an initial scan, Windows will alert you to the approximate amount of space that temporary files are taking up on your hard drive.\n  3. Check ALL of the boxes in the pop-up window, then click OK.\n\nThis solution will help remove the majority of the temporary files stored on your computer. Since many programs may store temporary files in locations other than those the Disk Cleanup tool check, you will also want to perform a search for additional temporary files that you can manually delete.\n\n  1. Open My Computer (or Computer in newer Windows versions).\n  2. In the search box, type the following characters: *.tmp (be sure to include the asterisk). This will search the entire hard drive so be patient if it take a few minutes.\n  3. After the results are shown, click the first result and scroll all the way to the bottom. Now hold down the SHIFT button and click the last result. This should select every temporary file that has been shown in the search.\n  4. With all of these files still selected, press and hold down SHIFT, then click DELETE.\n\nThis should permanently remove all of the temporary files. You should now be good to go, free of temporary files, and hopefully experiencing a faster computer.\n\nBe sure to perform this task on a regular basis to best ensure that temporary files are not slowing down your PC. We recommend doing this at least once a week or every other week.\n\nFeel free to share any other tips for removing temporary files in the comments below.\n\n..Sign up for Free Computer Maintenance\n\nPosted in Windows Tips Tagged with: , , , ,",

        "text":"When to Sign a\u00a0Memo\n\nThe following is an article written by X204 Business Communication Adjunct Lecturer Robin Fritz for eHow.com\u2019s Money section:\n\nTo sign or not to sign?\u00a0 That is the question that often arises when busy managers set out to write a memo.\u00a0 Unlike business letters \u2013 which clearly require a signature \u2013 memos are a different animal altogether, and whether or not to sign them isn\u2019t clear to many young managers just starting out in the business world.\u00a0 The following tips, however, will help shed some light on whether to sign or not to sign.\u00a0\n\nKnow the difference between a memo and a letter.\u00a0 Letters written on company letterhead are external documents \u2013 they tend to go to smaller outside audiences, such as clients, suppliers, industry regulators, etc. \u2013 making a signature a required element.\u00a0 Memos, however, are internal and usually go to a company\u2019s employees \u2013 which may include hundreds of people.\u00a0 In practice, memos DON\u2019T include a signature.\u00a0 But sometimes managers are wise to include their initials next to their name in the header.\u00a0 The real trick is knowing when and if to do so.\n\nKnow the purpose of a memo.\u00a0 Second to email, memos are a primary tool used by managers to share information with employees, whether it be simple announcements or key information regarding changes in policies.\u00a0 In short, some memos tend to be more sensitive in nature than others.\n\nHow sensitive is the information?\u00a0 Routine memos \u2013 those that deal with non-controversial topics \u2013 make up the bulk of memos sent by managers.\u00a0 These types of memos rarely require follow up and tend to be taken at face value.\u00a0 Other topics, such as corporate downsizing measures, reduced health benefits, etc., can be difficult for employees to hear and, as a result, their validity may be challenged.\u00a0 When the topic is sensitive, the memo writer may initial the memo to add validity to the contents.\u00a0 But even then, initials are NOT required.\n\nHow many people will receive the memo?\u00a0 Again, memos sometimes go to hundreds of people and even initialing them may be a time consuming task.\u00a0 In the business world, time is money \u2013 and adding even initials may be a large undertaking.\u00a0 When deciding whether or not to initial a memo, ask, what value is being added with this task?\u00a0 If none, skip it.\n\nTip: Signature blocks signal to readers that they\u2019ve reached the end of a letter.\u00a0 With memos, however, telegraph the ending by using transitional expressions highlighting the conclusion, such as \u201cIn closing\u201d or \u201cLastly.\u201d\n\nWarning: Remember, whether you\u2019re writing a memo or a letter, with or without a signature, the content can be a legally binding document.\u00a0 Never dash off any correspondence in haste \u2013 you could get yourself, and your company, in hot water.",

        "text":"Money may be the most talked about wealth contained within your estate, but the riches of your experience and wisdom can mean even more to family members down the line. Reinforcing family traditions can be built into your estate plan alongside your wishes regarding your money, property, and belongings. After all, what makes a family a family is its values and traditions \u2014 not its finances.\n\n\nIt\u2019s an excellent idea to hold a family meeting in which you discuss the \u00a0things that matter most to you. In addition to the value of sharing your wisdom, you can also make contention among your heirs less likely if they understand the reasons behind your choices. This is just one of the many reasons to have a family discussion about your legacy and your estate plan.\n\n\nHow to tell your story through your estate plan\n\n\nIt\u2019s a delight to get to hear your elders\u2019 stories of their fondest memories and wildest adventures, as well as the struggles they overcame to get the family where it is today. This wisdom provides meaning for a financial legacy that otherwise might just be viewed as a windfall. As part of your estate and legacy planning, you can decide to record your own personal history. Here are a few ways:\n\n\n  \u2022 Audio files: With the broad range of audio formats available today, you can record in the way that\u2019s easiest for you \u2013 anything from a handheld cassette recorder to the Voice Memos app on your iPhone. There are some easy-to-use digitizing services that can compile your stories into audio files to make available to your family and descendants.\n\n\n  \u2022 Video files: The same goes for home movies and other video recordings. Older film formats can be easily digitized and organized along with the videos from your phone. Today\u2019s technology also makes it easier than ever to add narration (and context) to a video, making the story all the richer.\n\n\n  \u2022 Photo albums: Many families have prized photo collections that catalog generations. It\u2019s a tragedy when something like this is lost in a fire or extreme weather event, or even misplaced in a move. Creating a digital database is a favor to your family in more ways than one: Not only will they have access to these memories at any time, they can also feel secure knowing that these family treasures won\u2019t be lost anytime soon and that multiple copies can be made for the different branches of the family.\n\n\n  \u2022 Letters and other writings: If you enjoy writing, you can also include handwritten or typed letters or stories to your family members in your legacy plan to be received and read at the time of your choosing. You can also include past letters and postcards that might be tucked away in the attic. It\u2019s not only a personal delight to relive the memories of the past by reviewing your old letters and postcards, but it\u2019s also a great way for younger generations to get to know and sincerely appreciate your life journey and legacy.\n\n\nPassing your values to the next generation\n\nSome estate planning strategies blend your finances and personal values. For example, we might have a discussion on some of your core values in life. Whether you feel most passionate about the need for your beneficiaries to travel and gain worldly experience, continue a unique family tradition like sailing or astronomy, or support meaningful charitable or spiritual work, we can draft trusts that contain funds specifically set aside for these endeavors.\n\n\n  \u2022 Educational trusts: If you value education, you might want to set up a trust to fund undergraduate and graduate degrees, med school, study abroad, or even community classes for your family\u2019s future generations. Because of sharp increases in educational costs within the U.S., your grandchildren will likely stand to benefit immensely from an educational trust.\n\n\n  \u2022 Incentive trusts: Similar to the way educational trusts set aside wealth for the purpose of funding a beneficiary\u2019s schooling, incentive trusts can also help steer the course of your descendants\u2019 lives be encouraging some paths while discouraging others. For example, an incentive trust could contain instructions for disbursements to be released when the beneficiary is working a part or full-time job. Or if family vacations were an important part of your upbringing, you could set aside funds specifically for your grandchildren to experience the same wonderful tradition you enjoyed.\n\n\n  \u2022 Charitable trusts or foundations: Charitable trusts or foundations establish a family legacy of supporting a particular cause, but they also have the added financial benefit of reducing income and estate taxes. They are an excellent way to help a charitable organization that\u2019s central to your core values and make your name associated with that philanthropic effort for generations to come.\n\n\nAre you curious about exploring a few of these options in your estate and legacy plan? Contact Slawson & Slawson\u00a0today, and we can schedule an appointment to go over your many options for showcasing your memories and values in a long-lasting way that truly benefits your family",

Favorite the stuff you like.\n\nGot it!\n\nJenny is in perpetual search for easy, weeknight recipes to attempt to feed her family. When they balk, she just eats more.\n\nYogurt Pancakes with Pomegranate\n\n\nWhen I woke up one Saturday morning and realized I had six girls sleeping in my house and that there would be a need for pancakes, I made my way to the fridge in the manner I suppose a horse owner heads to the stables, knowing a brushing and a hoof cleaning is in order. It might seem a chore to others, but it\u2019s one of those things that are so part of the regular order of sleepover life that you don\u2019t really think about it anymore.\u00a0\n\nUntil you realize there is no milk. Now first, to paraphrase the airlines\u2019 line on oxygen masks, please adjust your coffee before assisting your child. That meant a cup borrowed from the neighbor \u2013 STAT! -- \u00a0but that was not enough of the stuff for pancakes.\u00a0\n\nNo worries, it was Yogurt Pancakes with Pomegranate to the rescue. I decided to feed people under the age of 12 only, surmising, correctly, that the older ones would still be asleep once I had made breakfast, nominally cleaned it up, gone for an extensive run and come home, panting.\u00a0\n\n\nThis meant the recipe simply had to be tripled, and in a Barbie \u201cMath Is Hard!\u201d moment I did have to spend a good three minutes thinking about how many egg whites I needed.\u00a0\n\nFrom there it was a breeze. You\u2019re working just a few minutes with a hand mixer and stirring egg yolks with the dry ingredients (an unusual method no?) and before you know it, you\u2019ve got breakfast all but ready in ten minutes.\u00a0\n\nThis batter is really unusual however and you need to work with it a bit to make it from pan to plate in one piece. All those whipped eggs make it sort of jingly jangly and hard to flip; you\u2019re best off making large sized pancakes that you can really get your spatula under and watching them carefully. \u00a0They are light and a tad sour but delightfully so and really take on syrup nicely.\u00a0\n\nNeedless to say a person who has no milk has no pomegranates, either.\u00a0\n\nYogurt Pancakes with Pomegranate by SmallKitchCara\n\nServes 1\n\n1 egg\n1 egg white\n1\/2 cup plain yogurt, low- or non-fat is fine\n3 tablespoons flour\n1\/4 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon sugar\n1 pinch salt\n1 teaspoon butter\n1\/4 cup pomegranate seeds\nmaple syrup, warmed, for serving\n\nSee the full recipe (and save and print it) here.\n\n\nTags: jenny, jenny's in the kitchen, pancakes, breakfast, everyday cooking",

        "text":"\u2022 Craft Cotton Co\n\nPatchwork Stocking\n\nNothing looks better at Christmas than a row of stockings lined up along a fireplace, eagerly waiting to be filled with goodies, and it's even better when you get to discover what\u2019s been hidden in them on Christmas Day. I ran out of time for this make last year so I\u2019m making sure I get it made with plenty of time to spare, as my current stockings are starting to look a little bit threadbare!\n\nI was very lucky to receive some of The Craft Cotton Co. fabric for this make - the Stripes and Stars Fat Quarters. I love the colours of this Fat Quarter set; the greens and reds are just perfect for Christmas. I opted to do a striped patchwork effect for the stocking, with quilted detailing on the patchwork joins. I also opted to do a roll over top for the stocking as I like the effect it creates and I think it\u2019s nice to see a little of the lining, especially when the fabric looks so nice!\n\nYou will need:\n\n  \u2022 Pencil\n\n  \u2022 Paper\n\n  \u2022 Pins\n\n  \u2022 Ruler\n\n  \u2022 Needle and thread\n\n  \u2022 Sewing machine\n\n  \u2022 The Craft Cotton Company's Stars and Stripes fat quarter set, green plain\n\n-dyed polycotton and Heritage wadding\n\nFirst, make the stocking template:\n\nMake a stocking template the size you would like \u2013 the bigger you make it the more presents you can squeeze into it! Cut two templates of this stocking - keep one template whole to do the lining, wadding, and wadding lining fabric, and with the other template, cut it into strips, mine were 4cm wide. Make sure that you number these pieces; otherwise it can get a bit confusing putting them all back together!\n\nNow cut out the fabrics:\n\nCut out the lining fabric, wadding, and wadding lining fabric using the whole stocking template.\n\nNow using the same whole stocking template, cut out the main stocking fabric (make sure you leave a 5mm seam allowance when cutting out). The layout of fabrics I chose for the strips is shown below:\n\nNow to sew the strips together. Do this by placing two pieces right sides together and sewing down the seam. Once you have sewn them all together you should have one striped piece for the front and another for the back.\n\nAdding the quilting detail:\n\nLayer one piece of wadding, one piece of the lining fabric, and on piece of the striped outer stocking fabric pieces as shown:\n\nSew the detail you would like (as shown in the picture below). I chose to sew along the stripe joins for this and alternated between a straight stitch and a pre-set stitch on my machine that looked like a line of snowflakes.\n\nNow to make the hanger:\n\nPick one of the fabrics to make the hanger and cut a strip of 24cm x 6cm - I chose to use the green snowflake.\n\nNext, fold the strip in half length-ways with right sides facing and sew along the bottom and up the side leaving the top unsewn. Now just turn it the right way out and you have your hanging strip. Before sewing the front and back together, fold the strip in half to make the loop and pin to the back piece with the ends of the loop hanging 1cm over the edge of the back piece. I chose to place this 10cm down from the top edge to give enough space when the top edge is turned back over.\n\nNow sew the front and back together:\n\nPin the front and back pieces together with right sides together - the loop will be on the inside. Now sew the whole way around but leaving the top edge unsewn. Turn the right way round.\n\nFinally, making the lining:\n\nTake the front and back lining pieces and place them right sides together - sew around this leaving the top edge unsewn. Leave the two pieces right sides facing together.\n\nThis lining can now be inserted into the stocking.\n\nTo attach to the stocking, fold the top of the stocking inward by 1cm and fold 1cm of the stocking lining outwards and slip stitch the two edges together.\n\nRoll the top back over and you now have your stocking!\n\n\u00a9 By Lesley Foster at Hook, Stitch, Sew for The Craft Cotton Company 2015\n\n#freesewingtutorials #craftcottonco #patchwork #christmas\n\n  \u2022 Facebook - White Circle\n  \u2022 Twitter - White Circle\n  \u2022 Pinterest - White Circle\n  \u2022 Instagram - White Circle\n\n\u00a9 2016 created by Raeven Branch",

        "text":"Tuesday, May 20, 2014\n\nProtect yourself and your familiy from rabies\n\nWhether you are in your home, walking in your neighborhood or hiking on a trail, it is important to know what to do if there\u2019s a chance you have been exposed to rabies.\u00a0 Rabies is caused by a virus that is spread through the saliva of an infected animal. \u00a0Even tiny breaks in the skin allow the rabies virus to spread from the infected animal to humans and other animals.\u00a0 Taking the right action can make a big difference in keeping yourself, your pets and our community safe from rabies.\u00a0\n\nTreatment for rabies is very costly and is not covered by all health insurance plans.\u00a0 Health Director, Gibbie Harris, reports that when someone has been potentially exposed to rabies, it is crucial for health officials to be able to assess the risk of exposure by testing or quarantining the identified animal.\u00a0 This is why it is very important for the public to know that they should get help from Animal Control to capture and remove the animal rather than to let it go.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIn 2013, Buncombe County Health and Human Services reported 843 animal bites that required investigation by Disease Control Nurses to help victims determine if they were exposed to rabies.\u00a0 Over 20 people received rabies prevention care (clinically known as post-exposure prophylaxis \u2013 PEP).\u00a0\n\nAccording to Gibbie Harris, Buncombe County Health Director, the two most common mistakes people make are 1) letting a bat outside, leaving no way to test the bat for rabies; and 2) not having information that helps us investigate whether an animal that bit them or their pet was properly vaccinated.\u00a0\n\nLearn how to protect yourself and your pets from rabies.\u00a0 Important ways you can help prevent exposure to rabies:\nVaccinate your dogs, cats and livestock (cows and horses) and keep them up-to-date. Call animal control to help you capture a bat if it is in your home or remove a sick or injured wild animal near your home.\u00a0\nDo not feed, handle or adopt wild animals including wild or feral cats. \u00a0More than 90% of all animal rabies cases reported each year occur in wild animals, primarily bats, raccoons, foxes and skunks.\nTeach children to avoid any contact with animals they do not know.\nWhat do you do if\u2026\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 You wake up and find a bat inside your home?\u00a0 Call animal control to remove it. \u00a0It may be needed for a rabies test. \u00a0\nDo not remove a bat that you discover inside your house without calling Animal Control first. Contain the bat by carefully throwing a blanket or box over it or simply closing it in a room.\u00a0 Then call animal control to remove it.\u00a0 Bites from bats are so small that it is difficult to notice.\u00a0 Bats commonly have rabies, which means it is critical to test the bat for rabies.\u00a0 If health officials are unable to test the bat then those who were exposed will need rabies prevention care.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 You, your child, or your pet is bitten by someone\u2019s pet?\u00a0 Do not leave the scene of the incident until you have exchanged contact information (phone number and residence) with the pet owner.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 A sick or aggressive animal is near your home?\u00a0 Call Animal Control to remove it.\nIf you see a dog, cat, fox, raccoon, skunk or other wild animal that seems sick or aggressive it is best to call Animal Control to remove it.\u00a0 They are trained to capture animals that might have rabies or other diseases.\u00a0 (Animal control does not remove otherwise healthy or stray animals.)\no\u00a0\u00a0 Do you live in Asheville City Limits?\u00a0 Call Asheville Police \u2013 252-1110.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Do you live in Buncombe County?\u00a0 Call Buncombe County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2013 250-6670\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 You had contact with the saliva of a sick or injured wild animal or have been bitten by any animal?\no\u00a0\u00a0 Wash your hands and area exposed to saliva bitten or with soap and water.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Call your doctor or the Department of Health right away! There is a vaccine that must be given soon (within 72 hours) to protect you from getting rabies.\no\u00a0\u00a0 Call animal control to capture and remove the animal.\no\u00a0\u00a0 All potential rabies exposures or bites are reported to Disease Control at Buncombe County Health and Human Services at 250-5109.\n\nBe alert to signs that an animal may have rabies. Some animals may show no symptoms at all.\u00a0 Others may have all of these symptoms:\no\u00a0\u00a0 Unusually aggressive behavior (attacking, biting)\no\u00a0\u00a0 Increased drooling\no\u00a0\u00a0 Stumbling or falling\no\u00a0\u00a0 Refusing to eat\no\u00a0\u00a0 Moving slowly or appearing paralyzed\no\u00a0\u00a0 Wild animal may lose fear of people.\n\nNo comments:",

I do not know if these are crayfish or crawfish, as they have no discernable claws - unless I only ever see the female versions?\n\nThey are a freshwater shellfish similar in many ways to prawns as regards cooking and size. They average 4 inches in length, but larger and smaller versions exist - probably related to when they are harvested.\nYou should always buy these fresh from large tanks in either supermarkets or wet markets, and refuse any that are already dead.\n\nThe ones pictured were bought in October 2010 and measured up to 5 inches long. I managed to take this picture just before my wife cooked them.\n\nWhen cooking, treat exactly like you would prawns of the same size. My wife usually boils them whole, or sometimes steams them in a wok with spacer. Cooking time is around 4 minutes when boiled.\nImage: Seurng Mor or Crayfish - Click to Enlarge\nI really do like shellfish, but I am not really taken with these things. They have very little flavour, and what there is tastes a bit 'grungey' for want of a better description.\n\nMy real problem however is finding any meat! What there is is underneath a hard body shell that is very difficult to break into, and whilst this does eventually peel away like a prawns, it is a lot of work. Once inside there is a ribbon of tasteless meat, and that's all. My wife chomps the heads off them and then chews the body. Whilst I don't now mind doing this with prawns, I really don't see the point of it all here.\n\nChinese Recipe 1\n\nThe normal way to cook these is to wash them under water and stir fry for several minutes, tossing fairly often. You can cook them in water or steam them, or put into hot oil. The oil could have either or both a clove of garlic and a little freshly diced ginger, but the taste is perhaps better without. Cook until they begin to turn pink and immediately remove from the heat, plate, and serve. A small condiment bowl of soy sauce is usually provided at table for dipping as you like.\n\nChinese Recipe 2\n\nI have seen these presented by shellfish restaurants in 'curls'. By this I mean the chef strips out the uncooked meat from the back and sets it aside to marinade. I have tasted this when marinated with Fish Oil Sauce (The stuff in bottles).\n\nTo a hot wok add a little: oil, garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for 1-minute before throwing in the meat and half-inch cubes of fresh tofu. Flash-fry for another minute. The meat should curl and turn pink in this time. Add a little water, some chicken bouillon powder, and several inches of tomatoe puree. Complete with fresh chopped coriander leaves and a pinch of salt and pepper. Serve when the tofu is crispy golden brown by adding contents to a serving dish, and drizzle the gravy over the top.\n\nThis information is as supplied by ourselves, and ably supported by our friends and various internet portals.\nSearch this Website\nSearch Query\nImage: Wax Gourd - Click for Details\n\nImage: Lao Lin - Click for Details\n\nImage: Ba Choi - Click for Details\n\nImage: Cheung Choi - Click for Details\n\nImage: Chinese Garlic - Click for Details\n\nImage: Chinese Honey Stick - Click to Enlarge\nPage Navigation: Top of Page\nLink to: - Excellent Hosting and Support Services\nPlease be kind and use the link above when ordering - It costs you the same, and helps me fund this free website, thank you!\nImage for Decoration only\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Copyright Webmaster @ ChinaExpats Links",

        "text":"Spine Pain\n\nSpinal Fusion- Quick Guide\n\nMedical science has achieved great success in the recent decades and this has given a breath of fresh air to humanity. There were days when people used to die of a common cold and now even cancer can be treated if detected at the right time. This shows how advanced science has become and we do not have to worry about pain and suffering anymore. When it comes to the vertebra, spinal fusion is a medical procedure, which benefited a large number of patients suffering from spinal or back problems. Spinal fusion is a very popular surgical measure to treat many back problems and many other issues. It has been proven in the past that spinal fusion has given relief to numerous patients who had lost all hope. Here is all you need to know about spinal fusion and Spinal Fusion Recovery!\n\nWhat is spinal fusion?\n\nSpinal fusion is a surgical technique, which is used to join two or more vertebrae together. It is also known as spondylodesis in medical terms and is a very beneficial procedure. A supplementary bone tissue is fused with the body\u2019s natural bone growth processes, which can be taken from either the patient or the donor\u2019s body. This fusion is used to eliminate the pain, which is cause, by the abnormal motion of the vertebrae. Here, the defected vertebra portion is immobilized so that the pain is reduced. This medical procedure is used to treat many deformities and spinal abnormalities. It has proven to be a very effective technique in medical science.\n\nWhy do we need spinal fusion?\n\nSpinal cord treatment or spinal fusion is used to treat any deformities in the spinal cord or vertebrae, which cause pain to the body. Spinal fusion is the preferred way to treat even scoliosis and kyphosis. It is done most commonly in the lumbar region where the spine is located. It is also used to treat cervical and thoracic problems. Therefore, when it comes to treating spinal deformities you 3must always remember spinal fusion technique. For the medical procedure, bone, metal plates and sometimes-even screws are inserted into the vertebrae to immobilize the deformed vertebra portion. This results in the reduction or removal of pain!\n\nSpinal fusion surgery used to treat the following cases:\n\n\u2013 Spinal stenosis\n\n\u2013 Degenerative disc disease (DDD)\n\n\u2013 Scoliosis (Read: Common Types of Spinal curvature Disorders)\n\n\u2013 Herniated disc\n\n\u2013 Tumor\n\n\nWhat are the spinal fusion recovery measures?\n\nAfter the spinal fusion surgery has been performed, the patient must remain under great care. This is because the spinal cord or the vertebra needs its own time to recover depending on the kind of deformities caused top the vertebrae before the surgery. The patient must be still and perform zero activities apart from the necessary actions such as eating and a little talking. Any damage cause to the recovering spinal cord can be tragic, as it would take another medical procedure to again keep the vertebrae in its place.

        "text":"How To Refinance Everything In Your Life\n\nBy Kali Hawlk | May 2, 2016\n\nEver wished you could have a do-over on the terms of your auto or student loan? Guess what? The benefits of a refi aren\u2019t just for homeowners.\n\nLet\u2019s play a little word-association game. What comes to mind when you hear the word \u201crefinance\u201d? If you answered \u201cmortgages,\u201d you\u2019re not alone. A mortgage is the one type of loan that\u2019s probably most frequently associated with refinancing. But refinancing goes beyond just helping people give their mortgages a makeover: Did you know that the concept of a refi can apply to just about any kind of loan, from your student loans to your auto loan?\n\nWhether you\u2019re renting a pricey studio apartment in San Francisco, CA, or a home in Richmond, VA, if you\u2019re a renter with any type of loan, it\u2019s worth understanding how the process works \u2014 and how it can help you.\n\nHow can renters take advantage of refinancing?\n\nYou can refinance almost any type of debt, not just mortgages. If you have car loans or student loans, for example, you may be able to refinance them. Refinancing simply means you\u2019re taking one loan and replacing it with another, with the new loan having different (and preferably more favorable) terms than the old one. You may want to refinance a loan to get a better interest rate than your original debt carries or to reduce the monthly payment you make. You can also consolidate many loans into a single one. Any of these outcomes can make personal debts easier to manage \u2014 and therefore easier for you to repay.\n\nIf you have a variable-rate loan and long for a more stable monthly payment, you may want to refinance simply to secure terms that present a little less risk. For example, swapping that variable-rate loan for a loan with a fixed interest rate could help with budgeting. But if you\u2019re thinking about refinancing a loan to enjoy one or more of these potential benefits, it\u2019s important to understand that there are two kinds of refis to choose from: rate-and-term and cash-out.\n\nWhat you need to know about rate-and-term refinancing\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in refinancing something like an auto loan or student loans to get a better interest rate or change the loan term, consider rate-and-term refinancing. This type of refinancing can be beneficial to borrowers if you originally took out your loan when interests rates were much higher than what you can get today. It\u2019s also helpful if you need to alter the amount of your monthly payment. A refi can update the loan term, and changing the length of that term will impact how much you owe each month.\n\nWhat about cash-out refinancing?\n\nCash-out refinancing offers you an interesting option. Going with this type of refi means that your new loan is for more than your existing loan. You get the difference between the new loan and the old in cash. It\u2019s great to have this extra money in hand, but keep in mind, this increases the debt that you carry. You\u2019ll need to repay the entirety of the loan plus the cash you received, and you\u2019ll have to pay interest on all of it.\n\nBefore refinancing everything, consider the downsides\n\nWhile both these refinancing options can be helpful to borrowers, there are some downsides. Just because you carry some debts doesn\u2019t mean a refi will help you manage your repayment or will save you money over time.\n\nIf you want to refinance student loans, for example, you need to remember that this process replaces your old debt with a new one \u2014 and that new loan will come with new terms and benefits. Some federal loans are eligible for benefits like payment programs or even loan forgiveness. If you refinance, you could be disqualified from accessing that repayment help.\n\nAnd refinancing any loan comes with a cost. You\u2019ll be originating a whole new loan, so expect to pay fees just like you did when you originally borrowed the money. This could eliminate any savings you\u2019d accrue over time via a lower interest rate, so always do the math before making your decision. Refinancing could cost you more money in interest over time too. Changing the terms of your loan may lower your monthly payments, but it could also mean you make those payments for a longer time. Stretching out the life of your loan also means paying more in interest. It\u2019s important to weigh the costs, because you might be surprised to find that continuing to pay down your current loans could remain the best option for you.\n\nBottom line: Should you consider refinancing your loans?\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to refinance the loans in your life will depend on your personal situation. Are you doing well in managing the repayment of your debts? If so, you may be better off continuing to do what you\u2019ve been doing to pay down those balances and reach debt freedom. If, on the other hand, you could secure a lower interest rate, get a more manageable monthly payment, or enjoy better terms on a new loan, consider refinancing. Refinancing isn\u2019t just for homeowners, so don\u2019t be afraid to find out if a refi could improve your financial life.\n\nWould\u00a0you refinance student loans or your auto loan?
