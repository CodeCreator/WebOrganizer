        "text":"Please note javascript is required for full website functionality.\n\nArray of Light\n\nArray of Light\n\nThis article provides a basic introduction to array formulae using a simple problem as an example. By Liam Bastick, director with SumProduct Pty Ltd.\n\n\nA data file has been created with two columns, dates and data, viz.\n\nDates Challenge\n\nIs there a simple formula to put in cell G12 (yellow cell) which will return the most recent date at which the corresponding data was less than or equal to the value in the \u2018Target\u2019 cell (cell G14)?\n\nIt can be assumed that there will be at most one data point for each date, but the dates may not necessarily be in ascending order. \u00a0The ideal formula should take into account what happens if no date meets the criterion.\n\n\nTo be a successful solution, the formula had to allow for dates out of order and provide a meaningful output (i.e. not \u201c0\u201d) if there was no solution.\n\nIgnoring the error trap requirement, possible solutions include:\n\n  \u2022 An array function, e.g. ={MAX(IF($G$18:$G$40<=$G$14,$F$18:$F$40))}\n  \u2022 Database functions by building a \u201ccriteria table\u201d (sic) and using =DMAX(database,field,criteria) (I plan to explain DFunctions in March\u2019s column)\n  \u2022 SUMPRODUCT, e.g. =SUMPRODUCT(MAX($F$18:$F$40*($G$18:$G$40<=$G$14)))\n  \u2022 INDEX, e.g. =MAX(INDEX((F18:F40)*(G18:G40<=G14),))\n  \u2022 Including an extra column to identify dates that met the criteria, then finding the most recent date using the MAX() function.\n\nTypical solutions are provided in the attached Excel file.\n\nCommon mistakes included using the LOOKUP() function (this requires the dates to be in strict ascending order), getting the inequality the wrong way round and forgetting the error trap.\n\nIn summary, to solve this problem, you needed to find the most recent (biggest) date out of a list of dates that met a particular condition: one viable option is to consider an array.\n\n\nIn Excel, an array is a contiguous set of items in a single row (called a one-dimensional horizontal array or \u201cvector\u201d), or in a single column (a one-dimensional vertical vector), or in a table consisting of at least two rows and two columns (a two-dimensional array). \u00a0If you need more dimensions, you are better served with relational databases such as MS Access.\n\nArray formulae perform multiple calculations on one or more of the items in an array. \u00a0Array formulae can return either multiple outputs or a single result. \u00a0There are two types:\n\n  \u2022 Formulae that work with an array or series of data and aggregate it, typically using SUM(), AVERAGE(), MIN(), MAX() or COUNT(), to return a single value to a single cell. \u00a0Microsoft calls these single cell array formulae\n  \u2022 Formulae that return a result in to two or more cells (there are various formulae that will do this including MINVERSE(), LINEST() and TRANSPOSE()). These types of array formulas return an array of values as their result and are referred to as multi-cell array formulae.\n\nSome functions, such as SUMPRODUCT(), INDEX() and OFFSET() will allow you to work with an array in a single cell by just pressing ENTER. \u00a0However, Excel often needs to know you are working with an array formula, and this is performed by entering the formula using CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER. \u00a0This will result in the formula appearing in braces ({}). \u00a0These braces cannot be typed in.\n\nArray formulae allow you to perform tasks that would require multiple cells otherwise (hence some readers used an additional column).\n\nOur problem requires working with a list to return a single value, i.e. using a single cell array formula on a column vector.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the most common right answer (excluding the error trap):\n\n\nThe central formula, IF($G$18:$G$40<=$G$14,$F$18:$F$40), checks to see which data is less than or equal to the target value ($G$14) and returns the corresponding dates (otherwise it provides a default value of FALSE since the value_if_false in the IF(logical_test,[value_if_true],[value_if_false]) syntax is not defined).\n\nHence we get an array in the form {Date_1,FALSE,FALSE,Date_2,\u2026}. MAX() simply takes the largest value, i.e. the most recent date \u2013 easy!\n\nProblems with Arrays\n\nMulti-cell formulae can cause problems as the range of cells to hold your results must be selected before you enter the formula. \u00a0Once entered, the contents of an individual cell in a multi-cell array formula cannot be edited and \/ or deleted.\n\nEnd users may not understand your array formulae. \u00a0How many basic Excel users would understand the MAX(IF) array explained above? \u00a0Advanced users will all too often use an array function when there are simpler, easier to understand alternatives.\n\nLarge array formulae can slow down calculations significantly. \u00a0Worse still, they can simply stop calculating with no error message provided.\n\nIn conclusion, array formulae can be very powerful but they should be used sparingly.\n\nIf you have a query for this section, please feel free to drop Liam a line at or visit the website",

But with temperatures rising very quickly, be sure not to put your pet in harms way.\u00a0Check out some heat safety tips for keeping your pets cool and safe during the hot summer months.\n\n\nNever leave your pets in the car\n\nHeat Safety\n\nEven on warm, sunny days, the inside of a car heats up quickly, even with windows cracked. Never leave your animal alone in a parked car. If you see an animal in a car on a hot day and cannot locate the owner, call 911! Then, stay by the car until help arrives.\n\n\nWatch out for hot pavement!\n\nDark pavement easily absorbs heat when the weather is very sunny and hot. Avoid pets walking on pavement for extended periods of time as this captured heat from the pavement can warm an animals body and potentially burn paw pads. To see if pavement temperature is too hot, place your bare hand or bare foot on the pavement. If the pavement is too hot for you, it is too hot for your pet!\n\n\nProvide cold water and shade\n\nIf you must have your pet outdoors or must house our pets outside, provide them with a shaded shelter, and always make sure they have plenty of cold water.\n\n\nBe practical\n\nAs much as we love spending time with our pets, we need to keep their safety a priority. Leave your pets at home if you plan to be outdoors for extended periods of time, if the weather is too hot, or if your activity level will be too intense for your animal. It is better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\n\nA dog\u2019s normal body temperature is 101 to 102.5 degrees. If her temperature reaches 107 degrees, she can suffer brain damage or even death.\n\nHeatstroke symptoms include: excessive panting, a sudden stopping of panting, salivation, an anxious or staring expression, weakness, muscle tremors, red tongue, blue lips, vomiting, collapse or coma.\n\nIf your dog show symptoms of heatstroke, immediately do the following:\n\n  \u2022 Move the dog to a cool, shady place\n  \u2022 Pour cool water on him and offer him some water to drink\n  \u2022 Fan him vigorously to promote evaporation\n  \u2022 Rush him to the veterinarian\n\nDO NOT apply ice, since it will constrict blood flow and inhibit cooling.\n\n\nIntense heat can cause the same problems for pets as it does for humans, including overheating, dehydration, sunburn and heatstroke.\n\nFor more ways to help keep pets safe, download and share our Pet Heat Safety flyer to alert others of the dangers and severity of hot weather for pets.\n\nVisit our Amazon wish list\n\nPetco Foundation\n\nPet Wellness Days\n\nLow-Cost Pet Vaccination Clinics!\n\nComplete Annual Vaccination Packages for Dogs & Cats Starting at Only $40!\n\nLearn More...\n\n\nFollow Us!\n\nLifeLine Animal Project\n\nFounded in 2002 and now managing DeKalb and Fulton County Animal Services, LifeLine Animal Project is the leading non-profit organization working to end the euthanasia of healthy and treatable dogs and cats in metro Atlanta shelters.

        "text":"Getting Started with Breastfeeding\n\nGetting started with breastfeeding can be difficult and we are sure that you would have heard (or even experienced with a prior baby) some horror stories about breastfeeding gone wrong. Below are some tips and some useful information to get your breastfeeding journey started on the right boob (ha ha, see what we did there!).\n\nbaby breastfeeding\n\nSkin to Skin\n\nThe best thing for mom and baby immediately after giving birth is allowing them to tap into their instincts. The moment your baby is born give your naked gooey baby a cuddle on your naked chest and watch as your baby\u2019s instincts take over. The smell of your milk will make them raise their head and inch (incredible right!) towards your breasts seeking out their first feed. Watch as your baby latches themselves on (with a little help from you if needed).\n\nHaving Skin to Skin cuddles with your baby immediately after birth (your partner will also benefit from skin to skin cuddles) will make breastfeeding that much easier. Your baby hears the familiar sound of your heartbeat, smells your familiar scent and is calm and content with all those lovely Oxytocin hormones rushing around.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself. You have just done something amazing and your body and hormones are all over the place. So, if your baby isn\u2019t getting the hang of it straight away, don't try to force it. Take a deep breath, embrace the naked baby cuddles and then try again.\n\nGetting a good latch - Burger or Spaghetti\n\nPre-baby you would have read (or watched) up on breastfeeding and maybe even attended antenatal classes. They all would have mentioned holding your baby in a football position and bring baby\u2019s nose to your nipple, then having them latch on. What they might not have mentioned is that your baby\u2019s chin should be towards your breast, so their head is tipped back, the tip of their nose pointing up to the ceiling, and you should be able to see up their nostrils. So It should really be called nostrils to nipple!\n\nbaby latch\n\nSounds so simple doesn\u2019t it? But how do you know if you are doing it right. Here\u2019s an easy trick: does it look like your baby is enjoying a delicious burger or slurping up some spaghetti?!\n\nSpaghetti (or nipple feeding) latch almost always results in excruciating pain as your baby\u2019s sharp gums are gnawing on your sensitive nipples. Yikes!\n\nBurger (proper breastfeeding) latch, your baby should have a mouth full of nipple and areola (this is the darker colored area surrounding the nipple) which hurts a lot less and once your nipples have become accustomed to the process it won\u2019t hurt at all.\n\nIf you are struggling with the nose to nipple technique try this:\n\n  \u2022 have baby\u2019s cheek rest on your breast (like a lovely pillow) and let them smell the milk.\n  \u2022 hand express some colostrum if they are sleepy. Wait for them to open their mouths as wide as they can.\n  \u2022 pop a big mouthful of areola and nipple in there by holding your breast like a burger. Be confident and quick!\n\nRemember it always helps to have baby skin to skin when breastfeeding in the beginning as it calms them and triggers their instincts. If you continue to struggle to get a good latch reach out to your local Health Visitor, breastfeeding support peer or other mums for help and don\u2019t forget to ask them to check that your baby doesn\u2019t have a lip or tongue tie.\n\nNursing positions\n\nThere are lots and lots of different nursing positions you can try, below we have listed the most common ones\n\nCradle hold\n\nHolding baby in the crook of your arm on the side you will be nursing on\n\ncradle hold\n\nHold your baby in the crook of your arm (head resting in the bend of your elbow) with your hand supporting the rest of baby\u2019s body (on the side you'll be nursing on). With your other hand hold your breast, placing your thumb above your nipple and areola and your index finger an inch below the bottom of your areola \u2013 just like a burger. Lightly compress your breast and when your baby opens her mouth wide \u2013 pop it in.\n\n\nCrossover hold - Holding baby\u2019s head with the hand on the opposite side you will be nursing on\n\ncrossover hold\n\nHold your baby's head with the hand opposite to the side you\u2019ll be nursing from (if nursing from the right hold the head with your left hand). Rest your wrist in the middle of the baby's shoulders with your thumb behind one ear and your other fingers behind the other ear. With your free hand hold your breast as you would for the cradle hold.\n\n\nFootball hold - Holding baby under your arm like a football\n\nfootball hold\n\nHold your baby at your side, facing you, with baby's legs tucked under your arm on the same side as the breast you're nursing from. Support your baby\u2019s head with the same hand and use your other hand to hold your breast as you would for the cradle hold.\n\n\nLaid-back position (\u201cbiological nursing\u201d) - leaning back and holding your baby tummy-to-tummy\n\nbiological nursing\n\n\nMaking sure you are well supported by pillows, relax back on a bed or couch and place your baby tummy-to-tummy onto your body with her head near your breast. Your baby can rest on you in any direction, as long as the whole front of baby\u2019s body is against yours and can reach your breast. Your baby will be able to naturally latch on in this position (or with a little direction from you).\n\n\nSide-lying position - Lying down on your side with baby tummy-to-tummy\n\nside lying position\n\nBoth you and your baby should lie on your sides, tummy to tummy. Use your hand on the side you\u2019re not lying on to hold your breast if you need to. VERY IMPORTANT \u2013 make sure there is no excess bedding around baby. Look at our breastfeeding at night article for more information.\n\n\nUpright Koala hold - Baby sits, with spine and head upright, straddling your thigh as your baby nurses\n\nupright koala hold\n\nBaby sits, with spine and head upright, straddling your thigh as baby feeds (newborns will need plenty of support). Brilliant for babies who suffer from reflux or ear infections.\n\n\nNursing in a sling - Baby sits in sling as baby nurses (best for babies who are experienced at nursing)\n\nnursing in a sling\n\nEnsure that baby is lowered in the sling for a good, deep latch and that you can always see your baby\u2019s face and your baby\u2019s chin is not pressed against her chest.\n\n\nNursing on the loo - nursing baby on your lap when nature calls\n\nnursing on the loo\n\nNature calls and your baby cannot wait to nurse. Sit down on the loo ensuring you have loo paper within reach of your free hand. Position your baby in the cradle hold position and fantasize about the day that you will be able to go to the loo by yourself (it will be years away).\n\nThis position is also useful for when nature calls and baby has fallen asleep nursing, however it does require a skillful one handed pull down (and up) of your knickers.\n\n\nEating and nursing position - Baby positioned in either football (as shown with a pillow), cradle or upright koala hold with a muslin (or napkin) draped across their heads (to avoid crumbs) as you eat your breakfast\/lunch\/dinner\n\neating and nursing\n\nYour baby innately knows when you are about to sit down and have something to eat and will decide that they need to eat as well (even if they just nursed 5 minutes ago!). Wait for your food to cool down a bit. Position baby in either cradle or upright koala hold with a muslin draped across their heads, to avoid crumbs and ensuring that you can still see your babies face. \u00a0Position your head as far to the side as possible trying to minimize food dropping on baby. Have your partner cut up your food into small bites and master the skill of eating with one hand.\n\n\nAnswering the door while nursing - baby positioned in an adapted one arm standing up hold.\n\nanswering the door\n\nDelivery services always seem to know when you have just sat down comfortably with your baby in a good nursing position and that\u2019s when they decide to knock at the door. You will need to speedily adapt your current hold into a one arm standing up hold while ensuring that your baby remains latched. Cradle, cross cradle or football hold works best for the adaptation.\n\n\n\nWe hope that this has been informative (and a bit lighthearted) and made you feel more confident about breastfeeding. \u00a0And can you spot which of our cartoons are wearing their Bshirts?!!\n\nNursing Information\n\nCheck out our new\u00a0nursing info section on topics such as the benefits of nursing.\nFind out how much easier it is to breastfeed confidently in public with the Bshirt compared to using a nursing cover.\n\nEthical & Organic\n\nWe use only GOTS Certified Organic and responsibly sourced cotton in the manufacture of Bshirt products. This means that there is no use of harmful chemicals, pesticides and dyes. Choosing to buy organic clothing is good for you, your baby and the environment.
