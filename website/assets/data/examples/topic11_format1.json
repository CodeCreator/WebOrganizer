Completely crowdfunded, to avoid any publisher or big company's agenda, Star Citizen is anticipated to launch in November 2014, with Alpha and Beta versions available to backers at undetermined dates. Please visit their website, at www.robertsspaceindustries.com\/about-the-game\/ . And if you are a gaming programmer, they are hiring for some positions at www.cloudimperiumgames.com .\n\nCheck out this awesome intro-video with in-game graphics:\n\nStar Citizen Crowdfund Pitch - 720p from Roberts Space Industries on Vimeo.\nPosted by Stratus on Sunday, July 07 2013 @ 00:35:35 UTC\n(Read More... | 52 comments | Score: 5) (19602 reads)\n\n\u00a0 IRC Back up & Network Changes\nNews from Stratus\nI would like to appraise you of some changes in the StarWars-IRC Network\u00a0(SWIRC). The network is owned and maintained by Jeff Turkstra. The\u00a0SWRebellion Network, which assumed management of the network in late 2011\u00a0has returned management to its primary owner, though Jeff aka Luke has\u00a0agreed to allow our staff to be on his network staff. The Star Wars IRC\u00a0Network now has 2 IRC servers in different physical locations. Bespin,\u00a0which is owned and operated by Luke (Jeff Turkstra) and Thrawn which is\u00a0owned and operated by the SWRebellion Network (owned by Evaders99 and\u00a0managed by Stratus et. al.). We have moved back to UnrealIRCD and IRC\u00a0Services. Services will be controlled by Jeff but we have been granted\u00a0access to administer them as well. All network issues that should arise\u00a0should be addressed to\u00a0staff at starwars-irc dot net. The appropriate person will\u00a0respond depending on the issue that occurs.\n\nWe'd like to thank Jeff Turkstra for his overwhelming support and\u00a0understanding for our own server troubles, and his assistance. We are\u00a0pleased to be linked to his network and once again be operating reliably.\nPosted by Stratus on Monday, January 09 2012 @ 02:35:01 UTC\n(Read More... | 27 comments | Score: 0) (9102 reads)\n\n\u00a0 ThaiCycles for Education\nNews from Stratus I am posting this message on behalf of my dear friend, Joel Ragar, Founder of ThaiCycles, an organization that raises money to provide bicycles for children in Thailand to allow them to obtain an education. Please visit www.thaicycles.com for details. Message follows:\n\nHi Everyone\nI am writing you, my friends, for some major help!\u00a0ThaiCycles\u00a0went live on\u00a0Tippingbucket.org\u00a0TODAY! (Saturday).\u00a0Tippingbucket.org\u00a0helps social ventures get funding.\u00a0 ThaiCycles has one week to raise $5,750\u00a0 on the\u00a0Tippingbucket.org\u00a0site. ThaiCycles donates bikes to children in third world countries who have no transportation to school. We just finished our first bike drop 2 weeks ago in northern Thailand. It was awesome and the children were so appreciative. With your help we can make a huge impact and difference. Directly from\u00a0Tippingbucket.org\u00a0we will be able to do a large bike drop immediately again (it is needed this time of year) as well as sustain ourselves to continue to help many many more within the next year.\n\nHere is what I am pleading for in me asking your help. Donate just $1 (or more if you can) on\u00a0tippingbucket.org.\u00a0 Each day till next Saturday (1 week) take 10 mins of your time to; post on your facebook status inviting others to donate too, send a quick email to all of your friends to donate and spread the word, post it on your blogs or ask friends you know to post it on their blog, tell family members\/cousins\/aunts\/relatives to donate a buck and spread the world too, text 10 friends to donate a buck and to text 10 other friends to do the same. And any other creative things you can think of to spread the word and social network to all the masses about ThaiCycles and our goal.\n\nThe only way we can make this successful is if I receive your help. I can't reach all of your friends and with your help we can reach the thousands we need to to raise the funds for ThaiCycles and donate hundreds of bikes to children around the world. Please please please help, I selected you to send this email out to because I knew you could help me make the difference.\n\nHere is the catch if we don't raise all the funds on\u00a0tippingbucket.org\u00a0before the time expires then all the money that was donated is given back to those who donated it and ThaiCycles does not receive anything. This is why I NEED your help to succeed and make a difference.\u00a0\n\nI have been very privileged to have started and been apart of ThaiCycles and now I need your help to keep the aid alive and growing. Please find it in yourself to dedicate the few 10-15 mins a day and make a world of difference.\n\nJoel Ragar\nFounder, ThaiCycles\n\nPosted by Stratus on Sunday, November 07 2010 @ 02:29:31 UTC\n(Read More... | 13 comments | Score: 0) (6267 reads)\n\n\u00a0 Loss of a Good Man\nNews from Stratus We mourn the loss of a friend and former colleague, Rhys Skywalker, who was killed in a card accident February 12th.

But they absolutely love it. So today here are some cursors from the mine craft game. These particular cursors were created by dakotaatokad. He gots a ton more cursors that you can get of minecraft, so check out his DA page.\n\nIn total there were a total of 25 cursors added today.

After multiple attempts to answer the question it became clear to me that I don't know it. So I did the password reset, but the security question keeps popping up. Searching the internet, there is no answer to how to reset the security question.\n\nGoing to facebook's help page, doesn't gives the answer. It's just a roundabout shmorgishborg of regurgitated crap.\n\nI added the like us widget three years ago, and now I have to probably take it down. If anyone knows how to get pass or reset the security question, let me know. So frustrating...\n\nMarch 2014 Favorite Cursor Of The Month\n\nDate: 1 Mar 2014, 11:43 By Tor With 15 Comments\nMulticursor Set\n\nMarch 2014 Favorite Cursor of the month is the \"Multicursor Set\".

        "text":"Cool Tech Reviews\n\nJust Cool Tech\n\nDecember 7, 2008\n\nNintendo Wii flood at on Monday, Dec. 8, 2008\n\nThe Nintendo Wii game console is hard to find again this holiday shopping season but Wal-Mart is promising to unleash a flood of them at their online store at this coming Monday, December 8, 2008:\n\nNintendo Co Ltd\u2019s Wii has emerged as one of the few hot products this holiday season, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc will offer \"tens of thousands\" of the hard-to-get video game consoles on its website starting on Monday. said it will offer the Nintendo Wii console for $249.24, and a \"value bundle,\" which includes the console and other items like an extra set of controllers, for $329, while supplies last.\n\nAs of Friday night, the Wii console was sold out on, and listed the sold-out Wii for $249.99. also said that it will offer, beginning on Monday, certain Wii video games at a price of two for $30, and certain accessories, like the Nintendo Wii Racing Wheel, starting under $10.\n\nIt may be rather tough on the Web site, but if you need a Wii head on over to tomorrow and try to get through.\n\nPosted at 9:45 am. Filed under Companies, Nintendo, Video Games, Wal-Mart, Wii\n\nRelated posts:\n\nNovember 15, 2006\n\nNintendo Wii games reviewed\n\nNintendo\u2019s new Wii game console goes on sale in the USA Sunday and in Japan on December 2 and expectations seem to be high for the inexpensive system which simply plays games, unlike its big ticket competitors from Microsoft (Xbox 360) and Sony (PS3) which have broader home entertainment aspirations. And if games make the console, it\u2019s interesting to read Chris Morris\u2019 review of the games launching with the Wii:\n\nTypically, when a new video game system launches, it proves to be anticlimactic. The thrill of seeing the machine boot up the first time is very real \u2013 and the first time or two you play a game is always fun. But before long, you start to realize that the titles that came out alongside the system aren\u2019t as entertaining as you initially thought.\n\nHappily, that\u2019s unlikely to be the case with the new Nintendo Wii. What the system lacks in technical achievements, it makes up for in the quality of its games. With \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\u201d leading the charge, the Wii\u2019s launch titles offer nice diversity.\n\nShooter games are usually the bulk of a system\u2019s launch, because hardcore gamers love them. But the Wii leans more in the direction of action\/adventure, with titles like Zelda, Konami\u2019s \u201cElebits\u201d and Ubisoft\u2019s \u201cRayman Raving Rabbids,\u201d all set to appear in the first month or so.\n\nThe Wii appeals to a different demographic, of course. Anyhow, Morris thinks highly of Zelda, but I was most interested in his comments about the sports games:\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Fans of Electronic Arts\u2019\u00a0\u201dMadden\u201d series probably already have their copy of the game, whether it\u2019s for Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0Xbox 360, Sony\u2019s\u00a0PlayStation 2 (or 3) or their handheld gaming system of choice. Normally, there wouldn\u2019t be any reason for them to consider buying a copy for Wii.\n\nBut \u201cMadden\u201d for the Wii is an entirely different game. Want to pass the ball? Don\u2019t worry about which button to press, just grasp the controller and mimic a pass. Bullet pass? Fake-throw it faster. It\u2019s intuitive, fun and physical. You might actually work up a sweat before you\u2019re through (which seems rather fitting for a sports game).\n\n\u201cWii Sports,\u201d which comes bundled with the Wii, is a good introduction to the system and controller. It\u2019s not advanced \u2013 and not all of the games are fun (boxing was something of a letdown) \u2013 but it\u2019s an ultimately addicting group.\n\nWhat he\u2019s referring to is the Wii\u2019s wireless motion-sensing controller. Check out this Wii TV commercial to get the idea. CNET\u2019s review says the controller \u201ceats batteries,\u201d but I\u2019d say that can be solved with an investment in rechargeables if you don\u2019t already have some. Overall:\n\nIt lacks the graphical prowess and rich media features of the Xbox 360 and the PS3, but the Nintendo Wii\u2019s combination of unique motion-sensitive controllers and emphasis on fun gameplay make the ultra-affordable console hard to resist.\n\nThe Wii may be hard to find, but the suggested retail price is $249.99, about half of the big guys.\n\nPosted at 9:02 pm.

I know, you have fond memories of it; I do too, aside from the fact that I remember being disappointed with it even as a child because it was more interested in \"rawr scary dinosaurs\" than actually showing off these magnificent, enormous animals. But the movie is about five minutes of cool, memorable moments mixed in with a bland, overlong plot that's mostly just people running around scared as everything gets ruined.\n\nThe science doesn't hold up, the characters are thin pastiches (including Jeff Goldblum being slimy enough to leave a residual bad taste in my mouth), and what made the movie work in the first place was how enormously compelling those dinosaurs look. That part still can impress viewers; not much else does. So \"Chris Pratt and a team of raptors vs. invisible T-Rex\" is really more of a lateral move for the franchise.\n\nThat's all, folks. Oh, right, What Are You Playing is here. Let us know in the comments!\n\nRead more\n\nWRUP: Card trick 74 edition\n\nToday's card trick is known as the\u00a0Ponzetti Reversal. It's called this chiefly because no one ever pays too much attention to card tricks which sound like chess maneuvers, but you can be certain that your audience will be amazed unless they're not.\n\nFirst, take an ordinary deck of playing cards. Shuffle, cut the deck, and draw seven cards. Ask a participant to take a random card from those seven, but don't look at it. Tell the participant to memorize the card. Then, return the cards to the deck. Shuffle again, draw seven more cards. Tap an island for one blue mana. Grab the bottom card on the deck and ask the participant if it's the right card.\n\nGet angry. Insist that it's the right card. Fling the deck of cards at the participant's head and inform them to find the [REDACTED] card without you, if the participant is so [REDACTED] smart. Break a window. Tell the police officers that you're completely sober. Refuse to put your shirt back on. Slam your head against the inside of the car window. Insist you want a lawyer after hurling insults at the cops for an hour. Let us know what you're playing in this week's installment of What Are You Playing. Lastly, produce the correct card.\n\nRead more\n\nOne Shots: The Reaper comes for all MMOs\n\nIn light of this past week's sad Landmark news, it's perhaps too on-the-nose that I asked for players to send in pictures of defunct MMOs.

Enjoy them to their fullest now!\n\n\"To prove I can actually be on topic sometimes, I answer your call for shots from defunct MMOs with one from Dragon's Prophet,\" Tyler said, \"the only game I've played that has shut down. There was a great deal wrong with this game, and I didn't play it for long, but there was still a lot about it that was surprisingly good. In particular I loved the unusual, battle mage-like Oracle class. Who wants to stand in the back waving your hands when your mage can charge into the thick of things and massacre everyone with a giant enchanted scythe?\"\n\nRead more\n\nWRUP: Year in preview edition\n\nWell, here we are, a new year. This one has a low bar to clear and it's already not doing a great job. I'd write a four-letter word here that rhymes with \"truck,\" but I like not being fired. Instead, let's just finish with our year in review nonsense by giving you the phrases you'll become intimately familiar with over the next year due to major news stories.\n\n  \u2022 January: \"It's unclear why so many MMOs are now engaged in cross-promotional campaigns with shaving cream, but still...\"\n  \u2022 February: \"A new imported MMO is out, and the studio behind it is very enthusiastic about its chances in the market.\"\n  \u2022 March: \"The new basketball minigame trend is getting out of hand.\"\n  \u2022 April: \"It turns out you can't fund your game with a Ponzi scheme.\"\n  \u2022 May: \"That new import from February is shutting down at the end of the month.\"\n  \u2022 June: Reserved for Stormblood.\n  \u2022 July: \"The three new upcoming Hellgate London relaunches.\"\n  \u2022 August: \"Daybreak has officially announced the shutdown of several games it is not running, begging the question of why.\"\n  \u2022 September: \"Boy, remember earlier in this year when no one was afraid of the chupacabre?\"\n  \u2022 October: Halloween.\n  \u2022 November: \"This year's BlizzCon featured an unfortunate incident with a snake and far too many computers on fire.\"\n  \u2022 December: \"Ugh, this year is finally almost done.\"\n\nHave fun!

Every sunset you see reminds you that another day is over, that you're going to be living a day further in the future. I never even thought it was possible to be depressed by sunsets until someone first told me that they were the sign of a day ending, of the sum total of everything bad going on. Things are ending.\n\nBut I never saw them that way. Sunsets mean a day is ending, but that also means that no matter how bad the day was, it's over now. Tomorrow is a new day, and whatever bad stuff happened during the day that's ending, you'll move away from it one sunset at a time. Every day marks a new beginning, a new start. We've lost, and we've faltered, and we've seen horrible things happen, but it's not the world ending; it's just this day. Each day forward is another day toward a better tomorrow.\n\nCheers to the end of this awful year, yes, but there's another one coming up, and that means we have another shot at making it better. Let us know What Are You Playing in the comments.\n\nRead more\n\nWRUP: Gifts for some edition\n\nIt's that time of year once again, when the Massively Overpowered staff loads into a sleigh and prepares to bring presents to all of the good boys and girls. Then, somewhere over Milwaukee, that plan changes to most of the good boys and girls. By the time we're in Pittsburgh, we're now delivering presents to the most good boys and girls, ranked chiefly by a sorting algorithm that we illegally downloaded from a GeoCities site that has somehow stayed up because no one told it that GeoCities was dead.\n\nUsually we hit a bar in Pittsburgh, just to \"get our groove back,\" and things get a little blurry. Last year, I remember waking up in my front yard with my head in a dollhouse and a pair of crudely constructed Lego shoes along with a piece of wrapping paper in my pocket which said \"to David (sic)\" and another one which just read \"call Bob, important.\" I don't know anyone named Bob. Now that you're feeling your face just melt from sheer overwhelming holiday cheer or whatever, let us know What Are You Playing on this holiday weekend. We've got gifts to load on a sleigh this year, most of which will hopefully reach some kids.\n\nRead more\n\nWRUP: Come for the main storyline, but stay for the food edition\n\nWelcome, traveler, to Hoodle's Watch! It's a town named after some guy, presumably named Hoodle. Anyhow, I'd ask you why you're here, but I already know; you're on the trail of some villainous plot or another and you need to do these quests for the next four levels before you move on. But may I suggest, my friend, that while you came for the main storyline, you stay for the food?\n\nSeriously, it's very good food. Chef Augustine over there has been experimenting with this sort of pan-continental fusion style, since we get so many adventurers passing through. And you haven't lived until you've seen what my daughter Jessa - that's her over there, hello Jessa! - can do with a turnip and a side of mutton. It's really delicious.\n\nSo maybe you can just... oh, I see, you're queued for a dungeon now. Well, all right, but at least go see what has Denna all up in arms, I hear there's a good hat at the end of the quest chain. Also, leave your name in our books so what know about What Are You Playing. Go have fun with the main plot!\n\n\nRead more\n\nMassively Overthinking: Our favorite MMORPG stories of the year\n\nEarlier this week, we posted our award for the biggest MMORPG story of the year -- the one we thought had the biggest impact on our genre. But in tonight's Massively Overthinking, we're going to put aside the bigger picture and talk about just the stories we liked, the stories we're proud of, the stories that define us, the stories we wish we could write all day long. I asked our writers to pick one story they wrote and one story somebody else on MOP wrote and talk about why they matter.

Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that infested Earth for decades and caused years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, was close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. In the midst of this crisis, Kane, Nod\u2019s prophetic leader, emerged from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he had developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he could not build this \u201cTiberium Control Network\u201d without GDI\u2019s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions\u2014GDI and Nod\u2014found themselves in a desperate and unlikely alliance to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.\n\nNow, after 15 years, the network is nearly complete. Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is only now that the world\u2019s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what he will want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.\n\nGlobal Agenda Preview\n\nWritten by igcompany on Sunday, 18 October 2009 07:36.\n\nGlobal Agenda\n\nGLOBAL AGENDA is a fast-paced action MMO using Unreal\u00ae Engine 3 set in Earth's near future, a spy-fi world of advanced technology and player-driven conflict.\n\nIn the wake of severe global disaster, the political face of 22nd century earth has changed and player-created factions scheme against each other for power. Traditional full-scale wars a thing of the past, factions must rely on covert agencies, teams of elite special operatives able to seize and defend key facilities. The future of humanity is their battleground, where knowledge is power, technology is a race, and everyone has an agenda.\n\nThe players control the world of Global Agenda, forging alliances with their peers and executing lightning strikes against their enemies. They determine which factions to aid and which to oppose, while the only thing that stands in their way is other agencies.\n\n  \u2022 Develop your agent - Create, extensively customize, and improve your agent character over the course of your career, complimenting your FPS skills with RPG-style progression and high-tech gear.\n  \u2022 Advance your agency - Join a player-created agency, compete in technology races for advanced equipment, and capture critical locations to increase your influence in the world.\n  \u2022 Compete in fast-paced PvP combat - Work with your allies to gather reconnaissance data, then raid or capture enemy-controlled facilities during objective-based missions. Equip yourself from a powerful array of weapons, armor, and strategic devices like triggered explosives, deployable turrets, stealth suits, holographic decoys, and remote control robots.\n  \u2022 Experience a dynamic, player-driven world - Agency leaders navigate through a global conflict of other player-run groups, striving to reach their goals first. Territory, resources, technology, and influence are all valuable commodities, with agencies engaging in politics, intrigue, and outright deception to control them.\n\nGlobal Agenda Gameplay Trailer:\n\nDivinity II - Ego Draconis Preview\n\nWritten by igcompany on Friday, 16 October 2009 13:38.\n\nDivinity II - Ego Draconis brings you back to Rivellon, a timeless world of awe and magic, torn and scarred by successions of apocalyptic wars. Ever since the Great War ended, the Order of the Dragon Slayers has had eyes only for their number one enemy: the Dragon Knights who killed their Divine hero.\n\nBut all the while the true enemy ? the Black Ring ? still festers beneath the surface, ready for its next move, poised to strike. For their leader Damian tirelessly plots silent schemes with utterly malign intent.\n\nThen one day, an event takes place that will reshape the history of Rivellon: a dying Dragon Knight gives her powers to a member of the order that seeks to destroy her: you.\n\nPerhaps you, blessed as you are with the powers of the Dragon, will be able to stop the black tides that threaten to engulf Rivellon. Many adventures await you, many mysteries yearn to be unravelled and all the world awaits the outcome of your new destiny.\n\n\nSign in with Facebook",

Arriving at the Monastery of the Unremitting Tide, the PCs face the suspicious scholars who study there, and in the process risk enraging an ancient spirit and uncovering a long-lost secret that, more than possibly costing them the stolen manuscript, could cost them their very lives.\n\nWritten by Martin Long\n\nView this session by itself\nPathfinder RPG: Pathfinder Society0 of 61 of 1\n\nWhen the flames of revolution swept through Galt, the Society lost much of what it held there: dozens of agents, several lodges, and the fellowship of countless contacts who foreswore the Society rather than become targets themselves. Although Venture-Captain Eliza Petulengro has reestablished a foothold in the country, she needs to rebuild her network of allies. One of the most important figures resides in Dabril, a small village due to celebrate its yearly festival of light and forgiveness. Petulengro hopes that an entourage of Pathfinders might participate in the festivities and endear itself to the Society\u2019s former friend. Past evils have other plans, however, and unless the PCs can keep their wits about them, they might not just lose sight of the mission; they might lose their lives.\n\n\u201cReaping What We Sow\u201d is a spooky adventure, perfect for fans of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures while still suitable for more light-hearted games.\n\nWritten by Linda Zayas-Palmer\n\nView this session by itself\nPathfinder RPG: Pathfinder Society6 of 61 of 1\n\nAs a repurposed prison, the Sandswept Hall Pathfinder lodge in Sothis is an imposing target for thieves, yet an enemy operative recently broke in, stole valuable property, and escaped into the sun-scorched deserts of eastern Osirion. The PCs are the best disposed to follow the culprit's trail. Be warned, though, for the Scorpion Coast is the battleground of powerful elemental tribes that have assailed Osirion's frontier with cruel sandstorms and deadly force for millennia.\n\nContent in The Sandstorm Prophecy also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the Scarab Sages faction.\n\nThe Sandstorm Prophecy is the first scenario in the three-part \"Tyranny of Winds\" campaign arc. It is followed by Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-10: Secrets of the Endless Sky and Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-12: Caught in the Eclipse. All three chapters are intended to be played in order.\n\nWritten by Charlie Brooks\n\nFactions: Scarab Sages\n\nView this session by itself\nPathfinder RPG0 of 60 of 1\n\nPlease sign up here if unable to play any of the scenarios offered, and if planning on attending.\n\nView this session by itself\nPathfinder RPG1 of 240 of 1\n\nPlease select this slot if you know for sure that you will be absent; this will help us prevent scheduling GMs if they are unable to attend.\n\nView this session by itself",

I hope they will go in the RTS direction rather than try to make an FPS out of it; it seems to me that the original model would work quite well with just a great audiovisual makeover. It might also be nice to ratchet up the number and complexity of the options you had to modify your cyborgs--and, by all means, keep the dark and brooding ambiance.\n\nSyndicate content",
