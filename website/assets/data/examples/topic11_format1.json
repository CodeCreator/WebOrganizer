The first question may be easy, but the difficulty will increase with each one, and a single wrong answer will end the quiz. Have no fear about it being too torturous; it\u2019s multiple-choice, so at the very least, you can test your luck! And in case you had to ask \u2013 \u00a0yes, Harry Potter is included.\n\nCapital of Palau Updated on Sporcle\n\n\nAfter many years of requests, and research, we\u2019ve finally updated the capital of Palau on Sporcle. For many years, we displayed\/accepted the region of Melekeok as the nation\u2019s capital, but as of today, we\u2019ve officially switched the answer to Ngerulmud. However, we\u2019ll continue to accept Melekeok for the time being as everyone gets used to the change.\n\nIf you have any questions\/comments, let us know on our feedback page.\n\nNew Badges: Coming Attractions, Red Badge of Courage, and Choose Wisely\n\nCelebrate the end of summer with one last BBQ, a trip to the beach, and these new badges.\n\nComingAttactionsComing Attractions: A good movie poster tells you what the movie is about with one image.

She\u2019s an animal person, with a special love for dogs. Outside of work she\u2019s goofy and sarcastic, but at work she\u2019s the picture of professionalism.\n\nInterests:\u00a0Traci likes to sit and watch TV for hours on end\u2026or go for a hike. She likes a mix of the indoor and outdoor, and made it her goal this year to do more hiking. She also likes playing board games with friends.\n\nHer favorite Sporcle quizzes are in the genre of\u00a0Clickable 1-100 Mines\u00a0and the Spacebar Challenge. Also, she\u2019s a huge Walking Dead fan. (Our insider investigation found out that she\u2019s played \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Episodes\u00a0quiz 6 times, with a 100% score.)\n\nStrange Fact:\u00a0After college Traci traveled to Guatemala where she lived and volunteered in an animal shelter for a month. In her words, she is \u201cweirdly obsessed with weird dogs.\u201d She volunteers at a Seattle animal shelter, and her favorite dogs are the neurotic, nervous dogs.\n\nHere at Sporcle:\u00a0Traci spends her time in numerous spreadsheets, handling financial reports and administrative tasks. As she puts it \u201ca lot of things come through me.\u201d\n\nFavorite thing about working at Sporcle: Traci likes that everyone works really hard, while maintaining their sense of humor. She adds \u201cI laugh at something at least once a day.\u201d Beyond the mix of hard work and fun, she loves getting to wear jeans to work everyday.\n\nTop Comments of the Week (08\/21)\n\nCheck out our favorite witty commenters below:\n\n1.\u00a0From:\u00a0Equator Countries\n\nUbbiebubbieSo, Equatorial Guinea\u2026 you\u2019ve been lying to me this whole time.\n\n2.\u00a0From:\u00a0Rhymes with \u2018SEEK\u2019\n\nstrags11Where I come from, \u2018steak\u2019 rhymes with \u2018seek\u2019. Well, OK, no, it doesn\u2019t, but this is a rhyming quiz so I feel kind of obligated to make a comment like this. I think it\u2019s in Sporcle\u2019s terms of service.\n\n3.\u00a0From:\u00a0\u201990s Song Title Match Up\n\ndlauthorSo I guess \u201cSmells Like My Pocket\u201d was more of a regional hit, then.\n\n4.\u00a0From:\u00a0MLB Teams (Redux)\n\nEl_DandyOne day you\u2019ll be back, Expos.

You\u2019ll have to remember all those tiny countries in Europe to get everything right. It\u2019s a minefield, so enter the answers you\u2019re sure about before making guesses. There are a few letters that are the start of only one European country, so if you can remember the only \u2018V\u2019 country, you\u2019ll be safe. Just remember to breathe as you type in the last few letters for each country.\n\nNew Badges: 2 Minute Drill, Body Language, and Blueprint Boss\n\nCan you figure out the blueprints to earn these new badges?\n\ne5dPi2INheJvRT8ZgMqUQMuFqOmLkALlRflwnVpMlvU2 Minute Drill:\u00a0In 2 minutes, you can do lots of things: brush your teeth, check your horoscope, or even play a Sporcle quiz.
