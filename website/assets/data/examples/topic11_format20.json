Under \"Good\" Disadvantages, the references to Honesty should be to Truthfulness instead.\n\nP. 44. Under the Skill Defaults: Using Skills You Don't Know sidebar, insert this paragraph in between the third and fourth paragraphs: \"Default levels in skills do not carry any of the skills' special benefits with them. Special benefits would include damage bonuses, dodge bonuses, 2\/3-skill parry, unpenalized off-hand use, move bonuses, and so on.\"\n\nP. 49. Battlesuit\/TL is Physical\/Average.\n\nP. 52. Under the Spear Thrower skill, delete the line that says to use ST+5 when using a Spear Thrower for determining damage and range. Spear Thrower now has a separate entry in the weapons tables.\n\nP. 63. Carousing defaults to HT-4.\n\nP. 65. Demolition defaults to Underwater Demolition-2, as well as the listed defaults.\n\nP. 68. Underwater Demolition should be listed as a TL skill.\n\nP. 73. In the Weapon Effects sidebar, delete \"(other attacks may do zero damage)\" under Thrusting Attacks.\n\nP. 74. Change the damage done by ST 4 or less in the Basic Damage Table. ST 4 has a basic damage of 1d-6 (thrusting and swinging); ST 3 has 1d-7; ST 2 has 1d-8; and so on.\n\nP. 74. The line at the bottom of the chart should read \"See p. 248 for a chart covering higher levels of ST.\"\n\nP. 90. We dropped a line from the top of the page in this and the previous printing. The first line should read \"Picking Things Up In Combat: In combat, a light item is picked up with the\"\n\nP. 97. Under Concentrate, the second sentence should read \"If the character is hurt, knocked down, forced to use an active defense, or otherwise distracted, he must make a Will-3 roll to maintain his concentration.\" Delete the third sentence.\n\nP. 98. In the attack penalties sidebar, the reference for strange position should be to p. 123, not p. 120.\n\nP. 101. Under Punching, add a note that its Reach is C,1. Under Kicking, add a note that its Reach is 1 without Karate training.\n\nThe first sentence under Kicking should read \"A kick is treated exactly like a punch, except your skill is DX-2, Brawling-2, or Karate-2, and you do straight Thrust\/Crush damage - or Thrust+1 if you are wearing heavy boots or something similar.\"\n\nP. 106. Under Step and Concentrate, the second paragraph should read \"If the character is hurt, knocked down, forced to use and active defense, or otherwise distracted, he must make a Will-3 roll to maintain his concentration.\"\n\nP. 109. In the Massive Damage sidebar, change the comment \"is lost and does not affect the victim\" to \"cripples the limb instead of dealing additional hits of damage.\"\n\nP. 111. Change the fourth sentence under Grapple to read \"Grappling does no damage, but the foe is at -4 DX and may not leave until he breaks free, or you let go.\"\n\nP. 119. Under Single-Shot Weapons change the last two sentences to \"This penalty is applied to a second or subsequent shot from the same gun, unless there is a minimum one-second pause between shots. The penalty is doubled if your ST is below the minimum listed for the weapon, and the minimum pause becomes two seconds.\"\n\nP. 119. In the Revised edition only, change the reference to GURPS Space in the Power Supplies sidebar to p. 247.\n\nP. 127. Under Crippling Injuries, change \"taking hits equal to\" to \"being hit for\". Similarly, under Knockdown, change \"Anyone who takes damage\" to \"Anyone who is hit for\".\n\nP. 131.

In the first paragraph after the diagram, the reference to \"flying\" skill should be to Piloting skill.\n\nP. 159. In the description of Destroy Water, delete \"(but see the next spell)\" from the last sentence. The Dehydrate spell does not follow in Basic, as it does in Magic.\n\nP. 167. The One-Skill Cost for Psi Sense should be 1.\n\nP. 175-176. We intended to change the Limitations rules in the sidebar to match those in GURPS Psionics. We didn't. If you have GURPS Psionics, follow it in case of discrepancies.\n\nP. 195. In the Loyalty Checks sidebar, Rescue needs to be changed. When a hireling is rescued, make a Reaction Roll (not a Loyalty Check). This roll should be at +3 or more, depending on the nature of the rescue. The hireling's loyalty is the result of the Reaction Roll, or his original loyalty, whichever is higher.\n\nP. 201. Under Ranged Attack Modifiers: Opportunity fire, the penalty for watching one hex is -2. The penalty for watching two hexes is still -4.\n\nP. 207. Replace the Spear Thrower entry in the weapons table with this one:\n\nWeaponTypeAmountRangesCostWeightMin ST\nSPEAR THROWER (DX-4 or Spear Throwing-4)\nAtlatl$202 lbs.\nw\/Dartimpsw-1111STx3STx4$201 lb.none\nw\/Javelinimpsw+1113STx2STx3$302 lbs.7\nw\/Spearimpsw+3122STx1.5STx2$404 lbs.9\n\nP. 245.

        "text":"From Crusader Kings II Wiki\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nPositions.txt is an important file in Map modding that stores all the data of locations of Map Objects in a province. These Map Objects include armies, councilors,cities and ports.\n\nWhen a map is first created from scratch and fails to load, Positions.txt is often one of the culprits. It is often advised to leave Positions.txt empty when creating a new map, since it will prevent the file from crashing the game. The problem with this solution is that it will center all Map Objects in the center of the province. It is advised to fill Positions.txt only when modders are done with Provinces.bmp\n\nThere are a few ways to fill Positions.txt:\n\n  \u2022 Manually filling Positions.txt by getting the data from an image editor.\n  \u2022 Using the in-game tool called Nudge\n\nManual editing[edit | edit source]\n\nWhen manually editing Positions.txt, the modder will be presented with a list of entries in the following format:\n\n#Name of province (optional)\nProvince number =\n\t\tX\u2081 Y\u2081  X\u2082 Y\u2082  X\u2083 Y\u2083  X\u2084 Y\u2084  X\u2085 Y\u2085\n\t\tR\u2081 R\u2082 R\u2083 R\u2084 R\u2085\n\t\tH\u2081 H\u2082 H\u2083 H\u2084 H\u2085\n  \u2022 The name of the province is a comment and is used only for ease of use. It has no in-game function.\n  \u2022 The province number is the number of the province as defined in definition.csv\n  \u2022 The values for the various objects are listed in three separate sections. (See the Map objects section below for a list of the objects.) All values are listed to three decimal places (e.g. 0 is listed as 0.000).\n    \u2022 Position is comprised of a list of X and Y coordinates for the various items, which are measured in pixels. They are measured from 0.000, with 0.000 0.000 being the bottom left corner of the map. The size of the map is determined by the pixel dimensions of provinces.bmp. As such, the position of an item is equivalent to the pixel it would occupy in provinces.bmp. Note however that Photoshop (and other image-editing software) treats the top-left as (0, 0).\n    \u2022 Rotation determines the rotation of an item. It is measured in radians, with 0.000 corresponding to due south. As such, due north is represented as \u03c0 radians, or 3.142. Generally, this is only used by ports, although it also affects cities and text.\n    \u2022 Height determines the height of an item relative to the height of the map. This is usually unnecessary but can sometimes be used to prevent items from clipping into surrounding terrain. By default, the county's label has a value of 20.000, while all other values are 0.000\n\nNudge[edit | edit source]\n\nNudge is an in-game tool that helps filling Positions.txt.\n\nNudge will work with your mod's positions.txt, but it will always save it over the positions.txt in your CK2 installation. Before using Nudge, back up the vanilla positions.txt, and after using Nudge, copy positions.txt from vanilla to your mod and copy the backup to the vanilla positions.txt.\n\nSetting up Nudge[edit | edit source]\n\nTo be able to access Nudge, browse to Documents\\Paradox Interactive\\Crusader Kings II\\YOUR MOD FOLDER\\Settings.txt. If you do not find a folder for your Mod, you have not told the game to make one in your Mod's Mod File or you have not run your Mod yet. In the first case editing the vanilla settings.txt instead will work.\n\nIn Settings.txt, find the line\n\n\nand change it to\n\n\nNow run your Mod. A Nudge button should now appear to the right of your normal Menu buttons.\n\nUsing Nudge[edit | edit source]\n\nNudge Interface\n\nTo bring up the Nudge interface, select a province. Nudge's interface is simple, but it will still be explained here.\n\n  \u2022 Map Objects: Located to the left of the interface, the selection boxes allow you to specify which Map Object you want to modify.\n  \u2022 Height: The three buttons in the middle-left allow you to change the height of the selected Map Object. The height can be reset by pressing the middle \"0\" button.\n  \u2022 Arrows: The four buttons in the middle-right allow you to change the location of the selected Map Object.\n  \u2022 Rotation: The four buttons to the right allow you to change the rotation of the selected Map Object. This is measured in degrees. The - and + rotate the object in 5 degree increments with the -- and ++ buttons rotate it in 45 degree increments. +\/++ rotate it clockwise while -\/-- rotate it anti-\/counter-clockwise. For ports, 0 represents due south.\n  \u2022 Save: This button saves Positions.txt to your Crusader Kings 2\\map folder. Remember to copy the new Positions.txt to your Mod's map folder.\n  \u2022 Check: This button applies a color to a province while not in terrain mapmode. The coloration is specific to each map object type (see below), and will be red if the object lies outside of the province; otherwise it will turn green. The coloration will also remain until the game is exited, allowing it to be used to remember which provinces have already been modified.\n  \u2022 Mapmode: This button changes Mapmode between a Terrain Mapmode and a Mapmode that displays checked provinces. As of at least patch 3.1.0, this button is non-fuctioning and crashes the game.\n\nTo start moving Map Objects around, right click on the location where you want to have the Map Object. After that you can make more accurate edits with the arrows, rotate the Map Object or modify the height of the Map Object. There is no interface to exit the game while using Nudge, so ALT + F4 must be used to exit the game.\n\nMap Objects[edit | edit source]\n\nThere are 7 Map Objects you can work with:\n\n  \u2022 Cities: Cities in CKII are the houses on the map. These houses surround a central building, such as a tower for baronies. Move this central building and the houses will move with it.\n  \u2022 Units: This is where the armies appear when they are raised or stationed in province. Armies cannot be rotated and should be placed in even ground, since their feet can clip in the ground when they are on uneven ground. Also note that when in combat more than one army is displayed on the map, and when in transit armies are displayed to the north west of their standing position, so it is advisable to place them away from borders and bodies of water where possible.\n  \u2022 Councillors: this is where the Councillors are placed in the province. Remember that if there is more than one councillor in a province, they will surround this location. As such, it should not be placed near borders or on an island (where possible). Councillors cannot be rotated and should be placed in even ground, since their feet can clip in the ground when they are on uneven ground.\nOn sea tiles, this coordinate determines where ships which are in transit to an adjacent tile will be displayed.\n  \u2022 Text: This is the name of the county which appears on the map. It is ill advised to edit the text, as it can break the text in other provinces. It doesn't affect text on the menu, but does have an effect in-game.\n  \u2022 Ports: Only coastal provinces can have ports. When the port is not visible, it is often located within\/underneath the land of the province and thus hidden from view. Right-clicking near the coast where you want it is one way to resolve this issue. Parts of the port can be located underwater, so be sure to rise it where necessary.\n  \u2022 Wonder: The location of a wonder that shows a non-coastal background in the interface.\n  \u2022 Coastal Wonder: The location of a wonder that shows a coastal background in the interface.\n\nAs they are not associated with any particular county\/province, other map objects such as the frame around the map and the wonders added in DLC 63 are not defined in positions.txt; they are instead treated as \"statics\", which are defined in text files within map\\statics\\ and use a different (but similar) system.",

        "text":"Vendetta Online Changelog\n\nNew in version 1.8.342\n\nJune 27th, 2015\n  \u2022 New station designs for Itan J11 and Odia M14.\n  \u2022 Six missions updated in the LAR Project tree, substantially improving issues with the Stygian Furies.\n  \u2022 The mission \"Rush job! Ores and minerals needed\" may now be re-taken (Xang Xi Research locations, Respect standing) to acquire the Xang-Xi Self Propelled Concussion Mine Launcher. Mission is available once per week, per character.\n  \u2022 Concussion Railgun grid power requirements dropped from 12 to 9, allowing dual-usage on the Raptor UDV, etc.\n  \u2022 Rendering optimizations for the new DX11 and GL4 engines. On some machines, that are more CPU-limited, these updates can make a big speed difference. More related improvements next week.\n\nNew in version 1.8.341 (June 22nd, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Added Video driver options to change the number of dynamic lights and toggle shadows in the DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4 drivers.\n  \u2022 Fixed a crash when switching from OpenGL 4 to the OpenGL Reference driver when multithreaded rendering is enabled and the glow effect is on.\n  \u2022 Border Skirmish Teradon firing distance has been lengthened and the average combat distance is shortened by 100 meters.\n  \u2022 Please rate the Android version! The Android version gives the choice to review the app when docking to a non-training station after 10 minutes of being online or after an in-app purchase. You can choose to have it ask again later (one week later) or never.\n  \u2022 We're nearing the DX11 and GL4 drivers becoming the production standard, so please continue to help us test them, and report any issues on the Bugs forum, or in a Support Ticket if privacy is needed.\n  \u2022 The new rendering-engine becoming \"production-ready\", as well as some other emerging features, will help mark a major update planned for the near future.\n\nNew in version 1.8.340 (June 13th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 New station design for Dau L10, more carefully integrating the Capship Hangar components. In the future, there will be more fully-customized stations replacing those with recently added capship hangars.\n  \u2022 Experimental: Fog and radar limitations now impact bot's targeting visibility and aggression. However, this may have undesirable secondary effects, and may require on-going tweaks and changes. Strikeforce NPCs have integrated radar extenders.\n  \u2022 Maximum rent-able cargo capacity of new capship-capable stations now increased to 100,000 cu. Existing cost thresholds for extended cargo space still apply.\n  \u2022 When a Trident pilot switches to a turret view, the local (Trident) ship is now properly visible.\n  \u2022 When launching from a Trident while it is mining, the ore is now properly placed into the Trident's cargo hold.\n  \u2022 Fixed a bug where a persistent Trident may collide with the player's copy during the change-over.\n\nNew in version 1.8.339 (June 8th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Fixed Deneb War Stats web page. The dates were off by one day under certain circumstances.\n  \u2022 Integrated Mineral Scanner on ships can now be used for the prospecting missions.\n  \u2022 Changed Conquerable station under attack warning timeout to 5 minutes from 1 hour and report each station separately.\n  \u2022 Improved Updater robustness when unable to write to storage.\n  \u2022 Added a larger mouse cursor for Retina and other high-res displays.\n  \u2022 All cargo nested within ships inside of capships will now drop when the capship explodes.\n  \u2022 NPCs can no longer turbo or jump\/warp out of a sector if their energy level is too low.\n  \u2022 Mac OS X Updater no longer crashes if there is no network connection.\n\nNew in version 1.8.337 (May 23rd, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Fixed issue with queens and its escorts getting reset to full health when the idle-sector timeout occurs.\n  \u2022 Idle-sector timeout experimentally reduced back down to 30 seconds, except for conquerable station sectors which retain their 5 minute timeout.\n  \u2022 Improved fallback resiliency of the game launcher\/updater under certain conditions, particularly on Android.\n  \u2022 Android version now includes a call to help translate the game, on non-English devices (\n  \u2022 Geo-located patch servers are now back into usage, including two in Europe. For best results, we recommend using your ISP's local nameserver, and *not* a global public provider like Google DNS or OpenDNS.\n\nNew in version 1.8.336 (May 18th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 New temporary placeholder \"capship\" stations in: Itan J11, Dau L10, Sol H13 and Odia M14. These will allow Trident owners to dock with these major capitols. The station configurations will be changing to something more customized to each sector (and nearby hazards, like asteroids), but for the moment they each have the same capship-hangar module, attached to the existing station.\n  \u2022 Idle-sector timeout experimentally reduced from 5 minutes to 30 seconds, to potentially reduce server ram usage in high-concurrency situations (very large numbers of players). As we have recently made mines, capships and other content persistent, this change should not have a significant gameplay impact. Note, this is simply the sector-shutdown that occurs after all players have already left a given location.\n  \u2022 Experimental \"emergency instancing\" added to all sectors: if a very large number of players should congregate in a single sector (many hundreds), additional players \"jumping in\" will be transparently sent to a secondary instance of the same sector, to better distribute load across the server cloud. This will only be an emergency-level tool to help deal with unexpected peak loads of huge numbers of new players (mobile-platform promotions, etc), and we'll be doing updated stress-testing to set it as high as possible. It can be dynamically defined on the server-side, to support very large future player-events, as needed.\n  \u2022 Fixes to server-side issues related to players getting stuck at \"entering universe\" during the login process.\n\nNew in version 1.8.336 (May 18th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 New temporary placeholder \"capship\" stations in: Itan J11, Dau L10, Sol H13 and Odia M14.

Once per character, per lifetime, submitted by Support Ticket. The character inventory will be WIPED (ships, items), but credits and stats will remain. Be sure to sell your character's inventory before requesting a Nation Change.\n  \u2022 We are in the process of moving to a much more robust and distributed patch-update architecture. However, the transition may continue to have some bumps as we discover and resolve issues. Please be patient with any connection delays.\n  \u2022 Updated the secure-HTTP connection functionality of the Android version, and added it to all other platforms and versions. Will help enable future game features.\n  \u2022 Training Sector Beam Cannon defenses have been significantly buffed, to reduce threats to newbies by more advanced player capships.\n  \u2022 Fixed issue with application full-screen interface on pre-4.4 Android devices.\n\nNew in version 1.8.334 (April 27th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Fixed turret leadoff indicator color when target is outside the field-of-view.\n  \u2022 Temperature Scanner now properly obeys its range limit.\n  \u2022 Added Retina support for the OpenGL 4 driver on OS X.\n  \u2022 Fixed touchscreen virtual keyboard issues when using plugins on Android.\n  \u2022 Fixed double-press issue when going into the Nav menu from the HUD on Android.\n  \u2022 Fixed issue with the Auto-Aim Advanced Game Setting being set to Disabled when touchscreen mode is disabled and a gamepapd is being used on Android.\n  \u2022 We're expecting some bigger changes next week, and we're approaching some major announcements. As a result, we've been spending time to build out and improve our server infrastructure:\n  \u2022 A new \"update server cloud\" will be launching next week, including new patch servers in Los Angeles and Europe. A combination of BGP Anycast and GeoIP DNS will make sure you receive the update server closest to your location, while careful monitoring and automated failover of the individual servers will minimize the impact of any outages (which are very unlikely anyway). Even if the entire new cloud should fail, the game update-client itself will fall back in a few seconds to our current, long-running Midwest-US service. As time goes on, you may see us expand our patch cloud into other locations, like Asia, Australia and Brazil.\n  \u2022 It should be noted that this new proprietary global patch network will not actually improve your \"ping times\" within the g...

        "text":"Update 15.1 - December 15, 2014\n\nFrom Lotro-Wiki.com\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nIndex to all release notes\n\nPatches(155 P)\n\nUpdate 15.1 Release Notes\n\nOf Important Note: Essence changes\n\nSome Essences available in Central Gondor were too powerful when equipped in multiples. Therefore, they have been made \"Unique Use\". You can only have one of any particular unique use essence equipped on your character at a time. In order to clean up the players who already have multiples of a unique use essence equipped, two changes have been made:\n\n  1. When a player logs in for the first time after Update 15.1, if they have more than one of a unique use essence socketed in all their equipment, any armor or jewelry with that essence will be unequipped and placed in their inventory (going to overflow if inventory is full). The player will also get chat notification telling them that this happened.\n  2. When a player tries to equip a piece of equipment, the game will check whether the item has multiples of a unique use essence. If so, the player will not be able to equip that armor or jewelry, and all instances of the duplicated unique use essence will be removed and placed into the player\u2019s inventory. (Going to overflow if inventory is full). Note: this will only happen as long as the player has no other item with a matching unique use essence already equipped.\n\n\n  \u2022 Players arriving by stable-master in Ethring should no longer get attacked when another player is in the quest In Ethring's Defence\n  \u2022 Ettenmoors guards which used to attack low-level scaled-up players have been given a talking-to\n  \u2022 Moved the default position of the \"Quest Actions Available\" button to be higher, so it no longer overlaps the quest tracker text.

For the main command in Java Edition 1.13 and Bedrock Edition, see Commands\/teleport.\n\nTeleports entities (players, mobs, items, etc.).\n\nThe primary difference between this command and the \/teleport command is that \/tp uses coordinates relative to the teleported targets, while \/teleport uses coordinates relative to the command's execution.\n\nAlthough most commands can only affect chunks that have already been generated, \/tp can send entities into chunks that have yet to be generated. If this happens to a player, then the chunks around and including that player's destination will be newly generated.\n\n\ntp <destination player>\ntp <x> <y> <z> [<yaw> <pitch>]\ntp <target player> <destination player>\ntp <target player> <x> <y> <z> [<yaw> <pitch>]\n\n\n<target player>\n\nSpecifies the entity(s) to be teleported. Must be a player name, a target selector, or a UUID.\nPermits entities other than players.\n\n<x> <y> <z> (BE: destination: x y z)\n\nSpecifies the coordinates to teleport the target(s) to. <x> and <z> must fall within the range -30,000,000 to 30,000,000 (exclusive, without the commas), and <y> must be within the range -4096 to 4096, inclusive. May use tilde and caret notation to specify a position relative to the target's current position \u2013 an exception to tilde notation's usual rule of being relative to the executor of the command. \/teleport can be used to teleport relative to executor of the command.\n\n<destination player>\n\nSpecifies the entity to teleport the target(s) to. Must be a player name, a target selector, or a UUID.\nPermits entity other than players.\n\n<yaw> and <pitch>\n\nSpecifies the rotation.\nFor the horizontal rotation (yaw), -180.0 for due north, -90.0 for due east, 0.0 for due south, 90.0 for due west, to 179.9 for just west of due north, before wrapping back around to -180.0.\nFor the vertical rotation (pitch), -90.0 for straight up to 90.0 for straight down.\nTilde notation can be used to specify a rotation relative to the target's previous rotation.\n\n\nFails if the arguments are not specified correctly, if <target player> fails to resolve to one or more entities (named players must be online), or if <destination player> fails to resolve to a single entity (a named player must be online). Fails individually for each entity referenced by <target player> that is not in the same dimension as the <destination player>, if specified.\n\nOn success, teleports the targets to the specified destination.\n\n\n  \u2022 To teleport yourself to Alice: tp Alice\n  \u2022 To teleport all players to yourself: tp @a @s\n  \u2022 To teleport yourself to x=100 and z=100, but three blocks above your current position: tp 100 ~3 100\n  \u2022 To rotate the nearest player 10 degrees to the right without changing their position: tp @p ~ ~ ~ ~10 ~\n\n\nJava Edition Classic\n0.0.18aAdded \/teleport.\nserver 1.7Added \/tp, an alias for \/teleport.\nJava Edition Indev\n0.31Removed all commands.\nJava Edition Alpha\nv1.0.16_01Re-added \/tp.\nJava Edition\n1.814w03aAdded rotation arguments to \/tp.\n1.9.3pre1\/tp no longer teleports the player to a y-coordinate outside the range -512 to 512.\n1.1016w21bThe y-coordinate range of \/tp is increased to \u22124096 to 4096.\nNow the specified destination is relative to executor of the command, instead of the target's current position.\npre1Behavior is reverted back to 16w20a and previous versions.\n1.1317w45a\/tp is no longer different from \/teleport now, and become an alias of \/teleport.",

They send a small UDP packet, and the server replies with a larger packet to the faked address. Multiply this by however fast you can stuff UDP packets into the server's incoming packet buffer per frame, times 7500+ public COD4 servers, and you can really bring a victim to its knees with a serious flood of unwanted packets.\n\nI've got a patch for COD4 for this, and I need admins to test it before I make an official release.\n\nYou'll need a server updated to 1.7 before applying this, because this is only a replacement cod4_lnxded file. The defaults for the new cvars are probably fine, but you can tweak them as you like.\n\nIf you want to see it in action, find your patched server in the in-game server browser, click \"Server Info\" and keep hitting refresh. If you're doing it faster than the limit, you'll see you don't get a response right away.\n\nAll this info is in README.linux in that tarball, but I'll post it here, too:\n\n\nAbout query limits:\n\nThere is a class of DDoS attack that can utilize COD4 servers to flood a third party, by spoofing UDP packets so that the game server sends its reply for information to an unsuspecting party, over and over, as fast as it can. Unlike most packets sent by the server, this reply packet does not require a player with a legitimate connection before sending.\n\nThis patch sets up some reasonable defaults to limit the rate at which the server will send these reply packets to a given IP address. It does not throttle legitimate connections in the process.\n\nThe gist is this: If someone sends a query packet, we note their IP address and ignore any further queries for X seconds. If they send a port-unreachable packet (person being spoofed isn't playing the game), we ignore their IP address for Y seconds. This will let normal people play, it prevents people that don't have a legitimate player connection from flooding the server with queries, and it'll stop DDoS attacks against third parties.\n\nIf millions of computers try to wail on a single server, this patch should handle it gracefully (we don't allocate memory when adding IP addresses to the ignore list, we use a hashtable so we don't have to check millions of IP addresses for every query, and we clean out old addresses a little each frame).\n\nPeople that are connected to the server don't have their packets ignored; this only limits server responses to packets that don't need a valid player connection (like the infostring, etc). LAN addresses are never limited.\n\nAdmins can tune it (and turn it off completely) with cvars.\n\nNote that a single IP address using different ports all get lumped into the same ignore list entry. This is to make life difficult for attackers and keep things efficient on the server. If 16 players are all behind the same NAT, they might notice it takes longer for the server to respond to each of them individually at the start. They should run a LAN server anyhow, but gameplay will still perform normally here.\n\nServer admins have 4 cvars to control this:\n\nsv_queryIgnoreDebug: set to 1 to log information about attacks. This will write out a lot of logging. Defaults to 0.\n\nsv_queryIgnoreMegs: Number of megabytes we should use to store the ignore list. Set to 0 to turn off the ignore list (basically disables this patch). 1 megabyte handles about 65000 IP addresses, each megabyte after the first adds about 87000 more. 1 is probably fine unless you're under serious attack, but maybe a server wants to spare 12 megs to block a million IP addresses simultaneously. Defaults to 1.\n\nsv_queryIgnoreTime: Number of milliseconds to ignore an IP address's info requests after responding to one of them. Set to 0 to not ignore at all. Defaults to 2000 (2 seconds).\n\nsv_queryBounceIgnoreTime: Number of milliseconds to ignore an IP address's info requests after a server packet bounced with an ICMP Port Unreachable notice. Set to 0 to not ignore at all. Defaults to 12000 (2 _minutes_).\n\n\nPlease note that I haven't touched this code since 2008, so even though the changes are relatively localized, don't blast this out to all your servers until you feel it's stable.\n\nPlease give me feedback!\n\n\nFirewall solution\n\n$IPT -A INPUT -p UDP -m length --length 42 -m recent --set --name getstatus_cod\n$IPT -A INPUT -p UDP -m string --algo bm --string \"getstatus\" -m recent --update --seconds 1 --hitcount 20 --name getstatus_cod -j DROP\n\nWould you like to support this Wiki?
