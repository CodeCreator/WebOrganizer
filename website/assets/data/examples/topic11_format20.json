        "text":"Bestiary\u00a0>(Bestiary) By Type\u00a0>Templates\u00a0>\n\nBleeding Horror (CR +3)\n\nCreatures with this Template\n\nCreated by the axe of blood, these foul creatures drip with the blood they were so willing to sacrifice to the hungry blade. Though undead, bleeding horrors are not intrinsically evil and retain the alignment they had in life. They are, however, filled with the unquenchable desire for blood to feed the weapon that created them. Bleeding horrors appear as skeletons or sunken corpses covered in and continuously dripping thick red blood. Their eyes glow with a desire for blood. They may wear armor and wield weapons.\n\nCreating a Bleeding Horror\n\n\u201cBleeding Horror\u201d is an acquired template that can be added to humanoid, monstrous humanoid, magical beast, or outsider (referred to hereafter as the base creature) that dies as a result of feeding the axe of blood. A bleeding horror retains all the base creature\u2019s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.\n\nCR: Same as the base creature +3.\n\nSize and Type: The creature\u2019s type changes to undead and it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.\n\nAC: The base creature\u2019s natural armor bonus improves by +5. Additionally, a bleeding horror has a +2 deflection bonus to AC due to the slippery and bloody nature of its body.\n\nHit Dice: Increase all current and future racial Hit Dice to d8s. As undead, a bleeding horror uses its Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).\n\nDefensive Abilities: A bleeding horror has all the defensive abilities of the base creature, and gains the following:\n\nChannel Resistance: Bleeding horrors gain a +4 bonus to channel resistance.\n\nSpell Resistance: Bleeding horrors gain spell resistance equal to 11 + CR.\n\nDamage Reduction: A bleeding horror has damage reduction based on its Hit Dice: those with 5 or less HD, damage reduction 5\/magic; 6\u201310 HD, damage reduction 10\/magic; 11 or more HD, damage reduction 15\/magic.\n\nAttacks: A bleeding horror retains all the attacks of the base creature and gains 2 claw attacks if it did not already have them. The base creature retains the ability to use weapons (including natural weapons). A bleeding horror fighting without weapons uses either its claw attack or primary natural weapon (if it has any). A bleeding horror armed with a weapon uses its claw or a weapon, as it desires. These claw attacks, and all other natural attacks possessed by the base creature, use the damage value in the table below or its own damage value, whichever is better.\n\nSize Damage\nFine 1\nDiminutive 1d2\nTiny 1d3\nSmall 1d4\nMedium 1d6\nLarge 1d8\nHuge 2d6\nGargantuan 2d8\nColossal 4d6\n\nSpecial Attacks: The bleeding horror retains all the special attacks of the base form and gains the following: Saves have a DC of 10 + 1\/2 bleeding horror\u2019s HD + bleeding horror\u2019s Cha modifier unless noted otherwise.\n\nBloodstorm (Sp)\n\nBleeding horrors can cast bloodstorm up to three times per day as an 8th\u2013level cleric.\n\nBlood Consumption (Su)\n\nWhen a bleeding horror successfully hits a living opponent with a claw attack, it heals a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. However, it can\u2019t gain more than the subject\u2019s Bleeding Horror current hit points + the subject\u2019s Constitution score, which is enough to kill the subject. A bleeding horror can\u2019t gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its Hit Dice. For example, a 12-HD bleeding horror may not have more than 144 hit points.\n\nIf a bleeding horror hits an opponent with both claw attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 1d4+2 points of Constitution damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. For each point of Constitution damage dealt, a bleeding horror gains 5 temporary hit points.\n\nCreate Spawn (Ex)\n\nAny creature slain by the blood consumption attack of a bleeding horror becomes a bleeding horror in 1d4 minutes under the command of its creator.\n\nFind Target (Sp)\n\nIf the axe of blood is taken from a bleeding horror before the creature is destroyed, it can find it unerringly, as though guided by discern location.\n\nHorrific Appearance (Su)\n\nA living creature within 60 feet that views a bleeding horror must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage. This damage cannot reduce a victim\u2019s Strength below 0, but anyone reduced to Strength 0 is helpless. Creatures affected by this power or those that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same bleeding horror\u2019s horrific appearance for one day.\n\nAbilities: Cha +8. Being undead, a bleeding horror has no Constitution score.\n\nFeats: A bleeding horror keeps original feats and gains Toughness as a bonus feat.\n\nSection 15: Copyright Notice \u2013 Tome of Horrors Complete\nBleeding Horror from the Tome of Horrors Complete, Copyright 2011, Necromancer Games, Inc., published and distributed by Frog God Games; Authors Clark Peterson and Scott Greene.",

        "text":"U.S. Army Infantry Squad Organization\n\nFrom AAManual\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe mission of the Infantry is to close with the enemy by means of fire and maneuver to defeat or capture him, or to repel his assault by fire, close combat, and counterattack. In America\u2019s Army 3, you begin your career as a Soldier in a standard Infantry squad. A U.S. Army Infantry squad consists of 9-13 Soldiers led by a Staff Sergeant. Each squad is composed of 2 or more Fire Teams. Each Fire Teams consists of four men, led by a sergeant. A Fire Teams is comprised of 2 Riflemen, one being the Team Leader, a Grenadier, and an Automatic Rifleman. Sometimes a squad can be enhanced with Advanced Marksmen depending on the mission requirements.\n\nSquad Positions\n\nSquad Leader\nThe Squad Leader is in command of the squad and issues orders to the Fire Team Leaders. The Squad Leader is armed with either the M4 MWS or the M16A4, as well as an assortment of grenades. During the Battle Planning Phase before each round the Squad Leader has access to the Battle Planner and can lay down simple orders for his Fire Teams to execute. Although the Squad Leader is in command, he is a rifleman first and leads by example. The Squad Leader is designated with a Star Icon in the Role Selection Screen and is playable immediately upon creating a account.\n\nFire Team Leader\nA Fire Team Leader commands one of the 4-man Fire Teams in the squad (Fire Team Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta). He executes and disseminates the orders of the Squad Leader. A Fire Team Leader is armed with an M16A4 or an M4 MWS, as well as an assortment of grenades and is responsible for performing all the duties that are expected of the men in his fire team. The Fire Team Leader role is available immediately upon creating an account and is marked in the role selection screen with the Letter Designation of his Fire Team (A, B, C, D).\n\nThe Rifleman is the backbone of the US Army Infantry. Riflemen are disciplined, courageous, have extremely high morale, and they absolutely do-not-quit. The most versatile element of a Fire Team, the rifleman is equipped with either an M16A4 or M4 MWS and variety of hand grenades. The duties of a Rifleman include, executing the orders of his Fire Team and Squad Leaders, maneuvering and providing cover fire with his element, and completing his mission at whatever cost. The Rifleman role is available immediately upon creating an account and is designated in the Role Selection screen with the Single Round Icon.\n\nAutomatic Rifleman\nArmed with the M249 SAWS (Squad Automatic Weapon System), the Automatic Rifleman combines devastating firepower with quick maneuverability. The Automatic Rifleman is essential in providing overwhelming volumes of suppressive fire from medium to long range. No Fire Team is complete without the Automatic Rifleman.\n\nThe Automatic Rifleman provides a Fire Team with a belt-fed light machine gun. The M249's high rate of fire, and large ammunition capacity gives a Squad\/Fire Team a weapon that maintains a consistent rate of fire to provide cover for an advancing unit. However, this weapon has its drawbacks, particularly weight. Due to this, the Automatic Rifleman is the slowest among the classes available. To unlock the Automatic Rifleman class you must achieve a \"Basic\" score on the M249 portion of Weapons Familiarization. Automatic Riflemen are designated with the 3-Round Icon on the Class Selection menu.\n\nThe Grenadier is a key member of the U.S. Army Fire Team. Armed with an M16A4 and M320 grenade launcher, the Grenadier can deliver 40mm smoke and explosive rounds at point and area targets from medium to long distances. Although capable of providing support fire for the Squad\/Fire Team, the Grenadier is a rifleman first and is expected to perform all the duties of a rifleman. In most missions each Fire Team is assigned one Grenadier. To play as the Grenadier you must pass the M320 portion of Weapons Familiarization with a \"Basic\" Score. The Grenadier class is marked with a grenade icon on the Role Selection screen.\n\nSquad Designated Marksman\nThe SDM or Squad Designated Marksman supports the squad by laying down accurate rapid fire at distances beyond the normal engagement range of the Squad's Rifleman. The average Rifleman is trained to engage targets up to 300 meters away. A sniper engages targets beyond 600m while the SDM is trained to engage targets in \"No Man's Land,\" the area between the capabilities of the two. Although the SDM receives much of the same training, he is not a sniper. The SDM is a rifleman and deploys as a member of a Squad. He maneuvers and engages with his Squad and never operates alone. To qualify to become a Squad Designated Marksman, you must score at least 36 or higher during Basic Rifle Marksmanship training. You can identify the SDM in the Role Selection Screen by the crosshair icon.\n\n\nPersonal tools",

        "text":"Tuesday, February 10, 2009\n\n\nThe metaskills presented here are a means by which Silhouette games can become more cinematic and characters more powerful. They represent special maneuvers, outstanding skill, a great deal of luck, practice and instinct, as well as power. These skills are all effects-based. That is, the maneuvers that can be attempted with them do not represent specifics. Instead, the skill represents the effects of a maneuver in combat. The specifics of each maneuver and how it is carried out are left to the imaginations of players and GM.\n\nThese skills make their practitioners particularly powerful. This is intended. We recommend that PCs in possession of any one of these skills be challenged and harrassed even moreso than normal.\n\nEach metaskill is rolled before the normal skill roll. For example, in order to carry out a Combo in Heavy Gear Dueling, the Duelist would roll an opposed Heavy Gear Dueling skill roll. If the MOS of the roll was 2 or more, the Combo is activated, and the Duelist then rolls attacks as per normal (Gunnery\/Piloting vs. Piloting Opposed roll). Only one metaskill maneuver can be carried out per round, no exceptions. This overrides the Advanced Controls Heavy Gear perk rule as it applies to Heavy Gear Dueling.\n\nMechanics and specifics:\n\nEach of these skills are considered Complex for the purposes of skill purchase and advancement. The metaskills cannot be learned in-game without the benefit of a teacher. Each skill has a collection of sub-maneuvers that are governed by different attributes. However, all four metaskills are governed by the CRE attribute for the purposes of skill advancement. Specializations can only be purchased for each sub-maneuver of the metaskill in question.\n\nWhen are these skills usable?\n\nHeavy Gear Dueling:\nAll Opposed Dueling macromoves are only possible at close combat ranges or within the short range band of the weapon(s) being used.\nNon-Opposed Dueling Macromoves may be attempted at any time, regardless of target presence. The sole exception for this is Duelist's Luck, which cannot be used to re-roll an attack roll beyond Short Range.\n\nOffensive Gunslinging maneuvers may only be employed with Pistol type weapons, usually in single-fire mode only. The Sniping metaskill is not compatible with Gunslinging. Gunslinging may be attempted at all ranges, not just short or point-blank. The Gunslinger's Gambit (Zen Reroll) maneuver can affect the Gunslinger's own attacks, or be used defensively against firearms attacks from opponents provided the Gunslinger's pistols are drawn, or about to be (hands on grips).\n\nIn order to activate Sniping Maneuvers, the user must be stationary, employing single fire, and firing a rifle-ammunition weapon. This includes the \"Lucky of the Devil\" ability, which cannot be used to re-roll Camouflage or Stealth thresholds in a non-sniping context.\n\nMartial Arts:\nThis metaskill can only be used in close combat, that is, any attack\/defense roll that would employ Melee or Hand to Hand combat. As well, certain Martial Arts maneuvers can be used in conjunction with the Archery skill and Thrown Weapon skill (for martial arts thrown weapons like knives and shuriken). The Zen Mastery Maneuver may be used to evade bullets from firearms so long as the shooter is less than 10 meters from the martial artist.\n\n\nHermes 72 - Heavy Gear RPG - Most artwork Copyright 2002 Dream Pod 9, Inc.",

Length of the beam in meters.\nDam - Damage per second of contact.\nPen - Penetration (to use against target armour)\nHeat - Heat generated per second of use.\nRecharge - Recharge time to fully recharge beam after complete discharge (ie. 0 power left)\nBeams Range Pen Dam Heat Recharge (secs)\nComm Laser 2500 20 300 10 12 \u00a0\nMining Laser 1500 55 1000 100 12 \u00a0\nCutting Beam 2500 60 1500 100 10 \u00a0\nAM Beam 3000 70 4000 250 7.2 Antimatter based\nNote 1:\nAny fully charged beam weapon can sustain 6 seconds of continuous operation.\n\nNote 2:\nBeam weapons fire straight ahead (toward your cockpit center, not the HUD center), targetting cannot be used for these.\n\nNote on Tactical Resource Interface (TRI) for beam weapons:\nEnergy allocation through the TRI does not affect range or recharge time but still impact damages (-\/+50%).\n\nCannon Legend\nPen - Penetration (to use against target armour)\nDam : Maximum Damage.\nRefire : Refire delay between shots (lower with weapon link on chain mode) in seconds.\nArcs : Firing arcs in degrees\nHeat : Heat generated by each shot\nRange : Max range (not much damage left)\nHalf Rng : see note below\n\n\nNotes on Tactical Resource Interface (TRI)\nUse of TRI energy allocation modifies Base damage (+\/- 50%), Max range (+\/- 50%), rate of fire (+\/- 25%) [Slug Throwers and Energy Cannons] and recharge rate [Energy Cannons only].\n\nNote on half_range usage:\nHalf_range is used to computed the loss of energy of a projectile (both for Energy Cannons and Slug Throwers) across distance, It works in 3 parts:\n- Anywhere inside the first segment (0 to half_range) the weapon does full damages.\n- Then the decrease is linear for intermediate segments.\n- The last segment is also linear but the 0 damage value correspond to the weapon's maximum range.\n\nThe formulas to use are (when referring to Base damage, it stands for the weapon damage eventually modified by TRI allocation):\n\nFirst segment (from 0 to first half_range increment):\nBase damage value applied anywhere in the segment.\n\nIntermediate segments (ie. not the first, nor the last):\nDamage = (Base_damage \/ 2^(seg_number - 2)) * half_range \/ (Distance - (half_range * (seg_number - 2))\n\nLast segment (from highest range increment multiple lesser than max range to Max weapon range):\nDamage = (Base_damage \/ 2^(seg_number - 2)) * (Max_range - Distance) \/ (Max_range - (half_range * (seg_number - 1))\n\n\nFor a standard PBC, the first segment is between 0 and 2100 meters, full damages (160 #in this case) are applied all across this segment.\n\nSecond segment is between 2100 m and 4200 m, damage at lower limit (2100m) is 160, #damage at upper limit (4200 m) is half the value at the lower limit, so it's 80. Between #these two limits the damage value decrease linearly across distance. So damages at 3000 #m (inside 2nd segment) would be:\n\nDamage = (160 \/ 2^(2 - 2)) * 2100 \/ (3000 - (2100 * (2-2))\nDamage = 160 * 2100 \/ 3000\nDamage = 112\n\nStill using our trusty PBC at a range of 5000 m, in the 3rd segment, it gives:\n\nDamage = (160 \/ 2) * 2100 \/ (5000 - 2100)\n<=> Damage = 80 * 2100 \/ 2900\n<=> Damage = 57.93\n\nUsing the PBC at long range (say 9000 m, fifth and last segment) will give the #following calculation:\n\nDamage = (160 \/ 8) * (9600 - 9000) \/ (9600 - (2100 * 4))\n<=> Damage = 20 * 600 \/ 1200\n<=> Damage = 10\n\nCannons using ammo (Gatling and Longbow Sniper) apparently benefit\/suffer from TRI setting, even though they logically should not.\n\nNote on Assault and Gatling Cannons:\nThese weapons are essentially the same, the only difference is that the Assault Cannon mounts a dedicated energy ring (which explain why it uses one internal cargo space and has a slightly lower rate of fire) to provide energy instead of using ammunitions.\n\nNote on Longbow Sniper Cannon:\nThe Longbow Cannon was especially designed for long range use and is recoiless to provide better aim, it can use the sniper zoom function to give long range subcomponent targetting (same as Imaging module) and since it's a Meson based weapon it bypass conventional LDA shields.\nAddendum: Despite the Longbow's range of 53.55 km when maximizing energy to weapon through TRI allocation, due to targetting sensors limitations the maximum range a target lock can be achieved is 50km (same as maximum REM link range).\n\nNote on weapon penetration and target armour effect on damages:\n\nHere is a formula to compute the effect of armour on the damage caused\/dealt by a weapon.\n\n[*] Armour Modifier = (Target Armour - Weapon Penetration) \/ 100\n[*] If Armour Modifier is negative damages are unchanged.\n[*] If Armour Modifier is positive, you can compute the Damage Modifier by multiply the calculated weapon damage by the Armour Modifier (do not round the result up or down, keep the exact number).\nDamage Modifiers = Calculated Damage * Armour Modifier\n[*] You then substract the Damage Modifiers to the Calculated Damage to get Final Damage.\nFinal Damage = Calculated Damage - Damage Modifiers\n\nThe target hit points, after applying the Final Damage, should be rounded down if the hit points are above 50% of its max hit points and rounded up if they are equal or under 50%.\n\nYou're shooting a cargo pod (armour 50) with a light PBC (penetration 35) at point blank range the Armour Modifier is:\nAM = (50 - 35) \/ 100 = 0.25\n\nSince you're shooting at point blank range, damage done by a light PBC is 130,the Damage Modifier is:\nDM = 130 * 0.25 = 32.5\nFD = 130 - 32.5 = 97.5\n\nIf the pod still has 1000 hit points before you shoot it, it goes down to 902 (1000 - 97.5 = 902.5, 902 rounded down since a cargo pod max hit points is 1000).\n\nIf the pod had 510 hit points before you shoot it, it goes down to 413 (510 - 97.5 = 412.5, 413 rounded up since the hit points left is less than 50% of max hit points).\n\nNote on TRI settings:\n* When talking about High\/Max TRI setting if mean that it gives max power to weapons.\n* Balanced TRI setting is the TRI equalizing the power distribution to Propulsion, Shields and Weapons\n* Low\/Min TRI setting is Max power to either shield or propulsion.\n\nNote on ammunition usage:\nAmmunitions is kept track of using to things, the number of pods that are full and the exact remaining ammo count in an uncomplete pod (current pod) for this type of ammunition (the uncomplete pod is showed as a complete one in the inventory screen).\n\nWhen you use ammunitions in combat the exact number of units fired is substracted from the uncomplete pod, when the pod's content is depleted the number of full pods is decreased by one and the leftover number of shots fired is substracted from the max units number contained in a full pod to give the number to use for the current pod.\n\n\nA table to summarize weapon damages at each half-life value for low\/balanced\/high TRI setting.\n\nFor damage reference, a cargo pods has 1000 hit points.\n\nfor the first segment the damage value does not decrease, full base damage for the weapon is applied from 0 to the first half-range value.\n\nfor other segments, damage value decrease linearly (see formulas for details).\n\nEntries can be read like this (all range are expressed in meters):\n\n  \u2022 x. name of weapons concerned (base damage with balanced TRI, max range with balanced TRI, half-life value)\n  \u2022 Range values define segment the last digit of the range correspond to the end of the segment.\n  \u2022 Damage values indicated the damages done at the end of the segment they're included in to have an exact damage value for a specific range refer...

For the main command in Java Edition 1.13 and Bedrock Edition, see Commands\/teleport.\n\nTeleports entities (players, mobs, items, etc.).\n\nThe primary difference between this command and the \/teleport command is that \/tp uses coordinates relative to the teleported targets, while \/teleport uses coordinates relative to the command's execution.\n\nAlthough most commands can only affect chunks that have already been generated, \/tp can send entities into chunks that have yet to be generated. If this happens to a player, then the chunks around and including that player's destination will be newly generated.\n\n\ntp <destination player>\ntp <x> <y> <z> [<yaw> <pitch>]\ntp <target player> <destination player>\ntp <target player> <x> <y> <z> [<yaw> <pitch>]\n\n\n<target player>\n\nSpecifies the entity(s) to be teleported.

May use tilde and caret notation to specify a position relative to the target's current position \u2013 an exception to tilde notation's usual rule of being relative to the executor of the command. \/teleport can be used to teleport relative to executor of the command.\n\n<destination player>\n\nSpecifies the entity to teleport the target(s) to. Must be a player name, a target selector, or a UUID.\nPermits entity other than players.\n\n<yaw> and <pitch>\n\nSpecifies the rotation.\nFor the horizontal rotation (yaw), -180.0 for due north, -90.0 for due east, 0.0 for due south, 90.0 for due west, to 179.9 for just west of due north, before wrapping back around to -180.0.\nFor the vertical rotation (pitch), -90.0 for straight up to 90.0 for straight down.\nTilde notation can be used to specify a rotation relative to the target's previous rotation.\n\n\nFails if the arguments are not specified correctly, if <target player> fails to resolve to one or more entities (named players must be online), or if <destination player> fails to resolve to a single entity (a named player must be online). Fails individually for each entity referenced by <target player> that is not in the same dimension as the <destination player>, if specified.\n\nOn success, teleports the targets to the specified destination.\n\n\n  \u2022 To teleport yourself to Alice: tp Alice\n  \u2022 To teleport all players to yourself: tp @a @s\n  \u2022 To teleport yourself to x=100 and z=100, but three blocks above your current position: tp 100 ~3 100\n  \u2022 To rotate the nearest player 10 degrees to the right without changing their position: tp @p ~ ~ ~ ~10 ~\n\n\nJava Edition Classic\n0.0.18aAdded \/teleport.\nserver 1.7Added \/tp, an alias for \/teleport.\nJava Edition Indev\n0.31Removed all commands.\nJava Edition Alpha\nv1.0.16_01Re-added \/tp.\nJava Edition\n1.814w03aAdded rotation arguments to \/tp.\n1.9.3pre1\/tp no longer teleports the player to a y-coordinate outside the range -512 to 512.\n1.1016w21bThe y-coordinate range of \/tp is increased to \u22124096 to 4096.\nNow the specified destination is relative to executor of the command, instead of the target's current position.\npre1Behavior is reverted back to 16w20a and previous versions.\n1.1317w45a\/tp is no longer different from \/teleport now, and become an alias of \/teleport.",

Ores and minerals needed\" may now be re-taken (Xang Xi Research locations, Respect standing) to acquire the Xang-Xi Self Propelled Concussion Mine Launcher. Mission is available once per week, per character.\n  \u2022 Concussion Railgun grid power requirements dropped from 12 to 9, allowing dual-usage on the Raptor UDV, etc.\n  \u2022 Rendering optimizations for the new DX11 and GL4 engines. On some machines, that are more CPU-limited, these updates can make a big speed difference. More related improvements next week.\n\nNew in version 1.8.341 (June 22nd, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Added Video driver options to change the number of dynamic lights and toggle shadows in the DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4 drivers.\n  \u2022 Fixed a crash when switching from OpenGL 4 to the OpenGL Reference driver when multithreaded rendering is enabled and the glow effect is on.\n  \u2022 Border Skirmish Teradon firing distance has been lengthened and the average combat distance is shortened by 100 meters.\n  \u2022 Please rate the Android version! The Android version gives the choice to review the app when docking to a non-training station after 10 minutes of being online or after an in-app purchase. You can choose to have it ask again later (one week later) or never.\n  \u2022 We're nearing the DX11 and GL4 drivers becoming the production standard, so please continue to help us test them, and report any issues on the Bugs forum, or in a Support Ticket if privacy is needed.\n  \u2022 The new rendering-engine becoming \"production-ready\", as well as some other emerging features, will help mark a major update planned for the near future.\n\nNew in version 1.8.340 (June 13th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 New station design for Dau L10, more carefully integrating the Capship Hangar components. In the future, there will be more fully-customized stations replacing those with recently added capship hangars.\n  \u2022 Experimental: Fog and radar limitations now impact bot's targeting visibility and aggression. However, this may have undesirable secondary effects, and may require on-going tweaks and changes. Strikeforce NPCs have integrated radar extenders.\n  \u2022 Maximum rent-able cargo capacity of new capship-capable stations now increased to 100,000 cu. Existing cost thresholds for extended cargo space still apply.\n  \u2022 When a Trident pilot switches to a turret view, the local (Trident) ship is now properly visible.\n  \u2022 When launching from a Trident while it is mining, the ore is now properly placed into the Trident's cargo hold.\n  \u2022 Fixed a bug where a persistent Trident may collide with the player's copy during the change-over.\n\nNew in version 1.8.339 (June 8th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Fixed Deneb War Stats web page. The dates were off by one day under certain circumstances.\n  \u2022 Integrated Mineral Scanner on ships can now be used for the prospecting missions.\n  \u2022 Changed Conquerable station under attack warning timeout to 5 minutes from 1 hour and report each station separately.\n  \u2022 Improved Updater robustness when unable to write to storage.\n  \u2022 Added a larger mouse cursor for Retina and other high-res displays.\n  \u2022 All cargo nested within ships inside of capships will now drop when the capship explodes.\n  \u2022 NPCs can no longer turbo or jump\/warp out of a sector if their energy level is too low.\n  \u2022 Mac OS X Updater no longer crashes if there is no network connection.\n\nNew in version 1.8.337 (May 23rd, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Fixed issue with queens and its escorts getting reset to full health when the idle-sector timeout occurs.\n  \u2022 Idle-sector timeout experimentally reduced back down to 30 seconds, except for conquerable station sectors which retain their 5 minute timeout.\n  \u2022 Improved fallback resiliency of the game launcher\/updater under certain conditions, particularly on Android.\n  \u2022 Android version now includes a call to help translate the game, on non-English devices (\n  \u2022 Geo-located patch servers are now back into usage, including two in Europe. For best results, we recommend using your ISP's local nameserver, and *not* a global public provider like Google DNS or OpenDNS.\n\nNew in version 1.8.336 (May 18th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 New temporary placeholder \"capship\" stations in: Itan J11, Dau L10, Sol H13 and Odia M14. These will allow Trident owners to dock with these major capitols. The station configurations will be changing to something more customized to each sector (and nearby hazards, like asteroids), but for the moment they each have the same capship-hangar module, attached to the existing station.\n  \u2022 Idle-sector timeout experimentally reduced from 5 minutes to 30 seconds, to potentially reduce server ram usage in high-concurrency situations (very large numbers of players). As we have recently made mines, capships and other content persistent, this change should not have a significant gameplay impact. Note, this is simply the sector-shutdown that occurs after all players have already left a given location.\n  \u2022 Experimental \"emergency instancing\" added to all sectors: if a very large number of players should congregate in a single sector (many hundreds), additional players \"jumping in\" will be transparently sent to a secondary instance of the same sector, to better distribute load across the server cloud. This will only be an emergency-level tool to help deal with unexpected peak loads of huge numbers of new players (mobile-platform promotions, etc), and we'll be doing updated stress-testing to set it as high as possible. It can be dynamically defined on the server-side, to support very large future player-events, as needed.\n  \u2022 Fixes to server-side issues related to players getting stuck at \"entering universe\" during the login process.\n\nNew in version 1.8.336 (May 18th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 New temporary placeholder \"capship\" stations in: Itan J11, Dau L10, Sol H13 and Odia M14.

Once per character, per lifetime, submitted by Support Ticket. The character inventory will be WIPED (ships, items), but credits and stats will remain. Be sure to sell your character's inventory before requesting a Nation Change.\n  \u2022 We are in the process of moving to a much more robust and distributed patch-update architecture. However, the transition may continue to have some bumps as we discover and resolve issues. Please be patient with any connection delays.\n  \u2022 Updated the secure-HTTP connection functionality of the Android version, and added it to all other platforms and versions. Will help enable future game features.\n  \u2022 Training Sector Beam Cannon defenses have been significantly buffed, to reduce threats to newbies by more advanced player capships.\n  \u2022 Fixed issue with application full-screen interface on pre-4.4 Android devices.\n\nNew in version 1.8.334 (April 27th, 2015)\n\n  \u2022 Fixed turret leadoff indicator color when target is outside the field-of-view.\n  \u2022 Temperature Scanner now properly obeys its range limit.\n  \u2022 Added Retina support for the OpenGL 4 driver on OS X.\n  \u2022 Fixed touchscreen virtual keyboard issues when using plugins on Android.\n  \u2022 Fixed double-press issue when going into the Nav menu from the HUD on Android.\n  \u2022 Fixed issue with the Auto-Aim Advanced Game Setting being set to Disabled when touchscreen mode is disabled and a gamepapd is being used on Android.\n  \u2022 We're expecting some bigger changes next week, and we're approaching some major announcements. As a result, we've been spending time to build out and improve our server infrastructure:\n  \u2022 A new \"update server cloud\" will be launching next week, including new patch servers in Los Angeles and Europe. A combination of BGP Anycast and GeoIP DNS will make sure you receive the update server closest to your location, while careful monitoring and automated failover of the individual servers will minimize the impact of any outages (which are very unlikely anyway). Even if the entire new cloud should fail, the game update-client itself will fall back in a few seconds to our current, long-running Midwest-US service. As time goes on, you may see us expand our patch cloud into other locations, like Asia, Australia and Brazil.\n  \u2022 It should be noted that this new proprietary global patch network will not actually improve your \"ping times\" within the g...

        "text":"The Forest Wiki\n\nReleased September 8th, 2017.\n\nDev Notes[]\n\nHey Everyone,\n\nThis patch includes an almost total redesign of the survival book. We\u2019ve added color bands across sections to make it easier to know which section you are currently in, and also matched the hover over buttons to use this same color. Along with this the stats page has been redesigned, it should now be both easier to read and give more context to how stats relate to the HUD elements.\n\nA similar re-work was done across the HUD itself. We\u2019ve kept the same basic ideas everyone is familiar with but cleaned up the look visually, with subtle gradients added to make the bars easier to understand, and cleaned up shapes that retain the same basic ideas whilst looking visually cleaner.\n\nThe build\/item tracker has been reworked to feel less jarring. Items now smoothly animate in and out instead of popping visually. We wanted to make this feel like a mental checklist players are thinking of, and so have added a strike out line as each item has its requirements filled, as if you\u2019re striking them off a list.\n\nWe\u2019ve changed a bunch of stuff with how collision works, and how mouse movement feels. We also added some new mouse smoothing options giving players the ability to alter this to how they prefer or turn it off completely. Along with this there has been a re-work of the cave collision making it more accurate to the 3d rendered geometry, and also how multiplayer collision works \u2013 previously clients would rely on hosts collision for ragdolls and a.i. meaning dropped bodies for clients could fall through rocks unless client was very close to host.\n\nAlong with the collision changes, we added new head shot damage to enemies. A good projectile shot to the head of a humanoid enemy will now do much more damage than a body shot.\n\nAnimal A.I. was improved, We made deer run further and longer from players instead of forgetting instantly they were almost just killed. We also fixed some long standing issues with animals getting stuck on walls, and some animals not catching on fire when they should. To make being killed by either a crocodile or shark clearer, we now animate the player spinning around to show what just killed them.\n\nIt is now possible to add logs to ziplines, which should make this a useful way to transport logs across long distances. This is a first pass, we\u2019re planning a lot more polish on this especially in multiplayer.\n\nYou can now collect mushrooms using your pouch, and even plant them in gardens you build in caves. Poison mushrooms can now be used similar to poison berries in inventory.\n\nWe did a pass on water collection, now pot will be properly held and also animate to scoop water up, it should also look better when placed on a fire.\n\nWe added a new ability to turtle shells, you can now use these as makeshift sleds. This system works most effectively in the snow, and can be used as a way to make a quick exit if surrounded by enemies.\n\nAlong with this we added some new cannibal village props, fixed some issues with loading games with an insane amount of buildings in 64 bit (over 10,000 structures!) Started in on some slow enemy CPU optimizations, balanced chainsaw weapon, improved how previous weapon selection works, improved hud performance, Improved the hole cutter to allow it to remove more items including paths and some decorations, and also prepared project for a switch to a newer unity version (which didn\u2019t make it into this patch) and more.\n\nIf you are running a dedicated server, you will need to restart your server with the latest version to be compatible with this patch release.\n\nAs always, please continue to post your bug reports and feedback in the Discussions area of the Community Hub.\n\nAdditions, Changes, & Fixes[]\n\n  \u2022 Fixed Sea Turtles sometimes being blocked by walls\n  \u2022 Sea turtles will now be set alight if passing through a fire\n  \u2022 Higher resolution textures on turtle shell\n  \u2022 Hitting enemies with repair tool should no longer make them bloodied\n  \u2022 Fixed very large save games sometimes crashing on load on 64 bit systems\n  \u2022 Optimized cpu usage of all enemy ai routines\n  \u2022 Better collision on some cannibal village props\n  \u2022 Added new large bloody tables and broken bloody table variations\n  \u2022 Deer now run away from player more after being attacked\n  \u2022 Player will now spin to face direction of attack after being killed by a shark or crocodile\n  \u2022 Improved cave wall collision accuracy\n  \u2022 Improved look of cannibal village hut thatched grass textures\n  \u2022 Fixed bodies ragdolling weirdly if dropped on bonfire\n  \u2022 It\u2019s No longer possible to attach bombs to enemy gibs\n  \u2022 Held small rocks and tennis balls are now dropped when sitting on a bench\n  \u2022 Fixed player arm clipping through camera sometimes during axe attacks\n  \u2022 Fixed slightly laggy movement on player camera during plane crash\n  \u2022 Fixed animals sometimes not pathing correctly around structures and other obstacles\n  \u2022 Lowered overall movement speed while attacking with chainsaw\n  \u2022 Reduced chainsaw damage against creepy mutants and end game boss\n  \u2022 (Multiplayer) Fixed small meat not visible in remote player hands when held\n  \u2022 It is now possible to bind mouse buttons to axis actions such as movement\n  \u2022 Looking at a damaged structure (not needing logs for repair) while holding a log no longer shows the repair widget and instead shows the missing repair tool icon\n  \u2022 Fixed loading saves with toy not initializing properly all renderers\n  \u2022 Fixed flashlight not properly set as the current light item after selecting it in inventory\n  \u2022 Fixed prev page button in Boats page of book pointing to Traps 2 instead of Traps 3 (defensive structures)\n  \u2022 New HUD elements added. Replaced stomach drawing, and cleaned up and created new HUD backing, and added new gradients for bars\n  \u2022 (multiplayer)Fixed player standing up after being killed while in injured state\n  \u2022 (multiplayer) Enemies and animals will now collide with rocks for client players when the host is very far away\n  \u2022 (UI) Revamped build mission UI items are now striked off and animated when completed\n  \u2022 It is now possible to add logs to ziplines to let it transport them across to the other end!\n  \u2022 When the Drop button is pressed and an actual item is dropped (rather than stashed) the previously equipped item is now equipped automatically\n  \u2022 (Performance) Simplified physics setup of defensive wall reinforcements\n  \u2022 (UI) New design for collected item messages and tutorials\n  \u2022 Mushrooms may now be collected using the pouch\u00a0! It is now possible to carry up to 10 mushrooms\n  \u2022 Gardens created in caves now have the option to plant mushrooms instead of seeds.\n  \u2022 Survival book pages re-worked for majority of pages. Some pages are still wip such as bestiary, and older crafting pages\n  \u2022 Fixed player camera breaking if taking damage during hanging in cave cutscene\n  \u2022 You can now use equipped shell as a sled by jumping and doing a downward attack\n  \u2022 Arrows, spears and flintlock pistol can now deal increased headshot damage to enemies\n  \u2022 Hole cutter can now also remove rock path, deer skin, rabbit skin and skull decorations\n  \u2022 Added mouse smoothing setting with option to set this to zero\n  \u2022 Fixed player sometimes able to jump while crouched in vents and other tight areas\n  \u2022 Improved held pot pose and added gather water animation when using pot at lakes and ponds\n  \u2022 You can now make poison arrows using poisoned mushrooms\n  \u2022 Fixed a case of prefab bundle loader going on and off quickly when placed as greeble creating several routines for a single object and causing the bundle to end up unloaded automatically after finishing loader as if unused (would result in some items not appearing when they should such as types of corpses in caves)\n  \u2022 Added cpu ocean optimization when far away\nPC Full Release\nv1.0v1.05v1.06 (b) \u2022 v1.07VR BetaVR Fix 1VR Beta 2v1.08VR Beta 3v1.09v1.10 (bcd) \u2022 v1.11V1.12 - VR\nPC Alpha\/Early Access\nv0.01 (b) \u2022 v0.02v0.03v0.04 (b) \u2022 v0.05v0.06 (b) \u2022 v0.07v0.08 (bcd) \u2022 v0.09 (b) \u2022 v0.10v0.11 (ac) \u2022 v0.12v0.13 (b) \u2022 v0.14v0.15 (b) \u2022 v0.16 (b) \u2022 v0.17 (b) \u2022 v0.18 (bc) \u2022 v0.19 (bc) \u2022 v0.20 (b) \u2022 v0.21 (bc) \u2022 v0.22v0.23 (bcd) \u2022 v0.24 (b) \u2022 v0.25 (b) \u2022 v0.26 (bcd) \u2022 v0.27v0.28 (bcd) \u2022 v0.29 (bc) \u2022 v0.30 (b) \u2022 v0.31 (b) \u2022 v0.32v0.33 (bcd) \u2022 v0.34v0.35 (bc) \u2022 v0.36 (b) \u2022 v0.37v0.38 (b) \u2022 v0.39 (b) \u2022 v0.40v0.41 (b) \u2022 v0.42 (bc) \u2022 v0.43 (bc) \u2022 v0.44 (bc) \u2022 v0.45 (b) \u2022 v0.46 (bc) \u2022 v0.47 (bcd) \u2022 v0.48 (b) \u2022 v0.49 (b) \u2022 v0.50 (bc) \u2022 v0.51 (b) \u2022 v0.52 (b) \u2022 v0.53 (bc) v0.54 (b) \u2022 v0.55 (bc) \u2022 v0.56 (bc) \u2022 v0.57 (bc) \u2022 v0.58 (b) \u2022 v0.59 (b) \u2022 v0.60 (b) \u2022 v0.61 (bc) \u2022 v0.62v0.63 (b) \u2022 v0.64v0.65 (b) \u2022 v0.66v0.67 (bc) \u2022 v0.68 (bcd) \u2022 v0.69 (b) \u2022 v0.70 (bc) \u2022 v0.71 (b) \u2022 v0.72 (b) \u2022 v0.73 (b)\nPS4 v1.0PS4 v1.01PS4 v1.02PS4 v1.03PS4 v1.04PS4 v1.05PS4 v1.06PS4 v1.07PS4 v1.08PS4 v1.09PS4 v1.10PS4 v1.11PS4 v1.12PS4 v1.13PS4 v1.14PS4 v1.15\nUpdatesPlaystation UpdatesUpcoming Features\nThe current version is V1.12 - VR which was released on September 11, 2019\nThe current major version is v1.12 - VR which was released on September 11, 2019",

Under \"Good\" Disadvantages, the references to Honesty should be to Truthfulness instead.\n\nP. 44. Under the Skill Defaults: Using Skills You Don't Know sidebar, insert this paragraph in between the third and fourth paragraphs: \"Default levels in skills do not carry any of the skills' special benefits with them. Special benefits would include damage bonuses, dodge bonuses, 2\/3-skill parry, unpenalized off-hand use, move bonuses, and so on.\"\n\nP. 49. Battlesuit\/TL is Physical\/Average.\n\nP. 52. Under the Spear Thrower skill, delete the line that says to use ST+5 when using a Spear Thrower for determining damage and range. Spear Thrower now has a separate entry in the weapons tables.\n\nP. 63. Carousing defaults to HT-4.\n\nP. 65. Demolition defaults to Underwater Demolition-2, as well as the listed defaults.\n\nP. 68. Underwater Demolition should be listed as a TL skill.\n\nP. 73. In the Weapon Effects sidebar, delete \"(other attacks may do zero damage)\" under Thrusting Attacks.\n\nP. 74. Change the damage done by ST 4 or less in the Basic Damage Table. ST 4 has a basic damage of 1d-6 (thrusting and swinging); ST 3 has 1d-7; ST 2 has 1d-8; and so on.\n\nP. 74. The line at the bottom of the chart should read \"See p. 248 for a chart covering higher levels of ST.\"\n\nP. 90. We dropped a line from the top of the page in this and the previous printing. The first line should read \"Picking Things Up In Combat: In combat, a light item is picked up with the\"\n\nP. 97. Under Concentrate, the second sentence should read \"If the character is hurt, knocked down, forced to use an active defense, or otherwise distracted, he must make a Will-3 roll to maintain his concentration.\" Delete the third sentence.\n\nP. 98. In the attack penalties sidebar, the reference for strange position should be to p. 123, not p. 120.\n\nP. 101. Under Punching, add a note that its Reach is C,1. Under Kicking, add a note that its Reach is 1 without Karate training.\n\nThe first sentence under Kicking should read \"A kick is treated exactly like a punch, except your skill is DX-2, Brawling-2, or Karate-2, and you do straight Thrust\/Crush damage - or Thrust+1 if you are wearing heavy boots or something similar.\"\n\nP. 106. Under Step and Concentrate, the second paragraph should read \"If the character is hurt, knocked down, forced to use and active defense, or otherwise distracted, he must make a Will-3 roll to maintain his concentration.\"\n\nP. 109. In the Massive Damage sidebar, change the comment \"is lost and does not affect the victim\" to \"cripples the limb instead of dealing additional hits of damage.\"\n\nP. 111. Change the fourth sentence under Grapple to read \"Grappling does no damage, but the foe is at -4 DX and may not leave until he breaks free, or you let go.\"\n\nP. 119. Under Single-Shot Weapons change the last two sentences to \"This penalty is applied to a second or subsequent shot from the same gun, unless there is a minimum one-second pause between shots. The penalty is doubled if your ST is below the minimum listed for the weapon, and the minimum pause becomes two seconds.\"\n\nP. 119. In the Revised edition only, change the reference to GURPS Space in the Power Supplies sidebar to p. 247.\n\nP. 127. Under Crippling Injuries, change \"taking hits equal to\" to \"being hit for\". Similarly, under Knockdown, change \"Anyone who takes damage\" to \"Anyone who is hit for\".\n\nP. 131. Under Falling Objects change the line that begins \"For simplicity\" to read \"For simplicity, when dealing with falling inanimate objects. . . .\" Falling beings reach terminal velocity at 50 yards, as described under Falling, above.\n\nP. 139. In the first paragraph after the diagram, the reference to \"flying\" skill should be to Piloting skill.\n\nP. 159. In the description of Destroy Water, delete \"(but see the next spell)\" from the last sentence. The Dehydrate spell does not follow in Basic, as it does in Magic.\n\nP. 167. The One-Skill Cost for Psi Sense should be 1.\n\nP. 175-176. We intended to change the Limitations rules in the sidebar to match those in GURPS Psionics. We didn't. If you have GURPS Psionics, follow it in case of discrepancies.\n\nP. 195. In the Loyalty Checks sidebar, Rescue needs to be changed. When a hireling is rescued, make a Reaction Roll (not a Loyalty Check). This roll should be at +3 or more, depending on the nature of the rescue. The hireling's loyalty is the result of the Reaction Roll, or his original loyalty, whichever is higher.\n\nP. 201. Under Ranged Attack Modifiers: Opportunity fire, the penalty for watching one hex is -2. The penalty for watching two hexes is still -4.\n\nP. 207. Replace the Spear Thrower entry in the weapons table with this one:\n\nWeaponTypeAmountRangesCostWeightMin ST\nSPEAR THROWER (DX-4 or Spear Throwing-4)\nAtlatl$202 lbs.\nw\/Dartimpsw-1111STx3STx4$201 lb.none\nw\/Javelinimpsw+1113STx2STx3$302 lbs.7\nw\/Spearimpsw+3122STx1.5STx2$404 lbs.9\n\nP. 245.

        "text":"Update 15.1 - December 15, 2014\n\nFrom Lotro-Wiki.com\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nIndex to all release notes\n\nPatches(155 P)\n\nUpdate 15.1 Release Notes\n\nOf Important Note: Essence changes\n\nSome Essences available in Central Gondor were too powerful when equipped in multiples. Therefore, they have been made \"Unique Use\". You can only have one of any particular unique use essence equipped on your character at a time. In order to clean up the players who already have multiples of a unique use essence equipped, two changes have been made:\n\n  1. When a player logs in for the first time after Update 15.1, if they have more than one of a unique use essence socketed in all their equipment, any armor or jewelry with that essence will be unequipped and placed in their inventory (going to overflow if inventory is full). The player will also get chat notification telling them that this happened.\n  2. When a player tries to equip a piece of equipment, the game will check whether the item has multiples of a unique use essence. If so, the player will not be able to equip that armor or jewelry, and all instances of the duplicated unique use essence will be removed and placed into the player\u2019s inventory. (Going to overflow if inventory is full). Note: this will only happen as long as the player has no other item with a matching unique use essence already equipped.\n\n\n  \u2022 Players arriving by stable-master in Ethring should no longer get attacked when another player is in the quest In Ethring's Defence\n  \u2022 Ettenmoors guards which used to attack low-level scaled-up players have been given a talking-to\n  \u2022 Moved the default position of the \"Quest Actions Available\" button to be higher, so it no longer overlaps the quest tracker text. It now hides the coordinates of your current location, but that seems like a better place to be.\n  \u2022 Several non-stance toggle skills, such as Reveal Weakness can now persist across the player mounting up, although their effects are suppressed while the player is\n  \u2022 Trait point rewards in the deed log now show an icon\n  \u2022 You can now use \"Track Nearby Quests\" in interior locations\n  \u2022 It should now be more difficult for players to become out of sync with their mounts when riding.\n  \u2022 Boxes that allow you to select one item, such as the new legacy scroll box now regenerate their contents when you open them.\n  \u2022 Fixed a problem where players could be charged Mithril Coins for repair item services while they were incapacitated that wouldn't do anything. Now you can't repair the item while dead.\n  \u2022 Made it possible for some names in examination tooltips to use smaller fonts, to avoid getting cut off\n  \u2022 Players should no longer stutter when walking.\n  \u2022 The launcher stopped downloading new in-game splash screens, it will start downloading them again! The launcher stopped performing the \"install pre-requisites\" stage, it will once again install missing pre-requisites.\n\n\n  \u2022 Mounted Combat: - Motivation Through Aggression was giving its effect to Slash twice, this should not be the case anymore.\n  \u2022 Mounted Combat: - Fixed issue with Beornings Ferocious Roar buff allowing all auto-attacks to critically hit while the buff is active.\n  \u2022 Mounted Combat: - Resolved issue that wasn't properly granting the Beornings skills for completing the introductory quest\n  \u2022 Mounted Combat: Everlasting Focus should now affect Dash and Coax. Also added to the tooltip to notify the player that this trait does not affect healing effects.\n  \u2022 Mounted Combat: Medium Bridle's damage over time pulse legacy should now affect all Beorning damage over time effects.\n  \u2022 Beornings should now be able to use keep back doors in Ettenmoors.\n  \u2022 Many of the Beorning\u2019s skills were incorrectly labeled as melee skills when they were in fact tactical skills.\n  \u2022 Iorelen's Camp should now have a barter vendor that sells Beorning specific Rift gear.\n  \u2022 Out-of-Combat Wrath Decay legacy should now lower the amount of wrath drained instead of increasing it.\n  \u2022 Fellowing with a Beorning that isn\u2019t nearby should no longer cause a Power meter to display in their Fellowship vitals display.\n  \u2022 Beorning Trainers should no longer appear to sell Burglar Class Items.\n  \u2022 Reaching zero Wrath in man form should no longer prompt the player with an effect notifying them they are about to switch into man form.\n  \u2022 Many heals and buffs were breaking target\u2019s stealth when used on an ally. This should not be the case anymore.\n  \u2022 Resolved an issue where Expose Weakness was not properly refreshing itself if already present on the player.\n  \u2022 Fixed Grimbeorn's Strength bonus for Cleanse that was not properly reducing the cooldown of the skill when used on your marked target.\n  \u2022 Resolved an issue that was causing Grimbeorn's Strength to remove the tooltip info of Sacrifice.\n  \u2022 Relentless Maul should now properly damage players in spars.\n  \u2022 Relentless Maul - Relentless Maul should now more consistently deliver 8 pulses (or 4 with Brutal Energy trait). Previously the last pulse would sometimes be missed.\n  \u2022 There's now a Beorning video that you can play when making a new Beorning using the \"play movie\" button.\n  \u2022 Wrath tooltips in the character panel now show the out of combat decay rate.\n  \u2022 Beornings: You can now fish in the Vales of Anduin\n  \u2022 NPC Beorning Trainers show up on the Map now\n  \u2022 Relaxed naming restrictions surrounding \"-beorn\", which is now a legal character name suffix.\n  \u2022 Beornings can now access certain pedestals during the fight with Zholuga in Dar Narbugud.\n  \u2022 Beornings can now use the Dagger of the Eglan-soldier or the Axe of the Eglan-vanguard. There is also a new 2 Handed Club for Beornings to acquire.\n  \u2022 Relentless Maul Damage Legacy should now properly increase the damage of Relentless Maul.\n  \u2022 Beornings should now look less awkward when jumping.\n  \u2022 Monster Play - Beornings should now get Battlefield Promotions\n\n\n  \u2022 Fixed issue regarding Rune of Restoration's trait making mentioning of a max rank that was no longer present.\n  \u2022 Rune-stones should now properly damage players in spars.\n  \u2022 Glorious Foreshadowing Duration Legacy should now properly increase the duration of Glorious Foreshadowing.\n\n\n\n  \u2022 Lore-master bear pets no longer roar out of combat\n\nArmor, Items and Gear\n\n  \u2022 Hytbold gear should now use the proper appearances for Beornings.\n  \u2022 Hytbold gear should now properly be Bind On Account for Beornings.\n  \u2022 Fixed issue with Hytbold 4-set bonuses display on gear. Some sets had no information while others were showing incorrect information.\n  \u2022 Beorning Erebor and Greater Erebor armor sets should now be available at all skirmish camps.\n  \u2022 Proc Essences - Proc Essences from Central Gondor which restore\u00a0% Morale upon a successful Evade now have a 20 second cooldown\n\nEpic Battles, Quests and Instances\n\n  \u2022 Gondor - Endgame - Retaking Dol Amroth - Docks: Mobs no longer fall off the boat\n  \u2022 Western Gondor - Endgame - Bait Ball: Fail timer increased from two minutes to five minutes.\n  \u2022 Addressed a flaw in Epic Battles interactables (e.g. siege weapons and barricades) that could result in incorrect player state after their current target is destroyed. This would manifest as a General Error and an inability to interact with a different object.\n  \u2022 Central Gondor -- Dor-en-Ernil -- You must now complete Rallying a Defence before entering the instance \"Blood for Blood\" at the end of the Dor-en-Ernil quest line.\n  \u2022 Helegrod -- Drake Wing -- Completing the challenge properly awards seals and medallions again.\n  \u2022 Deeping Wall -- It is now possible to achieve a platinum medal on Securing the Culvert again, and laborers once again have haste as an action.\n  \u2022 Deeping Wall -- Shells in the Air -- Items related to the secondary and the medals on the mini-map are now the proper color.\n  \u2022 Ground targeting reticles displayed while interacting with Epic Battle siege weapons should no longer erroneously disappear over certain geometry.\n  \u2022 Lebennin - Instance: Sons of the Usurper - Half-trolls from the non-instanced version of the camp will no longer be present in the instance space.\n  \u2022 Lebennin - Instance: Sons of the Usurper - If you are defeated in the instance, you will now retreat to the entrance of Hata Kebir inside the instance instead of being ported out to a rally circle near Linhir.\n  \u2022 Western Gondor -- Jajax should no longer spawn underground.\n  \u2022 Dol Amroth -- Death from Above -- Added text insisting that you use the flag item on the spotters before defeating them. Also dramatically reduced the cooldown on the flag item.\n  \u2022 Epic Battles -- Helm's Deep -- Deeping Wall -- Various interactive objects now reference the proper quest, banner colors on the mini-map have been corrected, and objects no longer clip into walls\/decorations\n  \u2022 Quartermaster's Rewards now being granted for ALL Helm's Deep battles & secondaries.\n  \u2022 Fixed a problem with how the \"completion percentage\" was calculated.

        "text":"The Chess Variant Pages\n\nThis page is written by the game's inventor, Fergus Duniho.\n\nThree Player Hex Shogi 91\n\nby Fergus Duniho\n\nThree Player Hex Shogi 91 is a Shogi variant for three players on a hexagonally shaped board of 91 hexagons. It is played very much like Shogi, except that pieces are adapted to a hexagonal board, there are three sides, the object is different, and the restrictions on Pawn drops are different. It plays by most of the rules of Hex Shogi, a class of hexagonal Shogi variants invented by Fergus Duniho.\n\n\nShortly after I created Hex Shogi, Peter Aronson wrote to me:\n\nLooking at your interesting articles on Hex Shogi, I was reminded of some thoughts I once had on three-player Chess variants and the petit diplomacy problem. While I'm sure you're aware of it, I'll repeat it here for the sake of discussion. There are two parts:\n\n(1) In a three-player game, one player can sit out the fighting while the other two fight. Then, once the fighting is over, defeat the damaged victor.\n\n(2) In a three-player game, two players can gang up on the third, eliminate them, and then fight each other to the death.\n\nIt seems to me that a three-player Shogi variant would not suffer from (1) at all, since the victor would have captured a substantial number of their victim's pieces, and be stronger (at least in material) than the player who stayed out. And while (2) isn't eliminated, in a Shogi variant the co-conspirators have a lot more reason to fall out early in the process: neither is going to want the other to capture too many of the player they are dismembering's stronger pieces.\n\nIt looks to me that the movements you have defined for pieces in Hex Shogi would work well in a three-player Shogi variant, since the forward-moving pieces, having two forward directions, could (if the armies are arranged in a triangle) move towards either opponent. What do you think?\n\nI regarded these as all excellent points, and I proceeded to create a three player version of Hex Shogi. I knew that Zillions of Games wasn't suited for the usual three player Chess variants, yet I wanted to be able to play it on Zillions of Games. The main problem that Zillions had with three player games is that it would end as soon as someone lost--even if no one had won yet. I got around this by setting an object that doesn't end the game until someone wins. This was that a player wins by acquiring all three Kings. This object also happened to work better in a Shogi context than a Chess context, because players normally keep and replay the pieces they capture in Shogi. So I let the same thing be done with Kings. To prevent players from hoarding captured Kings, I also added a rule that captured Kings must be dropped before other pieces. I then implemented the game for Zillions, playtested it, and settled on a setup suitable for the game.\n\n\n\nFor the full rules of Three Player Hex Shogi, supplement this page with the rules for Hex Shogi. Three Player Hex Shogi is played like Hex Shogi with the following exceptions:\n\n\nTo win, you must acquire all three Kings. There is no check or checkmate. Kings may freely stay in or move into danger. Resignation is permitted only when one player has lost all his pieces and the game is down to two players.\n\n\nThe game is a draw if the same position is repeated three times, fifty moves pass without a capture, every player is forced to pass, or all players in the game agree to a draw. But none of these draw conditions are likely to occur. There is no stalemate in the usual sense. When a player cannot move, he is forced to pass. Passing is not allowed unless it is forced. When a player has lost all his pieces, he is forced to pass until the end of the game, already predestined to lose. If a game is drawn after one player has already lost all of his pieces, the draw does not apply to that player. In tournament play, that player would receive zero points, and the others would each receive a half point. In a draw between all three players, each player would receive a third point. In an official tournament, players should not be allowed to draw a game by agreement.\n\nCaptured Kings\n\nWhen a King is captured, a player holds it in hand like any other piece, and it may be dropped on any empty space (even a threatened space) during a subsequent turn. When a player holds a King in hand, he may not drop other pieces. To drop any other pieces, a player must first drop any Kings held in hand.\n\n\nThe promotion zone for each player consists of the three horizontal ranks (by that player's own perspective) on the opposite side of the board from where his pieces start out. This partially overlaps where the other two players start. When a piece moves from, into, or within its promotion zone, it may promote if there is a piece it promotes to.\n\nOrientation of Pieces\n\nThe first player (Black) faces a 12 o'clock direction, as the first player does in Shogi or Hex Shogi. The second player (White) faces a 4 o'clock direction, and the third player (Gray) faces an 8 o'clock direction. The orientation of a player's pieces determines the forward and backward directions for a piece. The forward directions for the first player are 10 o'clock through 2 o'clock; for the second player 2 o'clock through 6 o'clock; and for the third player 6 o'clock through 10 o'clock. This affects how the Pawns, Lances, Knights, and Gold and Silver Generals of each player move. From each player's own perspective, his pieces move exactly the same as they would in Hex Shogi, but the pieces of the other players will seem to move differently than they do in two-player Hex Shogi. The following table of diagrams shows how orientation affects these pieces. Kings, Bishops, Rooks, and promoted Bishops and Rooks are unaffected by orientation, and are not shown in this table.\n\n\n\n\n\nGold General\n\nSilver General\n\nZillions of Games\n\nThree Player Hex Shogi 91 has been implemented for Zillions of Games. You may download it here:\n\nNote: This ZRFs requires at least Zillions 1.1.1. If you don't have Zillions 1.1.1., you may get it to work by deleting the (translate ) block at the beginning of the file. Unlike my Hex Shogi ZRFs, it does not use multiple piece sets.\n\nWritten by Fergus Duniho\nWWW Page Created: 17 November 2000 \ufeff",

        "text":"From Crusader Kings II Wiki\nJump to navigation Jump to search\n\nPositions.txt is an important file in Map modding that stores all the data of locations of Map Objects in a province. These Map Objects include armies, councilors,cities and ports.\n\nWhen a map is first created from scratch and fails to load, Positions.txt is often one of the culprits. It is often advised to leave Positions.txt empty when creating a new map, since it will prevent the file from crashing the game. The problem with this solution is that it will center all Map Objects in the center of the province. It is advised to fill Positions.txt only when modders are done with Provinces.bmp\n\nThere are a few ways to fill Positions.txt:\n\n  \u2022 Manually filling Positions.txt by getting the data from an image editor.\n  \u2022 Using the in-game tool called Nudge\n\nManual editing[edit | edit source]\n\nWhen manually editing Positions.txt, the modder will be presented with a list of entries in the following format:\n\n#Name of province (optional)\nProvince number =\n\t\tX\u2081 Y\u2081  X\u2082 Y\u2082  X\u2083 Y\u2083  X\u2084 Y\u2084  X\u2085 Y\u2085\n\t\tR\u2081 R\u2082 R\u2083 R\u2084 R\u2085\n\t\tH\u2081 H\u2082 H\u2083 H\u2084 H\u2085\n  \u2022 The name of the province is a comment and is used only for ease of use. It has no in-game function.\n  \u2022 The province number is the number of the province as defined in definition.csv\n  \u2022 The values for the various objects are listed in three separate sections. (See the Map objects section below for a list of the objects.) All values are listed to three decimal places (e.g. 0 is listed as 0.000).\n    \u2022 Position is comprised of a list of X and Y coordinates for the various items, which are measured in pixels. They are measured from 0.000, with 0.000 0.000 being the bottom left corner of the map. The size of the map is determined by the pixel dimensions of provinces.bmp. As such, the position of an item is equivalent to the pixel it would occupy in provinces.bmp. Note however that Photoshop (and other image-editing software) treats the top-left as (0, 0).\n    \u2022 Rotation determines the rotation of an item. It is measured in radians, with 0.000 corresponding to due south. As such, due north is represented as \u03c0 radians, or 3.142. Generally, this is only used by ports, although it also affects cities and text.\n    \u2022 Height determines the height of an item relative to the height of the map. This is usually unnecessary but can sometimes be used to prevent items from clipping into surrounding terrain. By default, the county's label has a value of 20.000, while all other values are 0.000\n\nNudge[edit | edit source]\n\nNudge is an in-game tool that helps filling Positions.txt.\n\nNudge will work with your mod's positions.txt, but it will always save it over the positions.txt in your CK2 installation. Before using Nudge, back up the vanilla positions.txt, and after using Nudge, copy positions.txt from vanilla to your mod and copy the backup to the vanilla positions.txt.\n\nSetting up Nudge[edit | edit source]\n\nTo be able to access Nudge, browse to Documents\\Paradox Interactive\\Crusader Kings II\\YOUR MOD FOLDER\\Settings.txt. If you do not find a folder for your Mod, you have not told the game to make one in your Mod's Mod File or you have not run your Mod yet. In the first case editing the vanilla settings.txt instead will work.\n\nIn Settings.txt, find the line\n\n\nand change it to\n\n\nNow run your Mod. A Nudge button should now appear to the right of your normal Menu buttons.\n\nUsing Nudge[edit | edit source]\n\nNudge Interface\n\nTo bring up the Nudge interface, select a province. Nudge's interface is simple, but it will still be explained here.\n\n  \u2022 Map Objects: Located to the left of the interface, the selection boxes allow you to specify which Map Object you want to modify.\n  \u2022 Height: The three buttons in the middle-left allow you to change the height of the selected Map Object. The height can be reset by pressing the middle \"0\" button.\n  \u2022 Arrows: The four buttons in the middle-right allow you to change the location of the selected Map Object.\n  \u2022 Rotation: The four buttons to the right allow you to change the rotation of the selected Map Object. This is measured in degrees. The - and + rotate the object in 5 degree increments with the -- and ++ buttons rotate it in 45 degree increments. +\/++ rotate it clockwise while -\/-- rotate it anti-\/counter-clockwise. For ports, 0 represents due south.\n  \u2022 Save: This button saves Positions.txt to your Crusader Kings 2\\map folder. Remember to copy the new Positions.txt to your Mod's map folder.\n  \u2022 Check: This button applies a color to a province while not in terrain mapmode. The coloration is specific to each map object type (see below), and will be red if the object lies outside of the province; otherwise it will turn green. The coloration will also remain until the game is exited, allowing it to be used to remember which provinces have already been modified.\n  \u2022 Mapmode: This button changes Mapmode between a Terrain Mapmode and a Mapmode that displays checked provinces. As of at least patch 3.1.0, this button is non-fuctioning and crashes the game.\n\nTo start moving Map Objects around, right click on the location where you want to have the Map Object. After that you can make more accurate edits with the arrows, rotate the Map Object or modify the height of the Map Object. There is no interface to exit the game while using Nudge, so ALT + F4 must be used to exit the game.\n\nMap Objects[edit | edit source]\n\nThere are 7 Map Objects you can work with:\n\n  \u2022 Cities: Cities in CKII are the houses on the map. These houses surround a central building, such as a tower for baronies. Move this central building and the houses will move with it.\n  \u2022 Units: This is where the armies appear when they are raised or stationed in province. Armies cannot be rotated and should be placed in even ground, since their feet can clip in the ground when they are on uneven ground. Also note that when in combat more than one army is displayed on the map, and when in transit armies are displayed to the north west of their standing position, so it is advisable to place them away from borders and bodies of water where possible.\n  \u2022 Councillors: this is where the Councillors are placed in the province. Remember that if there is more than one councillor in a province, they will surround this location. As such, it should not be placed near borders or on an island (where possible). Councillors cannot be rotated and should be placed in even ground, since their feet can clip in the ground when they are on uneven ground.\nOn sea tiles, this coordinate determines where ships which are in transit to an adjacent tile will be displayed.\n  \u2022 Text: This is the name of the county which appears on the map. It is ill advised to edit the text, as it can break the text in other provinces. It doesn't affect text on the menu, but does have an effect in-game.\n  \u2022 Ports: Only coastal provinces can have ports. When the port is not visible, it is often located within\/underneath the land of the province and thus hidden from view. Right-clicking near the coast where you want it is one way to resolve this issue. Parts of the port can be located underwater, so be sure to rise it where necessary.\n  \u2022 Wonder: The location of a wonder that shows a non-coastal background in the interface.\n  \u2022 Coastal Wonder: The location of a wonder that shows a coastal background in the interface.\n\nAs they are not associated with any particular county\/province, other map objects such as the frame around the map and the wonders added in DLC 63 are not defined in positions.txt; they are instead treated as \"statics\", which are defined in text files within map\\statics\\ and use a different (but similar) system.",

They send a small UDP packet, and the server replies with a larger packet to the faked address. Multiply this by however fast you can stuff UDP packets into the server's incoming packet buffer per frame, times 7500+ public COD4 servers, and you can really bring a victim to its knees with a serious flood of unwanted packets.\n\nI've got a patch for COD4 for this, and I need admins to test it before I make an official release.\n\nYou'll need a server updated to 1.7 before applying this, because this is only a replacement cod4_lnxded file. The defaults for the new cvars are probably fine, but you can tweak them as you like.\n\nIf you want to see it in action, find your patched server in the in-game server browser, click \"Server Info\" and keep hitting refresh. If you're doing it faster than the limit, you'll see you don't get a response right away.\n\nAll this info is in README.linux in that tarball, but I'll post it here, too:\n\n\nAbout query limits:\n\nThere is a class of DDoS attack that can utilize COD4 servers to flood a third party, by spoofing UDP packets so that the game server sends its reply for information to an unsuspecting party, over and over, as fast as it can. Unlike most packets sent by the server, this reply packet does not require a player with a legitimate connection before sending.\n\nThis patch sets up some reasonable defaults to limit the rate at which the server will send these reply packets to a given IP address. It does not throttle legitimate connections in the process.\n\nThe gist is this: If someone sends a query packet, we note their IP address and ignore any further queries for X seconds. If they send a port-unreachable packet (person being spoofed isn't playing the game), we ignore their IP address for Y seconds. This will let normal people play, it prevents people that don't have a legitimate player connection from flooding the server with queries, and it'll stop DDoS attacks against third parties.\n\nIf millions of computers try to wail on a single server, this patch should handle it gracefully (we don't allocate memory when adding IP addresses to the ignore list, we use a hashtable so we don't have to check millions of IP addresses for every query, and we clean out old addresses a little each frame).\n\nPeople that are connected to the server don't have their packets ignored; this only limits server responses to packets that don't need a valid player connection (like the infostring, etc). LAN addresses are never limited.\n\nAdmins can tune it (and turn it off completely) with cvars.\n\nNote that a single IP address using different ports all get lumped into the same ignore list entry. This is to make life difficult for attackers and keep things efficient on the server. If 16 players are all behind the same NAT, they might notice it takes longer for the server to respond to each of them individually at the start. They should run a LAN server anyhow, but gameplay will still perform normally here.\n\nServer admins have 4 cvars to control this:\n\nsv_queryIgnoreDebug: set to 1 to log information about attacks. This will write out a lot of logging. Defaults to 0.\n\nsv_queryIgnoreMegs: Number of megabytes we should use to store the ignore list. Set to 0 to turn off the ignore list (basically disables this patch). 1 megabyte handles about 65000 IP addresses, each megabyte after the first adds about 87000 more. 1 is probably fine unless you're under serious attack, but maybe a server wants to spare 12 megs to block a million IP addresses simultaneously. Defaults to 1.\n\nsv_queryIgnoreTime: Number of milliseconds to ignore an IP address's info requests after responding to one of them. Set to 0 to not ignore at all. Defaults to 2000 (2 seconds).\n\nsv_queryBounceIgnoreTime: Number of milliseconds to ignore an IP address's info requests after a server packet bounced with an ICMP Port Unreachable notice. Set to 0 to not ignore at all. Defaults to 12000 (2 _minutes_).\n\n\nPlease note that I haven't touched this code since 2008, so even though the changes are relatively localized, don't blast this out to all your servers until you feel it's stable.\n\nPlease give me feedback!\n\n\nFirewall solution\n\n$IPT -A INPUT -p UDP -m length --length 42 -m recent --set --name getstatus_cod\n$IPT -A INPUT -p UDP -m string --algo bm --string \"getstatus\" -m recent --update --seconds 1 --hitcount 20 --name getstatus_cod -j DROP\n\nWould you like to support this Wiki?
