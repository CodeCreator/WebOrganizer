        "text":"Zipper Quiz\n\nGeneral FAQs\n\nIdentify your zipper type and zipper size by using our simple Zipper Quiz or watching the How-To video below. \u00a0\n\nPlease note that we carry a generic (GEN) plastic zipper adapter that can be tried with non-YKK zippers. However we cannot guarantee compatibility with all non-YKK zippers and offer refunds for unworn merchandise returned to us.\u00a0 We do not cover the cost for shipping.\n\n\n\nZipper Basics\n\nZ01 \u00a0What is my zipper type?\n\nThe zipper type is determined by the zipper chain (teeth or coil).\n\n\nPlastic molded zippers are the most common type used in heavy outerwear. \u00a0For\u00a0YKK brand zippers Vislon is used to indicate plastic zippers so you will often see 5VS, 8VS, or 10V. \u00a0Other zipper brands may have only a number to indicate size.\n\nMetal zippers are also popular with heavy coats or jackets. \u00a0\n\nCoil zippers are typically used in light- or medium-weight jackets. \u00a0\n\nReverse coil\u00a0zippers are used to minimize or hide the presence of the zipper. These are \"reversed\" from a coil zipper so that the coils face inside and are not visible from the front.\n\nZ02 \u00a0What is my zipper size?\n\nThe zipper size is a number typically stamped on the back of the slider. \u00a0It may be accompanied by letters to form a code containing extra information such as the zipper type or batch. \u00a0Below is an example of a YKK 5VS (size 5 plastic) zipper. \u00a0\n\nZ03 \u00a0How many sliders does my zipper have?\n\nThe zipper on the left has one slider and is called a one-way separating zipper. \u00a0The zipper on the right has two sliders and is called a two-way separating zipper.\u00a0\n\nZ04 \u00a0Is my slider\u00a0on the left or right side?\n\nDifferent companies may use different conventions for defining\u00a0left- and right-handedness. \u00a0 Bridge the Bump uses \"left\" and \"right\" to describe which side the zipper sliders are from the perspective of the person wearing the coat. \u00a0\n\nWhen ordering our inserts please\u00a0specify\u00a0whether your sliders are on your left or right side while\u00a0wearing your\u00a0coat.\n\nZ05 \u00a0What is my zipper length?\n\nThe zipper length is measured from the zipper top stop to the zipper bottom stop. \u00a0This length does not include the extra tape that extends beyond these stops.\n\n\nZ06 \u00a0What is the difference between YKK \"5V\" and YKK \"5VS\" zippers?\n\nAbout 10 years ago YKK changed the production of its size 5 and size 8 sliders. \u00a0Size 10 sliders were not affected by this change.\n\nThe older model slider has a rounded top (see left photo below) compared to the winged top (see right photo below) of the newer model. \u00a0Old slider models are stamped on the back with a \"V\" while new slider models are stamped with a \"VS\". \u00a0Unfortunately older models are not compatible with newer models.\n\nPlastic zippers used by Bridge the Bump are mostly 5VS or 10V. \u00a0We may have a handful of the older 5V model zippers in stock and may be able to accommodate a custom order\u00a0depending on your zipper's specifications.\n\n\nBack to the top",

This is about $15.00 USD or\u00a0\u00a311 but will vary slightly with the exchange rate. You can select your preferred currency in the shop and your cart will automatically total your shipping price.\n\nDo you ship worldwide?\n\nYes we do!\n\nHow long will my order take?\n\nAll our items are made to order. It will take 2-3 weeks to make your order and shipping takes 3-4 working days.\n\nHow much is custom size?\n\nAs we make all our items to order, we offer custom size at no extra cost. Custom color and other custom changes may incur additional costs.\n\nHow do I wash my garments?\n\nBecause of the richness of colour in our Zizzyfay garments, we recommend you wash all items by hand in a cool wash. If your item has a hood, dry it hanging upside down.\n\nFor the more special items it is a good idea to get them dry-cleaned.\n\nThe jeans and long skirts are fine in a gentle cool machine wash.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to iron the silks, cotton and silk-cotton but don\u2019t iron the organza (it looks more magical slightly crinkled).\n\nWhere is Zizzyfay based?\n\nZizzyfay is a UK based outfit, and both Izzy and Shade are from Cornwall. However, we are both constantly travelling the world between UK, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nDo you make clothes for children?\n\nYes we can make the items for small faeries too! Simply select custom size and get out your measuring tape \ud83d\ude42\n\nCan I refund my item?\n\nAs we make our items specifically for you, we will refund your item only if it is faulty. Should you receive an item that is wrongly made, please contact us as soon as possible and we will either remake it or refund you.",

How can I find the perfect golden necklace or diamond earrings in their designs?\n\nHow does Wouters and Hendrix\u2019 design process work?\n\nThe uniqueness of the collections designed by Wouters and Hendrix for BAUNAT is in the stories behind the extraordinary designs. The quirky designers have put their creativity to work for an impressive five different collections. They use a different source as inspiration for every collection. Natural elements are particularly evident throughout the designers\u2019 portfolio.\n\nThese natural elements can also be seen in BAUNAT\u2019s designer collections. The golden necklace, the diamond ring, the classic earrings: each piece tells its own unique story.\n\nWhich stories do the unique collections at BAUNAT tell?\n\nWouters and Hendrix\u2019s jewellery always comes with a story in their striking, yet discrete lines. The diamond and golden jewellery may seem like classics from a distance, but a second glance will unveil their adventurous details. The Nathu collection combines sleek and fluency in an organic and timeless whole. Le Paradis exchanges sleekness for untamed nature and irregular lines which appeal to the imagination. The fickleness of nature is also strongly reflected in the playful Ouverture collection. The golden necklace has been given an entirely new interpretation with the mysterious and nostalgic medallions from M\u00e9daillon d\u2019Anvers.\n\nThe designer duo took a completely different approach with Jafo. Here the emphasis is specifically on culture and the mysterious and sleek jewellery takes a look back at the age old Japanese packing techniques.\n\nHow can I order a unique designer jewellery item from the collection?\n\nEach piece of jewellery exudes an individual complexity in the exclusive Wouters and Hendrix collections. Just like your own personality clearly comes to the forefront, each individual piece of jewellery does exactly the same. You will find sleek lines, organically irregular shapes and romantic appearances throughout the collections. That\u2019s why everyone can find a designer jewellery item which will appeal to their imagination. A golden necklace with a medallion? Or would you prefer a pair of sleek Japanese inspired earrings?

        "text":"Why small engagement rings are better?\n\nSmaller engagement rings, however, are less likely to get snagged or caught on something and often sport a lower profile than large rings with big gemstones, meaning it sits closer to your finger.\n\nDoes the engagement ring size matter?\n\nIt directly affects the way the light will reflect from the diamond \u2013 a feature that makes diamonds so special in the first place. So, remember \u2013 size matters but cut matters more. However, clarity and color also affect the appearance of the diamond.\n\nWhat if engagement ring is too small?\n\nIf the ring is too small, your jeweler will normally cut the bottom of the ring and add a small piece of metal to the shank. \u2026 Stretching the band of the ring can also thin the metal and distort the ring\u2019s shape, making it an option that\u2019s best avoided for engagement rings and other valuable jewelry.\n\nHow small is too small for engagement ring?\n\nWhat is considered a small engagement ring? Everyone\u2019s personal opinion of what is considered a small engagement ring may vary, however we consider small engagement rings to be around 0.3 carats to 0.8 carats. While they are considered small, they are no less stunning than a larger sized engagement ring.\n\nDo girls compare engagement rings?\n\nAs long as it\u2019s not the size of a promise ring (read: the size of a constricted pupil) then any engagement ring will really do. \u2026 That being said, I know women compare sizes of rings. They really do.\n\nIT IS AMAZING:\u00a0 Are babies classed as wedding guests?\n\nWhat rings Cannot be resized?\n\nTo be resized, your ring must be made of metal such as silver, gold or platinum. Jewelers cannot resize rings made of wood, quartz or other non-metal material. There must also be enough space around the ring for it to be made larger or smaller.\n\nPreparing for the wedding",

        "text":"Use FIRST15 for 15% off first order \/ FREE USA & CANADA SHIPPING OVER $75 \/ Shipping 5-10 days\n\nWhat is double cleansing and why should we do it?\n\nWhat is double cleansing?\n\nDouble cleansing is the process of cleansing the skin twice, as in a two-step process, to provide the skin with a \u201cdeep clean\u201d. Our 4-Step Kit skincare routine features a double cleanse process with step 1 being Filth (dirt cleansing protection) with a natural cleansing oil. The ingredients are ALL natural and designed to dissolve oil-based dirt such as make-up, sunscreen, sebum (oil) and daily pollution from the epidermis (outer layer of skin). Some sources say that double cleansing is an Asian skincare phenomenon which dates back as far as the fourteenth century and originated in Japan, Korea or China.\n\nShould I double cleanse morning and night?\n\nWe recommend using our 4-Step Kit skincare routine to double cleanse twice per day, in the morning and night. In the mornings we tend to see a build up of overnight sebum (oil) and dirt on our face.\n\nI have oily skin; can I use an oil cleanser?\n\nWith oily or acne prone skin you must keep skin hydrated, because if it gets too dry it will overproduce oil, which can cause more acne. Face oil can clear blemishes, soften irritated skin, brighten and remove acne scars. It can also act as a nourishing moisturiser to balance sebum (oil) production and calm the sweat glands.\n\nWill an oil cleanser make my skin breakout even more?\n\nThis could be the case if you use Step 1: Filth (dirt cleansing protection) but fail to remove this oil cleanser properly with Step 2: Stroke (double cleansing protection). It\u2019s really important that you use the water-based cleanser to remove any residual oil and dirt, otherwise you may clog your pores. Just be sure to apply the water-based cleanser, Stroke (double cleansing protection), by rubbing to create a lather so that it cleans the skin.\n\nHow do I know it\u2019s working?\n\nAfter cleansing with Step 1: Filth (dirt cleansing protection) and Step 2: Stroke (double cleansing protection), you should apply Step 3: Fortify (toning protection). After spraying our rose water toner, you should wipe the excess with a cotton wool pad and then check to see if it\u2019s clean. There should be no further traces of dirt or make-up at this stage, a clear indicator that the skin is impeccably clean!\n\nWhat are the best ingredients for double cleansing?\n\nOur oil-based cleanser, Step 1: Filth (dirt cleansing protection), includes organic jojoba oil, organic pumpkin seed oil and organic lemongrass essential oil, along with natural vitamin E to protect against blackheads, whiteheads and keep skin clear. Our water-based cleanser, Step 2: Stroke (double cleansing protection), contains organic aloe vera juice, organic argan oil and ginger essential oil, as well as citric acid, turmeric powder and natural vitamin E to cleanse the skin and assist with any dark marks, old acne scars and hyperpigmentation. These oils are suitable for all skin types and leave the skin feeling hydrated.\n\nHow long before I see any skin development?\n\nIf you are new to using Like It On Top, or considering using our 4-Step Kit for the first time, most of our existing customers see a change within just a few days:\n\nLike It On Top customer, April, said: \u201cI have used this product for just a few days and I am already noticing changes. I have been having terribly sore acne for the past two months and this acne kit has really helped me . It's no longer red and painful and that clay mask is amazing. So it's definitely five stars if it has done so much for me in a couple days.\u201d\n\nLike It On top customer, Alisha, said: \u201cI have only been using the products for a few skin and complexion already looks brighter and clearer...I need to order again so I don't run out!\u201d",

        "text":"Gabrielle\u2019s Style\n\nWedding clothes\n\nCollection 2011 Collection 2010 Collection 2009 Collection 2008 Collection 2007 Flower girl dresses\n\n\nHave all your questions answered below ~ from topics such as fabrics, sizing, fittings, custom made, shipping and ordering.\n\nGeneral Questions:\n\nWhat is the delivery time for orders?\nWe have able to delivery dress very fast. Normally it take 5-8 weeks for Custom orders and delivery time about 6- 14 days for shipping.\n\nWhen should I order?\nPlease place your order as far as in advance of your wedding date as possible, normally can\u2019t less than 1 month. It also affords you a comfortable time frame to accommodate any alterations if necessary.\nWhat is your return policy?\nWe guarantee all our dress with high quality.

We require all orders in writing to avoid errors.\nHow do I pay?\nWe just have 2 payment way, 1, bank transfer\n2, C.O.D \u2013 cash on delivery\nDetails information, email us:\nHow do I decide what size to order?\nEach manufacturer offers their own size chart, So, please decide your size by our size chart. Keep in mind that the measurements are taken to determine the closest size to be ordered and that the garment will not be custom-made to the exact measurements. Almost every gown will need some type of adjustment.\nPrior to selecting your size to order, we suggest reviewing the information provided in How to Measure. The designer will be unable to accommodate any changes to the size once the order has been placed.\nHow will I be notified of my order status?\nWe contact our customers by email at various points of the order process. It is imperative the customer includes an email address on their order.\nThe first email is sent immediately after an order is sent to our email address.

A shipping confirmation email will be sent when your order is shipped from our location and will include the tracking number.\n\n1) How to Choose a Wedding Style\nEveryone thinks they know how to buy a wedding gown. What most women don\u2019t realize is fabrics, style and measurements can influence the style of wedding dress that best compliments a particular body type.\nIf you are a full figured woman the best silhouette is an A- Line. A-line lengthens the whole body without drawing attention to your waistline. The empire waist is another good choice. The empire is narrowest just below the bust and conceals your waist and hips.\nMany plus size girls tend to purchase wedding gowns that cover a lot of skin. If religion isn\u2019t an issue don\u2019t be afraid to show some skin. Skin is sexy and showing your arms and neckline can often make one appear smaller.\nDeep V necks and scoop necks flatter curvy figures and always look best on full figured women.\nA-line wedding dresses are also flattering on a petite women. As we stated earlier it lengthens the body. Sheaths seem to shorten a small body even more. Stay clear of very full skirts. You want to keep your wedding dress in proportion to your body.\nBe careful with strapless.\nA petite woman may have to lift her arms to reach up to her new husband.\nA cap sleeve gives the feeling of a strapless gown and also serves a practical purpose in holding the gown in place.\nOff the shoulder gowns look wonderful on a full bust. It draws our attention upward, emphasizes the shoulders and minimizes the chest. Keep your skirt narrow. Wearing a full skirt will make you look large on top and bottom.\nWomen who are larger through their hips and buttocks should look for a wedding dress that focuses on their upper body preferably with a full skirt. Show your arms back and bust line.\nCorset style bodice with lacing will highlight your upper body. We want to draw attention away from your hips. Avoid pleats or gathered fabric around the waist.\n\n2) Can I see fabric swatches before ordering?\nWe do have fabric swatches available for purchase of only 20 per fabric type such as satin, chiffon and Martin, but you need to pay the shipping cost.\n\n3)How much does shipping cost?\nPlease click here to see our shipping information\n\nDress questions:\n\n1)Can I cancel my gown order if I change my mind?\nWe are a small company that is not able to give refunds on custom-made gowns if you change your mind or payment made are non-refundable.\n\n2) Can I have a gown made to my measurement?\nOf course yes, we do make all sizes.\n\n3) How to measure for your size\nIt is very important that proper measurements be taken before a gown is ordered. Start by carefully taking your measurements using our friendly size guide. For standard size, on average you will need to go up 1 or 2 sizes than what you normally where in sportswear or street clothes. Bridal gowns are meant to have a close fit to the body so they tend to be cut smaller than sportswear.\nTo measure yourself, you must be dressed in only a good fitting bra and underwear. To measure you bust, take the measuring tape around your back at bust level and over your nipples without pulling too tight or leaving too much slack. Do the same at your waist going over your belly button. To properly measure your hip, go around the fullest part of your buttocks, about 7-9 inches below your belly button. Compare these measurements to our size chart and you should have a good fit.\n\n4)What if I don\u2019t see what I want?\nJust ask! Now you have a friend in the gowns business!!! Contact us:\n\n5) Can a gown be made in a plus size?\nYes you can\n\n6) How should I clean my beautiful wedding dress?\nFirst of all, ALWAYS get your dress cleaned after wearing. If it is not cleaned in a reasonable amount of time after wearing a yellowing of the fabric may result from prolonged storage. ALWAYS take your bridal dress to a professional cleaner that specializes in bridal dresses. Your normal cleaner may damage the precious dress by using the wrong chemicals.\n\n7) Is the color of the picture display the same color as the dress?\nNot always. Your monitor and color correction utilities may change the colors. Different brands, lighting in the room, and other variables can also make your eyes receiving different color information. Do not use pictures and magazines as color swatches since different brands of ink on different types of paper may have different feel. Ask the store to show you sample swatches and allow for slight dye-lot difference.\n\nOthers Question.\n\n1, Do you have more pictures for this dress?\nWe are sorry that we are still working on better and more pictures. That is all we have so far. If we get more pictures, we will update our listing.\n\n2, Can I change the color of the embroidery from gold color to silver color?\nYes. We can make the gown with silver embroidery for you.\n\n3, Can I change the color of the dress or the accent of the dress? How much is there extra charge?\nYes. You can change the color of the dress or accent of the dress. But we recommend you to think over before you make any change of style or color. It might not be different from your imagination. And your gown might be delayed due to the color change because we may not have that color in stock and will make special order for you. Please check our color chart and tell us the color number you select and make a special note on the measurement form when you order. We usually don\u2019t charge extra if you only change the color. In case there is extra charge, we will notify you.\n\n5, Can I send you a picture of the gown and you custom make the gown for me?\nYes. We can custom make the gown if you give us clear pictures showing both front and back. But please be aware of that the charge will be much higher than the styles in my list because our designers will have to design it from scratch just for you and it will cost more. I need to contact our designers for quote. And we don\u2019t accept return and refund for custom made gowns.\n\nMore question please contact us:\ntel.n.: 00421 917285879",

        "text":"FAQs: Wigs\n\n\nHow do I wear my wig for the first time?\n\n  1. Remove wig from the plastic bag. Gently remove the protective hair net from your wig. Give your wig a few good shakes to separate the fibres to give some body to the hair. Some wigs need to be shaken to release the pre-set styling.\n  2. Brush your hair away from your face and secure a wig cap in place, tucking in any extra hair.\n  3. Hold your wig at the sides with the woven label in back. Place it at your natural hairline and slide it on from front to back. Adjust the wig as needed so the front edge is just over your natural hairline. Use the ear tabs to centre your wig from left to right. If the wig is too tight undo the hooks at the base of the neck and try again. If the wig is too loose move the hook up a level and retry the wig - repeat until comfortable.\n  4. Tuck in any stray hairs at the front, sides and nape. Use a soft brush to style.\n\n\nWill my wig blow off?\n\nDon't believe what you see in the films...\u00a0 Our wigs are all fully adjustable with 4 internal comb slides for an easy, secure & confident fit.\n\n\nCan I cut my wig?\u00a0\n\nOf course! A little trim is usually hassle free. However, if you are considering restyling or thinning your wig, we highly recommend you take your wig to an experienced hairstylist who will advise you or do this for you.\u00a0\n\n\nCan I colour my wig?\u00a0\n\nOur wigs are made from the latest technology heat style-able hair-like fibre, however, you cannot colour them. Only wigs that are 100% human hair can be coloured.\n\nHow do I store my wig?\n\nThe best way to store your wig is on a\u00a0wig stand. Not only does this help prevent your wig from becoming tangled or flat between wearing, it also helps to maintain your wigs style and shape. Ideally, your wig should be stored in a clean, dry place, away from dust and sources of high heat or flame. If you do not have a wig stand always store your wig turned inside out and place it in a shoe box or similar.\n\n\nHow do I wash my wig?\n\nYou must wash and care for your wig if you want it to last. Treat it with the care that you would treat your own hair. Brush it, wash it & love it. Here's a full step-by-step guide on how to care for your wig.\n\n\nHow do I know if a wig will fit?\n\nAll of our wigs are unisex sizing and will fit a head circumference of up to 23.5\u201d. Our wigs are also adjustable using the hooks at the nape of the neck. Find the right setting for comfort and confidence. If you\u2019re unsure, place a tape measure around the widest part of your head and measure the circumference, if it's under 24 inches you will find all our wigs comfortable.\n\n\nCan I use heat appliances on my wig?\n\nSince March 2010 all of our synthetic hair fibre wigs have been made with heat friendly fibre unless otherwise stated on the listing description. The fibre can take heat up to 180 degrees, so ensure that your chosen heat appliance has adjustable heat settings.\n\n\nAre your wigs made with 100% human hair?\n\nNo, the majority of our wigs are made from the latest technology heat style-able hair-like fibre, and some are blended with human hair to give a softer touch and an even more realistic look. We pride ourselves on offering fantastic quality wigs at reasonable and affordable prices, and selling 100% human hair wigs will not allow us to do this. Not only this but synthetic wigs need much less maintenance in order to keep looking gorgeous and hold their pre-set style perfectly.\n\n\nHow do choose the right style of wig?\n\nThere's a great technique for this... Know your face shape!\n\n\nHow do I choose the right colour of wig?\n\nIf you want to play it safe and you're aiming to achieve a natural look then try to stick to something close to your natural hair colour \/ a shade that will compliment your skin tone. Don't be afraid to try something a little out there though - you never know what might suit!\n\n\nI'm suffering with hair loss; which cap is most suitable for me?\n\nWe have a small but growing range of monofilament wigs that are great for this purpose. They allow multi-directional styling for a natural feel and they are made with a light and breathable cap. Here's everything you need to know about monofilament top cap wigs. If you'd like to know more about how we can help you, click here.\n\n\nWhat's a lace front wig?\n\nLace front wigs create the illusion of a natural hairline and can therefore be styled away from the face. The sheer lace material can be trimmed to fit your own hairline achieving an incredibly realistic and natural look. Our lace front wigs can be used with or without lace glue. You can also put a little foundation on the lace to blend perfectly into your own skin.\n\n\nCan I have a bespoke wig made for me by CelebWigs?\n\nUnfortunately, we don't make bespoke wigs, however, all of our wigs are designed in-house so we are very open to hearing any ideas our customers have for future designs.\n\n\nStill Have Questions? Don't Hesitate to\u00a0Contact Us...\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nGet the latest updates on new products and upcoming sales\n\nNo thanks",

As a person of Scottish heritage you may wear any of those.\n\nI am not Scottish! Can I wear a kilt?\nOf course you can! Even if you don\u2019t have a Scottish clan or family name there are many Universal tartans that you can wear. For example: Black Watch, Caledonian, and Jacobite, Scottish National, Scottish National dress, National, Brave Heart Warrior (both dress and hunting), Flower of Scotland and Pride of Scotland.\n\nHow do I wear a kilt?\nA gentlemen\u2019s kilt closes right apron to left buckle through the hole and fastened to the left buckle.

When fastening the waist if the tartan lines pulls you have it too tight, let it rest on your hips. The pleats should be at the back of the kilt.\n\nHow do I wear a sporran?\nThe sporran should be centered to the front of the kilt, 3 fingers below the waistcoat, or belt, be careful that it does not hang too low. The strap should fasten to the rear and rest on the hips.\n\nWhat do the different terms associated with tartans mean, for example Ancient or Modern; Hunting or Dress?\nThe first thing many people ask is what is a \u201cDress\u201d tartan or a \u201cHunting\u201d tartan. Tartans often come in Modern, Ancient, Hunting , and Dress to name most. Many of the larger Clans have specialty tartans. The \u201cModern\u201d tartan in the most commonly woven tartan and usually the accepted \u201cstandard\u201d tartan for a Clan. The ancient series is an attempt by weavers to duplicate what the tartans would have looked like, back when. Usually this is the same \u201csett\u201d or pattern as the modern but with faded colors. The \u201cDress\u201d tartans are most commonly worn by women, as tey have a large amount of white and are a brighter look. The hunting tartans are usually made to offset a bright color modern tartan. Made in earth tones to do exactly that, hunt. When looking at a list of tartans you will see a letter following the name and these are A =Ancient, M =Modern, W =Weathered, Mtd =Muted .\n\nHow do I wear kilt hose?\nThe kilt hose (socks) should be 2 to 3 fingers below the knee cap.\n\nHow do I wear flashes?\nThese should be worn on the outside of the leg, bringing the sock turnover down to cover half the double loop of the flash.\n\nHow do I wear a Sgian Dhub?\nThe sgian Dhub (black knife) is normally worn down the right sock, although a left handed person could wear it on the left leg. Only the top inch should show above the sock.\n\nHow do I wear Ghillie Brogues?\nTo tie the laces on the Ghille Brogue, cross the laces, pull them tight in a simple knot. Then twist three times and pull tight again to create a vertical thong. Now pass the laces around the back of the ankle and bring to the front and tie a normal bow, the remaining lace and toggles should hang to the front.\n\nWhen can I wear a kilt?\nThere is not a single situation where you can not wear a kilt. A man\u2019s kilt can be dressed up to wear to a Fancy Ball or a wedding, where you would wear a tuxedo, and can also be worn with casual shoes and shirt to go hiking or out for a pint.\n\nWhat is the correct outfit for different events?\nFormal Dress: this can be worn on occasions when a dinner suit or tuxedo would be worn such as a wedding or ball\nSemi Dress: suitable for less formal occasions such as a ceilidh.\n\nWhat types of kilt are there?\nEssentially there are two types of kilt; the Feileadh Mor (also known as Geat Kilt or Breacan Feile) and the Feileadh Beg which is the more common type of kilt. The Feileadh Mor (pronouncied \u2018phili more\u2019 ),is really just one length of double width tartan, usually 6-7 yds in length which is gathered into pleats and belted round the waist. The Feileadh Beg is a hand or machine sewn garment which is worn just above the hip and fastened by buckles. If you are looking for a kilt \u2013 chances are its this one you want.\n\nHow much material is in a kilt?\nGenerally a Kilt is 8 Yds in a kilt \u2013 however if the kilt is for a larger person this can be 9 or more. Kilts can also be made with less material, the pleats being shallower. Therfore this can vary from 7 down to as little as 4yds.\n\nWhat are the different weights of tartan?\nKilting Tartan comes in three weights; lightweight, medium weight and heavyweight. Lightweight is 10oz per linear yd, Medium is 13oz and heavyweight is 16oz. In general medium weight is a good all round weight.\n\nWhat is the difference between Modern, Ancient, Hunting etc?\nAncient: This term has nothing to do with the age of the tartan, it is simply a term used to denote that the thread colours used replicate the colours that would have been produced using vegetable dyes. Therefore ancient tartans have a more faded look.\nModern: when new synthetic \u2018aniline\u2019 dyes were developed the vividness of colour that could be achieved was improved dramatically. Modern tartans are usually a much stronger colour.\nMuted & Reproduction: A more faded version of ancient colours.\nDress: In a dress tartan the \u2018ground\u2019 colour (dominant base colour of the design) is white.\nHunting: A version of the tartan where the colours are darker \u2013 with predominant greens & dark blues, designed to be less conspicuous.\n\nIf you have any questions which were not answered by our Frequently Asked Questions, please contact us.",
