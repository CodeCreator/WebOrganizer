I have asked lots of stuff from them, and as long as you CHECK YOUR MEASUREMENTS (in caps because those are Asian sizes), everything\u2019s great. However: you get what you pay for.

        "text":"Use FIRST15 for 15% off first order \/ FREE USA & CANADA SHIPPING OVER $75 \/ Shipping 5-10 days\n\nWhat is double cleansing and why should we do it?\n\nWhat is double cleansing?\n\nDouble cleansing is the process of cleansing the skin twice, as in a two-step process, to provide the skin with a \u201cdeep clean\u201d. Our 4-Step Kit skincare routine features a double cleanse process with step 1 being Filth (dirt cleansing protection) with a natural cleansing oil. The ingredients are ALL natural and designed to dissolve oil-based dirt such as make-up, sunscreen, sebum (oil) and daily pollution from the epidermis (outer layer of skin). Some sources say that double cleansing is an Asian skincare phenomenon which dates back as far as the fourteenth century and originated in Japan, Korea or China.\n\nShould I double cleanse morning and night?\n\nWe recommend using our 4-Step Kit skincare routine to double cleanse twice per day, in the morning and night. In the mornings we tend to see a build up of overnight sebum (oil) and dirt on our face.\n\nI have oily skin; can I use an oil cleanser?\n\nWith oily or acne prone skin you must keep skin hydrated, because if it gets too dry it will overproduce oil, which can cause more acne. Face oil can clear blemishes, soften irritated skin, brighten and remove acne scars. It can also act as a nourishing moisturiser to balance sebum (oil) production and calm the sweat glands.\n\nWill an oil cleanser make my skin breakout even more?\n\nThis could be the case if you use Step 1: Filth (dirt cleansing protection) but fail to remove this oil cleanser properly with Step 2: Stroke (double cleansing protection). It\u2019s really important that you use the water-based cleanser to remove any residual oil and dirt, otherwise you may clog your pores. Just be sure to apply the water-based cleanser, Stroke (double cleansing protection), by rubbing to create a lather so that it cleans the skin.\n\nHow do I know it\u2019s working?\n\nAfter cleansing with Step 1: Filth (dirt cleansing protection) and Step 2: Stroke (double cleansing protection), you should apply Step 3: Fortify (toning protection). After spraying our rose water toner, you should wipe the excess with a cotton wool pad and then check to see if it\u2019s clean. There should be no further traces of dirt or make-up at this stage, a clear indicator that the skin is impeccably clean!\n\nWhat are the best ingredients for double cleansing?\n\nOur oil-based cleanser, Step 1: Filth (dirt cleansing protection), includes organic jojoba oil, organic pumpkin seed oil and organic lemongrass essential oil, along with natural vitamin E to protect against blackheads, whiteheads and keep skin clear. Our water-based cleanser, Step 2: Stroke (double cleansing protection), contains organic aloe vera juice, organic argan oil and ginger essential oil, as well as citric acid, turmeric powder and natural vitamin E to cleanse the skin and assist with any dark marks, old acne scars and hyperpigmentation. These oils are suitable for all skin types and leave the skin feeling hydrated.\n\nHow long before I see any skin development?\n\nIf you are new to using Like It On Top, or considering using our 4-Step Kit for the first time, most of our existing customers see a change within just a few days:\n\nLike It On Top customer, April, said: \u201cI have used this product for just a few days and I am already noticing changes. I have been having terribly sore acne for the past two months and this acne kit has really helped me . It's no longer red and painful and that clay mask is amazing. So it's definitely five stars if it has done so much for me in a couple days.\u201d\n\nLike It On top customer, Alisha, said: \u201cI have only been using the products for a few skin and complexion already looks brighter and clearer...I need to order again so I don't run out!\u201d",

Normally it take 5-8 weeks for Custom orders and delivery time about 6- 14 days for shipping.\n\nWhen should I order?\nPlease place your order as far as in advance of your wedding date as possible, normally can\u2019t less than 1 month. It also affords you a comfortable time frame to accommodate any alterations if necessary.\nWhat is your return policy?\nWe guarantee all our dress with high quality. If our dress not good quality, customer can return back the dress. But we can\u2019t accept return dress for custom cut order.\nAll sales are final and cannot be cancelled at the point of purchase.\nPlease be sure of the style, size, color, and any other specifications before submitting your order.\nHow can I see a swatch of the color I\u2019m interested in before I order?\nSorry, the shipping cost is very expensive, so we do not have swatches available to send out to customers. we can just send our color chart and product cd to our wholesaler with their order.\nYou can confirm the dress color by two ways, as follow:\n1, view our color chart, choose color on internet.\n2, send me a color picture, and we will tell you if we have this color for your dress.\nNote: Not any extra cost for color change.\nCan I place my order over the phone?\nWe do not accept phone orders. We require all orders in writing to avoid errors.\nHow do I pay?\nWe just have 2 payment way, 1, bank transfer\n2, C.O.D \u2013 cash on delivery\nDetails information, email us:\nHow do I decide what size to order?\nEach manufacturer offers their own size chart, So, please decide your size by our size chart. Keep in mind that the measurements are taken to determine the closest size to be ordered and that the garment will not be custom-made to the exact measurements. Almost every gown will need some type of adjustment.\nPrior to selecting your size to order, we suggest reviewing the information provided in How to Measure. The designer will be unable to accommodate any changes to the size once the order has been placed.\nHow will I be notified of my order status?\nWe contact our customers by email at various points of the order process. It is imperative the customer includes an email address on their order.\nThe first email is sent immediately after an order is sent to our email address. The next email is sent 7 \u2013 10 business days thereafter to confirm your order has been placed with the designer and will include the estimated shipping of your order to our location. A shipping confirmation email will be sent when your order is shipped from our location and will include the tracking number.\n\n1) How to Choose a Wedding Style\nEveryone thinks they know how to buy a wedding gown. What most women don\u2019t realize is fabrics, style and measurements can influence the style of wedding dress that best compliments a particular body type.\nIf you are a full figured woman the best silhouette is an A- Line. A-line lengthens the whole body without drawing attention to your waistline. The empire waist is another good choice. The empire is narrowest just below the bust and conceals your waist and hips.\nMany plus size girls tend to purchase wedding gowns that cover a lot of skin. If religion isn\u2019t an issue don\u2019t be afraid to show some skin. Skin is sexy and showing your arms and neckline can often make one appear smaller.\nDeep V necks and scoop necks flatter curvy figures and always look best on full figured women.\nA-line wedding dresses are also flattering on a petite women. As we stated earlier it lengthens the body. Sheaths seem to shorten a small body even more. Stay clear of very full skirts. You want to keep your wedding dress in proportion to your body.\nBe careful with strapless.\nA petite woman may have to lift her arms to reach up to her new husband.\nA cap sleeve gives the feeling of a strapless gown and also serves a practical purpose in holding the gown in place.\nOff the shoulder gowns look wonderful on a full bust. It draws our attention upward, emphasizes the shoulders and minimizes the chest. Keep your skirt narrow. Wearing a full skirt will make you look large on top and bottom.\nWomen who are larger through their hips and buttocks should look for a wedding dress that focuses on their upper body preferably with a full skirt. Show your arms back and bust line.\nCorset style bodice with lacing will highlight your upper body. We want to draw attention away from your hips. Avoid pleats or gathered fabric around the waist.\n\n2) Can I see fabric swatches before ordering?\nWe do have fabric swatches available for purchase of only 20 per fabric type such as satin, chiffon and Martin, but you need to pay the shipping cost.\n\n3)How much does shipping cost?\nPlease click here to see our shipping information\n\nDress questions:\n\n1)Can I cancel my gown order if I change my mind?\nWe are a small company that is not able to give refunds on custom-made gowns if you change your mind or payment made are non-refundable.\n\n2) Can I have a gown made to my measurement?\nOf course yes, we do make all sizes.\n\n3) How to measure for your size\nIt is very important that proper measurements be taken before a gown is ordered. Start by carefully taking your measurements using our friendly size guide. For standard size, on average you will need to go up 1 or 2 sizes than what you normally where in sportswear or street clothes. Bridal gowns are meant to have a close fit to the body so they tend to be cut smaller than sportswear.\nTo measure yourself, you must be dressed in only a good fitting bra and underwear. To measure you bust, take the measuring tape around your back at bust level and over your nipples without pulling too tight or leaving too much slack. Do the same at your waist going over your belly button. To properly measure your hip, go around the fullest part of your buttocks, about 7-9 inches below your belly button. Compare these measurements to our size chart and you should have a good fit.\n\n4)What if I don\u2019t see what I want?\nJust ask! Now you have a friend in the gowns business!!! Contact us:\n\n5) Can a gown be made in a plus size?\nYes you can\n\n6) How should I clean my beautiful wedding dress?\nFirst of all, ALWAYS get your dress cleaned after wearing. If it is not cleaned in a reasonable amount of time after wearing a yellowing of the fabric may result from prolonged storage. ALWAYS take your bridal dress to a professional cleaner that specializes in bridal dresses. Your normal cleaner may damage the precious dress by using the wrong chemicals.\n\n7) Is the color of the picture display the same color as the dress?\nNot always. Your monitor and color correction utilities may change the colors. Different brands, lighting in the room, and other variables can also make your eyes receiving different color information. Do not use pictures and magazines as color swatches since different brands of ink on different types of paper may have different feel. Ask the store to show you sample swatches and allow for slight dye-lot difference.\n\nOthers Question.\n\n1, Do you have more pictures for this dress?\nWe are sorry that we are still working on better and more pictures. That is all we have so far. If we get more pictures, we will update our listing.\n\n2, Can I change the color of the embroidery from gold color to silver color?\nYes. We can make the gown with silver embroidery for you.\n\n3, Can I change the color of the dress or the accent of the dress? How much is there extra charge?\nYes. You can change the color of the dress or accent of the dress. But we recommend you to think over before you make any change of style or color. It might not be different from your imagination. And your gown might be delayed due to the color change because we may not have that color in stock and will make special order for you. Please check our color chart and tell us the color number you select and make a special note on the measurement form when you order. We usually don\u2019t charge extra if you only change the color. In case there is extra charge, we will notify you.\n\n5, Can I send you a picture of the gown and you custom make the gown for me?\nYes. We can custom make the gown if you give us clear pictures showing both front and back. But please be aware of that the charge will be much higher than the styles in my list because our designers will have to design it from scratch just for you and it will cost more. I need to contact our designers for quote. And we don\u2019t accept return and refund for custom made gowns.\n\nMore question please contact us:\ntel.n.: 00421 917285879",
