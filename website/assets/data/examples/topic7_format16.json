        "text":"Positive Parenting Handbook\n\n$12.00 Regular price $17.00\n\nPositive Parents = Calm, Confident, Happy Kids\n\nPut the FUN back into parenting with this one-of-a-kind Positive Parenting Handbook, loved by hundreds of happy parents, your one-stop shop to quickly create a calm, happy home without eating up your entire day, or breaking the bank.\n\nSo often, I've heard parents brush off their children's tantrums, backtalk, excessive worry, or power struggles along with THEIR OWN frustration, exhaustion, and resentment, thinking that things will magically get better in a few years. News alert: They don't; they usually get worse.\n\nYou never expected parenting to be a breeze, but you didn't expect to be knocked flat off your feet.\n\nMany days emotions boil over; your senses are under full assault, and you've lost your space, your time. Your identity is as blurred as your sticky-fingered windows.\n\nAnd when you've reached your last limit, you silently complain, rage, yell, or cry. Oh, how we cry.\n\nSocial media images are banging you over the head, showing us perfect got-it-together moms and their always adorable (and coordinated) kids, and this might negatively affect how you view your own family. You'd love to ask that mom how she handles a tantrum or backtalk, but that would mean admitting you aren't quite sure what to do. (Besides, do her kids even have tantrums?)\n\nAnd many nights, you fall into bed exhausted, worried, and feeling guilty, wondering just how screwed up the kids will be.\n\nBut here's the thing:\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way.\n\nTo have a calm and happy future with your family, you have to make changes today.\n\nSo you might ask, \"How on earth can I shape this tiny human into a healthy, well-adjusted adult?\"\n\nWell, friend, don't panic! Take a deep breath because this is where positive parenting comes in. Parenting is about more than just getting the kids to behave. It's about better family relationships, increased joy and connection, and raising resilient tiny humans.\n\nThe Positive Parenting handbook gives parents anywhere, on any budget, the power to transform their families TODAY. Real parents, real results!\n\nThis is a 150-page instant digital download. You can read it on your computer or phone or print it out.\n\nPlease note:\u00a0 This is a digital product, and nothing will be mailed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49--The Positive Parenting Handbook is also found in our popular Positive Parenting Toolkit, which gives parents, teachers, or practitioners access to 100's of printable resources for one highly discounted price. You can find the Positive Parenting Toolkit right here.\n\nIntentional parenting allows you to...\n\n\u2026save energy for the things that matter most so you can\u00a0help your child navigate challenges,\u00a0connect to your kiddo's heart, and spend more time on the things you love. Support, empower, prepare and equip\u00a0your kids to handle anything that is thrown their way.\n\n\n\nIf you purchased a digital product, please note:\n\n  \u2022 If you purchased a digital product. Nothing will be mailed.\n  \u2022 US letter page size (fits into a three-ring binder)\u00a0\n  \u2022 High printing quality and bright colors.\u00a0\n  \u2022 There are no refunds or returns on digital products.\n  \u2022 Each license (purchase) on digital products is valid for one person. These\u00a0resources are for non-commercial use only. This PDF file may not be distributed for free or for any form of compensation.\n\nIf you would like to use these digital kits as part of a practice you charge for, you must purchase a professional license. Please reach out to tina@mindfulmazing.com for more information.\n\n\nFor charts and cards I recommend printing on\u00a0thick stock paper, so it's easier to hang, not as flimsy, and can handle some wear \u2018n\u2019 tear.\n\nFor worksheets, activities and guides, I recommend printing and keeping securely in a three ring binder. Easy Peasy.\n\nIf you've purchased a handy chart or set of cards, this isn't necessary, but boy oh boy, it sure skyrockets\u00a0things to the next level of fun. Do you have a laminator? (If you don't have one, I like this one). Laminate your resources (amazing). We all know kids are hard on things, so now you won't have to keep printing your chart and cards every time they get a little beat up.\n\nMany of our charts also use Velcro stickers. And this is the icing on the cake.\u00a0Attach one side of the Velcro sticker to the task card, and one side to the chart. Ensure that you don't mix up the sides. (i.e., the \"hook\" side should be on the chart, and the \"furry\" side on the cards.) Now you can move the cards around at your leisure. (Plus it's SUPER fun for kids).",
