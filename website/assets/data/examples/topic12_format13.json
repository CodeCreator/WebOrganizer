As you will be aware social distancing means we aren\u2019t able to come out and talk to groups so we have created a virtual platform to allow us to communicate with local residents. Whilst the virtual approach can\u2019t replicate face to face meetings in every way, you can join in with questions verbally, or via the chat box, and prior to the meeting starting you can join and get technical advice, or support with how to use the digital platform we use, which is Microsoft Teams. We also have a BSL interpreter pre booked for every session so if this is something you require please email us and we can ensure we have this option available for you on the day.\n\nWe have created a page with previous session summaries, slides and recordings so if you would like to read about them or share with your networks, they can be found here:\n\nIf you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with me directly or our enquiries line:\nMiriam Doherty\nCommunications, Equality and Involvement Officer\nNHS Derby and Derbyshire Clinical Commissioning Group\nT:\u00a0\u00a001332 868 730",

For example, recent sessions were based on a quiz to see how much the young people knew about correct use of condoms, STIs, and the \u2018C-Card\u2019 free condom scheme.\u00a0 These sessions were delivered to separate groups of males and females; some of the young people found discussion difficult to join, but were encouraged by those who already knew more about the subject. Thirteen young men registered for the C-Card as a result of the sessions.\n\nThe young people heard from a speaker from \u2018Hertsaid\u2019, the charity that strives for an inclusive society where HIV and sexual health are understood and accepted. Future sessions are planned on drugs and alcohol awareness, to be delivered by Youth Connexions staff.\n\nOne of the participants, George, said \u201cI love coming to the centre\u201d \u00a0Dean and Melissa, other attendees, added that \u201cThe project brings young people together.\u201d\n\nFind out more about the Peartree project.\n\nFind a Youth Connexions project near you.",

Shoppers Drug Mart has 1,149 stores in nine provinces and two territories in addition to Pharmaprix in Quebec.\n\nIn May of 2009, the Today Sponge returned to store shelves across the United States in more than 20,000 drugstore locations including CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid. \u00a0It quickly became the #2 best selling Female OTC Contraceptive in the United States and is the fastest growing brand in this category.\n\nOriginally introduced in 1983, the Today Sponge affords the freedom and flexibility of 24 hour contraceptive protection, and offers a safe, effective, hormone-free birth control alternative for millions of women. \u00a0The Today Sponge has been a popular over-the-counter birth control method for women, with over 150 million sponges sold since its introduction.\n\nAccording to David Mayer, CEO of Mayer Labs, \"We are pleased to re-launch the Today Sponge in Canada. The Today Sponge is an important hormone-free birth control option for women and has always remained popular with many advantages. The recent interruption of distribution was not due to product quality or lack of consumer interest, but was the result of the previous owner's bankruptcy.\" Mayer Labs will be supporting the product with a national marketing campaign to inform women of the product's return. Suggested retail price for a 3 pack box - C$18.49-$18.99.\n\nAbout The Today\u00ae Sponge\n\nThe Today Sponge is a soft polyurethane sponge containing nonoxynol 9, a spermicide used by millions of women for more than 40 years. \u00a0 The Today Sponge prevents pregnancy in 3 ways: \u00a01) by blocking the sperm's path 2) by absorbing the sperm and 3) by continuously releasing nonoxynol 9, which quickly kills the sperm on contact.

        "text":"\u00bb Sweet Taste of Success\n\nOne family in Ireland has done an amazing job and raised over 3000 Euros, through their fundraising efforts. We were recently contacted by CdLS mum, Melissa Coleman from County Cork, with a fantastic recipe for fundraising. Melissa has a daughter with CdLS, Tabitha, who turned 5 in February.\n\nShe has a friend, Natalie Keane, who runs a craft Chocolate business with her sister. The company is called Bean & Goose and they make a range of chocolate bars with some incredible flavours. Natalie knew of Tabitha and her condition and kindly offered to donate around 50 large bars of her chocolate to raise money for the Foundation. She wanted nothing for her costs, so all profit would go to us.\n\nBean and Goose Chocolate BarWhen Melissa told us, she asked if we could help with creating an awareness raising band around the hand-packaged bars. Of course, we were delighted to help. One of the flavourings of the donated bars was lavender, in honour of our CdLS colours.\n\nThe bars could only be sold in Ireland, so no shipping costs were incurred but they sold out very, very quickly, making nearly \u20ac300 for us. They also were a very effective way of raising awareness of CdLS, with some informative text about the syndrome and a picture.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Tabitha\u2019s dad, Liam Coleman managed to have the Foundation nominated as one of the charities supported by the company he works for, Eli Lily, for their Christmas charity day. Based in Kinsale, County Cork, Eli Lily held their fundrasing day in December. They raised a massive \u20ac3,200 for CdLS.\n\nCdLS Christmas CardsIrish Regional Volunteer, Eleanor O\u2019Kelly-Lynch has also had a seasonal scheme to raise funds and awareness. She put together some CdLS-branded Christmas Cards for Irish families. Eleanor says; \u201cThe CdLS Christmas card idea was a great success and we will definitely make them an annual fundraising event, judging by the interest we got. We got 1000 cards printed and could have easily sold another 500. Everyone got behind the idea and families ordered them in multiple packs of ten. Thanks to Jenkinson Logistics for paying full cost on design and print which meant every cent raised went to CdLS Foundation - a real bonus giving us \u00a0a total of \u20ac1080.\u201d\n\nOur huge thanks go to Melissa, Liam and Eleanor. What a sweet way to raise money and awareness for CdLS!",
