But the sad fact is that while men are aware of their mental struggles, societal taboos and stigma lead to many suffering in silence.\n\nBy simply talking with one another, men can improve their mental health.\n\nThe LightOn mental health campaign\n\nThis week has been Men\u2019s Health Week, so we invited Andrew Coleman, one of the founders of the LightOn mental health campaign, to join us to explore how we can support ourselves, friends, family members and colleagues.\n\nLightOn is a mental wellbeing campaign by the people of Dorset, for Dorset. It gives men permission and an opportunity to talk about mental health.\n\nIn his open and honest presentation, Andrew talked about his own experiences with his mental health. He explained that one of the hardest steps we can take is to open up. But when you show vulnerability, it gives others permission to open up.\n\nHuman beings are instinctively community-based, and LightOn gives men that community \u2013 space \u2018beyond the banter\u2019 to share stories, experiences, information and support.\n\nYou can connect with the LightOn campaign through their website, on Twitter, Instagram (especially during their \u2018Talk More Tuesdays\u201d Insta-chats at 7pm on Tuesdays), LinkedIn and Facebook.\n\nYou can watch the recording of Andrew\u2019s presentation here:\n\nWhere to find help\n\nThis Here For Each Other staff wellbeing website has lots of resources you can use to manage feelings of anxiety and stress, or around things such as sleep problems and bereavement.\n\nBut you may feel that you would really benefit from some 1:1 support. Why not refer yourself into our staff wellbeing service? Referrals are straightforward \u2013 take a look at the referrals page for more information. Read more about our team and how the service works.\n\nMental health services\n\nUsing the Five Ways to Wellbeing\n\nThe Men\u2019s Health Forum (MHF) says that:\n\n\u201cEven before the pandemic, men\u2019s mental health was a cause for concern. There is a grave disparity in the high number of men who die from suicide and the low number of men who seek treatment for depression, anxiety and other mental health challenges.\u201d\n\nThe MHF has been promoting the Five Ways to Wellbeing \u2013 five things we can all do that are scientifically-proven to help us feel better \u2013 through its CAN DO Challenge:\n\n  \u2022 Connect \u2013 connect with other people (eg. call an old friend you haven\u2019t since before lockdown) #connectmonday\n  \u2022 (Be)\u00a0Active \u2013 move your body (eg. go for a run\/walk\/swim\/dance\/etc) #activetuesday\n  \u2022 Notice \u2013 take notice of the environment around you (eg. turn off your phone for an hour) #noticewednesday\n  \u2022 Discover \u2013 learn something new (eg. read a book you haven\u2019t read before) #discoverthursday\n  \u2022 Offer (or give) \u2013 do something for someone else (eg. volunteer for a local community group) #offerfriday\n\nFind out more about the Five Ways to Wellbeing\n\nAs well as our content about the Five Ways \u2013 Be active, Connect, Give back, Keep learning, Take notice (mindfulness) \u2013 colleagues from Live Well Dorset will be joining us in the next few weeks for two specific sessions on the Five Ways to Wellbeing:",

This year, we\u2019ve seen their dedication, commitment, and\u00a0courage day after day. They have protected our families and friends, provided comfort to our loved ones when we couldn\u2019t be there, and risked their own lives to save\u00a0others.

With this commitment from Merck for Mothers, Merck has contributed or committed more than $11 million to COVID-19 relief efforts thus far. This support has included donations of medicines, protective personal equipment (PPE) donations for health care providers and funding to relief organizations, including the United Nations Foundation\u2019s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund in support of the World Health Organization and to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Foundation Emergency Response Fund.\n\nTo learn more about how Merck is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, please visit www.merck.com.\n\nRead the press release here.\n\n\n\nAbout Merck\nFor more than 125 years, Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world\u2019s most challenging diseases in pursuit of our mission to save and improve lives.\n\nAbout Merck for Mothers\nMerck for Mothers is our company\u2019s $500 million initiative to create a world where no woman has to die giving life.

Because of this information, you are a more knowledgeable consumer who expects a higher level of service, and we want to meet your expectations.\n\nYou deserve to make an informed decision about your health care, and we\u2019re determined to help you do that. That\u2019s why we display doctor ratings and comments from patients on our website for the public to see. We supply this data through Press Ganey, the leading independent patient satisfaction firm. The data presented is not edited or excluded, and we take their findings--both good and bad--very seriously. By sharing this information with you, we know it will provide value for you and your family\u2019s health.\n\nThe Press Ganey Survey Process\n\n  1. After an appointment, patients receive an email with a brief survey about their experience at the clinic and with their dentist and staff.\n  2. Patients complete the survey online with the link and access code provided.\n  3. Press Ganey organizes the results and sends them to our clinics where they are reviewed. Our team members respond to feedback and implement changes that will improve future patient experiences.\n  4. We post the doctor ratings and comments anonymously on our website for potential patients to see. Each doctor profile page* features an overall five-point rating for the doctor, nine ratings based on specific questions related to the patient\u2019s interaction with the doctor, and unedited comments from patients. In addition, we also post the overall patient rating for each of our clinics.\n\n* Doctors need a certain number of surveys returned before their results are statistically valid. Thus, some newer doctors many not have patient ratings and comments on their profile page (yet).\n\nTrustworthy and Honest Online Dentist Reviews\n\nOur transparency with patients led us to winning the \u201cLeaders in Transparency\u201d award from Press Ganey, which confirmed that we\u2019ve implemented techniques to accurately collect our patients\u2019 experiences and share them online with you.

Additionally, an orientation, regarding the current status of sanitation and the subsequent jobs created in the sanitation sector was also provided to the individuals visiting the expo. ENPHO with the support of CAWST organized the toilet expo at its office premises, New Baneshwor on 19 November 2016 commemorating the World Toilet Day 2016.\n\n\nThe expo featured a display section with models of toilets promoted by ENPHO along with sanitary ware that are commercially available in the market. The commercially available sanitary ware were provided for the expo by Parryware. The expo highlighted the fact that toilets are an integral part of sanitation system and a wide range of toilets exist spanning a wide market to meet current development demands. Additionally, with the national target for the achievement of 100% sanitation coverage by 2017, demands for toilets and related sanitary-ware have increased. The need of collaboration amongst NGOs, INGOs with the private sectors have been felt in order to create linkages in urban and rural areas to ultimately benefit the total sanitation coverage effort. All experts in the sector agree that the need of sustainable total sanitation would be better met with the advent of a partnership between all sectors; private, governmental, and NGO\u2019s and INGO\u2019s. The expo was an attempt to capitalize on the occasion of World Toilet Day 2016 to create one of the first entry points for the creation of a platform for such cooperation and partnerships. Altogether, 123 individuals including school students, architects, engineers and representatives from various organizations participated in the expo and orientation session.",

The two organizations will create a specialized curriculum to reach young people participating in Wyman\u2019s innovative Teen Outreach Program\u00ae (TOP\u00ae).\n\nLegacy, the national public health organization best known for its award-winning truth\u00ae youth tobacco prevention campaign, and Wyman, a Saint Louis-based nonprofit with more than 117 years\u2019 experience helping teens from economically disadvantaged circumstances, have agreed to collaborate on a one-year project to develop and test a tobacco control and substance abuse supplement to Wyman\u2019s successful youth programming.\n\nTOP is a results-driven youth development approach that transforms teens and communities by empowering teens with the tools and opportunities needed to avoid risky behaviors and build a foundation of healthy behaviors, life skills and a sense of purpose.\n\n\u201cLegacy can\u2019t end the tobacco epidemic without partners like Wyman who share our commitment to empowering young people and to achieving health equity,\u201d said Robin Koval, CEO and President of Legacy. \u201cTogether we will build on the TOP program and take on the challenge of ending tobacco\u2019s reign as the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.\u201d\n\nVia a grant from Legacy to Wyman, the organizations are building a seven-lesson tobacco and substance abuse curriculum to strengthen youth knowledge about tobacco, change youth attitudes toward tobacco and engage young people as tobacco control activists. Two sites within Wyman\u2019s National Network will pilot the curriculum. More than 400 teens will participate in the pilots that will launch this fall. A third party evaluator will assess pilot outcomes and publish results in 2016.\n\nTOP uses community service learning to help teens understand local issues and exercise the self-confidence, voice, advocacy, decision-making and priority-setting skills they develop as part of the program. The pilot will engage teens in tobacco control service learning experiences as well as participant-led local youth activism projects.\n\n\u201cThis is a truly compelling opportunity to add another level of health advocacy to our work,\u201d said Joe Miller, Wyman\u2019s Senior Vice President of Partnerships and External Affairs. \u201cThis collaboration will further improve the lives and potential of TOP participants and trigger a positive ripple effect in communities where youth are most at risk of tobacco use.\u201d\n\nTOP is offered to teens in grades six through 12 at in-school, after-school and community settings via 68 partners and 300 providers in urban and rural environments nationwide. One of the most successful, cost-effective and highly-respected, evidence-based programs for teens in the U.S., TOP has been proven to reduce the risk of problem behavior and to increase healthy choices. To date, more than 600,000 young people have participated in Wyman\u2019s programs.\n\nSince its inception, Legacy has recognized the importance of youth activists in the fight against tobacco use. Legacy actively supports the efforts of young people who are ready to make a difference with programming that includes fellowships, hands-on training and expert-led presentations to develop the next generation of youth and young adult tobacco control leaders.\n\nLegacy envisions an America where tobacco is a thing of the past, where all youth and young adults reject tobacco use. Legacy\u2019s proven-effective and nationally recognized public education programs include truth\u00ae, the national youth smoking prevention campaign that has been cited as contributing to significant declines in youth smoking; EX\u00ae, an innovative public health program designed to speak to smokers in their own language and change the way they approach quitting; and research initiatives exploring the causes, consequences and approaches to reducing tobacco use. Located in Washington, D.C., the foundation was created as a result of the November 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) reached between attorneys general from 46 states, five U.S. territories and the tobacco industry.

        "text":"Our Stories\n\nLay health educators could improve cancer screening rates among South Asians in Peel Region, new study suggests\n\nToronto, March 13, 2017\n\nBy Kelly O'Brien\n\nDr. Aisha Lofters\nDr. Aisha Lofters\n\nEmbedding lay health educators in family physicians\u2019 offices may have the potential to improve cancer screening rates among South Asians living in Peel Region, according to a small new study.\n\nFour family physicians embedded lay health educators, or \u201chealth ambassadors,\u201d in their practices in the hopes of improving cancer screening for their South Asian patients, according to a pilot study published today in Patient Preference and Adherence.\n\nThe health ambassadors were volunteers with the Canadian Cancer Society\u2019s Screening Saves Lives program. They were all of South Asian ethnicity and had participated in a four-session training program. Most health ambassadors were foreign-trained physicians who were not practicing medicine in Canada, but some were non-physician members of the South Asian community with strong social networks. They were trained by the Cancer Society to share screening messages with their peers and social networks.\n\nPeel Region \u2013 a Toronto-area regional municipality of Brampton, Caledon and Mississauga \u2013 has 1.3 million residents, nearly one-quarter of whom are of South Asian ethnicity. South Asians are the largest and fastest growing visible minority group in Canada.\n\nPrevious research by Dr. Aisha Lofters, a family physician with the St. Michael\u2019s Academic Family Health Team and lead author of the study, has found South Asians living in Peel Region are less likely than other Ontarians to be screened for breast, cervical or colorectal cancer, making them much more vulnerable to cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cDespite having generally good access to primary care, and better access than many other immigrant groups, South Asians in Ontario appear to be the most under-screened group for all three of these cancers,\u201d said Dr. Lofters.\n\n\u201cOntario has organized screening programs for these three cancers, but cancer screening is still fundamentally embedded in primary care, suggesting that primary care providers could be the key to addressing under-screening for South Asian patients.\u201d\n\nFor all four physicians, approximately 60 per cent of South Asian patients who were overdue for cancer screening and who spoke directly to health ambassadors stated they were willing to be screened.\n\nHowever, patients expressing willingness to be screened did not necessarily equate to patients actually getting screened, and the capacity for these physicians to track screening was limited, according to the authors.\n\nFor three physicians\u2019 practices, researchers were unable to determine how many patients actually went on to be screened. Tracking actual screening uptake among individual patients was resource-intensive, raised issues around data privacy, and was ultimately only feasible in one office, the authors wrote.\n\nIn one practice, patients who were contacted by patient navigators and spoken to in their own languages had significantly higher screening rates for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening over eight months (23.4 per cent, 14.4 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively).\n\nAlthough the immediate costs of embedding lay health educators were very low, the sustainability of volunteer-led initiatives remains a challenge. The Health Ambassadors had other competing duties, and could not visit a particular clinic more than a few hours per week, limiting the ability to reach a larger number of patients within each office.\n\nMaking phone calls to patients to invite them for screening had the most reach and the most appeal for participating physicians, according to the study, but the majority of patients were not able to be reached directly by telephone. Health ambassadors also noted that patients could be suspicious on the telephone of who they were, how they had obtained their contact information, and how they were affiliated with the physicians\u2019 offices.\n\nThe final challenge was that researchers have no details about the demographics of patients who were approached. Factors such as education level, socioeconomic status and years in Canada could all affect willingness to screen, but researchers were unable to track those variables in this study.\n\nDespite these challenges, all physicians had positive views of working with the health ambassadors, and three of four physicians planned to continue to work with lay educators, said Dr. Lofters.\n\n\u201cIt was a small sample, and there is definitely a need for more research into how best to implement the health ambassadors initiative, but the research clearly demonstrates that these initiatives could positively impact cancer screening rates and improve health outcomes for South Asians in Ontario,\u201d she said.\n\nThis paper is an example of how St. Michael's Hospital is making Ontario Healthier, Wealthier, Smarter.\n\nAbout St. Michael's Hospital\n\nSt. Michael\u2019s Hospital provides compassionate care to all who enter its doors.
