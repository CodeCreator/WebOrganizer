Asterisked (*) sections are optional (at the discretion of the student, advisor, or department) except that lists of figures and tables are required when figures and tables appear in the text. Theses which do not follow the prescribed order will be rejected for improper format.\n\npreliminary pages\n\ntitle page\n*copyright page\napproval sheet\n\u00a0 (signed copy to the Graduate School; unsigned copy with ETD to OhioLINK)\ntable of contents\n*list of figures or illustrations\n*list of tables\n\n\ntext of thesis\n\nreference pages\n\nbibliography (or references)\n\nTitle Page\n\nThe title page must conform exactly in spacing and capitalization to the sample in Appendix A (Master's) or Appendix K (Doctoral). Your name should be given in full and in all capital letters and must be followed by previous degree(s). The date at the bottom of the page should indicate the year in which your degree will be conferred. The title should clearly describe the contents of the thesis. If possible, word substitutes should be used for formulas, symbols, superscripts, Greek letters, and so on.\n\nApproval (Signature) Sheet\n\nAs stated above, a paper copy, of your signed approval sheet must be submitted to the Graduate School when or before you submit your final ETD to OhioLINK.\u00a0Approval sheets are to be prepared by the students and are not supplied by the Graduate School. The approval sheets may be duplicated, but all signatures on them must be originals. The approval sheet should conform to the sample in Appendix B (Master's) or Appendix M (Doctoral). You may submit additional copies of the approval sheet for the Graduate Dean's signature and return to you, as needed. You must come to the Graduate School to reclaim approval sheets, as they will not be forwarded to you.\n\nThe approval sheet in the electronic file should have printed names (see sample approval sheets at Appendices B and M) but no signatures. The copy delivered to and retained by the Graduate School must be signed; the copy sent to OhioLINK with your ETD must not be signed.\n\n\nThe abstract should succinctly summarize the contents of the thesis, stating the problem, the procedure or methods used, the results, and any conclusions. Doctoral dissertation abstracts should not exceed 350 words. Master's thesis abstracts should not exceed 150 words. For the format, see the sample in Appendix C.\n\nOther Sections\n\nFor details of format and style relating to other sections of the thesis (including footnote and bibliography style), students should consult Turabian, the style manual recommended by their department or program, or any other standard style manual being used. The sample table of contents, list of figures, and list of tables in Appendices D, E, and F, respectively, provide examples of suitable formats for those parts of the thesis. Appendix G provides a suitable sample format for the text of your thesis. Appendix H provides a sample thesis appendix. Appendix I provides a sample bibliography. Appendix J provides a sample reference, or literature cited, list which may be used either with, or in place of, the bibliography. (In certain scientific fields, a list of \"References\" or \"Literature Cited\" may be more appropriate than a standard \"Bibliography\". While Appendix J represents one approach, please note that lists of References or Literature Cited formats differ among various scientific fields. You should check with your thesis advisor, or refer to one of the standardized thesis preparation manuals for the format which is appropriate to your academic field.) Care should be taken to maintain consistency of style and format throughout the thesis.",

That is,\n\n-- The occupied dwellings even if the license of use has not been issued yet. The private holiday house will be enumerated as a dwelling in case at the reference date of the census at least one person has been permanently or temporarily living there;\n\n-- The vacant (not occupied) dwellings and the dwellings used only seasonally (e.g. a cottage house);\n\n-- The occupied (inhabited) other housing units that is the temporary, mobile and other units;\n\n-- The institutional households (day-nurseries, children's homes, dormitories, workers' homes, old people's homes, etc.).\n\nThe following build-ups must not be enumerated:\n\n-- The premises originally built for habitation (as a dwelling) but used at the date of the enumeration for other purposes e.g. business, recreation only, office, etc.;\n\n-- Technically completed though not inhabited dwellings yet, not having a licence for use;\n\n-- Dwellings under demolishing;\n\n-- Dwellings ruined, not suitable for habitation due to elementary or other damage;\n\n-- Vacant dwellings used formerly not for habitation.\n\nA separate enumeration manual will be applied for the enumeration of the institutional households.\n\nIn the housing units of the enumeration district -- irrespective their actual presence -- the following persons should be enumerated:\n\n-- Persons officially registered as permanent residents;\n\n-- Persons officially registered as temporary residents;\n\n-- Persons staying in the dwelling without any official registration.\n\nThe place of residence (address) should be registered according to the effective situation; while marking the answer the entry in the List of addresses and the names should not be respected. In case the person is resident in the dwelling though the official registration has not been arranged yet than the expected status (permanent or temporary resident) will be marked. This might happen in cases like\n\n-- The persons moved in the dwelling, changed his\/her dwelling without arranging the registration;\n\n-- The person -- due to the lack of license for using the (new) dwelling -- is not entitled to let him\/her registered at the authorities;\n\n-- The person moved from the outskirt of the locality into his flat in the inner area without arranging the official registration.\n\n[p. 4]\n\nThe factual situation should be enumerated even if the given person failed to arrange the cessation of his\/her registration in a dwelling, e.g. the person while conducting the studies had been officially registered as temporary resident in a locality where his\/her parents have been living and after completing the studies and returning home he\/she has forgotten to annul the registration. Any divergence related to the official registration of the addresses should be marked on the list of addresses and names.\n\nFrom the point of view of enumeration a person might have not more than two addresses: one of them might be the permanent while the other the temporary address.\n\nThe persons should be enumerated both in their officially registered permanent and officially registered temporary addresses.\n\nFurther the persons who are not present in their dwelling for a longer period should be enumerated too. This group of persons might cover the following persons:\n\n-- Being absent for a shorter or longer period for visits, medical treatment;\n\n-- Officially staying abroad (in diplomatic, commercial services, for scientific research, etc;\n\n-- Working abroad in a work-cooperation program;\n\n-- Studying abroad.\n\nThe persons listed staying abroad will be enumerated in their place of usual residence while as for the address of their temporary residence the name of the respective country will be marked. Their temporary address in Hungary (if any) must not be taken into account. The family members (spouse, children) of the persons above who are living outside Hungary should be enumerated as the reference person of the family.\n\nThe enumeration of the conscripts, reservists on duty as well as that of the imprisoned persons will be done primarily by the given institutions and the task of the enumerator on field is the checking of the validity of the former enumeration.\n\nThe persons deceased after the reference date of the census should while on the other hand the children born after the reference date of the census must not be enumerated. In the former case a comment on the \"List of addresses\" should be marked.\n\nThe foreign citizens staying in the country having a resident permit or Hungarian identity document will be registered.\n\nThe following foreign citizens will not be registered:\n\n-- Diplomats;\n\n-- Military personnel and their family members residing in Hungary in the frame of the Warsaw Pact;\n\n-- Tourists, persons in medical treatment, family or other visit without resident permit.\n\n[p. 5 is omitted.]\n\n[p. 6]\n\nCompleting the dwelling questionnaire\n\nDwelling questionnaire will be completed for every dwelling and housing unit.\n\nThe dwelling is a unit of places and rooms with specific functions (living rooms, cooking places, sanitary places etc.), generally technically (architecturally) connected to each other, intended for human accommodation, stay (home) or converted into dwelling and also suitable for living at present, which has a separate entrance from a public place, courtyard or from a collectively used place inside the building (staircase, corridor etc.).\n\nThe group of technically (architecturally) adjoining places, connected with inner passages, were considered at the enumeration as one dwelling also in cases when the passages of one or several places were blocked temporarily but not walled (e.g. in the case of co-tenancy). A mostly separate place, building -- e.g. the summer kitchen of detached family house -- built as a part of the dwelling was considered as part of the dwelling if it was used by a household either living in the main building or living -- as e.g. subtenant -- in the given building.\n\nThe number of enumeration district should be copied into the Dwelling questionnaire from the \"List of addresses\", while the code number of the characteristic of the dwelling will entered according to the judgment of the enumerator as follows:\n\nCode 1: Residential building (including occupied holiday house and cottage house)\n\nCode 2: Occupied other building: public building (school, mayor's office building), business building (office building, shopping house, factory building\n\nCode 3: Institutional building (e.g. dwellings in the buildings of a dormitory, workers' home, old people's home, and hospital)\n\nCode 4: Occupied workshop, temporary or mobile facility, caravan, hut, hovel, trailer, etc.\n\n1. Data on the persons living in the dwelling\n\nThe on the first page of the dwelling questionnaire will be filled in with the help of the respondent. The persons living in the dwelling will be grouped by households, within the households by families. By listing the family members the sequence should follow the family ties, or rather the family status. The printed versions at the table will help the classification of the family members. The persons belonging to the same family will be allotted by the same family number while those belonging to the same household will be marked with the same household number.\n\nA common household is a group of persons living together in a common housing unit or in a part of it, bearing together, at least partly, the costs of living (i.e. daily expenses, meals). Subtenants, night-lodgers and co-tenants should be marked always with individual household numbers.\n\nConsequently before starting the enumeration it has to be defined the number of households, families living in the dwelling, than the families and the households should be \"set up\". The next step is the fixing of the family status.\n\nFamily is formed from the following persons living in a common household:\n\n-- Married couple with or without child(ren);\n\n-- Persons living in consensual union with or without child(ren);\n[p. 6]\n-- Mother or father living with child(ren) (unless the spouse or cohabiting partner does not live in the same dwelling, while\n\nThe following persons do not live in a family:\n\n-- The related or non-related persons (other than listed above), e.g. two siblings, three friends, etc.;\n\n-- Lone persons.\nFixing the family status (heading \"d\")\n\nOne of the printed answers will be underlined:\n\n-- \"Husband (1)\" or \"wife(2)\" in case of legally married male and female;\n\n-- \"Consensual partner (3)\" in case of males and females living in consensual partnership without legal marriage;\n\n-- \"Mother or father living with at least one child (4)\" in case one of the parents lives with the children);\n\n-- \"Child (5)\" in case of a child (own or foster) of the previously mentioned persons irrespective of the age of the person;\n\n-- \"Ascending relative (6)\" in case of parent, grand-parent, brother-in-law, father-in-law of a \"husband\", \"wife\", \"consensual partner\" or \"lone parent with children\" in case the ascending relative lives in the family without his\/her spouse;\n\n-- \"Other relative (7)\" in case of any non-ascending relative not forming an independent family (e.g. aunt, sibling, grandchild);\n\n-- \"Non-relative (8)\" in case of a persons other...

        "text":"Technical Adequacy of Assessments\n\nTechnical Adequacy of the Progress Monitoring Passages\n\nThe following information provides evidence for the validity of the progress monitoring passages in Read Naturally Progress Monitor, based on the correlation between the monitoring passages and the benchmark passages in Read Naturally\u2019s \u00a0Reading Fluency Benchmark Assessor and Benchmark Assessor Live.\n\npointer\u00a0Learn more about Reading Fluency Progress Monitor\u00a0(Read Naturally's progress monitoring tool)\n\n\nOver the course of three school years (2002-2003, 2003-2004, and 2004-2005), Read Naturally field tested dozens of reading passages at each grade level for the purpose of continuous progress monitoring. We sent passages to classrooms throughout the country and piloted with a diversity of students. We tested students on these passages as well as on grade level benchmark passages from the Reading Fluency Benchmark Assessor and compared students' words correct per minute (WCPM) on the monitoring passages with their WCPM on the benchmark passages. Some monitoring passages were too hard for a particular grade level and some were too easy. We modified these passages and\/or tested them in a different grade. Ultimately, each passage met the benchmark passage in difficulty or we discarded it. We calibrated a total of 30 passages per grade level. The table below summarizes the results of these analyses.\n\nCorrelation and Difficulty Data\n\nThe following table lists correlation data about the progress monitoring passages compared to each other and to the grade level benchmarks. The correlation between the benchmark and monitoring passages is a measure of validity. Correlations range from -1.0 to +1.0. High correlations (.8 or higher) between the monitoring passage and the benchmark passage means that the two passages are measuring the same skill (reading fluency) with a high degree of consistency. Monitoring passages with high correlations to the benchmark and to other monitoring passages have high reliability and validity.\n\nThe table also lists data on the difficulty of the monitoring passages compared to the benchmarks. A difficulty of -2.1, for example, would indicate that the median WCPM of all students tested on the monitoring passage was 2.1 words less than their median WCPM on the benchmark passage. If the median WCPM for students on the benchmark was 50.5 and the median WCPM for students on the monitoring passage was 48.4, the difficulty on that passage would be 48.4 minus 50.5, which is -2.1.\n\nGrade (30 passages per grade) Median Correlation with Benchmark Benchmark Correlation Range Median Correlation with Other Passages Other Passage Correlation Range Median Difficulty (words correct per minute difference Range of Difficulty\n1 .96 .91 to .99 .96 .92 to .99 -2.0 -6.0 to 4.0\n2 .95 .90 to .99 .96 .92 to .99 -1.5 -5.9 to 4.1\n3 .94 .89 to .99 .94 .90 to .99 -0.5 -5.5 to 3.8\n4 .94 .92 to .98 .94 .90 to .97 1.3 -4.9 to 5.3\n5 .93 .81 to .98 .93 .79 to .96 0.3 -5.1 to 5.3\n6 .94 .89 to .97 .95 .85 to .97 -0.7 -5.6 to 6.0\n7 .94 .87 to .97 .95 .88 to .97 -1.2 -5.7 to 5.8\n8 .95 .88 to .98 .95 .91 to .97 -0.7 -5.5 to 5.2\n\nPlease let us know what questions you have so we can assist.

It is recommended that the Section Technical and Research Representative be assigned to the Papers Committee as it has been found to be helpful in promoting high quality papers and keeping members abreast of current technological advances. It is desired to have the full year\u2019s schedule developed by the beginning of the Section year for printing in October\u2019s Marine Technology and placement on the website.\n\nSome Sections have successfully followed a procedure in which an Assistant Papers Committee Chair, working with the Section Vice Chair, devotes him\/her self exclusively to the development of papers and\nprogram ideas one year in advance. He\/She then becomes Committee Chair the following year, and with the assistance of the other committee members, develops the program in detail as described. The Section Vice Chair may assume responsibility for the Papers Committee advance planning. The method of an individual or small group working a full year in advance enables the Section to develop its own program and not be forced to accept papers which are already available.\n\nA principal objective of the Society is the presentation and publishing of a broad range of materials that are of value to the profession, to the marine industry and to the general public. It is the function of the Papers Committee to select the best papers available on subjects of interest and\/or persuade eminent authorities to write such papers. Methods of determining members\u2019 interests and suggestions for developing an effective meeting are to be found in Section V-A - Program Planning Guidelines of this\nManual. The Committee should use every source available to develop papers of the highest caliber, which avoid commercialism and have the broadest appeal. Suggestions for papers, authors, or special programs are to be submitted to the Section Chair and the Executive Committee for approval. It is recognized that PowerPoint presentations are favored by many authors and, although presentations are not as desirable as a technical paper, Headquarters does have a policy to archive all such presentations, which will become accessible on the website. Electronic copies of all papers and abstracts shall be forwarded to Headquarters, both in electronic format and hard copy to make it easier for website inclusion.\n\nCoordination of the technical program is accomplished effectively by assigning one or more papers committee members to each author to assure that the papers standards are followed, and schedules and author\u2019s requirements for audio\/visual aids, etc. are satisfied. Information on Copyrights, Author's Instructions, and other technical presentation guidelines is available at Adherence to Author's Instructions is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Papers Committee members should insist that high quality papers standards be followed, and to provide helpful suggestions to the author that will enable him\/her to write a top quality paper and make the best possible presentation. Many authors have had little experience in the development and presentation of papers, and would undoubtedly welcome help from Section members. Authors should be encouraged to discuss the topic of the paper in an extemporaneous fashion, using whatever aids\nprove effective. Papers should never be read at a technical meeting.\n\nIt is particularly important that commercialism in any form be avoided in any of the technical papers presented before any meetings of SNAME. However, it is understood that many Section papers are commercially oriented.\n\nAuthors should submit manuscripts and the copyright release form in accordance with the schedule established by the Papers Committee. The manuscripts can be submitted to other knowledgeable people for review and possible discussion.\n\nThe Committee Chair, or someone delegated by him\/her, must assume responsibility for providing the Secretary with the title, author, brief synopsis, and importance of the paper in sufficient time for inclusion in the meeting notice.",

        "text":"Head Start Analysis\n\n\nWe have created a number of Head start-specific indicators that are relevant to the Needs Assessment you will be preparing as part of your proposal. (A description of Needs Assessment content is included in the Reference Section below).\u00a0 The indicators we have prepared are available at either the ZIP code or census tract level.\u00a0 Several of them are also illustrated in the maps below.\n\nTo match your ZIP code or census tract to its numerical code, see our\u00a0reference map.\n\nThe 2010 Census did not collect information on educational attainment, income, poverty, employment, vehicle availability, and other socioeconomic characteristics.\u00a0 These data were incorporated in the new American Community Survey.\u00a0 The poverty and labor force data included in your tract level indicators file come from the 2006-10 American Community Survey (ACS).\u00a0 Data at the neighborhood (census tract) level require five years of sample interviews to be combined.\u00a0 The 2006-2010 ACS file contains the most recent data available.\u00a0 No ACS data are available at the ZIP code level, however.\u00a0 While we have provided only limited information on this site, we may be developing more indicators for general context purposes and are available for specific requests.\n\nIn addition to the specific indicators we have calculated for you, we also offer our Census Comparison tool.\u00a0 This tool allows you to look at any ZIP code or census tract and track 2000 \u2013 2010 trends on all census variables, including age, race\/ethnicity, household and family composition, housing occupancy and housing tenure.\u00a0 These may come in handy when you are providing general context on the demographics of your service area.\n\n\nCensus 2010\n\nWhile we have only mapped 2010 data on single-parent households, our Census Comparison Tool allows you to find information related to all the questions asked on the Census questionnaire.\u00a0 These data will allow you to describe population trends, age distributions, the racial and ethnic context, housing trends and much more detail on the living arrangements of children.\n\nAmerican Community Survey 2006-2010\n\nSee the Data section above for information about our ACS maps.\n\nMichigan Department of Community Health\n\nThe Michigan Department of Community Health collects information related to every birth and death in the state.\u00a0 They release this information for large geographic areas \u2013 state, county and communities.\u00a0 Data Driven Detroit has acquired the individual birth record files for 2008 and 2009. (We anticipate receiving the 2010 file by September 2012.)\u00a0 We have taken these individual files and attached geographic codes to them so that we can produce information at either the ZIP Code or Census Tract level.\u00a0 Each birth record includes information on both the child (weight, level of prenatal care) and mother (age, educational level, and smoking history).\u00a0 We have utilized these data to calculate the percent of teenage births, but can provide you with additional information if you require it.\n\nEarly Development Instrument\n\n\n\nIn order to get a handle on Kindergarten Readiness (one of the measures required by the Feds for their applications), we must use results from the Early Development Instrument (EDI), developed at the Offord Centre for Child Studies at McMaster University in Canada.1\u00a0\u00a0The UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, under license from McMaster University, is implementing the EDI in the Detroit area, in collaboration with the United Way for Southeastern Michigan (UWSEM).\n\nThe EDI has 103 core items and is an observational checklist, based on recall, that is completed by kindergarten teachers on each child in their class in the second half of the school year.\u00a0 The EDI requires approximately 10-15 minutes per child to complete.\u00a0 Information collected using the EDI is reported at a group level (e.g. for a census tract, neighborhood, city, etc) and is never reported on individual children or used as a screening or diagnostic tool for children.\n\nWe have included several documents that explain the EDI and provide test results for Southeast Michigan and Detroit.\n\nWe have mapped EDI test results by ZIP code.\u00a0 Specifically, we have mapped high-end results (Percent of Children Scoring At or Above the 75th Percentile on 4 or More Scales) and the low-end results (Percent of Children Scoring in the Lowest 10th Percentile on at Least One Scale.) \u00a0Results for each of the five domains are included in the ZIP code indicator file in the first section.\n\nThe final map we have included in this section is a market share map.\u00a0 In order to judge how representative the EDI test results are for a ZIP Code, one needs to have an understanding of the share of eligible children in that ZIP Code who were tested.\u00a0 The map shows a very wide range of coverage, from less than 1 percent to 48 percent.\u00a0 While none of these market shares would suggest particularly reliable results, shares less than 30 percent should be treated with extreme wariness.\n\n1 The tool is referred to by the publishers as the Early Development Instrument; however, in Orange County, it is referred to as the Early Development Index to reflect the community level marker of child development that is produced in the Community Profile report. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAmerican Community Survey 2007-2011\n\nAll Maps\n\n\n\n\nSee Also",

For instructions on how to create a Competency Review module as an Administrator please read\u00a0 Creating a Competency\u00a0Review.\n\n\nYou can tell at a glance whether an attestation or review has been recorded for a Learner.\u00a0 If the Competency Review or Attestation Status columns display one (or two, depending on the properties you chose) gray icons, no attestations or reviews have been recorded.\u00a0 The icon will turn blue once an attestation or Competency Review has been recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can only record a review for one Learner at a time.\u00a0 You must click on the box to the left of the Learner's name, and the Record Competency Review box will become available.\n\n\n\nIf you attempt to select two Learners, the Record Competency Review\u00a0box will disappear.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting only one Learner and clicking on the Record Competency Review button, a pop-up will appear with that Learner's Competency Review.\u00a0 The pop-up asks the Evaluator to enter the following information:\n\n  \u2022 The date of the Competency Review\n  \u2022 The Rating (scale) for each Standard\n  \u2022 An Overall Score (if different than than Average Score that is auto-populated)\n  \u2022 Upload File (this is optional, but can be supplemental information to support your assessment)\n  \u2022 Attestation -- This is required in order to be able to Record Competency Review\n    \u2022 Without an attestation, an Evaluator can Save their progress, but it will not officially record a final version.\n\n\n(The screenshots below are of one pop-up, but it is too big to show in one image)\n\n\n\n\nAfter an Evaluator has recorded an observation, it cannot be edited. You can click the print icon to print a copy of the review.\u00a0 If the Learner's attestation is also required, the Learner will still appear on the Currently Enrolled page, but their name will have an image of a lock next to it.\u00a0 If only the Evaluator's attestation is required, the Competency Review will be complete.\n\n\n\nRecording Attestations as a Learner\n\nIf Learner attestations are required, the Learner will be able to see the Competency Review on their current training tab.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the Learner clicks on \"Take Now\" to the right of the Competency Review, they will be taken into the Lessons and Exams section.\u00a0 They can click on the View button to see the Competency Review that was recorded for them by the Evaluator.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the Learner clicks View, they will see a Read-Only version of their review.\u00a0 They can review any feedback or notes that the Evaluator entered for them.\u00a0 Once they are ready to attest to the review, they must click the blue Attest & Record button at the top.\u00a0\n\n\n(The screenshots below are of one pop-up, but it is too big to show in one image)\n\n\n\nThe Learner must confirm that they agree with the recorded evaluation scores before they can attest to the review.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the Learner selects Agree & Continue, their Competency Review is complete.\u00a0 If they choose to view it again, they will see that their Attestation Statement has been checked.\n\n\nNow that the appropriate users have attested to the Competency Review, the module is complete, and the results will be available for reporting (Competency Review Detail Report).\n\n\nPlease Note: Learners are able to retrieve and print Competency Review at all times from the Completed Training tab by using the Print button located under the Competency Review title.\n\n\n\n\nTo get back to the Knowledge Base and the master list of topics, please click here: The Relias Platform How-To-Manual",

        "text":"2.3.5 OU multiple response\n\nAlong with the Multiple Choice question type, the Multiple Response question type is the most common form of question used in the OU's paper-based CMA system. The Multiple Response question type requires the student to choose multiple options.\n\n2.60 The Question text, mark and General feedback\n\nQuestion name: A descriptive name is sensible. This name will not be shown to students.\n\nQuestion text: You may use the full functionality of the editor to state the question.\n\nGeneral feedback: We recommend the correct answer be included in this box. Students who did not answer completely correctly can then compare and contrast to see where they made an error. The contents of this box will be shown to all students irrespective of whether their response was correct or incorrect.\n\n2.61 The available choices\n\nThe OU Multiple Response question type simplifies the authoring process by incorporating the marking scheme developed for the OU paper-based CMA system. In this marking scheme\n\n  \u2022 Choices are marked as correct or incorrect. If a question has n correct choices each correct choice is given a mark of (Question grade)\/n.\n  \u2022 If a student selects more than n choices the marks are based on the worst n choices.\n  \u2022 It follows that the number of incorrect choices should equal or exceed the number of correct choices (otherwise a student choosing all choices will receive marks).\n\nExample: A question has five choices of which only 'a' and 'b' are correct. How student responses are marked:\n\n  \u2022 a b: 100% correct\n  \u2022 a c: 50% correct\n  \u2022 a b c: 50% correct - only the two worst choices are marked\n  \u2022 a b c d: 0% correct - only the two worst choices are marked\n2.62 The Combined feedback section\n\nWhether or not Combined feedback is shown to students is governed by the Specific feedback setting on the iCMA definition form.\n\n2.63 The multiple tries section\n\nPenalty for each incorrect try: The available mark is reduced by the penalty for second and subsequent tries. In the example above a correct answer at the second try will score 0.6666667 of the available marks and a correct answer at the third try will score 0.3333334 of the available marks.\n\nIf the question is used in interactive with multiple tries mode the marking is modified as follows:\n\n  1. At each try only the worst n choices are scored.\n  2. The mark is reduced for each try by the penalty factor.\n  3. Allowance is made for when a correct response is first chosen providing it remains chosen in subsequent tries.\n\nHint: You can complete as many of these boxes as you wish. If you wish to give the student three tries at a question you will need to provide two hints. At runtime when the hints are exhausted the question will finish and the student will be given the general feedback and the question score will be calculated.\n\nClear incorrect responses: When \u2018Try again\u2019 is clicked incorrect choices are cleared.\n\nShow the\u00a0number of correct responses: Include in the feedback a statement of how many choices are correct.\n\nShow the feedback\u00a0for the selected\u00a0responses: This setting controls the feedback to individual choices however if too many choices are made it is suppressed.\n\n2.3.4 Multiple choice\n\n2.3.6 Select missing words",
