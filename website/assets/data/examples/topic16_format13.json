There is little sympathy for her illiteracy, her substance abuse, her self-harming, her eating disorder, her anxiety, depression and propensity for extreme violence. Safe from her clan in London, and living with two friendly students, she\u2019s been much calmer. If only she were allowed to live quietly, she might get on top of her problems.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s difficult for the young werewolf. She\u2019s still the number one target for the werewolf hunters, and they\u2019re stepping up their efforts to find her.\n\nMARTIN MILLAR was born in Glasgow and now lives in London. He is the author of Lux the Poet, Milk, Sulphate and Alby Starvation, and Suzy, Led Zeppelin and Me, among others. He wrote the Thraxas series under the name of Martin Scott, and won the World Fantasy Award in 2000. The Anxiety of Kalix the Werewolf is the third title in this popular werewolf series, following Lonely Werewolf Girl and Curse of the Wolf Girl.",

This mother-and-son writing team is best known for a series of fourteen novels, set in post World War I England. The books deal with the cases of Inspector Ian Rutledge, a veteran of the European campaigns who is attempting to pick up the pieces of his Scotland Yard career. However, he must keep his greatest burden a secret: suffering from shell shock, he lives with the constant, cynical, taunting voice of Hamish MacLeod, a young Scots soldier he was forced to execute on the battlefield for refusing an order.\n\nA Test of Wills was one of the 100 favorite mysteries of the 20th Century (The Independent Mystery Booksellers Association), received a starred review in Publishers Weekly and was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. The Confession, the latest Ian Rutledge novel, will be featured at the festival. \u201cThere\u2019s both a pattern and a purpose to the superb historical mysteries produced by mother-and-son writing partners known as Charles Todd.\u201d\n\u2014 New York Times Book Review\n\nCharles and Caroline have a rich storytelling heritage. Both spent many evenings on the porch listening to their fathers and grandfathers reminisce. And a maternal grandmother told marvelous ghost stories. This tradition allows them to write with passion about events before their own time. And an uncle\/great-uncle who served as a flyer in WWI aroused an early interest in the Great War.\n\nFor more information about Caroline and Charles Todd and their work, visit\n\nFestival Appearances\nFriday, March 30 at 2:15 p.m.\nFeatured Author Charles Todd Lady Lake Public Library, Lady Lake\n\nFriday, March 30 at 6:30 p.m.\nAuthor Reception Lady Lake Public Library, Lady Lake\n\nSaturday, March 31 at 1 p.m.\nWriting Historical Crime Fiction with Caroline and Charles Todd W.

Judged \u201cthe Nation\u2019s No. 1 economic problem\u201d by the National Emergency Council\u2019s Report on Southern Economic Conditions in the South, the South\u2019s under-developed, agricultural economy posed a serious obstacle for the country\u2019s overall economic recovery. However, even as tropes of the South\u2019s economic backwardness were employed to generate support for economic reform and development, Southern intellectuals - notably the Fugitive Agrarians - resisted such efforts. Appealing to an image of the South as a holistic, organic society, the Agrarians valorized the region\u2019s agrarian economic base and sought to maintain the South\u2019s communal forms of affiliation as a bulwark against the threat of encroaching industrialization.\n\nPossible paper topics could include how Southern writers responded to: the New Deal, the erosion of a regional identity, the plight of sharecroppers and tenant farmers, etc.\n\nPlease send 500 word abstracts and a brief bio to bgordon@uci.edu by March 30.\n\ncfp categories:",

This interdisciplinary, transhistorical, and transnational conference organized by the Centre for Material Texts, University of Bristol, aims to explore how books have affected and continue to affect our daily lives and well-being. How we have lived with books in the past, how do we live with them in the present, how we might live with them better in the future, and how might we help others do the same?\n\nAs readers, writers, creative practitioners, educators, researchers, curators, consumers and producers, how do books feature in our lives? How do they share our living and working spaces? How might books contribute to health and wellbeing? Do books keep us apart from each other, or can they enable us to connect with communities? What are the consequences of not living with books? How far do the answers to these questions depend on location, or income, class, gender and other variables? How might the answers to these questions have changed over time? What is the value of asking these questions in an increasingly digital age?\n\nWe welcome proposals from postgraduates, early career researchers, and established scholars from all disciplines, embracing both qualitative and quantitative research paradigms.\nRelated keywords: book history, library, literacy, quantitative methods",
