        "text":"Thomas Moore at 240!\n\n28 June 2019\n\nIn this month's Library blog post\u00a0Harry White, MRIA, Professor of Music, University College Dublin, takes a look at our current exhibition\u00a0Discovering Thomas Moore: Ireland in\u00a0nineteenth-century Europe.\n\n\u2018Where in Germany, even today, would you find three such literary heroes to set beside Lord Byron, Moore and Walter Scott?\u2019, enquired the great German writer and statesman, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1824.\u00a0 For many people, it comes as a surprise to see Thomas Moore in such company, in the front rank of British literary romanticism, because his reputation in the interim has dwindled to a handful of well-beloved songs from the Irish melodies, and not much besides. Moore was in fact an originary and formative presence in the development of European music and letters in the first half of the nineteenth century, and the circulation of his poetry, fiction and lyric verse exerted considerable influence on many composers, including Robert Schumann and Hector Berlioz. Schumann\u2019s setting of the second part of Moore\u2019s Lalla Rookh, \u2018Paradise and the Peri\u2019 (in German translation) and Berlioz\u2019s M\u00e9lodies irlandaises (settings in French translation of Moore\u2019s verse from the Irish melodies) affirm a more general popularity for Moore\u2019s poetry on the continent.\n\n\u00a0Thomas Moore, Paradise and the Peri\u00a0(London, Day & Son, [1860]). Image courtesy of Special Collections & Archives, Queen's University Belfast.\n\nMoore\u2019s long poem \u2014 Lalla Rookh \u2014 became an overnight success on its publication in 1817.\u00a0 The poem relates the journey of Lalla Rookh, an Indian princess, from her homeland\u00a0 to Kashmir for her wedding to the king there.\u00a0 En route she meets a poet who accompanies her and beguiles her with the story of a fallen angel (the Peri) who has to pass several tests in order to gain entry to Paradise.\u00a0Lalla Rookh falls in love with the poet who turns out to be her betrothed in disguise! \u00a0Schumann remarked that the verse was \u2018intended for music, as if from the start\u2019. The poem was part of a vogue for orientalism in Europe and was widely admired and translated.\u00a0\n\nThis year we celebrate the 240th anniversary of Moore\u2019s birth in Dublin on 28 May 1779 with an exhibition at the Academy Library, curated by Dr Sarah McCleave, Senior Musicologist at the School of Arts, English & Languages, Queen\u2019s University of Belfast.\n\nThe materials on display recapture not only Moore\u2019s phenomenal success as a poet and lyricist in Europe, but his often neglected reputation as a novelist, satirist, biographer and historian. In recent years, these aspects of Moore\u2019s intellectual estate have received at least something of their due from literary historians and musicologists, just as Moore\u2019s extraordinary life has been magisterially recovered in Ronan Kelly\u2019s 2008 biography, Bard of Erin[i]. Throughout that life, the very idea of Ireland abides, even in Moore\u2019s imagined orient. Moore\u2019s inventions were assuredly romantic, but they were also grounded in a scientific apprehension of scholarly sources and a lively political awareness of injustice and repression. His instincts as a romantic poet were constantly mediated by an antiquarian appeal to the authority of historical documents, and his brilliance as a biographer (particularly of Lord Edward FitzGerald) was fired by \u2018that time of terror and torture\u2019 which Moore experienced as a young student in Trinity College Dublin, following the failed rebellion of 1798. Throughout his writing career, as many of the items displayed in the exhibition demonstrate, Moore\u2019s sense of responsibility to empirical evidence anchored the flight of his auditory imagination.\n\nThomas Moore. Image courtesy of the National Library of Ireland.\n\nThe rich resources of the Royal Irish Academy (which houses the greater part of Moore\u2019s private library) and of the Gibson Massie collection in Queen\u2019s University Belfast combine in this exhibition to commemorate the 240th anniversary of the birth of a writer whose profound Irishness was deeply inflected by his European reception and afterlife. In the present moment of European crisis, such a commemoration could scarcely be timelier.\n\nHarry White, MRIA, Professor of Music, University College Dublin\n\nThe exhibition\u00a0Discovering Thomas Moore: Ireland in\u00a0nineteenth-century Europe\u00a0is on display at Academy House until 23 December 2019.\u00a0Our booklet \u2014 Sarah McCleave, Discovering Thomas Moore: Ireland in nineteenth-century Europe (Dublin, 2019) \u2014 is available at the exhibition.\u00a0\u00a0 ISBN: 978-1-911479-22-2\n\nDiscover Moore\u00a0with the Erin Catalogue project. Based at Queen's University Belfast and co-funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union, ERIN, or Europe\u2019s Reception of the Irish Melodies & National Airs: Thomas Moore in Europe, is an open access online resource which maps Europe\u2019s response to the Irish Melodies, documents the chronological and geographical dissemination of the National Airs and identifies European music editions of the songs, operas and ballets from or based on the poem Lalla Rookh.\n\nRead the latest post by the\u00a0Eighteenth-Century Ireland Society on Project ERIN\n\nMain image: 'The Tyrant of Gazna\u2019, drawn on stone by Albert Warren, image courtesy Special Collections and Archives, Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\u00a0\nThe Tyrant of Gazna is a character featured in\u00a0'Paradise and the Peri', one of the tales in Thomas Moore's Lalla Rookh\n\n[i] Ronan Kelly, Bard of Erin: the life of Thomas Moore (Dublin, 2008).\n\nStay up to date with the Royal Irish Academy newsletter\n\nSign up now",

Some are old favourites like Val McDermid, who thrills and terrifies equally with her latest Tony Hill book Fever Of The Bone and Ian Rankin who introduces us to a new police character in his novel, The Complaints. However, some of the authors are much newer to the Scottish writing scene. Glasgow lawyer G.J Moffat doesn\u2019t disappoint with his debut novel Daisychain, a fast moving thriller while Scottish independence is the theme of Alan Clement\u2019s first novel, Rogue Nation. If you haven\u2019t read anything by Glasgow author Anne Donovan, try Being Emily, a moving, funny and heart warming tale of family life. Andrew Greig who hails from Fife\u2019s East Neuk, is another author to try is you want A Right Guid Read. In The Return of John MacNab, the prequel to Andrew\u2019s recent Romanno Bridge, a challenge, first written of in John Buchan\u2019s classic tale John MacNab, is revived.\nNovember\u2019s What\u2019s New also has a taste of Scottish writing with Kirsty Scott\u2019s Fortune House, a tale of loss, love and family relationships, set near Edinburgh. Moving away from Scottish writing, Turbulence by Giles Foden, is the fascinating fictional account of weather forecasting and The D-Day invasion of Normandy, while Sam Baker\u2019s The Step-Mother\u2019s Support Group gives a light hearted look at a difficult family situation.\nWhatever you choose to read this month, I hope you find\u00a0A Right Guid Read.\nClick on the publication link on this page to read this month's reviews.\u00a0If you would like to submit a review for A Right Guid Read, click on the link to the online review form.\nHappy reading!\nThe Editor.\n\n\nJennifer Stewart, Service Development Officer, Libraries (Adults)\u00a0\nTel:\u00a003451 55 55 55 + Ext 46 02 22 Contact Jennifer Stewart online\nBy Post: Iona House John Smith Business Park Grantsmuir Road Kirkcaldy Fife KY2 6NA\n\nWe have placed cookies on your computer to improve your experience here.
