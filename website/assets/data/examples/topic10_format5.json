        "text":"Frequent question: Is silicone safe for cooking utensils?\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized silicon dioxides as a safe (GRAS) to use as food-grade materials. \u2026 Thus, generally, food grade silicone cookware are considered safe for daily cooking or baking.\n\nIs silicone cookware toxic?\n\nThe short answer is yes, silicone is safe. According to the FDA, food-grade silicone cookware and utensils do not cause harmful chemical contamination of foods. If you are nervous about using silicone when cooking or baking, focus on using silicone kitchen tools and avoid cookware.\n\nIs it safe to use silicone cooking utensils?\n\nSilicone utensils are a durable and non-toxic alternative to plastic. This material has a higher melting point than plastic, is chemically stable under extreme temperatures (won\u2019t leach materials into your food), and does not release any odors or toxic fumes during cooking. It\u2019s also very soft and child-safe!\n\nAre silicone spatulas safe to cook with?\n\nSilicone cooking utensils are non-corrosive and hard-wearing. Food grade silicone is very safe to use in any type of food. It does not react with food or beverages or produce any hazardous fumes. \u2026 This means that it will probably last longer than the other kitchen utensils.\n\nTHIS IS EXCITING:\u00a0 What happens to wine when you cook with it?\n\nDoes silicone contain BPA?\n\nBenefits of food grade silicone:\n\nHighly resistant to damage and degradation from extreme temperatures. If cared for properly, it won\u2019t harden, crack, peel, crumble, dry out, rot or become brittle over time. Lightweight, saves space, easy to transport. Non-toxic and odorless \u2013 contains no BPA, latex, lead, or phthalates.\n\nIs silicone as bad as plastic?\n\nWhy is silicone better than plastic? Silicone is preferable to plastic because it doesn\u2019t contain the harmful chemicals like phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) and it is more durable so silicone products often last longer and do not need to be replaced as often \/ generate less waste than plastic products.\n\nAre silicone utensils better than plastic?\n\nSilicone is indisputably safer for human health than plastic, which is a petroleum-based material commonly containing estrogen-mimicking chemicals like bisphenol-A (BPA). Furthermore, when it comes to the environment, silicone is highly durable and more environmentally friendly than plastic.\n\nWhich type of utensil is best for cooking?\n\nWhat Kind of Utensils are Ideal for Cooking?\n\n  1. Stainless Steel. One of the most readily available and best vessels for cooking that you should consider is stainless steel. \u2026\n  2. Cast Iron. One of the long-lasting and sturdy metals that can be used for cooking food is cast iron. \u2026\n  3. Glass. \u2026\n  4. Brass. \u2026\n  5. Bronze. \u2026\n  6. Clay Pots.\n\nWhich is safer nylon or silicone cooking utensils?\n\nMost chefs prefer silicone over nylon because it poses less of a health risk and has higher heat resistance. Nylon utensils, however, are usually affordable, sturdy, and have an average heat resistance of about 400\u00b0 F.\n\nTHIS IS EXCITING:\u00a0 Can you use mayonnaise for frying?\n\nAre all silicone spatulas heat-resistant?\n\nHeat resistance \u2013 Silicone can withstand high heat, with some being able to resist heat up to 600 degrees Fahrenheit. \u2026 This in turns means that silicone spatulas are easier to clean and wash, compared to other materials such as wood which is more porous, and which can harbor more bacterial growth.\n\nAre silicone utensils heat-resistant?\n\nSilicone is a fantastic option for heat-resistant utensil sets because it can handle temperatures of up to 400 degrees. Better yet, silicone utensils are more flexible than bamboo or stainless steel, making them the perfect option when it comes to flipping pancakes or getting into all the crevices of a pot or pan.\n\nAre silicone muffin cups safe?\n\nThe FDA has approve silicone as a food safe substance and it is generally considered inert and will not leach into foods. \u2026 Lower quality silicone may contain fillers or additives which may cause odor during baking and discolor over time. Silicone bakeware is durable, non-stick, and quite flexible.\n\nHow can you tell if food grade is silicone?\n\nHold the silicone product by hand, focus on one place, and then pull hard on both sides. Turn White is an ordinary silicone, and no white is the food-grade silicone. If the silicone product pulled white and has a pungent smell, then it can be concluded that it is an ordinary silicone, not food grade.\n\nWhat are silicone utensils made of?\n\nSilicone, a synthetic rubber made of bonded silicon (a natural element abundant in sand and rock) and oxygen, is increasingly filling this niche.\n\nTHIS IS EXCITING:\u00a0 Your question: Do homemade noodles have to dry before cooking?\n\nIs 100% silicone food safe?\n\nEssentially, a silicone material is generally food safe if it is listed as 100% food-grade silicone. Other materials within a silicone composition (fillers) may not have the same properties that make silicone so suitable for use in food applications.",

This means that they are never exposed to any antibiotics, growth hormones or animal by-products in their food. After the first 2-3 weeks, they are introduced to natural fields of pasture that have not been exposed to mass production agricultural practices or related chemicals for over 40 years. Unlike today\u2019s mass production factory facility raised chickens (they are not farms), more naturally raised, pastured chickens actually see the sun, breathe fresh air, interact with nature and have fresh new green life to explore each day.

        "text":"Often asked: How To Use Szechuan Pepper?\n\nWhat do you do with Sichuan pepper?\n\nIt has a powerful aroma and creates a unique numbing sensation in your mouth. Apart from being used as whole for stir-fries, braised dishes & hot pot, ground Sichuan pepper plays an important role in seasoning Chinese delicacies.\n\nHow do you eat Sichuan peppercorns?\n\nSichuan peppercorns should be heated before eaten or ground. Use whole peppercorns as called for in recipes, usually to flavor the cooking oil. In some recipes it\u2019s chopped up roughly with other ingredients as an ingredient or garnish.\n\nIs Szechuan pepper spicy?\n\nAnd they\u2019re not really peppers either. A spice indigenous to China, Sichuan peppercorns aren\u2019t actually pepper, but the dried red-brown berries of a type of ash tree. The smell of the peppercorn is intoxicating, lemony and perfumed, and the taste, electric.\n\nAre Sichuan peppercorns good for you?\n\nSome of the most significant components include vitamin A, potassium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc and phosphorus. Consuming Sichuan pepper may help increase the hemoglobin content in your body and stimulate the circulatory system as it contains a high amount of iron.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 FAQ: Who Sells Szechuan?\n\nShould I grind Sichuan peppercorns?\n\nIt\u2019s better to grind your peppercorns in small batches because they will lose their flavor quickly. Freshly ground Szechuan pepper is better fresh. Refrigerate any extra ground Szechuan pepper.\n\nAre pink peppercorns the same as Sichuan?\n\nPink peppercorns are actually the fruit of a completely different plant\u2014the Baies rose plant\u2014a small tree native to South America. Szechuan peppercorns also come from an entirely different plant, a type of prickly ash shrub native to northern China.\n\nWhat is the difference between Szechuan peppercorns and black peppercorns?\n\nUses, Benefits, and Recipes Classic dishes of Sichuan cuisine wouldn\u2019t be the same without Szechuan peppercorn. The Sichuan peppercorn by itself does not have more spicy hotness than black peppercorns, but the mouth tingle acts to enhance tastes.\n\nDo Sichuan peppercorns go bad?\n\nNo, commercially packaged dried peppercorns do not spoil, but they will start to lose potency over time and not flavor food as intended \u2013 the storage time shown is for best quality only.\n\nWhat is the difference between red and green Sichuan peppercorns?\n\nmuch like black pepper. What does that contain? Red Sichuan peppercorns have stronger flavour, while green Sichuan peppercorns have a milder flavour but have a stronger numbing effect.\n\nWhy is Szechuan so spicy?\n\nLocals will tell you that the reason they eat such punishingly spicy food is because of the climate. \u201d Sichuan sits in a basin, so it gets quite humid,\u201d Du says. These pungent flavors are a hallmark of Sichuan cuisine, and they also lend themselves to another regional export: spicy hot pot.\n\nYou might be interested:\u00a0 Often asked: Which Mcdoanlds Have Szechuan Sauce?\n\nWhich is hotter Hunan or Szechuan?\n\nThe end result of Szechuan chicken is sweet and spicy while Hunan chicken is plain and hotter. Hunan chicken has its fresh hot chili added as the major ingredient but Szechuan\u2019s main ingredient of chili is mixed with pepper paste. This makes Hunan chicken spicier.\n\nHow spicy is Sichuan food?\n\nSichuan food is most well-known for its hot and spicy flavor, though it may sport sweet and sour flavors too. The most commonly used spices you can find in most households and eateries are \u201cThe Five Fragrances\u201d which consist of fennel, pepper, aniseed, cinnamon, and clove; chili and Sichuan pepper.\n\nWhy were Sichuan peppercorns banned?\n\nFrom 1968 to 2005, the United States Food and Drug Administration banned the importation of Sichuan peppercorns because they were found to be capable of carrying citrus canker (as the tree is in the same family, Rutaceae, as the genus Citrus).\n\nWritten by\n\nLeave a Reply",

        "text":"\"Are you able to provide table linen and cutlery & crockery?\"\n\nYes we provide a comprehensive range of hire ware.\n\n\"Can you cook indoors?\"\n\nCooking the whole roast indoors isn't ideal. We tend to cook outside then bring the machine in once the cooking is done. The burners are then left on tick-over during the service period.\n\n\"Do you precook the pig\/hog?\"\n\nNo, never. Our quality meat deserves nothing less than being cooked freshly at your event. You can only ensure perfect crackling by freshly cooking your pig at the location. We certainly never reheat any of our meat.\n\n\"How much space do I require for a pig\/hog roast?\"\n\nWe can operate in a surprisingly small area. We only require a space of 12 square foot. A standard domestic 13 amp power supply is helpful but not essential.\n\n\"How long does a spit-roast take?\"\n\nA pig will take on average 6 -7 hours.\u00a0\nA lamb will take on average between 3-4 hours.\nA whole hind of beef 7-10\n\n\"What happens if it rains?\"\n\nFirstly it probably won't! If it does rain we simply cook and serve under our canopy if an indoor area is not available.\n\n\"How many people can you cater for?\"\n\nWe pride ourselves on being totally flexible. We can cater for groups numbering between 20 and 2000.\n\n\"If my event is for less than 50 can we still have a pig roast?\"\n\nYes, of course. It will cost a little more per guest as most of our overheads remain the same but it can be done. (Steer clean of anyone suggesting a roasted leg joint! It's just not suited for a spit roast)\n\n\"Do you only provide pig roasts\/hogs?\"\n\nNo, the Piggy Squire is primarily a catering company that specialises in Hog Roast and Barbecues. As such we provide the most amazing canapes and desserts as well as amazing vegetarian menus.\n\n\"Do you cater for vegetarians?\"\n\nThe Piggy Squire delivers an unforgettable experience for all. Vegetarians are never treated as an afterthought.\n\n\"Can we a combine a pig roast and a lamb roast?\"\n\nYes, of course.\n\n\"Are you a registered food business?\"\n\nYes, we are registered with Cherwell District Council. We\u2019re proud to have held the 5 star food hygiene rating since its introduction in 2009.\n\n\"Do you hold public liability insurance?\"\n\nYes we hold 10 Million public and product liability.\n\n\"What areas do you cover?\"\n\nThe Piggy Squire provides Hog Roasts in Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and West London.\n\nHot potatoes\n\nThe Piggy Squire is based in Bicester, Oxfordshire.

Thank-you!\nLori L.\n\nCustomer demand. Every day, more and more people are realizing they have a sensitivity to gluten. They may have been recently diagnosed with Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity or just want to live a Gluten Free lifestyle and still want to enjoy their favourite pizza and subs.\n\nWhat is gluten?\n\nGluten is the protein found in wheat, barley, rye and related wheat species such as spelt and kamut. It helps baked goods keep their form and chewy texture and is also added to other food items more and more, both for consistency and taste purposes.\n\nWhat is Celiac Disease?\n\nCeliac disease is a medical condition in which the absorptive surface of the small intestine is damaged by a substance called gluten. This results in an inability of the body to absorb nutrients: protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, which are necessary for good health.\nAlthough statistics are not readily available, it is estimated that 1 in 133 persons in Canada are affected by celiac disease.\n\nA wide range of symptoms may be present. Symptoms may appear together or singularly in children or adults. In general, the symptoms of untreated celiac disease indicate the presence of malabsorption due to the damaged small intestine. For more information please visit\u00a0http:\/\/www.celiac.ca\n\nAre GlutenGone\u2122 Menu Items Gluten Free?\n\nLove your gluten-free pizza!Can\u2019t wait to try the GF subs! Thanks for offering gluten-free products.\nCindy M.\n\nGreco Pizza\u2019s GlutenGone\u2122 Menu Selections are made with ingredients that are not made with gluten, however\u00a0Greco cannot certify that they are 100% gluten free.\u00a0Our GlutenGone\u2122 Menu items are prepared in Greco Pizza restaurants, that also produce products made with gluten, therefore there is the possibility of cross contamination of gluten between these products. Any person with a severe reaction to gluten should not consider these to be 100% gluten free. GlutenGone\u2122 menu is NOT recommended for Celiac patients. There is always the small risk of cross contamination.\n\nWhat does Greco do to lessen the risk of cross contamination with GlutenGone products in their stores?\n\nThere is always the small risk that a GlutenGone product could have come in contact with minute particles of gluten in the restaurant. Even small particles of flour can become airborne in the restaurant and contaminate GlutenGone products. While this risk is minimal and the amount of gluten would be very small Greco advises any customers who have a severe reaction to gluten to be aware that we cannot certify 100% that gluten is not in any GlutenGone products.

        "text":"Request Our Free Catalog!\nRequest our free home brewing catalog and get on our email specials mailing list. Our paper catalog features our entire line of home brewing, winemaking, and coffee roasting products, and getting on our email specials list is a good way to hear about our special weekly offers.\n\n\u00a0 Connect with William's\n\n\n1. Beginners\n\n1. 1 What do I need to start?\n\nTo get started in home brewing, you will need a fermenter, priming tank, hydrometer, thermometer, bottle capper, caps, bottles (48 twelve oz. pry-off beer bottles or equivalent for a 5 gallon batch), 4' of siphon tubing, sanitizing solution, basic guidebook, and ingredients for your first batch, usually a brewing kit. Check out our Home Breweries (page 3 of our paper catalog, or our website) for a package deal on what you need to get started.\n\n1.2 What type of beer is easiest?\n\nEasiest to brew are ales, wheat beers, stouts, and porters. All of these use hardy ale yeast, which can ferment at warmer temperatures (60\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 F.), and mature faster than the fussier lager beers. Ales can be ready to drink 5 weeks after the start of the brewing process. Lagers are the hardest to brew because they require refrigerated fermentation and aging for an authentic flavor. A lager should be brewed at 51\u00b0- 55\u00b0 F., and aged at 40\u00b0 F for at least 6 weeks after bottling.\n\n1.3 Can I make beer without alcohol?\n\nIt is extremely difficult to make beer without alcohol. We have tried fermenting beer, and then boiling it for an hour to remove the alcohol, but found that a 4% beer still had over 2% alcohol in it after an hour boil. The problem is, when you boil beer that is fermented, you also boil some yeast cells, which give the beer an unpleasant cooked yeast flavor. Commercial breweries use advanced centrifuges and filters to remove alcohol without damaging heat, equipment that is not available to the home brewer. It is possible to make a low alcohol beer (under 3%) beer at home, by using a low amount of fermentable malt extract (4 lbs. in 5 gallons), although the beer will have a correspondingly weaker flavor than a beer made with 6 lbs. of malt extract or more.\n\n1.4 How long does it take to make a batch?\n\nFor our Beginner Kits, allow 5 weeks from starting the yeast pack to drinking your first bottle. For Intermediate Kits, allow up to 3 months for extended refrigerating aging if they are lagers or pilsners, and 5 weeks for ales. Our William's Mead Kit requires about 6 months from start to finish.\n\n2. William's Brewing Kits\n\n2.1 What is the difference between a kit rated beginner and one rated intermediate?\n\nA William's Brewing Kit rated beginner is designed for the first time brewer, and does not require strict temperature control, two step fermentation, or other steps. Keep in mind that a kit rated beginner can produce just as good a beer as a kit rated intermediate, the only difference is that the kit rated intermediate is a more difficult style of beer to brew.\n\n2.2 My kit says to use a single fermenter. Can I use a primary and secondary fermenter instead?\n\nAlthough you can use a two stage fermentation method with any of our kits, we specify a simple one step fermentation because it is easier for the first time brewer. If you are just starting out, brew the kit with the specified one step fermentation, as there is less chance of bacterial infection because the beer is handled less. If you\u0019ve brewed a few batches, go ahead and use your usual two-stage method.\n\n2.3 My William's Brewing Kit says to wait 14 days before I can bottle. Can I bottle sooner?\n\nIt is best to wait the full 14 days before bottling, even if the finishing gravity has dropped to or below the recommended level. This is because there is still yeast in suspension, which would lead to a heavy yeast sediment in the bottles if bottled too soon. There is also the danger that the beer may still be fermenting, and if bottled too soon, even if the recommended finishing gravity has been reached, it may continue to ferment and lead to dangerously over carbonated bottled beer.\n\nIf you are concerned that the yeast sediment in the fermenter may taint the beer (more of a concern in 75\u00b0 F. + conditions and with light flavored beers), transfer the beer to a secondary fermenter and wait until the 14 day fermentation period is over. Keep in mind that you still need to take two hydrometer readings before bottling: the first after 12 days or so to determine if the finishing gravity has been reached, and the second a couple of days later to make sure the gravity has stopped dropping and the beer is safe to bottle.\n\n2.4 How long will William's Brewing Kits last before I make them?\n\nIf refrigerated upon arrival, figure 6 months as the normal shelf life. If stored at room temperature, figure 2 months as the normal shelf life. The yeast is the most perishable part of the kit, and should be refrigerated for long term storage.\n\n2.5 Can I get the formulation for a William's Brewing Kit?\n\nKit recipes are proprietary and are not released. Released details are limited to the paper and web catalog kit descriptions. If you are looking to formulate a specific recipe, additional help can be found from our Customer Support Department. William's Customer Support is available to all current customers. For information on formulating your own recipes, we suggest a good recipe book, as listed in our paper and web catalog in the book section.\n\n2.6 What are the hops in my William's Brewing Kit?\n\nLike all formulated products, kit recipes are proprietary and are not released. Released details are limited to the paper and web catalog kit descriptions. If you are looking to formulate a specific recipe, additional help can be found from our Customer Support Department. William's Customer Support is available to all current customers.\u00a0 For information on formulating your own recipes, we suggest a good recipe book, as listed in our paper and web catalog in the book section.\u00a0\n\n3. Ingredients\n\n3.1 Malt extract or grain mashing, which method should I use?\n\nMalt extract is used by the majority of brewers because it saves a lot of time, but brewing direct from grain is definitely the way to go for the brewer who wants maximum control over his or her beer. Outstanding beers can be produced with today's improved malt extracts, so we recommend that you start with malt extract (the malt extract manufacturer has done the mashing for you). After you get a feel for the brewing process, try an all grain batch, which requires more time and specialized equipment.\n\n3.2 Syrup or dry malt extract, which is better?\n\nMalt extract is available in two forms, syrup and dry. Both are capable of producing excellent beers. Syrup malt extract is generally less expensive per pound, and more varieties are available, making it the first choice of most brewers. It is subjected to less heat during processing than dry malt extract, and can make a lighter colored beer if an excellent quality lighter grade is selected. Dry Malt Extract, on the other hand, is easier to measure out than syrup, and is 20% stronger per pound than syrup malt extract, because it does not contain water.\n\n3.3 How long will William's Malt Extracts last, and how should I store them?\n\nWilliam's Syrup malt extract will keep for a year or longer if kept in a cool place (although it darkens over time), and should be refrigerated if the package has been opened. We have heard of customers using sealed pouched that were stored for 2 or 3 years, although the beer will of course not be as fresh flavored as if the malt was fresher. If you have opened a pouch and squeezed out some of the extract, seal it back up by rolling up the corner of the bag and sealing with a large paper clip. Put it in the refrigerator and it will keep for up to a year.\n\nWilliam's Dry malt extract will keep for several years without darkening if protected from moisture, although if a bag is left open to the outside air, the dry malt will quickly harden into a sticky lump as it absorbs humidity.\n\n3.4 How long will whole and crushed grains last?\n\nWilliam's malted grain, in either whole or crushed form, will keep for up to 2 years if stored in the original 1 lb. oxygen barrier package. This is because, unlike coffee, grain has no oils to evaporate when crushed, so the crushed form keeps just about as well as the whole form. The whole form has a slight edge when bought by the sack, however, as our sacks do not have oxygen barrier liners, and the grain has more of a chance of moisture getting in and degrading the flavor. Figure that whole grain in sacks will last at least a year, and crushed grain in sacks will last at least 7 months. Storage in a cool dry area is best.\n\n3.5 Are your grain malts fully modified?\n\nAll grain malts sold by William's Brewing are sufficiently modified to fully convert in a simple one-temperature infusion mash at 152\u00b0-158\u00b0 F. You may still want to do a multiple temperature rest decoction mash to reduce the likelihood of protein haze in the finished beer, although it is not required.\n\n3.6 How do I use flaked ingredients? Do they have to be mashed?\n\nFlaked ingredients like flaked barley, corn, rice, and oats must be mashed with pale malt to convert their starches to sugars. To do this, mix the flaked adjunct with an equal amount of crushed pale malt, mix in \u00bc gallon of 170\u00b0 F. water for each pound of grain mix, and hold for 1 hour at 155 F\u00b0. before sparging to remove the grain sugars from the husks. You will need some basic mashing equipment to do this. Merely steeping them before the boil will impart some flavor, but is not good brewing practice, as the grains will become quite gummy, and starch haze may form in the finished beer.\n\n3.7 What is toasted malt, and how do I obtain it?\n\nToasted malt is just common pale malt (crushed or whole) that has been heated on a cookie sheet in an oven at 350\u00b0 F. for 20 to 30 minutes before using. This heat imparts a slight nutty flavor to the grain. You can do this with any two or s... (truncated)",

        "text":"Can I use lurpak for baking cookies?\n\nCan you use Lurpak instead of butter for cookies?\n\nThere was only one problem: the loss of the wonderful flavour of butter. \u2026 These so-called spreadable butters do, however, vary and we have found Lurpak is the best because it has the highest butter content, and because it has the least additives it is the purest.\n\nIs Lurpak spreadable suitable for baking?\n\nPerfect for all your food adventures, be it baking, spreading, drizzling, mixing, frying\u2026 we have a range of butter & spreadables to meet your needs. With Lurpak by your side you\u2019re always ready to start cooking.\n\nCan you use spreadable butter for cookies?\n\nWhy Whipped Won\u2019t Work\n\nOther tub butters marked as \u201cspreadable\u201d are a 50\/50 blend of regular butter and plant oils \u2013 usually canola \u2013 and result in dense, greasy cookies. Oil cannot be substituted in cookie recipes calling for butter, because oil is 100 percent fat, whereas butter also has protein and milk solids.\n\nCan I use spread instead of butter for baking?\n\nThe baking spread is a substitute for butter. It is not butter, but rather, a butter-like spread made of bovine fat and other ingredients. \u2026 Palm oil is the most common ingredient for making margarine. Margarine\u2019s water content is also less than 20%, making margarine a good choice for baking and similar projects.\n\nTHIS IS INTERESTING:\u00a0 Should I blind bake a fruit pie?\n\nCan I use Country Life Spreadable for baking?\n\nUse Country Life\u00ae Spreadable straight from the tub on fresh bread or toast. It\u2019s a perfect ingredient for cooking and is delicious in home baking or roasting.\n\nIs Aldi norpak the same as Lurpak?\n\nAldi sells \u201cNorpak\u201d rather than \u201cLurpak\u201d. The names are similar and so is the packaging and theme. Consumers understand that Norpak isn\u2019t just butter but it\u2019s a butter that bears strong similarities to the key distinctive characteristics of Lurpak.\n\nCan I use vegetable oil spread instead of butter for cookies?\n\nVegetable oil is a viable substitute for butter when baking cookies. You will likely need to use a smaller amount to keep your cookies from being greasy.\n\nWhat can I use if I don\u2019t have a stick of butter?\n\nSubstitutes for Unsalted Butter\n\nIf you find your fridge empty in the butter department or can\u2019t tolerate dairy, you can swap it completely with these butter replacements. For 1 cup unsalted butter, substitute 1 cup shortening, \u215e cup (that\u2019s 14 Tbsp. or \u00be cup plus 2 Tbsp.) vegetable oil, or \u215e cup lard.\n\nCan you use Country Crock instead of butter for cookies?\n\nYes! Country Crock\u00ae is great for cooking and baking. Certain Country Crock\u00ae products can be swapped 1:1 for butter in cooking and baking recipes: Country Crock\u00ae Baking Sticks and Country Crock\u00ae Plant Butter sticks and tubs. \u2026 Both our Salted and Unsalted Country Crock\u00ae Baking Sticks are perfect for baking.\n\nIs Lurpak a healthy butter?\n\nLurpak spreadable unsalted\n\nAmanda\u2019s verdict: This spread is a good choice if trying to limit salt in your diet. It is high in total fats but lower in polyunsaturated fats compared with other spreadable examples.\n\nTHIS IS INTERESTING:\u00a0 What temperature do I bake frozen chicken strips?\n\nIs margarine worse than butter?\n\nMargarine usually tops butter when it comes to heart health. Margarine is made from vegetable oils, so it contains unsaturated \u201cgood\u201d fats \u2014 polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. These types of fats help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or \u201cbad,\u201d cholesterol when substituted for saturated fat.",
