Bluegrass, folk, country music, timeless music, music sung around the moonshine still, sung on the back porch, sun setting; hills glistening . . .\n\nAmericana and roots music has a long lineage. Bill Monroe, Bob Dylan, The Band, the Grateful Dead to today's heroes, Whiskeytown and Wilco, the family tree of roots music is enormous. John McGaraghan is just another in the long standing tradition of this genre.\n\nWhile he is influenced by the sounds of his ancestors, he is by no means weighed down by the past as Nietzsche often warned. No, hardly, John creates his own disparate sound. Lyrics and instrumentation, which often call to mind the spirits of Monroe and Parsons, yet he refuses to become a side act or a purveyor of \"show tunes\".\n\n. . . Six shooters on main street, dust and beer on their faces as they enter the saloon. \"One beer, here, hell let's make it a whiskey\", shouted through the menacing air. Boots, and spurs jangle . . .\n\nImagine if you will, the best of all roots rock, ever. The high vocals of Bill Monroe, with the bluegrass chop, the harmonies of Crosby Stills and Nash. Mix in somber lyrics of love and loss ala Parsons, then a dash of Merry Prankster psychedelia. That would be the perfect definition of John's music and sound.\n\nHere, amongst us in the modern day, during the time of boy bands and hatred-fueled bands, he creates a sound that may not belong. A slip or tear in the space time continuum one can assume. For it seems strange that a man boding such an array of talents and thoughts could operate during this time period. Let's just say it is a secret. A treasure, like that old goldmine, or hidden patch of forest, with the flowing stream, trout jumping as you stand alone tying your fly. Yes, it is there and it is for you to enjoy.\n\n. . . Appalachia, the high lonesome sound, banjo strings, rusting, while the porch planks squeak under the pressure of people dancing to that high lonesome sound. Leather hats, become soaked in sweat love sweet love under the stars, moon and stars . . .\n\nFor over fifteen years John McGaraghan has been creating this sound, this secret stream. His previous outfits, Oversoul and King Harvest, garnered serious attention for their groundbreaking mixtures of americana, psychedelia, and pure roots rock and roll. Since their disbandment, John has forged his way into the deep apotheosis of Americana. His pursuit for that sound, to not just copy the paradigm, but recreate it, has led him back to his native stomping grounds of California. Land of the gold rush, land of golden hills, of Americana. Slowly his music is bearing the fruits of the move. Songs like \"Northern California in the Rain\" and \"Lost Along the Way\" bear the innocence of his ancestors, yet are redolent with his life affirming adventures. We as the crowd can only enjoy this treasure, cherish it and hope that his pursuit and path continues.\n\n. . . The suns set, and the folks sleep. Six shooters lay drunk on the bar as the ragtime chords keep emanating from the upright piano. Wet heads, wet leather hats smelling musty and old, moonshine, comfortable and known. The planks stop squeaking. Finally, the planks stop squeaking. And the moon keeps shining . . .\n\n--c.f.orman, 1999\n\nAmazon Recommended Links\n\nSign up to receive email updates regarding john's music and schedule of events\nfirst name:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 last name:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 email:",

Her performances and recordings have been reviewed by newspapers such as (to mention just a few) \u2018il giornale della musica\u2019, \u2018La Repubblica\u2019 and \u2018il Manifesto\u2019. They have been presented and broadcast by stations such as RAI Radio 3, Radio Classica, Radio Svizzera Italiana and Rete Toscana Classica.\n\nFor years involved in intense performance activity, mainly as a soloist, she has performed in some of the most important musical centers, in cities such as Florence, Rome, Vienna, Belgrade, Sapporo, Tokyo.\n\nTwo CDs were published by EMA Vinci Records in 2017: a monograph on Erik Satie and a disk dedicated to composers from the Tuscan area during \u200b\u200bthe second half of the twentieth century. This recording, which was included in the SIAE-Classici di Oggi collection, contains music by Carlo Prosperi, Piero Luigi Zangelmi, Gaetano Giani Luporini and Giuseppe Bonamici.\n\nThe CD of composers from the Tuscan area inaugurates her interpretative research on the repertoire of historic twentieth century and contemporary music. In 2019 she contacted the Scientific-Literary G. P. Vieusseux Research Center of Florence to perform and disseminate unpublished scores by Carlo Prosperi, kept in the Prosperi Collection of the \u201cA. Bonsanti\u201d Contemporary Archive, and to prepare a new performance, almost 45 years after the world premiere of Prosperi\u2019s \u2018Rainbow Concert\u2019 (il Concerto dell\u2019Arcobaleno) for piano, marimba and orchestra. The unreleased pieces and the concert were both scheduled for the autumn of 2019 in two events organized by the G.A.M.O. \u2013 which included these in its fortieth year of artistic activity \u2013 in collaboration with the G.P. Vieusseux Research Center, the International Lyceum Club in Florence and the \u2018Filharmonie\u2019 Orchestra.\n\nTwo of Carlo Prosperi\u2019s unpublished pieces, kindly loaned by the Maestro\u2019s daughter Giuliana Prosperi, were published by EMA Vinci Records in a piano anthology released for SIAE-Classici di Oggi in the autumn of 2019, together with six album pieces by Piero Luigi Zangelmi.\n\nThe year 2019 also saw the release, again by EMA Records and for SIAE-Classici di oggi, of a monograph on Claudio Jos\u00e8 Boncompagni, containing pieces for solo piano and for piano and voice, which Baldaccini performs together with Monica Benvenuti.\n\nSince 2019 Baldaccini has been collaborating with the composers Daniele Venturi, Carlo Galante, Fabrizio De Rossi Re and Mauro Montalbetti. With Montalbetti she was the winner of the latest SIAE-Classici di oggi for the 2018 commission of contemporary cultural music. She collaborates with many other contemporary composers, also thanks to the lively and fruitful relationship with CLUSTER Association of Composers in Lucca. In this city she began her studies at the \u2018L. Boccherini Music Institute\u2019 in the class of Maria Gloria Belli, continuing at the Conservatory of Florence, where she studied harpsichord with Annaberta Conti and piano with Giovanni Carmassi. She graduated in both instruments with top marks and honors. She also studied at the Vienna University of Music and Representative Arts, in the harpsichord class of Maestro Gordon Murray. She graduated in the Literary Studies from the University of Florence.",
