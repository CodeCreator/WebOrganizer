        "text":"S.Africa: White Super-Farmers with Helicopters & Private Jet planes\n\nIn South Africa, we\u2019ve had farmers who were very wealthy in the past. When I got here in the 1980s there were farmers who were very wealthy.\n\nBut there is a side to black rule and the black seizure of land that I was never aware of until recently. This might even, in part, be helped along by Farm murders!\n\nDennis Fetcho once asked me: What happens to the land of the farmers that are killed? Doesn\u2019t this land just fall fallow and nobody uses it? To be honest I had never bothered to ask that question myself and his proposal seemed reasonable. But the answer may in fact be different.\n\nIn South Africa, over the last 25+ years another form of farming has grown, that of farming with wild animals. These animals become a tourist attraction and above all, these animals become big money spinners for hunters from the USA and elsewhere in the Western world. We get very valuable US Dollars and other Western monies from this.\n\nThe economics of Africa versus that of the USA and Europe is itself a fascinating topic because we whites in some ways benefit from the backwardness and high risk of Africa. It means our money is worth less. The down side is that if we want to leave Africa, we really struggle because our money doesn\u2019t buy us much overseas. Whereas monies coming in from overseas really buy a lot in South Africa. So you get many white pensioners from Britain and elsewhere who retire in South Africa and buy property here because they would NEVER be able to afford something similar in their own home country.\n\nGame Farmers in South Africa can make huge amounts of money. I attended an auction in April, of a farm, that was owned by such a Super-Farmer \u2013 a white guy. He not only owned a game farm where the land alone was worth R32 million ($2 million), but he owned many other businesses worth much more than that.\n\nIn this era of black rule, where farmers are murdered and thousands of farms have been seized by the Govt since 1996, you might think that the farming industry is ready to collapse, and in many ways it has suffered tremendous damage for MOST WHITE FARMERS! Most white farmers have struggled more. Most white farmers are worse off \u2026 but, enter the era of the Super-Farmers\u2026 the white farmers with personal helicopters and private jets!\n\nWhite farmers with personal helicopters and private jets never existed in the days of white rule to my knowledge. If they existed they must have been only a handful. But apparently there are quite a few such farmers these days and I think Game Farming is where you will find the most of these.\n\nSome of them even hobnob with President Ramaphosa who himself owns game farms and game! Yes! Our black communist President has stacks of money himself in farming, and billions of Rands in many other industries, primarily health companies (and there is all sorts of talk of weird corruption whereever he and his brother go!).\n\nI learned earlier this year that there are quite a lot of these super-farmers around who attend meetings and auctions, by arriving in their personal helicopters, etc.\n\nMy guess is that these farmers may have benefited from the damage that the blacks, including the farm murders, may have brought to this country. People forget that South Africa is very business orientated and capitalistic still. If anyone has something serious to sell, like land, especially at a cheaper price, there will be buyers.\n\nI know of a farmer who lost his farm to black land seizure (paid for of course on the \u201cwilling buyer, willing seller\u201d principle). He took the money and bought farms next to the farm he had lost. Later when the blacks did absolutely bugger all on his former farm and it was going to ruin, the farmer went and he rented part of his former farm from the blacks and he farms on it! He makes money even though he\u2019s renting his former farm! The blacks are producing nothing and doing nothing! But he is still carrying on and doing very well!\n\nThere were 60,000 white farmers in SA before the blacks took over. The last I heard, there were 30,000 left (maybe even a bit less now). It could be that some of the farmers who remained bought up extra land and were able to make more money out of it since the demand for crops and even more so for Game Farming has either remained constant or grown. So while most farmers went downhill there are those who had the means to do well.\n\nSome may even have made money in other industries and then invested in farming and were able to overcome the problems that a traditional farmer had. There are quite a lot of white businessmen, who when they can, go into farming. White men love farms and farming. I had a cousin who made money in engineering and then used it to set up a game farm for himself. So it could be these types of guys who were able to come in and have the financial backing of their own to survive where the common white farmer previously could not.\n\nThis turmoil that has come from the blacks and black rule shows once again that when given a chance, there are whites who can survive and prosper. But its not always easy for the common man. Similarly in Zimbabwe I knew people who made lots of money in business and then also got into farming. There were even white farmers who made money despite the communism and the many communist rules in Zimbabwe! So astoundingly, in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia), there were less white farmers, and THEY MADE MORE MONEY! The land is a more or less fixed quantity and they could expand and they found ways to survive black communism. Some of them became stinking rich. They didn\u2019t get to the helicopters and private planes stage of South Africa, but they were still damned well off.\n\nSo this may be the untold story of black rule. The same is true for the corporate and business world.\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cS.Africa: White Super-Farmers with Helicopters & Private Jet planes\n\n  \u2022 13th September 2018 at 1:28 pm\n\n    White Judas Goats, in bed with the jew communists and their black sock puppets. They need to be taken care of. They don\u2019t give a hoot about other whties in SA, they only think of themselves. Would these pieces of white scum ever donate to help the SA whites living in the squatter camps? Would they give the whites jobs on their super farms? NO, they struck a deal with the niggerpuppets-in-charge to only employ niggers and wogs and now Chinese.\n\n    Would these POS white super-farmers donate arms, training, equipment to the whites under attack by the niggers and their jew stringpullers? I doubt it\u2026..\n\n    Chinese are waiting in the wings to pick up the farms for a song, and remember the jews control China just like they do Israel and USA and Europe and Australia and all other countries with Rothschild banks.\n\n\n    (NOTE: Syria does not have a Rothschild bank, why are we not surprised that jew puppet Trump wants to bomb hell out of Syria.).\n\n    Will Whitey ever awaken to his peril?\n\n    \u2022 13th September 2018 at 3:30 pm\n\n      The problem I\u2019ve seen with the rich is that they do little, and often nothing for other whites. I have heard of one who donated money for protection for some guys who were protecting the farms. But on the whole, the rich do nothing. And they hobnob with the enemy too much.\n\n      Many of these guys who become rich farmers like this are professional people (e.g. medical field) or businesses people from the cities. They make money in the city, then they buy farms. So they have cash flow that goes into those farms unlike the guys who only have the farms and nothing else.\n\n      But yeah, as a rule: The rich do fuckall for the other whites.\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

Vermont has actually had a 36-hour respite from our daily 12 inch dumps of snow and frozen rain BUT...)\n\nWhat I'm talking about is the talk between some Democrats. And no, I'm not talking solely about Hillary Clinton and her entourage vs. Barack Obama and his Oprah machine. Every day in my travels, mostly online but also off, I see people beating up the other candidate in ways that would give the anti-Clinton elves like Ann Coulter jealousy that they didn't think of the nastiness first.\n\nOK, true, neither Barack nor Hillary is Perfect, by whatever definition we choose to assign to that term. And as much as I have long lists of pros and cons for each of the two, I'm still feeling rather deadlocked, Vermont primary over aside.\n\nBut they're like soooooooo freaking much better than what the Republicans want to give us - John McCain, one of those rare men who is actually much more difficult to deal with when he thinks he's winning than he is petulant and tyrannical when he's not winning (see the leadup to how he quit the 2000 presidential race and his frequent meltdowns, usually in the media's face).\n\nSome call McCain a war hero. I once did. But the first time he said it was worth it to stay in Iraq when he knew we have lost SO many soldiers and far more innocent Iraqi civilians meant he was no longer a hero, but another ambitious dickhead with a God complex who never minds leading lambs to slaughter \"for a good enough cause\" (read: his own).\n\nAnd when I remember who I don't want to see in the White House next January, Hillary and Barack sure look pretty damned good by comparison.

        "text":"Wednesday, May 27, 2009\n\nWhy oh why do a few Jews make it hard for Jews generally??\n\nOnce again I am going to go out on a limb and half cut off the branch behind me. But I seem to be one of the few who is ready to speak the unspeakable so I think I should take up that burden again.\n\nJews are overall exceptionally generous givers. They donate large amounts to charities and to causes that they see as worthy. I gather that around 50% of the funding for Mr Obama's election campaign came from Jews, despite the fact that Jews are only a small fraction of the U.S. population. You may question the wisdom of those donations (I do) but you cannot fault the generosity of them.\n\nSadly, however, that is good news and one look at any newspaper will tell you that it is bad news that people are interested in and take note of. And bad news about Jews will, sadly, be particularly noted. Jews are just too prominent in the community for it to be otherwise. And one set of foul deeds can negate a large set of good deeds.\n\nSo I come to Mr Anthony Steen (Stein) above. He is one of Britain's most well-known Jews. He has been a member of parliament since 1974 and in that time has served on many public bodies. His appalling behaviour has been noted on several occasions -- abusing a secretary who did not know who he was, parking his car in disabled zones etc. And he has always been impenitent about his misdeeds, though an apology usually gets forced out of him eventually.\n\nIn his latest performance he has however excelled himself. He is one of the many British politicians who have been caught up in the scandal of misused personal expense allowances. Most of those caught have shown embarrassment and been penitent to some degree but Steen was at his most impenitent when he was confronted and refused to admit to any wrongdoing at all. You can read the whole sorry story here. Rather than admitting any fault for his large and improper expenses claims, he went on the attack and said that his critics were just jealous of his large house -- which of course put pictures of his house into most British newspapers. See above.\n\nIt is hard to convey how offensive all that would have been to most Brits. The British are characterized by a self-effacing culture. If you inadvertently tread on a British man's foot, HE will usually apologize, despite being the injured party. Arrogance, ostentation and boasting are about as un-British as you can get. And yet here is a well-known Jew flaunting all those characteristics in public.\n\nPerhaps there are occasions when that would not matter but Britain now is not one of them. Antisemitism has in recent years become acceptable in conversations among Britain's educated classes. And Steen will be seen as a graphic confirmation of all those opinions.\n\nTo be a Jew is to be in the public eye and given all the accusations that have been levelled at Jews over the years, people will be alert to bad Jewish behaviour. It may not be entirely rational but that is the way it is. One foul man can destroy the good work of thousands. It is the bad news that will be noted, not the good.\n\nThe only reason I am writing this at all is that I am aware that there is a certain cohesion among the Jewish community in a given area. If they do not see one another at shul, they see one-another at charitable functions etc. And it is my probably vain hope that the wiser members of such communities will press other Jews to avoid public displays of arrogance and ostentation. Perhaps that already happens to some degree but I think it should be carried to the point of shunning any offenders who do not reform. That way, if someone like Anthony Steen comes to public notice again, members of the local Jewish community can say: \"We do not recognize him as one of us. We deplore his behaviour as much as you do\".\n\nThat could be a big help.\n\nThursday, May 21, 2009\n\nNisbett answered by Rushton & Jensen\n\nWhen the first publicity for Nisbett's recent book on IQ came out, I said: \"I have not read the book and nothing in the review encourages me to do so but I assume that some of my colleagues who specialize in IQ studies will read it and dissect it in due course. Meanwhile, I just offer a few comments that occur to me\".\n\nMy expectation has now been fulfilled. I have just received from J.P. Rushton the draft of a paper which dissects Nisbett's arguments in detail. It is in the form of a book review so should see academic publication fairly soon.\n\nAs I also expected, the liberties taken with the facts by Nisbett are enormous. If there is only one finding out of 5 that suits Nisbett, he will quote that one finding and ignore the other 4. That is a caricature of how real science is done.\n\nMany of the points that Rushton & Jensen make are similar to points I have made in my various comments on Nisbett (See here, here and here) but Rushton & Jensen give the actual figures complete with full references.\n\nAs the paper is in draft, I cannot quote any of it directly but I can quote an excerpt that they provide from Flynn. Flynn has been one of the chief proponents of environmental rather than genetic influences on IQ and Nisbett relies on him heavily for some of his arguments. Flynn does however listen to those on the genetic side of the debate and he has recently changed his tune considerably. The following is from page 85 of Flynn's 2008 book.\nThere are two messages. The first is familiar: You cannot dismiss black gains on whites just because they do not tally with the g loadings of subtests. But the second is new and unexpected. The brute fact that black gains on whites do not tally with g loadings tells us something about causes. The causes of the black gains are like hearing aids. They do cut the cognitive gap but they are not eliminating the root causes. And conversely, if the root causes are somehow eliminated, we can be confident that the IQ gap and the g gap will both disappear\".\n\nIn other words, Flynn accepts that there is an underlying black\/white difference in IQ that cannot be traced to environmental factors. Nisbett quotes a lot from Flynn but he does NOT quote that conclusion.\n\nAnd Rushton & Jensen also report empirical tests of the arm-waving assertions that emanate from Leftists about black environmental disadvantage. None of the assertions are in fact borne out by the research findings.\n\nIn that connection I found out about a quite remarkable fact that I was not previously aware of. What if a little kid came from such a poor environment that he had to be hospitalized for malnutrition and was then adopted out into a white family? One would think that a kid from such a background would be permanently handicapped. They obviously would not come from an elite family to start with and nutrition during infancy is known to be very important to subsequent development. Yet precisely that experience has happened to considerable numbers of children from East Asian backgrounds (Korea etc.). I think you know what I am going to say: Far from being dumb, these kids were after only a few years scoring ABOVE the white average on IQ! Genetics triumph! East Asians are of course in general smarter than we Anglos. Their weakness is that they respect authority too much.\n\nLeftists will of course argue that the finding simply show what a wonderful job white adoptive parents do but isn't it odd that blacks adopted by whites still stay close to THEIR average racial IQ -- i.e. around a whole standard deviation below whites -- particularly if we look at adult IQ rather than IQ measured during childhood. It is an old truth that efforts to raise black IQ sometimes seem to be doing some good during childhood but by adulthood the improvement vanishes. Needless to say, Nisbett quotes adoption studies where IQ was measured in childhood and ignores major studies where IQ was measured in adulthood.\n\nIn most fields of science, work as incompetent as Nisbett's would earn him nothing but scorn from his colleagues but Nisbett is already heavily laden with honours and will no doubt receive even more honours before long. The human race loves its myths far more than it loves facts.\n\nTuesday, May 19, 2009\n\nLeaky Jonathan has discovered Nisbett\n\nJonathan Leake is the science writer for the London \"Times\" who can always be relied upon to draw the most politically correct conclusions -- no matter how much he has to distort the facts. Some of his global warming reports are classics of deliberate distortion. He has now discovered Nisbett's work on the flexibility of IQ and has taken Nisbett's determined optimism fully on board. Since I have already fisked a lot of Nisbett's assertions (See here and here), I won't say a lot here but a few comments are in order.\n\nThe more you know about a subject, the more laughable some of the assertions are. One of the recommendations for making your kid smarter, for instance, is to teach them delay of gratification. Yet my careful psychometric research on that subject (psychometrics is notoriously absent from delay of gratification research) showed that such a thing hardly exists. The popular tasks for assessing a kid's tendency to delay gratification correlate with one-another hardly at all. Delay of gratification is highly situational. It is not a stable trait like IQ is. Yet it is precisely the hope of those who recommend delay of gratification training that delay of gratification IS a stable and generalizable disposition.\n\nI think you should already be getting the impression that the conclusions Leftists such as Leake and Nisbett come to are more driven by hope than facts. Much of the argument put by readers of Nisbett is a straw man argument. They seem blissfully unaware that nobody has ever claimed that IQ is solely determined by genetics. Everybody has always conceded that a good or bad environment can also make a difference. A good environment can help you make the most of what genetics has given you. The usual estimate is about two thirds of the determination... (truncated)",

Back in 2006 the Republican controlled Legislature concocted a Rube Goldberg-style [school funding and business tax reform] measure that simultaneously cut property taxes, implemented a new \u201cmargins\u201d tax on business and rejiggered the way public schools are financed.\nProblem was, as the state Legislative Budget Board pointed out at the time, the plan\u2019s math didn\u2019t wash because the margins tax wouldn\u2019t bring in as much as the Legislature thought. In fact, the board said, it would leave a $5 billion hole in the state budget every year.\n\nThe upshot: Perry, who pushed the swap, knew full well he was helping to create today\u2019s \u201ccrisis.\u201d\nStar-Telegram: A 68-page report released by Texas Comptroller Susan Combs on Monday reveals that Texas will give business $32.2 billion worth of tax exemptions for sales, franchise, and gasoline and motor vehicle sales taxes for the 2011 fiscal year that ends on Aug. 31, 2011.\nExemptions to the state sales tax, the state's biggest source of revenue, will total $30.8 billion for the current fiscal year, Combs said, although some items exempted from the sales tax are taxed from other sources. Gasoline tax exemptions will amount to $113 million. Motor vehicle sales tax exemptions will total $125 million.\n\n\"While sales and use tax collections totaled $19.6 billion in fiscal 2010,\" Combs said, \"the tax is limited in scope when compared with the total number and kind of transactions in the economy, because of various exemptions and exclusions,\" Combs said.\n\nA number of lawmakers are calling for the elimination of at least some exemptions to boost revenue and help offset deep service reductions proposed in preliminary draft budgets. Others say canceling the breaks amounts to a tax increase, which Gov. Rick Perry and Republican legislative leaders have vowed to oppose.\n\nRead more at the Star-Telegram\nNYTimes OpEd \"Leaving Children Behind\" by Paul Krugman:\nConsider, as a case in point, what\u2019s happening in Texas, which more and more seems to be where America\u2019s political future happens first.\n\nTexas likes to portray itself as a model of small government, and indeed it is. Taxes are low, at least if you\u2019re in the upper part of the income distribution (taxes on the bottom 40 percent of the population are actually above the national average). Government spending is also low. And to be fair, low taxes may be one reason for the state\u2019s rapid population growth, although low housing prices are surely much more important.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: While low spending may sound good in the abstract, what it amounts to in practice is low spending on children, who account directly or indirectly for a large part of government outlays at the state and local level.\n\nAnd in low-tax, low-spending Texas, the kids are not all right. The high school graduation rate, at just 61.3 percent, puts Texas 43rd out of 50 in state rankings. Nationally, the state ranks fifth in child poverty; it leads in the percentage of children without health insurance. And only 78 percent of Texas children are in excellent or very good health, significantly below the national average.\n\nBut wait \u2014 how can graduation rates be so low when Texas had that education miracle back when former President Bush was governor? Well, a couple of years into his presidency the truth about that miracle came out: Texas school administrators achieved low reported dropout rates the old-fashioned way \u2014 they, ahem, got the numbers wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s not a pretty picture; compassion aside, you have to wonder \u2014 and many business people in Texas do \u2014 how the state can prosper in the long run with a future work force blighted by childhood poverty, poor health and lack of education.\n\nBut things are about to get much worse.\n\nA few months ago another Texas miracle went the way of that education miracle of the 1990s. For months, Gov. Rick Perry had boasted that his \u201ctough conservative decisions\u201d had kept the budget in surplus while allowing the state to weather the recession unscathed. But after Mr. Perry\u2019s re-election, reality intruded \u2014 funny how that happens \u2014 and the state is now scrambling to close a huge budget gap. (By the way, given the current efforts to blame public-sector unions for state fiscal problems, it\u2019s worth noting that the mess in Texas was achieved with an overwhelmingly nonunion work force.)\n\nSo how will that gap be closed? Given the already dire condition of Texas children, you might have expected the state\u2019s leaders to focus the pain elsewhere. In particular, you might have expected high-income Texans, who pay much less in state and local taxes than the national average, to be asked to bear at least some of the burden.\n\nBut you\u2019d be wrong. Tax increases have been ruled out of consideration; the gap will be closed solely through spending cuts. Medicaid, a program that is crucial to many of the state\u2019s children, will take the biggest hit, with the Legislature proposing a funding cut of no less than 29 percent, including a reduction in the state\u2019s already low payments to providers \u2014 raising fears that doctors will start refusing to see Medicaid patients. And education will also face steep cuts, with school administrators talking about as many as 100,000 layoffs.\n\nThe really striking thing about all this isn\u2019t the cruelty \u2014 at this point you expect that \u2014 but the shortsightedness. What\u2019s supposed to happen when today\u2019s neglected children become tomorrow\u2019s work force?\n\nAnyway, the next time some self-proclaimed deficit hawk tells you how much he worries about the debt we\u2019re leaving our children, remember what\u2019s happening in Texas, a state whose slogan right now might as well be \u201cLose the future.\u201d\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

will get accomplished and\nhappiness is near the horizon.\u00a0 Somewhere.\nScott, an average middle class white man with a mortgage, two\nchildren, a wife with high expectations and plans for their family,\nlistened to National Public Radio while aggressively speeding up and\nslowing down to get around trucks or other drivers of vehicles only\nwilling to do the speed limit.\n\u201cThe president arrived in Cuba today to tour the country and to\nwitness the closing of the Guantanamo prison.\u00a0 The last of the\nprisoners were sent to federal prisons in Louisiana, Kansas and\nIllinois.\u00a0 This comes as the next wave of political refugees from\nSyria, Yemen and Eritrea arrived in Atlanta\u2026\u201d\nScott turned to local news- all expressways designed in 1953 during\nthe Eisenhower administration, were jammed packed.\u00a0 The weather would\nbe warm, Blackhawks won, Bulls lost; thirteen people were shot in the\ncity of Chicago overnight, three dead, two in critical condition.\nScott noticed a large Ford truck that was raised to monster truck size\nin his rear view mirror.\u00a0 The tires on the truck hummed.\u00a0 The driver\nof the truck rode right on Scott\u2019s bumper until he moved from the far\nleft lane to the next lane over to the right.\u00a0 The truck sped up\nimpatiently.\u00a0 The bumper stickers on the back window of the truck\nread, \u201cShe\u2019s not my President\u201d, \u201cTrump 2020\u201d and \u201cHindsight 2020\u201d.\nScott profiled the asshole as he tailgated the next driver ahead of\nhim.\u00a0 White-undereducated- homophobic-xenophobic-misogynistic, Trump,\ngun, military loving, cow tipping, tobacco chewing, Country Music\nlistening, American and Confederate flag waving fellow\u2026 Citizen.\nGuys who fit several of the profiles listed, beat him up in high\nschool and at college parties but he found a woman who didn\u2019t want him\nto bench press his weight a dozen times and drunk wrestle guy friends\nin the backyard.\u00a0 Scott\u2019s wife wanted him to garden and do projects\naround the home.\u00a0 She wanted to go wine tasting and antiquing and take\nBallroom or Salsa dancing with Scott.\u00a0 They were tolerant people who\nloved diversity.\u00a0 They wanted to vote for Bernie but alas things did\nnot pan out.\u00a0 They both kept their Bernie stickers on the back of\ntheir electric cars.\nA minivan with a driver wearing some sort of shrouds crossed the\ndivider twice into the far right lane of the expressway.\u00a0 Scott\napplied the breaks to allow the driver to merge.\u00a0 Instead the driver\ndrifted back to the left back into their lane.\u00a0 Scott thought about\npunching it or getting behind the driver and move to the left lanes to\npass.\u00a0 Still having a bit of testosterone in his testis, he punched\nthe accelerator of his electric car and it raced forward the way a\nsemi does.\u00a0 Scott just about passed the minivan when it suddenly\ndrifted to the right and rammed his car.\u00a0 Scott lost control at the\nspeed of 58 miles per hour and careened into the wall.\u00a0 The driver in\nthe minivan never applied the breaks.\n\u201cWhat?\u00a0 What the fuck?\u00a0 What kind of a fucking asshole does this\nfucking shit and takes off?\u00a0 No fucking way!\u201d\nScott followed the van and called 911.\u00a0 He was loud and appeared to\nbe out of control.\n\u201cI am the victim of a hit and run!\u00a0 I am following the car now as we\nspeak\u2026\u00a0 I am travelling north on the 94 near Irving Park\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSir\u2026 Do you mean west?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean north\u2026\u00a0 It\u2019s 44 degrees and my screen on my dashboard\nsays north.\u00a0 I mean north, what the hell does that matter?\u201d\n\u201cIt matters to the police when they have to either go east towards\nDetroit or west towards Rockford\u2026\u00a0 Are you following that logic, sir?\u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u00a0 So do you have someone dispatched?\u00a0 This driver is not stopping\u2026\u201d\nOnce off the highway, Scott called 911 for the city of Chicago and\nanswered a slew of questions that just made him mad.\u00a0 Scott followed\ndriver all the way to a Halal meat shop.\u00a0 There were sweet shops,\nhookah lounges, restaurants and most of the writing was in Arabic.\nScott walked along side a woman most likely that was covered head to\ntoe in a burqa.\u00a0 There was a little screen for her to look out of as\nshe hustled away from Scott and into the butcher shop.\u00a0 She was there\nto collect a lamb that was just slaughtered according to Muslim\nguidelines hence halal.\nA dozen cab driver looking men, scruffy with open dress shirts were\ndrinking brackish coffee and talking.\u00a0 They immediately stopped\ntalking when Scott walked in.\u00a0 Scott stared at the group of men and\nthen turned around and walked out.\u00a0 When he walked back out, there\nwere two white cops.\u00a0 Scott explained what happened with loud hand\ngestures.\u00a0 One of the cops radioed in for a \u201cfacilitator\u201d.\n\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for a what?\u201d\n\u201cA facilitator\u2026\u00a0 A female who speaks Arabic.\u00a0 When these things come\nup, this is how it is handled.\u00a0 If we go in and drag her out, we wind\nup on the evening fucking news.\u00a0 Racist, xenophobic cops trampling on\nthe constitutional rights of a non-citizen and so on\u2026\u00a0 You have to be\ncareful of how you treat these people.\u00a0 When I went to Iraq to fight\nwith and against them, they would just as soon blow you to pieces with\na bomb strapped to their chest, but we have to handle all these\nsituations delicately\u2026\u00a0 My advice to you\u2026\u00a0 Just file a hit and run\nclaim against your own insurance.\u00a0 These people won\u2019t have insurance,\nlicense or anything.\u00a0 You won\u2019t get dick\u2026\u00a0 Just letting you know how\nthis shit works, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThis is fucking bullshit!\u201d\n\u201cWe agree with you\u2026\u00a0 Here comes the facilitator.\u201d\nThe facilitator was a young thin white woman dressed in a white robe\nlike material.\u00a0 She had the meekness of a librarian and barely spoke a\nwhisper.\u00a0 She jotted down notes, covered her head with a scarf and\nwent in to talk to the woman.\u00a0 After ten minutes, the facilitator came\nout and started speaking with the word \u201cso\u201d.\u00a0 She started every\nsentence with so.\u00a0 The facilitator went to college and majored in\nArabic just to land a job as a go between.\n\u201cSo I spoke to Abu-Nasim-Kareem\u2026\u00a0 So she claims that she was not in\nan accident and does not know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u00a0 So I suggest\nthe police inspect the vehicles.\u201d\nThe handles of the minivan on had a scuff but no paint.\u00a0 Scott\u2019s car\nhad a large indentation but no paint on the driver side and a\ndestroyed passenger side from contact with the wall.\u00a0 The diagnosis\nwas nothing.\n\u201cSo\u2026\u00a0 What do I do?\u201d\n\u201cIf you have insurance and you should.\u00a0 You should report it.\u201d\n\u201cThis is fucked up\u2026\u00a0 I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u00a0 This is wrong\u2026 Fuck!\u201d\nScott went home and poured himself a red wine that he and his wife\nhad purchased while in Sonoma.\u00a0 He plopped down on the couch and\nturned on the television.\u00a0 It was 10 am and he was not going to make\nit to work.\u00a0 Scott had decided he was just going home.\u00a0 \u00a0He was going\nto eat ice cream and watch nothing of substance on television.\u00a0 Scott\nwas going to call his insurance company and take a nap and then pick\nup his children from school and take them for a Slurpee and pretend\nlike the whole day never happened. Scott\u2019s father-in-law, an ice\nfisherman from Minnesota had been watching Fox news non-stop on their\ntelevision while visiting for a month.\u00a0 His father-in-law had caught a\nflight for Minneapolis that morning.\u00a0 Scott was happy to have his\nhouse back.\u00a0 No old man to steal the newspaper in the morning, take a\nmonstrously smell shit before breakfast, breathe loudly like Dark\nVader, click his false teeth and comment out loud about the state of\nthings, hoping to draw Scott into a debate or a conversation.\u00a0 He was\ngone but Trump took his place.\u00a0 On the television, at a rally in\nPennsylvania.\u00a0 Scott never usually listened but he did that morning he\nwas angry.\u00a0 Angry like a lot of other people disgruntled socially and\npolitically that they could not change the things that did not sit\nwell with them.\u00a0 Scott poured a second glass of wine and plopped down\non the couch.\u00a0 Trump took the podium with flag waving hicks in the\nbackground.\u00a0 Scott didn\u2019t change the channel; he listened for the\nfirst time that he could remember.\n\u201cSometimes\u2026\u00a0 You lose\u2026\u00a0 That\u2019s okay.\u00a0 Sometimes a loss is a win\u2026 I\nthought about the loss.\u00a0 The razor thin loss in many states where they\nsaid I had no chance.\u00a0 I could have walked away and gone on with life.\nI have been successful and will continue to be.\u00a0 We have started a\nmovement that will continue to grow.\u00a0 Throwing money at Iran in hopes\nthey do what we want, is not the answer.\u00a0 Ignoring radical Islamic\nterror is not the answer.\u00a0 Accepting under vetted refugees is not the\nanswer.\u00a0 Allowing America to be the dumping ground of the world is not\nthe answer.\u00a0 I could go on with life but I feel my calling is to stop\nour decline before it is too late.\u00a0 This movement will grow and the\nmedia won\u2019t be able to stop this.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to the people and the\npeople are going to me\u2026 hindsight will be corrected in 2020.\nHindsight 2020!\u00a0 Hindsight 2020.\u201d\nScott emptied the bottle and did not move or change the channel.\u00a0 In\nhindsight he questioned what he thought and what he believed.\u00a0 He was\nangry and frustrated with an army of many others.\u00a0 Will it subside?\n\n\nBlog at",

If adopted, Secure Communities would automatically check the immigration status of everyone arrested. Such a program has garnered support from law officials and community leaders and activists around the state, and is currently being implemented in Rhode Island.\n\nThe revelation by the highest ranking public safety official in the state goes to show that the Patrick Administration is clearly not on board with this program. In their lack of communication with public safety officials, it is apparent that they are merely attempting to go along half-heartedly with a potential federal requirement.

        "text":"Wednesday, August 13, 2008\n\nWindow on Eurasia: Was There a Russian Intelligence Failure in Georgia?\n\nPaul Goble\n\nVienna, August 13 \u2013 Russia\u2019s intelligence services failed to detect and warn Moscow\u2019s top leaders about Georgian plans to send forces into South Ossetia, a shortcoming that cannot be covered up by Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to hand out awards to more than 50 FSB, SVR, and GRU officers, according to a Russian analyst who tracks that country\u2019s security community.\nIndeed, Vladimir Yermolin writes in an article posted on the portal today, these awards are the height of hypocrisy because they have being given \u201cfor the timely and precise supply by the intelligence services of various levels of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and consequently of the country\u2019s leadership\u201d (\nThe course of events suggests that no such information was provided, at least in a timely fashion. \u201cThe introduction of Georgian units into the unrecognized republic [of South Ossetia] was, judging by Moscow\u2019s reaction political and military, sudden.\u201d In fact, he notes, Moscow dredged up the term \u201cfrom distant 1941\u201d \u2013 \u201cperfidious attack\u201d \u2013 to describe it.\nGeorgia\u2019s quick moves clearly caught Russian peacekeeping forces there off guard. They were soon trapped, without a chance for \u201ca timely withdrawal or assistance\u201d for almost a day. They had to burn secret documents lest they fall into Georgian hands. And the only person who did flee in a timely manner was republic President Eduard Kokoita.\nClearly, tactical intelligence broke down, Yermolin argues, but so too did strategic intelligence at the level of Russia\u2019s national command center. On August 8th, President Dmitry Medvedev was at a recreation facility in Samara oblast, while Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev were at the Beijing Olympics.\nThey clearly had not been given a head\u2019s up about what the Georgians were about to do, Yermolin suggests, or at least one of them \u2013 perhaps Patrushev \u2013 would have been in Moscow or at a military facility in the North Caucasus Military District.\nThus, Yermolin continues, it turns out that \u201cit is easier to spy in Senegal than in Georgia.\u201d Or \u201cin a word, neither from Tbilisi, nor from the observation posts, nor from the raids of special forces, nor from the air, nor from the cosmos, nor from our remarkable \u2018spies,\u2019 nor from anywhere else came to Moscow the signal about the invasion being planned.\u201d\nIndeed, as far as one can tell, Yermolin suggests, those who were watching television or listening to the radio may have known about Georgian plans at nearly the same instant that Medvedev, Putin the other senior leaders in Moscow did, a serious intelligence failure given Russian involvement in the region.\nThe only place where the security agencies demonstrated their \u201cskills\u201d during the start of this crisis was in seizing \u201cGeorgian spies in Moscow.\u201d With regard to providing the kind of warning intelligence services are supposed to provide, they did \u201cnot a thing if one judges by the results.\u201d\nWhat might have happened in the Russian intelligence services had worked more effectively? Moscow could have raised an alarm diplomatically and reinforced its position on the ground in Ossetia militarily. Tbilisi would certainly have denied that it planned to do anything and complained yet again about what Moscow was doing.\nBut \u2013 and in Yermolin\u2019s view, this is the important thing \u2013 with good intelligence, Moscow would not have yielded the initiative to the Georgians and would thus have been in a position to defend Russia\u2019s interests in the region with much less loss of life and much less loss of its political position.\nThere is of course one possible justification for Putin to hand out these awards to his colleagues in the intelligence business: Some of them may have been involved in \u201cconvincing the Georgian leader and his generals that Moscow would not risk introducing forces on the territory of Georgia.\u201d For such an effort, Yermolin says, it is of course \u201cpossible to give awards.\u201d\n\nNo comments:",

The premise is simple: five non-believers of the official story journey across the east coast of the USA in search of the truth. On the way we meet \u201cexperts\u201d and victims of the attacks, guided by \u201ccomedian\u201d Andrew Maxwell who believes the 9\/11 commission report was the be all and end all of the 9\/11 story.\n\nThe show aired a few hours ago and I felt compelled to write my version of what happened on that 8 day roadtrip, to give you the perspective you were not shown by BBC 3.\n\nFirstly, I must tip my hat to them. They did a wonderful editing job. Anyone who has ever had a conversation with me or knows me personally will be very much aware of my opinions re: 9\/11, and how outspoken I am about them. However, on this show I appear to be pretty much silent the entire way through.\n\nI wasn\u2019t. Continue reading \u2018\u201c9\/11 Conspiracy Roadtrip\u201d \u2013 A Participant\u2019s\u00a0Perspective\u2019\n\nThe Rothschilds and the Civil\u00a0War\n\nExcerpted From \u2018Descent Into Slavery\u2019\nBy Des Griffin\nChapter Five\n\nIt would be extraordinarily naive to even consider the possibility that a family as ambitious, as cunning and as monopolistically minded as the Rothschilds could resist the temptation of becoming heavily involved on the American front.\n\nFollowing their conquest of Europe early in the 1800s, the Rothschilds cast their covetous eyes on the most precious gem of them all \u2014 the United States.\n\nAmerica was unique in modern history. It was only the second nation in history that had ever been formed with the Bible as its law book. Its uniquely magnificent Constitution was specifically designed to limit the power of government and to keep its citizens free and prosperous. Its citizens were basically industrious immigrants who \u2018yearned to breath free\u2019 and who asked nothing more than to be given the opportunity to live and work in such a wonderfully stimulating environment.\n\nThe results \u2014 the \u2018fruit\u2019 \u2014 of such a unique experiment were so indescribably brilliant that America became a legend around the globe. Many millions across the far flung continents of the world viewed America the Beautiful as the promised land.\n\nThe Big Bankers in Europe \u2014 the Rothschilds and their cohorts \u2014 viewed the wonderful results borne by this unique experiment from an entirely different perspective; they looked upon it as a major threat to their future plans.\n\nThe establishment Times of London stated: \u201cIf that mischievous financial policy which had its origin in the North American Republic [i.e. honest Constitutionally authorized no debt money] should become indurated down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off its debts and be without a debt [to the international bankers]. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world. The brains and wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.\u201d\n\nThe Rothschilds and their friends sent in their financial termites to destroy America because it was becoming \u201cprosperous beyond precedent.\u201d\n\nThe first documentable evidence of Rothschild involvement in the financial affairs of the United States came in the late 1820s and early 1830s when the family, through their agent Nicholas Biddie, fought to defeat Andrew Jackson\u2019s move to curtail the international bankers. The Rothschilds lost the first round when in 1832, President Jackson vetoed the move to renew the charter of the \u2018Bank of the United States\u2019 (a central bank controlled by the international bankers). In 1836 the bank went out of business.\n\n\nIn the years following Independence, a close business relationship had developed between the cotton growing aristocracy in the South and the cotton manufacturers in England. The European bankers decided that this business connection was America\u2019s Achilles Heel, the door through which the young American Republic could be successfully attacked and overcome.\n\nThe Illustrated University History, 1878, p. 504, tells us that the southern states swarmed with British agents. These conspired with local politicians to work against the best interests of the United States. Their carefully sown and nurtured propaganda developed into open rebellion and resulted in the secession of South Carolina on December 29, 1860. Within weeks another six states joined the conspiracy against the Union, and broke away to form the Confederate States of America, with Jefferson Davis as President.\n\nThe plotters raided armies, seized forts, arsenals, mints and other Union property. Even members of President Buchanan\u2019s Cabinet conspired to destroy the Union by damaging the public credit and working to bankrupt the nation. Buchanan claimed to deplore secession but took no steps to check it, even when a U.S. ship was fired upon by South Carolina shore batteries.\n\nShortly thereafter Abraham Lincoln became President, being inaugurated on March 4, 1861. Lincoln immediately ordered a blockade on Southern ports, to cut off supplies that were pouring in from Europe. The \u2018official\u2019 date for the start of the Civil War is given as April 12, 1861, when Fort Sumter in South Carolina was bombarded by the Confederates, but it obviously began at a much earlier date.\n\nIn December, 1861, large numbers of European Troops (British, French and Spanish) poured into Mexico in defiance of the Monroe Doctrine. This, together with widespread European aid to the Confederacy strongly indicated that the Crown was preparing to enter the war. The outlook for the North, and the future of the Union, was bleak indeed.\n\n\nIn this hour of extreme crisis, Lincoln appealed to the Crown\u2019s perennial enemy, Russia, for assistance. When the envelope containing Lincoln\u2019s urgent appeal was given to Czar Alexander II, he weighed it unopened in his hand and stated: \u201cBefore we open this paper or know its contents, we grant any request it may contain.\u201d\n\nUnannounced, a Russian fleet under Admiral Liviski, steamed into New York harbor on September 24, 1863, and anchored there, The Russian Pacific fleet, under Admiral Popov, arrived in San Francisco on October 12. Of this Russian act, Gideon Wells said: \u201cThey arrived at the high tide of the Confederacy and the low tide of the North, causing England and France to hesitate long enough to turn the tide for the North\u201d (Empire of \u201cThe City,\u201d p. 90).\n\nHistory reveals that the Rothschilds were heavily involved in financing both sides in the Civil War.\n\nLincoln put a damper on their activities when, in 1862 and 1863, he refused to pay the exorbitant rates of interest demanded by the Rothschilds and issued constitutionally-authorized, interest free United States notes.\n\nFor this and other acts of patriotism Lincoln was shot down in cold-blood by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, just five days after Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.\n\n\n\nDaily Express, Friday July 22,2011\nBy Cyril Dixon, Padraic Flanagan and Mark Reynolds\n\nTWO of Britain\u2019s leading former police officers are wanted for questioning over allegations that they withheld crucial evidence about the car crash which killed Princess Diana.\n\nA French judge wants to ask ex-Yard chief Lord Condon and Sir David Veness why they failed to disclose the existence of a note in which she predicted her assassination.\n\nThey could face international arrest warrants as suspects should they refuse to attend interviews in Paris, sources close to the investigation indicated last night.\n\nMore here\u2026\n\nRelated Story:\n\nUnresolved Issues of the Diana and Dodi Inquest by John Morgan\n\nCover-up of a Royal Murder: Hundreds of Errors in the Paget\u00a0Report\n\nProduct Description\n\nCover-up of a Royal Murder is a thorough investigation of the British inquiry \u2013 the Paget report \u2013 into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed. It uses eye-witness, documentary and other evidence to prove that the conclusions drawn in the Paget report are fundamentally flawed \u2014 yet it is the Paget report that is set to form the basis for the upcoming British inquest. This is the book that proves beyond reasonable doubt that Princess Diana was murdered and that there is a lot more to the Paris crash than the French and British investigations have revealed. \u201cCover-up\u201d provides credibility to the lingering doubts of a large section of the British and international public \u2014 doubts that remain even 10 years after the crash. This book lays down a huge challenge to those who believe the death of Diana Princess of Wales was just a tragic accident. Cover-up of a Royal Murder exposes one of the greatest cover-ups of our time.\n\n\nA brilliant piece of research and writing which will play an important role in uncovering the truth about how Princess Diana came to die. \u2014 Sue Reid, Daily Mail, London\n\nAn intriguing thought provoking read that is hard to put down\u2026.I found Cover-up of a Royal Murder a highly accomplished work. \u2014 Zeus Publications, September 25 2007\n\nChapter after chapter, I was astounded at the volume of evidence pointing to criminal involvement rather then an accident. \u2014 Margaretha de Vries, September 5 2007\n\nI read this book as a complete skeptic\u2026.After reading it I am completely convinced that the death of Diana was not an accident\u2026. \u2014 Sarah Thornton,September 4 2007\n\nNot just another Diana book\u2026.Cover-up of a Royal Murder leaves me in no doubt that the Paget Report is indeed a cover-up of the facts. \u2014 Davina Dyne, September 18 2007\n\nOriginally I did not think that Diana and Dodi were murdered, but after reading the book I have grave doubts that it was just an accident. \u2014 Jos Deter...

        "text":"Tuesday, March 21, 2006\n\nYour priorities are showing\n\nShirley Ringo, Latah County's own representative, has sponsored legislation in the Idaho house to raise Idaho's minimum wage from $5.15\/hour (the federal minimum wage, donchaknow) to $6.15\/hour. When originally introduced, it was jettisoned by House leadership who called it too \"political.\" Idaho Democrats are back at it, and with the threat of boredom, they forced the Idaho legislature into giving the idea an \"up or down vote\" (ahem). So what was it that got this wage hike into trouble earlier in the legislative session? Eye on Boise lays out the scene:\nDemocrats were none too pleased last month when Newcomb was asked about the minimum wage bill at his annual talk to the Idaho Press Club, and he dismissed it as just a political issue. Idaho\u2019s minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, falls far below that of Washington and many other states. \u201cBasically you look at things like that and you look at the sponsors and you can kind of tell it\u2019s for political reasons and not for real reasons,\u201d Newcomb said then.\nSo what passes muster for the Idaho legislature? Apparently, their definition of what is too political does not exclude the blatantly unconstitutional. Loaded thoughts, amongst many, is rightfully alarmed at proposed legislation that would dictate that\n...the Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction to review, by appeal, writ of certiorari, or otherwise, any matter to the extent that relief is sought against an entity of Federal, State, or local government, or against an officer or agent of Federal, State, or local government (whether or not acting in official or personal capacity), concerning that entity's, officer's, or agent's acknowledgment of God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government.\nAnd guess who has spoken out in favor of this legislation? Why, everyone's favorite opponent of gynecological care, Brandi Swindell. A quote:\n\"I think its important that our Constitution protects the freedom of religion, not the freedom from religion.\"\nSo it's important that you can force your religion on others...but not that people are paid more for the hard work they do. Someone's priorities are showing.\n\nNo comments:",

Part 1.\n\nImagine if a foreign power gains control of key people within the security services of your country and then arranges who occupies key positions within the government and then dictates foreign and domestic policy.\n\nGeorge Young was a top officer in Britain\u2019s MI6, military intelligence. Reportedly he is the man who organised the overthrow of Mossadeq in Iran.\n\nAccording to Young, Soviet Russia, in 1946-7, supplied base facilities, arms and explosives to Jewish groups to operate against British targets.\n\n(Source: The Wilson Plot, by David Leigh, 1988. Chapter 1.)\n\nIn 1946 the British security services issued this warning: \"Members of the Stern group are now being organised and are under training. It is expected that they will be sent to the United Kingdom to assassinate important members of his majesty\u2019s government, particularly, Mr Bevin.\"\n\nIn 1946 a number of bombs exploded in London and an attempt was made to drop a bomb on the House of Commons from a hired plane.\n\n\nCommunist Russia, which had many Jews in top positions, was allied to the Jewish groups attacking Britain in Palestine and in the UK.\n\nIn 1946, Britain had a Labour government whose key figures were Prime Minister Clement Attlee and Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin.\n\nAccording to David Leigh, in Chapter 1 of The Wilson Plot, Attlee and Bevin, developed \u2018in concert with the Americans, a secret shadow state... Most of which was invisible to the general public, and, indeed, to many members of the British Labour Party.\u2019\n\nThe secret state set up a propaganda unit called the Information Research Department (IRD). According to David Leigh, BBC programme makers \u2018were required to accept batches of undercover IRD material.\u2019\n\nThe secret state organised special forces to carry out secret operations in Palestine and in the Soviet Empire.\n\nUnfortunately, the UK security services had been infiltrated and their operations had a tendency to fail. British spies tended to get arrested the moment they landed in places like Albania.\n\nWho were the infiltrators? Mention is often made of people like Philby and Blunt, who turned out to be spies for Russia. Secrets that were handed over to Russia could then be handed over to the Israelis.\n\nSome people suspect Victor, Lord Rothschild, a friend of Israel and a friend of Blunt, of giving away some of Britain\u2019s secrets.\n\n\nIn 1947, George Blake, who was Jewish, was recruited by MI6. He went on to betray all MI6 operations in Berlin and Poland.\n\n\nWednesday, September 20, 2006\n\nTrevor Brooks, spooks, John Reid and the TV cameras.\n\nOn 20 September 2006, UK home secretary, John Reid, made a speech to a small gathering in London urging Muslim parents to monitor their children. TV cameras were in attendance.\n\nTrevor Brooks, allegedly a member of a banned Moslem group, had been allowed to attend the meeting. Mr Brooks heckled Mr Reid and this was carefully filmed for the TV news channels.\n\nReportedly Mr Brooks, on previous occasions, has admitted he wishes to die as a suicide bomber. Reportedly he has said that it was every Muslim\u2019s duty to kill the Queen of England.\n\nSome might find it strange that Mr Brooks, wearing a robe and a turban, and calling himself Abu Izadeen, was allowed into the meeting and allowed to carry out his heckling.\n\n\"John Reid, Tony Blair and George Bush's crusade can all go to hell,\" Mr Brooks had shouted.\n\nMr Brooks is alleged to have been a leader of Al-Ghurabaa, which reportedly organised the flag-burning protests outside the Danish embassy in London.\n\nReportedly Al-Ghurabaa is a fan of CIA agent Osama bin Laden and al CIAda.\n\nMr Reid told the audience that fanatics were on the hunt for vulnerable young people to recruit to their cause. It is not thought that Mr Reid was referring to the recruitment of patsies by members of certain security services.\n\n\"There is no nice way of saying this,\" said Reid. \"These fanatics are looking to groom and brainwash children, including your children, for suicide bombings.\"\n\nReid barracked during speech\n\nRadical Muslim Trevor Woods Apparently in Hiding\n\nTuesday, September 19, 2006\n\nThailand, the military and the CIA\n\nIn 1946 Ananda was found shot in his bedroom in the Grand Palace.\n\nThis ensured that teenage Bhumibol became king. And it ensured that pro-American Field Marshal Pibul became the power behind the throne.\n\nBhumibol had once said of his brother's murder, \"It was not an was political.\"\n\nKing Bhumibol has a difficult job, surrounded as he is by certain 'corrupt fascist' generals who allegedly have links to the CIA.\n\nIn 1973, when pro-democracy students were being shot at by the army outside the Chitralada palace, Bhumibol ordered the gates of the palace to be opened, to help save some lives.\n\nIn 1980 one third of the rural population lived in absolute poverty (this could mean one meal a day and no money to buy shoes or typhoid medicine). In 1980, a child working 11 hours a day, in a workshop in Bangkok, would earn \u00a336 per year! Yes, per year! Great for the Americans getting their cheap shoes and clothes made by child labour.\n\nWhen the generals were again getting violent in 1992, and hundreds of people were killed, it was Bhumibol who summoned General Suchinda to the palace and had the meeting televised live. The entire Thai nation could see General Suchinda crawling across the carpet to the feet of the monarch.\n\nIn the Oriental Hotel I got talking to a retired Thai gentleman called Yong. I asked him how things were going in Bangkok.\n\n\"There is a power struggle going on within the army,\" said Yong. \"On one side we have the reformers who want to end the army's links to drugs and karaoke bars. They want to purge the army of mafia colonels. And on the other side we have the conservatives who want to continue to do deals with the Burmese junta and the drugs barons.\"\n\nYong read to me the calypso written by Allen Ginsberg in 1972:\n\nIn nineteen hundred forty nine\nChina was won by Mao Tse-Tung.\nChiang Kai Shek's army ran away.\nThey were waiting there in Thailand yesterday\n\nSupported by the CIA\nPushing junk down Thailand way.\n\nFirst they stole from the Meo Tribes\nUp in the hills they started taking bribes\nThen they sent their soldiers up to Shan\nCollecting opium to send to The Man\nPushing junk in Bangkok yesterday\nSupported by the CIA....\"\n\n\nMonday, September 18, 2006\n\n\nExit Habeas Corpus, Enter Night and Fog\n\nChertoff: \u201cRadical Ideologies\u201d Threaten Internet\n\nJudge Revokes Lay's Conviction\nA federal judge in Houston yesterday wiped away the fraud and conspiracy conviction of Kenneth L.

        "text":"Wednesday, December 2, 2009\n\nDo They Really Think We're That Stupid?\n\nA friend pointed out this story about Gorebal Warning:\n\nRemember those nasty CFCs and how they were destroying the ozone layer, causing untold harm to the environment? Well, it now turns out - if these clowns are to be believed - that because the entire French nation stopped using aerosol deodorants a decade ago, the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic is healing nicely.\n\nRead the whole thing, including the now-boilerplate prediction of melting Antarctic ice:\nScientists warn that as the hole closes up in the next few decades, temperatures on the continent could rise by around 3C on average, with melting ice contributing to a global sea-level rise of up to 1.4m.\nThis is an interesting theory, which neglects a very important fact about Antarctica: With the exception of the areas near the coast (such as the Palmer Peninsula) and the sheets of ice over water (and have therefore already contributed to sea level by virtue of the fact that floating ice displaces exactly the volume of water as the same ice melted would occupy), the temperatures in Antarctica are substantially below freezing. A rise in temperatures from -12\u00b0C to -9\u00b0C would melt nothing. Only in the marginal areas on land where the temperature now goes above -3\u00b0C would any melting happen at all.\n\nAt this point, it should be obvious to the casual observer that the AGW advocates are flinging poop at random and hoping some of it sticks.\n\nThursday, November 26, 2009\n\nA Proclamation\n\nIt was appropriate then, it's appropriate now.\n\nGeneral Thanksgiving\nBy the PRESIDENT of the United States Of America\n\nWHEREAS it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favour; and Whereas both Hou\u017fes of Congress have, by their joint committee, reque\u017fted me \"to recommend to the people of the United States a DAY OF PUBLICK THANSGIVING and PRAYER, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to e\u017ftabli\u017fh a form of government for their safety and happiness:\"\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I do recommend and a\u017f\u017fign THURSDAY, the TWENTY-SIXTH DAY of NOVEMBER next, to be devoted by the people of the\u017fe States to the \u017fervice of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then all unite in rendering unto Him our \u017fincere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to their becoming a nation; for the \u017fignal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpo\u017fitions of His providence in the cour\u017fe and conclu\u017fion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty which we have \u017fince enjoyed;-- for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enable to e\u017ftablish Con\u017ftitutions of government for our vafety and happine\u017fs, and particularly the national one now lately instituted;-- for the civil and religious liberty with which we are ble\u017f\u017fed, and the means we have of acquiring and diffu\u017fing useful knowledge;-- and, in general, for all the great and various favours which He has been plea\u017fed to confer upon us.\n\nAnd also, that we may then unite in mo\u017ft humbly offering our prayers and \u017fupplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and be\u017feech Him to pardon our national and other tran\u017fgre\u017f\u017fions;-- to enable us all, whether in publick or private \u017ftations, to perform our \u017feveral and relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a ble\u017f\u017fing to all the people by con\u017ftantly being a Government of wi\u017fe, ju\u017ft, and con\u017ftitutional laws, di\u017fcreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide all \u017fovereigns and nations (especially \u017fuch as have shewn kindne\u017fs unto us); and to ble\u017fs them with good governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the increa\u017fe of \u017fcience among them and us; and, generally to grant unto all mankind \u017fuch a degree of temporal pro\u017fperity as he alone knows to be be\u017ft.\n\nGIVEN under my hand, at the city of New-York, the third day of October, in the year of our Lord, one thousand \u017feven hundred and eighty-nine.\n\n(signed) G. Washington\n\n[Ed note: Whoever digitized this into characters must have mistaken the \"long s\" form \"\u017f\" (\"\u017f\" above, where it is not italicized), common in English writing back then, for the lower-case \"f\" it so closely resembles. The \u017f form was the norm, with \"short s\" reserved for the ends of words. Some writers would also use the latter form even in the middle of a word for the second letter of a double-s: \"\u017fs\". This has more than a passing resemblance to the \u00df in modern German that is rendered \"ss\" in Switzerland, or where the former ligature is unavailable. As a Language Martinet, I study such things, and have corrected the mistranscription accordingly.

As such, he makes intellectual arguments in favor of open processes that allow anyone to examine how a system works, and point out errors. This was once the way that science worked, but for some reason, the \"researchers\" into Gorebal Warming have fought against releasing their primary data and the source code of the software they used to produce things like the infamous \"hockey stick\" graph.\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock (or only getting your news from the MainScream Media), you're aware that someone either hacked or leaked megabytes of files from the Climate Research Unit. Eric has been perusing them, and found this interesting excerpt (emphasis mine):\n\n; Apply a VERY ARTIFICAL correction for decline!!\n2.6,2.6,2.6]*0.75 ; fudge factor\n\nif n_elements(yrloc) ne n_elements(valadj) then message,\u2019Oooops!\u2019\nEric thinks calling it a mere \"smoking gun\" is a massive understatement: \"it\u2019s a siege cannon with the barrel still hot.\" Well, let me add that they didn't just cook the data; they marinated it for a week, put on a rub, laid it in the smoker for a day and a half, sliced it up, wrapped it in bacon, dipped it in batter, rolled it around in the flour, and deep fried it.\n\nSunday, November 22, 2009\n\n\nI thought I'd to check out the Texas page on\nNotice anything?\n\nThe difference between \"Total\" in the top section and \"Total Funds Awarded\" in the bottom section is five hundred forty-seven thousand seven hundred twenty-six dollars.\n\nYou know what they say, \"A half a million here and a half a million there, and pretty soon you're talking about some REAL money.\"\n\nIf you hover over the \"Total\", you get this helpful message.\n\nI'll re-type it here, for sheer incredulity's sake. \"Sum of funds awarded to primes (less awards to their subs) and sub-recipient awards from primes at that location.\"\nWell, hell. Isn't that obvious?\nIf you hover over \"Total Funds Awarded\", you get this helpful message.\n\n\"The sum of funds awarded by a Federal Agency to a prime recipient at that location.\"\n\nIf I'm a sub-prime I get 500K? Isn't that what got us into this current economic mess in the first place? Where do I sign up?\n\nHappy Fact #1: $10,679,918,184(total funds awarded) divided by 19,572 (jobs created or \"saved\") = $545,673.00 per job. Where do I sign up?\n\nHappy Fact #2: $1,826,235,380(total funds received) divided by 19,572 = $93,308 per job. Where do I sign up?\n\nHappy fact #3: has just been awarded another Eighteen Million Dollars to fix a web site that has already spent 12-14 million dollars.\n\nCan you imagine the web site we could create with 30 million dollars?\n\nIt might even be able to compute basic math! Or maybe, just maybe, be able to screen for congressional districts that don't exist.\n\nFriday, November 20, 2009\n\nAnother Failed Presidency\n\nA friend of mine sent this to me today in an email. You can, and should read the whole thing at American Thinker\n\nBarack Obama is on track to have the most spectacularly failed presidency since Woodrow Wilson.\nIn the meantime, while we've been struggling to take a measurement of this man, he's dissed just about every one of us--financiers, energy producers, banks, insurance executives, police officers, doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, post office workers, and anybody else who has a non-green job. Expect Obama to lament at his last press conference in 2012: \"For those of you I offended, I apologize. For those of you who were not offended, you just didn't give me enough time; if only I'd had a second term, I could have offended you too.\"\n\nMercifully, the Founders at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 devised a useful remedy for such a desperate state--staggered terms for both houses of the legislature and the executive. An equally abominable Congress can get voted out next year. With a new Congress, there's always hope of legislative gridlock until we vote for president again two short years after that.\n\nYes, small presidents do fail, Barack Obama among them. The coyotes howl but the wagon train keeps rolling along.\n[Ed. note]: Trimmed down to excerpts and linked back to original. The curren... (truncated)",
