        "text":"Why Visit Bournemouth\n\nLast updated on March 2nd, 2020 at 07:02 pm\n\nWhy visit Bournemouth Beach\n\nBournemouth is located on the South Coast of England, surrounded by the beauty of the New Forest, the crashing waves of the English Channel and the award-winning seven miles of golden sandy beaches.\u00a0 There are many reasons to visit Bournemouth for your summer holiday.\n\nThings to do in Bournemouth\n\nBournemouth has an abundance of wonderful locations, events and experiences for visitors and residents alike to enjoy in and around this cosmopolitan town nestled beside the sea.\n\nJourney back to the beginning of time on the Jurassic coast\n\nThe Dorset Coastline, known as the Jurassic Coast, is the only natural location in England that has been given World Heritage Site status, and for good reason. The 95 miles of Jurassic rock upon which this coastal portion of Dorset sits holds secrets dating back as far as 185 million years ago. Other World Heritage sites include the Grand Canyon, the Great Barrier Reef, the Pyramids and the Taj Mahal \u2013 so this is quite some honour!\n\n\nHengistbury Head\n\nOther historical sites of interest when visiting Bournemouth include Hengistbury Head, a local nature reserve which has been designated a protected special area of conservation due to the large variety of wildlife that reside there throughout the year, as well as for the history surrounding the site \u2013 ancient settlers dating back as far as 12,500 years ago once lived on this spot though at that time the land extended further into the sea and thus the settlement was located further inland. However, erosion has played its hand and now Hengistbury sits on the very edge of the English Channel.\n\nHengistbury Head\n\nReserve at least 2 hours to enjoy Hengistbury Head\n\nThe reserve is a beautiful location to visit if you have a spare couple of hours whilst in Bournemouth. Take a walk to the top of Hengisbury Head to enjoy stunning views of Christchurch, Mudeford and the Isle of Wight, and on your way back down the hill stop off at The Hiker Caf\u00e9 to enjoy a delicious leisurely lunch or tasty Cappuccino.\n\nThe historic town of Christchurch\n\nSwan on the river in ChristchurchAnd finally, a visit to the historic town of Christchurch where one can wander around the wonderful Norman ruins of Christchurch Castle, or visit Place Mill, the Anglo-Saxon Watermill on the quayside.\n\nFrom the quay one can take a short ferry ride over to Mudeford and Hengistbury Head, and also to neighbouring Wick, \u2013 this service being historical itself since it first began transporting villagers around 1880.\n\nIn the summer months pack up a picnic to take with you whilst you sit and soak up the rays and enjoy the comings and goings of the Christchurch swans and other wildlife, as well as local sailors and fisherman enjoying Christchurch Harbour.\n\nReturn to Bournemouth Beach\n\nAfter all this gallivanting around Dorset, a little rest and relaxation are in order, so pack up your beach bag and head for the soft sand and glistening waters of the English Channel. Many of the beaches in Bournemouth hold Blue Flag status for meeting high standards of cleanliness in water quality and environmental management.\n\nEnjoy the warmth of the sun and take a stroll from Bournemouth Beach Pier to Boscombe Pier grabbing an ice cream along the way as you pass the vibrantly coloured beach huts that adorn the boardwalk.\n\nBournemouth beach huts\n\nEating out in Bournemouth\n\nAnd finally, to round off the day following a delicious dinner at one of the many fine restaurants Bournemouth has to offer, there is practically a restaurant with cuisine to suit most tastes, including Indian, Middle Eastern (Charminster), Chinese, Japanese (sushi), Italian, French and modern European fusion.\n\nHow about taking in a show at the BIC (Bournemouth International Centre).\n\nWhere to stay in Bournemouth\n\nYou\u2019ll be spoilt for choice with the many excellent Bournemouth Hotels that stretch from the quiet and less populated beaches of Southbourne and historical Hengistbury Head to the more commercial sea view accommodations scattered along the Eastcliff.\n\nTraditional seaside guesthouses\n\nHead on westwards a short distance and you\u2019ll find yourself in popular Westcliff where you\u2019ll discover a selection of traditional Bournemouth guesthouses. This area is popular due to its close proximity to sandy Bournemouth Beach as well as the busy Bournemouth Shopping Centre, and pretty Bournemouth Gardens.\n\nIs Bournemouth the happiest town to live in the UK?\n\nWell, according to the BBC, a poll of 6,000 people in 2007 say that it is the happiest place. Whether that still holds true is another matter, but one thing for sure Bournemouth is a serious UK destination for a weekend visit or a summer holiday.\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here",

        "text":"\nHow can we help?\n\n\n    Columbus Workers\u2019 Compensation Lawyer\n\n    Many workplaces require their employees to perform dangerous activities. But even in fairly mundane workplaces, there is a potential for people to get injured on the job. Whether an injury happens on a factory floor, in an office building, or on the road, if a person is injured while performing their work duties, they have the right to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\n\n    Oftentimes, an insurance company may deny payment, or issue payment that is insufficient for the injuries suffered. In these situations, a worker has the right to appeal the decision to the State Board of Workers\u2019 Compensation with the help of a skilled personal injury attorney. Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyers represent individuals in these hearings to argue for the fair benefits that they deserve for their injuries.\n\n    Defining the Employee Insurance Program\n\n    Workers\u2019 compensation is an insurance program that all employers with more than three employees are required to procure. This program protects both employees, by providing payments in the event of injury, and employers, since people hurt on the job cannot sue their employers for damages.\n\n    The program pays any worker who was hurt on the job for almost any reason. The only exceptions include if the worker was fighting, was drunk, or on drugs at the time of the incident. Short of these situations, all injuries are eligible for the program.\n\n    Workers\u2019 Compensation Process\n\n    The first thing a\u00a0Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyer is seeking is emergency treatment. Safety is the most important thing. After this, the injured worker has 30 days to report the injury to their supervisor. This will allow the employer to investigate the claim and to refer the worker to a list of approved doctors for treatment. All employers are required to list no fewer than six doctors that can be visited for treatment.\n\n    This doctor will be responsible to both return the worker to health and provide an opinion as to that employee\u2019s ability to return to work. Taking this opinion, the insurance provider will issue payments. If the worker accepts the insurance company\u2019s findings, the case is over and payments will be issued. It is when the payments are insufficient, or denied entirely, that the process becomes more complicated.\n\n    What are the Potential Benefits?\n\n    The types of benefits that may be issued change with the severity of the injury. All medical costs associated with treating the injury will be paid by the insurance company as long as the worker visits the approved doctors. In order for any cash benefits to be paid, a person must miss more than seven days of work.\n\n    This payment will only be issued if a person misses more than 21 consecutive days of work. This is paid at a rate of two-thirds of the average weekly wage. These are known as Temporary Total Disability benefits. Other potential benefits include temporary partial disability, permanent partial disability, and death benefits. Temporary partial disability is issued when a person returns to work but at a limited capacity. Benefits are paid at two-thirds of the difference between prior wages and current wages.\n\n    Permanent partial disability is a lump sum benefits paid because of a permanent reduction in workability. Death benefits are for cases where the worker dies as a result of the accident, all payments are issued to their surviving family. This is paid at two-thirds the average weekly wage. Additionally, funeral expenses are also compensated.\n\n    Compensation Denial Cases\n\n    Most workers\u2019 compensation claims are accepted by all people involved and payments are issued. However, an employee always has the right to appeal the insurance company\u2019s findings with the help of a Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyer. The State of Georgia maintains the State Board of Workers\u2019 Compensation that hears all appeals of benefits.\n\n    In order to initiate this appeal, a worker must file the necessary paperwork within one year of the accident. At these hearings, the Board will hear the case from both the employee\u2019s and insurance company\u2019s perspective. In addition, all workers have the right to be represented by an attorney at these hearings, but in no situation, will one be provided for them.\n\n    Assistance From Columbus Workers\u2019 Compensation Attorneys\n\n    Columbus workers\u2019 compensation lawyers represent workers in these hearings to argue their cases and fight for the full compensation warranted by their injuries. If you have been injured on the job and denied workers\u2019 compensation benefits or the benefits offered are too low for the severity of the injury, contact today for help.",

After handpicking and tenderizing each cut, chefs prepare entrees such as Kansas City strip steaks ($45.95) and large filet steaks ($46.95). Chefs also offer seafood entrees and appetizers such as sauteed mussels ($13.95) and escargot ($12.95). See the full menu.\n\n    Myron's Prime Steakhouse\n\n    Understated confidence comes through in everything from the clean lines of the modern, but not stark, interior to the relaxed, yet professional service, to the cuisine itself, according to MySA food critic Edmund Tijerina, who especially enjoyed the bone-in ribeye and chocolate cake at San Antonio's Myron's Prime Steakhouse. The restaurant represents the culmination of more than three decades of study in the art and science of steak. After gleaning everything he could from successful steakhouses, owner Bill Been decided to open his own. In 2003, he and his wife founded Myron's Prime Steakhouse in a historic New Braunfels theater. Eight years later, they launched a second location in San Antonio, which earned the distinction as \"Best Steakhouse in San Antonio\" from the Destination Guide. Both supply the same USDA prime steaks, which originate from corn-fed, Midwestern cows who cheer for the Wisconsin Badgers. Chefs handpick short loins and tenderize them with a wet-aging process, and dry-age other steaks to enhance their meaty flavors. Side dishes such as stuffed tomatoes with chives in gorgonzola cheese complement the steaks they accompany.\n\nFine Print Limit 1 per person. Limit 1 per table. Valid only for option purchased.

The best thing about scrap gold is that gold retains its value, regardless of whether it is broken or not, due to its malleability and its ability to be melted down and refined into new products. Scrap gold is usually gold that is broken, out of fashion or is sitting at the bottom of a jewellery box somewhere simply collecting dust. Why not sell that unwanted scrap gold and earn some extra money?
