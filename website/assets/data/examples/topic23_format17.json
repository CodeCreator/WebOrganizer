I was just wondering what special parades or fireworks are held for the fourth of July. Or should we stay away on that day due to the overwhelming crowds.\n\n    Hi Ana!\u00a0My\u00a0family celebrated\u00a0Independence Day\u00a0in\u00a0Magic Kingdom a couple of years ago. Traditionally, a\u00a04th of July\u00a0enhanced fireworks display takes place in Magic Kingdom. \"Disney's\u00a0Celebrate America: A Fourth of July Concert in the Sky\"\u00a0is a 360 degrees fireworks extravaganza presentation featuring patriotic music themed to spectacular pyrotechnics that ring throughout the park. The special Independence Day fireworks\u00a0display is generally shown\u00a0both July 3rd and July\u00a04th in Magic Kingdom.\u00a0I\u00a0recommend planning on getting there as\u00a0early as possible and\u00a0spending the remainder of the day at the park.\u00a0Magic Kingdom\u00a0reaches capacity early in the day during\u00a0special holiday events.\u00a0If your\u00a0leave the park, or arrive too late in the day, there is a chance you will not be able to get in to\u00a0watch the show. In Epcot\u00a0you may experience the \"Voices of Liberty 4th of July Concert\" in the\u00a0America Gardens Theatre stage featuring the\u00a0Spirit of America Fife & Drum Corps and several Disney characters.\u00a0IllumiNations Reflections of Earth will feature a patriotic finale.\u00a0In addition there is usually\u00a0a\u00a0fireworks display\u00a0with a Rock\u00a0N'\u00a0Roll soundtrack at\u00a0Disney's Hollywood Studios.

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nI've been asked by friends to take a group photo with a canal in Amsterdam as background. While I realize that there's no 'best' location (these things are often very subjective) I was wondering if there are people on this site who have some tips with regards to location based on more objective metrics like lack of traffic\/tourists at certain locations and space available to create enough distance between me and the group.\n\nGiven that I'd like to make the most of the available light, I'm looking to take the photo's between 15:00-16:00 (might be useful when thinking of traffic\/tourism)\n\nshare|improve this question\nI have voted to close this question as too localized. If it were recast in a more general form, such as asking about criteria for selecting locations for group photos, I suspect it would have much more value to most readers. \u2013\u00a0 whuber Dec 5 '12 at 17:42\nHonestly, I found the whole place to be pretty photogenic, virtually any canal bridge will make for a good group photo. \u2013\u00a0 whatsisname Dec 5 '12 at 18:06\nI don't think it's too localized. See this meta discussion. Amsterdam is a major tourist destination with over 5 million visitors annually, many of whom want to take group photos by the famous canals. By contrast, how many people are wanting to repair a 1929 Voigtlander Bessa? \u2014 a question I think no one has a quibble with. \u2013\u00a0 mattdm Dec 5 '12 at 18:32\nthe Voigtlander Bessa question was great, in any case :-) I agree with @mattdm, for me the criterion for too-localized is \"is this question searchable by someone with reasonable keywords?\" and I can see someone looking for scenic places in Amsterdam. \u2013\u00a0 Francesco Dec 5 '12 at 19:30\nI'm from the Netherlands, although not from Amsterdam. Personally, I think the Herengracht is a beautiful canal. It has many bridges that cross it, so many potential places to take the shot. It's also quite a busy canal though, but you'll have to work around that some way, as Amsterdam generally is small and crowded. As for your suggested shooting time, take note that in the winter the days are very short and your available light will already be limited by 16:00. \u2013\u00a0 Ferdy Dec 11 '12 at 18:26\n\n2 Answers 2\n\nOn of the most beautiful channels is the \"Prinsengracht\". There are trees around that give a nice frame, too.\n\nThere are some spots where the bridge over the channel is wider and you can get some distance between you and the group. For example here. This location should have the right direction for afternoon light.\n\nOn every spot in Amsterdam however there is a risk that some cafe or other shop might setup their chairs on free spaces. To go blindly to a place is not really recommended, specially in summer.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nThe three main canals that form a horseshoe around the central railway station - the Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht - are all ideal. The architecture is very typical Amsterdam round there (tall, narrow houses with typically Dutch facades) and as a plus the little hump-backed bridges that cross the canals provide you with excellent locations to stage a shoot.\n\nHere's a wonderful example from Flickr, taken on the Herengracht (the geo-tag will show you the exact location.) Just imagine your group on that bridge.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Does anyone have any experience or suggestions for me? I'm looking to ship water bottles and some snacks.\n  \u2022 - Asked by Elizabeth from New York on 3\/10\/2009\n  \u2022 Hi Elizabeth!\n\n    Shipping items from home to your resort is a great way to save on those baggage fees at the airport!\n\n    I would recommend shipping your package in enough time so that it arrives a day or two before you are scheduled to check in. I also suggest shipping via UPS or Fedex over regular mail as in my experience the USPS tracking and on-time delivery can be spotty.\n\n    You will need to put some information on the shipping label so that the resort holds the package for you. Here is an example:\n\n    Amber V.\u00a0\n    c\/o Beach Club Villas\n    Hold for guest arrival on: 4\/10\/09\n    1800 Epcot Resorts Boulevard\n    Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830\n\n    You can also include your reservation confirmation number on the label if you wish.\n\n    If you are planning to mostly ship snacks and bottled water, you may be interested in a grocery delivery service like . They will deliver your grocery order to your resort. There is a minimum order of $40 and a delivery fee of $12. Shipping heavy items like bottled water could cost quite a bit - it may be more economical for you to consider a service like Garden Grocer.

It is just better and safer, as things change constantly.\n\nRobert Middleton (pioneer for the Pamirs) writes on his website that it is possible to get the visa at Dushanbe airport ONLY if you have a letter of invitation from the Tajik Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA):\n\nAnd then you'd have to get the GBAO permit as well, which is, as far as I know, not possible to get at the airport.\n\nAs of Mid 2007, the Tajik embassy in Berlin was issuing the GBAO for free, once you get a visa there:\n\nThe Tajik embassy in Vienna is said to be also reliable for visas, but they charge 20 Euros:\n\nOnce you are in Tajikistan, you should also get the OVIR, which is something like the regsitration of foreigners at the local police. This is for each of the provinces\/states of Tajikistan = one OVIR per state. You should get it 72 hours after arrival in the resp. state.\nIf you don't have a proper OVIR, be aware that the military or police (whoever controls at checkpoints or in villages) will throw you out of the country immediately. OVIR is approx. 20 USD.\n\nhope this helps\nall best :-)\n\nGo to NEW Tajikistan questions, or browse older Tajikistan travel answers\n\n\u00a9 2017 \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 View: Full | Mobile\n\nFollow us: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nTravel Questions \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 Destinations \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 Plan a Road Trip \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 Where to Stay \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 Login\n\nAbout Us \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 FAQ \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 Feedback \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 Privacy Policy \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 Terms of Service",

It's not a shiny, cosmopolitan place though! Its much more earthy, where we often felt dwarfed by the gigantic foliage.\n\nI would suggest including places like and Dambulla if you want to explore historical sites. These are both considerably north-east (I think!) of Colombo, so the drive is long, but beautiful. You could visit the elephant orphanage on the way there, even if just to see the elephants bathing in the river - a treat!\n\nColombo itself is not my favourite city in SriLanka. It's fine for a day or two. There are some sights, and spare but lovely shopping options - check out Barefoot Gallery Colombo, Paradise Road cafe, ODEL.\n\nThere are numerous beaches in Sri Lanka, the closer ones to Colombo - Bentota BeachBeruwala Beach, Wadduwa\u00a0are decent, though the sea is perpetually rough. Not great for swimming. However, the hotel options make up for that. There are lovely resorts, which give you a complete experience of being by the water, without having to actually swim in it. Their pools often face the sea, so you have the illusion of being part of the beach:)\n\nIf you are looking to unwind, the seaside is a great place to be. The northern, cooler areas such as\u00a0Nuwara Eliya, Central HighlandsAmbewela\u00a0and areas surrounding Kandy (Kandy itself is not as great) are also worth visiting for the idyllic hilly landscape.\u00a0\n\nDown south you can visit Galle, which is also a coastal city, with well-preserved buildings from the Dutch era.\n\nPlease do look at buildings by the renowned architect, Geoffery Bawa! His country estate at Lunuganga is a treat!\n\nTravel through Sri Lanka is slow, where roads are narrow, and often single carriageway. So you need patience! But I feel that it is well-rewarded if you really want to soak up the place.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\nMentioned in this answer:\n\n  1. Dambulla (attraction)\n  2. Colombo (city)\n  3.

It is also known as Lion Rock because of the huge lion that used to stand at the entrance to the fortress. Within its triple-moated defence the huge rock rises almost\u00a0 to a sheer height of 500ft. On its summit are the foundations of what was once a great and sumptuous palace and gardens complete with swimming pool. On one of the stairways the only known ancient work of Sinhala secular painting survived in the form of Frescoes of life sized damsels in all the freshness and delicacy of their original colour\n\n02 -\u00a0Kandy - the hill capital, venue of the annual Perahera. The last stronghold of the Sinhala Kings was finally ceded to the British in 1815. Kandy is an example of the Buddhism's influence in Sri Lanka today. Temple's shrines and monasteries keeping alive Buddhist traditions are everywhere. \u00a0\n\nEvening visit The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relics Sri Dalada Maligava\u00a0and Cultural dance performance\n\n03 -\u00a0Nuwara Eliya - The \u2018Little England\u2019 of Sri Lanka, is set against beautiful backdrops of Mountains, Valleys, Waterfalls and Tea Plantations.\u00a0 It is supposed to be one of the coldest places on the island, but is really just like an England spring day although the temperature does drop at night.\n\nAll around Nuwara Eliya you will see evidence of the British influence.\u00a0 Houses are like country cottages or Queen Ann style mansions.\n\n04 -\u00a0Colombo - a drive through the city taking you to the busy commercial areas as well as the tree-lined residential, Cinnamon Gardens. Visit Fort, the former British administrative center and military garrison, Sea Street - the Goldsmith\u2019s quarters in the heart of Pettah, the Bazaar area, where is also a Hindu Temple with elaborate stone carvings, and the Dutch Church of Wolvendaal Church dating back to 1749. Also visit the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH), see the replica of Avukana Buddha and Independence Square. (can do shopping )\n\nHope above details clear for you.\n\nBest regards\n\n\nMentioned in this answer:\n\n  1. Sigiriya (attraction)\n  2. Kandy (city)\n  3. Sri Dalada Maligava (restaurant)\n  4.

We have picked not to visit there as I don't care for the sound of the way the elephants are dealt with, we are wanting to see elephants in the wild rather in Udawalawe National Park.\n\nAdam's Peak\u00a0looks astounding to move during the evening, we are picking not to do this and I think moving around evening time will be a lot for us.\n\nFrom what we've perused, whale viewing is great in January.\n\nAre you mindful that the airplane terminal is quite far out of Colombo, its a decent hour evidently in a taxi from the air terminal to the train station.\n\nMentioned in this answer:\n\n  1.

You can easily spend a lot of time on the road between cities - which is of course an experience it self but also time consuming.\n\nWe went after a couple of days in Colombo to Kandalama Hotel Chanara (amazing hotel) and then to the amazing Sigiria lion rock and on the way to Kandy passing through tempels in Dambulla. After a couple of days in Kandy we went all the way down south to Mirissa Beach (They said it would take around 5-6 hours but took us all day(!) with train via Colombo). After some great days in Mirissa we went to the beautiful and quiet Tangalle and from there, on a daytrip to Yala National Park. Unfortunately we spend our last days in Unawatuna Beach (Tourist trap).\n\nAll in all a very nice trip but a lot of traveling around - so again it depends on what you want to do.\n\nIt is relatively cheap to hire a private taxi\/minibus to take you around. Trains are really cheap and very bumpy - but a very nice experience due to the amazing nature\/landscape.\n\nMentioned in this answer:\n\n  1. Colombo (city)\n  2.

It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nA group of friends would like to go camping in Northern Pakistan on their own. The only problem is to know some locals who can help us with food and a place to find where we can put up our camps. How can we do that (we don't want to pay thousands of Rupees to tourist companies)!\n\nshare|improve this question\n\nmigrated from travel.stackexchange.com Nov 14 '12 at 5:35\n\nThis question came from our site for road warriors and seasoned travelers.\n\nI propose to move this question to Outdoors.SE. \u2013\u00a0 gerrit Nov 13 '12 at 22:26\n\n1 Answer 1\n\nIn the spring of 2004 I went trekking in the Dolpa district of northern Nepal. We did a lot of camping, and also stayed in people's houses. We didn't always have to pay to put up our tents, and when we did it was usually for a very reasonable amount.\n\nWe were traveling with a Nepali guide\/translator, who was an invaluable help to us in arranging the purchase of food and lodging. I don't remember if we found him through a Nepali tourist company or not, but we employed him independently- it was not a \"package\" trip. Altogether, we were six tourists, employing three Nepalis, over the course of about a month. Although we paid a lot less than we would have if it was a \"package\" trip, it still ended up running into the thousands of rupees- but a month is a long time. I don't regret this, and would highly recommend traveling with someone who speaks Nepali.\n\nAlong the way we met a French couple who were traveling alone. They didn't encounter any particular problems, as far as I know, so it isn't impossible to travel without a guide\/translator.\n\nAll this, of course, is true for Nepal, not Pakistan. And it's true for a relatively less-traveled part of Nepal, not the popular routes of Everest, Anapurna and Gosaikund. It could be that the owners of the guest houses there don't allow camping in the vicinity of their guest houses.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

The weather is perfect. Not too hot like it is during the summer and not cloudy like it is sometimes in January. However you must know that Cancun enjoys of a year round summer and sunny days. There is no winter in this part of the world because it is so close to the ecuator. So to be honest, any time you go to Cancun is a good time and you will enjoy a lot.\nIf you are looking for good prices and not too many people the best time it's november or late january, avoid christmas break, springbreak (late march, early april), and summertime. The weather its great all year round but spring and summer are more rainy.\nNovember is good, because it is the end of hurricane season and prices are not as steep as in December.\nwell mostly 8-9 months a year is ok,the winter months is when is more busy here and easter weeks.just avoid part of august all way to october,since its hurricane season,but thats a gamble if hurricanes come or not,maybe just occasional rains\nI highly recommend that you go in the summer, after that or before, it is very probable that you get lots of rain and in august to november, hurricanes.\nLook February for me is one of the best months of the year, it\u2019s sunny during the day and fresh at night, there are not that many tourists in the place and you would enjoy a lot your trip.\nAlso may it\u2019s a really good option, its consider low low season and the weather it\u2019s really nice, also its when the sand its coming back to the beach (during the winter we lose some sand due to the north fronts)\nI got married in that month and it was a beautiful day.\n\nMore Information\n\nGet travel answers from locals in Cancun\n\nFind places to visit in Cancun",

        "text":"Mom And Kids Animal Kingdom\n  \u2022 On Apr 29, 2011\n    Shefflan from MN Asked\n\n    Hi! We are so excited to be visiting Disney World for the first time in Sept. We're going to be there for 5 days and I was wondering how much time I should plan to spend in each park. I want to be able to use time as effectively as I can. Thanks\n\n    Hi Shefflan:\n\n    Congratulations on your first trip to Disney World. With five days at Disney World, my basic default for time to spend at each park would be two days at the Magic Kingdom, one full day at Epcot, a day at Hollywood Studios and another day at Animal Kingdom. However, without knowing more about your party, such as ages and interests, its difficult to give a more precise time breakdown. For example, if your party may want to spend time at one of Disney Worlds Water Parks, you could swap out for a day a Magic Kingdom. Also, you may have party members who may want to need to take breaks back at the Resort mid-day and then return to the Parks in the late afternoon. But to give you a rough estimate, you can likely spend more time exploring Magic Kingdom and Epcot than Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom.\n\n    I would pace yourself. There is no way to \"see it all\" at Walt Disney World in 5 days. Here are some of my family's must-dos: among many other things: at the Magic Kingdom, we always ride the Jungle Cruise, Peter Pan's Flight, Mickey's PhilharMagic, and it's a small world. At Epcot, we take in Spaceship Earth, Living with the Land, and tour the countries of World Showcase. Our must-dos at Hollywood Studios include Toy Story Mania and Muppet Vision 3-D. At Animal Kingdom, our family always rides the Kilimanjaro Safari and visits The Boneyard and Conservation Station. As you enter the parks, pick up a Times Guide for parades and show schedules throughout the day.\n\n    Enjoy your vacation.\nthumbnail image for Jonas\n\nMeet the Panelist: Jonas, New York\n\nI am a family man and huge Disney fan raising two awesome and rambunctious boys.\u00a0 As Disney Vacation Club members, we travel to Walt Disney World often.

Planning your first trip to Walt Disney World is super magical isn't it? It looks like you are doing a wonderful job of planning since you know about booking the resort without the tickets to be able to make changes in an easier manner. You can always add the tickets at a later date if you chose or purchase them from an outside source. The only thing you could miss out on is if they offer the Disney Dining Plan for free. The good thing is that if they do, you have a way to make your reservation changes much easier than those that went ahead and got a package.

        "text":"New Hampshire over Christmas\nOctober 12, 2009 9:44 AM \u00a0 Subscribe\n\nGoing to New Hampshire over Christmas. Ideas for places to stay and a FWD car rental question.\n\nMy wife and I are flying into Boston for 4 days\/4 nights over Christmas. Ideally we'd stay no more than 4 hours drive from Boston for at least three nights, and be within reach of a ski field. We are currently thinking of staying near Woodstock, NH or near Mt Washington. My wife really wants to do the whole white Christmas, so suggestions on great little inns and locations to stay would be appreciated (the cuter, the better!)\n\nAlso, I've seen this previous thread about winter rental cars in Boston, which seems to suggest a FWD drive car + safe driving practices would generally be okay, but really wanted to confirm if the same holds true if we venture out north from Boston city and suburbs into New Hampshire. We'd like to be able to get to the local ski resorts (without too much hassle), and I doubt we'd be straying too far off the interstates at that time of the year. Is a FWD drive rental generally going to be okay in this situation?\nposted by inflatablekiwi to Travel & Transportation around New Hampshire (4 answers total)\neither a front-wheel or a 4-wheel \/ all-wheel drive car will be fine. 4WD \/ AWD is slightly better if you're going to more rustic ski mountains that have less-improved roads. If you're going to the major ski resorts, this is really pretty much irrelevant, unless you are driving though a blizzard- the roads handle so many folks that they are pretty well maintained.\n\nAs mentioned a million times in the other thread, it's less what you drive and more how you drive that will be important. In some ways, driving on icy roads is like steering a boat- you end up endlessly correcting your heading, and you're aware of the outside forces (wind, tide, gravity) that are changing where you're actually going to go. You'll be fine as long as you take it easy and leave enough room to stop if something odd happens.\n\nFWIW, remember that Maine is right near New Hampshire; Sunday River is a pretty quick shot from the mount washington area, and is supposed to be a pretty fun mountain.\nposted by jenkinsEar at 10:24 AM on October 12, 2009\n\nNo specifics for you, but North Conway\/Jackson are about three hours out of Boston, depending on how you go, and are located very very near Mt. Washington and a billion ski areas (Cranmore, Attitash, Wildcat, Bretton Woods, Black Mountain, even Sunday River). The whole area seems perfectly designed for the kind of thing you're looking for (lots of solid restaurants, B&Bs and so on).\nposted by charmedimsure at 11:15 AM on October 12, 2009\n\nRegarding driving, yes what you heard is right. Ski resorts are often frequented by people who are not from places with snow, especially around holiday time. I have never seen as clean and safe a road in the wintertime as the roads around Killington over Thanksgiving.\n\nSo, the roads near ski resorts and the highways will be fine if it's not actively snowing. If it is actively snowing, be smart. Check the forecast to see what you are in for and if the roads look like they're going to be really bad STAY HOME. Basically the best car in the world isn't going to be great on a road with a bunch of snow and ice and other crazy drivers, so the best thing you can do for this trip is build in lots of wiggle room time so you're not like \"well the roads are bad but we HAVE to get to XYZ in two hours!\"\n\nThis place spends a lot of tourist bucks to get you to go stay there, but I have local friends who have stayed there and say it's actually quite nice.\nposted by jessamyn at 11:23 AM on October 12, 2009\n\nIf you are concerned about driving in risky weather, Consider looking into a shuttle bus service. Lots of mountains have them. While it is sometimes tough to be stuck on someone else's schedule, you will less likely be stuck on the side of the road.\nposted by Nanukthedog at 11:47 AM on October 12, 2009\n\n\u00ab Older Theories\/discussions about corporate inertia \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 We'll kiss, but only if you work for it.
