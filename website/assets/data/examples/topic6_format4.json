I\u2019m going to the Oscars!\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s my first Oscars. And it\u2019s my first being an Oscar boyfriend. After that night I have a deal almost signed in blood that says I must go into the studio and finish this record. So after Oscar Sunday, Monday morning I\u2019m invisible!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see how invisible he\u2019ll really be!\n\nJust Jared on Facebook\nPhotos: WENN\nPosted to: Jennifer Aniston, John Mayer\n\nJJ Links Around The Web\n\n  \u2022 Dr. Phil hit a skateboarder with his car - TMZ\n  \u2022 Elizabeth Gillies is totally down for a Victorious reunion - Just Jared Jr\n  \u2022 Is Lala Kent returning to Vanderpump Rules? - TooFab\n  \u2022 A Magnum P.I. reboot is in the works at CBS - The Hollywood Reporter\n  \u2022 Camila Mendes opens up about past eating disorder struggles - Just Jared Jr\n  \u2022 jade\n\n    Hi Jill\n    I just wanted to say Hi to you.Of course I don\u2019t agree with you at all.\n    The way things are going with Jen and John, I won\u2019t have to say I was\n    wrong, remember,cyber friend?\n\n  \u2022 ellie\n\n    Mark @ 02\/18\/2009 at 9:41 pm Sorry ellie but Jen is truly showing how desperate she has become and I\u2019m not glad about that. She is selling herself very cheap. Mayer use phony charm nothing genuine. That will come back to bite Jen in the end. Jen has so much more class then all of his junk or did she. I for one am starting to wonder.\n    That picture in that green thing says a lot but you chose to ignore it. Mayer is the one with serious problems. I thought that when that incident first happen and he wasn\u2019t even with Jen.\n    Mayer is a narcissistic ba$tard no love for that jerk at all.\n    You Mark we don\u2019t pick who we love it just happens. Like no one means to cheat on a spouse husband or wife , it just happens Mark. I could care less if Jens with John or not it her choice is anyone choosing who you should be with?

Mayer is fake. One day Jen will wake up and understand she don\u2019t have to settle for a jerk loser. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll have respect for her again. Any other man in Hollywood is better than this douche bag.\n\n  \u2022 Kay\n\n    Brangelina loons make me laugh. You say it\u2019s bad because there\u2019s an age difference between jen and John but there is an 11 year old difference for Brad and Angie! Hypocrites! Brangelina aren\u2019t the only ones aloud to go to the Oscars! They\u2019re not goddest and it make me LMFAO if you guys think Brad can win an Oscar too. he can\u2019t act for sh*t!\n\n  \u2022 ellie\n\n    jade @ 02\/18\/2009 at 9:57 pm Hi ellie,dear,\n    You have given some very good comments,especially #115 and #128.\n    I always watch the Academy Awards every year.

He won an award, John didnt. Plus Anglina isn\u2019t loved by Kid\u2019s either. She wasn\u2019t nominated for a kid\u2019s Choice Award for Kung Fu Panda. jen got nominated for one. At least kids like Jen!\n\n  \u2022 Jill\n\n    jade @ 02\/18\/2009 at 10:02 pm\n\n    Jade, you\u2019re a sweetheart, but let\u2019s face it \u2014 Mayer\u2019s a user and a loser. I could almost feel sorry for Aniston being stuck with a creep like that \u2014 if she hadn\u2019t run back to him after he publicly humiliated her.

Jen can do so much better than this disgusting douche bag.\n\n    Obviously she can\u2019t. Everybody else she\u2019s been with has dumped her flat. The douche bag is her last chance.\n    Jill what do you care who\u2019s Jens with. Please you have so much hatred for her. If she was with one of the biggest actors in the world you would still find fault. You have such hatred for Jen why do you live here on her site, doesn\u2019t angie have 2 new ones up?

She could avoid all this drama.\n    If I had a man I cared about I would ditch this garbage so\n    this sends a message loud and clear that Jen is trying to\n    keep garbage going in her life.\n\n  \u2022 Jill\n\n    Kay @ 02\/18\/2009 at 10:24 pm\n    And you brangelina loons are just jealous Jen has had 2 of her movies b #1\n\n    Jealous of what?? In case you haven\u2019t noticed, CCOBB has left the mutt movie in the dust at the box office. See what an Oscar nomination can do for your film? By the way, where is Fugly\u2019s nomination? Oh right, she didn\u2019t get one. Nice that HJINTY enjoyed one whole week as #1 before it got kicked to the curb by Friday the 13th.\n    Want to talk about #1 at the box office? Let\u2019s see now\u2026 Burn After Reading, Oceans 13, Mr and Mrs. Smith, Wanted, Kung Fu Panda\u2026 even Changeling, which you hags said was a bomb, has made $93 mil at the box office and counting.\n    So what are we supposed to be jealous of? Fugly getting dumped and re-dumped? Fugly being unable to get \u201cManagement\u201d and \u201cTraveling\u201d into wide release? Fugly having no children to Angie\u2019s six? Fugly being #50-something on the most valuable movie stars list while Brad and Angie are tied at #2? C\u2019mon, honey, give it your best shot. Tell us what\u2019s supposed to be making us jealous. By the time you can think up anything, I\u2019ll have read all of War and Peace and half of The Brothers Karamazov.\n\n  \u2022 I\u201dm winn and I weigh 300lbs.\n\n    I\u2019m on a sailboat in the Bahamas and I can\u2019t spell because it\u2019s 10 pm and the sun is shining on my laptop. Yeah I\u2019m on vacation but I\u2019m on some stupid post arguing with people I don\u2019t know. I return home tomorrow on Air force one because I\u2019m so smart and best friends with Obama. I need another hoho. Oh yeah I make 400K a yr. I\u2019m beautiful, I\u2019m smart- I need to wake up! I forgot for a minute I\u2019m a 300 lb. loser- oh well I can lie\u2026\u2026.\n\n  \u2022 ellie\n\n    Jill @ 02\/18\/2009 at 10:28 pm jade @ 02\/18\/2009 at 10:02 pm\n\n    Jade, you\u2019re a sweetheart, but let\u2019s face it \u2014 Mayer\u2019s a user and a loser.

Who cares no one is perfect now are we. John can even change.\n\n  \u2022 ellie\n\n    BJ @ 02\/18\/2009 at 10:33 pm Jen and John keeping the triangle alive.\n    How else are the publicity Ho\u2019s going to get attention.\n    Why would Jen go to this.

What drama are you expecting. Jen & John have been together for about a year now its her choice , she was invited so whats the problem? Why is that Jen causes the problems you people keep bringing it up.. Where all happy for Jen & John so move on..\n\n  \u2022 winn\n\n\n    When I was commenting to the other person it was about my comments that were in full daylight here in SC, around noon.\n\n    It\u2019s funny though that my life is so good that you are thinking that I\u2019m lying about it.\n\n    If you knew anything at all, you would know that most of the cadets that graduate from West Point are Republicans\u2026IDIOT. So no, I\u2019m not Obama\u2019s friend. I shook President Clinton\u2019s hand at the 1993 Graduation of my husband..he was CO 93, I graduated earlier. I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s such a big deal to simple people such as yourself though.\n\n    And..No. LOL I don\u2019t weigh 300 lbs..but you making up a comment like that must really hit home for you. Does your mom or white trash dad weigh 300? I hear it\u2019s not hard to do when you get WIC and food stamps like most trash does.\n\n    Yeah, I have a great life\u2026lol I life in The Woodlands Texas, I work in the Oil industry, and have a great life! My kids are in one of the best school districts in the country and if you think I have to lie about it, then I really feel sorry for you, because if you think I\u2019m lying about it, that means that you lie freely about your own self. Nothing I\u2019ve said is a lie, only truth..I don\u2019t have to lie.\n\n  \u2022 Casey\n\n    Winn they are trying to pull you off the topid whic is Jen and her douche bag.

        "text":"View Full Version : Me and my crazy dreams...\n\n02-01-2005, 10:14 AM\nLast night I had a really disturbing \"X-Files\" dream (Scully and all). I hadn't even been watching the show so I have NO idea where this came from...\n================================================== ========\n\nSo... I show up as an agent for the FBI and there is a field of corpses where a UFO had been sighted. We find a young girl (presumably played by the fabulous Dakota Fanning) in the middle of all these dead bodies. The one next to her was a man whose body was still intact but a giant chunk of his lower right leg had been burned to the bone. She's the only one who lived. We take her back to HQ and are trying to figure out what happened. On the way out, Scully sees one of the bodies moving and they have the body med\/evac'd to a military hospital.\n\nThe little girl eventually comes out of shock to say that she saw the UFO mothership, saw a flash of brilliant light and then she blacked out to awaken on the ship. Somehow she could see what was happening on the ground and all the people were catching on fire. The next thing she knew, she was back on the ground and saw the agents and the helicopters.\n\nScully rings and tells us to come down to the hospital because something's happened to the patient they brought in. We arrive to see that his flesh is breaking down and that, even though he has cellular structure and tissue fibre, there is barely anything holding him together. His name is \"Robbie\" and he is conscious and can speak a little but his lips are sticking together due to the consistency of his body tissue. His bones are basically cartilage. He tells us basically what the girl told us, but from a ground observer's point of view. He is so frustrated with what he is turning into that he struggles and rips his hands and feet off as he tries to break from the safety restraints. All of his bodily fluids start pouring out all over the floor and he dies.\n\nWe do some research and there seems to be a wave of sightings. The event where all the people got burned happened after the time between sightings in that area decreased. We notice that something similar is happening in another area so I am sent out there to investigate before the next event takes place.\n\nI am driving down this country road where there is an occasional estate set way back along this one hill that is covered in trees. To my left is pretty much all grain fields. I come to a crossroad and have to stop. Another car is coming from my right. The car slows down to a crawl as it passes. Though I cannot see clearly into the car, I notice that the driver is looking at me. I take the plate and make of the car before it speeds away.\n\nI continue driving down the road to this area where the UFOs seem to be hovering over from time to time and where a lot of the sightings are taking place. The road eventually turns into a driveway to a modest country estate that sits atop a hill.\n\nI get out of the car and start walking up a gravel service drive. I see a gardener and call out to him. He looks up and scowls. I hear him muttering something to me but it is not in English. He turns away and starts heading for a shed. I continue toward the house and see a wooden staircase that leads to a lower part of the property behind the house. I decide to take it. As I am heading down, I round this corner and bump into a young man who looks like \"Robbie\", the boy we brought into the hospital. He stares intensely at me and pushes past me. I noticed that his skin is severely scarred. I turn around and call out, \"Robbie?\" He turns around, opens his mouth and out comes this deathly scream like the roar of a million people dying.\n\n...then I woke up.\n\n02-01-2005, 10:33 AM\nThats a pretty cool dream :D Maybe it is one of those \"to be continued\" type of dreams.I've had those,very weird,like they pick up night after night(TV show in my mind ;))\n\n02-01-2005, 11:14 AM\nThe fact that you remembered that much detail amazes me more than the content, which was extraordinary to say the least. I usually only remember the basic plot and some random detail (i.e. the color of something). Let us know how it ends! :D\n\n02-01-2005, 11:57 AM\nI remember so many of my dreams in that kind of detail, which is probably why I am tired all the time. I really don't understand how they manage to be so tangible as if they were real experiences. I can tell you the exact colour of clothing people were wearing and how things smelled and what the flowers looked like.\n\n02-01-2005, 12:18 PM\nYou should have some sort of sleep analysis done. Perhaps you're not completely asleep. That could explain why your tired after \"resting\" and it might help to explain why your dreams are so vivid. Maybe by being awake your getting more detail (because your concious) than the rest of us, who are so unconcious were drooling.\n\n02-01-2005, 12:53 PM\nMy friend, Heidi, and I were with a group of people, taking a hike on a mild winter day. We followed this trail over a hill, into a deep valley and then back up another hill to a shelter of sorts. The shelter looked like a picnic pavilion but with waist-high stone walls around it. In the centre of the shelter were two large fireplaces that you could look into from either side. We had gotten all of our overnight gear set up and had a stew dinner. The group started cleaning up when someone said they saw a bright object fall from the sky. We looked over to where they thought it went. There was a bright glow over the hill from where we had come earlier in the day.\n\nWe watched it for a bit and then saw something start to rise from behind the hill. It was a huge black object with a strange glow and lights all over the surface of it. Suddenly, everyone started to feel what felt like sand being blown onto one's face by a strong wind. Someone looked over at another one of the campers and said that they were bleeding... like little cuts were all over their face. It was happening to everyone, so all of us ducked behind the stone wall. We stayed there until morning and packed up to head back into town.\n\nWhen we arrived in town, we noticed that the place looked deserted. Someone the people were still injured from the night before so we headed for the hospital. We discovered that everyone who remained in town had holed up there overnight and the only power was coming from the emergency generators. We were in the basement at the time, but there were still patients on the upper floors. We heard screaming, so I ran up the stairs with several other people. The windows were shattering and that \"sand feeling\" was happening again. We got all of the patients out into the hall and called for others to help bring them to the basement.\n\nThere was noise coming from above, so my group went to the roof hatch and waited for whatever to come in while Heidi helped with the injured. We heard movement in the hall below and went back down after jamming the roof hatch shut. Apparently, the aliens had come through the window. We didn't have any weapons, so we decided to use the fire hoses to push them back. After a few moments, the aliens started to fall to the floor and die. It was later discovered that they had no immunity to the microbes that lived in the water.\n\n02-01-2005, 01:07 PM\nMaybe your dreams are actually signs from God (or whatever you prefer) that this particular plot would make a killer movie and make you a million bucks.\n\n02-02-2005, 10:01 PM\nMy friend, Heidi, and I were with a group of people, taking a hike on a mild winter day.\nIn Switzerland? :D\n\n06-30-2006, 02:40 PM\nDecided to drag this thread back up.\n\nLast night I had a dream I was being chased by a white rabbit.Funny afterwords,but I woke up in the middle of the night because of it. Looking at dream meanings,the rabbit symbolizes transformation,white signals new beginnings,and apparently being chased by an animal symbolizes unexpressed anger. All quite interesting,,whether the symbols are actually \"true\" or not.\n\nOr perhaps I've made too many jokes about bunnies and going insane with my friends. Its just decided to come back to haunt me LOL\n\nPhantom-like Menace\n07-01-2006, 11:36 PM\nI had a dream with naked characters from Newsradio. It started out with that red-headed chick naked and washing her house, which means it started out bad. It then involved Andy Dick who was wearing a bathrobe that wasn't covering anything, which means it got worse. I woke up just after Maura Tierny pulled up naked in a car, so it at least ended on a high note. I truly wish I were making this up, though.",

        "text":"\n\nWhedonesque - a community weblog about Joss Whedon\n\"Oh no. Is that dragon thing behind me?\"\n11980 members | you are not logged in | 18 October 2018\n\n\nMay 03 2012\n\nA look at Joss Whedon's rise in popularity. \"Joss Whedon doesn't belong to us anymore. He belongs to the world now.\"\n\nFunny, I just posted some interviews with him on another board I belong to, and said that I was sorry but no, world, you can't have him. We saw him first.\n\nOver the moon for Joss' success, but not sure I'm ready to 'lose' him to the masses.\n\nNot that I have anything to say about it, just feels... lossy.\nSo Whedony, and yet it made me want to go watch the first episode of Studio 60.\n\nThere's a monthly get together of fans of Whedon in my city, that I've been trying to get to since January, but something always causes me to end up missing it. Looks like it's going to happen again this month too... Anyway this article suddenly had me wondering if a small gathering like that is going to start growing big time because of this... Interesting...\nA touching article to me. Yet, world fame simply had to come to Joss some day. Everything else would have been - unjust.\nJust like there were only like 150K people at Woodstock, yet millions of people claim they were there. In a few years, EVERYONE will be claiming to have been a Joss Whedon fan all along.\n\n[ edited by Penthos on 2012-05-03 17:16 ]\nI think he'll always belong to us in some way. He's been part 'mine' since I was 11 and watched Buffy for the first time. So for him not to be just ours is going to take time getting use to but I'm just so happy and proud of him for his success and recognition which is long past due.\nI said the other day that our fandom is about to turn into a popular tourist destination and I think that is probably going to be true. A lot of new people will decend on us. Some will stay and join us, while others will go back home, coming back occasionally when a new project hits the screen. We will expand and change. We won't be the same again, but I'm not sure we can anticipate how much we will actually change. Joss's way of looking at things will still be difficult for many people to appreciate. I would not be surprised if many who love the Avengers will look at his other work and simply feel that it just isn't for them.\nIndeed a touching article. But I have to wonder, what does the \"us\" even mean? At what point could one have become a part of this \"us\"? In 1997, when Buffy came out? Or in 2002, when Firefly came out? Or in 2005, when Serenity came out? I don't think The Avengers marks the end of an era at all. People discovered Joss through Firefly, then other new people discovered him through Serenity, and others still after DH, and after Dollhouse, and now after Cabin... it's an ongoing process.\n\nTying Joss' work to the time of its release does an injustice to the work itself. I found Joss just three years ago, watching Buffy on a whim. Should I consider myself a part of \"us\" or not? I wasn't around to see Firefly get cancelled, but don't I feel the monstrous injustice of it every time I watch it?\n\nOf course it's nice being part of a \"secret society\" but frankly, there will always be more people who don't know Joss' work than people who do. It's just that the community will be a bit bigger and, considering the ever-increasing number of projects to talk about, a lot happier.\nThis was a really well written article! Gave me goosebumps a few times. All I hope for is that his \"new found\" fame will give him the leeway to produce many more of his own stories. Getting something new from Joss at least once a year would be awesome.\nI'm all for more people falling in love with Joss. Spreading the joy is a good thing.\nprettymaryk - I think the \"us\" refers to anyone that has discovered Joss in a non mainstream way (in other words, any one that discovered him from anything other than The Avengers... so yes, you too). Erg, I had other thoughts but I'm having trouble wrangling them. So I'll leave it at 'and what that could entail.'\n\nAlso part of those other thoughts is something along the lines of 'not saying this is going to be bad, just very strange and different and interesting'\n\n[ edited by DreamRose311 on 2012-05-03 18:26 ]\nI know. I've been trying to come to terms with it. People get excited about The Avengers, and I just wanna rant and rave about Joss Whedon to them, but then I remember what he says in interviews, that it's not supposed to be about him. It's about the work. Let people respond to the work and come to appreciate him on his own terms. I feel like I've been safeguarding this extraordinary secret for over a decade, and now, finally, the truth is out. Joss Whedon is getting his long overdue public recognition.\nYou can rant and rave about Joss to them. Why shouldn't you? It's still a Joss Whedon film. Buffy is bigger than Joss too, he's just the one that drives it.\nOnce someone saw me on whedonesque and knew who joss was cause of buffy. that was the only time a 'norm' has mentioned joss to me.\nthe only other people I know are the friend who introduced to buffy,and my brother who I introduced to whedon.IRL,I mean. obviously I know a lot of people online.\n\nNow I've seen people talk excitedly about Avengers and it's strange, cause I've been following the comics for a million years and Joss for longer.\n\nI do hope that this means more people will know the amazingness that is Joss. Dr Horrible,Firefly,Dollhouse,Buffy,and beyond. cause they are all awesome and I want them to be known, but I guess it is a bit scary,like will they appreciate him properly?\nI'm sorry, but doesn't Joss get a say in this? Unless he starts doing only big mainstream movies, his fanbase is probably going to remain mostly geeky. I mean, more people wil know who he is,enjoy his work, but it doesn't mean they'll rush out to see Much Ado. I agree with those who said people discovered Joss through Firefly, Dollhouse, DHSAB, etc. Those people are, in general, thesame type of people as the orgininal fans. And that's the same here. Anyone who takes the effort to go back and watch all of Joss's previous work becuase they love his new stuff so much can't deny they're as non-mainstream oriented as the rest of us.\n\nAnd in that case, I welcome new fans, for they'll be no different than the rest of us. Those who really appreciate Joss... really appreciate Joss.\n\n[ edited by wasabi17 on 2012-05-03 21:09 ]\nI don't know how to feel about this. I just suppose it's \"selfishness\" to want to say \"well, I had him first!\" in an ex-boyfriend kind of way. Kind of like being obsessed with the Arcade Fire since 2002 then hearing their song at the end of the Hunger Games movie.\nI've been trying to explain the way I feel about Joss not being \"ours\" anymore, the only thing I could think of to compare this to is the way I felt being part of the early punk scene when CBGB's was my 2nd home circa 1977 and The Ramones were just another awesome band I saw a million times (I got jumped in my home town because I was wearing a leather jacket and a Ramones shirt, didn't matter that I was a skinny girl)... it became weird when they became so well-known but I had that strange feeling of pride, like \"I'm so happy for my boys but do I have to share them with the world???\"\nBut in the long run, the world will be a much better place with a lot more Joss Whedon in it.\nOh hell, I'm just so giddy and happy for Joss and us!!!\nSorry, but he does belong to me, or that certificate of authentication is total BS.\nMy worry was more about the inevitable tearing down that happens when someone is lauded for pretty much anything. Then I started to think about it. He's got a house that is 20 times nicer than where I live, a gorgeous partner, uber talented family and friends with nice noses, he's obviously smarter and funnier than me, so why the Hell am I worried about him? He'll be fine.\nI've been a fan of his long before I knew his name. And I don't mean that in a hipster sort of way. Just that I'm kind of clueless and unaware a lot of the time. But now that Avengers seems to be an OK flick, (I'm guessing based on what little buzz there is online...;) ), I'm assuming that there will be more Joss stuff in the future and maybe now people won't mess with it before we get it. Or mess with it while we are getting it. And then cancelling it before it's done. So, bring on the masses, I say!\nWhat concerns me though is actually the fandom getting too big to feel like, uh, home? (Yes, I'm getting sappy. Shut up.) So, yeah. Whatever.\n\nETA: and he probably doesn't make typos either.\n\n[ edited by NYPinTA on 2012-05-04 14:47 ]\nHappened to catch to glimpse of Joss with the Captain America shield in someone's paper on the train. 2 pages in the DC Metro's Express!\n\nI would argue, Joss has never belonged to his fans, and that change is inherent to the communities that have formed in response to his work. I think it's pretty cool he's made a big movie a lot of people seem to like, that is also pretty well aligned with his own interests. I think if we define ourselves in terms of the obscureness of our interests, we're setting ourselves up for disappointment, anyway. Culture's always changing.\nI completely understand the \"lossiness\" of sharing our beloved Whedon with the masses. But seriously, folks...wouldn't the world be a much better place if more people were Whedon fans? Think of all the marvelous, valuable, tickle-your-heart life lessons Whedon's works have taught you (taught US!) over the years. And now, maybe, fingers crossed, multiply that by millions for whom The Avengers becomes a gateway to exploring all things Whedonesque. Imagine if millions more got to know Buffy or Mal as role models. If millions more started questioning if the status is really quo after all. If more people start behaving, as Angel says, \"as though the world were as it should be, to show it what it can be.\" Don't we want the whole world to have these images tumbling 'round in their heads and h...

Stop everything you\u2019re doing right now! Trailer for Honey 2 just dropped, and it looks like just about every other teen dance competition movie that precedes it. OMG! It\u2019ll be in theaters (yes in theaters) June 10th! Is that Lonette McKee?\n\n14 comments to Just What You Were Waiting For\u2026 Trailer For \u201cHoney 2\u2033 Arrives!\n\n  \u2022 Aw, lawd!! That is Lonette McKee. Well, a check is a check.\n\n    Quietly, though, I will end up watching this. As a former cheerleader and part-time\/recreational hip-hop dancer, I *love* watching movies about dancing. Fame, Center Stage, Paris is Burning, Dance With Me\u2026Stomp the Yard.\n\n    *looks around furtively and logs off*\n\n    \u2022 blaqbird\n\n      lol same here! i love dance movies no matter how bad the directing\/dialogue\/acting is\u2026I just can\u2019t resist!\n\n    \u2022 Mr. Dawber\n\n      I hear you about the check. Gotta pay those bills, so I ain\u2019t mad Lonette. Plus, looking at her IMDb page, it appears that she\u2019s got some more serious projects in the works.\n\n  \u2022 JasonJee\n\n    Dance movies like cheerleader movies have there niche and in that my s\/o is in said niche I know I will be seeing it at some point. Interesting point in the original Jessica Alba\u2019s character was supposed to be a latina named Honey Garcia but she changed the name to Honey Daniels and got two Black parents.\n\n    \u2022 Shane\n\n      I found that weird when I notice that, but considering before Jessica told the world she was latina; she could got away with playing different racial background. But then again her acting has been mostly misses, instead of hits. When \u201cDark Angel\u201d came out and no one knew who she was people speculated she black and\/or latina\n\n    \u2022 OK, so I never saw that movie, but what was the rationale behind not making her latina? Do they explain on some DVD extra or something?\n\n    \u2022 I never heard of the \u201cGarcia\u201d surname, and I assume the name was Daniels because the role was created for Aaliyah before she passed away.\n\n      The ethnic switcheroo in lead actress, her character, and her love interest, is veddy veddy interesting\u2026 Jessica Alba\u2019s Honey was \u201clack\u201d, but Katerina Graham\u2019s (from The Vampire Diaries) character is Latina when the actress\u2019s ethnic background is Black\/Russian Jew. And I am also intrigued by the white love interest in this film, and the black love interest (Mekhi Phifer ) in the original Honey.\n\n  \u2022 You know, this is the kind of movie my eight-year old is starting to like. As long as there is nothing too inappropriate for her age, we\u2019ll sadly be renting this. Then I\u2019ll have to watch my munchkin imitate all of the dance for the next two weeks.\n\n  \u2022 Melissa\n\n    My life is complete after that uber-original trailer. ;)\n\n    Movies like this will cease to exist when we eliminate all the teenagers in the world! lol (kidding)\n\n  \u2022 Vanessa\n\n    Thanks for this post Tambay! It made my day\u2026 Audrina Partridge, Mario Lopez??! What?! This is destined for greatness. :-) *sarcasm*\n\n  \u2022 blaqbird\n\n    In the original, Honey was latina. In this one, it looks like it\u2019s a whole different character. In one scene, the lead tells Honey Daniels\u2019 mom, \u201cNot everyone can be like your daughter.\u201d So I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re still using the title \u201cHoney\u201d, but the character is not supposed to be the original Honey Daniels from the first movie. Not sure if that helps.\n\n  \u2022 pinksghetti\n\n    Was the first one popular or made enough money at the box office to warrant a part 2? But so many movies get sequels it probably doesn\u2019t even matter.\n\n    \u2022 Tamara\n\n      It was pretty popular :| I think.\n\n      And DVD sales are probably responsible for this sequel. And the dance moves. :)\n\n      \u2022 pinksghetti\n\n        Thanks. I see the original from time to time on MTV and BET (never actually watched it though). I remember people saying it was a bad movie so I never bothered to watch it. But I guess there is an audience out there for it.",

I like keeping wwes young talent a surprise. But new Japan isn\u2019t on daily from what I\u2019ve heard. So\u2026\u2026.\n\n    \u2022 RVDFan\n\n      I rather liked it when Cena was gone. I do like hi. But it was better without him. I mean all he ever does is trash talk like shit. And I hate him when he\u2019s champion. So I hope for the first time ever that del rio kicks his ass in hell In a cell. I can\u2019t stand Cena. He sucks. This is my opinion and it\u2019s totally true. Thumbs up if u agree with me.\n\n      \u2022 Bilal Mvw\n\n        I agree with you but it\u2019s not really an opinion, it\u2019s just facts. I wish they would, but what happened at hell in a cell two years ago? Del rio beat cena. So Unfortunetly it would be the other way around. But why should cena be world champion? Even dwayne Johnson appears on smackdown more than him, now that\u2019s saying something.\n\n  \u2022 ooooo\n\n    hhh is just fooling all the people he is just promoting wwe\n    he repeats best for Bussiness\n    infact he doing Best for Bussiness \u2026\u2026.he choose only those people opposed by audiences\n    and then hitting the people liked\n\n    he is just doing wrong things to do a right thing that is money for him \u2026\u2026.\n\n    \u2022 Bilal Mvw\n\n      Thats wwe. Heels should be the faces cuz there wwe\u2019s biggest ting. The heels are the reason why anyone watches the next week, not cud of faces. Who wants a hero vs hero. Sure they are great matches but from a storyline view it is week.\n\n  \u2022 mohammedashkhan\n\n    what a punch by big show at the last moment for triple h wow superb big show u defeated the evil\u2026lol. superb punch\u2026\n\n  \u2022 Bilal Mvw\n\n    Know won\u2019t be easy but old the unloaders replace the black green with the content on the wwe app\/ Wld b pretty...

So far, I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s been in the studio with Hit-Boy, The-Dream, Missy Elliott and more.\n\nPhotos: Bauer Griffin, Pacific Coast\n\nLike this Article?

And I guess her pregnancy introduced her to a world of comfy shoes she doesn\u2019t intend to move from because for a person who said she never wore flats and until pregnant her husband never even saw her in flats she\u2019s actually out wearing sneakers with no baby to carry as an excuse.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Nicole\n\n    i wish my thighs would consider leather pants. but those glasses are indeed fierce, loving jay\u2019s too, possibly a little bit more than beys\n\n  \u2022 Slimpickens\n\n    They\u2019re starting to look like alike.

        "text":"View Full Version : Profound Thanks\n\nAM Chair\n10-07-2002, 08:32 AM\nAs we return to our nomal lives here in Lancaster, on behalf of the staff of Ani-Magic, I want to send out my heartfelt thanks for supporting the Autumn Dream this year. I have no official numbers yet, but I'm quite sure we had lots more people than than the first two.\n\nI know for sure that we had a lot more cosplayers than 2 years prior. It is personally gratifiying to see my \"child\" stand up and walk this year. Ani-Magic is in the black, and it will be around for years to come thanks in part from your attendance. We beat very tough odds and pulled this off.\n\nThis particular edition has put the last nail in the coffin of politics at AM, something none of us wanted or needed. We have refuted all the rumor and propaganda that tried to kill this con over the summer. Anything said unconstructive about AM now is irrelevant. We'll always accept constructive criticism, but attacks just don't matter anymore. We will always try to make a better con for you.\n\nBut you who sew the dreams to life are ones who bring the con to life and we are thankful for that. Anyone can go to a con, but you guys and gals are the ones who provide the color and mystique to the cons of California. My hat's off to you. Thank you again for making Ani-Magic 2002 so successful and for ensuring we can do it again next year.\n\nRevell Walker\nChairman, AM 02\n\nFamira Damaris\n10-07-2002, 09:26 AM\nWe should be thanking everyone who made it such an awesome convention this year, Revell. ^^ I've been coming to Ani-Magic for three years now and it's just getting better and better. *grins* Kudos to all of you!\n\n10-07-2002, 10:56 AM\nI am sooo happy that you and all the hard work you were doing paid off and became the wonderfull time that we all had at Ani-magic! It brings me tears to my face cause I thought that there was not going to be a another one next year but hearing that good news that there WILL be more Ani-magics to come ......YAHOOOOOOO! YATTA YATTA! (Starts to dance on one leg from side to side) Basiclly thank you Revell*^_^*and a big thanks to your team of hard workers^_^\n\nDragoon Knight\n10-07-2002, 11:17 AM\nThank you Revell for all the hard work you and your staff have done to make this AM a great one. Will see you next year ^^\n\n10-07-2002, 11:27 AM\nIt was my favorite con last year. It was still my favorite con this year. I suspect it will be next year. Thanks, Revell. :D\n\n10-07-2002, 11:28 AM\n\nI don't know how you guys can be able to put up with it like you guys do, but when I saw everything that was going on down there, I hope that with my con, we can be able to do just as good as you guys did down there. I know that there were tempers flying and somethings didn't go as smoothly as others would've liked, but you guys pulled it off great.\n\nI know that I learned a lot when I was down there and I also know one other thing when it comes to this. Leave the polotics to the ones that can handle it and leave it out side of the con period. I can't wait to see Ani-Magic 2003 next year, and this time I'm going to be better prepared then the last time. I'm also getting my room resevered a year in advanced once I get the dates for the next con.\n\n\nIori E\n10-07-2002, 11:33 AM\nRevell, thank you. Thank you and the staff for your hard work and dedicated effort in making Ani-Magic happen. I'm glad to hear that you've overcome all the odds to bring this con to us. It's cool that everything's worked out, and I hope to see you next year.\n\n10-07-2002, 01:17 PM\nRevell, congrats on beating all odds this year and making AniMagic the best, damn con for cosplayers ever!! Despite a few minor problems...*COUGH!!* LAST MINUTE PANEL SCHEDULING *COUGH!!* (LOL, just kidding ^.^)...AM was great!!\n\nFor me, I look foward to AM every year (though I missed the first year), but it totally shows the dedication and teamwork that you and your staffers put into your work to make AM a success and it shows!

As I usually say, Revell...you and your staffers 'totally reek of awesomeness!! Oh, it's true...it's damn true!!'

I appreciate the support that all of the convention goers and our special guests gave to me and my staff and giving your unconditional understanding and being gentle with me when I told you this was my first time in doing this sort of thing.

Though I could not attend the previous year, this year made up for everything I missed out. Though it was a small convention, there's something about AniMagic's enviroment that truly makes it magical. The program line up was astounding. AniMagic has established what anime cons are all about. I was able to chat with a few industry people and spend time with friends and making new ones.\n\nCount on me being there in 2003. ^_^ Keep up the great work!\n\n10-09-2002, 08:24 AM\n\nAnimagic was a blast! Thank you for making it such a great con!\n\nI have been to a lot of sci-fi cons and anime cons in the past but this was was one of the best con experiences that I had.\n\nIt was so friendly and very cozy!\n\nAM Chair\n10-09-2002, 10:09 AM\nKudos right back at ya, big guy!
