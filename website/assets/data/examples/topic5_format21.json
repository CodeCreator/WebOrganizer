        "text":"Rush Limbaugh\n\nFor a better experience,\ndownload and use our app!\n\nThe Rush Limbaugh Show Main Menu\n\nRUSH: Folks, the next caller wants to try to help me through my dictation problem here on my iPhone 4S. I realize this is kind of like talking about golf to some of you. \u201cStick to the issues!\u201d But, believe me, it\u2019s one of my passions here. So indulge me. This is Sean in Bloomington, Minnesota. What\u2019s up? What, what, what, what what\u2019s the story?\n\nCALLER: Basically the way Siri works is there\u2019s an activation ticket that gets sent to your phone every day. My guess is for some reason that\u2019s expired, and it\u2019s not getting renewed. The easiest thing you can do is go into Settings and then General and Siri and turn it off right there.\n\nRUSH: Yeah?\n\nCALLER: Then reboot your phone, go back into Settings, and turn it back on.\n\nRUSH: You know, I thought about trying that, but when you try to turn Siri off it says, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take your kids and a bunch of other stuff, and it may be awhile before you get \u2019em back if you do this. Are you SURE you want to turn it off?\u201d (chuckling)\n\nCALLER: Yeah. It\u2019ll come right back on.\n\nRUSH: Okay, I\u2019m gonna try that right now. You turn Siri off then shut down the phone?\n\nCALLER: Yep. Turn the phone off then turn the phone back on.\n\nRUSH: And then turn Siri back on?\n\nCALLER: Turn Siri back on.\n\nRUSH: What do you do for a living?\n\nCALLER: I work with my father in a small business.\n\nRUSH: Related to computers?\n\nCALLER: No, it\u2019s just a hobby of mine on the side.\n\nRUSH: Yeah, that\u2019s me, too. Me, too. Did this happen to you?\n\nCALLER: Yes, I\u2019ve had it happen a bunch of times. I\u2019ve actually built servers to do what Siri does, but it doesn\u2019t go through Apple.\n\nRUSH: Well, now that\u2019s fine for me. This is not that problem. Although Siri is working and it\u2019s the dictation that\u2019s not, it\u2019s all the same thing.\n\n\nRUSH: Okay that\u2019s fascinating. So you just figured this out on your own because it\u2019s a hobby of yours?\n\n\nRUSH: Really, when you turn it off you get a message: \u201cIf you do this, you\u2019re gonna lose everything Siri knows. It\u2019s gonna be a while before it all comes back.\u201d And I thought, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll try everything before I do that.\u201d But, on your advice, I\u2019ll do it even as we speak in the next commercial break.\n\nCALLER: Sounds good.\n\nRUSH: Now, how Applized are you? You have an iPhone obviously, right?\n\nCALLER: Everything I own is Apple, practically.\n\nRUSH: Yeah?\n\nCALLER: If they make it, I\u2019ve tinkered with it, Beta-ed it, anything you can imagine.\n\nRUSH: Well, you have an iPad?\n\nCALLER: I do have an iPad. My wife doesn\u2019t.\n\nRUSH: Well\u2026 Ho! Wait. Do you have a new Retina 15-inch MacBook Pro?\n\nCALLER: I do not have one of the new MacBook Pros. I\u2019ve wanted them and looked at them and drooled over them in the stores but haven\u2019t had the cash to buy one.\n\nRUSH: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. You stay on hold, and I will try your suggestion, and if it works I will send you a 15-inch MacBook Pro. I\u2019ve got three of them sitting in there. I\u2019ll send you one. You\u2019ll have it tomorrow if it works, if your idea works. Are you game to try that?\n\nCALLER: I am. I hope it works.\n\nRUSH: I bet you do. (laughing)\n\nCALLER: I have a couple other tricks that you could do, too, that aren\u2019t the number one fix.\n\nRUSH: Ohhhh, okay. All right. Well, I\u2019ll play. I\u2019ll play. So you hang on. This is Sean in Bloomington, Minnesota. You hang on. I\u2019ll try this during the break, and if it works, you get the MacBook. By the way, your drooling is very justified. This is the fastest computer they\u2019ve made. It\u2019s the best computer they\u2019ve made. The display will take you a while to grow into it, but there\u2019s nothing like it out there. Okay, Sean, hang on. Thanks for the tip. That makes sense. My Siri ticket has expired. My certificate\u2019s expired and I\u2019ve got to restart it. I\u2019ll try it. That sounds like it\u2019ll work.\n\n\nRUSH: All right, I have tried Sean\u2019s method twice. I went in and disabled Siri. Shut the phone down, rebooted, enabled Siri, and it still isn\u2019t working. There\u2019s a real anomaly here, too. For those of you familiar with this, the alert tone you get when you either use Siri or hit the dictation button, my alert tone is half as loud, if that, as when it\u2019s working normally. Now, what happens, your dictation\u2019s sent to Apple servers. They transcribe it as text and send it back to your device.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing. I mean literally what they\u2019ve done is stunning. This happens in split seconds. But I got a server problem here \u2019cause I\u2019m not getting anything back, and I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m sending is getting to them. So now what do I do? Sean, I told him I\u2019d send him a new Retina display MacBook Pro 50 if it worked. Snerdley\u2019s being a hard guy. See, if I wanted to go the Obama route, I\u2019d say, \u201cOh, well, I\u2019ll give it to him anyway, even though that wasn\u2019t the deal.\u201d But he said he had other ideas if this didn\u2019t work. So we\u2019ll maybe see if we can get back in touch with him.\n\n\nRUSH: Okay. So we\u2019re gonna try again. We\u2019re now back with Sean in Bloomington, Minnesota. Sean, I\u2019ve tried it three times to no avail. I don\u2019t know if you heard me say I\u2019m running Beta on this.\n\n\nRUSH: You heard that. Okay. I don\u2019t want to be too loud about that if you get my drift here, but I\u2019m running Beta. I\u2019m running Beta 3. It worked for two days and then stopped. I\u2019m running the same Beta on an iPad, no problems whatsoever. It\u2019s just this one phone that is the problemo.\n\nCALLER: I did look online a little bit while I was off when you were still on break and everything. There have been rumors from a couple people that I\u2019ve seen that are big names in the iPhone world that have said Siri on iPhones iOS Beta 3 doesn\u2019t work the first time when you install Beta 6. A lot of them have said if you restart and reinstall Beta 3, it should fix the problem.\n\nRUSH: Yeah, that\u2019s the last thing I was looking to do.\n\n\nRUSH: That\u2019s a pain in the rear.\n\nCALLER: That was gonna be your last ditch. You wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\n\nRUSH: Well, it\u2019s a three-hour project to do that.\n\nCALLER: Yeah, exactly. But there\u2019s one other thing I had that I\u2019m praying will work \u2019cause I would love a MacBook Pro.\n\nRUSH: (laughing) What is it?\n\nCALLER: If you go into Settings and then General again, down at the bottom there\u2019s Reset. If you Reset Network Settings, it could just be there\u2019s something blocking the connection to Apple, and that resetting the network settings could free up that block.\n\nRUSH: Well, yes, yes. I could do that. I\u2019ll try it. I\u2019ll lose all my network passwords, but that doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll have to restore them.\n\nCALLER: That\u2019s the only thing you\u2019ll lose is your Wi-Fi passwords that you entered.\n\nRUSH: Okay, I\u2019m doing that now. We\u2019ll see what happens. So, Sean, hang on here. Don\u2019t hang up. Can you hang on?\n\nCALLER: I can certainly hang on as long as you\u2019re willing to have me.\n\nRUSH: Well, it\u2019s not gonna be more than five or six minutes. I just have the rest of the show to do here.\n\nCALLER: (chuckling)\n\nRUSH: Just don\u2019t go away. We\u2019re gonna put you on hold, just hang on.\n\n\nRUSH: Okay, Sean are you back? You there?\n\n\nRUSH: I reset the network settings, I reestablished the password for the local Wi-Fi network here, and still it doesn\u2019t work. However, since you eventually did tell me what will no doubt work, but that I had been putting off (and that is a clean reinstall of the damn thing), I\u2019m gonna send up the Retina MacBook Pro since you did know what it ultimately would take to fix this.\n\nCALLER: Well, thank you.\n\nRUSH: I just wish your first idea had worked. I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Well, I did think of it, but I thought it would be a hassle. It turned out not to be. Anyway, I appreciate your assistance. I\u2019m glad you took the effort. Here\u2019s a guy who recognized my passion and tried to help me. I like that. So, Sean, you\u2019ll have your 15-inch MacBook Pro Retina display via FedEx tomorrow.\n\nPin It on Pinterest\n\nShare This",

That was the concept behind these two lenses.\n\nWith 24-105mm we thought it would be the best match as a standard zoom lens to the EOS R camera, and the 35mm F1.8 was supposed to be an affordable and compact travel companion. Those were the concepts behind the four initial lenses.\n\nWith the six additional lenses that we introduced as development announcements this time, we believe we will be able to deliver more surprise factors, for some models compactness. These two concepts with the addition of these models.\n\nAbout the Defocus Smoothing technology.\n\nCan you give any insight into the DS technology?\n\nWith lens such as the 85mm F1.2 bokeh is a really important factor, because it\u2019s a portrait lens. We really wanted to deliver something that was not possible with the conventional lenses, so we decided to develop this technology of defocus smoothing.\n\nThe fact with our DS technology is that it\u2019s a coating technology, so it\u2019s relatively easy to apply this technology to a range of different lenses. This is all we can say at this moment.\n\nRead the interview at DPReview.\n\nBack To Top\n\n\nThis website or its third-party tools use cookies, which are necessary to its functioning and required to achieve the purposes illustrated in the cookie policy.

        "text":"What use is an F-call? Using a Foundation Call in Amateur Radio puts a number of restrictions on your on-air activities. The most bemoaned of those restrictions is the limit of 10 Watts output power. There is nothing like the experience of almost having completed a contact when a deaf lead foot stomps all over your signal and drowns you out. In the past I've pointed out that a group of Amateurs shares that experience and power restriction and more. The community I'm referring to is the QRP fraternity, who restrict their power to half that available to us and often make contacts with even less power. What I didn't think of at the time was that this community is also an excellent source of information and knowledge. Their drive is to do more with less and as a Foundation licensee, you cannot help but be in the same boat. So, look around you, search the web, find projects, bands, frequencies, antennas, radios, power supplies and activities that the QRP community engages in and you'll find common ground. I know that there is a slice of the Amateur Radio community who have the slogan, \"life is too short for QRP\", but as a Foundation licensee, perhaps it's time to wear your low power budget on your sleeve.

        "text":"Raspberry Pi's Eben Upton: we need to create a generation of producers not consumers | Wired 2013 video\n\n18 Oct 2013\n\n\nEben Upton\nNate Lanxon \/ Canon 5D MkIII\n\nThe west has created a generation of devices, such as smartphones and tablets, whose primary function is to allow people to consume content created by someone else, said Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton, speaking at Wired 2013. \"The direction we've drifted in has deprived us of a supply of computer programmers. We have a generation of consumers not producers, and consumption hardware and not production hardware,\" he said. \"We are trying to generate a group of people who see computing as an open environment, see it as a platform for creating their own destiny.\"\n\nUpton talked about the reasons why he launched the $25 linux microcomputer when he was teaching computer science at Cambridge University and found that there was a dearth of prospective undergraduates. When Upton had been young, he'd played with the BBC Micro, \"a wonderful machine\" which required the kids who used it to learn basic computer programming. It provided the Cambridge University with a \"stream of people\" who had already got their Malcolm Gladwell-prescribed 10,000 hours of hacking under their belt.\n\nHowever, when Upton was involved in computer science admissions, the numbers of applicants had dwindled, with many bright students coming in \"with no practical familiarity\" with coding.\n\nEben Upton\nNate Lanxon \/ Canon 5D MkIII\n\nTools such as the Commodore 64, BBC Micro and the ZX Spectrum had disappeared and been replaced with \"fixed function devices\", such as games consoles, mobile phones, and tablets. Upton flagged up PCs, saying that although they were programmable, they represent a \"less approachable platform\". All of this \"cut the legs off our supply of young people\".\n\nThis led Upton to wonder -- during 2006 -- whether there was still a niche for a machine that could go into a child's bedroom and would still be interesting. \"But if we were going to ask people to buy hardware it would have to be very cheap.\" He went for the $25 price point since he felt it was comparable to a textbook. \"I now understand that's an incorrect estimate. If we had a better idea of what school textbooks cost we would have had an easier job with the engineering over the years,\" he said.\n\nUpton massively underestimated the demand for the Raspberry Pi, thinking that 1,000 devices would be a good estimate. Prior to launching the product, he pestered the BBC to allow him to put the BBC brand on it \"because we are quite nostalgic\". \"They said no.\"\n\nThen in 2011, Upton went to see BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, who filmed the device and put it on his blog. \"It got 600,000 views in two days.\" \"We had this sudden 'oh shit' moment that we had promised 600,000 people to build a computer for $25 and we had no practical idea how to do it,\" he said.\n\nThat spurred him to develop prototypes by the end of the year, scaling production to around 10,000 computers. \"We sold 100,000 in the first day. We took down the websites of both of our distributors.\"\n\nUpton was surprised that almost all of those Pis were sold to adults. \"There was this wonderful latent demand among adults for a piece of Lego they could use to stitch together other pieces of electronics.\"\n\n20 months in and 1.8 million units have been sold. He hopes that by around 2020, universities like Cambridge will start to see the impact of the device in their admissions process.\n\nRead more from Wired 2013's incredible spread speakers, thinkers, innovators and thought-leaders in our Wired 2013 hub.",

        "text":"Email Interview with Smart Surface Sdn. Bhd.\n\nThis an email interview with Mr. Ammar from Smart Surface Sdn. Bhd.\n\nSmart Surface is a company focuses on providing multi-touch technology.\n\nWe hear from Mr. Ammar about the company's origins and visions and he shared with us about the future of multi-touch for both business and technical.\n\nMulti-touch technology is still very new. Windows 7 which provides support for multi-touch is seen as the potential catalyst to bring such technology out of the 'wow' factor.\n\nThe followings are questions and answers.\n\n1. Tell us a little about Smart Surface Sdn. Bhd. (who is the founder, key persons and what are the objectives) ?\n\nThe company\u2019s multitouch solutions was initially envisaged by the two co-founders, Faysal Abdulaziz (from Bangladesh, Malaysia resident) and Homam Alghorani (from Syria, Malaysia resident), during their study at APIIT and as part of their interest in multitouch technology, ubiquitous technology and related natural computer interfaces.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 2009, a Syrian entrepreneur living in Japan came to know about their research through the personal blog of Homam. He then offered the two aforementioned developers to co-form a company and fund their research. After several blog entries, emails, YouTube posts, Facebook investigation, as well as a few telephone calls back and forth, the three co-founders hammered out their vision and its details over several planning sessions in Kuala Lumpur and established Smart Surface Sdn Bhd.\n\nOf course our company and all its products are Malaysian and bear proudly the label \u201cmade in Malaysia\u201d since the first prototype launching on May 15th 2009.\n\nThe objective and vision of Smart Surface is nothing short of ubiquitous computing. We see computers integrated to our desktop, on our walls, and on every surface imaginable. As our communication needs change, computers need to evolve to meet that change. With our multitouch products, SmartSurface, we are seeking to reformulate the very concept of computing itself. Smart Surface Sdn Bhd has the potential of becoming a first Malaysian company (and even a first non-American\/European company) with a dominant presence and an established brand name that will be associated with the field of multitouch and surface computers all around the world.\n\n2. Smart Surface multi-touch technology, can you highlight to us what other products and services you are providing ?\n\nSmart Surface Sdn Bhd is specialized solely in multitouch solutions, and surface computers that are the main media to realize multitouch. We research, design and build surface computing units of different forms (tables and horizontal surfaces, and vertical walls) with multiple multitouch and gesture recognition technologies (rear-projection, LCD, IR, Laser) (see answer to Q4).\n\nWe also develop software and applications for these multitouch surface computing units.\n\n3. Multi-touch is relatively new in Malaysia, tell us a bit more on the market scenario?\n\nMultitouch and surface computer technology is still in its infancy but is expected to penetrate the market and occupy an increasing percentage of the touch screen technology pie. Multitouch technology will make a big leap ahead in the coming two-to-three years with the launch of Windows-7 which supports multitouch screens.\n\nIn order to increase market interest in multitouch technology, we intend to outsource the marketing, sales and lease business through distributing & reselling partnerships with partners who are strong in a certain field or industry. These partners have already their own customers and market penetration and they are best qualified at introducing this technology to the market.\n\nFurthermore, we consider that lease and rent provide enormous marketing possibilities especially until surface computing and multitouch technology establishes itself as a solid product in the consumer mind. Most businesses would prefer at this stage to rent and see what this novel product can benefit their businesses before they take the step further of a buy decision.\n\n4. Can you give us a hint on the pricing and the brand of your product range? Otherwise, tell us about your target customers.\n\nAt the moment we are concentrating on the following products:\n  1. Customized size vertical wall surface computers using rear-projection display technology; SmartSurface Wall.\n  2. Customized size horizontal tabletop surface computers using LCD display technology; SmartSurface Table.\n\nSince the size, shape and computing capacity are customized depending on the need of the customer, then the cost is different and we can not quote a simple price.\n\nHowever, to give an idea, a 40\u201d multitouch tabletop computer would cost around MYR 30,000 normally. Have in mind that some available products in the international market (such as Microsoft Surface) are selling for more than double that price for a unit with the same size and specs.\n\nRegarding the target customers, and due to the size and cost of the units, multitouch and surface computing is still beyond the reach of individual consumers unfortunately. We mainly target industries, commercial entities, and large institutions. At this early stage, our main customers are advertisement & exhibition businesses, smart offices equipments providers, and educational institutions.\n\n5. What technology platform is Smart Surface multi-touch technology (Windows, Linux or etc) ?\n\nThe platform could be either Windows or Linux depending on the request of the client. However, the core application and software are all developed using JAVA, Action Script AS3, Flex (Adobe) programming platforms, and Python and C++ programming languages.\n\n6. Do you believe in the concept of killer applications, if so, give us some of your ideas?\n\nWe do believe that multitouch has yet to find a \u201ckiller application\u201d beyond the initial \u201cwow\u201d factor that is attracting people to it at present.\n\nThe technology certainly works. However, we are still researching for applications which demonstrate how the technology might be used in a constructive (ie business etc) way beyond exhibition and events. That includes trying to identify areas where the multitouch technology would defeat conventional input devices. And by defeating, we do not mean just as an equivalent replacement, but having a clear advantage. At present, even with all the application we and other multitouch specialists are developing, we have to admit that there is no real full exploitation of the power of multi-touch.\n\n7. Can you point us to uploaded videos on YouTube or etc ?\n\nPlease refer to the following links:\n\nFor more videos.\n\n\nBrandon Teoh said\u2026\nFrom now onwards, all anonymous comments will be removed and will not be allowed.",

I\u2019d like to dig into a few concepts and areas that I haven\u2019t heard highly covered. macOS Big Sur comes with two important capabilities I was hoping we could talk about.

        "text":"#nban \u2013 The world\u2019s greatest tech. community\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular member of on-line Nokia communities, you may be familiar with Patrick Hamilton Walsh. He\u2019s the modern day adventurer who spent six action packed years travelling around the world. \u00a0While the countries and continents changed, one thing always stayed constant: The trusty Nokia smartphone in his backpack.\n\nNow, Patrick has got a book out, The Backpacker who sold his Supercar, which shares more of his life story and showcases his amazing trip with fifty never before seen photos, all taken with Nokia smartphones. We hooked up with Patrick to find out how his adventures around the world lead to him building one of the most active on-line Tech communities.\n\nWhat was the motivation behind you going off to travel the world with a Nokia?\n\n\u201cAs a sixteen year old, I asked myself a simple question, \u201cIf I could do any three things in the world, what would they be?\u201d Third on my list was to go out explore the seven continents of this great planet of ours.\u00a0 So, once I had completed my education and qualified as a Chartered Accountant, I sold everything I had, purchased a Nokia and off I went.\u201d\n\nAbhi FadingPhoto by:\u00a0Abhi Fading\n\nHow did this community begin?\n\n\u201cWhile planning my trip, I learnt that Nokia were releasing the N95 with a 5Mpx camera and I knew that it was the perfect tool that I just had to buy.\u00a0 The N95 was so far ahead of the game, there was no need for a camera anymore; my Nokia would meet all my electronic needs from alarm clock to calendar to camera.\u00a0 So, that is what I did \u2013 I set out to travel the seven continents of the planet using \u2018Nothing but a Nokia\u2019 (#nban) and I set up a Facebook group using that name so my friends and family could follow me.\u201d\n\nDeepak Khoenie\u00a0Photo by:\u00a0Deepak Khoenie\n\nAnd it just grew from there?\n\n\u201cYeah, it was a simple as that.\u00a0 In the early days it was just my friends and family that followed my #nban adventures.\u00a0 Today, the group has grown to over 8,000 active members with new members being added every day.\u00a0 It really is amazing when I think about it and how it has grown.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Edward Romain\u00a0Photo by:\u00a0Edward Romain\n\nWhat makes this community so special?\n\n\u201cThis group is special because it is so active \u2013 there are always members on-line sharing their phoneographs on #nban, engaging with others and leaving feedback for the other members in a positive manner.\u00a0 No matter a person\u2019s location, race, religion, creed, age or anything else, they will be welcomed into the group (which is known amongst the members as the #nbanFamily) with great warmth.\n\nThere is a real sense of family amongst the members with a lot of kindness shown to everyone.\u00a0 However, if I was to sum up the one ingredient that makes #nban so special, I would have to say, it is the mutual respect that all members have for each other \u2013 everybody is equal.\u201d\n\nHannele Sj\u00f6qvistPhoto by:\u00a0Hannele Sj\u00f6qvist\n\nWhat would make new members want to join \u2018Nothing but a Nokia\u2019?\u00a0\n\n#nban is a group that appeals to people that have an interest in capturing great photographs using Nokia devices.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter what device a person is using or how good they are at taking photos, all that matters is that they want to get better and are willing to support the other members to get better also.\n\nNo one in #nban is a professional photographer when they start (although some go on to achieve amazing things through the support of the #nbanFamily) \u2013 we are all amateurs that try to get better every day, by posting our photos and obtaining feedback from the community.\u00a0 We are always open to accepting new members and helping them to develop and get better.\n\nHarish PrabuPhoto by:\u00a0Harish Prabu\n\nIs it only about photography or does \u2018Nothing but a Nokia\u2019 offer more?\u00a0\n\nEverything in the community would appear to be based around photography, but the very essence of the group is the interaction with other members and the connection that exists through a shared love of Nokia. \u00a0\u00a0We set a weekly photography theme to challenge everyone to go out and try to capture some new and unique images based on a theme, such as #nbanColourpop.\n\nThrough our photography we get to see a totally new view of life, allowing us to learn more about different regions and cultures.\u00a0 I am still a backpacker at heart, so for me a lot of my interest in the group comes down to the people in it and the towns and cities that they live in.\u00a0 I am interested to see how they live and I enjoy people posting images of places that I travelled to during my \u2018Nothing but a Nokia\u2019 world travels.\n\nJeannette M. SacmanPhoto by:\u00a0Jeannette M. Sacman\n\nTo people outside the group, #nban may seem like a photography group, but there is much more to it than that \u2013 it is a place where we all learn from each other, everyone is selfless and there are no egos in the #nbanFamily. \u00a0The result is a friendly community of people sharing quality images, allowing us to see how people from all over the world live their life\u2019s on a daily basis \u2013 it is very interesting.\n\nNolie Ocoy 2Photo by:\u00a0Nolie Ocoy\n\nMany \u2018Nothing but a Nokia\u2019 members are now very well known within the Nokia Community \u2013 is that intimidating for new members?\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think so, in fact I believe that the success of the group comes down to the fact that the guys and girls that are well known are still very active in the group and very supportive of new members. \u00a0They almost take on the duty of guiding the newcomers with positive feedback.\n\nPeople join because of the pictures they see online from these guys and girls, but it is through the comments, the advice, the feedback, the incredible interaction and the friendship that keeps them coming back.\u00a0 The well-known people are still very humble and helpful to everyone.\n\nMatt Mahon 2Photo by: Matt Mahon\n\nWhat device are you using now and how does it compare to the N95 you had?\u00a0\n\n\u201cOver the years, I upgraded as Nokia devices developed. However, with the release of the Nokia Lumia 1020 last July, I knew that we were entering a new era in smartphone technology, particularly from a camera perspective.\u00a0 The \u2018phoneographs\u2019 that I had captured in Antarctica, Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe and the America\u2019s, as good as they were, would never again be able to stand comparable to the \u2018phoneographs\u2019 that will be captured on smartphone\u2019s in the future.\u00a0 Nokia has once again changed the game.\n\nMustafa WardakPhoto by: Mustafa Wardak\n\n\u201cThe Nokia Lumia 1020 with its PureView Pro imaging technology is going to take \u2018phoneography\u2019 to the next level \u2013 a level that I could never have imaged as I walked out of the Nokia store in Manhattan with a N95 in my hand and a smile on my face in 2007.\u00a0 With its high-resolution 41Mpx image sensor, Carl Zeiss optics, pixel oversampling and lossless zoom we are entering new territory.\u00a0 The quality of photographs captured on mobile phones has just changed forever.\n\nHowever, at the moment I am using a Nokia Lumia 1520 and I have to admit that, overall, it is the best device I have ever had.\u201d\n\nNarek HovasPhoto by: Narek Hovas\n\nWhat can we expect from \u2018Nothing but a Nokia\u2019 in the coming months?\n\nIn the past year we have spread the group into other social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Flickr and Pinterest and we will continue to do that as long as the demand spreads.\u00a0 My hope is that through #nban we will inspire all \u2018phoneographers\u2019 around the world to believe that they too can achieve the amazing results that the #nban community do, through a passion for phoneography and sharing.\n\nSajad Hassan WaryahPhoto by:\u00a0Sajad Hassan Waryah\n\nPersonally, my objective in life is to inspire other people to be their best selves and I have to admit that with #nban we have a great community that reflects that.\u00a0 Everyone there wants to capture great images using their Nokia devices to inspire people and to help them understand that we can all be an inspiration to others once we are true to ourselves.\u00a0 As a result I see #nban growing ever larger and stronger over the coming months and years.\n\nMinh Ma M\u00e3nhPhoto by:\u00a0Nolie OcoyMinh Ma M\u00e3nh\n\nComments (3)\n\n  1.
