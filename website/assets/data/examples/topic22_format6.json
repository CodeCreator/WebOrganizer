Foreign manufacturers risk losing their positions in this massive, lucrative and swiftly evolving market.\u00a0A team of Boston Consulting Group managing directors and partners knowledgeable of\u00a0the automotive and mobility sector bring a wealth of expertise to their concise outline of the competitive landscape in China\u2019s new mobility markets. Along with a sobering assessment of the challenges facing foreign original equipment manufacturers, their paper offers essential insights to help incumbents stay in the game.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nBrian Collie, Gang Xu and Alex Wachtmeister\u00a0managing directors and partners at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), leading the firm\u2019s automotive and mobility sector. Thomas Palme, also a managing director and partner, serves as a core member of the automotive and mobility sector and a member of the Center for Mobility Innovation. Christoph Meyer consults with\u00a0BCG, focusing on international mobility and transportation.\n\n\nAs China embraces new mobility modes, Chinese auto manufacturers stand to dominate the market.\n\nChina represents the largest automotive market in the world, accounting for more than 27 million sales in 2018. Now, China could also become the world\u2019s major market for emerging mobility modes. Already, China represents the largest market for ride hailing, thanks in part to Beijing\u2019s promotion of ride sharing. The Chinese government is also pushing for significant increases in autonomous vehicle (AV) and electric vehicle (EV) use. And as this shift occurs, Chinese manufacturers are coming out on top. Didi Chuxing commands ride hailing, having defended the market from both Uber and its domestic competitor Meituan Dianping. Tech mammoth Baidu has taken the lead in AV development; its Apollo autonomous driving platform could give it a lock on the Chinese AV market. Baidu participates in the AI National Team initiative \u2013 China\u2019s bid to become a world leader in AI. And Chinese EV start-ups are benefiting from massive investment, along with generous...\n\nComment on this summary\n\nMore on this topic\n\nBy the same authors\n\nWhat's Ahead for Car Sharing?\nCoronavirus Outbreak Deepens Its Toll on Global Business\nWhy America Is Afraid of TikTok\nShared, Electric and Automated Mobility (SEAM) Governance Framework\nChina\u2019s Belt and Road Could Have Been Great but Now Threatens to Be Disastrous\nUnconventional CEOS\nA Primer on the Geopolitics of Oil\n\nRelated Channels",

        "text":"Per Schroeder\nPer Schroeder SuperDork\n4\/8\/09 9:40 a.m.\n\nNearly 25 years ago, the sport compact wars came to American soil. Since then, the souped-up versions of tamer four-cylinder vehicles have ceaselessly been pitted against each other. At first it was the Rabbit GTI against the Omni GLH. Then it was the Civic Si and Integra Type R vs. the world. More recently, the Evo has taken on the STI.\n\nRight now there\u2019s a slight quiet on the battlefield as we await the latest combatants from Mitsubishi and Subaru. This lull gives three new contenders a chance to shine: the MINI Cooper S, the Mazdaspeed3 and the super-brand-new Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V. Perhaps one of these three will steal the spotlight before the next generation of rally-bred supercars is unleashed.\n\nEach of these hot compacts has strengths and weaknesses, but they are all clearly aimed at our market.
