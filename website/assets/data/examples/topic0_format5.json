        "text":"They would ask you to shower and make yourself look presentable before you meet one of the gorgeous Escorts. They will spend a lot of time making themselves look sexy for you and would appreciate that you do the same for them. They love nothing more than their customers looking smart and smelling nice.\nIt's really appreciated if you could let your Escort know as soon as possible about the cancellation. We do hope that you do not miss out completely and make another booking for a different date and time.\nI am sure that once you have met your Escort for the night, your nerves will disappear.

        "text":"Dress and Decorum (FAQ)\n\nFirst and Foremost, this is a\u00a0PRIVATE PARTY\u00a0Adult Couples to Couples Social Club. \u00a0Our members are what make the Club, and we take Member input Seriously.\u00a0Always allow\u00a0RESPECT\u00a0to guide your personal choices & you will have a Fantastic Time.\n\n\nSo Now What???\n\nYou have looked at our Website, done lots of other research, and are really wanting to take the plunge into the Realm of the\u00a0Adult Couples to Couples Lifestyle Experience.\n\nIt\u2019s just that you really do not actually know what to expect and that can be Intimidating.\n\nThis Page is designed to address the most\u00a0Frequently Asked Questions\u00a0and\u00a0to help you navigate your way to come and visit us with your Comfort in mind..\n\nIt is our Goal that The moment you Enter I.T.s you will have a\u00a0Real sense of Welcoming Warmth & Comfort.\n\nIve Never been to a Swingers Nightclub before, How am I supposed to act?\n\nYou Should behave as you might in any other 'Get to Know You' Social situation - with Respect! \u00a0Always Remember, our Primary Rule - No means NO - It is Never Acceptable to Randomly Grope or Grab anyone.\u00a0\n\nThat type of behaviour is Harassment and will see you Removed from our Club\n\nI was told that Swing Clubs are Sex Clubs and that\u2019s what I want. I should be able to expect \u2013 sex! Right?\n\n\nWe do NOT provide Sex, Sell Sex, or leave ANY uncertain idea that we are about hooking the members &\/or guests up.\n\nRather,\u00a0Intimate\u00a0Times provides a Fun & Safe\u00a0playce\u00a0for Likeminded People to hang out & meet each other.\n\nWhat can I expect when I arrive?\n\nYou will be greeted at the door by a Door attendee. We will explain to you certain rules and you will sign a waiver of confidentiality \u2013 thus you will need to bring your GOVERNMENT ISSUED PHOTO IDENTIFICATION. You will then pay your cover charge, and we, or the members you are with, will give you a tour. We can address any of your further questions at this point.\n\nShould you wish, we will introduce you to some other members. If you are more private, you may choose to sit at the DJ booth or meander over to the free Pool Table to sign up for \u00a0a game. The music will be on, with our DJ starting to play around 10pm. It it appears that everyone knows each other, it is because often they do. The most fun open people come out to Club Intimate Times :)\n\nWhy Photo ID? I want to be ANONYMOUS!!!!\n\nDiscretion is our Motto. \u00a0Upon entry you will sign a Waiver and Confidentiality Agreement - this is a legal document that requires Government Issued Photo ID.\u00a0\n\nEach person who becomes a Member Recognizes how their personal security is increased because of this.\n\nIf we were to allow People to Use a false name on our waivers, that person\u00a0would\u00a0have no stake in assuring your privacy.\u00a0Photo ID assures that all Members, Guests, and Staff, are real and that they understand the document they are signing is legal.\n\nOk, I understand the photo ID part now, but what if I run into my neighbor or cousin or __?\n\nThis happens and it can be a bit disconcerting the first time. All we say is that everyone at the club has 1) signed their waiver, and 2) has their hand in the Same Cookie Jar. They are likely as surprised as you, but they also understand. As we stated, our club is about the freedom to be who you are.\n\nHow do People tend to interact at Intimate Times versus a regular nightclub or lounge like environment?\n\nThe biggest complaint that We hear about Regular lounges\/nightclubs or other Non-lifestyle similar Venues, is that they cater mostly to singles trying to pick up other singles.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that style of interaction is often competitive and rude. There seems to always be a group of younger adult females pointing and laughing at another group of people. There are always those testosterone laden males trying to pick up someone while pushing the other boys away \u2013 all this strutting can easily lead to Bar Fights & other forms of Stupidity.\n\nWhat you will Find at Intimate Times is that People arrive, generally speaking, in couples.\u00a0\u00a0If the \u2018He\u2019 is interested in a \u2018She\u2019 then he will often introduce himself to her OTHER 1\/2 first. There is no vying for attention or wiggling of one\u2019s peacock feathers.\n\nThe lifestyle is about encouraging each other to explore and fulfill their fantasies, it is NOT about possession.\u00a0\u00a0There is no reason to fight because everyone understands that part of the game is the flirty fun & the game is played with ultimate respect! Smiles are a bound in this very freeing atmosphere.\n\nWhat kind of things do you have at the club so we can interact?\n\nWe are set up much like a Nightclub with the Feel of a House Party.\n\nWe have a dance floor, a DJ Booth (complete with a live person to converse with), a pool table (no coins required), a \u2018fireplace\u2019 lounge area (a bit more quiet), a cash bar, complementary chips, nuts, chocolate, fruits, lots of\u00a0snax\u00a0available both Friday & Saturday (you can even make yourself a sandwich!). Saturday offers a selection of even more tantalizing items \u2013 both hot & cold.\n\nAll of this and an amazing group of people for a relatively small cover charge! We often play interactive games and give prizes away to the winners. Saturday nights always sees a number of Door Prizes given away to members and each time you attend the club, we submit your name if for a major loyalty prize given away approximately each 3 months.\n\nA couple of times per year, We host some of the biggest hotel parties that include dinner, dancing, prizes, & highly discounted hotel room rates. These parties are visited by people from all over North America!\n\nWhat does cover charge include?\n\nEntry Cover charge includes all the fun & complementary goodies just mentioned, plus a supply of amenities that need a fair degree of maintenance.\n\u00a0Before thinking our rates are high, consider this:\nA movie for 2, popcorn & a pop will set you back approximately $50\/couple and will last 2 hrs. We include food, pool, & entertainment for the whole evening \u2013 9pm \u2013 3am \u2013 for the $35 member couple\u2019s rate (before 10pm). At the movie, you must purchase their\u00a0snax\u00a0& pop, at our club your\u00a0Snax are included in your Rate, We have a Cash bar that offers all varieties of beverages at reasonable rates. Plus, WE pay the GST \u2013 it\u2019s is included in your Entry.\n\nWhat about B.Y.O.B?\n\nWith regard to B.Y.O.B., it is illegal for an individual to bring liquor onto ANY commercial property for the purpose of consumption unless that establishment has a license that supports it \u2013 such as a \u2018bring your own wine\u2019 option at a restaurant.\u00a0\n\nWe do not have that sort of license nor is it possible for us to get one. The AGLC can fine any person who contravenes that rule. We encourage our members\/guests to be smart & safe about their decisions.\n\nDo we have to Swing? Do we have to allow anyone to touch us? Is this a \u2018free for all?\u2019 ???\n\n\nWe have Many Members who Never Swing - They come out to enjoy the Safe Fun Environment .\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not really comfortable with my body - I don\u2019t think I look like Barbie (or Ken).. Will I be accepted?\n\nWe at\u00a0Intimate\u00a0Times believe that Beauty & Sensuality are exuded via One\u2019s attitude -\u00a0Sensuality is an Attitude and True Beauty is Exuded through Ones Eyes and Welcoming Smile! Our Club is FILLED with the Sexiest People because the People who come to our Club have the Sexiest & Most Fun Attitudes!\n\nWhat if we meet people & they are interested in us, & I find that couple attractive, but my partner does not?\n\nIf there is chemistry all around, then that\u2019s great!! If not, well don\u2019t push it or ultimately you will just be bringing trouble for yourself & your partner - it isn\u2019t worth it. You ARRIVED as a\u00a0COUPLE\u00a0and that is your primary relationship to nurture. The last thing anyone need do is to encourage exactly those\u00a0behaviours\u00a0that hurt our loved ones and harm our closest relationships.\n\nOur Club is about\u00a0Bringing you Closer as a Couple\u00a0\u2013 Sharing More, Being More Open & Honest\u00a0about Your likes, dislikes, wants, desires, & fantasies\u2026 and then making them Happen. All this being said, sometimes a simple set of signals between a couple will go a long way to avoid an awkward situation.\n\nRemember too, there is value in all Friendship.\n\nHow do we Say \u201cNO\u201d to a couple who are perhaps fun but there is just no chemistry on our part? We do not want to be rude.\n\n\u00a0There are many ways to say no \u2013 mostly via body language. But if you are faced with something more directly, simply be honest. I like you both but not in that way.\u00a0\u00a0It also the most kind to be honest early so that other couple can move on should they choose to. All of the members have many friends in Club who they have never connected in that way with & for many different reasons.\n\nSuppose that we both feel comfortable and would like to go to an Open Play Space\u2026 (either at a private home, hotel room, or other recreational space), However, we have not yet \u2018connected\u2019 with any particular couple, Can we just \u2018join in\u2019?\n\nGenerally speaking, NO.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou can only \u2018join-in\u2019 if invited. You can Ask to be invited. However, perhaps you could consider the creation of your own play space - your enthusiasm will go a long way towards the attraction of other couples. You may be surprised at how many couples ask to join your party.\n\nSmile & Show interest & You may just Get an Invite\n\nIs there a Dress code? What am I supposed to wear?\n\n\"Classy Chic\"\u00a0or\u00a0\"In-Theme\". The idiom\u00a0\u201cDress to Impress\u201d\u00a0has Real Meaning here. Thus, unless that is the theme, NO Sweatpants, NO Track outfits, NO \u2018Gangsta\u2019 wear \u2013 and that includes Ball Caps, toques, stocking caps, (other hats, such as Cowboy, bowlers, etc, specifically styled for the theme or the outfit are usually acceptable).\n\n\u00a0NO Dirty, NO Unkempt..\u00a0need\u00a0we Say More?? Be aware that the Manager of the Day and\/or the Door attendant reserve the right to refuse entry based on dress & Hygiene.\n\nWhat Else should I be aware of with regard to my visit?\n\n\u00a0Be clean, be fresh, take a shower, comb your hair, brush your teeth,\u00a0DEODORIZE, (even if YOU don\u2019t think you smell \u2013 few things turn... (truncated)",
