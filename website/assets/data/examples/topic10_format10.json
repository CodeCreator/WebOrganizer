        "text":"Submitted by Nancy Severy\n\nThe Fort Bragg Food Bank kicked off the 2012 holiday season with a brand new fundraiser the Soup & Chili Cook-Off. Fifteen local chefs created an amazing variety of delicious soups and chilis from venison soup to some fiery chilis to a cooling strawberry bisque. Cook-off attendees sampled each entry and chose the best in each category.\n\nFirst place for the \"Best Soup in Town\" went to Living Light Caf\u017d for a warm and hearty corn and sweet potato chowder, perfect for the chilly fall weather, while Little River Inn won second place with a rich and elegant lobster bisque. First and second place for the \"Best Chili in Town\" went to Joshua Richardson of Edward Jones and to the Savings Bank of Mendocino County. The prize for best decorated table went hands-down to Little River Inn, represented by Steve and Printha Worthen who created, on their table-top, a small town vignette complete with a miniature food bank and a running electric train.\n\nIn the afterglow of this warm and friendly event, the Food Bank is gearing up in earnest to meet its season's goal to provide the fixings, including a turkey, for a holiday meal for every Food Bank family that needs a little help. We expect to serve about 600 families this year.\n\nThere are many ways for our generous community to help ensure that our friends and neighbors in need are able to sit down to a warm and delicious Thanksgiving meal with loved ones. We encourage folks to give through any means that touches their heart and fits their budget. Through the Food Bank Turkey Challenge, donations of $200 or 20 turkeys (or more) will be matched by the following local businesses: Savings Bank of Mendocino County, Mendocino Coast European Auto, Team Insurance and Financial Services and Paul and Barbara Clark of Century 21 (up to a total of $4,000).\n\nLook for Turkey Dan (aka Dan Fowler, Food Bank board president) who will be out and about in the next week or two encouraging grocery shoppers to \"Buy a Turkey for the Food Bank\" while you're shopping for your own holiday feast. Also, please consider dropping a bag of poultry stuffing, a can of cranberry or pumpkin or any other holiday food item into our food donation barrels. These small donations make a tremendous difference. Donations may be dropped off at the Food Bank at 910 N. Franklin St.\n\nCash donations, large and small, are needed and welcomed. They give us the means and flexibility to fill in the missing pieces.\n\nThank you, one and all.",

        "text":"Boomtown Brewery to open in Hibbing at former Zimmy\u2019s location\n\nZimmy's in Hibbing, Minnesota\n\nZimmy\u2019s Restaurant in downtown Hibbing, Minnesota, closed March 6, 2014. Zimmy\u2019s became\u00a0the primary landing spot for Bob Dylan fans who come to the Iron Range to see the music icon\u2019s hometown. It\u2019s now slated to become the Boomtown Brewery this year.\n\nAmid tough times for small businesses on the Iron Range, one entrepreneurial couple bucks\u00a0the trend. Eric and Jessica Lietz, owners of the iconic Whistling Bird Jamaican restaurant in Gilbert and Boomtown in Eveleth, will now open a brewery in Hibbing.\n\nThe Boomtown Brewery will be located at the former Zimmy\u2019s Bar and Restaurant in the refurbished old trolley car depot on Howard Street. Zimmy\u2019s, a popular destination for Bob Dylan fans in his hometown of Hibbing, closed in 2014. Rumors that Boomtown would expand there persisted over\u00a0the last year. Those rumors were confirmed after the Lietzes received a $100,000 loan from the Hibbing Economic Development Authority this week.\n\nKelly Grinsteinner of the Hibbing Daily Tribune shared this description of the Boomtown plans\u00a0in a story today:\n\nThe Boomtown Brewery will serve American cuisines with a twist, much like the Boomtown restaurant in Eveleth does now, said Jessica. Tap beers will be brewed inhouse here, and served in both locations.\n\n\u201cThe brewery will be displayed on the former pool deck and darts area for guests to see the brewing process,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice because the basement is right below it for plumbing accessibility. This will be the feature wall, and will it be exposed so everyone will be able to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u2026\n\nThe aim is to open the Hibbing location in the late summer or early fall.\u00a0\u2026 The Lietzs anticipate a minimum of 45 employees for the Hibbing location.\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere will be warm, yet modern. Mining culture will be incorporated into the restaurant through art and a Howard Street mural will be added. Raised booth seating in the bar area and liquor bottle lighting will also be used to create a concept like that of Boomtown in Eveleth.\n\nTwo new brew pubs are in the works in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, some 35 miles to the southwest. The city of Duluth has enough\u00a0brew pubs to feed and intoxicate a Roman legion. I\u2019m sorry, a plaid Roman legion with cool beards.\n\nIt\u2019s a popular trend, and one that seems tied to a younger customer base. That\u2019s good news as the Iron Range region seeks to attract and retain younger workers, while also drawing new investment and innovative ideas.\n\n\n  1. Now if they\u2019d make HCC a 4 year school\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\n  2. Mike Rutter says\n\n    Good news for Hibbing. I graduated in \u201977 and have since lamented the loss of the economic vibrancy the area once had. Always enjoy going back and hitting the Old Howard (now Mike\u2019s Pub), and look forward to visiting Boomtown.\n\n  3. Well, there are only four brewpubs in Duluth. Duhb Linn\u2019s, Carmody, Fitger\u2019s Brewhouse & Canal Park Brewing.\n\nSpeak Your Mind\n\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",

        "text":"Phones Finding Way Back To Dining Table\n\nSeptember 26, 1986|By Jay Pridmore.\n\nTelephones are dedicated to making our lives easier--until we sit down for a meal. Then they are awfully inconvenient.\n\nBecause of that, or in spite of it, restaurants once put phone jacks in walls next to tables. The image comes to mind of a tuxedoed captain calling out one`s name, phone in hand, and bringing vital calls between the shrimp cocktail and steak diane.\n\nMaxim`s, when it was owned by Nancy Goldberg in the `60s and `70s, had this service. But by the time George Badonsky reopened the restaurant in 1984, the phones were seldom used. It seems that discretion overcame prestige when calls came during lunch.\n\nBut could it be that conspicuous phone calls are making a comeback? Diva Ristorante, the atrium eatery at 525 W. Monroe St., has phones at all tables\n\n(some have two phones) next to the spoons.\n\nAt La Tour, 800 N. Michigan Ave., the technology is more subtle. The restaurant has a wireless phone, offered to patrons who request it.\n\n``We don`t advertise it,`` says a manager of the restaurant. People aren`t immediately aware of the possibility of using phones because there are no phone jacks. But for those who get antsy, the service is free of charge for local calls.\n\nThe phone technology in restaurants has limits, it seems. A year ago, vendors were pounding the streets, trying to sell the latest in the technology: a coin-operated cordless phone. From the looks of it, these sales did not get very far. One manager threw a salesman out of his restaurant with the remark, ``I want my customers eating, not phoning.``\n\nMany do both, of course, as has long been the custom for some people at Nick`s Fishmarket, First National Plaza. Nick`s has had phone jacks at each table since it opened nine years ago, and some regulars get phones placed at the table automatically.\n\n``They are mostly commodities traders,`` says manager Steve Karpf. ``And also some attorneys who are always on the beeper.`` He claims that another regular often brings guests to lunch and spends the entire meal on the phone. The elan of phoning from the table has worn off since the days it was de rigeur at Booth One at the Pump Room. But there is always help for those who need it--a cellular phone, for example, packed up neatly in a briefcase and transported to Burger King, if that is where you happen to take lunch.\n\nAt Tania`s, on Logan Square, a gentleman recently was calling from his table on such a contraption, with a slightly conspicuous antenna rising out of his attache on the chair beside him. It is important to stay in touch with different time zones in the foreign currencies business, he explained.\n\nAfter a few drinks, he said it was too early to know if any of his calls this evening had earned him any money. But that was only half the point.\n\n``When I walk in with this,`` he said, ``it is power. Instant power. Do you know what I mean?``\n\n\nIn Chicago, the German tradition of Oktoberfest runs from now into next month, starting with the Second Annual Berghoff Oktoberfest. The restaurant has blocked off Adams Street between State and Dearborn Streets from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. through Saturday. Besides Berghoff`s own beer, which is being issued in bottles for the occasion, the menu has brats, sauerkraut, barbecued beef, apple pastries and other ethnic food. A band from Heidelberg, West Germany, will entertain, and the burgermeister of that city will be on hand.\n\nAnd at Zincs, 555 W. Madison St., an Oktoberfest featuring Alsatian food and wines started Monday and runs for two more weeks. Besides Gewurztraminer and Riesling wines, dishes such as onion tarts, choucroute and fish stew will be offered as specials. Phone 902-2900 for details.\n\n-- Fashion shows at restaurants may seem boring, or perhaps impertinent, if the restaurant is supposed to constitute a fashion statement in itself.\n\nBut they can be interesting, something different. At Pronto Ristorante, 200 E. Chestnut St., manager Katherine Ferrari has arranged with new Chicago designers to show their work, with informal modeling every Wednesday between 12:30 and 1:30 p.m. Many of the shows have won praise, not just from women, but from men who happen to be eating there at the time.\n\n``We have a tendency to serve a business clientele,`` says Ferrari. ``The fashion shows open it up to the leisure luncher.``\n\nWhile Pronto is showing avant garde designers, the 95th restaurant, 875 N. Michigan Ave., is involved with the mainstream. It has a show of Bonwit Teller fashions during lunch every Thursday.\n\n-- Leeann Chin Carryout Chinese Cuisine may be the first carryout chain to capture Chicago`s growing interest in gourmet Chinese cuisine. The firm`s first Chicago location recently opened in Lombard, at Oakbrook Square on Butterfield Road. Another will open at 543 W. Diversey Pkwy. in the next few weeks, and still another will come to Woodfield Mall in late November.\n\nThe chain, which got its start in 1980, was later acquired by General Mills. It features sleek, modern, deli-like decor, and a number of pan-Chinese dishes: lemon chicken, sweet-and-sour pork and Szechwan shrimp, as well as a full range of Chinese appetizers. Prices range from $1.95 to $4.50 for individual dishes.",

Part of McDonald\u2019s resurgence in recent years was because of their new McCafe drinks and improved roasted coffee. But in addition to giving coffee chains like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts a run for their money, all those polystyrene foam cups create massive amounts of waste.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the waste problem, international health organizations like the International Agency for Research on Cancer have suggested that styrene in any form could have links to cancer. And as more consumers question not only the ingredients that make up their food, but the packaging in which they are delivered, even large companies like McDonald\u2019s are taking a hard look at how they wrap and contain their products.\n\nCalls for improved packaging are a familiar refrain for McDonald\u2019s. In the 1980s, growing outcry about those bright polystyrene clamshell burger containers pushed McDonald\u2019s into using paper instead. McDonald\u2019s touts its reduce, reuse and recycle program, and now this is the opportunity for the burger giant to put its money where its mouth is.

The restaurant held its grand opening on Sunday, Aug. 21, featuring a discounted menu and samples of its fare.\n\nThe I-86 Express was built along with the hotel in 2001. The complex was built by Norbert Cross as a complement to Peek n' Peak resort, which he owned at that time.\n\nArticle Photos\n\nPhoto by David Prenatt\nAdam Thornton, manager of the I-86 restaurant, prepares to serve new customers\n\nThe restaurant was closed after a few years of operation, however. The most common reason given for the restaurant's demise was that the prices were too high.\n\nMaroun Kneiher, general manager of the Holiday Inn Express, spearheaded the renovation and reopening of the restaurant and agreed that this was probably the case. \"I compared the old menu to ours. Some of the items were the same price then as they are now on our menu,\" he said.\n\nCross sold the hotel and restaurant, but the next owners kept the I-86 Express closed, using it as a storage building for several years. The big blue sign was covered over and no improvements were made. Still, guests as well as people traveling by on the I-86 Interstate would inquire if the restaurant were open.\n\nWhen the Holiday Inn Express was sold to new owners from Michigan and Findley Lake Properties was incorporated, the possibility of reopening the I-86 Express was immediately considered. Once several improvements had been made to the hotel, work began to renovate the restaurant in February.\n\nIt took several months to complete preparations for the restaurant. One of the hardest things was finding the right person to manage it. Kneiher finally hired Adam Thornton.\n\n\"Adam was referred by several people,\" Kneiher said. \"So I checked his references and brought him in for an interview.\n\n\"I've been trying to make many improvements to the hotel, and now we have the restaurant. It's rewarding to have something there for the guests and to tell them that we do have a restaurant on site.\"\n\nKneiher said that he hopes the restaurant will become a favorite dining place for the people of the area as well as for guests.\n\n\"I want the town to be happy with the food,\" he said. \"I want people in the area to be happy with the food.\"\n\nThe response has been good so far, Kneiher added.\n\n\"Everyone has been happy with the prices and even happier with how the food tastes,\" he said.\n\nThe 1-86 Express offers many choices to the visitor including half-pound hamburgers, pizza, subs, salads, sandwiches, wraps and desserts. One specialty item diners can try is the Fatoush salad which is Kneiher's personal addition.\n\n\"The fatoush does not come with a dressing, but has extra virgin olive oil mixed in, as well as a secret ingredient,\" he said. \"It's just a very healthy choice. It has veggies and an extra ingredient that we add to make it good,\"\n\nKneiher said he and the owners are \"very excited\" to see the restaurant become a reality. He said the fare will develop as time goes by.\n\n\"As for now, we like the menu the way it is, but there is always room for expanding.\"\n\n\n\nI am looking for:\nNews, Blogs & Events Web",

        "text":"19 million vegans in US, report claims\n\nAccording to a new report, the number of people who identify as vegan in the US may be up six times the number reported just three years ago to a huge 19 million.\n\nThe astronomical rise was reported in the Top Trends in Prepared Foods in 2017 report, compiled by market research group Global Data. It showed that six per cent of people in the US are now vegan versus just one percent three years ago. This would mean around 19 million people in the US are now vegan compared to three million in 2014.\n\nConsumers are changing their eating habits across the world. The report states that meat-free consumption is also becoming more popular in Germany. It shows 44 per cent of consumers follow a low-meat diet. In 2014 just 26 per cent of people considered themselves on a low-meat diet. More and more people are embracing flexitarian diets.\n\nDemand for ethical foods\n\nThe report found there to be a gradual shift occurring in response to health trends. It identified some key trends impacting innovation in prepared foods. One of these was the need to go meat-free due to the awareness of the impact that eating meat can have which is driving demand for alternative products. Another is the desire to eat ethically, with consumers connecting ethical and sustainable lifestyles with wellbeing and wellness. This is creating demand for more ethically-produced foods.\n\nThe report states: \u201cConsumers perceive an ethical and sustainable lifestyle to be an important part of their wellbeing and wellness, and prepared foods aligning with ethical and sustainable issues will appeal to many consumers.\u201d\n\nThe market is starting to react to this move to a plant-based diet. Recently Amazon bought WholeFoods for $13 billion and national fast food burger chain BurgerFi added a new vegan burger to its menu across 100+ stores.",

The name for the new hotel and restaurant has not yet been determined. Carrie Ann Salvi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite continued resistance by neighbors, the Baron\u2019s Cove Inn at 31 West Water Street in Sag Harbor will be allowed to proceed with renovations as proposed.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On Tuesday, the Sag Harbor Village Planning Board okayed the addition of an 87-seat second-level restaurant, a renovated reception area with an added bar and retail shop, and the addition of a pool-side cabana area with a concession stand. The decision was unanimous.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Neighbors had written to ask that further comment be allowed, but the board denied it on the advice of their counsel, Denise Schoen, who said the record had been open for a year to public comment and was now closed. Any more letters received would be kept in the file, she said, but could not be introduced in court should there be a lawsuit.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe have taken a lot of time, and a lot of testimony,\u201d said Neil Slevin, the board\u2019s chairman, after the board agreed with Ms. Schoen\u2019s recommendation.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Neighbors had most objected to the expansion of the lower-level lobby to include a bar with eight seats that would also service the upper-level restaurant, fearing that the open floor plan would draw a large, noisy crowd with attendant parking problems.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Timothy Platt, the village building inspector, supported the application, determining among other things that the bar could not be defined as such since its primary use was not to serve alcohol without food.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In September, having determined that the application did not pose a significant negative impact to the community, under the State Environmental Quality Review Act, the board had asked Mr. Platt to review the application for compliance with the building code and to address the neighbors concerns about the legality of the first-floor bar.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0After neighbors voiced concerns over the addition of the concession stand by the pool, again on the grounds of noise, the applicant, Curtis Bashaw, agreed not to sell alcohol there. Only hotel guests will be able to drink by the pool.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEvery contingency cannot be dealt with in advance,\u201d said Mr. Slevin. \u201cSometimes you have to say, if that comes up we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think the neighbors should be confident that their lives will not be affected,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not a bar . . . nobody will hear music after 9 p.m.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think the proposition with all of the restrictions is the best we could have done, within the law,\u201d said Jack Tagliasacchi, a board member who owns Il Capuccino restaurant.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Slevin appeared relieved following the approval. The application was \u201cas tricky and detailed to work out as Bulova,\u201d he said, speaking of the much larger Watchcase condominium project, with the same owner.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The resolution to approve, which still needs a few minor changes, includes about 30 different conditions, both voluntary and via covenants.",

In the meantime, here's Tanuki's message about their closing:\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Hi guys, we will be closed again tonight. I am very sorry and now you get a full explanation why.\n\nDear patrons, regulars, guests and fellow travelers on the path of J-punk oddity\n\nThank you for bearing with us as Tanuki adjusts to the repercussions of the media attention paid to us in the last few months.\u00a0\n\nYou see, Tanuki was never meant to be a conventional \u201crestaurant.\u201d In my self-indulgence I perhaps overestimated my ability to create something that was somewhat odd, my ability to make people understand this difficult-to-categorize thing, and my ability to hold the reins steady and stay on course-- even factoring in the human element of the outside world coming in through the door each day with their own notions of what this beast should be.\n\nBusinesses exist in a world of licenses, permits and regulations that have no love for the schemes of a person who does not care to be forced into a mold. For years I have tried to exist as a sake shop with tasty sake drinking food that did some other things as well and to comply with regulations that insist I choose to be a single easily categorizable thing. As we have received more and more reviews declaring us a restaurant, followed by restaurant customers with foodie expectations, this has become very difficult to do. And recently, as I begged a prominent local paper to not review us as a restaurant until we finished the updates necessary to comply with relevent regulations to no avail, it became impossible.\u00a0\n\nSo we've been shutting down abruptly when necessary and trying to adjust.\n\nAnd we were closed yesterday, and we will be closed again today trying to deal with a larger measure of conformity than I had planned.\u00a0\n\nThis is not a rant against the licensing bodies in the state of Oregon. While I disagree with many of the regulations and policies in place, I have been treated with respect, patience and kindness by all of the agents I have encountered. Nor is is meant to be a slur against the many writers and bloggers who have enjoyed their experiences here and shared their thoughts with the public. They have also been more than kind and I realise that many worthy chefs and restaurateurs would greatly appreciate and rightly deserve exactly the attention my little sake shop is given. I do not mean to sound ungrateful.\n\nI thank everyone who has tried to come in and found us closed for their patience with us. We are doing our best to meet expectations we never expected anyone to have of us while remaining within the boundaries of what we are legally allowed to do with our existing licenses, four tables and two electric hotplates. To those who have supported us for a long time now, taking us just as we are- you cannot be thanked enough.\u00a0\n\nSee you all soon,\u00a0\nJanis, Tanuki\n  \u2022 Currently 3.5\/5 Stars.\n  \u2022 1\n  \u2022 2\n  \u2022 3\n  \u2022 4\n  \u2022 5\ncomments powered by Disqus\n\nWeb Design for magazines",

It sounds like chooch, and one person will yell it after every course of food at the Oinkari Cider House Fundraiser on Saturday, June 16. When \u201ctxotx\u201d is yelled, everyone runs to the barrels filled with Basque hard cider, takes their glass, and raises it to add carbonation and toast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of primal and gritty because you go in with a fork and a steak knife, and in the Basque Country, sometimes they don\u2019t even give you plates,\u201d said Lael Uberuaga, president of the Oinkari Basque Dancers. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to try and make it a little more civilized and give everyone plates.\u201d\n\nThe evening\u2019s menu begins with two styles of cod, the first sauteed with peppers and onions, and the second, a cod omelet.\n\n\u201cIt sounds kind of strange but it\u2019s delicious,\" Uberuaga said.\n\nThe main course will include thick-cut steaks that will, yes, be served on plates.\n\nThe evening offers live and silent auctions, giving away a weekend in a cabin in Hagerman, a golf package and a Basque genealogy project to trace back your ancestry.\n\nMoney from the event will go to bringing a professional dance teacher from the Basque Country to the Oinkari dance group, as well as help cover operating costs for Boise State's Basque Studies Center.\n\nDan Ansotegui from local Basque band Amuma Says No will play at the fundraiser, and Uberuaga said to expect impromptu dancing.\n\n\u201cThis is the only authentic cider house experience that you\u2019ll get [in Boise],\u201d Uberuaga said. \u201cWe love to have some non-Basques and introduce them to our culture and have fun.\u201d\n\nThe fundraiser begins at 5:30 p.m. at the Basque Center. Tickets cost $50 per guest or $90 for a couple, but only 25 tickets remained as of this report. They can be purchased by emailing, or if you're feeling lucky, at the door.\n\nTags: , , ,\n\nPin It\n\n\nComments are closed.\n\nJoin the conversation at\nor send letters to\n\n\u00a9 2017 Boise Weekly\n\nWebsite powered by Foundation",
