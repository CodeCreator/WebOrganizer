Minsk and Rebekah N. Plowman\n\nRecently, the United States Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General entered into a Settlement Agreement with a medical drug company that caught our eye because of the reference to the Open Payments Program, i.e., the Sunshine Act. While the Settlement\u2019s focus is on the company\u2019s violation of the Anti-Kickback and False Claims Act statutes, this is the first time, of which we are aware, that the government is enforcing the Sunshine Act requirements.

Wirth\n\nAs Coronavirus cases continue to spike all over the country, two vaccine companies have announced promising early results for their respective products. On November 9, 2020, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE announced that their vaccine candidate against COVID-19 was \u201cfound to be more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 in participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection . . . \u201c At the same time, they also announced that a submission for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Food and Drug Administration was planned for after \u201cthe required safety milestone is achieved, which is currently expected to occur in the third week of November.\u201d Only a week after Pfizer\u2019s announcement, Moderna, Inc. also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine met its primary efficacy endpoint in the first Interim Analysis of the Phase 3 study data, showing that the vaccine is 94.5% effective. The company noted in its press release that it intended to submit for an EUA with FDA in the coming weeks and that it \u201cexpects the EUA to be based on the final analysis of 151 cases and a median follow-up of more than 2 months.\u201d More >\n\nThe OIG Says There is No Such Thing as a Free Meal\nBy: Alan G. Minsk, Rebekah N. Plowman and Mary Grace Griffin\n\nOn November 16, 2020, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health Human Services issued a Special Fraud Alert: Speaker Programs (\u201cAlert\u201d), highlighting the fraud and abuse risks associated with speaker programs sponsored by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. To use its own word, the OIG is \u201cskeptical\u201d of the value of many speaker programs, which it believes may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) by paying \u201csubstantial remuneration\u201d to health care providers (HCPs) that are designed to encourage the HCPs to prescribe or use the sponsoring-company\u2019s products, not because the products may benefit specific patients, but rather merely because they are paid.

These clients also may be interested in substantiating claims they currently make for products that include the ingredient or for making new claims. Other times, clients are just beginning the process of introducing an ingredient to the market and are looking for guidance concerning the early stages of product development, including any studies they might require. However, these clients are sometimes surprised to learn that studying an ingredient as a drug may have already precluded it from being lawfully included in a food or product labeled as a \u201cdietary supplement\u201d under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). Two separate sections of the Act works to prohibit the use of a substance in a food, including dietary supplements, if certain circumstances are met.

Minsk, Adriaen M. Morse Jr., Rebekah N. Plowman, and John P. Rowley III\n\nAs all signs point to Joe Biden becoming the 46th President of the United States, AGG has begun considering the likely shifts in white collar enforcement from the Trump Administration to a Biden Administration. Every administration brings its own priorities to enforcement, with the Trump Administration focusing more on immigration and corporate espionage cases, while conventional wisdom holds that Democratic administrations emphasize white collar enforcement and a more active regulatory environment. We anticipate that a Biden Administration will actively renew and initiate criminal and enforcement investigations in a number of areas where the Trump Administration was not as active.
