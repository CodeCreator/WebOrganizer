The system booted ok. Everything seemed fine, when I looked at my system information it showed that the 8GB of RAM were running at 1333Mhz. Then I rebooted my MBP and started Apple Hardware Test. First test passed fine, but during the 2nd test I got this error: \"4MEM\/64\/40000000 0x84486198\". Then I turned off power, when i turned it on again, I've got a black screen with 3 beeps and 3 front led flashes. I tried to swap memory modules with no success. When I inserted the original memory back system booted up as usual without any problems. After that I reseted PRAM and NVRAM, reinstalled the new memory and I got 3 beeps again. Any suggestions please?\n\nAnswered! View the answer I have this problem too\n\nIs this a good question?\n\nScore 1\nAdd a comment\n\n1 Answer\n\nChosen Solution\n\nYou have bad ram. The 3 beeps signifies that there is defective ram in your unit. You should contact Apple and ask for a replacement or a refund and then buy ram from another store like OWC or Crucial because they are much cheeper and have never come defective when I ordered them.\n\nHope this Helps\n\nWas this answer helpful?\n\nScore 2\n\n\nThank you for the answer. I still can't belive that $200 \"guaranteed to be compatible with your Macintosh\" Apple memory is crap. I thought for this price it could be well tested. By the way, the faulty memory is Hynyx branded. On Monday I am going to call Apple and ask for replacement.\n\n\nThat is why I only buy memory from OWC or Crucial. It is roughly half the price and has never disappointed me.\n\n\nToday I received the memory replacement. Everything seems to be fine.\n\n\nAdd a comment\n\nAdd your answer\n\naein aeinner will be eternally grateful.\nView Statistics:\n\nPast 24 Hours: 0\n\nPast 7 Days: 2\n\nPast 30 Days: 13\n\nAll Time: 1,399",

        "text":"I just bought an Arduino Uno (SMD version) from W11Stop and want to know whether there is any other difference between Arduino UNO DIP and Arduino UNO SMD besides knowing that the SMD version doesn't have a DIP chip which can be replaced?\n\nI am just a beginner so please help me if I am wrong!\n\n  \u2022 Afaik, the SMD version actually has two extra analog pins. But they may not be accessible on your Arduino board (ADC6 & ADC7). The PDIP has 28pins TQFP has 32 pins (check the datasheet). But the internals should be the same by design. \u2013\u00a0Paul Sep 9 '17 at 10:41\n\nAs far as I know there is no real difference, at least not directly related to the SMD.\n\nThere are many clones which sometimes have slightly different behavior or protection.\n\nBut for the SMD the only disadvantage is it cannot (easily) be replaced.\n\nI have one original one (with DIP) and several clones and so far I did not found any difference, except for having mini USB instead of normal USB.\n\n  \u2022 mini USB instead of USB-B is just a chinese version of it. Many clones of Arduino bought from china have either MINI, MICRO or B-type usb port, you can actually choose. But none original(UNO) has ever had a mini USB on it. \u2013\u00a0Jakey Apr 8 '18 at 14:17\n\nActually, there are no different on the functionality. But you may can't go through some features, because the ATmega can be remove it manually without any special tools. One of the useful case as ArduinoISP for burning bootloader to another ATmega328p AVR.\n\nFor personal suggestion, you just needed one piece of PDIP\/DIP version UNO, others boards you can consider the lower cost, such as Nano, Pro Mini(Without USB-to-TTL), UNO(SMD).\n\nFor the USB-to-TTL, there are many options in the market, watch this video to explain what are they different.\n\n\nThere's no actual difference, but just the \"look\". Neither version of it should bother you at anything, but there are 2 things, worth mentioning.\n\n  1. The IC can fall out of DIP socket: I've been told a few times this already, but never had experienced such behaviour or been at occasion, where that happened. So here's a disadvantage for DIP cases.\n\n  2. DIP has also possibility of changing waaaaaaaaaay easier the microprocessor in case of failure. You simply grab it off (even might with a help of a screwdriver) and you're ready to put in a new one. So this is an advantage nr. 1. I also like to use an Arduino in projects, but not the whole board. I just take the IC (atmega328) and use 2 ceramic caps with 16MHz quartz and I've got my own arduino on other PCB - in this case, you can use Arduino UNO board as a programmer. This is how to avoid installing FTDI or CH340 chip on other boards. Advantage nr. 2.\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Each Brother laser printer is designed to work at pre-set temperatures that are matched exactly to each of our individual toner formulations. Each individual component is designed to work with the other to ensure quality and reliability. Using non-Brother supplies may affect the hardware performance, print quality and machine reliability.\nThe Brotherlimited warranty does not apply to any problem that is caused by the useof unauthorized third party drum units, toner cartridges or toner.\n\n1. First, power OFF the unit for safety. The ON\/OFF switch is located on the left, rear side of the unit.\n\n2. Open the scanner cover by pulling the blue lever located below the control panel toward you and lifting the cover. Make sure the cover is completely open.\n\n3. Remove the drum unit by holding each side of the drum by its handles and gently lifting the drum forward (toward) you.\n\n4. Place the drum unit on a drop cloth or large piece of disposablepaper to avoid spilling and scattering the toner. Make sure thedirections and DR-250 stickers are facing you.\n\n5. With the drum removed from the Brother machine, clean the laser glass. The laser glass is located inside the Brother machine where the drum was located. It is a piece of glass, about 1\/2 inch wide and approximately 8 inches long, located on the bottom of the inside. Gently wipe the glass with a clean soft DRY cloth. DO NOT use isopropyl alcoholor any liquid to clean the glass.\n\n6. Gently pull up on the mauve lever to turn the toner cartridge toward you until it stops. Remove the toner cartridge from the drum unit by gently sliding it out of the drum unit. ***Handle the toner cartridge carefully. If toner scatters on your hands or clothes, immediately wipe it off or wash it with cold water.\n\n7. Gently rock the toner cartridge from side to side five or six times to distribute the toner evenly inside the cartridge. Then, reset the toner into the drum (be sure it clicks into place). Gently push on the mauve lever to turn the toner cartridge away from you until it stops.\n\n8. With the DR-250 sticker facing you turn the drum upside down. There is a blue tab located on the right side. Slide the blue tab back and forth seven times to clean the corona wire. When finished, make sure the blue tab is locked to the right side of the drum.\n\n9. Reset drum unit in Brother machine. Close the cover securely.\n\nPrint the help list to test the unit by pressing the REPORTS key located on the control panel and then (1) on the dial pad.\n\nIf the white vertical lines still continue, the drum unit will need to\nbe replaced.\n\nIf the purchase date of the original drum or replacement drum is less than 90 days (within the warranty of the drum), contact Brother Customer Service Center at 1-877-Brother (1-877-276-8437) . The center is open Monday-Friday, 9:00am to 7:00 pm EST, excluding holidays.\n\nPosted on Dec 27, 2007\n\n\nSOURCE: Connecting Brother MFC 7420 thru Dlink DP301P Print Server to home network with ONLY dynamic addressing\n\ndo you know how to network a 7420 fax ?\n\nPosted on Jul 11, 2008\n\n  \u2022 1 Answer\n\n\n\n\nPosted on Nov 25, 2008\n\n  \u2022 1 Answer\n\nSOURCE: HP Deskjet F2180 Margins incorrect for label printing\n\nI eventually managed to print my labels one sheet at a time by forcing the label top edge down the page.

Change the dial and you get different settings for forms, checks, invoices, reports. A-F.\nPerf Skip just skips over the perforation where the pages are perferated. Enhanced means its double strike vs Draft mode.\nThese settings tell me you are printing compressed print (CPI=16) on wide paper (green bar) cuz RM=220 right margin is 220. For 8.5x11 paper 132 is the correct margin with at 16cpi. or 80 for 10cpi. Clearly you have the wrong paper in here if you print off the page. You must have 8.5 x 11 or 11 x 8.5.\nHost allows the computer to change the settings on the fly. That may be why it goes off the page later. (Or it could be a carriage jam that makes it think its at space 1 when it isn't.)\nI don't know what you are trying to print so I can't help you. I can tell you that having right margin on 220 is why its printing off the page.\nYou can change the dial to preset draft 16 and print a menu for those setting or you can change the RM to 132 or 80 by using the command, menu, change and accept keys.\nIts been 10 years or so for me but take the printer off line by pushing the on-line button, press command, press menu and it will print all the settings like you have done. It will then print whatever the first item you can change is, press accept and keep accepting until you get to RM=220 then press change. It should print 80 or some number, press change until you get to 132 then press accept. Press accept until you get to the end. Press Normal and on line.\nIf you change the print size from 16 to 12, or 10 you will need to change the RM to the correct width.\nCan't find a manual online for you. I probably thru away 200 of them in 2007 when PCS closed. It would show you what the choices are for each setting.

Printing is OK but spacing is no good for the binding when the pages are cut in two. What instructions should I give the printer to allow...\n\n\nBy spacing, I assume you mean the margins at the centre.\n\nThe default margin settings are not the same for the right and left hand side of the page, so the printing on the reverse side is offset from the printing on the first side.\n\nThe right margin is always wider to allow for punch holes in file paper.\n\nIt is not the printer settings you need to adjust, it is the page layout of your word processing software.\n\nAdjust the margin settings manually. In MS Office 2007:\n\nPage Layout > Margins > Mirrored Margins.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nAug 24, 2011 | Canon PIXMA MP610 InkJet Printer\n\n2 Answers\n\nOn my Laserjet 3015, in Microsoft Word, if I set top, bottom, left, and right margins to 1\", on the printed page, the margins print as Top 1\", Left 15\/16\", Right 1-1\/8\", and Bottom...\n\nThe default paper selection\/ size in MS Word is 'letter'. you may have designed the document on letter size and while printing you have A4 size paper in the printer.\nSo, Make sure that you design the document on the same paper size (such as A4, which is commonly used). Secondly, while printing don't print the document directly. From the Print dialogue option choose the exact paper size and un-check (de-select) any option of paper resizing (if available). You will have the documents printed exactly as designed.\n\nLet me know if any further clarification\/ assistance is required.\n\nHope it helps! Good Luck!

Regards\n\nSnow Leopard has a bunch of drivers built in to control various printers. \u00a0If it doesn't recognize the printer, then you will have to go on Agfa's web site to see if they have a printer driver compatible with Snow Leopard. \u00a0Keep in mind that Snow Leopard is a new OS and that printer manufacturers will take some time to update their programs and drivers to run on it. \u00a0If you don't find a driver then, you got to use a different printer or downgrade your OS to one that will run the printer.\n\nNov 06, 2009 | Agfa SnapScan E25 Flatbed Scanner\n\n1 Answer\n\nAgfa snapscan 310\n\nI have misplaced my scanner drivers CD and i need to install it on a new computer can you please help me download a free scanner drivers for my Agfa snapscan 310?\n\nMar 03, 2008 | Agfa SnapScan 310 EPP Flatbed Scanner\n\n1 Answer\n\nHardware problem\n\nDid you apply the lock in the move?

I have never encountered the problem you have. I have looked into some other sites and noticed a number if CLI-8 cartridges being replaced by Canon. I think there are only 2 probable problem areas, he cartridge or the software you are using. I suggest you call up Canon and complain about this problem. Seems like you got the printer 6 months or so ago. You should able to get to do something like replace the printer or cartridges. I'm assuming that you don't refill or have your cartridges refilled so the contact points should not be messy w\/ ink. You can try cleaning the contact points on the cartridges and printer. But I'd call Canon and explain to them the situation and see if they can solve your problem. Solve I'm implying is to replace your cartridges or printer. Let me know if this helps.\n\nJul 22, 2008 | Canon PIXMA MP460 All-In-One InkJet...\n\n2 Answers\n\nI have a new Canon Pixma printer. Every time I replace an ink cartridge, the printer all of a sudden won't recognize the cartridge. After I clean the nozzles and play with it, it recognizes the new...\n\nI spoke with Canon and they said the PIXMA 620 does not accept refilled cartridges. Occasionally they work without a problem but you should buy a new cartridge each time. I spoke with an authorized Canon repair company and the technician said that the thickness of the ink in the refills is thinner and can ruin the printhead so even if it does recognize the cartridge, refilled cartridges will ruin printhead and are a bad idea. Canon needs to become more ecologically and economically viable if you ask me!\n\nJun 10, 2008 | Office Equipment & Supplies\n\n2 Answers\n\nInk cartridge problem\n\nSolution: Snap in ink tanks properly MP500\n\nInk Tank Seated Properly Refer to the following steps to verify the ink tanks are seated correctly:\n  1.

OpenCL support is built into the graphics driver from Intel. I also have a discrete GPU -- AMD HD 7970 supporting OpenCL, this support also implemented in a driver (this time AMD's).\n\n\nThe problem is that after I install the AMD's driver Intel's GPU is no longer accessible via OpenCL. There are two OpenCL platforms present in the system, but the Intel's one only sees CPU (AMD's sees both CPU and GPU). Before the installation of the AMD driver Intel's platform sees two devices: the CPU and HD Graphics 4000.\n\n\nIs it a known issue?",

        "text":"Solar charger with power plug input?\n\nI love all the solar pieces on instructables, but I was wondering if you can make a solar charged device with a power plug input in it so anything can be plugged in such as a phone charger without having to dedicate the solar charger to one item by ripping up an existing phone charger. Thanks\n\narnold547 years ago\nI bought a 15 watt solar panel that came with three optional connectors. One for 12v battery connection, one with a bare wire connection, and one with a male end plug for a cigarette lighter socket. I ended up switching out the male end plug with a trailer connector that had a 12v female socket. Now I can use my panel by plugging 12v DC accessories directly into the 12v female socket -- as long as they all have the male end connectors. Works great as long as the appliances have wattage lower than the 15 watt solar panel. I have recharged my cell phone, used a 10 watt fan, LED lights, and battery charger to recharge AAA\/AA batteries. Hope this helps.",
