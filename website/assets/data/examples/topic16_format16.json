A little pit pony named Bobbit is the catalyst bringing the two young people a chance to lead new lives filled with promise, despite heavy odds they must both overcome. Prepare yourself for the cruelty and hopelessness for both man and beast accompanying work in coal mines. Brace yourself to meet a vibrant active young woman who suddenly becomes a paraplegic. Find out how a small pony from the mines can help two struggling young people regain the balance that must exist for them to carry on.\n\nAuthor : Sally Sutherland\n\nA lifelong animal enthusiast, Sally Sutherland's interests have often centered upon reading and writing about horses. And as a child, she used to study and draw them endlessly. Sally has bred, trained, and shown horses in several disciplines, including driving, which is now her favorite. She has written driving articles for the Virginia Horse Journal. A health teacher for 27 years gave Sally insight into diseases like polio, or infantile paralysis, that swept parts of America during the late l940s and 1950s. Polio was of special interest to Sally as she has a cousin, who, as a young girl, was afflicted by the disease. After reading about how brutal life was for coal miners and the pit ponies working underground most of their lives, pulling heavy carts of coal out of the mines. Sally combined the two and came up with an idea to show how people must strive to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds in their lives?and the story of A Pit Pony Named Bobbit was born.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nWeight 0.62 lbs\n\n\nThere are no reviews yet.\n\nBe the first to review \u201cA Pit Pony Named Bobbit\u201d\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Lara abandoned her lands and people for love of him.\u00a0 She adopted his ways and learned of his tribe. Together they have faced plague and insurgency -- and despite these struggles, they have known happiness and joy.\nNow they face their most arduous task: Keir must take Lara into the Heart of the Plains, and introduce her as the Warprize to the warrior-priests.\u00a0 She must be tested--questioned, examined, watched--and must find favor with the warrior-priests and the tribe's elders before they will confirm her as a true Warprize.\nBut in Lara's heart there are doubts--for what if she is found wanting? Will Keir give up everything he knows to be with his Warprize?\n\nAt the publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software (DRM) applied.\n\n\nAbout Elizabeth Vaughan\n\nSee more books from this Author\nElizabeth A.
