        "text":"UCLA acquires major collection chronicling Sephardic Jewish past in L.A.\n\nUniversity of California Los Angeles's picture\nPrinter-friendly versionPrinter-friendly version\n\n\nThe Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel archive includes a symbolic key from the 1932 dedication of the temple in L.A.\n\nThe UCLA Sephardic Archive has acquired one of the most significant collections ever assembled chronicling Los Angeles Sephardic Jewish history. The materials tell of the migration of Sephardic Jews to California from the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa at the turn of the 20th century; the shaping of Sephardic culture in Los Angeles; and Sephardic Jews\u2019 contributions to the Jewish and urban fabric of L.A.\n\nMarking its first major acquisition, the archive partnered with UCLA Library Special Collections to acquire the Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel (STTI) archive, which includes a rich trove of photographs, papers, audiovisual materials and rare books dating to the mid-19th century. Many are written in the endangered language of Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), the language of Mediterranean Jews descended from the medieval exiles from Iberia.\n\nLaunched in 2016, UCLA\u2019s Sephardic Archive is the first of its kind in the U.S. and aims to be one of the world\u2019s largest collections \u2014 as yet unseen \u2014 of Sephardic Jewish life. An early focus will be on the local Ladino-speaking community, whose immigrant pioneers came to L.A. from modern-day Turkey and the Balkans in the early 20th century. The archive will then be expanded to include L.A.\u2019s North African, Persian and other Middle Eastern Jewish communities.\n\n\u201cUCLA is the ideal institution to safeguard and steward a collection of such enormous significance,\u201d said Sarah Abrevaya Stein, director of the archive, a professor of history and holder of the Maurice Amado Chair in Sephardic Studies. \u201cWe are in L.A., which is home to one of the oldest and largest Sephardic communities in the country, and we have the world-class resources to pioneer a comprehensive and invaluable archive of Sephardic culture.\n\nMost archives and libraries dedicated to preserving documents and objects of the Jewish past have focused on European Jewish histories. In contrast, UCLA\u2019s archive will span the southern Mediterranean and Middle East. Made possible by a lead gift from the Sady Kahn Foundation with additional support from the UCLA Alan D. Leve Center for Jewish Studies Community Advisory Board and the Maurice Amado Foundation, the archive complements UCLA\u2019s unparalleled academic expertise and course offerings related to the study of Sephardic Jewish history.\n\nChris Silver, UCLA doctoral student in Jewish history and the archive\u2019s project manager, said that the recent acquisition of the STTI archive would launch UCLA\u2019s efforts in the most meaningful way, given its connection to the local community (the temple is located on Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood). The STTI archive was created in 1981 and stewarded by Maurice I. \u201cBob\u201d Hattem, a descendant of one of the earliest founders of the Sephardi communidad in L.A.\n\nThe diverse collection includes institutional records, research papers, newsletters, pamphlets, scrapbooks and newspaper clippings. The archive also possesses an impressive audiovisual collection of reel-to-reel, cassette and VHS tapes.\n\nAccording to Stein, time is of the essence. \u201cMaterials held in these collections can be acutely vulnerable and at risk of being lost forever \u2014 often languishing in garages and other facilities ill-equipped for preservation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is imperative to collect, preserve and make them available for scholars and members of the community.\u201d\n\nThe UCLA Sephardic Archive hopes to reverse the historic neglect of these primary source materials.\n\nMichael Hattem, son of Bob Hattem and member of STTI and the archive\u2019s community advisory board, said, \u201cThe partnership between STTI and UCLA will keep the rich heritage of Sephardim alive for generations to come.\u201d\n\nAfter gathering and cataloguing the materials, Stein and her researchers plan to create a visually rich and historically informative interactive exhibit available online to users all over the world. The digital exhibit will be accompanied by a temporary physical exhibit at the Sephardic Temple featuring items drawn from the archive and marking the community\u2019s centenary anniversary. Finally, the archive will serve as a research resource for UCLA graduate students who are working dissertations on related topics, and for community members interested in learning more about their past.\n\nTo learn more,\u00a0go to the archive\u2019s\u00a0webpage.

The size 2017.09.18 Mt Baker Arch Stylesand style of these residences vary within the district, with the larger estate-like houses on the ridge overlooking Lake Washington to the east and smaller-scale one to two story residences throughout the rest of the neighborhood. Eclectic, yet well-designed residences are a hallmark of the neighborhood. The neighborhood predominantly features architecture from the revival periods and American movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a smattering of designs from the modern movement. Styles present throughout the neighborhood include: American Foursquare, Colonial Revival, Craftsman, Minimal Traditional, Neoclassical, Ranch, Tudor Revival, Swiss Chalet, Mission Revival, and Spanish Eclectic. Colonial Revival and Craftsman are the predominant architectural styles in the neighborhood.\n\nVictor Steinbrueck and Folke Nyberg noted that the Mt. Baker district is \u201cone of Seattle\u2019s earliest planned residential communities, and as such, was an experiment in residential ArchitecturalStylesdevelopment, its present physical character is largely a result of that effort.\u201d\u00a0 This unique example of early planning \u201csuccessfully integrated street and residential developments into the natural amenities of the area.\u00a0 It is one of the best local examples of the English or \u2018picturesque\u2019 type of landscape planning.\u201d\u00a0 Mount Baker: An Inventory of Buildings and Urban Design Resources (Folke Nyberg \/ Victor Steinbrueck).\n\nOlmsted and Schwageral.\u00a0 The project has also clarified how the neighborhood connects to the Olmsted Brother\u2019s system of parks and parkways.\u00a0 Although the Olmsted Brothers are often mistakenly identified as the landscape architects of Mount Baker Park and the Mount Baker Park Addition, the Hunter Tract Improvement Company hired landscape architect and former Seattle Parks Superintendent Edward O. Schwagerl (1842-1910).\n\nSchwagerl trained as a landscape architect, and spent a portion of his career working with public parks. He served as Parks Superintendent for the City of Tacoma between 1890 and 1892 and for the City of Seattle between 1892 and 1895. While working for the City of Tacoma, Schwagerl was responsible for the design of Wright Park and worked on the city\u2019s massive Point Defiance Park. In Seattle, he completed design work on Kinnear Park and Denny Park. He also prepared a comprehensive plan for Seattle Parks, influenced by 2017.09.16 Mt Baker Park 1908 Layoutthe work of Frederick Law Olmsted, often considered the father of American landscape architecture. With his plan for Seattle parks, Schwagerl called for the development of four parks connected by scenic, park-like boulevards. Timing and resources were not on Schwagerl\u2019s side; the financial depression of 1893 tabled his idea and Schwagerl left his position as Parks Superintendent in 1895. He worked in Tacoma, then Seattle, in private practice for the next several years designing residential landscapes and real estate subdivisions. During this time, Schwagerl worked for Puget Sound University and the University Land Company to design the university campus and surrounding subdivisions, plans which never reached fruition.\n\nSurprisingly, Schwagerl\u2019s concept was not abandoned. The Klondike Gold Rush turned Seattle\u2019s fortunes around and the city was soon booming. The City of Seattle hired the Olmsted Brothers\u2014Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., and John C. Olmsted, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted\u2014to design a comprehensive plan for Seattle parks. Completed in 1903, this plan also proposed a series of park-like boulevards to run throughout the city, connecting its parks. When the Hunter Tract Company hired Schwagerl to work with Cotterill & Whitworth to design the Mount Baker Park Addition in Seattle, he received the opportunity to design a portion of his earlier vision. As part of the subdivision, Schwagerl and Cotterill & Whitworth designed Mount Baker Park, S Mount Baker Boulevard, and Hunter Boulevard S, elements which beautify the neighborhood and enhance its character.\n\nThe connecting function of our Boulevard System will soon be enhanced with the City\u2019s Accessible Mount Baker Project, which will calm traffic and reconnect Franklin High School and the western edge of the historic neighborhood to the emerging Mount Baker Town Center with a dedicated route for both bicycles and pedestrians.\u00a0 This route will connect with the Mount Baker Link station, and also with Beacon Hill via Cheasty Boulevard.\u00a0 \u00a0The anticipated re-connection of the Mount Baker Park Addition to the recently upzoned and emerging Mount Baker Town Center represents a unique opportunity in urban planning.\u00a0 Rather than dividing a community, the Boulevard re-connection provides an opportunity to harmonize a new dense Hub Urban Village on the relatively undeveloped blocks surrounding the Link station area with\n\nNorth Rainier Neighborhood Plan Vision\n\nNorth Rainier Neighborhood Plan\n\nan existing and historically remarkable community that has retained amazing architectural integrity for a century.\u00a0 \u00a0During the extensive outreach leading to the North Rainier Neighborhood Plan, a broad range of stakeholders came together and called on the City to recognize the area north and east of Franklin High School\u00a0 as an important resource, while promoting high-density residential and transit-oriented development in the vacant spaces surrounding the station area.\u00a0 \u00a0Consistent with this plan, the Friends of Mount Baker Town Center has advocated in support of amenities to reclaim the Olmsted legacy by reconnecting Mount Baker and Cheasty Boulevard in a pedestrian friendly manner, and bridging Southeast Seattle\u2019s worst open space gap \u2014 in the heart of a Town Center where high density is being focused.\u00a0 \u00a0These community values in livability and equity are now reflected in the Accessible Mount Baker plan and the City\u2019s proposed acquisition of land for the missing North Rainier Town Center Park and neighborhood playground.\n\nA Story Of Civil Rights:\u00a0\u00a0Our 4Culture supported project has gone far beyond architecture and landscape design.\u00a0 \u00a0Integrated in the report are timely and inspiring stories of advocacy and the struggle to overcome exclusivity and work towards equity and civil rights.\n\nThe Fight Against Exclusivity.\u00a0\u00a0During the 1910s, the neighborhood experienced the first cracks in its rigid stance on exclusivity. In addition to the restrictive covenants attached to the deeds, there was also an assumption that the Hunter Tract Improvement Company would not approve sales to \u201cundesirable\u201d races. Two lawsuits were filed in 1910 which challenged these racist actions. First, the Hunter Tract Improvement Company filed a lawsuit against Samu... (truncated)",

In Scotland and the North of England, the scold\u2019s bridle was generally known as the \u2018branks\u2019. \u00a0\n\nTwo bridles were purchased for use by the Walsall town authorities during the seventeenth century. \u00a0However it is not clear what later happened to either of them. \u00a0\n\nThe bridle on display today in Walsall Museum was actually acquired by the Museum in the 1960s from a local historian who said he had found it on a scrap heap in Brownhills!\n\nThe talk will take place from 2-3 pm and is free of charge, but places are limited so seats must be reserved in advance.\n\nContact us\n\nFor further information or to book your places for the talk, please contact Walsall Museum\n\nTelephone 01922 653116\n\n\nOr pop into the Museum in person.",

This is the true story of an eager Deputy Sherriff who went to do the right thing but got himself into the largest shootout in Alexandria County history. Armed with tenuous laws and the tacit backing of newly elected Sheriff Palmer, on a cold night in February 1896, Deputy Sheriff Edward Deuterman formed a posse with a friend and eight local black men to raid a gambling saloon run by the all too well-known John C. Nelson. What was supposed to be a quick raid, instead ended in a hail of gunfire. Deuterman and his friend would come to near death from their wounds, one in his posse would be killed and four others wounded. The raid became the catalyst for a long and drawn out war against vice in Alexandria County which took nearly a dozen years to win.\n\nThis program is free and open to the public.

As a dig worker, Scher learned how to carefully uncover features and objects, how they are catalogued and analyzed in the laboratory, and how to walk a full wheelbarrow over a wooden plank!\n\n\u201cArchaeology is not like the Indiana Jones movies\u2014there\u2019s a lot of time spent slowly brushing dirt, sifting it, and shoveling it into wheelbarrows. You get sweaty and grimy and very unglamorous, getting up early and getting to bed late,\u201d said Scher. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s worth it, especially when you find something spectacular\u2014which our unit did.\u201d\n\nThe last week of the field school, they unearthed the tomb of a high-status Moche woman\u2014called a priestess. She was buried in a chamber tomb with a wooden-beam roof, along with many ceramics and copper ornaments. Her casket had been covered with a textile with copper ornaments sewn to it, and a bird-shaped headdress ornament, as well as a silver cup and dish were found.\n\nThis is the 12th Priestess found at the site in 20 years of digging, and further cements San Jos\u00e9 de Moro\u2019s unique place in Moche archaeology\u2014a site where there is a multi-generational tradition of high-status women in power. This is different from other Moche sites throughout north coastal Peru, where men appear to have been in charge of the sociopolitical system.\n\nThe discovery was big news, and the press showed up to photograph the tomb and talk to Scher\u2019s unit chief, Julio Salda\u00f1a, an archaeology student at the Catholic University of Peru. Scher brought this experience beck to her classroom with pictures as well as stories to teach her students about the methods of archaeology and knowledge is gleaned from the past.\n\nTo read more about the priestess, go to the \u201cNational Geographic\u201d website at\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

Custer.\u00a0 Mr. Singer practiced defense law in New York City for forty-four years and was also a case worker in the City\u2019s Department of Welfare.\u00a0 He was a former agent with the U.S. Treasury Department, Intelligence Division.\u00a0 He has written articles for Newsday newspaper in Queens, New York.\u00a0 Mr. Singer taught penology at St. Johns University and is currently teaching trial two days per week at the Public Defender\u2019s Office in West Palm Beach.\u00a0 He lectures on historical subjects and criminal law.\n\nWednesday, August 8, 2012 Program\n\nRodney Dillon, an original founder of the Round Table who has served as both President and Vice President of the Round Table, kicked off our 25th anniversary celebration with Bringing the Civil War to Palm Beach County.\u00a0 Rodney was for many years the Administrator of the Broward Historical Commission.\u00a0 He teaches history at Palm Beach State College and has a book store called \"Past Perfect Florida History.\"\u00a0 Please visit his website at: www.past-perfect-history-book.com.\n\n[Note: your editor has taken liberties with this unscripted talk]\u00a0 This year marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Civil War Roundtable of Palm Beach County and the 151st anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War and secession by the State of Florida.\u00a0 At the time, there was no Palm Beach County and few settlers in its boundaries.\u00a0 Our first permanent white settler was August Lay, a deserter, who dug the Palm Beach Inlet by hand.\u00a0 What became Palm Beach County already had a Civil War relationship: Joseph Johnston, William Sherman, and George Thomas had all been stationed here.\u00a0 As an offshoot of the Seminole Wars, we have Military Trail, laid out by Robert Anderson (of Ft. Sumter fame).\u00a0 Robert E. Lee conducted a coastal survey in 1849.\u00a0 Jupiter Lighthouse (designed by Gen. George Meade), built in 1855-59, is the oldest building in the county.\u00a0 When the war began in earnest, pro Confederate citizens removed and hid its lights to help the blockade runners and hamper the Federal ships seeking to enforce the blockade.\n\nWorth\"The first white settlers in Palm Beach County lived around 22-mile-long Lake Worth, then an enclosed freshwater lake, named for Colonel William Jenkins Worth, who helped to end the Second Seminole War in Florida in 1842.\n\nDuring the pioneer era, the entire area was known as Lake Worth [after Col. William Jenkins Worth, the last commander of U. S. forces in Florida]; the town by that name would not exist until 1912.\u00a0 The first arrivals made their homes on Hypoluxo Island, near the south end of Lake Worth, and on the east side of the lake, now Palm Beach.\u00a0 Although the Palm Beach homesteads stretched from the lake to the ocean, most settlers built not on the oceanfront but on the lake.\u00a0 The middle of the island, and their property, was a swamp full of alligators and mosquitoes. The white settlers laid planks across it to make their way to the ocean, which they used for bathing and fishing.\u00a0 The Seminole Indians before them did not live on the barrier island, but rather inland.\" [Palm Beach History Online]\n\n\nWoodlawnMany of the original settlers were Civil War veterans, mostly Confederates.\u00a0 After Henry Flagler built his railroad in the 1890s and opened up Florida, many Civil War veterans, now middle-aged or seeking to retire, moved here.\u00a0 Nathan S. Boynton and William S. Linton, Michigan residents and Union Army officers in the Civil War, arrived in 1894.\u00a0 Beginning in 1910, the State tried to drain the Everglades.\u00a0 The 20's brought the first Real Estate Boom.\u00a0 Settlers drove down here in Dixie Highway.\u00a0 Children of the Civil War veterans were born, grew up and lived here.\u00a0 They celebrated Confederate Memorial Day (the 4th Monday in April).\u00a0 In 1941 the United Daughters of the Confederacy installed a Confederate war memorial Woodlawn Cemetery.\u00a0 It has a Confederate flag and an inscription that reads:\n\n\n\n\"Forever now, among the immortal dead,\nwhere dust belongs to glory's dreamland,\nsleeps the fair Confederacy.\nRight principles can never die,\nno cause for which the brave have bled\nin virtues name, for which the true\nhave kept the faith, for which the dead\n\u00a0have died in holy martyrdom, was ever lost!\"\n\nIn the 1980's, the late Bob Godwin, a relative of Robert Shaara, author of Killer Angels and fascinated by James Longstreet and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, contacted the Civil War Times magazine and obtained its subscription list for Palm Beach County.\u00a0 This was an extremely difficult to accomplish but Bob was an extremely persuasive fellow.\u00a0 Bob used the list to dig up phone numbers and called people.\u00a0 Rodney met Bob in Jacksonville where Rodney gave a talk.\u00a0 The first meeting of the Roundtable was held on September 16, 1987 in a classroom in John I. Leonard High School.\u00a0 The first attendees were: Rodney Dillon, Bob Godwin, Joel Gordon and Greg Parkinson.\u00a0 These men decided to form the \"Civil War Round Table of Palm Beach County.\"\u00a0 On October 4, Steve Carr joined the group, which elected Bob Godwin President and Rodney Dillon Vice President.\u00a0 There was no agenda: discussion was informal and talks naturally followed.\u00a0 The attendance grew slowly: 9 on November 11, 1987, 7 on January 13, 1988, 11 on February 10, 12 on March 9, 1988, at which meeting we welcomed our first female members, Judy Bennett and Wilma Roberts.\u00a0 By May 1988 the group had grown to 14, including Rebecca Williams and Pauline Nott.\u00a0 Our President, Gerridine LaRovere, along with Lowell Tyler, joined the group on June 8, 1988.\n\nOn our first anniversary, September 7, 1988, 21 men and one woman were in attendance. At this meeting, the group decided to request a voluntary donation of $1.00 per person per meeting.\u00a0 The slogan, \"Haversacks and Saddlebags,\" was adopted.\u00a0 In 1989, dues of $15.00 per year, single or couple, were adopted and $120 was collected, along with $7 from Elden E. Billings, of Washington, D. C., who became our first \"Associate Member.\"\u00a0 As attendance grew, the locations changed to the Biology Lab, the Music Room, the Library and finally (in 1994) the Polish American Club.\u00a0 Discussions familiar to us today took place: membership fees ($15) and associate membership fees ($7).\u00a0 We adopted a Constitution and By Laws, which never been substantively amended.\u00a0 Annual dues are now $25 single or couple before June 30 and $15 after then. Membership has recently ranged between 75 and 90.\n\nMacomberFrom the beginning, we were able to attract a wide range of students, scholars, authors, reenactors and collectors to discuss and expound.\u00a0 What topics!\u00a0 Battle leaders; campaigns, the soldier\u2019s life in camp and on the march, wives, girl friends and others, how \"common\" people coped, politics and politicians, economics and demographics, financing the war, the blockade and blockade runners, war at sea, war on the rivers, great cavalry raids, diplomacy, food (who could forget Gerridine\u2019s hard tack?), music, weapons, teaching out-of-shape recruits from the audience how to march in formation, technology, medicine, sex, foreign born participants in the war, Jews on both sides, counterrevolutions like the \"Free State of Jones,\" the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglass debates (reenacted live!), Abraham Lincoln as a lawyer, as a debater and as a political and military leader, George McClellan, Robert E. Lee, U. S. Grant, Benjamin Franklin Butler, James Longstreet, George Custer, the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, Judah P. Benjamin, Logistics in the Civil War, Andersonville and other prisons, What happened to the generals after the war ended, Civil War nurses, The love life of Abraham Lincoln, a live prime time interview of Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Davis by a Civil War reporter, various movies, including participating in the premiere of \"Gettysburg,\" miniatures, the causes of the war, what if? and could war have been avoided.\u00a0 Last, but not least, Robert Macomber (left), best-selling author of the \"Peter Wake\" series, graced our Holiday Party for nine years in a row!\n\nCupsWe steadfastly kept the organization nonpartisan.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that our members were non-partisan!\u00a0 Our meetings were even filmed by John I. Leonard High School students!\u00a0 We participated in an ongoing History Project at the South Florida Fair Grounds.\u00a0 From time to time we sent speakers to area schools, condo and homeowner groups and civic clubs.\u00a0 We also answered phones for WXEL\u2019s pledge drives.\u00a0 With funds raised by the monthly raffles, and the sale of coffee cups we donated to a variety organizations such as the \"General Longstreet Memorial Fund,\" and, more recently, The Civil War Trust.\n\nLeland Smith got involved in a joint project with the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (which he helped start) in locating and decorating the graves of Civil War veterans in Palm Beach County:\u00a0 25 Union veterans are buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, two in Lake Worth cemetery, two in Delray Beach and one in Boca Raton.\n\nOur membership has included many subscribing t...

        "text":"Visiting the Al Fawar Refugee Camp in the South of Hebron\n\nOn Monday the Excellence Centre visited the Al Fawar Refugee camp located in the South of Hebron. The camp has ten thousand inhabitants housed within one square kilometer of land. The inhabitants include those who were displaced in 1948, when thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee their homes as their villages were razed by the new Israeli forces.IMG_8387\n\nWe spoke with one such woman who was a part of the original exodus of people from the villages to the refugee camp in 1948. When she arrived she was aged only ten. She spoke described how at first the refugees were housed in tents provided by the UN. This was an incredibly hard way of life for the refugees, especially during t he harsh Hebron winters I which the tent provided little relief from the biting winds, icy rain and heavy snow which are a feature of every winter here.IMG_8383\n\nThe UN provided the refugees with basic tents in 1948; once it became clear that the refugees would not be returning to their homes in the foreseeable future the UN provided the refugees with very basic, one-roomed houses. There were\u00a0 often families of ten or more living in only one room with only the most basic services.IMG_8381\n\nNow however, the refugee camp resembles something more akin to a favela. The refugees have become permanent inhabitants of the camp, as more refugees flooded to it in 1967. They have built their own houses in any space that is available to them. This has resulted in the camp becoming a warren of houses, built one on top of the other, and narrow pathways covered by grape vines which provide shade to the old men of\u00a0 the camp who sit out in the evenings.IMG_8391\n\n\nCopyright\u00a9 2018 - The Excellence Center in Palestine\n\n\u0650Ein Sarah Street, Hebron, Palestine",

The conference will provide information, resources, and coordination for Texans interested in orchestrating WWI commemoration activities for their communities and organizations.\n\nThe March conference is co-sponsored by the Texas Veterans Commission (TVC) and will be held at the Stephen F. Austin Building auditorium, located at 1700 North Congress Avenue in Austin. The day-long program will focus on helping organizations orchestrate events that will take place 2018 through June 2019 when the National WWI Centennial period ends.

Texas was a center for military logistics and training, as well as a key supplier of war materials (oil, cotton, livestock, lumber, etc.).\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to provide information, resources, and coordination for Texans interested in orchestrating WWI commemoration activities in their communities and organizations,\u201d said Jim Hodgson, a Director with the TXWWICCA. \u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with universities, museums, schools, civic groups, military units, and many others since 2016 on previous Texas WWI Centennial events.\u201d\n\nThe conference agenda will include updates on existing Centennial initiatives around the state and ideas for \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d commemoration activities that can be easily adopted. Organizations and communities who have not yet identified a Centennial commemoration event will be able to identify commemoration activities that best suit their constituency.\n\n\u201cWith TVC co-sponsorship, we will also emphasize the role veteran organizations can play,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cVeteran\u2019s issues from WWI remain relevant 100 years later\u2026we believe that WWI Centennial\u00a0commemorations provide a natural opportunity for veterans to connect with their communities, schools, and local governments.\u201d\n\nThe TXWWICCA is a non-profit, grass-roots organization with no paid staff.

This anniversary issue marks another step in the evolution of TEA, and the EAA more broadly. Have you visited our new webpage? EAA has a brand new website, integrated with the iMIS system. One advantage of this is that TEA content will now be available online as html pages, and debate articles will be available for members to add comments and discussion. This new format, the first of several upcoming changes, will make TEA easier to read online, particularly on mobile devices. And keep an eye out for TEA's new look, which will be more efficient and have a cleaner visual appearance. TEA will also continue to be available as a pdf document,\u00a0archived on the website.\n\nThis issue contains reports from the 22nd Annual Meeting in Vilnius, including the Minutes of the EAA Annual Membership Business Meeting\u00a0(AMBM). We emphasize that this is an important document. We ask that members read the minutes and contact the EAA executive board and administrator with any comments, questions or concerns. The EAA works for the membership, but we need to hear your voice! In addition to the Minutes of the ABMB, there is a proposal for an EAA working party on archaeology and the EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, and \u2018A Survey regarding The EAA Code of Practice for Fieldwork Training \u2019 from the Committee on the Teaching and Training of Archaeologists (CTTA). This latter raises a series of questions, and some troubling compliance issues, and the committee asks that EAA members respond by contacting the committee chair Raimund Karl directly, or by sending a response to be published in TEA. And, we also would like to hear your opinions about the EAA Strategic Development Plan.\n\nDuring the next year, between Vilnius 2016 and Maastricht 2017, we are promoting a TEA debate theme on Open Access, data accessibility, and ownership of archaeological information. Our first essay is \u2018Open Access and the EJA: some preliminary thoughts\u2019 by EJA Deputy Editor Catherine J. Frieman. We encourage you to read this, to comment on the EAA website, and to send us your opinions and essays on this topic.\n\nTwo EAA European Archaeological Heritage Prizes were awarded at Vilnius 2016: to\u00a0L\u2019Unit\u00e9 d'arch\u00e9ologie de la ville de Saint-Denis for exemplary achievements that unite archaeological heritage management and research with local community outreach, and to Dr. Caroline Sturdy Colls for her innovative contribution to the research on Nazi-German terror in camps and in massacres. Caroline Sturdy Colls contributed to this newsletter with \u2018Investigating Holocaust-Era Crimes\u2019, an introduction to her stimulating research in our Research section. Nominations for the 2017\u00a0European Heritage Prize must be received by the EAA Secretariat at before 1 June 2017.\n\nNow is the time to propose a session for the 23th EAA Annual Meeting in Maastricht. Session submission for EAA 2017 Maastricht is now open: the deadline is 30 November 2016.\n\nThis issue also includes reports from session and roundtables from the 22nd Annual Meeting in Vilnius, along with reports from other conferences and several announcements.

        "text":"Les Munro Presents Medals to MOTAT\n\nPress release by MOTAT on 15 April 2015\n\nToday veteran Squadron Leader, Les Munro, presented his gallantry medals, flight logbooks and associated memorabilia to the Museum of Transport and Technology in a special hand-over ceremony at the Museum\u2019s Aviation Display Hall. The presentation took place in front of one of the few remaining examples of the Avro Lancaster Bomber, made famous as a successful night bomber by the RAF Bomber Command in WWII.\n\nlesmunro_15042015Lord Ashcroft, whose generous donation of \u00a375,000 to the RAF Benevolent Fund made it possible for the medals to be retained in the country, collected the decorations and memorabilia from London auction house, Dix Noonan Webb, a couple of weeks ago and personally flew them back to New Zealand.\n\nEarlier in March, Les Munro accepted Lord Ashcroft\u2019s substantial donation to the RAF Benevolent Fund in return for withdrawing his medals from auction and gifting them to MOTAT. The auction house waived receipt of their fee on the basis that MOTAT would pay it to the Benevolent Fund instead.\n\nLord Ashcroft gave a moving speech at the ceremony explaining how his interest in war history was sparked as a 10-year-old boy when he learned of his father\u2019s personal experiences as a World War One veteran. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I sound a little emotional\u201d said Lord Ashcroft \u201cI\u2019m a hard-headed businessman but this is my passion\u201d he concluded.\n\nPrime Minister John Key acknowledged Mr Munro\u2019s altruism and referred to Lord Ashcroft as \u201ca true unsung hero of New Zealand with a real passion for the country\u201d\n\nMr Munro said he was extremely grateful for Lord Ashcroft\u2019s generosity which allowed the medals to remain on home soil. Although the medals will no longer be within the Munro family Mr Munro said \u201cI am comforted by the thought of my medals being situated in close proximity to the Lancaster at MOTAT as I flew all but one of my operations in these planes. I appreciate very much indeed that they will have some relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Museum is honoured to accept these precious items into its collection for the benefit of the Nation\u201d said MOTAT CEO, Mr Michael Frawley. \u201cMOTAT has a close association with NZ Bomber Command and the utmost respect for the sacrifice and courage these men showed in the Second World War. It\u2019s our intention to develop an exhibition highlighting what Mr Les Munro, Mr Len Chambers and the other New Zealand members of Bomber Command, in particular 617 Squadron, did during the war.\u201d\n\n\nFor further information please contact:\nVanessa Hefer on 845 3703 | 021 340 518 or email vanessa.hefer@motat.org.nz\n\nRead this press release on MOTAT.org.nz\n\nSign up for Lord Ashcroft List\nRead new posts as soon as they appear on lordashcroft.com",
