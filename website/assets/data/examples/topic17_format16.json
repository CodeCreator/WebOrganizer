This book presents the findings of an extensive research project into the views of both elite groups, in government, business, academia, media and social activists, and the Chinese public towards Europe and the European Union. It considers attitudes on a wide range of subjects, and reaches a number of interesting, encouraging conclusions. These include the fact that as Chinese people's knowledge of, and travel to, Europe becomes more extensive, Chinese attitudes towards Europe become more positive; that Chinese people have a high regard for European culture and a high degree of trust in Europeans; though there are significant differences between different Chinese groups concerning controversial issues in the China-EU relationship. Overall, the book concludes that the Chinese view is shifting from regarding Europe as an antagonist to regarding Europe as a model to emulate.\n\nRewards Program\n\nWrite a Review",

Caught up in the\nenthusiasm for national parks as \"America's best political idea\" (Wallace\nStegner) and the general support of the l964 Wilderness Act, we\nmiss the in-fighting over park appropriations, boundaries, inholdings, and\ndevelopment as well as the contentious western politics surrounding the\ndesignation of Bureau of Land Management\nwilderness under the 1976 Federal Land Policy Management Act.  In this\ncourse we will examine the history of national park and wilderness policy\nand survey current problems and policy.  We may briefly compare some foreign\nsystems with the United States.  I hope to arrange a field trip to the Deam\nWilderness (Indiana's only wilderness).  On this expedition we will consult\nwith government personnel, but will also feel an obligation to experience\nthe natural setting that causes all the excitement!\nSome of our central issues will be:  What land gets set aside as national\nparks or wilderness, and why?  How has the federal domain evolved and how do\nthe holdings of the Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of\nLand Management, and other federal agencies affect the politics of states\nand the nation as a whole?   How has the preservationist idea evolved?  How\nwell does the national government succeed in preserving ecosystems? What is\n\"wilderness\" and how should it be managed?  How much should there be?  What\nsort of constituency is there for national parks and wilderness and what is\nits future?  Students will be expected to contribute to the discussion of\nthese issues and to produce a research paper on an issue of this sort.  I\nwill try to set a good example by reporting on my own research into the\nfascinating controversy over wilderness designation in Utah.",

It has brought us unparalleled danger, as well as unparalleled opportunity for real change.\n\nWith the uprising triggered by George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers still going strong, there have been many heartening changes to local municipal laws around the country. But we all know it's not nearly enough. To produce\u00a0real\u00a0justice for the Black community, we must have equal economic power and equal access to education - and those are goals that seem lightyears away.\n\nAlthough police reform is a very hot topic and deserves national attention, there are other subjects we must not ignore while we have the national and even global stage. If these matters are not addressed, social justice and progress, in totality, will never be reached!\n\nFortunately, Reco McDaniel McCambry has a plan. As one of the top entrepreneurs and financial educators in America, he's spent his professional life helping Black families to initiate a foundation for generational wealth and motivating Black entrepreneurs to realize seemingly impossible goals.\n\nNow, McCambry brings his financial and motivational skills to the cause of racial justice. THE PLAN contained within these pages includes a blueprint that anyone can take to forward economic equality, fairer legislation, and transformational change for our black communities nationwide; even across the world.\n\nRelated collections and offers\n\nProduct Details\n\nISBN-13: 9780988734234\nPublisher: Urban Sharks, LLC\nPublication date: 09\/25\/2020\nSold by: Barnes & Noble\nFormat: NOOK Book\nPages: 202\nFile size: 399 KB\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\nChapter 1 Ending Police Brutality\n\nChapter 2 The Fatherless Epidemic, Is Impact, and its Origins\n\nChapter 3 Financial Education: The Foundation of Generational Change\n\nChapter 4 The Entertainment and Education Connection\n\nChapter 5 Fierce Leadership: The Essential Skills Needed\n\nChapter 6 Political Involvement: Changing the Law\n\nChapter 7 The Power of Collective Action: Working Together\n\nChapter 8 Finally - A True Plan for Reparations\n\nChapter 9 Let's Do This!\n\nAbout the Author\u00a0\n\nCustomer Reviews",
