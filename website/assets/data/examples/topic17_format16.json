In Electing Peace, Aila M. Matanock presents a theory that explains both the causes and the consequences of these provisions. Matanock draws on new worldwide cross-national data on electoral participation provisions, case studies in Central America, and interviews with representatives of all sides of the conflicts. She shows that electoral participation provisions, non-existent during the Cold War, are now in almost half of all peace agreements. Moreover, she demonstrates that these provisions are associated with an increase in the chance that peace will endure, potentially contributing to a global decline in civil conflict, a result which challenges prevailing pessimism about post-conflict elections. Matanock's theory and evidence also suggest a broader conception of international intervention than currently exists, identifying how these inclusive elections can enable external enforcement mechanisms and provide an alternative to military coercion by peacekeeping troops in many cases.\n\n    \u2022 Provides new cross-national data on electoral participation provisions (1975\u20132010) and case evidence on Guatemala and El Salvador\n    \u2022 Offers a new mechanism through which international actors help secure peace and stabilize peace agreements in states with civil conflict\n    \u2022 Appeals to those who see value in 'soft' approaches to peacekeeping, such as conditional aid and other incentives alongside monitoring\n    Read more\n\n\n    \u2022 Winner, 2018 Charles H. Levine Memorial Book Prize, International Political Science Association\n\n    Reviews & endorsements\n\n    \u2018Matanock's terrific book sheds light on the relatively new phenomenon of crafting peace agreements that include provisions for the political participation of former rebels. She uses new data to deftly weave together analysis of peace agreements, peacekeeping, peace duration, elections, and election monitoring - topics that are typically considered separately \u2013 and provide a comprehensive and compelling argument for the importance of formally integrating former rebels into post-conflict governance.' Tanisha Fazal, University of Minnesota\n\n    \u2018Almost half of all elections globally occur in the shadow of violent conflict, and post-conflict elections have become vital international tools of peacebuilding and democratization. Yet these elections, fraught with tension and high stakes, have an unenviable track record: as often as not, they lead to conflict recidivism and democratic decline. Against this backdrop, Aila Matanock's Electing Peace sounds a clarion call to keep the faith. The key is to create a path for yesterday's combatants to become tomorrow's politicians. When such a path is seen as credible by warring parties, they are more likely to trade tanks for campaign buses and guns for microphones. This is a must-read for academics and policymakers who aspire to build peace through democracy in conflict-afflicted countries.' Irfan Nooruddin, Georgetown University, Washington DC, and author of Elections in Hard Times\n\n    'Aila M. Matanock helps solve one of the hardest problems associated with civil wars: how to get a successful peace agreement without the help of a third party military intervention. Using new cross-national data on peace agreements and detailed analysis of Guatemala and El Salvador, Matanock shows us how electoral participation can help combatants enforce agreements. Bravo!' Barbara F. Walter, University of California, San Diego\n\n    'Matanock provides a refreshingly positive and constructive appraisal of democratic peacebuilding \u2026 Matanock\u2019s study is a much-welcomed contribution to the field and one that will be of great value to both policymakers and academics.' Richard Lappin, Democratization\n\n    \u2018Electing Peace advances our thinking and knowledge about the range of options available to facilitate peace agreements and ultimately long-term peace.' Beth A. Simmons, Democratization\n\n    'Perhaps the most important contribution of Electing Peace is the insight it offers into ongoing debates over the dangers of democratization, as well as whether postconflict elections incite a return to violence. Matanock tackles these timely questions with clarity and authority. This is an exemplary piece of scholarship whose attention to context and nuance rewards its readers with generalizations that are at once 'big' and 'bounded' \u2026 As such, it is an important book that deserves a wide audience.' Daniela Donno, Perspectives on Politics\n\n    'Matanock's book is a must-read for all scholars and practitioners interested in understanding how elections and outside engagement can help end modern civil wars.' Hannah Smidt, Africa Spectrum\n\n    'The extremely thorough research approach, the systematic approach of the author and her invigorating mixture of fundamental political considerations with statistical material and interview results make the book \u2026 not only worth reading for dealing with the special election aspect after civil wars, but also in general for the topic of Peace processes after civil wars.'

The radical decisions about how to combat terrorists and strengthen national security were made in a state of utter chaos and fear, but the key players, Vice President Dick Cheney and his powerful, secretive adviser David Addington, used the crisis to further a long held agenda to enhance Presidential powers to a degree never known in U.S. history, and obliterate Constitutional protections that define the very essence of the American experiment.\n\nTHE DARK SIDE is a dramatic, riveting, and definitive narrative account of how the United States made terrible decisions in the pursuit of terrorists around the world\u2014 decisions that not only violated the Constitution to which White House officials took an oath to uphold, but also hampered the pursuit of Al Qaeda. In gripping detail, acclaimed New Yorker writer and bestselling author, Jane Mayer, relates the impact of these decisions\u2014U.S.-held prisoners, some of them completely innocent, were subjected to treatment more reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition than the twenty-first century.\n\nTHE DARK SIDE will chronicle real, specific cases, shown in real time against the larger tableau of what was happening in Washington, looking at the intelligence gained\u2014or not\u2014and the price paid. In some instances, torture worked. In many more, it led to false information, sometimes with devastating results. For instance, there is the stunning admission of one of the detainees, Sheikh Ibn al-Libi, that the confession he gave under duress\u2014which provided a key piece of evidence buttressing congressional support of going to war against Iraq\u2014was in fact fabricated, to make the torture stop.\n\nIn all cases, whatever the short term gains, there were incalculable losses in terms of moral standing, and our country's place in the world, and its sense of itself. THE DARK SIDE chronicles one of the most disturbing chapters in American history, one that will serve as the lasting legacy of the George W. Bush presidency.\n\nThe New York Times - Alan Brinkley\n\na powerful, brilliantly researched and deeply unsettling book\u2026The Bush administration is not, of course, the first or only regime to violate civil liberties. John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt all authorized or tolerated terrible violations of civil and human rights, all of them in response to great national and global crises. In some respects, the Bush administration is simply following a familiar path by responding to real dangers with illegal and deplorable methods. But Jane Mayer's extraordinary and invaluable book suggests that it would be difficult to find any precedent in American history for the scale, brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years; and that it would be even harder to imagine a set of policies more likely to increase the dangers facing the United States and the world.",

Governments often use this forum to articulate decades-old positions and table resolutions that change little in substance or result from year to year. The civil society organisations, coalitions, and campaigns participating most actively at First Committee have argued consistently that we can and must replace watered-down outcomes with alternative results that advance human security and social and economic justice.\n\nThis briefing book provides a quick overview of the state of play on some of the most pressing issues that will (or should) be addressed at this year\u2019s First Committee. It also outlines recommendations for governments from some of the key civil society groups working on these topics.\n\nThe groups that have contributed to this book work on many different issues and weapon systems from a variety of perspectives, but they all share one thing in common: the desire for more effective, transparent, and inclusive diplomatic work at the United Nations.\n\nEdited by Ray Acheson \u2022 Published by Reaching Critical Will, a project of the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom\n\nFull briefing book\n\nWe are delighted to offer the online version for free, but please consider\u00a0making\u00a0a donation\u00a0to Reaching Critical Will to help us cover the costs of producing this book\u00a0and the other materials and information services that Reaching Critical Will provides.",

Whitaker\n\nPublication Year: 2014\n\nA concise, engaging, and provocative history of African Americans since World War II, Peace Be Still is also nothing less than an alternate history of the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Organizing this history around culture, politics, and resistance, Matthew C. Whitaker takes us from World War II as a galvanizing force for African American activism and the modern civil rights movement to the culmination of generations of struggle in the election of Barack Obama.\n\nFrom the promise of the post\u2013World War II era to the black power movement of the 1960s, the economic and political struggles of the 1970s, and the major ideological realignment of political culture during the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, this book chronicles a people fighting oppression while fashioning a dynamic culture of artistic and religious expression along with a program of educational and professional advancement. A resurgence of rigid conservative right-wing policies, the politics of poverty, racial profiling, and police brutality are ongoing counterpoints to African Americans rising to political prominence and securing positions once denied them.\n\nA history of African Americans for a new generation, Peace Be Still demonstrates how dramatically African American history illuminates the promise, conflicts, contradictions, hopes, and victories that all Americans share.\n\n\nPublished by: University of Nebraska Press\n\nTitle Page, Copyright, Dedication\n\npdf iconDownload PDF (54.4 KB)\npp. 2-7\n\n\npdf iconDownload PDF (43.2 KB)\npp. vii-viii\n\n\npdf iconDownload PDF (28.8 KB)\npp. ix-x\n\nread more\n\n\npdf iconDownload PDF (50.4 KB)\npp. xi-xvi\n\nFavor is priceless.

Price\n\n349,00 34900\nSendes vanligvis innen 5-15 dager\nVast changes in technologies and geopolitics have produced a wholesale shift in the way states and other powerful entities think about the production and retention of popular loyalties. Strategic communication has embraced these changes as stakes increase and the techniques of information management become more pervasive. These shifts in strategic communications impact free speech as major players, in a global context, rhetorically embrace a world of transparency, all the while increasing surveillance and modes of control, turning altered media technologies and traditional media doctrines to their advantage. This book exposes the anxieties of loss of control, on the one hand, and the missed opportunities for greater freedom, on the other. 'New' strategic communication arises from the vast torrents of information that cross borders and uproot old forms of regulation. Not only states but also corporations, nongovernmental organizations, religious institutions, and others have become part of this new constellation of speakers and audiences.\n\n\nSpr\u00e5k Engelsk Engelsk Innbinding Heftet\nUtgitt 2014 Forfatter Monroe E.

It also threatens to generate a popular aversion to God and religion by identifying religious values with a pro-war, pro-business, pro-rich, anti-science, and anti-environmental stance. Over the past few decades, the Republicans have achieved political dominance by forging a union with the Religious Right. This marriage has provided a sanctimonious veneer for policies that have helped the rich get richer while ignoring the needs of the middle class and the poor, dismantling environmental and civil liberties protections, and seeking global domination. The Right champions the materialism and ruthless selfishness promoted by unrestrained capitalism and then laments the moral crises of family instability and loneliness experienced by people who bring these commercial values into their homes and personal lives. In response, the Religious Right offers insular communities for the faithful and a culture that blames liberals, activist judges, homosexuals, independent women, and all secular people for the moral and spiritual emptiness so many Americans experience. Yet, however distorted both the Right's analysis and its solutions to America's spiritual crisis may be, it wins allegiance by addressing the human hunger for a life with some higher purpose. The Left, by contrast, remains largely tone-deaf to the spiritual needs of the American people. It is the yearning for meaning in life, not just the desire for money or power, that lies at the core of American politics. Addressing the central mystery of contemporary politics -- why so many Americans vote against their own economic interests -- The Left Hand of God provides an invaluable, timely, and blunt critique of the current state of faith in government. Lerner challenges the Left to give up its deeply held fear of religion and to distinguish between a domination-oriented, Right-Hand-of-God tradition and a more compassionate and hope-oriented Left-Hand-of-God worldview. Further, Lerner describes the ways that Democrats have misunderstood and alienated significant parts of their potential constituency. To succeed again, Lerner argues, the Democratic Party must rethink its relationship to God, champion a progressive spiritual vision, reject the old bottom line that promotes the globalization of selfishness, and deal head-on with the very real spiritual crisis that many Americans experience every day. Lerner presents a vision that incorporates and then goes far beyond contemporary liberal and progressive politics. He argues for a new bottom line in our economy, schools, and government. This is a fundamentally fresh approach, one that takes spiritual needs seriously in our economic and political lives. Presenting an eight-point progressive spiritual covenant with America, Lerner provides a blueprint for how the Democratic Party can effectively challenge the Right and position itself to win the White House and Congress. By appealing to religious, secular, and spiritual but not necessarily religious people, The Left Hand of God blazes a trail that could change our world and reclaim America from the Religious Right.\n\nPlease wait while this item is added to your cart...",

But the Nixon tapes uniquely reveal the President\u2019s voice and perspective on extraordinary events. Other presidents taped conversations, but did so selectively, at their own initiative. Those tapes often seem contrived, even staged, and have had relatively little impact in shaping our knowledge or understanding of these men.\n\nWe have no known record of such unguarded and frank talk by any other president. These conversations provide a rare glimpse of a president uninhibited by the restraints of public appearance, and capture him in moments alone with trusted confidants. Here, we have both exceptional candor and a practiced level of deceit; the display of a constant calculus of political considerations; the exhibit of raw, human emotions; and, above all, the revelations of extraordinary, illegal, seemingly unprecedented presidential behavior and power.\n\nWho would you use? HALDEMAN: [National Security Aide Richard] Dick Allen. PRESIDENT NIXON: That\u2019s the guy. Allen\u2019s the guy. Put him in charge of it. He\u2019s the\u2014you\u2019ve got it named. That\u2019s exactly the man I want. . We just desperately need, I think, we need this guy, this declassification thing. HALDEMAN: Dick Allen is the guy to do it. He\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re talking about. Why, all the sophistication\u2014 PRESIDENT NIXON: I want Huston in on the team. HALDEMAN: All right. PRESIDENT NIXON: Because Huston will know what to look for.\n\nDownload PDF sample\n\nAbuse of Power by Stanley Kutler\n\nby Charles\n\nRated 4.69 of 5 \u2013 based on 29 votes",

Often regarded as the archetypical militarist state, Imperial Germany in fact witnessed a major controversy over the issue, as the arms race and the military-industrial complex displaced more traditional concerns about authoritarian rule, and militarism gradually acquired its modern meaning. Older radical traditions and the impact of Marxism are reassessed as Nicholas Stargardt examines the political history of German Social Democracy, the principal anti-militarist protagonist.\n\nRead More Show Less\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nFrom the Publisher\n\"The book is based on a wide variety of excellent sources, some in archives not usually consulted, such as the Brandenburg provincial archives, Potsdam, or the protocols of the Social Democratic party congresses.
