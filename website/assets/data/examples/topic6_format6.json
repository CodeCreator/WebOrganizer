The Dotted Music followers know his music well, as we\u2019ve been using Fanu\u2019s tracks in the Stand Above The Noise trailer, the series\u2019 intro and outro, as well as the Music Growth Talks podcast.\n\nThe format of this video interview, filmed in Helsinki in Spring 2012, is different from our other episodes, and the content differs a bit as well. It\u2019s simply inspiring. A real chat with a real musician, who has built a name for himself, but is still struggling to make a living only making music. But he does not give up.\n\nEvery musician watching this video will find interesting thoughts in here. Find out more about Fanu at and follow him on Twitter!",

        "text":"On Purpose\n\nThe Peculiar People\n\nFifteen years after the release of their initial groundbreaking debut album, musical group The Peculiar People is set to return as they release their second album entitled Out The Box II: Separation Of The Church And State. This album is a sequel to their initial Out The Box album which garnered six Stellar Awards and several Grammy-nominations and sold over a million copies. The Peculiar People is founded by two-time Emmy Award winner and three-time Grammy-nominated B. Slade, who is not only the producer but also a proud member of the musical group. In this new day and age and the group ventures to bridge the gap between the spiritual and secular worlds, turning a mirror to help people face uncomfortable truths while acknowledging and respecting a need for resolutions and unity. Producer B. Slade, as he is more commonly known, continues his trendsetting ways and innovative techniques to produce quality products. As a restless musical amalgamator and audacious modernizer, he has thrown open the chapel doors and embraced the musical world of hip-hop, R&B, soul, bass music, electronic pop, and other contemporary styles. For further evidence of the group\u2019s fearlessness, look no further than their latest single entitled \u201cOn Purpose.\u201d It\u2019s an earth-shaking collision of gospel, rap, skittering trap house beats, slowed-down screwed vocals, warped synthesizer grooves, and tight harmony singing; the sound may be radical, but the message of faith is eternal. Out The Box II: The Separation Of Church & State is designed as a sequel to The Peculiar People\u2019s original revolutionary Out The Box (I) album released in 2004, which featured guest appearances from Kirk Franklin and Yolanda Adams and turned gospel music upside down. The new album which includes the single \u201cOn Purpose\u201d suggests that this new Peculiar People set is going to be every bit as transformative. About the video The Peculiar People return in their highly anticipated music video and single entitled \u201cOn Purpose\u201d from the new upcoming installment of Out The Box II: The Separation Of Church & State. The video resembles a flashy hip-hop clip that includes everything from cars, to the crew, sneakers, shades, bright colored lights, rambunctious dance moves, and even a little swagger too. Everything is in place, and it\u2019s all exciting! The world needs to know that the Peculiar People are back to complete some unfinished business. Their video is a bold statement unlike one we\u2019ve ever seen before. Simply put: if the first Out Of The Box was considered off the wall, Out The Box II: The Separation Of Church & State is the bulldozer that tears those walls down to make a way for what looms ahead.\n\n\nShare this video",
