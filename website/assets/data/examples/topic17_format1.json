Bur\u00adwell, a religiously-affiliated col\u00adlege that opposes cer\u00adtain forms of birth con\u00adtrol is chal\u00adleng\u00ading the process by which they indi\u00adcate to the gov\u00adern\u00adment that they qual\u00adify for an excep\u00adtion to the con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtion man\u00addate. This excep\u00adtion allows reli\u00adgious, non-profit employ\u00aders such as the col\u00adlege, to opt out of pro\u00advid\u00ading employee health insur\u00adance that cov\u00aders con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtion. \u00a0But, iron\u00adi\u00adcally, the col\u00adlege claims that apply\u00ading for this excep\u00adtion (which involves com\u00adplet\u00ading a two-page gov\u00adern\u00adment form) vio\u00adlates its rights under RFRA, which was the same law that for-profit cor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtions suc\u00adcess\u00adfully used to chal\u00adlenge the man\u00addate in the Hobby Lobby\u00a0case. \u00a0In the July 3 order, the Court employed a rarely used legal mech\u00ada\u00adnism to tem\u00adporar\u00adily block imple\u00admen\u00adta\u00adtion of the excep\u00adtion while the case is still under appeal.\n\nRFRA requires the fed\u00aderal gov\u00adern\u00adment to demon\u00adstrate the most strin\u00adgent con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtional stan\u00addard when it imposes a \u201csub\u00adstan\u00adtial\u201d bur\u00adden on a person\u2019s reli\u00adgious exer\u00adcise.\u00a0\u00a0 As ADL pointed out in its ami\u00adcus (friend-of-the-court) brief to the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby case, RFRA\u2019s use of the term sub\u00adstan\u00adtial is not an acci\u00addent, but was included to make clear that the statute\u2019s strong pro\u00adtec\u00adtions could not be trig\u00adgered by inci\u00adden\u00adtal or minor bur\u00addens on reli\u00adgion.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, the Sen\u00adate Report on RFRA states that Con\u00adgress added the term so that the law \u201cwould not require [a com\u00adpelling gov\u00adern\u00adment inter\u00adest] for every gov\u00adern\u00adment action that may have some inci\u00adden\u00adtal effect on reli\u00adgious institutions.\u201d\n\nBased on this report and other prece\u00addent, the brief ADL joined in Hobby Lobby argued that the sec\u00adu\u00adlar, for-profit cor\u00adpo\u00adrate plain\u00adtiffs were not eli\u00adgi\u00adble for RFRA\u2019s pro\u00adtec\u00adtions because, among other rea\u00adsons, any bur\u00adden on their reli\u00adgious exer\u00adcise was inci\u00adden\u00adtal and not sub\u00adstan\u00adtial. \u00a0Unfor\u00adtu\u00adnately, the Court did not agree with ADL\u2019s argu\u00adment. \u00a0It ruled that appli\u00adca\u00adtion of the con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtion man\u00addate to the cor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtions did sub\u00adstan\u00adtially bur\u00adden their reli\u00adgious exer\u00adcise and vio\u00adlated\u00a0RFRA.\n\nThe Court\u2019s sub\u00adse\u00adquent action in the Wheaton Col\u00adlege case ren\u00addered this mis\u00adguided con\u00adclu\u00adsion even more ominous.\n\nRead

\u201cSilent War on Reli\u00adgious Lib\u00aderty\u201d in America.\u00a0\n\nIn recent remarks at the Ronald Rea\u00adgan Pres\u00adi\u00adden\u00adtial Library, the Gov\u00ader\u00adnor claimed that this war is being \u201cwaged in our courts and in the halls of polit\u00adi\u00adcal power.\u201d\u00a0 Although \u201cchurches in Amer\u00adica are not being burned to the ground, and Chris\u00adtians are not being slaugh\u00adtered for their faith,\u201d he con\u00adtends that this blood\u00adless war \u201cthreat\u00adens the fab\u00adric of our com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adties, the health of our pub\u00adlic square, and the endurance of our con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtional governance.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0bobby-jindal\n\nExhibit A in the Governor\u2019s speech evi\u00addenc\u00ading this pur\u00adported silent war is the Hobby Lobby case cur\u00adrently pend\u00ading before the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0 In that case, the Gov\u00ader\u00adnor is sup\u00adport\u00ading own\u00aders of for-profit, sec\u00adu\u00adlar cor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtions who are chal\u00adleng\u00ading the Afford\u00adable Care Act\u2019s con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtion man\u00addate on reli\u00adgious free\u00addom grounds.\n\nThe man\u00addate would require these cor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtions to pro\u00advide employ\u00adees with com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsive health insur\u00adance, inclu\u00adsive of pre\u00adscrip\u00adtion birth con\u00adtrol, or pay a mod\u00adest tax.\u00a0 From the Governor\u2019s per\u00adspec\u00adtive, these cor\u00adpo\u00adrate own\u00aders should be allowed to impose their reli\u00adgious beliefs about con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtion on thou\u00adsands of employ\u00adees who likely have diverse reli\u00adgious views on the subject.\n\nExhibit B is a series of legal cases against bak\u00aderies, florists and other wed\u00adding ser\u00advice providers who have refused on reli\u00adgious grounds to pro\u00advide ser\u00advices to same-sex cou\u00adples.\u00a0 Here too, Gov\u00ader\u00adnor Jin\u00addal over\u00adlooks the fact that many of these cou\u00adples find sup\u00adport for their mar\u00adriages in their reli\u00adgious tra\u00addi\u00adtion, and could legit\u00adi\u00admately claim that their reli\u00adgion is being denigrated.\n\nIn his speech at the Rea\u00adgan Library, the Gov\u00ader\u00adnor also said \u201c\u2026 the fact is that our reli\u00adgious lib\u00ader\u00adties are designed to pro\u00adtect peo\u00adple of all faiths.\u201d\u00a0 Stand\u00ading alone, this would be a forth\u00adright state\u00adment on our nation\u2019s cher\u00adished con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtional val\u00adues. \u00a0How\u00adever, given the con\u00adtext of his speech, this remark lacks cred\u00adi\u00adbil\u00adity.\u00a0 The Governor\u2019s appar\u00adent sup\u00adport for cer\u00adtain Chris\u00adt\u00adian view\u00adpoints being imposed on our plu\u00adral\u00adis\u00adtic work\u00adforce, mar\u00adket\u00adplace, and soci\u00adety erro\u00adneously sup\u00adports the use of the Con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtion as a sword to advance the majority\u2019s reli\u00adgion rather than a shield to pro\u00adtect the rights of reli\u00adgious minori\u00adties or the non-religious.\u00a0 It is unfor\u00adtu\u00adnate that the Governor\u2019s sup\u00adport for reli\u00adgious free\u00addom seems selec\u00adtive rather than universal.\n\nTags: , , , , , , , , , , , ,",

So we want to introduce, just as the Attlee government with Nye Bevan introduced the National Health Service, we want to introduce a national education service, free at the point of need throughout life. That means ending the cuts in the schools at primary and second level, that means free childcare, it means free skills training whenever you need it throughout life. And yes, it means scrapping tuition fees once and for all, so we don't burden our kids with debt in the future.\"\n\nConservatives 'won't scrap tuition fees'\n\nTheresa May has told an audience at a factory at Mansfield that a Conservative government after the election would not scrap university tuition fees in England.\n\nPressed over the issue following reports that Labour may be planning to get rid of tuition fees, Mrs May said the question for Labour was how they would pay for that pledge, warning that it would \"wreck the economy\".\n\nShe added: \"If you wreck the economy you aren't able to support students, you aren't able to support public services, you see businesses going under, you see jobs going.\"\n\nPic: Crowd turns out to greet Jeremy Corbyn\n\nThe Labour leader is in York\n\nJeremy Corbyn in York\n\nWatch: May on TV debate abstinence\n\n'Food banks have been with us for many years' - May\n\nQuestioned about a rise in homelessness and food bank use, Theresa May says the government is investing\u00a0\u00a3500m to help combat homelessness and also trying to intervene before people become homeless.\n\n\"Food banks have been with us for many years,\" she says, and \"there are complex reasons\" why people use them.\n\nThis echoes a response she gave the BBC's Andrew Marr last month.\n\nCampaign view from the press pack\n\nOn the inside of the campaign trail,restrictions around journalists questions may be relaxing.

Speaking earlier, Jeremy Corbyn said this rate would still be lower than the 28% rate in 2010.\n\nHowever, that was the main rate of corporation tax in 2010, with the rate for small businesses set at 21%. The rate for both now currently stands at 19%, while a 20% rate applies to UK oil extraction.\n\nAn FSB spokeswoman said:\n\nWe are pressing Jeremy Corbyn to honour the commitment he made when he met with FSB members last month, for no increases to corporation tax for small businesses under a future Labour government.\n\nJeremy Corbyn takes a selfie with a supporter\n\nBBC Trending\n\nWhat's popular and why\n\nThe inside story of how a legion of hard-core Jeremy Corbyn fans are spreading his message online.\n\nRead more\n\nGeneral Election 2017: UKIP activist's anger over Clacton candidate selection\n\nOrla Moore\n\nBBC Local Live\n\nA Clacton councillor says he's \"very angry\" at the decision by UKIP to field a national candidate in the town's seat for the General Election.\u00a0\n\nJeff Bray had previously defeated national executive committee member Paul Oakley in a vote by the local party.\u00a0\n\nIn emails seen by BBC Essex's political reporter Simon Dedman, one local activist said the decision was \"shambolic\". \u00a0\n\nClacton's sitting MP, Douglas Carswell, had been UKIP's only MP until he quit the party - and later announced he would not stand for re-election. \u00a0\n\nFormer party donor Arron Banks, who had previously put himself forward to stand in the seat, tweeted: \"Paul is a good chap, disappointing that the branch couldn't select their own candidate - it's the reason I didn't stand\".\n\nView more on twitter\n\nMr Oakley will compete in the seat against Liberal Democrat David Grace, Labour's Natasha Osben, Independent Caroline Shearer, Chris Southall from the Green Party and Conservative Giles Watling. \u00a0\n\nPaul Oakley UKIP\n\nScottish Greens co-leader: 'We don't have a spare 100k to field more candidates'\n\nBBC Radio 5 live tweets...\n\nTories emphasising 'Team Theresa' on the campaign trail\n\nBBC News Channel\n\nAlex Forsyth\n\nBBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth says the Labour marginal seat Theresa May chose for her appearance today is - \"one that she thinks she can take\" on polling day.\n\nAlex says Mrs May said the election was \"not about how people have voted before, it's about what's right for the country\".\n\nAs the signs behind her indicate, \"brand May\" is being pushed. She says:\n\nThis isn't 'vote Conservative' - this is team Theresa May.\n\nThe campaign is focusing on the Tory leader because the party thinks she \"comes across as more credible\" than Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, says Alex.\n\nCould Bishop Auckland vote Tory?\n\nBBC Newsnight\n\nIf the Conservatives were to win the constituency of Bishop Auckland that would put them on track for a landslide general election victory. Could it happen in a seat that has been Labour since 1935? BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt reports. \u00a0\n\nCould Bishop Auckland vote Tory?\n\nExpenses decision: The big legal decision\n\nDominic Casciani\n\nHome Affairs Correspondent\n\nIt's worth explaining why the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to authorise anyone to be charged over the 2015 election expenses allegations.\u00a0\n\nQuite simply, it comes down to the difference between an expense return being wrong and the candidate and their team knowing it to be so. The Representation of the People Act says that candidates and agents must submit a complete and correct log of spending. But... while it's a technical offence to submit an incomplete return, a jury would have to be sure that the agent or candidate acted \"knowingly or dishonestly\". Here's the key sentence from today's decision\n\nBy omitting any 'Battle Bus' costs, the returns may have been inaccurate. However, it is clear [electoral] agents were told by Conservative Party headquarters that the costs were part of the national campaign.\n\nCrown Prosecution Service\n\nTheresa May on school funding and election expenses verdict\n\nTheresa May takes a handful of questions after her campaign speech, including on school funding and the CPS verdict on the Tory expenses cases.\n\nAfter Labour and Lib Dems pledged more funding for schools, Mrs May is asked if she will consider abandoning planned changes to the school funding formula in England.\n\nThe government's proposed changes have been opposed by some headteachers and parents\u00a0who feel they are unreasonable.\n\nMrs May insists that\u00a0\"people have accepted for years now that the current formula is unfair\". and the government will respond to a consultation which closed in March.\n\nOn expenses, she repeats the line from other senior Tories that the party's candidates had \"done nothing wrong\".\n\nThere was an error made in the party's election returns and it paid a fine, she says, adding that other parties were also f...
