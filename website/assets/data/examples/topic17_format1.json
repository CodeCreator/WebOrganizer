House Republicans disagree.\n\nMon, 07\/21\/2014 - 16:02 -- Eva Prkachin\n\nCommunities around the world are leading the way in developing locally-owned and operated broadband networks. Here's why it's getting harder to do that in the U.S. Spoiler alert: politicians are screwing it up.\n\nArticle by Timothy B. Lee for Vox\n\nThis week, the House of Representatives approved legislation from Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) that would make it harder for cities to build publicly-owned broadband networks. The proposal is a shot at Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who wants to remove state-level restrictions on municipal networks; Blackburn's legislation would forbid the FCC from removing those restrictions. This is the latest escalation of a long-running war between municipal broadband supporters and incumbent broadband companies that have relentlessly opposed municipal broadband proposals.\n\nMotherboard: Meet Marsha Blackburn, Big Telecom's Best Friend in Congress\n\nFri, 07\/18\/2014 - 14:04 -- Eva Prkachin\n\nThis Tennessee Congresswoman has some scary ideas on the future of the Internet and telecommunications. If she has you concerned, you better speak up at\n\nArticle by Ben Makuch for Motherboard\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican, has built a reputation as one of the most conservative members of Congress, especially on tech policy. A strong free market advocate, Blackburn vehemently opposes net neutrality, which she calls \"socialistic,\" and has been a strong critic of what she views as activist Federal Communications Commission policy.\n\nThe Top 5 milestones in the fight to stop the Internet slow lane\u2026 this week.\n\nFri, 07\/18\/2014 - 12:31 -- Eva Prkachin\n\nEarlier this week, the United States Federal Communications Commission (or FCC) extended its deadline for initial comments on rules that would allow Big Telecom conglomerates to force all websites who can\u2019t pay expensive fees for privileged access into an Internet slow lane. The reason for the delay? Internet users around the world spoke out in such great numbers that the FCC\u2019s servers came crashing down.\n\nNeedless to say, it\u2019s been a busy week in the fight for authentic net neutrality. So, to get us all up to speed on where the debate currently sits, we\u2019ve summed up some of the most noteworthy events in the last week below. Let us know in the comments if we missed anything!\n\nGoogle, Netflix, and Facebook ask FCC to intervene in fight over Internet 'congestion'\n\nWed, 07\/16\/2014 - 17:14 -- Eva Prkachin\n\nWe're at a critical point in the fight to preserve the innovative, open Internet. Check out where the next battle lines will be drawn and learn more at\n\nArticle by Ben Popper for The Verge\n\nThe Internet Association, a trade group composed of some of the biggest tech companies in the world, has filed comment with the FCC asking it to intervene in the conflict over payments being demanded by big ISPs. According to a report in The Hill, companies like Comcast and Verizon are charging Netflix and others for direct interconnection to their networks, a move which allows these companies to bypass congestion and avoid service issues like video buffering. The group wrote in its letter that \"interconnection should not be used as a choke point to artificially slow traffic or extract unreasonable tolls.\"\n\nThe top 5 unexpected allies in the fight against the Internet Slow Lane\n\nWed, 07\/16\/2014 - 14:10 -- Eva Prkachin\n\nWhat do websites devoted to frat-boy humor, handmade and vintage clothes, and saving the environment all have in common? They\u2019re all passionate about saving the Internet from being forced into a slow lane. No, we\u2019re not kidding.\n\nThe fight to save the open Internet as we know it has found allies in unexpected places. And your OpenMedia team isn\u2019t the first to notice this. As Michael Masnick writing for TechDirt notes, \u201cIt's also been fantastic to see that a number of innovative startups have decided to speak out on how important an open and free internet is for being able to build their businesses, to innovate and to compete on the modern internet.\u201d\n\nWe crashed the FCC\u2019s website. So we took your voices straight to their offices in Washington, D.C.\n\nTue, 07\/15\/2014 - 15:31 -- Josh Tabish\n\nWe did it! Public outcry over Big Telecom\u2019s efforts to force everyone (except those with really deep pockets) into an Internet slow lane has crashed the U.S. Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) website.\n\nToday was the final day to file initial comments with the FCC on the raging debate over Net Neutrality - that is, the idea that no Internet data should be forced into a slow lane online because of expensive \u2018prioritization\u2019 fees. Early this morning, the public comment system received an extraordinary amount of traffic from Internet users around the world. So far, the FCC has received over 670,000 comments on its proposal through their online system.\n\nIn response to the FCC\u2019s website fail, your OpenMedia team made sure your voices were being heard, by hand-delivering comments to the FCC\u2019s central office in Washington, D.C. The delivery took place in cooperation with dozens of other groups in the fight for the open Internet. For our part, we took the names of over 125,00 Internet users who have joined the OpenMedia community by signing on to our Say No to the Internet Slow Lane campaign.\n\nReddit is crowd-sourcing ways to push back against the Internet slow lane. You should join them.\n\nMon, 07\/14\/2014 - 15:44 -- Eva Prkachin\n\nGood news everyone! Our friends at reddit are crowd-sourcing a formal submission to the U.S. FCC about proposed rules that could force businesses and users everywhere into an Internet slow lane. As many of you already know, U.S. Big Telecom companies have been aggressively pushing a set of rules that would force everyone except those with deep, deep pockets (think: major media conglomerates) into a second-tier of service that could slow their content to a crawl.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is the status of \u201cnet neutrality\u201d \u2013 arguably the founding principle of the Internet, and a key component to innovation online. Those familiar with reddit (AKA: \u201cthe front page of the Internet\u201d) will be unsurprised that the company has come out strongly in support of the open Internet and authentic net neutrality.\n\nWhile there are many reasons to be concerned about the future of net neutrality, we think reddit sums it pretty well:\n\nThe TPP Internet Censorship Circus is in town and it\u2019s more secretive than ever\n\nThu, 07\/10\/2014 - 15:17 -- Eva Prkachin\n\nThe bureaucrats and industry lobbyists negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership have gone to great lengths to keep their plans a secret before, but this takes the cake. After scheduling the next round of bargaining for Vancouver, negotiators quietly made a last minute switch to Ottawa with only a week to go before the round began.\n\nThe TPP is an international agreement involving Canada and 11 other countries, involving 40% of the global economy, that threatens to censor free expression online amongst other concerns spanning environmental protections, jobs, public health, and even our democratic rights.\n\nThroughout this week in Ottawa, negotiators worked to ink a binding international agreement behind closed doors, which experts say could block web content, invade your privacy, and make your Internet more expensive.",

And this time, she\u2019s beaten her previous record of 1,403 boxes of cookies with 1,728 boxes. However, that amount doesn\u2019t even include the amount of cookies she sold after an official sale period of December 12-January 19, on her own as well as at a recent booth sale with her troop in front of the Stuy Town Associated supermarket.\n\nAt a recent conversation at her family\u2019s apartment, Madeleine Noveck, better known as Maddie, discussed her success and the fun she\u2019s had going door to door for what is actually America\u2019s second best-selling cookie. (Girl Scout cookies are just behind Oreos.)\n\nThis year, Noveck\u2019s efforts won her an iPad Air \u2013 although for her it\u2019s just another one to throw on the pile. She also won an iPad mini two years ago and another iPad last year that she\u00a0gave to her brother. But even without the prizes, for Noveck, selling cookies is the best part of being a Girl Scout and it\u2019s why she joined. That was in kindergarten, and she didn\u2019t start selling right away, but when she did it was with a passion. Two years ago, she succeeded in selling over 1,000 cookies, which, this year, was accomplished by only 18 girls in New York City.\n\nContinue reading\n\nOP-ED: Why renewal of Rent Law is not enough\n\nStuyvesant Town tenants Arlene Dabreo and Marina Metalios were among hundreds protesting Airbnb outside City Hall before  a legnthy hearing attended by Airbnb execs, hosts who use the service, tenants and politicians. (Photo by Sabina Mollot)\n\nStuyvesant Town resident Marina Metalios (right) with neighbor\u00a0Arlene Dabreo pictured at an anti-Airbnb rally earlier this year\u00a0(Photo by Sabina Mollot)\n\nBy Marina Metalios\n\nOur rent laws expire on June 15, 2015. At the last ST\/PCV Building Leader meeting in February, we discussed what is at stake. Guest speaker Michael McKee (treasurer, Tenants PAC) explained that if we cannot reduce the phase-out of protections this year it may be too late to do so at the next renewal. The real estate lobby is quite content on a \u201cstraight extender\u201d this June because the rent laws as currently written are doing exactly what the real estate lobby scripted.\n\nThe combo in the current laws of legal rent increases from individual apartment improvements and MCIs and vacancy destabilization are doing yeoman\u2019s work for the real estate lobby. Simply put: Our current laws contain the seeds of their own destruction. Consider this proof: In our last renewal in 2011 the tenant movement wanted a three-year extender only (to get a renewal in the politically advantageous election year of 2014).\n\nBut the real estate lobby wanted a 14-year extender, to 2025! A 14-year extender would have rewarded the real estate lobby richly with minimal exertion. During this time the landlords would have waited patiently, their deregulation plans successfully on auto-pilot. By 2025, so few units would have remained rent-protected that the lobby would have won just by waiting it out. If not \u201cwon\u201d outright they would be close enough to order champagne.\n\nStrengthening our rental protections is detailed in the nine-point \u201cTenant Legislative Platform\u201d of the Real Rent Reform (R3) Campaign and Alliance for Tenant Power (ATP). For more information visit the website.\n\nOf them, the first and #1 most important demand is to repeal vacancy destabilization. (Of the others, the ones which are compelling to our community are repealing the automatic 20 percent vacancy bonus, making MCIs temporary, making preferential rents the base for a rent increase and tightening individual apartment improvement increase calculations.)\n\nYou may say this list is familiar. Yes, we still need to expand tenant protections, despite the 2011 renewal. I say \u201cdespite\u201d because the 2011 renewal was technically the first since the 80s (approximately) during which the rent laws were not shrunk further. Cuomo made a huge gigantic broo-ha-ha deal about his (puny) expansions to our tenant protections in 2011. He strutted about the improvements he engineered that year. But let them be cautionary: the 2011 expansions to the rent laws are almost imperceptible and Cuomo prodigiously fund-raised from real estate during both his elections. In his 2014 re-election he raised more money from landlords than even the Senate Republicans and seven of his 10 biggest donors were landlords or developers.\n\nContinue reading",

        "text":"All Posts By\n\n\nState parks to get steady flow of funding\n\nMustang Island 20050019\n\nNovember 5, 2019\nKRIS | By Seth Kovar\n\nVoters approve Proposition 5\n\nVoters approving Proposition 5 during elections Tuesday means a more predictable level of yearly funding for two state agencies.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely allocated strangely,\u201d voter Amanda Horne said of the previous funding system for Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Texas Historical Commission.\n\nIn 1993, the Texas Legislature voted to allow all tax money from sporting goods sales go to Texas Parks and Wildlife. But it was up to lawmakers to determine how much of that money the agency actually received each budget cycle, and often they diverted a good portion of that pool to other means. Proposition 5 changes that to the delight of Horne.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an avid outdoorsman here in the State of Texas, and I just want to make sure our parks are funded to the fullest extend that they can be,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new system promises Texas Parks and Wildlife 93 percent of all tax money from sales of sporting goods. The remaining 7 percent will go to the Texas Historical Commission which hadn\u2019t previously received that kind of funding.\n\n\u201cProposition Five is wonderful,\u201d Bart Wales of Texas Tropical Trail Region said.\n\nWales\u2019 organization promotes tourism in South Texas, in part, by promoting historical sites.\n\nThe Fulton Mansion is one such site, and it\u2019s run by the Texas Historical Commission.\n\n\u201cSince the Texas Historical Commission has taken (the Fulton Museum) on it has become just a focal point for South Texas and showcasing its history,\u201d Wales said.\n\nThe funding will help both agencies maintain parks and historical sites \u2014 something else Horne is happy to hear.\n\n\u201cThere are so many beautiful places to visit here,\u201d she said.\n\n\nProposition 5 could help fund much needed repairs at Mother Neff State Park\n\nGarner Sp 3950 Hdr 1 1024x463\n\nNovember 6, 2019\nKCENTV | By Andrew Moore\n\nA local state park will finally have a chance to get consistent funding for repairs, thanks to Texas voters passing Proposition 5.\n\nThe proposition will add an amendment to the state constitution that dedicates revenue from sales tax on sporting goods to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Historical Commission for Public Parks and Historic Sites.\n\nJanice Bezanson, Executive Director of the Texas Conservation Alliance, told 6 News that the amendment will make a huge difference for state parks.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of prop 5 is the consistency it creates,\u201d Bezanson said. \u201cWhen the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department never knew from one biennium to the next how much money they were going to have in the next term, they couldn\u2019t plan or initiate capital projects.\u201d\n\nThe Texas legislature has been able to allocate sales tax to sporting goods to Texas parks and historic sites since 1993. The legislature was able to choose how much of the money was allocated every two years. However,only 40 percent of the money has made it to the parks and historic sites since it became available.\n\nBezanson said Texas parks and historic sites could now see a consistent $150 million every year.\n\nWhen a log jam developed at Mother Neff State Park in Central Texas around 2014, Texas Parks and Wildlife spent years searching for a funding source for the then estimated $220,000 project. They eventually had to work with the National Resource Conservation Service under the U.S. Department of Agriculture to fund the project.\n\nThe campsite next to that river still needs to be reconstructed. Silt left by flooding needs to be removed, dying trees need to be cut down and buildings need to be restored. But because of the new amendment, funding will be easier to come by.\n\n\u201cRepairing and constructing buildings is a complicated process that requires assessment, taking bids,\u201d Bezanson said. \u201cThe long term consistency of funding is therefore very important.\u201d\n\nBenzanson told 6 News there is a backlog of park improvement projects across the state of Texas totaling around $800 million, so the additional revenue will be sorely needed.\n\n\u201cThey will be able to plan, and execute a long term gameplan,\u201d Bezanson said.\n\n\n\nFranklin Mountains\n\nConstitutional dedication of Sporting Goods Sales Tax passes\n\nFor Immediate Release\nNovember 5, 2019\n\nAUSTIN\u2014Today, Texans voted overwhelmingly in support of Proposition 5, a constitutional dedication of revenue from the Sporting Good Sales Tax, so those dollars can only be used by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Historical Commission on public parks and historic sites. This amendment will ensure there will be funding to protect Texas water quality, natural areas, beaches, and wildlife, so that our children and grandchildren and future generations can enjoy them the same way we do. It will also create a consistent stream of revenue for the maintenance and long-term planning of state parks and historic sites. Importantly, Proposition 5 will provide the funding to achieve these goals without raising taxes or requiring additional fees.\n\n\u201cTonight, the people of Texas sent a clear message that our state parks and historic sites matter, and they are a vital part of our heritage,\u201d said State Rep. John Cyrier, Chairman of the Culture, Recreation & Tourism Committee in the Texas House. \u201cI was proud to carry the Legislation that put this issue in front of Texas voters. Prop. 5 will ensure that current and future Texans will have the opportunity to enjoy the rich history and culture that our state parks and historic sites afford.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexans have demonstrated their love of our state parks and historic sites with a resounding vote of YES in favor of Proposition 5. The passage of this proposition is important for maintaining, protecting and preserving the land in Texas that\u2019s available for public enjoyment. This proposition was designed to create a positive impact on our environment, our culture and our way of life. The dedicated revenue for our parks and historic sites will ensure these Texas treasures are around for future generations to cherish and enjoy,\u201d said Joseph Fitzsimons, founder of the Texas Coalition for State Parks.\n\nAbout the Texas Coalition for State Parks:\nThe Texas Coalition for State Parks, was launched by a group of former Texas Parks & Wildlife Commissioners and park advocates with the sole purpose of advocating for a constitutional dedication of the Sporting Goods Sales Tax to state parks funding. The Texas Coalition for State Parks PAC has formed to engage voters ahead of the November 5, 2019 election and encourage them to support Proposition 5.

Go vote.\n\nLighthouse Peak\n\nNovember 4, 2019\nAustin American-Statesman | By American-Statesman Editorial Board\n\nYour voice matters. Please use it Tuesday at the ballot box.\n\nThe issues being decided in this election touch our lives: State funding for schools, state parks and cancer research; as well as the use of taxes paid by hotel guests to improve the Austin Convention Center and the Travis County Exposition Center, both of which could bring more visitors and spending to our economy. With one question on the ballot you can even make life easier for retiring police dogs and their caretakers.\n\nHere is a recap of the American-Statesman Editorial Board\u2019s recommendations on the propositions facing voters, with links to the full editorials on each topic.\n\nState constitutional amendments\n\nVote FOR Prop 1 to allow municipal judges to serve multiple cities at once if voters elect them to the bench. This would help smaller towns that don\u2019t need their own full-time judge.\n\nVote FOR Prop 2 to allow the Texas Water Development Board to issue up to $200 million in general obligation bonds to help local governments build and improve water supply and sewer services.\n\nVote FOR Prop 3 to allow residents in a disaster area to be exempt from some or all property taxes for that year.\n\nVote AGAINST Prop 4, a measure that would make it even harder to impose a state income tax, something that is already very unlikely. This measure\u2019s flawed wording could allow courts to kill the business franchise tax, which raises billions of dollars for public education and other programs.\n\nVote FOR Prop 5 to guarantee all sales tax revenue from sporting goods purchases would go toward maintaining state parks and historic sites \u2014 something lawmakers have long promised and largely failed to do.\n\nVote FOR Prop 6 to allow the Legislature to issue another $3 billion in general obligation bonds to fund cancer research and prevention, an effort that is saving lives and generating economic activity for Texas.\n\nVote FOR Prop 7 to allow two agencies \u2014 the State Land Board and the State Board of Education \u2014 to put more of their investment income into a fund that supports school districts.\n\nVote FOR Prop 8 to create a $793 million fund to finance local flood drainage, mitigation and control projects.\n\nVote FOR Prop 9 to ensure precious metals stored at a bullion depository will be exempt from property taxes. No jurisdiction charges such taxes now; keeping it that way will prevent these investments from going out of state.\n\nVote FOR Prop 10 to let law enforcement officers adopt their police dog when the animal retires, cutting through red tape that currently requires a third party to facilitate such adoptions.\n\nTravis County\n\nVote FOR Prop A to allow the county to collect a 2-cent portion of the hotel tax to revamp the Travis County Exposition Center, once Austin is done with the tax. An upgraded Expo Center could be an economic catalyst for a part of Travis County that has been neglected for too long.\n\nCity of Austin\n\nVote AGAINST Prop A, a measure requiring voter approval of any lease of city property for a sports or entertainment venue, and requiring that venue to pay property taxes.

In 2014, for the first time, the Army pulled data from those assessments to help commanders gauge the psychological and physical health of their troops.\n\n\u00a0 The effort produced startlingly negative results. In addition to low optimism and job satisfaction, more than half reported poor nutrition and sleep, and only 14% said they are eating right and getting enough rest.\n\n\u00a0 The Army began a program of positive psychology in 2009 in the midst of two wars and as suicide and mental illness were on the rise. To measure resiliency the Army created a confidential, online questionnaire that all soldiers, including the National Guard and Reserve, must fill out once a year.\n\n\u2014 Forty-eight percent or about 370,000 soldiers showed a lack of commitment to their job or would have chosen another if they had it to do over again. Only 28% felt good about what they do.\n\n\u2014 About 300,000 soldiers or nearly 40% didn\u2019t trust their immediate supervisor or fellow soldiers in their unit or didn\u2019t feel respected or valued. Thirty-two percent felt good about about bosses and peers.\u201d\n\n\nUSA Today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer 10th Mountain Division Soldier Aids Christian Militias Fighting ISIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201d A former 10th Mountain Division soldier is helping Christian militias in Iraq protect their homes from Islamic State group militants.\n\n\u00a0 Brett Felton, who previously served with the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, told a crew from CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that his Christian faith inspired him to travel into the country.\n\n\u201c People say, \u2018You\u2019re crazy for doin\u2019 this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Felton said on the program. \u201cI think people are crazy for not doing their part, to be honest with you.

Riskin said he didn\u2019t need any help from the audience.\n\n\u201c I am being disrespectful because the president of the United States was disrespectful to my prime minister, to my country, to my future and to the future of the world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 Just as Mordechai was focused on saving the Jews of Persia from destruction, he said, so Netanyahu is focused on saving Israel and the world from destruction.\n\n\u00a0 He said more than once throughout his address that he was proud of Netanyahu, and added that he did the right thing in speaking to Congress \u201ceven if it angered Obama.\u201d\n\n\nContinue reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Arab-Israel Alliance\u2019 Leaving Obama Isolated\n\n\n\n\n\u201d Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has jabbed President Barack Obama with a stinging remark that although Israel and the United States are friends, fears of Iran and the ISIS have forged a \u201cnew partnership\u201d of Israel and \u201cmany of our Arab neighbors.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 Netanyahu took the opportunity of being charged with the responsibility to form a new government to say:\n\n\u00a0 We very much appreciate, and will take care to preserve, our alliance with the best of our friends, the United States; however, we will continue to work to prevent the agreement with Iran, an agreement that endangers us, our neighbors and the world. We see eye to eye with many of our Arab neighbors regarding the danger posed by Iran and we also view positively the benefit that this new partnership could have for the region.\n\n\u00a0 The chaos in Yemen has once again embarrassed the Obama administration by exposing another colossal foreign policy failure that has made President Obama increasingly isolated in the region.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 This article from today\u2019s Jewish Press amply demonstrates that our \u201cDear Leader\u201d sides , not with all\u00a0Muslims , but only with the extremist factions \u2026 Iran , Palestinian terror groups and jihadists , while Israel forges alliances with the more moderate Muslims of the mideast in the interests of self-preservation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 One side seeks only to be left in peace while the other works ceaselessly towards a\u00a0Global Caliphate with the active collusion of our \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d \u2026\u00a0President \u201cPeace Prize\u201d , who claims to seek peace in the middle east is in actuality ensuring \u00a0, whether by incompetence or design , that war is coming ala Neville Chamberlain .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Declassifies Report, Exposes Details On Israel\u2019s Nuclear Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201d The United States has just revealed a stunning amount of information on some of Israel\u2019s the most closely guarded secrets: information about its military cooperation with America and 20 years\u2019 worth of details on Israel\u2019s nuclear technology development, up to the 1980s.\n\n\u00a0 The 386-page report, composed in 1987 by the federally funded Institute for Defense Analysis, (an NGO that operates under the Pentagon), is titled \u201cCritical Technological Assessment in Israel and NATO Nations.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 It was declassified by the Pentagon in early February \u2013 but oddly, the report has been redacted so as to black out or withhold everything the Institute wrote on America\u2019s NATO allies \u2013 but to reveal all that American experts assembled in Israel.\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Obama has been\u00a0working diligently on two things since taking office , his golf game and ensuring that no allies ever trust America again .
