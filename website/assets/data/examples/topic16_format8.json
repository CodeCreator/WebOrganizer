        "text":"Review Policy and Disclaimer\n\nAll thoughts and opinions expressed here represent my own. The books I review are books that I have bought, borrowed, or received from an author or publisher for free in exchange for an honest review. I do not get paid to feature books for this blog. I read and rate books because I love to. In that effect, I reserve the right to review what I want, how I want, when I want. I make sure to acknowledge the source or provider of the book at the end of each post.\n\nReviews will be given a 1-5 star (\u2605) rating. Here's how:\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 = Absolutely loved it!\u00a0 My best rating, and on my new favorite book list, a book I will highly recommend to everyone. If this is a series, I will collect\/read the rest of the installment.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 = Enjoyed it!\u00a0A really enjoyable read, I'll recommend it.\u00a0If this is a series, I will collect\/read the rest of the installment.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 = Liked it. Overall, I liked it, but it had a few problems. I may recommend it to a specific person\/audience. \u00a0I may carry on with the series.\n\n\u2605\u2605 = Disliked it. It's disappointing, but not the worst I've ever read. If this is a series, I will not continue reading them.\n\n\u2605 = A total struggle. I really didn't like it, it was very difficult to finish.\n\nYou will rarely see a \"no star\" rating, but I do give that in times when a book was a complete waste of time, and I'd rather not talk about it. Please also note that as much as I can, I post both positive and negative reviews.\n\nIf I say something stupid in the future, you should know that [the] stupidity is mine, and mine alone. You can't have it! \ud83d\ude09 But I reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason whatsoever (abusive, profane, rude, or anonymous comments) \u2013 so keep it polite, please.\n\nReview Requests\n\nI am presently accepting Book Review Requests\u00a0 for Fall and Winter 2021. Requests for Book Spotlights, Cover Reveals, Guest Postings, and Giveaways are welcome too.\u00a0\n\nI'd like you to roam around my blog to get an idea of what goes around and how I post. I am sorry, but I do not read self-help books, textbooks, erotica, or anything with uncensored adult content.\n\nFor your requests, you may reach me through the contact form located below this page. Please provide links to the book cover, book blurb, the author's profile, and picture. I reply through email for further information.\n\nPlease\u00a0read\u00a0this policy carefully.

It is addressed to the growing population of haiku poets worldwide to serve as a reference for the use in composing haiku.\n\nThis database relies heavily on information, images and haiku found in public domains whilst searching the Internet with YAHOO and GOOGLE. I consider this material officially published, like in a book, and will use it as reference material to illustrate and explain a kigo.\nAny copyright material mirrored on these pages is intended for the private personal study of haiku poets or students of Japanese culture only.\nApart from any fair dealing for purposes of study and research, as permitted under the Copyright Law, material will not be used.\nWhen material is copied I give credit to the source directly below the item.\n\nIf you want to contribute your haiku or comments, please post it here\n\nGabi Greve, Haiku Forum\n\nor below any BLOG entry in the comments or email it directly to myself.\n\nThe World Kigo Database is not a haiku magazine.\n\nI do not look for first-publications, I just reference anything that I find on the WWW, and also inlcude first contributions send directly to me. But they can be published elsewhere at any time, that is up to the poet.\nThe kigo database project does not claim any rights for first publications, it is only a reference database.\n\nThe copyright of any haiku included in this database remains with their respective authors.\n\nAll translations are the copyright of the translator.\n\nBecause of the sheer volume of the database, I do not always find the time to ask individual permission of each poet.\n\nIf you (as a copyright owner) feel that your work has been improperly reproduced herein, or misrepresented in any way, or should you feel that I have infringed on your copyright, I kindly ask that you contact me directly with your request to have your material removed.\nIf I have mistakenly omitted a credit, or given an incorrect credit, please e-mail so I can fix it or remove it from this site.\n\nDr. Gabi Greve\nDaruma Museum, GokuRakuAn, Japan\nThe World Kigo Database\n\nInformation and documentation -- Bibliographic references --\nISO 690-2\n\n\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States\n\nYou must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work).\n\n.

Also, she will look at referrals by a client or an editor. Joyce Hart will accept both e-mail and USPS proposals.\n\n\u2022 Jim Hart, Terry Burns, Diana Flegal, Linda Glaz and Andy Scheer are looking at selected first-time authors, published authors and referrals. These agents accept ONLY e-mail submissions per requirements below. No zip files. Please do NOT submit any material that would conflict with the Christian worldview.\n\n\u2022 All e-mail submissions sent to Hartline Agents should be sent as a MS Word doc (or in rich text file format from another word processing program ) attached to an e-mail with \"submission: title, authors name and word count\" in the subject line. A proposal is A SINGLE document, not a collection of files. Place the query letter in the email itself. Do not send the entire proposal in the body of the e-mail or send PDF files. There is a nice checklist to ensure your manuscript is properly formatted that you are welcome to use at the submit page.\n\n\u2022 Our core strength is representing inspirational fiction and non-fiction books for adults. We do not market children's books, short fiction, screenplays, scripts, poetry, or magazine articles. We represent most genres in inspirational or commercial fiction except science fiction and fantasy. We are probably not the right agency to market your literary fiction, nor do we represent books that contain extraordinary violence, unnecessary profanity, or gratuitous sexuality.\n\n\u2022 Hartline works with domestic (living in the United States or Canada) authors ONLY at this time. For information on what we like to see in a submitted proposal please select Fiction guidelines or nonfiction guidelines.\n\nCopyright 2002-...
