Although they found no single precipitant or predictor, they noted striking similarities in the cases, including a high incidence of psychopathology manifested in marital problems, absence of close personal relationships, previous psychotherapy, drug and\/or alcohol abuse, etc. The authors suggest an interaction of personal, peer, and institutional factors as casual in all of these suicides and recommend such improvements in residency programs as providing individual faculty preceptors for each resident and facilitating psychotherapy for troubled residents.\n\nAbstract Teaser\nFigures in this Article\n\nYour Session has timed out.

The word originates from the Latin verb, diverticul\u00e2re\u2014\"to turn aside,\" and may be defined as a saclike protrusion continuous with the lumen of any portion of the urethra. When found in the male, approximately 60 per cent arise from the anterior urethra and may be either congenital or acquired in origin. The acquired group is usually associated with trauma or instrumentation and occurs in the third and fourth decades of life as distinguished from the congenital group which is discovered in the first and second decades. Common factors in the etiology are distal obstruction, infection, and calculus formation. Diverticula arising from the posterior urethra have been described for many years, as in the case described by Rourdillat in 1869 whose patient developed an urethrorectal fistula by erosion\n\n\nSign in\n\nPurchase Options\n\n\u2022\u00a0Buy\u00a0this article\n\u2022\u00a0Subscribe\u00a0to the journal\n\u2022\u00a0Rent\u00a0this article ?\n\nFirst Page Preview\n\nView Large\nFirst page PDF preview\n\n\n\n\nAlso Meets CME requirements for:\nBrowse CME for all U.S. States\nAccreditation Information\nThe American Medical Association is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

In many cases this is followed by public appeals from charities and the announcement of millions of pounds in government aid. In most cases the emergency then fades from view, perhaps leaving the viewer with a sense of unease about the effectiveness of the international response. Large sums of public money are spent on relief; in 2006, $8bn (\u00a35.4bn; \u20ac6.3bn) was provided by the countries that belong to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.1 It is therefore reasonable to ask what happens between emergencies. Specifically, what is being done to improve the international response?\n\n    The human impact of different types of disasters is now well understood, and steady progress has been made with relief techniques and technologies.
