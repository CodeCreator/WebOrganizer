Recent research has revealed that some UK populations are now mild to moderately iodine deficient3,4,5,6 and that this level of deficiency may come with risks to child cognitive development.7\n\nThis article looks at the importance of iodine sufficiency, particularly for pregnant women. It goes through the importance of iodine to our health, the effects of iodine deficiency and the more recent findings that the UK population is at risk of mild to moderate iodine deficiency with subsequent risks to foetal development.\n\nWhat is iodine?\n\nIodine is a mineral, essential to human life. It is found in small amounts in the thyroid gland, and helps make thyroid hormones (thyroxine, T4 and triiodothyroxine, T3), which regulate growth and metabolism.8,9 In foetal life, thyroid hormones are required to ensure the development and growth of organs, particularly development of a baby\u2019s brain before birth and during the critical period of the first two to three years.9\n\nIodine Cycle\n\nPlease login or register to read the rest of the article and to have access to downloads and comments.\n\nWhat do you think?

I am sure I didn\u2019t really understand all that would be required of me as I entered the Navy upon dental school graduation. I knew I would be able to practice dentistry and provide healthcare but I was not ready for strong emotional ties that develop for the men and women who give their lives to protect our freedom.\nMy career started in a small clinic at the Naval Air Station, Lemoore, California. I was able to perform all disciplines of dentistry at this clinic, which I am sure developed my interest in staying a general dentist. During dental school, I did not know exactly what specialty I wanted to pursue and I was glad for the general practice provided me at Lemoore. It solidified my desire to maintain and develop as a general dentist.\nMy naval career started to develop and I was stationed with the Marines and went on deployment with them out of Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. The deployment was what is called a WestPac (Western Pacific) and we did operations in Japan and Australia. I learned a lot about the Marine Corp from this experience and could really appreciate what they do, how hard they work, and the sacrifices they go through to protect our country. I also learned that visiting the dentist was not one of their favorite things to do which helped me to develop a very patient-centered practice \u2013 one that made them comfortable in my chair and one that would let them know how much I care.\nThe Navy also gave me the opportunity for training. I was selected for a 2-year comprehensive dentistry residency. This came after I had been practicing for about 6 years. It came at the perfect time for me professionally and I was able to increase my healthcare and dental knowledge by a huge degree. From this experience I developed my philosophy on total dental care. It also gave me an opportunity to provide \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d dental care and to be able to decide where these modalities fit into a treatment plan. It served me well as I was assigned to several clinics, one where I was the sole provider of care. I had a very good military service reputation by that time and was known for my excellent dental practice. This lead to one of the greatest assignments anyone could have.\nOnly gold members can continue reading.
