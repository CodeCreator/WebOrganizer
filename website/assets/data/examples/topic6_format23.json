Lois is hot on the trail of a missing group of female climbers who are hoping to conquer the peak. But what dangers lurk in k2\u2019s snow-covered caverns \u2013 and can Princess Diana keep the Daily Planet\u2019s intrepid reporter safe?\n\n  \u2022 8.6\n    Comic Watch - Mike Eakins May 20, 2020\n\n    There is a lot going on with Wonder Woman: Agent of Peace #2. We see a great pairing with Wonder Woman and Lois, great environment art, and the uneasiness of everyone is in danger with great fluid movement in the story. Seeing Lois handle herself with such grace in the face of danger was fantastic. This was a great story, plain and simple. Read Full Review\n\n  \u2022 8.0\n    The Fandom Post - Chris Beveridge May 5, 2020\n\n    There's a lot to like here with both story and artwork, just like the previous issue, but I really enjoy the pairing of Diana and Lois more than with Harley. Taking us out of the familiar and putting everyone in danger with an ancient evil keeps things moving fast and fluid here. Sampere and Albarran put together a great K2 with all the ice and inclement weather while also providing for a really strong Diana in costume and action. Lois handles herself perfectly throughout all of this as well and the team did a great job of showing just how solid she is in balancing her capabilities with the heroes who swing into her life on a regular basis. A good story and great artwork that has me looking forward to more. Read Full Review\n\n  \u2022 7.5\n    Comic Book Revolution - Kevin Lainez Apr 29, 2020\n\n    Wonder Woman: Agent Of Peace #2 was a big improvement over the first issue, which was a solid debut by its own merits. Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner did a great job playing to the strengths of Wonder Woman and Lois Lane. Wonder Woman's portrayal in particular stood out as we see how she uses her powers to be a hero during different types of crises.

Graced with heart and strength from its two leads and a game creative team Wonder Woman: Agent of Peace makes a strong case for being the 'DC Showcase' of the new digital slate.

In the beginning, when wonder woman saves all the kids from the typhoon, that was pretty heroic also when Lois thinks to use the helicopter seats to use for insulation for the coat THAT WAS PRETTY SMART. the villain was generic the ways Wonderwoman defeated the beast was kind of meh as well but kinda smart. the art is still nothing that's amazing action tends to feel disconnected. I think there is some SJW undertones somewhere in this book, but I didn't mind too much. Wonderwoman is kinda fuckin boring. Lois still best girl(YOU CAN FITE CUZZZ). not as fu more\n\n  \u2022 8.0\n    Rascal4Hire May 8, 2020\n\n  \u2022 6.5\n    tonpas1989 Apr 29, 2020\n\nReviews for the Week of...",

Both require large orchestral and choral forces, plus a quartet of vocal soloists. Rossini\u2019s hour-long Stabat Mater has the exciting verve and mood changes of Italian opera. Dvorak\u2019s was born of grief for the deaths in infancy of three of his children. This gives his setting a prevailing mood of sadness, though the style of writing (particularly for the soloists) is equally operatic. Given its ninety minutes running time, Dvorak\u2019s Stabat Mater normally occupies an entire concert. In this respect, last Saturday\u2019s fine performance conducted by David Hill was no exception. A pity that the audience was miniscule compared to a capacity house for the Oslo Philharmonic a week earlier. [Note the weather was atrocious though]\n\nDavid Hill\u2019s pacing and dynamic shading allowed this epic work to unfold in luminous orchestral and vocal detail. Balance was generally excellent between the seventy members of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, the organ, Leeds Philharmonic Chorus and St Peter\u2019s Singers \u2013 140 voices singing with consoling warmth and supple power. A carefully blended solo quartet surmounted the vocal challenges inherent in both the ensemble singing and the solo arias. Soprano Elizabeth Atherton soared with beauty and clarity above the orchestral textures. The mellowed timbre of mezzo Catherine Wyn-Rogers, the startling tonal purity of tenor Sam Furness, and the soft-grained bass Wojtek Gierlach all contributed to a performance of powerful emotional impact.\n\nGeoffrey Mogridge\n\nIlkley gazette\n\nGeoffrey Mogridge Ilkley Gazette",

        "text":"Mobirise Web Creator\n\nTheatre: # I Am England\n\nPublished Mon 29 August 2011\n\nTalawa Young Peoples\u2019s Theatre (TYPT) are exploring twenty five years of Black British history and the current social shifts to create a brand new piece of theatre, #I am England.\n\nAuthor \/ Artist\nTalawa Young Peoples\u2019s Theatre (TYPT)\n\n#I Am England\n\n\u201cHear my voice, hear my voice\u201d.\n\nThis message which was superbly expressed by the young people of Talawas\u2019 young people\u2019s theatre is delivered with much character, style and kinetic energy.\n\nHowever whilst their fusion of drama meets performance art both captivates and educates, the obvious limitations caused by time constraints on the entire piece occasionally infuriates at the same time.\n\nFrom the beginning it is obvious this is no mere street performance as the multi-talented team dare to reveal the often unspoken thoughts and opinions on political themes that plague the minds of young Africans in Britain today.\n\nUsing the innovative backdrop of a journey through past, present and future, we are taken through several stunning set pieces in which the young company start digging beyond the headlines and surface interpretations of historic events.\n\nOne such powerful moment is their montage of those that have lost their lives in custody. Another is an acute sketch highlighting the manipulative techniques today\u2019s journalist use to interject political bias into the news. Their analytical breakdown of the damage to Truth in a world where mass media dominates is majestically demonstrated with sufficient research. Indeed it often comes to the fore in humorous renditions of scenarios most people of their generation are likely to be familiar with.\n\nHowever it is here where spectators can experience frustration when engaging scenes that feel a little cut short to make way for eclectic performance pieces, which whilst successful in providing strong transitions from theme to theme, limit the amount of time we have to appreciate the dramatic talent of individual performers.\n\nYet whilst this may prevent any one on the young artists from stealing the stage, it has the benefit of showcasing the strength of the ten strong ensemble. Especially, their ability to work collaboratively in order to express some difficult and very contemporaneous themes such as the recent London Uprisings that metamorphed into nationwide English Riots.\n\nThis was perhaps potently expressed in the closing scene where through some sublime directorship and superb choreography the performers were able to compress their structured time travelling experience into a frenetic conclusion showcasing both the power of youth energy and the potential explosion that is often caused by the failure of those older to listen.\n\nPerhaps it is the timing of this play in the aftermath of 2011\\'s summer of discontent that makes the plays subject matter seem so urgent, perhaps it\u2019s the humorous manner in which the pernicious influence and dreams of abolition is presented in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.\n\nWhatever the reason, there is something very compelling about #I Am England, that is truthful, honest and original. If this is a taster of things to come, olde England is about to face a reality shock when it finally opens its eyes and truly takes a good look in the mirror through the eyes of the next generation.\n\nDevised by TYPT:11\nDirector: Nazli Tabatabai-Khatambakhsh\nAssistant Directors: Stephanie Yamson, Oyin Solebo\nChoreographer: Nadia Iftkhar\n\nCast: Winnie Arhin, Terri Ann Bobb-Baxter, Michelle D\\'Costa, Madeleine Kludje, Aiesha Lindsay, Eugene Osei, Palesa Mokoena, Rona Namudu, Adam Tulloch, Toniche Wallace\nRecent Reviews\n\nExternal Links\nTalawa: #I am England\n\nLigali is not responsible for the content of third party sites\n\nHear our Voice: Rehersal and Performance.

This is the kind of clubby bar that you\u00a0discover by chance. You start the night not knowing anyone and end up inviting\u00a0a dozen new friends\u00a0to your home for\u00a0one final drink. Dark and decadent, it is the most underground bar\u00a0in Havana. It\u2019s like a laboratory where\u00a0a social scientist\u00a0tests his ideas, giving it a unique vibe.\n\nThe staff are always fun, friendly, efficient and never look tired. They party through the night just like their customers. The beer is cold,\u00a0the cocktails are strong and the music always interesting. But the real\u00a0draw here is the rumba. It starts around\u00a010pm and rocks until midnight. It\u2019s a spicy show that really has to be seen to be understood; not the typical tourist rumberos that you sometimes find out here. These guys give it their all. With machetes and knives they\u00a0immerse themselves, and therefore the audience, inside the mysterious universe of Afro-Cuban folklore with a hypnotic effect.

Mountain Heart made me tap my feet, clap my hands, and want to jump up and dance. Slamgrass is the best definition of this Nashville band's sound. A sound that is similar to favorites like Trampled by Turtles and Old Crow Medicine Show with a dash of something from the past. The result is nothing less than astonishment and I am now a new fan.\u00a0\n\n    An opening of a remake of \"Hey Joe\" by Hendrix captured my imagination with possibilities. \u00a0Unexpected in a so called bluegrass environment, I was impressed. \u00a0Hard to believe as it is this was topped by a piano and acoustic version of \"Changes\". \u00a0Along with these new acoustic treasures were old faithfuls of bluegrass such as \"Little Sadie\" and some Tony Rice hits. The show was topped with a cherry by a quartet number at the end; something I had never seen. The final number that was played was my favorite by the band, the Allman Brother's \"Whipping Post\". \u00a0Rocking out on stage, I felt as if I were watching some extremely talented friends jam out. \u00a0The audience interaction with the band members and camaraderie of the band made the setting intimate and fun; a mark of excellent showmen.\u00a0\n\n    The six men that make up Mountain Heart are widely talented and incredibly in touch with their fans. The youngest member, Jake Stargel, is 19 and plays the guitar with a talent beyond his years. Original member Barry Abernathy plays the banjo with only one finger on his left hand and banters with the rest of the band keeping the audience and band light as the show moves on. \u00a0Josh Shilling is the lead vocals and is no doubt talented. \u00a0Singing a song off of his solo album \u201cHurtin\u2019\u201d, I believe was the name; the two men beside me were moved to tears. \u00a0I am a fan of the mandolin and was blown away by the talents of Aaron Ramsey who seems to be a musical genius with a rough southern voice who recorded his solo album alone in his basement. \u00a0Rounding out the band were the fiddler, \u00a0Jim VanCleve, who was the second part of the original band and bass player, Jason Moore, who kept the beat with his upright bass all night.\n\n    Following the concert a meet and greet was held where the band shook hands signed autographs and just hung out. \u00a0I was lucky enough to speak to the band and they expressed their desire to play for Louisville audiences and share their love of all acoustic instruments, which between the six of them, they have mastered. \u00a0I was truly impressed by this Slamgrass Band and hope to see them again soon, this time across the river in the 'Ville.\n\n    Tabitha Hernandez's picture\n\n    About Tabitha Hernandez\n\n    A Louisville implant, I was raised as an Army brat, served in the Navy, and have chosen this great city to live in.

Emily VanCamp's character borders on psychotic, but we still find her compelling and, yes, even sympathetic. The show has only improved, with new foils Tyler (Ashton Holmes) and the real Emily Thorne (Margarita Levieva) raising the stakes significantly.

In 1968, that author was inspired to write the book when he visited that hotel, located in the European mountainous country formerly known as Zubrowka. Once a luxurious hotel, it, in 1968, has fallen on hard times. The author meets the then current owner, M. Zero Moustafa, who recounts the story of how he became the hotel\u2019s owner and why he holds onto it and keeps it open despite it obviously making him no money. Zero\u2019s story begins in 1932, when the hotel was in its golden era. Zero was the novice immigrant lobby boy, who, like all the other hotel staff, was under the guidance of M. Gustave H., the devoted concierge. Gustave aimed to please, he giving the guests whatever they wanted, especially the wealthy blonde women. The story largely revolves around one of those women, the wealthy Madame C\u00e9line Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis \u2013 better known as Mme. D. \u2013 her opportunistic son Dimitri, the bequeathing of a valuable painting called \u201cBoy with Apple\u201d to Gustave, the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death which is initially pinned on Gustave, and the attempts of Zero, his girlfriend \u2013 a baker\u2019s assistant named Agatha \u2013 and others to clear Gustave\u2019s name while Dimitri does whatever he needs to get what he believes is rightfully his, namely the painting.\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel\n\n\u00a0The Grand Budapest Hotel came to me well praised, even though I actually had no idea what it was about or even what kind of film it was. To my surprise it is a hilarious comedy film filled to the brim with cameos from hilariously great actors. I do have to give Adrien Brody a real shout out as I normally will not see any film that he is in. Although he actually makes quite an awesome villain. Add Willem Dafoe to the mix and they are an easily stoppable but a hilarious pair of antagonists.\n\n\n\u00a0I do have to point out that I did not find much wrong with The Grand Budapest Hotel. The film is a comedic masterpiece with an ensemble cast for the ages. If I had to gripe, which I guess I have to, it would have to be how little they touch on the The Author and Zero in later years. I know they used it as a framing tool but still.\n\n\n  \u2022 Ensemble cast.\n  \u2022 Main cast performance s.\n  \u2022 Dialogue.\n  \u2022 Hilarious.\n\n\n  \u2022 Framing Tool.\n\nSCORE: 9 \/ 10\n\nIf you have any suggestions for films\/TV\/Games\/Music\/Anime for me to review, drop me a comment!\n\nRemember: Like Media In Review @\u00a0Follow Media in Review @\n\nAll check out my lengthier video game reviews over at Nerd Bacon Games.",

Season two definitely has the best co-stars like Mather Zickel as Jon\u2019s bodyguard Federal Agent, Eugene Mirman as the Russian hit man Yvgeny Mirminsky and Jerry Minor playing the show\u2019s executive producer Mighty Joe Jon: The Black Blond. Yes, BTW that is what he is called the whole season. Just don\u2019t grow too attached to each character since they are not afraid of killing anyone off and replace them instantly. Which only adds to the laughs!\n\nThe special features include two commentary tracks from Glaser on the first disc.\u00a0 The second disc includes about ten minutes of deleted scenes and about 25 minutes of outtakes.\u00a0 I am a big fan of outtakes and this one definitely takes the cake.\u00a0 It sure does look like filming was a ton of fun.\u00a0 There are two flip books included with include some great behind the scenes and\u00a0 production stills.\u00a0 There is also Glaser\u2019s demo that he used to pitch the show to the studio.\u00a0 It was cool to get to check that out especially since the show\u2019s format was slightly different. Overall if you enjoyed the show, you should race over to the special features for more of the same greatness from the show.\n\nShare this article\n\nSpeak Your Mind\n\nYour email address will not be published.

I have no idea what the name is supposed to mean (if anything), but the final track of sophomore full-length Doppelg\u00e4ngers seems to provide their manifesto: \"Primal Caveman Death Metal\". They sound a lot like their neighbors to the east in Unleashed. It's very simple, pure death metal, without anything technical, and no weird time signatures. Most of it's mid-paced, but they effortlessly shift to much faster tempo and back. The bass is just loud enough and the drums just exciting enough to keep it going, with nice fills that never sound like showing off. The vocals sound like an ordinary human growl, but primal.\n\nIn contrast to Unleashed, however, this music is done in a sense of fun. They may let that sense get slightly out of hand when they let gang vocals creep in on \"The Hunt is On (Sexy Son)\", but the rest of the time it works perfectly. The songs have have head-bobbing rhythms, killer riffs, just-flashy-enough solos, and memorable shout-along choruses. Despite their primitivism, they do show some slight tendencies toward experimentation. \"This Tube Is the Gospel\", with its samples, choir, and female vocals, sounds like a parody of the gospel music you'd hear on a televangelism TV show. Album standout \"The Ubiquitous Cube\" has slow, minimalist, dissonant verses.\n\nThis is the most fun you'll have with death all year.\n\nThe Verdict: Goat the Head have proven that getting more technical and more brutal are not the only ways to make a great death metal album, even in 2010. All it has to be is catchy and fun.\n\noriginally written for http:\/\/fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com\/",

The international film community has long realized that many of the most exciting recent films are being made in Iran, but this change of locale underlines the fact that Farhadi is a world-class filmmaker. His skill and talent as a dramatist, as well as his thematic fascination with family and morality, make him seem like the natural heir to Ingmar Bergman and Anton Chekhov. While The Past is occasionally too melodramatic, it also demonstrates that the filmmaker isn't afraid to expand his approach.\n\nFarhadi is exceptional at creating opening and closing scenes that are not only arresting but are so dense with meaning that they could probably serve as the basis of a film student's thesis. The Past opens with Marie (The Artist's B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo) waiting at the airport for Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa). She sees him through the glass partition and tries to flag him down. He does not see her for a while. Finally, another departing passenger shows Ahmad that Marie is waving at him. He walks up to the glass, and they speak to each other. We cannot hear them, just as they cannot hear each other. Nonetheless, they seem to get the idea of what each other is trying to say, either because they are so familiar with each other that they don't need to understand the particular words or because they are just faking it. As the scene goes outside to the parking lot and into the car Marie has borrowed to pick Ahmad up, we slowly get the context of how they know each other. Are they old friends? Lovers? Husband and wife? Eventually, we realize they are separated spouses and that Ahmad has come back to France from Tehran to complete his divorce with Marie.\n\nThe way this backstory is parceled out, like a mystery being perpetually uncovered, is indicative of how the rest of the film unfolds. As the title makes explicitly clear, Farhadi is most interested in exploring how the events of the past impact the interactions and relationships of his characters currently. Certain late passages of the film are focused specifically on Marie or her new boyfriend\/would-be fiance Samir (Tahar Rahim), but Farhadi mostly sticks to Ahmad's point-of-view, especially in the early going. Since Ahmad has been out of the picture for four years, he is the one who has to do the most detective work. He is the one who must find out why Marie's elder daughter Lucie (Pauline Burlet) is so upset about the impending marriage. He is the one who must gain understanding as to why Samir's young son Fouad (Elyes Aguis) is so unwilling to accept Marie. Even though he has technically made this trip to legally sever all ties with this family, Ahmad, as if by instinct, automatically takes on the role of the mediator and healer. Even once the divorce papers are finalized, he chooses to stick around a little longer -- maybe seeking his own chance to resolve the past.\n\nInevitably, Ahmad's continued presence in the house leads to a series of intrafamilial conflicts and somewhat unsavory revelations. Samir is still married to another woman, who is currently in a coma after a failed suicide attempt nearly a year before. A little more than half of the film deals with guilt and blame shifting between different members of the family over different past actions that may or may not have contributed to the suicide attempt. The plotting in this area sometimes verges on the soap operatic, but Farhadi's thoroughly realistic approach with the actors grounds every choice they make.\n\nThe cast is uniformly excellent. Bejo has been getting a lot of laudatory notices, probably because this is such a 180-degree turn from her work in The Artist, but her acting work is remarkable largely for the way it perfectly blends with that of Rahim, Mosaffa, and the kids. Even Jeanne Jestin, who plays Marie's younger daughter L\u00e9a, a character that seems largely untouched by the turmoil around her until late in the film, seamlessly fits into the ensemble and doesn't just turn in a lazy \"kid's\" performance.\n\nA Separation was in many ways a note-perfect dramatization of emotionally unwieldy situations. With The Past, it seems that Farhadi has chosen to allow certain scenes to give in to that unwieldiness. In the short term, it means that a few moments from this film don't pack the familiar punch, but the willingness to push beyond what has already worked and explore a bit bodes well for potentially more powerful work in the future.\n\nThe Blu-ray\nThe Blu-ray comes enclosed with a DVD copy that has the same language options and bonus features.\n\nThe Video:\nThe AVC-encoded 1080p 1.85:1 image is outstanding. Shot in high-end digital with an Arri Alexa, the film translates to Blu-ray with no apparent issues: no noise, no banding. There is an excellent level of fine detail, realistic skin tones, and an otherwise great reproduction of the earthy, mostly brown-ish color palette.\n\nThe Audio:\nThe disc offers the original DTS-HD MA 5.1 French & Farsi audio track, with optional English subtitles and English SDH. There is no English-dubbed option. The audio track is also top-notch. It is clean and atmospheric. Though the mix doesn't give your sound system as much of a workout as a superhero movie, plenty of attention has been paid to creating a realistic and full soundscape to match the film.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n  \u2022 Audio commentary by writer-director Asghar Farhadi - Spoken in Farsi, with optional English subtitles, this commentary covers a lot. Casual film fans might find themselves overwhelmed in fact, as Farhadi freely explores the thematic, the theoretical, and the technical aspects of his film all at once. A typical stretch goes from Farhadi pointing out visual motifs frequently used in all of his films to him describing how the main set was built. Often, Farhadi illuminates how these elements are linked. Curious filmmakers and film theorists have hit the jackpot.\n\n  \u2022 The Making Of (HD, 26:56) - This is easily my favorite bonus feature included here. In fact, it might be one of the best featurettes I've seen included on a home video release. This short documentary includes the expected on-set footage and interviews but also incorporates fascinating footage from the film's long rehearsal period, showing exercises Farhadi had the actors perform, including improvising scenes from their backstory. It's incredibly interesting, eye-opening, and more thoughtfully made than 99% of the short behind-the-scenes docs that get released.\n\n  \u2022 Director's Guild of America Q&A (HD, 38:30) - An interview with the director taped after a screening at DGA. Farhadi understands most of interviewer Victoria Hochberg's English questions, but he gives his answers through an interpreter. Much of what Farhadi has to say about his creative process is interesting and certainly worth paying attention to, but the delay that comes from hearing him speak and then waiting for the translation gives the whole piece a bit of a draggy feeling.\n\n  \u2022 Trailers for this film and other Sony Pictures Classics coming attractions.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nWhile The Past is a bit slicker than director Asghar Farhadi's earlier work, it is no less gripping or emotionally affecting. The making-of featurette included on the disc is an essential look into the director's unique creative process. The complete package comes Highly Recommended.\n\nJustin Remer is a filmmaker, oddball musician, and frequent wearer of beards.

        "text":"Tuesday, 11 August 2009\n\n\n\"Neyss\" Cdr 2008\n(Deserted Factory)\nComing with its fifth album, this french project emerges with concrete expositions of soundscapes with highest context of ambient atmospheres surrounded by such abysmal desolated passages. the album contains 9 exposition in which the sensations and mental states created by NINTH DESERT are collapsing once again and again to offer us a very interesting purpose from start to finish. Tracks as \"X-Hi\" \"Karn\" offer us vaporous metallic drone transformations with diverse elements and structures which have such specific powerful atmospheres full of subtle feedbacks, creating such hypnotic passages. \"Tern\" and \"Trees\" are other tracks with more dense drone elements and dark experimentations worth to explore. Frenchman Cyril Herry the master mind behind this project, reveal us in such tracks part of his creativity in the fields of experimental drone ambient, with a very amazing release.\"Phos\" is a deep surreal voyage to another dimension, created by such hypnotic atmospheres with such atmospheres coming from the other side, through ambient structures collapsing all the time.\"A.W\" is a vast gathering, including some percussive metallic sounds and elements with so diverse structures.so, in the whole nine compositions created here you shall experience a vast quantity of drone patterns and desolated atmospheres converging into a solid structure representing the amazing surrealistic universe in which floats NINTH DESERT. The album is limited to 150 copies only.\n\n\"Land\" Cd\n\n(Deserted Factory)\n\nA Japanese mutation growing slowly with no limits, infecting minds and infiltrating into destructive psychotic deconstruction creating a massive machinery of disturbing noise nature. Seven compositions with the structural noise defragmentations generating chaotic experimentations which at moments sounds so psychotic in the way as each one of the tracks are created here. At moments music sounds as dense and abrasive as for example on the third track. The whole album has such irrational structures mutating into diverse soundscapes able to exploit your brain due how each definite noise pattern has been put together. \"Land\" is a mutation, a living organism to be experienced in its maximum splendor when exploring in deep way each one of such psychotic virus penetrating slowly your brain. Reverberating pulsations are twisting to generate such abstractive noise executions. A very interesting work by MASAYUKI INAMISHI which surely will impact you in the way as the album is built. A total time of 34:53 minutes of pure psychotic noise experimentations.\n\n\"Herbstrost\" Cd 2008\n\n(Deserted Factory\n\/The Tourette Tapes)\n\nAgain, Daniel Simon, the responsible shape behinds FLUTWACHT surprise us with an impressive release. This time this German Project awakens from limb with dense structures and ambient drone soundscapes generating a very in deep album. The first track is built into such dense ambient passages with an inner atmosphere focused into more harsh and raw than previous works. So the second track is more industrial built into repetitive sounds and some elements remembering the isolation created by FLUTWACHT. the next track returns more into such ambient structures with elements changing here and there, transforming into power electronics soundscapes with so in deep harsh atmospheres. The forth track here is still with such industrial noise patterns but time screaming voices appears to penetrate intensely layer to layer the main structure of the track. The fifth track is a powerful noise adaptation with such raw elements dressing the whole picture of the track.so; the whole tracks are giving you defragmentative elements in which you could experience the abrassive atmospheres created by this German project.

        "text":"\u2022 Julian Fane - Special Forces\n\n    Reviewed by Matthew Jeanes (brainwashed.com)\n\n    <b> Julian Fane <\/b> - Special Forces\n\n    I had been wondering when we'd see the first of the post-Sigur Ros releases to emerge. It's been several years since Iceland's finest wowed listeners just about everywhere and I always imagined that the result would be an avalanche of artists trying to recreate the feeling of being swept up in the epic, weepy tones of bowed guitars and reverb-drenched organs. Julian Fane, a 21-year old Canadian solo artist is the fist thing I've heard that immediately and unquestionably calls forth that otherworldy music from the north, but he does a lot more than that. The release is a bit odd for Planet \u00b5, a label that's made its name more on dancey and not-so-dancey but still beat-centric eclectic electronic artists like Venetian Snares, Jega, Bit_Meddler and so on. Still, there is an undercurrent of strong electronics throughout Special Forces that tips Fane's hand as someone familiar enough with the glitch-beat sound of his contemporaries to know how to pique the \u00b5-Ziq fans' interest. The beats certainly don't take center stage though, as they click and thump under waves of rich and fuzzy synth tones, manipulated acoustic instruments, and occassionally Fane's own voice. It's at this point that my opinion of the record is decidedly split. For most of the tracks, the wintery strings and crackling percussion work well and provide moments of real (and not just emulated) beauty. But when Fane steps in to sing in an unintelligible falsetto, the album tends to derail for me into a place where just sounding like other people's records turns in to trying to recreate them. The first two songs with singing are actually pleasant and well-balanced. While the high-pitched whiny vocal style so reminiscent of Thom Yorke and J\u00f3nsi Birgisson isn't my favorite, it doesn't detract from the lush soundscapes into which Fane plants his voice. However, successive songs with vocals deteriorate quickly into what sounds likea parody\u2014this is Jimmy Fallon's impression of Hopelandic and it's funny, but it's not supposed to be. Thankfully, the vocal tracks are far-outweighed by the rest of the album's solid instrumentals. I can certainly forgive the young composer's few vocal missteps on an otherwise excellent debut on which he has created another perfect winter soundtrack for the broken-hearted.\n\n<< Back to reviews",
