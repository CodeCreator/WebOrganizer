        "text":"5 ways to raise a confident, adventurous child\n\nMia Jenkins, 6, left, hangs on a rope as she swings past Dallas Dockray, 9, who uses a kite as a shield as they act out a superhero movie at the Eureka Villa Adventure Playground in Vale Verde. Dan Watson\/The Signal\nShare on facebook\nShare on twitter\nShare on email\n\nKids need to be adventurous. It\u2019s not so much that they need to be left to their own devices everyday or taken on an expensive trip or family experience every other weekend. But they do need to be given an opportunity to explore \u2014 an important part of any baby or young child\u2019s development.\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time for parents with toddlers, but there also comes the anxiety and hesitation as new parents find themselves having to so \u201cno\u201d when their baby is attempting to find discover a new place a experience a new sensation.\n\nDr. Danielle Flowers, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente, said the ways in which a parent can raise and support a confident child can often stems from the environment the parents provide for their child.\n\n\u201cWe should be taking take cues from the child, but it\u2019s important to provide an environment that supports their sense of discovery,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cThey find discovery anywhere they go, whether its at a park or children\u2019s museum \u2014 basically, anywhere they can see things and touch things. And we should allow them to be more curious.\u201d\n\nAid in discovery\n\nMia Jenkins, 6, crashes into Dylan Vail, 8 as they act out a superhero movie at the Eureka Villa Adventure Playground in Vale Verde. Dan Watson\/The Signal\n\nEncouraging and applauding a baby\u2019s taking measured risks, such as mastering a challenging obstacle \u2014 such as stair climbing or going to the bathroom on their own, or pushing through moments of frustration and failure \u2014 is healthy for the child.\n\n\u201cThe way that we learn how to problem-solve is different if you\u2019re dealing with consequences in the real world,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cFor instance, if your child is playing with a sandcastle outside, it will fall over. Hands-on learning allows them to build up their problem-solving skills and have the confidence they\u2019ll need.\n\nAnother possible opportunity where parents can further support their child\u2019s discovery involves creating teachable moments during everyday life in order to introduce a child to necessary boundaries.\n\nFor instance, if you have a hot mug of tea or coffee but your toddler would like to touch the mug, let them touch the warm area of the cup. By gently allowing them to reach out with their fingertip, and repeat to them that the \u201cmug is hot\u201d in order to help encourage their sense of exploration, reflexes and cognitive skills.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t let them pull down a pot of hot water or be put in a dangerous situation,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cBut, in a safe environment, it\u2019s OK to stumble or make mistakes in a safe way.\u201d\n\nLet babies be free\n\nSanta Clarita Adventure Play founder Jeremiah Dockray, left, supervises as Clementine Wish, 5, and Dylan Vail, 8, right, cut with saws as they work on a playhouse at the Eureka Villa Adventure Playground in Vale Verde. Dan Watson\/The Signal\n\nSome parents might want to believe that gadgets and electronics may be necessary during their child\u2019s playtime, Flowers said. However, she would suggest re-examining those types of toys and possibly walking away from purchasing that many toys who stimulate through lights and sounds.\n\n\u201cWhen you have something like a stick, the child is forced to create everything for what that toys does. It gives them an opportunity to have imaginative play,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cElectronics and tablets are everywhere now, and we want to make sure our kids getting the other experiences.\u201d\n\nAllowing a toddler to explore their natural environment can often lead to a mess, or making your child become wet or dirty. But according to Flowers, these types of free-form playtime adventures can lead to your child developing upon their imagination and independence.\n\n\u201cThey should have the ability to play with where they get wet or dirty,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cLet them play in the water in the summer and build things with their hands.\u201d\n\nEngage the senses\n\nDallas Dockray, 9, pretends to be a superhero at the Eureka Villa Adventure Playground in Vale Verde. Dan Watson\/The Signal\n\nAnother critical aspect to your babies development into becoming an adventurous toddler involves being exposed to new flavors and smells early on.\n\n\u201cI suggest Interacting with your child about experiences such as something like going to a park or a museum,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cAsk them, \u2018How does the grass feel?\u2019 or \u2018What colors are you seeing?\u2019\u201d\n\nOne such example is to allow your baby, typically between 4-7 months, to experience new foods and textures, which can provide a feeling of accomplishment while also exposing him or her to different textures and flavors and then discussing with them what they\u2019re experiencing.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t put them in front of a television; you have to interact with them,\u201d said Flowers.\n\nThe pediatrician went onto say that not only can you take your child to the park or to museums, but you can do things with them from inside your very own home.\n\n\u201cYou can interact with your child through things like books as well, especially touch and feel books,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cYou want to have a conversation with them, plus it helps with vocabulary development.\u201d\n\nProvide early exposure to new places\n\nClementine Wish, 5, runs as she prepares to swing on a rope hanging from a tree branch at the Eureka Villa Adventure Playground in Vale Verde. Dan Watson\/The Signal\n\nAlong with allowing your child to decide on whether to explore within their immediate environment, such as their house or bedroom, but also bringing them to restaurants and other public spaces allows for positive exposure to new places people and sounds.\n\nThese things can, in turn, help build your child\u2019s immune system, encourage social interaction and support development.\n\n\u201cTaking them out can show them how fast the world functions,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cAlso, toddlers by nature are curious and will touch things, so it\u2019s important to expose them to the public \u2026 \u00a0because it also helps their immune system.\u201d\n\nPublic places such as airports, bus stops and train stations can cause parents to feel anxious, but these are opportunities, according to Flowers, to teach children important habits that will help them on down the road.\n\n\u201cI really stress hand washing before meals, and if you\u2019re out and about you can have hand sanitizer,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cThis will help stop spread of the influenza, because we want them to learn (about germs) very early.\u201d\n\nWait a moment\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for parents to step in the moment they see their child start heading for the stairs, scrape their knees or start moving for the steps of the stairs.\n\nInstead of rushing to your child immediately, however, experts have suggested that parents should try pausing, allowing the child to naturally discover his or her limits while, at the same time, managing their own fears and worries.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of this is that it\u2019s so important to be present and not be distracted by our phones, \u00a0said Flowers. \u201cWe need to be present with them so that can can be confident and grow in all their sensory and cognitive interactions through engaging with them.\u201d\n\nThis tactic can allow a young toddler who has shown an propensity to explore an opportunity for social-emotional development with the parent acting as a safety net nearby.\n\nRelated To This Story\n\nLatest NEWS",

        "text":"One thing I hear from many new e-learning developers\u2014especially those who\u2019ve wandered into the e-learning profession unintentionally\u2014is the concern that they\u2019re not creating \u201cgood\u201d e-learning. Setting aside the problems with defining what constitutes \u201cgood,\u201d I\u2019ve found that their worries actually stem from the belief that their work might betray a lack of formal instructional design education or training.\n\nIf this sounds like you, you might wonder what skills you need to create effective and great-looking e-learning. And, once you know what you don\u2019t know, how do you build those skills to improve the quality of your work \u2026 and hopefully, define \u201cgood\u201d for yourself?\n\nThere are lots of e-learning and instructional design skills inventories floating around the web, many of them with lengthy, overlapping lists that feel intimidating. I like to keep things simple, so I\u2019ve zeroed in on five of the biggest, broadest, most critical skills you need for creating better e-learning. From there, I\u2019ll point you to some free resources to help you build those skills and more. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nYou Need Consultative Skills\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got some practical e-learning experience under your belt, it\u2019s time to think about how to position yourself with the project team and business leaders. Are you a trusted partner and collaborator, or do these folks see you as someone who just puts their slides online? Some of the skills that help earn the trust of others include:\n\n  \u2022 Strong business acumen.\u00a0Good designers are results-oriented and take the initiative. They own their expertise, constantly improving their knowledge and skills. They\u2019re also good at objectively balancing the needs of the business, the learners, and the project timeline and budget to get the best results.\n  \u2022 Good communication skills.\u00a0A good designer also\u00a0knows how to think like a savvy business consultant. For instance, when last-minute design changes roll in, they hold trade-off conversations to help decision-makers prioritize needs.\u00a0Even in the face of tough conversations,\u00a0a good designer knows that their role is to present risks and rewards and keep everyone focused on achieving the best outcomes.\n\nBuild the Skills\n\n  \u2022 Study the habits other successful instructional designers have cultivated and try fostering some of them for yourself.\n  \u2022 Build a support network of peers you can turn to for outside perspective and advice. The Building Better Courses forum on E-Learning Heroes is a great resource for virtual networking with fellow peers. You might also find inspiration and support from folks in creative writing, usability or experience design, graphic design, and other related industries.\n\nYou Need Organizational Skills\n\nProjects come and go, each with their own demands on your skills and creativity. But developing organizational skills can improve nearly every aspect of your professional life. Here are a few skills to master in this area:\n\n  \u2022 Task prioritization. Whether you\u2019re a one-person training shop or part of a large team, having the ability to manage your time and prioritize tasks is crucial to staying on top of your workload.\n  \u2022 Basic project management skills. Having an understanding of project management tools and processes can help you stay focused and organized, manage stakeholder expectations, and generally keep your projects on track.\n\nBuild the Skills\n\nYou Need Instructional Design Knowledge\n\nSome of today\u2019s e-learning authoring tools make it easy for nearly anyone to assemble a simple course\u2014but good e-learning is more than just an assembly job. Instructional designers must continuously develop their understanding of how people learn. That\u2019s because instructional design for e-learning is all about transforming raw content into compelling digital experiences that speak to\u00a0learners and motivate\u00a0them to\u00a0perform.\n\nSome additional skills in this area include:\n\n  \u2022 Creative problem-solving. All skilled designers are empathetic, and the same is true of instructional designers. Instructional designers can imagine themselves in the learner\u2019s shoes and find ways to connect with them.\n  \u2022 Concise, precise writing. Skilled instructional designers know how to write compelling and effective copy. Their writing is warm and professional as well as well-structured, focusing on need-to-know information.\n  \u2022 Effective communication skills. Stakeholders and Subject Matter Experts aren\u2019t always able to envision creative ways of presenting training content.\u00a0Skilled instructional designers recognize this challenge and overcome it by showing their clients what they can do, instead of\u00a0just telling them. They can do this by using techniques like prototyping or storyboarding to help build understanding before they invest a lot of time and energy into building a course.\n\nBuild the Skills\n\nYou Need an Eye for Visual Design\n\nWhile you don\u2019t need to be an art major to design great-looking e-learning, it certainly helps. \u00a0That\u2019s because e-learning is a visual medium. And a key part of an e-learning developer\u2019s role is the ability to visualize the course\u2019s user interface, graphics, and interactions.\n\nA few key skills to develop in this area include:\n\n  \u2022 Layout composition. Understanding how to work with course assets and content to create harmonious and balanced layouts is important for enhancing usability for all learners. It\u2019s also helpful to have a sense of concepts like scale and proportion, as well as C.R.A.P.\u2014contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.\n  \u2022 Image sourcing and manipulation. Skilled course creators understand how to use keyword search terms to find the images they need. They also know the basics of manipulating and even creating their own images.\n\nBuild the Skills\n\nYou Need a Little Technical Know-How\n\nBeyond the features and functions of e-learning authoring apps, there are many different technical aspects to e-learning. Things like the creation and use of audio and video, how different web browsers behave, how to troubleshoot a course that\u2019s not behaving as you expected on your Learning Management Systems (LMSs)\u2014all of these are just a few examples. And while you don\u2019t need to be a tech guru to create good e-learning, you should strive to know a few basics, including:\n\n  \u2022 Your learner\u2019s technical needs. There\u2019s no point in designing a fabulous e-learning course full of rich multimedia if your learners have technology or bandwidth limitations that would prevent them from using it.\n  \u2022 How to publish courses. Skilled e-learning developers understand the publishing settings of their authoring apps and how those settings impact the tracking and reporting of the course.\n  \u2022 How to test courses. E-learning isn\u2019t effective if it doesn\u2019t work properly. Testing courses before they\u2019re rolled out to learners is typically part of a more formal quality assurance (QA) process that can help catch everything from typos to broken links or malfunctioning media.\n  \u2022 How to troubleshoot your courses. E-learning pros know that being prepared and following a routine troubleshooting checklist can be a huge timesaver\u2014especially when you\u2019re trying to track down the source of a mysterious technical glitch in the eleventh hour!\n\nBuild the Skills\n\nMore Resources\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a tad overwhelmed by all the skills you need to build, don\u2019t fret! Learning is a journey made much more exciting with a few twists and turns in the road. And wouldn\u2019t you rather be the one in the driver\u2019s seat of your professional development road trip?\n\nWhat other skills have you found to be important in your role as an e-learning developer?

        "text":"Virtual schools and online learning present unprecedented options for students- the type of flexibility and choice that was not on educators\u2019 radar even 10 years ago. But as online options develop for students, it is important to remember the real benefit is for the student. Online learning isn\u2019t meant to save money or slash school budgets (see what\u2019s happening in Kansas this past week) and it is not meant to diminish\u00a0the importance of having a good teacher.\n\nOnline learning needs basically the same amount of funding as brick and mortar and requires just as highly qualified teachers who are dedicated to their students finding success. Online instruction doesn\u2019t lighten a teacher\u2019s workload, it just makes it look a little different. Florida Virtual School, the well-known provider of online learning for middle and high school students, recognizes that teachers are the key to success.\n\nThis week we talked to two of its online educators of the year, Shawn Wigg (HS Math) and Elise Harris (MS Civics) both to whom online learning is not new. They are full-time, online teachers at FLVS and know what it takes for students to succeed in online courses- because they see it every day.\n\nGiving advice to achieve success through online learning could sound very similar to the advice a brick-and-mortar student would hear\u2013 many of the best practices overlap. At the same time, learning online takes some shift in mindset and can present a learning curve for all involved.\n\nHere are the top 10 pieces of advice Shawn and Elise had to share from their own experience as full-time, online teachers:\n\n  1. Provide opportunities for students to collaborate- whether it be through participating in live classes throughout the week or virtually working together on projects. Students need to connect with one another \u2013 and connection encourages investment and participation from students, online as well as in a physical classroom.\n  2. Create a strong \u201ctriangle\u201d of communication\u2013 with the teacher, student and parents. Virtual learning can be like no other experience they have ever had before and students and parents need to know what to expect. Empower the parents with the skills they need to find the data about their students\u2019 progress. Monthly calls keep parents not only informed but excited.\n  3. Keep the student at the center of all decisions\u2013 whether it be the methods of instruction or the digital tools and strategies used in class. There is never one way to do things- get to know your students and cater to their personal needs. Remember, as students change, so will those needs.\n  4. Be prepared for a huge shift in mindset- if leaving the brick-and-mortar classroom to teach online. Online teachers are on call way beyond the traditional classroom hours of 8 am to 3 pm. Online students learn at their pace \u2013 and a huge part of their success is being able to tap into help and support when they need it.\n  5. Have students keep portfolios- and when teaching online those will definitely be virtual portfolios. A favorite for Shawn Wigg and his students is My Big Campus. Students today need to be able to collect and share the best examples of their work as they continue through their education journey.\n  6. Use the tools that make sense for students\u2013 Shawn kept searching for the tools to best support his students within math learning and didn\u2019t stop until he found a prescriptive tool that individualizes the lessons. Elise uses Grom Social to connect with her students- calls and texts are essential, but to add in a safe social network that was actually created by one of her own middle school students has strengthened engagement and relationships she has with her students.\n  7. Recognize the power of positive feedback- because you are not working together in a physical space and facial expressions and body language don\u2019t come into play as much, always remember that verbal positive reinforcement is essential for students. Be generous with it. Elise knows \u201cpositive praise goes a long way!\u201d\n  8. Take full advantage of the schedule\u2013 students should not be afraid of playing with different times to find what works for them. That never happens at a traditional school. Online students can choose their schedule- even tackle one subject a day, if that works best for their learning style.\n  9. Keep exploring new digital tools\u2013 don\u2019t be afraid to adopt new ones. Students can be your number one resource because they are not afraid to grab a new app or tool, experiment, test it and integrate it into their workflow. Teachers can learn so much from the students. Also, search the education section of the app store, go to conferences, reach out to developers and test apps in beta- a lot of times they are free!\n  10. Great professional development is out there\u2013 finding opportunities to learn online helps teachers stay connected to what their own students are experiencing. Through a Teaching American History Grant, Elise improves her practice by attending webinars with top social studies scholars from all over the country and visiting historic sites, all powerful experiences that she shares with her students. Shawn taps into organizations like SimpleK12 and iNACOL that support and offer the best resources for online teaching.\n\nFollowing these tips can help all involved- teachers, parents and, of course, students find success that was not possible before. Teachers like Shawn and Elise connect and work with students from all types of backgrounds and every range of skill set, wanting to improve on their school experience, which is not always easy to provide. But by continuing to build relationships with students and their families and \u00a0using thoughtful and innovative teaching practices, more students improve and grow through learning online.\n\n\nFLVS is a Getting Smart Advocacy Partner.\u00a0\n\n\n  1. The most important in the online learning is encourage the interactivity and use the appropriate tools and applications. Nearpod is a tool that I would recommend personally! It encourages students to participate actively, they look much more engaged, those interactive features certainly change the pace of a lesson.\n\n\nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here",

        "text":"The 22 Most Inspiring Nursing School Photos of 2018\n\n\nAs a nursing student, it can help to connect with others who are in your shoes.\n\n\nOn Instagram, Chamberlain nursing students share their challenges, triumphs, advice and everything in between. They lean on other students and alumni for support throughout their nursing school journey, and celebrate each other\u2019s milestones both big and small.\n\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve chosen 22 nursing school photos that inspired us in 2018! Use #chamberlainuniversity on Instagram to join the conversation in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n  1. \u201cGraduating with the honors of distinction, while pregnant, working full time, and a family definitely wasn\u2019t easy. I am a firm believer that anyone can do what they set their mind to. This wasn\u2019t just for me, but for my family. As I read the words in my card from my daughter, \u2018we\u2019re proud of you\u2019 and from my son \u2018heal the world,\u2019 I can\u2019t help by smile. I only hope to inspire them.

I have had to step outside of my comfort zone not only as a person, but also as a nurse. During our short time here we touched the lives of hundreds of people, and we learned so many things along the way. If there is one thing that I will take with me from Haiti, it is that advocating for your patient is your number one responsibility, and if you do that right everything else will fall into place. Even if I never come back to Haiti, I know a piece of ourselves has been left behind in the education and the care that we provided. #chamberlainuniversity #globalhealth #makeadifference #sna_phx #changetheworld\u201d - @infantnursecoltyn\n\n\n\n\n  3. \u201cHad an AWESOME time on day one of our review sessions in Chicago this weekend!

        "text":"4 Freelance Roles for UK-Based Bilinguals in 2017\n\nThe freelance economy is well and truly on the rise (no matter what tax changes Chancellor Philip Hammond decides to make) and, as a bilingual speaker in the UK, you are perfectly placed to join this growing army of workers.\n\nIn fact, the freelance economy is one of the great success stories of recent years, growing by 25 percent since 2009 and turning over an estimated \u00a3109 billion a year. This has added an estimated \u00a330 billion to UK gross domestic product and contributed much to the growth in employment. Statistics from the Office of National Statistics show that a record 4.63 million, or one-in-seven of the workforce, are now self-employed.\n\nHowever, regardless of what the figures might suggest, life as a freelancer is not for everyone. You lack the security you enjoy as a PAYE employee. There\u2019s no sick pay, no paid holidays and no \u2018training days\u2019 spent nursing a cup of tea. As a freelancer, if you\u2019re not working, you\u2019re not earning. But that doesn\u2019t stop freelancing being a land of opportunity, particularly for those with rare and valuable bilingual skills.\n\nWith that said, here are four freelance roles for UK-based bilinguals in 2017\u2026\n\n1. Translator\n\nIf you have some experience as a translator under your belt then you could access the potentially lucrative freelance translation market. With the right network of clients, marketing strategy and skills, you could earn more as a freelance translator than you typically would working in-house. Of course, you will have to work long hours to build your client base and it could take six months to a year for all your efforts to pay off. However, once you have a regular stream of customers, can keep them happy and make sure you get paid, life as a freelance translator could be pretty good.\n\n2. Customer service agent\n\nCustomer service might not be a role you would typically associate with freelance workers, but there are an increasing number of companies that are looking for freelance bilingual customer service agents who can work from home. These positions range from sales and tech support to full-time roles dealing with inbound customer requests, whether on the phone, via email or through video calls.\n\n3. English-as-a-second-language (ESL) tutor\n\nESL teachers and tutors are in high demand both here in the UK and overseas. In the UK, there are more and more companies looking for individuals who can get their foreign language employees up to speed. You can even teach English from home using a virtual platform. There are also plenty of opportunities overseas for ESL tutors who can find work in the country of their second language, teaching private and corporate clients. You will need some experience and a professional qualification to become an ESL tutor in the UK and abroad. A TEFL certificate is an excellent place to start.\n\n4. Copywriter\n\nIf you have a way with words as well as fluency in two languages, becoming a bilingual copywriter could be a potential freelance route for you. There\u2019s an increasing need for bilingual copywriters as UK-based businesses expand their offerings overseas. As a bilingual copywriter, you may have to write marketing messages in both languages, which can be a big ask. Alternatively, you could be charged with localising English-language marketing assets for an overseas market, or vice-versa. If you have the linguistic skills to fulfil this role, you will be well-rewarded.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer the security of a life as a PAYE employee, we have a number of exceptional bilingual roles for candidates across the English south coast. Please take a look at our latest bilingual vacancies or call 02392 987 765 to discuss your requirements today.",

At a guess, I\u2019d say hundreds, and I bet most of them have said, \u201cI can do better than that!\u201d Well, of course, that may be possible, but then again, it may not. Even if you have a project management qualification, there\u2019s no guarantee you can successfully run a project.\n\nA project manager needs to develop a range of skills to lead a team and manage a project successfully. These core competencies can make a good project manager into an excellent project manager. The theory is one thing; developing those skills through experience and putting them into practice is another matter entirely. We\u2019ve put together our Top 7 project management skills that we believe a project manager needs to develop.\n\n  1. Leadership\n\nA great project manager leads from the front to:\n\n  \u2022 Motivate\n  \u2022 Coach and inspire the team\n  \u2022 Set goals and resolve conflicts\n  \u2022 Evaluate performance\n  \u2022 Ensure they have all the resources needed to complete the job\n  \u2022 Hand out the discipline when needed.\n\n  1. Communication\n\nCommunicating well with not only the team, but also with the clients, suppliers and stakeholders, is an essential skill. Clear, concise, understandable and frequent communication keeps the project on track and ensures that everyone \u2018sings off the same hymn sheet\u2019. In the long term, it helps build relationships and respect.\n\n  1. Planning\n\nHow is any project going to succeed without a plan? Basically, it isn\u2019t, and planning is a key skill that every project manager needs. It\u2019s crucial to organise objectives and goals, ensuring that every phase of the project is reached in a timely manner, and within budget.\n\n  1. Time management\n\nManaging the timescale of a project is a large part of being a project manager. But it\u2019s also important for a project manager to manage their own time too. Learning how to say \u2018no\u2019 and delegate certain tasks will enable a project manager to better manage their own time.\n\n  1. Assessing risk\n\nWhen things don\u2019t go to plan, the first person to get the blame is usually the project manager. Nobody likes a surprise in a project, particularly if it\u2019s not a nice one. Assess the potential risks, work with a team to identify those risks and plan for the possibility it might happen. Doing that will go a long way to averting any surprise.\n\n  1. Negotiation\n\nIt\u2019s important to successfully negotiate budgets, resources, schedules, scope creep, conflicts and delays. Doing all that while maintaining good relationships and not upsetting anyone is a key skill.\n\n  1. Knowledge\n\nTo conduct informed conversations with clients, it\u2019s important to understand:\n\n  \u2022 The platforms and systems being used\n  \u2022 The project\u2019s subject matter (to assess the limitations and risks)\n  \u2022 The technical side of things.\n\nKnowing all this will help the project manager, suppliers, stakeholders and the team.\n\nSo, next time you\u2019re watching The Apprentice and criticising the project manager, take a few moments to assess whether they possess any of the above skills. If they have, they\u2019ll probably succeed.",

        "text":"The latest thinking, news and events from the world of Recruitment\n\n5 Candidate Outreach Methods to Try this Week\n\n\nt\u2019s uncommon to eventually reach a week when activities are slightly out of order and it becomes puzzling trying to find your way back to your regular rhythm. Writers get writer\u2019s block. Recruiters get something more like a hiring block.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to shake up your usual candidate outreach routine, try these tips:\n\nChange the channel.\n\nDid you know that\u00a0over half of candidates\u00a0prefer to be contacted through email than through any other medium, including someone they know? Many recruiters often make the mistake of relying primarily on professional networking sites as their means of communicating with a candidate, who rarely actually open such messages, let alone read through them. Candidates who provide their email convey the message that they\u2019re open to being contacted, allowing your email to be more personalized and direct.\n\nRejig the style of your subject lines.\n\nHere\u2019s the general idea: Keep it short and compliment the candidate. To gain a candidate\u2019s attention, express your interest by personalizing the approach, like mentioning a project or piece of work they created or calling attention to a mutual connection. Candidates are more likely to click through a message that sounds real and personalized than one that\u2019s computer-generated and universal.",

        "text":"3 Most Effective Teaching Methods\n\nEvery generation has a way of absorbing information and applying it in their lives. However, no one teaching method fits all. Every couple of years it is necessary to evaluate the teaching methods as an educator.\n\nThe Classic Approach\n\nAn adage goes that you can take a horse to the river, but you cannot coerce it to drink. The same way, most educators still hold dear the classic \u2018About the Topic\u2019 method of teaching. The problem is that students in the modern age have a reduced attention span, out of the need to get to the next interesting thing.\n\nThe aim is to hold the attention of the student, captivate them, and inspire them to learn more. The era of force-feeding information down and a cane in hand is long gone, and it is time to adopt teaching methods that will work to prepare the next generation of leaders.\n\nLet us look at some of the latest and efficient teaching methods today.\n\nDesire Method\n\nA proven solution is the desired method of teaching. It works by rousing interest in the student beforehand, so that they understand the benefits of whatever you are about to teach. By showing the benefit, you create a desire in the student, and you will have their undivided attention.\n\nPreview Strategy\n\nThe aim of this strategy is to create a level of anticipation for your students before the commencement of a lesson or curriculum. Educators can step off the podium and let the students in the class have a discussion of how the curriculum will shape their lives depending on their career and life goals.\n\nThrough the facilitation of a discussion, you will be able to build up the value, benefits, as well as the pains of the course. At the end of the study period, summarize the views from the students and give a preview of the curriculum and watch as the anticipation grow for them to take the curriculum.\n\nMetacognitive Strategies\n\nBy providing the student t the power to organize through planning and monitoring their work and direct their learning, you are bound to have a more attentive student body. There are three kinds of students, and they fall under the acronym of \u2018VAK.\u2019 This means Visual, Audio, and Kinesthetic. This is to suggest that they learn through seeing of the materials, hearing, and listening to the materials, and feeling of the material.\n\n\nTeaching Methods\n\n\nThis has seen the introduction of technology in classrooms where educators are using PowerPoint presentation and videos as the latest medium for transferring information. By adopting the above teaching methods, your curriculum will make more sense to your students, hence achieving the effectiveness desired.",
