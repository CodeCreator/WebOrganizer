        "text":"6 New Startups Redefining The Educational Space\n\nElena Prokopets\n\nTech startups are creating buzz in transportation, gaming, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors. Everybody knows this. What people may not realize is that technology has a huge impact on the educational space as well. In the first quarter of 2017, ed tech startups already closed over 130 funding deals, making it the highest quarterly deal count for this industry in over a year as CB Insights report. In general, EdTech spend is expected to reach $252 billion by 2020 according to a joint report from EdTechXGlobal and IBIS Capital.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason for such massive growth. Learning models have hardly evolved for the past 150 years, especially in K12 education. We still see a teacher explaining a concept to the class sitting behind desks with most materials being printed textbooks. Yet, modern students are not quite like their peers 150 years ago. They are among the first truly digital generation and they expect the technology to be present in the classroom as well. Next, digital skills are now in demand with over two\u00a0million digital jobs expected to appear in the UK alone by 2020.\n\nThe following six startups\u00a0are already addressing the changing educational landscape. They\u2019re creating ripples and truly disrupting this industry with new solutions.\n\n\nNerdify is, at its core, a personal assistant app. The difference is that the founders of Nerdify have identified college students as their target market. Here, all the assigned assistants are referred to as \u2018nerds\u2019. You can get in touch with one via FB messenger or a quick text to explain what you need. Students submit whatever request they may have \u2013 whether it is just to order a book, get a quick answer to the academic question or get help with more complex tasks\n\nAfter the request is submitted, Nerdify will match you with the ideal nerd for the job. The company lets students know what their nerd can do for them, and how much it will cost.\n\n\nThe topic of literacy is very important to educators. What people may not realize is that it\u2019s a complex issue that goes far beyond whether or not students can read. These days, to be considered truly literate, students must know how to discern facts from opinion, and how to analyze what they read to draw conclusions. Newsela is on the cutting of helping educators create truly literate students.\n\nThey do this by partnering with school districts and providing teachers with grade appropriate, carefully curated articles. This includes current events, technology, and more. Students simply work through the content, then take the assessment provided by Newsela.\n\nTeachers Pay Teachers\n\nTeachers Pay Teachers is an online community and marketplace created solely for educators. It is a place where teachers can share ideas with one another, and even sell educational resources that they have created.\n\nAccording to the website, participating teachers have earned more than 300 million dollars selling items through TPT.\n\n\nGood educators know the value of peer assessments and reviews. Unfortunately, the old method of having students pass their work to one another is a bit haphazard. It\u2019s also difficult for instructors to get good insights. After all, how much can you learn about a student\u2019s progress when they are likely passing their work to someone who is familiar to them?\n\nPeerGrade cuts through all of this by implementing a proven system that allows students to assess one another\u2019s work, and also provides useful feedback to the instructor. It works quite simply. The instructor creates the assignment. The students complete it, and upload it. PeerGrade works for documents, videos, and other content. Finally, PeerGrade distributes the finished assignments for assessment. When the assessments are finished, the instructor receives a final report.\n\nClass Dojo\n\nIn a business, corporate culture is extremely important. It impacts morale, and customers\u2019 perception of the company. When culture is good, people feel respected, that their needs are being met, and that they are heard. This applies to everyone including customers.\n\nLikewise, classroom culture matters as well. The ideal classroom culture encourages communication, ensures that everyone is treated with respect, and provides a safe place for learning. Class Dojo is a platform that uses a variety of tools to help students, parents, and teachers create positive and supportive learning communities.\n\n\nManaging communications between teachers, students, and parents can be difficult. Putting notes into backpacks and hoping they make it home has been proven to be a failed experiment. Virtual backpacks or other solutions that store communications online aren\u2019t very effective either. Parents and students still have to remember to go look for information. Teachers have to remember to keep things updated.\n\nRemind is a communications tool that is safe, secure, and works in real time. Without exchanging phone numbers, Remind gives teachers, students, and parents a way to \u2018text\u2019 one another in real time. This can be used for assignment reminders, for students to ask teachers questions after hours, and to keep the communication flowing between parents and instructors.\n\nEconomics, politics, and a variety of other factors impact what goes on in the classroom. It will be interesting to see where these six up-and-comers are at a year from now.\n\nRead more about budding startups here on Tech.Co\n\nPhoto: Flickr\/Abhishek Baxi\n\nThis article was last updated on:\nDid you find this article helpful?

        "text":"Pages Menu\nCategories Menu\n\nPosted on May 14, 2013 in Featured Slider, Leadership | 2 comments\n\nThe Extra-Divine Guide to Better Communication with Your Team\n\nGet ready! I\u2019m about to offer you 3 lists, each with its own list of 3 (so that you know it\u2019s extra-divinely inspired!!!), on what I consider to be the linchpin of leadership: Communication. Leader-to-team communication has been making or breaking leaders since the dawn of time. And it can take place in a million ways these days (face-to-face, phone, text message, email, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, etc).\u00a0 These principles will apply, no matter which mediums you use to communicate with your team.\n\nDefense Making Plans\n\nWhy Communication:\n\n  1. Gathering and Dispersing Information. This is obvious, isn\u2019t it? Leaders have to initiate communication because nothing gets done without knowledge: \u201cHere\u2019s the next quarter\u2019s schedule.\u201d \u201cPenelope said \u2018no\u2019 to this volunteer opportunity, any suggestions for a next ask?\u201d And so forth\u2026 \u00a0Perhaps the next two reasons for communication will surprise you. They are often unexpected by-products of communication.\n  2. Buy-In.\u00a0 Healthy, consistent communication leads team members to buy in to the leader and into the team mission.\u00a0 At an elementary level, this works because people cannot buy into what they know nothing about. Regular communication allows the opportunity to know you and the mission\u2026and people become devoted to the people and causes they know best.\n  3. Unity. Without clear communication, each team member has their own ideas (or lack thereof) about their role, the team\u2019s role and the leader\u2019s role.\u00a0 This ultimately leads to\u2026well, not much of anything. But clear communication provides a single-minded sense of purpose that can lead to really big wins!\n\n\nBad Communication:\n\n  1. Difficult to read. We didn\u2019t all ace English class but we CAN all write and speak in understandable fashion.\u00a0 That might mean proofreading your email or even having someone proofread for you. With verbal communication, try practicing in front of a mirror or friend.\n  2. Talking to a subordinate. No one likes to be talked down to; no one wants to feel they\u2019re nothing more than a cog in your wheel. Begin by replacing \u201cI\/You\u201d with \u201cUs\/We\u201d.\u00a0 Tell them regularly that you enjoy working with them (sometimes I add \u201ctogether\u201d as emphasis or use a word like \u201calongside\u201d to facilitate feelings of partnership rather than leader\/follower).\n  3. No Communication. Hands-down, no communication is the absolute worst communication. Really??? Really.\u00a0 Even if you called people on your team and cussed them out, at least something would happen (i.e. they all quit your team)! And that\u2019s preferable to wasting good people\u2019s time on a team going nowhere.\n\n\nGood Communication:\n\n  1. Emphasizes key points. In an email format, this could mean using bulleted lists and\/or making key points bold or italicized. Try to focus people\u2019s attention or they\u2019ll be lost in a sea of text.\u00a0 In verbal communication try repeating important items. You can also have them write it down or say it back to you.\n  2. Concise and clear. Sometimes I struggle with this one.\u00a0 Case-in-point, it would be advisable to replace 3 lists of 3 with 1 list of 1!\n  3. Positive and passionate. EVERY TIME you communicate (even when you don\u2019t feel like it; even when you\u2019re tired and weary), your team needs to know that you\u2019re excited about the possibilities and that you believe in their potential to accomplish great things.\n\nWhat\u2019s the hardest part of communication for you?\n\n\n  1. those are great tips I am sure you are encouraging leaders to do their best\n\n    \u2022 Thanks so much!\n\n\n  1. Worship Ministry Value Statements | Blue Collar Worship: Lead Strong - [\u2026] communicate and review them once a year with the team. I don\u2019t even actually expect them to remember or\u2026\n\nPost a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *",

You can also offer your services on Fiverr or reach out to companies and entrepreneurs to pitch them your services. For example, if you like a specific podcast, see if it needs someone to transcribe episodes.

I have a BS in Biochemistry and 1 year of experience as a primary school teacher. And if no, what other areas listed above can I fit in? I love booking reservations and people always tell me they can hear a smile on my face as I talk without them in front of me. I can not find anything in my area to work from home making reservations. I had to leave my current job just last month because of difficulties with a co-worker and the boss could not help with the problem.\n\nData entry jobs are work from anywhere jobs where you are behind a computer or laptop, and you input data \u2013 numbers or any other information such as phone logs into a database.

This number increases substantially when you factor in living in a less expensive area to work remotely full time. Work from home jobs are on the rise and social distancing is only accelerating this trend. I have been in dropshipping biz registered in my state for the last 3 years and can\u2019t really get it moving. It is an amazing post and you explained it in a detailed way. I like Airbnb because it allows hosts to be pretty hands-off if they wish. You can communicate with guests via the app\u2019s texting feature, and you can also set up your own check-in process with a lockbox or similar setup if you aren\u2019t around.\n\n  \u2022 In my blogs my sentences will be shorter as most people skim first to catch a glimpse of seeing something that they want to read.\n  \u2022 This is called a passive income strategy, or a deferred income strategy.\n  \u2022 The expense of setting up an office may include laptops, printers, internet service, cellphones, business cards, web hosting, business services, and software.\n  \u2022 Transcriptionists take audio and video content and turn it into written text.\n  \u2022 They also look for proofreaders who have basic knowledge in programs such as Mircosoft and Google Docs.\n\nMany people these days are learning all about Facebook Ads and figuring out ways to create ads that sell. They then pitch their services to large brands with the idea that they\u2019ll create an ad on Facebook that will increase revenue for that company. FlexJobs is one of the top websites for finding remote work \u2013 there are over 50 job categories!\n\nAffiliation Products\n\nIf you are sociable, great at persuading people and know how to sell well, a good option may be to resell products to your friends, family and neighbors. Of course, in order to do this, you must have an appropriate environment to welcome your students into your home. But if you don\u2019t have it, you can create online classes with video lessons. Good writing is a great quality to have when working online. If you like or are good at it, you can always become a freelancer writer or, of course, write your own blog. A copywriter needs to study a lot about persuasion techniques and sales psychology, once her pieces will be used to generate profit for people who have hired this service.\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer a more flexible teaching job, consider tutoring through Education First or VIPKid. You get to set your own hours, and there\u2019s no lesson planning involved. They provide the lesson materials and communicate with the parents; all you need is a laptop and a desire to help teach children. Thanks for the message and sorry to hear that you think teaching online is a scam. It definitely isn\u2019t a scam and there are thousands of people earning a living from teaching .\n\nYou can also find work-from-home jobs by cold calling or emailing businesses in your area, friends who are business owners, or connecting with businesses on social media.

Here are 10 tips to start your first semester right.\n\n\n1. Manage your time. Accept that you can\u2019t do everything and be everywhere during the first few weeks of school. Prioritize what\u2019s important to you and what is likely to affect the rest of your freshman year. Strike a good balance between studying and socializing and keep revisiting the issue.\n\n\n2. Ask good questions. You\u2019ll meet new people every hour of every day for your first week. Try to learn more about the people you\u2019re introduced to before you start talking about yourself. Demonstrate your interest in what they\u2019re saying, doing and where they\u2019re from.\n\n\n3. Get organized. Create some structure in your life. Put your keys in the same place every night and find a convenient place for your papers, books and computer so you don\u2019t have to search for what you need.\n\n\n4. Explore on and off campus. Make sure you know how to get back to your dorm from anywhere on campus. Test your sense of direction and be certain you know how long it takes to get to different buildings so you are not late for classes, labs or meetings.\n\n5. Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Watch what you eat, especially that first week when free junk food abounds. Get enough sleep, and exercise at least four times a week, even if it\u2019s just a walk around campus.\n\n\n6. Check out quiet places to study. Find indoor and outdoor study spaces where you won\u2019t be distracted. It\u2019s a fun challenge.\n\n\n7. Find friends with common interests. Identifying with a few students early on really helps ease the adjustment. You can get involved with a club, religious group, dorm buddies, high school friends or class.\n\n\n8. Set up a budget. Students will earn the respect of parents and friends if they can live within a reasonable budget.\n\n\n9. Bring a solid DVD collection. Some nights it will be nice to just hang in and get to know your roommates and other new friends.\n\n\n10. Don\u2019t pledge Greek life. Pledging in the first few days of school can be socially traumatic. You are much better off waiting until spring if your college offers that option. Go out, have fun, but trust your instincts and don\u2019t go crazy.\n\nWalk around, talk to strangers, get a feel for college life and don\u2019t rush into commitments of any kind.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Star Tribune",

Most likely, you\u2019re picturing retail jobs, with a special focus on the kind that require you to wear elf ears and striped stockings.\nseasonal jobs\nImage Credit: Kim Bost\n\nWhile retail gigs can be an excellent way to make some extra money during the holiday season, they\u2019re far from the only show in town. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re out of the running, just because your career has progressed past entry-level work or your temperament isn\u2019t suited for dealing with crowds of kids who definitely belong on the Naughty List.\n\n\u201cSeasonal jobs can be a great strategy for professionals to supplement income during the holiday season, and there is a wide variety of opportunities for seasonal work \u2014 from ski instructor to tax associate to election worker,\u201d said Sara Sutton Fell, Founder and CEO of FlexJobs, in a press release. \u201cBut beyond that, seasonal jobs can also be a great way to gain experience and skills, build upon your resume, provide a foot in the door with a company to a permanent position.\u201d\n\nRecently, FlexJobs ran a list of 15 seasonal job opportunities that popped up in their database \u2014 and only one of them involved learning the names of all eight (nine \u2014 sorry, Rudolph) of Santa\u2019s reindeer.\n\nDo You Know What You're Worth?\n\nHere are few jobs you might not know about:\n\n  1. Election Clerk\n\nIf you\u2019re organized and efficient, and interested in participating in the democratic process beyond just casting your own vote, this temporary, part-time gig might appeal.\n\n  1. Seasonal Sports Instructors\n\nFlexJobs\u2019 list offers opportunities for Ski Instructors and Fly Casting Instructors, but those are only two of many possibilities. If you\u2019re experienced in your sport and a good teacher, this might be a perfect way to enjoy one of your favorite hobbies, make a little money, and help others connect with something you love.\n\n  1. Tax Associate\n\nTax season feels a long way off, but it\u2019s never too early for tax professionals, who can start finding their perfect seasonal gig now.\n\n  1. Admissions Reader\n\nWait, isn\u2019t school already in session? It is, but since many colleges and universities have rolling admissions and\/or transfer students, opportunities for Readers are seasonal but ongoing.\n\n  1. Human Resources Administrator\n\nSomeone has to vet and hire all this temporary help, so it\u2019s no wonder that some HR departments find themselves in need of temps to screen the temps, so to speak. If you\u2019re an HR professional and between full-time jobs, this might be the perfect way to keep your own resume from developing gaps.\n\nTo find temporary jobs in these and other categories, check out FlexJobs\u2019 list.\n\nTell Us What You Think\n\nHave you worked at a temporary seasonal job \u2014 and if so, was it a good experience?

        "text":"10 Reasons Indigenous Students Should Consider Syracuse University\n\nAre you looking for a college or university with a strong Indigenous community? Syracuse University is consistently recognized as an institution that leads the nation in Indigenous academic programs and student support services.\n\nRead on to discover a few of the reasons why Admissions Counselor and Native American Liaison Tammy Bluewolf-Kennedy believes Syracuse might be a great fit for you!\n\nStudents celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day on campus.\nStudents celebrate Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day on campus.\n  1. Syracuse University sits on Onondaga Nation ancestral homelands in the heart of Haudenosaunee territory with several Haudenosaunee communities nearby to provide support and ceremony.\n  2. The University\u2019s adoption of and commitment to the Haudenosaunee Promise Scholarship, Honor Scholarship and Indigenous Pathways Grant help make a Syracuse education affordable for Indigenous students.\n\n    The Haudenosaunee flag flies next to the Syracuse University flag on the Quad.\n    The Haudenosaunee flag flies next to the Syracuse University flag on the Quad.\n  3. The University community shows respect and value for its partnership with the Onondaga Nation through adoption of a Land Acknowledgement that is read before all major events and by flying the Haudenosaunee Confederacy flag on campus.\n  4. Take part in Syracuse\u2019s Native Student Program, which offers a home away from home for students and whose dedicated Indigenous faculty and staff, including Assistant Director of the Native Student Program, Office of Multicultural Affairs Regina Jones, are present to mentor and support you through your academic career.\n  5. Syracuse officially recognizes Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day and Native Heritage Month with special events, speakers and presentations that celebrate Indigenous cultures and traditions.\n  6. Students, no matter what they are studying, can pursue an academic minor in Native American and Indigenous Studies or a certificate in Iroquois Linguistics.\n  7. Seeking counseling or group therapy? Request to work with an Indigenous counselor through Syracuse\u2019s Barnes Center at the Arch, who provides culturally appropriate mental health support.\n  8. Join a tight-knit community of Indigenous students who hail from across North and South America and pursue leadership experience through student groups like Indigenous Students at Syracuse (ISAS).\n  9. Request to live in the Indigenous Living Learning Community (LLC) in Haven Hall and attend Indigenous festivals, campus lectures and social activities with fellow LLC students.\n  10. Graduates become part of Syracuse\u2019s Ongwehonwe Alumni Association, an ever-growing group of Indigenous Orange alumni!\n\nQ&A with Maris Jacobs \u201919\n\nStudents at the early orientation sponsored by the University's Native Students Program.\nStudents at the early orientation sponsored by the University\u2019s Native Students Program.\n\nDid you know that Syracuse University\u2019s picturesque campus sits on over 720 acres of ancestral Onondaga land? The Onondaga Nation are the Firekeepers of the Haudenosanuee Confederacy, which is made up of six Indigenous nations: the Mohawk, Oneida, Tuscarora, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca.\n\nIn addition to the land acknowledgement read at the start of official University events, Syracuse also pays tribute to the Onondaga Nation and the Haudenosaunee people through the Haudenosaunee Promise Scholarship, Native Students Program (NSP), and Native American and Indigenous Studies minor. Learn more about these programs and more from Maris Jacobs \u201919, below!\n\nMeet Maris Jacobs \u201819\nHometown: Kahnaw\u00e0:ke Mohawk Territory (just outside of Montreal, Quebec)\nMajor: Communication and Rhetorical Studies with a minor in Nutrition\n\nMaris Jacobs '19. Photo courtesy of Maris Jacobs.\nMaris Jacobs \u201919. Photo courtesy of Maris Jacobs.\n\nWhy did you choose to attend Syracuse?\nI knew very little about Syracuse before I was admitted! I knew of two other girls from my hometown studying at Syracuse who applied after learning about the Haudenosaunee Promise Scholarship. Looking back, the Native Student Program (NSP), Indigenous Living Learning Community (ILLC), and Indigenous Students at Syracuse organization (ISAS) were what made my time at Syracuse meaningful. In them I found a community of people I could depend on when I needed help and also felt like I had found a place I was meant to be!\n\nWhat was your transition to life at Syracuse like?\nI was anticipating a slow start to making connections and friends, but the ILLC and NSP made it much easier on myself and my family. It\u2019s very easy to feel alone in a place you don\u2019t know surrounded by thousands of strangers. I\u2019m thankful that SU had programs that helped me find a living situation that I was comfortable with.\n\nI also attended NSP\u2019s early orientation program along with all the other freshmen who were staying on the ILLC floor in Haven Hall. I got to know everyone I\u2019d be living with as well as some of the staff. By the end of orientation, I felt like we had been friends our whole lives. It was exactly what I needed.\n\nWhat were you involved with on campus?\nThroughout my time at Syracuse I was actively involved in NSP and ISAS! I also studied abroad in Florence, Italy during a six-week summer program.\n\nISAS is a way for students to become more involved on campus through a community that recognizes the importance of maintaining an Indigenous presence at Syracuse. We plan and organize events for Indigenous Peoples Day, Native Heritage Month, and host speakers and special guests that the entire University community can enjoy, as well.\n\nStudents tabling on the quad in recognition of Indigenous Peoples' Day.\nStudents tabling on the quad in recognition of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\n\nThe longer I participated in ISAS, the more I felt I could contribute, and I eventually held the role of president. Some of my responsibilities were to organize meetings, execute ideas and ensure that we got as many people involved in our programs and events as possible. I started to take on more responsibility in my junior year because I loved being a part of planning and brainstorming activities. I just wanted to see things keep improving and my role as president was all about how I could turn the input of others into something we could all share together.\n\nWhat was a typical day like for you on campus?\nIn between classes, you could almost always find me at 113 Euclid Avenue, home of the NSP. The shared office and lounge space for the NSP is where lots of students would stop to take a breather during the day. It became my home base for most of my time spent at Syracuse. If I wasn\u2019t taking a nap or catching up on homework, I was eating PB&J sandwiches and telling stories with friends!\n\nSo much of our ISAS\u2019 programming is run out of 113 Euclid and it is important that it\u2019s a place we can use to feel ourselves. NSP and ISAS\u2019 Fall Connections, Identity Series, beading club, planning committees, guest speakers, and meeting are all held here, and it is also where the office of Regina Jones, advisor\/director of NSP is located. Regina, along with Tammy Bluewolf-Kennedy, our Native liaison in the Office of Admissions, are two great members of the Indigenous faculty and staff on campus who are continuously enhancing our programs! They have been amazing resources and really helped me be successful at Syracuse.\n\nWhat advice would you give to prospective Indigenous students regarding attending Syracuse?\n\nStudents celebrating at the Native Students' Program\/Haudenosaunee Promise graduation ceremony. Photo courtesy of Maris Jacobs '19.\nStudents celebrating at the Native Students\u2019 Program\/Haudenosaunee Promise graduation ceremony. Photo courtesy of Maris Jacobs \u201919.\n\nI would encourage all students to stop by 113 Euclid for a visit with Regina and a chance to meet other Indigenous students. When I started my journey at SU, I had no intention of becoming president of anything. My involvement in ISAS was something that grew out of friendship and a desire to feel like part of a community. You won\u2019t regret the bonds you will make with other students like you. By the end of your time at Syracuse, you will have a whole network of people behind you whether they are students, faculty, or staff.",

        "text":"3 Most Effective Teaching Methods\n\nEvery generation has a way of absorbing information and applying it in their lives. However, no one teaching method fits all. Every couple of years it is necessary to evaluate the teaching methods as an educator.\n\nThe Classic Approach\n\nAn adage goes that you can take a horse to the river, but you cannot coerce it to drink. The same way, most educators still hold dear the classic \u2018About the Topic\u2019 method of teaching. The problem is that students in the modern age have a reduced attention span, out of the need to get to the next interesting thing.\n\nThe aim is to hold the attention of the student, captivate them, and inspire them to learn more. The era of force-feeding information down and a cane in hand is long gone, and it is time to adopt teaching methods that will work to prepare the next generation of leaders.\n\nLet us look at some of the latest and efficient teaching methods today.\n\nDesire Method\n\nA proven solution is the desired method of teaching. It works by rousing interest in the student beforehand, so that they understand the benefits of whatever you are about to teach. By showing the benefit, you create a desire in the student, and you will have their undivided attention.\n\nPreview Strategy\n\nThe aim of this strategy is to create a level of anticipation for your students before the commencement of a lesson or curriculum. Educators can step off the podium and let the students in the class have a discussion of how the curriculum will shape their lives depending on their career and life goals.\n\nThrough the facilitation of a discussion, you will be able to build up the value, benefits, as well as the pains of the course. At the end of the study period, summarize the views from the students and give a preview of the curriculum and watch as the anticipation grow for them to take the curriculum.\n\nMetacognitive Strategies\n\nBy providing the student t the power to organize through planning and monitoring their work and direct their learning, you are bound to have a more attentive student body. There are three kinds of students, and they fall under the acronym of \u2018VAK.\u2019 This means Visual, Audio, and Kinesthetic. This is to suggest that they learn through seeing of the materials, hearing, and listening to the materials, and feeling of the material.\n\n\nTeaching Methods\n\n\nThis has seen the introduction of technology in classrooms where educators are using PowerPoint presentation and videos as the latest medium for transferring information. By adopting the above teaching methods, your curriculum will make more sense to your students, hence achieving the effectiveness desired.",

        "text":"\u201cWhen you listen with empathy to another person, you give that person psychological air.\u201d by Stephen R. Covey\n\nDeveloping Social Emotional Learning (SEL) skills within students is not only one of the most important ways that classrooms and schools can raise student achievement scores but the skills also prepare students for life.\u00a0Here are my favorite ways to integrate social emotional learning into the classroom at any grade level:\n\n  1. Morning Check In: Greeting students at the door and gauging how they are entering can help reshape a students day. When you see a students demeanor different,\u00a0you can have them step aside to find out whats wrong and how you can help turn their day around. This not only shows you care but also can allow for less disruptions in the classroom. For younger grades you can make a chart and have them tap the feeling that they are having. such as happy, sad, etc with pictures to help them recognize their feelings.\n  2. Read Alouds:\u00a0Reading aloud stories that have\u00a0social-emotional themes help student understand situations. Read aloud for the younger grades can be pictures books and for older grades can be chapter books.\n  3. Morning Meeting\/Advisory Time: Holding morning meeting is a great way to start off the day and build classroom culture. Having SEL activities as part of morning meeting makes them even better. For older students, I usually call it advisor time. This time set aside empower all of your students with a voice and allows ownership of their learning environment.\n\nOther great resources:\n\nASCD: Whole Child Initiative\u00a0\n\n\nCharacter Lab\n\nWhat\u2019s New with Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) in 2018\n\n13 Powerful SEL Activities\n\n8 Apps for SEL\n\nCommon Sense: SEL Resources\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

        "text":"6 words you need to scratch off your r\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\nCover credit: Flickr\n\nCover credit: Flickr\n\nAfter walking you through the five r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u00a0mistakes no one should be making in 2016, we've compiled a list of excessively overused words and expressions that you better do without for a better chance to impress potential employers.\n\n1. Goal digger\n\nUnless you consciously intend to sound like an inspirational 2012 Tumblr quote, you should think twice (more like a hundred thousand times) before adding this once-clever-pun-turned-futile-internet-buzzword to your CV. It's like the unnecessarily sophisticated successor of \u2018result-oriented\u2019, which in turn serves as an outdated corporate clich\u00e9.\n\n2. Various\n\nSpecificity is the number one rule when it comes to modern-day resumes. And \u2018various\u2019 is the number one enemy of this rule. So instead of spamming your job descriptions with vague expressions of the \u2018worked on various projects\u2019 type, why not clearly identify the number or nature of these projects\/tasks for added credibility.\n\n3. Creative\n\nFor one thing, creativity is better proven than stated. Whoever is reviewing your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can eventually get a sense of your creativity through job descriptions and other small details. Redirect your efforts toward these instead.\n\n4. Out of the box\n\nI not only do not understand why job seekers still include this nauseatingly tedious clich\u00e9 in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but have also come to develop a similar allergy to its use in the course of everyday conversation because of how diluted\/meaningless it has become. Definite red flag here. You are highly advised to move away as far as possible.\n\n5. Multitasker\n\nThe word is a regular occurrence in both r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and job postings. And it has just been overtly used to the point where it no longer bears any significance whatsoever. Let's just say it has been ridden of every last bit of meaning due to its excessive and often superfluous use in the corporate world. You must've worked on more than just one task during your previous job, right? No need to state the obvious.\n\n6. Microsoft Office\n\nSeriously why would a 21st century job seeker list basic computer knowledge as an actual skill on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9? How is this still relevant to our times in any way? An even more flagrant goof would be to list the programs one by one \u00e0 la 2006.",

        "text":"10 Things to Add to Your Resume to Make It Outstanding\n\nIn: How To\n\nLet\u2019s face it \u2013 most resumes look pretty much the same. They use similar corporate language like \u201cwork effectively under pressure\u201d or \u201cpossess a strong business acumen\u201d. The structure doesn\u2019t allow much space for creativity either: a career summary, work experience, education and skills. Let alone the fact that the bureaucratic format of a traditional resume doesn\u2019t allow you to show your human side to the hiring person. So, how on earth under these circumstances do you make a resume stand out?\n\nAlthough resume writing offers limited options for creativity, it\u2019s still possible to get yours noticed. You simply need to make an extra effort and do one of the things the majority of other job-seekers won\u2019t. In today\u2019s post, we are going to reveal the 10 creative solutions you can apply to your resume.\n\nA quick note: if you have no time to learn how to write a resume, consider finding a professional writer. Resumeperk.com has online writers with years of experience and a knack for quality writing. Our writers use a personal approach to identify the career needs of each client and write a resume that better serves those needs.\n\n10 creative hints to make your resume stand out\n\nQuality writing is the king. Yet, every perfectly written resume will benefit from these 10 things you can add to a resume right now:\n\n  1. \u00a0A LinkedIn profile URL\n    Despite the fact that nearly every professional has a LinkedIn profile these days, many still don\u2019t add a link to it in a resume. You shouldn\u2019t neglect to do it for two reasons. Firstly, the hiring manager will look up for your profile online anyway, and you will save their time and show your transparency. And secondly, unlike the resume, LinkedIn allows you to show your personality. This social media encourages less formal language and allows adding multimedia content. An attractive LinkedIn page can give you more chances for an interview.\n    By the way, our LinkedIn profile writer has shared his tips on filling out your profile effectively. Check them out here: http:\/\/resumeperk.com\/blog\/tips--tricks-for-professional-linkedin-profile-writing.\n  2. Blocks of color\n    We always advise our readers to use the color carefully in their resumes. Most traditional recruiters are against bright formatting. Yet, there\u2019s no denying the fact that big blocks of pastel, grey or black color on the white page immediately captures the eye. Use this trick on your resume and you\u2019ll see the difference. You can highlight the header of the paper, summary sections, or skills. Just make sure that the text reads well on the colored background. Calm shades don\u2019t irritate the eye as the bright ones do, so such a resume can be used to apply for all kinds of jobs.\n    Need a bit of inspiration to get started? Use our hints for creativity increasing.\n  3. Framing statements for the employers\n    Do you know one of the biggest struggles for the hiring manager reading your resume? Figuring out how your experience aligns with their company. And your job title isn\u2019t of much help: the \u2018Account manager\u2019 title implies different responsibilities depending on if it was a small business or a big corporation. The solution? Add the framing statement for each employer, indicating the industry, annual turnover, number of directs or other information you deem significant. Here\u2019s the example: \u201cXYZ company, the #2 shoe retailer in Nebraska with 500+ employees\u201d. This certainly gives the context for your responsibilities and achievements, doesn\u2019t it?\n  4. Explanations a for job change\n    One of the traditional resume rules states: do not give reasons for quitting the job. Yet if this reason was positive, why not use this trick to make even a stronger impression and sell yourself better? If you were promoted, hunted by another company or quit to pursue an MBA with a prestigious school, those are all good reasons. The company has been acquired? That\u2019s an acceptable explanation too.\n  5. Personal brand\n    Your personal brand is 2-3 core competencies or career interests where you bring maximal value to the table. It shows your unique strengths that differentiate you from other applicants. The best place to show your personal brand in a resume is your career summary. Ideally, it should tell your professional story simply yet powerfully. Many candidates tend to show off everything they\u2019ve got without branding themselves, so those who have a personal brand immediately get noticed. Of course, if you are a recent graduate or career changer, you might not care about it much; yet for senior-level professionals, a strong personal brand is a must.\n  6. Name-dropping\n    All resume specialists recommend removing the irrelevant or too old information to make your resume shorter. There\u2019s some truth in it; but if your earlier experience is connected with the famous name in the industry, keep it. If your career trajectory was quite average yet you had an internship with Google ten years ago, this fact alone can secure you an interview. So, if you were associated with a loud company name, even if it was a temporary gig, take full advantage of it.\n    To make that resume truly perfect, have a second set of eyes to proofread it. If you need resume editing services, our expert can fix the minor issues in your document and make your writing flawless.\n  7. Timeline or infographic\n    Many creative resume templates use infographics. Although we don\u2019t recommend using the resume template you\u2019ve found on some website, adding graphic elements to your resume might be helpful. You can visualize your career trajectory, show the revenue you\u2019ve brought in as a chart, or rate your proficiency with hard skills. If you are in programming, creative design or marketing industry, consider setting yourself apart with a pure infographic resume. this kind of resume presents most of your resume information in the form of pictures, graphs, charts and more. Here are the benefits of using an infographic resume: http:\/\/resumeperk.com\/blog\/our-new-service-custom-infographic-resume-writing.\n  8. A link to your video resume\n    Just like the infographic resumes, video resumes are on the rise. Their biggest benefit is that the video allows you to communicate your body language and show your appearance. A dry and formal resume language doesn\u2019t allow that. Meanwhile, we collect most of the information about the person non-verbally. So, attaching a link to your video resume not only shows your creativity, but also increases your chances to get liked by the hiring person.\n  9. \u00a0QR code\n    If you send in a paper resume, add a quick response code somewhere in the corner. If scanned, this code may lead to your LinkedIn page, a professional website or blog, or your online portfolio. The interactive element will keep the recruiter interesting, and you won\u2019t have to overload the resume with excessive information. This trick is rarely used, so your odds of standing out with this one are pretty high.\n  10. A testimony from a previous employer or client\n    Sometimes one or two testimonials from your employer or client work more than your bragging about your achievements. The principle is the same as with LinkedIn \u2013 ask someone you\u2019ve worked with to give you honest feedback and outline your professional strengths and personality traits. Quotes in the resume will immediately catch the eye, and the positive comment from the business owner will form a positive impression about you immediately. If you are a freelancer looking to find a good job for writer, use feedback from your previous client.\n\nThese techniques are rarely used but extremely effective for getting your resume noticed. Of course, you don\u2019t need to use them one at a time \u2013 choose the ones which apply to your career situation and will work best for the format of your resume.\n\nGet your resume updated by a pro resume writer\n\nIf writing isn\u2019t your cup of tea yet you don\u2019t want to be left unnoticed by the recruiters, consider collaborating with a certified resume writer. All writers of Resumeperk com possess at least 1 year of resume writing expertise and excel at creating resumes for all career levels.

        "text":"10 productivity books that let you earn back time\n\nEstimated Reading Time: 3 minutes, 24s. It\u2019s pretty skimmable, though.\n\n\nPodcast Length: 29 minutes, 30s (link to play podcast at bottom of post).\n\nThe Amazon links below are affiliate links\u2014I get a cut of sales. I\u2019ll be donating what I make to the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nThe best productivity books more than pay for themselves: they teach you how to save time, so you more than earn back the time you spend inside them. So which productivity books will help you out the most?\n\nHere are 10 of my absolute favorites\u2014with a mini review of each one, with what you\u2019ll get out of reading each book.\n\nGetting Things Done, by David Allen\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: Getting Things Done is bigger than a book\u2014\u00a0 \u00a0it\u2019s a bona fide movement. If you find it hard to focus\u00a0 \u00a0because your mind is cluttered\u2014with tasks, commitments,\u00a0 \u00a0and other obligations\u2014pick this book up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Also worthwhile: the Getting Things Done Workbook, which\u00a0 \u00a0serves as a good companion to the main book.\u00a0\n\nLinchpin, by Seth Godin\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: This book will teach you how to stand out at\u00a0 \u00a0work\u2014regardless of whether you work for someone or for\u00a0 \u00a0yourself. Linchpin provides you with a blueprint for\u00a0 \u00a0becoming indispensable, regardless of what your \u201cart\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0happens to be.\n\nI Know How She Does It, by Laura Vanderkam\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: The concept behind this book is fascinating:\u00a0 \u00a0Laura Vanderkam pored through the detailed time logs of\u00a0 \u00a0highly-successful women who have kids at home, who also\u00a0 \u00a0make over $100,000 a year. In the book, she shares the tips\u00a0 \u00a0she learned from these women, including the importance of\u00a0 \u00a0sleep, and what time wasters they didn\u2019t invest in (like\u00a0 \u00a0watching hardly any TV).\n\nOff the Clock, by Laura Vanderkam\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: Another fantastic book from Laura\u00a0 \u00a0Vanderkam, Off the Clock makes the case that, regardless of\u00a0 \u00a0how busy we are, we have more time than we think we do. I\u00a0 \u00a0walked away with countless strategies for developing\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0deeper relationships and indulging in more intentional\u00a0 \u00a0relaxation.\n\nDeep Work, by Cal Newport\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: Deep Work digs into how we should structure\u00a0 \u00a0our days in order to be most productive\u2014and makes the\u00a0 \u00a0compelling case that, when we do knowledge work for a\u00a0 \u00a0living, the ability to focus on cognitively-demanding tasks is\u00a0 \u00a0one of the most powerful skills we can develop. This book i\u00a0 \u00a0isn\u2019t just worth reading once\u2014it\u2019s worth reading each time\u00a0 \u00a0you find yourself surrounded by an increased number of\u00a0 \u00a0distractions.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of when authors include their own books in these roundups, so I don\u2019t. If you\u2019re looking for some reading beyond the books on this list, though, here\u2019s a link to my books!\n\nThe Upside of Stress, by Kelly McGonigal\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: As Kelly McGonigal explores in the book,\u00a0 \u00a0stress is not always a bad thing\u2014if harnessed correctly,\u00a0 \u00a0stressful situations can lead us to experience a more\u00a0 \u00a0meaningful life. The Upside of Stress is an engaging,\u00a0 \u00a0counterintuitive book that will change how you think about\u00a0 \u00a0stress\u2014as well as the challenges you face in general.\n\nHow Not to Die, by Michael Greger\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: This book may add years to your life. In How\u00a0 \u00a0Not to Die, Michael Greger explores the foods we should be\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0eating in order to live the longest\u2014and everything in the\u00a0 \u00a0book is backed up by scores of academic research. This is\u00a0 \u00a0what makes Greger\u2019s books unique: he starts with the\u00a0 \u00a0science, and works backwards to how we should live our\u00a0 \u00a0lives in order to take advantage of the latest research.\n\nAtomic Habits, by James Clear\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: If you\u2019re able to buy just one book about\u00a0 \u00a0habits, make it Atomic Habits. This book provides you with a\u00a0 \u00a0comprehensive overview of how habits work, and the latest\u00a0 \u00a0science behind forming new habits and breaking old ones\u2014\u00a0 \u00a0Atomic Habits is one of the most comprehensive guides to\u00a0 \u00a0forming new habits available.\n\nRapt, by Winnifred Gallagher\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: This book, by Winnifred Gallagher, explores\u00a0 \u00a0how we can manage our attention in order to become\u00a0 \u00a0happier. Years after reading Rapt, its lessons stick with me. If\u00a0 \u00a0you\u2019re looking for ways to become more present in your life,\u00a0 \u00a0this book is a great place to start.\n\nMindset, by Carol Dweck\n\n\u00a0Mini Review: Mindset, by Carol Dweck, is another classic\u00a0 \u00a0productivity book. It explores how we can develop a \u201cgrowth\u00a0 \u00a0mindset\u201d\u2014how we can see ourselves as someone capable of\u00a0 \u00a0great change. The book not only digs into what a growth\u00a0 \u00a0mindset is, it also explores how we can develop one in our\u00a0 \u00a0own lives.\n\nComments are closed.\n\nPin It on Pinterest\n\nEmail sucks.

        "text":"2017 Colleges with the Best Student Life\u00a0in America\n\nThe 2017 Colleges with the Best Student Life ranking is based on student reviews and statistics from the U.S. Department of Education. Top-ranked colleges have a positive, fun, and friendly student culture and a vibrant campus community.\nSee how this ranking was calculated\n  \u2022 National\n  \u2022 By State\nViewing 1-25 of 100\n  1. 1\n\n    University of Southern California\n\n    \u2022 Los Angeles, CA\n    \u2022 3,302 reviews\n    College Sophomore:It feels extremely personal. There are opportunities everywhere and especially as an engineer we're encouraged to mix and match the parts of USC that matter to us. For me, I work on campus doing research, I'm head of a club, I'm a student ambassador, I'm in a design club and that's my life within the school. But someone else in my major is on the varsity hocket team, in totally different clubs etc. So life here feels extremely personalized and I like that. The school also has a ridiculous amount of resources for its students, at least within engineering. There is so much energy put into the well-being of the students that it always feels like you have a strong support network.\n\n    Fight on!\n    More about University of Southern California\n  2. 2\n\n    University of Michigan - Ann Arbor\n\n    \u2022 Ann Arbor, MI\n    \u2022 3,751 reviews\n    College Sophomore:Well I'm currently studying at the University of Michigan, which is known for its business and engineering programs. But I'm currently triple-majoring in Linguistics, Spanish, and Japanese. And I am constantly impressed by just how amazing our faculty is here. In almost every department, there is at least one professor that is a leading contributor in his\/her field. I've taken several classes where the textbook that we use to structure the class was written by the professor him\/herself.\n\n    I personally have never attended another school, but I assume that this is very atypical for colleges. And it's something that I take pride in as a Wolverine. One of our slogans here is \"the leaders and the best\". Now I will admit that I can see the pride, and perhaps the arrogance as well, in this statement, but I find it to be quite fitting. I came to Michigan because it's a university taught by the best, for the best.\n    More about University of Michigan - Ann Arbor\n  3. 3\n\n    University of Georgia\n\n    \u2022 Athens, GA\n    \u2022 4,748 reviews\n    College Junior:UGA is a really nice school and the city of the Athens is the best. There are so many people your age around you, so it's really fun and since it's a big school, there's literally something for everyone. There's even a furry's club and a medieval sword fighting club. That's how diverse the school is!\n    More about University of Georgia\n  4. 4\n\n    University of Texas - Austin\n\n    \u2022 Austin, TX\n    \u2022 5,339 reviews\n    College Sophomore:This university has it all. There are over 1000 clubs you can join so there is something for everyone if they want to get involved. There are such a wide range of majors that it's easy to find something that fits what you want to do. The professors are always so passionate about what they teach and you can tell they genuinely care about their students. They always make sure to explain things clearly and offer more than enough opportunities to reach them outside of class hours. The advisors on campus are life savers, I wouldn't have been able to navigate this far without their amazing help. This university really makes me feel like my needs are important instead of feeling like just another student out of 50,000. The people are friendly, the culture is fantastic, and the school is stellar. I couldn't see myself attending anywhere else.\n    More about University of Texas - Austin\n  5. 5\n\n    University of Wisconsin\n\n    \u2022 Madison, WI\n    \u2022 2,811 reviews\n    College Sophomore:This was my dream school and I know by the atmosphere it's where I belong. There are so many interesting courses to take and areas to explore. Overall, it is a fantastic school.\n    More about University of Wisconsin\n  6. 6\n\n    University of California - Los Angeles\n\n    \u2022 Los Angeles, CA\n    \u2022 4,386 reviews\n    College Sophomore:UCLA's historical reputation for research contributes to an extremely positive aura around the school. The job opportunities are many; and so is the alumni network.\n    More about University of California - Los Angeles\n  7. 7\n\n    University of Virginia\n\n    \u2022 Charlottesville, VA\n    \u2022 2,002 reviews\n    College Sophomore:I absolutely adore my school. There is not a day that goes by that I don't walk to class, finding new reasons to be grateful for choosing it. The combination of history, academics, athletics, social scene and opportunities is one that cannot be compared.\n    More about University of Virginia\n  8. 8\n\n    Rice University\n\n    \u2022 Houston, TX\n    \u2022 960 reviews\n    College Sophomore:I'm incredibly happy with my decision to come to Rice. It's a small campus, so you'll have pretty small class sizes (max 150 for intro STEM classes, once you get past those its usually 15-40 people in a class) and personal relationships with your professors. It's pretty easy to make friends since you see a lot of familiar faces everywhere and you'll see a lot of the same people at events you're interested in (i.e. make sports friends at athletic events, party friends when you go out, school friends in classes- and a lot of these overlap). Rice academics very heavily favors the natural sciences, then social sciences, then humanities. That being said, there are still humanities majors at Rice, they just aren't as dominant as engineers or pre-meds. Students here really (really) care about doing well, so sometimes you'll get caught up in the \"Rice bubble\" where there's a lot of pressure to do everything (i.e. be involved in a ton of clubs, hold leadership positions, and get great grades), but as long as you learn to balance and keep thing in perspective you'll be fine. Professors aren't trying to fail you, students help each other, and it's a lot of fun. I would very highly recommend Rice, it's an amazing experience and I've learned so much.\n    More about Rice University\n  9. 9\n\n    Stanford University\n\n    \u2022 Stanford, CA\n    \u2022 1,083 reviews\n    College Sophomore:Stanford is truly the most amazing place in the world. Before my freshman year I never felt like a really had a home, but I have finally found one at the Farm. The academics are amazing and the people are even better. While I wish that the financial aid was better I still stand by my decision to attend because the experience I am having is priceless.\n    More about Stanford University\n  10. 10\n\n    Virginia Tech\n\n    \u2022 Blacksburg, VA\n    \u2022 3,379 reviews\n    College Sophomore:Virginia Tech may be one of the best decisions I've made in my life. The people I've met, the experiences I've had, and the environment in general is one that can't be beat. I gladly call Tech my home away from home, and when I'm not there I want to be there, when I am there, I don't want to leave. Tech has great academic programs, it's an easy place to make a ton of friends and have fun, a great place to live, and best of all it's been rated one of the most fit campuses in the states.

        "text":"\n\nHow To Succeed At Everything You Do\n\nSuccess comes to those who dare to start, so lazy people never make a difference in the world. Free resources spark initiation and change across the globe.\n\n1. The One Success Secret You Already Know\n\nMost of us want success in our careers, families, and lives. Lazy people wait for miraculous signs. But, people who make a difference should start taking their first steps.\n\nThe uncertain journey to Secret success is sweet if we know changing tracks is inevitable. For, we never know what choices lie ahead until we approach.\n\nLearning occurs when we ask questions and ponder answers. Accessible free resources promote self-learning, and those may suit one better than college or university.\n\nBriefly, those that start well succeed more often. Therefore, start well now. Sloth is a grave mistake if you want to succeed or be happy.\n\n2. Change: Adapting to Succeed\n\nAdapting to Succeed\nPhoto by Ian Kim on Unsplash\n\nWe each have our limited skill sets, and we are all flawed. However, the fear of failure should not overtake the defining human skill to adapt.\n\nHuman proficiency is a curve. Hence, we change and meet our expectations. We cannot know how we do things without trying them with heart. Trying new things makes us fulfilled. Therefore, the time to try our hands at things is now.\n\nHowever, we should keep options for if we face repeating failure. Sometimes pressure corners us. Then we need to follow up on an out. For this, we need to know that our position is not permanent.\n\n3. Keeping an Out\n\nComplete career changes are uncommon, but those that can steer toward a fresh direction are brave. Likewise, you must know when to change tracks, because there are no signboards on the road to success.\n\nEntrepreneurs bring unknowns to the masses. It is all about putting yourself out there as a brand. For example, you cannot rise to a General if you do not enrol in the army first.\n\nAs glory ends, so changes a period of humble beginnings into bigger things. In fact, eminent people respect those who work petty jobs; they stay fulfilled with little.\u00a0\n\nStanding on your own feet is an arduous task that takes dedication and time. Those who accomplish this feat are ready for the challenges of life.\n\nThe road to being successful forks many times, but you should not confuse yourself. Focus on your current task. At the end of every road, a happy future awaits.\u00ad\u00ad\n\n4. Self-Education: Free Resources That Bring Success\n\nPhoto by Vlada Karpovich from Pexels\n\nWe are lucky to have myriads of opportunities. Now the school has jumped the bounds of school, and education is easier than dreamt.\n\nNow, education is of three types: formal, informal, and non-formal. The education we receive\/d at school, college, or university is formal education. Again, knitting, which we often learn from family, is part of informal education. By contrast, education saves the school, e.g. boy scouts, adult courses, programs, etc., is non-formal.\n\nInformal education has been the same for a long time, and formal education guides us. Yet, unsung non-formal education upholds the most natural learning experience: that of self-education.\u00a0\n\nBesides, in non-formal or self-education, we may ask as many questions as we want and get feedback. Though automation hastens the process, a human touch still stays.\u00a0\n\nMoreover, unlike chalk on blackboards, online resources stay up forever.\n\n5. Self-Education\u2019s Benefits\n\nNon-formal education helps you become successful in your field in two ways. First, it lets you start in any field with a strong footing and make career changes without direct consequences.\u00a0\n\nNext, you have control over your study pace and may try out many paths you like, at once.\n\n6. Find Free Resources\n\nSome school sites, e.g. Coursera, EdX, Saylor Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, etc., teach slews of themes. These are the best online hubs of learners like us.\u00a0\n\nThe openness of these gives you mobility and flexibility. Besides, free, mobile, and video resources always help you take those first leaps.\n\nCollege may not be for you, and half-hearted learning bears no fruit. If you confide in non-formal education, invest your time into an effective start.\n\n7. A Good Start: Success\u2019s Open Secret\n\nGood Start\nPhoto by olia danilevich from Pexels\n\nThe open secret that makes you successful faster: do not be lazy. If you know these magic words, no man or thing can ever block your way.\n\nStarting takes courage, especially when trying unconventional ventures. From adapting to change to educating yourself, everything starts with one swift decision to start.\u00a0\n\nWhether you decide with wit or on a whim is up to you, but remember the consequences.\n\nThe universe will not give miraculous cues for you to start. Instead, we all must quit the common sin of laziness. Lazy people not only stir chaos in society but also doom their future selves.\n\n8. Why Start Now\n\nThe waiting man does not succeed easily. For instance, a man that waits for supreme chances loses to whoever knows the lay of the land. Beginnings are humble and messier than reckoned, but we must start somewhere.\n\nNow we know that we can change our learning path at any time using resources at absolutely no cost. Thus, those can aid education for anyone from school, college, or university and develop versatile skills.\n\nTherefore, start today\u2013start now. You must complete your first works with the little you have and then build your success on it.\u00a0\n\nSoon your customers will pay you for your labour or make you a big name in your industry. However, to make this happen, you must first stop being lazy and procrastinating.\n\nWith all these accessible free resources at our fingertips, the wise have already started and failed many times over. You must dare to fail if you hope to be successful.\n\n\nsuccess secrets\nPhoto by Andrea Piacquadio from Pexels\n\nThere are two kinds of success secrets: those hidden away in the minds of creative millionaires and open ones. \u201cDo not be lazy\u201d is an open secret to being successful.\n\nNobody can keep you from making a needed career change. Hence, keep a back-up plan for you and\/or your family.\n\nGive up being ultra-classy, and experience the free online resources of today, the diamonds in the rough. For, they will surely help you get ahead.\n\nThe start of a career can make or break it. Therefore, get back on the horse, and conquer the world\u2013but first, stop being lazy! Different people have different meanings of success.\u00a0\n\nIf you feel that you are not successful, then probably you haven\u2019t discovered yourself. Stop looking outside. Start looking inside.\n\nOnce you begin an inward journey, you do not need to copy others. You will find something that you love. Indeed, the first step is difficult.\u00a0\n\nBut, once you cross the barrier, there is no one to stop you. Forget being lazy for once, and witness the world bloom into a domain of happiness forever.\n\nLeave a Comment",

        "text":"6 Training Challenges of the Manufacturing Industry \u2013 How eLearning Can Help\n\n6 Training Challenges of the Manufacturing Industry - How eLearning Can Help\n\nThe manufacturing sector\u2019s contribution is crucial for any country\u2019s economy. Innovative manufacturing practices are coming up due to emerging technology trends. Employees have to be trained on new technology in automated manufacturing facilities. They always won\u2019t have the time for classroom training due to their regular work. So, you could try online training.\n\nFrequent release of new products, compliance regulations, employee skill gaps are some of the major challenges I can think of. Let\u2019s see how you can solve them with the help of eLearning.\n\n1. Widening of Skills Gap\n\nChallenge: The major issue in the manufacturing sector is that industries look for multi-skilled employees who can perform various tasks, while many workers in the manufacturing are unskilled and not so tech savvy or have only been trained to do a single job function. Skills gap is a gap between what employers need and what job seekers have.\n\nHow eLearning can help: E-learning can change the way workplace training programs are being conducted by offering easier, more affordable & flexible access to learning resources. Your workforce can take the training at their own pace in the specific skills they need to improve. Other employees can concentrate on their development areas through online learning.\n\nE-learning courses combine visual elements such as videos, infographics, and animations with proven instructional design strategies to deliver knowledge effectively. They improve learner engagement and knowledge retention.\n\n2. High Costs of Training\n\nChallenge: Based on the skills that are needed, manufacturing training programs in classrooms can be very expensive. It can take a long time and the extensive involvement of trainers and supervisors to teach employees the necessary skills and processes for a manufacturing job. Your company has to spend a lot of man-hours for Instructor-led Training (ILT). Logistical costs will be higher in bringing employees from various places for training in a central location.\n\nHow eLearning can help: To keep training costs minimum, it is a good to provide some part of your employee training as eLearning courses. Online training provides a more cost-effective alternative to ILT\/classroom training due to reduced travel, boarding, lodging, and trainer costs. This approach is also more flexible, enabling learning out of working hours and consistent updates to course content, based on new systems and industry guidelines.\n\nYou can teach difficult skills to some extent in the classroom and some parts though online training. In a way, blended learning works well for manufacturing training.\n\n3. Training New Hires\n\nChallenge: Experienced employees have high demand in the job market. So attrition rates are obviously more. New employees keep joining at different levels and in different locations. Training a handful of new hires whenever they join is a cumbersome process.\n\nHow eLearning can help: Online induction training has immense benefits as it is time saving, cost-effective, a robust process, easy for learners, and has high success rates. Once an online onboarding is in place, you can roll it out to new hires as and when they join \u2013 across locations, departments, and levels.\n\nYou can start the online induction training with a video\/audio welcome message from your company\u2019s CEO, introducing the board of directors and other senior employees, through online learning portal. Provide short bursts of microlearning and digestible modules to prevent new hires from getting lost in the \u2018sea\u2019 of information. Plan you training activities in such a way that senior employees share their expertise and experience with the new hires. This helps new employees gain the much-needed skills for their day-to-day tasks on the job.\n\n4. Training Blue Collared Workers\n\nChallenge: The majority of the employees in the manufacturing sector are blue collared workers. Getting work done through them is difficult as literacy levels are low. Understanding new concepts, principles, and learning new skills will take time for them. Training them on safety and regulatory compliance is a major challenge organizations face often.\n\nHow eLearning can help: There\u2019s no doubt that classroom training works best for them. However, eLearning also works when you do it right. Its engaging nature, learner-friendly delivery formats, flexibility, self-pace, and other interesting features make it a hot favorite for blue collared workers. You can have a virtual instructor, online safety training videos, infographics, and other delivery formats with more visuals & less text to make it more appealing.\n\n5. Wide Product Portfolio\n\nChallenge: Companies and employees in the manufacturing industry are under constant pressure to release new products, update the existing products, conduct research & innovation for better products throughout the year. When lost in their regular work without training, your employees may not innovate and make better products or build a portfolio over time.\n\nHow eLearning can help: Explaining the steps of product development such as assessing the need, research, ideas, prototypes, final design, and testing in a classroom session can be overwhelming and increases cognitive load on your employees. You cannot expect them to perfect the various phases of product design in one go. Bite-sized online modules won\u2019t rob your employees\u2019 time and contribute to reinforcing the entire product development process by teaching one step at a time. This works as a refresher training in addition to what they had learned earlier.\n\n6. Stringent Compliance Norms & Regulations\n\nChallenge: Staying complaint is mandatory in manufacturing industries. Training employees on procedures, laws, and regulations is a daunting task. When government updates the existing norms, employees must be aware and up-to-date. Most employees don\u2019t like compliance training because of its dos & don\u2019ts and legal nature.\n\nHow eLearning can help: To make your compliance training more engaging, create online courses on the new regulations and how they impact your business. You can create eLearning courses on compliance, based on the employee roles.\n\nFor example, senior management may just need an overview while employees in the operations department might have to know the regulations in a greater depth. You can easily manage this without additional costs in online modules.\n\nYour organization must also comply with environmental regulations. Employees at all levels of your organization must know the consequences of violations. Online compliance training uses visual media such as videos that have an appealing impact on your employees. For example, a video that shows the consequences of disposing manufacturing waste into rivers can create awareness on environmental concerns. Similarly, a bite-sized module on the best practices for managing waste can let your employees learn faster and better.\n\nThough, you can\u2019t replace the traditional classroom training completely, you can definitely consider online training to overcome the discussed challenges. Hope the available options in eLearning help you facilitate quick knowledge transfer to defeat the training challenges.",
