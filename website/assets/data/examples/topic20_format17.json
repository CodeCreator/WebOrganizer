        "text":"I need to put a point at the intersection of two edges. Below is a picture with red circles around where I need points to be placed.\n\n\nWith Blender 2.8+ you can use the Auto Merge Tool to insert a vertex between intersecting edges.\n\nenter image description here\n\nJust enable the option Auto Merge and Split Edges & Faces in the Tool Shelf, then select a vertex and move it. Upon placing it down the tool will create vertices between the connected edges and the edges intersecting them.\n\nIf you don't want to move any vertices just select one, press G to move and confirm with left click without altering the position.\n\n  \u2022 2\n    $\\begingroup$ This is most definitely the best solution now! Thank you for making me aware of it. If you want to make sure to not move it at all, G Z 0 Enter would be the safest way to avoid moving it even a pixel. $\\endgroup$\n    \u2013\u00a0Keavon\n    Jul 26 '20 at 21:34\n\nIf all you really want is to add a vertex at the position of intersection, then something like this script would work: (this even adds the vertex at the projected intersection of two lines, or the closest point if they never intersect)\n\nimport bmesh\nimport bpy\nfrom mathutils import geometry\n\ndef add_vertex_to_intersection():\n\n    obj = bpy.context.object\n    me = obj.data\n    bm = bmesh.from_edit_mesh(me)\n\n    edges = [e for e in bm.edges if e.select]\n\n    if len(edges) == 2:\n        [[v1, v2], [v3, v4]] = [[v.co for v in e.verts] for e in edges]\n\n        iv = geometry.intersect_line_line(v1, v2, v3, v4)\n        iv = (iv[0] + iv[1]) \/ 2\n\n\nthis does not attach the vertex to any edges\/faces. Here it is packaged as an addon accessible from: W > Place vertex at intersection\n\nThis is now part of mesh_tinyCAD\n\nA while back I added this feature to mesh_tinyCAD, and called it (Vertex to Intersection) V2X. I use it to add guide-vertices to intersections and it is less potentially destructive than the XALL or VTX operations.\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ You make it looks easy. $\\endgroup$\n    \u2013\u00a0Ari\n    Sep 12 '18 at 1:55\n\nI found tinyCAD addon the most helpful solution for this problem. It can be downloaded here:\n\n\nYou can install several ways but the easiest is to download the zip linked in the readme and use the Install from File option in UserPreferences > Addons. Then you can enable it as usual.\n\nTo use it, just select intersecting edges, press W and select TinyCAD > TinyCAD XALL\n\ntiny cad\n\n  \u2022 $\\begingroup$ Great find.

The Dynamic Spacebar Addon answer might be one of them.\n\nHere are some other:\n\n  1. Instead of creating the three parts in Edit Mode, create them in Object Mode as linked copies with AltD and rotate them. If you now go into editmode, you can adjust the length by using G and restraining to a local axis by pressing X, Y, or Z twice. With enough zoom you can adjust the verts to meet and then merge them with AltM or the Magnet Tool. Remove Doubles should work too.\n\n  2. You can use the Knife. Select all verts, zoom in a lot and cut the edges with ShiftK (shift to cut all edges) where they intersect. Then clean up.\n\n  3. You can select the verts of the upper vertical part, and move them up until they meet the side part's edges. Then use the cursor as pivot point with Dot. Copy one of them and rotate it 120 degrees around the cursor to get the third intersection point.\n\n  4. You can use the Knife Project Tool to cut them\n\n  5. You can use a three sided cylinder and extrude it outward. While in Face Select mode, select the three sides and use Mesh>>Extrude>>Individual Faces (if you have cubes instead of planes in your example). Sometimes reversing the workflow is a good idea.\n\n  6. You can use Vertex slide. Select the vertices and press G twice, then slide the vertices along the edges.\n\n  7. If the placement of the parts isn't critical, you can use the Magnet to snap the edges together.\n\n  8. The ordinary Knife Tool has snapping functionality. With everything selected, snap it to both ends of an edge and the intersecting edge will be cut.\n\n\nSo, I had to play with this until I solved it in the basic mathematical sense. So, here's a solution that will work for a pair of edges that really intersect, and it will also edd a vertex at the intersection point.\n\nTo activate:\n\n  1. Open a text editor window and create a new text file.\n  2. Paste the code from below there.\n  3. Select the intersecting edges.\n  4. Press Run Script.\n\nenter image description here\n\nHere's the code:\n\nimport bpy, bmesh\nfrom mathutils import Vector\n\nglobCo = lambda co, o: o.matrix_world * co\n\ndef find_intersection( edges, o ):\n    # Calculate global locations of edge verts\n    p1, p2 = [ globCo( v.co, o ) for v in edges[0].verts ]\n    p3, p4 = [ globCo( v.co, o ) for v in edges[1].verts ]\n\n    v1 = p2 - p1 # Edge 1 line vector\n    v2 = p4 - p3 # Edge 2 line vector\n\n    # Calcualte intersection\n    # Based on paramteric line equation: (x,y,z) = p0 + t * lineVec\n    numer = v2.y * ( p3.x - p1.x ) + v2.x * ( p1.y - p3.y )\n    denom = v1.x * v2.y - v1.y * v2.x\n    t1    = numer \/ denom\n\n    co = Vector( [ getattr( p1, i ) + t1 * getattr( v1, i ) for i in 'xyz' ] )\n\n    bpy.context.scene.cursor_location = co\n\n    return co\n\no  = bpy.context.object\nif o.mode == 'EDIT':\n    bm    = bmesh.from_edit_mesh( o.data )\n    edges = [ e for e in bm.edges if e.select ]\n\n    if len( edges ) == 2:\n        co = find_intersection( edges, o )\n\n        # Split edges and add new vert to newly created edges\n        for e in edges:\n            p1, p2 = [ globCo( v.co, o ) for v in e.verts ]\n            fac = ( co - p1 ).length \/ ( p2 - p1 ).length\n            bmesh.utils.edge_split( e, e.verts[0], fac )\n\n# Remove doubles\nbpy.ops.mesh.select_mode( type = 'VERT' )\nbpy.ops.mesh.select_all( action = 'SELECT' )\nbpy.ops.mesh.select_all( action = 'DESELECT' )\n  \u2022 1\n    $\\begingroup$ I'd like to point out that matrix multiplications now use @ instead of *. \"o: o.matrix_world * co\" would become \"o: o.matrix_world @ co\" $\\endgroup$\n    \u2013\u00a0Xylvier\n    Dec 30 '19 at 7:02\n\nJust a brief contribution, no-code solution and perfect precision:\n\n  1. Select the edges you want to intersect\n  2. Extrude them out to make faces (direction doesn't matter much)\n  3. Select the faces, Ctrl + F, Intersect (Knife)\n  4. Expand the context menu that appears bottom-left (subtle)\n  5. Under the Source drop-down menu, select Self Intersect\n  6. Select all, merge by distance to merge vertices\n  7. Delete the extra vertices which made up the temporary faces, and you're done!\n\nEnjoy your new intersection.\n\n\nAnother way that I find easier is to just use the knife tool K. Press K then left click near the intersection, draw the line over the intersection and left click again, then hit enter. This creates three new vertices, one of which is at the intersection. Delete the others and fill in any faces that get removed and you are done.\n\n\nQuick & Dirty solution\n\nThis I use and should work for you in any case (no cutting) without creating unnecessary geometry in the end. This method is manual and might not be fast for cases with multiple intersections in different locations.\n\n  1. Fill in edges from verticies (select two vertices, F to fill edge)\n  2. Extrude (E) half-length edge from any original vertex (in corners) (overlay any existing edge with one new while having snapping set to \"Edge Center\") Center Snapping\n  3. Delete the half-length edge (X or DEL) as in \"Only faces & vertices\" (The vertex of the intersection will be preserved)\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

I have tried several times and it will not number on both sides. I am using an avery template that is printing 10 tickets per page, stub and tearable ticket. But the stub will not number while the tearable ticket will.\n\nI am curently working on a larger projekt, where we have aprox. 4500 pcs.of furnituer designed in 4 different kind of families, generic, furnituer, furnituer systems and specialty equipment. We need to be able to asign every \u00a0pcs.of funituer a seqventual serial number, we have tried to do this using an extension with a funktion called element positionerning, but we have had no success with this tool, apparently it is taking up to much memory.\nWord includes a special sequencing field that you can use to do all sorts of numbering. You can even use the SEQ field to help create broken numbered lists. (A broken numbered list is one in which the flow of the list is interrupted by paragraphs of a different format.) This approach to creating numbered lists is particularly helpful and much less prone to the problems inherent in Word's built-in list numbering. For the purposes of this tip, the format of the sequence field is as follows:\nThank you for these clear instructions. I have had the same problem as Mommy Vaughan and followed the suggestion. However, on re-opening the Word document, I have the dialogue box Invalid Merge Field. I have to use Task Manager to close down Word. I am using Word 2010. Maybe that is part or all of the problem. Any ideas please? I need to sort this by tomorrow night to print them on Monday!\nI am trying to use mailmerge to print tickets. I tried using a column of sequential numbers on a spreadsheet and inserting that as a field into the mailmerge, but oddly, it used number 8 eight times on the first page, number 16 eight times on the second page, etc. So, I tried using a sequencing field as you describe. It worked great for the first page (numbers 1-8) but when I completed the mailmerge, it repeated numbers 1-8 on each successive sheet. What do I have to do to make this work in a mailmerge?\n\nIf you start to type in what appears to be a numbered list, Word formats your manually typed \"numbers\" to an automatic numbered list. The main benefit of this option is that you do not need to click any button to start numbering and you can choose your numbering style as well. For example, if you type \"(a) some text\" and press Enter, it starts numbering using the \"(a)\" format.\nRemember that you must update the values in the sheet if you want to continue the numbering series with the next batch of tickets. For instance, if you want your next batch of tickets to start with 112, you'd open the workbook and change the value 100 to 112, and update the remaining values accordingly. Don't forget to save the workbook after updating the values.\n\nHello! I would like to chart varying salaries against specific Low, middle and high numbers. Any suggestions on how to show this? Example: Salary 1 10000 Salary 2 12000 Salary 3 16000 Low 9000 Mid 15000 High 19000 THANK YOU! Do you want the Low-Mid-High values to be like a benchmark to measure salaries against? You could put horizontal lines across your chart, and use markers for the salary data. Here' a few ways to get your lines: http:\/\/peltiertech.com\/Excel\/Charts\/AddLine.html - Jon ------- Jon Peltier, Microsoft Excel MVP Peltier Technical Services Tutorials...\nYou can change the numbers in the list by restarting the sequence or by specifying a new start number. You can change the list's style. You can do anything to this list that you can do to a normal numbered list because it is a numbered list, with one exception: the list, while easy to format, is fixed. If you delete an item, the list updates accordingly, but I haven't found a way to add numbers.\nCK Note: Word 2007 - 2013 interface has an different automatic numbering scheme which I have been told is much less subject to corruption. Microsoft Word 2010 Bible by Herb Tyson, MVP. However numbering is still very imperfect in these later versions. I still recommend following Shauna Kelly's step-by-step instructions (see above) if setting up numbering in a template or in a document likely to be heavily edited. If you start without doing this and end up with \"spaghetti numbering,\" fixing it will be a very large chore!\n\nIf you are still reading this then perhaps you are looking for a simple and reliable way to number a couple of lists in a Word document. If you read John's article then you have already been informed that field numbering is simple and robust. If you are like 9 out of 10 Word users in my office then anything more than 1. space space Blah, blah \"enter\" 2. space space Blah, blah ... defies simple! If that applies to you, then the \"SeqField Numbering\" Add-In presented later in this page is for you. event ticket numbering",

Click the Add button and follow the wizard for adding your new disk.\n\nAfter you have added the disk, you can startup your virtual machine and windows will see it as a new hard drive just as if you installed a new physical drive in a machine.\n\nIf you just want additional disk space under a new drive letter, you can stop here.\n\nTo be able to spread your current drive over the two drives you need to convert them both to Dynamic Disks (look here for some more info http:\/\/www.petri.co.il\/difference_between_basic_and_dynamic_disks_in_windows_xp_2000_2003.htm) then span your current partition across both disks.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\ni think you can grow existing drives [ but then you need to convince guest os to recognize bigger storage space which is very much file system dependent ].\n\ni'm absolutely sure that you can add new virtual disk to existing vm guest. you just power off guest, edit hardware repository and add new drive. that i've done quite a lot of times.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nWhile not the most straight forward process it is rather trivial to resize the VM's existing partitions, and it's too easy to grow a virtual machines vmdk\/vhd.\n\nWindows 2008\/Vista and above:\n\n  1. Shut down the VM.\n  2. Increase the size of the existing hard drive.\n  3. Open Disk Management by launching diskmgmt.msc\n  4. Right Click on the disk in question and select Extend Volume\n\n    Windows 2003 R2\/XP and below:\n\n  5. Shut down the VM.\n\n  6. Increase the size of the existing hard drive.\n  7. Either:\n  8. Open a cmd prompt and enter the following.\n    \u2022 We'll do all the work using diskpart so open it by typing.\n    \u2022 Then locate your disk by entering\n      List Disk\n    \u2022 focus on the disk you increased by selecting it.\n      Select Disk 1\n      Just look for the disk with the free space you just allocated\n    \u2022 Next locate the partition your looking for\n      list partitions\n    \u2022 set the focus on the that partition\n      select Partition 0\n    \u2022 Now simply expand the partition.\n    \u2022 your done!\n  9.

        "text":"I had a look at the low rep and anonymous feedback here (might require some privileges):\n\n\nIt seems that questions with a high number of views (probably by users not familiar with StackExchange's ways) get high amounts of negative feedback. And this tendency is new, I never noticed it before.\n\nA few examples:\n\nI cannot find a good reason for this, except a problem with understanding the user interface by users who just pass by. I guess some might not understand the purpose of arrows (which are now used to obtain feedback from anonymous users). Another guess: maybe they fail to understand that the first post is actually the question, not an answer to the title?\n\nAny other explanation? Are those questions really bad questions?\n\nFollow-up questions: How come these questions don't show up first in the overrated list (specifically the third one)? Why do the figures found here (respectively +14, +9 and +11), which are described as \u201cunique anonymous and low rep positive feedback\u201d, not match with the previous figures?\n\n| |\n  \u2022 I don't buy your explanations: they would apply equally to any question and any SE site. \u2013\u00a0Gilles 'SO nous est hostile' Mar 20 '13 at 21:16\n  \u2022 @Gilles: except this site is one of the few whose readers might not understand English in the mouseover text. Well sure, probably nobody reads this anyway\u2026 \u2013\u00a0St\u00e9phane Gimenez Mar 20 '13 at 21:21\n  \u2022 Another reason: I'm positive this negative feedback wasn't there before the change in the UI workings. \u2013\u00a0St\u00e9phane Gimenez Mar 20 '13 at 21:28\n  \u2022 I mentioned your question in the moderator chatroom, but no one seems to know how to interpret anonymous feedback. \u2013\u00a0Gilles 'SO nous est hostile' Mar 20 '13 at 21:59\n  \u2022 I have no idea either what this means :( \u2013\u00a0F'x Mar 20 '13 at 22:12\n  \u2022 1\n    I'm told that the figures don't match the ones on french.stackexchange.com\/questions\/greatest-hits because the greatest hits page shows the total feedback on the question and its answers. (No, I hadn't known. It's kinda stated in the description box on the right, but not very clearly.) Not a bug then. \u2013\u00a0Gilles 'SO nous est hostile' Mar 21 '13 at 22:04\n  \u2022 @Gilles: Ah thanks, indeed! \u2013\u00a0St\u00e9phane Gimenez Mar 21 '13 at 22:08\n\nThis just looks like confirmation bias - in order to accumulate a large score, a post has to have a large number of views, so things on the \"least helpful\" page (which you linked to, thanks for pointing out this shiny tool, by the way) will generally have large numbers of views. If you look at the \"most helpful\" page, you'll also see lots of posts with high view counts.\n\nThe main reason for anonymous feedback to disagree with voting from the site's users is that anonymous feedback generally comes from search engine traffic, and the users who find a question (or answer) may have something very different in mind. The Google or Bing or Yahoo or whatever engine can turn up our site as a result that doesn't actually match the person's query, so it gets bad feedback. Anonymous users might also just be less tolerant of basic questions, ones they might see as stupid, or they don't really know what they're voting on (voting on question vs answer). Signed-in users, on the other hand, generally vote on questions according to whether they're useful and well-written, and on answers according to how well the answer suits the question. Also questions are probably voted on more than answers simply because they're at the top.\n\nIf you look at the feedback summary, 70% of the total feedback is positive compared to \"our\" ~97% positive feedback. I think this just means that anonymous users are more readily downvoting, and though they may be voting on their personal query experience more than on the actual question\/answer, it doesn't mean they're wrong. But they're not overwhelming. And if I'm reading the Post Score to Anonymous Feedback part, most of the anonymous voting falls in line with how we're voting.\n\n| |\n  \u2022 2\n    This seems perfectly reasonable to me. The site aficionados may love a question, but that doesn't mean it makes a useful resource for the general public arriving from a Google search. Also, there's no \"cost\" for anonymous negative feedback, like there is for downvoting answers. \u2013\u00a0Robert Harvey Mar 21 '13 at 4:46\n\nYou must log in to answer this question.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

I also vaguely remember a way to stream it to my iPhone4, and then stream that to AirPlay on the ATV?\n\nshare|improve this question\nup vote 1 down vote accepted\n\nYou can use AirFlick with Lion as long as you use it in tandem with AirVideo. Check out this blog post for instructions. It worked for me.\n\nshare|improve this answer\n\nYou are right about streaming to the iPhone (or iPad) and then to the ATV. Check out the VLC streamer. The application is installed on iOS, and a companion app goes on the computer. VLC Streamer will transcode non-native video (e.g., AVI) from the computer, pipe it to the iOS device, and then pipe that to the ATV via AirPlay. I have tested this and it works exactly as described. The quality of your results will be dependent, of course, on your LAN bandwidth and processing speed of the machines. You can set some of these parameters in VLC Streamer, though, which maximizes output. Enjoy!\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI though it was VLC. I assume then that the file that VLC is sending could reside on a network folder, and then sends it to the iPhone and to the ATV. Luckily, our wifi connection is pretty damn fast ;D \u2013\u00a0Charlie Jan 22 '12 at 5:15\nYes, it can definitely be on a networked directory. I have exactly that setup running. \u2013\u00a0soxman Jan 25 '12 at 18:22\nDo I need to send it to the iPhone, then the ATV? Or can I stream straight from the Mac to the ATV? \u2013\u00a0Charlie Jan 25 '12 at 19:17\nAs far as I know, yes. You also have to install the helper app on your computer. Check out the VLC Streamer page here for more info \u2013\u00a0soxman Jan 25 '12 at 22:33\nThe problem with this is that it puts a local copy of the media on my computer, taking up space. You mentioned you were able to have it play movies from a network drive, how so? \u2013\u00a0Charlie Jan 26 '12 at 12:45\n\nIf they're MPEG-4 formatted videos, just add them to iTunes. ATV will play anything in your iTunes (must be MP4 though, not AVI even if iTunes would play it).\n\nIf you want non-MP4 video, you'll need to jailbreak your ATV & install Plex.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI am planning on jailbrekaing anyways, but I don't want to have to put them into iTunes, but run them off the shared folder... \u2013\u00a0Charlie Jan 22 '12 at 3:54\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"How can I install Windows XP on a Windows 7 PC using dual boot?\n\nAbhishek November 21, 2011\nPinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp\n\nI am unable to install Windows XP on my Windows 7 PC. Every time I do the option to install Windows XP is greyed out or disabled. What can I do?\n\n  1. Venkatesh Kashyap\n    December 3, 2011 at 4:22 am\n\n    install xp in FAT-32 file system.\n    win-7 in NTFS file system.\n\n    November 22, 2011 at 12:03 am\n\n    Hello, the best method is to install from older to newer operating system.\u00a0 In your case, you have to do it from newer to older.\u00a0 The following link will explain everything you need\u00a0 and have to do to succeed:\n\n    Hello, these are links that deal on how to dual boot xp with vista\/7:\n\n    There error you are getting can be solved by turning the SATA configuration to IDE in BIOS, if the option is there.\u00a0 Downside with setting to IDEA is that you will loose some performance with the drive.\u00a0 Or as Mike suggested, download the ACHI drivers for your system to a flashdrive\/cd and installing them by using F6 button when installing XP. \u00a0\n\n  3. Mike\n    November 21, 2011 at 8:29 pm\n\n    If the this is the case AHCI drivers can be supplied during the Windows XP installation using the F6 option\n\n  4. Sonny Bass\n    November 21, 2011 at 8:26 pm\n\n    Most likely your BIO's has SATA type set to AHCI. XP will not load or run in this mode. I would\u00a0recommend\u00a0VirtualBox\n\n  5. Mike\n    November 21, 2011 at 8:25 pm\n\n    I'm afraid you will have to reformat your entire Hard Drive beforehand.\n\n    Windows 7 uses the GUID Partition Table by default wherein Windows XP only supports Master Boot Record. Therefor when you try to install Windows XP it can't find a partition to install to.\n\n    If you decide to reformat I strongly suggest to install Windows XP first and then Windows 7 afterwards. Windows 7 supports dual boot out of the box and will add both systems to the boot menu wherein Windows XP would replace the boot loader [which means you would have to manually reinstall it and add both boot options].",
