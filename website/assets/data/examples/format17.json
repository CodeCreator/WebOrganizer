It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nI am in the market for at least one wide-angle prime lens. I've focused most of my search on 50mm and 24mm prime lenses from Canon, Zeiss, and Sigma. Crossing paths with another avenue of research in large-format cameras and photography, I started looking at tilt-shift lenses. I've looked at the two Canon TS-E lenses, the 17mm and 24mm. The concept of tilt, shift, and rotation is amazing, and the focus, dof, and perspective effects and control possible with a TS lens, at least on paper, are simply amazing.\n\nThe cost of such a lens is pretty high...higher than any lens I have purchased to date by at least $500, topping a retail price of $2000 for the Canon variety. My questions are, have you used a tilt-shift lens? If so, which brands and lens models have you used? Are they worth the price? Do they really offer the amazing capabilities noted in the following reviews?\n\nMany thanks!\n\nshare|improve this question\n\n4 Answers 4\n\nup vote 7 down vote accepted\n\nFigured I'd follow up my comment with an actual answer since I have the opposite opinion of Matt :) I own 3 of the Canon tilt shift lenses (90mm, 45mm, 24mm II) and I owned the 17mm as will until last month. The vast majority of what I like shooting is cityscapes\/buildings and landscapes so the 24 TSE II gets a lot of use and its use isn't limited to just fixing lines in cityscapes.\n\n  \u2022 The ability to 'shift' the lens up to achieve a higher perspective w\/out tilting elements in the foreground is very useful when shooting landscapes where you want a lot of sky in them and have tallish elements (trees, barns) in the foreground that you don't want to look funny.\n  \u2022 As Matt mentioned its very useful to tilt the lens to the left and right to get 3 shots that are easy to stitch\n  \u2022 Like Jrista and I were talking about its very useful to be able to tilt the plane of focus so that everything from your feet to the mountains are in focus even at f3.5 in case the light is low\n\n  \u2022 Besides landscapes the 90mm has a very favorable magnification factor for pseudo-macro work with flowers and plants that have flower-heads or leaves on an off-plane of focus.\n\nI find the 24L TSE II to be my go-to lens for photographing nature, I bring that and a 70-200L usually for 'nature\/outdoors' photo treks. A note on the 17mm, I found it to be too wide, wider than 21mm is generally too wide for my taste. Also the front element of the 17mm is domed and fully exposed to the elements, no hood and its not inset (which is kind of scary).\n\nshare|improve this answer\nGood point about tilting down to get the foreground in focus, I'm used to the tilt being left\/right but I guess for landscapes it makes much more sense to have it switched! \u2013\u00a0 Matt Grum Oct 30 '10 at 22:51\n+1 for a different point of view :) \u2013\u00a0 Matt Grum Oct 30 '10 at 23:48\nThanks for the info. It sounds like a TS-E lens does indeed bring the same basic capabilities of a large format view camera to smaller formats. Out of curiosity, why did you sell the 17mm, and keep the 24mm? I guess I would have thought that the 17mm would have been nicer for wide landscapes. How does the 24L TS-E do for landscapes? \u2013\u00a0 jrista Oct 31 '10 at 3:47\nI (personally) found 17mm to be too wide in the sense that you begin to get distortion at the corners where the 24mm has little to no distortion corner to corner. As a personal preference I like 21-24mm for 'landscape' photography, but thats just my opinion for my photos :) Its just as well, the more you use specific foca lengths the easier it is for you to 'see' what will look good before putting the camera to your face and 24mm is one of my 4 favs. \u2013\u00a0 Shizam Oct 31 '10 at 4:13\n17mm is also very wide in the sense that you will get an awful lot of foreground in, and the your background objects (mountains etc.) are going to be mighty small. It can work for some places, but in general I find the 24-35 range more useful. \u2013\u00a0 Matt Grum Oct 31 '10 at 13:47\n\nI don't think it's really worth the expense of the 17mm tilt-shift lens for landscapes.\n\nBasically shifting allows you to capture more of your image without recomposing. For example if you wanted to capture more of the top of a building you could shift the lens down (which is effectively shifting the sensor up) and capture more of top of the image. Pointing the camera up would achieve a similar effect, but you would then get converging vertical lines which are undesirable in most architectural photography.\n\nOk, so you might want to do the same thing with a landscape photo in order to capture more sky. However, given there are no vertical lines in the sky to converge, you're not gaining anything compared to simply tilting the camera up.\n\nAs for tilting, you're effectively tilting the plane of focus, and thus DOF (which with a regular lens is always parrallel to the camera). So if you have a wall which is coming towards you, you can tilt the plane of focus to line up better with the wall and thus get more of it in focus.\n\nAgain, this isn't as much use in landscape photography where natural features rarely run in straight lines. Plus you have so much depth of field to begin with when using a wide angle lens DOF is rarely a problem. If you're going to use a tilt-shift lens to minimise DOF (for the fake miniature effect) you might as well do that in post.\n\nOne thing you can do with a T\/S lens is keep the lens still and shift in order to capture a pair of images that will perfecty line up for stiching into a mini panorama, effectively making your camera sensor bigger. But this pales in comparison with what you can do with a multi-shot panorama and VR tripod head.\n\nI'm sure people will point out that there are uses for T\/S lenses in landscape (i.e. when you have buildings in shot, or trees you want to keep vertical) but they are relatively few, and IMO not nearly enough to justify the cost of a T\/S lens. The TS-E 17 is a nieche lens primarily suited to shooting man made objects \/ close distances.\n\nT\/S lenses are a lot of fun, however unless you really need one they're hugely expensive. You can however make your own using a cheap MF lens and some plumbing supplies. Of course you wont get anything as nice as purpose built T\/S, but you're talking about $100 vs. $2000 which is a no brainer if you're doing this for fun!\n\nThis is a good post on going the DIY route:\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI'm not sure its just about lines and perspective. In landscape\/nature, its more about focus plane (tilt). For example, you could tilt up just a tad to get foreground in clear focus without losing your distant focus (blurry foreground happens a lot.) There are also close-up or closer focal plane options where having more freedom with the focal plane allows greater creativity. I understand why large format view cameras (used heavily in pro landscape photography) have these types of movements...I am jot sure if a TS lens for a full-frame digital offers the same capabilities that justify cost. \u2013\u00a0 jrista Oct 30 '10 at 16:34\n@jrista +++. Tilt shift lenses are very helpful in landscape for the ability to tilt the plane of focus so everything from your feet to the mountains are in focus even at wide apertures. \u2013\u00a0 Shizam Oct 30 '10 at 17:13\n@Shizam: Yeah, thats what I'd read when learning about large format view cameras. Have you used a TS lens on a DSLR? Any insight? \u2013\u00a0 jrista Oct 30 '10 at 20:07\n@Matt: Regarding a DIY TS lens...what about image circle size? You need a larger image circle to accomodate the extra movement, and keep the sensor inside the circle. I can't tell exactly how that works from the article you linked. With the TS-E 17mm, the image circle is something like 62mm in size, which is quite a bit larger than 43.7mm of a normal image circle. \u2013\u00a0 jrista Oct 30 '10 at 20:11\nThe mod uses an old medium format lens so the size of the image circle isn't a problem. There are lots of good MF lenses for discontinued cameras available for very little money making it quite an attractive prospect. \u2013\u00a0 Matt Grum Oct 30 '10 at 22:47\n\nAs mentioned before, tilt-shift lenses are very useful for landscape photography because of the ability to tilt the plane of focus. But be aware that internal metering tend to be inaccurate with more tilting\/shifting, so use a light meter if you have one.\n\nI personally prefer the 24mm over the 17mm, mainly because I still shoot film and the 24mm allows the use of filters. If you don't need that wide a focal length, Hartblei also makes an excellent 35mm tilt-shift lens:\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks for the info. :) Very interesting point about the 17mm and filters. I've read a couple reviews, but the thought about filters never even crossed my mind. I am a fan of Lee filters, so I really wouldn't want to lose that capability. Guess thats why a few people have said they opted for the 24mm over the 17mm. \u2013\u00a0 jrista Oct 31 '10 at 3:50\nGood point on light falloff I forgot about that, I found myself metering w\/no tilt\/shift first to get a correct reading before adjusting tilt\/shift, or using a spot meter. \u2013\u00a0 Shizam Oct 31 '10 at 4:15\n@Shizam: Yes, metering before tilting\/shifting is a common workaround, but nothing quite beats a good spot meter :) @jrista: It's one of the reasons why I'm opting for the 24mm TS-E or the Zeiss 21mm :) For film users, filters are still a necessity. \u2013\u00a0 ctham Oct 31 '10 at 6:12\n\nYou can buy adapters that provide either tilt or shift from Arax. They work with Pentacon Six mount medium format lenses (which can also be bought from Arax, or eBay). The shortest focal lengths available seem to be 30mm fisheye, or 45mm rectilinear.\n\nThey also sell a tilt adapter for use with EOS lenses, but it's less useful as its tilt ... (truncated)",

        "text":"I just bought an Arduino Uno (SMD version) from W11Stop and want to know whether there is any other difference between Arduino UNO DIP and Arduino UNO SMD besides knowing that the SMD version doesn't have a DIP chip which can be replaced?\n\nI am just a beginner so please help me if I am wrong!\n\n  \u2022 Afaik, the SMD version actually has two extra analog pins. But they may not be accessible on your Arduino board (ADC6 & ADC7). The PDIP has 28pins TQFP has 32 pins (check the datasheet). But the internals should be the same by design. \u2013\u00a0Paul Sep 9 '17 at 10:41\n\nAs far as I know there is no real difference, at least not directly related to the SMD.\n\nThere are many clones which sometimes have slightly different behavior or protection.\n\nBut for the SMD the only disadvantage is it cannot (easily) be replaced.\n\nI have one original one (with DIP) and several clones and so far I did not found any difference, except for having mini USB instead of normal USB.\n\n  \u2022 mini USB instead of USB-B is just a chinese version of it. Many clones of Arduino bought from china have either MINI, MICRO or B-type usb port, you can actually choose. But none original(UNO) has ever had a mini USB on it. \u2013\u00a0Jakey Apr 8 '18 at 14:17\n\nActually, there are no different on the functionality. But you may can't go through some features, because the ATmega can be remove it manually without any special tools. One of the useful case as ArduinoISP for burning bootloader to another ATmega328p AVR.\n\nFor personal suggestion, you just needed one piece of PDIP\/DIP version UNO, others boards you can consider the lower cost, such as Nano, Pro Mini(Without USB-to-TTL), UNO(SMD).\n\nFor the USB-to-TTL, there are many options in the market, watch this video to explain what are they different.\n\n\nThere's no actual difference, but just the \"look\". Neither version of it should bother you at anything, but there are 2 things, worth mentioning.\n\n  1. The IC can fall out of DIP socket: I've been told a few times this already, but never had experienced such behaviour or been at occasion, where that happened. So here's a disadvantage for DIP cases.\n\n  2. DIP has also possibility of changing waaaaaaaaaay easier the microprocessor in case of failure. You simply grab it off (even might with a help of a screwdriver) and you're ready to put in a new one. So this is an advantage nr. 1. I also like to use an Arduino in projects, but not the whole board. I just take the IC (atmega328) and use 2 ceramic caps with 16MHz quartz and I've got my own arduino on other PCB - in this case, you can use Arduino UNO board as a programmer. This is how to avoid installing FTDI or CH340 chip on other boards. Advantage nr. 2.\n\nYour Answer\n\nBy clicking \u201cPost Your Answer\u201d, you agree to our terms of service, privacy policy and cookie policy\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nSound Design Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for sound engineers, producers, editors, and enthusiasts. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nGood day everybody!\n\nAs an aspiring sound designer I used to do my sound design based on different sound libraries mostly. I would say 70% of stock effects, 15% my own sounds(sampled, recorded, synthesized) and 15% of effect plugins on the top and it all layed in hundreds of layers. I thoroughly enjoy this process. Neither I have those mics nor the access to locations that those big guys use to record their sounds, so I wont be able to source my own sounds in the near future.\n\nI would like to ask your opinion on a few moments:\n\n1) Professional side. Some clients are genuinely concerned whether the sounds designer uses are his own custom created samples. Some are not and judge by the result.\n\nWhat share of both do you use for professional work and how each variant affects your salary, job application and all sides of a business?\n\n2) What is your personal opinion towards using custom sounds or stock sounds?\n\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n9 Answers 9\n\nIt really depends on the specific sound in question, since for some props or vehicles it may simply not be possible\/affordable to access them to record, & library use is the only option.... It also depends how prominent the sound is in context eg if it is a signature sound for a scene then I would definitely aspire for it to be unique. (I saw a plugin the other day that described itself as a 'go-to for signature sounds' - not on my planet!!!)\n\nBut one factor in this is that (in my experience) very, very rarely does any sound effect in a film actually consist of a single sound - careful layering & editing are required for everything, even the apparently simplest of sounds. So it also really depends how you use library sounds...\n\nThere is also a lot to be said for getting a temp version of FX created, using whatever is at hand\/available and then assessing your record list and prioritising. If time & budget allows then you record everything, but that still may not result in the best outcome. Commercial libraries, your own personal library and new recordings are all resources that it is your job to make the best use of....\n\nFWIW the ambiences for a film THE ORATOR I did last year were the closest I got to 100% new recordings. I did 2 seperate recording trips to Samoa for it, and at the ambience predub the source material was 95% new recordings.... Editing those ambiences was also far easier than having to wade through my library trying to find elements to recreate locations. Sometimes recording the real thing is a time saver later in the process...\n\nshare|improve this answer\n+1 Couldn't have said it better myself. Wish I had budgets to work with to allow for more field recording than currently\/ I agree with the layers, when used appropriately they add dimension, depth, and character to a sometimes otherwise 'flat' single element. Assuming all layers are working together on harmony and not just there for the sake of being there :) \u2013\u00a0 Stavrosound Apr 30 '12 at 20:02\nadd comment\n\nBefore getting into the business I read a lot about the pride of using your own sounds. But I think that was comments by people with big budgets and years of experience. Many of the projects I've worked on has a limited budget and limited time.\n\nI guess by stock you don't actually mean that as in Audiojungle, Pond5 and Audiomicro but more Sound Ideas, Hollywood Edge and other libraries.\n\nIt also depends on how your recorded material looks. If you have 5TB of audio nicely structured with metadata then surely you would use it. If you don't, then you'd have to start recording in the beginning of every project.\n\nI find myself getting more and more of my own recorded material in the productions. But to be fair it's only about 5-10% so far. The rest are library effects that I've somehow manipulated. I will even be honest enough to say that sometimes when the crunch has its worst hold on me I'm just happy if something works out of the box.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIf your own sound works better than a library sound, then use it. If the library sound works better than your sound, then use it.\n\nWhat matters is the whole composition and how it works, not that much individual sounds.\n\nI would still try to avoid using commonly used library sounds as very exposed sounds in the mix or relying too much on library sounds \"as they are\".\n\nAnd yes, there are many sounds that you just cannot record or create, because that exact sound has been recorded or designed by someone else.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIn my case, the choice between creating\/using original, custom made sounds and using stock FX is always made by the budget of the project.\n\nSome directors are not only concerned about originality, but also the copyrights though most of the stock FX are royalty free. That's why when I'm giving a quote, I give a lot details about the recording&editing process besides royalties. I explain how this reflects to end-price and finally leave the choice to them.\n\nNowadays, even if you don't have any gear, you still can rent them, so anything is possible with enough budget.\n\nGood luck!\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nI agree with @Mviljamaa the end result is more important than process. To quote Mr B. Minto from DICE \"if it sounds good it is good\". Having said that there is also the practical reality of time and budget, and expected quality. for Example when working on AAA gaming projects the expectation is to have something exciting and new sounding, so budgetting time and money for original recordings can often push the bar that little bit higher than using stock effects.\n\nHaving said that my 2 most recent projects, Death Rally for iOS - 2 weeks audio time, no budget - used exclusively libraries and a couple of favors from friends. Alan Wake American Nightmare for XBLA - a few months audio time and a small budget - uses almost exclusively library effects some brought for the project which were carefully choose as the best bang for the buck Libraries to get the job done. Both of these games have received quite a bit of positive attention for the audio, more than any AAA project I've done - go figure...\n\nSo the conclusion to this rambling is - it's how you use the sounds you've got rather than how you got the sounds you use ...\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nI love making and recording sounds. I will always start a project with a list of things I might record. For me the recording process and getting creative in what materials to use is a lot of fun!\n\nI don't have a problem with using sound libraries and often use them myself. But if you want to be a better sound designer then I would advise taking more control over the process. The more input you give a project the more it will sound like your own.\n\nAnd as mentioned already, it's far more rewarding completing something where you've had such direct control over the material used.\n\nIt's definitely not something you should assume only comes with big budgets. Recording and experimenting with sounds is fun and relatively cheap.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nYes, but Hollywood Edge \"touched it\" first. I guess I'm simply talking about the pride of making something only you could make. That's what makes Sound Designers artists of a sort. I use libraries all the time, but I also record...then my own library is recycled.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIt is not that simple. You can just edit stuff from FX libraries, or you can use those as only raw material that you use to sculpt sounds or parts of sounds you need. It is not that black and white.\n\nBye \/ Tumppi\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThis was supposed to be under the following post :) \u2013\u00a0 Tumppi May 7 '12 at 9:39\nadd comment\n\nI was told by Nigel Holland, if you're using someone else's library, you're not a sound designer, you're a sound editor. It's that easy. Go get a Pcm-D50 or zoom and have fun!\n\nshare|improve this answer\ncreating new complex sounds layering library sounds certainly can be a design process. a design using recycled materials. \u2013\u00a0 Pretaeperon May 4 '12 at 18:22\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n\nBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?

But with a third-party application, especially that natively installed (\"tag\"), It display correctly the first record, and for the second it's an empty field. So, It still not working, because it still see the second record screenshot\n\nshare|improve this answer\nWhen I use TNF_UNKNOWN or TNF_EXTERNAL_TYPE, it display \"Unknown tag\" like a second record!!

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nRole-playing Games Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for gamemasters and players of tabletop, paper-and-pencil role-playing games. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nIt's my understanding that WOTC is releasing a string of 4e products under a label they're calling \"Essentials\", that there's substantial revisions\/errata attached to this product line, and that the primary goal is to provide a superior learning curve for players who are new to RPGs.\n\nMy question is this: What problems or deficiencies in the existing 4th edition architecture, perceived or real, are the Essentials revisions intended to address? Also, am I correct in understanding that all extant 4e products will be revised as needed to be fully compatable with the new version of the rules?\n\nshare|improve this question\nI'd attach a \"ddessentials\" tag if there was one. Please note that I have no interest in starting a 4.5e skubwar (which is why I was suprised to note that the 4e tag reads \"4.0\"), and forgive me if I've totally misunderstood the scope of the Essentials line - I can't isolate the signal from the noise that WOTC PR is putting out, and anywhere else I go the subject will invariably devolve into trolling and flamewars. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 1 '10 at 23:02\nI think this will be divisive and cause arguments, and that it'll be hard to get decent answers to it given that essentials isn't even out yet. I'd consider waiting to ask this question until anyone could answer it in anything other than opinions. \u2013\u00a0 mxyzplk Sep 1 '10 at 23:06\nI took a shot because I'm a masochist. There are people with Essentials books in their hands answering questions, and some of my answers are based on what they've said. If this gets flamey I'll vote to close, but I'd like to see if we can manage to avoid Edition Wars, because I think that'd be a substantial accomplishment. Also -- added the tag because I think Essentials-only is going to be a reasonable way to want to play the game. \u2013\u00a0 Bryant Sep 1 '10 at 23:23\nIt's definitely a question that's historically been prone to some ugly debates, but it's still ultimately a question that I think needs answering, if only because I don't know the answer myself. More importantly, I think that we need to be able to talk about potentially divisive things, like controversial edition changes or revisions, if RPG Stackexchange is going to distinguish itself above other RPG communities. The ratings structure gives us a great way to filter out the trolls, and I think it'd be a shame if we failed to use this platform to its utmost potential. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 1 '10 at 23:38\n\n3 Answers 3\n\nup vote 14 down vote accepted\n\nKudos for tackling the tough subject with grace. I'll see how well I can answer this. If anyone thinks I've gotten evangelistic, please let me know and I'll try and modify my answer to reflect your concerns.\n\nWhat Is Essentials?\n\nThere will be several products released this year and early next year under the Essentials banner. Here's a list of the key ones. If you get those, you will have a core set of rules that allows you to easily play and run D&D 4e.\n\nThere are few core changes or errata that originate with Essentials. Combat works the same way, magic works the same way, and so on. There have definitely been a lot of errata and rules changes over the last two years, and Essentials will include all of those, but Essentials in and of itself is not the reason for those changes. For better or worse -- and there are arguments in both directions -- WotC decided to aggressively fix balance problems in 4e. That's not new to this release.\n\nThe classes presented in Essentials -- fighter, cleric, rogue, wizard, druid, paladin, ranger, and warlock -- are not the same versions as those we've seen so far. In some cases they're pretty similar, and in some cases they're fairly different. However, they are fully compatible with existing characters of those classes, in two key senses.\n\nFirst, you can take an Essentials wizard and plop her down in a campaign next to a wizard as presented in the Player's Handbook and nothing at all needs to be changed for either of them. The core gameplay is completely compatible, again. D&D 4e is designed so that classes are heavily modular; a given class can have multiple builds which function differently, and one class may gain powers differently than another, but in the end you're just rolling an attack and applying damage and\/or conditions.\n\nSecond, material from Essentials serves as a resource for existing classes and vice versa. For example, you can choose Essentials wizard powers for your classic wizard without problems. Likewise, an Essentials wizard could take PHB wizard powers. No need to house rule or adjust. In some cases, this won't make sense -- for example, Essentials fighters don't have dailies, so they can't take PHB fighter dailies -- but even in that case an Essentials fighter could take a PHB fighter utility power.\n\nAll that said, Essentials is going to feel different. Fighters, for example, work much more like third edition fighters. I suspect some people will want to play Essentials-only games, and I think there's good reasons why you might want to do that. Further, if you learn to play an Essentials fighter, there'd be a slight learning curve if you then wanted to learn how a classic fighter works.\n\nWhy Essentials?\n\nOnly Wizards knows for sure, but they've talked about a bunch of things. They want to have a better entry point into the game. The Starter Kit will be sold in Target for $20, and that's a lot more accessible than telling new players they need these three $35 hardcover books.\n\nThey also clearly want to attract players of older editions. As noted, the fighter is simpler and does away with some of the immersion problems people have had. The classic 4e fighter is centered around powers, and the Essentials fighter returns to the mode of just using basic attacks -- but doing cooler things with them.\n\nI believe that Wizards would like to have a new core rule set that collects all those errata. I don't find the PHB to be useless... but I also get most of my rules info from my DDI subscription at this point, and I'm really looking forward to the compiled Rules Compendium. It's a pain looking up finer rules points in three or four different places.\n\nWhat Happens To Old Stuff?\n\nNothing. There is not going to be anything like the Complete Class line which made the old class books obsolete. Essentials options don't overlap with classic options; if I want to play a two-weapon fighter who gets by on mobility, the Tempest Fighter from Martial Power is probably still the right way to go. The monsters from the first three Monster Manuals are completely functional and don't need to change -- at worst, you might want to up the damage for the ones from MM1 and MM2. The campaign books don't need new editions. Etc.\n\nMost of the books announced for 2011 are not Essentials books; they don't have the Essentials name and they don't have the Essentials trade dress. I believe the intent is that they'll be equally useful whether you have the old core books or the new Essentials books, which makes sense because it's theoretically the same game.\n\n\nThe proof is in the pudding. A few core rules are changing with Essentials. Racial traits are slightly different here and there, for example, but in all cases the changes are optional rather than forced. Magic items get a new rarity scheme, and I don't know exactly how that's going to interact with old magic items.\n\nAll the above wall of text is what I think, but I do want to look at the books and find out for myself.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThat almost answers my question, and I'm going to take the blame for opting for inoffensiveness over clarity. The fact of the matter is, I like 4e as a whole, but there are specific elements about 4e that I don't like, and that I wish would change, and \"errata\" means \"changes\" - the thing you mentioned about fighters working more like 3e fighters really sounds interesting to me, for example. However, I was under the impression that it was closer to release than it apparently is. I may have simply asked this question too soon. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 1 '10 at 23:44\nI gotta admit it'll be easier to answer in about a month. I know some of the new fighter stuff, but not all of it. \u2013\u00a0 Bryant Sep 1 '10 at 23:52\nThat's a lot ... so it's like 4.5 that's backwards compatible ... great. \u2013\u00a0 C. Ross Sep 14 '10 at 15:37\n@C.Ross: Less that, I think, than a version of 4E that's geared toward people whose favored editions were those before 3rd. From what I've seen of the Essentials stuff, it's very much \"can I play a character like the one I played in the 1980s in your game?\" \u2013\u00a0 Jadasc Sep 14 '10 at 15:53\nOkay, good enough. Fighters hit things with swords instead of using powers? I'm sold. \u2013\u00a0 Burrito Al Pastor Sep 16 '10 at 18:34\n\nUntil we get the books in our hands we can't be sure what changes Essentials will hold for the core rules. But remember this D&D 4.0 is an exception based system. In that it is similar to Magic the Gathering. MtG is not the same as it was back when it was first released. However it is the same game. What makes it different is the mix of card that is part of the core set. Despite not playing for a number of years I am confident I can go buy a deck of magic cards and starting playing. I will definitely have to learn new strategies and new ways of building my decks. But I am still playing the same game.\n\nAnd this looks to be the situation with Essential D&D. Instead of just the core Fighter there will be the Essential Fighter and so on for the rest of the classes. You will have status effects, at-will powers, encounter powers, and perhaps a few dailies. And you will still have to read the text carefully and understand the standard terms.\n\nIf they do the Essential Red Box right then it will be a lot easier for people to pick up and try 4e D&D.

OpenCL support is built into the graphics driver from Intel. I also have a discrete GPU -- AMD HD 7970 supporting OpenCL, this support also implemented in a driver (this time AMD's).\n\n\nThe problem is that after I install the AMD's driver Intel's GPU is no longer accessible via OpenCL. There are two OpenCL platforms present in the system, but the Intel's one only sees CPU (AMD's sees both CPU and GPU). Before the installation of the AMD driver Intel's platform sees two devices: the CPU and HD Graphics 4000.\n\n\nIs it a known issue?",

        "text":"Take the 2-minute tour \u00d7\nMi Yodeya is a question and answer site for those who base their lives on Jewish law and tradition and anyone interested in learning more. It's 100% free, no registration required.\n\nMany observant sephardim in Israel, especially those in yeshivot, dress in black and white. Does anyone know how this happened?\n\nThere is no tradition of Jews in North Africa or in the Middle East wearing European black and white clothing with black hats. On the contrary, richly colored fabrics and turbans marked traditional, respectful attire.\n\nBesides the Sephardic Chief Rabbi dress, I can't think of anyone who has retained that tradition. Instead, many Sephardic Jews assimilated Ashkenazic styles. Why is that, and is there any documentation explaining the switch?\n\nshare|improve this question\nYou can improve this question by specifying the Ashkenazi communities to which you refer. Not all Ashkenazi Jews dressed in black hats and suits; there were Jewish communities across the continent whose \"traditional\" clothing was more colourful. I think you'll find that the adoption of the \"black and white\" dress by Sephardim owes its origins to the same phenomena that saw its adoption by other Ashkenazim as well. \u2013\u00a0 Shimon bM Sep 5 '12 at 11:42\nThanks Shimon. How would you specify the Ashkenazi communities? Charedi Lithuanian\/Chassidic? Help me out and I'll fix the question. \u2013\u00a0 Aryeh Sep 5 '12 at 11:52\n@ShimonbM, I think Aryeh's question can stand on its own. Ashkenazim are well known for dressing in black and white the more \"to the right\" they are. I don't think it's necessary to explain how that all became commonplace in order to ask this question. \u2013\u00a0 Seth J Sep 5 '12 at 14:59\nI'm guessing that it's probably a simple function of economics. The attire of Litvish Haredi in Israel is much cheaper (and mass-produced) than what the Sephardic Jews used to wear (which was hand-made). \u2013\u00a0 Craig Feinstein Sep 5 '12 at 17:00\nWhile there is certainly a specifically Jewish\/religious aspect to this question, I would point out that most of the world has adopted Western modes of dress. In the Middle East, where most Sephardim come from, most people do not wear the traditional Arab garb. Moreover, this change took place before most Sephardim left their home countries for Israel or America. Most Sephardim stopped wearing \"richly colored fabrics and turbans\" well before they began to assimilate into the Ashkenazi world. \u2013\u00a0 LazerA Feb 19 '13 at 21:32\nadd comment\n\n8 Answers 8\n\nup vote 10 down vote accepted\n\nThe only source I have yet to find acknowledging this switch in clothing from a Sephardic perspective is in the English edition to the Yalkut Yosef Hilkhot Shabbat. Under Siman 242, Halakhah 5, regarding the mitzvah to change from weekday clothes into more elegant garments, the editor (R. Yisrael Bitan) added a special footnote:\n\nThe Kabbalists ruled that one must wear white suits on Shabbat. Even so, in our time all the greatest Torah scholars are accustomed to wear black suits on Shabbat, and one should not act differently. If an individual chooses to be different from everyone else and wear a white suit, he is acting improperly; he is compared to a groom sitting among mourners. It important to explain this to those who begin observing mitzvot on their own (ba'ale teshuvah) so that they will conduct themselves as recommended by the Torah leaders of our generation.\n\nThis is directly opposing the Ben Ish Chai's position not to wear any black on shabbat (Ben Ish Chai, 2nd year, Lech Lecha #18). I also just came across an article from R. Marc Angel on the subject. He mentions personally talking with R. Mordecai Eliyahu, in the early 90's, on the Ashkenazic-assimilated dress code:\n\nRabbi Eliyahu responded: the Ashkenazic garb has become the \"standard\" garb for Talmidei Hakhamim, and Sephardic rabbis won't be taken seriously enough if they don't dress according to this fashion. When I said that the situation might be turned around if he and other Sephardic leaders made an issue of it, he said it wasn't worth it and it wouldn't succeed.\n\nI haven't found a source explaining the process of assimilating the clothing, but I do remember hearing a shiur from R. Rakeffet, who explained that R. Ovadia's children went to Ashkenazic yeshivot because those institutions had the highest standard of Torah learning at the time. Such an environment, bearing in mind the already existing struggles of a stereotyped minority, could likely create the norm R. Eliyahu noted.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nInstitutionalized Judaism is largely composed of Ashkenazim, which makes some Sepharadim feel like they need to fit in or dress 'acceptably' in order to be accepted. Sometimes, people need to dress up in order to be taken seriously: that is the unfortunate state of a sizable portion of Jewry these days. This answer is based on personal experience, in fact, things I encounter every day.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nI think this same explanation can be conveyed with less annoyance, IMO. \u2013\u00a0 Seth J Sep 5 '12 at 15:00\nYochanan, welcome to Mi Yodeya.

However nowadays even black suits are considered nice.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nWhen people discuss this, they assume that Sephardic Jews were all wearing robes and turbans while living in Arabic-speaking countries. Then, they came to Israel and started wearing black suits and ties.\n\nIn many cases, Jews started wearing Western-style clothing while living in Arabic-speaking countries\n\nLook at this pic of wedding in Aleppo in 1914:http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/84\/Aleppo-Jewish201914.jpg\n\nJews in North Africa saw themselves as French and spoke French.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nBut notice that the guy on the bottom left is wearing a fez. These days Sephardim wear the Ashkenazi black top hats that are a relic 17th century Poland. \u2013\u00a0 Matt Mar 13 at 22:08\nadd comment\n\nI think it's because all religious jews in israel are a minority against the secular jews\n\nso the black\/white has been adopted as ben torah attire not necessarily referring to ashkenazi or what not.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nadd comment\n\nIt's one of the many examples of Jews in Israel who hail from Arab countries trying to look less Arabic and to assimilate to some extent to the more dominant Ashkenazi culture.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nIvan, welcome to Mi Yodeya, and thanks for sharing your opinion!

Many Charedi Yeshivot in Israel push for Ashkanazi minhagim as halacha for all Jews.\n\n(Ironically, the halacha is actually the opposite, in that an Ashkenaz finding himself in a sephardi location is supposed to take on sephardi custom, while the Sephardi minhag is not to.)\n\nThis can been known as the Ashkanazification of Sephardim,(TM) and in some people's view is a problem. http:\/\/jcpa.org\/dje\/articles3\/sephardic.htm\n\nshare|improve this answer\nAvi, don't get ahead of yourself. The Sephardi leadership's position has always been \"Ma'alin BeKdushah VeEin Moridin\" and, as such, (ahem) Sephardim may not adopt Ashkenazi customs, but Ashkenazim may adopt Sephardi customs. This is rather self-serving logic (not to mention cyclical in some applications of it). \u2013\u00a0 Seth J Sep 5 '12 at 16:48\n@SethJ Yes, but the practice in Israel today in more charedi places is the opposite reality. That was my point, and it is ironic. \u2013\u00a0 avi Sep 5 '12 at 16:51\nI recognize that. My point is that you say \"the halacha is actually the opposite...\", which, cynically, is something that, if it were actually followed, would provoke negative feelings the opposite way, rather than promote harmony. I'm not saying that by adopting Ashkenazi practices Sephardim are creating harmony, or that they are not discriminated against as a result. I'm just pointing out that the \"halacha\" you cite is really, more than anything else, rightly or wrongly, an attempt to keep Sephardim from assimilating. \u2013\u00a0 Seth J Sep 5 '12 at 16:59\n@SethJ The halacha has been that way for over 500 years. The Ashkenazi poskim could have said the same thing the sephardim poskim said, but they didn't for whatever reason. \u2013\u00a0 avi Sep 5 '12 at 17:21\nadd comment\n\nIn today's society, Sephardic Jews do not necessarily dress in a particular style of clothing, rather they will wear attire in accordance to any orthodox dress code. My experience in attending Nefesh Bondi (integrated both Sephardic and Ashkenazi) & Sephardic synagogue was unusual to standardised Sephardic clothing. The Chazzan wore a black suit and Hat, even the rabbi in the Sephardic synagogue also wore black. My guess with wearing white suits probably represents purity and holiness such as on Yom Kippur. Since Yom Kippur is a one time event, (even Ashkenazi Jews) would not turn away wearing white. It all comes down to Halakhah [Jewish law] I was told by my (Chabad) rabbi's wife in-laws that if \"The rabbi's make a decision on anything - than it becomes the law\". The general idea is that if it is allowed, then why not. Throughout history Jews in different countries have developed there own style and customs being influenced whether by persecution or integration. My Sephardi rabbi, wears piyot because he thinks there cool, not necessarily a Sephardi custom.\n\nI once asked a Chabad rabbi why Jews in Chabad circles do not wear ... (truncated)",

She also barks at every noise and people.\nSubmitted: 3 years ago.\nCategory:\u00a0Dog Training\nExpert:\u00a0 Jane Lefler replied\u00a03 years ago.\nHi JaCustomer,\nMy name is Jane. I have been working professionally with animals especially dogs in both health and behavioral issues for over 18 years. I have over 14,000 satisfied customers. It will be my pleasure to work with you today.\nIn order to supply you with the best information, I do need to ask for some additional information. Once I receive your answer, it will likely take me about 30-45 minutes to type up your response. I hope you can be patient.\nIs she nipping as a result of her panic or are they separate issues?\nDoes she nip and bite you (her owners)?\nIs she allowed on furniture?\nWhat obedience training has she had?\nCan you give me some details on when she has nipped or bit including what was going on before, during and what your reaction was?\nHow do you discipline her?\nWhat breed or closest one is she?\nIs she spayed?\n\nCustomer: replied\u00a03 years ago.\n\nThey are seperate issues.\n\nShe nips and bites owners and visitors when we try to leave the house or hug each other any time.\n\nShe is allowed on furniture only when we say she can.\n\nNo obedience training-not great with other dogs but knows many commands which she follows, but she ignores any commands when we leave the house.\n\nShe has bit\/nipped when shut in a separate room when the door goes, and often when my 16 year old daughter tries to stop her getting out of the front door after i leave the house- i ignore her. Bites any time somebody picks up a handbag or puts shoes\/cardigan on.\n\nTo discipline Bella, we reward positive behaviour and we ignore negative behaviour, sometimes shut the door on her when she barks so she stops instantly.\n\nBella is a Sprollie- Springer x Collie and has been spayed.\n\nExpert:\u00a0 Jane Lefler replied\u00a03 years ago.\nThanks for that information. It sounds like she is a dominant dog. Dominant dogs will nip and bite to reprimand the other pack members when they feel they are doing something the dominant dog does not approve of. IN this case, apparently she doesn't like people leaving or stopping her from leaving indicated by her biting when people do those things that indicate they are getting ready to leave her.\n\nSo to correct this situation, you need to establish all the humans as the bosses and her as the lower ranking member of the pack. The fastest way of accomplishing this is formal obedience training. YOu don't have to go to formal classes initially as you can train at home and involve everyone. However, eventually you need to finish her obedience training in an environment where there are distraction like a formal training class.\n\nThe following site is helpful for teaching you how to train your dog. Be sure and click on the link to the page on obedience at the bottom. and links on subsequent pages leading to detailed instructions.\n\nTraining works best if you train at least 30 minutes a day (two 15 minute sessions). I would start making your dog work via the Nothing in life is free program (NILF). It is outlined below.\n\nAs I mentioned, all the humans need to be involved with training. You also need to stop allowing her to be on furniture. It raises her physically to the same level as the humans so she feels equal or higher than the humans especially since she has teeth and is not afraid to use them. Keeping her on the floor will help lower her both physically and mentally.\n\nI recommend using hot dog slices or liver slivers for treats. They can be messy but are very effective at getting a dog to work (obedience train). When a dog obeys even if for a treat, it makes them just a little more submissive to that person naturally lowering the dog in the pack.\n\nShe is a herding breed so nipping comes naturally and she is likely to have a lot of energy, so you need to have an outlet for that energy. Try at least two 30-45 minute fast paced (not strolls) walks. You can get a back pack and add cans and water to exercise her even more.\n\nI would keep a short leash on her at all times to help with training. While I agree with positive training techniques, I also believe a dog should have consequences for misbhaving. You will be reprimanding her. A reprimand would be a short tug on the leash to break her concentration and a firm low toned, growl like \"NO\". This lets her know that the behavior is unacceptable. Rewarding her for the desired behavior is important as well. So if she doesn't bite when she would have previously. This helps her see what behavior you expect out of her instead of the bad behavior.\n\nYou can set up situations where she bites so you can use reprimands to correct her. Practice over and over such as someone putting on their shoes in front of her. Someone elses gives the reprimand if she goes to nip and rewards if she doesn't. She'll learn quickly how to get the treat and stop the nipping.\n\nYou can use the same reprimand and reward system to stop the barking. While you have been rewarding some behavior, you have no reprimands for bad behavior except shutting the door. Bark collars are very effective but the contacts have to be able to touch the throat, so the hair might need to be trimmed if you decide to try one.\n\nOnce she is pretty much trained, go to a formal class. In addition, teach her to sit when you are leaving. Have her sit while you open the door and reward her. Then have her sit while you walk out and back in so she starts to see you leaving as not necessarily being gone for a long time. She'll also start seeing that as an opportunity to receive a treat sinc eyou will be rewarding her. Of course over time, the treats will be reduced and praise used instead still throwing a treat in now and again to keep reinforcing the training.\nThese techniques should take care of the problems. I hope this information is helpful to you and you are satisfied with my response.

The good news is that if you stop taking steroids, your hair fall may stop eventually. But, in others, the hair loss may continue even after stopping the steroids.\n\nHow do you stop alopecia spreading?\n\nThe following may help you manage alopecia:Avoid hair and scalp trauma. Use a soft-bristled hair brush and wide-toothed comb to protect your scalp from damage. \u2026 Eat healthy foods. Hair loss can be caused by poor nutrition. \u2026 Reduce stress. Try to get enough sleep and daily exercise.\n\nDo steroid shots work for hair loss?\n\nSteroid injections have been used for alopecia areata since 1958. Studies from the 1970\u2019s showed that hair regrowth was found in 71% of people with Alopecia Areata, when treated every 2 weeks for 3 times. In another study, 63% of those receiving monthly steroid injections found regrowth at 4 months.\n\nWhat is the best treatment for female hair loss?\n\nHow is female hair loss treated? Minoxidil (Rogaine) 5% is the only topical medication approved by the FDA for female-pattern hair loss. The once daily use foam treatment regrows hair in 81% of the women who try it. Liquid options of 2% and 5% solutions are available over the counter.\n\nCan hair grow back after thinning?\n\nIf the reason for thinning hair is genetics, it will not grow back on its own. To grow back a healthy, full head of hair, you\u2019ll need to take action, and that involves reviewing different hair loss options.\n\nDoes hormonal hair loss grow back?\n\nThis type of hair loss happens when white blood cells attack hair follicles, causing the hair to thin and fall out, usually in round patches. This type of hair loss will require treatment as hair may not grow back.\n\nCan you put steroid cream on scalp?\n\nIn people with seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp, use of topical steroids for 4 weeks or less reduces symptoms more than placebo but has a similar effect to calcineurin inhibitors or azoles.\n\nIs hydrocortisone good for alopecia?\n\nIntralesional corticosteroids: Intralesional corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of alopecia areata. In fact, they are the first-line treatment in localized conditions involving <50% of the scalp22. Hydrocortisone acetate (25mg\/ml) and Triamcinolone acetonide (5-10mg\/ml) are commonly used.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between cortisone and hydrocortisone?\n\nHydrocortisone and cortisone are identical short-acting corticosteroids. However, they are not the same. Cortisone is an inactive prodrug that is converted into hydrocortisone, or cortisol, in the liver. Hydrocortisone works as a topical medication whereas cortisone is not as effective as a topical treatment.\n\nWhat steroid cream is used for alopecia?\n\nFluocinolone acetonide cream 0.2% (Synalar HP) twice daily or betamethasone dipropionate cream 0.05% (Diprosone) has been used. For refractory alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis, 2.5 g of clobetasol propionate under occlusion with a plastic film 6 days\/wk for 6 months helped a minority of patients.\n\nDoes hydrocortisone cream cause hair growth?\n\nStinging, burning, irritation, dryness, or redness at the application site may occur. Acne, unusual hair growth, \u201chair bumps\u201d (folliculitis), skin thinning\/discoloration, or stretch marks may also occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\nCan I use hydrocortisone on my scalp?\n\nWhen hydrocortisone cream can be used to treat seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, it doesn\u2019t actually treat dandruff. Dandruff is typically treated with medicated shampoos that contain either salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or zinc pyrithione.\n\nDoes cortisone stop hair loss?\n\nCorticosteroid injections, like all treatments for alopecia areata, do not prevent new hair loss from developing. While there are few reported side effects related to this kind of treatment, temporary depressions (called \u201cdells\u201d) in the skin may result from the injections. However, these usually improve with time.\n\nWhat would a dermatologist prescribe for hair loss?\n\nIt can stop hairs from getting thinner and stimulate hair growth on the top of the scalp. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved minoxidil to treat hair loss. It is the only hair re-growth product approved for men and women. A dermatologist may combine minoxidil with another treatment.\n\nWhat kills fungus on the scalp?\n\nUse an antifungal shampoo These shampoos kill bacteria and fungus on the scalp and stop inflammation. You can purchase them from a grocery store or drugstore. Look for shampoos with antifungal active ingredients, such as ketoconazole, selenium sulfide, and pyrithione zinc.\n\nWhat is the best medicine for alopecia areata?\n\nPatchy alopecia areataMinoxidil: Also known by the brand name Rogaine\u00ae, minoxidil can help you keep the hair growth stimulated by another treatment. \u2026 Corticosteroids you apply: You apply this medication to the bald spots once or twice a day as instructed by your dermatologist.More items\u2026",

        "text":"Do you have any suggestions for protein-rich snacks that aren\u2019t\u00a0nuts?\n\nask our dietitian your question todayhigh protein snacks\n\n\nI\u2019d like to switch my diet to a healthier one, but am running into a problem. Many of the articles and suggested menus with recipes and snacks include NUTS in most of the breakfasts and almost all of the snack options for protein. I\u2019m allergic to nuts, so it\u2019s discouraging that it\u2019s so difficult to find options that I can actually eat. Do you have any suggestions for protein-rich snacks that aren\u2019t nuts? \u2013 Blair B.\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! Snack proteins can be the same as your entr\u00e9e choice, just smaller. You can always take your favorite meal and keep a half serving for a leftover snack. If reheated mini meals aren\u2019t for you, consider portable options that don\u2019t require a microwave. Plant options include soynuts, edamame, sunflower seeds, pepitas, bean salad and hummus. Animal-based snack options include hard-cooked eggs, jerky, yogurt, cottage cheese, string cheese and canned tuna.\n\n\nTo keep it simple choose a protein and combine it with a serving of fruit, starch or vegetable for a satisfying snack. Classics include: cheese + apple; hummus + carrots; and tuna + crackers. Or try combining more than one side in smaller amounts. Examples: 1) top Greek yogurt with berries and a nut-free granola that you\u2019ve added hemp or chia seeds to; 2) scoop up bean salsa and guacamole with baked pita chips; 3) for trail mix, combine soynuts and pepitas with dried cranberries, circle or square-shaped cereal and shredded coconut.\n\nYou can swap in soy \u2018nut\u2019 butter or sunflower seed butter in any recipe calling for almond or peanut butter. Either tastes great spread on a small wheat tortilla and wrapped around a banana. Try stuffing a handful of dates with some\u2026Hand wipes or napkin required.\n\n\u2013\u00a0Debbie J., MS, RD\n\nDo you have a question about your diet or nutrition?\n\nAsk our dietitian by submitting your question to or simply ask it in the COMMENTS section below.
