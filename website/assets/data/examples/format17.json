Is it really that hard to replace this toilet seat? Do I buy just any standard size seat or what to look for?\n\nHelp and Thanks\n\nAnswer Question\n\nAsked by Anonymous at 1:08 AM on Aug. 5, 2009 in Home & Garden\n\nAnswers (8)\n  \u2022 all you have to know is of it is round or oblong..why do women rely on men for everything?\n\n    Answer by Anonymous at 1:18 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 Once you get the right size seat (round or oblong), you unscrew the nuts that hold it on, put the new one on, and tighten the nuts. There's nothing to it--it's a five minute job (and that includes getting the new seat out of its box).\n\n    Answer by SWasson at 6:46 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 so funny. yup, you can do this. testicles not required.\n\n    Answer by jewjewbee at 8:27 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 measure it (or take it with you); go to a hardware store. it takes about 2 minutes.\n\n    Answer by rkoloms at 9:52 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 It is not hard to change a toilet seat. I do this everytime I move into a new rental property. Go to Home Depot or Lowes and pick one up. You just need a screw driver.\n\n    Duct tape on a toilet seat is kind of gross so you should do this right away.\n\n    Answer by Niki_sd at 11:21 AM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 They are easy to change...if you don't see the screws on the hinges just remove the cap over the hinge. Unscrew....remove seat...bring with you to store to make sure you get the right size....\n    go home...screw new one on toilet seat. !\n\n    Answer by jjessers at 2:39 PM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 Ive changed probably 15 toilet seats (boys are ROUGH with toilet seats.. LOL) seriously it isn't that hard.. Go to the store buy a seat that is similar to the one you have now , there really aren't THAT many choices to choose from you buy it, bring it home.. Pop up the little cap things behind the toilet seat, unscrew the screws, remove seat, throw away.. Then put the new seat down onto the toilet, screw the little screw things back in put the caps back down and voila a new toilet seat!\n\n    Oh and btw, toilet seats are fairly cheap too,.\n\n    Answer by KalebsMommee at 5:46 PM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\n  \u2022 I just bought a new toilet seat with the child seat connected to it. They're not expenisve. You look at your toilet and see if it's a round boul or oblong bowl. That is it. Oh and the color is white if the toilet is white not bone or off white.\n\n    Answer by SylviaNCali at 9:18 PM on Aug. 5, 2009\n\nJoin CafeMom now to contribute your answer and become part of our community.

However, for this sort of situation on a UNIX system, generally all you would have to do is restore the filesystem backup and boot ASE. On Windows, to restore registry entries, I'd guess that you might have to reinstall the ASE software. You can presumably download from SAP the same patch you were running on before this event and run the installer after restoring the file system and tell it to install in the same place. This would likely restore all the registry entries created by an initial install.\n\nTry that and see if you can at least get ASE booted, we can then try working out what needs to be done to resolve any finer-detailed issues.\n\n\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded\nTilman Model-Bosch\nMar 09 at 08:06 AM\n\nI think you can install a completely new SAP system using SAPINST. Make sure DB layout is exactly the same as the original one.\n\nOnce it is up an running replace the new device files of ASE with those of the file system backup.\n\nHopt this helps\n\n\n10 |10000 characters needed characters left characters exceeded",

Or does it even\n\nYou can get a job at the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Bureau of Investigations. I believe they put you through school if you qualify.\n\nHope that helps???\n\nBest regards\n\nClaude Ammons\nCorinthian Group\nCA PI # 23070\n\nPrivate Investigations and Personal Security\n\nAll Answers\n\nAnswers by Expert:\n\nAsk Experts\n\n\nClaude Ammons\n\n\nI enjoy answering questions relating to private & general investigations including but not limited to locates, skip tracing, surveillance, stalking, child custody, criminal defense, civil, corporate security\/executive protection, workplace violence\/threat assessments, personal security, security surveillance systems and GPS tracking\/monitoring products & services. Specifically, I answer questions regarding state laws concerning private investigation practices, as well as the best practices & standard operating procedures used by most reputable private investigative firms. I can give you state & federal references when dealing with issues that may or may not be legal in your specific state. IE- Some states have laws which conflict with federal law such as California's \"2 party law\" for surreptitious audio recordings. I offer tips on how to identify the right investigative firm for your particular case and what type of questions that investigative firm should be asking you. QUICK TIP #1: NEVER hire a Private Investigative firm that is not concerned about providing you a written contract that specifically outlines the agreement and responsibilities of both parties!!! A written contract should be expected & demanded by both investigative firm and client 95% of the time. I have numerous resources and will point you in the right direction. Whether it is hiring an attorney, a specialist or offering tips on conducting LEGAL investigations & research yourself. I offer advise regarding the kind of info you can legally obtain, what's not legal for you to obtain and when you need to hire a professional to obtain the info on your behalf. Lastly, I have over 20 yrs of experience as a Security Professional\/Consultant and 12+ yrs within the Investigative profession. As the 2009 President of a state Private Investigation Association, I have professional knowledge, experience & established resources that supply me with the most recent legislative issues & industry trends.\n\n\nCorinthian Group experience includes but not limited to all areas of surveillance including Workers Compensation Insurance Fraud, Domestic Infidelity Cases, Computer Investigations & Forensics, Personal Injury & Automobile Liabilty, Loss Prevention, theft interviewing & interrogation techniques, Under Cover assignments, Stalking prevention & suppression, surveillance tactics & countermeasures and surveillance system & lighting consultation experience. Corinthian Group also has experience in security consultation & protective services to the corporate & private sector. These services include Bodyguard\/Executive Protection, identity theft prevention, work place violence & volitale terminations, GPS tracking\/monitoring services, TSCM\/Debugging( Technical Surveillance Countermeasures) and security system products & diagramming experience.\n\n2009 PICA President (Professional Investigators of California Association) NCISS (National Council of Investigations & Security Services)-Member CALI (California Association of Licensed Investigators)-Member SCFIA (Southern California Fraud Investigators Association)-Member WAD (World Association of Detectives)-Member\n\nPublications Hellium: Blog: and my m\n\nPSO (Security Course) Weaponless Defense Tai Karate & MMA training Wicklander & Zulawski-Interview & Interrogation Techniques Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST)-832 Level 3 CA State licensed Private Investigator-CA PI # 23070 Law Enforcement Training Center-Computer Investigations\n\nAwards and Honors\nElected as the Association President of PICA in 2009.

Use a round brush, preferably natural bristle (like from, on sections of hair as you are drying. Take sections of hair from the root onto the brush and pull it straight as you aim the blowdryer on the hair (do it quickly so you don't expose the hair to too much heat). The straightening balm needs the heat of the dryer and the tension of the brush to help the hair straighten, so don't expect to just put the balm on and blowdry as usual. The more you use this method of drying your hair, the easier it will become. I style my hair like this every day and it takes only 5-10 minutes.\n\nIn terms of hair style and length, I also have wavy hair and I find that wearing it mostly all one length and medium to long in length, rather than short, helps weigh the hair down and makes it easier to control. Try a cut that is near or just past shoulder length.\n\nFinally, talk to your hairdresser about products and styling that she suggests for you. She knows your hair and can help you work with the texture.\n\nGet Ask The Makeup Diva Delivered to Your E-mail box Every Week!
