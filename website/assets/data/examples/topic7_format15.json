It was my first thought this morning. I hate mornings. But there it was \u2013 motherfucker \u2013 hanging like a piece of forbidden fruit. You know, I wasn\u2019t going to go there. Like I said, I had plenty of other M words to write about today. But a quick google search changed my mind.\n\nThe letter M.\n\n\nCrawl through the depths of my google search history. Do it.\n\n\nI\u2019ll tell you where it came from \u2013 from\u00a0a Burton.\u00a0Burton. Hi, I\u2019m Julie Burton. I\u2019m married to Scott Burton. Scott is the son of his dad, a Burton. And Scott\u2019s dad is the son of another Burton \u2013 Scott\u2019s grandmother.\n\nI\u00a0wouldn\u2019t dedicate this post out of disrespect to Scott\u2019s grandmother. I mean, if you\u2019re offended by the word motherfucker, then don\u2019t read it. Hopefully she\u2019s still reading because this is a family history lesson.\n\n\nFuck is of Germanic origin. Fuck comes from the German, Dutch, and Swedish words for \u201cto strike\u201d or \u201cto move back and forth.\u201d\n\nYou need to go back to 1528 to find the first fuck written. An anonymous monk was reading a book on moral conduct. This book of conduct pissed him off in some way.\u00a0He wrote, \u201cO d fuckin Abbot\u201d on the page as a side note. Historians don\u2019t know if he meant \u201cfuckin\u201d meaning \u201cthe Abbot was having sex even though he\u2019s a monk\u201d sort of way or if he meant \u201cfuckin\u201d in the \u201cintensifier word\u201d sort of way. Fuckin\u2019 Abbot.\n\nThe Abbot the anonymous monk was referring to \u2013 a man named John Burton. He was shady as fuck. Apparently he had questionable morals. It must run in the family.\n\nMy source: Huffington Post. A F*cking Short History of the F-Word. By Melissa Mohr\n\nAnd there you go. A family history lesson on the name Burton. A name I married into \u2013 Julie \u201cMotherfucker\u201d Burton.\n\n\nWait, don\u2019t go! Find me on\u00a0FacebookTwitter, and\u00a0Instagram",

I went from seven and a half stone at the age of 11 to a massive 17 stone by the time I was 16, even though I was a mere 5\u20198 in height.

        "text":"Who is Better Than You?\n\nColumn by Michael Norton\n\n\nOne of my closest friends is Frank from Staten Island, N.Y. Frank has a great expression he uses whenever he hears good news about someone or when they experience something positive. He always says, \"Yo, who is better than you?\" with a thick New York accent.\n\nSo as an example, if I were to call him and share with him that I had an incredible trip to Switzerland, he would say, \"Yo, who is better than you?\" sounding like Sylvester Stallone in \"Rocky.\"\n\nWell I was thinking about this and I realized that his expression is really very true, and not just for me but for all of us. When was the last time you looked in the mirror and said, \"Yo, who is better than me?\" and really meant it about yourself.\n\nPositive self-affirmation is so beneficial. Really, positive self-talk or positive self-affirmation can get us through a difficult day, challenging situation, or new opportunity. Or it is simply an incredible way to start each and every day.\n\nYou are gifted and gorgeous. You are brilliant and beautiful. You are a person of character and strength, you live with integrity, you are a hard worker, you are caring and thoughtful, and loving and generous. Feel free to add to the list or fill in the rest of your own story. Claim your qualities and attributes and remind yourself often of who it is that you truly are, how you see yourself, and how you feel about yourself.\n\nWho is better than you? Nobody, that's who.\n\nI have met way too many people who have allowed the opinions and degrading comments of others to shape the view they have of themselves. And even worse, sometimes I have talked to people who have taken it to a whole new level; they practice negative self-talk. Then what happens, they ask the same question but give a different answer, they ask \"Yo, who is better than me?\" but their answer is \"Everybody is better than me.\"\n\nIt really doesn't matter how old we are, how young we are or what profession we are in. It doesn't matter if we are married, in a relationship, or single. What does matter is that we believe in ourselves, seeing the beauty and the goodness in who we are, and reminding ourselves each day as we look in the mirror by asking Frank's simple question ... \"Yo, who is better than you?\" Then answer it, \"Nobody, that's who.\"\n\nNow I am not suggesting egotistical behavior that just might be misunderstood as conceit. What I am recommending is a healthy and super positive belief in you.\n\nI am so grateful for my friend Frank and love his expression, \"Yo, who is better than you?\" and I would love to hear all of your positive attributes and qualities at gotonorton@gmail.com. This is going to be a better than good week, I just know it will.\n\n\n\nNo comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here\nPlease log in or register to add your comment",

        "text":"No More Vikings\n\nHis sweat smelled like Cheetos and he wore a kilt.\u00a0 Yes, my date on this balmy, humid, moisture dripping late July Sunday afternoon fancies himself a Scottish Viking plunked down in the middle of central Pennsylvania.\n\n\nLest anyone think I deem every date over 6\u2019 as Viking in stature because of my previously recounted encounter with a certain Ginger Viking, I feel the need to clarify that this time it was the gentleman who described himself as \u201cA Geek Brain in a Viking Frame\u201d in the opening tag of his online profile.\u00a0 He even reinforced it with a photo of himself ensconced in a horned helmet.\u00a0 \u00a0Be still my quivering loins!\u00a0 Actually, for a 5\u20192\u201d sapiosexual this combination can be quite alluring.\n\n\nI don\u2019t have a physical type per se.\u00a0 I have dated men exactly the same height as me and men who top out at 6\u20196\u201d.\u00a0 P.S.\u00a0 One of those did not give me a crick in the neck to kiss while standing.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure all you smart folks can guess which one.\u00a0 They have been thin and meaty and every variety in between.\u00a0 However, there is a certain visceral appeal to tall, burly men for a sturdy farm girl like me.\u00a0 I might be pocket size in height but the rest of me is soft and fleshy, strong and sturdy, Rubenesque instead of waif.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0There is an instinctual tremble in my lower gut to men who look like they can toss me around my own bed with ease.\u00a0 And maybe with a growl\u2026\u2026\n\n\nAnd isn\u2019t that the whole point of dating?\u00a0 To find someone enjoyable with whom to converse and then toss each other around naked?\n\n\nA Geek Brain in a Viking Frame certainly sounds like someone who might understand my references to Sonic Screwdrivers, entertain a debate on how the zombie genre is actually intense social commentary with bonus special FX make-up AND be able to pick a farm girl up and throw her on the bed all manly, where\u2019s my mead, I just sailed my longboat across the bitter Atlantic and conquered EVERYONE style.\u00a0 It always sounds good on paper. \u00a0In theory, and internet dating algorithm magic, we should be a perfect union.\u00a0 OK Cupid said so, weighing in at a confident 99% match.\u00a0 The Interweb never lies, right?\n\n\nTo be fair, I knew about the kilt pre date.\u00a0 We had seen each other\u2019s pictures but he also did the we-met-online real people version of \u201cI\u2019ll be wearing a red carnation in my lapel, meet at the top of the Empire State Building, life is a Nora Ephron movie\u201d by telling me he would be the super tall one in the kilt by the picnic tables.\u00a0 We were meeting for a free concert in the park (no super awkward moments over who pays the check this time!) with some time before to take a walk and try out our conversational compatibility before it might be drowned out by the funky fresh beat of The Pimps of Joytime.\u00a0 No, no I did not make that up and it brings me great glee to say it even now.\u00a0 So much so I might just do it again.\u00a0 The Pimps of Joytime.\u00a0 Pimps, you are welcome for the free publicity\u2026..\u00a0 Hmmmm, that didn\u2019t come out right\u2026.. \u00a0My original thought before being distracted by fun band names is that I am totally judgment free on the kilt.\u00a0 Be you, be free.\u00a0\u00a0 However, being judgment free doesn\u2019t mean the 12 year old boy in me isn\u2019t currently karaoking a very inappropriate scrotal parody of Tom Petty\u2019s Free Fallin\u2019.\nAt least it\u2019s a breeze free day.\n\n\n\nWho am I to judge anyway?\u00a0 I\u2019m a 36-yr-old showing up in Heidi Ann braids like I\u2019m getting ready to climb up the mountain and milk a goat for my grandfather.\u00a0 The sturdy farm girl in me rears her head again!\u00a0 There\u2019s no escaping one\u2019s roots.\u00a0 Call me Swiss Miss Girl if you must but braids keep my neck cooler.\u00a0 A bun tends to make me look a bit Amish.\u00a0 This is central PA so it\u2019s not that far-fetched.\u00a0 Please Google it up if you\u2019re unaware of the religious sect that eschews modern convenience and made my learning to drive as a teenager a game of Frogger:\u00a0 Horse and Buggy Edition.\n\n\nSo, I knew there would be a kilt even though there isn\u2019t any restaurant serving haggis around and the Renaissance Faire grounds are a good 20 minutes north.\u00a0 What I did not know is that his posted pictures were all fresh out of the Just For Men dye job box and it had been quite some time since a revisit to the Rite-Aid.\u00a0 Before the tsking starts about skipping my stones on the well, aren\u2019t you shallow pond, I actually prefer salt and pepper, or straight up gray, and people who embrace aging instead of bowing to the oppressive cult of youth perpetrated by the commercialism juggernaut that permeates our culture these days.\u00a0 I\u2019m also for doing things that make you feel better about yourself, so if it involves tinfoil and combing in some squid ink, comb away!\u00a0 What I don\u2019t care for is a jarring discontinuity between what one puts forth as truth and what is actually truth.\u00a0 I try to be exceedingly honest these days before I meet a new man in person because life is too short for bullshit.\u00a0 If they don\u2019t bolt or Casper, we\u2019re already a leg up on someone being tied to a bedrail.\u00a0 Apparently, and unfortunately, not everyone shares this view.\u00a0 I really could have cared less about his gray beard and his bald head if I had known but all his pictures were of a hale and hearty raven haired Viking with a full and bountiful beard.\u00a0 I felt duped from 50 paces out.\u00a0 But I\u2019m trying to be all 7-11 Open these days and I get the impetus to smudging the online truth to put yourself in the best light.\n\n\nI committed to an outing and I don\u2019t flake.\u00a0 Even when my second impression via super-awkward first meeting hug is the wafting scent of stale corn chips leaking out his skin and directly into my nostrils.\u00a0 I wish I didn\u2019t recognize that smell but I do.\u00a0 Years of a myriad of unwanted scents from working in healthcare tells me this is very much the aroma of unwashed men, with incredibly poor grooming habits, sweating profusely.\u00a0 At the hospital, they sweat from pain and fever.\u00a0 Here, it\u2019s the late afternoon sun beating down.\u00a0 I use every ounce of will not to look at his toenails for fear I become the sturdy, white farm girl version of Usain Bolt and sprint the fuck out of here.\n\n\nI take a deep breath (upwind), smile, and agree to drop our blankets in the concert area before setting out for our conversational constitutional.\u00a0 Yes, more sweat.\u00a0 Sure, great idea.\u00a0 The park has a large man made pond with ducks to feed and even a swan or two.\u00a0 A walking path encircles the whole she-bang and we set out to trek around it, mosquitos and West Nile be damned.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The conversation is pleasant enough, if not a bit stifled and lacking a certain zest.\u00a0 His grown kids, him going back to school at 40-something.\u00a0 Plenty of geek related topics, touching on Game of Thrones and World War Z.\u00a0 The book, not the movie.\u00a0 Read.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Studies show readers tend to have more empathy and we sure could use that in our current cultural and political state\u2026\u2026 but I\u2019ll get back on topic before I start a tirade about joining the resistance and donning a pussy hat of my own.\u00a0 Back to July and pre-What clipartfest.comthe Fuck Did We Do Election.\u00a0 He likes going to goth dance nights in his kilts.\u00a0 I can only imagine the smell at 2 am after a night of glow sticks and Industrial music.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though about walking with a man over a foot taller:\u00a0 My stubby legs literally can\u2019t keep up unless I STRIDE.\u00a0 He\u2019s STROLLING.\u00a0 I\u2019m STRIDING.\u00a0 For every step he takes I must take two.\u00a0 My own sweat is gathering in the small of my back, rolling from the under swell of my breasts and down my sides.\u00a0 Thanks to the shower I took pre date, I\u2019m pretty sure I smell like clean sweat and not stale corn chips but who knows at this point?\u00a0 It\u2019s all mingling together with the pungent smell of duck shit.\u00a0 After our ten thousandth trip around I realize sandals may not have been the best choice.\u00a0 I dressed for a leisurely Sunday stroll and an open air concert enjoyed from a blanket with fireflies in the dusk and people watching, not a death march a la Stephen King as Richard Bachman Long Walk style.\u00a0 I can feel the blisters forming on the pads and arches of my feet.\u00a0 Cheeto Sweat is not worth band aids over bleeding blisters.\u00a0 Luckily, it\u2019s almost show time for some Pimps.\u00a0 Oh, but I\u2019m more than ready for a little Joytime.\n\n\nThe next few hours are quite joyful in music.\u00a0 I people watch and dog watch and kid watch.\u00a0 I often go to these summer concerts alone in this park, spreading my blanket out and watching the hipsters hula hoop, the dogs sniff each other, and the kids roll in the grass.\u00a0 The concerts themselves are always a great way to wrap up a weekend.\u00a0 The Scottish Viking and I talk some more but after a bit I lay back and stare at the trees above us, letting the music pound through my sternum and under my ribs.\u00a0 I let it wash over me.\u00a0 I bop my head against the blanket, against the earth below it, a tree root digging straight into my lower back.\u00a0 I let myself go and be here, in this moment.\u00a0 There is no date, no Scottish Viking reeking of stale snacks.\u00a0 Only me with the feel of the cooling grass under my bare toes flung over the edge of the blanket, only the beat bopping the braids right out of my hair.\u00a0 I open my eyes to the dimming sun, watching the bats swirl through the trees above now that the moon shines more brightly.\u00a0 The Scottish Viking, trying to assert his Grown Man Gothness and Look At Me Nonconformity remarks bats are among his favorite animals.\u00a0 I close my eyes so he can\u2019t see me roll them in the remnants of light.\u00a0 Remark it\u2019s time to pack it up.\n\n\nCheeto Sweat obliges and offers me a ride back to my car I left outside the park since his truck is close.\u00a0 I weigh my options of another long walk on my burgeoning blisters or another ten minutes with him in a more enclosed space.\u00a0 I choose a ride.\u00a0 At least he\u2019s a touch self-aware enough to roll the windows down.\n\n\nHe drops me at my car and we don\u2019t bother to pretend there will be a second date.\u00a0 It\u2019s obvious there is no chemistry here.\u00a0 Maybe it was the off kilter pheromones.\u00a0 Maybe it was me.\u00a0 Maybe it was him.\u00a0 M...

        "text":"Monday, December 12, 2011\n\nWeekend Recap\n\nHappy Monday! I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend!\u00a0Mine was pretty great\u00a0: ) Lots of relaxing and snuggling with the boy between Friday and Saturday. I couldn't get enough of being wrapped up with a blanket on the couch with Ryan. It was so cold....I hate going out because I have to put what seems like 20 layers on just to stay warm! On Sunday the weather got a little nicer and the temp was up around 50 so we ventured out to run some errands and such. Although I did get dressed up for a date on Saturday night (which was amazing-sushi!), the rest of the weekend my outfits didn't get past this point....\nWeekend by thesweetashleylife (<~~~Click to view items)\nI had to have my scarf, boots, and wool socks. Yes, I even asked if I looked like a teeny bopper, with my boots and skinnies.....Ryan assured me that I could 'pull it off'. Haha I'm not sure if I'm happy with that or sad! Either way, I stayed warm!\n\nEven though we spent a lot of time at home, we still had some fun! We drank this season's first batch of eggnog (someone might have spiked it...), ate\u00a0pizza, watched movies (Perfect Host, which was pretty good) and laughed at some SNL goodness. I even made two more wreaths yesterday to ship out. So, add productive to the list!\n\nThis morning I've been\u00a0trying to figure out my holiday schedule. Between figuring out time off from work, figuring out a moving schedule, figuring out the time we'll be spending with family (here and in KY), plus all of the normal stuff--I can't keep track of it all! We'll start moving late next week so I have a ton to do between now and then BUT I'm\u00a0super excited about seeing everyone between now and the end of the year!\n\nOh yea, have any of you seen these funny pics of Christopher Walken? I find them randomly and I always crack up! I can't be the only one....right?!\nA friend sent this one...\n\nWhat did you do this past weekend? Are you getting excited about the holidays?\n\n\nMacKensie said...\n\nBahaha those Christopher Walken photos are amazing.\n\nElizabeth said...\n\nRandom question: How do you make those outfit pictures on one pic? I'm apparently not that smart to do that.=) Good luck moving!",

Woodchuck, Kel and Squirrel lived on the west coast at that time and met us in Seattle when we there to board a cruise to Alaska. Unfortunately all of them have dropped out of the bloggosphere. We read about their adventures on Facebook, but it is not the same. \u00a0Woodchuck (aka Bob) and Kel have become good freinds, they now live in northern Indiana and we see them from time to time. \u00a0I should let Squirrel know I am going to be in Portland in a \u00a0week or so.\n\nAnd now through the Bloggerpoloza we have met a new and larger circle of friends. \u00a0I have seen a couple of you outside of the gathering and I look forward to meeting more. \u00a0I have to make it Wales one of these days.\n\n\n  1. I would LOVE to meet squire john gray in person; such a loveable chap, don't you think? I have spoken with him by telephone.\n\n    many of the people I have met thru blogging are the salt of the earth. others...well, I have to avoid due to toxic temperaments. some have quit blogging, others have crossed the rainbow bridge to the atmosphere, others I have lost interest in over time. but there are so many people to be discovered yet!\n\n    I am glad I have met you and sweet bear thru the magic of the internet connections!\n\n  2. I've met a few bloggers and they were all fantastic.",

How many people would love to lose weight before they get married.. probably everyone and I was granted the best gift ever. My MGB from March 2009 allowed me to have an amazing wedding with dancing and kneeling and jumping.. It may sound strange to say this but as a 350lbs person these experiences would be totally different.\n\nMy wife is amazing.. the best friend.. the best companion. She has been with me at 350 and now at 170. She is one of the reasons I decided to have the MGB and I am thankful to God that I made the decision to have it done.\n\nHoneymoon here we come!\n\nNewer Posts Older Posts Home",

Full of wonder and full of entertaining explanations and questions. Five teeters on the edge of home and world in this delirious new experience called \"school,\" a place where baby brains become full with education, friendship, growth and development. Five is magical. Five is inspirational. Five loves being five.\n\nAnd five years after her arrival on this earth, she is, to me, delightful, wonderful and inspirational. Kyrie, five years later, has grown to include all of you in her life, to include many other children in heaven waiting for their parents, friends, family.\n\nI love that she shares a birthday with perhaps our number one fan, Susan, aka Easter Bunny. Kyrie also shares a birthday with my dear godson, who has volunteered at several of the foundation's events. Born on Labor Day five years ago, perhaps that was a sign, too, of the work that would be presented to all of us to fight this fight, to protect kindergartners' brains.\n\nI believe that we received a birthday gift for Kyrie last night. It's something that I've alluded to in the past couple months, and in a few weeks, I hope to share some good, big news\u2014a gift that could mean a lot to the foundation.\n\nAnd in the spirit of appreciating the 5-year-olds in your life or remembering what 5 years old was like with one of your children, I hope you'll come September 18 to celebrate this journey with us.\n\nHappy birthday, sweet Kyrie. We love you dearly and miss you terribly. Thank you so much for bringing incredible joy to your parents and for showing us a new reason to be generous with our time, talent and treasure. Please continue to stay with us as we keep working to save children just like you.\n\nNo comments:",

        "text":"Thursday, May 19, 2011\n\n\nPart I:\u00a0 Baby Moses\nMy big 20-week ultrasound was Monday morning, and we learned that Baby Moses is a BOY!\u00a0 I realize the odds were roughly 50\/50 that this baby would be male, but I was still shocked.\u00a0 As in, I didn't know how to react, I asked the ultrasound tech to look again just to make sure, I still have trouble calling the baby \"he.\"\u00a0 I was just very convinced this one was a girl.\u00a0 My intuition regarding pregnancy seems to be worthless.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDaniel and I can't decide yet what we want this little guy's name to be.\u00a0 We looked at a list of Old Testament names online the other night, and it was just comical.\u00a0 We were trying to find some fresh options in all seriousness, but we ended up in fits of laughter multiple times.\u00a0 You know how sometimes you're in situations at church where you have to read some weird biblical name out loud, and someone makes a joke about how you should name your kid that?\u00a0 It was like that, except we're actually trying to figure out what to name our kid.\u00a0 We still have plenty of time to decide, but I am a psycho and want this baby to have a name yesterday.\n\nBaby Moses, if you read this someday, please know that my thinking you were a girl and failing to have a name ready for you is no indication of how I feel about you.\u00a0 I love you just as much as I loved your older brother when he was \"in my tummy.\"\n\nPart II:\u00a0 Baby Ben\nIt's that time again -- time for a new round of Funny Stuff Ben Says and Does!\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 For a little while, Ben knew Daniel's and my first names.\u00a0 But now when you ask him what Mommy or Daddy's name is, he answers, \"Honey.\"\n  \u2022 \u00a0He has a freakish memory.\u00a0 We can read a book or sing a new song once or twice, and he can suddenly fill in the blanks if you ask him to.\n  \u2022 While reading a favorite book about a visit from Nana, he showed extra interest in the page where Nana gives the little-girl protagonist a nightgown.\u00a0 I usually call the nightgown \"pajamas\" to keep it somewhat relevant to my non-nightgown-wearing son, but I explained it a little further this time, and the following conversation ensued:\nMicah: That's a nightgown.\u00a0 Girls wear nightgowns.\nBen: Giwls wear nightgowns.\nMicah: What do boys wear?\nBen: Boys wear... shirts.\nHe states both of these facts several more times, then out of nowhere...\nBen: Giwls wear... nuffins! (hysterical laughter)\nI had no idea this sentiment was one boys spontaneously created before age two.\u00a0 I am in big, big trouble.\n  \u2022 \u00a0He's started calling things \"cute.\"\u00a0 Mommy is cute, Baby Moses is cute, a random baby at the library was cute, animals are cute, etc.\u00a0 And he raises the pitch of his voice when he says it.\n  \u2022 He thinks it's really funny to say that things smell like pepperoni (which sounds extra cute when you can't say the letter R).\n  \u2022 We took him to Lowe's recently, and he is in love.\u00a0 He talks about the \"tool store\" alllllll the time now.\u00a0 The morning after the Lowe's trip, I loaded him in the car to go to Wal-Mart and told him we were going to the store.\u00a0 He excitedly asked, \"Tool store??\u00a0 See jigsaws?\u00a0 Miter saws?\"\n  \u2022 On that same special trip to Lowe's, we bought him a pink sprinkler - an item he dreamed up and has specifically requested for weeks.\u00a0 Apparently our green sprinklers weren't cool enough for him.\u00a0 I didn't even know pink sprinklers existed, so we pretty well had to get it when we saw one for under $3.\u00a0 Maybe someday it will get warm enough to go outside and play with it.\n  \u2022 Have I mentioned before that he is insanely opinionated?\u00a0 And bossy?\u00a0 He will tell you to sit on the floor, and then get upset because he actually wanted you to sit one foot to the left of where you sat.\u00a0 He also tells us frequently, \"No say that!\"\u00a0 I considered it a milestone tonight when he, without being told to ask nicely, said to me, \"No say that, Mommy.\u00a0 Pwease.\"\n  \u2022 He sort of has an imaginary friend?\u00a0 Her name is Goggy (which is all the more bizarre because I had an imaginary friend named Coggy when I was a kid).\u00a0 Goggy started out as a nonsense word that Ben made up to amuse himself.\u00a0 So we might ask, \"Ben, what do you want for breakfast?\"\u00a0 And he would reply, \"Goggy (hysterical laughter)!!\"\u00a0 Somehow over the course of a few weeks, Goggy has morphed into a person that he randomly talks about.\n  \u2022 One of his new favorite play areas is a \"cave\" I made him on our loveseat.\u00a0 The cave is really not that awesome, but crawling in\/out and throwing items in\/out of it entertains him for long stretches.\u00a0 We're talking minutes at a time, people!\u00a0 He also cleans his cave with an ear thermometer, which he calls a \"dust-buster\" (the handle part really does look like a dust-buster -- props to my clever boy on that one).\n\n    Parenting at this stage is quite an adventure.\u00a0 It's more and more fun all the time to see the sweet, cute, witty parts of his personality develop.\u00a0 But I have to get more and more creative to manage the strong-willed, whiney, stinkery parts that are also developing.\u00a0 I complain too often about those latter parts because they sometimes take up a lot of the day, but I honestly LOVE having a toddler.\u00a0 He is a gift that I do not take for granted!\n\nSunday, May 15, 2011\n\n\nOne of the 30 Before 30 items I've been most excited about is paying a surprise visit to my parents.\u00a0 I started realizing, though, that if I waited much longer, I would either have to fly by myself with two kids or pay for an extra plane ticket to make Daniel come with me.\u00a0 So when some of my oldest, dearest friends tried to convince me to pop into central Arkansas at the end of April, I (very, very excitedly) agreed.\n\nme, Rebecca, Whitney, Angela\nThese are my girls :)\u00a0 We try to get together and go to a major-league baseball game at a different park every summer, but two of us didn't stagger our pregnancies very well this year.\u00a0 So we settled for a minor-league game in Little Rock, followed by a little sleepover.\u00a0 We also got to celebrate Whitney's daughter's first birthday and go to a baby shower for Rebecca (who is expecting baby Caroline at the end of June).\u00a0 Have I mentioned that I love these girls?\u00a0 Because I love these girls.\u00a0 I'm beyond thrilled that I got to spend some time with them and celebrate fun things in their lives.\n\nMy girls knew I was coming, but they were just about the only ones.\u00a0 But even with all my secrecy, I didn't quite get to surprise my parents.\u00a0 I knew I would have to call my dad before I got there because I needed a ride from the airport from someone who had a car seat.\u00a0 Then he had to spill the beans to my mom because she kept trying to make plans that interfered with our arrival.\u00a0 So they both knew a few hours before Ben and I landed in Little Rock.\nHis hair was almost this curly the whole trip.\u00a0 That Southern humidity is crazy.\n\nI mentioned here that I was nervous about flying with Ben.\u00a0 I wish I had wasted all those valuable minutes worrying about something else because he did soooo well.\u00a0 I'm still in shock.\u00a0 Everything about flying was the coolest thing he had ever seen.\u00a0 The wings!\u00a0 The machinery (he still talks about \"machine-wee\") inside the wings!\u00a0 All the people!\u00a0 With suitcases!\u00a0 Different colored suitcases with handles!\u00a0 The air conditioner things above our heads!\u00a0 He was hilarious.\u00a0 And never shed a single tear while we were flying (I gave him raisins or jelly beans during take-off and landing, just in case).\u00a0\n\nHe was also pretty excited about seeing Nana, Granddad, and the rest of the familial crew.\u00a0 So excited that he barely slept the entire trip.\u00a0 We never managed to get him to bed on time, and he would wake up around 6am and talk, talk, talk to himself.\u00a0 For at least 30 minutes, non-stop.\u00a0 I guess he had to review all the fun things he had been doing?\u00a0 Who knows.\nA smooch from aunt Mindy (my big brother's wife)\nWe were there Wednesday night through Monday morning, and we squeezed in time with all my siblings, both sets of my grandparents, and a handful of aunts, uncles, and cousins.\u00a0 I can't really remember the last time I went home when it wasn't a holiday, so it felt kind of nice to see everyone without having crazy holiday rushing-around.\u00a0 I'm counting the trip as a success all around.\u00a0 Thanks to all of you who made it possible and made it special!\nCould they BE any cuter?\u00a0 Cale and Jude (big brother's sons), Ben\n\nPS - I did a terrible job of taking pictures (I was having too much fun to bother), so most of these were stolen from my mom.\u00a0 She has more pictures and stories on her own blog here and here.\n\nSunday, May 8, 2011\n\nHe knows me so well.\n\nDaniel took Ben to Target this week and let him pick out a Mother's Day gift for me.\u00a0 According to Daniel's account, Ben understood that he was picking something for Mommy, and he was adamant in his choice.\u00a0 All I can say is, that kid has my tastes pegged:\n\nYou can't tell here, but it has a purple leopard-print design on the other side.\u00a0 It also has a companion cup with a more masculine dog and the message \"King of My Castle.\"\u00a0 After this home run, I think I'm going to let Ben do all our Christmas shopping this year :)\n\nAs excited as I am about that cup, I'm a teensy bit more excited that I've trained Ben to give me \"special kisses\" on command (excuse his pre-nap crankiness, please):\n\nWe are having gorgeous weather here this weekend, and I am maybe a little too excited to wear some of my favorite Spring clothes before I'm too spherical to fit into them.\u00a0 And since I'm rather fond of the dress I wore this morning, I made Daniel take Baby Moses' first official belly picture.\u00a0 Here he\/she is at 19.5 weeks:\n\nI am indescribably thankful for Ben and Baby Mo.\u00a0 They are treasures, and I can hardly believe I get to be their mom.\u00a0 I'm also more and more grateful all the time for my own mom.\u00a0 It's fun to be at a stage of life where I still need her support\/advice\/wisdom\/mothering, but I can also call her just to talk as friends.\u00a0 I can't do my mom justice in a few sentences here, so I'll just sum it up with a big ol' I LOVE MY MOM!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis year on Mother's Day,...

Imagine already trying to keep up being in a country where they speak a whole different language. Not only did I have to learn spanish for everyday life, but I would have the added task of learning the special vocabulary that the Christian community in Argentina uses. As well, I would become aware of the many cultural differences between the Argentine church and the culture of church I grew up in.\n\nThere are many differences and I can't highlight them all in one blogpost. As best as I can, I've tried to bring to life the world of the Argentine church through video, blogs, pics and various forms of social media. One of the biggest differences I notice in the church culture down there is that exclaiming \"OMG\" \"Jesus Christ\" as an expression in daily life isn't considered an insult or taboo the way that it would be in the North American church. If I stubbed my toe and yelled \"FOR CHRIST SAKE\", I might end up with a pep talk about taking Christ name in vain.\n\nMonday, May 21, 2012\n\nFueling Up on Food, Fun & Friendship at Full City Coffee House\n\nSome of the biggest waves ever recorded that have knocked surfers off their surfboards often began with a small breeze of wind causing friction against the calm ocean water. Here in BsAs we've seen just about everything and in many ways we've been here done that. However, every so often someone comes along with an amazing idea that sweeps us off our feet the same way a wave can wipe surfers out.\n\nIt was a day that began just like any other day but the events of the day wound up being anything other than ordinary. I kept hearing a variety of sources rave about Full City Coffee House and how this was one of the best things to ever happen to the food scene down in BsAs.\u00a0 I came expecting to taste just the food but I left the caf\u00e9 that day with something more than just food............friendship :)\n\nMonday, May 14, 2012\n\nSlithering Past those Sneaky Serpents of Stress and Separation\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that some may be out there looking at my life at feeling green with envy. The grass always looks greener on the other side....when you don't see the price the other person has to pay. For me, seeing the world and making friends on other continents is a perk that I wouldn't trade anything int he world for. But this perk has a price that costs more than even the\u00a0costliest ticket to Buenos Aires. And that is the effects of\u00a0separation\u00a0when it comes time to leave. \u00a0What makes\u00a0separation\u00a0even more difficult is when you happen to have someone in particular that actually does not deal well with\u00a0separation.\n\nMonday, May 07, 2012\n\nUntangling the Mysteries of Tango\n\nOne of the best decisions I ever made was to get tangled up in the world of Argentine tango. Not only did I meet people from all walks of life in the lessons and milongas....I gained respect and bragging rights among my peers. This is because most modern day Argentines do not dance tango. In the minds of many of the youth, this is what people their grandparents age do or something that you read about in history books. It's so funny to see the puzzled expressions come to their face when I tell other people my age that I dance tango :O\n\nAmorous Alpacas\n\nAmorous Alpacas",

        "text":"There. I said it out loud and properly. I want squidgy newborns to kiss, smell and cuddle. Sophie is beautiful and lovely but she is now out of the newborn prawn stage. You know what I mean \u2013 where when you pick them up they still stay all folded up and curled? Where they are too little for their own skin and their clothes drown them cos they are so small? Yeah I want that again.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help me that so many of my friends are at various stages of pregnancy. Some are just beginning and others are finding out the sex. Some are about ready to pop. And luckily for me, I can squidge over their babies for now until Autumn when I can try again for my own. My whole body is yearning, literally yearning, to get pregnant. I really do miss the excitement of scans, cravings, bumping out. Even LABOUR! I want to do it again! I want that relief when it\u2019s done and the yucky covered baby is put on you all small and wiggly. I want Sophie to have a brother next (or sister, as long as it\u2019s a baby I couldn\u2019t care less!)\n\nRemember my earlier blog about making smart decisions? Well, yesterday I was at a point I almost told Husband it was a smart decision to have a baby now \u2013 after all, I\u2019d be pregnant for 9 months\u2026and by the time the baby is here we\u2019d have sorted what we need to sort\u2026 *dreams*\u2026\n\nNO! Bad bad thoughts. I must be good. It\u2019s better to sort out life first\n\n\nI just don\u2019t have to like it\u2026Come on\u2026who can resist this face???\n\n\nPlease, Mummy? Can I have a sibling?\nPlease, Mummy? Can I have a sibling?\n\n\n\nBabies, Babies EVERYWHERE\n\nOne Born Every Minute is back! And we all know what that means\u2026BABIES! Teeny newborns being born and the sounds of women in labour \u2013 which depending who you are, could be panting, yelling, screaming or plain sounding like you\u2019re in the throes of an orgasm.\n\nPersonally I was quite quiet. Pushing was harder on my legs (as I mentioned before) and I LOVE One Born. I love seeing those moments of magic where the tiny humans are first into the world. All folded up and not quite in their skin yet. So wrinkly and goopy and just proper bundles of actual love. Made from love (in most cases).\n\nThere are loads of women I am friends with who are all pregnant now in various stages along and I confess to be\u00a0jealous.\n\n\nI have a beautiful five month old daughter who is now grabbing her toes and awaiting her teeth to pop through. I love Sophie with all my heart \u2013 she is my rainbow baby. But GOD do I want another one! Seeing all the newborns around me makes me so, so broody it\u2019s unbelievable. I miss pregnancy and labour more than having a newborn though. I miss the excitement of scans, first kicks and cravings. I miss taking a billion tests just to make sure that there is a baby there and it isn\u2019t some incredible dream I get to live. One thing I hope for next time round though is a proper bump. You know the one I mean, one where you can actually rest your book or cereal bowl on the top. I had a tiny bump that barely showed.\n\nI still can\u2019t quite stomach the smell of Chinese food even now! *wistful sigh*\n\nAnyway, I know I have Sophie. I know I have what so many women long for. But she didn\u2019t come easy. We lost two before Sophie and what with me being all over the place as a woman she was a little miracle in my eyes. Doesn\u2019t stop me wanting another one though. We won\u2019t find out the gender next time though, we\u2019ll have the surprise of pink or blue. I want Husband to be able to tell me the name of our baby when they arrive!\n\n\n\nMy light x\nMy light x",

        "text":"Sunday, 24 August 2014\n\nWelcome to Harrison Donald Tomecek, born 5.8.14.\n\nSo besides my pre-scheduled design team post it's been a bit quite here on my blog. Regular followers will probably have been able to guess why: I gave birth! Even though my due date was 20.8.14, little Harrison didn't want to wait and was born on 5.8.14.\nMy waters broke around 4pm on 4.8.14 however I was not experiencing any contractions. After calling the hospital and confirming I had likely had my waters brake,\u00a0I drove myself into hospital still partially expecting them to tell me I had wet myself when I got there and have them send me home. :) Instead, they set me up in a birthing suite and said I should settle in for the night. I tried to contact Ben to update him, however the battery on his phone had gone flat so I didn't get a hold of him for another hour. He did sound sufficiently guilty over the phone once I did speak with him.\nAt 8.30pm the on-call OB came to see me as contractions still had not started. We decided to wait overnight to see if things would progress naturally. By 11pm I\u00a0had been having severe back pain for a while and decided to ask the midwife for some pain medication. She performed an examination and discovered I was actually 7cm dilated! Unfortunately, we didn't progress too much further during the course of the rest of the night. My OB saw me around 8am Tuesday morning and determine I was 9cm dilated however baby's head had not descended. He went to perform another induction and returned at 10am. We discovered I was fully dilated however baby hadn't moved and appeared to be stuck on the 'spines'. Dr Bopp advised me of my options, however given Harrison was starting to show signs of distress we chose to proceed with an emergency C-section delivery and he was born at 11.15am (19 hours after my waters broke).\n\u00a0We spent five days in hospital recovering and were hopeful of a smooth transition to home when discharged on 10.8.14. Unfortunately, I developed a serious case of mastitis and was re-admitted to hospital on 11.8.14. We needed to stay in for three nights for the IV antibiotics to kick in and were discharged on 14.8.14.\u00a0We\u00a0then had another flair up\u00a0within 36 hours, which we are currently managing at home with the assistance of our GP. The blood work has indicated the second bout is more\u00a0intense than the first, however luckily it didn't come with the fever the first bout did.\n\u00a0In addition, Harrison does not sleep well during the night resulting in me achieving three hours sleep per night on average since his birth. There is limited opportunity to catch up in this during the day due to the feeling\/expressing schedule we are using to treat the mastitis. Harrison is also struggling with latching during feeding so he has not put on any weight since initially being discharged from hospital. We have another check up tomorrow with a midwife and I have my fingers crossed he will have gained some weight. It will probably continue to be pretty quiet around here until we can get all the health dramas worked out and settle into a new routine.\n\nPhotos of little Harrison from 8.8.14, 11.8.14, 13.8.14 and 24.8.14.\ufeff\n\n\n  1. Sweet photos. Congratulations.\n\n  2. This is the problem with not blogging often or visiting. I miss out on such wonderful news. Congratulations to you all. I hope Harrison has settled into a nice routine for you. :-)\n\n  3. CONGRATULATIONS on the arrival of Harrison Lauren :)\n    Sounds like an extreme roller coaster ride!!!\n    Hoping that you're feeling better soon and that your little man starts to put on weight and settle into a good sleeping \/ feeding routine for you too!!!\n\n\nThanks for commenting, I really appreciate it!",

        "text":"Saturday, June 14, 2014\n\nMaking a Plan\n\n\u00a0I made room in the schedule this morning for some ME TIME to\u00a0enjoy the beautiful morning sitting on the deck surrounded by flowers.\n\u00a0Then it was on to finishing up pillow cases I had\u00a0started yesterday. I am trying to keep a step ahead of the game by getting 4th of July cases done today. Hope this is boyish enough for Elijah :)\n\u00a0The other set are cute dogs all decked out for the 4th. I was so excited to have found both fabrics on the 70% off table at one of the big box stores. With as many cases I am making the sales are a great help on the budget :)\n\u00a0Lots more\u00a0pillow case\u00a0fabric's are waiting to be worked up but they will have to wait...\n\u00a0I HAVE too get the pillow cases dresses for Haiti started and finished this week so I can get them in the mail for the Missionaries. Feeling a bit like a sweat shop around here lately!! 24 dresses at the cost of $2.00 each. I hope to use scraps to fancy them up a little, maybe even use fabric instead of ribbon for the ties\u00a0so they will be more durable.\n\nBreak time!! Need\u00a0to come up with a plan to get the pillowcase dresses done lickety split. I am thinking an applique to the bottom of the dresses might do the trick, possibly a ruffle on the bottom as well? With all that is going on around here there is not time to waste :)\n\nThis afternoon I will be taking Tyler and possibly Elijah to see \"How to Train a Dragon 2\" Elijah is still having a lot of pain from his feeding tube surgery this past week, along with the pain from the cancer in his neck...he is just not up to moving around too much right now :( If he can't join us today we are going to give tomorrow a try. Hopefully an additional day of rest will get him back on his feet :).\n\nOff to shop from home for a few appliques that will add a touch of cuteness to these dresses\n\n\n  1. Debby, I am cheering for you to get everything done and praying for healing for Elijah. I hope he feels up to the movie, an outing like that usually makes kids feel very happy.\n\n  2. Can't wait to see the Pillow Case dresses. Elijah has been on my mind every day from his FB posts shared.\n\n  3. lovely fabric..\n    have a blessed sunday..\n\n  4. Can't wait to see the dresses,Debby. I am so sorry for Elijah. God bless his little heart. It must be so painful to just watch him suffer. Blessed Sunday to you and yours- xo Diana",

        "text":"August 20, 2010\n\nMy dear friends,\n\nSorry for being M.I.A. lately - a combination of summer loving, sheer laziness and un-inspiration (summer is just so blah sometimes) is to blame. What has inspired me is the crisp and clean format that Tumblr has to offer. Ergo, my blog's new platform.\n\nIt would be nice if you came to visit:\n\nSee you soon! x",
