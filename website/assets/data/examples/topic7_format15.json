        "text":"7 May 2007\n\nMagic number\n\nSomehow, I've managed to post 8 times a month for the last 4 months. Its not on purpose, even for my hyper-categorising brain. I wanted to break out of the pattern last month, but didn't manage to.\n\nSo on the whole moving-to-Europe front... Bizzo has started loading the place up with half-filled boxes as he leaves a lot sooner than me. Like, in 2 weeks, sooner. All my RL friends - you should have an email waiting about dates and stuff.\n\nI am very soon going to transfer my mental to-do list into some kind of real action as I think that mad gleam in my eyes is starting to get distressing for clients. It's that gleam you get when you're thinking - \"oh my god I've got to do tax\/bills\/get rid of furniture\/shut the electricity off\/update my cv\/feed myself\/see my Mum\/throw out more stuff\/get on a plane to the otherside of the world\/etc.\" Everyone gets that don't they.. Oh not you? Oh I guess its just me then.\n\nAnyway, last week Astrobarry said \"in short, this is your best year all decade to move beyond your limited conceptions of what outer-world achievements are possible or desirable for you\u2026 \" So I'm just hanging on to that.\n\nMore to come.\n\nNo comments:",

        "text":"Celebrity Look Alike\n\n\nFor years, and I mean at least 25+ years, people have come up to me and say that I look like someone they know.\u00a0 My face is so familiar to them.\u00a0 These people are women around my age that are also a product of sitcom in the 80\u2019s.\u00a0 \u201cExcuse me, Is your name Mindy?\u201d\u00a0 My answer is always no, but I know exactly what they are talking about.\u00a0 People think I look like and\/or am Mindy Cohn or Natalie from The Facts of Life.\u00a0 I do see the resemblance myself and it can be scary that I look more like her than I do my own sister.\u00a0 She was my favorite character on the show as well because I could relate to her and her sense of humor.\n\nHow people approach me is kind of funny. They are never rude and many start off by saying they were put up to it by their girlfriends who had been debating for a while now whether it is Mindy or not.\u00a0 Once I had a guy that knows me by name ask me.\u00a0 His response was that he was put up to asking since he knows me.\u00a0 He thought maybe I changed my name at some point.\n\nYesterday, a woman at the concert in the park approached me because I look so familiar to her.\u00a0 Again, \u201cIs your name Mindy?\u201d\u00a0 The funny part was that she admitted taking over 20 pictures of me and was googling Mindy Cohn on her phone to compare.\u00a0 She then said something like you know that some famous people don\u2019t look as good without make up and they thought maybe I was Mindy without make up.\u00a0 While this is funny.\u00a0 It sucks to be me as I was wearing make up and must still look like crap.\n\nI really need to come up with a better and witty come back for these times.\u00a0 I should also play along and charge people to take a picture with me.\n\nI know she is not a popular celebrity anymore, but I would still love to meet her and get a picture with her.\u00a0 I wonder if she knows she has a look alike out there and it is me.\u00a0\u00a0 What would people say to me if I tell them I am Mindy?\u00a0 How much fun could I have to screw with other people\u2019s minds?\n\n\nGoing to the Beach\u2026Is it worth the\u00a0trip?\n\nI live in Sunny Southern California, North Orange County to be exact and I have always loved going to the beach.\u00a0 Today was 95 degrees at\u00a0 home in my Anaheim Hills backyard that has a pool.\u00a0 I thought it was too hot to stay home and wanted something more than laying in the non-heated pool all day.\u00a0 To be fair, the pool is probably about 70 degrees and the spa can be any temperature I want it to be above that. I knew going to the beach would be a 30 minutes commute and would be 15-20 degrees less.\u00a0 The plus side about the beach is there are no distractions and the beach I go to does not have internet reception either.\n\nAs my family arrived at Corona Del Mar we unpacked our car and headed out to find a spot close to the water.\u00a0 Being that is was such a hot day, everyone and their mother was at the beach.\u00a0 Literally, it is Mother\u2019s Day and we were all there. It was crowded and almost had no personal space between beach towels, seaweed, and other people.\u00a0 But we were at the beach, so how bad can it really be?\n\nThe weather at the beach was overcast yet still warm enough that you had to go in the water to get cooled off.\u00a0 My first thought is why did I leave my backyard to go to the beach and go in the 63 degree water?\u00a0 I think it is so funny that I will not go in my pool at home when the water is less than 80 degrees, but at the beach the water never gets warmer than 68 degrees and I go in.\u00a0 Why do I feel it is less disgusting to go in the ocean to take care of number 1 rather than go use the public restrooms way up across the sand?\u00a0\n\nThree hours of uninterrupted family time and the inability to check Facebook was great.\u00a0 The people watching is wonderful and it is so easy to listen to other\u2019s conversations which I thoroughly enjoy.\u00a0 This time nobody had music playing, so it was us, nature, and 1000+ other beach goers.\u00a0 It is also fun to see what bathing suits people think it is acceptable to wear and how confident they must be with their bodies to wear something so skimpy where their ass is completely hanging out. Who can resist watching the little kids build sand castles and burying themselves in the sand?\u00a0\n\nWhen it is time to go home, it takes 30 minutes to pack up, rinse off all the sand, and get back in the car for the 30 minute ride home.\u00a0 Once you are home, you have to take another shower and put away the beach gear. It seems like a lot of work.\u00a0 The reality is that if I stayed home in the backyard I would have had to clean the backyard and the pool and it is Mother\u2019s Day after all.\u00a0 Going to the beach is just a nice way to do something different and get away from it all.\n\nFor as much work as it is to have a pleasant day out at the beach is it worth it?\u00a0 Do other people not go in their pool water when it is less than 80, yet think nothing of going in the 63 degree ocean water?\u00a0\n\n\nWhen all is said and done, the uninterrupted family time and a chance to get a little color is always worth it to me.\u00a0 A change of scenery and a day out of the norm is a good day out.\n\nYou\u2019re Never Too Old to Make Good\u00a0Friendships\n\nIt is funny how friendships change as we grow older. Growing up and through college I wanted friends that were at similar stages in life like me. I wanted friends that were my age and had little drama. After college came challenging years where I hung on to school friendships and then people start moving away and getting married. After I was married and my children had not entered school yet, my dream was to have friends close by where the husband and wife were still together, had children in the same age range as mine, and where my husband and I liked the other couple and not just the wife. This was a true struggle for a few years, but then the turning point hit when my kids started school.\n\nAs the kids were old enough to be in scouts and start playing sports, we have had the opportunity to make that dream of mine come true. We have met some of the best families through sports and scouts. I have to admit that it is easy to make friends when you have a pool and like hosting social gatherings. One invitation can lead to a lifetime of friendship.\n\nIt is wonderful to make new friends at middle age although I hate to admit we are in that range. At this stage of our lives, the friends we make are not pretentious, but are gracios and truly happy to accept the invitations especially when they don\u2019t have to get a babysitter. It is so ideal when the kids hang out and the parents hang out and all get along. Also, the adults recognize what it takes to have someone over and all offer to bring something. We have had many gatherings where families bring appetizers, drinks, and more than enough side dishes or other food. We also recognize that we are all busy, nothing is perfect and the chance to relax with friends stress-free is golden. Because we are so busy some of the best times have been with last minute invites like one we were invited to at 9:00 am the day of the get together.\n\nWe have made the best friends through cub scouts due to the many family activities involved. Sports friends are easy to make as well by just going out for pizza after the game. The best part of the friends we have is that the invitations are not one way. If you get invited to someone\u2019s home it is great to reciprocate and I think some people don\u2019t get that part. Reciprocation can be in the form of an outing or time at the park, but it does not have to be in your home only.\n\nIt continues to be a wonderful journey in life when you open your home, open your heart, and reach out to new people. You never know when people may move away so you need to continue to make new friends every year. It is work that is well worth the payoff.\n\nThe Girl Scouts could not have said it better than in the first song we learned in scouting:\n\nMake new friends and keep the old,\n\nOne is silver and the other is gold.\n\nWhat new friendships are you working on?\n\nGoing through life with the right\u00a0partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband is a good man, husband, and father.\u00a0 There is no gaurantee in life that when you get married you are making the right choice. Today is my 16th wedding anniversary and I am proud that I made the right choice.\n\nIn addition to marrying Kevin, I married into a wonderful family who shares the same values as me and are just great people to be around. Although Kevin\u2019s family and siblings are at a different stage in life than Kevin and I , they have been so wonderful and have shared great advice and experiences with us.\u00a0 I think they drink more when I am around, but I don\u2019t think it is because of me.\n\nThings\u00a0I\u00a0love about my husband:\n\n  \u2022 He is very laid back\n  \u2022 He is not high maintenance\n  \u2022 He makes a great Cabana Boy and is a master mixologist\n  \u2022 He makes wonderful cocktails for me and always knows the right time that I need one.\u00a0\n  \u2022 He is a great father to our two children\n  \u2022 He is wonderul at playing games with the kids and me\n  \u2022 He knows lots of random trivia\n  \u2022 He will watch my shows with me if I ask even if it is a silly comedy\n  \u2022 He has a good sense of humor and is very sarcastic\n  \u2022 He supports me when I need to get out of the house and get away\n  \u2022 He is a full time partner in chores around the house and taking care of the kids\n  \u2022 He makes stuff up quite frequently that can be funny and annoying at the same time\n  \u2022 He enjoys cooking and trying new recipes with me\n  \u2022 We make great traveling partners and have had the opportunity to see and do quite a bit before having kids.\u00a0 Actually, we have gone on some very nice vacations with the kids too.\n  \u2022 He supports me and my activities and interests in so many ways\n  \u2022 He is active in the kid\u2019s activities and supports their interests\n\nThere are so many things to be thankful for.\u00a0 Today I am thankful for my husband.\n\n\n\nSecret stash of\u00a0______?\n\n\u00a0What is in your secret stash?\u00a0 Is it just me or does everyone have a secret stash of something?\u00a0 What is your something?\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean any illegal substances\n\nI keep a secret stash of cash ...

I always carry a Band Aid in my Wallet and offered to help. Saw his Finger which had some internal injury and small Blood Clot had appeared which would normally be healed with passage of time. But to pacify them, I told them to use a Band Aid and on application they seem to be happy.

None of them did.\n\nOne of them pointing a finger towards a Friend said\u2026.. \u201cIsko Bhej do, iske Papa ki Sarkaari naukri hai, wohi net karte hai\u201d\n\nOther pointing to another said \u201cIska Bhai to bahut net use karta hai\u201d\n\nThe Ones in School Uniform were Bunking School and were afraid that they may get caught.

While he expects us to keep these commandments perfectly, \u00a0He knows we can\u2019t so He sent his son Jesus to die on the cross for us. \u00a0This is the foundation for teaching my kids right from wrong.\n\nA while ago I wrote a post on lying. \u00a0Why do they lie?\u00a0 Why do our kids do the things they do? \u00a0We have many issues with Isaiah. \u00a0As I started this post, I had pause to do a time out with him for stealing his brother\u2019s blue tooth. \u00a0And his chocolate Easter Bunny front he freezer. \u00a0And for food under his bed. \u00a0(it is bed room cleaning day!) \u00a0 Isaiah is five, he entered our family at 3 months. \u00a0So he has been raised by us, same morals and values. \u00a0Same rules. \u00a0I keep teaching him right from wrong.\n\nOne of our foster boys I made up a little reminder sheet for him. \u00a0He had sticky pockets. \u00a0AKA as always taking things with him that were not his. \u00a0He did this a lot from his class room. \u00a0He would take things from other kids backpacks. \u00a0He could walk by something and just take it.\n\nThe reminder sheet simple said:\n\nIs it yours? \u00a0Yes, then you may have it. \u00a0No, leave it be.\n\nI think one of the best ways to teach kids right from wrong is to discuss it daily. \u00a0Talk about why what they did was wrong, not that it was just wrong. \u00a0Keep the communication open. \u00a0Discuss the 10 commandment. \u00a0Martin Luther\u2019s Catechism is great to review the 10 commandments and their meanings. \u00a0There are many great ways to memorize the 10 commandments.\n\n\u00a0teaching kids right from wrongHaving Family Rules also help. \u00a0This gives them guide lines to so they know what is right and what is wrong. \u00a0 We have rules, but they have become unwritten down again. \u00a0Again a May project we are working on to update them. \u00a0 \u00a0I think rules should not be should nots.\n\nYou should not hit. \u00a0Instead say,\n\nIn this family\/house we respect each other. \u00a0Which means we do not hit, kick, bite, smack, pull hair, spit, punch or hurt any one. \u00a0Including the pets.\n\nThis way is also better for new foster kids coming in. Using \u201cIn this family\u201d get past the \u201cwell in my family we do it this way.\u201d \u00a0I simple respond with, in this family we do it this was. \u00a0This also works well with friends who are over visiting. \u00a0Some with use the Lords name in vain. \u00a0We simple say, \u201cIn this family we respect God\u2019s name. \u00a0Please don\u2019t use God\u2019s name in vain.\u201d\n\nPinterest really has some great and cleaver ideas for making family rules. \u00a0I thinks families have embraced family rules beyond the \u201cshould nots\u201d\n\nSave pagePDF pageEmail pagePrint page\n\nMakings of a Strong Family-Shares Responsibilities among its members\n\n6. \u00a0Shares Responsibilities among its members\n\nOh I could go in so many different directions here.\n\nWhen everyone works together things get done. \u00a0Faster. \u00a0 Better. \u00a0Easier.\n\nIs it a women\u2019s job? \u00a0Is it a man\u2019s job?\n\nLet\u2019s just agree some things men do better. \u00a0And other things women do better.\n\nFind the better and do them.\n\nIf the hubby cooks well, then enjoy it! \u00a0If the wife likes fixing things up, wahoo!\n\nIt is about stepping up and taking initiative to know when you need to step up.\n\nMy husband is good at this most days. \u00a0He will do dishes often. \u00a0And he puts the lefts overs away.\n\nBut guys, if your wife is having a tough day, and not feeling good-step up. \u00a0If baby is sticky, don\u2019t walk away like you didn\u2019t smell that. \u00a0Trash over flowing\u2026you get the idea!\n\nAnd gals, our guys work hard. \u00a0Do extra stuff for them when you can.\n\nAll over our house we are lacking this right now- initiative and shared responsibilities. \u00a0Unless mommy is giving out who is cleaning what. \u00a0It is not getting cleaned right now. \u00a0There are something that are getting done. \u00a0But I know this is where I have fallen in terms of good chores and shared responsibilities. \u00a0We have had list before, but then kids come out and in.\n\nAnd when I do ask them to clean some times I get screaming and whining. \u00a0And sometimes they do it with a cheerful heart. \u00a0And sometimes they do it without being asked.\n\nWe are going to work on this. \u00a0I have already a few ides in place for the beginning of summer. \u00a0This will be easier cause AnnieQ will be done with school and it will flow better.\n\nMy Kid Organization board on Pinterest has lots of ideas for chores. \u00a0Check it out!\n\nThis is part of my Making Strong Families Series.\n\nHow do you share responsibilities?\n\n\nSave pagePDF pageEmail pagePrint page\n\nMakings of a Strong Families: has a Sense of Play and Humor\n\n5. \u00a0Has a Sense of Play and Humor\n\nAll can be perfectly quiet, calm and before they know it, momma is doing something silly! \u00a0You got to! \u00a0Kids love that stuff, when moms and dads can be silly! \u00a0Watch the smiles on their faces when parents get down and play with them.\n\nWhen Robby was little he had lots of toys. \u00a0But the thing he loved best was when Dan got on the floor with him and played horse. \u00a0He loved that. \u00a0The smile beamed from his face! \u00a0Sadly many parents don\u2019t take the time to get down and play with their kids. \u00a0We often are tired or busy. \u00a0But kids they want us to play with them. \u00a0They would rather us take a ball and throw it with them than sit and watch TV or computer. \u00a0Kids would rather sit around the table playing a board game or cards on an evening then all this other stuff we have them in.\n\nFamilies have to play. \u00a0Together.\n\n\u00a0I don\u2019t always do a good job on the together part. \u00a0You often hear-go play-so I can get things done!\n\nI remember one time we were outside working on some yard work. \u00a0Before I knew it we had a football game going on. \u00a0The kids ate that up! \u00a0More so cause daddy was the one running the football! \u00a0Kids love parents when they play!\n\nMarriages do better when you can be silly every once and a while. \u00a0Or more. \u00a0Most marriages balance each other one, one a little bit more serious the other a little bit more silly. \u00a0Dan and I balance each other out! \u00a0I have the daily fun down better, he has the big fun down better.\n\nReally as I type this Isaiah walks out with a huge bead necklace, going \u201clook at me\u201d and \u201cshaking his booty!\u201d \u00a0Where\u2019s my camera?

        "text":"Saturday, January 7, 2012\n\nAirport Goodbyes Aren\u2019t Fun\n\nGrand Floridian\n\nAfter spending a few gorgeous days in Disney and then a few freezing days, and then another good day (please don\u2019t ask my why the weather is always crazy for New Year\u2019s when we spend it at Walt Disney World), Husband and I flew home to St. Louis and spent an insane 32 hours of unpacking, laundry, errands and repacking.\n\nAt noon today, my husband boarded a plane for Europe; Paris, to be exact. He is going to be there for at least three months, studying European business law. Saying goodbye at the airport was maybe one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. They let me get a companion pass so I got to sit next to him at the gate while the clock ticked down the minutes we had left together before he jetted off to Europe. And then when they called his row to board? I really kind of lost it. For the second time today.\n\nAs we were leaving the house, he realized he didn\u2019t have his phone. It must have still been plugged in upstairs. He looked and me smiled, and said he guessed he didn\u2019t need it! We didn\u2019t do the international phone package, because we are planning on using Skype to stay in touch. That way, we can actually see each other\u2019s faces when we catch up! But when he said that he didn\u2019t need his phone, it dawned on me that he was going to another continent where I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up the phone and call him, or text him, or get in touch with him instantly as I\u2019m used to doing. He was going to be staying at an apartment with a roommate, an apartment where I don\u2019t know where it is, or anything about his living arrangements. Honestly, it scared the scrap out of me. And I lost it. Literally, it was the biggest ugly cry I had let him see in a looooong while. He put down his bags, enveloped me in his big arms, and told me it was going to be alright.\n\nAnd then he had me get his phone. I\u2019m not sure if he really thought he needed it, or if it was just to calm me down, but it does make me feel better. Long distance charges be damned, if he needs to call me, I sure don\u2019t care about those costs!\n\nIf all goes according to plan, I will see him again in May when he comes home for some family graduations. We are all keeping our fingers crossed about his internship possibilities in Europe, which would keep him there until August. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m hoping that he gets the internship or that he doesn\u2019t, because he would come home earlier if he doesn\u2019t.\n\nHonestly, I just want him to get the education and experience that he needs in Europe and comes back to me as quickly as possible. Because this townhouse is awfully quiet this afternoon with only me here.\n\n\n  1. Paris is lovely in the spring for a visit... Just Sayin'\n\n  2. Oh. You are a stronger woman than I. I can't even imagine. At least you can be certain that 1) absence makes the heart grow fonder, and 2)this is for the greater good. In a down economy, he is going to be so very marketable.",

        "text":"So Halloween is Over; What Now?\n\n\nNow that the trick or treaters are home nursing belly aches after a night of eating the candy their parents approved, and the parents are battling sugar highs from the candy they confiscated from their kids treat bags, what \u2018s the next holiday?\n\nIf you live in Mexico or are Mexican it\u2019s \u201cDia de Muertos\u201d or the Day of the Dead. I know that probably sounds ominous to some people but in reality it is far from that. It\u2019s actually part of a 3-day celebration where friends and family remember loved ones who have passed away. Beginning on October 31st and running through November 2nd it includes a variety of activities including building \u201cofrendas\u201d or private altars and visiting the graves of the dead with gifts of sugar skulls, marigolds, and the foods and drinks the deceased enjoyed in life. This is not as macabre as some might think and certainly no different from many other cultures. The spirits of the deceased are encouraged to visit with the living so that they can hear the prayers offered for them as well as the memories of them shared by the living. These are often humorous tales. dia grave\n\nWhat could be nicer than spending time cleaning around a loved one\u2019s grave, placing colorful flowers (in this case marigolds which are said to draw the dead), and setting up these altars? Some bring toys for children, tequila or mescal for adults, or some special gift for the departed.\n\ndia altar\n\nOther countries also celebrate forms of Dia de Muertes with traditions of their cultures. Some communities have small parades to celebrate the day.dia parade\n\nAll these countries and cultures have one thing in common, a respectful and joyous remembrance of those who have passed on. From Europe, through Latin America, the Philippines, and the United States celebrations to recognize the dead are quite common. Each may have its own distinctive style and traditions but the central purpose is to recognize the place of the dead in the lives of the living.\n\ndia pops\nSo when the candy rush dissipates why not take a moment or two to remember those who went before and tell a sweet story about the time you shared?\n\ndia cookies\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Logo\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text":"Friday, July 23, 2010\n\nBob, our tortoise is currently binging on tomato's in the garden--politely eating a whole entire tomato before moving onto the next tomato....i believe he may like our gardens better than the desert, no tomato's in the old desert......\n\nI have three books ordered---in Non Fiction two----one on the history of the1930's dust bowl of the Mid-west. Looking for survival information in that one...... another non-fiction on the strategic projections for Climate change---for example climate wars for water, food etc....and a science fiction anthology on future Metropolis's-----i'll give better details as they come in and are read...........\nNow streaming season 2 of the Sarah Conner Chronicles---- Ah! to be a 16 year old John Conner with my own hot terminator body guard who loves the universal balance of things-------the cost of being pursued by the nasty terminators would be so worth it.........\nNo working Rovio yet, still awaiting the promised replacement parts from the company----does this bother me---yes---can i do anything about it---no.\n\nI have 600 some odd days until I could retire and I may not go then based on the economy but i have already felt the effects of being retirement almost capable.\n\nI spoke with my boss last month and advised him that i was never cutting my hair again and did this bother him or the organization? He said no.....the truth or lie of the response doesn't matter to me on this issue. I'll be growing my hair into a tail for the remainder of my two years. There is no more need for me to impress--i have traveled as far down the work road as i am going to go success wise and it has been further than I ever believed possible.\nThe signs and symbols that were once necessary for me are not so any longer.\nI have (or am) stopping the purchasing of any type of work related clothing such as the dreaded necktie, sport coats, dress shirts etc. Why purchase any of this stuff if it will never be used ever again except in the casket and one outfit regardless of fit is enough.\nSo my new daily work outfit consists of black, EMT, 9 pocket pants, terra planna, worn again sneakers or boots and usually an expensive casual shirt as my daily business attire. I keep the dreaded sign of slavery---- the necktie off me as much as possible during the workday and although this is a demanded physical display to the rest of the Baboon troop for status indication. I bring one but it has been spending its time on sitting in the glove box of the Prius. Worn only for the dreaded meetings we all suffer through.\nIf by some chance I am caught tie-less I have created and committed to memory multiple excuses as to why I am not wearing one---to prevent howling attacks and shit throwing, by higher ranked baboons over my failure to comply to troop rules.It is that I can simply no longer accept demands from the work place as to how i look. I cannot be owned any longer and our most important display of independence, how we appear, has become important to me now for serious reasons. I will own myself.\nIt was actually special to go in and basically advise that I done with all this stupid valueless shit that's somehow made itself REQUIRED? So about the site i go developing what i call the new Geezer Tactical leave me the fuck alone look.....\n\nWell aren't we special eh?\nI've been feeling pretty positive about the only self for the past couple of days. I feel as if i have my daily equipment and essentials planned, obtained, and available like never before in a smaller, more positive and effective state of operation. I am reading, writing, computing, creating, and moving through life in a good state. Home is clean, organized, and a pleasure to live in and about right now.\nI for the most part feel in control in some way for a change----to the point where i think i may not collapse and die from stress like the lowest ranking baboon in the troop.\nI still stagger about engaged in projects of my own making. I obtained all the parts and supplies necessary today to rehabilitate a beat cruiser-style bicycle given to us. A project of art, mechanics, expense, and a public response when completed of \"why did you do this again?\" My required fundamentals in anything i approach, much like Doc Brown in back to the future.\nMy success's have pleased me and my failures have not discouraged me over the past few days and that is a very good sign. But as always no one expects the Spanish Inquisition.\nThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\n\n\nDavid Scott said...\n\nYour comments approaching reteriment is spot on.\nAs I approached my magic day eight months ago I became less tolerant of the beaucratic bull shit (BBS) to the point I once told a engineer that what he wanted done was the stupidest thing I ever heard and if he wanted it done do it himself.\n\nWarren said...\n\nthanks David\nyou are absolutely correct. The closer to retirement i get the more I become an Honest Oracle.\nthanks for the comment",

        "text":"Thursday, May 20, 2010\n\nCalm before the storm.\n\nDylan's first swing experience!\n\nMemphis, TN...visiting with cousin Truman (Kaitlyn douses herself with the water and Truman watches with great intrigue-Special K did change his routine up quite a bit during our visit)!\n\nTandem bathing!\n\nAuntie Cupcake with Chillin Dylan!\n\nShe's magical in my eyes even when she's up to no good. He melts my heart with each smile. Between the two of them, I'm often lost in another reality. My two blessings are nothing less than sunshine in my day, chocolate in my afternoon, and love in my heart. If I could write daily about the adventures of 24\/7 diaper marathons, tandem bathing, duel body juggling acts, and the helicopter parenting that I seem to fall into more often than I want to admit, I would! There is more content than I wish to recognize-everything is a story worth sharing that I find my inner thoughts in conflict over how to prioritize my a blog entry to document the latest happening or carry on to bed for a brief respite between brewing unnatural sleep cycles. The latter generally wins hence another entry that is way late, hugely anticipated and thus, like Swiss Cheese, missing chunks!\nWhat feels like months ago was probably only six weeks ago; I woke up to solid poop in Dylan's diaper. MILESTONE. How has this already happened? He was just 3 months old and now I face his seventh month; the homemade baby food cubes are taking over the freezer, his birthweight has almost doubled and nursing habits are long ingrained within him that I fear my breasts will be forever harnessed in a nursing bra. While he can and will roll over, it is generally out of circumstance, a means to an end. He does not like being awake and lying on his tummy which leads me to believe he will bypass crawling and dive straight into climbing, standing and walking. Two teeth and swollen gums, his canines are proportionate to his hands and feet...all are large! He remains 'Chillin Dylan' unless the volcanic eruption begins and then it's hunt for Dylan already shows signs of resilience and superior endurance. Heck I might too if I was getting daily hits to the head by books and blocks with an occasional foot. Yes, Kaitlyn expresses her love for her brother with great force and often with a repetitive edge. Needless to say Dylan continues to chill and handle her strikes with a stoic immortality.\nThis brings me to dear Special K. Kaitlyn has an uncanny ability to comprehend exactly what you are telling her, look right through you like she isn't listening and then after all verbal threats and reprimands, galavant off and successfully complete the request. It drives me nuts. She is a 13 year old in the body of a 2 year old...well, ok, maybe not that extreme, but she is truly already showing remarkable acts of defiance.\nI'm not much of a reader and much to my husband's disdain, I'm not a pop culture hound, however, I do know that Special K has a keen sense of self and an intrinsic motivation for certain activities. My latest headline with her is PRESCHOOL. Where will she go, for how often each week, will she be the class bully or the class clown? Whatever the case, I'm really eager for this MILESTONE. She couldn't be more ready for engagement that is with someone other than her strung out, overly sensitive, hyper-hawk eyed mom...I'm sure I am making it out to be worse than it, I said it before, my children are my blessings-nothing less than sunshine in my day, chocolate in my afternoon, and love in my heart!",
