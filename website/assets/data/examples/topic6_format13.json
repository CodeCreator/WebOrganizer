        "text":"Subscribe to RSS\n\nMasterworks program music reflects the year at Bethel College\n\n1200px 650px\n\nNORTH NEWTON, KAN. \u2013 The annual Masterworks program, a May tradition at Bethel College, will be a bit different this year.\n\nThe Masterworks concert is Sunday, May 6, at 3 p.m. in Memorial Hall on the Bethel campus (note time change from some previously printed material, made to accommodate the USD 373 All-District Band concert in Athletic Park that evening).\n\nThe Masterworks music this year is for wind ensemble rather than orchestra, and written by two contemporary composers \u2013 one of whom will be present for the Bethel performance of his work.\n\nThe first half of the program will be Symphony No. 1 \u2018Blue\u2019 (1999) by James Syler, for wind ensemble, chorus and soprano solo, with Bethel\u2019s instructor of voice, Soyoun Chun, featured as the soloist. The second half will be David Maslanka\u2019s popular Symphony No. 4 (1992), written for a large wind ensemble.\n\nThe Bethel College Wind Ensemble will form the core of the instrumental group, with the addition of 22 guest musicians, many of them professionals.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t usually think of wind ensembles playing symphonic literature,\u201d says Timothy Shade, a member of Bethel\u2019s music faculty who directs the Bethel College Wind Ensemble and was in charge of organizing this year\u2019s Masterworks program. \u201cYou think of a band, playing marches and things like that, but the [symphonic] literature is out there. It\u2019s a personal charge of mine to spread that word.\u201d\n\nFor the last number of years, Bethel\u2019s Masterworks programs have featured the Newton Mid-Kansas Symphony Orchestra and the Bethel Oratorio Chorus, which comprises all Bethel vocal groups and the Newton Community Chorus. William Eash, Bethel professor of music, has chosen the music and directed the combined choirs and orchestra.\n\nThis year, however, Eash accepted an invitation for the Bethel College Concert Choir to sing with the Wichita Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the Beethoven Mass in C Major, April 14-15. Eash knew, Shade says, that preparing for that event, plus the spring tour in March, would make it hard for him to also organize the Masterworks concert.\n\n\u201cI was not very far in the door at Bethel College,\u201d says Shade, who began teaching at the college in 2008, \u201cwhen I heard the Concert Choir, and said to Bill, \u2018We have to do the Syler.\u2019 So as soon as he asked if I would like to do the Masterworks this year, I knew that would be one of the pieces.\u201d\n\nA last-minute, special addition is that the composer will be present for the Bethel performance. Shade knows James Syler and David Maslanka and has been in e-mail communication with both of them as he\u2019s been preparing the Masterworks program.\n\n\u201cOut of the blue, [Syler] called,\u201d Shade says. \u201cHe asked how things were going, and he was very excited to learn about the size of the chorus. Then he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if you have the budget for this, but I would really like to come.\u2019\n\n\u201cI still remember the experience, as an undergraduate, of meeting a composer,\u201d Shade continues. So Bethel is flying Syler from his home in San Antonio, in time for him to meet and talk with the students before the May 6 concert.\n\nBecause Syler\u2019s Symphony No. 1 is \u201cnot what you\u2019d call a \u2018happy\u2019 piece,\u201d Shade says, he was looking for something a bit more upbeat for the second half. Maslanka\u2019s well-known Symphony No. 4 seemed an obvious choice.\n\n\u201cMaslanka is very popular among contemporary wind ensembles,\u201d Shade says. \u201cHe\u2019s our Mahler. He\u2019s written nine symphonies, and he writes with such scope and broad form.\u201d So Shade went with Symphony No. 4, even though it is \u201cthe hardest material [my Wind Ensemble has] ever seen.\u201d\n\nShade didn\u2019t think of it as he was initially planning the Masterworks program, he says, but the combination of the two pieces reflects this year at Bethel College.\n\nIn the program notes for Symphony No. 1, Syler says, \u201cFor many years, I have wanted to write a large work that would combine my musical and literary interests. So much of 20th-century fiction presents despairing characters who find their resolution in some form of self-destruction. In writing the text for this work, I wanted to create a narrative that would resolve despair in a different way. This free-verse lyrical narrative, titled \u2018Blue,\u2019 is in a broadest sense about the loss of love and the process of reconnecting with love.\u201d\n\nMaslanka says of his work: \u201cThe roots of Symphony No. 4 are many. The central driving force is the spontaneous rise of the impulse to shout for the joy of life. Out of this, the hymn tune \u2018Old Hundred\u2019 [\u2018Doxology\u2019], other hymn tunes (the Bach chorales \u2018Only Trust in God to Guide You\u2019 and \u2018Christ Who Makes Us Holy\u2019) and original melodies that are hymn-like in nature form the backbone of Symphony No. 4.\n\n\u201cI have used Christian symbols because they are my cultural heritage, but I have tried to move through them to a depth of universal humanness, to an awareness that is not defined by religious label. My impulse through this music is to speak to the fundamental human issues of transformation and rebirth in this chaotic time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made sense, given the year we\u2019ve had,\u201d Shade says, \u201cstarting out losing [Seth Dunn, a student killed in a skateboarding accident], someone so young and vibrant and full of life. His death hit many of the music students hard. The shape of the concert is something like: With Syler, going down; feeling lost; then a beginning of the way out; followed by a return to the light with Maslanka.\u201d\n\nShade says it\u2019s similar to what Eash did with the Concert Choir, who for their spring tour program sang Eric Whitacre\u2019s long lament, \u201cWhen David Heard,\u201d followed by \u201cLight of a Clear Blue Morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Doxology\u2019 has such a powerful resonance for this community,\u201d Shade says, referring to the Maslanka symphony. \u201cI thought, \u2018We have to go there.\u2019 I think we\u2019ll all be changed by this.\u201d\n\nHis Wind Ensemble players have been \u201cworking their tails off,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought we couldn\u2019t get much bigger than our KMEA performance [last February]. We got a lot of acclaim \u2013 people are still talking to me about it. But they\u2019re up for this challenge.\n\n\u201cConcerts like this don\u2019t come around often,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the students and the community to experience literature of this breadth.\u201d\n\nVocalists for the Masterworks program are, in addition to Chun as soloist, members of the Bethel College Concert Choir, Men\u2019s Ensemble and Women\u2019s Chorus and the Newton Community Chorus.\n\nInstrumentalists are Bethel College\u2019s 67-piece Wind Ensemble with the following guest musicians: Amy Hoffman, piccolo; Jennifer Kirk and Kristen Shaffer, flute; Cindy Thompson, oboe; Gabrielle Baffoni-Shade, E-flat clarinet; Jill Gatz, James Pisano and Kristen Pisano, clarinets; Mary Rose Biltz, contrabass clarinet; Zach Hague and Heather Garrison, bassoons; Vanessa Davies, contrabassoon; Richard Benson and Melissa LeBlanc, French horns; Benjamin Fairfield, principal trumpet and piccolo trumpet; Levi Morris, trumpet; Matt Blauer and Mark Robinson, trombones; Richard Evans, tuba; Karen Bauman Schlabaugh, piano; Rosanne Penner Kaufman, organ; and Faith O\u2019Neal, harp.\n\nTickets for the Masterworks concert are available at Thresher Bookstore in Schultz Student Center on the Bethel College campus during regular business hours, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Mon.-Fri., phone 316-284-5205, or at the door. All seats are general admission.\n\nBethel College is the only private, liberal arts college in Kansas listed in the 2011-12 analysis of top colleges and universities in the United States and is the highest-ranked Kansas college in the Washington Monthly annual college guide for 2011-12. The four-year liberal arts college is affiliated with Mennonite Church USA. For more information, see\n\nBack to News",

As both a pianist and composer, she was a font of daring and creativity who helped shape the sound of 20th-century America. And like the dynamic, turbulent nation in which she lived, Williams seemed to redefine herself with every passing decade.\n\nFrom child prodigy to \u201cBoogie-Woogie Queen\u201d to groundbreaking composer to mentoring some of the greatest musicians of all time, Mary Lou Williams never ceased to astound those who heard her play. But away from the piano, Williams was a woman in a man\u2019s world, a black person in a whites-only society, an ambitious artist who dared to be different, and who struggled against the imperatives of being a star. Above all, she did not fit the (still) prevailing notions of where genius comes from or what it looks like.\n\nTime and again, she pushed back against a world that said, \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d and said, \u201cI can.\u201d It nearly cost her everything.",

Hugely talented Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg \u2013 born in 1919 in Warsaw into a Jewish family of musicians \u2013 begins to compose his first songs and pieces for piano as a self-taught adolescent. At the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, 19-year-old Mieczys\u0142aw escapes eastward on foot, in the company of his sister. Exhausted, Ester, two years younger than her brother, returns to her parents after just a few kilometres. Mieczys\u0142aw will never see her or their parents again. First, Weinberg studies composition in Minsk; when the German troops begin to enter the Soviet Union, he is evacuated from here to Tashkent, 4,000 kilometres away. In 1943, Shostakovich brings him to Moscow, where Weinberg spends the rest of his life as a freelance composer. Accused of being a partisan of a potential Jewish republic in the Crimea, he is arrested in 1953. His lifelong friend and mentor Dmitri Shostakovich pleads his cause in a very courageous letter. Weinberg is only released after Stalin\u2019s death.\nIn the 1960s, he finally learns with absolute certainty that his entire family was murdered by the Nazis. \u226bI regard it as my moral duty to write about the war, about the horrors that have befallen humanity in our century.\u226a\nMieczys\u0142aw Weinberg leaves an impressive musical oeuvre: more than 20 symphonies, concerts and chamber music, song cycles and operas. He also composes scores for films seen by millions of spectators. \u201cSad and free\u201d, in the words of fellow composer Sofia Gubaidulina, \u226bis how this music strikes the listener.\u226a\nOn an invitation by Wiener Festwochen, Gidon Kremer together with his Kremerata Baltica and soloists will present a portrait of Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg and his spiritual kinship with Dmitri Shostakovich. This series of concerts is complemented by a discussion round and a screening of the film\u00a0The Cranes Are Flying.\n\nMore about the festival here.\n\n\nXII Kremerata Baltica Festival \u201cHomage to Mieczyslaw Weinberg\u201d\n\n\n\n5.06 \u2013 8.06. 2015, C\u0113sis, Sigulda, R\u012bga\n\n\nAlready for the 12th time Kremerata Baltica Festival\u00a0approaches along\u00a0with the summer.\u00a0In 2015 the festival\u00a0is dedicated to works of\u00a0Polish-Jewish composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg, who seemingly\u00a0gained\u00a0too little recognition among the world\u2019s musicians and interpreters until now.\n\nHis contribution to the world of music can be measured with\u00a022 symphonies, 17 string quartets, 8 sonatas for violin and many other pieces, among which we can find\u00a0music for 40 movies\u00a0of 20th century. However, the quantity doesn\u2019t matter as much as does the specific spirit and colors of his works. Sometimes the seemingly dark character of his music is in the\u00a0background of purposeful desire to find peace and harmony, even catharsis. This desire for\u00a0harmony is embodied throughout his musical style, often\u00a0characterized with \u201cneo-classical, rationalist clarity and proportion\u201d (L. Nikitina).\n\nAlthough Kremerata Baltica and Gidon Kremer have\u00a0included pieces by Mieczyslaw Weinberg in their repertoire already before, more attention to the\u00a0composer was created\u00a0by the album\u00a0\u201cMieczyslaw Weinberg\u201d (2014) and its several subsequent concert tours around the world\u00a0by Gidon Kremer and Kremerata Baltica. Nevertheless, to praise the composer and introduce a wider part of the society to his works, this year\u2019s Kremerata Baltica Festival is dedicated exactly to him.\n\nArtists taking part in the festival:\nMirga Gra\u017einyt\u0117-Tyla (conductor),\u00a0Andrius \u017dlabys (piano), Yulianna Avdeeva (piano), Mate Bekavac (clarinet), Tine Thing Helseth (trumpet), Olesya Petrova (mezzo-soprano), Alexei Mochalov (bass),\u00a0Giedr\u0117 Dirvanauskait\u0117 (cello), Madara P\u0113tersone (violin), Agata Dara\u0161kait\u0117 (violin), Santa Vi\u017eine (viola), P\u0113teris Sokolovskis (cello), \u00a0Iurii Gavryliuk (double bass), Andrei Pushkarev (vibraphone).\n\nProgram: Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg, Dmitri Schostakovich, Modest Mussorgsky, Valentin Silvestrov, Igor Loboda.\n\nMore detailed information about particular concerts of the festival can be found under\u00a0the events section.\n\nTickets on sale at\u00a0www.bilesuparadize.lv",

        "text":"\n\nSign up for our mailing list\n\n\nWednesday, June 12th, 2013\n\n\nAnti- is thrilled to announce the signing of Saintseneca, a young band from Columbus, Ohio led by singer-songwriter and multi instrumentalist Zac Little. The group utilizes a wide range of instrumentation (violin, mandolin, dulcimer, Turkish Baglama, floor percussion) with the more contemporary elements such as synthesizers and electric guitars to create a unique merging of rustic and modern. Folk and country motifs converge seamlessly with soaring vocals and a vibrant post-punk energy.\n\nWhile the group formed in Columbus Ohio, a majority of Saintseneca's members, including songwriter Little, hail from the rural hills of Appalachia. It is a landscape that has infused the group's expansive and evocative music with a deep sense of introspection. \"I was raised on farms in Appalachia, \"Little explains, \"And I think that my perspective on music was shaped by where I grew up. Being so isolated played a huge role in my music and in the subjects I write about.\"\n\nThe band's poetic lyricism and folk instrumentation is powerfully enhanced by elements of pop, post-punk and psychedelia. It is a memorable and moving sound which originally evolved playing alongside electrified punk bands at DIY house shows. \"Playing those shows made us want to draw the most sound and volume from the instruments we were using,\" Little explains.\n\nCheck out Saintseneca on Live From Bad Racket, a video series featuring artists performing at the Cleveland based recording studio:\n\nSaintseneca will be performing a series of North American dates.\n\nLive Dates: 6\/17 Cleveland, OH @ Beachland Tavern 6\/20 Philadelphia, PA @ Moonbase Nix 6\/21 Boston, MA @ Lily's Pad 6\/22 New Haven, CT @ The Space 6\/23 Brooklyn, NY @ Hillstock Music Fest 6\/24 Brooklyn, NY @ Death By Audio 6\/25 Doylestown, PA @ Siren Records 6\/26 Willimantic, CT @ Shitty Present HQ 6\/27 Washington, DC @ The Dollhouse 6\/28 Norfolk, VA @ The Iguana 6\/29 Pittsburgh, PA @ Mr. Roboto Project",

The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra is conducted by Diego Matheuz, one of the most exciting young conductors to emerge from the 'El Sistema' classical music training scheme in Venezuela. Enrico Chapela will be attending the performance and participating in a pre-concert talk at 6.15 pm in conversation with Simon Webb.\n\nMAGNETAR was written for the virtuosic skills of Johannes Moser and premiered by him in Los Angeles in 2011 with the LA Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel. The 25-minute concerto has since been performed by Moser in Brazil with the S\u00e3o Paulo Symphony Orchestra and Marin Alsop. Plans are underway for further performances at festivals this summer and on an Iberian tour with the Orquestra Sinf\u00f3nica do Porto Casa da M\u00fasica this autumn. The concerto was jointly commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Orquestra Sinf\u00f3nica do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n> Watch a video introduction to MAGNETAR\n\nThe title MAGNETAR relates to neutron stars which are the universe's most powerful magnets. This focus falls in line with other recent science-related compositions by Chapela, including Nanobots (2010) based on microscopic machines, and Private Alleles (2010) which takes inspiration from the Mexican Genome Diversity Project. As the electric cello produces sound via electromagnetism, Chapela decided to base his concerto on data from magnetars, translated into pitch sets. The electric cello part combines sounds from an effects patcher, including delay, granulation, and spectral freeze, to create its otherworldly soundscape.\n\nWhile the opening movement features a cadenza that represents for the composer a magnetar's \"quiet and peaceful times\" and the second movement \"falls into a cool jam\", the third movement, entitled Brutal \"bursts from nowhere into a fully distorted e-cello that leads into a violent riff, that gradually builds up to the giant final flare\".\n\nEnrico Chapela, born in Mexico City in 1974, studied guitar performance and composition at the CIEM academy in Mexico City, and electro-acoustic music and musicology at the University of Paris Saint-Denis. He has been commissioned to compose music for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Dresdner Sinfoniker, Carnegie Hall, Seattle Symphony, Britten Sinfonia, Wigmore Hall, and the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing. His musical style seeks to fuse different geographic traditions and musical soundworlds, so that contemporary techniques can happily coexist with minimalist, jazz or rock idioms. Orchestal works include \u00ednguesu, a musical recreation of a historic football match betweeen Mexico and Brazil, which has\u00a0been performed\u00a0widely including in Mexico, USA, Brazil, Germany, Poland and South Korea.\n\n> CBSO website\n> View MAGNETAR on our Online Scores website\n> Visit Chapela's website\n\n>\u00a0Weitere Informationen zum Werk: MAGNETAR\n\nPhoto: Johannes Moser, soloist in Chapela's MAGNETAR (Uwe Arens)\n\n>\u00a0Nachrichtensuche\n\n\nMelden Sie sich an\u00a0f\u00fcr Updates & Angebote per Mail\n\n\nOrchester- und B\u00fchnenwerke\n\nOnline Ansicht\n\nBl\u00e4ttern Sie online in \u00fcber 1000 Partituren!\n\nFAQ | Kontakt\/Impressum | Links | \u00dcber Uns | Shopverzeichnis | Stellen | AGB | RSS Index",

And yet it can also imply a performance that registers \u2013 and even comes to represent \u2013 a particular cultural moment. But what exactly makes a performance \u201ciconic\u201d? The star? Acting style? Writing? Story? Some combination of these? With its etymological traces of idol worship, the word iconic tells us something about our veneration of stars and our desire to see them perform in extraordinary ways. Studying performance also reinforces the powerful function of fictional characters to illuminate truths that might otherwise remain obscure in the more mundane scenes of our everyday lives.\n\nJoin us every other Tuesday evening this spring in FFB-11, where we\u2019ll watch six iconic performances and consider what makes them both inimitable and enduring.\n\nAll screenings will begin at 17.45.
