        "text":"Select Page\n\nBroad rights granted in license\n\nOne of the big buzzes in the genealogical community right now is the ability to create multimedia stories of our families on various websites.\n\nJust add a few facts \u2014 names, dates, places \u2014 upload some family photos and documents, and voila! A polished finished product gets produced as if by magic, with music and timelines of events and more.\n\nWDYTYAOne of these services is the Who Do You Think You Are? Story website from DC Thomson Family History Limited, the parent company of findmypast (both the US and UK varieties).\n\nIt\u2019s a beta product at the moment, and it was being featured at last week\u2019s 2014 Federation of Genealogical Societies conference in San Antonio.\n\nAnd because the whole function of the website is to get us to share our information, we always always always have to take a very careful look at the website\u2019s terms of use.\n\nTerms of use, remember, are \u201cthe limits somebody who owns something you want to see or copy or use puts on whether or not he\u2019ll let you see or copy or use it.\u201d1 And when it comes to a site where sharing is involved, terms of use are also those pesky little sometimes-written-in-legal-jargon provisions saying what the website can do with anything you choose to upload.\n\nFor the most part, Who Do You Think You Are? Story\u2019s terms of use are perfectly ordinary and, to the company\u2019s credit, written in plain English.2 But there are a couple of provisions that every potential user should read carefully, and stop and think about, before uploading a single item or sharing a single fact on the site.\n\nThe big one affects anything you choose to upload to the site, and the criticial language is highlighted in bold:\n\nYou keep the copyright in any content that you create or publish on the website, but by publishing it you give us permission (a non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide licence) to use it (including editing, adapting or modifying it as we wish) for any purpose and in any media now known or invented in the future.\n\nPlease be aware that we may not credit you as the author of the material.3\n\nIn plain English, by using the website and uploading anything \u2014 a photo, a story, any comments you share about an ancestor or about your research \u2014 you are giving the parent company, DC Thomson Family History Limited, an unlimited right to use what you\u2019ve uploaded. It\u2019s a license, meaning you do keep your own copyright in your own work, but it\u2019s a license that allows DC Thomson Family History Limited to do just about everything that, ordinarily, copyright law says only the creator of the work can do: copy it, display it, create derivative works from it, and modify it.\n\nIf you choose to upload something and create your story online, you must understand that you are agreeing to allow it to be used, edited, adapted, changed, and modified for any purpose the company chooses at any time the company chooses. It could use your story for advertising, if it wished, without paying you, and it wouldn\u2019t even have to give you credit for it.\n\nAnd it can change the work \u2014 the story \u2014 you\u2019ve created. That\u2019s what you\u2019re giving the company with the \u201cediting, adapting or modifying it as we wish\u201d language.\n\nYour grant of permission is perpetual \u2014 meaning forever \u2014 and it\u2019s unrestricted. You can\u2019t come back later and say you didn\u2019t mean it; there\u2019s no mechanism in place to have any content removed from the service unless it\u2019s found to violate someone else\u2019s copyright or is offensive or defamatory.\n\nThe company has the right, under this grant of permission, to sell the entire operation, lock stock and barrel, to some other company down the road (that\u2019s the transferable part), or to allow another company to use the content (that\u2019s the sub-licensable part).\n\nYou also need to understand that your work can be viewed and, potentially, used by everyone else who uses the website for their own personal noncommercial research.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about this: there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong about what Who Do You Think You Are? Story is doing; it\u2019s not hiding a thing. It\u2019s a commercial venture that\u2019s trading you a place and a method to share your materials and in return you give the company the rights to your materials. If that doesn\u2019t sit well with you \u2014 if you have qualms about it \u2014 don\u2019t use one of these story-creation sites. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nAnd, by the way, because you\u2019re the one granting the license, if you do choose to upload, make sure you only upload things you have the right to share. The terms of use make you responsible and require that you do not \u201cshare the personal details of any living person without their permission\u201d or \u201cpublish something that you do not own the copyright in (or have permission to publish it from the owner).\u201d4\n\nIf there\u2019s a dispute down the road, the case is going to be decided a long way from your home: \u201cThese Terms are made under English law, and any arguments about them will only be heard in English courts.\u201d5\n\nBeyond the sharing issues, another stop-and-think provision is the requirement that anyone using the site for commercial purposes get consent:\n\nUsing site content for commercial purposes: You must contact us for consent if you want to reproduce or share any of the content on the site (including images) for commercial purposes. This includes commercial publishing or sharing in any media format now known, or invented in the future. You\u2019re free to use and share the content on the site for non-commercial use\u20266\n\nThe problem is that there\u2019s no definition of commercial purposes on the website. Could a genealogy professional create one of these stories for a client? Use a screen capture for a blog post? Use a short clip in a genealogy lecture? Are you a commercial user if your blog has Google Adwords or a FlipPal link? It isn\u2019t clear.\n\nBottom line: share with care. If you create one of these stories, you\u2019ve given up control over it \u2014 completely and forever.\n\n\n  1. Judy G.
