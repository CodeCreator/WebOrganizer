        "text":"Sunday, January 4, 2015\n\nTeddy's prediction for 2015\n\nGiven current polls, and my expectations for the BQ and F&D, these are my current predictions for 2015.\n\n\n  1. You honestly think FetD is going to do that well? I'd be surprised if Fortin could win his seat, but 8?\n\n    1. You are looking at it backwards. I think the BQ will do that poorly. Those voters have to go somewhere.\n\n    2. Yeah, I think they'll just not vote, or go NDP.\n\n    3. I don't think the FD would do that well either. Most Quebecers do not know about this new party and the structure of this party is weak too.\n\n      Will they be able to participate in a debate? Would this set a precedent for rouge MPs to create new parties so their voices get access in debates in the future?\n\n      Best case scenario for that party is that their two incumbent MPs get re-elected with small margins due to vote splitting.\n\n      Personally, I'm predicting the BQ and FD will be wiped out this year.\n\n    4. History suggests FeD will be allowed into the debates.\n\n  2. I find your prediction highly unlikely 13 Liberal seats in Metro Vancouver is simply ludicrous, the Greens picking up Victoria (which requires a 30% NDP-->Green swing) is equally unlikely as are 11 Liberal seats on the Prairies.\n\n    If Justin can only manage 154 seats with a highly inventive prediction then, the Liberals must be in real trouble. 2015 the year the Liberal party died?\n\n    1. 13 seats in Metro Vancouver is far from improbable...\n\n    2. Before I forget, Fraser, but you do realise the NDP nearly lost Victoria to the Greens in 2012, right?\n\n  3. 13 seats in Metro for the Grits is on the verge of the apoplectic. In a number of the Fraser Valley ridings coloured red a swing of 10-15,000 votes is required. 13 seats for the Liberals in Metro Vancouver is improbable (especially considering today's poll by Ipsos) I would even say it is a ridiculous prediction meant to shock as opposed to reflect an accurate estimate. It's your blog and you are welcome to be as ridiculous as you see fit but, don't get mad at others for pointing out the obvious.\n\n    1. Based on the Liberals results in the Metro Van area in 2006, I can get to over 13 seats easily with the new boundaries, 10 sure bets and 5 extremely plausible ones. Look:\n\n      Seats that would have been won:\n      1. Van Centre\n      2. Van Kingsway\n      3. Van Quadra\n      4. Van South\n      5. Van Granville\n      6. North Van\n      7. West Van\n      8. Surrey-Newton\n      9. Richmond Centre\n\n      Plausible\/near-miss seats:\n      10. Steveston-Richmond East\n      11. Delta\n      12. Burnaby North-Seymour\n      13. Burnaby South\n      14. Fleetwood-Port Kells\n\n      That doesn't count ones like Port Moody-Coquitlam or Cloverdale that are more on the line. So what are you on about friend?\n\n    2. 9* sure bets and 5 plauisbles. Poor literacy hurts everyone.\n\n    3. This isn't to say that I believe the Liberals will get 13 seats in Metro Van, just that its not improbable; Martin did it on less than 30% support in BC in a year that he lost, why would it be impossible for Trudeau to do it when most polls give him between 30-35% support in the province and a very good shot at winning an election?\n\n      I would also like to know what you were saying in 2011 about the NDP being able to sweep Quebec. Were you like me, and saying it was not just improbable but apocalyptic? I literally have posts saying \"The NDP Apocalypse!\" You discount things at your own peril, friend.\n\n    4. Sure bets?\n\n      The NDP will win Kingsway, The Liberal name is mud because Emerson demonstrated Liberal loyalty to Kingsway's constituents The Tiories always win West Van, The Burnabys have a better chance of going NDP than Liberal. Hedy Fry could easily lose Vancouver Centre. I notice you didn't include Surrey Centre in your prediction but, it is coloured red on the map.\n\n      It is not impossible for the Liberals to win 13 seats in Metro Vancouver but, it is very improbable they will do so especially with their falling poll numbers of late. Harper is on pace for a second majority-the only people unawaare are LIberals. Justin is leading the party to its destruction.\n\n      No in 2011 I fully expected the NDP to gain dozens of seats in Quebec, my only question was why it had taken that party's socialist mentality to resonate among a people fond of socialism? Jack Layton spent 3 campaign and 7 years building a narrative before 2011. Justin Trudeau doesn't have a narrative, doesn't have any policies and doesn't look like he has a plan. The narrative Trudeau and the Liberals portray is Harper's narrative. If Liberals think the good hard working people of Burnaby or Surrey or New Westminster will vote for some rich kid drama teacher from Westmount who can't be bothered to release public policy or cobble together a plan for government-they are in for a very large shock.",

        "text":"Saturday, April 13, 2013\n\n\"I Flee and Moan, Therefore I am . . .\"\n\nLike Nixon, not Woodward\nA short blog of no real consequence, a rebound as it were.\n\nBlogger:\u00a0(noun) one who flees to his personal writing space and moans to the best of his ability.\n\nMoan: (verb)\u00a0to\u00a0point out the flaws in others.\n\nInformation is where you find it.\n  \u2022 FOI is a legal initiative to drag information reluctantly from government, for government has a natural drive toward secrecy. It is best done through legislation that mandates accessibility to all but the most sensitive of government information.\n  \u2022 Spying is the risky business of stealing information from another nation to help defend one's own nation. It is generally illegal and is carried out secretly for purposes deemed important and righteous. Spies are often executed.\n  \u2022 Investigative journalism starts with an issue and probes sometimes hidden or undiscovered information to shed light on the issue. It is journalism with a purpose deeper than reporting on everyday events. Investigative journalism will sometimes rely on unrevealed sources that have access to secret information. The righteous justification is found in revealing who did what to whom, when, where, why and how. What is often criminal.\u00a0\n  \u2022 Whistle-blowing is the non-journalistic cousin of investigative journalism.\n  \u2022 Wikileaks is a political effort aimed at undermining the integrity of powerful states using methods that are illegal, such as theft of information. It is akin to spying except it is not in defense of any nation, but is for the destruction of nations. Wikileaks would argue that it furthers the betterment of mankind, but one wonders why undertakings are done with disregard toward laws. Laws are the rules by which we pursue the betterment of mankind.\u00a0\nWikileaks is Nixon, doing illegal acts for political purposes. Investigative journalism is Woodward, doing discovery on illegal acts.\n\nWe should be clear on this.\n\nScurrilous scumbag:\u00a0(adjective fronting a noun) Julian Assange\n\n\n  1. I was able to follow the thread of your exchanges with the bitter half of Raissa, as I took a similar position of opposing Raissa's call for supporting Wikileaks.\n\n    Interestingly, they did not reply to my arguments, except for \"pls dont give this scenario, we will deal with it when it happens\".\n    They could not answer the lack of accountability of Wikileaks, and the potential for abuse by it. They are naively assuming Wikileaks will always be on the side of \"good\".\n\n    I actually find your arguments quite weak, considering the US does the same through its spy agencies.\n\n    What was not brought up was this: we all take sides in this war for information, war of ideologies and actual warfare. If he is arguing for equal rights for North Korea and China, then the conversation ends there.\n\n    In any case, my advice: continue to post away, but avoid having a conversation with him. I think many find him obnoxious and petty, but he is part of the conjugal blog, and nothing can change that. On the big issues, he is very much on the same side as us: RH, anti-corruption, anti-trapo, cybercrime, FOI, etc.\n\n    I guess he is underemployed; combine that with a retiree like you will likely result in extra-argumentative discussions. :)\n\n    Apply Simon and Garfunkel's \"Sounds of Silence\" or Fr Tabora's \"Scent of Silence\" on him. :)\n\n    1. \"I actually find your arguments quite weak\" Yes, see, that is the thing. He is smart enough to win the argument on the merits of the issue, because I agree. The foundation of my argument is the softest sand imaginable. I had to stretch to hold position.\n\n      To me, Alan is a skilled 100 percenter, determined to win even if he destroys others in the process. I understand his affinity for Assange. But you give good advice. I'm in the cooling off period and will likely return over there on a different thread, different topic.\n\n    2. ps. Your \"lack of accountability\" point is excellent. No one can hold Wiki to account.\n\n      pps. The Kissinger project takes old, released information, cleans it up a bit, and organizes it for better accessibility. Now there is an upstanding niche for Wikileaks or another organization, to organize and make available information that is out there, but that no one knows about. Organize it as a gigantic on-line library index card file. Like Gutenberg books; free with a double click.\n\n  2. There's a very interesting topic, (though it needs a lot of planning and evaluation) about privatizing the functions of the Bureau of Customs.\n\n    1. That is interesting. Customs is such a rat's nest of smuggling and illicit fees and bribery and kickbacks with good governance definitely swimming upriver.\n\n  3. 1. To me, WikiLeaks is a grey area. I haven\u2019t fully resolved the issue in my mind. (Refer to item 7.)\n\n    2. For the most part, I accept your definitions and they are clear. As I understand it, WikiLeaks leaks governmental info that it has in its possession. But is the info stolen or volunteered? My impression is that the info is volunteered. But even if volunteered, is it ethical for WikiLeaks to disseminate the info on the Internet? Note also, that some of the WikiLeaks info has been previously released by the governments concerned. (This is not an excuse or justification.)\n\n    3. I am glad you mention FOI. My personal bias is towards transparency, for info to be made available. In the ideal world of transparency, where everything is above board, there is no need for deception. (I know, I am a dreamer.)\n\n    4. On the other hand, I can understand the need for certain things to be kept secret and confidential, such as:\n\n    4.1 At the government level, secrets pertaining to defense.\n    4.2 At the corporate level, secrets pertaining to product technology, the fruits of research development that are not yet protected by patent or copyright, and expansion strategy.\n    4.3 At the family level, secrets pertaining to financial status\n    4.4 At the personal level, bank account details and health history and status.\n\n    5. From the above, one of the obvious reasons for keeping secrets is the misuse of info by others for the purposes of (a) taking advantage or (b) to cause harm. There is also the question of privacy or \"right to info\". But what troubles me about secrecy is one of the eternal questions: Who will guard the guardians? This question applies to WikeLeaks itself. It has been alleged, for instance, that the info they release could be potentially harmful to combatants in the field. (Never mind the question whether a just war is being pursued.)\n\n    6. In the Hierarchy of Loyalties, above the construct of Country is the construct of World. From that view, a man\u2019s loyalty to the brotherhood of man transcends his loyalty to country. As I say the rule is absolute, but the interpretation is relative.\n\n    6.1 So this does not mean that a citizen can reveal his nation\u2019s defence secrets, such as the inner working of atomic bombs. But it does mean that a citizen should expose untruths foisted by the nation\u2019s leaders, such as the absence of WMD weapons in Iran.\n\n    6.2 From the view of the Hierarchy, any construct that possesses an inordinate concentration of power \u2013 nation, church, community, family or person \u2013 must be subject to some type of check-and-balance. This is necessary because of real and potential abuse. And you see this abuse everywhere: in the GOP, the Church, the dynasties, the senators.\n\n    6.3 In the Rule of Expanded Self, where there is conflict between and among constructs, we must always analyse at what level of construct we have identified with and are arguing for. Is our level of identification correct? Or even should we identify at all with any construct?\n\n    7. So the central question is: Where does one draw the line between the need to keep secrets on one hand and the need to divulge secrets on the other? What are the criteria? This is where my powers of analysis fail:\n\n    7.1 Who can keep secrets and why?\n    7.2 What types of info can be kept as secrets? And why? And for how long?\n    7.3 What types of info should be made available. And why? And to whom? And when?\n\n    1. Thanks for taking this to another level, one that merges \"information propriety\" and personal\/community values.\n\n      2.0 The man who \"volunteered\" the US cables and other information is now in jail. If someone came up to Assange with a bunch of stolen Rembrants, would he keep them? Call the police? Sell them? Duplicate them and publish them?\n\n      7.0 It is the tension between what to keep secret and what to release that is the \"check and balance\", going evermore onward. It demonstrates a healthy democracy that such tension exists. The tensions in the US have pushed government evermore forward to answer the questions you pose. The time release depends on the sensitivity of the document. Highly sensitive, long time. Which respects the tension between what historians want, access to historical documents, and what government fears, information used out of context to damage.\n\n    2. @Edgar,\n\n      My main beef with Wikileaks is that it is accountable to no one- except for Assange, it is just a faceless and nameless group of hackers who decide for themselves what info to steal and put out there. Supporting it is reckless.\n\n      Many of Wikileaks' hackers come from 4chan, many of whom were also responsible for hacking credit card databases and other banking systems.\n\n      Those who support it are mistaken that Wikileaks will always play the good guy and incorrectly compare them to Woodward of Watergate or other whistleblowers. But they are not.\n\n      Once it turns rogue, who will rein them in? When Robin Hood starts stealing from the poor, who can stop him?\n\n      The argument that governments, specially the US, do the same thing that Wikileaks does is correct, but at least govts can be held accountable. They can lose re-election, they can be prosecuted, and programs deemed immoral... (truncated)",

        "text":"Thursday, June 23, 2011\n\nHair Today, Gone Tomorrow\n\nBy Grace Terhune\n\nSouthern Beauty Shop mysteries (Lila Dare)\n\nI suppose y'all could guess that since I make my living as a stylist, I think about hair a lot. I find myself checking out the hair on the women (and some of the men) I see when I'm out and about in St. Elizabeth. Have you ever noticed that different parts of the country seem to have slightly different trends in hairstyles? Here in the South, women still like their hair a little full and mostly long. We like up-dos for weddings and formal events. And we like our highlights!\n\nLadies from the northeast, if Real Housewives of New Jersey is anything to go by, like big hair, too, but they're more likely to be brunette and to actually tease their hair. Ye gods! Teasing is NOT good for your hair, ladies.\n\nCalifornia gals like that sleek Jennifer Aniston look and midwesterners are more likely to wear their hair short or tied back in a ponytail. Must be because all that wind completely undoes a 'do.\n\nI just let my mom cut me some bangs and do some lowlights in my hair. I like to change my style now and then--more so now that there's an interesting man or two in my life!\n\nHow do you wear your hair? do you change it up when something changes in your life? (Marriage, baby, lost job, whatever?)\n\n\n  1. I'm in the Pacific Northwest and change my hair whenever I get bored. I've had it both long and super short. Right now it is short with a little flip to the ends. It is a copper color with blondish highlights. Actually, those highlights are now pink, teal, and blue. I get those colors every year for Relay for Life. They are the thyroid cancer awareness ribbon colors and since I've had thyroid cancer I wear them proudly to show I am a survivor!\n\n  2. I keep my hair short; makes it easier when I'm on the run and running late.\n\n  3. Hmmm, well I am from the midwest (Indiana) and I wore my hair straight or up in a ponytail most of the time.\n\n    I now live in the south (Louisiana) and I kept it mid length, and would still pull it up in a ponytail once in a while.\n\n    I recently cut my hair short (above the collar). I've been working out and have lost approx. 40 pounds since January, and with the heat wave and all, it was just too hot and heavy.\n\n    I have a lot of grey in my hair, and had kept it light brown, but I am moving on to blonde (dark) this week.\n\n    Have a grand of a day!\n\n  4. I had it long for years, then cut it all off. It was flattering, everyone said, and I liked it, but I couldn't play with it as much. I have every kind of hair thingie imaginable! So now it's growing out again.\n\n  5. I wish I lived near you, Grace!\n\n  6. I'm at the mercy of my hairdresser. She suggests a change & I go for it -- I like to think I'm being adventuresome. Perhaps not.\n\n  7. I have lived most of my life in the South but definitely am not into the Southern style hair. It is short and thick. Have red hair which is going grey so it looks like it is frosted. And have a terrible time finding someone who can cut it good. Wish I was near to you Grace.\n\n  8. Hi ladies,\n\n    You sound like a brave lot--changing up your hair often and going against fashion. Good for you! It's attitudes like that that help keep us stylists in business!\n\n    Tonya--Congrats on the weight loss! Ria--I've been wanting to go reddish so maybe I'll try a copper color like yours this summer, but I don't think I'm enough of a rebel to have the pink and teal tips, although it sounds like yours are for a good cause.\n\n  9. I live in Texas with a Midwest hairdo, since that's where I'm from. Not a ponytail, though, chin length bob. Or a little longer. Interesting observations!",

        "text":"\u2022 Chips have arrived!\n\n    bafeigum09\/26\/2014 at 19:24 4 comments\n\n    So my chips finally passed through customs and arrived in sealed anti-static bags. I connected up the VDD and GND to a bench power supply as others have noted that these chips need quite a bit of power. I also needed to connect the CH_PD pin to 3.3V to enable the chip. Just on standby, the chip consumes about 70mA.\u00a0\n\n    I connected the TX and RX lines to my Sparkfun FTDI Basic and fired up Putty\u00a0just to test out some commands before I hook it up to a chipKIT. I have to talk to the chip over 115200 Baud, and 57600\u00a0does not work. I received READY in my Putty terminal and sent AT+RST. The chip spit out a bunch of boot up text which I will include later when I write a post showing the response of all of the commands. I sent AT+CWLAP and nothing... at first I received ERROR. I sent it a couple more times and actually got the chip to list the access points! I tried connecting to my wifi router, but I entered the password wrong and still received OK. I tried sending the inquiry if I was connected and the chip hung up and any command I sent after that said it was busy. All further attempts to send AT+CWLAP hang up the chip.\n\n    So I would say so far, the chip isn't as easy to use out of the box as others have stated. I will investigate further and send some more commands and write up a post detailing how the chip responds.\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 Work still in progress...\n\n    bafeigum09\/11\/2014 at 17:04 1 comment\n\n    I am still awaiting the arrival of the modules I ordered from AliExpress. I have a tracking number, but it doesn't seem valid yet. It is great reading up on the progress others who have received their modules are making! Peter has been active in the comments and has successfully sent TCP data.\u00a0\n\n    I will provide another update when I receive the modules and being work on the library. I was originally going to write the library for the MSP430 microcontrollers, but it looks like many people who have received their modules are using the Arduino. I might create the library for the Arduino first so that I can get the most amount of people debugging the library. I will eventually port the library to both platforms.\n\n  \u2022 More AT Command Information Found\n\n    bafeigum08\/29\/2014 at 02:28 0 comments\n\n    So looking around on this German forum post about the ESP8266\n\n\n    I saw that somebody translated the Chinese AT command pdf (into German which google than translated into English for me). The translation this person posted had much more information about the chip than I had seen before!

It seemed like it would be just BARELY enough to get a good library going, however a lot of information was missing like possible return values and the returned data format. It wouldn't have been impossible to figure this stuff out after getting the chip, but it would have taken longer just poking around.\n\n    Read on to see the translated document and what to expect from the List Access Points Command.\n\n    Read more \u00bb\n\n  \u2022 Two ESP8266 Modules Ordered\n\n    bafeigum08\/27\/2014 at 17:56 0 comments\n\n    I just placed an order for two ESP8266 Modules from AliExpress for $9.50 including free shipping. The processing time is 7 days and the expected shipping time is over 2 weeks. I will be posting the currently available documentation and the translations people have posted soon. I will also create a new GitHub repository to start commiting preliminary code based off of the documentation.",

        "text":"\nInternet &amp; Networking It looks like several companies are learning what happens when you mess with the internet - and they're learning it the hard way. Several major companies have been hit by the collective powers of Anonymous after 4chan launched several distributed denial-of-service attacks. What many have been predicting for a long time now has finally happened: an actual war between the powers that be on one side, and the internet on the other. Update: PayPal has admitted their WikiLeaks snub came after pressure from the US government, and Datacell, which takes care of payments to Wikileaks, is threatening to sue MasterCard over Wikileaks' account suspension. Update II: is down due to the attack. Update III: PayPal has caved under the pressure, and will release the funds in the WikiLeaks account.\nPermalink for comment 452654\nTo read all comments associated with this story, please click here.\nOS news?\nby John Blink on Wed 8th Dec 2010 12:49 UTC\nJohn Blink\nMember since:\n\nPlease report what has been done using OS's, and not opinion pieces.\n\nThere are other websites I can visit for that.\n\nWhat category does this fit into?\n\nPlease don't be upset.
