        "text":"5 Ways To Naturally Treat Burns\n\nbeth March 4, 2013\n\n\nNaturally Treating BurnsImage by\u00a0rogersmj\n\nBurns happen easily. It doesn\u201dt matter how you get them, by bumping into the clothes iron or grabbing something hot off the stove, they hurt! Not only do they hurt but if left untreated they can become infected, product nasty scars, and overall become much worse than they have to be. Many store bought burn creams contain a list of unfavorable ingredients that, while your finger might feel better, your body wont appreciate.\n\nInstead, naturally treat your burns with things that are just as easy to make sure you have on hand.\n\n**Note, this post in in reference to minor burns. If you get a serious burn seek medical advice.\n\nLavender Essential Oil\n\nLavender essential oil will work wonders to cool and calm a burn. It also naturally has\u00a0antibiotic\u00a0and antiseptic\u00a0properties\u00a0that will keep the burn from getting infected. Not to mention the calming effect the the scent itself can have when your a little\u00a0distraught\u00a0at having\u00a0burned\u00a0yourself to begin casino online with.\n\nRaw Honey\n\nRaw honey is\u00a0antibacterial and very healthy for the skin. This attributes to it\u201ds ability to lower the risk of scarring. It also works well to relieve the pain. Raw honey\u00a0contains natural enzymes, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins that make it a great wound fighter.\u00a0Simply clean the wound and apply the honey to the burn itself and the area around it. You can repeat this as needed.\n\n\nThis herb has been used for centuries for many skin issues \u2013 including burns. It has\u00a0antibacterial, anti-fungal, and antiviral properties which make it great to promote healing and keep infection at bay. An easy way to apply this useful herb is to boil it as a tea. After you let the tea cool dip a cloth in it and apply it as a compress. You can also find it directly as an oil or use the herb itself in a homemade cream to keep on hand.\n\nAloe Vera\n\nChances are you have this plant around the house \u2013 and if not you should get one. Aloe is full of beneficial nutrients that promote healing and relieve pain. By keeping a plant on hand you will get the most benefit of this. The longer the aloe has been cut from the plant the more healing benefits are lost. \u00a0Some store bought aloe might also contain\u00a0unnecessary\u00a0additives and preservatives that you would prefer to avoid when healing.\n\nCoconut Oil\n\nIs there anything coconut oil can\u201dt do? Coconut oil has long been known to prevent infections that could be caused by bacteria. It also speeds healing. It is important that you are buying virgin, unrefined coconut oil in order to get the healing benefits \u2013 just like with aloe the more processing it goes though the less health benefits you can gain from it.\n\nHow Do You Naturally Treat Burns?\n\nConfused about vaccines?\n\n\nGet our FREE no-nonsense vaccine guide. Answer your questions with rational, fact-based information instead of fear.\n\nPowered by ConvertKit\n\nThis is the writings of:\n\n\n\n  1. OK, so I\u2019ve been thinking. There are so many articles and posts about things used to \u201ctreat and heal\u201d various minor ailments from colds to burns to cuts and scrapes. Why must we always treat everything with something? Why can\u2019t we just let things run the course and heal by themselves? When someone in my house gets a burn, we put in under cold running water for a few minutes. Then nothing, no ointments, no lavender oils, nothing. Colds? I do nothing, no elderberry, no saline drops, no decongestants, nothing. Cuts and scrapes? Wash it with soap and water, then maybe a dry bandaid, perhaps a dab of antibiotic ointment one time right after it happens, then nothing. Just having trouble understanding the push to always treat something or make it heal faster. Maybe I\u2019m just too practical?\n\n\n    \u2022 Pam,\n      That\u2019s really a matter of preference. In our home we don\u2019t always do something either. For instance, with a fever we let it run its course. With a cold we make things more comfortable, we boost our immune systems, we support our body in doing its job \u2013 but we don\u2019t interrupt it. We just enhance it. Same for burns \u2013 we aid the body in doing its job and make things a little less painful.\n\n\n    \u2022 The article is aimed at sharing natural healing methods rather than conventional methods like \u201cantibiotic ointment\u201d. You\u2019d have better success with using a good brand lavender oil as it is antibiotic, antiseptic, calming and healing.\n\n\n  2.

        "text":"8 Things That Giveaway Someone Carrying A Concealed Firearm\n\nLet\u2019s face it, even the most seasoned concealed carrier will sometimes find him or herself drawing a little attention to themselves and their firearms once in a while. After some time, the instances will become less frequent, but it\u2019s good to be conscious of the things we tend to do when we first start carrying.\n\nThis article is mostly for people who are new to concealed carry, or haven\u2019t even started carrying yet. It\u2019s good to keep these things in mind, because a lot of the time we will do them without even noticing. While many people wouldn\u2019t think twice about seeing you do these moves, some will know why you\u2019re doing them.\n\nAdjusting Your Rig\n\nLightly touching the firearm and\/or holster to make sure that it\u2019s in the proper position is something that we all do from time to time, but it should be something that we do in private. A restroom for instance, is a great location to make any necessary adjustments. The number one time that I find myself doing this is right after getting up from a seated position. When we sit, our rig can have a chance to shift a little bit, and it may feel like it needs some adjustment when we stand up. If you can, do this adjustment quickly and tie it in to the next point; the shirt tug.\n\nThe Shirt Tug\n\nA quick tug down on your shirt to make sure that your firearm is covered never hurt anyone, but making a habit of it will draw attention to yourself and that area (right where your firearm happens to be). If you are wearing the proper clothing to cover everything that needs to be covered, there should be no reason to \u2018tug\u2019 at your shirt. An exception would be right after you\u2019ve gotten up from a chair, in which case you may want to give your shirt a quick tug just to make sure it\u2019s in the right spot. Again, this depends on your current outfit and will not be necessary for everything. After that however, leave it alone until you\u2019re somewhere private.\n\nWith the first two points, if your rig is really out of place, you should realize this simply by how it feels. If you carry regularly, you should be very familiar with how your rig feels during your daily activities.\n\nThe \u201cMaking Sure It\u2019s Still There\u201d Move\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re new to concealed carry, this is something that happens often until we are used to carrying on a daily basis. It\u2019s usually just a quick touch of the back of the firearm while it sits in the holster. It\u2019s part \u2018make sure it\u2019s seated in the holster\u2019 and part \u2018make sure it\u2019s still there\u2019. It\u2019s also part \u2018unnecessary\u2019 because if you have a proper holster, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\nSome on our Facebook page even made note of the fact that they\u2019ve been guilty of \u2018resting\u2019 their arm\/hand on the firearm.\n\nPull Up Your Pants\n\nPulling up your pants is a little more difficult when you add a firearm into the mix. If you ever find yourself needing to lift up your belt and pants to a correct position, you may want to make a few adjustments. The first one would be to make sure that your belt is tight enough, and that you\u2019re using a proper belt for concealed carry. Remember that you have an extra pound or two (or more) that\u2019s being supported by your belt, so it\u2019s important to have a sturdy belt to keep things up.\n\nWearing Shirts That Just Don\u2019t Work\n\nI tend to put an emphasis on printing because I\u2019m not a fan. Some think that it\u2019s not that big of a deal and that\u2019s fine, but I do what I can to avoid any printing of my rig. The entire point of concealed carry is keeping it concealed and unnoticed so that\u00a0no one knows you are carrying.\n\nThe only way to tell if a shirt is going to work is to throw it on with your rig and check yourself out in the mirror. Some of your favorite shirts may simply not work anymore and should not be worn. If you see excessive printing, it\u2019s best to avoid that shirt and move onto another one. Or, throwing on another layer (weather permitting) may solve any printing issues.\n\nWearing Firearm Related Attire\n\nIf I\u2019m wearing a Justin Bieber shirt (I\u2019m not, I swear), chances are I enjoy her his music. If I\u2019m wearing a firearm-related shirt, chances are I\u2019m a gun owner. While it may not mean that I carry a firearm, it definitely supports the thought.\u00a0Be mindful of what you wear if you\u2019re worried about being profiled, because chances are you\u2019re being profiled.\n\nSome people will fight me day and night on this point, but I stand by my reasoning.\n\nPut it this way; if you\u2019re at the bank with two other people and you\u2019re the only one with an NRA hat and an \u201cI love the 2nd Amendment\u201d shirt, guess who the bank robber is going to watch the closest. Sure the chances are slim, but the reason we carry is so we\u2019re prepared. This is just another step in preparedness, and it\u2019s called blending in.\n\nNot Swinging Your Arm On The Side You Carry\n\nFor instance, if you carry on your right side, your right arm is likely to swing much less than your left when you walk. It\u2019s a way that we protect our firearm without even noticing that we\u2019re doing it.\n\nInspire others by sharing the link to this page on websites, Facebook or email!\nClick Here to Learn More Secrets!",

        "text":"Ever found yourself wondering how to use Twitter to grow your blog? It\u2019s one of the trickier social media platforms to master, but once you get the hang of it, this network can drive engaged subscribers, readers and potential customers to your blog or small business website.\n\nI\u2019ve been on Twitter since 2010 but managed to get comfortable with this space only in the last 3 years or so. In that time, I\u2019ve managed to win two awards for best use of Twitter from Women\u2019s Web for 2016 and 2017. This is despite having a relatively small number of followers (less than 6000) even today.\n\nBut one of the things I keep telling people is that it isn\u2019t enough to use a network; it\u2019s important to keep evolving and changing methods to see what works even better.\n\n9 Ways you can use Twitter to Grow your blog. Social Media Tips on a black background laptop next to a microphone, keyboard and books on a desk.\n\nWhat you need to remember is that Twitter is a social network and must be used as such. Without ado, let\u2019s dive into the techniques I\u2019ve used in the last couple of months to improve engagement and generate interest in my content. You may be using some of these tips already and I\u2019d love to know if you find any of the others useful.\n\n[easy-tweet tweet=\u201d9 Ways to Use Twitter and grow your blog.\u00a0 #Bloggers\u201d user=\u201dshyvish\u201d]\n\nAs a blogger, one of the best ways to get eyes on your content is to enable social sharing icons on your site. Ensure that you have your Twitter handle configured so you know when someone shares your content.\n\nAdditionally, you can add one or two relevant hashtags to get more eyes on the content.\n\nIf you use WordPress, you\u2019d get the default Jetpack sharing buttons. But a while ago, the Twitter platform stopped allowing share counter updates.\u00a0\n\nKnowing this, a few sharing services brought back that functionality. For instance, I use the paid version of the plugin, \u2018Easy Social Share\u2019. It also pulls the share count for your old posts, even if you\u2019ve changed the domain or moved to HTTPS a while ago.\n\nTip: Keep track of high-performing links and remember to add them again to Twitter after a reasonable gap.\n\nThis is a trick I began using a while ago and I\u2019ve seen a definite difference in terms of engagement. When I re-share my content the second or third time around, I leave out my handle.\n\nThat way, it\u2019s only the title of the link and the URL that goes out plus an image. For some reason, this tends to generate more interest in my content.\n\nTip: If you would like to know if someone else has shared your content without tagging you, sign up for a free account at warble. Each day, you will get a mail with a list of tweets that have shared links from your website. Neat, huh? \ud83d\ude42\n\nShare images not present in the post\n\nMost of us already have images in our posts and featured images as well. Often, when we share a link, the url pulls the featured image to share on Twitter. Instead, what you can do is share a different image (one not present in the post). Check the example below.\n\nIn this you can see that I have added an image, but it does not actually exist in the post. A picture is worth a thousand words? Yes and sometimes, it\u2019s worth 200 characters in a tweet. \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe more relevant, timely and apt the image, the more likely it is that people will click on the link attached to the tweet.\n\nTip: Find the most fabulous free images on Pixabay, Pexels and Unsplash for you to use for this purpose!\n\nShare images with minimal text overlay\n\nThis is a tip I picked up from Pinterest. \ud83d\ude42 I noticed how I was more likely to click on an image which had a brief bit of text on it, telling me what the link is about.\n\nSimilarly, doing that on Twitter has ensured better click-throughs to the site. And this can be done for any niche! See the attached tweet.\n\nTip: Keep the text minimal, as mentioned. Too much crowding of the image can turn viewers off when they are scrolling through the feed. Less is more, always. \ud83d\ude42\n\nInclude a Call-to-action (CTA)\n\nRemember how I said Twitter is all about being \u2018social?\u2019 That applies to this tip. Most users are scrolling through Twitter at breakneck speed. You need something to stop them in their tracks and click on your content.\n\nThis is why I sometimes try and write a small, personal note of sorts in addition to my url. Merely sharing the URL is no big deal. Adding a personal touch increases its value. Explain why it matters to you, what you\u2019ve learnt from it or how it has helped you. These are valuable CTAs for content in any niche.\n\nAdd a tweet without hashtags\n\nI can hear your gasp of disbelief! What? Twitter and NO hashtags?!\u00a0\n\nRelax. I don\u2019t mean you should never use hashtags ever. I am just saying it\u2019s one method. Try and share a link using just key words and neatly spaced out sentences in the tweet, together with the link to your content.\n\nSince Twitter is also highly visual, sometimes that\u2019s all you need for people to pause and click on a link you\u2019ve shared.\n\nShare personal updates\/tips\/threads\n\nOne of the best ways to generate interest in your content, drive traffic to your website and intrigue potential customers\/clients is to be personal on social media.\n\nThis is true across all platforms.One of my most popular tweets is this one about numbers on social media.\n\nWe must remember that retweets and likes are very gratifying but very often they are mere vanity metrics. Unless you are actually driving traffic to the blog or getting clients through a network, most of the time spent here can be pretty wasted.\n\nTip: If you have the paid version of Buffer, you can track your tweets\u2019 performance and sort them by \u2018Most Clicks\u2019. This is what tells you which of your tweets\/links are driving the most traffic to your website.\n\nEndorse others in your niche\n\nIf you genuinely care about the content other people in your niche create, be sure to give them a warm shout out on Twitter.\n\nEven though advertising is a great way to promote your content, nothing can beat word-of-mouth recommendations. The more you do this, the more people tend to rely on your recommendations for future updates.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve realised is the more I take time to craft a recommendation for a particular brand\/blogger, two things happen:\u00a0\n\n  \u2022 I get valuable engagement on that specific tweet\n  \u2022 Other brands and bloggers return the favour, even without my asking for it!\n\nDon\u2019t Retweet your own content shared by others\n\nThis may be the most controversial tip of all, but I do believe it carries weight.\u00a0A lot of us bloggers do this almost by default. We see that someone has shared our content, we hit the \u2018like\u2019 button and thank them. Next, we go ahead and retweet that content.\n\nI stopped retweeting my content when shared by other people. Well, about 90% of the time.\n\nThe reason being, I feel that many of our followers tend to see the same content over and over again from us. While it\u2019s great to see the content in a variety of ways (see tips 1 to 5 above), after a while, it can be a bit awkward to retweet those links.\n\nSome of the most prolific and versatile bloggers I follow in my niche do not retweet their content, especially when it is shared by others.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is if I find that an idol of mine or an account I deeply admire has shared my content. Then I am over the moon and retweet that. Still a vain thing to do, but I am working on it. \ud83d\ude09\u00a0\n\nBut, come on! When Laura Vanderkam retweets your post on time blocking, you HAVE to share that. \ud83d\ude00\n\nWant to grow your presence on Twitter and drive traffic to your blog through this social media platform? These are 9 of my tips that may help you as a blogger. #TwitterTips #SocialMedia #Shailajav\n\nSo, tell me!

Bordering South Carolina and Georgia, Lake Thurmond covers more than 71,000 acres. And with more than 2,100 residents, Savannah Lakes Village is home to three lakefront golf courses, community events at restaurants, daily programs at the recreation and tennis center, and hundreds of miles of land and water trails. It's located near the small town of McCormick in the heart of the Sumter National Forest.\n\nThe Waccamaw Neck, Georgetown County\n\nThe Waccamaw Neck is a narrow peninsula along the coast in Georgetown County, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and the Waccamaw River. The neck was a major hunting and fishing ground for the Waccamaw tribe and later became the site of rice plantations on the west and beach resorts to the east. Today, the 27-mile stretch south of Myrtle Beach is dotted with beach, golf and tennis retreats, filled with vacationers and year-round residents, including a large number of retirees. The Neck runs from the fishing and restaurant village of Murrells Inlet to the port city of Georgetown. It's home to the historic beach community of Pawleys Island, the upscale residential oceanside community at DeBordieu Colony and resort living in Litchfield Beach. On the west side of US 17 are several planned communities, including Wachesaw Plantation, Willbrook, Litchfield Country Club and The Reserve. But the area is more than just a beach and golf resort. Check out Brookgreen Gardens, a 9,100-acre sculpture garden and wildlife preserve just south of Murrells Inlet that opened in 1932 on the site of four former rice plantations. Just across the road is Huntington Beach State Park, originally the property of Anna Hyatt Huntington and Archer M. Huntington, whose former home, Atalaya Castle, is located in the park.\n\n\nIf you like horses and beautiful weather, you'll want to put Aiken on your list of potential retirement locations. Located in the western part of the state, just across the Savannah River from Augusta, Ga., it's been popular with horse lovers for generations for its fox hunting, polo and steeplechase events. In the late 19th century, the town was famous as a wintering spot for wealthy people from the Northeast, earning it the name \"the Winter Colony.\" It's still a spot for the horsey set, home to the Aiken Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame and Museum and races sanctioned by the National Steeplechase Association. The historic downtown is populated with restaurants, art galleries and boutiques, and the University of South Carolina-Aiken Academy for Lifelong Learners, offers educational and intellectually stimulating programs.\n\nKiawah Island, Charleston\n\nKiawah Island is about 20 miles south of downtown Charleston-close enough to take advantage of top-flight restaurants and cultural life in one of the nation's best cities. But the upscale, gated beach and golf resort of Kiawah is known for its own natural beauty and luxury. It is home to five championship golf courses, including the renowned Ocean Course. Kiawah boasts 10 miles of beaches and preserved maritime forests and marshes-with bike and walking trails making it easy to explore. Nearly two-fifths of its population of under 2,000 is age 65 or older, and Kiawah has earned a spot on Forbes' list of top 25 places to retire. Housing ranges from high-end beach and golf course condos to large single-family homes. Freshfields Village, a town-center mix of shops, restaurants and services, is located just before you enter the gate to Kiawah.\n\nDaniel Island, Charleston\n\nIt's been around for just 20 years, but the planned community near Charleston has turned into a true island town with more than 10,000 residents. Traditional neighborhoods feature tree-lined streets and sidewalks with a variety of homes-from townhouses and condominiums to single-family homes along golf courses. It's surrounded by rivers, creeks and Charleston Harbor, so there's plenty of access to boating, swimming and fishing. But it's the parks and natural areas that set it apart, with 400 acres of the sea island set aside as green space and more than 20 miles of leisure trails. The Daniel Island Club, a private country club, has two golf courses with a true Lowcountry setting. The community has earned a spot on Where to Retire magazine's list of America's 100 Best Master-Planned Communities.\n\nLake Keowee\n\nLake Keowee in the South Carolina Upstate combines lakeside living with breathtaking views of the Blue Ridge mountains. The large reservoir with 300 miles of shoreline was created by damming the Little River and the Keowee River. About 45 minutes west of Greenville and just seven miles from Clemson University, Lake Keowee is becoming a hot development site for retirees, families and weekend visitors. The area is home to dozens of upscale housing developments, including the Cliffs communities, offering a variety of housing and community options around the lake, and The Reserve at Keowee, which features a golf course, town center and marina.\n\nPage Ivey\nDiscover writers share all of the places, activities and adventure that South Carolina has to offer.

        "text":"About these ads\n\nDC Characters In Need of the\u00a0Spotlight\n\n\nTwo years ago DC Comics made a dramatic and controversial movie by rebooting its entire line of comics under the banner of The New 52. The move attracted a whole new audience to their product as they not only made their comics friendly to beginners but also diversified their product with a new focus on; horror, fantasy, and westerns. We are now two years into this new era of the beloved comics publisher and yet there have been many beloved characters who have yet to appear or have shown up only in brief glimpses. These heroes and villains may not have the popularity which comes with having an \u201cS\u201d or a bat on their chest but they do have devoted fanbases who want to see them.\n\nWally West\/The Flash:\u00a0True Barry Allen may be the most iconic speedster to ever put on the red wllywstand yellow, but an entire generation of fanboys (myself included) are for more familiar with his former sidekick, Wally West. Under the famous runs of writers such as; Mark Waid and Geoff Johns we fell in love with West as he grew into his own in the Flash legacy. During\u00a0Flashpoint\u00a0we saw the character die at the hands of his arch nemesis, Captain Cold and since then there has been no sign of him. Out of all the characters in their pantheon, DC must realize that Wally West is the one most fans are clamoring to see.\n\nThe Question:\u00a0Like the Loch Ness Monster and Sasquatch, this mysterious investigator has been sighted in brief glimpses around the dark alleys of the DC Universe lately, hinting that he is part of a larger story at work. Largely ignored throughout most of his time on the printed pages, his appearances in the animated series,\u00a0Justice League Unlimited\u00a0turned the obscure hero into a fan favorite and his final moments in the weekly series,\u00a052, further endeared him to comic fans. Hopefully as the larger story that he seems tied up in grows, we will see the trench coat clad vigilante spouting off his famous eccentricities.\n\nStephanie Brown\/Batgirl\/Spoiler:\u00a0The teenage hero everyone hated, until she took on the mantle of\u00a0Batgirl\u00a0under the pen of\u00a0Bryan Q Miller. Miller succeeded where so many others have failed in showing the readers who Brown was and why we should care about her. Many fans have had a hard time accepting the fact that she is simply gone, just as they had grown attached to her and wish to see her swing across the dark skies of Gotham once again. While few are suggesting that she returns to the\u00a0Batgirl mantle, especially since Gail Simone is blowing everybody away in her current run, perhaps a return to her\u00a0Spoiler\u00a0persona is in order; and given her chemistry with current Batgirl Barbara Gordon perhaps she can take on a fun sidekick role.\n\nBlue_Beetle_by_Miketron2000Ted Kord:\u00a0Before Jaime Reyes, rediscovered the scarab,\u00a0Blue Beetle\u00a0was a geeky underdog who sought to use his resources for justice. Often looked down upon as simply being\u00a0Boost Gold\u2019s\u00a0best bud, their is no doubt that the character had a lot of heart; which he proved in the lead up to the\u00a0Infinite Crisis. With the relatively clean slate the creators at DC now have a return is not outside the realm of possibility. Though the role of Blue Beetle is already filled, Kord is an interesting enough character he can stand on his own out of costume.\n\nJustice League International:\u00a0A series that ended far too early. The positive is that many of the aspects that made this team so beloved have appeared in the new,\u00a0Justice League of America\u00a0series, but it is not the same. Showcasing the best elements of obscure characters such as; Booster Gold, Vixen, Fire, and Ice. The chemistry of the team members along with some great stories endeared them to fans and\u00a0hopefully\u00a0we can see them pop up again soon.\n\nRaven:\u00a0This staple character of the\u00a0Teen Titans\u00a0oozed cool more than any other teen hero in the DC Universe. Originally slated to appear in the current Titans series, plans were changed as DC seems to be positioning her for a grand scale story arc involving her father\u00a0Trigon. But there is no doubt that this new incarnation of the Teen Titans would greatly benefit in the eyes of readers by having this beloved character return to the team. If need be should could easily be seen splitting her time between the Titans and the\u00a0Justice League Dark.\n\nElongated Man & Sue:\u00a0This couple broke fans\u2019 hearts with their tragic arc in\u00a0Identity Crisis\u00a0then later in\u00a052. With fans having gained a new appreciation for this couple it seems to be the perfect time to ralphandsueput them back in the spotlight in this new rebooted version of the DC Universe. With famous couples such as; Lois and Clark and Barry and Iris being split up in the world of the 52; readers are in need of a strong super hero couple. Much like Lois Lane, Sue Dibney is no damsel in distress as she is often seen right alongside her husband and his Justice League cohorts. And Elongated Man having the combination of Batman\u2019s intelligence and resolved paired with Plasitc Man\u2019s powers, would make him a great addition to the super heroes of the DC 52.\n\nRay Palmer\/The Atom:\u00a0True Ray Palmer was in\u00a0Frankenstein Agent of SHADE\u00a0and a woman under the alter ego of\u00a0The Atom\u00a0has recently joined the ranks of the\u00a0Justice League\u00a0it is still not the same.\u00a0I have always had a soft spot for this particular pint sized character. Perhaps he can be recruited by the\u00a0Justice League of America\u00a0for his intellect, which could be a great asset.\n\nIcon & Rocket:\u00a0One of the more remarkable things about the New 52 is how they successfully integrated characters from DC\u2019s other lines of comics into the DC Universe proper. Now we can see a world where Vertigo\u2019s John Constantine and Wildstorm\u2019s Grifter rub elbow\u2019s with Green Lantern; but many comic fans are wondering about the heroes from another line of comics that once stemmed from DC, Milestone. Aside from a brief series starring the ever popular\u00a0Static Shock, the characters from the city of Dakota have been strangely absent. During his run on\u00a0Justice League of America, Milestone co-creator\u00a0Dwayne McDuffie\u00a0proved that his characters could add a lot of excitement in the DCU.\u00a0Icon\u00a0and his sidekick\u00a0Rocket\u00a0were easily the most intriguing characters to come from the era of Milestone Media and would be a welcome edition to the New 52. Seeing how one of the purposes for the reboot was to make their characters more contemporary, this duo could easily bring a great deal of social awareness to comics that could grab headlines as the\u00a0politically\u00a0opposed pair offered up their takes on the world.\n\nI know there are many more heroes and villains fans wish to see return to the pages of DC Comics.

        "text":"this image is not available\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nOh sure, you know deep down inside that we're all just one big jumbled mass of target demographics for corporate marketing, but it's one of those fun facts that you don't really think about, and aren't outright confronted with too often. Until now. A new site from tech company ESRI offers you the opportunity to punch yourself in the face with your geographical stereotype, based on your zip code. By crunching through a mess of big data stats, they have whittled our cultural identities into 67 target market categories. Did they get it right? Let's check, starting with Ferguson, MO:\n\nFerguson, MO. 63135\n\n\nYou can find our stable neighborhoods in major metro areas in the South and West. We are a mix of married couples, singles, grandparents, and young and adult children. Family and faith are the cornerstones of our lives, with a strong focus on religion and character. We live in older, single-family houses. Adult children who still live at home are working toward financial independence. Our unemployment rate is high; we work in health care or in all levels of publics administration Social security and retirement benefits provide income for many. Even though we're one a limited budget, style is important, so we buy clothes for our kids and ourselves at Marshalls and TJ Maxx. Smartphones are a must. TV is big for us; we have 3-4 sets and subscribe to premium channels.\n\nOkay, they left out the part about rampant racial tension and corrupt cops, but it seems relatively ambiguous. How about\u2026.\n\nBeverly Hilly, CA. 90210\n\nPrimary Category: TOP TIER\n\nWe've achieved our corporate career goals and can now either consult or operate our own businesses. We're married couples with older children or without children. Every home maintenance chore in our lavish homes is handled by a variety of contracted services. We can indulge ourselves in personal services at upscale salons, spas, and fitness centers, and shop at high-end retailers for anything we desire. We travel frequently, sparing no expense in taking luxury vacations or visiting our second homes in the US and overseas. Evenings and weekends are filled with opera, classical music concerts, charity dinners, and shopping. We support the arts and other charities, read to expand our knowledge, and depend on the Internet, radio, and newspapers for information. Spending time with family and a small circle of close friends is a priority.\n\nYep. Seems about right, at least according to my preconceptions and a certain television show. What's another famously stereotyped locale?\n\nWilliamsburg, Brooklyn 11249\n\nPrimary Category: TRENDSETTERS\n\nBelieving that \"you're only young once,\" we're living life to the fullest, unfettered by home and vehicle ownership, and not ready to settle down. We're young, educated singles with good jobs who spend our disposable income on upscale city living and entertainment\u2013mostly on rent. Even though we're spenders, we seek financial advice and are building our investment portfolios. Dressed head to toe in the most current fashions, we fill our weeknights and weekends with discovering local art and culture, dining out, or exploring new hobbies. We must be connected at all times; texting and social media are essential for communication and keeping up with our social lives. E-readers and tablets are preferred for everything except women's fashion and epicurean magazines, which must be in print. We shop at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's for quick, organic meals.\n\nDamn. Okay. Here's a slightly harder one, the smallest town in all of Montana\u2026\n\nIsmay, MT. 59336\n\nPrimary Category: PRAIRIE LIVING\n\nMost of us are married, family farmers who work hard on our land, located primarily in the Midwest. We shop only when we need something, and stick to the food brands we know. Other than farm equipment, we own and drive trucks, SUVs, and ATVs. Technology isn't of particular interest. Financial activities include banking in person, investing in low-interest CDs, and holding term\/whole life insurance policies. Faith and religion are strong influences on our lives; we donate to religious groups and join religious clubs. Radios are tuned to inspirational, faith, and country music stations. We also own pets, watch TV via satellite, shop at Walmart, and eat out at Subway. When there's time, we hunt, fish, go to country music concerts, and camp out.\n\nGeneralizations? Absolutely. Accurate? Maybe. They certainly fulfill the stereotype I had in my head. How does your region rate? Who are you to the corporate overlords?
