With a high concentration of healthy nutrients, there are numerous benefits of eating grapes, especially due to its effectiveness as an antioxidant.\n\nWith seeds and without seeds, red to green colored, you can enjoy grapes in a plethora of its available forms and each one has its own distinct taste.\n\nWhat do grapes consist of?\n\nGrapes are one of the healthiest and most nutritious fruits. A cup of grapes weighing approximately 150 grams has only 104 calories despite its ability to serve as a fulfilling snack or a side-dish to a meal. Interestingly, while it has 27.3 grams of carbohydrates, the fat contained in grapes is only 0.2 grams even though they are one of the sweetest fruits when ripe. The same serving of grapes also fulfills approximately one-fourth of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of Vitamin C and Vitamin K. The delicious fruit is also rich in several other minerals and vitamins that make it a favorite and recommended addition to diets.\n\nBenefits of eating grapes:\n\nGrapes Are Rich with Vitamins C and K:\n\nGrapes contain a good amount of Vitamin K and Vitamin C. Vitamin K is a nutrient with potency to maintain a healthy balance of platelets and therefore helping blood clotting. This nutrient is also known to be good for people with bone-related problems or deficiencies. Vitamin C, on the other hand, is efficient at preventing oxidization and also promotes healthy tissue development in the body. Since Vitamin C is an important nutrient and one that is not produced naturally by the body, it is important to add Vitamin C-rich foods in your diet, for which grapes are a great source.\n\nAntioxidant and a great medicine:\n\nAntioxidation is an important process for the body to function in a healthy manner. The antioxidants present in grapes are presented to prevent numerous diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and more, especially with its property of being able to control the movement of free radicals. Among all benefits of eating grapes, this one is the most achievable by the use of red grapes as they contain the highest values of resveratrol.\n\nGrapes are Great for a Good Heart:\n\nGrapes are not good for just some fine wine; they are good in a healthy way for a great and maintained heart health. The plenty of potassium present in grapes provides approximately 6 per cent of the total Recommended Daily Intake, and potassium is actually found via researches to be an efficient remedy at maintaining blood pressure, hence preventing heart diseases like stroke or failure. Moreover, red grapes specifically have been proven to reduce bad cholesterol.\n\nMaintains Sugar Levels in Blood:\n\nWhile it is a common idea that anyone with diabetes should avoid grapes altogether as they contain a lot of glucose, however, it is interesting to realize that how this glucose is absorbed changes its recommendation as a diabetes-friendly fruit. The glucose in grapes is absorbed relatively slowly into the blood stream and the fruit is found to be beneficial in maintaining blood sugar levels and decreasing insulin insensitivity, but only when taken in a controlled diet.\n\nGrapes Improves Your Vision:\n\n10 health benefits of grapes\n\nOne of the most long-term benefits of eating grapes is its effect on eye health. Grapes are known to have the nutrients required for a healthy vision. The antioxidants present in grapes have been found to be beneficial in preventing the eyes from getting damaged by prolonged exposure to blue light emitted by screens. Also, there are several eye diseases that occur with aging that a regular diet of grapes can prevent.\n\nEncourages a Healthy Brain:\n\nGrapes are rich in resveratrol, a nutrient that is often recommended for prevention and treatment by doctors for chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes. However, grapes are not good for just the heart, but also the mind. The resveratrol has been used in many research control groups to find its effects on the brain, and interestingly, it has given great results for an increased attention span, improved memory, and even a happy mood! What\u2019s more? Grapes are known to be an effective hack for preventing the onset of Alzheimer disease or its symptoms.\n\nGrapes Makes Your Bones Stronger:\n\nBones are made stronger with calcium, and more calcium is absorbed into bones with a better diet of grapes. That is because grapes contain a large variety of nutrients required for good bone health, including magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, Vitamin K, and more.\n\nPrevents Common Health Issues:\n\nWith their richness in antioxidants and other nutrients, grapes are almost a medicine for the common cold and other common health issues including viral flus, bacterial and yeast infections etc. These benefits of eating grapes are also contributed to its dosage of Vitamin C which is known to be a booster of immune system. Moreover, the resveratrol in grapes also makes your immune system stronger against potential food-related sicknesses.\n\nGrapes Keeps You Younger:\n\nAnother thought-provoking effect of having grapes in the long term is its anti-aging properties that ultimately increase your life expectancy. There is a gene called SirT1 that is known to prolong life and slow down the aging process. The resveratrol in grapes boosts this gene and thus, keeps you younger for a longer time.\n\nIs eating grapes at night bad for you?\n\nIn general eating any fruit at night is bad for your health. whether it was grapes, bananas, or any other fruit. And that because it will raise your energy levels. And at night your body need to be relaxed and any raise in energy can cause insomnia and listlessness\n\nHow many grapes should you eat a day\n\nA study recommended taking 20 grams of the fruit\u2019s extract every day to maintain sugar levels.\n\nThese are the many benefits of eating grapes that would make your diet healthier, and your body more maintained both internally and externally. Grapes are one of nature\u2019s blessings as they suit most tastes and are available around the world for most times of the year.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.",

        "text":"Banner Dianegilleland Column\n\n(Image by clevercupcakes, via Flickr Creative Commons)\nBy Diane Gilleland\nTwitter is such a great tool for meeting people, connecting with them, and promoting stuff. But it can be very time-consuming to use, and it\u2019s also pretty easy to misuse.\nLuckily, there are so many helpful extras to make your tweeting easier and more effective. Here are some of my favorites.\nDiane Twittertools 2\nCustomize your profile page with Themeleon\nIf you\u2019re using Twitter to promote a crafty business, then it really helps if your Twitter profile page ties in visually with the colors and images of your business brand. Themeleon is a great tool for Twitter-page customization. Once you log into Themeleon through your Twitter account, it lets you upload a new background image, and then helps you choose good background and text colors to go with it. If you don\u2019t have a custom background for your Twitter page yet, you can choose from over a thousand beautiful ones in Themeleon.\n\nDiane Twittertools 3\nOrganize your reading with Twitter Lists\nYour Twitter homepage also offers a great and under-used feature: Lists. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 the more people you follow, the harder it is to read all their tweets. Before long, your Twitter stream becomes simply unmanageable.\nWell, you can organize the people you follow into Lists according to theme, and this really helps you read tweets more efficiently. For example, I have a list of crafty people I follow, and another list of publishing-related people, and another of business-related people. That way, when I have a few minutes to catch up on tweets, I can choose a list and read tweets about a specific subject. You can make your Lists public (so others can see them) or private (so only you can).\nDiane Twittertools 4\nPre-schedule some of your tweets with HootSuite\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Twitter is that, if you want to stay present with your followers all the time, you have to be on Twitter all the time. But most of us have other obligations (not to mention, craft projects to do), so you might want to try scheduling some of your tweets ahead.\nThere are a number of tools that do this, and my favorite is HootSuite. This tool does a whole lot more than schedule tweets \u2013 it will also send updates to Facebook, and shorten the URLs you tweet. You can even import your Twitter Lists into HootSuite and display them in organized columns.\nBut pre-scheduling some tweets is very helpful for time management. If you usually share some good links from around the web, why not schedule them to post throughout the day? That way, you can visit Twitter less often and tackle your To-Do list. And why not schedule some tweets for the hours when you\u2019re asleep? There are people on Twitter 24 hours a day \u2013 why not reach them?\nDiane Twittertools 5\nSpread the word with Pay With A Tweet\nIf you have something to market on Twitter, you can really turn off your followers by tweeting about it over and over again. So instead, you might try Pay With A Tweet. With this service, you create some kind of small freebie \u2013 a PDF tutorial, maybe, or a free pattern.\nNow, to get this freebie, all anyone has to do is tweet about another product or project you\u2019re marketing. This is a nice service because you\u2019re giving people something in exchange for helping you spread the word, and it also lets you reach way outside your existing followers. (Would you like to see this in action? Check out the free tutorial a buddy and I are giving away to people who tweet about our ebook.)\nDiane Twittertools 6\nClean up your following with TwitCleaner\nPeople are popping on and off Twitter all the time. Within the group of folks you\u2019ve followed, there\u2019s very likely a healthy percentage who\u2019ve given up on tweeting altogether. There are probably also quite a few who do nothing but tweet links to their online stores every day.\nTwitCleaner will run you a handy report that shows you which of the people you\u2019re following haven\u2019t tweeted in over a month. It\u2019ll show you which people are tweeting the same links over and over. It will also show you those who don\u2019t interact with people much, and the ones who aren\u2019t following you back. You can use this information to unfollow the people who aren\u2019t bringing value to your Twitter experience.\nDiane Twittertools 7\nLearn more about how you tweet with Twitalyzer\nWhen we\u2019re focused on our next tweet, it\u2019s easy to lose the bigger picture of the story our tweets are telling as a whole. Twitalyzer will analyze your Twitter history and run you a custom report \u2013 with what can only be described as an insane amount of detail.\nYour Twitalyzer report will tell you, among other things, what kind of influence you have on Twitter. It also tells you who the influencers are in your current network, what days and hours you tweet most, how often you\u2019re retweeted, and what subjects you commonly tweet about. You can compare your Twitter influence to that of any other user. Heck, you can even hook Twitalyzer up with your blog\u2019s Google Analytics, and analyze the clicks that come to you through Twitter.\nSeriously, you can spend hours playing with all this data. And you can clearly see how you can improve your tweeting.\nAbout the Author:\nDiane Gilleland produces, a blog that geeks out on crafting and also helps crafters use the web more effectively to promote their businesses.\n\n  \u2022 unsofmarcelo\n\n    I am sure you will love online shopping online shopping\n\nRelated Supplies at Maker Shed",

        "text":"Top 10 Jewish Social Media Moments of 2012\n\nAs 2012 comes to a close, NJOP, and its social media brand, Jewish Treats, recall the social media moments that had us in shock, tears, stiches and pride.\n\n\nJewish Justin Bieber\n\nEdon Pinchot, an Orthodox 14-year-old from Chicago, was nicknamed the \u201cJewish Justin Bieber\u201d while appearing on the NBC reality show, America\u2019s Got Talent. He proudly wore a kippah during each of his performances.\n\n\nMunich 11\n\nThe JCC of Rockland County penned a petition asking for a Minute of Silence at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremonies in memory of the Munich 11. The JCC was joined in their petition by Ankie Spitzer, widow of one of the 11 members of the Israeli team who were killed in the terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Mrs. Spitzer recorded a moving plea to the IOC to grant the request. The petition, which garnered more than 100,000 signatures, may have fallen on deaf ears at the IOC, but viewers worldwide took note and @JewishTweets orchestrated a Social Media Minute of Silence on July 27tth across Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s Jewish Sweetheart\n\n\nJewish Olympian Aly Raisman, an 18-year-old from Needham, Massachusetts, used the popular Jewish tune Hava Nagila for her gold medal winning floor exercise routine and instantly becomes America\u2019s Jewish Sweetheart. Raisman left London with Olympic medals, two gold and one bronze.\n\n\nCircumcision in the News\n\nA video of an Israeli baby \u201cdriving\u201d into his own brit milah (circumcision ceremony) in a remote controlled car ignited great debate about circumcision celebrations. Another circumcision inspired controversy made social media headlines this past summer when a German court effectively banned the religious practice. Recently however, Germany\u2019s parliament approved a bill to keep circumcision legal.\n\n\nTwitter Warfare\n\nIn November, during Operation Pillar of Defense, Israel and Hamas waged Twitter war. The Israel Defense Force used social media to announce and comment on military operations.\n\n\nHurricane Sandy Destroys New York Area Synagogues\n\nJewish humanitarian groups used social media to reach volunteers in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Powerful pictures, like the one above from the Friends of Refugees of Eastern Europe synagogue in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, of a Torah which was unraveled in order to dry it out, were circulated on Facebook and Twitter showing the destruction of New York area synagogues. In poured donations of funds, supplies and even a Torah for one Long Island congregation.\n\n\nAll Things Mayim Bialik!\n\n\nReaders enjoyed Mayim Bialik\u2019s blog on the Jewish parenting website Kveller and visited regularly in 2012 for her firsthand accounts about everything from her hit CBS comedy, The Big Bang Theory to her Emmy nomination, her children, a car accident, a divorce announcement and her glamorous red carpet experiences.\n\n\nCourting the Jewish Vote\n\n(Photo by Uri Fintzy)\n\n\nPresidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each used social media to try to sway Jewish voters in 2012. Both party conventions featured prominent rabbis, Rabbi David Wolpe from Los Angeles and Rabbi Meir Soloveichik from New York. While President Obama clearly won the election and a large majority of the Jewish vote, some analysts see the significant decline from 2008 in the Jewish support for President Obama, as a vindication of their efforts.\n\n\nStandFour Makes Their Debut\n\n\nYeshiva University Maccabeats grads created a breakaway acapella group called StandFour and garnered a quarter million views of their debut video during Chanukah.\n\n\nSupport for Sandy Hook\n\n\nThe nation joined together in mourning for the 20 children and 6 adults who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT. Outpourings of support for the Newtown community were posted across all the social networks. The youngest victim was 6-year-old Jewish kindergartner Noah Pozner. Rabbi Shaul Praver, the Pozner family\u2019s rabbi, recited El Maleh Rachamim, the Hebrew memorial prayer, at a vigil attended by President Obama and family members of the victims.",

        "text":"This week, Maurice Sendak's final book, body snatchers, and two books of poetry. Plus: a Woody Guthrie novel edited by Johnny Depp.\n\nMiracles of Life: Shanghai to Shepperton, an Autobiography by J.G. Ballard (Norton\/Liveright) - Completed just before he died in 2009 at age 79, this compelling memoir by SF novelist Ballard vividly portrays the vanished world of the British upper classes in Shanghai and Cambridge before and after WWII.\n\nA Natural History of Dragons by Marie Brennan (Tor) \u2013 Complete with gorgeous illustrations, this novel takes the form of protagonist Isabella\u2019s memoir of her youthful adventures, in a world where fantastical creatures roam. A rich and absorbing tale of discovery. Check out Brennan\u2019s exploration of the novel\u2019s dragons.\n\nCity of a Thousand Dolls by Miriam Forster (HarperTeen) - Forster makes a strong debut with a fresh South Asian\u2013inspired fantasy\/mystery crossover. Abandoned as a child, 16-year-old Nisha Arvi has grown up within the private walled estate known as the City of a Thousand Dolls. There, orphaned or unwanted girls are raised in six specialized houses, and when they start to go missing, Nisha tries to get to the bottom of it.\n\nSchroder by Amity Gaige (Hachette\/Twelve) - Written as an apology (in both the Socratic and emotional sense) to the narrator\u2019s ex-wife as he awaits trial for taking his six-year-old daughter on an unsanctioned road trip, this novel is quiet and deeply introspective.\n\nOut of the Black Land by Kerry Greenwood (Poisoned Pen) \u2013 In this gripping thriller set in ancient Egypt, the new pharaoh, Akhnaten, holds the heretical religious view that there\u2019s only one god, and acts to spread this idea by banning the worship of the traditional deities. Two charismatic figures\u2014Ptah-hotep, plucked from obscurity to become the Great Royal Scribe and Mutnodjme, Akhnaten\u2019s sister-in-law\u2014display a gift for surviving palace intrigue.\n\nHouse of Earth by Woody Guthrie (Harper) - Guthrie\u2019s multifaceted legacy lives on (and combines beautifully with his affecting 1930 autobiography Bound for Glory) with this posthumous Texas plains novel set during the Dust Bowl era. Includes a preface by Johnny Depp, who polished the rough manuscript.\n\nThe Lady and Her Monsters: A Tale of Dissections, Real-Life Dr. Frankensteins, and the Creation of Mary Shelley\u2019s Masterpiece by Roseanne Montillo (Morrow) - A macabre romp through 18th and 19th century Europe, Montillo\u2019s debut illuminates the circumstances and inspiration behind one of gothic literature\u2019s most notorious tales. Grim body snatchers, cadaver-carving surgeons, and nefarious alchemists litter the pages.\n\nWise Men by Stuart Nadler (Little, Brown\/Reagan Arthur) - Nadler\u2019s portrait of doomed romance, along with dissections of wealth and success worthy of John Cheever, are brilliantly related in this epic account of lawyer Arthur Wise\u2019s ascent in the post-WWII era through the eyes of his son, Hilly.\n\nAnti-Judaism: The Western Tradition by David Nirenberg (Norton) - Based on a decade of exhaustive research, this book explores \u201canti-Judaism\u201d as an intellectual current (as opposed to its overtly political and social analogue, anti-Semitism) from ancient Egypt through to the Frankfurt School and just after the Holocaust. Nirenberg contends that anti-Judaism is \u201cone of the basic tools with which [Western thought] was constructed.\u201d\n\nAngles of Ascent: A Norton Anthology of Contemporary African American Poetry edited by Charles Henry Rowell (Norton) - This important if sprawling collection might be the first to give such a full and various account of its subject: African-American poets since the 1960s, and especially since the 1980s, in much of their ambitiously pluralist, confident, and energetic variety.\n\nMy Brother\u2019s Book by Maurice Sendak (HarperCollins\/di Capua) \u2013 In Sendak\u2019s final work, a series of small, jewel-like watercolors shows two brothers, lithe as acrobats, floating through a desolate world of murky forests and starry skies. The brothers' names are Jack and Guy. Sendak's beloved older brother, Jack, the brother of the title, died in 1995.\n\nIncarnadine by Mary Szybist (Graywolf) - In this highly anticipated second book from Szybist, love poetry and poetry of religious faith blend and blur into one transcendent, humbled substance, in which a beloved is asked, \u201cJust for this evening, won\u2019t you put me before you\/ until I\u2019m far enough away you can\/ believe in me?\u201d This is essential poetry.\n\nWash by Margaret Wrinkle (Atlantic Monthly) - In this deeply researched, deeply felt debut novel, Wrinkle aims a sure pen at a crucial moment following America\u2019s War of Independence when the founding fathers yearned to free the country from the tyranny of slavery. At the center of this story stands Revolutionary War veteran Gen. James Richardson and his slave, Wash.",

There are many benefits to listening to audio books, the following are my top 5:\n\n1. Audio books can be listened to anytime and anyplace, e.g.\u00a0traveling, commuting, exercising, shopping, working in the garden, or even dusting and vacuuming the house.\n\n2. Audio books may\u00a0improve your retention and comprehension of the material, especially if you are an auditory learner or if you are easily distracted by noises (headphones can help block out other noise and help you focus on the material).\n\n3. Listening to an audio book can be more entertaining and exciting than reading a paperback book.\u00a0\u00a0I enjoy when a narrator changes his or her inflections for the characters and doesn\u2019t just read but acts!\n\n4. For those of you who look at the computer monitor and documents for hours, listening to an audio book is more relaxing to your strained eyes after work.\n\n5. Downloading audio books is quick and easy. And coupons (e.g. Audible coupons) or\u00a0membership plans (e.g.\u00a0Audible Gold Membership)\u00a0make audio books affordable. You can even download a high-quality audio book for free as part of the Audible free trial.",

        "text":"Top Lists\n\nTop 4 Waterfalls\n\n\nIt is incredible that something as simple as water falling can bring us so much aesthetic pleasure. Is it the sight of water cascading over rocks that is so delightful or is it the sound the water makes as it crashes down towards earth? Maybe it\u2019s the fact that a waterfall is the perfect example of just how incredible nature can be. Or it could be a combination of all of those factors.\n\nWhatever it is, it is an undisputed fact that standing in front of a mighty waterfall is an awe-inspiring and humbling experience. Of course, not all waterfalls were created equal. Waterfalls range from mere trickles to gigantic sheets of water that leap over cliffs into ravines.\n\nTaking all shapes and sizes into account, here are some of the best waterfalls nature has to offer.\n\nIguazu Falls, Brazil & Argentina\n\nLet\u2019s start with one of the most impressive waterfalls on earth: Iguazu Falls. Cutting across the border between Brazil and Argentina, this waterfall is guaranteed to be one of the most incredible things you have ever laid eyes on. The entire area comprises 275 waterfalls, ranging from the thick, white curtain you have probably seen in photos to some smaller, more elegant cascades. The size of the main fall is utterly staggering, as is the spray it creates on impact.\n\nAngel Falls, Venezuela\n\nAngel Falls is one of the main reasons why people visit Venezuela. Measuring a whopping 979m, it is the highest, uninterrupted waterfall in the world. If you are looking to be blown away by nature, Angel Falls is the place to visit. The waterfall sits within the boundaries of Canaima National Park, which is in itself a remarkable attraction. As you walk through the rich, virgin forest take in the sights and sounds of the exotic wildlife on your way to Angel Falls.\n\nVictoria Falls, Zambia & Zimbabwe\n\nWhen you think of attractions in Africa, your mind probably immediately thinks safaris or Mount Kilimanjaro. While these sights are undoubtedly impressive, they are rivalled by Victoria Falls. This gigantic waterfall complex spans the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe and is a testament to just how powerful Mother Nature is. The best way to admire the falls is to take a helicopter ride over the top or to be daring and visit the Devil\u2019s Pools that sit on the edge of the cascade.\n\nSeljalandsfoss, Iceland\n\nThis beautiful waterfall is hypnotic to behold. Located just off the famous Route 1 that passes through Iceland\u2019s main attractions, the fall is easily accessible. Once there, simply walk along the path that leads from the road and you will find Seljalandsfoss. You can walk behind the waterfalls but make sure you take a waterproof jacket as you will get soaked from the spray. If you get there at the right time you might even be lucky enough to catch a rainbow reflectedin the spray of the waterfall. Be sure to take your camera as this sight is every photographer\u2019s dream.\n\nMost Popular\n\nTo Top",

        "text":"\n\nHow To Succeed At Everything You Do\n\nSuccess comes to those who dare to start, so lazy people never make a difference in the world. Free resources spark initiation and change across the globe.\n\n1. The One Success Secret You Already Know\n\nMost of us want success in our careers, families, and lives. Lazy people wait for miraculous signs. But, people who make a difference should start taking their first steps.\n\nThe uncertain journey to Secret success is sweet if we know changing tracks is inevitable. For, we never know what choices lie ahead until we approach.\n\nLearning occurs when we ask questions and ponder answers. Accessible free resources promote self-learning, and those may suit one better than college or university.\n\nBriefly, those that start well succeed more often. Therefore, start well now. Sloth is a grave mistake if you want to succeed or be happy.\n\n2. Change: Adapting to Succeed\n\nAdapting to Succeed\nPhoto by Ian Kim on Unsplash\n\nWe each have our limited skill sets, and we are all flawed. However, the fear of failure should not overtake the defining human skill to adapt.\n\nHuman proficiency is a curve. Hence, we change and meet our expectations. We cannot know how we do things without trying them with heart. Trying new things makes us fulfilled. Therefore, the time to try our hands at things is now.\n\nHowever, we should keep options for if we face repeating failure. Sometimes pressure corners us. Then we need to follow up on an out. For this, we need to know that our position is not permanent.\n\n3. Keeping an Out\n\nComplete career changes are uncommon, but those that can steer toward a fresh direction are brave. Likewise, you must know when to change tracks, because there are no signboards on the road to success.\n\nEntrepreneurs bring unknowns to the masses. It is all about putting yourself out there as a brand. For example, you cannot rise to a General if you do not enrol in the army first.\n\nAs glory ends, so changes a period of humble beginnings into bigger things. In fact, eminent people respect those who work petty jobs; they stay fulfilled with little.\u00a0\n\nStanding on your own feet is an arduous task that takes dedication and time. Those who accomplish this feat are ready for the challenges of life.\n\nThe road to being successful forks many times, but you should not confuse yourself. Focus on your current task. At the end of every road, a happy future awaits.\u00ad\u00ad\n\n4. Self-Education: Free Resources That Bring Success\n\nPhoto by Vlada Karpovich from Pexels\n\nWe are lucky to have myriads of opportunities. Now the school has jumped the bounds of school, and education is easier than dreamt.\n\nNow, education is of three types: formal, informal, and non-formal. The education we receive\/d at school, college, or university is formal education. Again, knitting, which we often learn from family, is part of informal education. By contrast, education saves the school, e.g. boy scouts, adult courses, programs, etc., is non-formal.\n\nInformal education has been the same for a long time, and formal education guides us. Yet, unsung non-formal education upholds the most natural learning experience: that of self-education.\u00a0\n\nBesides, in non-formal or self-education, we may ask as many questions as we want and get feedback. Though automation hastens the process, a human touch still stays.\u00a0\n\nMoreover, unlike chalk on blackboards, online resources stay up forever.\n\n5. Self-Education\u2019s Benefits\n\nNon-formal education helps you become successful in your field in two ways. First, it lets you start in any field with a strong footing and make career changes without direct consequences.\u00a0\n\nNext, you have control over your study pace and may try out many paths you like, at once.\n\n6. Find Free Resources\n\nSome school sites, e.g. Coursera, EdX, Saylor Academy, Udemy, Skillshare, etc., teach slews of themes. These are the best online hubs of learners like us.\u00a0\n\nThe openness of these gives you mobility and flexibility. Besides, free, mobile, and video resources always help you take those first leaps.\n\nCollege may not be for you, and half-hearted learning bears no fruit. If you confide in non-formal education, invest your time into an effective start.\n\n7. A Good Start: Success\u2019s Open Secret\n\nGood Start\nPhoto by olia danilevich from Pexels\n\nThe open secret that makes you successful faster: do not be lazy. If you know these magic words, no man or thing can ever block your way.\n\nStarting takes courage, especially when trying unconventional ventures. From adapting to change to educating yourself, everything starts with one swift decision to start.\u00a0\n\nWhether you decide with wit or on a whim is up to you, but remember the consequences.\n\nThe universe will not give miraculous cues for you to start. Instead, we all must quit the common sin of laziness. Lazy people not only stir chaos in society but also doom their future selves.\n\n8. Why Start Now\n\nThe waiting man does not succeed easily. For instance, a man that waits for supreme chances loses to whoever knows the lay of the land. Beginnings are humble and messier than reckoned, but we must start somewhere.\n\nNow we know that we can change our learning path at any time using resources at absolutely no cost. Thus, those can aid education for anyone from school, college, or university and develop versatile skills.\n\nTherefore, start today\u2013start now. You must complete your first works with the little you have and then build your success on it.\u00a0\n\nSoon your customers will pay you for your labour or make you a big name in your industry. However, to make this happen, you must first stop being lazy and procrastinating.\n\nWith all these accessible free resources at our fingertips, the wise have already started and failed many times over. You must dare to fail if you hope to be successful.\n\n\nsuccess secrets\nPhoto by Andrea Piacquadio from Pexels\n\nThere are two kinds of success secrets: those hidden away in the minds of creative millionaires and open ones. \u201cDo not be lazy\u201d is an open secret to being successful.\n\nNobody can keep you from making a needed career change. Hence, keep a back-up plan for you and\/or your family.\n\nGive up being ultra-classy, and experience the free online resources of today, the diamonds in the rough. For, they will surely help you get ahead.\n\nThe start of a career can make or break it. Therefore, get back on the horse, and conquer the world\u2013but first, stop being lazy! Different people have different meanings of success.\u00a0\n\nIf you feel that you are not successful, then probably you haven\u2019t discovered yourself. Stop looking outside. Start looking inside.\n\nOnce you begin an inward journey, you do not need to copy others. You will find something that you love. Indeed, the first step is difficult.\u00a0\n\nBut, once you cross the barrier, there is no one to stop you. Forget being lazy for once, and witness the world bloom into a domain of happiness forever.\n\nLeave a Comment",

Just 15 miles away in Kalispell there\u2019s the Hockaday Museum of Art, Central School Museum and Conrad Mansion (Open May 15-Oct 13)\u00a0 \u2013 \u00a0a hidden jewel of a beautifully preserved pre-1900 mansion of the founder of Kalispell, Charles Conrad, complete with over 90% of the original family furnishings.\n\nGet pampered: Perhaps in your day-to-day life you don\u2019t have time for massages & spa treatments \u2013 but now you do \u2013 you\u2019re on vacation after all!\u00a0\u00a0 Take a day out for a mani\/pedi, massage or facial at one of the many day spas & salons here in the Valley.\u00a0 We\u2019re happy to recommend our favorites or visit: for a list of options.\n\nGo thrifting: Yea, it\u2019s a thing now \u2013 shopping at thrift stores and consignment shops \u2013 what used to be the necessity of a broke college student is now \u201ccool\u201d and a great way to find one-of-a-kind unique items and fashion finds. Whitefish has 2 thrift stores and several consignment shops including the Chic Boutique and Copperleaf Consignment.\u00a0 More thrift stores and consignment shops are to be had in Kalispell.\n\nHike local trails:\u00a0 The Whitefish Trail is a great place to get some exercise and the snow will be gone long before the trails of Glacier Park are cleared of the white stuff.\u00a0 Pick up a trail map and get moving.\n\nBike: There are many local mountain bike trails less than 10 miles from the Moose, including Spencer Mountain.\u00a0 You can rent a bike at Glacier Cyclery and hit the road.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a local\u2019s tip \u2013 Bike the Going to the Sun Road before it opens to car traffic.\u00a0 In mid-May to early June (perhaps earlier depending on the weather) the park service has the Going-to-the-Sun Road closed at Avalanche Creek to car traffic but beyond that point bikes are allowed and the road can be cleared to the Loop and beyond before you run into plow crews trying to clear the road.\u00a0 The road offers spectacular views and you won\u2019t have to worry about cars.\u00a0 For road status call: (406) 888-7800 or see it at:\n\nSee how things are made: Montana Coffee Traders gives tours of their roasting facility and as mentioned in a previous blog post Whitefish Pottery gives tours of their facility to curious visitors who want to pull back the curtain to see how artists get their hands dirty to make beautiful pottery.\n\nThose are just a few of the things you can do in the \u201coff-season\u201d here in the Flathead Valley and I didn\u2019t even get to mention: Seeing live music and theatre, antiquing, gambling, fishing or just bellying up to the bar at a local joint to get recommendations on things to do and see from a friendly barkeep who lives here year-round.\n\nSpring is also a great time to get great rates at the Hidden Moose Lodge since it\u2019s our \u201coff season\u201d too.\u00a0 See our Specials & Packages page for more info.\u00a0 Then give us a call at: 1 (888) 733-6667.\n\nAuthor: Sarah Stewart",
