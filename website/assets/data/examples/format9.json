        "text":"10 Questions to Ask a Debt Settlement Company\n\nThis article contains a list of 10 questions to ask a debt settlement company before you join a debt relief program.\n\nAs you might have noticed from our customer reviews, people either love or hate their debt settlement company. There are two reasons for this.\n\n  \u2022 They chose the wrong debt settlement company for their financial situation\n  \u2022 Or\/and they have unrealistic expectations about the benefits and disadvantages of a debt settlement.\n\nThis article provides a cheat sheet with 10 questions you should ask a potential debt settlement company to make sure it\u2019s a good fit for you. Read this guide for a comprehensive discussion of the pros and cons of a debt settlement.\n\nFree Debt Relief Consultation\n\nThe 10 Questions You Should Absolutely Ask Before Hiring a Debt Settlement Company\n\nIf you are deep in debt and you can only afford to make minimum payments, it makes sense to find out what your debt relief options are. Click here for a free debt settlement consultation. If you decide a debt settlement is a good option for your financial situation, make sure you ask the following questions before committing to a debt settlement company.\u00a0free debt settlement consultation\n\nAre you licensed to licensed to do business in my state?\n\nIf your agent doesn\u2019t know or is evasive about this question, beware. Some states have special restrictions and requirements on the use of debt management strategies. For instance, Alaska and Alabama have no restrictions, but California, Connecticut, Indiana, and Colorado all require firms to place a surety bond and register with the attorney office.\n\nHere is a list of current state regulations on debt management practices.\n\nHow long have you been in business?\n\nAlthough it is perfectly possible a company that started last month will provide excellent service, you may want to let others take the chance first. Look for companies that have been in the debt settlement business for five years or more. You can check this on our review pages. While you\u2019re at it, check their Supermoney and BBB rating.\n\nAre you a member of the American Fair Credit Council or AFCC?\n\nAFCC members agree to follow strict industry standards. Every year, the AFCC and a third-party verification firm audit AFCC members to ensure they are following the highest ethical and quality requirements. It is not a requirement for debt settlement companies to be AFCC members, but you have to ask yourself why a serious company would not want to be part of the largest trade association serving the industry.\n\nFree Debt Relief Consultation\n\nHow much do your services cost?\n\nAlthough prices range depending on the services a company offers and the size of your debt, you want to make sure you get a clear answer. Typically, fees range from 18% to 25% of the enrolled debt balances. If your agent uhms and arrs about how much their services cost or how fees are calculated, proceed with caution.\n\nChoose a debt settlement company that only charges fees when they have settled an account. If you even get the whiff that a company wants to charge you upfront fees before they settle your account, run.\n\nWhere will you deposit my money while I\u2019m waiting for a settlement?\n\nDebt settlement programs generally take 24 to 48 months to complete. During that time, debtors make payments in an escrow account. Once the account has enough money, the debt settlement company uses the cash to negotiate a lump-sum settlement with creditors.\n\nMake sure your debt settlement company deposits your money in a bank that is FDIC insured. The account should be in your name, and you should have absolute control over the money in it. If the company asks you to save the money on your own or to deposit it in their business account for safekeeping, you know what to do. Run.\n\nWill you be making monthly payments to my creditors on my behalf?\n\nThis is a trick question. Debt settlements don\u2019t make payments to creditors. The whole point of the debt settlement method is to save the money you were using to make minimum payments on your debts to save toward a lump-sum payment. If you continue making your payments, creditors have no incentive to accept a settlement. They will happily continue cashing your monthly payments for years or decades.\n\nCan Creditors Sue Me?\n\nThis is another trick question to weed out companies that offer unrealistic assurances to clients. In some cases, creditors have the legal right to sue borrowers who are late on their payments. A debt settlement company worth its salt will try to negotiate with creditors to avoid this from happening, but no reputable company can guarantee this won\u2019t happen.\n\nHow long will it take to settle my first account?\n\nAlthough debt settlement companies cannot guarantee how long it will take a creditor to agree to a settlement, they should provide a rough estimate based on their experience. What you are looking for here is to ensure your company has a clear plan of action.\n\nAs long as you are regular with your monthly payments to the escrow account, you should get your first settlement within four to six months.\n\nCan you stop my creditors or their debt collectors from calling me?\n\nThe answer you want to hear is no. If the agent assures you they will put a stop to creditor calls, hang up. It is impossible to guarantee this.\n\nWill debt settlement hurt my credit?\n\nAgain, this is a reality check to separate serious debt relief specialists from scammers.\n\nThe right answer is yes. All debt settlement programs have a negative impact on your credit. Any company that claims it can guarantee creditors will not report missed payments to the credit bureaus is trying to scam you.\n\nNow you know the questions that separate legitimate debt settlement companies from the scammers that give the business a bad name, you are ready to start checking companies. Supermoney has done part of the job by filtering the leading companies based on the factors mentioned above.

        "text":"Why Gold Continues to Shine\n\nGold has been rallying higher since the start of 2014. In late December 2013, the precious metal was trading as low as $1181.40 an ounce, today the spot price of gold is $1342.50 an ounce. The current pattern on the daily chart of gold futures looks poised to trade into the $1400.00 level.\n\nHere are three reasons why gold should continue to rally in the near term:\n\n1. Gold is once again being viewed as a currency and not as a useless relic. At this time, investors are questioning all of this money printing by the central banks around the world. How long can these central bankers continue to just print money in order to inflate asset prices and boost exports? Think about it, record money printing is taking place by the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and other central banks around the world. The money printing by the central banks has even helped the virtual currency Bitcoin to gain traction over the past year. Remember, the reason why gold was used as a currency throughout history is because governments could not print it at will, unlike a fiat currency such as the U.S. Dollar or Japanese Yen.\n\n2. The consumer sentiment for gold in 2011 was enormous as almost everyone was bullish, but that is not the case today. Currently, many analysts and financial firms are still extremely bearish on gold since it plunged from its 2011 top. As long as the sentiment remains negative for gold it should continue to hold up and trade nicely higher. When everyone gets bullish on gold again, that is probably the time to jump ship and become less bullish on the precious metal.\n\n3. The current chart pattern on spot gold is bullish. Gold futures (GC J4) are trading sideways around the $1350.00 level. Whenever an equity consolidates and builds a sideways base it is getting poised to trade higher on the chart.\n\nAbout Nicholas Santiago 576 Articles\n\nAffiliation: InTheMoneyStocks.com\n\nNicholas Santiago started trading in 1991.

        "text":"[01\/09\/08 - 02:33 PM]\nThe 50 Best Episodes of 2007: #30-21\nBy Brian Ford Sullivan (TFC)\n\nIt's time once again for our annual list of the 50 best episodes of the past year. (For previous lists check the links to the right.)\n\nAs usual we'll be counting down 10 episodes a day until we get to the best episode of 2007 on Friday. The episodes on this list are based on nominations by myself and regular visitors to the site as to what we think the standout moments of the year were.\n\nWe also wanted to take this time to tell you about WHY WE WRITE, a fantastic new blog created by \"Eureka's\" Charlie Craig and Thania St. John. It's a collection of essays by some of TV's brightest minds about... you guessed it, why they write. And as luck would have it, the essayists who've contributed thus far are behind many of the episodes on this year's list.\n\nOur \"50 Best Episodes\" feature is designed as a celebration of TV's finest hours (and half-hours) so we're thrilled to give you a window into the minds of those who created them. With that mind, as the countdown continues, look for periodic excerpts from some of the WHY WE WRITE essays. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!\n\nAs always, our list will differ from the ones you sent in - but that's half the fun! So sit back, relax and enjoy the countdown!\n\n30. \"friday night lights: let's get it on\" (nbc)\n(originally aired: november 2, 2007)\n\nIt really is a testament to this show that the big moments - I genuinely thought Jason Street would be lost in the ocean forever after leaping from the booze cruise, only to have it turn out to be his first step back to peace with his condition - and the little ones - everything from Eric trying to woo Tami back to the bedroom, Saracen regaining his self-respect and Tyra breaking Landry's heart - feel equally natural and effortless.\n\n29. \"the knights of prosperity: pilot\" (abc)\n(originally aired: january 3, 2007)\n\nSeriously - Mick Jagger buttering his popcorn with a Rolling Stones tongue statue, the red 1970s-era T-shirts, Rockefeller asking if there will be cookies, using a Jewish supply store as their clubhouse, Gourishanker describing his love of a certain female organ - what wasn't there to love about this show?\n\n28. \"andy barker, pi: fairway, my lovely\" (nbc)\n(originally aired: march 22, 2007)\n\nI don't know about you, but the image of Peter Allen Vogt running in slow motion was burned into my brain for about a week after this episode aired - and I laughed every time I thought about it.\n\n27. \"how i met your mother: something blue\" (cbs)\n(originally aired: may 14, 2007)\n\nAnother master class in the show's trademark storytelling technique - this time involving how Ted and Robin's relationship unraveled, all set against the backdrop of Marshall and Lily's wedding. Even better - it actually tied together a half-dozen or so throwaway scenes from the past few episodes.\n\n26. \"chuck: pilot\" (nbc)\n(originally aired: september 24, 2007)\n\n60 minutes, well 44 and change without commercials, of geeky heartfelt fun.\n\n25. \"it's always sunny in philadelphia: the gang finds a dumpster baby\" (fx)\n(originally aired: september 13, 2007)\n\nAfter reading the episode title we knew this would be a \"Sunny\" classic.\n\n24. \"csi: crime scene investigation: living doll, part 1\" (cbs)\n(originally aired: may 17, 2007)\n\nThe fruit of its season long, unexpectedly riveting \"miniature killer\" arc, this episode defined the word cliffhanger as the fate of Sara Sidel - not to mention actress Jorja Fox's involvement with the show - was left up in the air.\n\n\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" executive producer Carol Mendelsohn on why she writes: \"In high school, one of my teachers took an informal poll. She asked our class, \ufffdHow many hours of TV do you watch a week?\ufffd I watched 49 hours. From the moment I got up in the morning to the moment I went to sleep. TV was my best friend. In study hall, while others were studying, I was conjuring up episodes of the Big Valley and The Virginian in my head. I could hear the voices of my favorite characters. And when a line I made up didn't sound right, I'd rewrite it. Some things never change. I never told anyone about these 'voices'. I didn't want to be labeled as a crazy. It wasn't until I got my first staff job that I confessed my eccentricity. And that's when I discovered that someone else heard voices, too. Writers hear voices. Which is why I never think of writing as writing. To me, it's more like dictation. Which raises a fundamental question. If I'm not doing the writing, who is?\"\n\n23. \"extras: christmas special\" (hbo)\n(originally aired: december 27, 2007)\n\nSure the first hour was endless self-inflicted melancholy, but boy did those last few scenes - especially Andy's should-be-seen-by-everyone tirade against celebrity - made its swan song a classic one.\n\n22. \"the office: the negotiation\" (nbc)\n(originally aired: april 5, 2007)\n\nTake your pick - Michael accidentally cross dressing, Dwight macing Roy, Darryl finding out how much Michael makes, Angela being turned on by Dwight macing Roy, \"bibbity bobbity\" - this was \"The Office\" in top form.\n\n21. \"the unit: five brothers\" (cbs)\n(originally aired: november 6, 2007)\n\nWhile Hector's death was certainly shocking, just as unnerving was how the Unit took control of an innocent family's home and killed one of its members when their cover was about to be blown.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[january 2008]\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nmost recent reviews | view all posts\n[01\/11\/13 - 09:17 PM]\nThe 50 Best Episodes of 2012: #10-1\nOur annual countdown concludes with \"Louie,\" \"The Walking Dead,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and more!\n\n[01\/10\/13 - 11:08 PM]\nThe 50 Best Episodes of 2012: #20-11\nOur annual countdown continues with \"Fringe,\" \"The Good Wife,\" \"Breaking Bad\" and more!\n\n[01\/09\/13 - 11:22 PM]\nThe 50 Best Episodes of 2012: #30-21\nOur annual countdown continues with \"Community,\" \"Justified,\" \"Mad Men\" and more!\n\n[01\/08\/13 - 11:14 PM]\nThe 50 Best Episodes of 2012: #40-31\nOur annual countdown continues with \"Modern Family,\" \"White Collar,\" \"Parks & Recreation\" and more!\n\n[01\/07\/13 - 11:05 PM]\nThe 50 Best Episodes of 2012: #50-41\nOur annual countdown kicks off with \"Arrow,\" \"Spartacus,\" \"Last Resort\" and more!\n\n[07\/26\/12 - 08:12 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"Guys With Kids\" (NBC)\n\n[07\/26\/12 - 08:11 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"Midnight Sun\" (NBC)\n\n[07\/26\/12 - 08:10 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"The Goodwin Games\" (FOX)\n\n[07\/26\/12 - 08:09 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"Prodigy\/Bully\" (FOX)\n\n[07\/25\/12 - 08:18 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"Golden Boy\" (CBS)\n\n[07\/25\/12 - 08:17 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"Applebaum\" (CBS)\n\n[07\/25\/12 - 08:16 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"How to Live With Your Parents (For the Rest of Your Life)\" (ABC)\n\n[07\/25\/12 - 08:15 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"Prairie Dogs\" (ABC)\n\n[07\/24\/12 - 08:05 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"The New Normal\" (NBC)\n\n[07\/24\/12 - 08:04 AM]\nThe Futon's First Look: \"Daddy's Girls\" (FKA \"Table for Three\") (NBC)",

        "text":"Last time members of Congress were on recess, thousands came out to confront them. Videos circulated of representatives facing impassioned constituents demanding to know why lawmakers would play politics with their health care. Some of the most dramatic confrontations involved representatives in Republican-dominated states, such Utah\u2019s Jason Chaffetz and Tennessee\u2019s Diane Black.\n\nBeginning this week through\u00a0April 23, lawmakers will be back in their districts. Here are some key ways to make your representatives and President Trump feel the heat during the next two weeks:\n\n1. Demand Congress vote on Trump\u2019s new war in Syria. To start, Congress should not have left for recess without voting on President Trump\u2019s illegal military escalation in Syria. As you\u2019re meeting with, confronting, and calling your members of Congress, let them know that they must debate and rein in Trump\u2019s attacks on Syria. You can also sign our petition here\n\n2. Confront your representatives in person. There are a number of resources to help you find town halls and protests in your area, connect with the organizers behind the actions, or organize your own protest or meeting with a lawmaker. Check out\u2019s Resistance Recess calendar and map, as well as the Town Hall Project\u2019s map of town halls, both of which make it easy to find events. Even if your representative won\u2019t hold a town hall or meet with you, you can join with others to call them out for their cowardice, as activists are doing in Chris Collins\u2019s district in upstate New York and at Senator Portman\u2019s office in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nTo help you plan, check out Resistance Recess\u2019s tool kits on issues such as President Trump\u2019s attacks on climate science and proposed draconian budget cuts, as well as Indivisible\u2019s resources on how you can make your town-hall actions effective.\u00a0Also check out Free Press\u2019s talking points on Net neutrality, as many senators and representatives\u00a0are just as eager as our president and FCC chairman to repeal rules protecting the open Internet.\u00a0\n\n3. Join the Tax March on Saturday, April 15 and demand to see Trump\u2019s tax returns. Planned for Washington, DC, and cities around the country, organizers are demanding that the president release his tax returns, with the DC march and others also calling for Congress to pass legislation requiring President Trump and all future presidential candidates to release their returns. Find a march near you and more details here.\u00a0And in the week leading up to the march, help spread the word by creating a video detailing why you want to see Trump\u2019s returns. March organizers are asking people to post their videos to Twitter using the hashtags #Whatareyouhiding and #TaxMarch so Tax March partners can retweet them.\n\n4. Keep calling. On the days you can\u2019t confront your members of Congress in person, find their district numbers (typically located on their websites), and call them.",
