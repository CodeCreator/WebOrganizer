        "text":"The formation of the Ryde Sea Rescue Scheme, run principally by the Vectis Fishing Club using 12 ft dinghies powered by\u00a0 small Seagull outboards from their base half way down the pier \u2013 itself the premises of the original Ryde Lifeboat station run by the RNLI until the early 1920\u2019s., and the St John Ambulance Brigade. Originally formed as a beach voluntary lifeguard unit in 1956 following a double drowning fatality at the end of Ryde pier. We first operated from the western sands at Ryde with a reel & line and a small rowing dinghy\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe reformation of a beach voluntary lifeguard unit operating from the Western. A Lifeguard club also known as Ryde Lifeguard Corps did exist in the late 1940\u2019s but was disbanded in about 1951 through lack of support.The new Ryde Life Guard Corps got underway in May 1956, helped by the expertise of Shanklin Life Guard Corps and two of their members Gerry Ault (later to become our second President) and Bernard Lavender were co-opted in to the new club to help swell the numbers to obtain the statuary 10 qualified lifeguards to be recognised by the Royal Lifesaving Society as an official lifeguard club. Help was also provided by Sandown Lifeguard Corps through their Club captain Eric Scott and the St John Ambulance Brigade \u2013 Ryde Cadet Division and Superintendent George Mears. We received a lot of support from the Borough of Ryde through Reg Lugg and Norman Cooper at the Enquires Bureau on the Western Esplanade\n\nGordon Osborne (still active as Secretary of Ryde Inshore Rescue) was elected as the first Club Captain and the unit began training for their RLSS bronze medallion medals at Warner\u2019s Holiday Camp at Puckpool. This was an open unheated pool, using the Gardeners hut as the changing area. As the only pool available within travelling distance \u2013 no of us had cars in those days we were very grateful although the midges under the trees did sting a lot.\n\nOur equipment at the start consisted of a 9ft rowing boat kindly loaned by the Borough of Ryde, a Reel and line and a Rocket line The latter was most impressive but apart from a couple of practice shots we were never to use it in anger. We had two beach huts for changing \u2013 next to the Red Cross hut on the Western, and keeping our equipment in. On a busy day\u00a0 we had to change in\u00a0 relays as if three of us tried to change at once inevitably we emerged ( we had no electric lighting or power) with the wrong clothes on!dory\n\nFirst inshore capability in 1969 when vandals destroyed the rowing dinghy and the club raised funds to replace it with a dory powered with 40 HP outboard. Began long association with Coastguard and built up an inshore\u00a0 Search & Rescue capability but still principally a lifeguard unit\n\nIn 1978 we were again victims of vandalism when our Boat house was destroyed by fire. Through a major fundraising effort and help from the local Council they were able to build their present HQ and Rescue Centre at the Appley end of Ryde seafront.\n\nOver the next 10 years, the club\u2019s primary role gradually changed from beach life guarding to becoming a full Inshore Rescue Lifeboat unit.\n\nOur Equipment Todaymsu\n\nWe operate two lifeboats, a 6.3 metre RIB and a 5 metre inflatable, which are launched by a special launch vehicle and a tractor respectively as shown in the photo below.\n\n\u00a0The main lifeboat\u00a0Sir Norman Echlin Bt\u00a0is only 3 years old and was only possible after the club, greatly assisted by local businesses, organizations & individuals had raised \u00a350000 in under one year for its purchasevehicles\n\nAt low water tide it is necessary to tow the lifeboats out through nearly a mile of shallow water before they can be launched. The salt water environment is not kind to the standard agricultural tractor and they have to be replaced regularly.",

        "text":"History of Brockville Arts Centre\n\nFrom the beginning\n\n1858 \u2013 The present Brockville Arts Centre on King Street West is built to serve as a town hall, market place and fire engine house. (Two of the original date stones still exist placed on the outside wall).\n\n1880 \u2013 The town hall is moved to a new location allowing for the creation of Brockville\u2019s first real theatre called The Opera House.\n\n1911 \u2013 The building is expanded creating a tall fly tower, spacious dressing rooms and the third largest stage in Canada. The Opera House is renamed New Theatre.\n\n1929 \u2013 New Theatre closes due to declining revenues. The theatre remains \u201cdark\u201d through much of the so called \u201cdirty thirties\u201d.\n\n1937 \u2013 Fire destroys the auditorium. Fortunately, the proscenium\u2019s asbestos curtain saves the huge stage, backstage area and fly tower.\n\n1939 \u2013 The renovated building reopens as a motion-picture theatre called The Regent.\n\n1958 \u2013 The rising popularity of television forces the closure of The Regent. (Today, in the projection booth the two 35 milimetre film projectors continue to function and are used for special screenings).\n\n1960 \u2013 The building reopens as Brockville\u2019s Civic Auditorium offering a venue for local theatre groups and professional touring companies.\n\n1975 \u2013 The Civic Auditorium is renovated including an expansion to accommodate a lobby art gallery and box office.\n\n1981 \u2013 The rear of the building is expanded for rehearsal space, set construction, prop and wardrobe storage.\n\n1990 \u2013 The building is renamed Brockville Arts Centre.\n\n2009 \u2013 Project ENCORE! \u2013 a community-driven undertaking, restores and redecorates the theatre under the direction of Designer Peggy Irvine.\n\nFacebook Posts\n\nThis message is only visible to admins.\n\nPPCA Error: Due to Facebook API changes it is no longer possible to display a feed from a Facebook Page you are not an admin of.

        "text":"Home Page; Spring Valley Methodist Church Museum\n\nOn the National Register of Historical Places\n\n221 West Courtland Street\n\nWelcome To Spring Valley!\n\nWe invite you to visit the church built in 1876 when the James Wilder family were members. Church records reveal that pastors or presiding elders baptized and performed marriage rites for Eliza Jane and Laura Ann Wilder. Records also indicate that Almanzo and Laura (Ingalls) Wilder attended here in 1890 and 1891. When contruction of the Methodist Church at 221 West Courtland began in 1876, James M. Wilder was among the early contributors. His pledge of $50 was one of the largest amounts. As early as 1858 the Methodists raised $2,000 toward a building while they continued to meet regularly in the upstairs hall at Parson's Stone Block. It wasn't until 1876 that the lot on West Courtland Street was purchased, and steps taken to build the church. The church's beautiful Victorian-Gothic architecture with 21 stained glass windows as well as the museum's two floor display of exhibits are just a few of the things that await you here in Spring Valley.\n\nTake a look inside the museum.",
