        "text":"Westport Historical Society\n\n\nWheeler House, the Society\u2019s headquarters, at 25 Avery Place, Westport, Connecticut, was purchased in 1981. The house, built in 1795, was remodeled in the Italianate style in the 19th Century and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Connecticut Register of Historic Places. The house has three Victorian Period rooms and a gift shop. The only octagonal-roof, cobblestone barn in Connecticut, which is on the property, was completely restored over a ten-year period and houses the Museum of Westport History displaying a diorama of the town as it looked toward the end of the 19th Century. The Society has hosted series of educational lectures and has mounted a succession of well-received exhibits which have been an important part of the continuing programs presented to the town. Children\u2019s special events, after school, vacation and summer camp programs are offered during the year. House Tours and Garden Tours are regular parts of each year\u2019s program. Adams Academy, a 19th Century, one-room schoolhouse on its original site in Green\u2019s Farms, has been restored by the Society and is a stop on the Colonial Westport tour, Jennings Trail, that the Society and the Westport Young Woman\u2019s League sponsor together for Westport\u2019s 500 third-graders. Brochures are available for a self-guided, walking tour of the King\u2019s Highway Historic District as well as a driving tour, Jennings Trail, annotating the two dozen plaques marking historical sites in Westport. A plaque added by Peter Jennings to the Jennings Trail tour in 2000 was the inspiration for a book the Society published, The Bridge Not Taken: Benedict Arnold Outwitted, by Damon Douglas. Other publications include: Staples High School: 120 Years of A+ Education by Dan Woog Westport, Connecticut \u2013 The making of a Yankee Township by Edward Coley Birge Stories from Westport\u2019s Past (series of 3) by Joanna Foster Westport, A Special Place, by Eve Potts and Howard Munce Stars in our Eyes, by Tom DeLong Westport, Connecticut \u2013 The Story of a New England Town\u2019s Rise to Prominence, by Woody Klein Westport and Weston, Connecticut, by William Scheffler Historic Plaques \u2013 How can I get a historic plaque for my house? Several years ago the Westport Historical Society started a house plaque program to allow homeowners to show pride in owning historical houses. The plaques identified the original owner of the house and the date of construction. Today Westport has 117 historical plaques identifying houses that were built over 100 years ago. To raise more awareness of the history of our town, the Westport Historical Society has embarked on a direct mail campaign to homeowners that have houses which were built over 100 years ago. The material provided includes the historical importance of the house and the proposed house plaque appearance. Homeowners receiving the material can acknowledge the historical value of their house by requesting a handcrafted plaque from the Westport Historical Society. There is a fee of $250 which covers the costs of the plaque and a contribution to the Westport Historical Society. As House History Chair, Bob Weingarten is in charge of the plaque program. The new program started with letters to 45 town homeowners with houses built over 100 years ago. The response exceeded our expectations and he intends to continue this program since there are over 300 additional homeowners with houses built over 100 years ago. The need to document our historical roots is great. As owners of historic homes, we can establish a precedent of research and care for future generations.

        "text":"Minus icon Plus icon Plus icon Print Icon\n\nWelcome to the Town of LaSalle\n\nLaSalle Collage\n\nNamed after the French explorer, Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle, French settlers first established roots in the area in the mid 1700s. A mission was established in the Town of Sandwich, resulting in people settling in the Turkey Creek area. LaSalle's history and that of Essex County were very much entwined when they were officially identified as part of Upper Canada in 1792. In 1991, residents of LaSalle opted to define themselves as a Town; and, in turn, immediately became one of the larger communities of Essex County with a population of just over 30,000.\n\nIn a region of Ontario with less than 4% tree cover for the entire county, the Town of LaSalle is fortunate to still have a small but significant amount of land area consisting of Carolinian forests, provincially significant wetlands, and tall grass prairie communities. Approximately 7% of all land situated within the corporate limits of the Town of LaSalle (excluding Fighting and Grassy Islands) is wooded and\/or contains plant species and wildlife habitat which, from a biological perspective, is considered to be a \"natural heritage area\". Natural heritage areas are defined as sites that are relatively undisturbed and which retain some ecological function such as providing habitat for wildlife or contributing to the protection and enhancement of water quality.\n\nConsidering historical trends, recent development activity in the Town and the surrounding municipalities, remaining sanitary sewage capacity and land supply, and likely future economic prospects, the most probable forecasts indicate that by the year 2016 the Town's overall population will be in the range of 32,400 to 44,500. This represents an expected average annual growth rate varying between 2.5-4.0 %.\n\nThe age profile of the Town's population has changed significantly since the early 1970s, with an increase in the number of mature adults and seniors and a corresponding decline in the number of children. The mature adult population increased from 21% in 1971 to 29% in 1991, whereas the school aged population has decreased from 35 to 24% of the Town's total population. These shifts are not unexpected, as they are primarily a result of the baby boom generation (individuals born between 1947 and 1966) moving through young adulthood to the 35 to 54 age group.\n\nRead the full Town of LaSalle Community Profile\n\nTown of LaSalle 2016 Census Profile",

For the entire acreage, he paid $1,000. Mr. Castleberry planned a year-round music resort ranch for vacationers...he secured William O. Creasman of Bent Creek Ranch Road to be foreman in charge of the project...The ranch house was fashioned from trees cut on the property...Soon honeymoon cottages, stables, a lake and many recreational facilities were in place...In the mid-1960s, Kavanagh-Smith (the builders of Bent Creek development) designated 21 acres of land to be used as a private recreational facility for the homeowners.\"\n\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s the park flourished, under the care of the Bent Creek Lodge Association and the residents of the Bent Creek community. In addition to the Lodge itself, the Association used the park area for a neighborhood playground, tennis and basketball courts, and eventually a community swimming pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Lodge burned down in 1991, and was never re-built. Care of the park fell by the wayside and the land was deeded over to Buncombe County, with the stipulation that it could only be used for recreational purposes.\n\n\n\nThe park property had been gated off for many years, but in 2001 a dedicated band of neighbors committed themselves to raising money and rebuilding the park. They leased the land from the city and formed Bent Creek Community Park, Inc.\n\n\nOver the years the park has undergone many changes; swings and a sandbox have been constructed, the basketball courts have been repaved, there is a roller-hockey area, playground equipment, a volleyball court, a pavilion, shed, and electricity! Additionally, the park is now regularly mowed and maintained, and plans are in the works for several future projects both small and large. Our progress seems to be slow but sure, and our goal is clear: to continue\u00a0to re-build the park and to thus provide our neighborhood with a safe and beautiful place to enjoy both community and nature. Please consider joining our effort; every little bit of help is appreciated!",

More than 270,000 people are living with HIV and AIDS, and over 100,000 children have lost one or both parents to the disease.

World Vision was able to work alongside communities to accomplish the following in 2012.\n\n  \u2022 Trained communities to develop disaster preparedness plans that include first aid and decision-making strategies.\n\n  \u2022 Educated youth about on beekeeping practices and farmers on crop production, management, and marketing to increase their household income.\n\n  \u2022 Constructed new classrooms so more children could attend school, and built a footbridge so children could get across a stream on the way to school during the rainy season.\n\n  \u2022 Increased food security in communities by supplying farmers with seeds, tools, animal feed, and veterinary care for their livestock.\n\n  \u2022 Supported vulnerable children and people living with HIV and AIDS by providing them with food, helping with school fees, and offering medical assistance.\n\n  \u2022 Reduced waterborne diseases in communities by building clean water systems and new latrines, and by teaching hygiene sessions in schools.\n\n  \u2022 +\n    World Vision in Lesotho Today\n\n    World Vision is committed to partnering with the people of Lesotho to improve their lives today and to help enact sustainable solutions for the future of their children, families, and communities. World Vision's child sponsorship program plays a vital role in this partnership, with donors from the United States sponsoring more than 21,200 girls and boys. In addition to sponsorship, World Vision operates other programs that benefit communities in Lesotho. Highlights include:\n\n    \u2022 Ensuring children have access to quality education in improved facilities.\n    \u2022 Increasing economic development by helping hardworking self-employed parents to increase their incomes in order to feed, educate, and provide healthcare for their children.\n\n    World Vision History in Lesotho\n\n    World Vision child sponsorship in Lesotho dates back to 1976, with child sponsorship programs in two schools; an office was opened in 1987.\u00a0Since then, some of World Vision\u2019s major accomplishments have included:\n\n    \u2022 Providing nutritional programs, clean drinking water, and sanitation facilities, as well as meeting farming needs during the 1980s.\n    \u2022 Supplying meals for malnourished children and offering women vocational training to help them generate income in the late 1980s through the 1990s.\n    \u2022 Distributing food, toiletries, and fuel and offering recovery assistance programs to families affected by the Southern Africa food crisis in the 21st century.\n\n    Geography & People\n\n    Geography and people\n\n    Lesotho is a small, mountainous, independent nation completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa. It is the only independent state in the world that lies entirely above 4,500 feet in elevation\u2014in fact, 80 percent of the country lies above 5,900 feet.\n\n    Due to its altitude, Lesotho remains cool throughout most of the year. The nation\u2019s most important, yet scarce, resource is water for hydroelectricity. Other natural resources include farming and grazing land, sand, clay, building stone, and diamonds.\n\n    The Basotho make up over 99 percent of Lesotho\u2019s population and have lived in Southern Africa for nearly 600 years. Sesotho and English are both official languages, while Zulu, Xhosa, and French also are spoken.\n\n    In rural areas, many extended families live together in a compound. The compound includes several buildings, a garden, and living space for animals. Everyone contributes to the upkeep and maintenance by doing chores, cooking, caring for the animals, and other tasks.\n\n\n    After 100 years under British protection, Lesotho became an independent nation in October 1966 with King Moshoeshoe II as sovereign. Political unrest after the 1970 elections led to a revision of the constitution and a lessening of the king\u2019s power in politics.\n\n    In February 1990, the chairman of the military council stripped the king of his executive power, paving the way for Moshoeshoe\u2019s son to be sworn in as King Letsie III.\n\n    Hundreds of demonstrators demanded new parliamentary elections in 1998. Riots destroyed nearly 80 percent of commercial infrastructure in major towns and stalled what had been a steadily growing economy. Troops from South Africa and Botswana entered the country to suppress a mutiny.\n\n    Lesotho held peaceful elections in 2002, but disputes continue over recent elections.\n\n    Prayer Requests for Lesotho\n\n    \u2022 Rains to come and ease Lesotho\u2019s drought.\n    \u2022 Children to succeed in school, even in crowded classrooms.\n    \u2022 Political peace and stability in the coming years.\n    \u2022 Families struggling with poverty and hunger.",
